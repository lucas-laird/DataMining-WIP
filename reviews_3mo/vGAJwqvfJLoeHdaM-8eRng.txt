Same any other Chilis but last time service much more expected   place busy but staff seemed very friendly   server never let cup reach bottom   When steak ordered came she asked if would cut see if way wanted it   Such simple request yet made happy   Instead running away coming back fifteen minutes check she stayed sure food perfect before walking away   If more places would save bunch heartache spit food  <EOR>
