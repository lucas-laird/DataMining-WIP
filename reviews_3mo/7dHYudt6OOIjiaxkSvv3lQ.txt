I'll give 5 star rating any day week but Vegas where  would rather gnaw off arm pay $300 dinner  burger joint especially welcome  Yes cheap fast food but when you're drunk nothing better  closes 1 30am Friday don't bother showing 5am thinking score burger shake  just going happen    A personal tale Leaving ghostbar night luminous In and Out sign called names grabbed taxi  When arrived ravenous images double doubles dancing heads started pay driver  He said no no  wait   No joke he turned off meter just chilled while food  Because generous nature brought back #1  only right    I also spent rest night looking homeless youth because massive grease stains shirt where double double little rowdy  Only Vegas? Probably not  <EOR> OK particular isn't think talking but hey In n Out always good i mean always fresh! Anyhow if off strip defnitely worth it   I've desparate take cab through drive through just some decent sustenance isn't going cost more Andrew Jackson! <EOR>
