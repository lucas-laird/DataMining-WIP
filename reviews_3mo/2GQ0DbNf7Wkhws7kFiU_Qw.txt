Wurstle interesting concept lot room grow but few kinks work out   Basically hot dog stand own unique bread sauces    many different kinds sausage cheddar spicy two remember along plain baguette wheat one   kind hollow inside baguette put sauces additions including mustard ketchup onions sauerkraut then put sausage hole     The product good but few things odd it   First all any toppings put invariably fall bottom baguette instead being evenly distributed   Also seems sausage thin compared bread sometimes flavor lost amongst flavor bread   Finally absolutely atrocious when cold I know because when giving samples tray kind cold cooled off pieces very quickly   Note owners point samples good presentation delicious product entice people try your product!  If sample's bad people think product's bad when really isn't! Anyway bad but best either   give them another shot week worth shot  <EOR>
