I love salt fish fried rice here  best place town it  chow fun really good too  But brought back amazing wine list  kidding me? Petrus? Lafite? What?  You wouldn't expect typically family oriented chinese restaurant but impressive wine list where spend thousands bottle wine if wanted to   Considering late night hours surprised offer bottles  I'd imagine some high rollers come late dinner some serious gambling  <EOR>
