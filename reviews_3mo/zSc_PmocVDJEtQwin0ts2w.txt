I decided visit La Pizza 4 days staying Paris walking every time walked hotel   dropped during last night right before closed   I opted special combo which 2 slices pizza soda $9 99   really good deal considering slices huuuge!!  picked Margherita slice slice Wild Mushroom pizza http bit ly 1shKE7T    Both really good!  The spot conjoined JJ's Boulangerie open 11am 2am definitely spot consider those late night munchies Strip  <EOR> Hits spot late night or if you're wimp me    early night   only complaint margarita pizza    cheese pepperoni grubbin' though! <EOR> Decent cheap  two slice soda combo only $10  marghrita pizza pretty good  combo slice pathetic  Only 1 1 2 pieces pepperoni few pieces other toppings  Kinda soggy but crust good  <EOR> Been few times now two trips     First trip pizza hard end but near 2am dont think making anymore   This trip 2x first time great selection good second time weekend inside outside order station since group inside   4 pizzas while line staring right but person working outside station quick hell two workers inside helping register took your order there   stand line 20 minutes register ask pizza she says any there???  said while standing maybe should help pizza while other does register she says if want faster maybe outside order it   then try explain if none inside none outside right she says maybe next time     I deduct star but only pizza cheaper sabbaro taste better   2 slices soda 10 80!!!!  D <EOR> Ended kiddies realizing did *not* want wait line buffet Paris   ordered whole pizza half cheese half pepperoni if kids you'll it    decent although pizza local joint better plus bit pricey $40+ pizza four drinks although *is* Vegas    Older son thought crust chewy but didn't mind  okay choice if need some grub pinch  <EOR>
