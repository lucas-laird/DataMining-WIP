On food nigiri overall very good   Salmon belly unagi favorites absolutely did disappoint   fish rice ratio amazing which thing sushi restaurant break experience   Unfortunately yellowtail little icy frozen fish perhaps    fan would again reason   appetizers average miso soup salad calamri   miso little salty side   Salad nothing special but refreshing   calamari served generic sweet chili sauce which mediocre   Unfortunately most disappointing actual rolls   drenched sauces mayonnaise excessive ruined experience eating fish   If come back I'd stick just nigiri pick rolls didn't come some sort sauce   A big perk handful desserts choose end your meal   mango mochi tempura ice cream which both very delicious!  An AYCE meal costs $21 lunch $26 dinner which pretty typical any AYCE sushi place   sure if Vegas better AYCE sushi places but place pretty good I'd definitely come back ton nigiri  <EOR> I haven't sushi min but place far takes cake!  best places Chinatown!
