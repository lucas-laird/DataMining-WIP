So saw picking stuff Target excited try Rotisserie chicken but little dis appointed    First off rotisserie chicken should really juicy but wasn't  give garlic  spread made sour cream think but give really small amount it  need give whole lot more since chicken little bland other skin    I hoping place made rotisserie chicken Zankuo chicken LA but no luck there  wasn't even good rotisserie Ronco showtime oven    I full but un satisfied since missing flavor  <EOR> What pleasant surprise!  stopped new little chicken place saw over near target pet'smart Eastern Silverado   The atmoshpere little sterile but really don't care place   more take type food versus $40 steaks    I 1 4 grilled chicken sides mac n'cheese hummus   look chicken might think meh   But once bit into YUMMO!   saw them brush sauce when grill which turns d'lish citrus flavor    Just food clear fresh flavors muddled salty   wishing now gotten 1 2 chicken instead 1 4!  They made mac n' cheese fresh hummus some best ever had    The owner gracious nice making honest effort successful small business   The other staff fast friendly    Extra bonus points    THEY DELIVER!!  I'm thinking  Chicken D'lish once week! Give try! <EOR> Chicken seemed quail sized next typical costco bird fewer hormones probably better tasting bird    but while should actually thrill wasn't juicy nor could taste 'marinated 24 hours' flavor     I don't mac cheese box while prepared scratch let's just say seriously need better recipe   it awful   veg just ok   herbs would nice touch     not sure garlic sauce cross between really strong aioli sour cream    super shiny       for $16 whole chicken 2 small sides seriously underwhelmed   Counter girl needs LOT more training  does cook  <EOR> I've eaten Chicken D'Lish 4 times now huge fan! literally around corner also deliver   So being Cal very familiar Zankou Chicken am fan  Chicken D'Lish quite similar but 100% same  bad thing always! Every time roasted chicken juicy flavorful marinade use citrus based much tastier El Pollo Loco me  garlic spread pretty tasty if bit mild side   They fall short sides sadly  flavor issue more freshness one  garlic roasted potatoes taste good but look really unappetizing muddy grey anemic  also soggy no real crust them  rice tasty but felt undercooked me   I love love love baklava sell here! yet find great baklava Las Vegas till Chicken D'Lish  and if you know place Vegas sells excellent baklava TELL where beg you! Once week gotten love it! <EOR> Simple colorful dining room clean  Healthy chicken dishes sides  Food good price  Counter girl nice friendly only she forgot drink  Still over all nice local place <EOR>
