One new places food court still undergoing renovation Excalibur Hotel  currently deal coupon required which free medium drink purchase 2 chicken item combo  Good place eat if just want quick cheap meal  prefer place more Panda Express  <EOR> Pick Stix back! All Las Vegas area locations closed while back little heartbroken  love fried rice cream cheese won tons! When heard Excalibur location excited some beloved fried rice  Never mind having drive Strip committed  food court remodeled hard 2nd floor casino  diasappointed quick serve layout which means Panda Express type layout instead traditional made order Pick Stix love  Alas fried rice but can't plan shrimp chicken only fancy entree items such orange chicken spicy shrimp  employee very helpful she saw diasappointment offerings she told kid's meal fried rice  posted menu pretty good deal  fried rice little different remember but good enough back  <EOR> Don't late night fix close earlier stated advertised  When questioned staff said clocks said closing time perhaps clock 10 minutes fast staff just trying close wee bit early     Maybe best unlike any other location visited and normally raving fan Pick Stix all food location isn't made fresh order  pre made sits warming trays  need LA area fix  <EOR>
