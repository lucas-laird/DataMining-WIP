After catching show nearby V Theater wandered over Blondies when still located Aladdin Resort Casino name   probably Tuesday meant all drink beer well drinks $10     Walking into back tables beer pong full action reminded fraternities gone wild   even girls making mere sake making Vegas having guys gawk you  It wasn't even late yet girls far drunk! Bartenders less friendly probably because aren't making any tips during all drink beer nights   crappy attitude what's point?    It's bit pain won't even let eat watch games television without paying $10 front   part sucks alone   wear those bracelets anyway saying paid all drink why let other people eat?    I personally wouldn't bother returning  interested revisiting college frat life   But if that' you're looking am missing swing by!  You'll fit right your Greek letters   They apparently happy hour too  <EOR>
