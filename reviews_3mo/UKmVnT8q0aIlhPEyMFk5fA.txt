This Subway located Boulder Station  actually combo place because Winchell's Donuts attached it  However particularly sure if just share same space but same employees    I've picked sandwiches family myself quite few times  just really convenient close where live  But unfortunately service good  just might slowest Subway ever to  Ya know normally most Subways whip your sandwich super fast? here  Everything glacial pace when standing around stinky cigarette smelling Boulder Station want fast can!  I'm always disappointed Subway sandwiches though  just don't come close rival chain Port Subs but some reason Subway dominates fast sandwich world  bread always kind disappointing thin opinion  guess good thing toast your sandwich if want toasted but other just another Subway sandwich  <EOR>
