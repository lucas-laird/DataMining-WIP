Great comfort food focus meats  sliders great steaks  Nothing spectacular but neighborhood place moderate prices good  portions good sized but overly big which plus   I especially liked tomato salad disappointed discontinued it  But still love steaks!  I love restaurant open 24 hours loved frequenting bar midnight the food served then well Overall above average neighborhood restaurant bar  recommend it  <EOR>
