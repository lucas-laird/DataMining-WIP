Also cheese fries yummy  sad though hey took ambience sports book husbands favorites replaced all cool seating areas where used watch games diner style tables  <EOR> Best wings life  Plenty flavor don't even need any dipping sauce  There's much meat bones  They're incredible  <EOR> Had slice pizza here  Its conveniently next poker table planet Hollywood  Service could better  <EOR> I saw someone give great review wings    very surprising  Order wings three different flavors few wings gave up  Everything super salty artificial taste it  No idea if pizza good but avoid wings  Very disappointing  <EOR> The food actually pretty good little skeptical since such  bar atmosphere  chicken tenders buffalo sauce nacho fries which both delicious  only thing kind rubbed wrong way charged extra dollar ranch  huh? never place charges ranch when chicken wings  Otherwise good experience <EOR>
