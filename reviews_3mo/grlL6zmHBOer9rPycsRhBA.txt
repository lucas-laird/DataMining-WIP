Yes! mean it! told several people Vegas?! Yes! Vegas!   With spontaneous date night Vegas underway scurried cold into Bocho happy did! located coolest part Vegas opinion Fremont East  Awesome graffiti! Perfect venue!   We greeted several friendly faces beautiful sushi bar! waiter's hostess sushi chefs cheer magnetic  made instantly more happy! There's such great trendy feel place  There's fantastic colorful art walls  two levels! Lower level where sushi bar located upstairs where dining room bar hiding   My husband myself tried four different kinds sushi  better next! loved both mine! traditional Spicy Tuna a random grab located appetizers Jalapeno Bomb! Bomb seeded jalapeno stuffed tuna deep fried topped two different sauces  Savory slightly spicy am still having dreams it!!!!   Their sushi selection fantastic  fish delicious fresh!   Man! Take back please!! <EOR> My new favorite sushi spot!   This place cute! love inside staff very friendly  two stories  bottom floor long sushi bar several chairs  did see upstairs but additional seating    The chairs bar awkward really squeaky  odd little embarrassing trying them because noisy   food absolutely worth weird chairs    We ordered several items including garlic tuna three rolls  Everything tried fresh delicious  service friendly sushi chefs great time   The restaurant southwest corner 6th Carson  signage minimal easy miss it    I wait return  <EOR> Good sushi!! place located very quiet kindda ghetto part Fremont but sushi excellent  <EOR> I forgot he happy hour deal but pretty good deal  hurry quick bite  ordered yellowtail lover dang good  thoroughly enjoyed it  Service great too  wanna back during happy hour more peeps just gorge meal  <EOR> very friendly staff quick service very good sushi! Came two nights row  <EOR> I Bocho's space very LA NY loft style lot potential  Two levels bar seating downstairs bar tables upstairs  felt little more consideration could gone into plates  don't care cheap plastic plates buy your local asian grocery in fact think 168 probably better choices   tables also little small long plates sushi comes on    Service ok  server nice start but she took very long time bring water even longer time bring drinks  She did check food brought either   For appetizers chose Seaweed Salad Jalapeño Bomb jalapeño stuffed spicy tuna cream cheese   salad came mix romaine lettuce which seemed little weird filler ish  stuffed jalapeño good uniqueness but no means life changing   Bocho Special Roll tuna crab cucumber shrimp tempure crab assorted fish top basically glorified California roll  way big eat bite didn't leave any lasting impressions   Sashimi fresh large pieces  ordered Garlic Tuna Yellowtail Super White Tuna  ended receiving regular tuna instead garlic which isn't end world but little disappointing   I don't really see place given 5 stars  wonder other reviewers think good sushi    really good gets when many better restaurants there  happy see downtown expanding culinary tastes but Bocho long way before best  <EOR> I'm always downtown quite some time good majority regular patrons wanting sushi spot finally venture  Sad say Bocho did leave good impression   I looking forward trying ever since rumors began surface sushi restaurant opening downtown  heard mixed reviews friends since opening rather take others words finally decided check out    The sushi bar downstairs if basic reminds something may find Los Angeles New York where space premium  very well lit walk greated chefs  also upstairs dining area bit more spacious accommodate larger groups also private room available cocktail bar also located upstairs    As sat down server greeted quickly asked if we'd drinks  Water beer ordered brought table promptly followed complimentary edamame  Quite few things ordered off menu say fish very fresh flavors sauces condiments used rolls very tasty no complaints there  major thing issue anyone loves sushi should issue hard dense undercooked rice  mean you're sushi restaurant use rice all day long  could your major ingredient under par especially since base all your dishes  Again fish fresh delicious but can't good sushi restaurant if can't produce good rice!   Our bill split 3 which server did mind doing but she very attentive when came keeping water glass full checking sure things going okay  3 people ordered separate orders some them mixed together sushi   When asked server clarify she very flustered said she did know differentiate rolls  Also table next big group asked server take picture them which course would've bothered if she practically climbed table take picture them even excusing herself still finishing meal very unprofessional    So overall back??? Maybe possibly  If cook rice properly  <EOR> It just down right amazing!  worked two sushi restaurants both great quality stature but Vegas real gem its hand! <EOR>
