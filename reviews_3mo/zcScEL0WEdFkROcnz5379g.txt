I've already written full review take boiling crab   Take quick look if you'd like   Everything's just good Cali locations   Reason why giving place five stars cause service still sketch   place just opened couple weeks ago I'd imagine improve over time but mean time need step up   Although really friendly inviting seems many people just standing around   servers nice enough but keep asking shit should dropped even before food comes   ie  salt pepper limes spoons rice bib   When Cali take your order come back right away dropping all stuff needed BC consumption    No questions asked    25 cents filtered water whatever  50 cents condiments ranch tarter sauce etc    No liquor license yet but  expected cause takes while obtain   Overall still great place happy opened up   cravings nice finally fulfill   Cheeeeers! <EOR> went hot juicy expecting eat crawfish but ran out! server could told 15 minutes before she sat down six waters    BC down street pretty excited try out  heard bazillion great reviews coming LA n all    we ordered 4lbs XXX whole she bang 1lb med garlic spread crawfish along chicken fingers basket swt potato fries  fries could've crunchier  but     I thought crawfish super yummyful!!! first all server told frozen food didn't have  thats plus  know lot frozen crawfish cause cook home every little occasion   love BC n coming back try shrimps oysters n crabs  mmmm can't wait   um can't $5 99 lb crawfish!!!  half price H J! just hope its consistent price doesnt but probably when crawfish season   BON APPETIT! <EOR> I am Californian move vegas 1 year  when first time LV craving LA food none vegas them then heard BC r open  YAYY    am  happy    I last week hubby  food over all awesome pretty much same taste LA only diffrent sauce LA put little bit more it  place hugee     which better cos back LA always hav wait inline 30 60 minutes cos place way small  Talk service first all many server nothing  second r ANOYING!! why? lemme tell story  still ate time n server give check  its ok dont mind  am slower eater hubby finish first he waited me  meanwhile he looked aroud then he told server keep watching asume want pay bill first but pleaseee     just 9 PM n closed 10 am still eating  ignore it  but then keep coming table asked everything ok  more 2 server came asked maybe 30  minutes more 3 times came  still eating  OMG!!!! finally pay first still continue dinner  pay never come back but actually need another pen sign cos pen thet gave wasnt working  just talk eachoter start ignoring cos pay already  Vegas server suck  LA much much better  so 4 star food taste n quality but service only 1   water 25 cent? oh pleaseee     thats ridiculous  if choke pay 25 cent water??!!!! <EOR> Been 5 times 2 weeks  Sadly anytime off there's occasion friends BC place always recommend eat at  Especially since just opened quite few friends haven't tried yet   Ate friends birthday more enough room shockingly no wait 13 people  Unfortunately all local Filipinos everyone late  7 30 arrival time turned into 8 30  Those early wanted sit but wait half party seated  Needless say starving when seated   In mean time three marking wooden seats walls pen BC welcomes graffitti   When seated quickly drinks orders in  Fast friendly service  waitress patient all friends questions first time  She also able separate checks which always good large parties    Great thing large parties try dishes never tried before  samps cajun fries catfish  Woooot some guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud filet catfish! <EOR> Stopped see all hype about     We decided getting half dozen oysters  2 pounds shrimp  shabang sauce   oysters tasted watered down lacked briny flavor oyster and love Dungeness Crab but $14 99 TWO tank 168 Market which much better deal IMO    Honestly shrimp didn't taste any different serve competitors' place       +1 star though being able tag place magnum sharpie without having look po po     ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 Challenge 90 365 Crabs??? <EOR> This boils down pretty simple review  If you're fan Hot n Juicy Crawfish you'll fan Boiling Crab  premise exactly same  you order seafood 1 pound increments choose sauce type spice level comes plastic bag town  sauces named differently but just HnJ mixes everything together i e  The Whole Sha Bang  If there's thing BC over HnJ space much more well spacious  could probably fit more people BC both Vegas HnJ locations combined  Also minor thing but napkin dispensers BC better HnJ  when your digits covered sauce much easier grab napkin BC   One weird thing BC? charge 25c cup water  <EOR> I've never tried before but would still prefer hot n juicy's seasoning over theirs   we tuesday night wasn't even busy  Still waited maybe 10 minutes seated but drinks came right away  just thought service could've better because bunch different people coming table help didn't know ask more stuff  I actually liked clams whole sha bang sauce   other crawfish obviously frozen because season whatever   i still ate but flavor really weird  also snow crab legs blue crab 4 lbs shrimp  shrimp good everyone table tried it    Over all think sauce seasonings could've better  Thats only disappointment say it    <EOR> Yummerz!!! Boiling Crab favorite stop during trips L A  but hated 2 3 hour waiting time  glad BC finally opened Vegas!!! Always love 1lb  shrimps garlic spread whole Sha bang! mixture everything order different spice levels mines mild  Sweet potato fries good garlicky butter corn cob awesome if love garlic   try stay away crawfish crab stuff since items priced pound shrimp gives more meat your money rather shell weight    keen kids menu chicken fingers long chicken nuggets kind frozen section grocery store  long kids happy happy!  The wait excellent around 6 00pm service great! Food came quick servers top refills always asked if doing okay  cheaper HnJ Cravin Cajun per pound shrimp 8 99 vs  10 99 plus although shrimps bigger Cravin Cajun  atmosphere much more pleasant spacious parking no probz compared parking hell HnJ!   TV's everywhere appreciated sports fanatics time year!!! Overall great seafood joint gotta check out! Happy shelling!!!! <EOR> Food amazing     But service great! crab came which great but wait 15 mins someone bring utensils before could even dig in    wait least 5 10 more everything asked for     <EOR> Boiling Crab some good shrimp decent oysters   Oysters smallish side but shrimp nice plump!  newer seafood spots town Boiling Crab lets order seafood pound your choice sauce   Whole Sha Bang sauce which mix each individual sauce garlic cajun etc     sauce certainly garlicky but lacked delicious punch crave more heat   When comes restaurants all sauce sauce just alright me   As restaurant itself spacious littered small TV's   Lots seating available both tables booths   Walking nice overwhelmed smell special sauces probably due large space   During visit several large groups came no issue seating 20 people together   interesting thing noticed amount wait staff working   around 4 00pm 25 people working   Based amount customers time everybody could own individual server!  Overall Boiling Crab decent spot but sauce did win heart  <EOR> Shrimp good Hot n Juicy Crawfish HAJC but good quality Cravin' Cajun CC   did receive generous 19 shrimp per pound ordered though  Yes lined 'em trophies  sauce spicy but oddly buttery oily found myself dipping peeled shrimps back sauce  sad state affairs  Both HAJC CC redipping sauce all costs   The Snow Crab 14 99 lb extremely good quality reason alone keeping overall rating being 3 stars  Some plumpest sweetest biggest Snow Crab ever had  guess owners figure if people Vegas paying $25 elsewhere eat all u can eat snow crab paying 14 99 lb better some top tier crab  Interesting note Snow Crab order actually 0 9lb lunch receipt only charged 13 00 crab received  Pretty cool   A ton LCD tvs space BUT NONE them HD channels ended leaving game's halftime when probably would hung longer if HD channels  tvs plentiful but all kind small 37 40 ? restaurant space big found myself squinting keep eye football times  If sprung 46 50 tvs would made BIG difference  classic case quality vs  quantity   Service really good  place seems well managed  Unfortunately buttery oily sauce wasn't style  sure people love way  Definitely give try may you  stick CC HAJC bag cajun seafood fix!  Sauce note if just 'ragin' cajun' sauce comes uniform molé sauce no garlic bits  No fun  If add 'garlic spread' sauce improves but then comes buttery oily  Maybe doing 'whole shebang' adding lemon pepper cuts some but didn't try it  full second order  <EOR> Laugh if but when arrive joint heavy crustaceans am headed straight fried section! must Southern me  environment nice enough plenty TVs viewable right tables even if quality signal isn't crystal clear  Service pronto  don't think water glasses fell below half which good given costs ya quarter! However fried shrimp basket simply great  shrimp tad overfried appeared different quality ones served bags  smaller  did finish every last cajun fries  think addicted spice  Overall if husband demands bag crustaceans probably top choice tag along although he enjoyed food don't think he missing saucy critters much he might miss some others  <EOR> So being DMVer when brother suggested boiling crab best blue crabs hesitantly went   it's almost asking West Coaster Five Guys best burger ever   When found several things interesting 1  First bib you   Yes bib but they'll put you   thought novel until pair boobs mashed into back head forced pretend due sour face wife making   2  place wide open   eating crab feast   Only restaurant prices   3  Everything comes bag   No dishes   Just bags your food it   So those interesting parts   parts didn't like 1  ran Dungeness crabs   Um you're called boiling crab   expect crabs if your name indicates you're crab joint   2  When selling blue crabs sell weight   bushel used to   3  loud between TV noise other diners could barely chalk restaurant experience   So wouldn't back if help it   course admit am bit crab snob since being near Chesapeake crabs when want quantity want all drenched Old Bay   combination sauce bad but liked better shrimp crabs themselves   C'est la vie  <EOR> Always friendly staffs fast service!  day sister's birthday  always Shrimps *Whole Sha Bang sauce medium hot  spiciness just right mild hot  sausages pretty good   regular fries not cajun fries also outstanding!  always bring left overs house eat rice very next day   good day before    My only complaint second visit much sauce bag comparing previously   think enjoy having 1pound shrimps Boiling Crab even though smell garlic all day LOL My sister wants take freeze bring Korea husband    asked good? she replied sure 'll craving shrimps more missing you!!! <EOR> This BC far BEST BC is! all because SIZE!
