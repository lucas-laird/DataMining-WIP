So reason didn't give 5 stars because price  two beers salad simple pizza dessert  think bill came around $50 incl 20% gratuity    probably least $10 $15 more would spent Settebello the only other pizza restaurant town worth going to   But Settebello salads much much larger think pizzas may well  money say Settebello clear winner point  Lucky Due Forni live side town!!! <EOR> I first time Friday night boyfriend friend   2 beers 2 glasses wine mozarella salad pizza $74   price point high taste   The place cool vibe   sat outside under heat lamps laugh over bright orange plastic chairs which reminded all chairs elementary school   dark wood which many people find modern straight late 60s early 70s especially burnt orange chairs   aunt's fridge same exact color   The service awesome would expect new restaurant   Everyone VERY knowledgeable helpful which greatly appreciated   We split panzanella salad which fine but certainly spectacular  did all appreciate freshness ingredients     We then split classica mozarella bar artichoke hearts   mozarella good artichoke hearts completely underwhelming   quantity them sad sad sad very lightly seasoned to put mildly found bland  Last pizza   Prosciutto e Rucola Neopolitan crust recommended server   crust perfect blend crunchy chewy prosciutto plentiful flavor well pretty bland   little smoked mozarella don't think even bite slice     We contemplated desserts but only 3 choices none them all appealing decided against it     We kinda bummed lack luster performance frequently walk Rachel's breakfast lunch Hokkaido dinner excited cool place hang eat some tasty food   But reality price mediocre food don't see going again any time soon     I much prefer going Nora's Flamingo Jones salad pizza wine   food superior don't leave hungry  <EOR> Really cute restaurant Town Center near 215   Nice décor   server really enthusiastic point did ode sea salt cannot justice     We tricolore salad $9 95 which very light refreshing   believe added some pears salad which nice   also tried mozzarella bar $10 95 where pick mozzarella side   three different kinds classica anchovies side   Don't anchovies unless serious anchovies   The great thing place two different types pizza which rare gourmet pizza restaurants   pizza ovens both Roma Neapolitan   Figure which before go   Roma thinner crust kind Grimaldi's but greasy   Neapolitan thicker crust Settebello   prefer Grimaldi's Roma Due Forni pizza $15 95 really really good!  comes tomato mozzarella sausage bacon pequillo peppers which roasted red peppers   mozzarella good slightly smoky flavor bacon sausage delicious   They offer Moretti tap $5 95 glass good variety bottled beers   also offer all wines glass enomatic machine behind bar   red wine served warm think enomatic machines reserved more expensive wines   Some wines cost $50 glass   Educated Guess Cabernet $13 95 glass Suri Barbera $11 95    Very good wines but just wish served right temperature slightly cool   The dessert menu pretty cool see pic chocolate pizza would try   tiramisu gelato very delicious   They open until 11pm weekends which pretty late Summerlin   usually don't until 9pm eat nice eat somewhere isn't trying close while eating   I'm happy place opened Summerlin can't wait come back! <EOR> We twice  Food really tasty but menu very limited  Also wine waaaaay overpriced!!!

We couldnt choose dessert pick orderd chocolate pizza sweet ricotta  Amazing both!!! pizza same thick crust high quality choco poured over wht strawberries almonds dollop vanilla gelato  sweet ricotta sweet though thick honey poured over sprinkled chopped pistachios  cant wait back!!! <EOR> This higher quality dining experience everything smoothly  food predictably good  ordered tartufo due forni pizza  thicker crust server suggested did thicker tartufo but since first time thin due forni pizza wish not  also another comment due forni flavorful tartufo   server upsold sweet bufala riccota dessert honey pistachios turn ordered americanos  See am saying? All around smooth pleasant dining experience  didn't try any wines maybe why opinion Even though everything great don't see myself coming back long time  maybe minimal menu does excite past tartufo  <EOR> So preface fact don't eat undercooked eggs  fact fear them can't even watch people eat egg goo   sure missing part magic restaurant ordering egg goo pizza perhaps would 5 star review if egg goo thing    The decor place awesome chic clean modern  Service quick polite  ate lunch break appreciate good service when trying dine quickly    We settled gnocchi prosciutto pizza   gnocchi wasn't dense most gnocchi used but utterly fabulous  bacon divine peas light sauce perfect  YUM    The pizza pretty damn good but Settebello FAR better  crust very similar but found cheese topping ratio Due off  didn't really taste any cheese but pizza covered tons tons proscuitto salad  say ounce ounce you're getting ton more meat pizza but obnoxiously huge pieces impossible eat without cutting  But then cutting meat ended making entire pizza fall apart  Settebello just holds together better  Also love Carbonara pizza Settebello featuring FULLY COOKED and goo free egg!   Additionally prices Settebello much better  felt eating good pizza dough tons meat salad here  balsalmic tasty but just added meat salad feeling getting  Truffle oil more cheese would served pizza well !   I love Italian style pies pleased another option Vegas  Don't miss fabulous pasta place many exciting options besides pizza ! <EOR> First all say since neighborhood bistro opened February once weekly   if more time would more often   and then become fixture    Alex andBobby incredible   food beyond fabulous creative but complicated intimidating   Great wines both price point selection giving diners choice Reserve wines less expensive experience  need both accomplished that   table 10 ladies last night accomodated giving choice sit inside terrace like outdoor area   Pizzas Wine Appetizers accomodating Vegan guest group great  Alex Bobby visited table checked sure wanting nothing Chelsea teh sweetest incredibly professional yet easy going   wait staff general great  never anything but stellar experience whenever am there   Salads coffee wine pizzas carpaccio whatever your tastes all around neighborhood bistro lacking little Summerlin area   Go!!! <EOR> A very pricey pizza place   said before another review hard time paying lot Italian food place expensive   paid over $50 pizza smallish side app 2 drinks   pizza place $50?!?  Drinks full but limited bar   husband wanted Jack Coke but don't carry Jack   He ended getting Bulliet Coke which came very tiny glass   Even though tiny pretty strong pour gotta give them that   very nice glass wine around $11 bad   Food Beef carpaccio app   rolled sushi roll meat sliced thicker other carpaccio could really taste meat   very much enjoyed it   ordered Due Forni pizza   $16 little dismayed small size when it   More dismayed when started eating hardly any toppings lot dough    some expensive bare pizza   Service Overbearing!  moment walked two people greeting plastered smiles both sides restaurant   When seated guy think manager came over talked forever every menu item ingredients each one   Let look menu if questions ask thankyouverymuch   But kicker when husband's drink finished   3 different people asked if he wanted refill literally within 30 seconds   many hands cookie jar if ask me   waitress also very pushy when declined dessert kept insisting try something   I think I'd come sit bar some drinks but wouldn't spend much money pizza again  <EOR> This new Summerlin pizza joint some great potential  Keyword potential   nice concept two ovens dishing pizzas ways encourages little experimentation  decor hip but comfortable  Its cozy end social other    We tried array fresh mozzarella tomatoes basil prosciutto  Delicious taste texture  ordered couple pizzas could taste different crusts cooking methods  All in all pretty good  little salt helped center pizzas soggy but still pretty good  really blew wine  offer nice selection but when ordering glass stingy the price really disappointing  Customer service good but there's just way much information going pizza opinion  Regardless good addition  <EOR> Grimaldi's still favorite pizza town but Due Forni solid second   The customer service excellent!  recently branched outside usual Grimaldi's Eastern 215 tried Rainbow 215 Grimaldi's location   customer service terrible welcome occurrence everyone Due Forni way sure friend taken care of   No doubt dead Sunday lunchtime but still much appreciated   My friend started Due Forni caprese   incredible   Please see photo if don't believe me   Buffalo mozzarella tomatoes spicy sopressata   Great flavor just enough spice   Mozzarella fresh yum   My friend split bottle wine Nero d'Avola   Good wine particuarly $32 price tag   She ordered Margherita pizza ordered Picante   both chose neopolitan style  Two choices crust chewy crispy    never tried sopressata before but apparently huge fan   picante pizza also contained spicy meat loved it!  Very good pizza spicy kick     Would definitely return Due Forni when want change Grimaldi's  <EOR> This place excellent   Many reviews mentioned high price but quality ingredients warrants it   mozzarella tomato sauce pizzas awesome primary food groups since birth think some authority matter    truffle pizza must try very unique incredibly delicious   definitely favorite pizza town  <EOR>
