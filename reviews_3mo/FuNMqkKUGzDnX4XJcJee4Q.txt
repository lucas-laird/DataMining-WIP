I love Cugino's Maryland parkway when heard there's North Decatur 215 excited  NAME TITLE Pizzeria First deli Maryland don't come buy your sauces noodles fresh meats  No Donnie special We ordered meat lovers meatball parm  Both delicious  Cugino's only deals pizzas calzones few sandwiches  No appetizers pasta dishes full dinner lunch meals no lasagna ziti etc   Food= delish Service=above beyond Prices=great Selection=I wanted Donnie Special Sandwich but hey do   I come again again   think bleed marinara <EOR> My family ate first and last time week ago  expecting great pizza based another review Yelp  Instead discovered pizza very bland prices ridiculous  wife thin crust pizza thick crust Sicilian pizza  charged $4 add pepperoni olives two slices pizza! Almost much slices themselves cost  wife asked garlic knot bread told she could sample lunch but sample when food arrived  top all off pizza mediocre very bland sauce tasted came can  If fan terrible pizza such Domino's Little Caesar's place might right your alley  If fan good pizza look elsewhere  <EOR> It's bad but great either     Basically if crust doesn't wooo am just gonna call place ok  white pizza clams   pizza did very generous portion clams flavor good   crust average crust    just okay   This place worth while slice pie    but top ten list  <EOR>
