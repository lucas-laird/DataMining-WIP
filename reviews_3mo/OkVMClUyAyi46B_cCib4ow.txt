This hidden off Strip treasure  Frutti di Mare best renditions ever tasted though fluctuates bit spectacular just very good  But hit spectacular more often not   Ahi Elchico another standout  eat often  bring town guests often  Lunch bargain  bread waste time only thing consistently disappoints here  But still   highly recommended prices very reasonable  <EOR>
