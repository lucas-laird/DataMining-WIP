The restaurant looks amazing but besides didn't wow food nor did service   I usually expect alot when dine more upscale restaurants Vegas when regular buffet 24 hour cafes   food par maybe because live Chinese part LA tasted way better dim sum Chinese cuisine  Service yes nice but none ordinary   They actually opened bottles Fiji water expected pour ourselves  wasn't happy that   I wouldn't say place horrible  But guess if really craving Chinese Vegas would suitable hold little bit longer until your favorite  <EOR> High end chinese food glamorous setting   Goose liver awesome duck tongue good   Drunken chicken ok   more but memory fails me   Service impeccable private room all ourselves   guess unfair judge when friends VIPs though  <EOR>
