We hungry hoofing hurry back Bally's Price Right show decided grab quick bite spot way  place follows Chipotle concept pick burrito tacos burrito bowl meat then stack rice salsa veggies  prices reasonable service quick friendly  only open 2 days but seems prime location brings them good amount patrons  food okay compared Chipotle  carne asada good shredded beef ok chicken little bland  liked mild corn salsa  advantage place over Chipotle shrimp for $1 more   <EOR> Went through some friends before show down street  Grabbed some tacos burritos nachos could try little bit everything! Let's just say price location service    strip even ?? 6 STARS!! Great food friendly Rockin' atmosphere! They play great Rock N Roll music keeps moving enjoy food <EOR> Awful service  Indian couple front treated extremely poorly talked down rudely when asked vegetarian beans instead black  beans When ordered food gave literal scraps left pan maybe 7 pieces dice chicken half spoon rice food maybe took quarter bowl ordered chicken bowl ridiculous  also treated poorly girl rolled eyes when asked if could more meat told she would charge double meat joke didn't even half spoonful meat  literally walked just couldnt justify paying such crap terrible service  earl sandwich same price way better food service  DON'T EAT ROCKIN TACO  <EOR> This perfect starter snack late night stop you've partying all night  even sure if Rocking Taco even closes?!  The chips freshly made guacamole spicy salsa definitely best snack meal around  killer Blue Lemonade Margaritas die for    We definitely made few stops drinks more guac! <EOR> Very rarely ever [EVER] multiple stops place within span 5 days   first drink vacation along Chips guaca Holy mole   Seriously though guacamole some best ever had   Blue Lemonade margaritas being able sample different ones which amazing choice   second visit recommended other tourists pleased well   This place set bar Margaritas Vegas   No other place touched them   almost unfair others since first        and multiple days!!!    Cheers <EOR> Rockin' Taco does waste any food because chips extremely stale  Everything else good though  <EOR> Good quality food very reasonable prices  Would loved quacamole burrito but wanted $2 95 extra it  music great listen while eating  Very good inexpensive place eat  Glad stumbled upon it  <EOR>
