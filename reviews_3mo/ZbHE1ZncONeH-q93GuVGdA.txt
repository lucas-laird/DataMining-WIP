Looking some late night grub stumbled across taco shop chain Blue Diamond   employees seem little tired lifeless but expect 24 hour joint!  Regardless content meal great morning sleep   Out all items ordered least favorite   even though devoured whole thing   was taco de lengua   Tongue lacked some flavor wasn't tender enough  taco bigger in size cost used to      Their chicken taco crunchy shell lot better    with peppery taste loads cheese   Horchata just okay me   I better   But why complain when Mexican drinks bottomless other fountain drinks!?  My favorite Carne Asada nachos mountain flavorful asada cheese cilantro tomatoes guacamole beans we opted no sour cream    good and greasy ended ordering another mountain go     Up next    Carne Asada Fries! <EOR> Great food  carne asada burrito 3 roll tacos   <EOR> Clean friendly staff huge portions  best Mexican food but hits spot when craving  always tell myself only going eat half save rest another meal  never works  always stuff face till all gone  stuff addictive  <EOR>
