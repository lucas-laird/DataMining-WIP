I just exited freeway big sign facing street Filipino Food! Great timing decided stop by   Restaurant roomy staff very nice  place new opened week ago  did inform another location much smaller   My order Lechon Kawali Flavorful skin great fatty  Sinigang na pork Soup wasn't sour traditionally meat tender but did satisfy  Overall bad   try pancit adobo next time around just cause its actual name store! <EOR> Great place! Highly recommended those love Filipino food those looking try something new  <EOR>
