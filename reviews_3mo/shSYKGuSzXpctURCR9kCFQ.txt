So family really excited place open really wanted place next Filipino restaurant Unfortunately usual spot us  ordered lumpia Shanghai dinuguan chicharron bulak pork bbq stick pancit Bam i   The bbq stick pancit both delicious  However when placed order lumpia asked many pieces order  told twelve  When mom picked order showed ordered she counted 9  excuse because pieces cut big  mom didn't bother say anything  But excuse if lumpia cut into twelve pieces would only bite lumpias  Regardless should excuse  Next chicharron bulaklak asked extra crispy  crumbs maybe 5 small pieces soggy chicharron soaked oil   The dinuguan wasn't bad but wasn't great either  With amount paid amount food received could gotten lot more better quality another Filipino restaurant frequent  <EOR> Its alright place cashier kinda loud server really slow  ordered inasal na chicken alright taste nothing exciting  Then friend ordered tapsilog its ight too  eggroll kinda taste its burned  desert leche flan small  <EOR> Worst service     dont know take order   Rude waiter   never gonna back place  <EOR> DT's look may some competition  Keep mind now there's only 2 Filipino resturants southwest location  revisit Cebu Inasal enough tries update both reviews DT's  Due lack other Filipino resturants area i'd probably give Cebu Inasal 4 5 stars if could   The Inasal Chicken BBQ inasal na monak delicious!!! going try pork next time  herbal type bbq flavor   The BBQ pork stick delicious tiny bit sweeter Inasal chicken above   The kare kare could used more peanut flavor but sure if traditionally less peanut y   The Buko Pandan decent first time trying dessert   While eating bunch staff came kitchen  definitely looked all Filipinos  am Filipino myself can't tell if food traditional but delicious!  Out 5 rating Friendly staff = 5 Flavor = 4 Decor music tv = 3 5 Cleaniness = 4 <EOR> I love place  great food Dinuguan wonderful  use love Red Ribbon our's but since don't serve anymore next best place it  Lumpiang Shanghai lumpia great small but great share  Calamari AMAZING! don't eat Calamari but every once while expand taste buds glad did  Great quick date family lunch dinner  Highly recommend try  thing wasn't crazy Inasal Na Manok chicken stick little sweet but rest family liked it  <EOR> Pretty good filipino food dont wait 45mins your food  craving lechon place it! skin crispy meat juicy tasty  Chicken inasal very good 5yo almost finished whole meal  Service very friendly knowledgeable  back  <EOR> The food delicious nice presentation restaurant spacious clean  Buko pandan fav! customer service each individual most genuine polite welcoming experienced  Left satisfied tummy smile face!

Sause awesome!!! Coming back soon!!! <EOR> I've quiet sometime already  Stopped myself reviewing first time but now know right exact time  Giving 2 star some facts  Needs improvement    Serving food? Waiting time? WORST! if hungry prepare yourself wait least 20 30mins ur food soon u ordered  may say ready   Customer service plus which gives feeling Home least  Look Marilou  superb server  thing am bothered servers always kept saying pasensya na po sorry even simple things which understand sometime yet necessary    Hostess accommodation upon entering? Negative rate  per sign says wait hostess seated yet no actually direct u your seat  So seat where ever please One factor check your bags if all food won't waste gas coming all way south  <EOR> Another Filipino place chow down place tidy service nothing brag finally food adequate nothing exemplary!  pork Sisig underwhelming over crispy  greasy!  Bangus Sisig better if lacking flavor   Bami pancit little bland no distinct flavor either! Kare Kare lacks peanut taste noticeable curds cornstarch ! <EOR> Menu limited  sauces watered down  prices bit expensive compared DT's  Sorry but can't help but compare since far each other  chicken Inasal portion small price  Kinda eating jollibee chicken small compared KFC   lechon good either  Probably fresh when served coz crunchy <EOR> Had give try since neighborhood but say probably won't back anytime soon   would order BBQ sticks tasty   husband tapsilog which okay but portion bigger DT's down street why plus bigger menu selection   The main reason am fan because while going order noodles waitress asked if wanted lechon which specialty gave try instead cause doesn't love lechon! I'd say worst lechon ever had!  served banana leaf rice which nice touch but oily rice soaked much oil   couldn't even eat skin  Normally crispy even hard but still good but theirs way hard rubbery chewy   I know new starting maybe better future  <EOR> Went yesterday lunch  food alright scale 1 10 would give 6  If craving some tapsilog such its place go  serving kind small specially desert which small coned cup ice cream $4  buy half gallon ice cream amount already   service slow though   It took 30 minutes until food table  saw some people eventually left place due time waited  <EOR> Service fast but kitchen slow  took full hour plate Pancit  Parties four seated served food many times before dish came out  <EOR> I am Filipino but am very familiar Filipino foods Filipino restaurants  place looks really nice server great  Unfortunately down hill that    Of course try lechon baboy Cebu style because Asawa Cebu  regular order comes rice $10 99 order 1lb lechon $15 99 without rice  decided order regular order rice Caldereta  waitress told Caldereta doesn't come rice  Anu ba yan!
