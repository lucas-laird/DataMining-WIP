Can't wait again try something else  <EOR> First good  decor layout restaurant  seemed clean well thought out   Now not so goods food WAY over top spicy  New Mexican food before loved it  Using various chilies enhance flavor traditional Mexican dishes brilliant thing when done well  case Chile Addiction don't think cook knows difference between flavor just plain over spicing  add insult food hot no longer taste other ingredients when wife asked server chicken dish prepared prior ordering response Ummm     well    kind braised    umm     know which didn't really mean much  Being Mexican descent wife eats super spicy food pretty regularly she couldn't finish meal either  Anyway party five only finished meal even she said she could only taste chili peppers black ground pepper  Why would anyone want eat enchiladas chimichangas where can't taste meat cheese other ingredients??  Also Spanish Rice soft mushy refried beans goopy stiff if can  Darn it! really wanted place  <EOR> I liked menu plenty options  hadn't tried 'New Mexico' cuisine but really liked lot roasted chili flavors  Great tortillas!   No alcohol probably waiting liquor license  <EOR> My family originally New Mexico grew stacked enchiladas sopaipillas posole  When heard Chile Addiction opened southwest side town excited give them try    I thoroughly impressed food service  impressed ended coming back once but two more times   I tried stacked enchiladas pork verde posole stuffed enchiladas pork verde chile adovado huevos rancheros sopaipillas tamales breakfast burrito churros fried ice cream  Every single thing tried great definitely nostalgia factor going it   The service beyond wonderful  servers owners friendly welcoming sure refills plentiful  They've even offered free dessert apology food taking long  funny thing didn't even notice delay but insisted order dessert them   I plan making regular spot hope others take time experience regional cuisine holds special place heart  Just skip desserts good  <EOR> Family owned colorful thoughtful décor just when first walk door! Service even simple takeout order friendly made menu suggestions even tossed some extra sopapillas  Menu all your southwestern favorites both red green chile   The green chili stew thick well spiced packed potatoes but only few bits pork  Good flavor dish good price which included accompanying tortillas  also added chile relleno both red green sauce la carte section but found soggy overbattered  sauces point though  Bring your hankie because your eyes tearing heat   However fan gimmicky drug 420 references all over menu referring breakfast burrito blunt example? find tacky poor taste unless your target audience high school teenagers  Bonus points offering Yelp check in offer free dessert purchase  <EOR> Finally good mexican restaurant Summerlin!  happy didn't try all other failed mexican restaurants did around trying fancy weird dishes offerings     The blue corn chicken enchiladas green sauce spot calieñte   great stuff!  Knew place gonna good soon dug into salsa  refried beans arroz perfectly seasoned  Ordered tacos la carte   disappointed chef using pre made taco shells   c 'mon man!  fillings salsa yummy saved it   make shells hand   customers appreciate more     Going back lunch week! <EOR> This place just home!

Warm Christmas chips table mild medium house made salsa  Pork adovada fall apart rich saucy  Guacamole bright green take its traditional cilantro salty laden mix  Posole thicker more stew but nevertheless tasty  Tamales enchiladas decent but everything standout sauces  green sauce hasn't blended chunks chile red sauce smooth developed spice without being burn mouth hot quite frankly   addicting!  Sopapillas airy fresh greasy   Best fried ice cream outside still warm extra crispy while ice cream *gasp* still cold!   I'm nor New Mexico  But enjoying Mexican cuisine 20 years consider myself motivated foodie different refreshing spin highly recommend! <EOR> New Mexico style Mexican food?!? never needs there! went  Bright eyed bushy tailed declaring food adventure  Especially seeing place highly rated Yelp    again don't believe hype   This major food fail most part  First foremost took 10 minutes someone come say hi take drink order  Chips salsa arrived shortly after  salsa bit spicy which liked but dad sister don't spicy only quick taste before tapping out   I ordered cup Pozole  delicious heavy hominy which mama likes presented large bowl tasted homemade    My little sister ordered carne asada burrito refried beans rice  stacked enchiladas carne adovada calabacitas whole pinto beans  dad opted combo beef enchilada chile rellano carne asada taco  also side sopapillas which weren't touched  When order came dad's taco MIA  taco appeared 20 minutes later declined offered let take home did left overs   So let's talk food  bland kind boring  expecting more exciting flavors! New flavors but everything fell flat  only stand dish dinner Chile Rellano  dankest dank probably best ever but Chile Rellano does 5 star review make   Thanks Yelp free fried ice cream looked over check  Fried ice cream great but wasn't anything hadn't before   Chile Addiction didn't leave even craving much remember them by  really wanted place  really want little independent places it! really root underdog! just can't give them more 2stars  Poor service less mediocre food  chopping rookie mistakes  venture back but very under whelmed that's opposite overwhelmed right?   <EOR> There's something green chilies   could smother car bumper roasted green chilies would good   This place doesn't serve car bumpers serves best New Mexico cuisine four state area   Don't looking Tex Mex Mexican   you'll find only freshest ingredients creating freshest most flavorful meals town   I chile rellenos incredible   Nothing less best freshest town   I'll see all probably next week  <EOR> I love New Mexican food born raised Albuquerque  Now living Las Vegas excited try Chile addiction nice place decor clean  referred another New Mexican but  must say food bad very bland   ordered stacked enchiladas ground beef side whole pinto beans rice  rice tasted ketchup rice no spice very bland  Enchilada very little cheese beans tasteless ground beef  green chili sauce clumped some peppers still outer peeling   raised only assume cook does taste food being prepared? No seasonings add salt just choke down! egg top tasted carton real egg? I hoping owner Amy would some feedback suggested chef performing task quality food offered some suggestions  would see them succeed new business but she very put off comments  She replied interpretation New Mexico food  Owner Amy closed minded pompous  WRONG attitude food really bad! suggested she couple grandmothers New Mexico right come even remotely close Garduno's Padilla's El Pinto's Albuquerque  response chef very successful chef worked many fine restaurants  If chef any good would show food  never write YELP reviews but lady asked attitude   feel Chef should spend some more time cooking school learning basics seasoning getting New Mexico recipes Google? If he tasting dishes he palate problem he should should spend some time Albuquerque tasting real New Mexico food! art would worth investment New Mexicans know good New Mexican food amateur best  My suggestion worth save your money disappointed  am still quest find good New Mexico food Las Vegas definitely it  wish them luck going back sad say   Consider yourself warned food sucks  Sorry but Carlito's still beats Chile Addiction taste   Sooo end positive note new server Megan awesome! <EOR> LOVE PLACE!
