Got recommendation friend place great stop pizza salad   Definitely did disappoint!  Sammy's offers some great menu items all look tempting both description plate   yet see bad looking plate come kitchen always see new items try just watching other people's orders come out   So far wife twice ordered Pizza Salad which works perfectly 2 people   pizza name figured can't wrong order but salads just good if better!  For pizza done BBQ Chicken Thai Chicken Pizza TCP    say find BBQ better tasting pizza   funny taste TCP just couldn't put finger on   spice but wasn't traditional tasting TCP    However BBQ Chicken right target   both pizzas thing constant great tasting crust   Light flavorful great compliment fresh ingredients   As salad tried Chinese Chicken Thai Chicken   Both hit spot   Unlike pizza Thai Chicken Salad perfect   Great taste traditional flavor just all around good   Chinese Chicken just good   Both refreshing filling instant favorites   All around can't complain visits list top lunch places Vegas   wait staff quick friendly restaurant environment stylish comfortable   back more soon! <EOR> If large volume bland generic food then your place  If flavors other fat sickly sweet creamy steer clear!    I craving traditional Italian pizza  Since place just down road decided give try  hubbie coconut shrimp skewers which deep fried beyond recognition came side citrus flavored high fructose corn syrup  then shared pizza which small spoonful sauce center oddly sweet flat bread type thing which no way resembled pizza base came slathered oil ick!
