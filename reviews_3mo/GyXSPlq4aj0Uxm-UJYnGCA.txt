Just your typical little hole wall Mom Pop restaurant excellent Mexican Food     Wasn't sure would good opted try three different types Meat tacos     Beef Pork not BBQ kind Pollo   YUM! Let just say this  pieces meat small filled entire soft corn tortilla shells perfectly   little dinky corn tortillas you'd find LA medium sized ones if you're would probably enough 3 would plenty big hungry boy   I   took bite each kind without seasoning them added lime tomato salsa avocado later    far hands down Beef favorite meat  most flavor three cooked perfectly   pork came second chicken third least flavor    Beef definitely won landslide seasoning only helped even more     The home made chips little thick if catch yourself eating them while you're waiting your meal may room when gets there     The Horchata PERFECT! Some places cinnamon rice drink entirely sweet   guy must love stuff because best ever tasted lot Horchata!  The rice beans nothing write home unfortunately  high hopes them friend bragged much he loved Mexican restaurant   beans little dry certainly refried  rice fine but beans just didn't help it   Would loved little more moisture little more flavor here   But overall everything great!    The prices VERY reasonable even if choose something you're huge fan won't feel you're wasting ton money     NYC's over priced horrible Mexican food just appreciate place even more   Kudos Taqueria originally Santa Cruz bringing business locals Vegas   Date Rating 1 Pick Scale 1  Strong Suggestions Just order Take grab quick bite when you're running errand   place formal dinner party but enjoy food  <EOR>
