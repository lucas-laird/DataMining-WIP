I actually think place deserves 3 5 stars overall  food itself deserves 4 stars but few things way overall 4 star experience  menu lots items but no description any them rely server descriptions  server able answer questions menu  Strangely no drinks all menu no separate drink menu but serve basic sodas some beers  don't know anything else because again no drink menu  decor OK would much improved if replaced laminate topped tables real wood pulled 2 seater tables away wall  Nobody wants eat against wall all scrunched that  Interestingly restaurant directly connected kitchen  think must share kitchen restaurant next door Stewart + Ogden  didn't cause any problems anything just unusual  food good  ordered kung pao chicken not spicy described flavor good  husband liked mongolian beef son loved potstickers  We'll probably back least takeout  <EOR> This place reminds quote Dad know you're favorite son Son Dad your only son   This place  actually pretty good chinese but    it's really only chinese place think downtown  I think Thai Japanese even Vietnamese but legitimate Chinese   Now am going compare anything Spring Mountain just know if satisfied  actually places short list right now if someone wants know where eat downtown   Now can't rate service because take but food strawberry sweet sour chicken fried rice shrimp egg black peppered pork all gone 10 minutes time sat down provide food mini gluttonous army  better restaurants downtown quick sit down  <EOR> I am saddened say sorely disappointed  imagine going back here  food very blah  Nothing stood soup dumplings soupy  It all very average best   I love property the Downtown Grand seem trying Pizza Rock Triple George both excellent but really missed mark  Too bad <EOR> My boyfriend looking somewhere eat somewhere close filling  Although appearance casino floor less inviting a screen other barrier would help eliminate closet look food spectacular  sat booth quickly felt removed casino although could still hear odd mix music  ordered 7 spices calamari appetizer  No breading  Rich melt in your mouth deliciousness  Main dishes scallop black bean sauce broccoli seafood chow mein crispy noodles  Both dishes provided perfectly cooked seafood  No rubber eraser scallops here! Service exceptional too  would come back Grand hotel just eat here  Seriously  <EOR> The food good fancier something you'd Spring Mountain but necessarily better especially prices they're charging  flavors seemed authentic enough    I ordered steamed tofu fish  plate came hot but oddly fish lukewarm tofu underneath cold  waiter took back apparently just reheated same dish instead making over  result fish perfectly cooked when came first time although everything warmer  Granted perfectly steamed fish easy thing but if menu assume know they're doing   flavor quality fish good just wish execution better    We also pot stickers lettuce wrap vegetable fried rice  All good though number lettuce leaves few   The service great  waiter efficient friendly    I want place succeed  basically only real Chinese restaurant within walking distance    I should mention if you're local eat 50% off though don't know if  temporary promotion  <EOR> If looking reheated frozen food terrible atmosphere then head down Red Mansion  guess most Chinese restaurants use froZen stuff but if going eat junk spend $50 less eat Panda Express  really need pay $50 more privilege eat under spot lights full blast restaurant where manager employees talk laugh ask them to Dim lamps  No thanks! <EOR> I actually amazed great food was!  share Chinese food   Each dish ordered see attached pix very satisfying individually delicious! actually very fresh didn't taste alike   some Chinese restaurants do   Even mom impressed she's picky eater! service top notch  Very alert very accommodating very friendly!  definitely coming back dine here!  50% off any restaurants inside Downtown Grand month January?  can't that!
