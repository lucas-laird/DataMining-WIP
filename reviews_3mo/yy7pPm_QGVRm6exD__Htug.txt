Furthermore very disjointed buffet offering sambar without idli dosa? mint chutney tamarind chutney without samosa chaat?  Come on!  give facade bounty but incomplete   know better but undermine true Indian Buffet fans order cut costs  ton Indian buffets better same price most around you   While commonly happens most buffets seem every gravy dish    all good stuff gone seemed once finished finished  Yet coming 1 PM buffet 11 30 3 00 pm   I expect replenished but didn't see happen 45 minutes there     Understandably dishes mild but should some hot sauce condiment offered   I didn't see any but also never asked any     Out all dishes tandoori chicken best remained juicy yet still underseasoned DEFINITELY cooked tandoori   One more promising things restaurant atmosphere nice date most importantly service way above par most Indian restaurants   as Indian rare treated well non Indian customers   water glasses never less half full appropriately checked time time without fussing discriminating  <EOR> Came lunch buffet $11 left satisfied   place moderately busy nice selection usual buffet selections   weren't many veggie options would liked but options offered all pretty fresh overspiced   server nicely attentive unobtrusive refilling water glasses smile   place served welcome oasis begin new school year  <EOR> Within four mile radius university plethora Indian restaurants  India Masala another add mix but tends fall short compared others  serve lunch buffet 11 30 3 00 $10 99    Price wise similar all others  Where falls flat offerings  IM offers variety dishes often seen other places  vegetable korma primary example point  enjoyed most  well seasoned mix mushrooms potatoes mango chutney gave balanced taste sweet savory  rice chicken biryani also decious  soft pillowy flavorful  scooped around dried chicken pieces tandoori instead  Most time best pass tandoori because just sits loses all moisture  theirs  Instead found tender moist  Other those three dishes impressed   The service other hand polite friendly  decorum spacious warm  much potential hope see them tweak menu bit more  wouls come dinner just order ala carte  <EOR> It's time found truly good indian restaurant Las Vegas  chicken tikka masala delicious when paired perfectly cooked garlic naan  Slightly crispy well soft chewy  Tried goat curry which nice earthy  date thought some parts meat tendony but surmised because when cooking such unusual meat probably used most parts animal    My only true complaint waiter pretty much forgot take order no else came table long time  only 3 other tables being served time! didn't eat til 40 minutes time sat down  willing forgive hopefully one time incident because surprisingly good food  treated spectacle family sized dosa being served next table  huge!
