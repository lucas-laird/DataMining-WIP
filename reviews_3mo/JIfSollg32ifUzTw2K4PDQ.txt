Shout Nelson Q introduction   If you're big fan street tacos then check place   Al Pastor w pineapple remind much El Gordos's Adobada Tacos but instead slightly larger tortilla more meat better hot sauce cheaper $1 50 pop    also  pineapple chunks lot smaller because each bite more balance     Things need improve The quesadilla cheese need melted   first bite could still see shredded mozzarella inside   Would better if use Oaxaca cheese something  The tortilla tacos need some work   Put some oil those babies something  They condiment bar side which could good thing bad thing   think would nice if cooks handled onions cilantro part but  just nitpicking   The lot crowded when park across street   think location stand great because all foot traffic receive but doesn't feel all sunny if know mean     So ever since encounter having mixed cravings between stand Taco El Gordos    saying lot mi amigo  <EOR> Yum Yum Yum Yum              am southern California lived San Francisco before Las Vegas fortunate enough eaten lots amazing street food    Since moved  1 1 2 years ago searching great street tacos finally found them   Al Pastor any before all 3 salsa's delicious keep alternating try each tacos   fantastic never disappointed Al Pastor   can't wait pass hot spot all foodie friends   sure back! <EOR>
