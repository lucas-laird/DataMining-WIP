I Big Wong cannot lie  strangely named restaurant just opened today  If happen catch review soon enough drop free entree purchase $1 soda bottled water  dine in only valid through May 18   I stopped lunch ordered Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice  dish normally costs $4 95 but free $1 ginger ale  it? actually very good  $4 95 great deal  free steal!  Everything menu $4 95 item coming $3 95  You'd think looking lunch menu but no friends  regular menu  If place open midnight would new unquestioned late night king   I'm inclined give place four stars based dish tried far extremely fast friendly service  Add fact everything under $5 oh  tax included glad bump fiver  <EOR> It probably fair write review during grand opening dollar days extravaganza but good 3 stars   Waited short line I hanging door 1 PM see backs guys front line Anthony T  Tien N  no less!  yelled join them     After being seated orders pretty fast food cold I expected reading Bobby Y 's review eat first!  ordered #1 Hainan chicken white meat came cucumbers rice cooked chicken broth 2 dipping sauces   spicy sauce killer finished chicken cucumber poured sauce rice ate last   pretty good   only time similar food food cart Portland   Tien curry chix roti Anthony thin ribeye rice potatoes   Definitely worth buck   Tien graciously treated stack quarters   probably would rush back but cheap even once $4 95 per dish rice spicy sauce *are* pretty tasty  <EOR> Where should begin?? being seated waiting 10 minutes waitress bypassed table twice take orders people seated us  sure if being only black couple anything it  ordered curry chicken roti pancakes must chicken shortage because received bowl curry potatoes few chicken scraps   Needless say won't back   only $1 00  plus   <EOR> Hey if you're going Wong big right?   The incentive quality control new eatery if paid dollar your beverage and mind if you're reading review 5 17 11 5 18 11 still going on your entree FREE!   No  typo true  FREE  three amigos ate $3 dollars plus tip last night    Newly remodeled fresh yellow paint ZERO items wall perhaps distract food? Big Wongs appeared clean hoppin    Seated very last table conveniently located next hallway leading restrooms placed beverage order  canned soda's arrived timely fashion unlike food    The number list menu items pretty small but based observation believe off menu option things such bok choy which found no where list   chose numbers placed order then commenced witty conversations amongst ourselves                 OK there's enough time A D D  medication input enough dots represent length time waited meals but while *clears throat* 40 minutes   received food dish time 5 15 minutes between each other but would say despite wait food actually quite tasty!   I give them small exception fact opening night all but common  Your menu tiny your items numbered Restaurant seats 10 tables MAX  Perhaps being harsh but don't see struggle food timely fashion all about  just sayin    OK OK enough that  food itself very delicious everything featured menu UNDER $5!!! Yes folks  right UNDER $5 00!!   Would eat again? Sure  Would way bring anyone recommend it? Prolly not  <EOR> I can't really say fan place first visit  But hey dollar can't really complain  Even standard $4 95 prices turns decent stop quick lunch  Sure nothing memorable but value its side   For starters ordered regular iced tea meal  Disappointingly just turned canned Lipton Brisk tea  usual forte but then again meal cheap any complaints about  Service still remained prompt friendly   For entrée chicken curry  tasted lot home cooking  You'd think that'd complementary but am terrible cook  terms flavors average  But ended being filling meal  Don't count waiting your food since practically served quickly drink came out   As mentioned earlier place nothing write home about  needed quick lunch fix good value  probably give another tomorrow last day $1 promotion  Maybe better tasting dish review 4 stars  <EOR> We stopped grand opening special yesterday   30 minute wait but wasn't really big deal   restaurant very clean service pretty quick very friendly   told curry chicken roti would take 15 minutes but table 5   would absolutely come back order again   really delicious $4 95 bad quick although somewhat greasy meal   boyfriend's fried chicken udon tasty well and little greasy    probably come back try some healthier entrées  <EOR> Went grand opening special  Free meal purchase $1 drink  thought going little sampler something but ended pretty good  Ordered special fried chicken rice 5a  chicken crispy juicy greasy  Loved dipping sauce came it  choice rice noodles each meal  noodles came soup big bowl  just opened everything clean  Service pretty fast considering bunch meal there  placed order wash hand restroom back all plates there  did long line side but its because wasn't waiting area inside wait just put ur name list waited 15 mins checked other stores around quick  think today last day special ill probably try something else  Meals regular $4 95  <EOR> If solely based ratings value Big Wong would 4 5 5 stars but everything average above average best    The Hainanese chicken sauce good but chicken tastes only boiled water    The curry chicken wasn't bad but could really use more kick  fried pork chop fried chicken really flavorful    All all 5 bucks entree can't complain  If school I'd prob all time  really decent fast Chinese food  Nothing spectacular but cheap food                               EDIT                                                         I came back Shrimp Soup Shirmp Wonton   soup really flavorful noodles great texture am definitely fan shrimp wontons   I little harsh first review but should cut some slack since during Grand Opening special   Value wise everything under 5 bucks tax hell value   back espeically fried chicken fried pork chop  <EOR> Today last day grand opening special dragged few coworkers join me   arrived 3 30pm place packed but wait wasn't very long only 10 mins party 5   Seems turn tables over pretty quickly little place   They only 14 items menu already decided going order before sat down   Hoi Nam Chicken over seasoned rice friends deep fried pork chop over rice fried pork chop udon noodle soup curry chicken over rice   My Hoi Nam chicken moist dipping sauce delish but seasoned rice best!
