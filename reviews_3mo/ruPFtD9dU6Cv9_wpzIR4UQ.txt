Service * * * * * Food * * * Counter service available  This humble dining room sets standard good service  awestruck great attitude work ethic skill amazing servers  manage cheerful top all work beyond me  restaurant must world class manager assemble such great team  They've forgotten more good service most culinary employees ever know   The high point clear used dishes without making sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into tub   servers bus own tables clearly diner comfort top priority    I wish could say food better but wasn't bad   Among three critics thumbs two thumbs sideways    My Ruben sandwich pretty good except soggy   guess slopped sauerkraut without draining it   When picked potato salad hunch wouldn't good right  Potato salad seems great challenge most eateries  The dab sampled Jerry's Famous exception  pickle just ordinary restaurant supply    Another critic spaghetti meat sauce which he described pretty bland  came garlic toast more French toast he said   Our third critic beef broccoli Chinese menu   She very happy saying The broccoli just right  tried sample but didn't care it  wasn't even good Panda   vote moved food rating three stars   Judging steady stream customers including families kids would say food must good enough   It's spacious well lighted restaurant  guess new smoking laws smoke free   Ventilation good enough don't suffer fumes drifting over casino   I'm frequenter casinos could wrong but South Point seemed packed Monday evening  neighborhood casinos usually busy?    South Point offers some very good people watching  crowd seemed more diverse interesting  tasteful selection sizes shapes ages physiques ethnicities stereotypes   There quite racket stun tunes slots but isn't unbearable Red Rock  <EOR> WTF!  WTF!?!   So does Suge Knight bad service awesome hot buffalo sauce common?  Well all Coronado Cafe late last night   seated grumpy host tossed menus table walked away man behind gets two chicken heads   He's tall stocky etc   playfully say hubby guy looks Suge Knight he says him   weird wanted ask if he anything Tupac and or Biggies deaths surreal   Only Vegas suppose  So service awful believe never left tip before   First waitress older Asian lady came asked 'what u want ' then proceeded wait wait buffalo wings no drinks no napkins when asked dressing she came threw dish table   just shocked because she bad she obsessing over big table could care less rest    I've many times think best buffalo sauce ever only wish fried them naked   also really good late night specials really cheap midnight 6am   service always decent except last night   always hits spot night partying drinking  <EOR>
