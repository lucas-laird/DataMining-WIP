I made beeline Elixir once saw word Organic its promotional sign parking lot where fresh52 Farmer's Market held  many Organic restaurant cafes Henderson needless say stoked  only recently opened a 'soft' opening don't full menu just yet but already plenty deliciousness enjoy    I started devouring sumptuous vegan chocolate cake since other people already finished red velvet cake boo! while waiting Caesar wrap spinach tortilla  cake wonderfully light fluffy adequately moist still quite hungry when wrap came out  wrap perfect  presentation lovely served little cup cold grapes pickle hot pepper  wrap itself most gorgeous tastiest spinach wraps ever seen whole wheat flecks spinach rather green ones seen elsewhere  Caesar dressing light tasty veggies fresh finely chopped  sandwich normally comes chicken but am vegetarian happy substitute tomatoes    They plan add hot sandwiches menu well breakfast menu yum  Currently variety fresh fruit yogurt boba tea smoothies well salads other sandwiches few other things can't remember  plan return frequently  Great addition neighborhood! <EOR> Very disappointing   Elixir high hopes given menu approach food   We arrived two groups entire restaurant   waitress pleasant enough let know menu limited would expanding   ordered somehow took 35 minutes basically soup salads sandwich   time 10 minutes passed only group restaurant took over 20 minutes them tell ingredients orders   When food came pretty good   Soup bland salad unexceptional but veggie sandwich thai beef wrap both very good   Unfortunately despite incredibly long wait time owner building declined come say anything even more amazingly told waitress best she could take 10% off check   Most insulting waitress said owner said could put feedback comment card!  Wow   only guests new restaurant couldn't come out   Simply amazing   I can't even begin wrap head around kind mentality   She should begging come talk every guest during soft opening whether food took 35 minutes not   Then come introduce herself under circumstances just mindblowing     We back cannot support management such little passion guests  To brand new restaurant opening want come greet <EOR> Warning am going brutally honest here  think people deserve that  mean no ill intenet  Just giving real deal  If want good reviews good job its simple   Went couple sandwiches lunch today    1  Roasted Eggplant sandwich roasted red peppers made vegan style vegan mozzarella cheese italian dressing alfalfa sprouts sprouted bread panini style  Tasted awful! ate half cuz hungry but couldnt bare eat other half  No flavor boyfriend even commented tasted dirt he right    2  Mediterranean Panini hummus cucumbers tomatoes feta alfalfa sprouts ona sprouted grain bread  Again bland  those some favorites things eat  better egglpant sandwich but thats saying much   3  Chocolate cake vegan gluten free  Again lacked flavor much such icing  Icing seemed need whipped more tasted very sugery like actual granules lot amaretto something tasted chemical its stung mouth really bad  Anyways seems lacked experience  could taste each ingredient separately should all blend together didnt  Threw away   They used carry Chef Mayra's cakes but since decided them themselves  dont even come close cakes  should back selling Chef Mayra cakes if least til more practice vegan cake making arena   One good note salsa served side good   And also would note first post place  seems someone erased profile here  am restarting it  Hope don't erase again  say if cant stand heat outta kitchen    But really hope better able server good food soon because really need more organic options    So try your own risk  But warned   Thats 2 cents  its worth  <EOR> Wow wait almost 20 mins hot sandwich minestrone soup go  If knew would long think would just gone home own lunch   My boyfriend hot beef sandwich  When home not even 5 mins away all soggy falling apart  sauce wasn't even sandwich yet  beef tasty but nothing spectacular  came grapes pickle hot pepper  He sandwich multi grain bread which he fairly disappointed with   I bowl minestrone soup vegetarian   thought minestrone supposed beans? crazy beans but I'd expect see few especially being vegetarian   expect full? soup definitely mediocre  noodles extremely soggy mushy! bowl $4 99 more size cup! wonder small cup is    The prices outrageous  boyfriend's hot sandwich bowl minestrone iced black tea came $19!! Next time driving road Raw Cafe some better tasting fresh food even if raw!  The interior decor looks sort mediterranean restaurant  some cool looking paintings  But tons shelves nothing them  seating ranges tiny tables two couch seating groups  also bar looking area where worker making smoothies drinks   Overall worth wait price  <EOR> I'm always excited hear new vegan friendly eatery town couldn't wait check place out!  cafe open bright both tables sofa seating available  also stage maybe having live music some point? maybe open mic poetry night where read vegan sonnets? Kidding! They standard cafe menu soups salads sandwiches including wraps panini    list 6 vegan soups !! including vegan chix noodle minestrone chili lentil butternut squash   However only lentil available   Booooo!  There vegan vegetarian version standard menu almost exactly same  just replace meat and or cheese vegan version they Tofurkey Crown meats looks Daiya cheez    server told all vegan veggie menu vegan or made such    Yay!!!  They also juice bar various teas boba which organic sweet regular boba overheard discussion frozen yogurt   dine takeout   The service pretty quick seated immediately menu then couple minutes later brought little dish dried fruit gnaw while making menu decision   cute idea!  I opted Vegan Cobb Salad $9 99 vegan ranch dressing   admit little underwhelmed although fair came exactly described menu lettuce tomatoes only few croutons bacon bits fake turkey little cheez avocado   could used few more veggies carrots? cucumber?    But hell never real Cobb salad maybe  right money    Regardless good size very tasty  did skimp avocado!  dressing good   only gave little tiny cup but  really all needed     if they'd doled more would just slopped some unnecessary calories   salad also came some very fluffy whole wheat pita delish   just black iced tea drink which fine but nothing special and $2 99?!?    They deal going now half off your drink purchase entree   bit pricey but organic food you're getting really good quality   think place lot potential   I'd give 3 5 might rounding score 4 if next visit and definitely one well  <EOR> The Lemongrass Chicken Sandwich best sandwiches ever but am sucker Southeast Asian flavor   wish sandwich bigger but really can't complain   hard Elixir   hard  <EOR>
