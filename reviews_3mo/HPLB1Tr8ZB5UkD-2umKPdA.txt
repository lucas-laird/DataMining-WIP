Chef Sheridan could serve 2x4 sure would best 2x4 ever ate!  I never stepped foot into Eureka Casino however tonight know going back    I'm just going list items thoughts spoiler alert   They're all good!  Pot Stickers Hands down best  pot stickers filling meaty cooked perfection   Shrimp Toast dish something would ordinarily order but came highly recommended did upset   Pork Belly BLT Yes exactly sounds BLT Pork Belly pork pork   the way should be sriracha mayo  think dish made anything combines Bacon Pork Belly never wrong!  Shortrib Grilled Cheese probably dish meal I having future   Shortrib cooked perfection enough cheese balance but overpower  onion Jam served side complimented sandwich perfectly   Fried Pork Sauce Noodles Noodles pork belly  noodles bit spice them pork belly cooked perfectly  touch spicy but still great dish   Duck Rice Hands down best dish meal quarter duck leg thigh served rice  duck succulent they told 2 day process duck made garlic rice well richness duck    The Location big but way bigger old shop bunch TVs bar well  highly recommend check out! Well done Chef Sheridan crew  <EOR> I am most conflicted  met Sheridan Su he great guy  But restaurant Chris Joseph recently nowhere close restaurant ate at  Hey great friends write puff reviews but long term truly does Sheridan disservice   First good Pot Stickers  Yes good tasty  But once order placed took 30 minutes come  only handful people restaurant   Plus saw Sheridan another cook kitchen   Does neighborhood really support five small Pot Stickers selling seven bucks?   This major beef Fat Choy total disconnect menu neighborhood  Examples open breakfast 8am   this working class area   the working class work 8am   also pancakes eggs sell eight bucks   again maybe works but here  breakfast special draw people in   this Robuchon's     Back meal  ordered  beer believe brought something close 40oz   I laughed   largest bottled beer ever dinner   who came that     Pork Belly BLT    I excited try unfortunately pork belly more bacon bits   there hardly any there   I asked extra sriracha mayo enough even taste   and bread totally soaked grill grease   absolutely brutal execution     Please understand want nothing but success Sheridan  But never walked restaurant feeling owner such disconnect concept presentation Sheridan done Fat Choy  intervention needed without which Fat Choy gone June  <EOR> last week order some food girl friend  girlfriend never before  But having food decided every sunday  had lot's tasty food there    yummm yummmm   <EOR> The BF striked trying Japanese place siesta thought all things shortlist try  Funny enough same thing happened Bobby Misti Mamie hubby too! Hey!   What funny name though  know most people think Fat Choy Chinese New Year greeting Gung Hay Fat Choy maybe cheeky nickname someone chubby but think literal translation hair vegetable which type moss put some Chinese foods  cute but also pretty tasty   The menu solid sounding hard decide try  promising whole menu well thought couldn't zoom into just thing easily  settled sharing two things early dinner catch though would loved appetizer dessert    Short rib rice bowl braised bone tender  gave two generous ribs cooked sauce reminds much Filipino adobo  tiny bit salty but don't think ridiculously so  give bit salad balsamic dressing pickled mustard greens it  good but don't know if $14 good  doesn't seem neighborhood drops kind money don't know play local patron traffic vs foodies seek out    Pork sauce noodles really liked this  ground pork diced tofu mixture cooked hoisin ish type sauce thrown some shredded carrots cucumbers sprouts  reminds dan dan noodles but think liked better  would definitely again    Service nice but wasn't best  BF ordered soda really thought stale tasting let server know she just took away never offered anything else still pay it  give bottle Eureka water free if ask ice water but never refill empty water  took while able order walk counter check way  wasn't really busy two ladies working floor feel should bit better     wouldn't ever think come Eureka still kind weird bare cafeteria esque space but more comfortable spot previous incarnation salon seating  am overly smoke sensitive but smoke smell strong casino floor restaurant opens may bothersome sensitive noses    I see some promise well made eats back more Fat  Yelp 100 Challenge 34 100 <EOR> Food good ok! Nothing special but wait took 45 min just food! slow but guess only cook?! Idk? so   Food good service fine prepared wait   <EOR> I didn't realize place hasn't officially opened   According staff its still considered soft opening   Located inside smoky casino Fat Choy  knew nothing place except brick n mortar food truck @GreatBaoLV   Overall good comfort food  Portions sharable but huge   Free wifi but tiny place sure once place gets buzzing it'll food many   Its better 3 star but quite 4    If wasn't such smoke filled casino I'd back  <EOR> Sheridan man behind Great Bao just opened joint try out  even more impressed then first joint maybe because he real kitchen time?! Short Rib Grilled Cheese best sandwich life  Period  way meet cheese melted each other decadent while meat cheese gooey bread nice crisp   also shrimp toast which paste kind tastes Vietnamese bean curd shrimp cake but served bread egg top  Very good   Anyways Fat Choy really only reason would step foot Eureka say very well worth it  If find yourself near commercial center UNLV downtown highly recommend checking out  <EOR> Drawn pictures short rib grilled cheese sandwich dragged Mel C  Eureka Casino check Fat Choy   Bigger imagined would restaurant spot itself clean few flat screens walls showing various sports   servers attentive sandwiches we same thing delicious   Throwing caution wind even fries side instead salad   I mean really if you're going clog your arteries must commit all way   Having said think Mel would agree must now penance gym partaking such meal but well worth it  <EOR> Short Ribs Grilled Cheese Sandwich!!!  They say picture worth thousand words   pictures reviews Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich bookmark place  didn't know much Fat Choy even Eureka Casino until Terri R  mentioned during lunch couple weeks ago   read couple reviews thought maybe   But looking few pictures knew eventually pay visit Short Ribs Grilled Cheese    Yesterday perfect   meeting California just experienced really bad lunch   middle presentation text Terri R  meet Fat Choy dinner when back town  If read Terri R's review she mentioned she dragged here   even close   No drag anything equals eating  Remember favorite food seconds    The service really good but also expected since 2 only 4 customers joint   course short ribs grilled cheese w fries Terri same   sandwich good advertised   Imagine perfectly made grilled cheese sandwich couple pieces tender fall off bone short ribs   Then put those together sauce isn't overpowering much it    Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese   worth another visit if still drinker would perfect hangover meal  <EOR> Great comfort food  Accessible Asian fusion  starters wife ordered bone marrow well bao  marrow topped onion jam side toast  Succulent creamy delicious  duck bao fantastic  Crispy sweet fatty  duck skin moist duck meat  couldn't any better  wife short rib rice bowl  meat fall off bone tender very flavorful  short rib grilled cheese sandwich  Bursting flavor sinfully delicious  server April very attentive very friendly  Overall great experience highly recommended  <EOR> Oh boy place could trouble such good way   I normally look new restaurants good rating little bit pessimism friends family padding rating   But yeah real deal amazingly good food great price   Pork Belly Bao very nicely done could done just touch more cooking time just bring flavors pork belly but may well personal thing   Shortrib grilled cheese     This may well down all time great seriously if can't decide eat just this   Fat Choy burger another great dish egg cooked perfection burger cooked ordered an amazingly rare thing Vegas short rib added nice taste burger   Tirimisu cake mmm sure should really called tirimisu more cake coffee flavored cream topping   Red Velvet cake wife loved it   The service excellent drinks refilled quickly   Negatives only those darn frozen french fries show again seriously understand where may easier but fresh home made fries much better really chef talent much he may having fries menu could much them   Anyways back many times  <EOR> *Cough cough cough*  think now emphysema inhaling all smoke casino while eating Fat Choy   Why did pick Eureka Casino?  Dumpy old hotel very poor ventilation     About food   we 2 orders pork belly bao since duck bao available today boo! bone marrow shrimp toast   Pork Belly Bao For $7 2 pieces bao   pork crunchy but super salty hello hypertension!    could've added more sauce neutralize saltiness 3 5 5  Shrimp Toast $8 gets piece toast shrimp Chinese sausage fried egg top   good   But $8 good  shrimp toast most Chinese restaurants half price  3 5  Bone Marrow $8 fatty goodness good onion jam top   5 5  I usually don't pay attention price when comes food   But today to   think Fat Choy overrated overpriced where getting from   understand paying $8 shrimp toast if Bellagio Wynn   3 pieces bao somewhere else same price   concept great but needs improved before come back again   Maybe next time just order food to go   oh wait charge $1 that!  It looks next review doing hospital    <EOR> I've always respected admired Lee family but when learned partnership Sheridan decided deserve more kudos   move brilliant clever incredibly savvy since ability bring entirely new generation customers into property who've never darkened door possibly never even considered before      Sheridan's food deserves lots more recognition   He's hardworking committed love  also family affair   While Sheridan's locations aren't traditional mainstream  beauty shop smoky casino floor still tremendous opportunity wish all best because food truly made love care     I think would great location Yelp event  Misty?  Gung Hay Fat Choy! <EOR> So husband recently came dinner  actually didn't mind restuarant located Eureka Casino local restaurants even more interesting keeps snobs away   We chose different items snacks section menu  chose potstickers chicken wings shrimp toast duck pork belly bao  potstickers really good wings although wings anywhere else  Maybe ranch sriracha sauce accompany them would nice  meat both baos good but thought could've used something moist them  Neither husband experts baos only tried twice could aren't used them  shrimp toast did understand maybe if would've eaten soon recived but time tried egg kind cold  husband really enjoyed though he picky when comes runny eggs  service very attentive friendly  big plus    All all decent meal thought prices tad bit high considering location  <EOR> Bleccccccccchhhhh!   Everyone grandma raving place thought I'd better check out  wanting check Eureka Casino anyway    one those solidly un pretentious little locals' dumps doubtlessly imploded any day now  Well having checked out   IMPLODE AWAY SAY!  Everything restaurant coated in soaked in bathed in wallowing grease  friend shared pot stickers appetizer  OK although also glistening gratuitous grease  far pot stickers go   they any other potstickers  Except greasier  All better slide down your gullet guess   Next much ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese  BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin describe monstrosity! thought pot stickers greasy  beast OFF CHAIN GREASY! eating heavily salted Jheri curl sandwich!! don't wasting food managed choke down half before giving  but G R O S S  salty almost trying cover something up  Also grease weird sort stale aftertaste use same fry oil over over  YUCK!   The fries accompanied sandwich similarly greasy  know know French fries called FRIES because FRIED  but ridiculous  better fries employee dining room Caesars Palace! fry grease same gross aftertaste sandwich which totally killed whatever left appetite   Now might chalk all being veggie eating commie bastard  but guess what? friend most definitely veggie eating commie Fat Choy burger   and similarly grossed out  He reported astonishingly greasy  although he did finish whole thing couldn't bad   You might blame having ordered something less greasy grilled cheese  but menu extremely limited one page only since don't duck pork didn't want highly touted bao any rice dishes  willing bet just greasy anyway fact wasn't much anything menu grew ground  all lard grease carbs meat   What really sucks came fully expecting adore place  being located such solidly unpretentious dive  Speaking which       After gave eating sopped grease off face no fewer thirty napkins into casino drink bar thinking could salvage evening little people watching rum coke cut through grease still coating tongue  But even sadly awry   First all cash only bar didn't any me  raped corner ATM pay $5 surcharge   which brought cost drink Strip prices anyway  If paying Strip prices dammit want least able ogle drunk bitches fake tits etc  But all depressing smoke filled room full methheads Kenny Loggins playing somewhere background  kind ambiance OK if you're certain mood         but when you're already verge vomiting ain't no fun! finished drink fuck probably never return    I never thought I'd say but   there some places DESERVE imploded  hear Tony Hsieh?!! Blow bitch sky high  even elitist members only dog park would better THIS!!! <EOR> Yes hotel bit run down divey    but restaurant brings different crowd  locals seem complain prices lot  find food very reasonably priced seriously yummy   I fan Great Bao since beginning  bit dispirited when found being kicked hair salon kind awkward location anyway but  beside point  Good thing truck  enjoyed visiting truck almost every time Vegas last year 7 times  Nonetheless when heard Great Bao starting brick mortar restaurant stoked   My favorite thing Great Bao fact many different specials food choices  Those specials kept going back  Those changes menu kind reflection he wanted others taste  Chef Sheridan having restaurant somewhat represents big canvas truck salon just did fully express art cooking  menu simple every dish tried much thought put into it   I wish could into detail everything tried but just going keep short simple  shrimp toast MUST t'was favorite item meal  Fat Choy Burger cooked perfectly medium juicy  dressing side salad AMAZING  bone marrow perfectly cooked fact bread grilled  duck rice smokey tasty  sesame noodles quite good well   Writing review making mouth water     I can't wait Vegas again try pork sauce noodles pot stickers!

Would order again     Service likely best part meal   Jenny server only working she made sure everything ran smoothly   saw mostly locals even table probably only came Eureka Casino Fat Choy us   I high hopes appeared foodie haven reading yelp reviews but only found solid restaurant selling good but unmemorable food  <EOR> There seems trend Vegas where slightly unique restaurant opens town everyone nuts over months end  Case point Honey Salt Eat Poppy Den any Gordon Ramsay Restaurant pretty much half places Strip  experience far some places they're all overrated honestly nothing world  If worried weren't any new ones along comes Fat Choy kill your worries  top 'famous' bao buns they're now offering trendy burger please masses headed over see all hype about   Fat Choy located inside Eureka Casino overly smoky tiny awful casino older part town  when say smoky let's clear completely awful  Upon walking through doors smacked wall cigarette smoke likes which haven't experienced since last time Double Down  building tiny formula small space group depressing looking old people smoking endlessly slot machines perfect whirlwind awful  smoke doesn't end casino when walk into Fat Choy restaurant space smell doesn't dissipate  fact point while waiting food marveled fact couldn't smell any food cooking just more cigarettes  didn't spend any more time casino itself other walking through restaurant yet throat noticeably sore end visit   The restaurant itself 5 bar seats 5 booths handful tables generically decorated typical casino café style  3 4 TV's space each different show unfortunately audio chosen listen episode Kardashians  Major points taken off that  menu extremely simple almost all Asian themed items potstickers bao rice noodles even burger  There's also breakfast menu six items basic get  love great pork belly bao sandwich order them before burgers  really good pork extra crispy which loved peanuts sparse but added nice extra crispiness them  Still good can't say worth going your way try several other bao options town   As Fat Choy Burger comes 1 2lb Angus beef short rib bacon fried egg cheddar roasted tomato  Upon first bite immediately notice incredibly messy maybe because short rib grease  rib really great flavor though did super crispy bacon  patty good flavor but seemed bit generic pre made variety  Still cooked very close medium rare ordered  egg very large good flavor bit much lettuce usual  didn't notice anything special roasted tomatoes burger unfortunately  bun bit thin all stuff but fresh fit well everything else  Overall really good flavors differed bite bite but something felt dive café dive casino trying out do itself tasty cult burger  all noticeable efforts don't think quite there   The fries incredibly undercooked point most inedible  frozen generic skinny fry variety but tend those if they're overcooked just right completely raw were  all don't know if all hype around place  bao good no pro any means but better  burger certainly good but nothing stands being worthy into awful smelly building ever again  meal could made better if fries decent but enough change mind much  once again able experience restaurant everyone raves yet walked away completely unimpressed willing revisit  Maybe missed something everyone seems think did Poppy Den BurGR Honey Salt probably few others venture your own risk  <EOR> The stars don't tell whole story  know people look three stars assume Oh isn't worth time  true  Yes place dive  Yes filled smoke  Yes location isn't   ideal  But folks should still check place out  spite reviews  yes spite smoke    We only three items menu  short rib grilled cheese duck bao pork bao    The food very tasty  bao thoughtfully prepared meat each seasoned well  crispy skin moist meat drew into both bao options  solid  grilled cheese sandwich gooey flavorful  bread toasted perfectly meat inside generous just sweet enough cut through some heaviness sandwich  But greasy me  good first few bites   I should stopped tried another dish    Here part might understand place  heart food cannot dismissed basis grease location even smoke  Even without knowing owner's story see other reviews taste thoughtfulness energy each bite  dishes thrown together attempt doors open  crafted tweaked achieve specific balance   even greasy grilled cheese which very well flavored way     I cannot imagine pressures small restaurant endure kind setting small locals casino   saw people wandering during break slot play burger followed closely looked Yelper hipsters looking try newest location   Fat Choy diverse audience consider am willing cut some slack its efforts toward making new location work customer base   I think business worth trip Eureka Casino  think worth battling smoke stepping over some colorful locals  admit something story does appeal me  But more food appeals me   back  <EOR> This those hidden surprises love share   It awful casino but only bad thing say  good actually took family less week found it   I group Meetup com  40 took over entire place   The Sesame Noodles sent straight Chinese food gods  sampled nine separate dishes all Chinese all fabulous  service stellar  Chef came everyone applauded  He took bow   I know love place much did along 40 foodie friends  <EOR> Small menu obviously nicest casino but food inexpensive really delicious restaurant itself cute place  <EOR> I mean wasn't bad   just wasn't anything more OK   wonton soup bao noodles everything between  tried all except american fare    Every single dish left LOT desired   Add location you've losing combination   Won't back simply because far better options    think China Mama!!!  Avoid short rib fried rice all costs   beef tough rice well just white rice   fried all   The best thing tried short rib grilled cheese sourdough   short rib better dish because shredded     Points service!  waitress great   But kitchen incredibly slow   only couple other tables occupied   Can't imagine backed place gets capacity  <EOR> I visited Fat Choy today first time  Reviews mixed being very close home decided give try    Arrived Eureka around 3pm sunday place empty  Same Fat Choy only couple inside booth    Ordered pork belly bao appetizer short rib rice entree  both terrific!! Bao good could've eaten 10 those   Short rib also amazing  tender no problem eating chopsticks    I left happy customer really  Food great service fast friendly  didn't problem casino all or smell other yelpers pointed out     I definitely back  Great new place  <EOR> This pleasant surprise  Now mind area little wierd exactly first date kind place  Its inside Eureka Casino really old area  However besides looking 50's Americana Diner place solid Asian food  few dishes impressed overall quality dishes flavors  several things which ind weird 4 afternoon but guess must fresh    I dont think wrong anything menu ordered 5 6 things all great  Love Budah Beer Bottles! Very cool good beer too  <EOR> The pork belly bao very good but didn't other baos   Overall probably worth return trip  <EOR> My friends invited hubs Fat Choy few weeks ago   Unfortunately closed private event   super bummed craving bao buns entire day!
