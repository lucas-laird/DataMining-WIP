The Royal Kabob another random find thanks super cheap gift certificates restaurant com   girlfriend super excited try place looked really cool pictures web site reasonably close houses   Unfortunately when pulled realized made look much better pictures just strip mall   We then proceeded very awkward waitress take care us   She wasn't bad per say but considering place empty little slow   just everything serving technique seemed awkward   example when bringing some pita bread dipping sauces pry information each sauce rather standard explanation were   The food itself tasty    if wasn't fact place wasn't visually appealing service strange we'd back   But seeing couldn't stop talking while we'll probably pass somewhere else next time   Food alone? 3 1 2 stars   But overall only 2 star me  <EOR>
