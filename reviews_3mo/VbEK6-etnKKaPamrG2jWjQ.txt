Next time? Nah    probably not  <EOR> Hole wall place strip  Extremely good quick bite  Inexpensive place  Great veggies offer veg substitue all hot dogs  <EOR> We walking into restaurant 2 customers walked told DON'T EVEN BOTHER  didn't listen advice  The meal consists tasteless grocery store hotdog coleslaw barbecue sauce fries  server asked if want extra coleslaw found why    It's because hotdog tasteless need extra coleslaw add taste   The fries OK  <EOR> The place awesome  great selection hot dogs choose from  NY dog Detroit dog even DC half smoke  also some great chili cheese fries  top off sold beer well  Great place bite eat  <EOR> I love hot dogs when noticed spot quick bite alley next Q outside Flamingo it  Food pricey Vegas quick bite nice change LONG lines $$$ everywhere  No wait  in!

Coney dog greek dog twice try it   Quick friendly service really cool decor! <EOR> I'm no hotdog connoisseur into whole gourmet hotdog thing but dog New Years Eve really hit spot   I Tijuana Dog bacon wrapped deep fried frank grilled onion jalapeno mayo $7 30  The Good When saw bacon wrapped frank mouth began water could resist? just hoped good sounded was  flavor bacon combined dog grilled onions jalapenos very tasty    The Bad pretty minor strictly cosmetic but dog didn't look all appetizing when came out  bacon nearly blackened around edges dog blistered sure deep frier  don't know if could avoided shortening cooking time few seconds would just good if grilled? don't know but wouldn't stop ordering again   The Indifferent At first little leery prices  5 50 plain dog?  bit steep  But when started looking more interesting offerings like Tijuana figured those prices worth unique hotdog experience unlikely stumble across elsewhere      did take them while food but fairly busy wait wasn't annoyingly long   My only regret didn't time come back try couple other offerings before left town  least four five other dogs menu I'd try future visits  <EOR> Good but great  Overpriced is    I ordered Detroit Coney Dog Kobe hot dog Polish sausage peppers  polish sausage OK you find much better polish sausages any grocery store  Kobe dog very good juicy flavorful  Everything else dog tasted food service quality buns chili shredded cheddar cheese  Nothing special there    Overall good place lunch if you've drinking it located Vegas strip   big critique two hot dogs drink costs $20  Although located strip tourist prices certainly find much better places eat $20 even strip    My biggest critique actually menu  When walk menu located almost near ceiling everyone straining neck look it  There's way many types hot dogs each  coming different type meat starters  There's Kobe dogs grilled franks polish sausage steamed franks etc  Then all catchy names menu divided into two sections hot dogs  much confusing  should keep menu simpler easier actually look at     Now tried wouldn't back unless walking strip friends evening wanted quick snack beers  <EOR> This Haute spot located Linq because Linq cool thought place would cool! Little did know expectations way high = I walked looked menu eyes lit when saw Billionaire Dog   know all waiting it    but just A OK  billionaire dog consists FOIE GRAS which reason why EYES LIT kobe beef dog which actually pretty good but wish dog DOG though! some type jelly  good but DIDN'T HIT SPOT    I know am hot dog expert but know like  hope future give them another chance SURPRISE ME! <EOR>
