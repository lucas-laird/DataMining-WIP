Best all around show Vegas! <EOR> I am completely obsessed place   spent past Saturday evening visiting bar watching show still thinking four days later   So since talked death Yelp try keep point  Food drinks expensive prepared  It's true Absinthe Lite least 8pm show   Less profanity which wanted more actually but still really great performances  Wander around talk employees find cool things place  Stick around show watch performances bar  Ask where study drink there   offer full drink menu well couple only find bar   Locals if familiar Laundry Room when first opened you'll happy see Jun working here! Keep yourself ready surprises    you never know kind crazy things see!  The drinks really good terribly priced Strip   asked something boozy bartender made just let's just say laughing little hard Mr  Piffles during show   Also ordered couple veggie items menu Fennel Salad Curry Cauliflower    really didn't think worth price   portions small think tapas much going on   Next time spend money another drink   If chance Rose  Rabbit  Lie  then go!

He really great! ended going back seconds  favorite drink ended being apple one  Since terrible! didn't keep track names but delicious   first really strong punch name lol    Now far actual show concerned thought OK! know made laugh few times but honestly felt long if would've paid full price would pretty upset   think if you're unsure whether you'd show would check place night club lounge cheaper 12am show  swear cocktails strong enough even dozing off during some parts    My favorite part show requires splash zone gear!  When show done you're free explore all other areas  really cool but hard navigate while everyone having dinner  I can't wait back try food looked delicious smelled great! also wanna check night scene but overall place new place be! tons fun   <EOR> Dropped $300 spouse entertaining but altogether necessarily worth price   Then discovered among handful people actually pay which kind gut punch cocktails tremendously expensive   A very interesting stage show some players interact audience but price point very proportion actual performances   If you're amongst lucky majority received complimentary admission take peek but heavily suggest avoiding place unless smoke $90 cigars lit $20 bills   The performance art entertaining interaction audience brought third dimension show   Think well dressed street performers little bit Tap Dogs little Blue Man Group ish   I don't want say rip but certainly priced Romanovs exactly worth tremendous entry fee especially when most club seemed if comps   Feeling little jaded well financially leeched   It's stage show then standard night club  If morphed marquee sprinkle cabaret very light touch Cirque du Soleil drop $300 couple rose rabbit lie  <EOR> love spot  something new different amidst cookie cutter clubs town  <EOR> Great time yesterday say reviews accurate  midnight show short compared 10pm but more fun  Club great but people don't stay late other dance venues  just because different   'll remember your night year now vs  just regular club night    Still fence paying full shows?
