Our waiter asked if ever said no he said welcome your new favorite pizza place   holy crap BEST BEST BEST This coming someone likes     liked? deep dish grim serves east coast which thin but great thing eat more! 3 polished large down last piece chicken pan  pies cooked pretty hot crust crunchy delicious   Its kinda expensive toppings though think large 15 but then add each topping 2 6 dollars think chicken 5 remember  also meatball  Fantastic    Reminded lot Chicago Brewing BUT MUCH BETTER  Its rather small inside but still looks classy course its boca park  Classic red white checker tablecloths bar front BUT NO TVs which actually liked here  Walls decorated normal new york italian gear  Didnt see anything yankee which funny its dont want sports bar for which would gordon anyway but big wines very italian restaurant fashion wine glasses waiting tables you  Will try dessert next time didnt even look  did caprese salad start which very elegant but waste 7 bucks cheese tomato    All could say while eating freaking good! Uploading picture lighting its emptied wine bottles hanging ceiling almost didnt notice gems!  5 STARS food being snooty but clean new dress lil feel better anyway     EDIT!! idk could forgotten mention this  came alone asked table 3 2 hostesses kinda looked explained old man little girl would joining me  asked if she needed bring booster seat  funny part 'little girl' 20 yr old sister awkwardly let them know she wasn't 'little girl' but rather little sister happens very short    haha always little <EOR> Great service  Pizza delicious sauce isn't soggy possibly due being thicker crust  Alcohol beverage prices way high beers served 12 oz glass instead pint glass  <EOR> After 5 hours walking shopping LV Premium Outlets worked big appetite  drive home decided tacos guacamole Chipotle could quick easy dinner but passed newly opened 1 month ago? Grimaldi's Boca Park made last minute decision give pizza spin   We order small house salad $5 large enough feed 3 4 people two plenty green eat  house vinaigrette very vinegary but tomatoes mushrooms fresh whole green olives good quality  order large traditional Grimaldi's pizza onions garlic jalapeños $15 + $2 per topping = $21   wait pizza quick survey pizzas other customers' tables little nervous coal brick oven Grimaldi's over baking crust  Every pizza see restaurant dark brown black burnt crust edges  Thinking take really resilient dough recipe withstand level scorching very impressed if crust actually chewy crispy! pizza shows up  cheese looks great stark white color good Buffalo mozzarella  Bonus fresh basil middle pizza! No visible grease puddles under pizza! Overall topping quantity isn't terribly generous but compared Settebello's 'authentic' i e  totally skimpy pizza topping distribution find no reason complain  first bite any thin crust pizza pray pizza gods crust perfectly 50% crispy 50% chewy  Unfortunately Grimaldi's crust 80% crispy 20% chewy time pizza half eaten 4 slices left stales becomes 100% crispy much crust texture Tombstone frozen pizza  did happen?!  The edge crust unacceptably crunchy flavorless and burnt! second half pizza left wondering wrong pizza does pizza crust take total turn worse only 10 minutes into meal? could easily left 2 pieces togo box next day's lunch but found ourselves better eat it now because it stale situation crust already surprisingly stiff  actually heard crust *snap* all way down middle when folding last slice!   My favorite pizza experiences North America included few special pies Lou Malnati's Chicago Pizzeria Bianco Phoenix John's Pizzeria NYC Frank Pepe's New Haven Pizzeria Rustica Miami   Vegas good luck Metro Pizza Rocco's NY Pizzeria pear gorgonzola arugula proscuitto pizza Sammy's location Sahara consistently tasty choice  respect Grimaldi's could say maybe bad pie but judging dozen other over baked pizzas saw customers' tables think baking time yeast adjustment could really help flavor all crust just needs little chewy tweaking! Service friendly very attentive  Apparently cheesecake Grimaldi's homemade good NYC Stage Deli's    <EOR> I odd experience Grimaldi's  never meal start star level then gradually slip into another star dimension  If taken hot bite jumped write review would probably given pie solid 4 stars but happened  pizza slowly became hot rather cold mess    The place cute old wine bottle chandeliers  bottoms cut bulbs contained within bottle  clustered around ceiling quite fascinating  took minute server show greet some reason Saturday evening being stickler service bothered bit  quite possible brightness wine bottle chandeliers made hypersensitive  bar area might more comfortable   We ordered small salad large pizza onion garlic jalapeno  Based scent profile pretty obvious already man  small salad huge good value $5  dressing wasn't standout lacked vinegary punch! Then pie arrived  other local pie joints underwhelmed volume toppings  might start showing own  Just start pulling baggies onions mushrooms purse  Anyways first slice pizza great  sauce little sweet crust tad crispy but still good chew  No burnt edges which meant ate all crust  However pizza started cold crust became stale    Perhaps yeast oil deprivation  pizza least greasy pizza quite some time but would trade stale pizza big ol' greasy pizza any day week  Maybe weak dough day am revisit but now 3 44 star deal which sadly requires rounding down  <EOR> Grimaldi's opened Summerlin recently am happy  best pizzas Las Vegas  spread cheese different other pizza places put drops there's drops cheese drops sauce  no wonder 13 locations Vegas Arizona Texas  pizza right  sauce delicious  Real pizza sauce spicy no tomato chunks  outside eating area  very comfortable but pizza gets cold there  Stay away high priced drinks large pizza drink under $20 counting tip  <EOR> Grimaldi's establishment large pedigree  most lauded pizza joints New York City appeared branched franchising 2 joints Las Vegas  So much anticipation hubby bit bullet piece pie   Meh  Really  pizza flavourful expected  marinara tinned pureed tomatoes sauce sausage basil onions  lack spice sauce sausage  total downer  small amount basil did put pizza did nothing detract overall blandness poor pie  Which rather sad because crust best tried   We did back try Grimaldi's second time time opting white sauce meatball onions  Still food rather bland  server time did bring some dried oregano garlic powder which doused poor slices give some flavour   Really food alone does probably deserve maybe three star rating  However cost pizza detracted doing so  <EOR> I finally hit place much fan fair   started antipasto plate   decent   would hoped fresh oregano basil top along fresh mozzarella   $12 hoping better selection olives   pizza price right but crust little lacking   Almost thin crunchy   pizza cracker   crust resemble really crusty bread little chew   sauce winner great fresh tomato flavor toppings top notch   beer prices also bad  <EOR>
