Fantastic Barbecue!!!! waited entire year come back event eat bbq stand!!! Some BEST BBQ anywhere!!!  I course opted 3 meat 3 side meal getting Ribs Pulled Pork Brisket plus baked macaroni cheese macaroni potato salads  3+3=$16 well worth it   Bottled water Canned Soda only $1 too!!! food ordered end served another keep moving other vendors 30+ minute wait because disorganized service   Immediately upon opening order noticed given leg thigh bbq chicken NO pulled pork Macaroni Cheese  When back explain graciously provided missing items  ended extra piece chicken  Fair enough inconvenience The food really good  Perfectly cooked barbecue  ribs falling bone tender moist great bbq sauce side  brisket some BEST ever!! Tender melt your mouth sliced paper thin!! chicken smoked through but moist tender plus little kick it  Pulled pork great but already sauced personally prefer adding own macaroni potato salads homemade pretty good but baked macaroni cheese little overdone mushy no crunchy topping indicate being BAKED mac n chz no real cheese flavor   John Mulls Meats operates butcher shop NW Las Vegas does event catering but event ONLY time come during year down FREMONT check them before late  Taste Sounds Soul through February 21st!!! <EOR> No reviewed place butcher shop yet  Kinda surprised around long time    Two weeks ago frustrated bend find butcher  L A  4 regular butchers meet all odd cooking needs  closest house  small neighborhood street behind house  Definitely off beaten path find you'd know can't really stumble upon   no glass counter very old school meat factory feel  Its much standing space real plain industrial but ambiance cute glass counter doesn't always equate better meats learned though guess most prefer user friendly spots    You someone manning counter taking your orders simple printout listing meats available behind them butcher bring big slabs meat cut your order  LOVE fresh cut me! ordered 1 5 inch thick ribeyes dinner  choice cuts but nicely marbled just quite prime close though  $9 99 pound definitely decent price getting supermarkets charge much don't control portion sizes thickness here   Cooked those ribeyes first pan searing then putting oven  Resting them hard time cut chomp down  Very good quality meat fresh taste tender nice amount fat marbling  Liked them lot definitely quality easy taste supermarket bought   They beef pork turkey sausages hotdogs deli meats smoked items turkey leg pork chops etc  also odd parts animal    When many people standing order familiar staff even each other  good testament quality loyals buying bunches  bit wait people before butcher custom cutting but very fun watch quality meats everyone ordering all looked pretty nice  Someone beef tenderloin filet mignon particular fine quality   I think go to place when particular cut matters whats cooking when want no fuss basic meats  Butcher Block cool but going across town some good ribeyes precut if want aged meats something odd family game meats but John Mulls where all basic meat needs met cut just way it  Summer BBQ's whole different level   UPDATE today ordered 2 ribeyes 9 99 lb 2lbs korean style rib 3 89 lb   He mentioned something ribeyes prime he's giving free  thought he meant he throwing little extra meat onto ribeyes free he meant order ribeyes free  YEAH FREE PRIME RIBEYE   cooked them ooooo good  left maybe nearly 2lb ribeyes 2 lbs korean ribs $8 90   great thing building relationship your butcher talking necessarily getting just freebies but knowing youre always taken care really appreciated  great relationship butcher LA nad he would tell when something particularly good he wanted sample new sausage flavors would chat foods he would give great suggestions he uses meats  seems really remember appreciate all customers again customers first name basis he asked BBQ last weekend See BBQ review   sold above Larrys Meats Butcher Block like  Service quality customer appreciation beyond we're definitely going stop weekends cooking adventures meat needs  Thanks Chuck Nita guys awesome! <EOR> I love butchers   especially love butcher shop run family knows meats John Mull's it   few others around town but place spotless entire building walk freezer meaning fresh meat back stays fresh while cutting bagging simple set up   cash counter front where grab paper 2 page list all cuts then old man behind counter  totally awesome very sweet  helps thickness cooking tips   I cannot believe many varieties meats available made even more intrigued smoked bacon slabs done right smoke house site   Oh yeah baby   Sweet lovin' bacon slabs cut order   grabbed 1 5 lbs smoked bacon without rind cause suggested way two 1 ribeye steaks cut FRESH slab 4 pork chops cut thick enough pan frying cut fresh off slab   fun watch fun order shocker register   All meat ALL meat 25 bucks   WOW   freaked out   know pork least 6 pounds ribeyes 18oz each then bacon   all 25 bucks?  happy walking there   Screw supermarkets   buying meats John Mull's now on   all need when need it   If you're looking butcher northwest area head place   worth drive well kept secret neighborhood until now     PS cater if want great bbq just ask when there   also call order things advance  <EOR>
