Great breakfast price point! Whole Hog omelette very tasty! offer few gluten free items  better before 10 00AM might waiting table  also bar 16 seats option but hostess need seat you  back <EOR> Although no longer Griddle Cafe some items remain menu    weekend switch around when Griddle Friday but Northside Monday   We ordered banana pancakes add ons walnut caramel streusel  basically Golden Ticket   flavor same but pancakes significantly smaller  no longer overflowed plate   good thing large otherwise    price point $2 less   Our server bit brusque confused   Menu much smaller  now just seems coffee shop  <EOR> If don't feel driving something eat better your car something eat instead settling place  Seriously   The wait times asinine because they're probably understaffed they're open 24 hours when clubs closed people flock grub on  addition aren't exactly nicest people probably because aforementioned reasons  just bad recipe vicious cycle   I ordered some sort skillet think  said think because half asleep pretty turnt when food arrived but know fact girlfriend ordered pesto sandwich shrimp but chicken instead  She said something but waitress just sort brushed off gave empty apology life   The food mediocre worst part expensive mediocre food  <EOR> Service ridiculous They friendly every guy works super slow mode Ordered egg white omelette apart taking 30 min order taken waiting 20 omelette wrong  Wtf They need some women here!! Annoyed  <EOR> Locals Beware place doesn't consider local even if slap them Nevada ID  told Northside cafe manager las vegas local meant surrounding apartments pretty much within SLS vicinity      big writing reviews but place just much!  breakfast morning hostess specifically gave local secret menu instead regular menu  seated bar service ok food ok price local menu  When asked bill noticed charged full price regular menu  When asked server why charged full price all he said oh you're supposed little sticker your code card there's nothing guy holding nevada ID las vegas address it! local be???  place ridiculous am never going back there! locals beware don't even bother  asking specials locals  <EOR> Four stopped breakfast none left hungry!! bacon egg omelette made egg whites  doesn't love thick cut bacon? boyfriend fluffiest moist buttermilk pancakes most generous dollop butter  waitress kept coffee cups filled throughout meal seemed well rehearsed menu  Good service yummy food! Definitely spot check out  <EOR> Great fun smiles Northside Cafe! James server great attentive without being overbearing friendly  Love going into place where everyone happy smiling  Ordered Greek Salad would think no risk such item but be  portion perfect dressing over top super fresh! Thanks Northside Cafe! <EOR> I really hope SLS cleans its acts before its late   Northside Cafe great example whats wrong all recent dining shake ups SLS  dined few friends identified ourselves locals ID hands  Despite being confirmed server charged full price everything ordered  Upon bringing server she informed card missing sticker identifying locals despite having IDs showing addresses hand  would nice know when told locals before ordered  Whatever   I probably wouldn't annoyed if food actually worth price  wasn't  Northside mostly traditional cafe fare find pretty much anywhere  fries burger cold clearly sitting while  street tacos tiny  Fortunately banana pancakes good hold over menu previous Griddle Cafe    Service disaster start finish  30 minute wait time food took forever come out  flag down server refills order in  understand  all new restaurants issues starting off but just catastrophe  1 star! Smh all day  <EOR> I would consider myself cheerleader SLS     several times enjoy facility staff    really wanted place    Experience yesterday did enable unfortunately    I came redeem food offer id received hoped quick smooth business lunch which did turn case    First fries came cold but kept eating them because thats do    mad myself it    Second understand every place cook burger order but just don't ask want if you're clearly going attempt way  ordered mine medium rare came put it on the grill and go take your dog for a walk and call your grandma well done   Again huge deal if  expecting    but something mcy ds   Third service slow  Took 10 minutes getting bill leaving place wasn't even crowded  particularly annoying because bit hurry    I know restaurant just started at least its current branding      really leaving review hopes turn around  first few months crucial time blowing it  Maybe time locker room pep talk team back game  <EOR> Wow! flyer mail new cafe SLS good tonight only  Grabbed some friends check tonight what? aren't even open lol  replacing griddle  Good luck that <EOR> Our waitress Maria super sweet nice   But if weren't two free meals would complained   friend surf turf 29 95 she said flavor point but portion size ridiculous sweet potato fries excellent   ribeye full fat garlic mashed potatoes gummy  <EOR> Soooo much better Griddle!! menu much easier order you're constantly asking what   Reuben sandwich which amazing  happy redo  <EOR> This place hit spot!
