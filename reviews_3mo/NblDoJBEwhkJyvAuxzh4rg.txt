No point getting combo  expensive might everything may want try    The meat OK but die for  Small portion each meat order  range $5 $8  unless Kobe then  $20  also couple appetizers  garlic chicken calamari  Again die for  Also those worlds smallest fried calamari ever any restaurants ever in    Crunchy garlic sauce ppl raging about   ehh    The real reason gave 3 stars which think being generous because corner eye saw ladies cleaning table top dirty rag  saw wipe grill underneath saw just dust black muck rag  She then folds rag which thin wipes tables down it  Then booth chairs  ew  least wipe table top first yanno?   Oh! playlist played swear all songs 90's  DDR music playing made wanna play it  Hah!    I also admit kind miss goth bar prior being gyu kaku  Good times  ?´ Though renovation pretty great  <EOR> Lord knows many businesses come gone address over years Underworld Black Label Emergency Room etc   Its transformation into Gyu Kaku nothing short amazing   ultra cool lit entrance begged question   does Tron eat here?

Spicy Tuna Volcano block rice  fried spicy tuna top   Although best seller wouldn't order again   rice fried hard chew  seen executed better ayce sushi   Our server recommended 2 plates meat 2 plates vegetables per person appetizer full   initially thought lot food but didn't realize small portions would be     We ordered Bistro Hanger Steak Duck Angus Beef Ribs sauces recommended each menu   When meats couldn't believe fresh looked each plate came 5 6 pieces meat don't expect ayce full  more quality quantity here   also enjoyed 3 different sauces table could dip your meats in!  also additional sauces pay enhance flavor meats decided Crunchy Garlic Sauce   crunchy garlic red chili oil but all sauces table didn't find necessary   Everything much flavor already no need pay extra     For vegetables Mushroom Medley which came Enoki King Oyster Garlic Mushroom Spinach Garlic   Both good additions meat   come foil steam your grill alongside meat      Rice isn't included la carte ordered 2 bowls $1 95 each     I love don't smell bbq afterwards service beyond amazing!  definitely back try course menu HH menu which 5 6 pm 10 pm 12 am   Just mindful you're gonna pay little more you're used full  <EOR> If you've Gyu Kaku Japan New York City you'll agree 3 star rating  If your first time Gyu Kaku maybe would give 4    Having multiple Gyu Kakus before high expectations restaurant  staff restaurant itself great however food didn't live hype    Both Bibimbap bowls think would more appropriate call them stone cooked fried rice bowls rather bibimbap  no vegetables gochujang egg bowl  just rice some meat!   Kimchi Disappointing Meat Ordered skirt steak kalbi short rib  Good but special enough back Gyu Kaku for    If you're looking eat meat try different restaurant Spring Mountain! <EOR> 5 stars service! server Bank he point every thing  The food did take little long come did remind server  ordered off happy hour menu ordered shio ramen well   The shio ramen incredibly bland used work ramen restaurant two years countless other restaurants serve ramen but ramen far worse ramen ever had  Save your 7 dollars some more BBQ  sure     The meat itself BBQ quite delicious  Some pieces toro beef incredibly dry hard chew  I'd say try other meats offer instead I can't remember names right now    My friend s'mores dessert delicious great experience   Our total bill came around 70 dollars dinner two hungry girls  Neither drinks but did ramen along BBQ  Overall pricey experience food quality  probably won't returning location but said service 5 stars everything else wasn't  <EOR> Food decent   Service okay til finished n waited FOREVER checks   waitress overcharged friends $23   Luckily texts bank noticed before left   bf split Meat Lovers which comes w 6 kinds meat salad miso soup rice which ask halfway through meal cheese wontons they good but just dab cheese  not expected garlic fried chicken $55   I'd rather KBBQ n AYCE $5 more per person   sides extra  $5 onions?
