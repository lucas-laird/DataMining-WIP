Odd    The Roma tasted someone poured pound raw salt it  lightly salted meat cheese  bad sticking your tongue someone pouring raw salt it  saltiest food item ever eaten restaurant honestly   Salt overpowering wonder did pour entire bottle Garlic Salt it?   The Calabrese damn spicy hot  understand advertise spice but dish unbearable 5 Alarm  Please note put Franks Red Hot everything spice typically does bother me  painful eat spice heat overpowered any flavor taste pizza  using Ghost Peppers pie? stop 4 bites toss it  burning sensation stomach eating Rolaids now not kidding      Win star Arugula Salad  OK tasted just fine  Kudos that   The cooks need better training someone needs start managing guys watching sending customers  Sorry write but never throw pizza due being inedible  Feel wasted money Saturday night  made grilled cheese compensate fill bellies  <EOR> I tried place hopes would good all time favorite neapolitan pizza place Minneapolis  Unfortunately missed mark bit but still very good keep happy until back Minneapolis  standard margherita pizza just comparison sake  Everything tasted fresh only thing missing sprinkle sea salt crust  also chopped salad which pretty satisfying  Before returning probably try Settebello see which place better  <EOR> Being true lover Settebello admit myself truly impressed!! boyfriend mentioned seeing new pizza place wanted try it  skeptical would Settebello but first bite piping hot pizza    change heart  ordered spicy marinara lots fresh garlic whole roasted garlic basil spicy salami banana peppers  Chef Marc explained style pizza made eat certain way  asked extra crispy he said he would try best  sat down all necessary seasonings chef Marc brought pizza us  Oh man! Crust super crispy flavor just crust amazing! could eat crust alone! All toppings complimenting each other well  love offer spicy marinara! Because adds even more flavor pizza  Every bite eyes huge satisfied  kept raving good each bite!  Only thing could complain atmosphere  If more cozy restaurant where didn't feel just grabbing something quick  really Settebello's environment  lunch sunny day much better! But  only bad thing could say   I DEFINITELY recommend place any pizza lover  Don't skeptical know there's hardcore Settebello lovers but encourage try this  amazing! coming every time crave pizza <EOR> I'd give 3 1 2 stars could instead 3   twice White Pizza first time Pepperoni today   Almost every other pizza place area besides Grimaldi's Windy City would 1 star me   After reading other reviews think people misunderstand style pizza   crust fragile if many toppings but style soft chewy crust     True Italian Pizza crust toppings   more Italian style pizza place toppings meant more compliment crust dominant flavors when they're busy defeats purpose    I didn't any issues others mentioned but think  because simple pizzas   tip all if pizza heavier toppings ask little well done    The white pizza delicious!  Pepperoni Pizza good little bland but still good   definitely Grimaldi's better but solid pizza place     I'll definitely back because love convenience place since pizza done just two minutes    The service solid think some issues others due fact just opened   all restaurants start bang take little while kinks out     If you've unimpressed think deserves more chance  <EOR> Take Settebello imagine if Chipotle  Except patient explain toppings have  choose pizza menu but put less more ingredients  Great quality ingredients especially olive oil  If ask if want olive oil top must say yes! reasonably priced comes fast   Caprese Great quality cheese  salad giant  felt jerk enjoying cheese monster  good   Bianco Pesto Gorgonzola roasted onions fresh Mozzarella Truffle Arugula  If arugula lover pizza great  Don't mess adding much it  great its own   Roma Margherita Pancetta brown egg cracked pepper grated Romano cheese   egg pizza  Super savory   Naples Marinara Bufala Mozzerella  basil EVO grated cheese  pizza but always find myself adding pancetta olives it  should just appreciate simplicity it   If those coffee sodas watch because all super carbonated foam over   I feel sorry all people blindly walk into Smashburger passing place by  really good  <EOR> I love place  owner staff personal friendly! Each pizza personal size pizza  Plus only takes 90seconds cook  If haven't tried place GO! <EOR> I've 3 times week 2 times 2 nights  love concept food great!
