I've looking forward trying Khotan ever since social house closed finally check out   This review isn't focused food much everything else restaurant does right    We rolled around 9 seated inside facing TI Pirate Show  Unfortunately large very loud group next asked different table almost immediately taken loungy section restaurant seemed much more secluded still great view  some mellow music random trip hop electronica remember playing background dim lights give lounge very mellow secluded vibe  Some decor carry over Social House but all comes together really well  manager totally made sure comfortable new table even waiter made nice comment it   When pirate show started outside patio watch waitress later came let know food arrived  patio outside gives great view show below its way better crowding sidewalk sure winter when gets cold its way better stand heaters 40 degree cold street   Towards end meal asked waitress couple club recommendations all scene while she threw some ideas us  Even checked coworker give extra options which definitely nice   Unfortunately came already having dinner weren't all hungry  Ordered appetizer dark chocolate eggroll which rocked  can't comment much food since ate little but say obviously isn't traditional restaurant expect fusion style menu  Also if you're eating 2 normal adult sized dinners your gf isn't some anorexic considers tic tac a big dinner don't see place under $100   if just need put something filling cheap your stomach then chipotle wienerschnitzel  Don't come if you're super tight budget b c stuff adds but feel splurge occasionally place fun sexy    The service best while made experience excellent  didn't any snobby vibes it  manager even gave handshake way which kind surprised but also left good impression  Definitely coming back next time town  Hopefully much more hungry too! felt little bad barely ordering any food = Sorray! <EOR> Came friend's birthday dinner  cool atmosphere but super expensive food so so price pay  also super dark hard read menus  probably hide you're paying $45 few pieces steak    If you're right time Treasure Island's pirate show play right outside your window listen cannons fireworks off while you're eating romantic dinner  could good bad thing depending your personality  <EOR> Worst sushi rolls ever  shape size box Tic Tacs chewy rice rectangular layer raw fish top  Bland difficult eat  hoping same chef Social House restaurant now Khotan's spot because jalapeno yellowtail sashimi menu like amazing we'd Social House two years ago   jalapeno yellowtail sashimi actually excellent  rest meal totally downhill  When started walking upstairs table maitre 'd called Watch your step because if fall I'd laugh you  can't sushi some clueless staffers too  Don't waste your time if insist going try hot foods versus sushi rolls  <EOR> Not vegetarian friendly waitstaff lies wait staff no idea ingredients serving  take your pick most likely all three true    I asked waiter simple question Most miso soup made fish broth know if your is? He responded no listed ingredients  He reassured vegetarian  soon soup arrived tasted could tell contained fish broth  waiter apologetic ordered another side dish   As leaving spoke manager claimed he came table spoke during dinner  He not  left feeling place full bunch liars  would catastrophic if fish allergy instead being 20 year veteran vegetarianism   Too bad returning restaurant great view  <EOR>
