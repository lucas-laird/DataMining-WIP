Call 730 coocoo but used offer guacamole trio    anymore   ev! guacamole ok but needed more salt none  Can't just stand when restaurant fees food point salt pep needed    Well exsqueeze having such palate salsas ok  fave red one   Salt would helped  Also sure chips but chewy first review stated  main dishes  begin when kids sliders resemble three hamburgers McDonald's minus fact they're served medium!!! kid eats medium burger?? 14$ down drain  cheese quesadilla inedible smothered cheese couldn't let son 10 months risk cardiac attack sent back! beef short rib ish flavorful but meat wasn't tender could been! made bit rough enjoy  smoked brisket ok also just king bit flavor    I feel day coulda just clusterfracked day them being opening day  Waaaay many people your grill when your eating food just par  Prices quality ratio wack! really wanted enjoy meal but 100$ tab left feeling sick confused happened! Maybe ill come back year when pace gets bit more established  <EOR> Came dad unaware new restaurant  seated soon figured mexican restaurant once knew! But decided stay give shot First thing odd waiter told isn't traditional Mexican old restaurant  Modern Mexican! apparently Modern Mexi looks  Undercooked chewy chips pay extra for  Bad salsa No salt pepper  no combination plates  high prices service slow staff bunch pretty faces lacking basic knowledge good service  sent back plates twice cold meals didn't even discount check apology    Maybe just opening week?? But many extra staff hand  girl actually stood front entire meal because she nothing do   Which made both very uncomfortable  [You'd think much extra staff shouldn't kinds problems being slow bad food sent out ] ? Oh Well    experience extremely unenjoyable   Just visiting area staying uncle's never come back eat here  we advised wife stay away too! <EOR> Decided come few friends losing horribly bingo across street Red Rock  didn't know expect considering gone restaurant few years back when located Venetian received horrible service and food wasn't much better  sat bar ordered drinks bartender super friendly drinks very strong but still tasty  started chips salsa spicy guacamole  lot spicier thought would but still pretty good  boyfriend ordered chicken quesadillas share delicious such large portion couldn't finish it  place definitely redeemed itself since last visit everyone group enjoyed meal would definitely come back  <EOR> I sample many original appetizers guac salsa margaritas media night event patio  staff awesome made sure everyone try yummy drinks  plaintain empanadas tuna ceviche prickly pear margaritas delicious chips salsa guacamole   The decor changed while new lighting overall design bit more upscale miss old colorful look Agave  least didn't paint over hot pink exterior! patio still awesome new lighting some changes seating arrangement  Also new pillows maybe? They keeping video poker machines which told turned next week   I hope lots gaming promotions! listening Dos Caminos?? <EOR> Let start saying typically DON'T Mexican food   Which why Dos Caminos fantastic!   I've read some other reviews give 1 two stars want start saying space isn't everyone   typical combo plates overly sauced quick plates don't appearance menu   Everything Dos Caminos made fresh order tell! The Guac just most amazing things could order   them spicy creamy delicious spiced just enough burn but much where ruined rest meal   mini meatballs delish tuna tartar bites   simply grilled salmon perfect!  husband fajitas   Amazing! We ate outside patio which packed sat near mini fire places which lit end meal when sun down   No rushed enjoy coffee dessert  Any kinks service others experienced attributed new opening  treated well!  absolute back bring friends! <EOR> We came try Dos Caminos hoping great Mexican restaurant close home   Started ordering Queso Fundido which good except only gave 3 small tortillas 4 us   Asked more which brought   also asked chips salsa   which already knew weren't free   and waitress felt need start quoting prices   No doubt they've lot complaints having pay chewy chips especially high menu prices   The skirt steak impressive odd spice flavor   mexican street corn very good nice surprise   chicken quesadillas good   enchiladas suiza weren't great nor smoked brisket enchiladas  chewy tough   meat hard cut even knife   salsas tasty despite being served chewy not crispy chips   The decor atmosphere trendy but noise level way loud   difficult time carrying conversation     Was disappointing dinner overall especially over $100 four people only sodas drink   Guess didn't good Mexican restaurant hoped for  <EOR> I waiting looooong time open Dos Caminos  roommate DEVASTATED when closed Palazzo     Being lover your guacamole pescado tacos toured valley mexican restaurants while closed trying look place satisfy cravings     Successful? even close  But then heard news    Dos Caminos open Summerlin?  Uhmm    Thank god!! gas bill driving Leticia's becoming little high twenty something year old budgets   My roommate made date try your new location fourth day being open public   restaurant much different your old location but think fitting   Although miss wall skeletons old location skeleton paintings now  The food lived expectations   found new love pollo asado   sauce amazing   mean    wow   craving smokey flavors days come   guacamole just remember perfect consistency spiciness seasoning   trio salsas always delight but favorite habenero   chips good remember them being tasted sitting under heat lamp far long   The only reason gave your new location four stars instead five because restaurants ambiance   staff seemed some anxiety mild headache watching them run all different directions almost bumping into each other several times    Sometimes waitress would run table asking if everything ok but REALLY listen say  <EOR> Wife experience newest Mexican restaurant area   Having fan Agave which previously location surely thought must closed something better case   menu seemed somewhat limited did burritos menu quesadilla listed main dish   Mexican Hamburgers listed which just Tortas could Roberto's     We ordered some chips salsa nothing special them showed $3 00 menu   medium hot salsa more paste opposed regular salsa   ordered chicken fajitas $14 95 wife grilled mahi mahi tacos $12 95 three small tacos   waiter said creamy sauce tacos when fact was   service good but staff didn't seem knowledgable menu  wait food didn't seem very long but Thursday night weren't busiest   When fajitas came came 3 small tortillas which didn't appear enough fit fajitas ask more   wife enjoyed fish tacos also skinny margarita drink which good but she said little light tequila   menu little lackluster limited options   We under impression rice beans came both meals when inquired bus boy he said he wasn't sure because first day there   going tell first day well     All all food alright prices little higher would expect   interior didn't look much different Agave but maybe little more decor   outside seating area off bar several fire places which wouldn't bad place drinks when warmed little more   If back just drinks  <EOR> I excited hear Dos Caminos coming Summerlin  tried Palazzo few years ago loved guacamole    Walking    noticed hadn't done much renovating old Agave restaurant  still open spacious comfy booths all around huge inviting bar middle  Love outdoor space which would great cocktails appetizers    We ordered Guacamole Jumbo Lump Crab Chipotle    just good if better remembered  trio salsas good well accompanying chips crisp nice salty    Mom decided Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla which served open faced crispy tortilla  She loved    mean really loved    she doesn't usually Mexican fare  She even loved leftovers next day!   I wanted try little everything Dos Caminos Bocadito Trio  came two pieces each chicken taquitos molotes potosinas corn masa turnovers roasted pepper rajas spicy house made cheese pepita pasilla de oaxaca salsa plantain empanadas  found empanadas bland mushy chicken taquitos dry potosinas just okay  Definitely something I'd ever order again    We most certainly back close home would just guacamole salsa chips  then maybe sample those yummy sounding desserts! <EOR> If could give zero stars would   I huge fan agave restaurant previously family would come pretty regularly all changed tonight!   By far worst experience ever restaurant nice long wait table greeted sour attitude waitress waited ten min water another 30 min order food  crapy wanna salsa something tried pass guacamole keep company felt dinner quickly going down drain   The menu selection extremely poor sure call Mexican food      To seemed hour wait sure close since took 7 pm till 9 45 finally leave   sad pitiful over priced sorry excuse mex food  food cold way spicy something menu wasn't supposed be  took 3 times ask side sour cream brought rice beans table share when set table laughed !! Think bite wonder something supposed feed 6 people  When said something manager extremely disappointed everything she looked confused just asked if wanted dessert declined just wanted bill no apology deff nothing done check So never going back sorry say don't see successful business happing there  Come back agave !!! <EOR> I work just across street good default place right work co workers  Dos Cominos replaced Agave but since only happy hour can't really compare two   They great patio area however wish would offer better happy hour specials  name few 25% off Sangria pitchers $1 off margarita's $3 Coors beer  better deals Summerlin  least give 50% off appetizers   At time top places happy hour places but sticks around option  <EOR> After day hiking Red Rock Canyon parched arrived 3 30   kitchen open until 4 00 but nice enough open bar could drink  two bar tenders amazingly friendly few glasses cold water El Camino margaritas hit spot   Dos Caminos best  Guacamole Las Vegas especially some added jumbo lump crab   Also recommend Dos Enchiladas Mole Poblano Tomatillo Verde sauces Chicken Taquitos   Don't know opening week reviews but today great  <EOR> We group eight Saturday night  expected service somewhat slower but THREE hours!  worst dining experiences ever  staff knowledgable management apathetic when expressed concern  Two three hours sat waiting food kitchen filled chips salsa  menu extremely limited flavorful when your entree  definitely better Mexican restaurants nearby would highly recommend overpriced sucky service! <EOR> Our family ate Dos Caminos last night slightly nervous reading reviews  pleasantly surprised every turn  white Sangria fantastic chips salsa guacamole  family pretty picky when comes Mexican food thought wonderful  Service excellent  <EOR> Guacamole chips pretty good but tacos not  fiancé ordered dish she also pretty unhappy with  Lucky waitress es awesome fiancé liked dish  finished off chips guacamole she ate tacos took meal off bill   some good service   The guacamole really expensive though  $10 smallish bowl? don't think mistake again  salsas came chips also delicious  Well 2 3  But other tomatillo based am really fan those  fiancé liked though    So neither liked meal ended she liked mine enough eat then again she also starving    service good but prices high  <EOR> I am happy Strip favorites now open Summerlin!  tonight dinner girl friend definitely wonderful experience   First off atmosphere place made feel holiday decor gorgeous   Since perfect time year outside Vegas opted sit patio   ordered Cosmo Diablo which perfectly refreshing hint pineapple touch spice   main course opted Carne Parrillada fajitas which die for   end off ordered couple ice cream sorbet choices dessert   favorite flavor dulce de leche then mango sorbet     The food delicious totally satisfied Mexican food craving week  mention service definitely point   Staff very attentive throughout entire meal made sure comfortable enjoying experience   Next time coming brunch big crew  Can't wait! <EOR> Nice atmosphere   companion pork tacos which he said quite good   fish tacos bit rubbery both fish corn tortillas but tasty   guac good plentiful salsas chips flavorful   local reasonably priced back but perhaps select different menu item  <EOR> My girlfriends decided come down dos summerlin try because loved old palazzo  reservation but brought few joiners hostesses nice great booth near kitchen  waitress nice fun suggested excellent cocktails  ordered enchiladas delicious  Everything prompt good  Definitely going back! <EOR> Quite simply expensive offering  don't mind paying extra mexican food when stands out  However fair best  staff pleasant good looking but slow would beneficial manager stop table quick intro survey experience  would probably led resolving dissatisfaction better review    Started some cocktails some guacamole  drinks buck two more should but good watermelon margarita mojito   guacamole tasty serving size good two but definitely needed salt none table  also overwhelming creamy flavor mixed much sour cream something   The salsa trio brought table good  wife carnitas tacos which just basic bare bones street style tacos which definitely needed more dish worth price  brisket enchilada  $17 enchilada  happy pay but price definitely set expectations high  When came presentation nice came cast iron pan covered gooey cheese  brisket thin cut into long sandwich style strips layered bottom pan covered sauce  Great effort required cut through well chew it  tough reminded shoe leather  some reason though slow cooked but menu said smoked  three bites then just stopped eating because disappointed  If going remain menu should slow cook brisket until its soft enough eat  might wait several months give more chance but probably not  <EOR> If Agave ugly sister name would Dos Caminos   I hard time rating between two three star experience  But many downers three star rating seemed fair first time experience    I'll start good news mole enchiladas kids meal sliders corn bread skillet 5 stars!    Okay now bad news Having fan old pink decor Agave wasn't fan brown dark interior   music vibe felt more nightclub restaurant really loud no Mexican music playing which tells me   not your typical Mexican food restaurant   We waited 15 20 minutes table sat near kitchen which loses its charm if you're outside kiva near bar     Waitress seemed overwhelmed she more order taker friendly waitress   No smile no Welcome DC your first time here?  Let recommend       Instead drink having guacamole? No didn't order guac   Personally many restaurants Vegas should going way welcome customers recommendations off menu   Kids menu offered mini sliders quesadillas tacos thought menu bit limited   bring bendos crayons menu color always plus me   Food took FOREVER come least 45 minutes! But least semi worth it   Definately made order meals premaid frozen slapped together mess just fresh delicious upscale presentations     I ordered Enchiladas Suizas good don't think would order them again though  very spicy served New Mexico style flat layers sauce spinach cheese but needed more sour cream     My sister ordered mole enchiladas wow!  Those winners!  dish looked amazing zigzag crema nicely sliced julienne radishes     Kids ordered sliders yummy   I know because took bite then another!  other sister ordered hamburger which she liked woman hard please   Menu bit different your typical Mexican restaurant lots hamburgers choose from   ?   Waitress did no favors explaining slant menu restaurant would able hear anyway since loud   Chips three salsa's came out   Nothing fabulous salsa just mild medium HOT taste okay but watery   The winner definitely corn bread skillet!  OMG should adding appetizers menu offering sample side because delicious! Moist warm tasty bit creamy little bit spice perfect share   hidden sides section menu  Order sure!  Overall wouldn't come running back  Maybe off night?  UPDATE did hear back restaurant always appreciate feedback! All very positive  so maybe stop Margarita give Dos Caminos more chance  <EOR> I no idea Agave restaurant space before closed until good gal pal invited dine here   liked Agave cool decor ambiance including huge wooden doors patio even bathrooms all things intact change ownership   What's also same food just OK   What's different Dos Caminos small chain locations New York Atlantic City Ft  Lauderdale prices seem more expensive Agave   We had traditional guacamole crunchy veggies dipping Dos Caminos Bocaditos trio  We served complimentary chips three different kinds salsa tomatillo watery red salsa had slight kick tasty spicier orange salsa can't remember ingredients but didn't really eat it     Gal Pal guacamole veggies meal she liked just fine   trio which consisted two chicken taquitos topped some kind cabbage slaw two plaintain empanadas two molotes potosinas corn masa turnovers roasted red pepper spicy cheese salsa    trio listed menu priced $16 50 expecting six bigger pieces food  When platter served surprised small servings price   liked chicken taquitos nudged cabbage slaw off didn't taste all sour liked plaintains well   did care molotes only ate hoping would better didn't   just kind spicy tastelessness is word? When bill came trio only $8 25 must priced happy hour which good thing because dish worth $16 50   say service great sat patio enjoying late afternoon sunset   just wish food matched environment  <EOR> Overpriced      Drinks OVERpriced   Cheapest Margarita $9 bucks   Good salsa good guacamole   Very salty chips  Lame chicken taco's did them all  Portion size good either    but did finish them because would rather Taco Bell fancy taco's   Not impressed far but might give them another chance dinner time lunch certainly nothing special  <EOR> Almost didn't reading all bad reviews but glad did! spent 20+ years hospitality service industry must say food great service wast right target! your own decision promise won't disappointed! <EOR> Glad place moved strip Summerlin  lot better atmosphere same great food drinks especially chili infused vodka! Can't wrong guacamole! <EOR> Loved building Agave in  Would take visitors just see it  new decor doesn't thing architecture  Nice enough  son Easter  busy  Seated right away  Service great   guacamole chips salsa  Tasty  Then son enchiladas which told spicy  chicken quesadilla  son ate half greasy quesadilla because enchilada dish spicy he couldn't eat it  He loves spicy but he couldn't past five bites  few hours later he could still feel burn  waitress offered bring something else but he shy situation thought salsa  menu expensive limited  Disappointed  don't expect restaurant around long  Won't going back  <EOR> I wasn't sure expect but pleasantly surprised! regulars Agave which occupied space previously look relatively same some nice updates reupholstered booths cool lanterns hanging inside over patio   The highlights Mexican street corn poblano cornbread  good! husband shrimp fajitas  Although more paella tortillas awesome! chicken fajitas also good not good shrimp but cooked red sauce wasn't traditional fajita  also house made guacamole pretty good well   We Sunday night wasn't busy maybe 1 4 full service excellent  Looking forward going back! <EOR> Everything looks nice but lot aesthetics holdovers when Agave  lot other Yelpers excited place opening off strip but unfortunately failed live expectations  would give star except employees nice! Unfortunately happy hour menu unclear point sale system doesn't seem discounting anything correctly drinks aren't great food isn't any good  Everything ordered came without key ingredients like   chicken   just plain tasted bad  Probably coming back many other happy hour options area  <EOR> Happy Hour includes 50% off starters   prickly pear margarita ordered appetizer sampler which included taquitos bananna empanadas   also ordered chicken wings   food beautifully prepared served tapas     Two things didn't when restaurant Blue Agave wonderful trees greenery patio area created zones privacy intimacy   Dos Caminos cut all trees down thus removed character patio me   Then music didn't jive all food menu   80's WHAM! disco  no spanish flair music   very incongruent experience  left feeling restaurant can't decide wants Mexican tapas bar 80's vibe what?  Such shame patio  <EOR> The sign said open doors open  When walked 2 managers hostess standing talking each other  hostess said don't open until 4 it's 3 15 said well your sign said open she said yes open business but don't serve until 4   left  because managers nothing say won't back  bad aren't palazzo anymore because seemed lost class well customers  <EOR> Having lived area quite some time frequented Agave few times never really impressed  Food bland service very lack luster which why hesitant give Dos Caminos try  shopping same plaza decided give them shot  amazing experience  decor way better pepto bismol pink agave before  servers name he pro  brisket enchilada expected    better  really liked spicy smokiness  suggested prickly pear margarita wash all down  Also delicious  enjoyed fact your typical slop serve mexican joint  absolutely back friends  <EOR> I braised short rib special melt your mouth delicous! corn very good well  happy chips but salsa okay  stand delicious margaritas! back those alone! <EOR> Everything OK but prices high correlation food quality   bloody mary guac both looked promising but left lot desired   Cinco de Mayo street festival but opted grab seats bar because only 4 tables outside no seating plus music deafening   servers bar nice prompt   Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza draft quite good  <EOR> I hate say but VERY disappointed experience    Before deeper say guac very good but does save place any way    Lets start food  ordered version fajitas now saw cheese list ingredients dish meat cheese bad thing  did expect is mealy textured meat if defrosted wrong meat cooked flat iron no flavor its own puddle salty oily cheese disgusting  flavors balance worst dishes ever seen tasted  tortillas wet sticky side dry other mean screw up??????  Service started good delay getting first second rounds drinks but understand busy bar  fact server filled ice tea table away did bother fill water glass when empty good  But when she leaned across railing behind ask if wanted another drink where down hill  Three steps more she could table side  now forward telling server main course she takes away never see manager before could consider ordering desert coffee even finish second round drinks she plops check front face  asks Oh didn't want any thing else did you? WOW! never insulted felt being told 'Get hell out' life  mad could speak no manager ever bothered follow dinner   I am service industry work every thing Chevy's Micheline Star rated establishments far WORST experience ever had!!!! never return place!!!!!!!! <EOR> The place looked great but sat down downhill there!!   I ordered chicken tacos spicy could even enjoy them beans rice plain all ate taco    My fiance ordered chicken salad chicken over seasoned he only ate maybe half    Our friends ordered burgers actually said tasted great wish ordered but knew burgers Mexican restaurant would highlight!   To top off service slow took 35 minutes food arrive never return place                                          <EOR> Very disappointing  Where begin?  1  wife each ordered margarita both felt tub mixes buy Bed Bath Beyond better  Way sugared down way over priced quality mix  2  menu advertises a trio salsa's your appetizer meal but tasted menu should said a trio salsa's two tablespoons each   guess good don't much  3  music Mexican restaurant does need Mexican mariachi but hearing Berlin followed karaoke version David Bowie followed 70's slow rock followed another poor cover 80's one hit wonder made feel off strip casino listening house bar band bad night  4  Very eclectic tables wall art light fixtures somehow just didn't all fit together  5  better Asada tacos Taco Bell  wife happy Pollo tacos either  Nothing special taste all  Very bland   I could on  All $105 two adults two kids again crappy margarita wife I    I'd rather Agave  <EOR> So second time Dos   brunch  sure why many negative reviews     place  great  Maria server  She very knowledgable great recommendations  She original agave even remembered me    You complimentary cocktail brunch choice margarita mimosa screwdriver bloodymary coffee tea   sat patio  ordered 3 egg omelet chorizo  come back again!!!!  doesn't open until 11am  Perfect Sunday  Must go!!! <EOR> Hey guess what? Agave anymore   get over it!!! Every other bad review dings Dos Caminos being Agave  Let explain businesses work  Dos Caminos didn't force Agave close  closed because no there  If loved much should gotten your tushy eaten there  But obviously didn't now just accept two different restaurants  it? related  Cool? OK great!  Now  clear digress  Is service painfully slow here? Good God yes! most servers tiny bit stupid bored socially awkward? Why yes are  food still just delicious when strip? Yes indeed do! solid 3 5 stars  food really good  Great guacamole quesadillas chilaquiles also really good  <EOR> I read all reviews little nervous abt going  sure why now   Went friends  Each drink good  Tasted ordered expected margaritas mojitos and without Strip price tag   We each some version tacos  No complaints The fish tacos little spicy but sensitive palate   The chips sauces more enough three shared two person order guacamole little left over because food came before finished it   Sat outside patio  little windy turned fire place half hour sunset  As East Coast transplant always humored when 75 degrees = cold  Service totally fine waitress friendly quick meet needs more water shared dessert  Music '80s hits until abt 8 when dimmed lights put mariachi music  $30 piece tip shared dessert drink guacamole entree  Sounds average Summerlin  Really sure why many poor reviews  Agave once liked food but really don't see much difference  Feel others may splitting hairs comparing red apples green apples  <EOR> I've twice brunch great both visits  Each time service friendly very attentive  food tasty quite possibly serve best Bloody Mary's ever had  <EOR>
