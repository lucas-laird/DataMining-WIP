 Maybe but definitely won't way   couple gut bomb burgers I'd try because nachos pretty solid but prepare myself inattentive service   actually expected better something Guy Fieri's name attached it   One interesting thing beer prices generally $7 pint but 2 different Sam Adams cheapest beer menu $6 each   Thank missing Guy Fieri pricing guy! <EOR> The hosting system terrible  table two seated available 15 minutes prior when seated  Also 7 other empty tables lobby full people  Now maybe aren't asking first available but certainly did   Service far so  better much lesser restaurants but didn't trendy name behind them simply stand grub advice alone   We both ordered taco dish  Prices seem goldilocks cheap high    tacos okay mentioned other reviews little subpar but  come expect LV    But keeping water flowing glass shouldn't difficult    Now Border Grill bit higher price but oh gosh good   different but top notch    quality exceeded price     I'm glad tried just wish worth 5 stars  <EOR> In Vegas many choices but great choice  can't wait back  tried three different burgers dessert try cheese cake   better hungry   Looks he borrowed few recipes Television Series Diners Drive Ins Dives  Give try  <EOR> I've twice now few things review    Guy Talian Fondue Dippers pepperoni wrapped around breadstick  comes fondue dipping sauce which really good but breadsticks just okay    Nachos very different any other nachos ever had  ordered ours without beans jalapeos  chips little harder normal which think good because don't soggy all toppings  thing liked    each chip good amount toppings  other places where topping middle most chips plain  big portion three people could share easily    Mac Cheese Bacon Burger first visit burger then friend second visit  both same complaint   the macaroni wasn't even burger  When second half barely any    Motley Que Sandwich BBQ pulled pork pretzel bun  asked no citrus slaw but instead onions didn't mention though  Nice BBQ option   beware messy lol! fries very good!

Now those good burgers $15 huge tastes 10+ times better <EOR> The trendiness atmosphere place probably draw but overall just gets three stars me  Plenty presentation points food fairly good but value standpoint falls short bit  worth trying however  <EOR> I really wanted place but sadly let down  service ok mostly friendly staff tons them very uncomfortable looking uniforms food came promptly    Maybe little promptly  Presentation great but highly lacked flavor  fish tacos bland no spice factor all when asked some hot sauce choices Sriracha Tabasco  Uh    hell? Come Guy better that  buddy ordered chicken wings supposed hot should illegal but not  Bottom line factory food masses little no finesse where counts which suppose perfect tourist trap area Vegas  Guess should seen coming  <EOR> The Quad upgoing trend when comes hotel standard restaurants within it  Guy fieris restaurant isnt exception  fun unique menu combined great service all adds good experience  Portions presented cool way size leaves most pleased flavors twisted new way   It line early ready some waiting! <EOR> Went lunch weekday   Saw menu online looked tasty   hostess server great!  ordered Big Dipper wife ordered caesar salad   She loved salad didn't love Big Dipper   The dish itself good   love fries every imaginable fry possible   Regular fries waffle fries pub fries name it   nice touch   crispy onions great top sandwich horseradish point but man gotta tell ya prime rib just fatty   Listen know fat = flavor leave some good tasting sandwich   wanted bad eat all because flavor great   just fatty felt eating more fat meat   And pricing Strip going higher normal but even if sandwich perfect wouldn't $20 sandwich   I would again but try something much different  <EOR> Possible top places eat strip  Friendly staff awesome bartenders  food amazing Guy did himself once again  <EOR> When come not if must request Chris Anderson  He fun charismatic informative! He very knowledgeable all different dishes expressed own opinion  enjoyable experience all around! Service incredible!  However   the crushed wasabi pea sauce wings heavy parmesan pickles burgers sandwiches sweeter expected   Oh if decide 16 4 oz beer tour check ti sure your t shirt size stock   if yhey don't eill exchange size give size want when come back!  Bottom line dishes sweeter expected but service sweeter! <EOR> We big Guy DDD fans     this did disappoint   Staff fun very attentive   knew menu well offered suggestions  challenges advertised    had over them   reward card nice well   flavor town burger      wow great flavors pastrami cole slaw onion strings burger just right amount sauce   All look enough split     we recommend back! <EOR> Fish steak chicken tacos good but chili little spicy  Cleavage prompt service strong suit here  ordered  4 flights beer only two which came while still food table  ask few times other two flights  Tshirt came free beer 100% cotton but least design good  High noise level  Don't try negotiate contract here! <EOR> Had quick bite eat last night food good but wasn't fantastic   service however good all   server Shelby she attentive any way   She did ask if any questions menu nor did she offer tell recommendations  ordered 2 items menu 2 beers   summer ale hubs lager   She brought beers mistakenly gave husband's   didn't know took couple sips before husband realized it   ordered whiskey spicy wings drunkun fish tacos both good but wings spicy  server brought food laid them table disappeared   would nice offer couple plates     ask when she reappeared which while later  Towards end meal she did ask once food but soon she asked question she looked away check next table never looking back response   Finally found most rude she never thanked coming   She handed bill without saying anything!!!  same thing when she handed back credit card slip   come back eat but definitely hope another server would taking care me  <EOR> I've fortunate enough dine three times since opening  Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen located inside Quad Hotel Casino  If you're familiar Guy Fieri TV personality  see echoed prominently look design restaurant  Even attitude energetic atmosphere exuded employees represent Guy Fieri's style  course if find Guy Fieri's persona shows unappealing would place you  I've tried Tatted Turkey burger '67 Cajun chicken sandwich mac cheese bacon burger entrees  All awesome full flavor  Each comes fry mix burgers massive  mac cheese quite rich  Some might find much but heck theres mac cheese expect right?

Also serving board comes ridiculous  looks really nice but way small three burgers asked extra plates otherwise would end laps   Off Da' Hook Burger $16 didn't try but boyfriend basically said same thing said Mac Cheese Burger   Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos $17 didn't try well but friend said she really liked them even though she took all toppings off lol   S'mores Monte Cristo $10 thing rock hard!!!! use burger knife cut through could barely taste chocolate marshmallow way overfried  raspberry dipping sauce came really good saved being complete fail    Cheesecake Challenge $12 another huge portion eh  Cheesecake tasted something could buy Smiths Albertsons  Impressive looking but impressive flavor   Maybe off night everything being overcooked but overall another case where food looks way better tastes  $175 worth mediocre food  price isn't issue since portions huge comparable other burger joints strip but quality flavor just wasn't there  still think Gordon Ramsey's BurGR Holsteins favorite  would even prefer Bachi Burger   boyfriend didn't care maybe spoiled Vegas? But other three visiting Solvang CA really loved it  idk   try yourself guess! <EOR> OK line but tad early dinner park bar  great Tuna Won Tacos drinks  Love atmosphere dcor bar staff rocked  We'll back reservation eat some more tacos try few other things  Guy would say place Money! <EOR> What great surprise! live Vegas normally don't strip eat  But place does right!
