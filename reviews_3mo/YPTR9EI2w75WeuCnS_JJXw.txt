Looks good night but weird opened majority stores ready months away  Should decent option low cost food strip once its done  Low footraffic now <EOR> The concept fantastic  Pike Place style market smack dab middle Strip? wouldn't love especially comparison grandly underwhelming  steamship entrance fronted Bally's past    It originally intended open September but delayed repeatedly  week ago finally opened  Suffice say wasn't much less underwhelming past    Imagine four rows boring yet pricey stores much bigger your average mall kiosk  Unlike Linq architecture atmosphere quite sterile boring  looks nice night since stained glass roofts gleam lights indigo  daytime roofs look hot mess    Well disappointing    The Final Verdict  Pros Fantastic concept   Cons Fail tastic execution  The umpteenth location Sugar Factory Strip  Everything just blah   Huh? You guys aware daylight color scheme roofs doesn't match rest Bally's right?  Return Factor 4 10  Maybe might better summer  <EOR> While visiting Vegas short weekend getaway came new Grand Bazaar Shops which right front Bally's  am surprised find some stores place barely opened last week Vegas truly changes month month    I think great little shopping area opened really wasn't anything before except long walkway leading Bally's Hotel front entrance    But would say 40 50% stores still coming soon but am sure next time come visit which am sure distant future    Vegas stay away? busy booming  Anyways ton stores right next each other reminded Pacific mall Canada  Most stores very little space most stores employee just waiting front door trying some business  few stores 2 even 3 times size other stores but place now pretty much dead moment    And stores pretty expensive  stores walked into sock store  store some really fun socks like Superman Batman socks caps back each pair but prices pretty expensive $10 18 most     There waffle place Lionesse Beauty Bar Havaianas sandal store such  Towards back aisles guy selling artfully talented art work made use spray paints ripped pages phone book napkins other scraps paper each painting going $43 includes tax     Give place some more time more stores open place nice place browse around would nice more shade area though   <EOR> Even though half stores still open still fun time browsing new shopping area   stores uber tiny but great because essentially window shop entire store without even walking in   stores also pretty unique   nice see items can't find your everyday shopping center    looking forward going back few months checking when more stores dining open  <EOR> Similar Container Park lots small shops compactly arranged mall type area  Lots variety but currently third storefronts still listed coming soon among them gelato shop new location Bronze Cafe Ramen ya    Available businesses include Hawaii Cookie Co waffle shop Turkish Ice Cream along several boutique type stores Swarovski Alex Ani Lush kids luggage store? even sells photos fake Vegas marriages fool your friends family social media following    TIP bit confusing shops because there's no signage Bally's casino if just head toward valet area walk across street  <EOR> Checked new shopping area past weekend while some friends visiting  Cool concept but kinda swapmeet market feel just nicer  Very small shops all crammed into area  variety shops seems vast but half shops weren't open yet  still confuses lot places open new shopping areas half actually open  guess see when its all finally open  <EOR>
