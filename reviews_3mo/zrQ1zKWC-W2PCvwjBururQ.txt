Two guys kept blowing past tried attention  Finally waiting good 5 7 mins someone least eye contact guy said inside don't orders here  Ok   everything suggests do   but whatever mission fabled Dole Whip   another set double doors won't stop me   inside find fairly long line   which wouldn't issue if some sort organization divider   line probably 20 people deep blocking main entrance   so when lucky enough pretty close blocking doors continually stepped shoved aside drunkards jerks drunk jerks    Man  going taste even better because worked hard here! journey!
