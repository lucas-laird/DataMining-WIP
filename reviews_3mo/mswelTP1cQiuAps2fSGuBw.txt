I ordered bacon avocado cheeseburger thousand island dressing side  wasn't sure if would avocado thousand island  Turns out I didn't    The burger showed pretty quickly no bacon avocado it  Since paid extra items let them know problem was  manager then comes table sure hiding bacon avocado anywhere  Awkward!  He takes burger back 30 seconds later bacon avocado show burger  did bun used it soft no sesame seeds  other hand wife ordered standard cheeseburger pickles mustard only  Sesame seeds showed burger? am sure why difference      The fries ok  although little under seasoned liking  onion rings tasted leather coating thicker ex wifes makeup  No bueno!  Prices OK place clean  bonus offer Pepsi instead Coke!  Yay!   Still coming back though        <EOR> It wasn't worst   all say that   Nah say few more things     The menu sure little over whelming first timer  salads which all look really good tad bit pricey me  lettuce c'mon peeps    Now  regular cheeseburger very disappointed  burger patty pre formed boo cooked correctly but bun cold tough  no likey  Nothing burger made mouth water   I ordered burger onion rings  Some people them thick some thin  am team THIN  Don't onion rings if 'em thin  over inch half wide enormous amount breading them  actually need cut them able dip them into any sauce   cut whole onion half began drop them into frying batter  much batter onion barely cooked  Gross    I may give them another chance because friend Mark B  real burger lover promised take try burgers    I would recommend place anyone wants blown away awesomeness  Rather if you'd revisit leather strap daddy spanked your buns child order onion rings  <EOR> Went into place yesterday pick lunch office  dad recommended wasn't far work thought i'd give shot  placed order food relatively quickly to go     Much dismay when back work order COMPLETELY wrong  two burgers onion rings somehow turned into burger not even right one chicken sandwich fries  gave them call because didn't enough time lunch break back right order  explained situation manager said could come back day next would replace order me  told I'd back same time tomorrow try again    Went back today saw manager walked running orders customers  She remembered call order started right away  placed couple more orders other co workers she offered 50% discount new orders which didn't ask appreciated  still order mixed someone else which imagine problem yesterday well but caught time    Anyway enough that  food good  Jalapeno Burger pretty spicy but flavors good quality ingredients seemed above par most fast food  onion rings which source much debate reviews apparently okay  advice try them see if they're you  Definitely better fries though  boss said Pastrami sandwich great well   Bottom line new restaurant orders going mixed employees don't know menu very well yet  problems hopefully away few weeks  Management more accomodating when came fixing mistake I'd still say service good  food good definitely returning  Just sure check your orders before leave  <EOR> Man love farmer boys! pissed 1st review location!
