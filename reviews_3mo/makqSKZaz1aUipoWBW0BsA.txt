This corporate conventioneer's hotel   hotel obviously uber fancy Westin fare Mariott convert some sorts   window hotel could watch shady goings little apartment complex next door   people milling all hours night   guess air conditioner window units apartments no match 114 degree Vegas heat they'd rather outside socializing   The pool tiny hot tub free germs hopefully since nearly full strength chlorine water!  Luckily hotel just short walk Atomic Testing Museum   Honestly highlight trip!  Vegas huge compact version Orlando would become if gambling legalized within city limits   I say heavenly bed indeed heavenly   think provided 10 pillows some crazy number that   One word caution if even remotely sensitive skin repeat use hand lotion provide rooms   loved sage aroma other toiletries but contact dermatitis caused lotion more counting on   I can't say I'd recommend hotel price but said business trip getting reimbursed when all said done   picked hotel no smoking rooms fact Starbucks lobby  <EOR> GOOD comfortable bedding clean shower heads! BAD off strip elevators slow  <EOR> I'm Westin ite   I blame heavenly beds  stayed lot Vegas hotels over years favorite's include Mandalay Bay Hotel Hard Rock Palms during summer months for pools Westin winter months    I love Westin concise  Everything down main floor seems within reach unlike other hotels don't endure 20 minute walk Starbucks front desk casino bar  off strip hotel closer strip some strip hotels     if don't believe test it    walking your room Westin corner Flamingo Las Vegas Blvd  sure take less time walking your room Venetian Bellagio Ceasars down strip! The thing disliked place only food options steakhouse roomservice starbucks <EOR>
