Went morning coffee deep rich tasting hint chocolate  Seriously some best coffee tasted  also tried croissant which hot if oven  buttery light very flaky  melted mouth  very much enjoyed place look forward trying lunch menu! <EOR> I am happy place came neighborhood! needed it  Everything fresh delicious  stopped 6 a m  today roasting coffee right site baking bread! warm welcoming  great place just sit read book your coffee pastry  husband ride bikes Sunday mornings breakfast  <EOR> I came location quick stop Berlington Coat factory next door  honestly wasnt overly impressed place  felt staff friendly but only bottled water carry sparkaling water  staff seemed unaware sparkling water flat water same thing  ended getting hot tea which WAY hot drink over hour cups  paid $3 which average tea price  But no honey    I dont think would head back tea but maybe would try another drink there  <EOR> NOPE! NO NO NO NOPE!   This absolutely horrible experience    My friend stopped curiosity  Well  last time let curiosity decisions    No just kidding  Then would live life ?   So know says bakery right? When wasn't much baked goods  guy's excuse counter? Uh well time it? 6pm? all stuff morning  expect? Snarky eh? Well he didn't tip   The coffee  Cold cold cold  wasn't good all  cream empty sugar milk area unkempt   Ice tea? think ordered Passion Fruit Iced Tea   He didn't even know bag pull  Seriously man? know joking smoking little somethin' side but REALLY?  On top another man ordered coffee  other employee just kind wandered around store holding it  He gave finding THE PLACE ONLY 5 PEOPLE IT set counter  man upset coffee cold also  brewed new just him    Please avoid place  worth it  There's Del Taco same mall  I'd rather taco over place any day  <EOR> Four met last night Yelp Book Club meeting   very pleasant place meeting   large table comfortable chairs hold books drinks   enough chairs tables could added more space if more readers attended   The only drawback getting drink wanted which important thing   ordered iced mocha young man behind counter blank expression face What? Eventually he manager owner ? seated some people whom appeared he discussing business   My drink eventually ready tasty   bit more pricey some competitors but good nonetheless   same routine played during evening more people came in   order placed blank look ensued manager come over help getting drink done   hoot!  I would given only 2 stars but such good spot meeting award extra star   may stop again because sandwiches menu board looked good probably great lunch stop  <EOR> Great coffee house food selections wifi  <EOR>
