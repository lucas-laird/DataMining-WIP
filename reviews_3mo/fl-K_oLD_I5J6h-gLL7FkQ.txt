First review!  I've passing Checker's months waiting built could try out   know around Boulder Highway but never seem part town often     Going fast food joints first time generally try basics menu   Chances if handle basics effectively rest your menu should OK   Checker's just passing through all ordered two All American Cheeseburgers value menu $1 each     It grand opening Checker's pretty packed   folks filling dining room drive thru full   noise everywhere behind counter fries being dropped orders being mistaken   Very likely workers still trying menu items down since all new no issues errors time around   just need some time settle in   My order quick easy Checker's no time   Service friendly quick counter layout very similar those other fast food joints McDonald's Burger King Carl's Jr   What most different Checker's menu them stand wing menu   Yep orders chicken wings!  see why place popular bit cult status around parts town   burger some wings all same place   No other fast food giant offer currently lots success   just plain ol' wings Checker's 'Crazy Good Wings' flavor options Buffalo Honey BBQ Asian Kick hiya! Angry Buffalo Garlic Parmesan  The orders did see kitchen looked pretty appetizing   may try order next time around   Tasty   Checker's menu cross between McDonald's Burger King Sonic's   your cheeseburgers bacon cheeseburgers chicken sandwiches fish sandwiches   But also grilled hot dogs cheese sticks which Checker's calls 'Monsterella Stix' chili cheese fries   fries aren't regular tater looks seasoned somehow but look good   Another plus Coca Cola products!  If serve Coke then star book   Back plain All American Cheeseburgers?  Pretty basic but pretty good   Actually better McDonald's cheeseburger opinion   sesame seed bun burger which think flame broiled cheese pickle mustard ketchup   very similar Burger King cheeseburger which very much   Only thing would change would maybe more pickle add some mayo   looks probably back try something else   Checker's   now TWO locations town! <EOR> WONDERFUL!  waiting them build another location somewhere Las Vegas   hopefully closer where lived   moved side town week did open   what wonderful house warming gift!  first restaurant seen franchise in house dining area nice   nothing fancy whatsoever but nice sit outside blistering heat during summer deal pigeons tryna swoop steal delicious fries  <EOR> I spotted place drive other day started salivating  used hit location east side often could  Love those fries! group work promptly greeted friendly staff  Order relatively quick but wasn't quite good anticipating  Good but great  Maybe still working kinks  dined which first Checker's Rally's  itself enough keep coming back  return  <EOR> So start review saying Checkers just over sized Rally Burger! Anybody Cal knows exactly am talking right now  mean decor checkers red item names i e  Big Bufford its same    Now said does happy because Vegas does Rally Burgers  And    Anyone knows knows love fries Rally's  being said back Checker's   Overall burgers equivalent Wendy's eyes! Hence 3 star rating  fries carrying review    Seriously!
