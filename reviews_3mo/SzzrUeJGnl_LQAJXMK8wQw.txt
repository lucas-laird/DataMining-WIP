Beyond thrilled ramen shop Southwest!  Can't tell many times dreaded drive Jinya Monta but couldn't live without Ramen!    The decor adorable Japanese accents  restaurant only few patrons when arrived but daughter spotted couple seats bar  where enjoyed first Omoide meal  Menus served clipboards   Extensive menu little place!  hard time deciding order but being unusually cold day May knew wanted hot bowl noodles!  Although excited try ramen ordered Shrimp Tempura Udon daughter ordered Tonkatsu Miso Ramen I knew she would able spare few bites try ramen noodles well    also garlic edamame appetizer   Everything really delicious plated bowled beautifully!  soup super hot which little disappointing but enough send back  ate anyway honestly both very happy and full meal!    Of course service little scattered which expected new restaurant only its second day business but back check them they've more time used own menu + perfect service    Nonetheless EXCITED solid noodle option few blocks house  Woohoo! <EOR> This place just opened exactly area needed! tonkotsu shoyu ramen added corn egg it  Amazing! would taken photo but devoured bowl before thought it  back very often! <EOR> I am fairly impressed Omoide! Thank Charity posting pics menu  saw place just opened better time try then cold Saturday May night  made husband pick he excited he could stop Lee's if he wasn't mood noodles    They just opened yesterday when called first time no answer but finally answered able order  tonkatsu shoyu more tonkatsu shoyu but creamy flavorful  bit thirsty but assume just saltiness? noodles precooked box which could good thing bad thing  should probably offer option doing or  Luckily noodles cooked al dente when noodles soup combined wasn't bunch soggy noodles  bamboo pieces hard eat but definitely charsui  onigri ok  Nothing crazy but nice filler    Overall glad opening more places around southwest don't trek down Chinatown  definitely coming back when feel need eat ramen  = <EOR> This place rocks!  definitely regular being right down street  two things Pumpkin Croquette Spicy Tonakatsu Miso Ramen     Spicy Tonakatsu Miso Full flavor spicy but spicy ground meat great noodles!  Pumpkin Croquettes AMAZING! Two come order   Nice thin crisp panko crust sweet savory pumpkin inside   could eaten twenty things  <EOR> Food good  tonkatsu ramen very flavorful without being heavy  service very good well    Only thing think could better portion size  decent but left wanting just little bit more  <EOR> First off wanna say love decor place  Japan city restaurant  They've only opened less week place complete mess disorganized  literally waited 25 minutes ramen come wasn't even good  I'd rather wait 45 minutes Monta seated eat some good ramen    The kitchen backed up  brought appetizers ordered wrong sent back  gave complimentary vegetable tempura messed up  kept hearing servers apologizing kitchen being backed but yet servers couldn't keep cleaning tables waiting tables serving customers which didn't understand when there's 5 them since there's no food coming kitchen  ramen finally came 25 minutes later but still never wrong appetizer sent back other appetizer ordered  might give them chance months down road if service improves  <EOR> Ive waiting place open  Nice menu bit everything  Its only soft opening understand confusion menu  Overall just southwest needed  No need spring mnt  anymore  <EOR> Love miso tonkatsu shisito peppers garlic edamame server always around sure meal pleasant    definitely coming back <EOR> The best katsu southwest Las Vegas between 10 11pm!!!  We stopped Omioide waitress's recommendations Tonkatsu Ramen Katsu Don Konbu Onigiri Pumkin Croquette  Aside raw egg white Katsu Don everything palatable   then again most places aren't going merely palatable food options  didn't hate any items tried   but would certainly rather venture elsewhere  ramen lacked flavor literally thought first bite Well edible  favorite item Pumkin Croquette but even here isn't something could ever envision myself specifically wanting stop Omioide get  All around strong two star very weak three stars  problem exception ramen most menu found nearby similar price point much better versions     and ramen I'd rather trip Flamingo Spring Mountain come back  sounds little harsh but food certainly wasn't A OK   it precisely Meh  experienced better  hard recommend item served unintended raw egg but if find your way think would Katsu Don aforementioned Pumkin Croquette  Omioide took over old Rice Trax building fans quality originality food may enjoy themselves here    The interior more adequate price range actually really padded double chair loveseat chairs  comfortable certainly something don't typically find  While didn't particularly relish anything Omioide seems kind place okay part town teenagers twenty something's individuals don't seek great food  <EOR> This place exactly needed side town  see why harsh reviews isn't usual tiny overcrowded divy place cool douchy hipsters would prefer  Instead roomy properly decorated staff very nice food solid  Can't wrong ramen here  Very good waitress took time over menu explain us  very long way  According some reviews must've bumpy start when first opened waited long menu  long food god forbid happens grand opening! Pfft but point right now  back again sure  <EOR> this place just soft opening great menu reasonable price i twice alrealdy  first time the food took little long but worth waiting for second time food came faster better organized!!! <EOR> Cute exterior menu board interior decor really wanted place! trying people expect Tokyo but just FYI actually   which would totally ok if authenticity flavors there    menu good options but afraid lunch didn't live expectations  karaage wasn't seasoned enough needs more salt maybe crispier batter higher cooking temp fryer crispy outside juicy inside if we're trying avoid over salting should condiments side salt pepper table but wasn't   or least offered side curry powder mayo soy sauce side instead   maybe chili pepper could've option?   onigiri fell short also rice overcooked wet ume filling ok but price wouldn't typically point fault except rest meal wasn't tasty either  Then miso ramen wasn't hot maybe bowls should warmed prior serving? Because room temp when table ramen noodle different slightly overcooked  miso base itself rather bland more orange color typically maybe different miso base?  Overall everything ok best way explain all flavors mild  Other notes bothered multiple tables brought outside drinks no said anything as 1 table Starbucks another raising canes but maybe just casual?    and when apps came no utensils napkins plates? wait each entrees come them bring each setting since mine came first chopsticks but companion wait ramen eat app!   Finally no stopped touch table server manager see doing until waiting check server saw ramen touched much just didn't care any more instant ramen home  If you're area want quick bite fast food may definitely place you! But think you're might better off going Chinatown better meal same price if stronger flavors temperature appropriate meals  <EOR> Decor Very cute! something visually interesting every corner ceiling   Layout hate entrance!  Open doors tables  Customers including myself stop entrance looking left right hostess stand  none  Food only zaru soba cold buckwheat noodle Calpico   hard judge quality food based easy dish  guess say acceptable  Service Servers polite no long waiting periods  Menu OMG many different types Japanese food menu wonder handle it   order could ramen next could katsudon  cook s really talented switch gears that  Finally found several misspellings menu   addressed server he said he pass along manager  Overall fine   live close most likely visit again  <EOR> I waiting place near house!! Service great food even better  tried kaarage gyoza spicy tonkatsu ramen  definitely recommend place! <EOR> I absolutely love place  didn't know half items menu but server took time explain them without hesitation  food amazing love fun decor  <EOR> So other day check nice ramen noodle shop called Omoide off south Rainbow Robindale lunch  fact pretty close work      but everything else?  THE DECOR 4 5 It pretty nice walking into new restaurant  Lots seating really high vaulted ceilings made feel really spacious  lot Japanese touches even Japanese ads made feel kind fun   THE SERVICE 4 5 Pretty good service wait staff here  Didn't really wait long food refills water plentiful   THE FOOD 4 5 So let's down shall we? ordered app karaage think Japanese fried chicken nuggets which pretty good although kind karaage Fukumimi better  then Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen like usually Monta pretty good too  veggies pork chashu good but far flavor actual ramen broth really prefer Monta's ramen broth instead  Maybe because big salt kind guy dunno  good part though Omoide lot stuff menu udon soba noodles both hold cold katsu don etc  looking forward trying other dishes   *UPDATE* Omoide lunch again last week Tonkatsu Curry Don which really good    OVERALL 4 5 So if you're Southwest part town looking some good eats sure check Omoide  However if you're looking best ramen don't mind waiting then Monta Monta Chaya in opinion where should go  <EOR> Highly Disappointing   live right behind excited new eatery but won't recommending it   Maybe ordered wrong thing but should wrong thing?  shrimp tempura noodles potato croquette   tempura sitting bowl broth disgustingly soggy bottom time ate broth saturated tempura shrimp soggy batter  broth little flavor left sour taste mouths  never left Japanese eatery rushing home brush teeth until today  potato croquette ok if paying premium mashed potato blend  fried   all was   money worth it   Also both sick stomachs within hour eating there   good all  Service fine   only reason gave 2 stars instead 1 hoping improve but point would back! <EOR> I highly recommend ramen house  returning   [CUISINE] Ebi Tonkatsu Curry Don Really great shrimp curry served rice miso soup salad  excited curry skipped miso  salad light great flavor  curry medium spice which perfect me  don't overly spicy feel hides flavors food   Miso Ramen husband loved it  might next time but loved curry much sure   [DECOR] Very cute  feel outdoor japan pretty multilevel lanterns overhead showcasing vaulted ceiling   [SERVICE] Upon emptying water glass took less 30 seconds them notice offer refill  Nice  servers very attentive friendly  Lots smiles here   [PRICE] Great price  curry $11 50 ramen $10  charge extra eggs green onion which normal  quality food + environment place steal  back  Yum! <EOR> I really wanted give place 5 stars because its near place excited finally ramen spot within walking distance    however case   I Chicken Kaarage Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl  Both nothing rave about   Kaarage bland ramen came cold no flavor   I know just opened but its hard back somewhere didnt blow away  <EOR> I excited hear ramen joint near   service good but time took food come ridiculous   better off eating ramen spring mountain such sora   <EOR> I glad hear new ramen udon soba rice bowl place opened Southwest part Vegas  ordered chicken karaage shrimp udon  friend's gyoza sampled Spicy Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen    Chicken Karaage decent but would liked more seasoning  hate say but really disappointed udon  broth light thin weird indescribable taste it  couldn't figure missing  didn't care udon consistency either  prefer noodles chewy soft thick  Sadly better $1 udon market  husband said ramen just OK   The service good food came reasonable manner  didn't finish udon thought driving fast food joint but decided eat dessert home instead  sure if would return try other items  read reviews see things pan out  <EOR> I really excited ramen udon opening near house  But very dissapointed  noodles wasnt fresh all bit hard  best friend boyfriend both agreed  udon noodles werent even udon! udon noodles suppose thick noodles  only noodles werent good but broth too  Also claim close 1am but reality when 12am tell stop serving  <EOR> Recently opened restaurant located Southwest side Vegas  name restaurant Omoide Noodles Bowls says menu mainly consist noodles choice udon soba hot cold bowls few appetizers    ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere place itself deserves 5 stars  interior resembles lot Omoide Yokocho Sinjuku Dotonburi Yokocho Osaka  Just name Omoide which means memories having nostalgic moment soon walked in  Aw would just come just sit enjoy atmosphere   SERVICE Quick attentive friendly  Servers all smiling quick refill water constantly asking if doing ok    FOOD I craving some cold noodles Shio Buta Bukkake  Udon instead soba  Food arrived within 10 mins  looked bowl surprised simple looked  Udon tsuyu green onions few pieces shio buta side    The soup tsuyu saltier side but overall lot flavor even though looked simple  realized halfway some yuzu kosho seasoning made yuzu peel pepper salt  Citrusy refreshing shio buta  If Shio Buta Bukkake then advise mix green onions yuzu kosho together  more flavorful! much loved portion small soup salty taste    In addition bowl noodle also ordered tempura mix  Mmh  for $6 definitely worth it  Unless craving tempura would order this  Few pieces shrimp along vegetable tempura  just ok    CONCLUSION Would see more options menu  would see tsukemen added menu since mainly serve noodles rice bowls but just suggestion  return again! <EOR> Yes!!! pretty good ramen shop side town! very happy decor environment! awesome lanterns hanging very high  ceilings outdoor ramen shop storefront style seating area front! girls taking orders serving food really nice happy informative  Both back again very soon D <EOR> Short version review If give zero star would  Please don't waste your time money come here  Long version review made yelp account just write review  worst taste ever restaurant  ordered Spicy Tonkotsu Miso Ramen broth tastes decent but bamboo shoots taste horrible smells gross  don't taste fresh taste canned bamboo shoots buy China Town  thing upsets most Buta Shio Bukkake  girlfriend ordered nothing but udon noodles clear soup three extremely thin slices burned grill pork three sticks green onion  soup tastes boiled water oil burned smells worst thing costs $9! attach pictures end review  bad ask server take back  restaurant let order something else instead  ordered Chicken Karage Don which tastes blahhh best  chicken tastes bland miso soup came tastes horrible  tofu miso soup tastes hasn't washed prior cooking  don't understand serve food tastes bad customers charge price  ridiculous  Overall definitely avoid restaurant all costs if don't want ruin your appetite waste your time money  would even eat food again even free  <EOR> Update Second time around   much better! Seated quickly food came fast service great!  I tried udon instead ramen which last time prefer udon  broth better noodles aren't thick udon noodles sushi other Japanese restaurants  add extras wakame fishcake or tempura among other things    I'm also fan umeboshi nigiri which if you're Hawaii basically musubi ume it  don't see lot menus although very simple item love it! Probably because reminds home   I'm glad gave place another chance  worth it! <EOR> Wonderful service great food The hot noodles delicious service fast The atmosphere very nice feels very comfortable well <EOR> Great ramen place away China Town  Very cute trendy place  grated seated right away  Ramen great salty which best part  Same Chasu don bit sweet  We'll back  <EOR> I came opening day unknowingly time could tell just opened   I walked seemed really established  furniture new designed restaurant well Japanese themed decorations  menu fairly simple but if aren't familiar Japanese dishes then could challenge  knew most items menu but seemed some duplications asked them  waitress half answered question no confidence until she asked manager even manager's answer didn't buy it  still don't know difference between katsu don tonkatsu don  Then just asked few more items she continue going back asking them  know she learn time but thought knowledge items would something would well covered before opening  long she learns don't mind   The food nothing spectacular just par Japanese food  onigiri great all  beef bonito onigiri wouldn't order them again honestly unless lot time passed  ordered chicken karaage bowl comes salad soup  forgot soup when told them missing soup didn't come very hot red flag me  mom ordered spicy tonkatsu ramen wasn't spicy all  noodles everything else ok but nothing spectacular   I see major potential place help fulfill missing Japanese food niche Vegas  lot hiccups opening day but things turn around really easily  <EOR> Sooooo boyfriend just left place completely dissatisfied  Being huge fan Monta Sora wanted try place since closer houses    First service took FOREVER  exaggerating  couple seated next left because dishes taking long well  Anyways took them twenty minutes give first ramen dish  wait additional fifteen minutes pork belly miso bowl arrive  lastly gyoza came another five minutes  no communication between servers all  bill twice end meal     If service wasn't bad enough food below mediocre  broth miso ramen tasted came powder  so called udon noodles looked tasted hydrated ramen noodles  Both bowls oily well     Definitely NEVER going back  Drive Monta Sora instead!!!! <EOR> I short wait ten minutes seated   lucky crowd   Unlike others service very fast   decor being door street alley Japan   liked feel it   kind takes away   Decor A   tonkotsu ramen   broth noodles I'd give B+ but need work toppings   Chasu egg everything good but bamboo tasted canned type   If your you're going use canned bamboo then just don't   Also put appeared saffron top well   could without that   Just keep simple yummy   No need fancy  Over all place but seems polerizing effect people   People love hate it   Hopefully keeps getting Monta's crowd level   still think Monta best town  <EOR> This place thought would awesome Udon spot Hawaii but come find very disappointing    The reason why say because udon thick  pretty skinny udon also meat portion joke  ordered curry broth which very good actually but came pork belly 3 small pieces  literally small strip super thin bacon sliced into 3 pieces    The decor point service  Just need work giving little bit more meat portions  <EOR> Great food  Awesome choices  Good service!! <EOR> We Shrimp Tempura Udon Tonkatsu Shoyu  Also Gyoza   all just little below average   staff very nice   No alcohol yet   going back    going favorite PHO place instead    approve message J K KUHL    <EOR> This good place lunch  lot choices menu  But ramen just ok  broth wasnt tasty other places  noodles alittle weird  Next time ill try something else menu  <EOR> GET BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM HERE   consistency perfect its smooth cold hard same time   Its really hard find excellent superb ice cream consistency life place black sesame   Dont red bean unless fool     The ramen aight soba expensive   Noodles pretty good tho   fantastic day <EOR> Yes!
