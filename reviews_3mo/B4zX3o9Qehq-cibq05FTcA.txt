If could guys would extra  5 stars  above average fast food establishment   Auntie Anne's beacon happiness dreary day airport  spent almost 8 hours waiting plane but excited could justify splurging junk food because only option  admit pretzels  They're crunchy buttery outside warm soft inside   favorite Jalapeno but skip cheese sauce  tastes plastic  Otherwise    cheap airport food yummy line looong but waited less 5 minutes! Awesome! <EOR>
