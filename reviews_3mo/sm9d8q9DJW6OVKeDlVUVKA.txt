The UNLV Dining Commons great place socialize enjoy some good food  past very good but ever since hired new food service company working really hard prepare dishes different daily but still favorites  buffet style always something everyone    I new improved Dining Commons way better then old  staff nice managers walk around sure everything runs smoothly  super nice well  <EOR> If bunch friends cannot agree anything particular safe bet  used come inexpensive meal between classes  salad bar could use little more upkeep but varieties veggies toppings slim  usual pre made buffet items available those rush but if time option order burger chicken sandwich there  <EOR>
