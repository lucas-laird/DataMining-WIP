The staff friendly felt welcome but food just wasn't par     To start bread warm tasty butter delicious   Next lobster bisque which just ok   tasted more cream lobster   prefer more modern version lumps meat seemed tried though only two tiny bits lobster   Next Kansas City Strip Steak bone in    ordered medium rare cooked correctly   But looked hadn't trimmed well because huge piece fat side more normal strip steak should have    peppercorn sauce came good but steak just didn't any flavor its own   side asparagus looked white asparagus but weren't    claim jumbo asparagus also way off    smaller asparagus grocery store   ones grocery green throughout   béarnaise sauce good though   finished chocolate profiteroles   know supposed miniature cream puffs but boy tiny and only three them    Size quantity aside good   whipped cream vanilla ice cream middle though feeling straight box freezer   Overall didn't meal hoping for   flavors just weren't there  highlight meal using 50% voucher off main entree only Tix4Dinner Tix4Tonight    meal $75 before tax discount $57 after  <EOR> Wow    did forget Yelp Bally's Steakhouse? Oh    right cause wasn't memorable all  day walking strip ready good meal  Earlier morning Tix 4 Tonight office buy Blue Man Group tickets option buying dinner coupons available  asked person which place he thought best he answered Bally's Steakhouse  decided pay extra 3 dollars person 50% off any entree    Cool right? Instead $40 Fillet Mignon if $20  go  walked restaurant each class champagne  love Vegas    plus star  seated order food  course Fillet Mignon  literally piece meat plate  No sides no nothing  Fail plating  order sides separately they're $6 each  Really??? Come on   lame  ordered mushrooms sides rather good although slightly salty side  add staff really friendly helpful    I would NEVER back place if didn't entree coupon  Actually don't even know if would ever coupon again  don't think worth going to  Nothing write home unless prices  <EOR> Ok here's deal! know Bally's older resorts strip  heard brunch fantastic  really never heard very many things actual steakhouse good bad  Well let put this    I've much better terms service food atmosphere!  Ok now good stuff food! Having many steakhouse's around Vegas matter many others around country didn't hope very much  It'd comparing BMW Chevy  Both great but details matters! Now knowing looked place Chevy mid level steakhouse catering more family crowd    To start house special bacon wrapped scallops over bed red pepper salad? Hum  think more bacon wrapped scallops over few silvers red peppers  Scallops great but just needed bit more substance    The second appetizer lobster bisque  Everything ok but seemed more lobster meat needed    Now steaks rib eye's solid  Nothing really negative write about  Just usual suspects  However couple things worth mentioning lack flavoring various sauces offer diner  Since 3 eating thought we'd mix match sauces offered  ordered red wine green peppercorn morel mushroom sauce  quite honest all tasted same! Heavy cream no honest flavoring various ingredients    Just classic steakhouse's side dishes all al la carte  being said potatoes ho hum sauteed spinach well least water should drained bit fries? think frozen  Oh well? do?    Now service   Very polite but would say need take page service 101  i e  being polite only much while knowledge food all way! being said servers did know sauces asking about    just referring listing have    Promptly correcting error key great experience but none   wrong sauces brought us   no apology   a steak someone ordered returned kitchen being kinda off    no apology   asking specials were   did know      With city filled great steakhouses might think twice before coming again  <EOR>
