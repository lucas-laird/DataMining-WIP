<EOR> Wow  glad there's more 3 options     broth super tasty  pork lovers heaven  All pork everything  <EOR> My husband wanted try new ramen place he'd read reviews one   When stopped place crowded but managed seat    After good look menu orders placed   shio ramen small but flavorable couple big pieces chashu pork   half boiled egg still slightly runny noodle call true ramen noodle least used getting Hawaiian Ramen shops   Overall good bowl soup but didn't fill order extra sides large you're gonna leave hungry  <EOR> Ordered chasu ramen $9 mini chasu curry $2 85 gyoza $3 75 food service 4 5   Prices decent   restaurant bit hot seating very drab and hard    Parking along back restaurant   all in all could see myself coming back Ramen Sora Waaaayyy better Anime Ramen   <EOR> Tried shio ramen along side order curry rice   sitting down order taken quickly hot tea topped off three times before meal arrived   things started going downhill bit   move myself different spot table because dark couldn't see bowl     The first sip bowl ramen did trigger all those wonderful memories good ramen experiences   shio ramen broth definitely lighter texture unlike cup noodle soup   know say stock over 24 hours boiling black pork bones   But taste definitely infused concentrated tastes variety vegies   taste hung around long palates deep seated taste savory fats but something more MSG concentrated condiments   If shio ramen oil painting believe served water colors   tongue confused thirsty soup now needed tea stopped coming   The high notes vegies did stop there   curry curiously strong carrot tomato paste taste unlike any Japanese curry   end ask waitress chef Japanese?  Like all foods made instant condiments chemicals actually tastes pretty good   any evidence food didn't through long hours preparation if offended anyone particularly owner chef apologize   But challenge tradition good ol' bowl ramen convenience offering customers hey if think light stuff heavier if heavy stuff thin down etc perhaps wishy washy   Take stance Ramen Sora's take shio ramen should taste present That  <EOR> I decided stop friend mine said someone Ichiza said place better than    well better ramen house seems started new ramen trend town   long time until recently duke they've set gold standard purposes review calling them the other ramen place    all know talking anyway   review comparison review   Sorry but only way know review ramen joint time Ramen Sora holds own!  The building lot more spacious other ramen place   more comfortable     There's also 15 minute wait   case  good thing   other ramen place service fast friendly professional   I ordered spicy miso extra chashu   broth very flavorful!  Much more savory other ramen place   lot less salty   spiciness only little kick I eat lot very hot Thai food though but enough give well rounded flavor thick tasty broth   If problem salt levels other ramen place might your restaurant   noodles better thought   thicker meatier    Very well prepared   chashu tender if soaking broth all day   fell apart chopsticks   Yum   chashu slices little thicker other ramen place although perhaps quite tender     I may dare say overall quality ingredients little higher other ramen place   definitely more bold flavor profile least miso   love both places really which should say lot Ramen Sora   bottom line Ramen Sora added new flavor town worth while check out   may become your favorite ramen house town but think definitely great addition   Thank Ramen Sora! <EOR> Consistently outstanding Sapporo ramen 5200 miles source!
