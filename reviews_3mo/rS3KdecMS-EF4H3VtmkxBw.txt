I love Angelina's pizza  pastas pretty good but pizza really stands here  prices reasonable well  Only thing would change servers cashiers  friendly opinion kinda come off we don't really care type  If wasn't service Angelina's would definitely 5 star treatment me   $8 99 pick special which includes 16 inch topping pizza type deal   Killer pizza always keeps coming back! <EOR> We ordered first night Vegas then delivered within hour hotel  ordered garlic balls small stromboli small pizza   The garlic balls awesome never those before if husband could just ate those entire trip think he might have   The small stromboli could fed 3 4 people lasted 3 meals way yummy pizza sauce dip in   The small pizza huge lasted husband 3 meals too   We definately going order next trip Vegas nice quiet night recovering  <EOR>
