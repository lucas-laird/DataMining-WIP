My boyfriend took 25th birthday very nice dinner   food great service great ambiance lacking   little depressing hip all   view huge flashing billboard all see   kind kick though because kept flashing screen cheesy Clint dude whose face appeared literally everywhere turned whole time Vegas   kidding turn around mug right there   cab he's back seat front you!  Open brochure lo behold there's Clint!  Clint laughing throughout dinner I swear Clint two bottles wine had      I've better food steakhouses before   lamb chops pretty fatty but very tasty   boyfriend loved steak   service absolutely amazing though   Probably best service ever   All all very nice experience  <EOR> Sort boring atmosphere sort boring location   First off serve bagel chips salsa start waiter certain point signature starter   bagel chips fine but salsa certainly tasted store bought   place dug itself hole early   The steaks good although bit pricey side   Every steak comes world famous mushrooms which salsa tasted jarred button mushrooms   pool butter formed around edge side mashed potatos   So good food but honestly I'd rather just Outback casino next door same steak $10 less   Range worth total lack atmosphere  <EOR>
