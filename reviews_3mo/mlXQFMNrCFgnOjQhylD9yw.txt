I guess place new couldn't find existing review page it    decided own  much needed  boyfriend bit hungry decided share something  decided pizza price decent    $13 sandwich   When register greeted  freakin' three men behind counter pretending work chatting away each other  them even passed register couple times without acknowledging us  boyfriend wanted leave but didn't want spend much food pizza sounded good me   Finally guys washed hands took order but five minutes register! Anyway ordered #5 small cheese pizza drink buffalo wings  food sits under lamps but still    tasted pretty good  Fine  star that  Otherwise unfriendly employees  Bad service  place definitely worthy anything other star  sorry but Pizza Hut Express should try harder next time  <EOR>
