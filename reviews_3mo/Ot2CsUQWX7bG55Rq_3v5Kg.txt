We happened find place opening day today worth drive we're North Vegas   lunch  food excellent plentiful restaurant clean beautiful service well they're still learning but they're very courteous  bet they'll hang waiting guests within week  As today cash only probably waiting credit card machine husband small budget  decided share entree thank goodness did  appetizer meatball wraps huge! thought just getting two wraps but instead plate paper wrap them huge plate meatballs noodles huge stack greens including fresh herbs cilantro thai mint? something else   entree equally fresh BBQ pork rice spring rolls bed fresh greens other veggies  Everything tasted wonderful! also tried some exotic though non alcoholic drinks made something lychee like smoothy type drink  Both great  All total $19 + change  We plan coming back often possible  <EOR> Fresh Fresh Fresh ingrdients brought back again again  this place just opened three times 1 week  great food  Really love BBQ Pork rice noodles fresh coconut juice  Yumyumyum  <EOR> I've eyeing place couple weeks each time stop Greenland Supermarket   decided give try today     The dining room sparsely decorated pretty clean probably nothing would deviate you'd expect any other typical pho joint   thing noticed booths really wide just case you're really wide person    190lb frame swimming space between backrest edge table  Anyway     I quickly seated handed menu   looked over decided wanted then closed placed table   few minutes later service came over took order large special pho #11 spring rolls regular iced tea   order figured would give baseline which judge experience   Withing few minutes spring rolls iced tea like strong lipton green came out   rolls served peanut sauce nicely garnished grated carrot radish?    Standard fair think    pork inside roll prominent flavor over any shrimp present   greens fresh peanut sauce good   At point started noticing small array condiments table big bottle sriracha bottle Lee Kum Kee Hoisin sauce 2 3 empty dish ground chili paste two types red rose colored vinegar soy sauce   fact noticing table because pho wasn't yet      Actually starting think forgotten about   probably close 10 minutes until came out    long ass time compared other pho shops used going where front within couple minutes ordering it   The fresh condiment plate seen nicer basil leaves kind bruised wilted looking probably came near bottom basket   Thai cilantro lump bean sprouts sliced pepper wedge lime all looked fine   The pho broth sweet side very fragrant clear oily all nearly still simmering   Meat lovers your place!  guessing close full pound protein bowl   nice chunk tendon couple bites tripe     probably eight slices rare steak good portion brisket fatty flank  Oh meatball too  fairly hungry but couldn't finish all   Personally would liked better balance between noodles beef but surely appreciated generosity     Other delay getting pho service very attentive   asked twice meal going iced tea refilled regularly hot chili oil provided promptly upon asking   noticed service also very kind helpful some other people less familiar Viet menus    always nice see   When check came just over $10!  forgotten sign front offering 10% off grand opening   accept credit debit cards which nice   Overall gotta give place strong review if four stars very solid three 1 2   some details need some attention but surely appreciate quality to value ratio friendly service   hope new place does well location   Give try  <EOR> The best Pho Vegas now! PhoQueen Lily D  right place   The first thing noticed noodles actually some flavors noodle  No other place Vegas tasted did notice this  really stood me  broth very good well but still could better  But flavors noodle forgivable    As half way done through bowl noticed included  ngò gai culantro mom calls fresh smelling vegetables I  prefer aromatic vegetable over basil any day  favorite vegetables add food since just everything taste smell better  only place Vegas far tried this! guess restaurants exclude keep cost down  give Pho Village credit including this   The banh xeo came perfectly  Golden crispy yellow  didn't bean sprout crazy Hue Thai but filled good portions meat  coming back when craving banh xeo   The only disappointing dish cha gio egg roll   couldn't put finger exactly wrong it  oil fried in? filling sure  But just didn't taste right  Maybe bad batch maybe secret ingredient taro  root  Likely won't ordering again   Like most Asian restaurants very little no service  place isn't exactly nicest cleanest place but its forgivable  flag off waiters if needed anything  nice plus served hot tea instead just water  10% off meal sure why  no didn't flash Yelp badge!   Pho Village pays close attention detail which sets apart being another Vietnamese restaurant  definitely place return to  <EOR>
