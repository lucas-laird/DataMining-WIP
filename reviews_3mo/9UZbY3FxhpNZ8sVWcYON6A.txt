This location just opened recently   quite surprised when walked in   location thought surely would full off all sorts trashy people   Turns biggest ruffian whole place   The food much better remember last Cici's experience   didn't even feel puking left   Maybe  because kept 4 plates time   As always staff friendly you'll big Welcome Cici's upon entering building   Stop just don't forget your coat tie! <EOR> I give place 4 stars  third time eating here  Trust if don't pizza don't return  nearly best pizza ever had  pizza pasta buffet less $5 head expect?  I am tempted give only 3 because first experience but good inexpensive fun place bring kids   dream come true  would recommend take but if sit wait pizza come hot fresh great!  They also chicken soup all types pizza imaginable  If food snob don't bother  If variety comfort foods definitely place go  Kids love it! <EOR> I would give 2 stars just because quality funny feeling your tummy wards     but workers just nice  WANT create pizza just you!!  I guess can't complain much all eat pizza buffet $5  If you're eating healthy seek else where because even salad limp all its dressing    I don't think finished single piece entirely hate wasting food but just couldn't bear down    advise come when your wallet sad your stomach empty when feel no give want! <EOR>
