Long happy hour  frequenting  Thank great experience <EOR> I've waiting place open since close house  drove other night see some people bar excited know finally open    My friend yesterday some food  Starting service good  water cups always filled checked lot  Although some points bit incessant  But if rather over top service no service all  Plus only table awhile  server Deena made things bit awkward  just lot awkward silences always seemed she whispering but look past that    As far food felt more appetizers choose then entrees  Which probably good thing because appetizers far better entrees    We started Portobello fries crispy gnocchi  fries thick slices Portobello lightly breaded then fried  They served ranch some other sauce falling remember  crispy gnocchi Italian sausage pesto peas walnuts  While good unless piece sausage every bite dish lacks bit salt    For entrees offered turkey cranberry sandwich well jambalaya  don't know o expecting turkey cranberry sandwich but just expecting more  While cranberry sauce good added quite bit overpowered everything else  version little more spruced spinach brie cheese  However cheese wasn't spread all just slice middle  only two really good bites sandwich  far jambalaya decent  good flavor but just needed more  war very mild tasting  Chicken conned ti perfection though moist ! No sausage jambalaya thigh  All all would back ? Probably  closest place eat next house  probably stick just ordering more appetizers next time though  <EOR> They did great job remodel really enjoyed decor   patio super cute definitely want take advantage when weather little warmer  food good but agree another review appetizers better entrees next time think just apps cocktails    The staff all seemed new working restaurant bit nervous   felt server much casual conversation felt border line inappropriate dining   few little kinks need work example didn't chiller when ordered bottle white wine but sure things keep getting better longer they're open  <EOR> Everything delicious! place does dissappoint  staff very attentive friendly  most definitely coming back!!! <EOR> Delicious food great service  only complaint menu very limited  worked tailor house salad  group salmon loved would try recipe chicken  Definitely going back! <EOR> I date nights causal wine sipping numerous times since opened even month ago   I'm very impressed Sparklings  I waited months months open even asked when opening construction worker once It truly amazing remodel done inside building  inside used private hibachi rooms goodness sake    The ambiance former sushi joint  is now updated posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge  Whatever hell means just made up  Sounds weird huh?

Why ask would prefer considering ones inconvenienced    I hope does improve back another time over weekend perhaps see if better experience  <EOR> So impressed place!  food atmosphere service top notch   just short drive away definitely see returning regular basis   Caprese salad delicious grilled chicken avocado sandwich boyfriend ordered   He said best he ever had!  good!!! <EOR> Went Barstaurant first time tonight enjoyed ourselves! Tried several cocktails Citrine Chandelier Emerald loved them all  ordered couple soups multiple appetizers let down  bacon date wrapped meatballs delicious   The decor trendy cute  Servers friendly maybe even little much so   only reason subtracted star because strong smell chemical cleaner air  smelled sprayed cleaner all over then wiped bar rag sitting while  If place address smell issue 5 star sure! <EOR> Great late night food! hard find good food not bar food 11pm even Vegas  food excellent music good definitely return  Oh Jose great bartender very friendly! <EOR> I agree some other comments   Food pretty good but overboard service   waiter management made many visits table   Kind annoying   Its tad stuffy neighborhood joint   think décor low noise level that   Oh add burger menu   What's American eatery without great burger?
