My wife wanted try new place out   am glad did   The restaurant located kinda outskirts Chinatown   located within Koreatown mall complex   Unfortunately alot activity within mall   did think very good location restaurant    kinda way kinda hidden  If facing mall right corner slot   As walk pretty nice place   However alot patrons when granted just opened      The menu selection huge   ordered glass water thai tea banh kho bun bo hue pho dac biet   Okay water tasted bleach   Yeah did over well   Great thing mentioned manager she gave free bottle water instead   very sweet her   The Thai Ice Tea good   Little bit rich however just poured more water less powerful   My favorite dish banh kho   patties topped some fried onions shrimp other spices   wrap patty lettuce mince herbs etc   dip into some fish sauce   great   Only issue did give enough lettuce   Wish did   The bun bo hue okay   spicy   Such shame!!  wish was   Also disappointed did pork feet   Hey man say????  My wife tried Pho Dac Biet   She said good   broth very tasty better most places   As service really good   Since only ones restaurant great service!  As price bit more expensive most vietnamese restaurants   guess charge more because distance less clients     Overall wife really restaurant   Service excellent food bad actually above average good price okay   Personally think better vietnamese restaurants china town   We would back!  Thanks enjoy <EOR> My bowl overfloweth vegetables am thankful! Yes special place stomach pho spots vegetable pho right menu vegans listen even pho veggie broth menu! don't try explain them want  already it!  I prefer made meat broth but see lots green things floating around Pho Saigon delivered table  think eyeballs popped little when saw just many vegetables there  hard fit spoon into bowl between celery broccoli carrots bok choy tofu    The noodles good consistency pho broth solid  brought individual plates pho fixings which thought nice touch  fixings looked pretty fresh  also two size options  small always more enough me    The service very friendly     Next time want broccoli pho short list options  <EOR> I came back try pho  They've open few weeks figured would good time visit time iron stuff out    I liked pho actually  noodles blanched properly wasn't overcooked broth  bit less spiced sweet Pho 1 where normally but broth decent  plentiful noodles meat pretty filling    Not bad  another good work lunch option  <EOR>
