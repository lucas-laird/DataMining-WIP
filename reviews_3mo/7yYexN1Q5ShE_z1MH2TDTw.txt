A student recommended check place since down road work   yesterday craving something yummy different found it!  The owner working day total sweetheart neglected meal help I came 5PM lunch    he offered suggestions very helpful settled Pastrami meal fries = cheese pastrami chili jalepenos   yum   enough 3 meals least both chef back offered boxes grin   also free refills coke while tending drive thru person massive fresh lemonade refilled while waiting order! impressed   A cute family eating while little girl told pretty   pretty much made day   know eating fries meal delicious all but come back try some sandwiches because sound outstanding!  Definitely good experience back!! <EOR> Ordered pastrami sandwich am sure if lives hype  lot meat but $9 00 just sandwich alone  am really picky when comes pastrami because thick juicy just way New York City  also Italian roast beef onions peppers side au jus  beef tender flavorful which accented onions peppers  au jus made even better  would give more stars if price little bit less  More likely would back try something else  <EOR> Wow must delivery service killing!!!! <EOR>
