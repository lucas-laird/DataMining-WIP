It's long review  Basically STAY AWAY!  In struggling economy would think businesses would strive give good service stay afloat  Denny's    My husband asked if he could switch pancakes piece toast  waiter returned positive no manager She said if could come see may explain your situation then she may consider it  Please include 200 word request well  They gave toast pancakes added  99 bill  The place filthy  pancakes obviously sitting around cold  I asked waiters bring something  saying yeah left never seen again  We half way meal  spoke manager could provide owner's name  complaining all above she shrugged said she sorry turned around   This hellhole would prefer McDonald's  eat excuse restaurant  <EOR>
