Six pieces CA roll instead pictured three pieces five pieces tempura shrimp onion potato zucchini carrot presented before along chicken teriyaki tonkatsu      We initially thinking adding roll order since some unique ones piqued interest   But seeing order come knew couldn't finish all   Service good waitress very pleasant refilled beverages needed   steady stream customers started coming little noon Friday started fill slowly    Overall pretty good experience based lunch bento box   solid 3 5 stars     We'd definitely return try some unique rolls Your Daddy? roll Spicy Yellowtail inside Yellowtail Jalapeno top Ponzu sauce $13 50 Heart Attack roll Spicy Tuna Cream Cheese Jalapeno Deep Fried House Sauce $9 50   <EOR> A random splurge lunch Bento Lunch meal salmon terayaki beef six California rolls  came miso soup white rice weird salad ginger carrot dressing  9 95  Big portions but always sushi left feeling quite topped off   I sat bar brother nice atmosphere very conducive hanging teaching younger generation order use chopsticks all that    Major points off running credit card because 'under ten dollar minimum'  9 95?
