Each burgers come salad fruit sweet potato fries   enjoyed side salad but dressing I think some type vinaigrette pretty bland   I'd prefer more seasoning dressing   The Ahi Ahi tacos also pretty good but $9 50 wish came some type side   Three small tacos sitting middle large plate less visually appealing  felt bad tacos looked pathetic small   However tacos nicely prepared although slightly underseasoned tuna good quality   sure I'd order again   I can't wait back try organic breakfasts juices and eat 500 more black bean burgers    better move!
