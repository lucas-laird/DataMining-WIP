Our waitress friendly dressed Japanese school girl up interesting  She suggested ordering few things then maybe ordering more if we're still hungry  first round fried shrimp ahi poke beef skewers sushi salad  fried shrimp wrapped shredded phyllo noodle then fried  Pretty tasty  Ahi piled top bunch shaved daikon which unremarkable  However Ahi spicy fresh firm  beef skewers finely cooked but just ok  wasn't anything wrong just plain  Simple good but boring  thought sushi salad could more inventive  quality fish great but mixed into appeared industrial restaurant salad know iceberg red cabbage carrots  finished four starters enjoyed drinks decided needed salty greasy finish off       We then dove into french fries spicy aioli dragon balls! dragon balls interesting say least  Two spicy tuna meatballs breaded fully cooked  flavor nice but breading really hard  border being able cut    The fries hot salty just wanted   overall liked place  hope word gets more people show up  If back would try korean bbq something different  <EOR> Well some good points some good   gave 2 because whole description felt like Meh   I heard some good things Match   Reviews actual food critics  whom am sure trust much right now    might kinda high expectations going in   Tues  night 9pm only diners   best sign   started cocktails   ordered Suspicious Minds a ginger version cosmopolitan drinkable although bit dry   husband ordered Aloha something which made pineapple flavored vodka   Think artificial pineapple candy flavored rubbing alcohol   very good   He could barely finish Kiwi Caipiroska  due actual muddled fruit sour but better previous drink   wouldn't even suggest cocktail menu any more if aren't going use real fruit real juice infused rather flavored alcohols   I each food item country origin printed next it   Kind feel eating around world   open until 2am great idea side town too   guess when drunk blandness food would good thing    The prices very reasonable not SOME places town felt comfortable quite variety small plates  started Sashimi Salad Salt Pepper Calamari Belgium Frites Dragon Balls Tuna Poke usually would order more   Well here's why didn't    The Sashimi Salad decent amount little pieces sashimi price think justifiable   way much vinegar ey dressing way little greens   greens weren't really green but horrible industrial iceberg lettuce mix Walmart shopper adores   Greens inexpensive could least given large portion absorb all vinegar   The Salt Pepper Calamari missing salt pepper   actually really tried find pepper  maybe white pepper? But couldn't see any taste either   dish many times usually actually taste Salt Pepper   panko style breading good crispyness calamari bit chewy it kept snapping back me! but NO flavor   The Belgium Frites could Ore Ida   San Francisco wouldn't surprised if frozen bag barely fried   No salt distract either   sauce Andolouse ? supposed spicy flavorful your basic mayo   Then Dragon Balls   types creations some sushi bars KNOW deep fry sushi still moist inside   not  fried much outside should called Dragon Cannon Balls  and spicy tuna inside cooked much didn't any more flavor   Last but least tried Tuna Poke  I guess considered authentic because Tuna sesame oil  but since tuna light flavor much sesame oil over powering   love sesame oil but really dish isn't appealing   Being food adventurers going try dessert anyway   comes best part meal   ordered Hawaiian dessert which biscuit dough deep fried rolled sugar   doughy balls lovely browned crispy outside tender light biscuit consistency inside   Served warm sugar covering dough moist perfect   We also ordered Frozen Coconut   great coconut sorbet sweet creamy not ice cream texture   Served inside halved coconut shell perfect ending less perfect meal  <EOR>
