DJ great playing good music variety everything! absolutely back drinks suggest friend! Congrats new location! <EOR> Ah new kids town   McFadden's just recently opened though  apparent trained eye average person place looks around awhile   decided meet CrossFit amigos impromptu Sunday Funday around 5 30PM   Upon arrival introduced T bartender night   then also informed happy hour! Hooray! Half priced EVERYTHING until 7PM   Literally everything  Now  exciting yes but kind dangerous! still feeling effects half priced tequila 24 hours later    The menu very 'bar food' ish and all looked delicious but stoked see healthy option hidden between burgers fried cheese Build your own salad! great options veggies protein fats everything Paleo gal needs create bomb ass salad  even let fill sheet kind 'The Counter' no mistaking exactly ordered   even wrote 'dressing side' whataya know! actually put side!!  It wasn't very busy but time sure more people start piling in  much better Miller's think Yard House would only real competition  Hope place it! <EOR> We friends weekend grand opening decided try tonight  karaoke which fine but when through menu all promotions Tuesday says half off appetizers cocktails  Which apparently true meant cocktail when receive bill drinks its only beer well drinks but nothing says menu waitress useful pet rock  waited several 30 minute intervals walking past table least 4 times simply order water down cocktails  During time never mentioned well drinks  <EOR> Went Grand Opening weekend Town Square location  Expected packed house but could still move around  patio area wonderful service impeccable servers well trained food delicious interesting  only down side music loud inside conversation night music kept getting louder eventually shouting even patio  heard later dance floor look next time  Looking forward going back group friends Happy Hour  <EOR> Tried new Mcfadden's tonight truly awful  just wanted some drinks told could sit outside but we'd own drinks bar  Alright unheard whatever  left most party table patio friend bar waited 15 minutes rotated between 3 bartender spots seemed each own register finally 20 minutes waiting even being recognized bartenders decided leave head downstairs Yard House where waited right away   weren't even busy just terrible servers    Sorry but any place couldn't even eye contact say right you! isn't worth money  Forget place head somewhere appreciates good customer service  <EOR> The service needs major work sister friends said but last two times fun    they even gave free try pink drink fish bowl drink day?? maybe depends night ?? did notice though bars stocked differently bartender poor guy would run around differs stands material wanted? Also don't order girls dancing wouldn't any help !! Which sense guest avoid <EOR> Oh McFadden's where start    never place obsessed trying create illusion fun promoting it  Every 5 mins your Deja Vu esque DJ calling people bars dance  Which fine  But 1  some people aren't meant dancing bars but might better suited being pushed off them  2  Kind sucks trying drink when navigate people nasty feet  3  majority people bars bartenders i use term liberally which means less people dealing customers behind bar  Which means waiting longer stupid beer  easiest way beer would grow boobs work because every time looked around employees able drink more could even order  McFadden's another Cadillac Ranch Ranch House Coconuts  appreciate trying create party atmosphere but expense customers  <EOR> Great Monday happy hour   Half off all appetizers well drinks beer   Cool place sit outside if isn't hot   food portion sizes massive   ordered blackened chicken nachos biggest nachos ever seen $5 50   ate half before reaching mountain chips congealed cheese   Service slow annoying   Food alright   Good location next movie theater Town Square good option add area  <EOR> ***Review does pertain nightlife scene place did people pouring leaving around 10 30***  Came watch UFC fight group friends  would give them zero stars if could only 1 star because didn't charge watch fights because decent SELECTION apps drinks happy hour  While selection decent food NOT!   The blackened chicken nachos option add guacamole $1 came 1 sliver avocado tiny bed pico de gallo  chicken blackened fact no seasoning flavor all   was more boiled chicken breast    The artichoke crab dip salty and shy using salt when cook yet lacked any real flavor wasn't good    The buffalo chicken flatbread ok  Nothing special but better other items   The loaded potato soup could've used some more chunks potato bacon well some pepper  But still decent compared rest food    My friend ordered chopped salad which said came ranch yet when arrived balsamic it  She mentioned waitress replied no doesn't come ranch doesn't really come specific type dressing  Then friend says well menu says comes ranch  waitress grabs menu disprove only realize menu does fact say ranch  know they've only open 2 weeks but servers should know dishes come with   and if they're sure definitely should argue customer just read menu few minutes ago    They also removed pool tables air hockey dart board ranch house used have  plus side still beer pong tables new ones fact   which upgrade    Overall pretty terrible food mediocre service reasonably priced drinks during happy hour  If your idea good time then check place out! Otherwise eat Tommy Bahama cafe order steak salad carnitas sandwich bourbon ribs coconut pineapple cake key lime pie barbados brownie instead grab some drinks yard house after  <EOR> If could give zero stars would  Wow place joke  staff drinks until plastered  If want place drink minors then your spot  don't know but drinking bottle just poured directly into mouth some trashy girl really style    only matter time until place shut down opinion fit business Town Square  enough garbage spots strip  really hate 4 kids hear all drunken idiots screaming obscenities while walk them movies  can't imagine Town Square putting Gameworks right place   unsafe children even next to  place DUI Fight waiting happen  <EOR> So far good new McFaddens   Excellent happy hour 4pm 7pm lots choose Highly recommend nachos easily could feed 3 5 people two could barely put dent them  chips smothered really good creamy white cheese  really enjoyed it  *See photo  There three bars choose 2 inside 1 patio small dance floor ample seating throughout restaurant  lot Pinnacle vodkas choose really thing but seemed hit other people   Bar staff seems hit miss lucky girls serving awesome   But could see some other girls behind bar bit attitude    They show UFC fights wanted see handle it  first sound wasn't great slightly off distorted prelims but luckily fixed main card   So far bar really busy both times gone  Hopefully keep level  <EOR> Terrible service  Came cause free open bar thing  wasn't busy but found table told seated host while everyone else seating themselves thought why not? sat down watch others around seating themselves getting service while getting run around server come since sat ourselves wait someone free take orders  really didn't sense sat around waiting while saw other groups swarming tables sit served  Hate play race card but saw tables white customer help while group mix people didn't even any help any servers  Mcfaddens must want money thought wouldn't tip cause minorities  If could give 0 would  <EOR> I town work decided hit Mcfaddens getting movie some food   even sure accurately describe dining experience     1st round drinks takes 15 mintues some drinks correctly but keep them because took long   ordered bunch happy hour appetizers then decided wanted some burgers but could figure actual waitress nobody willing take order     Apps come they're typical bar fried food but then realize no plates silverware   flag down bus boy then brings 4 sets 5 people   ???  another set then finally figure waiting order burgers     2nd round drinks takes over 25 minutes delivered   Burgers actually come 10 15 minutes   Bus boys continue deliver food table didn't order   point 3rd extra delivery he just looks says   just keep it   see table next giving server earfull   3rd round drinks came faster   Burgers actually pretty good   Good luck getting refills your waters iced tea   Before waitress meltdown ask check   pretty nice d1cks table behind us   When waitress came back she said she gave 50% discount because everything messed up   Then she comes back says she gave wrong check hands 20$   original bill group over 100$   Nice move thank you   The next day found only opened previous night   still no excuse someone should canned circus side show  <EOR> I am impressed  Friday ladies night where supposed free champagne but ran way early   Lame  music all same crap played Cadillac Ranch sure same stuff they'll play when place bankrupt becomes something else next year  deal breaker when ordered Smithwicks didn't draft  whole place just seemed trashy wasn't willing stay long enough trashed hopes enjoying it  won't back unless friend never insists  Really Irish bar  Just bar seems attract younger crowd Irish stuff walls  <EOR> I Friday night large group coworkers long week  most horrendous nightlife experiences two years lived Vegas  atmosphere isn't bad but isn't great either  only major difference saw former Cadillac Ranch Ranch House mechanical bull replaced small dance floor    As mentioned previous reviews staff obliterated early evening which challenging drink under 15 minutes place your order   Prepare repeat your order several times  DJ stopped music periodically insist all bars filled girls both bartenders patrons would then dance bar while bartenders poured free shots directly into patrons' mouths  shots unmarked bottle odd purple color  Avoid mystery bottle just grazed mouths 30 other people   Overall understand idea party bar but missed mark  bartenders more party any patrons  Long story short spend your money anywhere else nearby better service staff sober enough remember your order  <EOR> We came happy hour stayed fruit flies    Monday night good deal half off drinks appetizers  sat waited 15 min before anyone came take DRINK order  once waitress came table drinks took another 15 min before Magner's 7 7 made way back table  7 7 hitchhiker floating around glass  drink replaced saw waitress again  replacement drink came back pretty quick  ordered Chicken Nachos Quesadilla  Nachos HUGE  might good thing  chicken just top layer ICE cold  mean barely above freezing  Service just down there  Waitress must known group sitting another table because she screamed ran over spent next 10 minutes doing shots drinking them  Needless say  Service horrible  Absolutely abysmal  no way sugar coat that  Irish pub should never thirsty  <EOR> While tending some shopping afternoon stumbled upon new McFadden's now lies venue space Cadillac Ranch and whatever CR use be   Indulging bit happy hour great specials way friends pleasantly surprised food quality even service     Wanting give McFadden's honest college try select dining venue family dinner spot week   made reservations on line LOVE showed promptly sat designated time   So hostess wasn't most friendly face bar service other hand was  Forgot name terrible know but she fantastic even night progressed restaurant filled up   The best nachos very long time guess what??? REAL NACHO CHEESE! Yes  right folks heard here   real nacho cheese   yum   My only complaint why why why must venues Town Square insist turning restaurants night clubs 10pm?  Irish pub should remain Irish pub opinion keep under dressed ladies over muscled men over Blue Martini where belong  <EOR> Oh McFadden's   When Rio hosted most memorable St  Patrick's Day celebrations   new location Town Square certainly set entertain three bars one outdoors beer pong area DJ booth dance floor photo booth karaoke   mechanical bull previously replaced DJ booth mechanical leprechaun expecting  Don't look that   Rattlecan mechanical pickle could ride  I came happy hour which 4 00pm 7 00pm daily gets 1 2 price appetizers draft beers   also daily specials each day week offered open close http www mcfaddensvegas com specials php   happy hour drink specials decent you'll end paying $3 00 $4 00 pint nothing spectacular     The big surprise came 1 2 price appetizers dishes huge!  most you'll paying $5 50 appetizer plenty share others   Between three left overs ordering four appetizers chicken fingers Irish nachos crispy shrimp king crab artichoke dip   Everything good bar food   Service really spotty times   ordered Bumblebee which Boddington's Guiness layered top   When bartender made he poured Boddington's even though menu showed draft beers   when came time pay almost 30 minute ordeal   Nothing deal breaking suppose but if happy hour sure would stop in  <EOR> The saddest part star review McFaddens all elements GREAT blowing having TERRIBLE service drowning good food SALT     I company happy hour   25 people party arriving waves   first 6 people drinks rest took 40 minutes drink   When complained said only bartender   Guess takes 40 minutes pour 2 pitchers beer 3 mix drinks     the place busy really no excuse   Since service bad decided try food since menu looked promising     We ordered 2 $5 burgers various toppings   waitress asked 3 times kind mayo wanted confirmed twice plain mayo   burgers came NO MAYO   2 patties which wasn't expecting don't know if thats normal but its much   worst part     my medium temp patty RAW just rare raw cold middle   When home remove bun cook microwave    Once cooked tasted good but shouldn't cook burger home   I ordered chopped salad chicken cobb salad home   on side burger fried pickle   First bite good second bite biting into teaspoon SALT   spit out    I ordered side mac n' cheese   $6 bucks expecting something did look kraft mac n' cheese   but kicker COOKED   chewy pasta sticks your teeth    Again added little water put microwave finish cooking    first thought edible now   then realized tasted half cooked pasta then soaked box salt then poured some cheese sauce it   EDIBLE again    the good news happy hour prices 2 burgers fries mac n cheese salad only $17   If food edible could see eating every other week   FIRE COOK stock mortons salt company drowning fresh food pounds salt failing cook things properly    Seriously right cook decent service might back   Otherwise never again    It almost felt cook trying purposely ambush restaurant   Such shame great location great ambiance good prices good ingredients BAD EXECUTION  <EOR> This fun place hang out  Since just opened lil empty but still good time  ordered smurf fishbowl sure why purple but hey whatever  food unfortunately mediocre best  enjoyed beer pong bartenders very personable fun  did notice really great specials plan return those  <EOR> This new McFaddens awesome location town square great expectations going there  called selected party would drink free till midnight all friends would wrist bands everything half price  told only beer all them half friends free served little plastic cup  Very few mixed drinks only well half no food half  very disappointed because brought them lot people wasn't suppose be  friends only drinks Crown he drink ran yes ran Crown royal 11 pm  Saturday night  Lastly took forever even drink need more bartenders  music great ambience also great   why two stars  <EOR> I don't even know where begin     Came during happy hour prompty seated bar area   could see plenty staff bartenders servers   problem?  no where found   server service beyond lacking   drinks never refilled nor ever asked server ANY server manager walked passed table matter    Our appetizers food arrived together worst all arrived 1 cold 2 cooked requested   ordered Irish Nachos hamburger   wayyy much cheese because cold very much unappealing   ordered burger cooked medium well   arrived med rare  When pointed server she stated she would remove bill she proceeded argue received medium well when clearly not   walked around 6 left 7 40 5 minutes before movie started   should long   But again server no where found   wouldn't return if paid me   How place still open  someone shed light this? <EOR> Despite some glowing reviews place happy hour special tempted try out  first glance glace place looks nice  outside signage very catchy inside beautiful open   Hostess We greeted couple dazed looking hostesses stared computer awkward 15 seconds before acknowledging then kind gave blank stare eventually mumbled uh    two? Then took table though she lost    Venue first took pretty open restaurant pub quickly seemed big empty place she seated far off other patrons  venue very large  2 bars inside both which open which made little sense very busy  If seated more populated area would made easier waitress keep eye us    The place filled TVs similar sports bar but despite being Irish pub TVs all showed baseball American football instead rugby soccer    Wait Staff The waitress very friendly cheery  She seemed inexperienced but everyone starts somewhere am fine that  waitresses always seemed buzzing around but never seemed taking anything tables  place pretty empty service slow no idea waitresses doing all wandering about    The waitress uniforms would more home Hooters  am opposed attractive sexy uniforms little plaid skirt adorable but paired cropped midriff top just much  Some waitresses wore fishnets tall boots skirt tacky over top  also fan waitresses habit leaning table ploy show some cleavage better tip just another sign unprofessional waitress    There also guy casual clothes lurking around clip board whole time  no idea he but distracting   Food So point service slow but awful waitress very friendly if unprofessional place big empty Irish pub but kicker food  would take all those things stride if food good  ordered couple beers Irish nachos teriyaki wings    The Irish nachos okay  portion size huge  whole thing bit bland soggy though  If order again which probably won't would ask cheese side   teriyaki wings kind soft soggy teriyaki sauce bland tasted more soy sauce anything   TL DR The food bland servers friendly but slow hostess seemed brain dead  whole place seems having identity crisis looks Irish pub but feels sports bar Hooters waitresses  $28 4 beers chicken wings Irish nachos  really wanting place but won't going back  <EOR> Decent ish bar food  Average service   I given incorrect bill twice when finally given correct signed fortunately kept copy  Since then leaving messages manager call bc supposedly there's no manager house Everytime call complain charged more double amount receipt   New place    No managers house already  No wonder all messed up  Better options town square  If settle keep your receipt! <EOR> The service drinks McFadden's great but unfortunately it  items menu reminiscent TGIFRIDAYs esque chain food decor ambiance  happy hour decent see would fun place grab some post work pre movie drinks Town Square but I'd recommend grabbing dinner downstairs Yard House bar fare your bag  <EOR> Tried McFadden's 1st time last night  Ever since moved Town Square co workers stoked another restaurant Department lunches  working late last night came Great Experience  Staff Very Friendly especially Waitress  food Really Good tried Hummus Spicy Ahi Crackers Celtic Wings Guinness BBQ sauce everything Good but Wings Winner three  Both co workers Fish Chips which really liked  ordered 'Kiss Irish' Burger which first assumed Sandwich but turned Burger but just 1 but 2 patties Delicious  Messy Juicy combination Flavors worked very well each other! But Best Part evening Live Band Karaoke which first Loved it! Karaoke Host Great Voice she very pretty band performed really well  Also Great Plus No Smoking! realized Bar smoky then remembered still Restaurant first foremost but Bar like feel  3 bars where could see many people enjoying themselves Lot them girls Tuesday night!  But then again Vegas! can't wait come back Especially Tuesday evening! <EOR> Decided check place first impression bad!    Three ladies hostess stand no greeting  Disappointing    Then seated but without opportunity ask booth bar patio     The menu looks very good inexpensive once decided write review see many seem agree McFadden's LACKING big customer service department  very disappointing cause if doesn't smooth immediately know dining experience food enjoy     in addition when seated called hostess twice she walked away but ignored  WALKED OUT! Then way more accommodating better serving bar next door  <EOR> Sorry bad reviewers  Did attend same place?? Food delicious atmosphere great service prompt friendly  Just right noise level festive but deafening  conversation without shouting  Give another try! <EOR> Nice big location town square   staff seems very amateur  all need trained customer service  <EOR> I heard lot mixed reviews regarding McFaddan's  biggest pro half off apps during happy hour  disadvantage service  staff isn't friendliest walk around hottest things earth  policy which only split check once which unfriendly large groups  say tater tots very tasty but don't know if they're enough bring back  also attendant bathroom which thought awkward we're fancy restaurant night club! <EOR> Terrible terrible terrible TERRIBLE  excited come decided check happy hour  First thing walk door there's two hostesses which wearing half shirt huge gut spilling out  Since saw bunch girls full length tanks know REQUIRED uniform  won't hold against them part 1 star rating but still good first impression  proceed sit both stare while phone taking reservation five people  year old starts getting antsy trying jump arms still don't seat us    Uhh hello anyone home? then seated  told them three adults child  give two adult menus  server comes  Extremely ditsy but nice  tell happened menus she says she bring another  She comes back 4 more times ask if we're ready which because we're all huddled over switching menus back forth  start Irish nachos  Tater tots bacon sour cream cheese  Uh yeah right   pile tater tots sprinkle cheese sauce half slice bacon crumbled top tiny drizzle sour cream  If wasn't happy hour would've sent them back  each order beer  Myself Guinness other two bass blue moon  soon bass sat down he takes sip says try tastes almost miller light  tasted  tasted half bass half miller light  Weird  tasted Guinness  couldn't take more two sips all concurred tasted Guinness water  blue moon wasn't watery but also weird miller light taste it  Again happy hour just dealt it   The server kept coming table throughout would blankly stare say things ohhhh myyy goooooooddddddd necklace broke!!! awkward  Almost she drugs  No place seemed know knew going all   I say burger pretty good though hubby's RAW middle  He ordered medium well  could touch te middle feel wasn't cooked  such high hopes place but promise NEVER back  Gross  place won't last long Town Square  No quality customer service  Hurry McFadden's move along something better open your place  <EOR> I've never posted review but place really left urge so   Totally incompetent staff everyone seemed different idea happy hour service well below average although prices ridiculously cheap  But am sure if winds being good thing  seems reflect upon quality people suppose town square! food took way long come somehow arrived warm best  food runner appeared overwhelmed  bartender told beers asked but later night saw another bartender serve one  Seemed very unorganized lack communication between bar staff   Drunk bartenders servers no sense urgency serve customers especially once DJ starts going starts getting messy  bar really brings classy sarcasm come see for yourself you'll quite scene   My bartender manager take care something check became task  Two different bartenders served charged two totally different prices even though happy hour suppose all night    Apparently having responsible manager readily available something place values  bartender seemed lost attempts find manager he didn't even know where look  Finally small girl appeared plain clothes less then professional demeanor take care it    Looks place well way another failed attempt making cursed location profitable good bar  <EOR> My review strictly based nightlife scene venue restaurant  When walk entrance carded security guy   two different ones seen both nice   hostesses walk most previous reviews nailed when described hostesses spacey just all there   Now when just bypass them find seat bar     The first night JUSt opened beyond crazy   Luckily bartender Khara superb fast never really wait long drinks   second night came big group hung patio area which awesome!  bar consistently slammed but waited people eventually left opening seats bar   think such busy place could probably without seats bar but worked us!  bartender awesome first round   kind slow drinks but moreso anywhere else extremely packed    Overall think McFadden's great place come when want drinking your friends don't feel venturing Strip   always good meet people   fun crazy casual  it! <EOR> Like Ranch House Kitchen Cadillac Ranch before McFaddens provides mediocre bar experience but now Irish twist   Nothing seems able stay open spot above Yard House Town Square  McFadden's itself pretty huge but instead marketing itself restaurant bar feels try club instead  most weekend nights see long line people forming outside entrance  think most them couldn't into Blue Martini didn't wanna pay cover Stoney's figured Mcfaddens next best thing   Inside try food off menu if find someone serve you  drinks overpriced venue get  Beers come around $8 cocktails few bucks more  wider selection brews downstairs Yardhouse better drinks Blue Martini   During last visit thinking ordering drink bar but afraid having kicked into face random women allowed dance counter  Apparently people playing beer pong don't mind scooping filthy ping pong ball off dance floor  Im sure water cup sanitizes just fine   The place sweaty muggy but outdoor patio nice remember come early secure good seat outside  Also whatever reason only split check once large groups beware! <EOR> I 3 separate occasions avoiding writing review really wanted place  Unfortunately just can't save themselves  first occasion beginning Happy Hour  Despite fact hardly anyone service painfully slow drink orders came back incorrect  Also sorting check end challenge itself  another occasion watch football game middle day wait over hour before someone even offered menu glass water let alone taking order  only reason menu almost physically restrain duty manager attention  aside manager did really present professional image establishment she looked liked she just rolled bed  found alumni groups chosen McFaddens home base during football season abandoned place only 3 weeks because members treated poorly complained much  originally looking place host client event but no way would take risk now  don't know if management ever take notice feedback because seem content lose customers hand over fist  end day girls skimpy clothes crappy service ineffectual non existent operational management  shame because layout venue promising  only assume whole lot money drunk people Friday Saturday nights don't give crap anybody else  <EOR> horrible horrible horrible!!! wish could give place zero stars!!! management staff    this place disgrace service industry     bartenders no personality   takes forever drink don't even take time acknowledge even there!!!   and mention akwardness   one female managers started yelling bartenders infront whole restaurant   talk unprofessional   i think would more embaressed if her!!!   food tasted came microwave    my burger wasn't even cooked all way through   i told them well done    not well bloody  long story short   this place sucks  service sucks  management sucks  but surprising    look other establishments   they all rated crappy  spend your money somewhere else folks    last note    to female manager yelling bartender   you manager crappy bar restaurant less garbage man    learn little respect   <EOR> This place WORST service  friends waited over hour food which wings wrong type nachos didn't chicken  only came because asked 3 times it  ordered Stella which drink frequently more coors light sure  waitress said she watched being poured  ordered another type beer didn't drink other beer she gave me  When she took away she said nothing taking off bill  Also when manager acting manager came table she nice but she wearing daisy dukes      ??  Two frozen margaritas came she all water frozen   Finally chicken Nachos made back table but finishing all other good correct wings never made canceled those  Then finished good 20 mins still no check  Take advice other great establishments town square AVOID place TERRIBLE service !! <EOR> Wow!!! Seriously!?!?!? 6 10pm placed order 6 20 food came 7 15?????? food came orders wrong food blah!! No bueno drinks garbage waitresses lacked knowledge slow!! management lacked skills handle complaints  Oh well 6 customers coming back !! <EOR> I nieces  restaurant clean nice looking  ordered food but delivered wrong table    several times  waitress seemed overwhelmed task even though weren't many tables she needed tend to  food good though  Nothing write home but good  waitress salvaged tip towards end visit otherwise would given star  <EOR> For another bar Town Square ok  Lots room three four different bars  sat outside bar since such nice night  very crowded 9 o'clock Saturday  hopped Blue Martini next door definitely more crowded McFadden's  Although lot people lots bartenders hosts hostesses  felt socializing more serving since weren't many people    Sometimes feel uniforms service industry very sexist fair lady customers  While female server plaid schoolgirl skirt short see cheek bottoms not so bad looking male barback t shirt  Can't dress men every once awhile ladies some eye candy instead measuring ourselves waitresses   I'll off soapbox now   Anywho ok  Would rather hang next door downstairs  would great event order return  <EOR> Great place watch game switch boys  Televisions everywhere lots beer  liquor selection good food  Try Irish style fries tater tots! <EOR> Where begin?! start fact never waste time joint again  visited McFaddens 4pm Monday afternoon  exactly busy time day  approximately 4 tables sat entire bar  fifth sat behind pole back restaurant  Apparently 100 miles far waitress because she took FOREVER give service  husband ordered Corona Light water  took 15 20 minutes beer arrive warm!  Then ordered nachos guacamole beans chicken wings mozzarella sticks  Guess long took food     40 minutes!!! informed no realized wasn't cook kitchen   awesome management  Well once figured think put half cook kitchen because nachos no beans guacamole mozzarella sticks leaked cheese bottom  all hollowed bread crumb casings giant ball cheese bottom  food wasn't even good  waste calories  husband dared order another beer which took another 20 minutes  came food gone also warm  happy hour but cares when only 2 drinks every seven days  service slow! She nice but slower molasses! like10 employees roaming around only 5 tables took 1 1 2 hours wait food drinks service  pace could enjoyed nice fine dining meal  easily spend 1 1 2 hours bar but  when beverages aren't strapped turtle's back  complainer but save your time money least middle afternoon  <EOR>
