Because can't remember last time paid $5 50 scoop gelato  good but ain't good    Well    OKAY   I confess  Actually must good because gone EVERY DAY during meeting breaks last 3 days  take last comment back  awesome  Mint chocolate chip cone    They TON flavors serving Cocolini gelato Venetian but Illy environment yummy coffee  Way more selection other locations though minimal seating   So yeah  $5 50 scoop  only $7 50 2 scoops  bad succumbed few days biggie version along cone? Ahhh blessed 30 minute afternoon meeting break feeding gelato habit   Espresso fab too  Try 'Espresso Shakerado'   it sounds odd but tastes oh good  gym?? Yeah reviewing next  <EOR> I think all gelato served Venetian Palazzo Cocolina because four different places all served cocolina   lemon ice gelato which started off really refreshing ended extremely sour but still good     just couldn't finish it   gelato really pricey but same price all places   also serve crepes other desserts     obviously specialize Illy coffees  <EOR>
