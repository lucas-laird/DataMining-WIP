This Gordon Ramseys kitchen nightmares  wife Blue Fire last Saturday evening  other customer resturaunt  first clue  bartender nice short conversation learned she just hired only job 10 minutes  Then fun started  3 screaming little kids owners employees started running screaming thru restaurant  When ordering meal wife asked if dinner came salad bartender waitress looked menu saw could greens she no clue greens were  enlightening vegetable she placed order  want remind  wife well other person only ones place  30 minutes interrupt employee ask when going meal already cooked  She excused herself kitchen upon return explained order even started  Anyone reading this  waste your time money  very disappointed if do! <EOR> the place itself very clean felt brand new   hostess wasn't nice wasn't mean isn't much say service   pretty indifferent   atmosphere actually pretty awkward since only ones restaurant     i ordered pulled bbq pork sandwich   dry salty   pretty much hated it   fries however tasted pretty good   boyfriend ordered hotlinks he said tasted fine   its pretty hard mess sausages   sure should bbq business though feel venue potential but should maybe change menu   overall give place two stars because venue itself nice   would given if wasn't   would say skip it  <EOR> Do waste money here   worse excuse BBQ ever eaten   brisket very dry flavored well Mac Cheese looked boxed fried catfish wasn't deep fried but shallow panned fried told which looked just baked tasted undercooked   The atmosphere nice   waitress manager nice but owner ? snippy side when sent back raw tasting fish dried brisket wasn't edible  tried tell everyone wanted non deep fried fish now quit making everyone usually loves BBQ down list chef's credentials show wonderful he is     We warned ladies coming leaving horrible which manager started coughing   Coincidence?  think not   didn't ask but didn't offer take any portion meal off even though more half table couldn't eat it  <EOR> My first experience better now came back check can't say same  place still looks same but changed chefs again  would say time need change cook something if want business successful    I ordered baby back ribs comes two sides  ribs came half slab dry salty  mac cheese tasted ones microwave fried okra blah needs more seasoning   say banana bread pudding probably only thing worth coming for  But items caught eyes frychos which nachos french fries  sounds really yummy! prices think bit much since food isn't great  $20 99 baby back ribs two sides isn't even tasty    I don't think coming again if probably only going banana bread pudding if change cook better knows doing  <EOR> What when opening restaurant!  Future restaurateurs take notes exam    For short time Blue Fire BBQ open changes chefs well fairly significant turnover wait staff  first warning sign    The draw place pretty blue lights ornament bar sign food  Those shimmering aqua lights awkward setting once inside restaurant fine enough job distracting guests mediocre food service  ribs tough salty dry  side dishes left yearning Boston Market clearly flattering comparison  place empty both times once during lunch once Tuesday evening    This ill planned catastrophe hanging last rib  lover BBQ ecstatic when saw Blue Fire BBQ open up    Unfortunately good idea wrapped box pretty blue paper still just empty box  <EOR>
