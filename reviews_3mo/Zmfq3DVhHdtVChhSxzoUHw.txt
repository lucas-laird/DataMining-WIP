Nice place  Very elegant decor   Had craving Thai studying finals during dinner time Monday night  exactly A material   Pad Thai Chicken 7 50 For togo order bit   small  Other places fill whole box but section left empty wedge lime ground peanuts section could few extra strands rice noodle! Taste wise was   sub standard  missing lot spicy strong flavors associated Thai food  Sugar must sale bit into large piece scrambled egg tasted more sweet then egg sauce spicy matter   Yellow Curry Chicken 8 75 Piggybacking Pad Thai yeah sugar sale cause more sweetness then anything else curry  slices chili but no heat  Very weak curry essence  Strong coconut milk presence   If place authentic Thai restaurant would Zero stars  But advertise Americanized Thai restaurant job done  <EOR>
