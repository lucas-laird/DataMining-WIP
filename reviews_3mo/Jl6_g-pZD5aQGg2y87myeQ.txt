I stopped Aloha BBQ couple weeks ago when having chicken katsu musubi craving and couldn't bring myself L L    glad did because food delicious give huge portions!!  katsu crispy yet meat super juicy   portuguese fried rice really flavorful very oily all   kimchi best around area   The only thing didn't gravy loco moco   just tasted salty bit gloppy   But hamburger meat delicious can't complain much   suggest ordering loco moco gravy side decide whether not  <EOR> Fantastic Hawaiian BBQ  I still don't whole steamed rice macaroni salad sides but far bbq I pleasantly suprised   This place small dining area but most orders take out   They also largest Hawaiian shirt planet hanging wall  REAL Cool!  Service fast friendly prices selection terrific! <EOR>
