Accidentally walked restaurant friends decided try out  Angus beef steak bento really tasty surprisingly only $8  ramen decent well  Worthy checking out  <EOR> Nice new restaurant! came accidently but food pretty good  Worth try?And price reasonable affordable  <EOR> Very tasty food Good Customer service Highly recommend Beef Cha Shao Ramen original soup  <EOR> This worst Ramen place Las Vegas  never ever come back again even ramen only 2 ramen choice soup horrible  <EOR> We ordered chatsu ramen miso soup base  soup delicious   Even thought ordered miso soup base soup salty other ramen places  recommended place  Good service but cash only  <EOR> There's new player Vegas ramen scene its Niu Gu! Rather opinion its more chinese beef noodle soup fusion japanese ramen but still super tasty  whats unique ramen place soup base beef won't your typical japanese tonkotsu pork ramen here  beef base its greasy heavy pork leave feeling much cleaner   almost drinking chicken soup  Aside beef stock base also comes 3 different flavors original miso lemon pepper  able try both original miso  favor miso more because broth little more richer original but both quite good  Just other japanese ramen places add ingredients such egg corn broccoli etc  portion size just right comes green onion bean sprouts 5 pieces beef  beef very tender soft much cha shus other places  serve some appetizers some rice dishes but wasn't able try any them   Service good but may because only customers  Hopefully place gains some popularity since feel its very good alternative japanese ramen  <EOR> Are guidelines ramen should should be?  Niu Gu outlier traditional ramen styles but would closely resemble Tantan men Dandan noodles  broth clear much traditional Chinese Vietnamese noodles cleaner heavy better summertime when you're sick bed don't want eat much   lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar Northern Chinese noodles  bowl brought cart then hand torch used onions give char flavor perhaps  Comes couple pieces charred short rib slices soft little smokey melt your mouth good   The Niu Gu Rib items short ribs lamb require call ahead time seems bit hassle order regular lamb chop believe 15 20 min wait time consider calling ahead if you're quick meal!  Niu Gu different traditional ramen maybe some people would consider fusion new style but much resemblance old school Chinese noodles maybe its really ORIGINAL style  <EOR> Not worth it  place mediocre less than  many other ramen places  equivalent price much better flavors  soul? broth bland  original broth just boiled beef stock salt miso broth tastes  just beef stock miso paste mixed in  Please don't order beef tongue  smells rancid meat  If place going call themselves ramen joint needs bring strong game  tough competition  <EOR> Kind disappointing experience   A couple friends came ordered 4 ramen came time over such long period person finished eating two orders yet arrive  Flavor wise kind bland ramen common ingredients other ramen houses but missing most flavors     Menu looked very unprofessional wrinkled worn paper despite fact just opened    Desert available fridge malfunctioned  Pay card available  <EOR> I ordered Cha shao beef ramen miso base added egg corn  very delicious  meat tender juicy  good quality  actually did mean into place but since rush before work decided just eat anyway  favorite tonkatsu ramen spot already but since trying looking place closer home  Friendly staff  very good  <EOR> Beef rib signature dish yummy  juicy tender some sweet source top  really your mouth sings well $26 piece better good Also noddles broth  owner said use lots cow bones broth made special  No wonder won't feel thirsty having bowl noddles  gave 4 starts because many choices menu dumplings just ok  <EOR>
