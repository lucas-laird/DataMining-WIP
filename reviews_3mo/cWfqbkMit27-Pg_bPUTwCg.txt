I give place really bad rap really bad   See when interact lot random people bar just doesn't that   Every time most 10 people hanging having drinks   gave another shot Saturday night midnight still only 10 12 people there   But some food pretty decent bartender pretty friendly helpful drink selection   If don't mind empty bar prefer you'll really bar   There's plenty comfortable couches chairs all food seems pretty decent   Oh serve full menu until 1am least weekends   Good late night find! <EOR>
