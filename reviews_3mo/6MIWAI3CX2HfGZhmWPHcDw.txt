Okay pretty difficult find place if no idea where you're going  located right next BJ's 215 Eastern down plaza expecting something small but decent size restaurant sports bar    We walked wasn't anyone entrance looked pretty awkward standing around looking see if anyone going come greet us  Someone did maybe minute walked seated nearby    The decor very nice elegant really enjoyed table setting overall ambiance restaurant  booth sitting direct line front doors every time someone opened door pretty chilly  If you're prone cold am at least during winter ask moved!  Onto food  friend Blue Water Meat Lover's platter looked good coming plate but taste nothing notable  meats marinated all steak tasted over cooked  $14 expected more just few pieces bland meat thrown plate  crab cakes chicken avocado cigars  crab cakes came pair only two $9 sauce tasted made 1000 island dressing but sauce wasn't bad all  crab cake bit dry seemed mix crab meat few other ingredients then just lightly breaded before frying  tell Crab Corner much better crab cakes guys  chicken avocado cigars $7 egg rolls some chicken avocado tomato cheese  also came sauce sauce pretty good nice kick it  Trying egg roll without sauce definitely say sauce tastes lot better  three dishes ordered egg rolls best seasoned  Nothing else tasted any seasoning all if any    As far service took way long food no bread something munch mean time took long check  spent most time waiting around    They definitely could use lot improvements service food really feel bad asking friend come try place me  impressed any right now honestly sure if back least very long while  <EOR> The food service friendliness ambiance all provided great dining experience Blue Water Restaurant  great location right midst where run all errands shopping along Eastern between St  Rose Silverado Ranch  seen location change several times hope Blue Water succeeds well here    I greeted immediately door escorted bar where met friendliest owner bartender Tory Javier sorry if misspelled names   before when restaurant something else just okay recall  Tonight just different better vibe food marvelous  ordered 3 tapas Tuna Sashimi Jerk Shrimp anadas Fabulous Boneless Mango BBQ Ribs  only reason why didn't give review 5 stars because yet try full meal but definitely back next   Tuna Sashimi nice seared flavor wasn't overpowered its accompaniments  Jerk Shrimp anadas wasn't spiced high you'd think jerk spice might but just right most people I'd think  spicy foods could turned notch me  Boneless BBQ Ribs caramelized slightly crispy edges ribs moist inside  Nice idea messy all hands in bones  Hats off chef!
