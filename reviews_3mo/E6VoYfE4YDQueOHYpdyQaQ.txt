I going breakfast place over year totally forgot hidden gem  conveniently located down street home    I love bagel breakfast sandwiches! always order ham egg cheese onion bagel runny yolk! made fresh cooked your liking! lunch wraps also very good light refreshing!   Empire Bagels clean TV watch news while eating breakfast   open 7am 3pm prices pretty descent!   I hope don't ever close! If live nearby want some breakfast your PJ's flip flops place be! <EOR> I place conveniently close especially during football season winner since bagels wraps  bagels good but think prefer Einstein's Sun Dried Tomato Cream Cheese  However really enjoy wraps   there plenty protein leaves full  only open till 6 7 depending day but its definitely good spot grab wrap sandwich bagel  <EOR>
