Last week brought whole family dinner everything great highly recommend chicken tikka nihari! samosas yummy well! Place clean super modern! Definitely going regular spot lunch dinner! <EOR> Wow! ordered chicken boti delicious! planned taking food home but wanted try quick bite when into car    well ate whole thing parking lot I'm proud   tasty! birthday next week now know where husband taking dinner <EOR> I first walked surprised self serve place  guess just assumed Indian Food place would include service  more sense when menu ordering area see half menu comprised different kinds burgers  didn't discount them just fusion menu but first point concern  looking some Korma specifically don't that  pictures gonna upload show lamb Shawarma chicken samosa mango lassi  boyfriend chicken boti drink fries    Our bill came $37 boyfriend which think ridiculous self serve indian American fusion diner basically   call your number pick your food   eat throw away your trash put your plates away  don't mind going self serve places but amount pay Indian food think silly serve us  Especially because place isn't busy! Why signs everywhere trying customers serve themselves clean themselves when takes 30 seconds empty restaurant staff member walk over  say right if restaurant doesn't succeed least 50% because idea self serve    I happy lamb Shawarma  The  samosa really spicy would recommend  lasse did bubbly texture used to  boyfriend pretty upset boti only because 11 dollars place serve yourself he thought portions small  He five chunks chicken bunch rice lettuce  call salad but really just lettuce    However lamb good may back lamb gyro if mood day  food isn't bad just some execution issues think  If serve restaurant priced food serve your customers  Especially if your portion sizes aren't commendable  <EOR> Very disappointing  worst meals ever usually pretty forgiving  friend came expecting Indian food  Apparently only serve weekends ??? questionable Mediterranean food instead  veggie panini almost inedible  chicken hummus friend just ok  Service pretty bad too  understand just opened figuring things could see mean well but still    embarrassed took friend here  place potential but need train staff complete revamped menu  <EOR> This place amazing food happy see plenty customers when stopped last night dinner  think place some room improvement but food great!  We ordered Samosas Tiki Chicken falafal pita sandwhich  friend very please size portions tasty entrees    I feel would enjoyed place more if    Actual servers waited you  unaware needed grab drinks own silverware  $32 00 + tip felt slightly annoyed own drink refills napkins  The cups pretty small  refill soda two times while eating  It might helpful if photos foods  friends familiar type food completely unsure order    Overall probably back some point  food tasty  But often am honestly going treat myself take type meal same price sit down place?? <EOR> GREAT FOOD!! Very friendly    the falafel wrap house dressing fantastic  If you're familiar Indian Mediterranean food ask staff describe it    the Chicken Boti kabob entree tender seasoned perfectly  back! <EOR> Excellent very clean food   Definitely best Indian food town   Highly recommended!! <EOR> I think place bit identity crisis  fast casual restaurant its sit down restaurant  Unfortunately charging sit down prices fast casual serve yourself environment    The food decent but two kabobs dinners drink which yourself almost $28   Wait now think orders combo never onion rings only choice because ran fries    For liking music bit loud  also found menu little big side pictures someone else mentioned would huge help   mediterranean Indian place serves great burgers could probably work but may want advertise them little more  Maybe burger flavors toppings could work to    Another suggestion saw owner felt  necessary respond  When respond such way comes off negative your restaurant look bad  nothing wrong being passionate but would respond little differently  Something am sorry your experience did meet your expectations  take your feedback continually strive restaurant better dining experience  fan small business hope succeeds but quite few places town good kabobs Indian food   think once place figures exactly succeed  <EOR> If looking Halal meal then it  Really nice atmosphere  Great food  Great staff  What's like? bit far if near strip but worth it  <EOR> This first time love it   Pros the decor really nice well thought out the staff nice Jamie front counter helpful polite the food fresh delicious lots menu options my husband vegan lots choose they bring your food good music    I going take away star because price little high self serve place but tasting food understand why  veggie burger onion rings veggie burger seemed house made fresh very tasty  even brought ketchup ranch onion rings without having ask  onion rings did taste frozen  husband falafel wrap both loved it  also baklava but full eat it  But looks good! P Overall place solid would recommend anyone  <EOR> Ran grabbed to go order baba ganoush   Best I'd ever had   good back whole family   Chicken samosas falafel hummus all outstanding baba ganoush   Everything made order beautifully seasoned delicious   Very reasonable opinion  <EOR> Tried first time wife   chili chicken spicy delicious  The lamb shwarma tender very tasty   All entrees come salad basmati rice flat bread   décor very nice well   also liked fact you order counter food brought you  Looking forward going back trying some the other dishes  <EOR> Seems every time visited prices gone higher  food so so  don't honor menu prices tell oh changed price  other better places eat  <EOR> Very nice atmosphere kind attentive employees  samosas fresh crispy flavorful  curry delicious  it tasted old watery  comp'd rice trouble  Decent selection vegetarians  Price seemed little high but worth first time visit  <EOR> The food very good would definitely eat again! happy money  décor all over place but certain charm staff very friendly  way serve food odd  Those red baskets usually see burger joints diners suit restaurant  <EOR> Very disappointed food  Restaurant very nice beautiful but people paying money food  taste good menu very confusing  eat better tasting food at home  should less items but quality quantity taste should very good  Since don't many good halal restaurant Las Vegas  wish them all best hope food gets better  Read less <EOR> A little Lazzzzy those frozen onion rings including combo  Coke syrup overdue replacement  Passable kabobs excessively mild chili chicken large portions rice uninspiring salad  far place sells much better kabob salad combos probably pass coming back  place potential but tell they're bit dependent premade ingredients kitchen  Manager very friendly though sure kids couldn't tell difference probably worth family  trip using restaurant com coupons  <EOR> great place    contemporary inside setting feel comfortable  Tried Faluda drink amazing Lamb shawarma amazing  Biriani really plain compare indian restaurant average biryani  come some solution that  Samosa great tried salad didn't impress all   try again     <EOR> Surprisingly upscale interior relatively traditional menu apps wraps plates even Halal desserts round menu featuring currys other Indian specialties weekends  also several vegetarian vegan options   Interior very nice fact walk counter kind odd and two them?   sure why layout chosen over offering table service  Pricing fair most items but some need come down $8 10 wrap without side little steep considering fast casual setup chose implement  But adjusted pricing some items doubling originally 2 piece falafel app 4 pieces same $5 price tag  But $10 wrap should side   Falafel good but falafel wrap dry highly suggest adding hummus babaghanouj moisture added flavor  Unfortunately drizzle tzatziki sauce doesn't quite cut it   Veggie samosa tasty sided red Lazeez's sauce surprisingly balanced combo fruit based sauce balances heat filling  But don't understand why 1 smallish veggie samosa $2 50 while order 4 chicken samosas $5   Tip management even if don't offer table service away red plastic baskets serving your meals they're cheap looking  Invest real dishes silverware  remove Bus your own tables! note above trash tacky  <EOR> Absolutely amazing!!! Deliciously fresh tasty!!!! Beautiful ambience!! Very caring friendly staff!! far best town!! <EOR> So searching Indian food close house long! ordered Falafel Vegetarian Appetizer plate poree  also chance try Aaloo Cholay  Everything perfect   spices beautiful falafel crunchy outside lovely texture inside  Also  staff amazing well  am excited back try more food  <EOR> At first when walked thought uh oh going very expensive restaurant   decor beautiful  turns order counter bring food you   Shawrma also chicken Boti  Both full flavor  service exceptionally friendly  Lots food which great because now delicious lunch tomorrow   Lazeez wonderful place   recommend it  <EOR>
