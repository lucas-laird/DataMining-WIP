Excellent pizza vibes  Definitely new favorite pizza joint!!  Can't wait happy hour restaurant open up  <EOR> Great pizza awesome spot  owners served outside super friendly   back again soon! <EOR> This good pizza   something Vegas highly lacks in  back   It didn't look would taste good did  pizza dough spot on    <EOR> As good frozen pizza grocery aisle  Mushroom pizza few pieces canned previously frozen mushrooms  Mushrooms soggy ugly tasteless  all three employees behind counter greet nor thank your patronage  Maybe service only thing authentic New York style? <EOR> Great flavor chicken bbq needs more chicken though but great slice!  garlic knots need more garlic butter soaked but just tastes bread little butter flavor over all great experience less then $10 meal 1 person  back! <EOR> Stopped 30 minutes before close slice pepperoni  swear frozen pizza Albertson's tastes better this  Also only 5 pieces pepperoni  Pizza Hut tastes better this    <EOR> Solid 4 stars!  I've craving pizza back home  wanted slice little grease cheese melted perfectly slightly sweet sauce crust cooked perfectly when fold bottom lip falls over  wasn't expecting much  pizza looked maybe 5 7 minutes generally don't way reheat but since quick came quite delicious! I'd prefer little sweeter sauce but all all pretty good  imagine fresh pie would even better  $3 45 plain slice but Downtown Summerlin expected  didn't take home menu dont offer much else besides pizza  I'd suggest coming around lunch dinnertime when pizza should kinda fresh  definitely back here  <EOR> I'm pretty sure place built pizza restaurant    super small when there's few people line only place line door where people sitting eating  Another weird thing noticed trash opening didn't fit plates serve pizza on   It's 8 inch opening crack plates half able throw them away    Very odd  staff young rude seemed robotic  last but least didn't cheese pepper shakers  kind pizza place this?! asked Parmesan cheese she under counter give packet  When asked two she roller eyes lol  last straw me! plenty other places eat downtown Summerlin  <EOR> Not much say  whole supreme also slice cheese  Both greasy  sausage thickly sliced bland  Crust thin which made soggy  Overall flavor so so  No bathrooms establishment patrons could see  Small joint did feel neighborhood pizza place NY  kind pizza though  <EOR> Decent quick lunch option Downtown Summerlin sell pie slice  Snagged $4 pepperoni slice decent crust but thin foldable type expected NY name  appreciated slice wasn't greasy but didn't really way reheated it  Layout interior does facilitate any sort line but some outdoor seating available   Note Yelp check offer $1 off purchase over $5 yourself favor order slice plus garlic knot carby discount actually less slice alone  You're welcome  <EOR> Strolling through DTS looking joint hadn't hit yet made wrong choice picking Bonanno's   just okay    nothing special  feel little ashamed them bill themselves authentic Italian pizza  really not   Flavors feel very corporate if sense  real Sysco flavor sauce tomato paste y side greasy mozzarella most 9 year olds won't complain but adults should want more   crust no real life mouth feel it nice crispy chewy feel you'd want but more baked airy crumble texture there's some oily buttery ness going shouldn't happening   pizza oven new really seasoned broken no added flavor coming that   There's actually cook timer which disheartening  Really?   can't cook slice pie look feel?   authentic Oh yeah price    $9 08 cheese slice tomato basil slice  product overpriced  When back water Aquafina $3 18  Pass   I guess okay pinch many any other pizza joints do  Again special which means shouldn't around  If you're going spend money opening place Downtown Summerlin bill yourselves if then that  right    whatever is  <EOR> Very good NY style Italian Food Pizza   outdoor patio bar tables   delicious garlic knots table along mini antipasto   we shared Margarita pizza Chicken Parmagian Penne ALa Vodka <EOR>
