Great sushi bar   fresh fish clean flavors generous portions!  Going any restaurant first month since being open always little worriesome because there's many kinks work out  However hearing many friends coworkers sushi absolutely great trip out  dining room isn't terribly large maybe seats 30 inside but there's large outdoor patio which could see myself sitting during cooler months vegas  However sushi bar itself seats 12 when arrived lunch being open only few weeks surprised but happy see half sushi bar already taken few tables dispersed throughout    Looking over menu prices weren't bad all good lunch roll specials  hot foods menu very limited but roll list more it  chef recommended Blue Fin Roll' die for! tried couple other rolls well some sushi tuna poke salad yum!    All fish extremely fresh well cut  Most importantly flavors clean well balanced  Something appreciated most  Service ok waitress's first day work nothing I'd hold them against  sushi chefs extremely friendly quick   Now here's thing    land all u can eat sushi bar town don't it  But probably ended being cheaper all u can eat because rolls big even cancel couple more wanted try knowing no way bf could finish them and we're big eaters begin with! quality fish greatly surpassed most sushi restaurants town    If appreciated great fish flavors highly recommend place! If you're looking just fill don't care tastes I'd say you're better off sticking any all u can eat town  <EOR>
