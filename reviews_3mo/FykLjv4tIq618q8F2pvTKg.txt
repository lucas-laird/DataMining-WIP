I honestly would give place 1 star but give SOME benefit doubt   Hell first 1 2 star score given yelper     I start saying ate different Krazy Buffet several months ago worst place ever ate food at   didn't yelp account back then but roommate loved place   He convinced come figured Grand Opening should trying hard impress! grab some orange chicken BBQ pork fried rice some sweet sour chicken start and side wanton soup    Orange chicken luke warm just flat soggy awful texture wasn't fan all   couldn't finish wanton soup fried rice nice buffer taste orange chicken mouth  BBQ Pork did taste candy which pretty random   So unimpressed start   But hey keep trying more food   grabbed some sushi they actually decent amount sushi selection  plus teriyaki chicken some french fries couple other random selections   I just don't know why all food kept eating felt barely experiencing any flavor   also pretty sad favorite thing eat french fries   Actually jumped gun sushi did seem fresh did enjoy roll eel top   The service LOL bad think waiter came once asked if needed refill   Then he refilled cups he spilled some water somewhat noticeable roommates food   He probably didn't notice but waiter completely ignored he done then walked off   I'm gonna stick hometown buffets where food always fresh delicious very professional nearly half price   Geez honestly hate giving bad reviews but dammit place caused write yelp review 3 month hiatus   If anyone knows some good Chinese buffets am all ears  tl dr version bad all around except some sushi   Even though says 2 stars give place 1 5 stars  won't come back again <EOR> I fan old Krazy Buffet fan new one   If you've never best asian buffets   Sushi really good  tonight some best salmon nigiri awhile including regular sushi joints   Dinner $11 49 believe send $1 10% off coupons semi regularly   almost 5 stars but Pacific Seafood Buffet being $7 49 dinner without coupon having better selection just can't   But Krazy Buffet wins customer service sure! <EOR> I know  Five stars? asian buffet?  Well its gormet but best asian buffet ever had   Friendly staff nice decor  old Lone Star closed years ago  sushi varied fresh   pork dumpling lot flavor   cold shrimp should devained but still good   favorites coconut shrimp sushi cream cheese   Oh cream cheese wontons good too   high marks fresh flavorful food   only fear just opened  may sacrifice quality profits over time   But now highly recommended  <EOR> This place mediocre nothing really appealed me   You tell walking place used something else because seating didn't seem match anything    The food selection blah   section crab legs cooked oysters shell shrimp imitation crab filled crab shell  BTW charge extra touching anything section   the next section your soups fried dessert typical chinese food selection   the next section sushi station rice sushi hard popped off daughters braces while trying gnaw it   they 2 sections desert  section raw meat veggies overall having pay $30 daughter together definitely worth it  could've gone panda express would've better meal place   i returning    blah  no thanks ! would rather feast any station casinos cheaper  <EOR> It's rare leave Chinese buffet dash home write review but damn Krazy Buffet good  newly opened near Desert Shores neighborhood say welcome addition  Everything's new clean shiny did nice job remodeling place   But most importantly food really good  There's wide selection Chinese dishes heavy emphasis seafood  Everything very fresh favors just right  addition Chinese dishes also surprisingly good sushi Mongolian grill where chefs stir fry just you  Bonus points plethora fresh fruit including Hawaiian papayas   And speaking Hawaiians lots local families judging bumper stickers parking lot  Always good sign any Asian restaurant   Last but least service top notch  Let repeat good service Chinese restaurant buffet no less  Damn may never eat Panda Express again  Yipeeee! <EOR> The BBQ area cooked buffet meals ever had! beef red green peppers broccoli mushrooms garlic hot chili sauce  Came outstanding!  Other pretty good selection  biggest buffet you'll ever see  However did sea bass well spicy octopus  Neither those would ever expect see lunch buffet   The desserts tad lackluster  used Pacific Buffet where ice cream served bowl  Personally care vanilla swirl soft serve  Ended going Golden Spoon eating take care frozen dessert craving   All all solid price fairly good lunch buffet  best town? sure but great value  <EOR>
