I saw opened new Roberto's new strip mall near southwest corner Boulder Hwy Russel Rd  sure exact address   I seen Roberto's elsewhere valley decided give them try  tried place twice now both times food barely edible   First time visited beef taco platter  First thing disliked use shredded beef instead ground beef  beef very tough stringy  took forever chew eventually swallow  took cheapest beef cut available boiled hell it  juices coming watery bland  refried beans loose runny  only decent part meal Spanish rice which OK   Yesterday decided give them second try figuring maybe just ordered wrong thing last time  time decided order chicken instead beef  taco enchilada platter   I cut into enchilada forked big chunk chicken which looked OK popped mouth trying chew wad wet newspaper  no idea cooked chicken texture complete lack taste  never tough stringy white meat chicken before  literally picking chicken fibers teeth half hour afterward   I gave best shot 2 times just fairness but won't eating again  just bad!  I see other Roberto's great reviews hear franchise operations different owners menus sometimes maybe restaurant isn't others let's hope  <EOR> This place horrible  take little bad service but food sucks  Can't see place still open  rather Taco Bell across street instead  Lol  pretty bad  <EOR>
