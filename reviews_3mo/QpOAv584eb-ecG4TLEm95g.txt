I've waiting China open quite some time  just something beef broccoli tried another location theirs  flavorful   I drove lunch today happy see grand opening sign  sure if any actual grand opening specials but didn't care  wanted verify if previous beef broccoli experience just fluke if real  expected dish lunch special choices available $5 95   I still don't know beef broccoli but indeed damn flavorful! Next time sure all rice instead half rice half chow mein  need much rice possible order soak all delicious sauce  may even need white rice instead fried   Will return? old quote    betcha! <EOR> My fave chinese take out  food fresh tasty low prices  <EOR> The food very good   far Broccoli Beef Hot Garlic Chicken   Both very good portions enough feed twice   Prices also pretty good lunch specials around 6 bucks   If eat free soup well   Ive few times now food always good always feeds several times   could never eat lunch special sitting   Also prices very cheap    Overall am pretty happy place certainly going again again  <EOR>
