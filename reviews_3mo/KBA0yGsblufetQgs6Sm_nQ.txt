Great place eat    Outstanding service soon walk ordered empanadas de Cameron appetizer   seven seas soup eat <EOR> I've never left any reviews but place fairly new loved it!!!! If looking authentic Mexican food place go!!! Just short drive off strip  Price reasonable  Food amazing staff very friendly  Wish would've taken pictures before ate  But definitely back once town again!!! <EOR> Growing Mexican family very often find Mexican restaurant lives your expectations  being said 7 mares did exceeded lofty expectations  food prepared very traditional Mexican manner quality fish great! Bundle great service attentive staff almost great grandmother's house  would recommend getting variety plates sharing  molcajetes camarones la diabla personal favorites! <EOR> Reasonable prices great food goods services don't let location deceive you  Fresh seafood  ceviche de pescado tostada pretty big filling but try something else shrimp breaded tacos top notch! <EOR>
