Not bad airport food   course its no full service restaurant but Enchiladas weren't bad   The tortillas didn't seem dry wasn't drenched much sauce   able eat entire thing off plate but wasn't sure if because feeling slightly buzzed drinks before took cab airport   My friend ordered chicken quesadilla   Yeah never having that   looked all shreded chicken no cheese    HMMM delicious NOT  <EOR> Really horrid mexican texan food but decent airport stuff   I'd avoid if all possible  <EOR>
