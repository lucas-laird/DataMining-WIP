Seen establishment listed Groupon didn't think could eat ten hamburgers thought would stop purchase few  single double fries chocolate shake  Cheeseburgers tasted exactly White Castle  Call crazy but same great taste  place minimart which horrible location no seating  chocolate shake just vanilla shake chocolate syrup top  said burgers shake fries awesome  Cheeseburgers only 69 cents  wish drive thru  also 5 00 box 4 burgers fries drink  back!!!!! <EOR> I wouldn't way come again but tiny White Castle esque burgers good flavor  fries also spot on skinny salty tiny bit limp   Pricing fair currently Groupon up   Location leaves lot desired yes gas station convenience store  But also kind seedy intersection run down plaza vaguely dirty store  Quickee area also oddly blocked off dine in counters but no stools?  Not sure if shorted drink #2 combo if somehow doesn't come but adding cheese essential maintaining WC taste  $6 four piece meal bad lunch  <EOR> It gas station burger place   Slightly better gas station microwave burrito but much better   Made stomachs hurt but least know where if am constipated   going give 3 stars but employees working without gloves lost star  <EOR> So check place surprised located inside am pm corner Craig Rancho  location could lot better but burger fries more it! fries taste great light crispy good salt ratio  burgers very simple patty grilled onions cheese pickle Although very simple great! white castle vibe when hot down right addicting! see guys coming future could add some different cheese options pepperjack swiss maybe? Just set themselves apart white castle  going big thing really think white castle thing going least burgers matter not bad thing way say back enjoy quicker burgers fun eat where else piece birthday cake your burger? <EOR> Love some sliders fries awesome!

Stone cold dry!  Anyway come find man standing four feet whole time   thought he loiterer just obnoxious patron dressed street person   Come find he owner he made focus offend all seven people place before left   WOW!  If want disrespected sold low standard food there  Otherwise wait real deal future when White Castle opens strip   I really wanted good experience cause love sliders but    Oh well! <EOR> I didn't food couldn't past server   burgers must made advance sit wait couldn't them without cheese  top no other customers site chef over 20 burgers grill  If want dried old food here  Otherwise even burger king burger when order it  <EOR> I really really hoping give place great rating but am unable to  Whoever says burgers taste White Castle obviously never Real White Castle Burger'  Even though cooked fresh tasted old  Red Velvet Birthday Cake really gives Birthday Feeling tasted melted wax candle  sure if use cream cheese base frosting but tasted kinda off  Everyone different may it  going back  Time bust tums  stomach feels just let loose  #gross!!! <EOR> The fries way salty  stop eating them would gag salt  never salty any food anywhere gross  Ease salt  Burgers just ok  <EOR> The burgers okay best  fries extremely salty enjoy really salty fries  twice salty Mcdonalds fries if gives idea  Over all food TASTE wasn't bad    The food poisoning everyone food however was  Three people ate three people each food poisoning  never eat again  <EOR> We excited try burgers made 30 min drive  shocked find dirty gas station  play safe ordered before ordered whole family  Took bite tasted microwaved burger super gross  ended driving totally disappointed    <EOR> I want give place higher rating because fabulous young lady took order but unfortunately food wasn't good   Quickee located inside ARCO gas station corner Rancho Craig   Believe me    this prime location some people watching   if know mean!  The menu limited cheeseburgers fries soda black white which version shake   cheeseburgers small White Castle   onions pickles cheese mustard them    For fast food guess ok   don't hold fry In Out burgers sure   bread soggy patty pretty flavorless  fries came lukewarm weren't anything above average taste   The service great though within 10 minutes    best thing shake   would back them if hankering shake again   wouldn't return location dark however  <EOR> I liked burgers fries lot  only wish establishment bigger but overall enjoyed experience  <EOR> Ok tried place first time today  saw groupon deal used that  located inside Arco gas station  Small window type place 2 bar seats available eat there    Their sliders supposed White Castle   Very similar look come onions pickles  choice cheese no cheese    I wanted love burgers  can't say did  patties tasted plain cheap frozen   add mustard ketchup disguise taste patties little  vanilla milk shake reminded frosty vanilla pudding  Nothing amazing    This place potential great idea  Maybe some tweaks food bring them next level  service fast friendly  gentleman helped seemed really excited enthused business  Kitchen counter area looked clean  more 2 5 review just friendly fast service  <EOR> If plan purchasing groupon keep mind does work online ordering  also cannot changes any order uses Groupon if allergies anything comes burger probably shouldn't purchase use Groupon  Cash only inside store  Good luck <EOR> Ordered Grub hub today wasn't sure expect  werent disappointed when food showed up    The burgers exactly expecting very similar white castle sliders  Pretty tasty though  real winners though fries easily some best fries long time    For price some damn good food  <EOR> Really much great comparison White Castle even frozen ones    give 2 1 2 stars although opening week maybe quality assurance better now   Was excited hear some White Castle 'competition' coming town Quickee Burgers   note no actual Quickee Burgers restaurant find jaunt into AM PM corner Craig Rancho home same strip mall where great Thai food albeit bar     Quickee Burgers located inside small area   Really only takeout no real seating anywhere unless add few stools eventually   order take home eat standing up   Found Groupon would feed two folks $10 but managed stretch four   Comes 10 Quickee Burgers cheese 2 orders fries 2 milkshakes we opted Black White combo vanilla chocolate    also picked free slice Red Velvet birthday cake when checking Yelp not sure if  still available    Order quick but prep really slow   Granted grand opening folks still trying learn communicate each other   15 minute wait order ready go   Honestly really disappointed quality Quickee Burgers burgers   tad larger ones White Castle but damn pretty flavorless   Buns good but cold side would helped warming grill   Burgers?  Dry bone lacked much flavor   Would benefit if cooked White Castle does poke holes burgers steam grilled onions below moisten flavor patty   Easily patties all overcooked lifeless   really sure if even used salt pepper them!  Condiments norm cheese some sort cheddar although bordering Kraft singles some onion bits pickle mustard ketchup   But still overall burger dry   ended adding some mayo mine them back par   Fries OK though   Thin salty but quite cooked enough   All limp before home   Maybe bit more time oil would made them much better   But taste good   Shakes pretty mediocre   Shakes light having much air mixing machine   close thick shake all but cheap soft serve   Plus cloyingly sweet!  Really artificial taste them probably shake mix   Wasn't favorite   Although looked super cheesy Red Velvet birthday cake actually pretty good   just plain sheet cake covered birthday frosting but cake itself moist     Was good effort Quickee Burgers   But think stick waiting until White Castle actually comes Las Vegas soon baby soon    just opt buying frozen ones local warehouse store reheat them pan   Unless quality your burger improves few bounds sure back anytime soon   Taste need taste!  THE QUICK DEAD  <EOR> I back give place another shot because don't want just give new business mediocre experience  time ended just leaving without buying any food because they've apparently changed rules any modifications burgers  sure if cashier just being lazy if really norm now  Please    food establishment people food allergies! won't very far if you're unwilling exceptions  <EOR> have few times groupons its bad   def  white castle but my boys no problem devouring burgers fries shakes when don't wanna cook    this works me  lol   everyone very pleasant food cooked when ordered it  Don't expect gourmet stuff   it is  <EOR> Just terrible   Took 2 hours food then food cold stale   Asked discount offered more crappy burgers   worst  <EOR> We Quickee Burgers first time last night    boyfriend 4 burgers Bronson shake  He loooooooved burgers shake die for  man register hoot! He turned grumpy face frown upside down  He pleasant energetic  funny! definitely going back  let fact little joint inside gas station     kind gives special gem charm  little hidden treasure! <EOR> I excited try place  orginally Midwest miss White Castle dearly  sorry say place hardly comes close  burgers weren't great tasting despite just coming off grill sort cold I ate soon car also expecting its own building drive thru but wasn't huge deal  definitely wouldn't hesitate another trip if food good  girl took order really nice though  She short hair cut should gotten name but unless something changes won't going back  <EOR> The first time  came closed early some reason decided give them another chance earlier day     Today unfriendly cashier waited until paid food tell diet coke   Actually say drink then she let know only coke    no customer service skills extremely slow    Well rude reply owner certainly doesn't  help   dead issue far concerned because never give place another penny   However employees shouldn't say just ran something carry  <EOR> Burgers incredible  Fries best long time  gentleman working behind counter very friendly  DEFINITELY going back <EOR>
