Not sure think place yet  But tell 3 things got   Cabeza Taco AMAZING  rich smooth cut salsa salsa bar really want bad boys taste!  Chorizo Taco sorta dry which despite rich sure meat bit shocking   Al Pastor Torta really quite terrible  whole thing dry pastor bland  wasn't any mayo cheese moisten restaurant based various graphics bills itself pastor joint you'd think they'd able better   I guess maybe should advertise pictures cabeza? probably because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good <EOR> Al Pastor carved off spit  little early wasnt very crispy yet but back try again when Im town  Chorizo egg burrito good  Carne Asada tacos really good   They serve whole beans top which reminds way friend's dad used them middle desert cooking over campfire  <EOR>
