I Love Jimmy John's always have  trip Jimmy John's first any since moving Vegas back November  may seem much but coming Michigan State campus Jimmy John's and having 3 friends worked needless say often  know mistakes made times if often busy franchise JJ's  But forgetting simple request peppers #12 when 4 1 sandwich architect to customer ratio inexcusable   It's if won't return because Jimmy John's Jimmy John's am right? But come on  request 'Pep' receipt paid show pep! Also overheard No #15 16 girl behind counter rookie mistakes excusable  No problem   Next time put little pep your step order right back more often not  <EOR> Delicious  website lets sandwiches online live updated nutritional information which did think little carried away   walked ordered BLT Unwich triple bacon avocado spread instead mayo onions hot peppers double add roast beef  took all stride made exactly asked asking it    They're fast very personable joking around amount calories custom sandwich but I'd ordered without bread  informed them did no bread cut gluten save calories which then made sense them    Great location definitely back  Especially since discovered they'll lettuce wrap which call Unwich online sandwich builder tool  <EOR> Drivethru big plus !!! Delivery phone online  Also plus!! If very nice! many happy workers well  Heavily staffed yes Sandwhich made fast!!! same time great tasting <EOR> Subs pretty good  good Firehouse but much better then Subway Quiznos  Each sandwich shop own unique taste  theres  Tasty bread  Could use more meat  little much mayo lettuce but alot lettuce just ask might mayo next visit    I called delivery door within 11 minutes  Cant say any pizza joint pull that  <EOR> The only better BLT JJBLT your momma's    Crusty crunchy french bread thick layer mayo 8 hearty slices bacon shredded lettuce tomato slices staple sandwich win book    I'm normally disappointed any sub style BLT order because bread overwhelms measly portion bacon feel eating lettuce tomato sandwich bacon bits there    But JJBLT where fix without incurring grease scars frying own bacon seriously does anyone tips splatter damage hands wrists?!     This spot head late night munchie unfortunately close pretty early 9pm which why docked star    They however deliver drive through which tickles lazy bone's fancy  also call ahead your order ready but considering put your sandwich together 47 seconds necessary   I work odd hours which allows frequent businesses during off hours times never during lunch dinner rushes couldn't tell quick when there's more two people ordering     The decor standard JJ's funny punny placards placed all open airy   Don't leave without getting few loafs day old bread $0 50  always pick few garlic cheesey bread crustinis bread pudding anything would need sliced bread for  <EOR> I usually wouldn't review chain JJ unless something specific location   ordered couple sandwiches ahead carryout popped $2 delivery fee    Total BS   wish would noticed before home   Boo!  Quit stealing money   The sandwiches course JJ pretty tasty sweet bread   Just beware here   Don't order your sandwich ahead time rob you  <EOR> Bumping 4 stars !!!
