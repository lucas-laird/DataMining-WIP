I surprised hear Korean restaurants existed Vegas shocked hear even small community albeit small Korean people living there  Since then seen them large cheap lots need some cheering possibly lack customers really they're much bigger need hey gotta goals seen many restaurants pop various places southern California sadly come go   But nice bright small take out type place few tables if want waiter service  Las Vegas tourists know nothing Korean food locals know nothing Korean food well menu simple yet retains authentic flavor uses ingredients    For Las Vegas surprisingly good doing well being relatively newly developed area  would see more items menu but its own purposes keeps its customers happy  Maybe year expand beyond rice combinations bulk menu few other dishes   would cold noodle ones please Vegas heat kills me  <EOR>
