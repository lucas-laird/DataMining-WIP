Well past week two salads panini  bought two Groupon coupons very excited try this    didn't problem price but quality taste   Really hard screw salad sandwich but nothing very appetizing actually threw most last salad away  <EOR> I tell  really reluctant because thought Souper Salad Sweet Tomatoes    When fact nothing those!! place great best way put subway salads!!!   You pick your type lettuce spinach romaine then pick salad menu create your own all toppings including but limited nuts berries dressings crutons Veggies Jalepeno pepperchinis    etc !!  Plus staff mixes all great tools never seen before   always ask dressing side because then take home use your own salad   would recommend raspberry dressing YUMMY!!!   A large which served very cute fun bowl $8 wow stuffed off meal!     All all AMAZING taste presentation! D <EOR>
