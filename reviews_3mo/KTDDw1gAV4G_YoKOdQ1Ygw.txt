I must preface first saying am Hawaaiian  aside food   The teriyaki sauce place die for  teriyaki cheeseburger favorite burgers town even above Out   big but tons delicious flavor  because size burger you'd probably home don't feel disgusting eating it   Their macaroni salad not vegetarian safe creamy very good  small amount tuna I think while may sound gross actually quite awesome  Just trust me   Their short ribs kind fatty didn't them very much but everything else tried including gravy yummy  <EOR>
