She constantly checked table even remaining hour sat ordering more beer food    Beer friend mark stated different review same establishment lot beer just good beer  tried Dogfish Head 90 minute which he insisted no good agree  no 90 minute  malty resembled taste any IPA bad over time  excited see season Grapefruit Sculpin Ballast Point beer menu but unfortunately ran out  Therefore opted regular Sculpin    Food best thing menu buffalo wings  ordered burger alright but opinion big  could save some money making dish smaller  worst item pulled pork nachos  surprised see use fresh jalapeños nachos but even more surprised when dish served cold cheese meat    Extras menu four one sided pages clipped plastic board  If going continue sports theme few things need happen  1  rid clip boards 2  menus page two sided you still achieve coach look way 3  Never mean never print another marketing material menu again doesn't take both sides paper  <EOR> The good server Kim awesome  She friendly super helpful since first time  wings quality although 20 wings ordered only 2 drums  Not end world The bad PKWY advertises 250 beers beer club rewards customers drinking lots different beers  However self described beer bar selection big  Just big great  Most beers offered available stores Las Vegas  obviously far less money   The ugly Dogfish Head 90 minute pint ordered tasted awful bad lines which would strange new place old beer also strange new place sure which  Sent back  First server before awesome Kim seemed confused menu helpful  shift ending which turned good both us   Ordered nachos pulled pork  Both pulled pork cheese sauce ice cold when nachos arrived  Sent them back  Burgers just okay served very large dry bulkie roll    Owner floating around flirting female guests staff  never once saw check any other guests  walked in three times host never acknowledged there   Won't back  Sorry Kim  <EOR> What happened RoadRunner?? Did Coyote eat cook? Parkway Tavern spot if looking shitty food crappy service  Watched Jamiey gossip bartender while waited cocktail wife waited iced tea  Funny part bartender did job       Food sucks  sorry  give 1 star reviews but if same owner    your stuff  together    want give money      I want GREAT service GREAT food home         <EOR> We used place when Roadrunner saloon thought would try new place  First thing hits when walk college type atmosphere  entire patio Astroturf where play games beer pong while drink  Although isn't really kind scene willing give food try since menu looked decent  menu pretty basic burgers wraps salads etc  Although if want steak salad ready fork over $18! ordered fried pickles big Texan burger chipotle chicken sliders  First negatives   the pickles burnt burger way salty both onions jalapeños fried no variety texture chicken sliders dry seasoned very well  positives    waitress great 250 different kinds beer  Bottom line if you're looking somewhere drink good variety beer college vibe probably place  If looking good meal   you should probably keep looking  <EOR> This place potential but need serve beers listed find bartender knows beer    first 3 beers tried order out   When asked bartender Justin recommendation favorites he replied don't drink beer prefer liquor   Seriously dude?!  think looks nicer brighter cleaner then old place but service really needs help if want repeat customers  <EOR> I really wanted place based beer selection alone    The service some slowest ever had  took better 20 minutes beer ordered even though assured way 5 minutes ordered  second beer ordered even worse wait time  order she leaves presumably put order then comes back tell beers way then COMES BACK table tell beers ordered no longer offered    way out?!  The food was    okay best  wasn't horrible all but wasn't anything crazy over either  While on Saturday afternoon saw least 2 parties come seat themselves then leave because nobody came over wait them   The place itself seems could really cool spot hang out  Lots TVs some pool tables some crazy bowling alley thing patio all looked good time but something done speed service there  could overlook mediocre food if everything else line   All all may back just anytime soon  <EOR> Bad service awful miserable bartender should probably think different profession  <EOR> We decided try place again miss Roadrunner great steaks   happy see favorite server still but weren't happy sat bar because having some sort party dinning area where its quieter   ordered prime rib flavorful but 1 4 fat didnt enjoy all it   probably wont run back  <EOR> We high hopes soon figured much  pretty much stick beer basics ordered corona bottle   First off felt just put cooler  Just cool cold  Then didn't even lime  husband asked join beer club response bring ipad never ipad! service terribly slow when asked questions happy hour took over 5 min answer  No fault waitress new but isn't restaurant pretty new? put blame managers don't train staff properly when only 4 tables occupied whole place should least touch every see things going  going order food but just wanted can't comment that   Thursday afternoon around 2 hoping would new spot grab drink bite but much! <EOR> I wish could say service staff attentive because ambiance really fun  Good music people having fun but 3 hrs now only approached waitress 3 times  feel could done much better job checking table drink gone empty well husband's drink quite few times only chance order two drinks 3 hours  disappointed wish could come again but due service brunette waitress can't come again ignored  Thanks good food beer selection  first two beer choices available coincidentally two other beers table chose  <EOR> Stopped lunch Saturday  Only 5 tables occupied   Couldn't even anyone acknowledge us   No greeting   No hey u minute  Place looked really cool  Can't even comment menu since never look one   Completely disappointing  live neighborhood always eager try new restaurants bars open up  If norm pkwy don't expect doors open long  <EOR> Great atmosphere beer rewards program beer selection   Much better RoadRunner used here    <EOR> Great place hangout locals   Darts bowling beer pong ping pong board games more    Perfect place gather friends drinks fun  200+ beers great service   Much better original Road Runner  Cheers! <EOR> A friend mine told place said worth check because cool bartenders fabulous beer selection wife check last night     Pros Friendly staff hostess busboy large beer selection on paper least nice outdoor patio area  Cons SLOW Service Food 1 1 2  start best beer list quite accurate  We met hostess way told interested sitting bar area which open seating   picked table she brought menus told server would right us   time 10 people bar only table 3 guys whole bar area   sat table approximately 10 minutes before server looked least 5 times but busy flirting table 3 guys made table  Upon taking drink order took another 5 minutes back drinks martini ice tea     A few more minutes passed she came back food order which time placed first attempt bottled beer listed beer menu   looking confusion verifying actually reading beer off menu she back place orders   few minutes later she returned telling beer   ordered another beer few minutes received same response out   Well point just old standby Corona     My wife ordered Prime Rib Melt   sandwich came side fries   Upon reviewing menu again write states all sandwiches come choice side no choice given   However besides being little greasy she sandwich commented fries nice crispy without being overcooked     I ordered Blackened Shrimp Grits   really looking forward dish but when came immediately sensed would utter disappointment wrong   grits  congealed point whole top layer made smooth mold   mold grits 5 shrimp   cut into first shrimp realized no way fresh but definitely frozen extremely overcooked   All five shrimp tough rubbery could used them game racquetball   Additionally flavor very bland which blackened dish would expect case   Also server did offer side $15 95 all received 5 tasteless rubbery shrimp mold cheese flavored grits   Very very disappointing    While eating server came over over once 15 minutes received food food brought bus boy gave way better service pushed check because she getting off shortly wanted close out  used work service industry both bartender bar manager definitely training would provided staff when come customer service     All all much would really enjoy place falls short many levels   Needless say all other dinning options Vegas available locals won't going back  <EOR> My first impression good   wife visited location Saturday afternoon experience less satisfactory   store still process being remodeled during visit   tell vibe few customers bartender attendance depressing   bartender seemed burnt few customers just nasty  Negative energy feeding off negative energy   sucking life leave  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised   Fairly cheap drinks multiple oversized fun games   way better then road runner before   Over all good times all around  <EOR>
