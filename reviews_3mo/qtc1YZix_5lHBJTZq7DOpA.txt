I hear Sinatra ate     Hands down best Italian Vegas maybe all points west Vegas   didn't reservation but fairly late 9pm place wasn't crowed  allowed wait only 20min  upstairs table view overlooking Grand Canal       recommend call ahead reserve it's worth it     few drinks downstairs bar area and wouldn't minded if wait bit longer   menu heavily weighted towards seafood dishes staff seams all Italy It's Vegas! Everythings imported guess ambiance fantastic  place highly priced if you're drinking don't expect escape bill under $100 per  Our's $185 two if w o tip which included couple Peroni's glasses Chianti   <EOR> I've couple times outstanding both occasions!  menu does lean heavily toward seafood but use really fresh ingredients  sea bass disappointed all!  service superb!  Like Tom P  said call ahead table overlooking Grand Canal! <EOR>
