I stressed beginning wait airport all wanted Bloody Mary  Luckily hatched thought right outside Home Turf Sports Bar which advertised mile high bloody mary's   walked found messy confusing  really unclear whether should sit down waited bar order  fact exacerbated fact standing room only bar 5 feet bar serve alcohol which hard tell if there's line just people chilling     Aside double Bloody Mary 10 bucks bad airport but definitely wasn't mile high anything should boasting awesomeness  could made just good home  Honestly  being said    glad drink place rest hat bit  Definitely 3 star worthy  <EOR>
