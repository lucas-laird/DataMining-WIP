Just opened  Pho T group 5 people  Each ordered something different  Everyone really enjoyed food  Generous servings   definitely back often  <EOR> Was excited Vietnamese restaurant opened east side give place try! warn review very picky because pho all time favorite food high expectations   Service staff greeted quickly very attentive overall  family came five minutes ordered received both spring rolls entrees before mine  appeared know staff but still seemed off especially because dining myself    Atmosphere very clean open inviting  Choice seats bar tables booths  little hesitant food because menu kind mess  lot items crossed off black marker which seemed odd since just opened pictures menu did look appealing all especially picture spring rolls  also disappointed all pho options beef only  No chicken seafood meatless options seen  large range noodle options though which nice  Also surprised did serve boba crossed off Thai tea nowhere menu   Food ordered spring rolls flank brisket pho  spring rolls really good very fresh! wish served mint leaves but still quite good  pho itself pretty good I'd give 7 5 10  Great flavor  biggest complaint way many onions actually more onions beef  best Vegas but far worst  <EOR> So waiting try place when spotted months ago  convienent far home but        Vietnamese place Eastside ?
