After enjoying rides Adventure Dome Circus Circus wife 4 yo son decided eat Mexitalia since front dome  didn't mind cafeteria type service which means wait line order then when number called pick order  ordered fish tacos wife beef tacos son mac cheese  When food cold! Mind 2nd people line! fish fresh reminded frozen fish tater tots! wife's beef tough! kicker even 4 yo old son spit mac cheese out! He said yucky!!! anyone mess mac cheese! STAY AWAY PLACE <EOR> You're going sick but isn't very good    Fast expensive close gambling needs anything else? stuck needing food 10 pm Circus Circus open  Overpriced alot salsa good everything else boring flavorless  But food didn't drive somewhere else  <EOR>
