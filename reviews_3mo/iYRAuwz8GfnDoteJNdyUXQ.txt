I really wish could give restaurant more stars but unfortunately nothing really sticks mind   The Katsu average even slightly dry side   The Kalbi average maybe slightly over sweet  All rolls remind rolls pick grocery Vegas Express Shushi  In fact only thing slightly peeks above average Mango Salad  Typical garden salad but mango chunks but nice zesty vinaigrette contrasts well sweetness mango There's nothing bad service always fast friendly just nothing really pushes over top into higher ranking  Recommended if just need Hawaiian food fix can't bothered Aloha Island  <EOR>
