We stumbled Rock Roll Sushi  thought would take shot   Boy glad did! visitors Las Vegas very easy overspend meal inadequate food but here    The All You Can Eat lunch just $21 95! Sushi Chef Kiyo masterful! Everything delicious visually stunning  Kiyo skilled friendly making sure variety sushi  fish flawlessly fresh flavorful    Dinner just $5 oo more  Don't miss it!  Get your hotel enjoy local restaurant! <EOR> I happened first review hoped best  showing around 10 pm late dinner slightly concerned only patrons  But then again Sushi bar definitely benefits   The fish fresh service great price reasonable  If doing AYCE 25$ dinner skip dynamite ok but seafood mayo concoction served over salad instead rice detracted nigiri where your appetite would better focused  Liked albacore! Money well spent  <EOR> We saw sign advertising $20 all you can eat sushi bit skeptical but decided give try  Oh yeah! Rock n Roll Sushi serves some best sushi had  tend sashimi didn't try many rolls  Everything good but mackerel incredible    Rock n Roll Sushi located small strip mall parking easy  right off Strip between Riviera Wynn  <EOR> Well   I think could done better $25 AYCE sushi  also probably should known better when only two other patrons    Most rolls totally laden mayo making hard down  spicy tuna outside Spicy Crunch roll tasted funky awkward texture anything but fish like  albacore excellent though loaded before rolled door all fat sassy like    I'd probably hit Todai    <EOR> 4 5 stars place serves all eat sushi while you're buzzed having great time VEGAS!  food good? Sure! Everything tastes good looks good 8 beers!   But really staff couldn't nicer us  no idea ate but kept eating everything tasted good fresh   The only thing didn't add tip bill  <EOR> Stopped between flights last leg home Spain really enjoyed little place  Nice decor sushi wasn't bad but customer service outstanding! $24 95 all eat sushi or roll which anything menu  Down side no sashimi but baked lobster roll awsome! Skip miso though seaweed little chewy! <EOR> When you're Vegas all excess whether gambling drinking clubbing eating snorting coke  Uh  Yeah  meant drinking Coke  Caffeine essentially major food group Vegas   Anyway if enjoy other food groups excessive eating then Rock Roll Sushi safe bet any Vegas  $24 95 all eat made order nigiri rolls    Here rules game hour time limit order round sushi time charged if leave anything your plate    I two rounds  round some miso soup plenty nigiri salmon yellow tail albacore tuna fried spicy tuna roll rainbow roll shrimp tempura inside  round two enjoyed more salmon yellow tail albacore    The salmon delightful  albacore tasty too  yellow tail could better  fan tuna but never into tuna some reason unless toro  main grip nigiri round fish slices very small  Look came eat you're going charge if leave food behind might well belly full early   As rolls good especially fried spicy tuna roll but sloppily made  all eat joint held back rice which nice    The staff cool  interesting see female sushi chef  heard somewhere don't see many female sushi chefs because warmer hands men ruins fish  just think some urban legend Japanese men spread around Japanese women would less reason wield knife  am sure if urban legend conspiracy theory true but think other men other cultures should try too    I am sure John Wayne Bobbitt would agree  <EOR> Try dropping group 9 post college kids into Vegas some tiring travel getting everyone agree food    thank goodness Rock Roll  long walk Strip AYCE sushi much better most things you'll regret buying mega hotel casino   The rolls well sized sharing but skew towards being overly embellished  Maybe should just say if your rolls drizzled sauce fried come eat here  Edamame miso soup etc  included your AYCE meal but why fill that?  The space itself nice service friendly prompt  might preferred Sushi Mon but tourist I'd definitely eat again  <EOR> Awesome great service   Soon stepped greeted host chef   $20 all eat sushi 3 rounds   1st round ordered 12 rolls didn't wait long it    Hot Crunchy Roll must   4 only paid $90 but ate least $200 worth most definitely coming back spot next Vegas trip  <EOR>
