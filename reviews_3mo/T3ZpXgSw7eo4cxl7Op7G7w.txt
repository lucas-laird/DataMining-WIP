My receipt said Mazatlan but signs say El Patio Authentic Mexican Food   Yet another fabulous Vegas meal off strip   couldn't believe people waiting line across parking lot Chipotle when could eating here   decor tries hard   service top notch   chips thin tasty salsa mild yummy   veggie burrito verde sauce instead ranchero sauce normally comes with   deliciously flavorful filling   sparking water tax meal came $7 54   Fantastic!  only negative noise which first consisted TV then consisted another TV showing something different louder volume then finally drowned terrible song blasted jukebox  <EOR>
