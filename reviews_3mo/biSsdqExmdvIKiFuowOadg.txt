I feel Lucky found Lucky Foo's! <EOR> This best sushi restaurant Henderson! !  tried several area always disappointed   excited try new restaurant   did disappoint   started Kale Pear Salad  Amazing presentation  flavors excellent  Brussel Sprouts  Perfectly prepare  Hot crunching sauce perfection  Then did spicy hand roll lemon roll caterpiller roll fennel roll  All flavorful delicious  return!! restaurant sectioned off more intimate dining experience   bar area plenty tv screens going everyone happy  staff very friendly knowledgeable  <EOR> Nice modern atmosphere very cool hangout   ended late regular menu but late night menu some great choices quite bit variety   We tried Korean wings spring rolls spicy miso ramen kimchee chicken fried rice   Experienced some awesome flavors but somewhat small servings   spent $35 tip left satisfied but super full   Our friends burrito roll lasagna roll enjoyed them both   Will definitely try again but looking forward checking regular menu next time! <EOR> What really stood service waitress super attentive hosted greeted smile overall everyone really nice  Refills would happen immediately  empty plates would removed lightening fast  Food good nothing memorable but didn't disappoint all  Menu somewhat innovative but lacks execution  Prices moderate place set back all  If tired overpriced overhyped underwhelming food strip defiantly visit place  Perfect way start off your night town  <EOR> Mediocrity its best    Weird spotty service  staff seems snooty already   as if they're already successful restaurant    Far it     We stood front entrance few minutes no greet before taking matters into own hands  walked over left side restaurant where saw group five people conversing  finally took notice sat us  continued conversing next five minutes until them came over serve us  Again   weird   We ordered some happy hour items wings tacos sushi rolls  Nothing pizazz  Nothing impressive   very boring blah    That's enough me  didn't want give time day won't long winded review  Just impressed    Should've gone sushi mon  <EOR> I trying new places seen pictures inside online looked very cool  When pulled sign threw off looked old casino sign does place justice  sushi ok many selections but loved LEMON ROLL **i might back alone  empty Saturday night hostess failed sit 21+ area people ambiance cool    In all back lemon roll cool bar area drinks!!! <EOR> This first time lucky foo avid foodie seeing them Instagram wanted give them try    From walking looks cool place modern seating updated fixtures chill atmosphere    We allowed seat ourselves which fine wasn't really problem  problem lack attention service received  took least 10 minutes till someone asked if drink orders yet  overall all servers seem uninterested helping  Working hospitality think just higher standard especially nice place this   When little customers only 5 6 other tables when servers should trying take extra care customers check them every 15 minutes   I think if just over manners would long way  simple please thank your welcome long way  only server actually responded thank your welcome instead k James also only server introduce himself    The food pretty good miso ramen best would recommend it! portions alittle small side   Overall think negative experience  would come back but think everyone off days but overall when work service industry regardless feel gotta suck put your customers first  Something management should really focus on    I'll trying again few months hopefully it'll better next time <EOR> This place decent ambiance decor liked music playing server well put together friendly top things  why two stars? food where place falls flat its face    We Monday night  other couple seated table few people bar  Other bunch staff mulling around nothing do  Ghost town   I starving ready hop all over menu  Warm Root Salad which wasn't bad but also wasn't warm two miso bowls which just average two sushi rolls which just plain good  roll rice very compacted dry point where almost inedible without adding soy sauce yet somehow second roll soggy mushy  lady companion Hawaii knows sushi  She said tasted rolls sat fridge all night then just topped them fresh fish which concur  mushrooms miso bowls clearly dried then rehydrated  quality ingredients just underwhelming    Also ordered Moscow Mule which didn't taste bad but also didn't taste drop alcohol it  wasn't going say anything but when server asked Mule answered honestly tastes little weak    response Oh   I'll let bartender know  But it  No offer remake comp anything  $10 weak drink kind lame    Our bill $60 still left nice tip because server nice but see no reason return here  still kind hungry when left would ordered more if food better  Maybe off night but no customers very mediocre food don't see where all great reviews coming they'll able keep doors open  <EOR> The Brussel sprouts amazing  fish fresh sushi melts your mouth  new local favorite sure! chef awesome  Came check everything was  Also infused pineapple sake delicious <EOR> I waited anxiously Lucky Foo's open better even hoped would be! hamachi crudo amazing Uni crudo completely unique unexpected tuna poke  Lucky Foo's become weekly ritual family 9yr old son loves lemon roll potato chip wrapped sausages chicken wings  Oh! Brussel sprouts! Those favorite! miso soup delicious short rib ramen ridiculously yummy! Although really drinker hand crafted unique cocktails look tempting  always settle instead best green tea ever served french press atop rustic wood platter  If you're edamame fan try theirs! Lastly service always great! seen chef greet guests occasion sushi chef always smile face  servers friendly informative can't wait until open lunch try more things add more meal times weekly ritual! Thanks opening Lucky Foo's! <EOR> So high hopes seeing pictures online continued when entered  place fun vibe it  Cool pop art all over place vivid colors   promptly greeted given menu look while waited table   menu lots cool looking fusion items excited   settled Hawaiian roll fennel role short rib ramen chicken fried rice     First thing came ramen 12 dollars 3 rd size would monta   meat least tender good cook egg broth good flavor although bit salty  did give two extra bowls since sharing which appriciated   Then fennel roll came rice sticky peices stuck together   also bland   Kinda tasted tuna salad    Hawaii roll came tasted bland California roll some mango it   rolls around 14 dollars  Way much money poorly executed rolls   Then finally fried rice way wet harmonious all   Just many things happening without any balance     Even though really didn't enjoy food nearly enough staff great   say place bring kid more adult vibe   am tempted back just try lychee panecotta but scared another lovely sounding item coming together  <EOR> First time visiting Lucky Foo's definitely back  staff very professional attentive!!

LUCKY FOO'S MOOOOOOOOOORE???  Dinner drinks split dessert since still hungry! cam $60 two people  Gak  Overall Lucky Foo's something good but stand better  2 5 stars would liked give but gets third star excellent service  least point  <EOR> A couple weeks ago stopped Lucky Foos sat bar drink wife both thought vibe really really cool don't believe me?

Coming back soon sushi looks fresh delicious  <EOR> Okay first off let's talk cultural confusion  Lucky Foos? Sounds Chinese me   But overall definitely Japanese  know place serves variety Asian foods but sushi prominent menu Japanese  main reason didn't initially here  But eventually went  Cute place nice decor  Waitress tells Izakaya which am more familiar japanese   also tell pour own sake which   also knew but whatever  cultural lesson right?   First thing came yakitori  Flavor good but edible  Next dumplings which actually luke warm gyoza  crispy rice lemon roll both really awesome  Then ebiyaki which also really good  only inedible part meal chicken wings  two gigantic bird wings break apart your hands dip sauce felt barbaric couldn't finish it    Overall place lot potential but needs refine small menu have  much better Izakayas chinatown  baseline place isn't snuff <EOR> Went quick afternoon lunch order tiger roll really enjoyed enjoyed much forgot take picture   Then ordered mountain miso soup would say probably won't cross mind order again! Overall experience good probably back try few new things  <EOR> BAD DINING EXPERIENCE  Thought atmosphere fine lots tv's but similar prior restaurant there  Ordered following 2 Yellowtail 1 Big Eye Tuna 1 Albacore nigiri's Good Crispy Rice Tuna Good Beet Salad Good Charred Edamame Soggy overcooked Chicken Lettuce Wraps Lettuce wilted crispy chicken many mushrooms mushy Salmon Delicious tender Hot Green Tea Piping hot served nice pitcher  Moscow Mule Good  James waiter spilled Moscow Mule table lap  He tried tell another worker most drink but case since jeans under chair soaking wet   They tried serve Yellowtail Albacore Crispy Rice Tuna twice which rejected reminded them already received orders   An owner Mike asked dining experience which relayed above information him   When received bill surprised did try compensate reducing bill at least spilled drink   Also realized charged twice crispy rice tuna   HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE never back never recommend place any friends family! <EOR> This place Wayyy better old sushi place before  food Aweosme very creative fusion tapas type serving oh good  I  Super stuffed ordered happy hour menu which extend because foozeball game  nicely done mr owner appreciate good sir!
