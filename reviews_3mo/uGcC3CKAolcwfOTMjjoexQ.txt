I can't personally eat often because feel gross afterwards trying eat vegetarian   wish veggie option tho could choice instead being forced eat meat   LOL  Whatever good   If around neighborhood try it   price reasonable   strip burger $5 99 <EOR> I meeting area hadn't eaten all day taste new joint   huge disappointment being told best burgers ever   Everything utterly salty cooked bad eating McDonalds would much better eating here     Where start?  Fries type fries might sitting day before   all petrified extremely salty   kind fries where every single tasted bad potato chip   supposed sea salt them which would made saltiness little bearable but no trace sea salt these     Haystack Onion strings seasoned badly throw them out   funky taste made think seasoned ground chicken bullion cubes   kid not   just over top inedible   The burger probably better sides but all burger huge mass gray meat   no char whatsoever if microwaved something   took few bites didn't finish either   only thing liked burger wheat bun but doughy starchy way much bread meat   There very few burger joints area worse place all them you'll know ate better eating Smash Burger  <EOR> Greasy understatement     I know smash angus beef griddle seal flavor but much better!  Sin City burger haystack onions fried egg applewood bacon   Nice concept presentation yes    very filling!  But freshness seasoning large patty blindsided greasiness  SmashFries better! <EOR> I given bad bad review another site decided give another try   wasn't wrong   burgers greasy disgusting   say meat seasoned but bland flavorless   fries really greasy well   Twice more enough me    Really once but trying fair regretted it   Create burger place few blocks east good don't see place chance  <EOR> Like others said burgers really greasy   leave greasy film all over place   smash fries mediocre bes fired pickles decent   asked numerous times when ordering wanted CRISPY bacon   course bacon anything but crispy   grilled onions greasy well   Create Burger better but equivalent money prefer Red Robin   If haven't tried them yet then Tommy's In n Out  <EOR> Greasy burgers dried chicken anyone? Don't wrong nice greasy burger every now then but place just overdone  reminded going friends house bought cheap beef loaded fat made oversized hamburger just dripping grease    The second time chicken burger dry dry dry no juice bird  haven't shop myself only given food but they're going harder time competing other burger shops all down lake mead blvd  <EOR> I wouldn't normally restaurant hamburgers but place some very delicious ones    From reading beverage cup learned Smashburger actually smashes Angus beef burgers onto grill hence name  burgers good  If ever Fatburger think quality similar  If Crabby Patty manifested into real life burger   it may possibly taste smashburger   I American smashburger BF Sin City smashburger  burger quite tasty   the fried egg made difference! love serve burgers egg buns too   The smashfries best fries ever had  crispy flavorful  never fries anywhere else! Yum   PROS Refillable drinks Coupons available if know where look Seat yourself Server brings food your table  I am definitely coming back try other menu items smashchicken  <EOR> The others reviews seem spot on  Food greasy but yummy  choose weird burger options but think more basic hamburger would better first visit mine busy but did enjoyed egg bun   think there's 2 type fries smash fries oily salty ill try regular next time  I Sin City burger fried egg haha  Smash fries pretty good but still nothing spectacular  End result food good but seems you're paying gimmick Just another fudruckers johnny rockets fatburger etc  All little different but expensive just burger! No combo meal just dollar off when getting fries burger everything priced separately   They also Haagen Daas desserts which girlfriend enjoyed something important though  did selection sodas coke zero ftw  Staff all over personality wise some employees quiet standoffish counter girl most friendly  manager used work Gordon Biersch think   Seems business new decor could lot better eating area pretty large but plain  definitely back see if evolves plain fries burger cheeseburger etc  just hard choice many other options create across street heh <EOR> Yay!!! 1st 5 star rating   I going give 4 stars but am denial? really really place  loved Utah love Vegas   As said before am  hamburger type girl but burgers just I know room    Seriously though think everything tasty key word TASTY!!! wasn't should say hasn't anything tried did like  love love love flash fried veggies far Barbecue burger favorite and most fattening sure But know when mood burger better lick your fingers greasy   If your diet should eat here? Maybe but if diet should maybe stay away cheeseburgers while anyway right?  Well thing asked if veggies could all carrots LOVE CARROTS but cashier said due inventory wasn't possible   I took man proceeded order!!! <EOR> SmashBurger decent burger would call maybe step Fatburger  use Angus beef fancier set ingredients well nicer dining area  ordered 1 2lbs Sin City burger Smash Fries total almost $10 without drink  burger juicy but some said slightly greasy probably because egg bacon too  fries OK but shoestring type which tend dry rosemary seasoning totally overwhelmed other flavors  might back try other things but Fuddruckers In N Out little better  <EOR>
