I heard 99 cent shrimp cocktails place long time now but never gone try it  Well time made point give try  Hubby both while lil guy fixated foot long hot dog spam musubi   The foot long hot dog great deal  $2 50 dog plus drink  spam musubi also pretty tasty although nori chewy because lady warmed but flavor good   The shrimp cocktail way much sauce it  shrimp overpowered sauce couldn't even taste shrimp  some chopped lettuce onions celery bottom give flavor but again much sauce  If plan ask woman add more sauce already sauced cocktail  Otherwise your shrimps drowning crying help  other thing shrimps damn small barely taste them  Costco shrimp cocktail $10 eat your heart's content!  This place also serves saimin oxtail soup those craving Hawaiian fare  Otherwise Chinese fast food place  wouldn't eat Chinese  only okay just grab snack  Don't plan having meal you'll disappointed  <EOR>
