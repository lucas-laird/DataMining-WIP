I wish lived Vegas could come much wanted   Joey's serves best pizza Vegas aren't overpriced boot! If just know anything pizza menu solid   Joey's excellent crust standard tomato alfredo sauces   prefer Double Bacon Hamburger pizza myself but try everything hopefully when head back Vegas   Also best appertizers called garlic balls   small bits dough covered garlic butter   am sure if fried baked but good   Beyond good excellent! <EOR>
