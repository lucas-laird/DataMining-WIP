I never really fan Burger King  used Original Chicken Sandwich but now just does taste good used to  only reason why come because husband likes Double Croissan'wich Hash Browns breakfast menu   This Burger King located Rainbow Dunes Centre very hard spot since only business left area  Looks used buffet hair salon shoe store more all sadly closed down due bad economy   I never inside but drive thru service always pretty good  employees pretty nice messed any orders yet  thing nice always seem fresh batch hash browns when order them  wait while but still hot home!  It's bad only 2 items menu  <EOR>
