The Cafe Harrah's really shouldn't busy is   Located next Ming's Table long line easily misleading   The 24 hour cafe serves your standard fare   special breakfast menu 6 am 11 am then all day menu   Posters advertising lunch specials $7 77 brought yesterday morning  And sure brought many others well  When finally seated breakfast menu brought asked lunch specials   only three options choose looked far special  I wish waiter offered all day menu peruse well  steak special started 2 pm waiter quick tell he didn't recommend it  We appreciated honesty least! I ended Corned Beef Hash breakfast $10 99    comes two eggs your way hash browns choice toast bagel English muffin   Yes corned beef hash salty basic   bit disappointed   My aunt ordered Bone In Ham Eggs Breakfast $14 99 hearty chunk ham   She leftovers   My other aunt  ordered Lox Bagel $10 99 accompanied herb spread capers hard boiled egg red onions tomato slices     The breakfasts took little while arrive which surprising when neighbors food way before did   water glasses rarely refilled actually helped ourselves makeshift water OJ station right next table    We didn't appreciate extra $1 99 charge salsa appeared bill  Uh don't usually tell when things cost extra? Overall expensive worth price   mistake planning breakfast brunch place ahead time because would paid more better food better experience   price might well lunch breakfast buffets instead! <EOR> Went late night munchies drinking much losing all money  Ordered appetizer sampler hamburger breakfast plates  All great bill only $35  bad joint think  <EOR> I ate because starving 1am  There no other easy places eat      So 10 95 steak shrimp special    heh    even laughed when ordered it   Wow terrible   But own fault HA! Menu pretty boring service bad obviously 10$ steak poor   ha   Yeah next time just walk half block Dennys instead  <EOR>
