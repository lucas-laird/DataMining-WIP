Chipotle generally good all time  rare occasions which ingredients just old aren't made properly but never case location  Most time very consistent   If never Chipotle somewhat different other restaurants  customer through ingredient buffet which pick ingredients would want burrito bowl  Other additions include drinks small tortillas salsa  location lets refill your own drinks   I always chicken carnitas bowl  two kinds meat but extra  steak because well done  can't comment beans because am bean fan don't fart? but boyfriend seems them gets them every time  don't charge extra rice beans lettuce  seen people burritos big wrap them two large tortillas!  I can't finish bowl setting but think tasty leftovers  really food and all other Chipotles   simple consistent delish! <EOR> Good food good prices really nice staff  They iPhone app! <EOR> Keeping high standards rest chain healthy prompt quick tex mex style food  <EOR>
