Friendly staff remarkable pizza!!! great prices food delicious  Groupon coupon ended buying more food because all tasted awesome  Pizza crust itself enough there  children loved buffalo wings Garlic con Queso wings  first time but definitely regular customer now on  <EOR> Pizza crust average  Toppings few  ordered groupon special 2 pizzas 3 toppings each  Shop purposely cut back toppings whatever reasons  silly because if pizza bad least toppings save it  Learned lesson  Don't waste your time here  <EOR>
