I gave restaurant two stars since friend loves it   However meal terrible   thought going amazing barbeque I'm Texas eaten original Salt Lick but bad   hate say bad things place since staff nice but everything ate seemed undercooked    My serving chicken bleeding when sliced it   asked waitress if could another cooked piece she said okay but explained supposed way when smoked   She brought another piece bloody inside well   tried take bite good sport but just couldn't eat larval chicken   ended getting upset stomach next two days but might've just coincidence  I took bite friend's ribs those seemed undercooked well  or maybe appetite just ruined then    The Red Rock casino really lovely though   definitely back wander around uniquely unoffensive casino soon   canopy beds around pool interesting! <EOR>
