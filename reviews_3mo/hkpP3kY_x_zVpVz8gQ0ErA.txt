[or maybe filled fries? idk]    definitely coming back spot! must try torta [my boss ordered today looked reeeeeeeeally good!!!] gotta try wings another special wanted try but wasnt sure its called <EOR> I may minority but those experience where wish could refund first few bite   My sis tried pretty much all tacos minus tofu Chicken Beef regular Korean   *YAwwnn*  couldn't tell difference between related protein!  4 different type lettuce really?  If they're trying taco more dull then hollArrr!!! eventually just set aside all greens just key meats more oomph we're expecting   Sadly did amused all even 2 accompany sauces red hot sauce black sweet soy   add insult nice 2 1 speakers set order window party mode   yay   Their Bulgolgi CK Wings likable but wouldn't order again if neighborhood    Service nice   made sure kept warm portable heaters while ate outdoor patio   even lend sister seat cushion she didn't sit cold chair   We didn't finish meal left eat another spot   Tip Umm    No  <EOR> A Korean Taco Stand!?  Sounds cool try it!  love little places excited give try   But hate say it    pretty disappointed   tacos themselves pretty good but put much 'filler' them look you're getting lots food    really annoyed me   They brag 3 different kids lettuce but really people    excited eating lettuce??  don't!!  meat hidden under mounds lettuce pretty yummy but don't feel should search it   I felt same 'sweet potato fries  very clever cut them suuuuuuper thin when put giant handfull them your plate looks massive mound food   But reality there's nothing substantial all   There some kind yummy dark brown sauce came tacos super delicious   If given tortillas actually FILLED meat some sauce LITTLE bit lettuce    would happy girl   But instead left feeling pretty jipped   disappointing  <EOR> This place doesn't seem exciting small unassuming little place tucked parking lot next Roy's Flamingo but its some exciting flavors going on    Not big menu really only four things listed choice meat expand 12 but some extra items shown picture choices day guess more meets eye    I chose burrito teri beef came tiny little sweet potato fries  felt needed little bigger just very light hint flavor them being tiny  two sauces fries burrito spicy kim chi sauce thought  same Korean flavor    I surprised tasty definitely different kept short list future follow ups  <EOR> So trying find something similar Kogi Trucks Cali because 4 hour drive eat something crave daily getting hassle   read korean taco stand yelp gave shot   Let's just say taste nowhere near LA Style tacos     I ordered 2 tacos Spicy Chicken seemed more sweet rather spicy   hot sauce gave burnt taste buds   mean love spicy but overkill  Korean Beef BBQ hella sweet! nothing balanced anything just sweet   tacos topped way much lettuce felt eating salad     The only good thing order sweet potato fries   thin crispy made liking   Maybe just wrong day maybe didn't order right style?  All know everything way sweet spicy nothing balance out   Maybe I'd give another shot try Torta something   All know tacos no longer list ordering  <EOR> When want something little different usual food UNLV area 9091  tortas nothing short awesome   I've tried tacos wings  only alright   nothing back for  buddy mine said some killer burgers may just try when see special up   usually tortas  chicken tortas great especially pouring special black soy based sauce juicy meaty very filling  remember going into flavor shock first bite  just kept going back more   I'm sure feel sweet potato fries though  They're kinda tasty but also thin pointy almost annoying eat  <EOR> This definitely favorite fusion taco stand places town  right down street work literally spent 5 days eating lunch figured if call your order pick MUCH less waiting your food which assume takes while because made fresh    I think 2 favorite things burritos wings  wings special don't think he serves everyday but seems serve pretty often  They're crispy spicy sweet sticky even contemplate eating part napkin stuck because good  burritos really good them because they're different  He adds some slices think cotija cheese inside opposed whatever shredded cheese used higher end to go burrito places ie Zaba's Chipotle Cafe Rio etc  well avocado slices tomoato  rice super tasty haven't able figure quite what's addicting but sticky white rice rather toasted mexican rice used other places  However think thing am least impressed meat  don't know if just because think meat to other ingredients ratio off expectations flavor but honestly can't tell when spicy even difference between regular meats Korean BBQ    Nonetheless hasn't detracted love food although wish they'd expand menu bit more  evidenced wings super fresh ingredients think could far more dishes if capacity    The only other gripe asked tortilla chips few times guy kept saying Yeah sure! because advertised menus but day never gotten them  Maybe think sweet potato sticks better but some days ya just need chip  <EOR> Visited first time work chilly December evening  Really good Korean style spicy beef taco  Also tried special wings  sauce drizzle over wings spicy beef wanna bite your fingers  Also liked super skinny sweet potato fries   I folded them into taco extra crunch   Food prepared fresh prepare wait little bit  <EOR> I've 9091 twice week  should say all  good  Those potato strings addicting even if poke inside your cheeks while you're eating them  chicken torta  absolutely delish chicken being seasoned perfectly  also tried beef burrito which  very good   spicy sauce variation bimbimbap sauce but different  poured everything  chicken wings some good flavors too  glass noodles bit plain but little mixture soy sauce blend spicy sauce all go  <EOR> awesome change pace area  everything delicious   and least once week  favorites bipop burrito all meats put good cheeseburger it's bit messy but awesome   and huge    really dig soy sauce   think might some vinegar sexy up  sweet potato shoestring fries also nice  people rock    always friendly  <EOR> Yay Im fan     I'm unsure part establishment Korean   but am still working that  know meant fusion     When asked guy behind counter explanation flavors sauces he mentioned  no specific components only used words 'spicier' 'sweeter' reference flavors like  vague but decided give try anyway    I am pleased say everything fresh tasted great filling  Definitely someplace would look burrito now then  look forward trying other items  limited menu but given all choices food   think perfect thing  am still confused seasonings were   as both burritos tried accompanied chili sauce some sort sweet soy sauce   both good   both needed sauces liven burritos bit   It did take near 20 minutes 2 burritos made which due freshness them suppose   but if lunch break might bit wary going there  only guy line well   time   3 5 people sitting under heater front having food all seemed enjoy well    As said all very fresh tasty own which why am fan look forward more   but without any specific flavors pinpoint its just another good taco burrito stand fused something different   though different  More come! <EOR> This taco stand close work wanting try quite some time  Finally made over yesterday   I ordered spicy chicken taco Korean BBQ beef taco  Both quite good  much better Hanshik Taco  <EOR> My boyfriend dissappointed Wynn long line $40 buffet tasteless $40 dinner Pinot Venetian but finally sastisfied $7 Torta Korean Taco Shop!
