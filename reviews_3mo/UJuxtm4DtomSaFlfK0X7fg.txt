I stumbled upon solely due fact shopping Neiman Marcus didn't want fast food food court  asked SA recommendation close fast food decent she recommended it  bit skeptical because hey she does all work NM! pleasantly suprised    The menu mostly American some Asian fusion mixed in  can't believe Im saying but most awesome fries EVER  ignore sweets anything but fries other hand chocolate  fantastic  guess seasoning but way freaking yummy!   They great salads burgers sandwiches well extensive bar  Great little place if you're shopping area lazy did  very pleasantly suprised place  <EOR> 4 5 stars The menu pleasant food big size taste   service minimal   tables crumbs them   But mall definitely alternative  <EOR>
