Okay marinated chicken gonna it   marinade shined through absent smoke ring again where smoke   smoker must broken   Nothing made even want give place another shot  <EOR> We excited when finally opened Geisha House next door quite frequently   Live very close  always looking food options   Well    the excitement deflated moment stepped location   ordered 65 00 order take out  family town Ohio hoping best option all us    did online 3 pm   Requested pick 6pm   arrived 5 50 pm   Stood register literally 5 minutes before even greeted   hello welcome ?  Manager saw seemed surprised greeted   young gentleman working very apologetic qutie pleasant   Wish could say same Manager   Told pick order   leaving several minutes he returned say chicken which ordered   chicken?  Well   come find he informed large party came earlier whiped out    Wow   said basically gave away order?  He offered another meat choice   But course would expected   Seeing no choice opted turkey which underwhelming least    He also threw another meat choice   would much rather chicken ordered 3  hours previous but he offered   Actually would much rather received discount off meal very least gift certificate try return   Well happening sorry say    am customer service many years experience rate worst   imagine going pick your pizza say sorry gave your pizza someone else but you! say first time ever experienced lives   Just laugh point   Food ok   great terrible   Hope together fail miserably  <EOR> So come probably 7 8 times since opened  food actually pretty good  service whatever portions well    yeah    that     For food itself no major issues  food consistency tasty sauce pretty good addition sides I usually fries onion tanglers delicious addition menu   no qualms quality food   The service probably par fast food  know there's orders top greet everyone etc dedicated signs where but location just doesn't really welcome well physical design  come wall which obfuscates vision puts lot standing room doesn't really facilitate customer service  All places previously Shanes Hog's Heaven etc All cash registers right walked better service model  building planned other door That leads patio nobody EVER uses only reached foot just doesn't facilitate anything well  best bet would try expand store since building very narrow hard move around in    My last issue restaurant portions  inconsistent never know order   tend 3 meat platter since am 1 meal day person yet sometimes ordered smaller meat plates gotten same amount food  ordered 3 times last week alone day gotten plastic container full fries few small slices chicken gotten plastic container full chicken just paper container 10 fries 1 meat plates somewhere middle   I feel should just order smaller portion hope fate decides give enough would consider enough food but tend order 3 meat given difference only $1 50  wish could standardize could standardize order   My only Nit picks wish place different deals  free Ice Cream kids eat free Sunday Dine In  also free drink signing email club  honestly wish deals lower cost food order 1 $10 14 Again depending portion size gamble 2 orders Canes price    Dickey's being chain some grounding Vegas probably fares better two places picking first location but some issues needs address before cement itself into landscape area  3rd 4th restaurant gone location it'd shame see 5th someday    EDIT gone few more times figured better way order meal I found there's option order half pound which WAY more consistent if you're getting same meat  staff super friendly well feel they've ironed few kinks  <EOR>
