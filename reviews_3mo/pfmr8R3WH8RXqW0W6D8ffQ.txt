AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL  Here some things issues ordered 2 eggs any style dish but REFUSED boiled eggs  I ordered eggs over hard but UNDERCOOKED them When asked them cook little more BURNED them  The sausage tasteless  No free refills iced coffee when coffee unlimited  ONLY DIFFERENCE ONCE ICE!  Nice decor but sketchy bathrooms  must've spent time money decorating food   If could give place zero stars would  <EOR> Pros Service very attentive waiter knowledgeable made good suggestions friendly talkative without being overbearing   issue chicken see below taken off bill immediately without second thought  Atmosphere Sure fake sky little cheesy but fun outdoor seating area cute even people passing wasn't loud  Roasted Tomato Soup Oh god   delicious!! sure if standard because soup day but possibly offer often?  HIGHLY recommend getting it  Price would expect much higher   $10 $15 pasta dishes also offered more expensive surft turf filet mignon etc higher price but definitely affordable non chain I think option when Vegas  Dipping oil bread Oh wow   I can't remember exactly but think olive oil balsalmic vinegar parmesean cheese chili pepper flakes pepper something else mixed together dip bread in   it definitely best standard olive oil vinegar type mix ever restaurant    Con Chicken friend each chicken pasta she added didn't come dish originally both thought tasted cleaning supplies   server talked chef suggested maybe rosemary maridnade used   sure because rosemary   suprisingly even though chicken disgusting am still giving Lombardi's 4 stars because chicken taken off bill waiter super nice service other food atmosphere made it  <EOR>
