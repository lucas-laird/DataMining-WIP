First waited over 1 hour them deliver pizza but tipped them anyway since hot day  Then bit into pepperoncini included found to horror looked dead caterpillar maggot inside! and yes took lot pictures anyone would identify type bug truly is quickly called them tell them rid whole batch other customers wouldn't experience same problem   apologized offered free pizza but highly doubt would ever return even consider offer  <EOR>
