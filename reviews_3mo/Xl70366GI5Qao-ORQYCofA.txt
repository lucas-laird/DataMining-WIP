Well craving Korean wanted try somewhere closer house  guess experience bad    but hey someone try right? Kevin says filled tummies must agree 100%   food eh     okay   guess because hungry!  definitely waaaaay better Korean food  Stay tuned next review it      The outside actually looked pretty good   Yes quite opposite other restaurants Hmmm   interesting       Tuesday 430pm wasn't crowded all   just other person sitting lady 'somewhat' greeted looked she owners  say 'somewhat' because she distracted Korean shows blaring TV situated middle restaurant She front TV every chance she got   We played safe ordered bulgogi chicken   dishes $14 95 each only cooking menu open time didn't much choice   soups other appetizers but opt any   really wanted try seafood pancake but $16 95 pretty steep    lunch special prices looked okay ranging $8 00 9 00 but ended 230pm    When dishes came cast iron sizzling plates didn't quite excite us  came sizzling just onions! meat soft but definitely needed more flavor   Same chicken mind used chicken breast  used thighs  Now let's talk sides given   gave 6 side dishes   huge bowl salad which consisted just greens dressing simple rice vinegar soy sauce bit spice   other sides usual kimchee stuff but didn't give much   actually ask more   last thing husband being food industry business would always tip 20% regardless   But tell big statement when he only tipped 15% place!!!  Alright enough place  sorry say first last time would going here   anyone better experience  We're happy you! <EOR>
