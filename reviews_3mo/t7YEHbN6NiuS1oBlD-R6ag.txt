I really surprised when pool Excalibur much nicer expected  When first entered hotel slightly worse then excepted  wouldn't say where beautiful people come hang more tired parents tourists dint know any better  pool totally different  4 pool areas connected another farthest being adults only pool music playing  thought would splashed kicked annoyed little kids all day but wasn't all  Excalibur sure made kiddies but lot centered around pool area other three mostly adults  lay enjoy sun peace  way don't hate kids  <EOR> This area only saving grace Excalibur  4 pools along water slide adults only area  waitresses cruising around attending patrons noise level just right   My recommendation stay pool maybe they'll rent chair night  <EOR> The pool surprisingly great nice rock waterfalls water slides good music  nice choice several pools although all shallow guess Vegas thing since pools wading looking hot actually swimming  chairs fill fast early before 11am good spot  bar did all drinks menu but bartender made good frozen strawberry daiquiri  <EOR>
