My wife debated getting separate meals because $15 per entree cost just try someplace new  glad ended just sharing because splitting Garlic Nan Chicken Tikki Masala just enough satisfy both lunch  bread MUST especially soup  final bill just over $19 but absolutely no complaints  Very happy decided give shot  Unfortunately carry only you're still stuck doing your own dishes  <EOR> Ate 2 days row!  Great food cooked order second location basically type place  If your looking sit down nice environment check downtown location  recommend chicken tiki marsala tandoori chicken yummm  <EOR> This location more built type restaurant  food worth money!! chicken tikka masala tasted good  haven't good Indian food awhile  Definitely come back again  <EOR> Maybe just me    But thought little pricey amount chicken tikka masala plus small side rice   ordered no spice since also feeding toddler  really sweet  wasn't fond it  try usual spicy next time real taste  honest better tastier non spicy tikka masala elsewhere  still come back try other dishes   Since express take out expecting food made laid ready staff scoop into entree box    But not   The place really hot  No AC  Maybe they're still working it? felt better standing outside  Small place many choices menu  cashier waiter cook nice  Doors didn't open time hour  call giving them few mins  could improve presentation place blocking very open view leading back  But good see cook washing hands handling money <EOR> Getting food took quite bit longer said would extremely hot waiting inside    The food really delicious but very pricey  chicken tikka masala container full sauce few small chunks chicken small container rice  I'd expected pay under $10 amount  Maybe lunch specials where at! <EOR>
