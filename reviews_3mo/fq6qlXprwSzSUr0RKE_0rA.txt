I walking around Strip hungry tired  didn't feel dealing crowds cavernous casinos search cheap eats   Mexican came mind would settled chain restaurant La Salsa but just couldn't look anymore  headed over Fashion Show Mall food court choice restaurants weren't great but decided try Taco Maker   I little bit skeptical give try but hungry   I veggie version special which consisted nachos melted cheese burrito enchilada sauce top taco   The food eh did job filling but left realizing eating burritos outside San Francisco be    disappointing  <EOR>
