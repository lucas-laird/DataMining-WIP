So place sits facing Pussycat Dolls blackjack tables hence loud all hell  loud comes tables small restaurant completely open no walls separate passersby walkway  seated immediately but acknowledged good 15 minutes so  Drink orders taken well food orders all starving then  Food didn't come another 40 forty?!?! minutes here's plain cheeseburger cut half requested split between two children  cheeseburger didn't show up  Oh thought wanted split between THREE you  Um adult splitting burger between herself two kids? Never heard it  burger raw middle  red mush raw  order perfect every way breakfast burrito which came eggs french fries sausage gravy wrapped warm tortilla side more french fries  yeah service leaves much desired dont know clean kitchen but cooks certainly aren't attentive raw meat handling either  fairly new spot I hear opened March 2010 maybe still need work kinks  Salmonella kinks  <EOR> Nothing special place all especially since most entress $15 range  Combine $3 soda you're talking $20+ lunch  Just worth price unless maybe if you're drunk coming Pure  <EOR> A nice place grab bite if you're staying Cesar's nothing worth traveling but much better food court much more money   The restaurant empty but service still slow   I highly recommend cucumber gimlet its sweet strong   Also sweet potato fries great burger solid   The lobster rolls just bits lobster 3 tiny hot dogs I'd opt something else   Portions appetizers somewhat small price   From look place thinks its super hip but really its more your every day American food  <EOR> After shopping forum shops all day wanted meet boyfriend between poker game quick bite   We passes MunchBar took look menu sat down  waitress very friendly telling thirsty she water table matter moments   I wanted order pizza bites but she told out  Which wonder if come bag thrown microwave? mini grilled cheeses tomato dipping sauce boyfriend blue cheese burger   I little let down grilled cheeses although tasty all regular sized sandwich cut into wedges if 5 year old  boyfriends burger delicious but big almost big  Borderline practical joke big  french fries little metal pail quite yummy   Overall if looking amazing culinary experience skip MunchBar but if looking quick tasty bite then recommend it  <EOR> It great lunch watch FIFA games same time  Energy crowd great! Food pretty good  Great drinks!   Service little slow but considering only waitress area understandable    I usually don't burgers but jalapeno burger incredible  fries probably best ever had  even good when cold  cucumber drink can't recall name but perfect hot weather  Gonna back drink sure! <EOR> This place joke!  We stayed Caesar Palace 1st time while waiting room ready stopped bite eat  Well bite eat took 1 5 hours though only 4 5 tables occupied 1 3 place   We ordered turkey burger regular medium done burger  3 tables sat all 3 food before us them sent burger back new while still waiting anything all eat  When asked waitress said sorry but fault cooks' fault  Well helps know! Our order came 25 minutes later  medium burger over well done dry! When came bill manager comped free beer  Dear Munchbar all free beer want stepping outside your stupid cafe gambling casino  don't need free beer need food time made way ordered! positive note though turkey burger amazing! which only reason 2 stars me  topped stuffing!!! french onions bottom thanksgiving dinner sandwich!  If don't mind horrible service should try turkey burger  think I'd rather spend money different food joint next time    <EOR> Good place grab drink some quick bite  Much better fast food just fine dining like would expect name    Very good fish tacos  Good chicken tenders    Cook time unusually slow  <EOR>
