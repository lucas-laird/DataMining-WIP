As long sit down eat understanding concept you'll love place! no entrees courses  Everything tapas style totally shareable  great way try little bit everything without breaking bank too! chili dogs BEST anywhere including Tony Packo's Toledo OH   Definitely group friends let everyone pick some different things try out  Also don't forget dessert!  The atmosphere also really different  While look restaurant might suggest upscale feel definitely comfortable down earth  Despite rather full house still carry conversation your table without having shout!   The beer selection okay but could widened bit  food filling despite small portions! <EOR> Johnny Smalls FANTASTIC!  really good idea done flair flat out great food   No question would again heartily recommend it   The decor cool trendy but over top   server very friendly knowledgeable   help ordered five dishes honestly say every delicious   Don't miss mini chili dog sliders filet lobster skewers!

This place friendly convenient neighbor Vanity Club Hard rock  arrived around 9 pm Sunday surprise crowded all  But apparently busy weekend according friendly waitress because if few items  least she courtesy tell before ordering  Even few missing items still plenty choose choices such sliders salads tacos kabobs fried deliciousness all served tapas style!

Inventive food great atmosphere reasonable prices! <EOR> Very disappointed   Menu sounds great interesting enticing   But missed many points between sounded like  delivered   Ordered 8 things   Best calamari but portion size very small especially considering dish normally 9 95 12 95 around town those places serve 2 3 times portion size   The pretzel beer dip much better brought fresh pretzels   Liked that   Beef lobster skewers minimal pathetic tastes both salty very pricey   Most food very salty  Pizza pretty good but star meal lettuce cups   Enjoy those   drinks mojito ok special fill glass crushed ice trick serve slight portions all familiar with   See no reason back Pink Taco luckys next time there  <EOR>
