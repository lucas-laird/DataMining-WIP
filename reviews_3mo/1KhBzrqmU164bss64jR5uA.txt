Ok maybe shouldnt qualify but hay making rain does hungry hoppin over RS should no brainer    Sorry stray off main subject guy tend easily distracted strip clubs tend them  Unlike original location new place does serve beef ribs moment  beef ribs mainly number reason RS because havnt anything them anywhere  limited menu  prices seem marked well but should expected since technically strip still    What ended getting 2 meat combo $19 99 which comes side drink  Your meat choices pulled pork beef hot links chopped brisket smoked chicken st louis ribs  Your side choices bbq baked beans cole slaw mashed potatos mac n cheese  chose chopped brisket st louis ribs  usual both meats point  brisket little bit greasy time around but still good  ribs tender fall off bone smoke flavored goodness!

Thanks appreciating locals!  back! <EOR> Place extremely expensive some bbq  lunch break quick meal  You'll spend around $12 $14 sandwich itself  Want soda? That'll $5 more! give away souvenir cup but theres no way opt pay normal price drink  Then top side also additional fee  Basically you'll spend $20 $25 simple lunch just yourself   On plus side though Free parking a rarity area food definitely delicious  Could afford regular lunch spot however  Potato salad awesome! <EOR> Stopped way Freemont Experience say place fire  Good music friendly bartenders good BBQ  Sliders every bit them tasty well done  Maybe just moment but people all having good time even Rick Harrison bartending  place far least expensive place came across all week  should your list places visit part old style Vegas without Disney themes!! <EOR> We came lunch time food doesn't worth money expensive locals maybe trick tourist but no locals no coming again!  Service location no bad <EOR> Awesome BBQ! Check bar upstairs sure  may even see Rick bartending! great food drink specials everyday  place bbq Vegas! <EOR> Nothing disappointment dinner!  Surprised see all 5 star reviews   Hmm?!?  I talked into getting special 2 meats 1 slice white bread 1 side souvenir cup drink $20 discount if you're local   I shocked see meat given literally 4 pieces thinly sliced hot links 3 pieces thinly sliced beef brisket smaller normal size side small souvenir soda cup which nothing but cheapy thin plastic cup    Waaay OVER priced quantity food top off quality subpar lacking    The bbq sauce runny bland  brisket dry flavorless  hot links nothing but hot   that literally all taste overpowering heat!   Definitely touristy spot trap    Only good thing say place meat carver servers where really nice  <EOR> Came chilly Sunday night November looking nothing more check new container park like shopping eating plaza popped next Gold Silver Pawn Shop   Started poutine place downstairs but wasn't interested sitting outside wanted bar gravy smothered fries  Turns place totally cooperative guy poutine place told fine take food upstairs BBQ place bar    place totally dead way plagues any outdoor mall cold Vegas night  only bar patrons aside security guy pawn shop  afforded private pretty much bartender super chatty personable told locals 20% off hello!   He very helpful suggestions food beer    Things consider BBQ good appreciate fact wasn't smothered sauce rare times where brisket outdid rib tips flavor  Awesome brisket great job guys usually brisket falls short when compared rib tips because fat delicious  only time BBQ spot where brisket delicate flavorful this  said rib tips reminded pot roast  truly think because meat wasn't very fatty quality just bit off used rib tips    Beer almost impossible find bar good selection hef tap isn't fruit vanilla flavored  love God hef lovers just want plain delicious full bodied hef doesn't taste syrup    Lastly wasn't whole lot food $20  Don't come expecting fill then some   good pretty cool just isn't best value  <EOR> This place amazing! pulled pork must try sauces best land  Located right next pawn stars  <EOR> Vegetarian before walked in     Burnt brisket ends took back! couldn't say no! Delicious savory Bbq!! <EOR> Good ribs brisket  Sauce could spicier but sweet  Sweet also offered those don't  know any better   Potato salad different but tasty  Sides plentiful but priced notch up  think prices include tax  Nice discount locals  back much regret scales  <EOR> Just shitty bootleg version Rolling Smoke    with 30% surcharge being next dismal pawn shop having Rick's fleshy mug posted walls   mistake think might more    <EOR> Wow!
