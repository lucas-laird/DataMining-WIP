So visited another Wildfire Casino N  Rancho Drive which meant another WildBurger location try out   visit two locations now both appeared share similar interior design implementation   casual local casino diner serving burgers hotdogs wings breakfast items but looks pretty new clean   Last time WildBurger tried WildBurger thought try other signature burgers location   meant ordering Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich Cajun Turkey Burger   Both good but clear winner definitely Cajun Turkey Burger tasted better heavy    The Fried Onion String also lot better tried before killed all time around instead leaving most plate   The Honey Garlic Boneless Wings great flavor spicy all for medium but made cut chicken breast pieces   Even though fried perfectly moist inside think stick real chicken wings next time   4 stars good food reasonable price friendly service clean casino diner does overly reek cigarette smoke   Plus no line wait seated place order visit   Oh yeah another month expand menu all locations   interesting see else cook new menu  <EOR> The girl took order all doing little humanly possible but aside everything good   My husband split classic cheeseburger  little biased   they use Tillamook cheese which love    The star show though Die Desserts   ice cream shakes deep fried Twinkies house made Ding Dongs  split Ding Dong fabulous  both said afterwards we'd back just that!! Shakes $3 other 2 $5 ea  Well worth price!!! <EOR> Second time here   $10 $20 coupon thanks using Player's card  score! 2 your own burgers side fries water   1 2 lb Angus burger choose which cheese American swiss cheddar pepperjack etc toppings $1 extra include bacon fried egg coleslaw etc bread brioche all way want   burgers come fries onion strings    DO ONION STRINGS   GOOD  Honestly fries aren't good but when you're paying 50% your meal fries do     The burgers other hand delicious   Tackling first bite tough because burger 4 inches tall   also bottled beer sale    I keep coming long coupons mail   Other Wild Burger good enough way eat here   I'd rather Fat Burger even In N Out   it's cheaper more convenient    And side note casino needs better ventilation because gawd smells smoke bad   notably worse smelling casino to   small Ellis Island near strip which didn't smell nearly bad  <EOR>
