Food good  staff friendly but confused times  think still learning  order wrong 2 times  place new no actual sign yet  Just look big Filipino Food sign  Its located side Albertson's next Subway  <EOR> First name place hardly noticeable except banner now open   Service 3 stars no serving spoons entrees Price $ cheap Place clean coz still new but decorated chinese vietnamese place owned non filipino !  Now Taste way underwhelming ! lots choices but mostly hit miss ! Lastly try innovate ordering via iPad but server sees give Gratuity coz server walking through iPad !  Overall if you're looking authentic Filipino cuisine better off Turo Turo Filipino buffets take your cravings guests Goldilocks real Filipino ! <EOR> So looking place hubbys birthday friend mine told new restaurant opened right down street  Because am sucker trying new things came birthday  restaurant looked clean when walked servers customer service oriented because smiles welcomed casa = Actually restart    group 15 luckily wasn't packed otherwise would've waited long time  Ok figured seating arrangement sat down server came handy dandy iphone  She took order whatever app she installed  OK far everything good until started bringing drinks food  brought stack plates handful forks spoons stack napkins  doesnt usually bother but time did  just seemed unorganized because big party didnt know handle us  guess its cool if stack silverware napkins plates    OK food    only thing remembered good pinakbet  friends said oxtail soap wasnt cooked pansit canton wasnt cooked  noodles needed cooked little longer    Will again? Maybe kareoke but eat would pass cause all MSG use food  <EOR> Food okay servers nice but need more experience should pay more attention diners needs  white male owner? helping  every time place person always wear printed T shirt which  doesn't  create warm welcoming gesture diners  guy should change attire just stay inside kitchen  Sometime pandesal if remember  time ordered bulalo server said doesn't come rice because categorized soup  know place new need lot changes adjustments but right now rate place star  <EOR> It's great place open Filipino Restaurant Southwest part town   menu pretty big  dad ordered Crispy Pata great little over cooked but never less enticing     Will definitely repeat customer  <EOR> Review based take out ordered bistek tagalog pancit lumpia   all $29 00   Serving portion really generous but didn't side rice supposed bistek   Flavors good salty   back order again  <EOR> The servers really friendly nice  order same food everytime come restaurant  Each visit food different  <EOR> Great customer service!
