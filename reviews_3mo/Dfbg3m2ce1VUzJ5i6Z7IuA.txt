My GF thought Tacos de Hongos unevenly cooked she correct but still quite good  rice rather bland Mexican rice generally however enjoyed very much also beans see above  should keep salt pepper tables most dishes very lightly salted  Facebook page most photos all tacos double tortillas received only single tortillas   Overall enjoyed meal return next week especially if still Mussels*  understand only open short time slammed more business could handle because very early good press received  If iron kinks world class Mexican restaurant   *We mistake sharing order again  <EOR> Independent restaurants Desnudo Tacos why come back Las Vegas year year  First off let say second walked into place greeted politely made feel welcome  food delicious  would rather hop car drive 5 minutes eat walk any Mexican restaurant Strip  Tinga poblano taco braised pork shoulder house made chorizo well chili infused goat taco  Both very good  wife torta de puerco which sandwich pork belly carnitas  awesome  When back getting couple those  rice beans side because they're infinitely better any other Mexican restaurant  really appreciated chef came toward middle meal asked everything tasted  sign pride well deserved  See guys soon  hope  Keep up  <EOR> The service really good  server did excellent job accommodating group very nice  decor feel am Mexican home during day dead its red black looks very authentic  tried goat pork tacos both meats tasted very bland lacked flavor  am big fan naked city pizza but don't think back Desnudo tacos any time soon  <EOR> Fantastic new eatery near Naked City Pizza Moon Doggies  bit gastro pub style authentic Mexican  chivo goat taco well mushroom al carbon steak tacos all 3 fantastic  goat tender well braised juicy yet still tasted goat!
