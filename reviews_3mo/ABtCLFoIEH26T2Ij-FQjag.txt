I've driven Roly's dozens times  small little mom and pop joint located across street UNLV  thing caught eye place sign touts best Cuban sandwiches  When someone sort claim don't just take word it  take matter into own hands   Walking saw array baked goods right away  Some being traditional items cheesecakes croissants well own selection treats Hispanic influence  Everything looked absolutely delicious but pass since looking meaty lunch  Those sweet treats put distract when sign challenge   The Cuban sandwich comes $8 + tax  comes traditional works ham sliced pork some pickles swiss cheese mustard served between own baked bread  terms flavor sandwich could more especially sliced pork  wasn't bad sandwich but left feeling indifferent  kinda Cuban sandwich bit more greasy toasty  Sorry Roly's but best Cuban sandwich  bit plain tastes  admit thing gigantic though  *3 5 stars based sandwich alone  I decided bump overall rating 4 stars due delicious everything else looked  even chorizo pizza empanadas which definitely come back try  cakes very extensive many other baked goods  sure satisfy sweet tooth  keep mind next time drop by  <EOR>
