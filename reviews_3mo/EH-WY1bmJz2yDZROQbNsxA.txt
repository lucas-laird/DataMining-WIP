I Love Roberto's    but sewer problem  Kinda hard enjoy carnitas when smells sulfur   We twice two weeks apart same problem  Go Rainbow between Robindale Warm Springs <EOR> There nothing some rolled tacos full stomach way home night debauchery   Roberto's just around corner house  food good staff friendly even English isn't strong point salsa bar cucumbers nice touch  There better places eat Mexican vegas but late night hard find anywhere better Mexican Robertos <EOR>
