Absolutely   I strongly recommend meal friends restaurant   BONUS COMMENTARY table's server Nicholas tall white guy goatee    Let advocate behalf he excellent rest table service staff guy bar   man's cocky another man's funny helpful let say while party seven under Nicholas' care wanted nothing   he good looking passadores?  No   But still 2 7 people table willing rate adorable pretty sure 28% passing score CCSD days   think  <EOR> Went date  showed around 5 30 Friday place empty  Nothing wrong guess  People slowly wandered until half full around 7 00    We sat booth bar area order happy hour priced drinks meal  Apparently happy hour drink prices good opening close long bar   few beers caipirinha definitely high octane!   The meal includes salad but salad bar you'll find other Brazilian restaurants   okay didn't come eat bunch salad anyway  meats good although nothing really stood out  could without ribs  seemed sort St  Louis style almost favorite  bacon wrapped turkey good although dog turd wrapped bacon would probably also good!   For desert some sort Snickers ice cream thing disappeared pretty fast yum!   I enticed into place $29 99 per meal cost but drinks desert tax tip etc still wound over hundy oh well good time thought service great  pushy all but didn't forget either  We'll back! <EOR> The meats offered excellent   least seven eight different types meat throughout meal   Salads side dishes marginal but certainly satisfactory   Wait staff gauchos very friendly helpful courteous   would definitely return restaurant  <EOR>
