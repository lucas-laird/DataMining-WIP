hang over food folks  thing Chinese Thai places really never excel either  saying bad place eat but nothing write home about   I've actually eaten several times but usually because convenience need many carbs system humanly possible mean portions good sized prices decent  green curry decent don't bother Pad Thai noodles gummy just authentic tastes  decent Generals Chicken  What noticed lately kinda upped place pretty casual place white tablecloths real silverware they used give plastic sporks   Once asked extra napkins she brought napkin no joke  If you're neighborhood mood check if don't drive across town it  <EOR>
