Get off Strip people! Vegas just long stretch road unlike most people think  sin city gone domestic toned down  Suburban living popping mushroom during rainy season except desert   Fine dining no longer strictly located Strip          Well ok Makino isn't exactly would call 'fine dining' but good! matter fact if looking good eats should venture locals   This Makino conveniently located within shopping complex Premium Outlet yes girlfriends  garden heaven! eat then work food walking shopping  other way around whichever   Anyway oh yes almost forgot food   This buffet Japanese seafood style  Plenty selection sushi sashimi seafood salad etc  Selection extends hot food some non seafood hot food  miso soup Udon  All self serve   Good election desert even Chocolate Fountain!!!!  Quality decent  price pay seafood buffet I'd say place beats those pricey ones inside casinos  $22 dinner large variety satisfy your cravings full  Typical Seafood buffet casinos $45+  mostly only serve shrimp cocktail crab legs  Sushi selection minimal best   <EOR> Ive many times while visiting Las Vegas   Makinos very good japanese buffet   Lots different japanese foods tons sushi   All different kinds sushi use good cuts fish!  Everything fresh or sometimes fresh frozen but everything tastes good   This last time enjoyed sushi shrimp tempura   udon wasn't good time   For dessert almond cookie flat cookie fresh fruit dipped chocolate fountain where good  <EOR>
