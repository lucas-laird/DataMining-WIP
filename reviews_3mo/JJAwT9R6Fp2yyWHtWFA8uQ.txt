Nice <EOR> I just back AYCE sushi resturant  resturant dark seating average comparison other sushi resturant  did notice weren't any seatings 2  big deal but if come just other person expect 2 empty seats next you  Kinda kills romantic vibe   came during slow time sure busy gets but store basically empty most time  also bar where watch chef crate sushi right front you  WHAT! Pretty cool  didn't sit though just sat table  only waiter while but another showed left  waiter helped very attentive without being intrusive  little hard understand but wasn't big deal  He very nice   The food  Only word it    amazing  The 5 stars probably killed suspense but whatever   lot sushi rolls  Probably around 10  Needless say pretty stuffed left  all good  Some better others  only didn't particularly enjoy fat ass  don't call no reason  huge! However did taste little bland compared other rolls  still good though    don't eat spicy food  all disappointed see most menu items some sort spicy ingredient  little turned off when saw sushi ordered jalapeños    until tasted it  FREAKING AMAZING! spiciness wasn't overwhelming all  added small zesty taste sushi  Coming person hates spicy food  best thing ever tasted jalapeños it  offer fairly small desert menu  green tea ice cream  good expected  offer desert per person if ayce deal   They few rules actually didn't bother all  common rule most ayce sushi resturant if don't finish roll then pay full price it  norm didn't really bother us  Also saw hour time limit eat menu  However slow didn't really hold that  imagine during more busy time day might more strict rule   Decor average no two table seatings 4 stars      Add seatings 2 immediately jump five  probably won't though because resturant little small   Service attentive without being intrusive 5 stars  Food amazing 5 stars  If haven't here  Definitely check out  gave coupon free meal 11th visit  definitely back looking forward future free meal many more come! <EOR> AYCE  Very slow   only customer literally each order came past 7 9 minutes apart already half full 3rd order usually don't order many time cause hate waste food but place but if back order many first order   The server nice guy but forgot salmon roe roll tuna roll  The worst thing last visit uncooked pork cheese roll  <EOR> I impressed quality cut fish   sashimi standpoint little thin  But impressed lack rice rolls!!
