This pizza A OK  could lot worse quick bite airport   It wasn't quick though  old slice plain left when arrived several people waiting around slice whatever pies coming next   After 10 minutes pepperoni pie finally emerged hands super oily slices $5   stood looking idiot taking picture pizza oil actually dripped down palm wrist arm  Serves right   They also stuffed slice which looked little scary well Hawaiian pie veggie pie some garlic knots  All those things looked even greasier   From quick search appears chain Vegas which didn't chance visit during stay wonder if chain mediocre if just seemed great since trying first time airport  Maybe try real location next time Vegas  Also maybe not  <EOR>
