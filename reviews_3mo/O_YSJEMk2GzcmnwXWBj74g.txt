I am assuming McDonalds located Plaza Hotel Casino  If would paste snippet review Plaza say again service McDonald's SUPERB One other thing really nothing Plaza but wanted mention  day line McDonald's iced tea  man front then man wheelchair being waited on  He looked pretty down something see whether downtown strip ordering some breakfast   heard cashier say $4 something saw put dollar counter   I thought uh oh she'll tell enough wonder he'll react     well he put bunch change then though cashier would ticked having count all  very wrong   she kind patient   counted then told he needed few cents more he gave dime then she said now owe penny   with big smile face  am sad say behavior just shocked me    I am used everyone being rushed treated rudely   it become commonplace   as though pay treated decent human beings   and man paid coffee food change treated extreme patience kindness  just really made happy highlights stay Vegas  McDonald's several times during stay service excellent every single time  <EOR>
