Most definitely 'ultimate buffet dining experience'  buffet everything little heart could ever desire  brunch wonderful especially all you can drink Mimosas hiccup!   HUGE props  Mediterranean bar lox bagel sandwich bar  Top notch service  C'mon Vegas without buffet? <EOR> My favorite hyped buffet Vegas   lines typically manageable prices reasonable but food atmosphere awesome     Wide wide selection food expect nice buffet also clean well maintained spacious dining area     Sure Wynn more bells whistles but didn't blow away   why wait long lines sit cramped tables pay more same buffet quality food?  Cravings hits sweet spot price quality atmosphere equilibrium  <EOR>
