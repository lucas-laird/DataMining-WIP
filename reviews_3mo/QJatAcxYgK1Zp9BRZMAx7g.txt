When arrived expecting line door   NYC location Battery Park waited line 30 mins   being opening day line could hitting street   didn't wait long line less 10 mins before able order   We ordered double Shackburger ShackMeister Dog Cheese Fries Black White Shake chocolate vanilla    whole thing cost over $20   looking table sit luckily two women leaving offered table   give buzzer let know your food ready   The look everything look almost same remembered original but while since it   food good flavor but salty side taste   Would call best burger West Coast?  debatable     On value think In n Out better based price   If you're simple flavor maybe salty your taste   liked fact wasn't extra bun no meat end many time when eat burgers   good sign portions bun patty perfect   location better Battery Park reasons being inside sitting don't deal NYC pigeons trying steal your food!  I would want come again try other burgers other items menu   opening week many other eatery work some kinks right new location  <EOR> Finally!  admit may biased bc east coaster prefers most burger joints over N shall leave tips   The portions fairly sized if don't want stuffed try going single burger share fries most definitely treat yourself concrete and or milkshake   custard theirs unique complements burgers very well just sayin   Enjoy taste NYC! <EOR> I've never Shake Shack walking along strip Grand Opening day   Because saw short ish line decided check something always wanted check glad did!!  I ordered Smoked burger bacon cheese half tea half lemonade drink   really enjoyed bun usually eat buns burger   But bread nice soft!!!  burger also really really good   fact patty wasn't salty   did however overdo peppers burger I definitely recommend bit   but completely overwhelmed burger hot peppers much scoop some out    Also half half drink must try!!!   Would definitely back try something else again! <EOR> In N Out nothing worry about   Shake Shack East Coast favorite  now doing business Vegas   ones Philly NYC liked them lot     My experience location less average  menu choices available because ingredients all sold sold hot dogs chicken dog   just ok $6 50   basic Nathan's dawg could easy    Also no root beer no cheese sauce no water cups no bacon no mushrooms just neutralizes greatness burger could be   disappointing because hyped family set expectation higher location could deliver   basically thought overpriced In N Out  Given opening week new operation can't fault Shake Shack much   come back few months sure sort things better     Milkshakes point rich flavor quality ice cream taste  rely great shakes when visit   fact if just came shakes fries think would Fatisfied! <EOR> This best burger ever period   Better all high priced burger places strip better out      Burger simply perfect combo beef bun cheese special sauce  <EOR> Unforgettable experience salty fries burger saggy  order supposedly famous ice cream big container but no lead it  family 8 California feel mistreated  location looks decent compares other burger chain but may becouse its new Hope Maintained <EOR> Another NYC staple right around neighborhood!!  Stoked actually first West Coast franchise Las Vegas instead elsewhere   Conveniently situated Las Vegas Blvd those happen galavanting around Strip need some place quick meal   however isn't case locals trying such pain   Parking alone 10 15 minute walk New York New York Monte Carlo only find yourself lining amongst large crowd once arriving establishment   least queue relatively fast wait didn't take long despite line being quite lengthy   Unlike other locations gone spot C Line which lets customers buying anything off menu but food items bypass regular line   serves excellent pit stop frozen custards even alcoholic beverages while strolling around area   Food just great meal NYC MIA seasoned burger patty topped lettuce tomato ShackSauce between pillowy potato bun   People usually compare burger place other joints such In N Out Five Guys but say prefer ones latter   also serve several beers tap   Perhaps favorite ShackMeister which made just company Brooklyn Brewery      Overall Shake Shack definitely top fast food burger spots town   Excellent burgers superb customer service awesome ambiance   already see myself being least once week! <EOR> Been waiting Shake shack almost year now     worth wait  burgers great fries very tasty  Location wait beverages main issues place  no NYNY entrance just LV blvd  <EOR> Being generous extra star     So came today some raving reviews friend mine  She likes place over In N Out super delicious blah blah blah   Came around 2pm short line outside spoke usher guy outside says he eats 4 things day brings then back home wife   so start thinking    big burgers?   He explains menu works all good stuff   Went inside waited second line looked over decor   I don't care   It's food  Just looked kinda hipster umami esq   No big deal   Ended getting single bacon peppers while gf single claim fame sorry forget names   opted single because couldn't myself spend 3 extra dollars 4oz meat patty  Chicago style hot dog instead try more menu fries topped off concrete kinda blizzard DQ strawberry waffle pieces  side fries bill came $28 bucks    whoo   that's   a lot   Got pager waited few   then food    First impressions looks good  Kinda small side burger wise  little smaller In N Out but bigger patties  Gf tomato piece lettuce mine good amount bacon peppers  Nice crinkle fries good looking concrete  Thought single scoop pretty small price  Chicago dog Nathan's small but looked part without nuclear green relish   Taste bacon good peppers little bite  No lettuce tomato this   Kinda disappointed  Tasted good but OMG best thing ever! Bread mix brioche hawaiian split but all way ended pocket thing  Gf's good but ordinary  Shack sauce kinda lacking  Nothing special  dog good  Split grilled  Good condiments but no casing no snap   fries great  Crinkle kept crunch  Although   for burger place tries exemplify organic no GMO specialty burger place would expected real potatoes   not some Sysco Ore Ida frozen potatoes fries  concrete good  liked that  waffle pieces crunchy tasty  strawberry good ice cream good  Note say ice cream   not custard advertise  frozen custard   and certain consistency smoothness taste   totally different froyo ice cream  but this   this ice cream   Final thoughts I'd come dessert  think burgers WAY overpriced  $9 small double cheese burger worth it  could gourmet gastro pub type burgers huge 1 2 1 3lb all kinds oddball toppings price  offer no combos help pricing  Taste mediocre  comparing major competitors In N Out more flavor but if even that   give more veggies $9 3 patties real hand cut fries drink  5 guys many toppings homestyle taste fresh cut fries drink well around same price    I lucky Vegas try place where spending money comes easy  If home I'd very angry  <EOR> Tried double stack black white milk shake  Unexpected super duper deliciousness!

Yes but also thought overhyped  think better version Five Guys  If haven't Shake Shack definitely recommend it  <EOR> I expecting great things place reading reviews but disappointed   shack burger cheese fries both just ok    Just under $10 bucks single burger fries case worth it  Great location busy place sure great but think would rather catch cab im rather eat here  <EOR> I've craving Shake Shack since last visited New York! happy opened west coast!   This place located outside strip infront NYNY Hotel of course   place obviously new but really well kept inside workers friendliest!! chick named Inez ring she best! last meal Vegas wanted take some back home family  She insisted eat food first when ready to go orders come right back instead waiting line  thought really nice her  only but other workers friendly clean your table even offer refills your drink    Okay but back food  Shack burger exactly remembered it! delicious  Stack Burger time deep fried mushroom middle  take first bite cheese oozes out  OH  MY  GOD  freakin' bomb! cheese fries strawberry milkshake point too   Man craving Shake Shack again! love place  amazing food without rude fast paced environment New York!  Until meet again    <EOR> Very disappointed visit location Shake Shack  When learned opening location home town excited because ones NYC gone world good  stuffed mushroom sandwich really tough chewy stringy couldn't even bite through it  fries all ready sitting waiting ordered didn't them  Hubby Shack Stack Burger whole thing just smelled tasted grease  quality beef terrible  Lots hard fat pieces gross  hope improve quality because want Shake Shack close home  <EOR> taste good! Still prefer #innout but would come again  can't compare west coast counterpart  bun stroke genius bc contents doesn't fall end    The meat tad dry but still very delicious  mushroom burger burgers try    Their custard basically ice cream  suggest skip that    Fries fries  <EOR> Another Burger place? So Shake Shack different all rest?  In simple answer The Shack Stack burger   breaded fried portobello mushroom stuffed gooey cheese top juicy cheese burger    This separates shake shack everyone else  Although offer regular burgers cheese burgers well hotdogs uniqueness shack stack found SS burger place would keep coming back to    On downside price shack stack just under $10 00 nothing else but sandwich  may order  fries cheesy fries just thick custard based milk shake    I love East coast restaurants venturing  West coast keep them coming  <EOR> Can fault place trying hard? Shake Shack provides solid burger  fries usually quite good  concretes divine  being said if you've experienced other Shake Shacks New York DC elsewhere comes off well trying hard   It's trying hard New York Las Vegas  Even point being attached gaudy New York New York  They've giant video wall seems play nothing but endless loops New York talks all local ingredients other Shake Shacks use but location   When 1 30pm weekday  restaurant packed but line manageable some stalking able seat  burger would expect Shake Shack which say quite good  However flummoxed trying order two different beers then root beer none which actually around  disappointing   If you've never Shake Shack nice well if discount usual Vegas clientele  But if you've experienced Shake Shack somewhere else you're better off trying another Vegas' many delicious burger restaurants  <EOR> February 15 2015  First meal Valentine Getaway!

Lots seating inside outside  Lots different things try menu  root beer float black white milkshake burger fries  Burger kinda small crinkle fries weren't bad  hard rate place having Bachi's gourmet burgers  But does feel comparable n out   Overall does its job hits spot  wouldn't mind coming again while Vegas  Especially since they're open till 2am  Good late night snack  many different things try menu! <EOR> Disappointment but still yummy   Just having New York   think burger kind smaller New York too   came basketball game kind late maybe didn't give them fair chance   come when am tired hungry   water filtered could taste nasty faucet water   The place super clean service super fast   just taste ny didn't memory it  <EOR> Shake Shack right under N personal Burger O Meter  finally check hearing much it    glad did  Both burgers cooked perfectly    juicy! buns amazing  sure buns use but woah  Weird know    but both noticed while eating    So avoid sounding anymore Sir Mix Lot    shake! vanilla shake    honestly thought it'd little bigger size  But shake quality taste solid 8 10    Shake Shack serves some crispy crinkle french fries   which also enjoyed  serving size another thought would little bigger  strip pricing less though it'd  be  Two burgers order fries vanilla shake came $21 some change cheap but horrible either    I love decor! location clean spacious    lots tvs mostly showing sports night dined in   also quick window outside drink orders   and outdoor seating  best pay attention menu know want order while line when window don't waste time  never Shake Shacks east coast but definitely worth checking if you're area! <EOR> Solid fast food burger option Vegas  Outside seating windy but pretty comfortable  line moves quickly because efficient ordering system  single ShackBurger cheese vanilla shake  patty thick grilled nicely  beef tasted better most other fast food burger joints  bun engineering impressive  There's little flap back keep contents your burger falling out  Overall though burger bland compared Shake Shack's more established West Coast competitor  bun vegetables little boring  Fresh ingredients important but aren't everything  seasoning sauce left something desired  vanilla shake mediocre  Again tasted high quality ingredients used  texture excellent but flavor bit disappointing  try specialty burger malt shake next time  <EOR> There's lot hype around Shake Shack right now say    it's pretty cool   First always trying 'famous' places seeing famous burger place NY originally drawing hours long lines definitely wanted try it   Second shop cool  more modern typical fast food burger good amount outdoor seating  patio part strip side check goings LV blvd but still kinda private tucked away behind some bushes   Third good selection beer including Brooklyn Brewery made specifically Shake Shack even though didn't particularly love one    Last but least burgers hot dogs fries all good  little higher priced because they're famous Las Vegas Strip but extravagant    If you're area visiting anything NYNY across street Coke World! I'd definitely recommend walking over Shake Shack  feel free bring big group! <EOR> Delicious  don't care greasy was  line seemed long but moved fairly quickly order processed quickly  <EOR> These days burger burger  many good burgers where live San Diego just don't hype around brand  Maybe New York don't many good burger options    The burgers pretty small but only cost $5 $7 so  Over all burgers unremarkable  said many outstanding burger options now really above beyond attention  <EOR> It's almost good New York   Crinkle Cuts Concretes!  I craving some comfort food team took narrow loss season ended headed Shake Shack  asked bunch people  directions nobody noted entrance outside casino but now you'll know suffer same misery walking circles 15 minutes   Once arrived saw medium size line nothing compared normal Madison Square Park line though could handle it  also noted C Line non hot food  differs B Line original et Shakes    Once ordered food similar level used MSP location  only weakness burger which tasted just little bit off but couldn't figure exactly why  Even day later still can't seem figure off burger  only finished 3 4 before moved Crinkle Cut fries which  just good recall happen favorite thing Shake Shack   Finally Shake Attack  concrete spot on  chocolate hazelnut custard special week subbed normal chocolate custard delicious   Now bad  Vegas priced seems more New York  Secondly staff though friendly just don't seem same order taking efficiency New York  Maybe fault since most people going location aren't regulars but definitely noticeable   Will back?
