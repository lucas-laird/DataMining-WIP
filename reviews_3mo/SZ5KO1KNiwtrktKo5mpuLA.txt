I'm surprised no else reviewed place ok fine shocked all considering freakin' intimidating place prices! pretty well hidden through elevator before actually reach restaurant  highly recommend though if won some good ol' cold hard cash some caesar's palace rewards points something cover your dining experience here  absolutely LOVE duck wraps heart stopping may be   keep them coming! Live shrimp soy sauce fresh chili peppers? YUM! menu but asparagus garlic which completes meal perfectly  no ordinary asparagus guarantee you    CAUTION stay away bird's nest soup  $100 dollars? kidding me! Stick fried banana  <EOR> Step 1 Gamble Step 2 Casino Comp Step 3 Empress Court Step 4 = Very delicious  Pricey  But want terms Chinese    400$ Fish fresh sea? No Problem  <EOR> This Place kinda hidden ride creepy elevator up    O_O     but food alright   kinda more expensive chinese food should but its bad  Simple soup costs 8$ ^  pork fried rice good! Came place twice!   bad     restaurant looks kinda modern newish  many people come here    But should give shot  <EOR>
