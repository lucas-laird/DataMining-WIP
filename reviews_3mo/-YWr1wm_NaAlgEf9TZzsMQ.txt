This probably worst Chinese buffet ever gone to  only saving graces place large selection dim food cheap price   only 8 99 all day weekend weekday  However most dishes overcooked undercooked sushi terrible  worst part fact whole family food poisoning eating here    we just few crab legs ended vomiting entire next day  way ruin vacation   I recommend going better chinese buffet Pacific buffet just down road  <EOR> I live down street Super Jumbo several asian buffets area favorite since opened   The food good wide ranging  favorite fried plantains stuffed shrimp  price right service good  normally dont hit any particular buffet more few times because many choices area well Las Vegas    Of course being buffet food isnt going great being hot trays awhile but before 7pm   The weak spot food deserts except fresh fruit would avoid including frozen     ice cream    My way rating Vegas buffet back?   keep going back  30 times last count  <EOR>
