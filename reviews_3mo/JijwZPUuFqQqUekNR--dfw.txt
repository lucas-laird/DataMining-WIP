Ate being picked Vegas airport friends rental car   Way outside main strip bout 5 miles but large cookie cutter casino if keep your gambling eating close together then bad   Nice atmosphere dim lighting high back deep upholstered booths vintage photos overall upscale steakhouse feel   able sit 7 Sunday night around 7 30 pm without much wait which great cuz starving mofo arrived into LAS     The food okay casino steakhouse   started splitting escargot appetizer which included mushroom caps stuffed snail garlic butter then baked puff pastry   Reminded being cruise ship b c thats probably only other place tried escargot   wasn't choice but enjoyed it   menu states use prime grade beef anxiously pleased   Tried smallest cut prime rib @ 12 oz alright   Nice texture flavor but mine little more done med rare ordered but didn't mind much b c 1 hungry 2 plate under $20 score value   serve generous pour red wine glass conservative selection most being around $7 $10 score value again   So place quite memorable steakhouse but also quite above casino coffee shop   fairly satisfied paid   if wasn't brought probably would never set foot but when traveling just flow see where takes Vegas usually better not  <EOR>
