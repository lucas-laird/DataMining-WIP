The waiter also shared table he's Mercadito's corporate trainer EEK?!?! Throughout meal he training new hire which concerning hospitality personality and service left LOT desired    Though food decent returning treated if am  guest someone's home when dining out  <EOR> This FIRST time enjoying new restaurant!! drinks fantastic food much FLAVOR!   would recomend try tacos FIRST! need come BACK AGAIN try moré plates  <EOR> Food great!

Everything tried menu exceeded expectations  would recommend bringing children but great place lunch late dinner  atmosphere calming welcoming  Staff super friendly attentive  recommend friends  <EOR> Expensive generic   ordering server informed since family style dining each item come when its ready  Looking around room saw lot awkward tables where person would plate food other people table nothing   also quite amusing see plate four tacos placed table 5 clearly hungry adults   next dish came 5 minutes later   Focus seems taco plates which $14 50 comes 4 tacos all same type which told perfect sharing     11 different kinds tacos menu but when ordering plate you're restricted order 4 same    The food very pedestrian but expect Mexican joint locations only Chicago New York?  Manager gave service industry card come back try them again 50% off service industry night   Might give second shot if around during time but special trip  <EOR> Went lunch high hopes  Happy report management service kitchen staff models efficiency quite personable   however food just plain disappointing  don't mind paying more high quality food bold flavor but served epic fail   Ordered guacamole appetizer   it bland chopped way chunky  Chips fine  shared Carne tacos Polo torte   both utterly unremarkable  don't understand all hype or justifies four bucks soda your lunch   Zero desire return  <EOR> I read some bad reviews before going little nervous but really wanted try place anyways    really glad did because loved it! definitely going back! food drinks tried amazing very decently priced! $9 margarita $14 plate 4 street tacos $5 50 large side fried plantains $9 chips guacamole that little pricey!    friend split every thing ended evening $30 each    really bad nice dinner Vegas!    The only thing didn't consider themselves family style dining bring each dish its ready instead bringing everything together     tacos came 5 minutes friends    I highly recommend mango Chipotle guacamole    unique sweet smokey flavor loved  Pastor tacos    roasted pork grilled pineapple yum!   Since very new also highly recommend reservation!  did seated immediately but Friday night lot people waiting <EOR> I pleasantly surprised food really good! Pastor tacos excellent    lots flavor citrus salsa yum!  husband Carne Asada Large Plate also fantastic!  started off queso   which very good but size laughable price  The skillet could fit just egg serve queso in   basically portion person stretched share two people but $10 bit high tad bit cheese  state beginning dinner everything sharable assume large portions   case  Unless very small appetite much sharing able do   prices definitely high side portion size but flavors worth everything tasted good   only negatives which more annoying negative are 1 quite loud bar noise takes over dining room 2 realize trying maximize small space but little two seater tables quite small really hope good neighbors your fellow diners   wish seating area different but definitely worth try restaurant   food worth it! reservation waiting long time! <EOR> Great spot!

While mulling over restaurant choices Mercadito's suggested!

Yeah well normally but another couple waiting spot vacated cleaned  sitting bar  She apologized moved table dining room assuring Taco Tuesday still applied us  soon server came he told didn't apply dining room however he would check supervisor see if okay  end he couldn't find supervisor but gave discount anyway which cool   We appreciated server's brisk energetic service  Never water glasses empty food came prompty except last set tacos   So tried 5 different types street tacos mahi mahi fish tacos carne tacos al pastor wild mushroom pancitas tacos   If key criticism tacos ate overall muddled flavors all food  would say most tacos just many different competing flavors going truly exceptional dish    Overall liked al pastor least  rendition al pastor overly sauced lacked meat roasted stick smokiness al pastor good    The carne tacos solid watercress jicama combination top  only issues watercress jicama overwhelmed carne bit much  mahi mahi good but fried mahi mahi's crispy coating soft quickly could use extra time fryer  pancita tacos okay digged interesting texture chicharron but didn't overly fatty pieces pork belly  hongos thought best dish night umami hit mushroom matching well tomato sofrito   In general food largely okay quite pricey considering level cuisine here  am undecided whether return if would need discount involved  3 starred review  <EOR> The only reason giving place more star because chips salsa appetizing! Downside though pay them unlike most Mexican restaurants serve them complimentary! three types salsas tasteful but would've more could actually dip chips them    Enough chips salsa though   on service food  sat table part booth part chairs sat chair side  When waiter arrived he popped right shoulder afraid turn talk since he close face! He pretty creepy rest meal just when ordering    I ordered flautas friend tacos  She said tacos mediocre flautas also anything special  however disappointed when specifically said no cheese multiple times course showed cheese top  hate being return food but due religious reasons absolutely could cheese specific when returned food  long returned food plate clearly cheese scraped off because still remnants cheese plate  irked friend waiting eat just didn't want send plate back again  sucked ate around small remnants cheese    I back though! should ashamed themselves taking religious dietary restriction more seriously! would only back enjoy some chips salsa some drinks patio even though service wasn't great  <EOR> Very disappointed pay chips salsa select five choices couple tsp each much   Very limited Menu selection entree wanted! Only corn shells avail no flour  didn't eat Bracheto entree very good! did enjoy Nacho's service good! won't back <EOR> Had dinner last night thoroughly enjoyed ourselves  The restaurant busy good thing made reservation   We  ordered Traditional Guacamole Mixto Ceviche Carne Asada Nachos Guacamole great   little small portion size but very tasty  The Carne Asada nachos great!!  Very tasty nice portions carne asada other tasty toppings  The Mixto Ceviche okay   best definitely best  Next time skip dish try something else   After apps ordered several different types tacos    Pollo Tacos   AMAZING!!!

Mercadito fairly new Mexican restaurant located inside Red Rock Casino  Inside pretty unique they've some street style art hanging but very classy modern look feel  very big when came Saturday night around 8pm packed  Maybe wasn't best idea come time but music blaring loud more nightclub  just huge fan having scream someone foot away me   On menu you'll find lot classic Mexican dishes tacos even some small tapas style plates  They've pretty extensive tequila list well signature cocktails  coolest things menu offer several variations house made salsas guacamole ceviche  ended ordering salsa tasting which includes chips 3 salsas your choice only $3 50  3 chose roja least favorite just didn't bold flavor other 2 tomatillo chipotle  tomatillo perfect   salty sweet just right amount heat chipotle amazing smoky taste without being overpowering   For dinner ordered ceviche while good feel just can't find awesome ceviche town  citrus flavor pretty spot but addition pineapple little sweeter like  None salsas complimented enough give spicy kick looking for  pictures looks small plate but there's ton good sized juicy shrimp served 2 big tostadas which wasn't huge fan of  real soft texture ended using chips ceviche more  also ordered take mac cheese which pretty strange but tasty  manchego cheese flavor really intense spiciness but throwing corn weird threw texture off   As far service they've lot work on  Several times throughout night sitting empty glasses flag someone down refill  managers just standing around chit chatting employees entire time service just wasn't great  might well add don't serve regular iced tea well either  Since prices bit higher side won't rushing back but enjoyed food there's enough ooh  aah items menu back door eventually  <EOR> Had dinner Mercadito Monday   packed   dark music loud loud because cool    Even thought crowded seated pretty quickly   decided try trio salsas chips   don't lot any salsas but  probably best because over indulging chips salsa easy Mexican places   tomatillo chile de arbol roja   All good but preferred tomatillo which nice kick   None chunky all blended nice consistency   server offered more chips but didn't any because didn't want overeat chips   Each serving tacos around $12 $16 recall 4 small street sized tacos per order   buddy carne pastor   pastor favorite 2 chili rubbed pork tender but little crispiness   But wasn't blown away taco   For side tried mac n cheese which served manchego cheese chiles corn   easily best thing ate dinner   thick sauce but ton cheese flavor   chiles give nice kick   I'd absolutely again eat Mercadito   I'd return if am area but certainly wouldn't special trip Red Rock eat here  <EOR> Las Vegas weekly wrote camaron taco taco year Vegas love shrimp tacos try it  Saturday night  wow could tell wasnt only read article because summer time vegas place jumping  grabbed couple  margaritas bar which bartender informed U S  today rating them top 10 margaritas country first skeptical but could tell wasn't regular margaritas Cadillac definitely worth 8$       30 45min finally table dining room which regretted getting table patio because weather great   Immediately water  glasses being filled server Matt greet us  wife I's first time planned giving hard time asking alot questions but sure enough just margaritas proven wrong he very knowledgeable even though could tell he alot other tables  since busy he still showed great time  starters traditional guacamole tomatillo salsa guacamole amazing felt salsa small no refills which bummer  main course shrimp tacos wife beer battered mahi mahi tacos lil disappointed first could mix match because really wanted try pastor tacos but ordered some mexican corn cobb needed save room dessert  say? tacos more  lived hype dont know which liked more all know haven't tacos ive enjoyed much very long time  mexican corn icing cake recommend no matter order corn cobb all say WOW  dessert coconut flan which delicious but very small only 4 bites which guess fine because saved room two more margaritas added guava time Matt's reccomendation      Mercadito very much mexican tapas restaurant which love tapas knew going love  place  dont recommend bringing your kids Saturday night its loud busy but recommend having matt your server  bringing anyone would impress  <EOR> Disappointed theme review  Mexican food? Where? served some hipster doofus version upscale Mexican fare  does Mexican Restaurant effectively mess beans rice?   Don't expect chips salsa  Unless would pay $3 50 3 tablespoons salsa handful chips    luck friend  $3 50 knew price when ordered it  fact served free chips salsa vast majority Mexican places patronized  portion price  kidding shit? Pretentious Mexican food paradoxical gets  Skip folks  You've warned  <EOR> Overall pretty disappointed place   food might rate 4 but factor prices poor quality service no way give any higher 2 star   Some examples $15 4 mini size tacos   guacamole much lime overpowering   going boutique Mexican food place yet flavors just don't justify overpriced menu   Salad choices limited 2 greens salad which isn't bad Mexican chef salad   When asking if 8 pay add grilled swordfish answer NO but add chicken? ??   If sub $15 per person pricing level 6 people bill $150 only appetizer ordered pre tax pre tip might rate better   As service   being plate team kitchen   last plate took 10 minutes first plate last plate salad    If stuck Red Rock suppose better Albertos down street but much  <EOR> So finally came over weekend   outside patio beautiful thats where want sit  inside dining area reminds PF Changs @ McCarren another Airport bar layout very long narrow likely bump elbows your neighboors while eating  Also its Mexican food Tapas   know trends trends but Tapas dying since Toro's moved good move may add more traditional mexican only surmise its matter time before place does just replace something else  Overall still take El Burrito Frank Fina's    Also no reached Mercadito previous review assume ZERO social media presence  <EOR> Very good food but service still needs little work   Very friendly staff but bit disorganized   Also tables outside low leaves wanting sit adults table!  All all place would recommend  <EOR> I dinner buddy gym   lol   under dressed occasion   place   cozy semi dimly lit atmosphere plays EDM music background     Great place take girl first date   Monday night place decent busy   plates small meant share   Pretty decent quality prices kinda high got   but complaining     I would definitely again maybe some gambling afterwards  <EOR> I other day wanted margarita seem pre mixed made order  guy table next said worst margaritas he ever had  Also don't mix match tacos restaurant many rules  never seen many customers complaining  won't coming back <EOR> Okay all bad reviews thinking really want expensive non Mexican Mexican restaurant bad service? Well just happens relatives staying Red Rock he wants try it   looks cool food looks good pretty busy inside   $100 later pretty satisfied   Really   We ordered carne camaron tacos lobster tostadas both types Ceviches along salsas   Okay didn't them charging salsas ridiculous   But overall food really good!  camaron dorado ceviches very different each other could used more lime   Both tacos great although needed take easy sauce camaron tacos   lobster tostadas die for   server don't recall name very attentive prompt although orders exactly speedy decided departure all reviews saw   And thinking    seen more few reviews where mention very Mexican   want trendy Mexican TAPAS restaurant want traditional Mexican?  What's point that?  believe experimenting traditional flavors making something other traditional part experience enjoyment   Mexican?  really   good?  Absolutely   expensive?  Yes but every other tapas restaurant well outside Spain   If want good tamale El Cholo   Good tacos?  El Taurino   Okay both L A  but point   You're REAL Mexican food     Great tasting NON Mexican food great atmosphere great service at least 4 star restaurant   Despite $100 setback   Table for 1 Factor Actually despite trendiness fast pace place think might actually bad solo dinner   bar casino don't see why not  <EOR> Adrienne best waitress you'll find! She's personable sociable fun around  When eat you'll satisfied food service  sure ask seated Adrienne's section  <EOR> I can't say enough delicious all food here    step away traditional Mexican food delightful tapas themed fusion  yet taste anything made smile    Service top notch smile   big fan sword fish tacos shrimp ceviche    Two thumbs yelper! <EOR> Sadly Mercadito does live its hype having best fish taco  NY Magazine thinking? But then again 2006 somewhere else  excited check restaurant when opened Red Rock Resort course taste famous fish tacos  Unfortunately arrived dry over cooked  takes lot send dishes back kitchen but occasion no choice  waitress super polite upon looking dish even admitted wasn't par  She returned several minutes later much more desirable plate mahi mahi tacos  other dishes quite good service point  Hopefully just fluke but best taco far  <EOR> Have visited frequently never bad experience  Incredible service amazing atmosphere excellent food  Happy hour favorite but way great time! <EOR> SO LOUD table 4 couldn't hear each other all   tacos just okay nothing special nothing would ever order again   steak w slaw pork w pineapple   also ordered all 3 guacamole options 3 different salsas   salsa isn't chunky consistency  it's meant drizzle chips spoon   chips cold very thick   kind salsa dig into your chips  trying tacos fancy instead concentrating flavors   iced tea terrible it's sangria   Instead having 3 mediocre guacamoles   start 1 nail it   Once master move create more   better chips back drawing board w your salsa selections tacos   Service great   Never ever returning! YUCK!  WASTE TIME MONEY   Also waste space   once again another restaurant FAIL space Red Rock     If looking tasty guacamole   head Cantina Laredo  table side guacamole right front tell them exactly want it   If dying try place someone twisted your arm into going      I suggest sit outside just order alcohol nothing else   can't stress enough outdoor area only good thing Mercadito  <EOR> Had high expectations    Food just average    Charge much get  Tables way close together  way loud inside  can't hear yourself think     coming again! <EOR> I could but restaurant doesn't deserve     short sweet review    I don't eat meat veggie options abomination  fact charge $14 across board ALL taco dishes which  4 tiny tacos Crazy     mushroom taco valued same price steak tacos fish tacos beyond me!   And although tacos good without side rice beans salad SOMETHING would pay most $1 50 taco making $6 dish appetizer even!
