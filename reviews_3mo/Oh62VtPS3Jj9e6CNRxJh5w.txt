As wait staff while did nice experience Monica in restaurant only! rest time crap  woman took order slow intellectually couldn't tell which which menu  Don't wrong lot empathy understanding wait staffs understand work long hours properly compensated but Jesus Christ paying customer some goddamn competence?  Lastly waiter different woman took order some odd reason kept calling man  dude am paying customer  We're pals  don't expect 'sir ' but certainly don't want called 'man ' either  Verdict food 2 service 2   My point you're Vegas if you're going spend money elsewhere  If place can't better earn your business you've other choices  Walk down Wynn Red 8  More professional staffs most certainly better food  <EOR> My oh My!
