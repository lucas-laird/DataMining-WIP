I glad see Vegas outpost Blue Ribbon Sushi one best sushi bars NYC   While extremely pricey many rolls where shocking $15 20 quality selection fantastic  sushi meticulously prepared presented exquisite pieces art   Get Toshi Special delicate crispy salmon skin outside! The Sakana San Shu  right salmon yellowtail tuna must try    Service great helpful making choices extensive menu suggest sitting sushi bar see chefs work magic  can't think better way blow one's winnings craps table Blue Ribbon Cosmopolitan! <EOR> I very disappointed experience  Blue Ribbon Soha expecting same quality food  Sadly mistaken  restaurant beautiful presentation spectacular service usually attentive but biggest disappointment food  party four all ordered various sushis sashimis but disappointed each item  rice all dishes slightly hard gummy if left while made using low grade rice  ikura sushi unbelievably dry lacking any flavor all  ordered three box sushis disappointed each one  uni tamago wasn't anything spectacular  smoked salmon shiso box awful  only rice horrible but salmon extremely oily tasteless  tasted similar gravlox found low grade buffets  tuna avocado also mediocre  Despite box sushis usually being pre made rice still should hard dry been  Good rice essential quality excellent sushi sadly Blue Ribbon Vegas did use quality rice  only did sushi taste horrendous but price outrageous least quality served  OMAKASAKE $48!  crazy high amount maybe dozen pieces awful tasting sushi   single piece ikura sushi $6! gotten double number pieces same price lot tastier  Each box sushi $25 $30 complete waste money    This those places really want good looks delicious but just doesn't taste good  those places date when don't care taste  impressive expensive but tastes horrendous  Sadly give place only star because poor quality food  If they're going charge much sushi least use better quality ingredients  unhappy meal still hungry eat dinner someplace else despite already spending couple hundred dollars awful sushi  would say even though may look very nice isn't worth it  Skip Blue Ribbon save yourself money time upset stomach  However if you're ever New York should definitely visit Blue Ribbon over there  wonderful experience let down Vegas Blue Ribbon  <EOR> Strange may seem Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar Grill only couple pieces sushi   Instead ordering things could elsewhere asked server he enjoyed   He suggested Oxtail Fried Rice Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken   Interesting     I ordered he suggested awesome   fried chicken came wasabi honey sauce served side   Really quite interesting take fusion cuisine   I'd recommend anyone likes fried chicken something new really good chance catching on   fried rice something totally different altogether  top fried rice could only described thin egg omelet pouch filled liquid bone marrow goodness   instructed broke open pouch mixed together fried rice absolutely awesome!  While NO WAY healthy really really TASTY   The sushi priced bit high guess expected sushi place strip   did interesting offering   a spicy lobster roll   ordered pretty good but probably people expect small roll costs more 10 bucks   I'll definitely back try different things   found service attentive helpful would easily recommend anyone visiting Cosmopolitan Las Vegas general   If could I'd give Oxtail Fried Rice five star rating all itself! <EOR> I say pretty mediocre restaurant   quite large party 6 people experience real mixed bag   found ambiance pretty nice pleasing   place clean well appointed   We ordered several rolls few things which bothered us   First wasn't card write your sushi order down on   just ordered bunch different things made kind difficult keep track ordered  I believe ordered 20 pieces nigiri 6 7  rolls    Additionally service pretty sub par   point waiting more water empty glass held air approximately 10 minutes     needless say wasn't pleased   As far actual food pretty good   rolls fresh appetizing edamame quite tasty   Thankfully didn't put 18% bill tip automatically able let them know didn't really appreciate service   Now understand place still soft opening review likely outdated few months <EOR> This place great! day 3 opened inside Cosmopolitan   love Blue Ribbon NYC recent Las Vegas addition keeps bar high   Fresh fish good selection knowledgeable attentive wait staff   would recommend making reservation opentable  very helpful   Overall great meal! Don't expect cheap dinner though over $50 person if buy wine couple rolls  <EOR> I pretty excited going having dinner here   but surprise quite disappointed  First dining room feels more lounge  Loud music couch chairs sit on  felt place just listen music sip cocktails  food very disappointing  Nothing made say oh delicious! tuna hamachi tartare we're ok but can't really wrong those  sushi bar salad boring quite bland miso dipping sauce ok but literally dip salad into cus no taste  other dishes can't remember names but weren't very good  only dish liked oxtail fried rice  Also service great  waiter extremely nice friendly  But alone won't again  Definitely worth price! Oh might add waited hour table  WORTH IT! <EOR> Amazing quality very good service   just upset typical Las Vegas pricing $10 EACH piece nigiri  Toro    but Vegas suck up   house junmai ginjo sake great $60 bottle   Very floral dry perfect sashimi   fresh Aji they bring whole fish plate then deep fry carcass when done raw flesh must get   also bit upset amount items available menu   4 5 things wanted   Other gorgeous Cosmopolitan hotel houses some amazing restaurants NY does disappoint   Just bring some serious cash if hungry  <EOR> WORST SUSHI LIFE FAR!! seriously  thought eating canned tuna wrapped seaweed rice  even presentation just rolls piece board  Payed 100 bucks 8 tiny pieces sushi  Miso soup 7 bucks  rather eat top roman again   Whoever gives more 2 stars place never good sushi  <EOR> Blue Ribbon just fancy new restaurants Cosmopolitan taking its original location New York City   wanted try something new let very loquacious waitress few recommendations off!  To start ordered Ichinokura Himezen Sweet Sake served cold  mentioned some previous reviews no sake expert but thought Ichinokura really quite tasty   definitely recommend if you're looking something light crisp   The first dish waitress suggested smoked pork belly 2 skewers $5 5    thought easily best dish night   richness pork belly perfectly balanced lightness pickled onions watercress top   this   Our second course Kanpachi Usuzukuri which raw amberjack topped yuzu pepper 8 pieces $22    amberjack fresh good flavors combination yuzu accompanying ponzu   Nothing mind blowing   Finally waitress brought Oxtail Fried Rice which she pointed signature dishes 3 servings $26 5    REALLY good but INCREDIBLY rich   really can't wrong cubes bone marrow but no way would able eat all own   Blue Ribbon pretty tasty   wish bit cheaper but overall success   Next time I'd try some more sushi   Next time   <EOR> Great ambiance great service AMAZING FOOD!  husband super excited when found NYC restaurant coming Vegas   My group dropped just appetizer  waitress super nice helpful pushy all order understood didn't want eat much   She suggested Amberjack sashimi 8 thin slices ponzu sauce pork belly skewers appetizer side   Both amazing   pork belly comes 2 pieces skewer feeds maybe 2 sure order enough whole table cuz no gonna want share!  also Oxtail fried rice based Yelp reviews disappointed all   waitress also recommended fruity sake Ichinokura Himezen which AMAZING   going buy own bottle weekend     I love place   definitely plan coming back next time Vegas maybe try more sushi    Great groups large booths sushi bar seating  <EOR> This excerpted longer blog post experience Grand Opening weekend  read full thing complete pictures check blog!
