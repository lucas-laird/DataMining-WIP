I only speculate Tony's authentic Mexican Cuisine Which sounds funny because Tony think Italian know old joke    NY     Anyhoot  far south yet  Tony's Taqueria Gringos guess? All stuff menu photographed translated into English  food flavorful relies food opposed being overpowered excess oil spices    every table variety 3 different hot sauces waitstaff extremely nice pretty fast  Overall am exactly sure wanna come all over hit Mexican joint but if you're area most definitely worth trip  <EOR>
