Having just read Christine's review thought I'd throw two cents   wife food Grand China very much once every two weeks   However true restaurant often sparsely populated   suspect due three things   First looks business large part carry out delivery   Second number other Chinese restaurants down Rainbow competition must pretty fierce   Finally current rough economic situation may playing part well   Christine indicated waiter did seem particularly happy see party   However experience there   true though Chinese folks known being demonstrably affectionate   Perhaps Christine's experience might arisen cultural misunderstanding   terms food experience Grand China restaurant moderately sized dining room which appears seat 50   Oddly placed partition front restaurant can't really see dining room street   don't know purpose might other maybe keep people picking carry out discomfiting dine in guests   Regardless little weird   taste food Grand China clearly cut above you'd find most Chinese places town   especially potstickers which large generous   also lightly perfectly fried Rangoon style cream cheese wontons   Another great item Moo Shu Pork   Oh way here's local's tip Grand China runs lot coupons local paper Review Journal   Thus if look Southwest View section Tuesdays Taste section Wednesdays Neon section towards back Fridays may find couple fairly decent coupons free soup half off entree place  <EOR>
