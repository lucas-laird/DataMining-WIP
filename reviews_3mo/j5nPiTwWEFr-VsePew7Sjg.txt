I've couple times already definitely tell those joints only locals   No tourists would venturing over here   All much better!    When looking bar all special menu items posted wall quite difficult when deciding order   when doubt let expert it   I fondly remember fried smelt less $3 three fish    plump babies loaded 'cuz eggs still sitting inside them   little bit salt some fresh lemon juice yum yum!  doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver melts your mouth   ahhhh   I love ankimo!  tried bunch other things red snapper carpaccio ikura ramen noodles beef tataki w lemon juice fresh oysters half shell w ponzu sauce 2 $4 25 seaweed salad beef cubes   don't remember anything bad place but just good food good company   The first time those fancy Japanese toilets all those buttons try out   attempted use but no luck   last visit special toilet no longer there!  = guess many people having way much fun into retirement     If possible large group sit back where take your shoes off swing your feet under table   way also order lot more random things share them everyone   all much merrier   Overall pretty extensive menu   I think want some fried smelt roe just now!  Bring it!  Updated 10 10 06 also offer FREE membership card   5% off whenever dine when bring card eventually adds 10 15% off your bill next time   I also getting Agedashi Tofu soup   light delicate without being overly infused bonito flakes   Yum yum!  The salmon skin salad okay   dressing overpowers salmon skin can't taste whole lot   wouldn't bother getting again     The deep fried crabs plate baby crabs aioli type dipping sauce   interesting taste nice crunch!   Side note give wet towelette thing your napkin entire meal   Don't bother looking around regular paper napkins here!  Updated 11 27 06 recently tried okra natto less $3    First off idea natto grosses out   texture alone nasty smell   geez  whole other subject   Since dining partner's first time w stuff suggested he give some cheap price   comes thin slices fresh okra seaweed slivers hot mustard side   Overall would recommend unless you're fan stuff   definitely am one  Blah     Also last two times lovely ankimo!  Argh!  Updated 01 24 07 changed ratings four stars five because find myself craving fried smelt roe more often not   Ichiza apparently become comfort restaurant turn when can't decide where else go   only other izakaya Musha Torrance CA   place special?
