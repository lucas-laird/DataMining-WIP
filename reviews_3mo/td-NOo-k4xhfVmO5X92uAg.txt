I ate few days ago upon recommendation friend  surprise food unbelievable fresh! several items menu because couldn't decide all very good  also very inexpensive restaurant too  great little find  think only open 3 weeks but only matter time before rest city catches little gem  highly recommend all foodies there!  Fresh noodles galore!!!! <EOR> The wonton noodle soup very good   other reviews right food tastes fresh yummy   some minor communication issues waitress but rest staff quick come help whatever needed  <EOR> Another favorite Chinese noodle joint eat town since long gone forgotten Shanghai Noon owned HK actor Samo Hung  walked right time nightly noodle making stretching  place reminds masters over Malan Noodles SoCal all over Beijing  mentioned another review English bit challenge here  those interested noodles also offer selection Westernized Chinese dishes including fried rice chow mein  But why bother should known noodles namesake   One thing certain flavors more Malan which find slightly bland  noodles tender chewy  perusing menu owner's husband recommended following Special Flavor Beef Noodle Soup $6 95   Served slices marinated beef wood ear fungus   soup base made beef stock secret blend 28 spices and thought Colonel used more spices Star Anise dominant spice  wonderful medley flavors tingling palate  Special Flavor Tomato Egg Noodle Soup $6 95   soup base reminds mother's tomato egg dish slightly sweet zest tomato flavor sprinkling eggs  Vegetable Dumplings pan fried $4 95   Perfect vegetarian someone doesn't want any meat dumplings  Instead traditional dumplings fried individually chef made into flower shape separate into individual pieces  neat way present dumplings!   Sure place wrong side town me  But certainly worth trek    Flavorful broth  Check   Fresh tender chewy noodles  Check   Happy stomach  Check    Solid 4 5 Stars <EOR> The restaurant cute clean primary lighting paper  lanterns ceiling which cast everything w red glow  friend said red hurt eyes but didn't bother me  expected standard Chinese menu paper maybe even something laminated but cute bound menus printed pretty paper  Lol impressed littlest things  prices really reasonable good selection most which prepared vegetarian    We started pork won tons red chili oil pork chive dumplings  Pork won tons cute little bite sized things think 10 order 8 mentioned menu  Served sauce light sweet soy sauce put rice noodles dim sum chili oil added  sweet spicy perfect pork won tons  Dumplings basically potstickers loved presentation filling mainly pork  Served same sweet soy sauce side  dumplings little delayed coming owner apologized saying could only order time the table next ordered first   Does mean only 1 pan?  The 3 shared Shanxi knife bevel w beef homemade chow fun noodles w beef wood ear fungus slightly sweet brown sauce  Noodles perfect little chewy but wasn't fan sauce  Beef broccoli doesn't usually need description but served darker brown sauce even sweeter  No clue if Beijing style cooking typically sweet side  just more expecting usual Chinese gravy everything seems come with  miss delicious generic gravy    My friend ordered noodle soup chicken nuggets just taste hers  Broth amazing complex flavors noodles somewhat soggy chicken nuggets really dark chunks soy sauce chicken looked beef   wouldn't chicken again but maybe try beef noodle soup next time    The chef offered dessert tapioca chilled coconut milk  nice light end meal he said friends only  Awww we're friends! <EOR> This place clean servers friendly food good prices fair  I good experience here  would recommend cut noodles very good also won ton noodles delicate flavor good too  uploaded some photos experience  please give place try     taking coworkers  <EOR> I buddy tell BEST chinese food Las Vegas excited give run   I snuck preYelp tried General Tso's chicken $5 95 lunch menu   time thought fare compared other General dishes eaten valley   I thought would wait write review visiting second time trying noodle dishes   Judd L  writes great review decor bit history where place came from   Today came greeted extremely sweet lady owner    She gave run down various noodle dishes size noodles many different ways could eat them    I settled recommendation noodle soup containing beef nuggets cost  $6 95   In addition meal also ordered some pork chive potstickers appetizer   The potstickers arrived unlike any potsticker ever seen tasted   all stuck together circular shape   shell delicate sweet taste it   mixture inside divine overly cooked   My soup arrived shortly that   The soup hearty beef stock infused chili oil   some kind cabbage mushrooms well  nuggets actually small tender pieces beef   noodles absolutely amazing   I am throw five star rating   Some asked does place five star rating?  explanation want feel something stimulates production dopamine adrenaline body   After consuming tasty lunch think actually caught buzz nutrients whatever else meal!

I am now carrying menu wallet looking forward checking off noodle dishes one  <EOR> I came Beijing Noodle saw decent reviews Yelp best friend newly vegetarian said she really liked it   I called Sunday night didn't answer  just wanted sure open before made drive   I arrive cousin small restaurant odd red tinge lighting  Oh yes! open duh   I am greeted most awkward duo servers  both ask many wasn't seated until fourth time no big deal but start think possible language barrier WHICH AWESOME!  There menu small cute cheap   I hate when menus restaurants overly huge    It consists different types noodles also your typical fair Chinese food   I particularly wanted noodles!   There no descriptions dishes except title good luck   Also server needed help owner think he owner when taking orders problem   Just note   After canned sodas    We start pork dumplings chili oil  say bit disappointed  sauce spicy  JUST chili oil think dish would more successful  just 4 99  Still good   For dish ordered Beijing Noodles black bean sauce  Since no item description just title  no idea type other ingredients I'd getting but noodles sauce   Also order sweet sour pork Chinese fried rice   My noodles arrive FAST restaurant but piping hot    I look see meat dish serving just over 6 bucks big enough share   The dish includes noodles Chinese pickles horse radish ginger marinated beef chunks  really good! could taste all single ingredients each bite different tasty depending ingredient got  Also noodles definitely star dish other ingredients cut small   I won't say much sweet sour pork fried rice except really good you'd except Chinese restaurant  Chinese sausage fried rice being exceptionally good nice sized pieces Chinese sausage opposed little sprinkles it  sweet sour sauce definitely home made more gentle taste those overly sweet versions dish   For two sodas appetizer dumplings noodle dish fried rice chicken entree meal $30 00 even   It really good price offering definitely going back    Just some notes The place big but very limited seating  Four five booths line side restaurant few tables opposing side  sure place gets busy during peak hours   Also only non Chinese group which awesome because everyone seemed really happy   Our waitress selves may language barrier but service very sweet sincere effective also genuinely wanted enjoy meal   Lunch specials believe range 6 dollars  includes entree soup salad choice rice  Definitely going try lunch! <EOR> Its highly unlikely you'll find fresh hand pulled noodles complete show outside Las Vegas Strip your nearby Panda Express matter  combined Beijing Noodle Cafe's prices can't beat  Sure typical anglicized Chinese food suspects well but obviously shine through noodle dishes boy hit mark    Beijing's environment clean but decoratively could maybe use some music little sprucing but gives damn better noodle joints town  clearly taste feel difference texture take your first bite  chow fun Thai pad see ew dish which real good  only complaint wish server didn't take away before chance lick bowl    I always hope family run places Big Wong's Westside remain hit provide such high quality delicious food @ incredibly reasonable prices amidst faltering economy  <EOR> This place reminds noodle house Caesars Palace everything order which great   I expecting Chinese cuisine but cater American palate but still good  <EOR> Fantastic noodles!

I hope more folks try it   owners couldn't more charming accommodating    Loved watch noodle pulling last night   I'd only lunch previously     They new menu now  lots dishes cut   but things seem focusing flavors brighter tastier  <EOR> Hand pulled noodles   enough said!  No seriously   they star Beijing Noodle Cafe would crime if didn't order them   My trusty Yelp app reminded neighborhood only did recently read restaurant local paper but Paul Y  raving place Husband     As soon checked realized fellow yelper Andy T  just he quickly sent message telling order!    Located strip mall hole wall mom pop restaurant quaint simply decorated pictures menu items hanging red lanterns   course very clean fish tank something can't miss when walk in   We given lunch menu side featured lunch specials but other side where specialty noodles offered   shared * Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup $6 95 Hand pulled noodles very light aromatic broth wood ear mushrooms sliced beef   very flavorful quite impressed   * Szechuan Eggplant Noodles $6 95 Hand pulled noodles stir fry eggplant tomatoes garlic sitting top   Again very good quite rich     Although both dishes same noodles showcased quite differently broth versus sauce   Once eat freshly made noodle hard want anything else   While waited order inquired when demonstration noodle pulling takes place   waiter told chef but usually during evenings   chef came few minutes later he started making noodles   quite impressive definitely entertaining   point female owner explained more different sizes noodles offered small medium large although she recommends medium hand cut noodles into water well  If you've seen Bizarre Foods know talking here! She also mentioned appetizer dumplings being made order   initially thought weren't offered lunch because wasn't lunch menu given per another yelper's review   contrary available!

Soon hope   Anyway still going once twice week   can't enough hand pulled asian noodles   Now expanded menu which mean only thing     MORE NOODLE DISHES!!!!!  Try noodle soup 28 spices including ginseng  Amazing   And sure ask house made chili oil   none red crap bottle here!
