Because price doubles ! French onion soup good but hard eat bowl serve bread service nice touch when asked difference prime rib steakhouse reg menu server said better cut meat ! which u wonder regularly served ? prime rib juicy tender but really no different reg menu although veggies wonderful! nice mix asparagus spinach zucchini ! stand meal ! Dessert chocolate mousse fresh berries served same soup bowl ! Lol but none strawberries stemmed which kind defeats purpose having fancy presentation when u spit stems Becuz no knife presented dessert ! service most servers regular restaurant definetly seem lost higher end environment most seem clueless menu presentations special dishes ! bussers  most part vigilant kept tables clean water filled but really clueless higher end service when asked question said server would soon ! Maybe give them job wiping wine glasses first lipstick water stain both ? But nice pour price 7$ ? All all slightly above average experience but definetly worth doubling price food prepared same kitchen servers regular restaurant walk in thru service doors usual most don't look working ! Maybe future when menu Items definite departure regular fare service fine tuned nice alternative hotel ! But save your money less fancier versions next store !! <EOR> Located Silver Seven hotel casino   Formerly Terrible's   Last year cabbie said cheap plenty food locals ate there   made mental note but never chance     This year decided give try lunch but couldn't find it  Come realize name change Silver Seven   drove over    Parked garage     The cafe located second floor   Same entrance buffet   Buffet left cafe right     We seated asked immediately wanted drink   looked over menu   ordered prime rib dip sandwich   want it?
