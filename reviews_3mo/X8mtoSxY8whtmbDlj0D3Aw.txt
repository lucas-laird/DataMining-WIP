I'm sure where start  place reminds college days food kind gross but ratio between good food cheap price enough still frequent place   The buffet standard choices general's chicken mystery meat fried rice lo mein  general chicken grilled chicken relatively yummy   Also enjoyable egg foo young but fake crab it  bright red kind  Kind odd  didn't try mystery meat which might pork beef   But also buffet surprisingly good pot stickers the main thing ate   sweet sour soup taste couldn't identify which kind put off  eggrolls springrolls both kind blah   Also offered seafood choices which stayed away from  friends ate some cute little baby octopuses ahn! but mucho bad experience sushi Gold Coast buffet usually don't touch seafood buffets  friends however enjoyed seafood seemed fine next day  sushi looked very iffy though   The dessert bar nice offered lots different types fresh fruit   During week lunch buffet $6 55 dinner buffet $8 75  also full regular menu  lot vegetarian options buffet but plenty regular menu  <EOR>
