Anyone ever read reviews able tell love good steak live cheese adore good wine enjoy nice stiff cocktail time time  being case Alan Albert's falls into Stephy play quite nicely   It's feel old school steakhouse don't know but when Vegas explore history least dabble feelings days old there  Sure all modern hoorahrah great but place history Alan Albert's still feel bit it   The waiters dressed steakhouse waiters should nice white jackets know meats  also great sense humors since imagine living Vegas you'd to  trips last year  old Irish man rapped specials since clearly exuded 50 cent vibe what? Yeah random but love place   The food awesome  Steaks course signature dish but seafood fare fantastic well  Lobstas baby! if ask if lobster bisque  Sometime sometimes don't but G D Damn some good stuff! Use bread clean plate mmmm mmmmm! Also any old school steakhouse sides la carte sure try creamed spinach if spinach thing ever let's definitely asparagus hollandaise sauce kicks ass!  Wine list also pretty good but martoonis fantastic know dirrty without tasting stuck over saturated olive garden   So check out  cheap but definitely nice meal cool place great service no say You're money here  Also kind hidden  If taking cab cab driver should know but just know Las Vegas Blvd but kind towards back between two buildings  You'll see Enjoy! <EOR>
