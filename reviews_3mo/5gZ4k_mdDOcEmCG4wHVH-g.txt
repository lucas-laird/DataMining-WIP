I am writing review regards place is  essentially nicest golf course community kitchen restaurant ever experienced  clubhouse very nice staff amazing although never actually dined clubhouse just ordered delivery  currently live Rhodes Ranch all battles HOA aside place typically outdoes itself most items menu    I've only ordered them twice  But     Delivery FREE residents Rhodes Ranch deliver all day until 10 pm   and here's kicker golf course cart girls deliveries if never seen them let just say easy eyes   The first time ordered Philly  decent but amazing just because failed properly slice steak little tough  The second time Patty melt  would definitely order again  Fresh toasted rye patty perfect came side shoestring style fries  $8 99 $8 49 But place no ordinary club house sandwich kitchen  sampled entrees ordered roommates build your own pizza chicken parmesan   You even bucket steamed little neck clams  You steak eggs glass OJ coffee delivered your door first thing morning $14  The food priced neighborhood applebee's but far exceeding quality quantity  I'm saying 5 star dining but when consider Free delivery huge selection items coming golf course kitchen pretty amazing  never elite golf course lunch dinner when play courses usually stick dog beer turn  But if playing Rhodes extra time grab something 9 18  won't regret it  <EOR> Went Saturday afternoon groupon  played golf but never ate ate club house  Overall would say place good  sat right away ordered  pasta fagioli Italian beef sandwich  Both quite delicious Italian beef nice black peppery flavor  wife veggie wrap which she liked Mother in Law said Turkey wrap also good    Prices reasonable some nice views course  bad place eat if area  <EOR>
