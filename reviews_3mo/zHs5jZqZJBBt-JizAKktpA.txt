Amigos Tacos same strip mall Cracked Egg off Rainbow  They've open while finally decided check them out  feeling really hungry opted 3 carnitas tacos  price each $2 60  They're served larger 6 inch tortillas not really small street taco tortillas meat piled along onions cilantro tomatoes guacamole  guac wasn't fresh  looking little brown scraped lot off  expecting carnitas pulled pork look texture but just diced pieces pork  tasted ok but again tender succulent pulled pork hoping for  lot food price but many other taco shops around town doubt back  <EOR>
