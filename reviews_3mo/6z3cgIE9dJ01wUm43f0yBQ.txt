I driving down Spring Mountain way home decided stop Lee's quick milk tea when saw sign Fat Dumpling  never noticed place pop stopped quick order    They small dining area but fit sizable amount tables dine guests  All servers really friendly greeted quickly politely two when walked in  server told only open two days pleasantly surprised big crowd diners attracted    Their menu extensive  noticed soup dumplings excited but since doing takeout knew no go  Next time sure  ended pork cabbage dumplings taro slush boba  dumplings came first packaged well go  hoped some sauces something but just used some stuff home dip them in  taro slush wasn't amazing  little thick side sweet  favorite town but quite few flavors I'd interested trying some less conventional flavors    I tried some dumplings soon home good  Lots meat pretty flavorful  best ever but solid huge portion price  They're new spot give them benefit doubt look forward trying few more menu items future  <EOR> If love chinese dumplings love place delicious homemade dumplings must try <EOR> The dumplings saving grace  star each dumpling ate  Everything else pretty bad  First off ran plates  kind place runs plates?! waitress gave little plastic dipping cups instead     which doesn't help   Secondly don't think train staff very well because when asked napkins she gave 3 pieces   4 people party   mean give little more  No need skimp paper napkins    third which worst ran dumplings! ordered pork zucchini which came right away however she said still making pork cabbage  thought would maybe 15 20min wait    but ended sitting over hour  If she could've told very beginning could've chosen different flavor just skipped totally   The four ended cancelling pork cabbage ones since leave  Very disappointing  Lucky them dumplings reminded ones grandma use back home  skin hand rolled chewy just way it  dumpling stuffed brim porky goodness juices drip off skin once bite into it  Dip dumpling into some vinegar hot sauce perfect dumpling  also ordered some apps such chicken wings skip popcorn chicken good liang ban fen pi noodles long difficult mix non existent peanut sauce   Just stuff yourself dumpling goodness    TIP Wait few more weeks place work some kinks before might even able dumplings! <EOR> Dumplings dumplings dumplings!   Decided finally try place day CES  did order? dumplings course! ordered pork chives shrimp dumplings  which typically ones always eat  decided skip any appetizers due Jennifer's review  However did order some xiao long baos steamed pork soup dumplings because curious just see were   They gave some spicy salty peanuts while waited order along tea iced water  Then odd sound came through    and thinking she hand chopping pork?! Whoa whoa  sounds it  Anywho wait wasn't bad    maybe 15 minute wait food come out  dumplings came piping hot fresh! 16 them way  wrappers used dumplings did look typical thin store bought wrappers all! thick chewy just usually prefer them  does seem dough made scratch them    I just couldn't wait dip dumpling into some vinegar start munching! Juicy warm goodness mouth! flavors good  great balance between pork chives  bad shabby authentic bone  But wait vinegar little bit sour tastes  think prefer red vinegar when comes eating dumplings  also  when noticed boyfriend dripping juices everywhere  dumpling juices! Where plates? Where soup spoons? Awkward  end asking soup spoons but decided bother plates  eating them fast anyways   As xiao long bao's skip them please  small  bad  odd taste soup them did like  meat fine but soup no go    The service good though  teas ice water almost always filled  quite attentive  Though warning all servers mando and or canto speakers second language English  may heavy Chinese accent may thoroughly understand your question  sure if  something people turned off but just little warning  just gotta patient Great dumplings  Gotta dumpling menu!
