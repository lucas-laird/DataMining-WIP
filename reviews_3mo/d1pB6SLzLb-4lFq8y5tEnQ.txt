I never impressed Tofu Hut always wanted find decent Korean Tofu Stew soon dubu jigae place Las Vegas   think found one   Mr Tofu bad   Seafood Combo Tofu Soup which wasn't very spicy but really REALLY flavorful!  portion bigger Tofu Hut D J K    also Bibimbap stone pot which yummy too!  Mr  Tofu only few things menu but service really friendly    only gave 5 banchan but place definitely step above Tofu Hut!  definitely again seafood tofu try handmade noodles  <EOR>
