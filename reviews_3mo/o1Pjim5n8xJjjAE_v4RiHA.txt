I heard Moe's really good however thrilled experience  Just give idea Moe's pretty similar Chipotle but southern twist it  food good but expecting bit more food chain  service pretty weak most employees did know doing yet! offer nachos they huge quesadillas burritos tostadas tacos  liked fact lot toppings choose which free charge course sour cream guacamole  usually extra   Oh did mentioned Coca Cola lifestyle!! Yeee! Overall decent lunch dinner spot if looking something quick! give them another try hopefully training curve over! <EOR> So South Carolina where many Moe's restaurants  almost year living Vegas desperately missed Welcome Moe's when walk door taste yummy quest dip  glad now anytime want Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> Very very very slow service  Staff friendly  couldn't take credit debit cards  Buying gift card huge ordeal  pleasant experience all  mention getting into Downtown Summerlin nightmare  way out  Stop sign entrance backs everything onto main road  <EOR> Very slow service they're disorganized food line  nachos cold soggy chewy time actually taste them  <EOR> I've always eaten Moe's whenever visit East coast excited when found opened Vegas  Moe's earns good solid 2 5*s but bumped 3 because two things burrito bowls easily customize low carb leave rice beans two good small salsa bar spice things up!   This Moe's location big inside lots easy parking you don't park mall's garage which nice   interior new clean spacious  employees friendly welcoming seemed happy help newbies decipher menu    Bonus points having those amazing customize your own Coke machines 500 drink options   also Southern style sweet brewed iced tea   Moe's lot Chipotle where down assembly line tell employees behind counter want add your burrito  love being able customize meal  Moe's doesn't any seafood options but grilled tofu a big plus vegan friends     I visited Tuesday night around 7 pm place mostly empty  No lines no crowds all  ordered burrito bowl low carb no rice beans  opted grilled chicken breast added extra meat the steak   VERY disappointed portion sizes meat  amount puny first thought forgot extra meat  eaten Moe's many times even less normal amount meat other locations  aware screw amount meat here    Yes Moe's expensive get  left hungry added side chips queso the cup queso small should embarrassed charge charge 5 bites cheese paid extra extra meat  chips bad don't waste your money    I think expense relation portion size would eat regularly  know location just opened maybe employees need training amount meat serve  just seemed stingy meat portions  least guy loaded pico cheese! Overall happy another quick service Mexican style option town  <EOR> I absolutely loved place!!!! Great service friendly staff most importantly  food fresh!!! loved cheese deep chips! daughter  coming lot even if don't reason shopping mall <EOR> I start review letting everyone know excited am Moe's opened Las Vegas! east coast where quite few Moe's! used eat faithfully  when found particular opening thrilled    I ordering lunch every single Saturday since opened! once disappointed food  love many options pick nachos bowls burritos salads quesadillas tacos even something called stack! always end ordering vegetable band camp burrito bowl  funky names each option    In amazing band camp bowl always extra rice lots grilled green peppers onions corn lettuce cheese sour cream guacamole pickled fresh jalapeños A+ having both! famous queso dip side! tried sample black pinto beans! think next time order veggie bowl add pinto beans something different!
