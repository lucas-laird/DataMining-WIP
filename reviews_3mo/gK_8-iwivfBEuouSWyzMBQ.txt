Wing Heaven located Durango Farm El Capitan right next door Retro Bakery  pretty excited place open   wings seafood! wife doesn't eat seafood perfect us  few things choose from  Traditional boneless wings chicken strips gizzards few seafood options   catfish tilapia cod butterfly shrimp  Then bunch side items fries wedges fried pickles some other goodies  menu seems pretty basic first but let use seasonings pretty much everything there's ton options  mention quite few wing sauces   We lemon pepper wings honey heaven wings old bay catfish some sides   fried pickles bacon cheddar wedges  wings cooked pretty dang close perfect nice crispy texture outside  honey heaven which came suggestion owner killer! kinda sweet tangy but little kick it  catfish also really good heavy seasoning fried nice golden brown  Sides awesome  Real bacon wedges! Fried pickles decent batter all soggy! Kool Aid! What's love?!  Kinda teetering 4 5 stars place  take only don't come prepared sit eat  Even though live close hot food bag made catfish little soggy which all honesty only flaw food me  Everything tasty excellent customer service super friendly staff prices more then reasonable  dug it!

Great service foo amazing! tasted better WingStop honestly! best part even koolaid! <EOR> I tried Caribbean jerk ok honey BBQ above average garlic parmesan great flavor but little dry service friendly food came fast but price should amazing  would same price gone down road Buffalo Wild Wings somebody would served me  Also no sides included ranch carrot celery which would expected price maybe supply if ask falsely assumed would throw in  try again but might wait coupons deal <EOR> Well always believe second chances did write review until trying place twice  First all wings just OK  Nothing special would way eat here   The menu Impressive very clean place    However first visit owner manager very cold seemed care less business    The second time decided call order  same owner manager answered phone tone if annoying them calling  When told wanted place order he said HOLD ON!  Well didn't hold did give them money second time    There lot competition city treat your customers well appreciate business  <EOR> Honestly love supporting small businesses whenever open city Las Vegas but if please come your game correct!  Wing Heaven just letdown     The concept great wings fish other fried delights   But where Wing Heaven fails execution all   Just would expect newer establishment   just couldn't give place more stars if tried   If better when first opened then Wing Heaven should back straight narrow soon keep patrons coming good clip     Wing Heaven drive bit way   Entering place nice enough   No tables if plan eating just few stools flat screen TV two catch sports while wait your order   boy did WAIT   weekend night wasn't busy all store   other couple ordering time   1 weren't greeted owner anyone place matter   2 couple front ordered owner them proceeded shoot SH!+ each other least 10 minutes yes timed them    once did ANYONE greet tell would right us   bit annoying   3 When finally did register place order owner wasn't exactly friendly welcoming wifey place   Could just  demeanor but still want continued business please least FAKE smile show some effort   whiff food gonna speak itself figure would just give chance   We thought catfish but favor Mario's Westside that but ended going pound fried pollock because special   seasoning chose Garlic Vinegar   know Filipinos lovin' garlic vinegar salt pepper   real reason drove down Wing Heaven because wife loves fried gizzards only places heard serve them regular basis   pound those well   Paid proceeded wait while order being prepared   long 10 minutes     Owner finally warmed bit asked if liked cheesecake   He said he going treat try out   Yay some life guy   few minutes later given cheesecake bite sorts chocolate raspberry sauce top   OK   But expecting something bit more homemade   seemed those cheesecake bites your local warehouse store just covered batter fried   Good effort but wish more original   Glad offered though only reason gave Wing Heaven another star   Upon take order arriving lifted bag   really seemed LIGHT   ask behind counter Bro sure fish pound? Guy says yes   did WRONG thing just leaving Thanks checking order   The wifey finally drive back side town sit down enjoy meal immediately disappointed   pound fried fish seemed measly!  looks included weight all seasonings BEFORE frying!  sad   fish pieces small much fish order tiny bite size pieces   Just bad!  Lots batter bits much fish   only thing good Garlic Vinegar seasoning gave good tang lackluster fish   wish remembered take pics but upsetting totally disregarded it   But wifey vouch fish being just disappointment   came tiny condiment container cole slaw but wasn't tasty either   Needed more vinegar less mayo   Tartar sauce?  Nothing special   On fried gizzards which letdown well   Granted trip eating area wasn't very far wasn't expecting fried items hold greatest because just everything Wing Heaven packed since no real eating area house    But gizzards rubbery!  shoe leather rubbery!  mean two things gizzards overcooked gizzards frozen type product fresh made   No amount Louisiana hot sauce could really save gizzards being yummy   No bueno   About $15 total order since opted meal route since first time Wing Heaven wanted feel food   really hate say but looks won't back anytime soon   Maybe off day them maybe some kinks one cooks seemed training but just didn't connect place   know Wing Heaven specializes wings but just don't seem special compared other wing joints   Sorry guys   Disappointing   Heaven not  <EOR> I'm giving star  because wings actually DELICIOUS!   The reason bad review simple customer service sucked! guy register apparently having bad day    Lemme rephrase bad life! ATTITUDE start  asked big wings guy acted asking free sample! Then when asked mix match asked if could 4 wings separate sauce he snapped only 5's     if already knew   All all wings really good! Jerk Sauce honestly say very pleasing   Wing Heaven needs send employee learn some manners  If don't want deal people food service industry!   I hate write bad reviews but guy really made first experience wing heaven bad experience! least wings good  <EOR> First all let say customer service great  pushed 3 stars 4  felt Wayne other guy whos name forget but seemed boss? clicked just fine   The wait bit long maybe 20 minutes but thats real fresh food takes  Also asked if wings more crisp yes adds time    Had catfish perfectly cooked tartar slaw good outstanding  Chicken strips good anywhere easily good raising canes better  Spicy dipping sauce think also spicy ranch? Decent   And family order fries wings  Fries nice plump very good  bit soggy styrofoam may want consider serving them another way   The chicken wings 10 honey BBQ yum 20 scorching  told guys can't hot apparently took personal challenge LOL  Them bas**rds HOT! time ate them all scorching    Actually 19 wings them bit off missing most meet  graciously noticed offered free Kool Aid and eat offending wing Kool Aid sweet yummy  wings even before saucing well seasoned bit cajun rub   40 plus dollars before left exactly cheap but very very yummy! <EOR> Went today gizzard craving satisfied !!! best place some gizzards wings catfish!! perfect lunch!!!! Toney staff best!! don't understand other bad reviews customer service  encourage everyone try something new every time !!!! <EOR>
