I love trying exotic cuisine and tried all eager check Ethiopian off bucket list    Sadly biggest ripoff 5 years living Vegas    I beef onion jalapeno dish $18 much meat you'd expect find carne asada taco   The remaining 2 dishes $16 piece spicy mild curry type supposedly lamb dishes but no lamb meat whatsoever just bone parts fragments fat  keep spitting onto napkin  You'd find more lamb meat spoonful any lamb dish any Indian restaurant town did entire disgusting bowl curry which just tasted sauce can   They top off your dining experience giving cold flavorless nasty flat spongy bread dip dishes wasn't made fresh came fridge   imagine soggy tasteless flat sponge 50 degrees dip into much warmer sauce eat   giving someone pre made cold hot food cold lacks any culinary common sense    do Indian restaurants give naan  sitting fridge dip your curry  No   and fact moist spongy means thing wouldn't even adjust room temperature   it just remained cold mess   Another joke evening absence drink menu  just asked iced water   not here   $2 bottled watered $4 total wash down nasty meal   They could see unused soggy cold sponge all fat bones pick sauce weren't thrilled meal   that when added fun started  2 tacked 18% gratuity!!! Isn't against law? worst meal life came $65 tax going leave $5 because left hungry really upset given such high price   and weren't even allowed decide own tip   THEY decided much should enjoyed meal service   They new business didn't want slam new business early yelp but fact ate Wendy's hour later due still being hungry 18% added gratuity table 2 still left bitter taste aside food couple days later    Nothing Jolly here  <EOR> Planning dinning famous veggie combo month lent  Great service generous portion reasonable price  <EOR> We place last night    place looked NOTHING website nothing menu compare site   charge $16 95 awaze tibs compare Merkato its 9 00    meat fatty  yourself favor place  dirty well  <EOR> Found Groupon place decided check out  only Ethiopian place knew Merkato    Environment Low light small cozy  booths side almost private way  People aren't staring you    Service bad  more service compared Merkato 2 waitresses stopped few times see if liked food  main waitress younger lady didn't speak English all well would usually look other lady since she spoke more fluently  super nice but young waitress bit slow forgot water when asked    Food say bad all  ordered Sambusa Zil Zil Tibs meat combo ayib cheese  ran Sambusa asked if other appetizers good but don't think she understood  She ended brining mini Sambusa looked if chef made some mini ones real quick  good  injera isn't all great  Compared Merkato's doesn't hint sourdough flavor bit soft breaks easily  more bland which good but Merkato's better    Price compared Merkato very expensive  meat combo $18 Zil Zil Tibs $19 electric tea which basically hot Lipton bag tea $2 50 water bottle $1 50 maybe half cup ayib cheese $5 extra injera cost $5 whole bill ended being $54  didn't charge Sambusa saved few bucks    Hours no place states hours even website  When saw looks open 7 days week 11am 2am  <EOR> My rating based off food gf ate  4th time Ethiopian place place best tasting platters  ordered veggie meat sampling plates lot injera bread  also ordered extra order beef tibs? can't remember exact name but waitress said special DELICIOUS! Food very good quality looks soft opening    Yes bit expensive but used groupon paid $36 before tip but LOT food  Eating other Ethiopian places all seemed cost around same prices all expensive wasn't place especially costly   It located area bit questionable  best looking shopping center but don't let deter eating here <EOR> This place decent food but nothing amazing   don't think overpriced but think service food room improvement   enjoyed lamb dish teff bread   salad little skimpy   waitress spoke bad English   However only second time Ethiopian food   spicy beef dish homemade cottage cheese really couldn't recommend it   Nice vegetarian selections which would next time  <EOR> I consider myself foodie love ethnic food however meal unbalanced  Lamb dish tough fatty beef dish over top spicy  salad best part 2 tablespoons worth  thought teff bread interesting appreciate gluten free  Something missing all around  looks music weekends bar minimum selection spirits  Hopefully fill missing pieces  waitress does speak English well hard communicate  Groupon excited trying Ethiopian food however won't back  <EOR>
