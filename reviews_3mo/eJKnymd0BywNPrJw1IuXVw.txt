Pro tip Don't ask kind tequilas unless while  lots  <EOR> Nacho Daddy downtown 4th St really cute  Loved decor servers very nice if bit slow   ordered steak burrito red green enchilada sauce side  presentation nice but burrito just okay   enchilada sauces tasty though!! might back try something else always give places second chance  <EOR> Really expensive  Staff restaurant trained  take style Super low key <EOR> After couple days buffet casino food bf looking nearby spot lunch offered something little different  Thank Yelpers leading Nacho Daddy right off beaten Fremont Street Experience path   I'm kind wavering between 3 4 stars service lacking but food good    The place feels little divided bar bar dining other side wall more open brunchy feeling dining area  sat away bar but wish hadn't much livelier over there!  The menu offers tacos burritos chips guac    honestly didn't look over long because found wanted right away  split guacamole chicken street tacos pork burrito  Everything very tasty reasonably priced   Our server bit inattentive forgetting things taking awhile drinks etc  weren't big hurry though wasn't huge deal   Glad stopped by! <EOR> Decent food but any place two $ signs paper napkins just can't behind   much money want cloth   Sorry      I did enjoy mason jars attentive bartender   little pricy side but overall nice atmosphere   Wish them best luck appreciate them being downtown  <EOR> I couple weeks ago lunch  dined down town location  Cute name  Clearly marketing tourists bar opens street  Medium sized dining area  put off almost immediately when website lunch specials listed  However when waitress new nothing asked manager manager then came over explained lunch specials only Henderson location downtown  own mistake upon review website again when download menu states Henderson menu when scroll down very bottom then cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu does list lunch specials  Nonetheless left bad taste mouth    As food bit pricey opinion get  admit am nacho snob love nachos if am going splurge better darn good  traditional nachos piled high gooey cheese love nachos Big Dog's avant garde nachos such asian nachos Grand Luxe  nachos sounded good ordered cheeseburger nachos bbq pulled pork nachos  queso sauce smooth creamy pulled pork sweet although great bbq but didn't expect here   Cheeseburger nachos well cheeseburger lettuce tomatoes ground beef etc  approximately $10 each  good but again nothing phenomenal price whole lot there  full but any hungrier would been  am pretty sure other people group full  three plates nachos shared among four people    They those new help yourself Coke machines different flavors  Overall mixed feelings Coke machine  your own drink which am okay but if anyone standing drink machine may long wait ponder drink selection   Anyway cute idea but won't coming back  <EOR> The tacos wonderful   Great spicy salsa    nice find little off beaten path   <EOR> Great selection Mexican beer draught also impressive selection tequilas street tacos tasty keep going back more also bartenders super friendly personable   All all great place hang some great eats! <EOR>
