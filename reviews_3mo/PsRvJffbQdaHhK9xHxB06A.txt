I walked outside main entrance Stratosphere found diamond rough   Don't wrong nothing spectacular place but prices actually affordable which rare jewel tourist areas Las Vegas   stopped food twice trip once breakfast again pizza buffet glad found such affordable place close hotel   even stopped Subway Circus Circus couldn't believe wanted $10 footlong   place must budget minded traveler staying Stratosphere   omelet decent sized pizza buffet huge amounts salad pasta well   only wish Casino section establishment some low stakes table games well   would certainly preferred hand small operation money opposed big casinos  <EOR> INEXPENSIVE Pizza Salad Pasta Buffet!  SITREP  There NOTHING Spectacular location across street Stratosphere nor menu QUITE ordinary    though does sound stellar recommendation someone go out of their way come if close hungry stop definitely worth poppin for    SETUP  As guest Stratosphere first noticed Aztec Inn when walking Circle K and should review Circle K cause very cool saw $6 95 all eat Pizza Buffet    pay when pizza buffets Roundtable Mountain Mike's back Sacramento   THE MENU  This buffet much better *  big selection pizza slices including substantial amount veggies pesto based sauces *  big selection leafy greens lots different salad toppings options *  pasta bar couple different selections usually meat sauce then another marinara alfredo based sauce *  bottomless soda also great plus     Being casino also allowed many patrons take advantage FULL bar nearby which own separate cost but usually spirits beyond normal beer wine available most pizza establishments sometimes even beer wine    THE LOWDOWN  Sure very quaint all elegant but if you're trying mind your money don't want stuck putting $50 $70 buffet wristband strip anchor only handful food diversity options three days then little way places true gems enjoy  <EOR>
