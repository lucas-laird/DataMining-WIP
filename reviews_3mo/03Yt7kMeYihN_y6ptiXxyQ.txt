Whew! didn't sick!   Years ago became majorly sick Del Taco  Then few months different location sick again probably worse food poisoning had  Sad say handful food poisoning experiences but because food adventurous just hazard travel    I've avoided plague years  BF avoided well because 2 times he also sick    Leave kids cook your food right    specially when dealing chicken   I saw Yelp though when comes talking fast food kept popping up  know fast food nothing great but area very few late night choices Del Taco  curious if maybe better remembered?  We decided give try again    I some del carbon tacos chicken burrito  bad all  real chunks chicken instead cafeteria style chicken minced reconstituted into chicken strip fake grill marks which plus    I can't quite say fan yet but A OK    I'll leave them positive rating though poisoning though  <EOR>
