Tapas? Two favs together first time? thought blissful enough trek Summerlin taster well intrigue thai tapas course fab book club! Sadly bit disappointed     but maybe because expectations set high    The venue itself bit surprise    dark somewhat seductive decor lighting nice    but don't really spring mind when think thai tapas    Service extremely slow though servers themselves two servers kept trading responsibilities throughout night very nice    The food itself hit miss  Hits White Fish Cake the dipping sauce awesomeness mango coconut rice the bomb visit chef owner table end meal  Misses Papaya Salad especially tasting some other fantastic papaya salads Vegas offer Panko crusted avocado crab wanton oil factor control    tried several other tapas which MEH     To fair when resto only few months old    maybe kinks worked since dined there  hope because concept itself gets 1 star! <EOR> If any cuisine would say could considered reputable critic would Thai food   fiancé visit least once year lived short time couple years ago while doing scuba diving internship   taken coupe cooking classes  well wonderful teacher named Miss Ya   very fond couple dishes learned during first course spiciest dishes is    PAPAYA SALAD!  seems showing more more menus Vegas recently other Massaman Curry both almost every time eat Thai     After reading place Weekly then reading reviews wanting go   Two favs Thai Tapas YEA!  first impression few others mentioned decor little off   careful consideration decided should offer donate some Thai artwork perhaps exchange some food lol!   Anyway here's Papaya salad fiancé even commented being quite authentic Lemongrass soup pretty tasty but needed spice some more leftover papaya salad juice Massaman Curry both thought savory very good quality ingredients   Although could've spicier never asked level spiciness wanted anything  Spinach Salad save best last even though ate before curry   simply AMAZING!  If this!  SERIOUSLY missed!      Overall food all pretty darn good definitely call orders but atmosphere little funky however we'll see if can't help change       Oh yeah almost forgot LOVE fact serve fruit infused water nice touch! <EOR>
