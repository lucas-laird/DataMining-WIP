The crispy buffalo shrimp tangy   bite sized shrimp buffalo flavoring    The 007 California roll but big pieces shrimp avocado draped over rolls  enjoyed well!  Bacon scallop skewers mostly bacon tiny pieces scallops inside  different skewers available   would try bacon mushroom skewers next time    Chicken Katsu wraps good especially people husband don't eat sushi  He happy wrap cucumber salad    We ended meal some honey toast  reminded hawaiian rolls ice cream honey top   first time having dessert prepared sweetness overload!
