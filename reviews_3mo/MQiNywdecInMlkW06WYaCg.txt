We recommended Maru friend check out  wasn't very busy only few tables occupied dining room  taken table hostess then continued sit 15 minutes while servers kept busy all around us  25 minute mark sitting menus without even being offered water addressed server left  Regardless good food might level lack service completely unacceptable   Instead opted Swish excellent Shabu Shabu place around corner  If want take your chances ahead but NEVER back  <EOR>
