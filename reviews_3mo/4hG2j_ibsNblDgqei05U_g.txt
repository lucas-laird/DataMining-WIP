Yummy   your typical moment trendy sushi restaurant Vegas   said food quite good   tried some special rolls all fresh well presented   mochi dessert great loved seasonall pumpkin mochi   staff attentive helpful   Treasure Island really really impressed  <EOR> Great food drinks  Its weird though 3 waiters didn't communicate each other occassionally we'd waiting item would just forget    good spot though  <EOR> Maybe folks Midwest never tried sushi might place but am Midwest   place extremely disappointing   sushi tasted sitting days service atrocious ridiculously overpriced    staff completely inept never ceased try sell most expensive chef specials never asked drink orders unless literally grabbed them 3 times reminded them   plenty other great places eat Vegas  <EOR> this ultra hip ultra chic place located above tangerine nightclub ti   being greeted several host hostesses entrance you'll ascend couple  flights stairs an elevator available you'll notice all entire walls decorated gold colored deposit boxes youre vault something   once restaurant youll see isnt huge room but its long corridor little rooms jutting tables along corridor  also enjoy views pirate ship performance front ti even dine hang patio if wish   inside 2 sushi bars 2 bars yes eat bar    wood used floors tables all matching tea color   end restaurant where bars located center seating area big

give grand tour haute items social house   started off some tuna tataki ponzu sauce   mouth crazy taking thinly sliced piece seared kobe beef   piece meat thin drizzled garlic infused olive oil just

pork belly   atop japanese pumpkin mash which supposed even saltiness pork but think overpowered its sweetness   said the hell ate moist tender soy marinated pork belly   waiter specially made platter included most desserts menu mochi filled mochi chocolate molten cake toasted melting marshmellow pancakes over rice pudding uninteresting very very light cheescake guava sorbet tangerine sorbet favorite freshly made coffee ice cream kona blend   the fragrant aroma just lit nose also add meal without sake b c whole bottle momokawa pearl unfiltered sake  this place opens 5pm closes 4am weekends   its place kick back listen good music live djs eat really good food awesome drinks   currently hottest places dine vegas    <EOR> Tragically hip sushi joint semi attached TI's Tangerine nightclub which quite awful avoid all cost   decor modern trendy expected place trying market itself young beautiful  main room looks little bit crowded very loud but sitting smaller side rooms pleasant comfortable  The chef worked Nobu years while sushi just slightly above average nothing bad but also nothing write home sake selection appetizers large very tasty interesting   We sampled wide variety appetizers garlic oil seared fluke whitefish seviche scallop giant clam dynamite truly delicious  Well balanced flavors first grade ingredients great preparation  salads fresh tasty but nothing new awe inspiring  noodle dish arrived completely overcooked only far away al dente as described server but complete mush   The service laid back casual maybe bit casual times  While every staff member met very friendly enthusiastic food definitely seemed hired more looks professional experience  prepared meet some handsome charming food loving kids sometimes fly bit seat pants   All all very enjoyable place but am giving only three stars because botched dish varying quality creativity food slight lack professionalism service  price ought able expect more  <EOR> excellent atmosphere if youre late night type person  food very good service also A+  if sure try citrus miso black cod  its favorite item menu  <EOR> My pet peeve some shi shi restaurants snooty patooty hosts hostesses   party did feel welcomed all hostess said we'd pay $7 per plate surprise birthday cake tried bring in looked paupers   Once past Cruella DeVil ordered Lycheetini bar   Loved would've ordered more but wanted save room food   We escorted into elevator which took restaurant   impressed modern Asian decor   waiter bussers very attentive never sake glass empty   ordered special California roll freshwater eel roll adobo chicken roll   food good but atmosphere ambiance pay for   Based lumpia pancit adobo menu assume chef Filipino   staff asked if related chef   Didn't know all Filipinos related      The restaurant lives its name   Social House perfect place spend time friends enjoy some authentic sushi tipsy good sake   If would only rid snotty hostesses  <EOR>
