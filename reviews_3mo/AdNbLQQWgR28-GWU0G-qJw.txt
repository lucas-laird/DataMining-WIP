Kind happy place but some things it    At first being greeted being seated okay  usual greet seat routine any other Denny's there  wasn't busy all but fact took them long things rolling kind boggles me  three other staff standing around doing nothing while poor waitress running around trying things done  Now really don't blame waitress cause least she nice  But others just standing around making all work kind rude  course  review poor review  But give credit where credit due    I know Denny's certain sections wait staff cover  applaud waitress taking busiest trying sure everyone happy  While see another section booth set family while waitress 6 other booth cover  Now would nice share responsibilities then see other waitress snooty stare waitress while she's all over place  Even though when waitress break other waitress wouldn't even check see doing  she's only allowed cover booth section where there's 6 other booth doesn't waitress  kind place does where no cover section when its some ones break time but three others uniform  manager ever lady just stand other snooty waitress talk behind waitress back she's doing  say if want job done right then yourself cause right now unhappy customers wait staff isn't backing any ones section  way run business    As far food did Zesty nachos did Super Bird sandwich  But didn't fact weren't cooking something menu cause tend it  Some should said something inform waitress instead making come back another order still didn't have  third time around she came back saying didn't wife wants second Super Bird  right tells there's lack communication between cook waitress  fact cook did inform waitress cannot cooks fault  Then talk head manager ever waitress look bad front everyone totally uncalled for  If staff complaint another staff take where no else could see your upset face hand gestures     Now again applaud waitress doing more then she did day covered she covered  blame other staff lack help lack support lack communication  Knowing other section only booth cover while waitress 6 unappropriate    With being said waitstaff being snooty cook having lack communication skills cannot do  wouldn't really come back eat again if treat staff way treated waitress   Very unprofessional part  <EOR> This place pretty basic eating your casino cafe dining   prefer Coco's across street Texas Station only because least know won't ignored   staff usually friendly see try really hard most your meal even if order off 2 4 6 8 menu   never feel judge even when order real cheepo     The last time ordered something all fine until server said no longer item   Okay order something else heavily modified because lack ingredients   Again few minutes later she comes back says also that  It holiday themed meal holiday season now little miffed  order same thing husband ordered really knowing what's only knowing turkey  want     The food comes little spurts because now cook really confused says server   split first sandwich time second comes done   just greasy me   Later waiting while check just pay seeing if could print check front   able but wrong still having first ordered it   hostess begins fix time server comes proceed into argument because mix server doesn't want charge all hostess just going let fly     didn't  care way nice server try but wasn't completely void meal   Still eighteen dollars two sandwiches seems steep especially Denny's no less   okay trip little off but better before probably back  <EOR>
