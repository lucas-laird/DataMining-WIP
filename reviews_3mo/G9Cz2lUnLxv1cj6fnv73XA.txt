It wasn't difficult finding place because located near other restaurants Benihana TJ's Steakhouse   entrance really exciting! stacks shelves books feel you're library there's bar it  What's confusing no hosts but convenient sign inviting seat yourself open table I'm glad mentioned open would sat myself someone else's table   room hexagonal tables lining walls when walked most tables taken dirty previous diners  Awkward   Our server friendly but rocky start inquired 'foie gras terrine sweet apples' burger topping response was   annoying  duck   like slice duck apples  Well liver   and apples  brother informs nicely possible know foie gras is    say Yes want know prepared  She continues said slice apples   it's just topping so    UHH what???? Yeah happy that   My brother comp took advantage ordering several things limited menu  ordered Angus burger medium rare extra toppings avocado grilled red pepper  Ruben ordered Australian Lamb mint jelly  shared truffle thick fries garlic parmesan thick fries fried pickles  fried pickles bad  liked spears crunchy but much flavor tart department  fries called thick but really just normal cut fries  commend using Idaho potatoes cutting fries themselves however truffle flavoring gross  overpowering disgusting faux truffle oil nonsense  Couldn't stomach it  garlic parmesan flavoring good though actual garlic not sure where parmesan was   burger itself prepared nicely although asked medium rare received medium still succulent  No flavor though but guess  why offer nine different sauces  also really liked avocado grilled red pepper burger fresh onion lettuce tomato  Overall burger offered very little flavor nothing spectacular  portion large priced well though $10 before extras $11 lamb    The service just okay  She kind but really bad moments earlier foie gras incident  Then when wanted order plain fries she responded Oh think we're closed  think you're closed closed? Also why would inform your tables kitchen did last call food anyway? Then she check comes back few minutes later plate skinny thick fries  said thanks wholeheartedly but knew leftover whatever reason staff decided give us  Kind but weird  worst part some fries doused horrendous truffle oil! Could least warn gal? Oy  can't help but think reason LVH didn't much advertise new burger joint  worth it! <EOR> The Burger Bistro located inside Las Vegas Hotel Casino LVH short also formerly known Las Vegas Hilton  place itself isnt big  Wood panel walls paintings marble colums chandelier center  totally sure but believe place fairly new opened within past few months  seat yourself type sit down restaurant  Menu pretty simple straightforward  Prices seem reasonable  6 different burgers available choose from  Angus 10oz Lamb 8oz Tuna Crab Turkey Veggie  Then add variety toppings anywhere foie gras apples brie bacon  Some sides include fries shoestring regular natural parm garlic truffle fried pickles mac n cheese  According menu choice brioche wheat bun but server didn't ask all brioche  did appetizer same time burgers fries  angus burger quite hefty sized burger  also fried pickles all 3 fry incarnations onion rings  Nothing mind blowing but horrible either  satisfied size burger everything tasted ok  server nice enough bring 7 different sauces try burger fries  She friendly but service bit slower expected  seemed take awhile bus tables done  Some still cleaned off time left some those before arrived  I'd still give place solid 3 stars  Would probably back again try lamb tuna burgers  <EOR> It seems though every casino feature burger joint now whether tied celebrity chef not  Gordon Ramsay recently opened more popular ones Planet Hollywood long other chefs opened restaurants Mandalay Bay Mirage Harrah's name it  Some actually hold fairly well provide some pre designed burgers choose while others take lazy do it yourself route such case latest meal Burger Bistro LVH  Although burgers fairly easy thing even easier Vegas properties throw together half assed restaurant sell mediocre burgers insane prices really starting piss off  going hide anger disappointment anywhere article Burger Bistro's approach providing another burger joint just insulting scene town want execs LVH know it   After parking lot off Paradise wandering through casino sports book finally asked employee where hell restaurant since absolutely no signage any kind let know  Tucked corner few other restaurants path convention center Burger Bistro sits long abandoned restaurant space looks used something Italian complete faux marble columns awful pink lit vaulted ceilings lots wood paneling  There's also abandoned bar front could great place stop quick burger yet restaurant hasn't made use yet some reason  Another puzzling item display books behind sliding glass doors front sure if supposed some sort library theme? Basically saying LVH execs decided burgers hot massive amount bodies coming conventions let's just slap burger joint unused space charge way much money see goes  lazy menu gives choices few meats several toppings leave figure out  looks bad rip off Burger Bar menu   Being totally uninspired swiss bacon burger  shorter wait anticipated burgers showed food cart wheeled table given completely generic 24 7 café style burger  nothing wrong all but nothing stood great either  would great drunk 2am which unfortunately wasn't  pre made patty probably cooked griddle then thrown grill add grill marks no char flavor whatsoever  decent flavor overall cooked fairly consistent medium rare all way through but lacked any type seasoning  frozen tomatoes added nothing cheese barely noticeable standard breakfast bacon nothing special even cooked well  brioche bun really good grilled garlic butter but grilled poorly raw butter middle  Overall decent burger but something could found anywhere country any time   My skinny fries completely awful hard horrible oily flavor made them completely inedible  when typically order skinny fries expect something similar you're given In N Out McDonald's potato sticks  'fat' fries table pretty much you'd consider regular skinny fries just little seasoning good flavor them  weird sauce mixture ketchup A1 knows reminded some concoction sauces I'd kid condiments parent's cabinet   To round negativity way overpriced  Maybe would ok $10 if included fries but didn't  plain burger plus cheese $2 plus bacon $3 fries iced tea $3 75 !! never refilled came ridiculous $23 before tip  wouldn't spend much Burger Bar something far better which surely place they're trying rip off  burger trend might still happening but uncalled for  While provide somewhat decent burger fries awful service iffy prices insulting  meal pissed off more wrote can't recommend anyone unless folks LVH seriously consider remodeling space providing customer more thought menu reducing prices considerably  <EOR> Not impressed over priced burger place  boyfriend recently dined Easter Sunday  decided try since least expensive restaurant LVH which where staying   empty seated right away  waiting 15 minutes someone finally came over take drink order  Keep mind only 2 other parties eating well  ordered food drinks food came relatively quick  ordered tangy BBQ chicken wings thinking would come cooked BBQ sauce  wrong     just came plain side sauce side  sauce wasn't even BBQ actually honey ginger but ate anyways because knew waiter wouldn't back around while  finished waiter brought check charged boyfriend 2 beers when he only ordered one  course he fixed issue paid check left  food wasn't bad but definitely place would recommend  You're better off going deli getting something half price just good  <EOR> I've craving burger based menu all signage throughout Hilton seemed exactly looking for  When arrived greeted sign saying please wait seated group three ahead me  while hostess finally arrived told trio ahead would thirty minute wait  wasn't starving back room should recognized signs though   An hour later returned told it'd few minutes  Ten minutes later seated  restaurant only 3 4 full  There isn't lot menu easy decide wanted  ten more minutes yet see waiter  Finally hostess came around drink order  She brought Guiness no glass  Ten minutes later she swung tell it'd just minute longer  Meanwhile man seated placing order  Ten minutes later hostess came back apologized took  order  waited noticed number tables empty but hadn't cleared  obviously understaffed   After another ten minutes waitress stopped water me  Five minutes later meal and man seated but ordered 10 minutes ahead served food  course order wrong  ordered no tomato sautéed onions tomato no onions  Too hungry waiting ate it  okay  best burger ever long shot  When finished eating bill sautéed onions well piece chocolate cake  Twenty minutes food arrived couple ordered five minutes still received meal  still waiting when left  I honestly considered skipping bill service ambiance bad  Do yourself favor avoid place likely last all long  <EOR> I really enjoyed meal angus burger blue cheese grilled onions   burger seasoned well   whole wheat bun soft   nice side onions tomato slices lettuce   Plenty condiments table could dress burger just way wanted   I party nine   Seven angus burgers   No complaints   tuna burger   She's usually first complain but liked very much   lamb burger   He raved it   I hear folks saying skinny fries thick fries   skinny fries *are* shoestring   thick fries regular fries   frying oil dirty because dark   burger joint should excellent fries not!  Our server outgoing personable   He would seemed smart a** if bad mood   example he would reply No half time request beverage refill like   He teasing but might over some people     I thought pricing $10 basic burger plus $5 blue cheese grilled onions justified   really enjoyed burger   The decor inside restaurant doesn't really seem burger place   kind shi shi   feels upscale Italian place   need see jukebox photos 1950s cars but big columns ceiling faux painted resemble sunset  <EOR> We burgers nachos both just mediocre  expected much more way place looked prices  Service just ok drinks remained empty most meal  <EOR>
