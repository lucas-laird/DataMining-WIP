#greatservice #gordo=fat <EOR> Firstly let say support business name theme   great vibe small shop isn't afraid little bit personality     It's tucked into Container Park near Downtown East Fremont mean tucked almost hidden back corner   didn't see title outside which probably thanks its personality filled name   dig it   The service spot friendly fast   Everyone staff delivered full smiles plenty help gringo needed   ordered taco combo three tacos any choice rice beans   Asada   Al pastor   lenga   Both carne asada pastor great simple nice flavor satisfying   lenga bit disappointment but late evening did say running low   cut bit break   Overall though quick taco spot downtown think accomplishes its after   hey all name  <EOR> So Container Park super cute!  friend first time last night decided grab something eat Pinche's   love Mexican food pretty stoked it   I carnitas taco combo plate   happy all   love simplicity street tacos but means meat needs seasoned properly!  pork bland!  don't give enough salsa taste better   corn tortillas soaking wet couldn't even pick them eat them taco   looked real gringa using fork   beans also extremely under seasoned   I'll probably just BBQ place next door if ever over again   Sorry! <EOR> Delicious street tacos fresh ingredients lean meat flavorful salsa   Great place bring children <EOR> Tacos okay tortillas hand made  Salsa tasty but very hot  Rice orange sort bland  Beans good last but least horchata gross  <EOR> We tried Pinche plate guacamole side corn    All say wow food absolutely amazing mean amazing! just moved Las Vegas San Diego San Diego some BEST mexican food ever result being close border place feels lot home  feels good some non fakexican food new home! <EOR> My family really likes place  twice everything gotten tasty fresh  real deal  <EOR> I thousands thousands tacos Las Vegas      carne asada taco hands down best Las Vegas valley surrounding areas! steak seasoned grilled perfection  found myself talking them next day every time think Container Park   also LOVE Mexican Corn   corn HUGE served cream cheese lime chili  only corn served shopping cart streets Las Vegas Los Angeles  remember hoping corn guy would come around could some  ten times better shopping cart corn and pretty good   fact people walking kept asking where corn   boyfriend lengua torta loved it  He gets lengua all time tacos said really good   PROS Carne asada taco              Mexican Corn              Lengua torta              Sitting outside enjoying park while eating <EOR> Went pinches last night  carne asada good  eaten somewhere else already but husband wanted try tacos here  bite carne asada tacos wanted more  ordered carne asada burrito  Great combination ingredients tortillas taste amazing   Only disappointment when ordered potato cheese taquitos poured salsa all over top when asked guacamole instead  nice enough remake them I also tipped them extra remaking them but then all potato taquitos no cheese no sour cream guacamole  two potato taquitos container salsa  Really annoying even more wrong second time  really nice mistake thought I'd made myself pretty clear wanted  <EOR> Sad say thought just okay   three street tacos carnitas pork pescado fish asada steak neither any flavor  trying apese masses but tasted nothing   Even salsa surprised lack lust were  gave ok rating because faith changes  Also staff very friendly  give them second chance  <EOR> Such great night getting know new Container Park!
