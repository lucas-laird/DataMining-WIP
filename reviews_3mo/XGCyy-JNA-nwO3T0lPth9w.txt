This little taco spot sits next Herbs Rye parking lot auto shop   decided called Ricos Tacos simply because shows digital sign time time  Tortillas mano also flashes across but know means handmade tortillas am pretty sure  name   I stopped twice past year some tacos  rate visitation guess discern am super fan tacos  am more fan theory practice because location atmosphere but tacos middle road   They used tables but past weekend tables gone  atmosphere appealing  Call urban crazy but sitting parking lot actually appeals me    The ladies work super friendly  asked rather dumb question Quesotaco? avoid same any taco cheese  think also means two tortillas  costs  50 more  standard taco $1 50 which reasonable but mind blowing cheap   As tacos tortillas solid although corny might but meat quality flavor special  meat lacks grilled flavor really taco pop  do it yourself buffet style toppings borderline unsanitary  Something having them sitting hot air everyone touching them including possibly flies super appealing  Maybe should move them inside toppings you    Still sign says open until 2am tacos aren't bad  If bring back tables could see myself landing again just because    <EOR> Think hot dog stand New York    But parking lot instead  tacos   The area front  mess  No cleaned condiment area some time wasn't covered  know most Mexican restaurants sneeze guards but place doesn't nor covers    little bothering   The tacos TJ Style Tijuana Mexico flavor OK  nice able eat something since only TJ Style tacos located San Diego   If we're driving feel having some TJ style tacos I'd take visit  <EOR> After UYE @ Herbs Rye over talk tacos crew all ended going another destination but since lazy figured I'd check place 10 feet parked car   The place nothing more tiny shack big light screen top menus both sides windows english spanish    They don't ton variety but everything hand made tortillas hand made mine made order   The place wasn't really busy which concerned little but thought I'd give try   I ordered Carne Asada Taco Taco Al Pastor  little surprised when order all plate 2 tortillas some meat them no lettuce no cheese nothing   They small toppings bar next window 2 salsas guac sauce limes cabbage jalapenos but really fan any them   I squeezed some lime meaty tortillas gave them try   The Taco Al Pastor pretty solid pork cooked seasoned well but nothing special   The Carne Asada Taco rather disappointing beef chewy barely seasoned   The tortillas fresh tasted pretty good but admit $1 75 each expecting more meat tortilla   The only things saving place 1 star review fact ladies friendly food came quick al pastor decent   It pinch but 3 other taco places within block I'd say check them first   Oh no tables chairs anywhere sit sit car eat tacos <EOR>
