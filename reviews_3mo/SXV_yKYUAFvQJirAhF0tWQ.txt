We looking another Greek Mediterranean restaurant but GPS took into area  When found wasn't place decided eat instead  starving noticed 50% off appetizers during happy hour right time happy hour    The restaurant itself decorated gaudy style murals Acropolis other Greek style architecture walls ceilings  full sized bar which during HH all drinks discounted even non alcoholic ones   We hadn't looked yelp prior visiting obviously but meal managed look reviews other reviewers spot regarding book menu  listings really confused Japanese Italian offerings well  namely sashimi pasta   We stuck appetizer menu which consists cold appetizers hot appetizers  taking 3 pages   Taramosalata  wasn't bad but taste caviar did come through  Melanzanasalata  something  eggplant dip  nice tart finish  Spanokopita  FAIL! Trader Joe's version far better  obvious originally baked then when someone orders popped into deep fryer heat up  Totally disgusting!!  Falafel  grainy but rather mushy very dense! didn't much  Dolmas  version meat rice inside instead just rice  also creamy ish white sauce which didn't enhance all  Pass!  Greek pizza  pretty awful even young man didn't want eat it  took back hotel but no even attempted eat ended throwing away    Greek cheese olive plate  winner  liked lot  Two types cheeses offered along Kalamata olives   Did think food good? particularly  But some items weren't bad rest just plain awful  If pay full price I'd definitely tell pass! worth it  However 50% off bill actually quite reasonable ate  even able overlook some grosser items  Hubby two drinks alcoholic Greek cherry juice  iced tea  bill? $40  Now double you're looking $80  $80 I'd say totally awful meal  $40? easier swallow!  2 5 stars  <EOR>
