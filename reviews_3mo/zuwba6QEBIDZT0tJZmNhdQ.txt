Who would thought looking open sushi joint 2 afternoon would chore   being turned down two japanese restaurants opened later afternoon friends decided try luck elsewhere   drove couple strip malls which vaguely advertised sushi joint displaying sushi directory along requisite massage parlor   continued driving around bit until actually saw sushi bar name   Kobe Sushi Bar words displayed sports bar kinda font   Alright we'll give shot   The interior looks lot better store front strip mall look   tables chair black modern feel   sushi bar back display board wall listing all Kobe's specialty rolls prices   Whoever wrote specials made 1's look 4's thought first all rolls costed $45 instead $15   The menu lunch special which consists teriyaki bowls pan fried hot soup noodles three combination bento boxes chicken beef salmon korean bbq ribs sushi combo   Also separate sushi list which mark off order   The sashimi decent   saba mackarel ok   hamachi pretty good white tuna really good   rolls also pretty good   spicy tuna roll more tuna outside nice spicy kick it   For appetizers yakitori which ok tempura combo came shrimp calamari vegetables soft shell crab   **Soft Shell Crab Review** As always must try soft shell crab any new sushi joint  I give Kobe's thumbs down   crab looked really dinky battered   No dipping sauce crab except tempura sauce already had   We also ordered chicken bento box   came miso soup salad california roll   chicken looked preprocessed because pieces looked darned symmetrical   All all meal decent   Some sake beer food made experience pretty good time  <EOR> Why must succumb standard sushi land plenty?  With all buffets other restaurants Vegas settled place sheer desperation famine   should've continued starve until better places opened   Oh well lesson learned   Sushi potential okay   The bento box appetizers bland best   They offer all eat 5 pm which good option since specialty rolls overpriced   Overall isn't worst fake Japanese place eaten  <EOR>
