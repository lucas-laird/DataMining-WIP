This kind bar alcoholics to  mean there's anything wrong just don't typically end night spilling beers lap saw some patrons doing here  There's always nice cars parked lot but don't know driving them   The food pretty gnarly but mean bar food  really salty   If want drinks any haste I'd recommend going bar order them  sat booth bartender making point ignore otherwise tick off waiter   It's small place million crappy sports bars Vegas   Also inexplicably playing Dancer Dark three TVs  WTF?  saddest movies all time  stars Bjork  Really? sports bar? <EOR>
