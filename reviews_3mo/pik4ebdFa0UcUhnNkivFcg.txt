This far some best Italian food ever ate  Please confuse Carmine's pizza spot in  Vegas 2 different places  Everything family sized  waiter told try rigatoni broccoli along calamari appetizer portions big only 2 use enough feed 4 people   staff very friendly inviting  Prices bit high but when your eating good counts  recommend anyone looking eat some really good southern Italian food  <EOR> As local place worth trip down Strip  Great food service  Don't let high prices scare away  Each dish serves 4 6 people making good value  Give try  <EOR> The idea fun atmosphere very Maggiano's kinda homey italian feel     pasta portion size big   pasta dish around $30 serves 4 since party 5 waiter recommended salad past   Knowing going need some left over decided two pasta dishes   ragu three types meat other vegetarian one   honest if pasta salty may deserve 3 4 star   But oh god no idea put ridiculous amount salt pasta but drinking cup water every bite pasta     I definitely recommend place considering salty pasta is   worth it  <EOR> Best Italian around   New York Atlantic City NJ all consistent all delicious   cheap Italian chain   Chefs all locations same exact recipes high quality only   Best meatballs world   Family style big plates big portions GREAT bring leftovers home   hungry and or group  Though only two sometimes but know order just enough!

Couldn't just order caponata though would other cold antipasto items don't eat  much made order   Couldn't baked clams since cheese them premade? am allergic cheese    Clams ok more onion focaccia dunking broth   Shrimp ok  Maybe 15 average size shrimp  rubbery  Brought wrong pasta dish clams instead calamari  Replaced reasonable time     Food wasn't bad could just wasn't special  Took much effort find dishes three people wanted share rather lot dishes which could all taste   Also restaurant needs smaller tables   originally shown table six ! but convinced hostess booth 2 ? would more comfortable conducive conversation   Everything large portions pasta bought supermarket $ 99 lb   Only thing large portion glass wine   served wine glass but small drinking glass   Family style trendy late 1980's   Now people would small taste lot dishes rather find few upon which everyone agrees   More isn't better just more  <EOR> How's food?  Couldn't tell because never came kitchen   stopped July some appetizers   came 9 00 PM place busy   being seated waiter pretty much forgot because 30 minutes before someone else came take drink orders   ordered food same time just ordering original waiter came back table take over   told both waiters wanted portabello mushroom appetizer they two mushroom appetizers other stuffed caps    both away original waiter came back again confirm which mushroom appetizer wanted   repeated portabella   30 minutes later hour now comes someone else mushroom caps ordered   told those weren't right he didn't seem understand saying   called server over he saw wrong apologized took away food order right   We're now starving eating all bread table which grocery store quality way   Spongy crusty all   waiting another 30 minutes now 90 minutes waiting APPETIZER several visits waiter kept making feel uncomfortable being over apologetic decided talk manager   She nice enough apologized inconvenience said didn't pay anything left   Over hour half no real food other bad bread bad service   first trip last   Hope your experience better     Oh way if GOOD Italian food place you   tell bread when place good it's good could see others getting   place looks mid west American style Italian food   par Olive Garden   Good luck! <EOR> 0 stars   Huge disappointment   Father law always talking wanting try place since couple months ago waiting Carmines open   dined last weekend experience both food service horrid!  server never came back ask if needed anything else once meals came out   pasta dish undercooked   clam pasta tasted extremely bland tasteless   meat sauce boring   took 15 minutes asking 3 different people before basket bread   laws fed slow service horrible food   What's going Carmines???  ever return  <EOR> Just private party 25 people start finish   AMAZING!!

your Las Vegas location last night 7 45 reservation made through OpenTable com subjected your employee Edward proceeded become most insulting inappropriate simply slimy person unfortunate enough come contact with  When he took over table mid meal greatly enjoying experience  hostess first waitress excellent no way reflects performance  Upon being passed off Edward things seemed light fun however inappropriate comments actions progressed somewhat uncomfortable bizarre outright vulgar insulting end evening point where wife tears both later evening still morning  comments ranged talking mediterranean penis size personal attacks two friends hair lines basically giving another friends wife lap dance middle restaurant each time guised jest yet very contemptuous  even begin convey infuriation manner still evening cooling off only find situation more unacceptable  insulting party disrespectful both women husbands embarrassing myself host evening  Never before such negative

Service little slower food took long time  <EOR> Blah! Ordered Linguini clams  No good  Smelt tastes burnt garlic much crappy oil used cook dish waaaay over priced  Wine served cocktail glass instead wine glass ghetto!!! its old school Italian but if keeping old school Italian why did offer Cheese shellfish? place should pack retire  <EOR> Excited try place limited bar many flavored vodkas food mediocre best Maggiano's much better back! <EOR> In town conference took customer dinner   He actually requested Carmine's lieu some gold standard restaurants area   very pleasantly surprised!  started calamari   crisply fried greasy all   Four ate whole platter   then split Porterhouse steak penne pasta rose cream sauce   pasta very good if simple   porterhouse outstanding   cut size usually tough difficult prepare properly   med rare sliced into thin strips little drizzle garlic butter over top butter no wonder   very tender flavorful  all commented good was     Definitely solid 3 1 2 stars! <EOR> Food good but bit heavy garlic every dish me   Enjoyed family style service    chocolate torta reason again  <EOR> Best Italian food Vegas   probably because NY!
