Well over place met woman could barely speak English could apparently understand even less  wondered hold see problem car car having explain themselves repeatedly point across   Yet person handling drive thru  crazy  mean could care less anyone speaks but if running Wendy's restaurant English speakers coming would seem would someone window speaks English   Anyway Ice tea cool natural cut fries great  burger though well think needs bit help  bacon just left bad taste mouth  All all I'd say pass Wendys  <EOR>
