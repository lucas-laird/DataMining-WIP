I really enjoy Panera  fact stop myself eating all time especially when cold crave soup   I'm big fan French Onion Soup  very flavorful always seems just right amount onions  recommend bread bowl but if double check included all accouterments bread bowl croutons cheese   couple very sad occasions forgotten other to go bag  broccoli cheese soup also very good   The salads really good very unique combinations nice change normal things similar prices Applebee's Ruby Tuesday  sandwiches also very nice but Panini bit smallish side   Oh! bagels especially Asiago cheese great! even dozen schmear  your work staff meetings   The chai tea yummy way better Starbucks   As bonus Panera offers free wi fi  done some writing laptop even though jazz music bit loud taste free wireless more made it   My only major complaint besides them forgetting blasted croutons location never seems enough registers open line very quickly becomes annoying especially when people can't figure want  <EOR>
