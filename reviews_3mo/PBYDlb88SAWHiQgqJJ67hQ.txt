Our waitress Precilla always around making sure everything needed  She also gave some great suggestions beers she dead correct  light ale Magic Hat #9 which excellent! Easy drink light ale perfect burger  previous 4 star perfect 5 star  Keep Rattlecan  guys killing burger game! <EOR> I feel love place once read Adult Soda section menu fell love Dew Dude drink! 3 olives Vodka fresh lime MOUNTIAN DEW D Genius!! drinks pricey but tasted good kept ordering anyways    kudos Rattlecan turning beer drinking into hard liquor drinker night always said if alcoholic beverage tasted Dr  Pepper would trouble    will turns Mountian Dew flavored drinks weakness well So lets move Rattlecan turning into lush night shall we?? place also made glutton D Oh MY!! Bar food kicked notches!! Pizza nachos fried pickles   some other stuff because now drinks really kicking in    and probably best burgers had   The Vintage avocado added OMFG! Yummy!! even big burger lover   actually rarely order but night happy place nomming thing  whoopee pies actually pretty full didn't try shall back again   and again   and again! <EOR> We located brand new spot LV couple weeks ago whilst attempting find spot lunch  brother traipsing all over Palazzo decided take lunch First Food Bar upstairs  Unfortunately some changes must made First because routed downstairs Rattlecan stating menu same chef would similar    Well yes no  starters Rattlecan kind synonymous everything hate cheesiest parts Las Vegas  Garrish loud decor spills around every corner pops every wall  Urban Daddy piece written RC describes feels place where Axl Rose would started fight Appetite Destruction tour but response hardly  menu priced way high anybody Appetite Destruction tour  doubt Axl Rose would ventured past entrance restaurant casting eye inward    Anyway   the food which REALLY about  Pastrami Sandwich Mini Wagyu Burgers    The Pastrami sandwich very serviceable along mini Wagyu sliders although seriously doubt sliders made real Wagyu  Tasted burger meat me    Unfortunately going pass experience can't really recommend others  food decent service good but end day just tons tons better choices made Las Vegas  price point guys charging better off venturing elsewhere such First Food Bar even lower end steakhouse bar menu  <EOR> I'm sure now you've probably heard all graffiti artists contributed interior space if haven't read site  restaurant laid pretty cool bar along side decorated old skateboard decks some high top seating middle few large private booths opposite side  There's also outdoor patio great view fountains strip large seating area back surrounded neon many TV screens even mechanical pickle ride when purchase Rattlecan Pickleback shot  There's plenty look between all artwork carvings tables attractive waitresses    may loud bit much some but found very cool   Their menu equally stacked several burgers choose hot dogs salads pickled items huge selection beers cocktails  couldn't resist appetizer items reading BBQ pork donut crisp tempura BBQ pork stuffed roll honey drizzle pickled jalapeno  sweet crunchy delicious  poutine also sounds amazing ordered future visit    After much deliberation namesake Rattlecan burger custom house blend angus beef cheese bacon caramelized onions pickle special sauce L T sesame brioche roll  Upon first bite taste quality meat excellent flavor  patty great char flavor cooked close medium rare but maybe bit overdone  bacon amazing smoky flavor caramelized onions really good cheese perfectly melted very tasty too  just enough L T fresh well  bun probably star show dense yet flaky top well proportioned just really great flavor  Although picture may look whopper some people pointed worlds ahead far superior  Easily better burgers year   I pro tip friend crinkle cut fries might frozen variety should house cut fries instead  Since burger comes crinkle cut sure adjustment order glad did  fries great which came welcome surprise considering fries upstairs First really took away could strong burger meal last visit  cooked well skins them crispy delicious without lot bad oily flavor refer often  note initially charged full $7 cost house cut fries both burgers bill because swap but waitress only removed but also took off supposed $2 50 fee should remained change  While $1 50 difference between two types fries menu sure idea having pay more swap out  almost always hate crinkle cut cool being forced pick something else  Also if pay $7 small amount house cut fries side would pretty pissed even considering good were   Our entire meal appetizer two burgers two drinks came slightly steep $66 75  $12 small but tasty cocktail bit expensive could probably without two small pork donuts $11  burger fries very reasonable $16 given strip location just good was  If deal just burger meal two waters something very good food money but easily creep expensive burger outing if you're careful  also mention gluten free bun option which think great girlfriend trying stay gluten free but isn't always easy when eating around town   75 cent additional charge but very large rosemary flavored good looking bun  very good compared others but still same compared real bun certainly sesame brioche mine  Also Liz server super attentive extremely friendly  All wait staff seemed very attentive fun just restaurant itself  Rattlecan certainly amazing burger finally gives some other places property run money  <EOR> Stopped few drinks Kick Flippin Breeze Strawberry Breeze  seated quickly patio requested greeted quickly drinks quickly  However sat sat sat  starting wonder if just going dine and dash  don't think should wait very long time hunt someone down just pay   Second drinks    while good    may alcohol them  just really alcoholic no liquor drinks   I don't give often    but going 2 stars this  <EOR> Cool vibe excellent burgers nice craft beer list  <EOR> This burger done right  Did Burner burger  Actually spicy Ghostbuster sauce hot too  GF did Rattlecan loved too  Come some  <EOR> I found place while walking around looking something eat  love rock music burger thought why not! I sort glad did  Now before forward new years day long night feeling good  Midway through meal really started feel awful started getting chills  left straight back hotel room soon running fever  Now back restaurant  liked setup place soon walked greeted sounds stones  sat bar just ordered coke  ordered burger named place good  But around time started eating started feel bad  take bacon off  did finish burger very good  But asked check while still eating soon done ran there  I really did place would definitely back! <EOR> After full weekend debauchery gambling Venetian relax watch some sports little bit more gambling  walking past sports bar area found joint felt trying something new  décor restaurant definitely different Venetian kind reminded Hot Topic  made way into restaurant bar sat immediately saw specialty place burgers  all ordered Rattlecan burger side tater tots fries    On Rattlecan chose put egg ordered side ghostbuster chili just add some kick burger tater tots  friend ordered drink but didn't realize came late until nice waitress came drink apologized drink coming late  top she comp'ed since she felt bad it  Now type Vegas service LOVE Vegas    When burgers came didn't realize HUGE burgers were! burgers definitely big enough share those lighter appetite keep mind! Also restaurant doesn't ask want your burger cooked  automatically cook medium pink center should be! burgers come usual fix ins tomato cole slaw pickles  burger itself pretty good but those wanting kick order side ghosbuster chili smother your burger tater tots  **FYI ghostbuster chili spicy those aren't keen heat don't overboard!  The food relative Vegas price 16 20$ burger  All all liked burger see myself coming back again! <EOR> Sure ahead charge mandatory 20% gratuity without any mention party one however going cost business  refuse eat anywhere mandatory gratuity especially no disclosure  Gratuity supposed reflection service  Rattlecan's customers going find rapidly decaying service all why try hard?  Also generally tip 20% good service but believe standard still 15%   It's bad because lvs fries pretty good   However when ate during nfl playoff game sound blaring  During commercials intolerably loud  leave quickly possible couldn't take it  only ate half dish   Fail  <EOR> The busted meatball nachos outstanding   totally different take standard nachos   adult classic drinks really good too   Try blueberry smash   great   The outdoor patio terrific   Great view atmosphere     Super friendly   Excellent service  <EOR> Let start off saying food great but prices SCARY   $14 $20 burger no sides $5 soft drink $5 fries  $3 extra dipping sauce    Our bill 2 burgers 1 side green beans 1 dessert = $52  Ouch  The food very good though  Burgers prepared beautifully  Sides well portioned  Juicy pink meat!   Take shot Jameson pickle juice chaser $9  <EOR>
