We attempted walk In N Out which possible way but since pretty hungry and continuing walk involved crossing relatively dangerous street hailed taxi which took last quarter mile there   The parking lot packed cars  Other taxis taking folks and might seen limo   line pretty long snaking almost outside door  Diners eating outside well inside but while waiting somehow managed secure few tables group  Service going fast could simply amazing mass customers   I ordered 3x3 Animal Style  usual DELICIOUS love In N Out don't fall former camp   friends requested hot peppers came little baggies first time seen In N Out made burger even better  If In N Out good ones which everything just way usually it  Recommended good greasy fast food meal off Strip nothing more  <EOR> Hmm    guess friends just hyped place   first trip Vegas first meal off plane In N Out   knew place going tourist trap but crowd insane   Despite amount people plenty seating   order took 8 minutes ordered   fast fast food joint   Anyhoo Double Double burger good but can't say same fries   Made high grade potatoes?   nice   bad they're soggy!  I'd give place 4 stars but burger joint only outstanding if BOTH burger fries good  <EOR> Very very funny   like other pal review we ALSO tried walk MGM nice stroll down strip? WRONG   also take cab 1 4 mile   hilarious    Anyway Outs only CA NV AZ   so whenever am MI gal wants out   I took pal Boston first time she asked going ruin McDonalds me? Answer YES 100% puts McDonalds burgers SHAME   In fries great but burgers totally worth it and better burgers because can't anything else aside pop fantastic shake!    unlike McD's rest places literally using fresh beef burger buns fresh buttered come FRESH sliced tomato onion lettuce special sauce die for   they use real cheese cheese fries too!   Bottom line   GO if never unless want ruin your fast food burger experience forever     <EOR> This might most ridiculous In N Out ever due massive neon sign along I 15   Having grown San Diego no stranger In N Out   burgers great   Well worth wait something  truly made fresh fast food atmosphere   also love shakes   bad they're only served size   maybe  good thing calorie count   This particular location always packed   drive home around midnight every night stopped through drive through solid 10 minute process more   sure if tourist thing being near strip but slower most    saying something since most In N Outs always busy   I'd suggest In N Out northwest part town faster service   The only thing am impressed fries   hardly ever fries here   waste time   course there's famed secret menu   Look internets find grilled cheese like   Good times  <EOR>
