I heard place long time ago Indonesian friends  love indonesian food but unfortunately no Indonesian restaurants town  When heard place thought check out  Although almost half year ago since still clearly remember lame food    When pretty slow other probably only other 2 old couple having dinner  Decorations place kind lame see all furniture really old should probably change it  But don't care furniture much  restaurants eat appreciate good decorations  leave points decorations other reviewer   As soon menu right away turned Indonesian food section  eyes sparkling pretty sure dropped tear just looking menu   Since friend no idea indonesian food thought let server explain him  Unfortunately server no idea either  She never tried any food  minute two server finally recommended dishes  Which beef coconut curry flavor  thought give try since server admitted herself she knows she knows sure good dishes  also ordered some salad some shrimp dishes    Once received dishes beef looked pleasant eyes all  looked almost mongolian beef old leftover gravy put top it  When tried it  All taste coconut milk barely taste any other flavor  just horrible  indonesian human feel embarrassed if kind Indonesian food serve human beings  know chinese restaurant but If can't serve indonesian food then don't put menu! Maybe just wrong day maybe chef just regular chef usually knows cook Indonesian dishes    But experience food good all  3 dishes ordered  1 them 0 star 2 them 1 5 star  Average 0 5 star  <EOR> Came lunch few weeks ago  just okay   The lunch specials $6 99 seemed good deal  mongolian beef  came hot sour soup well fried rice spring roll wonton  food okay but nothing special   I'd give place another try but first only experience underwhelming might even bother  <EOR>
