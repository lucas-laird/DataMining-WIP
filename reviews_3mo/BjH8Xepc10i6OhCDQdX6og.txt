Seafood excellent if table  Since did think reservations wait table wasn't even restaurant itself but outer part where people see when walk by  Still did mind seeing opportunity lifetime dine Emeril Legasse's restaurants  seasonal oysters dipping sauces great    fresh clams if them  Those highlights! Great sauces accompanying them  If prefer your seafood cooked big selection well  those seafood well things such chicken pork chops steak but highly recommend seafood  gumbo well but don't think good  wasn't bad but superb  <EOR>
