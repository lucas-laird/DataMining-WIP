Horrid!  Avoid all costs   being said only bad piece fish whole time  We started rolls   Great stuff   Tiger Roll which tempura battered roll best ever had  Joe's Roll tremendous  Japanese Burrito much sour cream it  At point actually forgot sat half hour waiting dish never came  very uncool   All all excellent   fish great all but octopus rolls great   If rubber piece fish would perfect   I would give place second chance again! <EOR>
