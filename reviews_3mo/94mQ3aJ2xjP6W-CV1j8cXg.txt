Worst Port Subs Ever! meat even thick enough slicer down sandwich  Then threw toppings game ultimate frisbee  Then cut sandwich wrapping tearing prior throwing bag  time arrived destination try piece together sandwich could eat it  Just lot cost cutting sacrificed quality product  area already severe lack food options am sad cannot frequent place future  <EOR> I think secret ingredient Port of Subs sandwiches crack  Seriously  crave every day but forced myself only once week   I don't understand two star rating  PoS bad neighborhood but very clean anytime come crowd uniformed services workers cops firemen mailmen etc    atmosphere chill   When which usually lunch work Downtown fabulous server always great mood but over top annoying  Everyone encountered works pleasant mood works very quickly   The best part Port of Subs unlike subway bread doesn't stale while you're eating it  your sandwich grilled panini press which think way better toasting  <EOR>
