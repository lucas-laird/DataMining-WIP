 Anyhow server completely knowledgable menu even said guys really testing tonight! inquired Omakase works   She said could choose 6 courses ourselves Chef us   experience always good Chef's choices  did     Now am totally familiar restaurant but heard known 2x fried chicken steam buns ramen   excited try much possible but understood couldn't try everything   Server brought place settings many forks knives ramen spoon   excited know would getting ramen   First seasonal salad   really liked dressing I think yuzu vinagrette   pretty good even managed eat chopsticks!

The presentation duck breast actually made look very appetizing but looks definitely deceiving  duck breast stuffed shitake mushrooms wrapped bacon served top shitake marmalade extra mushrooms   really liked would definitely order again   We then received Hamachi Kama which definitely something would've chosen but AMAZING!  served thai peanut sauce coconut slaw some greens well   dove right then realized seaweed wraps well maybe supposed wraps fish peanut sauce slaw?  wasn't explained when food brought table ended just eating fish   Which fine because really good am huge fish eater   We then expected ramen but never came   fact then received dessert   really disappointed didn't ramen steam buns 2x fried chicken at least them would've nice    top desserts just good   served doughnuts which just strange but ended being better 2   tofu doughnuts sweet potato rosemary   topping purple which just weird The other dessert soft serve hate say but disgusting   menu says coffee soft serve Fernet caramel pop rocks nori   First all love coffee ice cream but inedible   Also am sure decided use fernet caramel but just wrong   Lastly no sign pop rocks nori which ok because doesn't even sound would made dish any better!  This good ending decided order bowl ramen share since expected during meal never it  Logan Poser Ramen  OK  really liked crispy pork came with   Overall decent experience  would definitely back but adding courses no way food $200  Then additional $60 drinks? casual place doesn't quite match vibe  think slight identity crisis  <EOR> The food delicious  Service excellent  offer Japanese food tapas style  everything order small portions meant shared   didn't extremely casual atmosphere  $400 dinner Chipotle atmosphere   just weird  <EOR> A fan Yusho  Didn't care gimmick Japanese style tapas described server   categorization cuisine didn't restaurant justice  okay just Japanese restaurant    host team needs together considering restaurant half empty  sent table already seated then led host another table  big deal but writing 5 days later kind stuck oddest way   The 2x fried chicken delicious huge portion 5 pieces chicken breast  Lamb swears tender hint flame them  also tried rib eye special amazing  Can't even describe spices but flavor explosion  try espresso soft serve donuts  don't well dairy but really try soft serve  delicious  tofu donuts more savory  sweet   Both delicious own right  wouldn't back seconds donuts though    Our bill only touched $134 included 3 drinks items above  great deal fun eating here! would back sure  <EOR> Yusho sho' know memorable dining experience  See did there?
