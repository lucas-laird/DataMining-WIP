I share opinion numerous others commented buffet under Bellagio hotel listing fact best Vegas buffet world   Once again sure arrive just before change over lunch dinner shot dishes two services  <EOR> went first arrived vegas   lunch time here  OMG food great  loved there  <EOR> Hands down BEST and most expensive buffet ever probably ever have  Loved food! But $32 person better love it  <EOR> There isn't anything Las Vegas ultra buffet  King Buffets definitely Bellagio  thick juicy steak grilled order your crab legs can't even begin describe its when come here  think if don't know then you'll just find out  price tag looks steep surface but once try realize thats its such bargain end me    profit? Oh yeah gambling  <EOR> Pretty damn good buffet  done breakfast lunch one  If only easier way say that   hmm    Anyway food good if nearly completely meat based  tend fairly exotic meats such wild boar heritage turkeys  Definitely plus  only problem salads uniformly piss poor  Especially Asian style salads wow downright inedible  Other though best buffets Vegas definitely battle between Paris Bellagio  <EOR> Thank goodness fled streets Paris head over buffet!  good   buffet sampler if can't control portions just taste    recall couple side absolutely appalled picked 5 desserts   Well much appalled but absolutely jealous exhibited no shame total commitment pigging    he he he   Bastards!  appalled no else left tip servers   Oh why missing star?  Only b c remember best brunch ever hotel Waikiki   will update if remember which was  <EOR> Bellagio Wynn best buffets town  They're also  priciest but worth every cent  If you've tried some other places Bellagio surprise its quality variety  Concentrate on the expensive items smoked salmon don't waste room on pizza salad eat anywhere  If you're confused  selection try small sample each item then next pass you'll know which dishes take  Most buffets only small number  of really good things when much selection makes sense plan ahead  Keep mind Bellagio DOES any good desserts besides fresh fruit don't worry saving room won't need it  last note plan tipping least 20% probably more  service good  <EOR>
