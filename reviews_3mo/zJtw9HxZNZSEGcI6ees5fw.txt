L O H A!!!!! <EOR> Now show definitely worth watching optional dinner even better because started building appetite middle show while menu Kahunaville restaurant offered exceptional! order   First made access show buying tickets breeze! website which easily just Google name Island Heat Show check showtimes well buy tickets  Really nice evening date great time loved it  show made dinner date look WINNER!   The service great well  restaurant manager walked around tables prior show starting introduced himself asked if anything else needed  Service everything city Vegas topped list venues visit show restaurant bar next door outside showroom   The performers where incredible! Elvis impersonator lead singer really good entertainers know crowd engaged great spirits  dancers provided exciting entertaining performance especially when enveloped crowd acts  thought great all shows Las Vegas now days basically look movie theater instead engaging performance other shows tend just rows seats stage nothing else everything far away no basic interaction  different welcoming!  Their food!!! Although optional really can't full show without good meal  hungry  thought pineapple chicken delicious! started off nice light salad when main course came jaw dropped!   I recommend show anyone  Sometimes Cirque style shows old when every casino  Island Heat Show provides variety  <EOR>
