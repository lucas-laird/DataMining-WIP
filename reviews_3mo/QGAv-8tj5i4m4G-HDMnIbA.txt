Then Griddle Cafe place you   stacks huge fluffy tasty   pancake fan?  No worries    The Griddle Café extensive breakfast menu also build your own burger   Trust me   The Griddle Cafe worth it    Long Review LA location impressed pancakes French toast service  disliked LA location wait   Yup those fools waited over hour breakfast LA location  didn't regret meal but wasn't heading back anytime soon due wait   Now they're Las Vegas inside SLS wait isn't bad   know means?  means monster breakfast Mel C fork     So what's good?  Well thoughts  Peanut Bubba French Toast If you're peanut butter lover then you'll love this   French toast  dipped peanut butter?  Enough said   Texture crunchy outside peanut buttery inside   love peanut butter taste   NOTE LA location   LV menu well  Sow Your Oats Cinnamon Honey Rolled Oats??? Imagine your typical bowl oatmeal cinnamon   Well  Sow Your Oats stack  Texture different but popular stacks  NOTE LA location   LV menu well  The Golden Ticket banana lovers there   don't eat much fruit due allergies but willing take risk sampling bad boy   Banana caramel walnuts all combined create masterpiece  Pure Imagination basically Build Your Own burger sandwich   Yes this   love pancakes but craving sandwich burger last visit here   them create chicken sandwich mushrooms jack cheese green chili   sloppy but good   huge plus side steak fries  Chicken Breast Egg Whites Yup   I boring visits   Actually supplemented chicken breast egg whites meals   Taste wise   it's just grilled chicken breast eggs whites   Nothing special  NOTE LA location   LV menu well  Tortilla Chips Why even mention this?  Because good addicting  Fresh crispy airy would describe them     Overall isn't thing disappointing   Also don't let price meals fool you   low price most meals backed monster servings   whole order pancakes easily serves 4 people two Mel C's     I would probably give LA location 4 stars star drop due wait   But location wait wasn't bad they're local me   5 stars is   Yeah Buddy!   TIP If don't huge appetite then order just stack   whole order stacks equals food coma  <EOR> Loved place!! two other people all made mistake getting dish per person  recommend sharing  put down food no other but could barely finish 1 2 French toast!!!
