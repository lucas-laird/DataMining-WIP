New pizza place Wynn named appropriately enough   Pizza Place!  sure but believe site old Sugar Ice located end esplanade   Nicely done casual place which still somehow manages fit nicely into Wynn theme   great place pop quick bite talk business   Pizza wasn't authentically Italian level say A16 San Francisco but bad all especially hot oven     Interesting   I just took look Wynn website list Pizza Place finest New York style pizza   initial impression when striving more authentically Italian New York   Reasonably priced pizza Wynn?  Definitely sign times  <EOR> I sad see Sugar Ice replaced Pizza Place end Esplanade  Before thoroughly scouting menu remember letting shrieking NOOOOOOOO! fear would getting tomato bisque fix  Hungover starving grumpy lack sleep heart sunk  Whyyyy??
