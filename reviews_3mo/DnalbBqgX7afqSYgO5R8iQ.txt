My first CPK experience Mirage Hotel   fiance playing Roulette table pit boss came over say 'Hi'   He asked if hotel guests said 'No'   He said he hoped we'd consider staying Mirage future gave food voucher $60   Now surprise since big players only played 15 minutes so   Casino comps guests all time but usually big players only if played awhile   Nevertheless gladly accepted hospitality     We decided give CPK try   wait horrendous!  line least 45 minutes   Once seated service slow   took forever drinks waitress take orders   Then took another life time food arrive!  ordered Spring Rolls Vietnamese style Kung Pao Spaghetti Shrimp Chicken Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine   can't remember ordered dessert if did all!  We big fans Vietnamese style Spring Rolls   actually ordered them mistake thinking Egg Rolls deep fried    Duh!  only took bite taste didn't care them     I fell LOVE Kung Pao Spaghetti first bite   flavorful spicy   would thought cook Kung Pao Spaghetti noodles?  peanuts gave noodle extra kick  fiance loved Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine too   He even used bread pick any sauce left over plate   Yes know proper etiquette but no 5 star restaurant     We only ordered iced tea since neither drinker   honestly couldn't remember if ordered any dessert if did was!  All could remember stuffed didn't even use all $60!!!    We back CPK different locations since most often Brea where closest home order same thing every time because  much them!  even learned Kung Pao Spaghetti home hit everyone   Well am Chinese I'd better know Kung Pao!  Service could vary quite bit depending locations   But chain restaurant expect consistency food quality  <EOR>
