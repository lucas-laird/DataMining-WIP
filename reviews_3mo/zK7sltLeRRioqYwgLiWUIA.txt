Support #DTLV great dining experience while you're it  Also Goose Island other beers tap! Only thing would recommend bar area tv music videos  Maybe turn ESPN just anything else would see your neighborhood bar  <EOR> This place amazing! You'd think being downtown it'd respectfully clean bad but amazed! could damn near eat off floors clean although don't strongly recommend literally doing so!! food super fast hot practically sat down food right behind me  would highly suggest place everyone if bomb ass burger filling shake actually all goin they're looking for!! <EOR> My kids love place! three times last week  sons love sliders shakes  burger jalapeños excellent  haven't tried loaded fries but look pretty amazing  restaurant itself really clean stylish definitely upscale compared most burger places  service excellent each visit  live work downtown until now didn't good go to burger joint we're thrilled Flippin' Good 'hood  <EOR> This place cool! took minute find look start Fremont street heart attack grill then cross street across Insert Coins Bar next griffin    I just ordered banana shake onion ribs but both reasonably priced $7 88 total came quick both really good!  The shake pieces banana required extra slurp power but really good  onion rings crispy but overly flavor point  mine ketchup but good without  Some them double onions inside batter which good   The inside very white comfy  giant TV playing 90s alternative music videos but decor orange white seemed retro chic liked it  clean inside servers nice even broke $10! come back try burger next time  <EOR> Awesome location amazing burgers chicken sandwiches flippin' fries onion rings frozen custard! Customer service great food always comes correctly quickly  <EOR> I'm updating review three stars four based most recent visit Flippin' Good downtown Las Vegas  first visit extremely excited visit Flippin' Good because I'd looking old fashioned burger custard place Vegas  store very nice inside wide booths evenly spaced tables small counter area bar stools large flatscreen TV  outside looks little hastily painted as door handles already chipping but still very presentable attractive    One best qualities restaurant amazingly CLEAN everything a rarity eateries Fremont Street   If employees aren't taking orders cooking food going around wiping down tables mopping floors    I wait momentarily place order all employees busy but employee came over apologized sincerely wait patiently took order  She made sure carefully adjustments husband's burger no toppings beside bacon cheese asked sure order screen correct  She accidentally punched 2 patty turkey burger but quickly changed 1 when pointed out   Be prepared wait little bit your food approximately 7 8 minutes but  because everything made fresh piping hot! husband LOVED bacon cheeseburger while enjoyed fresh toppings homemade bun turkey burger extremely salty  probably just stick regular beef burger next time    I back counter order brownie concrete and added banana 50 cents   first concrete hard eat the lid isn't large enough spoon fit through overflow concrete spilled onto counter when took lid off but combination brownies banana smooth custard BOMB!   I'm sure husband visit again soon  <EOR> I impressed  Still little bummed Gyro place away but think downtown needed good burger place  Only thing bugged couple items menu highlighted spicy sauce which apparently discontinued  <EOR> First milkshakes outstanding  should just stick them  burgers worth prices charging  management interested fact while 30 mins saw 6 people come walk out  He sat corner saw but didn't try find why left  Bad business new addition Fremont   am local would love see them succeed but need changes soon  <EOR> Flippin' good? More Flippin' mediocre    I love Fremont East  kickin' before even dubbed Fremont East  excitedly walked watch place evolve smelled glorious smells coming within    recent trip downtown lead Flippin' Good Burgers when starving   FGB cross between McDonald's Smashburger but waaaay closer McD's side  fast food  no IN N Out even Carl's Jr worthy  Yes cleaner McD's staff definitely friendlier but just special   I ordered classic cheeseburger side fries  burger bland overcooked served big ass bun really mostly buns hun came lettuce onion tomato which all fresh still crisp   fries fries  Again nothing write home about   The food really two star worthy but clean freshness newness reasonable prices friendliness staff allow tip stars favor FGB  <EOR> Let tell never ever ever burger joint where mess all three meals  ordered old fashion burger asked no tomatoes but add pickles    brought table total opposite full tomato no pickles! already bitter point  Another order messed friend  He ordered flippin' onion fries when came NO ONIONS just cheese not even good cheese fries!
