I only gave buffet 1 because could give zero   possibly worst food ever life   All food frozen entrees   Nothing fresh even salad old bagged junk could food bank   price $13 99 unless card then $9 99 believe would much better off going over ANY fast food joint   Mushy soggy bland over heated food looks sitting around long time if choose buffet   Pass   Please Pass one  <EOR> This Terribles just recently changed name grand opening  really didn't seem much going on  week long celebration giveaways but those done nothing much happened during week    It's off strip but walking distance if you're that  However worth trip  casino dark didn't look very new updated however can't great judge since when Terribles    The only promotion new players $5 slot play  some newer machines but lot older trouble getting free play work them  stayed played free play threw few more bucks then headed back strip  worth trip unless happen driving it  <EOR> I liked place   much Boulder Hwy casinos but worked   I'd consider staying here   buffet good which shame setup seems pretty nice   the food just falls flat  <EOR> One world worst casinos ever! First off Buffet horrid!  We wouldn't even eat there! some yeller! Then ordered something eat restaurant OMG!  ordered Bisquits Gravy when husband room   we thought joke!  All gravy leaked all over!  he take back then when then wouldn't refund gave another one! gross!  didn't eat all take trash hall  Then locked room although made copy ID   they wouldn't let because didn't license!  mad finally told them calling cops just freaking stroke two weeks ago!  happy!  room hellish version Shining Security show them ID  2 towels 1 shampoo    that's it!

Pop here  <EOR> I wasn't staying but came July 4th  stayed before when terribles  Ok let just 100% honest  place terribles but just new name  If sign said terribles before then says silver sevens now  Some new slots maybe added some new tables but still just terribles  If liked terribles like did then silver sevens  awesome breakfast buffet better when terribles  dinner buffet why give place 4 instead 5  guys took giant leap forward breakfast buffet giant leap backward dinner buffet  burger buffet garbage sure type mystery meat eating  Mashed potatoes cold Antarctica  Salad dryer sahara desert  Please re train cooks dinner shift    Silver sevens does always free food freebies give though    This locals casino sure tourist but actually off strip win! Silver sevens super loose slots sure  Your money lot further would any strip casinos  Honestly fellow tourist  think should all just take left ballys walk over silver sevens  fancy but nice win money unlike strip   4 5 stars  back october 3 7 2013! See ya soon silver sevens <EOR> beware! lots new hidden charges! this place used terribles used enjoy stopping way other destinations southwest  but several annoying things changed mostly involving hidden charges * no more free wifi!! it used free! now around $5 4 hours wifi your room  apparently there's some free wifi section casino but didn't try confirm  guess hope you'll buy drink why surfing web    * now require $100 deposit when check in! didn't before when terribles    * upon check in terribles used give coupon free drink maye even two?! some coupons deals meals coffee but any more silver sevens!  * took 30 45 minutes attention any drink service while playing slots  must cut staff used much speedier    * they're now tacking unannounced $3 resort fee upon checkout  said new July 2013  never paid such fee past when terribles fee included front price  seems unnecessarily hidden ploy price appear lowest Kayak elsewhere    moral don't trust lowest price kayak!  on other hand rooms massively updated new carpets furnishings  etc  though kind liked scuzzy nature old terribles  but then again casino itself hasn't updated pretty boring uninteresting  <EOR> I come when free night play Bingo really old 80 year old chain smoker heart  Don't really expect anything less then presented wish kept old name though  Also noticed coffee shop C grade health department  Eeeek!! Buffet small food quality isn't great but Sunday champagne brunch drink your hearts content! <EOR> Met friend other day   hotel recently converted Terrible's new concept   conversion only really see some different paint new marque front   casino looks exact same before 24 hour cafe   cafe ok but DELICIOUS if coming bar   get mean??  hotel hallway directly outside casino nice showing off some new sides lighting etc   but once around back still still pretty Motel 6ish   inside room nice good sized big tv nothing negative say room   think friend said $50 $60 room  BUT $100 deposit some reason  <EOR>
