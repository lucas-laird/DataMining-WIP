There's new Indian grocery town! cares already getting dark live across town? Sangeetha spoke bright lights wide aisles  see! So those Yelping via iPhone app Sangeetha truly rightful Duchess Rani's World Foods  just usurper happened first able check via phone she added it  Hopefully abdication gets hosting ball posing nude tabloids    sorry understanding traditional Duchess responsibilities pretty limited but pretty sure those big two  ANYway    I expecting terrible parking sometimes those strip malls along Sahara but lot Rani's well marked spaced easy maneuver  7 30ish crowds lessened Sangeetha described but still plenty customers  Unfortunately kitchen run food closed but girl still walking around samosas smelled heavenly   I've pretty satisfied Indian grocery near Fort Apache doesn't seem place name names getting things need but Rani's looks go to place getting things *want *  For example every Indian grocery seems Eno the magic stuff cross tummies but Rani's *lemon* Emo  those ittle extras draw line between corner store  grocery store  sure Hobnob selection largest seen town let's start swoonies over Flakes Crunchies Bounties other British sweets  Spices aren't just bags small jars but huge huggable sizes well spices own well organized aisle must twice length anywhere else  Rani's also first place seen carries whipping cream local Anderson Dairy quart containers  Maybe other places all things but if probably missed underlit cramped spaces typical many little shops    Think supermarket mini market  Rani's carts baskets reusable bags  aisles wide clean well lit  Alas seems universal custom customers choose long oblivious conversations surrounded rings of leaping children middle such spaces  back store which somewhat V shaped aforementioned kitchen  middle all two ultra modern checkouts conveyor belts big LCD screens extremely friendly cashiers  guys thinking big think  Which despite sounds put down other places  think there's room enough everyone just way 7 11 Albertsons Whole Foods aren't quite direct competition  really sets Rani's apart though aside spacious organized environment produce dairy sections  Let's just say don't think guys run paneer anytime soon! Yes admit always making own paneer    always mean every time other those three times made sad little handfuls crumbling curd  Again maybe other places same array vegetables appropriate Indian feast but difference when everything laid nicely   The woman checked asked where heard them mentioned Sangeetha's review  conversation continued told I'd just checked Yelp phone would add another glowing review Yelp page when home  She anxious should know store looking bit chaotic its best all customers opening day but everything looked clean bright more tidy you'd expect customers still everywhere  Really commendable   Rani's deserves five stars indisputably raised bar all Indian groceries town staff extremely courteous professional able find everything wanted fair price  only way could more pleased if start selling Rose's Lime Juice Cordial the kind made sugar HFCS better yet! start giving cooking demonstrations even better yet! proper cooking classes  Please give think RWF congratulations start something wonderful! <EOR> This little tricky find visited night sign lit up   Even during day pass all time never seen only good grace Yelp heard Rani's all   This very clean spacious modern Indian market   well stocked all usual things spices pulses frozen foods pickles biscuits etc    produce section inviting well laid those little water sprayers above keep vegetables fresh     There's also deli counter hot snacks sweets attended very sweet ladies also prepare all foods   veg pakoras really nice also besan ka ladoo a subtle sweet flavored cashew yummy!
