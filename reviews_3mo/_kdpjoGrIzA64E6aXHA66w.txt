With recent closing RE Tapas restaurant closest tapas bar area   husband thought we'd give whirl   No sangria tapas?  did tell beforehand weren't getting liquor license until next week forgive them   We ordered Barcelona's Fries   delicious good sauce   Worth your money $4 50  Stuffed Mushrooms   Pretty good wanted more   Shitake mushrooms stuffed chicken chorizo parmesan cheese  Surf Turf   Thought wasn't worth money $10  Empanadas   Choice chicken pork   pork delicious chipotle aioli sauce   only beef don't put empanada s plural just cut half  Sliders   overcooked charred   would've complained but ever send dish back   All all okay dining experience   left feeling underwhelmed wishing gone Firefly instead   Maybe next time they'll win over some excellent sangria  <EOR>
