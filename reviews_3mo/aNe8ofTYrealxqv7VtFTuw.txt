Ok location Sierra gold did compare all Henderson location  While look almost identical inside locations service horrible  Especially bar  bartenders seem spend all time other side bar which separated large centerpiece can't see through  even wait 20 minutes just bill 20 minutes asked it   think took unintentional nano nap  sitting bar moved into restaurant portion  server little more top things even though she came across she very new  didnt anything eat except crispy fried mozzerella which nothing right home about  tasted frozen TGIF brand mozzeralla any grocery store  fact looked too  May actually been  didnt Flamin' Hot Cheeto onion rings time but wish since highlight last visit Henderson branch  <EOR> Never here? Well   just imagine PT's Pub Ty Pennington just threw on! Oh yeah   it's PT's Pub Extreme Makeover Home Style Edition written all over it  ventured over bar group friends watch little Sunday Night Football AL Playoff action  quite surprised when entered  very classy watering hole locals looking chill having good time amongst friends  Decor great     very modern inviting    My group sat down immediately greeted friendly waitress whose service impeccable throughout entire night  Always nick time when glasses empty she right take order  food    I must say    some greatest bar food long time  wings nachos fried ravioli delectable!!  Sierra Gold definitely see face more often now experienced it!! <EOR>
