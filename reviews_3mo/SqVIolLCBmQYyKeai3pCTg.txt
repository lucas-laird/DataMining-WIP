This review only Rainbow Blue Diamond SouthWest Vegas   because few Mcdees thats open 24hrs   Menu taste same other Mcdees around town   Would gotten more star if served breakfast before 5am because 4 40am just doing lunch menu still  denied good warm hearty breakfast settle unhealthy BIG MAC combo coke  <EOR> This McDonald's connected Terrible's convenience store gas station particularly favorites   It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond west but think staff could use some training customer service end other McDonald's nearby   The last time ate watched and listened staff members hollered dining area kitchen   Apparently she break and eating still wanted maintain conversation colleagues she continued screaming across dining room turn hollered back   Very professional group here   I'm sure all other customers enjoyed show well  <EOR>
