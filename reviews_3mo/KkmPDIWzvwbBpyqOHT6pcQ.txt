A group nine Wednesday night envy everyone else other restaurants nearby   Maybe jealousy play expectations higher should but would thought price expectations service experience would bit better   First table round tables especially large groups suck   crammed into table feet kicking another having eat preying mantises think eating your elbows glued your sides      Second service $$$$ restaurant take ladie's orders first keep track ordered which dish aren't shuffling food around when served   Third appetizers waitress recommended family style compromise decided bevy appetizers share   However restaurant recommended family style impossible serve cut up   Fourth drinks excellent drinks but sheesh Vegas keep them coming!  attentive!  Now goods great food   veal salad peppers gave little kick unlike anything before tasted excellent   also great apple tart dessert which achieved great balance   many desserts excessively sweet rich days nice lighter sweet showcases flavors ingredients   Also portions well defined   no means did leave hungry but able dessert leave without feeling glutton   ate everything would wanted to  <EOR> Right now favorite place eat Las Vegas   food just darn good   only part don't having reservation months advance    but worth it   I love encourage split everything then serve courses   Here recommendations Start Antipasto Platter yummy poopoo platter proscuitto cheeses roasted red peppers olives   oh good   roasted red peppers alone would great too   Then share sample Pasta Vodka sauce Meat Balls huge savory moist meat    They say famous Lemon Chicken   but Veal   If above stick Veal Chop Cherry Peppers    did Veal Chop Veal Parmesan which also fabulous much melted cheese looks pizza !
