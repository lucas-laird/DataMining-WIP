My friends craving some preserved egg pork congee stopped Red 8 Wynn hotel    I liked Asian inspired decor its red latterns giving 1930's Shanghai art deco flair   The congee delicious other dishes ordered  sauteed string beans XO sauce green onion pancakes   Red 8 red hot! <EOR> After hearing many good things Wynn expected more food restaurant service really sucked  sat right front place restaurant pretty much forgot us  turn around flag waiters down twice refills then again check  strange place pretty dead  <EOR>
