So 100 dollar food credit steakhouse while staying trop   Otherwise might ever set foot place   just don't think nice steak dinner also think Tropicana but  actually mistake   Once beyond host desk all sudden decor looked nice modern elegant fancypants restaurant   didn't expect all!  The caesar salad HUGE delicious filet medallions oscar tasty well   Almost undercooked medium asked but didn't actually mind once started eating   added lobster tail though little dry nothing little drawn butter couldn't  cure   husband prime rib crab legs nothing but awesome things say both well horseradish came with   The service excellent great intimate meal thoroughly enjoyed   wasn't best food I'd ever but definitely high point trip! <EOR>
