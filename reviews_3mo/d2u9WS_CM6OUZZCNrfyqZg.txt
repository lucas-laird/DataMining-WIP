Let start saying although traveled Asia many times Korea limited experience cuisine   In word Woo Che Asian Grill Buffet just awful  several buffet stations chose from  first area selection chilled raw marinated beef chicken shrimp  choose want then bring them back your table which built in grill  Sounds good far right? other stations include rice station chilled veggies sushi Japanese selections kimche other assorted Korean favorites   Where start?  The buffet sections supposed chilled only slightly cooler then room temperature foods supposed hot tepid best  Honestly am shocked health department hasn't shut them down    Now food  Okay know just said food wasn't kept proper temperatures   and should looked buffet before being seated but people decided wanted give try  admit being sheep   and without protest stayed   The unknown meats somewhat disgusting  OMG chewy gristly choke them down pull bits mouth  marinated chicken weird coloration  course idiot ate some    The bottom line meats actually quite bad  rice cold pieces stuff called sushi room temperature Korean specialties offered liking  may due fact unfamiliar Korean food  Nobody back seconds   and all you can eat joint! says lot   To boot fairly spendy lunch $12 99  outrageous but high considering food quality    When drove parking lot took odds hey we're Vegas! whether would food poisoning  figured 30% chance would sick but fortunately fine nobody else party felt least bit ill  miracle    This definitely ranks worst meal experiences ever had  Even if fixed hot cold situation wouldn't back  unfortunate part really turned off ever trying Korean food again  <EOR>
