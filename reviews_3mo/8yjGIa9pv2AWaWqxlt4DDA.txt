A really nice break usual 'Strip' stuff  <EOR> I'm surprised place getting such great ratings  market themselves ceviche place ceviche terrible    This experience  called afternoon dinner reservation told don't need one  Should've red flag  much persistance convinced host just reserve table anyway  When arrived party wasn't yet took table because bar full  wasn't offered beverage quite some time    When friends arrived received warm water no ice sticky glass  sangria took very long time make  ordered 3 dishes waiting quite some time waitress  20 minutes waitress told chef just informed salmon    starving! Did she wait 20 minutes put order? People around getting food    The first dish arrive mini chorizo corn dogs  Flavor terrible no spice all  texture even worse  Next received item substituted salmon which crab ceviche  Completely over salted more tuna crab    Finally 3rd dish arrived hirame ceviche  When waitress described she mentioned special night which came salad  no salad  No greens  Nothing  least slightly tasty compared others but wasn't amazing  contemplated dessert but couldn't justify giving establishment another cent    I very glad some people planning dine couldn't it  would hate them suffer through meal  awful  Service poor food poor drinks poor    I say however place decorated nicely  Wouldn't bad stop beer before movie  just wouldn't eat  sure place stay open long pretty empty when words hostess reservations aren't really needed  <EOR> I'm sucker tapas or bocadillos case  although used think bocadillos sandwiches which shows much know but digress      when saw place Town Square check out   First all 2 entries Caña yelp  Both refer same place but address wrong  correct address 6599 Las Vegas Blvd  posting review under both   Now review    Caña located spot vacated Louis's Fish Camp did great job remodeling space  Louis's small bar entry way little odd  kinda felt walking through back door into restaurant because small door walking bathrooms getting glimpse behind bar area before getting dining area  Caña doorway larger more inviting bar pushed back adjoining patio areas  interior place much darker intimate well  bathrooms same location but pronounced   As food    ehh    ok but great   even really good either  Hamachi ceviche  other reviews mentioned traditional ceviches  They're more sashimi slices laying streak citrus sauce  Hardly enough citrus 'cook' hamachi  didn't taste all fresh lacked flavor  Short ribs  large short rib deep pool guava glaze  meat very tender but didn't much depth flavor  few more spices would given some kick made great dish but meat all its own little dull  Piggy back dates  seems every tapas bocadillos place bacon wrapped dates  guess should glad place did because best dish night  Great textures although amount goat cheese mousse overkill great flavors  Beef empanadas  outside empanadas flaky little crispy  inside could used more beef  Almost every bite pastry hint beef  beef tasted pretty good just wanted more it  Crispy shrimp  decent flavor crispy would liked  Sangria  while did taste good wasn't strong enough sweet  wasn't expecting   We sat bar Saturday night didn't any trouble finding seats  service very good  bartender top things didn't wait long drinks food even though he other bartenders very busy all those mojitos take while   bill came $88 including tip two people    bad  However doubt back food  Caña might cool chill place happy hour but better places around town tapas  I'd give them 2 5 stars if could but 'm rounding up  <EOR> Well don't hungry  8 friends girls night  point share food tapas style but when tiny morsels food $12+ plate its barely enough person enjoy  4 pieces fish size quarters $16?? Please  service good ambiance contemporary inviting however kind place indulge just feeling snacking paying $70 person basically appetizer  If feel tapas style night half dozen other places could would rather go  <EOR> Loved it! food bit expensive amount $10 5 meatballs little much but taste made it    The food amazing regardless price  drinks creative fun!

Hamachi ceviche those rookies me    this sashimi fish cooked citrus acid  never pickled hot peppers but its sweet hot tangy awesomeness  is obvious professional reviewer? Shrimp chicharran sauce crispy shrimp they use 3 flours little bit pop    Short ribs  large short rib guava glaze  Its probably best bbq sauce rich slightly tangy but smooth flavor  meat fall off bone tender    Piggy back dates  must have  dates wrapped bacon almond inside some pop then bed white mousse  Come on!  could eat coach all day   Best dish  must have  Mojitos admit didn't but 10 people mixed drinks variations mojito shocked people  sweet most    Lastly service perfect you'd expect timing each dish difficult    I want sit outside next time but packed wasn't possible but seem best view town square    Gun head I'd say didn't chicken skewers but turned missing rum glaze reason    I think loved most just variations every dish  Yes corn dogs but chorizo  Yes mac cheese but its habanero it  Piggy back dates almonds white mousse? picture taste like? There's something everyone here  Ceviche mac cheese shrimp pickled jalapenos bread pudding  joking place reminded dishes Nobu said friend just saying but might best meal ever felt trying find something didn't find mindblowing seem credible when told friends it  asking locals malls if been  wait Cana NYC open up  <EOR> This amazing restaurant best experienced anywhere   dinner fairly large group taste many very creative small plates each seemed better last   favorite dish might simplest one potatoes huancaina sauce think hollandaise only lighter much better!    But many other highlights seemingly all them unique takes well known dishes crispy shrimp short ribs bacon wrapped dates Cuban sliders halibut ceviche picante mac cheese  think throw dart menu end delicious dish and staff accommodating just might let you!
