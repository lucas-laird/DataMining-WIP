My friend both vegetarian combo which thought just fabulous  only second time eating Ethiopian while enamored food other place became hooked  friend adores Ethiopian food but apparently she thinks all delicious hard comparison her  I wish knew more food could tell more veggie combo  portion lentils yellow sauce lentils red sauce some kind lentil biscuit? barbecue sauce string beans carrots turnip greens pretty sure turnip greens salad  loved them all  Well wasn't crazy lentil biscuit thing but barbecue sauce delicious  going take pictures food but distracted trying add place new restaurant Yelp sorry that   The platter $10 plus tax enough lunch massive midnight snack  Plus when she packed food she gave extra piece injera bread which used next morning eat breakfast sop over easy eggs  Yum!  This also market but again place small  variety dried beans sale few items which sure use but think kitchen items  best part to sell packages injera bread although packages seem very big! don't know if would able use whole package few days but am glad know where some injera because turns love stuff  also counter area sign indicating meats special meats sell  I don't know special meats are  So   breakdown pluses food fabulous cheap  lady very nice  sell injera bread  open 4am 1am  What?? Yes true  postcard sized flyer says 4pm 1am but lady said misprint open early breakfast   The neutral tiny place capable seating 9 3 tables 3 chairs each   tables chairs very nice but overall decor ok   The bad faint odor didn't care think because meat market section  don't know if would bother anyone else but made uncomfortable when walked in  used little while  wanted try Ethiopian coffee but out  didn't menus  Huh? lady didn't speak much English hard know food options were  Best could figure choice vegetarian combo lamb  However postcard indicates offer large breakfast selection  think if Ethiopian knew wanted already order then would perfect little place some delicious food  But don't know food very well lack menu means communicate difficulty   If wasn't first review would probably given 3 stars overall rating  But food very good service very friendly prices very reasonable think more people should come check place out  <EOR>
