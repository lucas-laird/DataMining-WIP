The wife noticed place recently decided try noticing no reviews Yelp   It's Mexican cuisine whose format seems loosely based chipotle style ordering  menu limited offering burritos tacos quesadillas  offer ribs didn't try  Something ribs doesn't scream Mexican food me  ordered chorizo bacon breakfast burrito wife selected crane asada tacos which came two sides  burrito didn't bad taste but no texture even bacon very mushy  taco combination presented well looked promising  Unfortunately wasn't greatest crane asada had   pretty tough made eating tacos without destroying entire construction taco very difficult  woman helping very polite answered questions but could done better job explaining format ordering  kind just figure own she watched visibly verbally thrown off setup     Overall wasn't terrible prices aren't bad but hopefully over next couple months work some minor issues  I'd try again some point future <EOR> Delicious! looks everything made fresh daily  ordered wet burrito w pork  kind Subway them add whatever it  good actually ate whole thing! Will visit again! <EOR> So place pretty new still figuring stuff seems  Food pretty dang good  Carne Asada very good chicken big chunks I'd suggest beef instead  Everything else typical mexican style food flavor  All made fresh though they've going them    Prices great btw! We'll back sure <EOR> This place new awesome if live Northtown near Nellis  Great date nights kiddos  <EOR>
