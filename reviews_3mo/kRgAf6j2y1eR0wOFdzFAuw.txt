I recommend if plan coming reservations   busy  <EOR> We haven't Firefly awhile but thought would give new location try   awesome!  made few changes menu great   Specifically mini Italian Beef sandwiches Chicago style   Chicago native thought spectacular   new restaurant roomy great ambiance   interest Firefly definitely renewed back list regular places frequent   Room improvement service bit slow especially since Friday night place packed   prefer order couple plates time  Though told waiter he very good checking back regularly see if ready order more   Also something done noise level   suspect due low ceilings type flooring nothing absorb noise all patrons make   very difficult carry conversation due loud crowd noise   If place packed would unbearable   hope management something help minimize   If noise issue resolved would give 5 star rating   Overall must any trip Vegas  <EOR> I'd always fan place   didn't food poisoning  =D  love new location bigger cleaner nicer!  happy opened new restaurant closed other one   Must try sangria if haven't yet   Everything serve tasty  <EOR> In land buffets assortment restaurants truly hidden gem  only word need use describe place yum!!!! little bit off strip but definitely worth try  Everything tasted delicious mouthwatering  Also service pretty good would definitely recommend  <EOR> Loved finding unique tasty restaurant off strip vacation! food  pleasant twist authentic flavors  Since husband taken trips Spain real comfort food trip him    Be sure try different tapas share them standard Spanish tradition  also enjoyed Paella  must Vegas  <EOR> Most dishes fine  sure why all 4 5 star reviews  best thing probably stuffed dates  kitchen forgot order didn't food until 40 mins later  sucked  <EOR> Firefly fine but all amazing contrary its amazingly high yelp rating 4 5 time came   sangria excellent wife steak mushroom skewers liked them lot  But everything else ehhhh <EOR> Mediocre food super fast service good sangria   Unimpressed four dishes had  Lamb chops good  Polpo overcooked  Again very fast service  Fed full under hour Friday night  <EOR> Would've never traveled far location I west side often if wasn't latin nights Friday nights  Just other location sangria good service friendly although place bigger Sahara location there's still lack space move around   They large patio which see could nice dine if weather  nice but problem Vegas usually very extreme weather hot cold appropriate weather days far few between  Latin nights would much nicer if misters patio least if held event indoors  Everyone complaining heat ALL NIGHT most people dance song sit five cool off 100 degree temperature  Heat + Sangria + sweating due dancing = super dehydration hang over feeling shouldn't Friday nights ever again lol   Also didn't know there's automatic 18% gratuity drinks reservation  weren't going tip but just tad odd  thought just food  Just FYI won't caught off guard!   And yes all complaining still give them four stars bc think under right conditions could amazing venue  <EOR> Walking into new location just didn't feel Firefly  no squeezing bar waiting outside squeezing way through place way your table   certainly lost its coziness   friend lengthy discussion noting all differences didn't know feel 'it's just used be'  Then bacon stuffed dates came all sudden felt Firefly again started appreciate all improvements including significantly larger space improved decor   Food Booze still good ever  <EOR> Amazing food amazing sangria  Lobster corn dogs blew mind  Definitely try place <EOR>
