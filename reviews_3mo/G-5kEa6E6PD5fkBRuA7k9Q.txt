But main reason thought going great food major disappointment was  consider myself big foodie say food recipes just didn't work all dishes good just ok    no less 12 dishes all kinda suck  think really hard mess italian food if chef but guess done all   Another thing really disappointing overwhelming menu  said well versed diner menu waaaaaay much  Took friend also well versed dining 30 minutes oder  ended going lot signature dishes recommendations waitress wasn't good   And last comment service good if call that  personel always table making bit difficult carry conversation    I would love give another try later if change menu but would spend money what's menu now  would only ambiance view drinks! <EOR> This review personally Giada   Upon arriving Giada met least 8 hostesses standing all wearing same maternal looking black dress ill fitting heels    Then met eclectic decor wrinkled table clothes    Shortly seated greeted waiter another girl saying she would also helping  waiter told all appetizers drinks iPad  Using iPad cheapened experience authenticity restaurant  Just because restaurants starting implement iPads does mean works fine dining setting  things worse iPad froze multiple times  also thought little tacky when waitress put price fix menu table  okay suggest but whole folder takes half table your face especially ones first visit  decided against price fix until knew food worth price    15 minutes sitting down still no bread brought table requested some waiter  He comes back three different bread choices side toppings  surprised topping did see Parmesan  bread very underwhelming but did enjoy dipping breadsticks into pesto    I ordered caponata spaghetti shrimp lemon basil  dining partner ordered bucatini main    Before caponata came waiter said caponata usually served bread but Giada's light enough eaten its own  While caponata heavy still little much eating its own  spaghetti ordered solid even though could used little more seasoning  shrimp some largest scene however sitting seemed small puddle blood turned off  tried friends bucatini ending more she liked mine more traded  bucatini pasta well cooked but sauce undeveloped    We ordered cookies dessert great  favorite palmier  <EOR> Everything expected fine dining atmosphere e g  portion size price service presentation ambience   few small niggles could corrected  <EOR> Living hype   warm contemporary Italian American eatery delivers great tastes energy Vegas     This authentic taste Italian regional specialties rather refined prettied versions Italian American favorites   All good works   The majority menu centers around small plates antipasti shared family style   Flavors very complimentary ordering wide variety dishes works   incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness enhanced hints char smoke but brought life spicy chili vinaigrette   Sweet peppers stuffed tangy goat cheese peppery olive oil create very well balanced dish exploding freshness   For seafood antipasti pass lobster arancini   Dressed spicy pomodoro Calabria chili touch herbaceous basil aioli elevates sweetness lobster   Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors     Great selection well made salumi   Try variety   Bresaola finocchiona good any Tuscany   Add selection cheeses perfectly paired condiments Mozzarella citrus chili pesto Parmigiano honey      Small selection pastas   lobster ravioli excellent   Perfectly cooked sheets pasta surrounding chunks barely cooked through lobster perfumed tarragon   Richness richness but works   The only weakness restaurant mains   mustard walnut raisin crusted rack lamb while perfectly cooked dimensional needing more herbaceous lemony gremolata   bone Tuscan rib eye topped sunny side egg did sense    yolk did nothing elevate flavor beef rather giving unpleasant yolky aftertaste cooled   Service work progress   Slow lacking confidence   definitely improve time   Decent wine list Vegas resort prices   Guys admit Giada turned cooking shows   Now chance try food know never cooked   Worthy  <EOR> Love place  food great  Can't wait back  must try antipasti  table bacon wrap dates salami meat lobster ravioli grilled octopus   Did love iPad  more comfortable Menu  iPad kinda confusing   Next time totally skip iPad ask menu  Thank Joseph helping menu  <EOR> Very solid  Some dishes fabulous others standard  Service attentive caring while sometimes long winded  Appropriate Italian restaurant suppose  view strip plus decor  Appropriately priced  <EOR> This hard reservation because Giada's popularity but well worth it!

Anyone? seeing getting tables bussed    helping hostesses seat some parties? Before drinks arrived DIFFERENT hostess yes 5 them least informed table ready drinks delivered dinner table  She asked your cocktail server? boyfriend looked blankly server didn't introduce herself didn't notice if she wore nametag  hostess gave look don't remember server 20 second interaction with?!?!

Every dish except complementary bread nothing write home about   always suspicion all food network chefs attempt outdo each other long forgot cooking food people would rather showcase usually random very pricey list ingredients   watched Giada few times feeling she's basically adding extra sugar Pepsi    IE nothing really wrong but she does kills taste any underlying ingredients   Which exactly meal   always thought beauty Italian food freshness taste few very basic ingredients flour salt egg water   then eggplant sweet peppers say oregano   baked pasta vat melted cheese something resembling 1 2 flat pasta few chunks somewhat undercooked eggplant   Really?  Good thing Giada still did discover truffles!  Tuna sandwich just chunks tuna bunch stuff   daughter's pizzette looked good but she said pizza home better right!    chicken fingers son?  wife looked each other    there something misunderstanding here    expression  We read dessert descriptions sounded all expensive sweet ingredients piled together decided pass  In any case Giada never promised cook Italian nobody dragged restaurant   fault choosing incorrectly  But once again wait staff carried day best trained people ever seen  <EOR> Trust me    great food experiences Las Vegas   Easily headed top ten list   initial greeting final goodbye experienced professionalism good food drink true feeling everyone same page making sure good times happen guests  Giada team all way succeeds thanks all giving times lives! <EOR> Went lunch  Great vibe!

The server annoyed because didn't order cocktails tasting menu    The food good but portions very small even compared other upscale restaurants  girlfriend ordered scallop risotto which literally 4 oz  serving they measure it   rack lamb interestingly half size racks lamb order other restaurants  Which begs question why call *half* rack lamb? tiny appetites wasn't problem but think most people would disappointed if paid $100 two dinner entrees small   My girlfriend's risotto underdone but she really enjoyed it  rice still pretty hard stuck teeth  ordered lamb medium well but received medium rare  sent back came back past point being well done because second time grilling lost most its flavorful juices  well seasoned but little dry   After dinner server then started another round pressure selling time dessert  When said no room dessert she loudly said WHAT? comes Giada doesn't try dessert? Um well new restaurant haven't enough customers establish trend  Another server heard asked wrong she said don't want try Giada's dessert which he shook head said shame  know or hope joking but didn't it  tables close each other bunch other people heard conversation   When check iphone attached when looking cocktails drinks menu ipad  stuff nice but couldn't help but think maybe if cut some those expenses focused little more food service result would better appreciated most customers    Ultimately thought paying little more excellent food famous chef  Instead food only little better average came attached very aggressive service  extra money spent decor fancy electronic gadgets Giada brand name food Giada famous for  <EOR> Went Giada Cromwell last night  place really nice  time 830 reservation didnt seated 10 mins  When table weren't greeted maybe 8 mins  Those things aren't end world just saying  food great  Scallops Crab risotto main course really good  shrimp scampi calamari appetizers very good  Waiter very knowledgeable  Manager touched down table introduce himself   also sat window great view Ceasars Bellagio Vegas strip  Overall good experience   Would recommend would again  <EOR> Food very good fresh but waaay overpriced lousy service incredibly small portions  $26 half portion vegetable bolognese pasta!!! $13 non alcoholic cocktail mostly large cubes ICE!!!

Eventually bus boy said Well could dinner table section try paper menu  said please but he promptly forgot never did   Another bizarre thing    asked dessert cart guy where ladies room was  He said he would walk over it  said no thank you  Again he insisted walking it  figured really must hidden difficult find? he walked over door plain view just off entrance  did require escort   The food flavor quality indeed 5 star but everything else 1 star  PASS  <EOR> Giada wifes favorite TV chef while Vegas  Tough res but well worth it!
