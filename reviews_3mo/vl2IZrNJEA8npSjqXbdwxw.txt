I heard amazing red velvet pancakes friend but never huge red velvet cake fan   Imagine excitement when learned s'more carrot cake pancakes   Imagine excitement double when saw also white chocolate macademia nut pancakes daily specials board    The pancakes excellent really thought couldn't any better   until took bite Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict   eggs cooked perfection pulled pork cabbage amazing  My expectations pretty high but everything tasted twice good sounded  The only downside restaurant really small   1 hour wait when 11 30am Sunday   12 30 1pm slowed down considerably   probably just try going later next time  <EOR> We decided try little cafe strictly based Yelp reviews  happy did  Although wait bit long used waits other happening spots Bagel Cafe Hash House a Go Go Omelet House  20 minutes wasn't bad if starving yes would good    The cafe little couple large parties definitely slowed things down bit  sure if best time come but worth wait   We red velvet pancakes to die for honey french toast deliciously large savory s'mores pancakes divine! We also shared omelet cheese bacon sausage potates    The former Becker restaurant closed maybe take place over there's more seats less wait just thought Overall very happy full! would definitely come back again  cafe quaint feel local's spot which always very nice  definitely once month treat because only imagine many calories associated food tastes heavenly!   Yay Babycakes! <EOR> decided Babycakes part NYE festivities since going north part Vegas most day   Besides couple Groupons use   So gf originally decide let's hit before Aliante sign nye bingo pick tickets Journey cover band playing post bingo Aliante   When Babycakes big surprise place packed 45 minute wait  put name take chance drive Aliante return time brekafast   did take 45 minutes but already called name did call them ask move name lower refused    bummer   so back t Babycakes another 30 minutes    We order Rick's adobo rice pork bennie dshared small stack red velevet pancakes   Service good timely refills food came reasonably fast   The food ?  mixed bag gf's adobo rice didn't notice menu omelet filled fried rice   creativity but didn't quite taste kinda laughed since reminded occasional sunday breakfast take your leftovers night before jam into omelet   The pancakes tasty didn't need whipped cream again creative dish   the pork bennie again creativity did saltiness pork mixed egg but definitely needed more bernaise sauce  potatoes ??  such creative menu potatoes SUCKED !

Opening 7am woke early loaded car arrived restaurant 7 05 early coffee hadn't even finished brewing   Entering restaurant greeted sleepily young Hispanic woman front seated young Hispanic man would also act server throughout meal   water poured menus delivered once coffee tea optioned told would few moments water still boiling coffee still brewing   Low décor sat back watched highlights DeSean Jackson lighting Giants plasma screen until young man returned beverages took orders   With quality service throughout meal coffee refilled frequently water never empty watched restaurant slowly fill half capacity while waited   and vantage point watched kitchen two man operation running griddles grills great speed skill   time just shy 7 30 plates would arrive each warm well prepared accompanied appropriate toppings small plastic cups   The first plate ordered sister short stack Peanut Butter your own combination! pancakes case banana chocolate   Served maple syrup pancakes decent but spectacular mild peanut butter taste within chopped bananas chocolate chips atop   My aunt's selection short stack Red Velvet pancakes topped whipped cream chocolate crumbles served cream cheese syrup would fare better sister's choice albeit largely only because syrup   Cocoa tinged thin somewhat crisp exterior pancakes themselves tasty while addition chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation whipped cream expectedly sweet   cup imagine mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned great idea worked nicely both dish selection   we'd dining Red Velvet pancakes next two days feel obligated note worst group large margin   For choice Carrot Cakes certainly most interesting pancake selections shredded carrots pecans studding batter   Topped more crumbled pecans same lovely syrup served red velvet options actually enjoyed short stack quite bit glad I'd opted less food could sample some mother's choice best meal   Titled Honey Toast described two pieces thick sliced honey toast dipped farm fresh egg wash cooked perfection! Then drizzled sweet honey  Yummy! agree Babycake's assessment prefect yummy   Significant size heft two thick slices toast perfectly caramelized exterior custard within while slowly melting whipped cream honey proved smooth sweet balance without being overly saccharine   While superfluous note house syrup actually quite good reminded Sweet Syrup Camellia Grill New Orleans   Settling modest bill mere $7 50 each tax tip front before making way car bid farewell told come back soon   While admit retrospect rather wish we'd simply gotten some pastries road certainly did dislike Babycakes just wasn't worth special trip   While small café would well suited city Columbus Toledo given quality competition Las Vegas just doesn't stack even if price steal compared options strip I'd much sooner venture Hash House on strip off  <EOR>
