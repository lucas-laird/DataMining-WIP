I used eat Cafe Rio Gilbert Arizona when lived there   place rocks!  LOVE sweet pork!  Tacos Burrito Salad ever great!  LOVE chile con queso!  give ton chips it   Bottled Cokes Mexico!!  This location right across UNLV ton college students which gave fun vibe  <EOR> My boyfriend big fans Cafe Rio usually S  Eastern but since majority day spent University area decided quick stop Tuesday lunch special Coconut grilled shrimp tacos mango sauce   Yes does taste good sounds   I've actually special past seems each time changed something recipe  First shrimp tacos big salmon tacos which used tortilla size between burrito regular taco maybe something size wall clock face? but now tortillas small regular taco sized ones always homemade  Before shrimp coconut incorporated batter where shrimp fried till crunchy but now they're grilled huge pieces shredded coconut them sauce couldn't quite discern   mighty tasty though although missed crunch fried shrimp did prefer flavor factor new shrimp had     The special and pretty much anything else order comes nice helping rice beans which haven't changed much opinion taste fine but definitely aren't preference   black beans much better pinto think but rice reminds more rice pilaf anything else    Among other things I'd recommend salmon taco which prefer cilantro ranch dressing any salads which huge come laid atop burrito sized tortilla melty cheese it   boyfriend loves burritos come served wet enchilada sauce top but kind think burritos overrated enough feed 2 3 people normal appetite  Actually pretty much everything comes proportions enough serve 2 3 people normal appetite but kidding right? Vegas town where locals love food tend eat we're practicing food competition  Take no shame fellow Vegas locals  Life's short enjoy food place tasty Cafe Rio  <EOR> I pulled pork bbq salad recommended  bit sweet side  would say very tasty    Their burritoes pretty good    If ask them kids menu might just give free quesadilla  <EOR> I've enough times free meal 10 times 11th meal free   better places if you're looking bite eat near UNLV  While wouldn't call authentic Mexican food does good lunch  pretty much see place Chipotle 2 0    Their highlight seems pork more specifically pork burrito  savory sweet flavor actually quite tasty  burritos pretty large too  could easily boxed saved second meal  Unfortunately looking gain Freshman 15 back only eaten once  salmon tacos also good choice if you're looking something lighter   Now college student  almost eat weekday lunch daily  Therefore strive cheap but dollar menu cheap  place kinda pricey if off general menu drink  prepared pay $8 10 if do  usually daily special which usually comes around more reasonable $6 7 plus drink it  While daily specials tasty burritos job done me   Keep mind place right across street UNLV  pretty packed over lunch hour  seen line far reaching front entrance 15 min wait   Just tip  <EOR> I Cafe Rio  food good but nothing super authentic  very similar Chipotle except tad more expensive  However ton food your order which good  continue back! <EOR>
