I've lived Silverado Ranch long time constantly hunting good Mexican restaurant  place recently opened Doc Holliday's across Michael's  family checked really liked then took last night  really really good food! Very authentic Mexican food huge portions ridiculously cheap  3 taco combo 2 chicken 1 carne asada came rice beans way more anyone should eat sitting  $6! 3 dinner $23  absolutely cannot find food anywhere else Silverado Ranch   My dad chatted owner place family owned operated  sweet family put blood sweat tears into place  They've painted spruced really nice  clean cozy inside    I gave 4 stars instead 5 simply because its new they're still getting started  I'd really see place well keep going back! <EOR> This place real gem glad checked out  restaurant shares space Doc Holliday's bar but separate very family friendly  restaurant area very cozy only seven tables very modest decor clean  family run business wait staff kids family all very professional knowledgeable  food super fresh hot which way it  portions  good sized  prices fantastic  would paid double still satisfied  back often  <EOR> Awesome food!
