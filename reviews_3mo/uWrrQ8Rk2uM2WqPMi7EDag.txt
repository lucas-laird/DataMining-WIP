I'd strongly suggest Taco Tuesdays and or shredded beef breakfast burrito   greasy Mexican fast food don't expecting anything but that   drive thru super fast always friendly service location   Don't forget Del Scorcho hot sauce! <EOR> Ran use restroom because getting sandwiches Capriotti's which does restroom   grumpy old guy guarding restroom insisted buy something   Ok serve food but kind felt pushed into buying something  medium fry eat sub all say yuck!!  really fry junkie can't turn them down   Never them del taco before definitely again   soggy room temperature  think McDonakd's fry  under seat month would still taste better  <EOR>
