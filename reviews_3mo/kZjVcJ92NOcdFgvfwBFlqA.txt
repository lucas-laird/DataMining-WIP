I Black Door 2 times last week   those familiar pretty new located 10 feet entrance Double Down    Both evenings every person encountered door bar awesome   Friendly cool inviting   place nice vibe  looks cool isn't saturated smoke yet which  plus comfortable    They small stage  2 stripper poles 1 each side stage  am sure if left over when used place held drag queen competitions  story told   When band isn't playing large screen tv above stage playing great music along music videos  nice mix music too    The stage fairly small but great smaller lounge bar  few couches few VIP booth areas several booths around edges well along couch entrance    The bar along rest place cool vibe place hang out  bartender both night cam Ice House  He books bands etc too  Really good guy    Its great concept cool vibe place  When other night tried food pretty impressed  didn't expect food impressive area known dive bars     The prices slightly higher typical area but hope well since concept great   worth checking just  10 drunken steps Double Down your evening complete   Good job Back Door!  The only reason didn't give 5 stars  sound weak venue supposedly part owned Dave Navarro  would expect great sound  less impressive   soundboard behind stage  sure genius thought since  can't hear correctly  adjust sound if behind stage   only thing keeping 5 star review  am hoping fix sound update review 5 stars  <EOR> this place rocks   accidentally stumbled upon while Double Down wanted some food   week right before Black Door officially opened soft opening   busy all manager Lenita took time talk us   she super friendly attentive   blast!  food fun good well priced   bar tender super cool decor fun   next time Vegas we'll back sure   just nice chill place sit back relax least when hella busy   check out!  should say if don't any appreciation 80's hair bands might care much but did  <EOR>
