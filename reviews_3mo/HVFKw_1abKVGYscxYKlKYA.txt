The restaurant located old 50's diner looking building only some look carried inside well  space incredibly loud between blaring 50's music random TV dining room showing Dr Oz some crap volume turned way high  large expanse metal ceiling tiles hard tile floor certainly doesn't help quell any noise fact loud really yell order numbers multiple times customers point gets bit annoying  few tall stools bunch two top tables very loosely placed throughout dining area really lot open space here  menu stacked all things meat award winning Italian beef sandwich sausages hot dogs chicken sandwiches quite number pre designed burgers fries  those looking something bit lighter also offer many salads wraps   As usual kept order fairly simple could really sample basic burger offering Drive In cheese burger cheddar mustard ketchup shredded lettuce tomato mayo red onion Kosher pickles  soon ordered burger saw premade frozen looking patty pulled drawer dropped grill when bit into confirmed exact style  Maybe 'beef' Al's Beef refers more award winning sandwich  Still meat really great char flavor even its overly generic quality  Copious amounts ketchup mustard onions pickles made actually pretty good  bun fresh soft very well proportioned very large burger  recommend keep wrapping gets fairly messy  Overall bit generic burger but still quite good would even consider going back try more adventurous offerings   The fries really good natural cut some crispy skin pieces all cooked well  portion small size sufficient burger but would consider ordering large next time just eat more  all quite shocking expecting when saw patty must say pleasantly surprised  sure quality beef Italian sandwich some other items might bit better but $11 72 fries drink wasn't upset this  price point might little high many keep burgers well below $10 mark but overall size decent quality bad  <EOR> Food good   but missing something    ah beef   italian beef sandwich lil  beef   SMDH   Maybe fault going opening day expecting same consistency al beef Chicago   Yea couldn't even see beef unless opened sandwich   Loaded fries hella good though    Might back if wanna eat light   lol <EOR> Friends told check place few friends decided come eat here!!!
