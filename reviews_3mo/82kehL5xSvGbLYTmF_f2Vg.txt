Very clean but food little pricey side considering taco shop across street  disappointed aguas frescas because menu sound carry different flavors but only horchata jamaica  only reason would buy food again because deliver free since work close by  <EOR> This fairly new place  drove noticed cool name immediately excited try out! Went night very hungry dined it  Overall customer service dine in experience=  Pricey Little flavor Unenthusiastic  horchata tasted if bad     Although did some seriously bomb salsa ! <EOR> We saw cool name decided go  place recently opened  clean service good  crepes banana foster la mode crepes delicious very good sized portion  <EOR> I excited try place out  early work before noon decided check them more time  ta dahh! still business  Lol  mainly excited try crepe banana cream cheese crepe also ordered two burritos lengua asada  appreciate size food its price but taste    Waste money!!   The place itself clean very spacious! only 2 employees 1 kitchen 1 lady takes orders cleans tables  waited 25 mins order didn't mind since wasn't hurry    The burritos consist meat rice beans only  asked lady if guacamole extra charge she said ran guacamole    WHAT?! serve burritos tacos without having guacamole?! only noon! early running stuff! Lol  The crepe? ok  Ive tasted better! When said menu Mexican French twist said myself should good! But nah  Id stick Robertos across street Ihop crepes which same shopping center just satisfy cravings  <EOR>
