Have two days row    Amazing food atmosphere! 3yr old son great time too  Awesome kids menu! can't wait them open lunch! <EOR> Food amazing  atmosphere great well  stoked vegetarian option vegas  wasn't packed when first came but still busy new place  Lucky live near otherwise doubt would heard soon  owners appeared giving directions new employees which great see  only downfall extensive wait time  took more 45 minutes before food ordered  understandable new probably still doing training  Hope slightly faster next time but def back soon! <EOR> As vegetarian am used having maybe two three TOPS items choose restaurants  going into Violette's Vegan Organic Eatery Juice Bar overwhelming best ways  felt kid candy store! Violette's twice privilege mooch off all dining mates' plates both times  such sampled quite bit menu  Some things hits! Others   eh much  thoughts **STARTERS** Wild Buffalo Sticks Coated nice sauce! Reminds Frank's RedHot Sauce favorite  must have  Mediterranean Hummus Platter Fine but bit thin side  I mine thicker  expected pita bread came warmed but alas cold  Still worth trying all comes down personal preference  Grateful Greens Juice am super into juicing but decided try just because! Alas can't say fan but might fault  expecting served cold less thick  Also celery pretty over powering  Nay   **ENTREES** Violette's Southern Comfort wasn't huge fan mac cheeze  vegetarian still consumes dairy find super picky vegan cheeses  While creamy cheeze rather bland  loved crispy tempeh wedges which reminded vegetarian friendly fried chicken  added delicious baked yam side complete soul food comfort meal divine  However probably wouldn't order again due mac cheeze being lackluster  The Hungry Man Dad hates everything he ever orders any restaurant combo faux meats gravy mashed potatoes he LOVED as did I   hearty flavorful   kind meal want order cold day  would order million times over  El Toro Grande friend ordered snuck bite burrito butt  thought maybe didn't savor flavor because only tortilla enchilada sauce but friend reported bland over all  menu reports comes steamed veggies but did not  They didn't appear burrito nor side  sure scoop one  Samurai Burger sister Asian themed burger  sampled patty which firm nice texture  warned served pita bread type bun somewhat difficult eat  Definitely use your fork knife devour tasty open faced sandwich  Mama Mia Delicious eggplant pasta bread greens  serving ginormous! only able try few bites but would probably order myself next time  marinara sauce especially delicious  Taco Trio Love Bowl Consisting three hard shelled tacos each different fillings Taco Trio provided nice variety! cheeze hummus like consistency worked great meal  also included rice salad  Very good!  **DESSERTS** Triple Chocolate Cake moistest chocolate cake ever  menu lying  Everyone needs order cake  Totally Rawesome Cheeze Cake sweet grainy dessert strangely satisfying  supposed come your choice fruit toppings but didn't fresh fruit when visited  No bother good as is! Heavenly Chocolate Mousse Pie Simple mousse pie  pudding crushed graham crackers  fine but don't know if I'd order again because Triple Chocolate Cake 579573 x's better   **SERVICE** The service fine all staff being polite professional  However since visited twice within first week opened could tell still trying into swing things it took servers awhile enter meals computer long waits between ordering food arrival etc    I commend server saw 2nd time went  wish name! addition being vegetarian mom allergic eggs nuts  She particularly worried because some cheezes contain cashews etc  server took time talk chefs sure meal suited mom  Great customer service! I noticed owner present even brought some food! only know she's owner FB page  thought great she working alongside staff  She definitely led example  Nice work!  **COMMENTS** One last word wise Yelp page lists some hours Facebook page others  point unsure if they're open breakfast lunch just dinner 5 00 pm  also closed random day last week  recommend calling ahead ensure they're open before stop by! sister back subsequent visit sad find doors closed even though during listed hours operation  We'll DEFINITELY try again another time! <EOR> Absolutely loved Violette's!  moved Portland last year family looking good vegan food ever since   far best found Vegas!  Seitan wings apps four different entrees all which awesome   And then killer chocolate cake apple pie   good!  Service good Cindy Michael whole staff super friendly   prices also right on     We'll sure back    worth checking whether you're vegan not  <EOR> The atmosphere food wonderful  Prices great staff friendly! only thing prevents giving 5 stars service being slow  seems aren't staffed enough amount guests restaurant any given time  being said restaurant isn't even half full but servers take while your table food takes no less 30 min come out  second time here  definitely back just don't any prior commitments near time come  <EOR> So happy another vegan place town! Food delish interior beautiful! Food took while but still wonderful experience! <EOR> the raw wrap chocolate cake amazing! Ashley best! perfect poster child restaurant! love it <EOR> This spot definitely challenges general assumption vegans eat twigs grass all day   comfort food aspect shines really sets apart others   Herbivores anyone occasionally swings way should add Violette's Vegan grown into decent rotation meatless meals around town   didn't great dinner but think  poor decisions  Red Rock Nachos Waitress recommended   While plentiful filling vegan cheese sauce biggest difference between version typical plate video poker bar just OK   Perhaps melted shredded vegan cheese would superior alternative  Mama Mia eggplant parmesan better thought would be   breading delicious plant based mozzarella substitute being surprisingly good   only minus flimsy overdone pasta   NO clue came over ordering entrée  could've any great Italian eatery!!!  Did check brain door??  Total choke job me   Rarely happens   Figures vegan joint all places!!  Ha! Shangri La Sunset wife's choice only because didn't rice bowl she wanted   Seitan chicken stir fried vegetables decent healthy dish but just longing another veggie place Spring Mountain   grounded she flew out     In end misclicked whole experience wished press reset button   plan getting Hungry Man Samurai Burger Bubba Ke Bubba falafel next time   Hoping back soon right wrongs  <EOR> I originally gave 2 stars due poor customer service upping 3 based some fantastic communication feedback   returning give food another try predict next experience very good first encounter non representative  <EOR> The menu extensive you'll surely find something absolutely love  Perfect non vegans  ordered Hippie Chick Burger fantastic  definitely back order again  also tried falafal sandwich decent side order corn beard  skip those  But everything else survey via spying people's order looked awesome  <EOR> Tried new restaurant second time  food very mediocre overpriced   think concept good just execution terrible   Don't feel return many options Las Vegas  <EOR> I happy see spot show yelp because feel aren't enough vegan vegetarian restaurants Vegas  sick bed ordered over phone boyfriend pick up  ordered samurai burger platter raw cheesecake castaway smoothie  lady spoke made cheesecake sound convincing mentioned fresh fruit top  boyfriend brought food no smoothie  ate burger actually delicious  don't eat red meat anymore nice alternative  came fries soggy bit oily  open box raw cheesecake seems melted no fresh fruit it  ate anyways surprise really yummy  called complain service also mention food really good lol while boyfriend grab smoothie  When he came back he told made fresh take sip isn't very cold  closer room temperature but flavor good  just wish cold  gave 10% off card next time which nice gesture but service needs improved  say lot potential considering food delicious but just need more accurate service even orders  want again but just hope service better next time  <EOR> I really place   husband ordered Samurai burger die for   ordered Tabouli salad wasn't anything special but healthy option would order again  Order dressing side    If service better would given place five stars    Vegans non vegans must give place try! <EOR> What amazing place! lot choices menu peaceful atmosphere nice art place Must Visit! while try Samurai Burger! <EOR> I would give place better review eat very frequently because just moved vegas conveniently located right across street house organic vegan  However service hit miss depending working food same sometimes good sometimes complete opposite  keep coming because convenience but other wise would spend money else where  Today came order $7 95 shake only recieve child's size cup something didn't taste nor size usually recieve when ask server if sizes changed she rudely hands menu tells reference sizes  everyday still no asked name act they've never seen before  would suggest finding another place vegas spend your money  going hunt better service better quality even if drive further  <EOR> Very excited see some vegan comfort food making its way Vegas  those visit LA regularly crave Native Foods Real Food Daily closest runner yet types foods  celebrate opening happily!  My first visit tried REUBEN potato salad  Flavored tempeh bacon delicious  would recommend improving bread quality then I'd give A  Also seem skimpy bacon which best part   Also tried Mac cheese  Huge portion side order while loved think extremely bland normal palette   Maybe needed bit more nooch? Also crumble bread crumbs top more  Weird big dry cubes top  Nice creamy texture   Dessert!!!! choc cake unreal!! moist delicious  must have  Better Red Velvet Cafe imo    Next day back more       Got hippy chip burger club sand  Probably won't try them again  Nothing special  But bacon rocks!!  Lots more menu items try!!! Including breakfast finally!!! Oh Potato salad awesome!! Creamy great crunch onions celery    Cons Day tried order nachos said guac  Really?

Which really odd since Vons plaza!  Lastly service mediocre  Servers friendly but unknowing items currently available again always seems something stock here  preparation time takes your food order quite long  only person kitchen still trying figure things out?  Again happy west side vegan restaurant but based service creativity both decor food most likely drive downtown Sunday morning brunch now on  <EOR> Absolutely adore it  Placed order owner came lit candle table brought complimentary water  Staff adorable!
