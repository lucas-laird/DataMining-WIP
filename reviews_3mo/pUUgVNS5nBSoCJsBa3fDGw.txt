After 2+ year vacancy following closure decent restaurant Jimmy's Cafe before then Summerlin location Mama Jo's FINALLY another tenant seemingly difficult location   SUSHI's other location far LV Valley located 95 Horizon Ridge sense Sushi would try its luck location older part Summerlin   My family visited last night encouraged 50% off coupon received mail consumed quite bit food   can't say anything stood extraordinary but sushi fresh enough kitchen entrees beef teriyaki kids' bento box good usually are   Maybe little sweet Teriyaki sauce   dismayed Short Ribs available   udon noodles ok though remind server supposed come Tempura shrimp so cooked separately    ordered Chirashi sashimi morsels sprinkled atop bowl rice did good job   though may first order since opened!  My only gripe Sushi suppose could reflection age traditional Japanese roots I born Japan Mom native Japanese    2010 seems SUSHI only paired drinking shots sake otherwise boisterous sushi chefs and   well   again show age but whole Gen X and later ambiance   huge 72 screen TV airing video concert sound volume match wall   and back food 3 4 menu seemed attempt come latest greatest mixture cream cheese ponzu sauce different fish roe jalapeno flavors    to justify roll names Cocaine  Something Special #1    Whatever happened traditional JAPANESE sushi   served more tranquil if quite Zen setting?  We'll back since only closest Sushi place home but closest restaurant home any kind   but once would refreshing see Sushi Japanese restaurant strive authenticity instead trying push every frenetic boundary excuse attract next party its establishment   So ahead   call old fogey!  But   this may little telling since Lake Mead location corner Rampart bit removed singles epicenters   and dangerously close blanket *real* elderly clientele much older LOL    and  Del Webb Sun City crowd   would thrilled see Sushi maybe tone down noise level 'flash' try little more subdued quality presentation Japanese food   But  just me  <EOR>
