The restaurant open only week when visited    I tried chicken larb tasted different larb other Thai restaurants  very crunchy dried onion or galangal mixed chicken  sure if crunchy larb another version served some Thai chefs but unexpected  Nonetheless larb didn't much flavor crunchiness might only good thing it   We tried Vietnamese rice dishes pho  also did taste remotely anything they're supposed to  pho broth very sweet not flavorful just sugary sweet spices familiar  entrees weren't bad just very authentic all  If want authentic Vietnamese you'd better off eating elsewhere  <EOR> Great food nice neighborhood atmosphere  Service good  Nice people  Green curry sublime   Yellow almost good  <EOR> Not bad  Kinda empty account them being new think  only dish  Drunken noodle Pad Kee Mao   spicy yummy  seven spiciness   overly fishy   Some Thai places use much fish paste liking   lady takes orders mans front shows little emotion but words nice   can't speak taste pho but looked good    Overall I'd say good place hold over when you're hankering some Thai Vietnamese food  because close house  3 5 stars but rounded up   Prices higher Thai places near here <EOR> Great food! pad see ew portion generous  Friends panang curry tom yum soup loved powerful flavor dishes  Would come again  <EOR>
