Yay!! new sandwich place Town Square can't better Capriotti's   little sandwich shop located old spot Jonny Maguire's   When walk swear same restaurant much changed set except big board menu above kitchen ordering stations     The staff super friendly   seemed excited hope time does take away enthusiasm because genuinely appreciated sincere friendliness     I walked 1pm Tuesday weren't very many people here   disturbing because would HATE them suffer same fate Johnny Maguire's   hoping once more people realize come   Build sandwich come    Anyway ordered small 9 inch turkey all fixings   excitement forgotten tell mall employee but pleasant surprise she made sure ask before finishing transaction   small discount which truly appreciated   Then waited sandwich   employee making sandwiches called couple other people's names then saw standing still waiting   He asked name 2 minutes later sandwich ready surprise large instead small ordered     The best part all freakin delicious sandwich was!  pleasant experience   excited hope longrun! <EOR> Now know all chatter about  Why can't all sandwich places this?! Capriotti's simply different league  Sure price little higher $8 9 wait little longer but due quality ingredients preparation  spot Town Square fairly new packed around 2 weekday  seating area limited few tables counter bar stools facing window   On food itself   Let's begin bread  soft fresh  Just lightly toasted  still warm when unwrap your sub unlike other places slop meat cold bun call good  Italian Sausage sandwich hot peppers wow flavor explosion! meat grilled perfection still very tender  best sandwiches long time  probably regular here  <EOR> It okay  Nothing brag about  average best   Quiznos better  <EOR> I wouldn't come back   This first time Capriotti's am pretty disappointed because everyone tells best sandwich ever had   thinks not   The cashier completely ice cold towards while ordering only spoke wwwwwwheeeeeen finished ordering gave card swipe  When she handed back said nothing started walking away sit down nearby table  Immediately she raises voice says HEY! SIGN FIRST! Maybe because customer service long something pisses off but  address customers  If big deal wait until receipt done printing THEN hand card back same time saying please sign receipt well? ordered Roast Beef without onion added mayo  surprise roast beef shredded   never shredded before when ordered other places? big bummer roast beef very very dry  bread okay but colder side  didn't know if option toasted when ordered if served but cashier could cared less    After buddy ordered he turned said girl such b%$* me! <EOR> I learned Capriotti's when 2012 Yelp Elite Spring Break event   spoke owner reps he gave free sandwich card use next time come back into town!  Sweet!  When did eventually back later year lost card doh! but still sandwich here   Personally all sandwiches tried personally Bobbie best which turkey cranberry stuffing   also tried Capastrami SlawBe Joe which pastrami roast beef respectively   However both sandwiches cole slaw them   not sandwich keep couple days   ate half Bobbie day ordered ate rest next day without refrigeration   Still tasted good!  Any sandwich taste good day bought wins oodles points book     This location Town Square very convenient located upstairs Coffee Bean  <EOR> Well place despite its oddly arranged seating small space going well Town Square  honestly cannot remember before Capriotti's but really remember many unmemorable poorly thought down right bad places opened Town Square? place seems cursed save Yard House  BUT believe Capriotti's survive if only based fact chain delivers good food name people flock no matter what   I happened upon Cap's while shopping today two things mind  1  Getting some food 2  Escaping heat  wandered Cap's entered  place tiny cramped  bar seating few tables  No matter busy place gets going hold many people but noticed lot Capriotti's small places limited seating   I received Capastrami Small small fountain drink which shimmy back place fill up  room exactly person front soda machine prepared wait if place busy    My sandwich came quickly delicious usual  Cap's uses finest meats best ingredients  why sandwiches taste good save burnt Philly Cheese Steak once     If Town Square need quick bite probably now go to  only reason 4 instead 5 stars again tiny space necessity squeeze around people soda fountain  <EOR>
