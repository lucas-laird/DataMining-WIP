Hands down best chicken sandwich ever eaten! <EOR> My friends ate every day week except today because craving Mexican food  place delicious!! order chicken club sandwich also side grilled chicken strips tossed buffalo blue cheese sauce! point!!! <EOR> The Skinny chicken tenders combo pretty delicious! 4 star quality but other menu items only okay 3 5 service quick efficient although cashiers forget ask sauces want  Love ambience  3 value meals little skimpy size chicken but very generous fries 3 5    There some serious things love PDQ  best thing chicken fingers combination   Lightly battered fried tenders especially tender juicy  Only complaint chicken fingers bit smaller size price  hand cut fries pretty good well crisp shoestring sized exterior  tried coleslaw which healthier option instead fries  drink try lemonade which behind counter  happily refill well  found bit strong but when diluted lots ice works well    We tried honey bbq honey mustard sauces which both pretty good    If just item alone joint would 4 stars  However because tried some other lackluster items which prevent bump up    The fried chicken sandwich okay  Although chicken good ratio chicken bun way off  much bun    enough chicken Also when ordered never asked sauce wanted bit plain when it  Definitely ask sauce!   I tried grilled chicken salad which albeit edible pretty mediocre  grilled chicken tastes more generic bit tough dry salty  salad tastes standard iceberg mix bag grocery store slightly dehydrated texture being cut sitting bag while  heavy blueberry dressing which found overly sweet  would probably pass future    I also tried crispy chicken salad honey mustard dressing  Although flavoring salad better still doesn't even rank chicken fingers combination   We also tried brewed iced teas  green tea unpleasant floral tone cannot recommend it  brewed iced tea sweet tea okay albeit bit weakly brewed  Probably would better if mixed iced tea lemonade made yourself Arnold Palmer    This place clean spacious  love fact hands free sink outside bathrooms wash your hands before eating    Service quick efficient when comes out  Ordering does take few minutes though only  2 cashiers    Overall place fried chicken tender combination well priced sauces good  would come back just other items decided weaker  3 5 starred review  <EOR> My second time three days  Love grilled turkey sandwich  Big filet turkey cranberry sauce  Great seasoning  Highly recommended! <EOR> an entirely awesome experience today pdq im current king check in's canes las vegas blvd consider myself bit strips conosuier would  rate over canes fries great self serve 100 flavor coke machine all employees amazing room spotless visually appealing thing no good other side town me I know only 2 locations far town but watch canes better step your game cause somebody nipping your heels!!!! <EOR> We always pretty excited trying new eateries Las Vegas PDQ definitely place should stop good food great price   As walked store front greeted friendly employee opened door stated welcome PDQ!
