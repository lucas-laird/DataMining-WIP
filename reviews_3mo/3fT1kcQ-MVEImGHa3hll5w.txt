Creamy? Peppery? said would try Chipotle Chicken Avocado instead  Husband Original 1762  Mac Cheese side   Before sat down Rey kindly wiped dried counter  later watched observe sun rotate some umbrellas better shade tables  Good guy guy!  I thought sandwiches perfect size  could stopped half but didn't ended feeling quite full finishing  Sometimes restaurants confuse chipotle bbq but isn't case Earl  chipotle smoky flavor tastes little hot without actual spiciness if sense  Husband enjoyed horseradish kick found meat tender fatty cooked perfectly  mac cheese little lackluster missing perfect balance cream cheese  <EOR> What great spot catch quick bite Downtown Summerlin   We greeted every employee all smiles really happy share favorite sandwiches suggestions   ordered Caprese sandwich say surprised amazing quality buffalo mozzarella cheese   balsamic glaze amazing too   Oh! iced tea super fresh too   While ate outside restaurant's franchise owner manager Rey Robledo came speak friendly!  He told try salads next time because produce super fresh   Also he told white bread even better wheat bread would melt mouth son concurred   He loved Italian sandwich too! two great sandwiches chips sodas only set back $14!  Yummmmm! <EOR> I greeted several employees everyone very cheerful helpful  love location service food  fav veggie sandwich  very picky eater ask few alterations always happy it  new lunch spot! <EOR> I liked it! sandwiches nice toasty  flavor good although next time order Montague without sweet sauce  enough seating way hot eat hot sandwich outside  Maybe back when weather cools down  <EOR> Great location owner very friendly  Limited seating inside but plenty space outside long weather nice   Sandwiches excellent perfectly toasted bread spectacular crunch doesn't cut your tongue palate    Customer service great owner meets every customer asks feedback  <EOR> So glad opened Earl's summerlin!!!!!
