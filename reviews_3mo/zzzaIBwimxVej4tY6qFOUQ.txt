 definitely back! <EOR> Guthrie's great choice people fans service quality Raising Cane's!  practically everything Raising Cane's offer but cheaper price   pleasantly surprised quality chicken fingers sweet tea   should definitely check place out! <EOR> After reading all good reviews pretty disappointed visit     We ordered couple box meals come 5 fingers fries slaw toast drink $6 99  food came hot everything tasted pretty good  Chicken moist tender  great sauce which similar Raising Cane's but opinion tad spicier which like  Fries hot crispy toast good little soggy but good slaw well fast food slaw  price decent amount food  fingers little small side but  nothing unusual   I'm giving Guthrie's two stars because service horrible restaurant filthy  ordering never given drink cups  food still no drink cups  counter girl behind running both counter drive thru completely ignores me  cooks back asks need tells stand 2 minutes nothing  decide sit back down wait another 5 minutes still no drink  counter again same gentleman asks need tells yet again actually start mini argument right front busy she can't grab drinks! drive thru may busy but dead inside only other customer also did drinks ordered   fixed doesn't take but 30 seconds grab cup ice   The restaurant also pretty dirty all tables visibly greasy salt some sort trash them  slow seemed inside surprised other reviews mention cleanliness  I'd eat Guthrie's again simply cause food decent price great but when back definitely drive thru visit only! <EOR>
