Afghan style kebabs chicken beef eggplant   No lamb goat BUMMER! beef kabob offerings looked more interesting chicken but allergic beef   chicken kabobs interesting I'd hoped but good   would liked dark slightly oily slightly stringy chicken better   good quality white chicken breast   salad chopped tomato onion cucumber relish both great though  <EOR> Very good place drop lunch  Prices reasonable portions ok  wouldn't kabobs if starving  Cashier very friendly gave free drink being UNLV student no idea if official student discount offer    I ended ordering chicken kabob plate  good but expecting something more juicy tender  Still liked it  beef kabobs probably much better  going drop again try gyros  <EOR>
