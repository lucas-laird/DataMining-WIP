Small comfy cafe style restaurant just above casino  Even better because 2 4 1 entree which made meal even cheaper  Good food  If want big good casual eats great spot  Open 24 7 <EOR> This relatively small diner Four Queens upstairs overlooking casino   party three seated quickly   server friendly efficient but spoke very broken English difficult understand   I felt menu choices somewhat limited   ordered prime rib special $7 95 players club card french dip sandwich reuben sandwich   reuben tasty but little dry served mediocre fries   I used American Casino Guide coupon buy free entree which reduced total soft drinks only $23     Overall I'd say decent average place grab quick bite eat but nothing outstanding  <EOR>
