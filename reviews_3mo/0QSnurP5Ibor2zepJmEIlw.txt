Opening day free food! Thank you  Cheese quesadilla excellent  Daughter enjoyed french fries  Tried red salsa brown salsa  brown pretty good red excellent  Chips okay but tend thinner chip  Restaurant bright clean service fast cheerful overall quality food great  back  <EOR> This particular location changed owners 4 times past year  recently opened Tacos La mexicana really liked it  portions prices pretty good  tried burrito flan delicious  give better idea place going Robertos but bit more scale not much just bit Tip miss lunch special 2 tacos rice bean + soda 6 bucks!!  Apparently well know huaraches! Gotta try them next time! <EOR> Went again food still good respect taste portion seasoning  Ordered supreme burrito   What changed disliked sauces jalepenos weren't readily available middle table against wall when asked jalepenos took freezer back kitchen handed directly   The big deal jalepenos less spicy way  fact boiling them them spicier  might big other people but when order spicy food especially if Mexican food expect lot spiciness  <EOR> This going new spot mexican food  Its brand new hidden treasure two blocks away house   Roberto's crap food very expensive  nickle dime really wanted find new mexican place taste authentic  especially since favorite restaurant chappala's closed last year   Walking place packed no where sit   which eyes very good sign  arent lot places sit maybe 5 tables but every chair taken people chowing down   Once started looking menu gentlemen walked behind counter handed menu  He mentioned could always call ahead then through drive thru pick up  Wait drive thru!? Thats star itself because theres somedays just want mexican food but dont want pjs put any makeup on    I noticed significantly lower other places around which great  prices some items ordered  4 rolled tacos chicken combinations plate included guac lettuce sour cream cheese 6 95  Chicken hard tacos fully loaded!! huge! Completely worth it 1 99  Small horchata 1 50  Pork tamale 1 99 Cheese quesadilla made mexican cheese super huge! Asada burrito beans rice cheese onions meat 4 99   All above delicious  think tamale could bit more flavor but   may just spoiled having cook them myself all time   Everything great portion  leftovers actually  Half quesadilla two chicken tacos two rolled tacos rice beans  came 17 but next time im sure spend less   eyes bigger stomach     The customer service great everyone friendly welcoming  no problem explaining every burrito mentioning biggest items sold are   They salsa bar lots items salsa delicious fresh   I really liked didnt charge use debit card robertos does   would taken more pictures food but inhaled but take positive note <EOR> I've fan original Tacos La Mexicana Decatur Twain some time  thrilled brought all taco goodness closer neck woods second location near Durango Spring Mountain  carnitas tacos just good ones original spot  quality flavor asada better almost any taco shop west side town al pastor wasn't bad either  Tacos pretty cheap $1 39 each  chicken tamale $1 75 pretty good but carnitas should load on  <EOR>
