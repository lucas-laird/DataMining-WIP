As far Denny's go   think pretty much perfect  tried Denny's strip but always way packed  Plus didn't good feeling one  Then googled nearest Denny's found Tropicana staying Excalibur which pretty close headed out  Come find inside casino smelled smoke huge line    So head again couple miles away find little hidden gem  walked no wait seated friendly waitress placed orders almost instantly  short while later food arrived  exactly needed couple days hardcore drinking almost no sleep  Hot fresh tasty greasy food  most importantly cheap  twice during 5 day stay sure stop all future visits  <EOR>
