Not sure where beer pub category yelp but idea  Triple 7 never let down when need quick bite ward off losing streak  Now must say typically don't pay no idea prices are  But food pretty good  sushi also surprisingly good  best choices chili red ale  <EOR> Ordered sampler set! 1oz sample 5 beers cost $5  Much cheaper most brew pub   There 4 regular variety beer + 1 seasonal brew  All beer good  ales smooth hint sweetness taste    I did order food except chips salsa cannot comment food prices  <EOR>
