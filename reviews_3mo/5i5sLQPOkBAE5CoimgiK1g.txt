The painted desert golf club nothing imagined name  I expected golf club north Las Vegas near Piute Counrty club desert  Even pictures website bit deceiving  This course winds through painted desert suburb Vegas  It nice course bit narrow times but touches desert found most every hole  It shorter courses Las Vegas  It gentle scorecard higher handicap players        unless hit ball into houses bordering course      It also bit gentle wallet     some good rates afternoon tee times  There water most par threes making them scenic well challenging  A nice place play feel  good your game  It bit drive highway 95      but your game come alive <EOR>
