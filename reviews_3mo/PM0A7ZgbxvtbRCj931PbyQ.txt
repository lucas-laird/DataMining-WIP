When saw Shabu Grill taking over formerly Match pretty excited closer house Paradise    did however doubts could good Paradise Swish Spring Mountain which also frequent    Spoiler alert right   I must note Grill much more extensive menu Paradise Swish offers only tried Shabu Shabu offering    Many sounded tasty warrant further exploration future   concept behind Shabu works much different any other place to    choose two broths front then some stocked refrigerators choose veggies meat want dip into broth pay go    think could ultimately winning idea provides lot more flexibility experience any other place know offer   downsides 1   Quality meat personally wasn't impressed meat when comparing particularly Paradise   pork just off putting flavor I'd never buy another plate again   Conversely think Paradise amazing Kurobuta pork   beef okay but prefer both Swish Paradise's version  2   rice WASN'T STICKY RICE    don't know just thought some sort crime against humanity   know nothing traditions when comes sticky vs non sticky rice but simply didn't feel right me  3   Lack sauces Grill did offer decent selection spicy sweet mixing sauces table liked but did offer any dipping sauces meat veggies being taken broth    read another review mention ask peanut sauce perhaps them but even if find weird wasnt offered standard   led only downgrade flavor but using dipping sauces also cool down extremely hot food coming broth   4   No alcohol work progress can't really fault them delay but love nice glass wine sake shabu led lessened experience even if fault   Positives different broths though preferred regular lemongrass variety options available great service price very good value much cheaper average visit Paradise       Overall decent shabu experience if Paradise Swish didn't exist compare sure would more impressed   if Yankees Red Sox Rays didnt exist Blue Jays might chance    3 stars! <EOR> So friend curious Shabu Grill all good Yelp reviews   must say everyone right!
