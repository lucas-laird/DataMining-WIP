I'm going pretend some sort sushi aficionado   But I'd think tell difference between good sushi not so good sushi   Mizuya Sushi Saki lounge located within Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino definitely falls into former category   The atmosphere pleasant choose between seat bar view sushi chefs table slightly more relaxed feel  also lounge area enjoying selection sakis but being real saki lover can't comment quality selection   My wife started off cucumber salad which tasty refreshing   did good job cleansing palate upcoming food   ordered spicy tuna California maki rolls salmon yellowfin shrimp nigiri   Everything delicious well presented   total all food should $47 which very reasonable sushi considering fact located within hotel   bonus dined during 3 30pm 5 30pm cocktail hour almost 40% savings order   The service good but complaint  fountain beverages $4 apiece which obscene even hotel restaurant standards   If would known would ordered $5 beer inadequate beer menu   But lack good beers bottled let alone tap endemic rest restaurants visited strip   Otherwise thoroughly enjoyed ourselves would definitely keep place short list places good sushi Vegas Strip  <EOR>
