Well main reason wanted try place because its building   looks 50s style drive in burger joint cute tiny building now Chinese quick eats take delivery restaurant   restaurant delivers within 5 mile radius   also boasts using 100% vegetable oil NO MSG   second reason wanted try because saw sign driving past day served New York style Chinese food   We called ahead ordered General Tso's Chicken $6 95 Chicken w Broccoli $7 50   10 minutes later picked food   inside diner like bit rustic some need updating   might five small tables eat in   kitchen where food cooked almost fully exposed watch all action take place right front you   Calling your order Chinese restaurant isn't really necessary since everytime call order Chinese food don't always say okay 10 minuss sic please take offense am Asian  just silly!      Anyway food home dug in   portions very large   General Tso's Chicken tasty source called yet average  chicken w broccoli good but lacked taste ginger garlic sugar the New York part    However broccoli carrots fresh chicken all tender white meat   When bellies full tins food still looked full!  also must add white rice perfect told fried rice good  comment isn't meant slight restaurant but don't know if we'll order again WAY MANY Chinese restaurants try Chinatown being close us!   FYI late night Chinese eatery close @ 10 30 pm seven days week  <EOR>
