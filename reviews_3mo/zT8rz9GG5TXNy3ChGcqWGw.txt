We just moved Las Vegas Los Angeles couple weeks fine dining decided favorite comfort foods Dominos pizza   Unfortunately regular order years years LA inconceivable folks new local Dominos     The manager literally called argue order   many toppings wouldn't cook right manipulating system asking 4 substitutions Extravaganzza order complicated would confuse cooks   I'm sorry but if your employees can't handle 4 substitutions cook pizza 8 toppings then maybe shouldn't working Dominos   And quite frankly neither should manager calling arguing order instead making sure he sh*t together store   Piss poor customer service   Never ordering again   Probably good thing save them lot confusion  <EOR>
