Is best pizza world?  No   But $5 00 medium 14 cheese pizza $1 00 per topping take it!!  I don't know if true New York pizza but certainly departure national chains   thick crust but crispy thin just right amount good sauce   personally would bit more cheese but friends think perfect just is   sausage pepperoni better other pies delivered locally   This pizza great fresh hot but just good two hours later when there's break action Friday night poker game   perfect food weekends!  The menu says offer wings chicken fingers maybe someday we'll branch stack pizzas Friday night   specialty pizzas calzones strombolis sound incredible   Here's hoping little pizza joint Serene Tamarus sticks around they've already dropped prices two months they've open the menu pizzas tonight new prices  <EOR>
