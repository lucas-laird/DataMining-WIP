I highly recommend restaurant!  no expectations going in   working neighborhood just wanted grab bite   looked promising outside more met expectations   restaurant beautifully decorated warm colors soothing light   playing pleasant music cashier smiled when walked in   quick service restaurant full service atmosphere   menu well ordered found easy pick wanted   ordered grilled chicken plate   cashier told since everything made fresh would brief wait   She gave piece flat bread saw cook baking fresh clay oven told help myself soup salad bar   myself cup soup sat down   soup bread soulfully satisfying  eat lunch often those two things alone better 90% food there   less ten minutes lunch ready                      plate found two carefully butterflied chicken legs spiced char grilled perfection   sat top generous portion perfectly cooked rice   side Greek yogurt package powdered sumac   I'd never sumac before but pretty sure eating every meal now on   garnished grilled roma tomato fresh sprig parsley lemon wedges   all thoughtfully presented professionally executed   best eight dollars ever spent restaurant  <EOR> So happy place just opened down street me!  noticed beautiful pink purple lighted trees outside in   menu simple portions generous   ordered Koobideh kebab side baba ghanoosh   kebabs large served over huge bed rice   Loved grilled tomato also fresh onions   Even radishes good   little heavy fresh parlsey though   meal also included salad soup bar   All ingredients very fresh liked balsamic dressing had   Only complaint items salad bar individually covered which made getting salad bit awkward   hold lids while balancing plate making salad   Also drinks weird location right fron counter   think should put just around cashier don't tell people line 'excuse me' while drink   think should planned little better   But food thoughtfully prepared perfectly spiced fresh bread nice touch   even tried baklava which world!  Portion 1 inch square dollar but just enough   definately going back try more items   hope place does better Bluefire BBQ across parking lot   Great food great value = repeat customer <EOR> I walked man really nice big  Come find know owner reza  food quality service a+  If want Persian food Vegas best  Must try homemade baklava well  <EOR> Awesome food great service lovely atmosphere help yourself hot Persian tea bowl aashe basically lentil stew while wait your food  kabobs excellent but even more importantly RICE good! Don't let yourself miss good Persian rice don't see done well every day prices no reason pass place merit alone   Only sad thing don't seem lamb menu  beef chicken salmon ?!   shame because bet they'd excellent lamb kabob! <EOR> Ever since Mad Pita Express and previously Hummus closed doors turned into Pan Asian looking solid Mediterranean place lunch near work  don't love Pan Asian definitely just miss going quick bite tasty Mediterranean goodness  Everything tried area bit far short lunch break just very good  convinced would just save Mediterranean food dinner weekends  anymore! Today discovered Village Mediterranean Grill    When walked into Village greeted multiple staff members  atmosphere welcoming restaurant bigger inside expected  guy took order very friendly introduced some other staff members  Another little touch thought nice he saw name credit card called name entire time eating  Talk customer service!  I ordered koobideh beef kebab  While waiting food offered some homemade soup brought fresh flat bread  halfway finished first peice bread server came over gripping brand new piece bread some tongs dropped plate  fresh gets! bread AMAZING! bottom slightly charred crunchy but insides warm soft  dipping lentil vegetable soup first but soon just started eating itself  bread alone made trip worth it   The kebabs came accompanied huge pile rice  server recommended sprinke some sumac rice said wouldn't regret it  He right  rice nice moist fine eating itself  even better when mixed some onions radishes sat side plate  Throw all some bread stick piece meat you're golden  beef very tender juicy  Both skewers great flavor worked well rice+sumac mixture  bit lemon juice accented whole meal nicely     I am bit dissapointed didn't see appetizer menu until already sitting down  definitely trying hummus grape leaves next time come in  Each appetizer only $1 99 too  really fan places charging $7 $8 fairly small portion hummus  Two dollars more it  kind glad didn't see those when ordering though because stuffed when finished meal!
