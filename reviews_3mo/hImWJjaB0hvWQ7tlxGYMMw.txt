Googlin' Yellow Paging even Pizzahut com'in        Where hell your phone number  know PizzaHut hasn't gone business because live 2 blocks away yet surprisingly phone number isn't listed anywhere   Buffalo Blue Diamond Rd   I just decided drive instead making phone order asked why aren't listed internet said its first they've asked this   no answer why but didn't matter just wasted time because don't even deliver haha    With aside lady serving very friendly gave fridge magnet phone number it   don't usually pizzahut buy pizza but decided add orders 44 piece wings since large 3 toppings only $10 wings $25 44 piece  Very good deal   Maybe just but regret ordering hottest flavor wings because freaking couldn't handle it   Wings good though but just hot taste lil' 15yr old bratty brother showed eating all it  I'd def come wings but far pizzas damn tasted $10 large pizza   ordered hawaiin toppings which pineapple sausage pepperoni   taste very bland nothing even tad bit tickle taste bud  But thats being cheap day instead going fav local joint Familia Pizzeria   Pizzas PizzaHut lesson learned  <EOR>
