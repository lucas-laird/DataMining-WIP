I'm having really hard time writing review  mean want love place bad  Peruvian as am I close house close mom's house too  why if predisposed loving place only three stars? Read friend   First all place tucked away Marketon shopping center  near Dotty's back corner shopping center  location isn't really issue except parking shopping center pain  Again Marketon shopping center tons families kids stuff  park near burnt down Jack Box because less cars there  Plus egress onto Decatur easier    The food servings generous but they're also expensive  Ceviche Don Beto which regular fish ceviche plus fried seafood stuffs delicious large portion but $18 dish still seemed high  also ordered lomo saltado stir fried steak plus fries rice brother $12  price seemed more accurately match meal food good portion good wasn't expensive!  The service place isn't best take issue that  See expect most low budget restaurants going poor decor such but providing good service free  costs nothing ask food refill drink more carefully wipe down tables  Seriously    Again prices aren't cheap  two ceviches mine plus appetizer drinks you're looking $65 dinner two  would expect more price   Ultimately recommend place based food  good portions hearty too  But lack service high prices really bring place down  come again but now know expect  you  <EOR> The food restaurant  excellent  only thing bothered prices  little high side things when Pollo la brasa wasn't available all!  family other day ordered bistec lo pobre some Arroz chaufa some inca kola   loved way steak tasted almost marinated days  arroz chaufa pretty good well  if hadn't bill would returned  Both entrees 15$ plus drink  ended paying more 35 40$  Again food exellent but if light wallet might want try other peruvian alternatives  <EOR>
