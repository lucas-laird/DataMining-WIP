I waiting place open but am pretty disappointed  prices seem outrageous  $10 juice? first day expected may some disorganization due being brand new but everything seemed order  least 3 employees behind counter    The staff very nice  While looking over menu girls came over us  She wanted answer any questions might but honestly both kind surprised $10 per juice thing  couldn't really past it    Another group walked back again while there  checking menu bit decided leave across street old standby  Prices far more reasonable Protein House think we'll stick them Greens Proteins  juice price higher Whole Foods prices   Crazy! <EOR> I'm really torn writing review   The pro's The staff very friendly knowledgeable  no clue doing guided through whole experience  patient basically deer headlights  The juice really good  wish could remember supposed body but really all healthy  When tasty girl give diet second look  While don't juice eat organic much can  take herbal supplements find way treat any illness natural cure if possible   extent ode healthy life  Other pass double cheeseburger  But again when good want least juice morning   Con's It pre made bottle  it  time efficiency standpoint complete sense but would rather watch being made else why pick Whole Foods  shelf life freshness piece but really need storefront only item pre made? Kind disappointing  $10 bottle  know pay for  sure takes time create plus clean up  sure pounds produce pay everyone all overhead     But $10 bottle high grab everyday  Let's say most days 5 6 days week would adding $3000 your yearly budget juice alone  Crazy  Goodbye Kilimanjaro trip  There's no real seating area  Take juice sandwich salad go  eat buy right away drank juice ate food off hood car parking lot  basically place very health convenience store  expensive healthy convenience store  healthy upscale 7 11 only sells own product   So three stars because juice staff but pre made juice $10 bottle no seating something can't quite wrap head around  <EOR> $11 00 smoothie absolutely outrageous   pure arrogance unrealistic   fruit must picked white people! <EOR> I waiting place open but when left really disappointed  spent 42 00 smoothie 2 drinks truffles  smoothie delicious  truffles absolutely horrible  Then two drinks unicorns blood green absolutely disgusting disappointed because way over priced but chose try them anyway  staff extremely wonderful helpful while there  drinks dessert disliked  <EOR> I very excited try Juice NV since juice home   expected juice made once ordered but apparently juice morning bottle it  shocked put plastic bottles because loss nutrients potential toxins now juice  second shock price  $10 99 +tax?! Wow!  overpriced  Juice NV which really liked but can't see paying $11 00 juice made hours prior put into plastic bottle   The staff person very friendly again liked juice  Just can't see spending dollars they're asking for   too bad support small local businesses  <EOR> So follow couple club promoters Hakkasan  ended going place  all fitness being healthy why give try  First impression place looked nice clean  Staff great even wanted girlfriend take pic baby enter contest  juices thought tasted good only thing dislikes watching made instead bottle  huge disappointment did win picture contest instead gave some hot model probably friend some club promoter something  thought completely unfair everywhere always win pic contest if lose always good photo but seriously photo black white some model lot followers  reason going place anymore  <EOR> Great concepts especially Las Vegas   excited see new juice place but can't say amazing   balance off green juice    much parsley   couldn't finish it     I juice almost daily tend keep quite green without adding apples many fruits   fine green flavors which hard used to   But wasn't good   felt plugging noise down    I loved organic   However prices high   Juices average $10 11   Most places prices system where recycle containers $1 2 off next juice   might missed but didn't see option there    I understand idea no amendments juices because its recipe juices aren't made order but difficult concept just menus   Several places outside Vegas but took little time understand way business  friendly answering questions but its clearly explained menu store   I am quite sold place yet but curious come back   food menu didn't entice but would try smoothies  <EOR> I'm note default stop daily   pricey but believe health worth it   Note coming punch cards earn free juices  <EOR> First visit Juice NV amazing   Being first visit girl behind counter only informed all juice process but gave taste all juices tell juice some best ever had     They use cold press juice which captures more nutrients then regular juicer almost all really amazing   juices never seen anywhere before taste really good     Another amazing thing place only juice fresh order but also several small bottles juices sale which take home 3 day supply REALLY?  I seen anywhere else   small selection fresh foods well but being new working putting together menu   I highly recommend place if into juices disappointed unless don't go     <EOR> Las Vegas' first urban farm stand   Went pick car rental next door brother wanted check out   first wall looked unique names products unsure of   read green finger thinking some kind chicken finger   smoothie  popped most menu board price   thought ridiculously expensive   But hey hell try it     After reading different ingredients each smoothie familiar with   Almond milk strawberries bananas vanilla coconut oil sea salt ice   Almond Delight   definitely delight   Tasty   brother ordered Pineapple Jungle which good but wasn't sure ingredients bee pollen     Because prices told myself wouldn't come back unless something hadn't long time   Well   it happened sooner thought   Returned car couple days later just stop try again   good convenient but extremely pricy   What thought delish!  #YouAreWhatYouDrink #AlmondDelight #HealthyLifeStyle <EOR> I love concept! Coupled friendly knowledgeable staff terrific place tons healthy options! chia seed pudding excellent all juices tried which most   only reason am giving them 4 stars because wish incentive program juice bottles and or offered discount when bought certain amount products  Overall am huge fan  <EOR> If craving fresh squeezed juice place  Comes plastic bottle!  pre juice it  know fresh juice loses its potency longer sits around especially plastic bottle  Ok place says open 7am but 8 doors locked  outside looks closed dark windows no appeal  When walk clean but women behind counter talks biggest thing hit Vegas lol juice plastic bottle no matter try explain me  am LA juicing 20 years  juices start 9 99 bottle up  mind paying money but better see extracting right into cup! 1 star cleanliness mediocre juicing  Whole foods come!! <EOR> Their staff all friendly helpful  very eager help answer any questions might have   I am frequent juicer because just much work juice home    preparation clean just much justify  Which why love juicerys finally opening Vegas   The prices reasonable   around 10$ juice ton options choose from  Unicorn's Blood delicious! see lot people issue fact bottle juices but actually love that  am grab need go  If wanted watch juice made front I'd home    I'll definitely back  <EOR>
