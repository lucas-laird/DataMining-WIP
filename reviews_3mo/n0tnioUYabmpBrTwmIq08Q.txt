I love pub   real nice well lit inside   boys usually come pizza special   half off past 12am large pizza would come 8 bucks which bad because some good pizza! Best thin crust ever tasted     Besides food booze game area 2 pool tables some TV's contain number games  Dont know actually tho  just know touch screen people play games doesn't anything gambling   If wanna play some music there's big jukebox where choose 2 songs per dollar plays through bar     It's hidden near Ann Camino Al Norte across street Smith's  past 10 if try open doors they're locked don't worry closed just gotta buzz in  <EOR>
