Deli? Burger Joint?  Service always lot employees  all seem nice enough but almost every time staff acts if they've never taken order before  Again staff polite but untrained socially awkward   Water charged $1 cup tap water weren't told before paid it  If would known would charged tap water would've gotten soda    This place really wish could like  people making food taking orders seem very nice  also local want succeed but just seems lack focus around menu ingredient quality  know place 12 5 star reviews which think all staff wanted write something realistic help other yelpers food decisions  <EOR> Meh  experienced better  sums experience place  few times tried couple different items pretty much same experience each time   The Goods Friendly service decent wings good crust sauce pizza    The Not So Goods It's kind hard pin point exactly wrong place  servers friendly but don't seem know can't done  Example ask small cup water replied times asked 1 Grab bottle water should fine  2 Sure here's cup use fountain  3 Ok give cup but sure fill soda   AND CHARGED FOUNTAIN SODA ANYWAY I didn't realize until paid     To continue lack consistency even though eat every single time often brought food already boxed if ordered pick delivery  time once ordered pizza server walked pizza box without any plates utensils you might ask why utensils   read later   least attempt cater towards your dine in visitors    Lets talk pizza  am major pizza enthusiast don't believe such thing bad pizza  But never more disappointed pie such long time   I tried supreme pizza outside crust sauce   everything such complete hope mess  just seemed threw numerous frozen vegetables then caked lot cheese top toppings assumed it   peppers onions weren't fully cooked toppings heavy could barely even hold slice without all cheese toppings falling off  why having utensils would nice least some pieces eat pizza cheese toppings bite   This pizza would somewhat passable if only delivered but if dining would expect some kind quality increase since pizza would generally fresher  severely question reviews say best pizza town  understand local establishment but doesn't mean should favorable reviews unfavorable flavors    Is better Digorno? Nope Is better Little Caesars? Sorry   but really  LC though but why would come place lower quality pizza double price LC $8 supreme ?  Despite fact some other food decent mainly wings place heavy weight pizza itself  really wanted great place but #soniamdissapoint   It just seems cusp making damn good pizza hopefully take actual criticism proper adjustments  If anyone wondering why am critical pizza because pizzeria   #idonotproofreadsomyreviewsmightsoundlikegibberish <EOR>
