I pleasantly surprised see Tommy's way back Strip   I haven't Tommy's almost 4 years California trip suddenly it   It 12 30 am friend me  bug going towards bugzapper  headed straight for   something   Unfortunately ate massive amount spinach night before bowels still recovering hey true number 2 without chili sacrilege know!   couldn't afford gas anymore  friend wasn't hungry but made delectable cheese fries anyway   The thing burger DIE generous amounts everything especially pickles   usually other places give 3 little slices    The cheese fries damn good but resist  fries alone substantial size   But where else tasty quality burger meal around 1 am made fresh EVERYTIME?!  Not McDonalds Burger King Sonic   I'm going find myself driving 25 minutes Tommy's cheese fries burger pretty soon  <EOR> Thank God finally opened last year   used speed Barstow hands favorite indulgence   remember following all drama internet ever since moved Vegas   delays uncertainty well worth wait drive North Las Vegas   made excuses drive all way down St  Rose PKWY but now end getting second Vegas location more    this Boulder HWY  <EOR>
