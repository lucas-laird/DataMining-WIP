Smash sauce wasn't anything special mayo mustard sweet relish but snagged some coworker's chipotle mayo slammin  When served bunless don't lettuce wrap which fine but would nice touch    Veggie Frites $2 99 HELL YES  low carb french fry substitute!! happy! Carrots asparagus green beans flash fried oil  Sadly little limp maybe could bake them instead give them more satisfying crunch? but I'd still order them again  pleasing when companies think outside potato!!
