I really excited see Hawaiian Restaurant opening really close house  man disappointment   If you're looking traditional Hawaiian Eatery then place  Dont wrong food good workers friendly but if want Hawaiian food then you're better off somewhere else  If want burrito taco then come try place  Its stuffed Hawaiian Style Meat along fusion toppings   Kind reminded ordering food Chipotle  Good luck business     Sorry dont think back even if across street  <EOR> Came because curious now occupying old Slidin Thru space     Very friendly people offered sample meats could decide   pork very good reminded would actual Luau Hawaii    steak? much       chewed chewed chewed until piece steak lost its flavor felt chewing meat bubblegum  choked down decided steak wasn't thing   Chicken good but any different would Zaba's Chipotle     Ordered Pork Chicken bowl black beans came tasted literally came straight no seasoning detected   portion also seemed small price    twice amount Zaba's  enough dinner leftovers lunch even though bulk cheap rice beans feel am getting good deal when two meals price   Probably wont come back sorry <EOR> As regular original location Rainbow very happy newest location Centennial Hills since much much closer house! Braddah's open inside old Slidin' Thru space usually farily empty when walked in  those never Braddah's best described Hawaiian style Chipotle where create your own burritos bowls salads tacos Hawaiian flavors ingredients   Customers always greeted upon entry they'll always ask if your 1st time here  Say yes you'll samples most popular proteins including Huli Huli chicken Kalua pig  Then decide whether want burrito bowl salad 3 tacos  Once decide pick your protein choose any ingredients want line except guac grilled veggies which additional charge  Even salsas Hawaiian themed such mango roasted corn charred pineapple verde tomato grilled maui onion! also bottled sauces avaiable if need additional kick but never tried them   I usually bowl since seem able pile more toppings which means more food! really recommend coconut bark chips guac pretty darn delicious but you'll need share because never finish extras own top eating own bowl   The staff always very friendly they'll come over check during your meal if you're dining which awesome friendly plus! <EOR> Absolutely loved place  drove way doctors appointment saw sign  excited always try place across town but never made there  decided swing appointment    As soon opened door greeted big aloha   second thought back home  gave sample bowl right away asked though kalua pig  Ono! but since making myself Easter chicken steak tacos  loved fact able order 3 different kinds order no extra charge    The food very favorable very filling  definitely back try other menu items  <EOR> I noticed Braddah's Island Style driving around wanted something different dinner wanted some place new try  Glad stopped try food  workers really friendly asked if ever any locations husband both said no we're newbys  gentlemen handed bowl different types meat try  both instantly fell love pulled pork  ordered salad pulled pork delicious filling    Think outside box try spot! <EOR> I could literally eat food every meal  much better version Chipotle better spice better salsa fresher ingredients    The Huli Huli chicken insane!! crave every day!!  Do forget chocolate coconut bark!! <EOR> I drove last week fiancee actually noticed it  seeing Slidin Thru gone Braddah's its place both immediately intrigued  Yelp checked reviews happy see amazing  Well decided try place dinner today gotta say   the great reviews justified  soon walk immediately greeted employees ask if ever there  Since never obviously said no girl helping gave samples three meats offer pork chicken steak  pork good but tasted typical pulled pork   but chicken steak damn good  chicken nice smoky taste steak tender touch sweetness  couldn't decide worker told mix meats if would like   how awesome that?? She also let sample different salsas   the green pineapple corn both really good mixed those well  rest pretty much assembly line setup pick want  start choosing burrito bowl salad tacos  just throw whatever want  really great experience hope place sticks around location because just plain awesome  customer service great food delicious and filling   a bowl enough two meals! coconut bark great way wrap meal  Nothing better salty sweet chocolate toffee goodness end tasty dinner! <EOR> Ah review 100   Anyway   went Yelp said good close by   Overall basically Chipotle Zabas Qdoba Café Rio Baja Fresh etc style place but Hawaiian flavors   Exactly same   Pick burrito bowl tacos salad then down line pick your pork beef chicken fish veggies assemble various salsas toppings guacamole cheese etc   idea   Nothing new here     That being said difference flavors   meats all Hawaiian style flavors Kalua pig salsas things roasted pineapple which quite tasty   1 difference which coconut bark which basically buttery caramelly chocolate coconut brick quite tasty   food good prices decent although second order because full burrito had   wife both burritos guess depends because mine literally   LITERALLY 2 inches shorter hers   guy those people seemed he tweezers pick off grain rice because he exceeded statutorily allowed amount meat rice while made guy felt little more free it   Funny thing portion control all but when skimping obvious desperately trying shave off strand excess pork customer feel slighted   Anyway suppose if good healthy sized portion should fine 1 entrée price good   food tasty staff all friendly   would give 3 5 stars if could but alas Yelp does allow half stars round case   A hilarious aside   I watched kid fill empty 96 oz bottle apple juice fountain which minute maid apple juice it   No seemed care  <EOR> I came first time drive thru  the popolo girl took order rude  She also forgot coconut bark it  She some attitude when walked showed receipt  She just kept asking if receipt  said just thru drive through she repeated back which she asked if receipt showing her she saw gave bark no apologies  just attitude  <EOR> I've eaten few times original Rainbow location think location improved some things problem other one  far 3 times everything seasoned   felt items lacked flavor other location very shy salt  usually moderate salt if think bland means its being seasoned all     I come kalua pig  best meat option have  tender nice light smokiness it  chicken pretty standard grilled chicken steak soy sugar almost cinnamon flavor it  havent tried fish option yet  dont really going vegetarian think lot flavor comes great kalua pig only meatless other similar spots  If aren't sure ask sample meats   I crunchy items bean sprouts cabbage offer aside standard lettuce much better     The only thing wish spicy salsa  diced onion tomato salsa supposed spicy but hasn't been  offer sliced jalapeno habaneros though but same sauce fold into everything  love stuff spicy would pour all three!
