I know $20 sandwich seems lot but trust me    it worth every penny   Especially when comes 2 lbs meat between 2 slices regular rye bread    I never decide between pastrami corned beef because love both much but Carnegie perfect solution  the Woody Allen  $15 95 half pastrami half corned beef  feed week  strategy take top slices bread skim few slices meat mini sandwich but believe nothing nothing mini it  Slather some russian dressing prepare your mouth heart attack heaven   This best pastrami EVER! <EOR>
