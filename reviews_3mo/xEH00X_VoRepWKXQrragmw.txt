A group friends decided check Mandarin Oriental  really wanted experience Twist but unfortunately open lunch stumbled upon place  really fond setting restaurant much mean arrangement chairs tables back room  just looks empty odd   Anyway waitress decent  Service good but excellent  food other hand disappointing! starving food didn't come until hour later! everyone entrees didn't receive sushi roll dish hr 30 mins later  think waitress completely forgotten order because she asked everyone good right? Ummm  didn't food  upset since she mentioned sushi usually comes first since quick prepare most friends received sushi dish way before everyone else  waitress claims say Asian food authentic Asian chefs preparing it  think  BULL!!!! doesn't taste authentic all    but then again Asian fusion    My friends ordered Kobe Hamburger said delicious  took bite tasted ok  Kobe Hamburger would probably best thing menu  sushi admit very fresh but very much lacking flavor! friends just sip Tom Young Goong soup it  Hot Sour Soup spicy didn't even taste authentic all  fried rice nothing special even worth price  think never set foot restaurant recommend take your time money elsewhere!   Just don't expect much! <EOR> The city center amazing!  Mandarin Oriental hotel  understated well done    you'll shocked wall see when elevator opens 3rd floor   We lunch MOzen very pleased exception to   asked waiter if sandwiches cut half because wanted share he helpfully brought plates each half sandwich   pulled pork good club sandwich interesting though impossible eat because thickness bread   Since also served tiny appetizer along french fries onion rings good value well    That EXCEPT $18 charge two ice teas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  first wondered if maybe ice teas kept bringing being charged separately but bill just said 2 ice teas  no weren't Long Island   Interestingly won't find price charge things soda ice tea anywhere menu   The service excellent food good but won't back   Sneaking charge inexcusable  <EOR> MOzen Bistro its hotel relatively new  everything Las Vegas tends expensive side  dim lighting modern decor restaurant gives air excellence romance  honest really just pay awesome eating environment  food opinion doesn't exactly equal price  But knows? Maybe when add tentative service aesthetics food overall eating experience maybe add price menu  But under no circumstances should pad thai $28  portion moderately small    you'd expect taste fucking amazing  However case!   Enough down side MOzen let's move onto +'s!
