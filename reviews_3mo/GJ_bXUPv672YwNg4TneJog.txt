Don't bother place  trendy but tasteless  <EOR> This place sounded awesome half mexican food half chinese    They also noodle show where see  some guy pull piece dough into noodles    According everything hand pulled noodles supposed excellent texture compared machine made noodles should awesome  super excited idea maybe won't fly china enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore    Well should've taken bad sign when asked waitress dish hand pulled noodles she looked first time she's heard it   She tells Unruly Monk dish should it    Next also ordered beef tongue taco   As waited food watched chef pull noodles then another bad sign  realized he never once successfully finish pulling noodles  Half way he would quit cause he messed up  entire meal he finished making noodles twice but he never brought them kitchen  just sat there  Which made wonder if noodle show just show   When food arrived very sad  16 dollars saddest amount super soggy noodles  texture would described noodles left broth overnight    The tacos okay but totally better ones  downtown LA wayyy better price  9$ two mini tacos?! taste average?!   SAD SAD SAD whether noodles pulled restaurant all around disappointing meal  <EOR> We great Christmas lunch here    Overall food good but nothing rave about  takes some time used having Chinese Mexican same time  recommend rou jia mo street sandwich shrimp mojo lamb potstickers  Papas frites fries excellent well but would order toppings side  Just don't 20 vegetable fried rice   it boring portion tiny definitely worth $16 88!  The main reason giving 5 stars desserts  amazing! mango sticky rice happy buddha gello coconut tapioca balls  all delicious without being sweet    I also loved interior funky mix Mexican Chinese decorations  <EOR> We checking Cosmopolitan accidentaly came across restaurant  When looked menu thought way overpriced but then realized brand new 5 star Las Vegas strip hotel OK  All restaurants LV strip hotel overpriced anyway  Expect order least two dishes per person around $30 because portion really small    We had Guacamole Really good but bit salty  tortillas super good best   tasted far  Twenty veg fried rice The best fried rice ever tasted rice cooked perfectly vegetables super fresh  I am Chinese know fried rice When pigs fly steamed pork buns dimsum style So so  used really fatty part pork can't really taste meat when bite into it  Chicken JiSong  It OK good but impressed  Unruly monk vegetable noodle soup Really good noodles perfectly al dente  soup OK   So among food ordered most impressed fried rice  portion super small $16 but good   Will visit place again another trip Vegas  <EOR> A total disappointment   Food bland small   expect need least 3 dishes per person minimum $30 person eh meal   concept good idea but backless chairs very small tapas style cuisine mediocre food would skip  <EOR> Great concept but way overpriced tiny portions meh flavor   ordered 3 dishes friends glass noodles tuna cerviche tacos shocked small dishes were   would needed order 15 items even 1 4 full   dishes expensive too   Each $10 $15 drinks also pricey   8oz  diet coke $5!  8oz smaller can!  tiny snack ended costing $65     This place supposed chinese mexican fusion but couldn't taste fusion   seems just add avocado any chinese dish call chinese mexican fusion   really disappointed   Skip  <EOR> Great concept food terrible failure! Fusion done wrong!  We ordered 8 items menu each $10 $15 tapas size  Presentation very pretty but taste just lacks flavor texture  Tofu avocado should same plate duck tongue tacos undercooked slimy  Pear juice super watered down    Jose Andres high hopes  unfortunate  may still try Jaleo but visit giving much encouragement! <EOR> The first thing wrong wall  first liked decor  a casual colorful blend Chinese Mexican motifs  Chinese opera masks Oaxacan wood carvings red glass lanterns bicycle wheels ceiling not sure country but cool   also portraits actually large projections switched every few minutes  Frida Kahlo Dalai Lama not Chinese way! random peasants   What pissed off before food even came projecting photo Mao  If running German restaurant would put picture Hitler? Because  basically Mao China  know considered hip trendy use Mao's image cultural icon but MUST STOP    Okay food  next thing wrong brought wrong order  we'd ordered duck tongue tacos brought beef tendon kumamoto oyster  husband took bite realized mistake  and also oyster really off  could smell across table no way should fresh oyster smell strong  Kumamotos favorite oyster am very familiar fresh sweet specimen  wrong    Our server very friendly seemed sharp she took away apology duck tongue  took bite pretty tasty  However couldn't over fact chewing tongue tender flavorful couldn't take another bite    However salsa came tacos DELICOUS  eating spoon since didn't want any more tongue   best salsas ranks Papalote's SF Cancun's Berkeley  Really amazing    The Beijing glass fresh healthy  a big mixture chilled glass noodles veggies  underdressed however finally asked extra dressing which helped lot    The gazpacho big surprise  we expected traditional soup presentation but instead bowl cut fruit server squeezed orange over tableside  delicious jicama dragonfruit mix    We also ordered scallop ceviche recommendation server HUGE disappointment  price $12 think 4 bay scallops tiny   concept cool  they served top limes chiles sugar top  popped scallop followed squeeze sugary spicy lime juice  just underwhelmed because scallops diminutive less stellar  price presentation expect stellar full sized diver freshness    The dessert great  Tres Lychees a play tres leches cake   lychees came three ways  in milk soaked cake whole top cake foam    Our whole lunch bill came $75 still little hungry afterwards  If recommend being extremely judicious your ordering read reviews see what's good maybe stash snack your purse   Some people complained isn't enough fusion menu  but most dishes even if they're listed Mexican  Chinese only twist  discovered twists necessarily explained menu may some big surprises like gazpacho   appreciate restaurant trying  blend two disparate traditions delicious way surprise ingredients use molecular techniques when enhances food  <EOR> Conceptually Chinese Mexican fusion China Poblano billed blending two rich cultures   Located 2nd floor Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden back restaurant certainly eye catching   entryway shaped Buddha Mexican Takeout windows side campy feel palpable but acceptable   interior communal separate dining tables noodle making station wall decorations ranging Chinese Opera Masks Lanterns Luchador Masks Oaxacan carvings interior colorful say least   addition fixed objects also large morphing murals projections famous peasant Chinese Mexican individuals   see restaurant love it or perhaps hate it it certainly over top   Arriving warm soft shells approximately three bites each first tastes taco would come Langosta   Described meaty lobster mango arbol chile sauce $16 2 now $6 e prev flavors good but unfortunately lobster slightly overcooked felt chile sauce overwhelmed subtleties sweet crustacean   Silencio tacos duck tongue rambutan fruit $4 5 e  Unfamiliar rambutan until time impressed fleshy sweet fruit its ability temper salty savory somewhat chewy tongues   While nuanced some other tacos definitely worth checking if only experience ingredients relatively cheap price   The Cochinita tacos described Yucatan style pit barbeque pork marinated onions $4 e good but rather expected unidimensional    Savory sweet pork onions melded nicely but total flavor no better worse good pork taco anywhere else   Carnitas braised baby pig pork rinds spicy salsa verde cruda $4 e prev  braised baby pig perfectly done supple moist flavorful the addition pork rinds added lovely degree crunch saltiness   Tempering other two dishes adding bit spice plus vegetal acidity salsa spicy without being overly so in opinion should serve salsa instead chipotle version tortilla chips   Coctel de Camarones fresh shrimp jumbo lump crab meat tomato avocado $12  Essentially whole lot underwhelming salsa bowl couple snappy sweet shrimp thin shreds crab chunks avocado plus tortillas dunking almost if someone forgot add salt spice vinegar really anything other listed ingredients which simply all impressive quality   Love Air heirloom tomatoes sugar air $8 88 much simpler ingredients much more complex flavor   Nicely presented large bowl must two fresh whole tomatoes splash vinegar dish topped

cabbage radish smoky seasonings inside crispy lace shell   While slightly oily lamb itself impressively cooked bit gamey with mélange vegetables elevated cumin black pepper dish clever tasty obvious contributions both Hispanic Chinese cultures   Ocean Nest scallops crab shrimp pan fried egg noodles seasonal vegetables $10 visit now $22 w king crab lobster would successful yet rather ordinary dish   crispy noodles resting gentle fish broth base three head on shrimp three scallops few chunks crab interspersed bok choy spinach onions flavors all worked textures nicely done at $10 dish steal but lobster don't think I'd recommend current price point unless good deal more seafood   The Unruly Monk hand cut noodles bok choy wild wood ear mushrooms poached egg $16 served enormous bowl perhaps half liter broth boiled bok choy single egg plethora mushrooms dish would nearly mirror experience Ocean Nest a nicely executed dish but no better could made local Chinese restaurant most mid sized cities   In end think verdict still China Poblano willing rule but also ready say concept which exactly is works  While certain dishes worked great effect others merely represented decent versions Americanized ethnic food some simply underwhelming   Looking menu only 2 weeks visit already see many changes given Andres' propensity exploration no doubt menu continue evolve find works doesn't  <EOR> I love Oyamel Jaleo eager see Jose Andres' latest creation really high expectations China Poblano   idea Mexican Chinese fusion would love child two favorite restaurants Oyamel Myers+Chang a funky pan Asian restaurant Boston    decided try Asian side menu China Poblano realized weren't many fusion dishes menu   The good tuna ceviche great soy sauce did think sashimi all! overall flavor combination wouldn't thought liked texture ceviche walnuts   monk's noodles nice texture pleasantly surprised fried rice really distinguished itself your average fried rice   far drinks margarita sea salt foam standard Oyamel still tasty    lemon drop noodles clever tasted your standard lemon drop   Yes bought into cutesy presentation enjoyed it   Also good service   host table seemed bit confused but once seated everyone great   waitress recommended tuna ceviche over scallop ceviche since she thought scallop portion small always candor waitstaff   also mistake bar when she saw drink waste she brought over yay! entire staff very attentive   The bad when pigs fly pork steam buns something texture bao off   Even worse though meat underseasoned   same thing ten treasure noodle soup monk's noodles looked great but broth underwhelming   difficult broth just right Tampopo anyone? but if can't maybe shouldn't offer many noodle soups your menu   I'm willing give China Poblano benefit doubt restaurant only two weeks old when visited   probably eat again    but many restaurants try strip sure when if back   bottom line Jose Andres does fantastic job Mexican cuisine tapas if you're going visit maybe  should stick with   visit China Poblano just left craving visit Myers+Chang Oyamel   didn't take ceviche tacos Oyamel granted before but certainly appreciate them lot more next visit  <EOR> I lived DC while am frequent visitor Jose Andres' restaurants avid fan   really excited try new restaurant Vegas did disappoint!  came group 4 people ordered 11 dishes believe + 2 desserts   few

ceviche which place carmelized key lime   lightly spray vodka eat scallop then squeeze lime into your mouth   Almost taking tequila shot   also thought hand pulled noodles amazing cooked perfection

fusion also enjoyed soup well   We ordered Nice but Naughty dish lotus root pea shoots which doesn't taste very Chinese because pea shoots somewhat raw but enjoyed nonetheless   also enjoyed Chicken Ji Song liked presentation especially fried sweet potato top   tried bunch different tacos think flavorwise liked beef tendon melt your mouth tender but also greasiest taco all them   didn't end order any dim sum because knew could probably eat tastier and cheaper dim sum Chinatown   We ordered flan happy buddha giggling taking bath   flan deliciously creamy easily best flans ever had   happy

Jeez  atmosphere doesnt warrant much price inflation   laid back   wontons suck overcharge because put gold flake them   Tacos good but $4 good  Salt air margaritas tooo salty  <EOR> This place fun love concept but execution culinary wise quite snuff   This interesting concept Take best both culinary cultures blend some create unique dishes  fusion but totally since some dishes remain faithful traditional recipes   We ordered shared family style meant sampled bunch tacos noodles  Some nice hits some really bad misses   Highlights Huitlacoche Noodles always wanted try huitlacoche corn smut fungus integrates seamlessly into Chinese styled dish  However skimped much huitlacoche gave  Also takes flavors well couldn't tell corn itself if just absorbed black bean sauce  Still very tasty though  Pozole love pozole already funny because there's tons hominy dish whereas huitlacoche lacking   twist give Chinese shrimp crackers dip instead  Yum  Dim Sum general all dim sum good but great here   Lowlights Unholy Monk Soup blandest blandest soup evar  Don't monks usually deprive themselves earthly pleasures? Eat you'll feel monk dish deprives all flavor  Don't give alms one  Viva China Tacos oysters  pretty much only oysters fresh raw lemon  When oysters messed any more tend taste funky  rest taco very good  oyster part bad   So while place great concept some dishes just aren't very good  maintain both traditional want mix too  bad dishes very bad good dishes pretty good  guarantee you'll fun though  <EOR> We ended 4 00pm afternoon weekday being turned away both Buffet Cosmopolitan Holsteins   no idea why both closed but regardless 3rd choice dining massively hungry husband busy day running around town all day   As others said every dish except some salads noodle dishes served small plates   Everything massively overpriced however if ordering regular entrees   fan José Andrés since saw 60 minutes last year Anthony Bourdain's Washington DC show activism regarding Child Nutrition Act through Congress recently   He much heart passion food he serves made want come visit restaurants Cosmo eventually   didn't really see heart passion China Poblano   Concept wise cool but execution food doesn't really work   We tried both Chinese Mexican side menu   When Pigs Fly just steamed pork buns   husband ordered liked them but felt weren't memorable   He still misses pork buns Pike Place Market used all time   Har Gau ordered tiny   shrimp okay but because smaller pinky chopped fine believe flavor suffered   supposed pork belly but could taste it   Pancita al Pastor Tacos husband ordered thought highlight meal   bite thought okay favorite part fresh pineapple   Queso Fundido just melted cheese roasted poblanos   While good nothing remarkable it   menu stated supposed white tequila could taste it   Again favorite part poblanos but wish more   Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice okay ordered because concept twenty vegetables intrigued me   thought maybe would rice extremely light fresh   While presentation pretty see picture posted found execution rice very heavy greasy   kind disappointment   happy see added some silky tofu dish obviously created vegans vegetarians mind   inflated price almost $17 00 most expensive overpriced dish meal   My husband's barber apparently cuts hair manager restaurant  While no idea restaurants casinos operate he does work directly under José Andrés but Cosmopolitan directly   might where disconnect far quality food versus price such well known celebrity chef   Maybe José Andrés should visit Vegas more often sure staff knows cook food he puts name seen Charlie Palmer done restaurants when he comes visit every month so  <EOR> While wandering around looking place eat friends stumbled upon China Poblano   Once someone pointed Jose Andres restaurant knew try it   Although didn't think best enjoyed every dish reason another   Like most restaurants China Poblano more tapas style place serve smaller plates intended shared amongst group   Eating manner able try three different dishes  first lamb pot stickers which small size but surprisingly filling   enjoyed crispy lace in essence extra fried bits pan which never bad thing thought well made but overall didn't find them different enough anything before   other hand two types tacos tried both tasty very original   Viva China taco soft beef tendon Kumamoto oyster touch slightly spicy sauce top   oyster real standout softness complemented texture tendon while natural saltiness really added punch dish   other taco tried Pancita al Pastor which slow cooked pork belly pineapple   If know know love pork belly big winner   saltiness tender pork belly balanced well sweetness pineapple made great dish   We also ordered some drinks   shared cold tea two which mixture green tea tequila beer   presentation nice comes tea pot served couple nice glasses but flavor bit off   Although found refreshing drink thought added bit much lemon wished more green tea flavor   Another friend ordered lemon drop soup lemon vodka drink lemon noodles made gelatin like substance   also seemed very refreshing noodles interesting touch   Overall really enjoyed lunch China Poblano   Although little expensive normal lunch spending $25 share 3 dishes drink Jose Andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable   Although wasn't quite good enough break into 4 star territory felt more 3 5 would definitely recommend checking if fan if just looking something different try  <EOR> Like 4 47 rounded all way because Lakers 4 game winning streak    I came China Poblano during its opening week  couple feet ahead front restaurant Big Papi himself Jose Andres  Wearing baby blue tweeting Blackberry eating looked every single dish menu teaching three daughters sitting descending order height use chopsticks cute        Anyway food  bottom line any restaurant final product  flavors textures temperature contrasts all good shit working unison evoke memories tell new stories  Value ambiance service stuff's nice but going knock off stars any restaurant if waitress didn't fill cup coffee six times if couldn't understand gibberish coming Filipino waitress' mouth  Notably ambiance service restaurant super chill like 5 5 chill     Having said food generally very good too  We ordered guacamole fried potatoes XO chicken mole tacos lemon tree shrimp some other stuff can't remember right now  ocean nest fine too  dessert menu didn't excite but drinks made salt air margarita sal de gusano margarita   Also Jose gangster enough seat during meal! sure good time  Check out  <EOR> This place blows just Chinatown tacos y Mexico saw people sit down look ay menu leave  server seem busy times care  joint hella Faillllllllllllllll <EOR> Wow!  Amazing chef Jose Andres sure knows fuse cuisine   If you're Vegas worth trying   Although inside Cosmopolitan would never know!  hotel Restaurant never great   love poblano sauce! <EOR> My boyfriend stumbled getting lost maze Cosmopolitan hotel finding 10pm many places open surprising since Vegas    looked promising   expecting little fancy schmancy meal price wise portion wise but shock   Extremely pricey extrememely small protion sizes   understand whole tapas concept but tapas barely enough person share himself let alone TWO whole people   ordered scallop ceviche which unbeknownst deconstructed   believe $16 plate consisting 4 parboiled baby scallops large bay scallop think size little bouncy ball quarter machine each sitting half key lime sprinkled looked paprika top   tasted parboiled scallop sitting top dry lime sprinkled something flavorless top   cringed ate each scallop thinking worth $4 even Vegas ESPECIALLY Vegas   Next came carnitas tacos   2 tiny street size tacos which admit very tasty but again very tiny filling all   point dying   Then came pork siu mai save day   believe cheaper menu items but twice much food first 3 plates combined   really tasty could tell hand made   little dumplings saviors least could leave feeling ate something pass starvation way door   expected little more food flavor decor bill presented with    said won't coming back wish never came  <EOR> The food good although servings little small price  interesting fusion Mexican food Chinese food  Oddly items ordered did actually well together! Fried Wontons sooo yummy! Queso Fundido basically just your own quesadilla    but cheese good! Mongolian Beef Lettuce good but slices meat really small!     Give try but prepared pay little more if trying full because need order few plates  <EOR> every thing ordered loved  Chef Jose Andres knows right like trendy Bazaar restaurant L A  Very casual  Remember tapas style place most dishes small  Order cochinitas the best BBQ steamed buns  Lotus pea shoot dish surprising good  Noodle bowls good but large   Cocktail Singapore sling fantastic  warning guys drink comes dainty umbrella  <EOR>
