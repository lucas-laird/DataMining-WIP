I pretty pleased food here   The layout somewhat awkward seated little room feels little offshoot actual restaurant but privacy views bar strip   I started wedge salad topped bleu cheese bacon pear  think pear kind afterthought necessary salad  enjoyed dressing quite bit but hoped more bleu cheese crumbles bacon slightly more crisp  Then ribeye steak smothered bleu cheese side mushrooms  prepared perfectly very happy flavors textures  nice piece meat  Overall pretty happy meal    I liken restaurant more upscale cafe restaurant even though know don't want thought way  prices slightly higher cafe but atmosphere dining hours definitely resemble cafe  guess call hybrid   The food pretty good but prices little higher would pay cafe think deserves 3 stars  Luckily didn't pay   Not sure going way come back but if you're area looking some grub hours then it  many other better food options I'd last resort  <EOR> Went NYE know kitchen staff stretched limit  NEVERTHELESS food drinks fantastic  Cosmopolitan figuring namesake never wrong  fantastic best Cosmo years  food superb all five dishes being excellent well priced Strip  crab appetizer fantastic prime rib great fish truly excellent  great place people watching if doesn't suffice there's ton big screen TV's  drinks strong  <EOR> the late night breakfast very good   all could stop moaning pleasure over potato cakes  <EOR> Was just fellow yelper Lila H  when Vegas past weekend     Overall experience bad   but definitely better brunch elsewhere fraction price paid  incredibly empty stomach hunger clawing angry animal but considering food usually tastes phenomenal when you're starving Henry didn't quite quench hunger  Sure stomach full afterwards but other filling empty void mouth tastebuds left wanting more   Lila H  ordered Henry burger which she ate open faced  She said without buns burger really wasn't special  fries came though delicious  quite shoestring but skinny enough   As famished ordered caesar salad short rib benedict side truffle tater tots    Caesar salad okay lacked spiciness think Caesars need considered superb    Short rib benedict recommended waitress when couldn't decision between two entrees fyi always love ask waitstaff like    i wasn't really disappointed but felt sauce created short rib could little bit sweetness it  Maybe because when think short rib think Korean version galbi but something definitely missing fell short culinary excellence  meat itself moist succulent eggs poached perfectly but overall dish lacked certain je ne sais quoi  Also addition potato base think would've addition some sort bread   My favorite part meal truffle tater tots! absolutely love love love truffle flavored anything tater tots healthy dose truffle fried right into them  Lila H  thought truffly but absolutely loved it  truffle flavor aromatic could smell taste simultaneously every bite tater tots fried perfect crispity crunch  <EOR> Solid French Dip sandwich truffle tater tots! Very attentive service  Perhaps best all open 24 7 <EOR> After long painful night walking around heels henrys closest place grab bite  food good but amazing remember  waiter although very tentative kept forgetting bring hot tea having ask 3 different times  weren't busy couldn't really understand hold up  did close if bars where played throw back music 80s top 40s 90s  <EOR> Had wait few minutes seated    food good but sure if best hang over food  much prefer something soupy noodle y asian night hardcore drinking  hostess pretty definite plus! waiters polite but think service bit slow  Took while food come time back hotel room which Cosmo pick wallet which forgotten time came back food still yet  Even drinks took while which shouldn't case since those don't even take pre time really   I Signature Short Rib Benedict braised short ribs hollandaise crispy potato cakes  good but flavor little off some reason maybe taste buds hadn't recovered night before knows?!  When left though saw bunch open seats even waiting open spots but said preparing table already  guess just took while prepare drinks took them while prepare table too  <EOR> The selection wasn't huge but less better when you're deciding 2 am right? Henry delicious open just getting hunger dizzies long days indulgence   I stuck opted chicken salad sandwhich seed encrusted berry toasted bread truffle tots  chose unwisely first fruit cup which way small  Just choose tots run off Strip morning did  You'll pleased   Overall reasonable prices quality sandwhich service quite good  <EOR> Friendly service good food combine provide pleasant surprise Aria  fish chips  cod flavorful white plentiful  dish served fries sure satisfy your salt cravings  He veggie burger likes we'd never seen  Actual chopped veggies held together egg milk bread crumbs concoction some sort  truffle tator tots delight  good value Vegas  <EOR> so while staying vegas happened staying cosmopolitan  its regular dinner food maybe little upgrade  fish chips which substitute fries tater tots  food itself but service kinda slow most attentive  three nights row each time service kinda slow  but tater tots die hahaha truffle tater tots cooked perfect crunch       if come during weekend bar across plays music really loud if your looking place able talk night clubbing might best idea  overall its cool place just needs servers more attentive   and yes during times restaurant wasnt crowded times where all servers gathered bar stood chit chatting backs towards customers  tsk tsk best practice  <EOR> Food pretty good  2 hrs dead ends only thing could find open sunday night some food believe not   Little bit pricey though  <EOR> The only reason place two stars freshly squeezed orange juice  food pricey taste leaves much desired  think might better off finding 2 99 steak eggs rather spending upwards $50 breakfast here! <EOR> If want somewhere lunch dinner isn't going break bank wearing casual clothes decent food then Henry   When 4 walked 6 30pm thought sure going line probably able in   Nope!

Drunk people deserve quality food too! <EOR> my only complaint henry hard find us   came aria no signs cosmopolitan aria   once inside cosmopolitan no signs henry   sign said restaurants but pointed all saints store!  we brunch thought good!  the service wasnt bad but wasnt stellar either     i soup day which prime rib soup seasonal veggies   when came bright red skeptical   actually more beet prime rib soup   actually pretty good   henry which just normal breakfast 3 eggs meat potatoes which subbed fruit  asked sausage links but im 50% sure gave chicken sausage instead   wasnt picky ate anyways  <EOR> Best hotel coffee shop Vegas  Bar none truffle oil tater totts rock ! <EOR> The Henry conveniently located North East entrance Cosmopolitan front flashy bar crystals glistening pink lights center   elegantly decorated reminded Henri Bendels   chairs looked uncomfortable sit but weren't    The food awesome!  ordered crab cakes french onion soup Belgium waffles omelette made order choice tomatoes ham onions   Maryland Blue crab cake came circular cake but full real crab meat just enough pommery dressing top   French onion soup came very hot steamy just way lot cheese top!  awesome   broth lot flavor cooked onions   omelette wasn't great because egg overdone didn't order best ingredients omelette   Overall location vibe decorations food FOUR star worthy FIVE star worthy hotel  <EOR> Very lame service food barely palatable  Only decent dish among 5 different orders short rib eggs benedict  Service very worst encountered during 4 days Vegas  Gruff busboys clueless servers  Kitchen 2 orders wrong  Restaurant only three months old  Stay away least next year  <EOR> Went breakfast 10 30 little more half full would expected impeccable service but sorely disappointed   must say least breakfast menu os fantastic   food did exceed expectations   Overcharged but waiter politely corrected bill   Very slow service meal delivered fact totally ignored empty water glasses coffee mimosas until begged bill   service committee least five different people bringing food   Didnt know hols accountable   Menu 5 stars Foood 3+ stars Service 2 stars  Host excelent very accommodating  Likely return breakfast yes   think better wiill give some other items menu try  <EOR> We brunch Sunday  appreciated still served breakfast items 2 00pm afternoon  options great everything basic eggs bacon delicious sounding french toast  also great cocktail menu   To drink ordered twist bloody mary made garlic vodka basil  Very yummy! entree opted signature short rib hash  short ribs perfectly done super tender  major props eggs being perfectly done just right amount firm runny  date wouldn't stop raving whatever he ordered   The service slow wasn't busy restaurant all  But food great enough didn't really mind   So based brunch experience definitely returning try other menu items   And really liked atmosphere decor too  <EOR> Decent food  Pretty setting    The Henry Cosmo's version coffee shop diner little bit more pizazz much nicer booths  decor food slightly elevated your typical Vegas coffee shop    Decor probably best part  Very luscious booths nice comfy chairs   Gorgeous light fixtures!  tables along outer edge space near entry way separated rest hotel any glass making some great people watching folks walk coming hotel's street entrance   The food itself bit disappointing  Its just good you're expecting based decor  lot potential ambitious goals revamped classics goal  menu definitely classic trying revamped but its knock your socks off good  lot places managing classics way place trying accomplish   But gonna totally dis place give them benefit doubt   The hotel hasn't open long hopefully they'll keep working food   As actually eaten prime rib plate which comes mashed potatoes horseradish sauce au jus   decent hit craving having moment   dining partner pot roast which she said wasn't exactly she thought was   but I'd take comment grain salt since palette dining experience pretty limited  She thought she getting something carved hunk meat but something more thick beef stew    in menu described braised short ribs looked sounds like     The free breadsticks dinner super nice soft warm! Perfect butter!  mojito alright    Prices expected cheap but outrageous     Service adequate  Actually guess bit fake?  dining partner the boss lady wanted some sort cocktail but she wasn't sure she wanted she doesn't really drink anything other girly fruity drinks she asked waiter recommendation  He didn't he asked she liked  like specific fruit your fruity drinks  She told she wanted something raspberries  He said he would bartenders something raspberries vodka just    He came back drink dragonfruit straight off menu!  He told bartender thought she might better based he reported she liked!!! Fake! Whatevs dude! She all impressed thought sweet    I just dumb totally true   The bartender refused something off menu  Please  Anyways its minor but thought lame  Just honest!  Someone more attentive would pleased that    Pros Breadsticks decor people watching comfort foods simple familiar items quality ingredients   Cons No bathroom resto itself you'll exit use casino level bathrooms    Great stable place eat if you're frequenting Cosmo  worth special trip just place  <EOR> I came brunch other two members 3 musketeers while Vegas round mid morning drinking Cosmopolitan   all starving getting really drunk drinking empty stomachs making less less picky where eat   seated right away given some water drink browsed menu   What ordered JH Huevos Rancheros BB Reuben sandwich rye tater tots  Me Chicken salad sandwich fruit  3 mimosas  Mimosas really good good mix juice champagne   Didn't taste cheap stuff some places use mimosas   Huevos rancheros pretty flavorful but wasn't big fan end portion JH traded other half sandwich finished well     Chicken salad sandwich really good first thought ordering chicken salad when saw kind wtheck   bread used tastyyyyy cranberries baked into bread really complemented chicken salad well   fresh fruit came side pretty good raspberries usually raspberries taste bland sour but sweet tart     Reuben sandwich really flavorful surprisingly delicious  Although don't tend sandwiches don't veggies inside     Service good prompt nothing special   Overall would definitely come back if ever Vegas want quick bite eat without having break bank McDonalds something  <EOR>
