Even though hit all 5 stars feel spot going even MORE amazing short time should yourself over asap! husband great time well enjoy wonderful food    As soon walked knew place exemplified example shabu shabu subject matter experts haha  Anton owner knows restaurant food team  beautiful art mirrors artfully tiled walls ambiance immersive enjoyable music entertaining television knew came right place  many places visit back home Orange County but when saw Las Vegas where live now eyes opened mouths dropped LOL! Yay! Shabu Shabu!!  Denise first say hello accommodated immediately soon walked in  She very approachable over all menu details us  husband needed Shabu Shabu protocol refresher since while since he said cuisine Denise great presenting manner which food served us    As Denise prepped broth Carl came offered drinks  He eagerly shared excited start serving libations soon kindly apologized having upcoming saketinis just yet  No apology needed  We're coming back when do!

We'll back  Sorry didn't meet chefs back there  deserve big thank well  Your rice point perfect! We'll back! Best success luck Yojie's! <EOR> 3 7865 stars   I honestly wasn't fan here  Maybe  why never tried DTLA location  portions everything tiny eat off left overs friend's portion  Best part eating place meeting Philip T!   This shabu place set bar didn't it  Maybe also family style hot pot? guess hip new modern shabu shabu    The customer service great attentive but little smothering  understand soft opening but being asked how's food every 10 minutes does much  really did waitress through whole entire menu since we're first timers Yojie    I ordered sukiyaki pasteurized egg Yojie cut geisha size  broth honestly way sweet taste  even diluted water  really did egg all condiments mixed it!  wish order spicy miso Jen Z  ! broth much more savory rich mine  switch meal  portions everything very small  pretty much ate everything mine finished off all Jen Z's veggies noodles feel full  quality meats superb fresh!   I'm really glad finally try place maybe check LA location family style shabu shabu  <EOR> The Skinny although quality product okay meager portions price  flavor broth sauce alright  3 service ambience modern service okay but easily overwhelmed 3 value all its nickel dime tactics value just isn't there  If must try place come lunch  charge extra dinner without adding any value 3    FYI Yojie located close Tropical Smoothie cafe Viva Mercado's    Walking into restaurant 2 guests eating lunch around 11 30 am  required sign even though no wait  weird because took few minutes anyone notice came in    Regardless seated promptly menu explained us  quite few options meat but pricing based size your protein portion  most things menu sizes only 5oz geisha 7oz samurai   Only Yojie cut 4 sizing options 3 oz 5 oz 7oz 10oz   comes white brown rice bowl vegetables noodles   Kombu broth water seaweed standard but charge extra sukiyaki spicy miso tonkotsu broth $2 $2 $3 respectively   Sukiyaki comes egg while other broths come 2 3 dipping sauces which ponzu goma sesame sweet savory apparently ginger teriyaki sauce   Extra sauce rice veggies cost extra    We ordered Yojie cut Sumo sized $20 99 lunch kurobuta pork Samurai sized $17 99 spicy miso tonkotsu broth    The Yojie cut medium marbling  unimpressed left really huge chunk fat end pieces meat I understand can't control huge chunk fat middle   If paying weight meat needs properly trimmed  kurobuta pork tasted good but really fatty well    The spicy miso broth tonkotsu broth made alkaline water!    Sorry bit sarcasm both okay but doesn't compare any half decent ramen joint terms flavor even all cooking done  worth premium    Tried goma ponzu impressed The goma sesame sauce bit earthy can't think another word tastes  ponzu lacked true citrus flavor acidity yuzu which made rather pedestrian    The side rice vegetables really disappointing portion size  vegetable bowl looks pretty but really isn't alot there  total half slice onion 2 small Napa cabbage leaves cut into 4 4 spinach leaves half small carrot 1 shitake mushroom 1 mouth sized amount enoki 2 small pieces broccoli 2 bite size pieces tofu 4 udon noodles 5 pieces rice noodles  Oh small bite pickled daikon seaweed thrown there    They also only give half bowl rice    Service very attentive beginning when only 2 people other joint  However once 6 people restaurant service became spotty water refills  when least 2 servers restaurant!   Ambience modern hipster ventilation good but difficult hear music background    Our total lunch 2 $48 tax no drinks dessert  food okay books definitely better  Considering portion sizing taste level service prices exorbitant  Given premium charge dinner for no reason! becomes even more insane  Pass place 3 starred review   <EOR> Fantastic experience! servers made visit extremely enjoyable  cuts great attention detail great attitude great atmosphere great! definitely see bright future branch!
