Thai Noodle House unassuming but delicious little place across street Chinatown shopping center  noodles solid potstickers crispy house sauce  friend ordered papaya salad which he brazenly asked extra spicy  Thais know spicy taken lightly  crying couldn't even finish dish but then again little white pussies  But kudos place giving we'd asked  all getting authentic eating experience exchange 20 minutes shitting fire  fair trade opinion  Isn't why God invented ass cream? <EOR>
