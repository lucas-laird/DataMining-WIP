I disappointed when little BBQ place once occupied space closed perplexed when noticed new Mexican restaurant opening its place  Roberto's recently opened same small shopping center  Why would choose set shop close competition? turns Roberto's no competition all  boyfriend decided check new shop see if menu looked any good  back plan    If menu sucks we'll Roberto's  walked checked menu through window I hate walking into small businesses making eye contact prideful business owner walking out  feel bad REALLY bad    All took two words boyfriend sold wet burrito  already seen few things looked tasty including some fresh salads fajitas quesadillas tacos nachos combo plates  went    We greeted super friendly guy all smiles  He great energy could tell he passionate food  Upon further inspection menu discovered something sinful amazing agreed no way getting without giving try    Fries  Fries? Yes  Fries  Fries covered cheese beans cream guacamole Mexican salsa your choice chicken steak shrimp  YUM! final order wet steak burrito dry steak burrito order steak fries  knew going ton food but no idea store us  food two regular drinks came $25 00  might seem kind pricey but fries appetizer  meal two themselves  placing order he immediately work preparing food  kitchen very clean everything prepared fresh order  swear nearly entire cow grill  much beef    As he cooking carried conversation  asked business going he said Everyday gets better  three weeks we're doing good  He also shared another location near Boulevard Mall open 11 years  Then asked dreaded question Roberto's giving guys some competition? reply simple No followed big smile  said your food good huh? Again he smiled nodded    The food indeed good  steak fries came first immediately work devouring delicious mountain yummy goodness  burritos arrived moved outdoor seating  honest  never made burrito but boyfriend did he says delicious  He asked night week should Rivas night already planning becoming regulars  ask boxes can't wait until lunch tomorrow when try burrito  <EOR> I check food excellent  Restaurant quality hole wall prices  <EOR> Large portions  Food cooked order greasy  disappointed  reviews saw neighbors correct  could finish portions restaurant quality  meat cooked order  Some places meat precooked  super nachos rocked it! <EOR> Best steak burrito steak fries  Very fresh doesn't leave feeling greasy gross afterwards like Roberto's   may little bit more your average taco shop but quality ingredients very apparent!
