After having craving fried rice checked Restaurant com see if could find any great discounts eat  Yummy House several gift certificates purchase  $10 off certificate order over $20    We order 2 dinner specials  Mongolian Beef $10 95 Schezwan Shrimp $12 95   start off Egg Drop Soup which best long time  nothing added no corn other vegetables no tofu just nice thick egg soup  received appetizer crab Rangoon jumbo shrimp very delicious well  order came wrong brought chicken instead shrimp but looked delicious didn't bother them fix it  waiter offered several times even bring side order shrimp it  But fine adjusted price check  fried rice best part meal  ham chicken shrimp it  MMMM Delicious!!   Everything little bit oily but very tasty  waiter Tommy very very friendly  He explained everything made fresh sauces packages  turns red bell pepper Mongolian Beef still UPC sticker it  Now Mongolian Beef wasn't favorite  any kind before  barely touched didn't take go    We ordered Boba Tea Mango flavor loved but honey thought sweet  waiter said he adds sugar could always ask less if sweet  drink cost $2 95 if buy China Town same size nearly $6  nice stop just alone    The restaurant very hot  Particularly seating off right side when walk in  moved first booth closest door directly under fan very comfortable    I would definitely liked stop again future soup fried rice boba tea  I'd love see orange chicken is    Oh deliver $2  <EOR> One star taste having $5 50 lunch combos include fried rice crab rangoon bowl egg soup  when most places won't give soup orders   Three days ago printed Restaurant com coupon try place near office he told stopped taking coupon two days ago   frustrating!  Good customer service would included apology maybe offer something free thank trying them anyway but he just said Nope  should walked but cheap lunch specials pulled two co workers each tried different combo   The crab rangoons best part meal but everything else lackluster won't again   The orange chicken big medallions breaded chicken not little nuggets reviewed blah    cashew chicken nice little shreds grilled chicken but good other places    general chicken tasted sweet sour sauce little chili pepper thrown heat  very disappointing!  The spring rolls cooked oil should changed   fried rice tasted burnt want say nothing but rice     but literally searched whole pile did uncover fleck egg two dice white onion wafer thin slice bok choy   must minimalist mantra because egg soup nothing added either   The service friendly food fast   waited food cashier telling friend across room much he partied last night threw all over bathroom couldn't he just slept top toilet  office look non fast food Chinese somewhere else   Update restaurant com coupon still being sold   wonder many people being cheated bait and switch scam? <EOR> One star quantity portion   Really thats it   Im always trying new asian food around neck woods  Well thought struck gold when saw all asian restaurant  Very rarely find thai food chinese normally its other    Well craving pad thai  well ended looking asian spaghetti  Which didnt EGG rest ingredients looking sure hell didnt taste pad thai     Lets just say I'd rather travel distance thai food rather going here  <EOR>
