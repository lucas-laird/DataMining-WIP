If nachos definitely satisfy craving  cheese freshly melted guacamole awesome  good  sister ordered chicken fingers  other hand bad  seemed fried twice resembled fried shrimp  Fries bad  <EOR> I chicken patty burger great but place three stars cuz fries tasted old stale  wasn't just mine everyone table same nasty tasting fries <EOR> TAP Sports Bar just opened month ago   located MGM towards back casino parallel Sports book   very nice open space lots TV's watch all games action   Definitely good spot especially if all chairs sports book full   They good menu plenty yummy eats drinks   kinda late when arrived 5min order because kitchen closes 11pm     Fries Gravy http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw  bowl huge   fries fried cheese curds those brown pudgy looking ones   gravy decent taste   Could used bit more though   Braised Bacon Corn Dogs http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#WaZNbNTffH30OujvBDx6IQ confused bit sure expect   Instead hot dog felt eating stick corned beef wrapped bacon   Whatever though pretty damn good totally ok it   really tasty mustard sauce came really enjoyed   Buffalo Wings http www yelp com biz_photos tap las vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#xhsxeyv7jom3w1qGmfRqfw  finger licking good!  actually choose 4 different sauces waiter recommended stick Buffalo glad did   could another basket wings!

Service great too! <EOR> Good food great beer TERRIBLE service  waited 20 min table water didn't even chance place drink food order until 30 mins receiving 1 glass water   Such disappointment  <EOR> Food good service prompt very friendly   Cho great very pleasant   Would recommend both other locals well tourists  <EOR> If you're guy business trip convention place you  love little high end rustic bar feel going on  They've televisions everywhere every sports channel could think just might spot watch game down few drinks boys  also looks good place take clients business meetings  casual but decent presentable helps give inviting vibe easily start conversation   They're offerings look good well  ordered chicken strips but even those impressed with  When comes chicken strips tenderness chicken breading tells all  breading different crunchy just you'd but texture flavor nothing typical  kind different taste it   maybe beer battered? But I'd recommend one   Other recommendations which hear popular *The reuben sandwich *Fish Chips *Fried mac cheese *Fried green beans *Loaded nachos  Definitely more tailored fellas probably best place take someone date unless she's into sports she's ok losing attention since you'll watching screens   lol <EOR> Tap amazing burgers awesome selection lagers don't scared menu prices food all amazing <EOR> I accidentally spilled first beer excessively ridiculed embarrassed disrespectful bartender Jennifer  She also charged full price spilled beer which probably costs bar pennies never seen before  Accidents happen  No damage done  professional  Never going back  <EOR> If option no stars would give no stars  first time around brought wrong order wait another 15 mins ask server refill drinks    I would recommend place would defiantly would come back <EOR> Great place! Food great value price  Ate Wednesday loved cheese curds tap chop salad! server knowledgeable! <EOR> The food really good but others mentioned service left lot desired  waitress more interested trying best friends table next rather waitress  If don't mind terrible service give TAP try! <EOR>
