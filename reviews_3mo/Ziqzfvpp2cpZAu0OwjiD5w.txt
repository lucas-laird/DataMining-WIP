Your average touristy teppanyaki joint some other Asian cuisines mixed in     Chowed on Gyoza $7 Pretty standard Chicken Teri $19 Generous juicy white meat pieces salad soup Seafood salad $16 Could better mixed greens instead iceberg bigger pieces seafood <EOR> I Vegas Bachelorette party group fifteen girls all mood meat decided teppan dinner hit Hamada's Asiana since already staying Rio  called reservations sit teppanyaki table replied back might hard accommodate such large group since reservation last minute place might busy   Once all dolled night way downstairs restaurant which appeared empty Saturday night and giving problems??? Host sat down gave menus end it  wait awhile until someone finally came asked if ordered yet  ordered drink two three four took even longer time chef come grill cart pretty close thirty minutes   Seriously! long does take round some beef chicken shrimp fifteen girls when restaurant empty?!  And considering Bachelorette Party imagine rowdy since close being drunk  chef other hand opposite  entertaining talkative pleasant all he pretty much just cooked food made into cute shapes teppanyaki table served left  Overall boring experience well least fun afterwards Chippendales  <EOR>
