good  Chada Street fantastic! big bold flavors Chada did disappoint  Moo Ma Now appetizer tender sliced pork perfectly balanced sauce lime juice fish sauce chili garlic  nothing bashful dish found myself using spoon every last drop sauce  then Sen Mee Kang Pou  spicy rich curry loaded real crabmeat thin rice noodles spun into little balls served side perfect dunking into amazing curry  told signature dishes  Finally Pad Kee Mao which constant order any Thai restaurant thus always standard comparison  always order extra hot am most cases underwhelmed results  loved this! noodles silky little sheets folded into hot spicy sauce pork chilies basil and no carrots nothing against carrots but hate when restaurants sneak them filler   found service great  waitress Preyadar unusually

aggressive menu items commonly consumed vendors Thailand's street markets results oftentimes resoundingly successful though service still long way go   Elegantly decorated stripmall Spring Mountain bustling plaza unfortunately falling short parking Saturday 7 30pm Chada Street occupies footprint nearly threefold size Bank's original restaurant well appointed bar beneath photographic mural stretching length dining room seating options offered multiple leather clad lounge front perfect relaxation while more proper meal offered amongst low lit tables private room extending back behind all glass wine storage   Prominently featuring Rieslings though certainly lacking well priced spirits sourced around globe menus presented beneath lightly playing tunes Chvrches party seven made selections total twelve plates complimented three more chef's discretion proving adequate amount food all persons present some actually leaving quite stuffed    Noting front waitresses undoubtedly speak better English Thai suffice say language barriers played big part service issues almost moment seats taken despite repeated requests items paced once but twice items returned kitchen drink refills clearly list priorities despite menu's bold spice profile while other oysters pandan custard forgotten until staff reminded   Speaking next quality kitchen should seem obvious such broad menu bound occasionally miss mark but setting aside pork belly surprisingly devoid flavor O Aew more snow cone shaved ice rest cuisine well crafted occasionally quite stunning without once drifting spicy appealing   Doing best experience wide swath Chada Street's cuisine perhaps good fortune opening plates showed most strongly blue tea turned purple addition citrus adequately refreshing palates between bites both housemade  pork sausage duo crabs each boldly flavored nicely presented requested side rice helping sop Sen Mee Kang Pou's sauce while skewers grilled pork would better ordered double allow more sharing   Already seeing 8 top's capacity likely challenged sizable service plates portions defying low costs mere moments round two more curries presented slightly overcooked pork shank also allowed delivered while four more plates refused then sent back once more reprepared just ten minutes later crispy skinned fowl pork pool spicy pineapple broth could properly savored   No doubt attuned recipes Atcharawan's spicier plates saved until later meal light tingle crab duck sill lingering lips oft raved larb presented 'hot' some even though requested medium both flavor texture indeed excellent catfish chili paste equally praiseworthy while crisp chicken wings little lost flavor presume numbing spice mixed tamarind    Passing durian based desserts modestly amused mix ins beneath aforementioned 'shaved ice ' perhaps 'lucky' double order warm bread beneath sweet custard reminiscing Ghostbusters brought forth singular since several group already topped off duo honey toasts forgivingly smaller those Hachi Izakaya undoubtedly benefited more honey creamier ice cream   ****Still finding its footing front house lagging behind skills those stoves Chada Street welcome addition genre seen great growth since Lotus Siam became destination  <EOR> Delicious great service great atmosphere   love small plates perfect place group together try bunch different tasty bites! <EOR> This place recommended sister  husband Thai Thailand few times hard find good thai restaurant close authentic one  If sweet blah  husband said top list concur  definitely recommend place can't wait return  <EOR> A week visit Chada Street still wavering between three four stars  Looking back all food group seven able try couple standouts but most part most dishes just incredibly solid    We started meal blue pea limenade which refreshing fun novelty color changing aspect drink  highly recommend starting if visit  favorite dishes meal crab fried rice northern style sausage crab curry larb  sausage exceptional incredibly spicy flavorful  crab curry excellent flavor although didn't come many noodles absorb all sauce I'd recommend ordering extra side rice assist  don't typically enjoy ground meat but since all heard great things Chada's larb admit did really enjoy flavors    We ordered number desserts well although serve two different versions favorite desserts favorite warm bread cubes pandan custard  all noted resemblance ectolasm but tasty unique    The rest dishes all good but didn't leave memorable impression me  Service friendly albeit little forgetful  pacing dishes little quicker would preferred actually ask server slow down dishes allow time eat first rounds before next arrived    The restaurant very nice interested trying more dishes future visit  <EOR> Came long work day tapas sized Thai dishes solo bar  selection good quartet dishes ordered all fairly solid but guess expected better  Service friendly attentive wide assortment wine beer available classy romantic atmosphere low lighting   SAI OUA House made Northern Thai sausage  more unique dishes menu served variety garnishes lettuce onion peanut ginger bring various herbal flavors within sausage itself  Lots heat watch out  MOO PING Garlic pork skewers simple but well executed  Five skewers $6 tender meat fragrant garlic  Enjoyable if safe dish  POR PIA YUAN Fresh spring roll vegetables pork meat loaf? seemed another simple straightforward dish but punch herbal flavor beats any other version town  paired odd dipping sauce similar hot and sour? combination didn't really work but enjoyed rolls themselves  HOR MOK PHUKET Curry fish cake wrapped banana leaf  Probably favorite dish ordered just right amount heat comforting combination curry fish formed into patty wrapped gift  especially liked fresh thai basil leaves also included packet    know menu intended skewed more toward street foods Thailand but seemed far many safe predictable dishes menu  Perhaps separate street menu would more helpful? find myself more likely return sister restaurant Chada Thai come back but want try crab fried rice crab larb dishes wine two  am heartbroken don't khao soi though  ultimate
