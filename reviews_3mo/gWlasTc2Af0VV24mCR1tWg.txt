To start think only fair say fresh mex fix tend prefer Zabas    Only if convenience plays role choice Chipotle   SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BUSINESSES PEOPLE!  With all being said Chipotle recently opened within walking distance work   Naturally offered pay co worker pick some because heaven forbid some exercise    happy see location offers online ordering didnt even use vocal chords order food mouth   2012!   ordered Burrito Bowl Barbacoa opted Brown Rice which dont believe available all chipotle locations bonus black beans both medium salsas guacamole   online system said it'd ready 30 minutes    40 minutes later presented food first bite noticed wasn't very hot guacamole lost some texture due being rest food seemed while     pet peeves online ordering THINK some use default timing system when food ready but employees might just start making immediately    if tell 30 minutes your food often sits getting cold 10 15    Temperature issues aside food tasted expect Chipotle   baracoa spiced nicely salsas rice tasted fresh   also ordered bottled water displeased see bottle Arrowhead when delivered   all probably know Arrowhead disgusting   Next time order Nantucket Nectar instead them just pour pinto bean juice jar that'd more refreshing Arrowhead   So visit nothing really set apart any other Chipotle experience ever sure going often if ever time crunch lunch   Now if only could Zabas near here    <EOR> I may found new favorite Chipotles! other two locations pain ass just door because many inclines being wheelchair hard enjoy nice burrito    Then place charleston saved life! No inclines very spacious interior made burrito munching pleasure!  When line order delicious burrito display low enough see ingredients  When asked if first time   said yes comped beverage!! nice! Very friendly staff !   I frequent customer location    Awesome! <EOR>
