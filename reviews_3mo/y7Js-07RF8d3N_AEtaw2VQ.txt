fries nothing special didn't compliment burger very well  But found fries most enjoyable part   And then burger       I single bypass half pound meat cheese grilled onions lettuce tomato decided opt 5 bacon slices    I don't know where start burger  Dry cracking bun tough burger meat soggy and kind gross onions cheese looked laid cooked it  Everything burger looked tasted wrong wrong calorie way but wrong  hamburger way   I think lower end places burger Whiskey Dicks Craig Rd near base today blown away much better burger was    My boss agreed Heart Attack Grill never going time money again   If you're over 350 pounds ahead free burger note fries drink included you but if your looking better burger Heart Attack Jack Box Carl's Jr  right down street  <EOR> This probably more 3 5 star review   keep going back forth whether give place 3 stars 4 Yelp rating   After drinking enough booze kill elephant Lee's event Hilton husband wanted run crazy around Fremont Street zipped cab last weekend   We really hungry saw place decided being drunk might only time would brave enough eat here   found surprisingly pretty decent best burger ever tasted title Annie's Island Fresh Burgers Big Island Hawaii http www yelp com biz annies island fresh burgers kealakekua  They use good quality meat  but char hell Medium Well done something wish would change better juicier burger   Don't anything more single unless want sick more enough food   under impression if gone earlier least Saturday night burgers would probably little better cooked   fries however very well cooked very flavorful   Some best town   I came knowing hospital gowns expecting them thought really cool   sure why people would gimmick restaurant then complain gimmick but c'est la vie   when vegetarian steakhouse complains no food them   If don't sort thing don't go   One big complaint loud restaurant even trouble placing order much less carrying any kind drunken conversation   band playing very good all wearing standard scrubs nurses outfits   funny   But while appreciate love live music very much having shout orders top lungs right into waitress's ear several times does kind leave bad first impression     Overall pretty decent place moment   few kinks need work noise ensuring cook burgers properly regardless time day   But tell owner location cares enough buy quality product because think place lot potential   am sure find ourselves back some day see if things improved  <EOR> Burgers done way way only  Extremely WELL done dry bone only way allowed serve them  NO lettuce  NO pickles  NO raw onions  American cheese only option  Your only allowed split basic 1 2 lb burger  Canned beer only your allowed glass cup  Only regular soda available  don't silverware either  No credit cards  Cash only  many rules place couldn't wait there  <EOR> I just Vegas past weekend friend checking some stuff north strip   lunch time hungry right near Freemont Street   saw signs Heart Attack Grille thought sounded fun place good burger   But first decided check Yelp just sure weren't making huge mistake  Just 2 stars        Let's try anyways looks cool  could pretty girls mini nurses uniforms tipped decision way but glad went   The burgers good great but good   single plently big enough 5 6 pieces Bacon   Good crispy bacon   Servers cute friendly polite   friend found hair burger took care immediately   chocolate shake super rich pad butter top   wasn't sure if should grossed find funny decided funny   This really probably more 3 star place but since many other negative reviews giving them 4th help them out   Don't if looking gourmet meal great service widely varied menu   many great restaurants Vegas kind stuff   if just looking fun place funny concept   Think Hooters but only really big burgers ton's bacon  <EOR> This place  always wanted finally chance when passing through town  previously Phoenix area surprised location closed down  found Vegas accident   Walked friend around 11 large crowed just left seemed pretty empty  greeted right away gowns put on  nice clean dont know why people complain them   The service slow infact no came table few minutes see complain lot  nurses but cleaning tables up  appears poor communication between hostess waitress  Even though all carry iPods touch take your order would think would problem   During visit Epic Meal Time filming episode table away received lot attention owner few nurses  lack service expected because this  Nothing terrible   I ordered Double Bypass extra bacon  burger nothing special  surprised its dullness  some great burgers other places restaurant going should really work improving burgers  lake flavor  fries soggy dont know if just poorly made when deep fry them lard   Otherwise place pretty good  nice challenge those late nights  really hope owner sees restaurants keep getting poor reviews something it  honestly think good idea just poorly implement   As far anyone else complaining stupid things no diet cola cash only cant split meal  Srsly? come place called Heart Attack Grill complain things? over it  <EOR> So kind novelty place   I didn't know when there   skanky nurses waitresses wear

Nope   But can't McDonald's Wendy's either   If looking fancy place isn't you   #3 Fries taste lard cooked fries  Have since kid tend little soft chewy opposed crisp very different flavor fries cooked vegetable oil   Again place is   If expecting McDonald's style super crispy fries you're luck but give try may find enjoy them  I miss unlimited fry bar   Phoenix opted bring Vegas #4 Milkshakes Don't think milkshakes   Think old school East Coast frozen custard   shakes VERY rich very creamy very thick just enough sweet them wonderful without being overpowering   IMHO best thing menu   prefer vanilla   chocolate ones use actual cocoa powder semi sweet dark chocolate kind taste which find bit bitter but wife loves   Just scoop little pat butter way the same way you'd remove umbrella your alcoholic beverage dig creamiest ice cream you've ever had   #5 Service can't speak problems others mentioned never problem here   visited Chandler location 3 times Vegas location 3 times   those 6 visits never wait table never less perfect service   If Dr  Jon he always comes welcomes twice sat talked length restaurant marketing business  much conversation described Steve F  above He's always very pleasant lot fun   #6 Theme Yes wear gowns   part fun   No don't serve diet   Diet soda misses WHOLE POINT place   order water but comes bottles    People   this place celebration excess fat tasty food obesity   flies face healthy says right front door food going kill you   Why would surprised food grease laden artery clogging fattening goodness?   Don't strip club complain nudity   Don't bar complain alcohol   Don't casino complain gambling God's sake if HEART ATTACK expect over top fatty food fun cheeky environment   and don't complain if  when there  <EOR> The atmosphere staff very plesant easy talk to    Ordered double more could handle    fries awesome   Made mistake ordering diet coke     don't sell anything  full calories   even put pat butter top milkshake     Wish place franchised could here  <EOR> I place!

Btw 5'8 140lbs all rabbit food veggie losers suck it  only take cash   the way should be! Fuck plastic! Plus ATM only $ 75 whatever wack ass fees your bank charges  stop whining complaining feed your face  <EOR> This place didn't very many redeeming qualities   love gimmick weighing yourself first then eat    daughter loved Dr   all people very friendly   but food awful    made all sick including daughter  happy food  Service great but tl again food awful  <EOR> We really excited try Heart Attack Grill ever since seeing featured some Travel Channel show 2010 some time  when learned Heart Attack Grill opening Vegas Fremont street ON!  Flash forward past weekend  stayed Las Vegas decided trip Heart Attack Grill Christmas Eve dinner  your typical dining choice most special nights year then again Vegas isn't exactly first destination folks think holiday either  So    par course!  Our journey down Fremont Street excitement anticipation  finally way bad food ground zero! When arrived took pictures front restaurant including he parked ambulance front funny stuff far    Inside greeted nurse didn't even bother standing seat behind counter until made clear wanted eat  Weird    The restaurant very empty  few families but felt very cold odd  give them benefit doubt Christmas Eve  However design execution place just isn't welcoming even amusing  bad  empty bar walls filled huge monitors dim they'd looked better turned off  '80s music played along music videos wall  guess means '80s flashpoint shitty greasy food  not  knows? cares    Our waitress nice gal thanked working Christmas Eve  However nice server doesn't crap restaurant much better is    Food ordered included Single Bypass lard fried fries bottle Coke  Bottle Coke = no refills Heart Attack Grill does serve water unless want BUY bottle    The fries envisioned golden crispy McDonald's back day  Heaven right? Wrong  limp soggy fried skins on  tasty texture just nasty    The burgers OKAY  Nothing great  hard decent hamburger  cheese slices sandwich slices crease individual plastic wrapper impression could still seen  Classy    Finally dessert choice butter fat milkshake vanilla entire bar butter blended into good measure  shared ate spoons because consistency more ice cream shake  so    half way decided taste butter really overpowered vanilla  wasn't good thing  When finally put finger said tastes EXACTLY Buttered Popcorn Jelly  Belly signaled end  Because taste like  Gross  even sweet  Just gross    The bill came $30 two us  Heart Attack Grill doesn't take cards only cash  thought cheap ass Asian places Alhambra only ones pulled crap days  But anyway   We paid walked feeling we'd had  waitress fine friendly but others including guy dressed doctor walked around place interacting guests making jokes being lively  just walked back forth zombies perfect environment wild rude crude  But no total ambience fail    I honestly don't think Heart Attack Grill survive very long Vegas  many dining choices  Especially when NO feeling experience even humor when eat Grill  Just zombies taking your order iPhones hurrying back doing nothing or case hostess sitting ass     What SHOULD hilarious yummy Christmas Eve dinner remember biggest fail entire trip us  say let down understatement  I'd never recommend place anyone  Heart Attack Grill downtown Vegas absolutely flat lined excuse restaurant  <EOR> All bad reviews confuse me   expected ridiculously cheesy over top fat laden meal   got! Yup its' gimmicky yup high calories but feel all should come no surprise!   I think theme if entertaining fun  Wearing hospital gown pretty funny you keep if let nurses spank you! watching nurses dole spankings pretty hilarious loved bill medical procedures rendered printed it    Our service great  Friendly nurse  Food came relatively quickly  No complaints!  We started meal chocolate butter cream shake added shot whipped cream vodka  turns shot actually 3 5 shots thus earning drink title strongest frozen drink Fremont   don't know if really strongest drink Fremont but know TASTIEST frozen drink Fremont  If childish enough enjoy whipped cream vodka I am! then definitely appreciate delicious combination! no pat butter shake which fine     We split single bypass 1 2 pound order fries  LOVE cook fries lard as all fries should cooked! damn delicious  Perfectly crisp  burger very good well  Definitely best burger Vegas material but great burger    Overall please don't come if don't sense humor don't enjoy high fat food  food tastes much better if drunk fact eating burger wearing hospital gown should probably only done while intoxicated  <EOR> I understand gimmick restaurant also know factor into thinking experience food going had  waitnurses I'd coin term very friendly save accidentally caught scratching middle pocket apron around area near some would call wonderland  Oh course she happened serve us    My brother love draped clean bib acting robes  passed wheelchair obese person wondered myself if anybody actually sat chair before fit chair  expecting fun evening especially brother just turned 21 town New Year's weekend    Previously stopped once before chocolate shake  hostess ordered curiosity best ask many calories chocolate shake was  thinking maybe 1000 would little bit close expectation unhealthy but double amount! 2000 whopping calories Ryan H  described East Coast frozen custard took shared love together both able half it  couldn't rest  advertise pure creme  don't mind killing myself good food but would say tad bit better mediocre    To dinner    the  Triple Bypass waitnurse the scratched area wouldn't let split first told already eaten just passing wanted try them she allowed split ourselves  Grilled onions must sideline grill while because sure practice didn't part  lukewarm no flavor even anything savory  bacon somewhat tried attack but needed more defense because again benching players  Bacon strips also lukewarm  meat seasoned player didn't know attack sliced tomatoes signed season no go either  only thing attacked horribly calories  Quadruple Bypass 8000 calories according waitnurse Triple minus maybe 1500 calories brings 6500 calories split between three us  Well didn't bread little more guys    We also ordered 3 Cokes the  Vanilla Shake yummier chocolate shake but definitely did taste butter but butter popcorn jelly belly someone else mentioned review  would add amount calories should taste great but wasn't really par its 2000 average daily value calories  brother really enjoyed shake  enjoyed also but perhaps because burger disappointing  Le sigh     As waiting fries saw doctor costumed bartender dancing waitnurse kind DJing counting minutes New Year's  having fun dancing yes dim TVs if sitting right next them but if far enough away able see music videos 80's paired next videos doctor using stethoscope pat burger meat down onto grill    Lard fried Fries total three fries basket fries  No obsessively counting calories point wouldn't even matter  However very disappointed texture fries weren't identifiable  could say wasn't  wasn't crispy  wasn't freshly soggy N' Out  wasn't delicious certain taste it  most apathetic basket fries ever met  Hello Fries  Okay  see  Goodbye  don't care? Okay  waitnurse brought bill  Throughout entire dinner figured where she hand plates bill weren't nervous being waitress all  I'd add benefit doubt all waitnurses made wear red bras undershorts possibly uncomfortable    I asked brother if he fun  He enjoyed experience but he didn't food  am good food hunter  feel disappointed brother should listened few wise Yelp but wanted try myself hoping regain few stars hope new grotesquely interesting place  Hope? Nope  wish Denny's opened instead  Sorry Dr  Jon  Nutritionist gone wild? Well ¡¡¡¡Mad Food Yelper gone fariggin' LOCA!!!! Okay  Time death   2 41am <EOR>
