Also ordered Lobster Mac n cheese  Its perfect size portion so eat all guilt free   just happen mac n cheese connoisseur share cheesy noodles  really good lobster truffle cream but favorite  However dish comes mini lobster BLT good would definitely order again  You only little mini blt mac menu item its own     Holsteins cool hang out spot   just ordinary burger joint really creative things menu wouldn't expect  definitely come back still many things want try! <EOR> The burgers ok great   The SERVICE horrible!!!! far worst service ever experienced! First ask twice water   ok no biggy but worsssst when burger kindly asked waiter extra side pickles BIG MISTAKE he rolled eyes me!!!   Needless say love cosmopolitan but returning Holsteins again  <EOR> I actually enjoyed meal Holsteins   They some pretty unique burgers burger nori crispy yam avocado tempura enjoyed it! also some kind bulgogi quesadilla which interesting pass    other burgers table ordered good too  Perfectly cooked great buns everyone left very full   The french fries sweet potato fries shoestring yum   yummy sounding spiked milkshakes but didn't stomach try it  full bar which I'd imagine would great hang at    Prices reasonable  Service fine  <EOR> Pretty cool restaurant serves burgers alcoholic milkshakes! service eh    music played hiphop clubbing type music   I salmon burger which pretty good  slice lox top cooked salmon patty which made burger! upgraded duck fat fries which BIG mistake  duck fat fries pretty much taste regular fries  think would've better off saving $2 eating regular fries made normal oil  <EOR> i decided eat fam because i'd read some reviews greatness holsteins  burgers alcoholic shakes ew! fries    sounded perfect since didn't lot time sorta fast food   the place itself alright  its new new hotel    but loaded noisy families tons kids bad acoustics  could even hear mom talking she RIGHT next me   like said didn't lot time    40 minutes  told waitress ahead time she very accommodating made sure food quick  all quick bites     ordered street tacos duck foie gras side cranberry garnish salsa? sure   pretty good hit spot  however    mom beef sliders boy did look dry icky  she said dry icky  she didn't even eat it      ended giving tacos    we duck fat fries well which good thought  ketchup actually mixed relish something tasted ok but something aioli would better  also split regular strawberry milkshake no alcohol  good but yea     anyway just unimpressed kinda mad place  dare serve such gross sliders! yes don't eat beef didn't try em but looked bad mom confirmed were  anyway maybe come back someday give full menu shot  but likely anytime soon  <EOR> The burgers good but crazy over priced  Your talking around $15 just your burger  Want cheese?  extra  Fries? Those extra too  Also $8 milkshakes? Seriously? worth considering mosey down buffet all eat shrimp braised short ribs  Plus place trying way hard hip  <EOR> If find yourself wandering 3rd floor trying determine if dressed appropriately swing back down joint  price decent food surprise hopefully better   brisket burger while visiting Vegas made forget least few hours  Honestly place gets pretty creative burgers which commend them fries awesome  didn't shake because beer selection good  did pretty decent grumbly stomach eating but all fairness eating all sorts junk including fried pickles Swedish fish candy NY NY hotel  would visit again next time Vegas  <EOR> Holsteins started off pretty cool but quickly down hill once cranked music  Seriously Valentines Day music loud couldn't even talk your special date    The menu ambitious unfortunately most items kettle chips onion rings french fries tried salty  Burgers alright though Hen House did come fried over easy egg cooked through  When told food runner he argued told its supposed runny Uh yeah  He finally said  its supposed walked off begged differ  glance waiter said wrong fixed very cool! Burger pretty dang good loads gooey yolk running down fingers  made punky food runner overly salty sides apps    $1 beers shots Monday their choice    Word advice Holsteins customer should always right  <EOR> 02 16 11 DINNER Without planning advance ended here  Didn't burger! Instead drinks appetizers turned plates bigger appetizers desserts  classic martini terrific GIN variety does no drink gin town? containing gin which never heard Nolet Silver ? which floral smooth garnished pickled shallot  Expecting shallot bulbs stick instead shaved bottom glass! Another a bloody mary which came containing pepper cilantro infused vodka which greatly liked especially gigantic shrimp came it! Food fried pickles fried dill spears fried olives caper berries prosciutto salami w herb caper mayo street tacos crispy shells filled w shreds duck confit foie gras trufle crema cranberry relish truffle lobster mac n cheese maine lobster black truffle mac tallegio marscapone sauce Bull's Balls 2 risotto rice balls stuffed veal topped tomato fondue slice lardo   very rich decadent collection dishes thought all very well done especially mac WOW!   Bulls' Balls weren't good hoped mostly rice very little filling lardo kinda lost amongst strength tomato foudue which genius  An angel hair pasta fondue would crazy good  street tacos really good but really rich  fave thing fried pickles fried olives only 2 fight over those!   Ended stout float Guinness ice cream oatmeal crumble very good  food really wacky concoction Johnny Apple Seed consisting Knob Creek honey apple cider  First all very nice server said first time ordered since added menu ! second no idea hard cider was! explain alcoholic apple ciders those? but answer never came  No matter nose throat clearer! AHEM! But great idea IMHO  Sipping took 15 minutes well worth it! overall I'd say GO  Now need back burger perhaps duck duck goose stuffed duck confit duck cracklings foie gras! YIKES! <EOR> Great place  burgers shakes  Needed place dine while Cosmo  All other places didnt open till 4pm  great fix  Cant wait back  Many more shakes burgers try   service great  <EOR> I high hopes Holsteins  love good burger shakes booze   yes please!!

Lobster mac n cheese only small bite but could easily eaten whole plateful!  Philly steak egg rolls I think ehhh   So far good   I pleased appetizers ready burger! kept simple ordered classic cheeseburger great  can't complain  steak fries which also good  overall consensus group food good    So why 2 stars?
