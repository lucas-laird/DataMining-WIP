I've never lived Chicago but sometimes sure miss Chicago Dogs  though some places reasonable interpretation Chicago Dog none them really hit right every single way   until now!  Uncle Al's uses very own dogs  part place special  dogs snap when bite just good Chicago dog should  They skinless wusses don't understand true nature good dog  Aside Chicago another dozen styles hot dogs  all them wrong except Chicago  Ketchup?? hot dog? Ew! also variety other sandwiches burgers but if any sense your head come dogs   Aside dogs real french fries  They're kind limp but some reason still really them  tried coleslaw twice regretted twice  Stick dogs   and limp fries  <EOR> Their dogs snap when bite into them nice spice it    Try coleslaw dog spiciness dog + cooling taste slaw + 100+ degree Vegas dry heat = nirvana  I'm craving Chicago dog right now  <EOR>
