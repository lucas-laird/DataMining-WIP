My husband hounding nonstop since Brazilian restaurant closed down sign place came up  didn't really want mainly because smoking anything doesn't appeal me   Finally week couldn't put off anymore because we're moving few weeks SW side town   We decided actually eat meal hookah thing   beef shawarma wrap   came some nice garlic paste which since ate years ago Zankou Chicken Los Angeles   sandwich pretty yummy but sadly didn't compare Zankou   If just crave pita would most likely Crazy Pita here   pita griddled little wrap form slightly hard shell around filling which kind cool   salad came fresh light but little heavy red onion   also fries if salad isn't your bag   husband shawarma plate which same thing dish but decomposed plus comes nice plate rice   sure flavors rice but pretty good   highlight meal side hummus taste   full garlic very vinegary hummus hating husband actually really liked it     As hookah stuff itself never done before can't compare other similar places   wouldn't say hated but didn't love either   mixed fruit flavor which tasty very relaxing   happy hour really cheap worth overall   The service good lounge area where everyone smokes hookah warm nice   If staying neighborhood would again   Monday Night Football flat screens good place watch game relax   m sure however if worth driving way for  <EOR> Laziza place be! Great food kabobs hummus amazing all very well priced  atmosphere very relaxing nice way unwind long day  pretty large restaurant lounge there's lot seating plenty room  times gone participated awesome Lebanese dance there's always good times had! live all way summerlin but still drive eastern 215 definitely worth drive!  laziza won't disappointed! <EOR> Five stars hard come but thought it    thought think Laziza truly does deserve five star    I don't smoke hookah but couple times hang friends  good location since only live couple miles away  ambiance Laziza really cultural very nice place hang friends    As other reviews said live DJ  also dancing area but crowded packed club would plus me  For those shy dancing being seen then might something you  DJ plays mix Arabic Persian American hip hop R B music  personally think nice mix    I also tried filet mignon kabob delicious! kabob also came house salad soup day  tried lentil soup also surprisingly good  menu extensive sense Mediterranean wise but extensive enough those just want burger fries shrimp scampi    Most importantly service great! all times staff always seems eager help sure okay    I definitely recommend next hang friends held here  If area definitely stop give try! You'll surprise! <EOR> Music great!!
