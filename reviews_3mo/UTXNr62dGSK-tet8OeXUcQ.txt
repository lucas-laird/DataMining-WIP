<EOR> This place awesome   The food portions great staff extremely helpful prices reasonable     There lot space inside outside seating   No cons all   Just great food great service  <EOR> As inconsistent gets  First visit above average burger reasonable service  Second visit 1 day later miserable dry burger half overcooked dry half undercooked yet still dry ordered  Waiter decided rather fixing just hand rest order let try sort out   Won't bother back no guarantee it'll right  <EOR> Descriptive phrase hip cool sports pub poor service   Yard House chain Linq just cool clean any other  When big group came watch Final Four basketball games obvious gonna while drop chunk change  did considering each half yard beer least $14 own Chicken Nachos $11 45 good way    But overwhelming impression left horrendous service was  wasn't even busy first took 20 minutes between visits server  each time she came she'd only take 1 2 people's orders of 10ish us then leave again    The place many TVs games yet refuse turn game sounds even though night especially most patrons watch Final Four  Annoying   When bill finally came would split it  understand some places refuse which think stupid but whatever  However when through bill ton things didn't order  brought attention changed it   to more wrong things  took legitimately 30 minutes figure did wrong explain them before could change correctly  said they'd comp beer trouble but those never came    The only reason isn't 1 star because food beer atmosphere still good  crowd even opposing fans all friendly jovial  But wouldn't come back solely because service  <EOR> I am huge yard house fan   I worried new location Linq would jack prices up   but nope   second floor patio great hangout summer   Server Brandon fantastic NEVEr felt neglected even thought busy back!!! <EOR> Our experience may affected fact final day trip exhausted but Yard House didn't inspire us  There's incredibly large selection draft beers which takes center stage restaurant comfortable booth seating circling around exterior  While copious number tap handles impressive food wasn't anything special    We ordered few dishes House Favorites section menu including penne chicken orange peel chicken  pasta smothered lukewarm mushroom cream sauce lacking flavor interest  orange peel chicken better choice  server friendly but took forever food later check  restaurant wasn't packed surprised took long   If you're beer enthusiast sure you'd enjoy but wouldn't again just food  <EOR> when heard friend wanted spend birthday dinner Yard House less enthused only because Hallendale such disappointment when came food  But Vegas location such treat! restaurant casual attire but sophisticated classy feel  took elevator top floor passed outdoor patio peep through kitchen   server Ron sweet attentive   food calamari clam chowder cesar salad   all very good made initial thoughts Yard House having bad food away  But no matter location Yard House great drinks addition extensive beer menu   favorites moscow mule sparkling raspberry cocktail made favorite beer framboise   We enjoyed much only did eat second time trip decided tradition all Vegas trips then on  only complaint no restrooms all upstairs  <EOR> Although your standard yard house prices definitely plus Vegas  come legit late night food decent priced drinks     Even if don't happy hour menu other restaurants Black Truffle Cheeseburger amazing when paired truffle friends all $10  Also having pay $7 shot Hennessy diamond rough compared other clubs bars charge anywhere between $10 $17 shot    If you're mood some normalcy Vegas decent price yard house hit spot  Also Linq alley very nice place just stroll shop eat drink  Highly recommend coming see glamorous Ferris wheel here!! <EOR> I'm big yard house fan whenever family friends come into town where take them   Lots mean lots different beer selections top cocktails wine sake!!! food awesome well  Ahi crunchy salad faves well southern fried chicken  But location best only because two stories sit outside patio enjoy high roller  Especially night when all lit up  Service exceptional everyone helping each other super friendly  <EOR> If beer your place  160 beers tap but  only reason go  deck second floor great way check what's LINQ    I turkey club  pretty average far club sandwiches but very tasty  portion more enough hungry man  comes fries but upgraded sweet potato fries  also truffle fries  Yumm!   The service excellent  waitress Lisa personable attentive  manager came check meal   wait drinks food reasonable   nothing wonder what's taking long? The prices typical Vegas  no surprises there  would recommend place again    If weren't many other places want try! <EOR> Walked felt welcomed best restaurants best greetings ever ! sat really quick server JESSICA awesome believe she deserves raise position ! Awesome awesome awesome ! <EOR> Whilst Vegas recently overheard conversation regarding where could craft beer strip  recommendation try Yardhouse recently opened but great selection   We certainly weren't disappointed when seated bar able observe many many draught taps presented fat menu containing details vast selection   We started selecting something hadn't tried before applied selection criteria few more times  staff member attended knowledgable let try samples before committing decision would next glass  We only some basic chips but food being brought other patrons around looked good   Would definitely recommend check place if craft beer! <EOR> Every time eat Yard House food just A OK  Nothing rave but nothing really complain either  huge selection drinks food  menu large diverse  Service consistently A OK well  <EOR> Sorry place sucked  crowded service absolutely awful food mediocre  literally asked I'D 3 separate times I'm 45 way you're only allowed 1 drink bar per ID     even though waitress table took least 45 minutes between rounds      yeah NEVER going back establishment  <EOR> This particular Yard House just good any other Yard House would find line chains typical good food service drinks added bonus    location location location    Located Linq area great view High Roller beautiful double decker outdoor patio area must happy hour once include happy hour meal spot while you're area  <EOR> I birthday boyfriend sad say weren't all impressed service  food great don't wrong! But service terrible  came Friday little before noon seated immediately  waitress Emmie came greet seated took drink orders  However took 10 minutes before drinks came us  10 minutes drinks! ridiculous that? eventually orders placed which Lobster Crab Artichoke dip appetizer share Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos Asada Street Tacos boyfriend    It took good 30 45 minutes before food came time drink running low  placed empty glass end table hopes somebody would come offer give refill but didn't happen  seated booth close kitchen numerous employees passed table hidden  But just passed table overlooking empty glass  Emmie finally took notice she seemed very oblivious good work ethic! gave refill apologizing computers down food orders backed up  could understand food might take while but getting drink refilled? Again absolutely ridiculous  Eventually all food came out   including appetizer specifically asked brought first before main dishes  Thankfully food looked delicious slightly this   The Lobster Crab Artichoke dip DELICIOUS  came pieces pita bread chips really liked pita bread  both really enjoyed dip just wished came before main dishes did  tacos phenomenal  boyfriend enjoyed Asada tacos I bite quite tasty! Grilled Korean Pork Belly tacos nothing short awesome  Each taco dish came 2 tacos scoop spicy rice small bowl beans  meat both tacos cooked perfection much charred taste  rice alright beans could better    By end meal both empty glasses received no offer refills place getting drinks?? waited 10 minutes check  Overall I'd say food rocked more service did!! <EOR> Liked place ALOT  Food excellent mix old new  late night monte cristo pops which neat good appetizer  Others onion ring tower sweet potato fries all good   For dinner wide selection dishes all came back positive reviews  grilled pastrami sandwich fries which good but could used mustard bit dry lacked kick  Wife coconut shrimp which she enjoyed  Others BBQ chicken pizza fish chips blu cheese burger pastrami hot dog   The real draw place beer selection unbelievable  Ever selection beer except favorite sours well represented    Overall food really good location awesome patio great even chilly windy night  food really good price  <EOR> My friends raved place    saying great food beer super fast service  hubby chicken avocado sandwich fries shrimp caesar salad  sandwich good fries fun because they're tiny  salad drenched dressing that tasted mustard Caesar despite asking them light dressing $16 only 4 shrimp   one which cooked through  beer came table time hubby finished sandwich  just wasn't impressed wouldn't recommend  <EOR> Smaller portion town square  More rooming but long wait food <EOR> This fruit hadn't ripened yet  Unfriendly unknowledgeable bartenders  yard house feel present here  limited drafts specials available  bartenders seemed bothered serve us  would pass place till act together  <EOR> Lots beers tap! Service food good prices average  place right Strip drop few before heading next place! <EOR> Loved place  chose dinner mainly bc gardein menu options  vegan friends lots options food  Food came hot well presented food delicious  loved huge beer selection well  <EOR> Stumbled upon gem when looking something eat did consist buffet casino restaurant  Being Cincinnati only drank beer here  time dinner fab!  burgers amazing  steak sandwich she burger  much better but still both very good!
