ALOHA!!! <EOR> I havent four other locations but excited new food option hood  exactly expected healthy cafe fare  Meh some positive me  Nice option somewhere eat clean if want to    or some fries it    The BF decided share Curried chicken salad sandwich nice flavor enjoyed pear ? green apple raisins mix  chose French bread but came ciabatta shape instead  OK though  picked sweet potato fries side standard but solid fare    Angel Hair Bolognese anytime see bolognese want try it  more meat sauce catagory bolognese carrots celery peas etc  other spots do  rather large bowl came piping hot! Decent homestyle sauce though    It's counter order number DIY drinks isn't service rate but we're friendly counter  seen other locations reviews pricey actually surprised prices fine with  $9 95 sandwich side didn't seem outrageous when shitty chain diner Denny's charging that    I'm sure back  hear much juice smoothies definitely pop soon well more menu  Good addition area don't really little cafe here  <EOR> Yay!  place awesome! We'd Summerlin location two years ago just ordered smoothies  good but place small crowded just never made down way again Now Rachel place Centennial  few times LOVE it  many options those gluten free  D  Sandwiches even pasta ordered gluten free  Sadly wraps burgers pancakes don't option  But complaining  cool somewhere actually order sandwich!   Their 440 sandwich flippin good  also tried smoked turkey avocado  good but 440 just entirely different level  protein lovers scramble pretty awesome too  Very cheesy if husband cheese just LOT cheese might want ask them easy   Service friendly prices reasonable  really much more you'd pay anywhere else  restaurant roomy bright cheery  We'll going back lot  goal try all sandwiches but difficult order 440 again right away  <EOR> Met four other friends check new place breakfast  Though arrived 8 30 a m  able order anything off menu all day long nice perk  met smiles welcomes courteous staff  breakfast choices plentiful very tasty  food delivered table very timely manner   Prices seemed quite reasonable  big iced tea fan green tea tropical passion iced tea chose from  decor comfortable refreshing inviting  personally LOVED background music playing reminded younger years!

The items tried far 440 Sandwich $10 50 Grilled Chicken Breast Goat Cheese Avocado Roasted Red Peppers Tomatoes Romaine Lettuce  Good healthy sandwich lol  felt little spendy but paying fresh ingredients health conscious restaurant   so kind comes territory    Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie Pineapples Banana Coconut Pineapple Juice Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt  probably favorite shake 3 tried far!  Sunrise Smoothie Strawberries Bananas Fresh Squeezed OJ Apple Juice Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt  2nd favorite   yum P  Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie Bananas Peanut Butter Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups Chocolate Milk Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt   think compensate peanut butter since shake little more runny vs others   Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Chocolate Chip Cookie $1 50ea   Good cookies   they probably light butter sugar here  Juuust sweet enough but definitely healthy cookie   Overall pretty good deli style setup quick eats won't feel guilty eating afterwards Check pics <EOR> Just OK but overpriced   protein scramble which yummy but potatoes toast special compared other local breakfast chains town   Sweet greens juice good but small juice 16 oz 8 oz sufficient would help cut down price   Another disturbing thing although touts itself health conscious restaurant only 15 items menu nutrition information   wonder other food items healthy may may be  <EOR> Been Rachel's Kitchen twice unfortunately impressed food sandwiches    curry chicken salad husband ultimate grilled cheese both average   griped little price because two drinks total over $30  bit much sandwiches portion taste  <EOR>
