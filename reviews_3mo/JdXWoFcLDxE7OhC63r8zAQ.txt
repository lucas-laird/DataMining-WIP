It's quick meal lunch but fairly unappetizing  am quite unsure why such long line leading entrance  place am definitely look forward visiting again  <EOR> Why people think just teriyaki? Samarai Sam's definitely great white hope asian goodness  Ok here's teriyaki lesson Japanese teriyaki usually shaved beef chicken pieces  light sauce  Usually soy sauce sugar sake   usually thin sauce Hawaiians grill meat charring add sweet sauce base shoyu brown sugar pineapple juice honey sweeter  Samarai Sam's hell teriyaki wrap rice? Doesn't defeat purpose Atkins? fusion? basically cheap fast faux teriyaki bowls  is    it's McDonald's Teriyaki  good? Eh boring     <EOR>
