This mom call budget buffet   Cheap chow   and food relatively tasty     The food isn't same quality let's say buffet MGM but price half   food isn't bland tasteless many other buffets either   would eat before eating RIO again!  I am giving 3 stars food selection plus bonus star price  <EOR> First let say eat buffet sorely because lose appetite when see piles foods trays lined end wall another   I forced yes forced! family party 8 two toddlers  Usually big parties wiith messy toddlers host would normally sit corner away other gobbling patrons but case  just few feet away food yet close foot traffic  that's 1 star The buffet being Orleans casino serves southren food among other international theme crawfish hush puppies  also cooked raw oysters  bad $20  only drawback desert section dont much offer tehre  But then again stuffed easily usually dont much room sweet shutffs  that's 2 stars no Rio buffet there's really much waiting  However being graduation week lot locals graduating kids still cap n gown   Stilll only waited 8 minutes  that's 1 star I bad impression server first because instead neatly placing silverwares table she would just toss other end table catch fork bouncess across table  that's 1 star <EOR>
