I asking locals best local steakhouse told SC Prime Suncoast Casino   happened across street playing Badlands Golf Course headed over try it    We Wednesday night without reservations wait 20 minutes   Then group treated some great appetizers salads steaks prime rib stuffed chicken breast     The cost considerably less places would find strip every bit good  <EOR> A poker buddy mine invited try place since he comp could use hey am turn down delicious comped meal?!  We took elevator level SC Prime   decor ok pretty old school but beautiful view!  Wednesday night place wasn't really packed though youngest people there   reservation 8 15 seated right away   We started night shrimp cocktail oysters   shrimp jumbo good but am definitely HUGE fan fresh oysters    DELICIOUS awesome way start meal!  Next ordered caprese salad lobster bisque   didn't try lobster bisque but presentation nice    big fan caprese salad buffalo mozzarella really yummy!  Thumbs that!  As far entrees ordered rack lamb short rib   crust lamb bit salty taste friend ended scraping most off but otherwise cooked perfectly mint jelly great compliment dish!   The short rib came rice  Nicely cooked but salty   rice little dry but hey Asian rice bit stickier softer lol    only negative take away half star both meals being slightly salty side     We also sampled some cocktails   tried Blackberry Mojito  also tried White Chocolate Martini   Both VERY good if come back I'd try some other cocktails!  We finished night off Chocolate Overload cake   Very rich decadent great those sweet tooth!  As far service pretty good though times would ask something would forget we'd ask again  server came couple times but found hard flag down when needed something but overall she pleasant   Our meal came $150 two us   prices pretty average would expect pay steakhouse     Obviously ordered WAY much food but did take home leftovers   left full pretty satisfied meal   I'd come back again sometime try steaks but now 4 stars  = <EOR>
