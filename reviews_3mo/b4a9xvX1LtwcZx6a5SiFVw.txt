I love italian subs!  fruit punch! <EOR> Lunch time bit crowded times  night place ghost town  food pretty much standard nothing really stands out  Im partial turkey provolone everything  employees always friendly quick  plus  catered before family events together's  trays reasonably priced mix match sandwiches  located near all types shopping stores  if some errands run want quick bite would give them shot    They carry those supersized cookies brownies which problematic   but everyone needs treat every now again  <EOR>
