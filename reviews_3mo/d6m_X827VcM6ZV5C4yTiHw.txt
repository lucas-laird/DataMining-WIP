This such fun experience old new bingoers! easy play electronic equipment won't miss number! Basically electronic a black box against wall stationary a monitor then paper bingo  think cheapest u electronic $15 but worth it  drinks complimentary if lady luck your side then could easy $50 $500! Some people even won $10 000! Plus you'll know if you've won because your machine tells when you're number away sings if bingo! took off star bc pretty addictive didn't win squat! staff very helpful especially noobs cocktail servers very nice! Oh and    bingo happens odd hours! <EOR>
