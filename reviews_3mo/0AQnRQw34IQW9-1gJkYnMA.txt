This far favourite restaurant bar Strip   very rock n roll feel it   actually much bigger thought too   two floors if  can't seat first floor chances you'll find top   server totally ball too   Very sweet friendly helpful   Great service adorable staff good drinks   ordered taco salad which super tasty   enjoyed much actually took time eat despite fact starving   friend's tacos also very good well drink   Yummy   lighting set dim red   pretty sure just opened because could barely find any info even website   Worth checking out   definitely going back again!

Although $8 you'd expect more couple spoonfuls it!  food decent bar ambiance fun   definitely still room improvement but I'd return here  <EOR> The restaurant only couple months old but seems draw huge crowds outside back end Monte Carlo which place itself front side  theme staffing atmosphere cool little edge but different others Strip   harder rate service when you're seated bar rather usual table dining   bartender excellent very nice approachable even kept credit card when retrieve forgetting 4hrs prior!  The cocktails bit far fetched somewhat pricey don't even serve pitchers    kinda bar does that?  Still pretty decent imports tap which nice because pint still relatively cheap area 6 50 anyone? food outstanding least ordered carnitas burrito carnitas tacos[3] came hot fresh   other reviews charged chips salsa but ours free    sure if  table vs  bar thing what   didn't know upstairs until when became much later night saw girls silhouette dancing around top left corner 2nd floor   almost back haha  Overall I'd say good experience   sure could improve bar selection little bit but I'd definately back again  <EOR> New joint Strip  Definitely gets brownie points lots TV's great bar area lots Tequila choices plenty chips salsa some pretty tasty food  Minus points very slow service not servers fault but kitchen slow sunday night weak pricy drinks  But overall place  Very big multi level plenty sitting standing area  food really tasty again   i carnitas burrito damn good  definitely back again more  <EOR> Cantina Restaurant 3 Stars    Amber    Amber    5 Stars   !     the smokin hot gorgeous bartender body goddess face angel eyes cat fiery tongued winked flirtatiously smiled sweetly sexy knew it but didn't overdo it fired back liners much attitude playfulness she hooked every man sucka place?    name Amber   Her name Amber      full review coming soon    <EOR> Diablo's open couple month's now but November 18 first time visiting cantina  My first impression motif does Monte Carlo Hotel Casino all  understand Vegas pendulum swinging over toward sin city mode but Red Devil Beauty above cantina just does fit Monte Carlo but then Dick's Last Resort Excalibur does fit hotel oh well      Secondly impressive array Tequila your enjoyment   friendly atmosphere bar dining area  ate drank bar upper level think area pick party atmosphere when weather    begins warm up   I ate taco salad very unique presentation supurb  Others 4 cheese nachos would say tended fine edges but soggy mess remained  center pile  4 cheese selection could improved  Calamari appetizer  tortilla bowl very nice coming assortment  salsa tomatillo  Tecate Dos Equis draft bar   some unusual quite average coctails menu but all all think enjoyable place spend time while end Vegas Strip  <EOR>
