Recently opened everything nice new  menu pretty extensive but most part your typical bar food  Maybe little better  Try Flamin' Hot Cheetos onion rings   Yes read right   Tasty   Pretty much your standard PT's crowd few strange ones   I think must tailgate party going parking lot because people kept coming red plastic cups   Could'nt figure out  back sure but because its close house  Wait staff very friendly bartenders top things  <EOR>
