Conveniently located door down taco place Mexican dessert store all variety Mexican sweets candies paletas well Blue Bell ice cream hand scooped your pleasure  Decent selection flavors  Smiling employees   The store itself mostly empty room lined freezers convenience store left hand side fruit paletas then Blue Bell counter traditional dulces straight ahead freezer right ice cream man style frozen treats oddball paleta flavors  No seating available   Came seeking something unique  Found oddball paletas section tamarind! Sweet but cloying 80 calories entire thing frozen rock hard pretty sure freezers set way low temperature because nearly chipped tooth treat set counter 10 minutes before could gnaw off shard try   For cash only business should probably quarters  $1 75 total pained stare when paid two dollar bills change consisted fifty cent piece some nickels  Seriously?     Side note also watch guy parking lot bottle Windex  He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside unprompted then expect payment afterward  <EOR>
