Zabas fast food joint leaning towards more American Mexican food  am never disappointed when because quick making your food more variety choose from  instance tacos just chicken steak but shrimp fish  only but into Zaba bowl  Zaba bowl your choice meat white brown rice beans pinto black salsa mild medium hot sour cream cheese lettuce  Sounds lot bowl Chipotle which yes very similar but Zaba's more choose which plus   The prices cheap ranging $1 something $7 something   I highly recommend bowls fish tacos nachos  Might add nachos white cheese sauce really different any queso tried your choice meat  <EOR> I really Zaba's   fast fresh but most importantly food good   only time really eat Mexican food when visit family home state New Mexico   Vegas when feel eating Mexican food here   know authentic but doesn't stop being good   What really place healthy options   Whole wheat tortilla brown rice sweet potato's on   until visit home again mood some Mexican food well place keep coming back too  <EOR> Was going afternoon study session Starbucks next door stopped joint lunch   If close your eyes walk door couldn't tell if you're Zaba's Chipotle Q'doba   hell chains doing?  Back experience    I ordered Steak Burrito w Pinto Beans Rice Cheese Guacamole Sour Cream Salsa Hot Sauce Whole Wheat Tortilla   course Guac extra   also ordered side Chips Queso Dip     yeah hungry   They front there's no wait   bottle Water wash down   The Burrito so so     it ranks distant 3rd behind Q'doba Chipotle me   Steak little tough didn't much flavor   Hot Sauce Beans Guac all flavor   Whole Wheat Tortilla tasty     don't know if healthy but going just tell myself believe OK?  The Chips Queso Dip very good     but gaining poundage each bite     started regret ordering it     tasted awesome but felt guilty consuming extra calories   Overall OK   Will return?  Eh    maybe  <EOR>
