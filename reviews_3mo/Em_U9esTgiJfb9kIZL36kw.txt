I've quite few times month Februany aka $5 footlongs anything except premium subs  Since closest spot home think time review   The service consistently fast food just fine  also no problems redeeming survey code free cookie if don't know check back your receipt next time   Preparation seems pretty consistent except occasion where might skimped bit chipotle mayo  kinda small but aren't all? Only things stopping being 5 star fast food chain restaurant white guy haven't caught name constantly tries upsell  He asks if want more cheese whatnot gets annoying   Note self keep getting sub toasted because seems $5 41 both toasted untoasted  <EOR>
