On most recent visit tried Philly Cheesesteak everything fries $7 99  some potential but unless mozzarella cheese used unless chef folds cheese into meat instead melting top sandwich cannot attain greatness  meat itself shaved steak but appears decent quality good use onions peppers  fries very crispy in between thin thick  Previously really good Chicken parm sandwich lunch special  Probably should try pizza but late nite delivery sometimes over rules top quality although picked order friendly counter guy  <EOR> So terrible worth going into details brief    spaghetti sauce pizza sauce interchangeable a calzone just dough mozzarella cheese microwaving frozen chicken fingers pizza topping just plain gross unsanitary kind conditions your shop  One Star  <EOR> This place worth ordering from! ordered supreme thinking wrong it    Well pizza looked ingredients tossed pizza came oven  enough cheese tasted tomato sauce dough some veggies    The service also horrible! ordered delivery receiving flyer under resort room door  When driver delivered pizza he told supposed order Parmesan cheese crushed peppers when placing order  When delivering hotel resort should necessary some handy especially when mention staying hotel resort when placing order!   When called complain pizza mention lack cheese peppers repeat complaint two different people! assuming manager last speak he very very rude!! Telling normally don't automatically cheese peppers hand because staying grand view resort which furnished condos  Any hotel furnished condo idiot!! resort does differ hotel any way other reservations fees  guy assumed resort also meant full stocked fridge pantry order save money having driver always carry peppers cheese???   Not mention complaint pizza also taken lightly! told first person complain food 20 years!! Maybe because customers normally already drunk time pizza late night no difference them  guy then proceeded tell could call back morning repeat complaint day manager  ordered pizza 830pm good calling next morning going disgusting dinner!! told would send driver 30 miles deliver better pizza  Um Did he realize could google them see only 8 miles away! even if far why would advertise under door if willing drive us! never such horrible service food!!  I guess Little Italy Pizza doesn't care customer service customer retention because market hotels resorts which contain people only few days time! Very very disappointed place if could would flyers placed under each resort hotel door review them    I would definitely suggest Rosati's Pizza instead! aren't open late night but if you're looking decent pizza dinner vacation would suggest Rosati's  Save Little Italy Pizza your drunken nights If absolutely don't any other choice  <EOR> We work major hotels strip   work grave shift since place stayed open late decided order them    The chicken fingers looked overcooked stale fries  We ordered full bucket chickn wings MILD 32 pieces only 1 2 bucket 16 pieces HOT  When called owner extremely rude made feel lying   He asked if ate wings he wanted them back   He never apologized offered any compensation  Our order came $52   you would think would little bit customer service   When asked long driver would he said he'll when he gets !!  Yes!  OWNER! When driver returned told knew wasn't fault but very disappointed   fact he only good thing place    And guess what?  When wings box melted sauce put side containers covers weren't even on   all sauce leaked everywhere  Wish could post pictures could see horrible place is   DON'T ORDER PLACE! <EOR>
