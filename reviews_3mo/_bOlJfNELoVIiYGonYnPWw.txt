I came thinking a sushi house east side must taste crap    wasn't bad thought would be    But still pretty bad  Some rolls good but most okay  MOCHI  gross   love mochi! But couldn't force myself eat it  came little plastics fortune cookie    Since china Agogo sushi house aloha Agogo all connected servers confused lot  Servers trying though! <EOR> Sushi House located inside China Go    Its small kitchen extends where Aloha used there's still some Aloha's items menu!   The sushi wasn't best worst town   serve la carte AYCE which currently $19 95 lunch 23 95 dinner   could tell some seafood just thawed but old   few items stood apart Hurricane Roll Hotate fresh scallop nigiri green tea ice cream rich green tea flavor    We received great service waitress saw she waiting tables China hard worker!  Also Asian modern decor beautiful inside comes tatami room great if you're big group want privacy   Overall place if want your sushi fix don't want drive far if live Sunrise Manor area  <EOR> This place right down st me! always China right next door figured I'd give try  immediately seated didn't wait long that  Once made order took waitress 15 minutes appetizers seaweed salad kept bringing wrong orders 30 minutes into being seat finally brought 1  ONE correct roll! waitresses waiters kept going back forth restaurant another place particular owns 3 different restaurants right next each other! All orders coming tables seemed wrong  very disorganized no seemed going on  45 minutes only 2 rolls brought table  eventually couldn't wait any longer decided leave   The only reason why might give them second chance because owner apologized only charged 10 dollars some drinks rolls ordered let take them go  But definitely need more help organization before give them another chance  <EOR> The spicy tuna roll red dragon roll surprisingly delicious  happy able order place literally around corner  husband definitely planning return try more items menu! China favorite now including upgraded sushi menu  awesome! <EOR> So skeptical but decided give try boy huge mistake  oil used fry rolls old tasted burnt oil horrible  struggled finish then eating noticed hair sticking rolls gross  never return establishment  <EOR> Man fuck all reviews just done eating wasn't bad  All rolls decent   service typical asians   but asian service usually sucks everywhere anyways  but overall good  mochi subpar too   but rolls 20 bucks I'd again    maybe    #Eastside $$$$ !!!! <EOR> Being new feel still going through working works doesn't work  said food actually pretty close most typical fried roll fair most all eat places town  close house don't across town  only thing think need work nigiri  doesn't seem fresh should  wait staff attentive polite    I give higher star if better quality fresh nigiri rolls until then am sticking cooked rolls need serve beer sake  hope stays around though ton potential  <EOR>
