Delicious   Very affordable  wife Cuban cook way San Antonio del Los Banos Cuba very very happy breakfast!   A+++++  <EOR> I would give 3 5 stars    food pretty good plates HUGE! not sure if liked not    cocktail delicious    The service however pretty slow inconsistent  cocktail arrived food both took long  served few waitresses no exactly took care aware needs throughout meal    Also check arrived before asked even thought 24h restaurant didn't really feel taking look desserts anything    All all good place if you're area super hungry but wouldn't stand line if there's any effort come  <EOR> Screwed order  Twice  Also took 30 min dinner 1 3 tables  staying ceases week would very convenient come back but happening  Very disappointing  <EOR> Good food presentation  Blood Mary little spicer offered but overall good  <EOR> Came bunch girls because staying Caesars only place open past 11pm     Food RIDICULOUSLY overpriced   bowl French onion soup   Cost $18 including tax automatic gratuity for parties 8 more    Service sucked   Waters unrefilled   When asked someone more water he only refilled mine everyone else table   told waitress wanted bill split   She brought split   Stars only food   edible good but worth almost $20   Only if you're desperate  <EOR> Stopped Cafe Americano breakfast early arrival Las Vegas    Cafe Americano located right main entrance Caesars Palace casino open 24 hours  menu reasonably concise selection easy  traditional Eggs Benedict which served potato hash  Hash perfectly crispy very well seasoned always case I'm sure relate that   eggs just touch overlooked would wish Hollandaise sauce pour bit more generous but overall quite tasty dish I'm somewhat nit picking    What problem prices know Las Vegas but $22 eggs Benedict steep I guess live $5 coffee comes refills   Interestingly enough pasta dish dinner menu costs $25 hard figure pricing strategy   Well during late night might your only option anyway    <EOR> We tried place cause looked pretty nice but say over pricy quality food  service sucks!  We asked waitress jelly toast he defiantly forgot us  Waited 10minutes receipt  top burger tomato sticker it  <EOR> $138 dollars eggs pancakes tea chocolate milk 2 adults 1 senior toddler I charged $9dlls side bacon 2 strips bacon place rip off!  told under new management but place historically bad   My advise don't eat might well hit buffet pay less lot more variety  BTW order skinny omelet good all   the service Ok food took quite while everything else pancakes eggs where just ok great worth money    <EOR> Disclaimer Food consumed while highly intoxicated  It's 2 30 AM friend walking down strip when smelled bacon  followed noses into Caesar's Palace found Cafe Americano  both ordered All American Breakfast $20   bacon disappointment  stifle urges scream because happy bacon  big portion couldn't finish it  Took home leftovers ate again 6 hours later  potatoes STILL delicious even when ate cold  Only strange thing many different people serving wasn't quite sure waiter was  Maybe due partially intoxication anyway ask twice ketchup but might've because asked wrong person ketchup first time   Summary 1  Food overpriced  Welcome Vegas  2  Breakfast delicious  3  Bacon  <EOR> My friends came club   Good thing they're 24 hours   order some drinks along fish chips other finger foods   Everything tasted good   glad sriracha   scarfed down  We didn't finish everything server boxes   Then needed more another server it   asked some sriracha he said didn't it   liar   called calling liar   Moments later he returned box container sriracha     Our main server awesome   He did everything expect beyond  <EOR> Waited 15 minutes prominent area restaurant completely ignored left avoid!! <EOR> Excellent late night eats! Cuban sandwich w pulled pork ham pickles fries massive deelish  Easily shared between 2 people    Totally worth $20 price tag! <EOR> If looking terrible 6 dollar breakfast cost 50 dollars then your place! <EOR> Great accessible 24 hour place  am sucker breakfast food tried both place Cafe Bellagio  place wins easily   First all ever so slightly cheaper Cafe Bellagio okay $1 $2 isn't much but still   Don't wrong don't eat drink places Caeser's Palace Bellagio save money but still indicative factor   Second hash browns much better CB smaller portion BUT also toast  CB toast separate side item cost extra  What   Third toast comes unbuttered portion butter yourself  Thank you! More places need this!  Fourth service once seated phenomenal  believe helped Ryan K least  receipt he prompt courteous professional checked back often ensure everything needed  More servers need this!  Getting seated however disastrous  wasn't even busy  Lots open tables but each group line setting tables ad hoc  Maybe came right huge rush left? don't know docking any stars just felt being third line wait kind laughable   Will definitely back  <EOR> Took server 15minutes come us  Shockingly overpriced  order wrong  Gave stone cold fries  pizza chopped salad ok nothing special  also came night before piece grilled chicken takeaway dog took 30 minutes more  <EOR>
