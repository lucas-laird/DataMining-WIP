<EOR> Very good food even better service  The only thing criticize always play classic rock  love classic rock just much next guy but music doesn't quite fit place  music zaps energy right place could really awesome atmosphere  <EOR> Reading over reviews submitted far Toros am baffled   Most yelpers rave wonderful food few exceptions thought food fine but pricey   couldn't disagree more camp   First food   fairly strict standard eating out Trader Joe's frozen entrees   Huh wha??  Lemme 'splain     while back discovered Trader Joe's offers remarkably good frozen food no good making everything scratch fresh ingredients but orders magnitude better any other frozen cuisine   sampling few dishes decided if restaurant wasn't noticeably better TJ's frozen just worth it    when decided never again eat likes Friday's Bennigan's Outback etc   Mind restaurant doesn't fancy   eat hot dog stand long serves really good dogs   Although Trader Joe's doesn't offer Spanish tapas pretty sure if did they'd helluva lot better menu Toros   Wow morass mediocrity   Started chicken saffron sauce braised oxtail   chicken no flavor just bland white meat chicken saffron sauce just tasted generic cream sauce straight some bottle   braised oxtail meat OK but sauce drowning off   If kept meat vegetables weird sauce OK   Then ordered bacon wrapped dates grilled asparagus seared salmon   bacon wrapped dates tasted awfully generic   don't know difference but b w dates Jaleo thousand times better   grilled asparagus aioli best dish night although  damning faint praise   seared salmon spinach garlic sauce nowhere nearly good whatever frozen salmon dish Trader Joe's   didn't realize garlic sauce until saw menu just now because tasted flavorless white cream sauce tasted same supposedly saffron cream sauce guessing Toros's saffron Yellow Dye #something    salmon overcooked therefore bit dry lacking flavor   spinach horribly salty   Finally dessert   Apparently Spanish version rice pudding rice pudding cinnamon sprinkled top   If you're craving rice pudding buy Costco Costco rice pudding worlds better stuff Toros   The atmosphere left somewhat annoyed   server bartender I ate bar very nice but bit annoying because instead asking things she kept asking Isn't everything just amazing?  Isn't food fantastic?  Don't just love it? No no HELL no   ordered glass sangria $6 cheap red wine mixed 7 lot ice   Toros also Nevada style pub which means video poker bar   most meal group playing machines quite raucous when celebrating every little win   criticizing them but prepared if eat here   The thing criticizing Toros prices   menu prices all very reasonable   50% off Groupon but even full price bill large quantity food ordered wouldn't come much   Also happy hour forget hours when lot items half price   If you're idea great steakhouse Outback great Italian Olive Garden then you'll probably love Toros   Me?  save money Jaleo   If opportunity eat 52 meals Toros same price 1 meal Jaleo I'd savor meal Jaleo enjoy heated Trader Joe's rest year  <EOR> Found place happenstance while trying find Albertsons  came Monday discovered half off tapas special  admittedly little crazy boy glad did! tapas amazing  ordered grilled asparagus tempura artichoke hearts sea scallops calimari ribs ox tail  All dishes incredible    Unfortunately escargot  Guess leaves something next time! finished dinner off Spanish coffee lava cake    We definitely back friends family too! <EOR> We excited neighborhood bar besides John Cutters! don't penis don't gamble nor play golf yet great service unlike sister restaurant next door     Ronald Rheanna such professional friendly bartenders all could ever hope for!!!
