Portion Price ratio awesome!  We came lunch because advertisement coupon $5 off $10+ bill we aren't cheap frugal! We 4 soft tacos 2carne asana 1 carnitas 1 chicken Taquitos Carne asada fries The bill came little over $12 00 coupon!    The carne asada really dry kibble ish both dishes  carne asada fries chocked loaded cheese pico  used battered type french fry which kinda threw off normal french fries which prefer The carnitas shredded chicken tacos great! Both moist full flavor  stars lunch!  I'd dare give place 4 stars but take star away because salsa bar  horrendous dire need attention  salsa levels all low plastic cups lids every bin  Thank goodness didn't need any salsa since carne asada fries tacos loaded pico    For price taste portion size  good alternative those taco chain guys down road  <EOR>
