Though quite sure    I would say hostesses greeting guests very friendly welcoming bartender served however friendly only gets far    First took look beer wine list beer list quite extensive many questions different beers unfortunately bartender didn't know very much even know pronounce them  also server frozen drinks which thought bit odd considering all inside definitely isn't pool    Next many manager  owner type guys looming around maybe owned place maybe not   Now understand first night but none guys really seemed professionals weren't greeted them asked enjoyed ourselves anything  reason knew something place because seemed set shop corner bar doing work eating drinking it big glup type drink classy all view guests  If manager owner should greeting ever guest walking your door opening night just your buddies ask everyone doing    The food good actually rating review on  roasted cauliflower which favorites anywhere  super oily though probably wouldn't order again  summer squash flatbread great boyfriend really enjoyed oxtail empanadas  None dishes die but good   If place going more sports bar tapas experience then probably won't running back especially if owners managers carried themselves way did  <EOR> Welcome addition Fremont St  Great value good cooking  From doorman servers staff hospitable very well intentioned  Tried Charred Kale salad beets lightly pickled Pedro Ximenez addictive  Lots tasty vegetarian offerings Curried cauliflower dates bold full flavored  Pig ears Oxtail empanadas just two many Chef driven offerings   I'll definitely returning try remainder menu  <EOR> Food Cocktails Service amazing!

 bigger bowl mini shovel would work better   I'd couple hits whatever chef smoking when he thought one      The Chicken Red Velvet Waffle Slider eye catcher all its color but crispier waffle would made functional sandwich instead sloppiness plate   fried chicken itself crispy very juicy   would down just bucket that   Definitely worth returning but eating all deconstructed fork knife next time   One dish avoided Roasted Cauliflower    extreme char masked any signs seasoning   place Carson starts G does incredible version this   excellent Street Corn instead save extra bucks and room Therapy's great desserts carrot cake smores     3 7623235799213 stars  <EOR> It's neat see Therapy become especially considering where started  used complete dump horrible tourist gift shop now nicer lounge type restaurants area  only does Therapy full bar if you're looking just stop drink but dining areas both downstairs upstairs  another great example revitalization downtown   Our first visit somewhat short one  just finished dinner around corner decided stop drink  Alongside handful beers tap few signature cocktails house made sangrias  ridiculously hot days Vegas even offer some frozen drinks  decided give Smash!
