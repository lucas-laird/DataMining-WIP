Cons Parking bit funky since end building  I recommend Pancit bihon binagoongan bagoong fried rice beef bulalo soft beef soup melon juice  I've just moved Las Vegas hunt Filipino food leaving favorite place San Diego behind  chose place because website menu online! hoping add pictures every menu item website mom let stomachs eyes order   called order drove 20 minutes restaurant  showed day before Grand Opening missed restaurant when drove down road they nice bright sign now though can't miss it ! promptly greeted food brought right away    My mom loves talk enjoyed fun conversation everyone  try melon juice halo halo glad did  melon juice shredded melon boba   add shaved ice melon juice shredded melon bottom  Super yummy especially hot day  mom couldn't agree halo halo though  simple halo halo while mom loves loaded halo halo tons stuff like cup full beans jellies fruit D'Pinoy's halo halo definitely more simple maybe quarter full   loved but sure mom ask more fixings next time  Philippines might seem small country but many regional differences  Some people just prefer things certain way because region grew in    We ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai fried bangus milkfish beef kaldereta chicken curry pancit bihon binagoongan fried rice beef bulalo  loved pancit but mom didn't care tofu took all   chicken curry bones but chicken very soft fall right off it  beef beef bulalo super soft absolutely delicious  binagoongan rice wasn't expecting it mangoes tomatoes side never seen before but absolutely delicious  Very unique very tasty!

Staff nice food yummy! Im def going back! <EOR> Dinner Saturday night   Lumpia average  Pork belly tonkatsu Japanese spin lechon panko coating works well  oxtail kare kare bland until notice condiment brought it   OMG!  shrimp paste totally transformed dish   much ask buy some   chef came explained don't enough sell   He did give 1 oz container take home   come back shrimp paste everything ordered  <EOR> Was looking good filipino sit down style food open 9 30am saw new place which wasn't far    We good experience  Pancit Canton really tasty sisig great lumpiang shanghai very well done too  Bicol express pretty good well    Service good  food arrived 10 15 minutes hot freshly done  <EOR> Couple times  place  First second time really it    Serving pretty good food very tasty  decided bring friends disappointed tonkatsu very greasy serving small food isn't good anymore   Took awhile before take orders     Then tried them again ordered food ordered sinigang pansit very  disappointed only serving small sinigang no taste its all vegetables  Hope next time good experience     <EOR> If considering try their chicken skin lechong kawali tosilog bbq pork bangusilog bicol express yes try them  they're all *good   The bangus bit smaller expected lechong kawali chicken skin could little crispier   If bicol express think you're gonna love bicol express! all tried bicol express impressive!  Almost all groups same time ordered bulalo assuming bulalo good  We're gonna try next time crave Filipino food   Having said all if prices little higher servings little smaller probably would think twice giving them 4 stars  <EOR> Came back visit Vegas moving Nevada  Getting Filipino food neck woods tough  great place  Food point service fast friendly  Wish place around when local  <EOR> Visiting Chicago always excited filipino food west coast since Chicago lacks that  Don't wrong great places but just enough  Came across place night dad lives Vegas he says new lets give try! why not? Lets just say place great! Food authentic delicious! prices weren't bad all! think though could possibly add little more design menu but hey food price matters most! ordered kare kare lechon kawali miki bihon pancit tortang talong binagoongan crispy pata   they good! melon drink point! Loved looking forward coming back next visit   already drooling thinking =P <EOR> I am rating place based food because place decent staff super nice  pancit palabok which disappointing because bland ordered didnt any fish sauce sprinkle  add saltiness bummed! pork sinigang good lot meat sourness just right   shanghai just okay nothing would rave about  biggest offense cassava cake hard rock nothing cassava cake taste am familiar felt ripped off buying whole thing straight trash  Buy your own risk rice cakes  <EOR> I've looking place fill void Salo Salo Grill left since horrible health inspections  going actually keep eating until family eat dinner before wedding day mom's boyfriend bad case diarrhea night  Hopefully D' Pinoy Joint stays SNHD's radar    This place street Cafe de Cebu  trouble wait time food Cafe de Cebu especially when they're waiting lechon cooked delivered but haven't issue here  Some favorite dishes chicken skin lechon  tonkatsu lunch plate also just another way referring lechon well  thought crispy pata bit dry always lechon if want pig out  Mang Tomas sauce but usually own sauce 1 part soy sauce 1 part lemon lime    The servers always polite efficient visited soon grand opening  just glad another Filipino option Westside hope rest dishes yet try disappoint  yet save room favorite dessert halo halo  <EOR> Going back again try other dishes Maybe some dinner meetings there Homey atmosphere Friendly Will definately take out Loni Catapang Andal Phil Am Lions President 2014 <EOR> If good filipino breakfast served evening friend found D Pinoys   arrived dinner breakfast weekday night service fast food just hit spot! <EOR> We crazy come place cater daughter's 1st Birthday Baptism when just opened   Nobody tell food yelp back then pretty much down first review     Kathy helped when arrived   She answered all questions best she could   Even speaking phone add more food later she very helpful efficient     We ordered 3 trays everything   Tonkatsu special version Lechon Kawali   Probably best lechon Kawali ish ever had   stays crunchy even hours later   hit   Chicken curry flavorful popular party   People kept asking cooked it   Inihaw pork guessing they're ilocano because reminded ilocano family would serve Inihaw pork   Cut chunks mixed tomatoes onions   Pretty good but wished cut meat smaller   Pork Menudo really good   Everyone liked it   Lechon yes whole roasted pig   apprehensive ordering lechon during party because all other lechons  ordered town nasty   Since special occasion pretty much bought food presentation better lol   Luckily tasted really good   Didn't nasty pig smell   Skin  super crunchy meat tender flavorful     Overall I'd say earned 5 stars me   hope same great experience next time   Wish closer southern highlands  <EOR> My relatives wanted Filipino food thanks yelp  dining area alright but food service wasn't really good  dishes came all different times portions kinda small price especially appetizers  way tastier  don't know options around Filipino food but sure better  Some things Lumpia shanghai small portion looked frozen kind   Crispy chicken skin no flavor just tasted fat  Also other pictures double portion size got   Adobo fried rice love adobo fried rice but disappointed meat shredded much could barely taste much oil left plate didn't really flavor!  Lechon kawali crispy again didn't flavor just tasted oily fatty   Sinigang best thing ordered actually really good but everything else such let down! Meh    <EOR>
