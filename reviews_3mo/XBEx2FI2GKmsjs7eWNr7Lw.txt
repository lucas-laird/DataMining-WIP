Anyways pull before say anything guy tells hang sec  10 minutes finally say ready order  no response still then someone came inside wrote down order notepad  He didn't apologize state why wasn't ordering through speaker just asked wanted  thought little weird  Then pull window  10 more minutes different guy comes window says sorry we're understaffed today  walked away before chance say anything  now 20 minutes  No total order no food nothing  10 more minutes by  guy took order finally comes window  just simply asked speak manager  He begins say he giving bagel free McDonald's  told could smoothie clean blender under 3 minutes long did really take him? He never answered question  He also asked if wanted cancel order said no  sure why he said anything when first thing did ask manager  During guy behind literally pulled backwards left drive through brought up  He said  fine presumed walk away  Then he came back said manager didn't want talk because busy  no words  just asked total  He gave walked away without making any exchange  now 35 minutes later know because tweeted right when manager comes window  He says wanted talk me? said didn't want talk me  He says well apologize but McDonald's bagel's house  told could pay $2 just wanted food  He then asked want cancel your order? never implied even told other guy no  just said no  brought guy leaving drive through well exact words don't care  least other guy said  fine  Then manager asked balance was  said tell don't work here  must've last straw something because he then said he refusing service told come back shut locked drive through window  no signs refusing anyone service any signs all window  appalled  literally waited 35 40 minutes rejected service  frustrated 30 minutes but used no profanity  even offered still pay bagel  Apparently manager turns owner think son other guy dealing with  Don't here  <EOR> Highly recommend place  boyfriend wrong time because day happened short staffed  But end favor  worker took order apologized saying may take awhile ready  weren't rush willing wait since first time trying Acai Bowl    We ordered Large Acai Bowl $7 99 worker said he would give regular price $6 99 since first time  Turns took 20+ mins finally order  But end he gave 2 Large Acai Bowls free Lets just say boyfriend stoked!!!
