I liked place lot though wouldn't everyone   pretty way down Paradise almost airport very easy miss fact drove once even figured where because thought would driveway facing street but actually turn little early into parking lot   Paradise one way circle around if miss it   Once inside literally only people eating there   kind felt interrupted private conversation when walked two women back room looked though weren't sure why there   Once seated though very friendly willing suggestions order   I've Ethiopian before ordered kitfo friend beef stew entree not sure called but third down main entrees list    winner among two kitfo good but beef stew excellent   ate all way down injera bread then ate all too!  The portions large compared other Ethiopian restaurants eaten at   Two entrees more food two could eat   A few other people came while though few lost looking club next door   time left think two other tables occupied   Overall liked lot would recommend it  <EOR>
