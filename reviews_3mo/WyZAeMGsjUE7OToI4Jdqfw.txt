Yum! Chipotle!  One just opened corner West Sahara Fort Apache where old Blockbuster used sit  Today opening day resist visit? swing around 8 30 work find line around 10 people deep  few tables being used patrons but mostly people ordering go  inside looks every other Chipotle  Granted super clean since today grand opening   I ordered Chicken burrito $5 85 Barbacoa Burrito $6 10 friend  line process did take little bit since employees new  Give them week two feel then lines probably fly faster    The food pretty consistent every other Chipotle  say? Its chain restaurant! definitely still fan Roberto's but see myself dropping once while  <EOR>
