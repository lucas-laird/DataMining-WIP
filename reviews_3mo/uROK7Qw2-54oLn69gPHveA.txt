There two Jave Coast cafes Flamingo Hotel  near strip smoothies pastries coffee yogurt etc   The cafe nearer monorail line crepes  But worth it  They're freshly made but confiture sweet really enjoyable  May choice but rasberry crepe crap  strawberry bit better  But even coffee helped wash down   If must crepe recommend banana bananas looked delicious but again they're caramelized may crazy sweet  Yuck! <EOR>
