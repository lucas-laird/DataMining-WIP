On Saturday nite 6pm NO line always scares HELL but hungry anyways   $12 99 per person no 1 2 price kids  buffet small 6 stations salad dessert asian southern carving station mexican   way limited 6 8 items per station nothing special   The best thing having wait but also meant kept food way long alot items dried being under heat lamp long   I don't understand why chinese food made advance anyways everything freakin chicken cooks WOK 60 seconds!   Wouldn't add some flare people coming back  everything looked dried pastey sauces just going plate even picture buffet BAD! The majority stations just that Food sitting way long   I stuck soup salad desserts but did some decent ribs really good medium rare prime rib liked cream spinach   Strange thing salad bar they attendant because far reach behind sneeze guard items  WEIRD!  The 2 best things SERVICE NO line  never once wait drinks napkins handy wipes plentiful   If dont waiting line are good soup salad some prime rib $13 give otherwise just average best  <EOR>
