I'm sad give place low rating because pizza smelled really good  16 in  Boston Garden Pizza garlic knots  pizza well average best  Nothing special though   The garlic knots brought whole opinion place down  didn't look fresh  didn't taste fresh  ate chewy bad way    just appetizing all  Especially appetizer  Hehe! Yeah bad  Anyway definitely 25 dollars worth pizza  <EOR>
