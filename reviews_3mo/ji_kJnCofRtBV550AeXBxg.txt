Shout Nelson Q having good eye letting know business opened today! myself down 30 minutes heads up   Dedicated!  I arrived expecting chain  based Hawaii  Unfortunately independently owned all Bale used back home but  where disappointment ends  owner seeing sad expression enthusiastically told much better place looking for   lot live since childhood memories pate banh mi   I came knowing going order pate sandwich but didn't see menu  Upon asking told could pate sandwich asked if wanted without butter  opted no butter letting pate own rich thing   The sandwich huge only $2! sure if regular pricing grand opening pricing seeing all other banh mi $3 45 which own pretty competitive Vegas  The bread crusty crisp outside while light buttery inside perfect! Way better Mr  Sandwich par Dakao  vegetables just right cut richness smear chicken pate which actually minimally applied  cilantro provided herbal kick love dearly  Jalapeños heat  Sriracha because   Well   Sriracha every table equipped it  Based bread veggies alone major banh mi contender LV China Town strip   They offer lot soups deli items well though sandwich just right unable bring myself sample anything else   And nice plus hot jasmine tea brought when sat down brewed just right bitter    Update! speaking owner he also owns Dakao road but he says he likes bread better because different oven  = <EOR> Their sandwiches best town same owner Dakao sandwiches    freshness light crispness bread perfection   personally think better Lee's sandwich Vegas     I tried soup bun bo hue decent   Little noodle meat large bowl soup the owner nice he even apologized brought plate extra meat    soup itself wasn't greasy other restaurants  plus   give them lot credit side  toppings dish    something pay really close attention fresh greens quantity proper types toppings give particular dish   give 5 star one!  But other hand think best order known sandwiches P  The Vietnamese coffee jasmine green tea pretty good point can't wrong there     As desserts full ordered coconut jello go   drive home enough time more room try pretty good! Can't wait check other freshly made desserts next time!!   As customer service owner older lady front really sweet ! <EOR> The food place sad restaurant service itself even sadder  new restaurant think need work few kinks overhead lighting super quiet interior  quiet bright harsh place felt overwhelmed while sitting eating food    As food asked banh canh soup house sandwich  banh canh tasted alright despite odiferous emission coming off it  why noodle pink!? Meanwhile house sandwich little hollow limp looking  tasted good otherwise    Just additional note shouldn't cleaning floor while customers inside eating  strong pinesol bleach scent does intertwine well whatever eating    Oh isn't Ba Le ?? should space between ba  le sign front otherwise  name place bale bale hay  Just sayin'! <EOR> Yesterday eating pho same plaza guys decided worth shot pick sandwich to go  chose banh mi dac biet #1 which $3 65  other sandwiches just $3 45   I've heard guys same owner Dakao which offers $3 25 sandwiches  means Ba Le should little better  can't really distinguish two shops' offerings unfortunately  Maybe there's slightly more meat but there's still major dearth veggies overabundance bread which again why don't typically Subway   top some cilantro did reach sandwich yellow  Spoiler alert good cilantro yellow   I've grown appreciate pho offerings Las Vegas recent weeks but still sold banh mi thit all  If want experience type sandwich would better wait until you're good place California  <EOR> Just when thought could one family tell them new Vietnamese sandwich shop opened   turns already knew Ba Le tried practically everything menu  turn    For sandwiches #1 Dac Biet just squirt some sriracha perfect sandwich  love when order sandwiches take home ask if want them toast bread toast when home  love bread crunch! usually don't add all extra veggies sandwich but rest assured family claims fresh delicious    Now absolute favorite item menu actually congee!!! called Chao Long giant bowl only $4! absolutely steal! actually drive all way Spring Mountain just eat and to go order home well   love meat ratio too  definitely fill up    Their interior definitely needs little   Improvement  However still coming eat because offer complimentary tea while dine love Che Ba Mau translation three color dessert fresh! Vietnamese dessert sweetened red beans yellow mung bean green pandan jelly served crushed ice coconut sauce  If haven't tried yet you're missing out! matter opinion but pretty sure best Che Ba Mau's town    I look forward trying more things menu Bun Bo Hue  <EOR> I came expecting place Alhambra CA   disappointed    bánh mi little more expensive other establishments but thought worth try    ordered #1 special expecting quite good  But when bite down found bread crusty old   wasn't much meat inside also lacking flavour   only couple restaurant eating   looks place won't staying around long  <EOR> Another beloved exotic eats place Hawaii turned upside down franchising!  Ba Le Hawaii most decent places Vietnamese food!  introduced it   time Ba Le Sandwiches snack came your Hawaiian Airlines flight Hawaii West Coast!    Let elephant way first   Ba Le Big Lots all wrong signing mentioned another review   Two separate words  BA   LE!  BALE!  funny!  Dunno messed signage looks franchise owner wasn't watching crew day   Being fan Ba Le back when used live Maui upon entering location kinda let down   mean middle lunch   no rush?  Empty tables?  Limited signage foods numbers?  What's going on?  All BAD signs   should turned around left   But bit bullet walked counter   Only picture menu sandwiches   Nothing noodles bowls ones used remember   Banh Mi sandwiches run average price all other places town between $3 $4 each   ordered #1 House Special D B  otherwise known Dac Biet   $3 65   Upon ordering sandwich checked other items most Viet places wrapped counter   love some Shrimp Spring Rolls but ones sitting counter $3 pretty warm touch?  Pass   weren't even sitting cooler fridge normally don't mind long fresh hour ago but didn't bother one   Super warm!  sauce looked bit more watery like   Could tell sitting possibly early morning   Hello salmonella!  Took good 5 7 minutes sandwich come back kitchen   came wrapped required white paper rubber band around   still nice toasty outside made back 5 minute drive back office still warm   Upon opening sandwich very average   Meats but pretty scarce   Smaller portions pate cold cuts head cheese would like   bread good size a bit smaller Dakao but crunchy outside chewy inside intact   veggies sparse textured would them love fresh snap!  happened jalapenos?  Mine missing   sandwich didn't enough mayo mix ran bit dry especially towards end bread   Overall just OK sandwich   price would expected more ingredients   It's funny hard sandwiches   I'm sure back Ba Le or BALE anytime soon trying pho   Each table missing key condiment Viet food hoisin sauce!  didn't see bottle anywhere!  Maybe hide back something   probably give them another chance sandwich just eat comparison   Ba Le should run similar special Mr  Sandwich Dakao   buy 5 1 free   Maybe attract more customers?  hate see place never busy   The lady taking order very pleasant time around no bad service me   However take note   no cards!  Cash only!  Luckily $5 emergency bill handy wallet pay     Ah Ba Le Sandwiches   how miss so   BALE place supposed your franchised stores just isn't cutting far   Please fix fix fast! <EOR> I love banh mi but restaurant just isn't user friendly if don't read Vietnamese   enjoyed banh mi take philly though probably back   Wish could read if vietnamese iced coffee but only english picture board sandwiches  <EOR> Was hungry decided buy sandwich  ordered Dac Biet sandwich  When finally little portion meats vegestable  Plus bread hard rock! another restaurant buy something else eat! Wouldn't recommend place all! <EOR>
