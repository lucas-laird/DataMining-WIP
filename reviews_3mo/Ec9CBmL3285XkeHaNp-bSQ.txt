Just because large party come catered them first when already hours haven't eaten yet   finally food nearly going now two hours waiting   sent mine back because filled onions   them take off   all mess quite pretty funny kept checking every minute second when staff nearly forgot hours   friend impressed handled mess   top off billed end all big apology   point going back District awhile until figure fix mess because happen anyone well  <EOR> Oxtail pho! Yum yum yum!  I kept seeing place pop yelp decided give try  Turns pho 1's owner's son runs place! family going pho 1 years when found super excited  mom restaurant first she waiting outside   soon Khai saw he ran told he'd table started while she waited rest arrive  awesome service  felt VIPs P  Not your typical vietnamese pho place  common pho combos also offer variety other fresh seafood items  oxtail pho  $12 pricey side pho    but totally worth it  bowl came 3 huge pieces oxtail! also comes side dipping sauce meat  Mix them squeeze little bit lemon its delicious!  My sister Mi Sate  came looked delicious but definitely not  tasted someone took half jar peanut butter mixed soup  Way peanut y sweet  fan   One other minor complaint place very Vietnamese mother difficult time ordering specific pho combo she wanted  menu basics  She typically gets pho chin tai nam    menu  Totally problem but when she tried order both mother waitresses confused  Neither them spoke Vietnamese  don't mind all but know mom wasn't happy  She'd more comfortable going solely Vietnamese speaking establishment probably wont coming family but know sure back some friends! really wanna try Lobster Pho!!!!! <EOR> I am absolutely lust place! would give 5 stars but all first item ordered second choice Item took 15 mins longer come rest tables order    Although really enjoyed food service awesome!! felt food prices par food quality  decided skip cocktail because prices seemed little high off the strip    I plan going back soon because enjoyed much! <EOR> I've tried place twice now hoping find something really tbh don't find anything special food wise  tried several items menu pho steak eggs spring rolls but none them really stood out    In summary experience cool modern say but food quite bland  Vietnamese coffee must try good place date being music super loud intense  <EOR> The Oxtail Pho wonderful!  At reasonable price Oxtail Pho $11 95 LOADED Oxtail bones oily flavorful pho broth   VERY GOOD!    Portion size very fair well!  meat much more tender most    this would favorite rendition date!  I really wanted try Lobster Pho around $27 market price but am VERY happy able try Oxtail here!  Just gives reason come back again Service quick efficient restaurant itself looked clean inviting   I back! <EOR> Went large group birthday celebration   Waitress staff attentive thorughout night  restaurant decor pleasing soothing lamost place would visit if near beach coast  music ambience modern enjoyable   The food menu few selections which good many options times seems things complicated  ordered Edemame appetizers thrilled sauce  Belly Buns delicious Beef Lemongrass Skewers love lemongrass stick encompassed beef order enhance flavor   Pho dishes wish lean meat option vegetable Pho happy veggies frozen but freshly cut   Overall experience even clitches large parties being able split checks worth coming here  recommend it  <EOR> I'm little disappointed place considering all hype heard others  experience wasn't close others may gone through  came boyfriend little before noon way before crowd even started come in  ordered pho nam braised pork belly egg rolls  pho nam wasn't great expected  When coming vietnamese restaurant you'd think flavor would some tradition bland flavor  seemed though broth altered delicious you'd expect  waited dish arrive braised pork started notice other customers came way ordered started dish before mine  asked waiter waitress where order already ten minutes pho came out  said back order kitchen  heck back order when no yet when ordered?! great cover up   but really because told them no when ordered just looked stumped          time finally did arrive which 20 minutes later     food looked sitting under warmer whole time did taste it    For place received many great reviews highly disappointed  Rather parent company Pho 1 which actually great food food come time instead making excuses  Only Reason getting two stars because decided give 15% off meal  extra star  <EOR> Items Selected District Kitchen Bar Tamarind Chicken Wings Green Papaya Salad Shrimp Pork Mint Crushed Roasted Peanut Fish Tacos Yellowtail Avocado Cilantro Cherry Tomato Oxtail Pho The Big Bone Soup Bone Marrow Soup Slow Braised Pork Belly Young Coconut Juice Boiled Egg Steamed Jasmine Rice 1lb Shrimp D1 Goodness Medium Heat  Occupying former home Cravin' Cajun serving modern Vietnamese cuisine room part hipster industrial part sports bar group five sat down District Kitchen Bar just minutes noon focusing order variety results proved 'variable' best   Clearly untrained understaffed handle restaurant nearly 3 4 full 12 30 trio appetizers meal began beverage refills scarce servers ran circles perhaps fortuitous none first round proved remotely spicy hamachi tacos bright crisp $3 each while dull limp wings vinegar tinged salad proved entirely forgettable   and particularly 'Vietnamese' all   Moving next larger scale items duo pho dishes would prove respectable if particularly well presented supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles meaty sapor while enormous proximal femur laced its broth fat balance ample scallions though heat remained mute even presence sliced jalapenos   Moving finally items showed kitchen's promise suffice say tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft coconut milk proved far most complex option afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness although seemingly odd choice throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered spice department pound snappy shell ons again leaving water glass empty while wondering why hadn't just gone Crab Corner Hot n' Juicy instead  <EOR> Yummy Lobster Pho!
