I've few various Wing Stop locations around Vegas Henderson definitely favorite far   isn't located right next donut shop there's no temptation dessert afterwards!  The tables restaurant always pretty clean   The usual guy Steve total hoot   He's great dynamic guy encourages team friendly fun personable folks instead fast food zombies   THE WINGS!  good   your wings fresh  order wait but completely worth it!  They best fast food french fries world   No seriously   No really   YES!  Most business take out small place always easily accommodate dine customers   Customers option order wings online over phone pick up   A few tips Unless soggy chicken wouldn't recommend boneless wings boneless strips   great chunks chicken breast but sauces really sogg breading just sort cause them bleh out  Atomic should come surgeon general's warning   love hot spicy foods but ridiculous  <EOR>
