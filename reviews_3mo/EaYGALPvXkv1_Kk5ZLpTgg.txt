Boars Head meats cheeses      Salads great burgers best far      Yummy <EOR> The sandwich tasty especially if LOT bread   The fries ordered delicious even staff members couldn't resist eating them while making sandwich! I saw two employees eating fries through hole kitchen wall sandwich presumably being made     Maybe  why quantity fries small   The staff seemed inexperienced  Won't back because prefer thin bread don't enjoy seeing employees eating fries prep area while laughing making awkward eye contact counter mid chew  <EOR>
