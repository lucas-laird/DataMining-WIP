Boasted only traditional Viet cuisine Strip believe them  I actually can't believe nice little pho shop Treasure Island  came over wild night because just wanted something familiar wasn't McDonald's   There isn't big selection pho just bare bones basic  soup tasty noodles perfect  full tummy same price any other pho shop  overpriced everything else Vegas  wasn't big drink menu just Viet Iced coffee Thai tea   The service fine nothing spectacular satisfied   It good place grab quick bite if you're area  If any reason want some good old reliable pho quench your hangover hunger come quick !! <EOR> Pho Vietnamese cafe attached coffee shop Treasure Island  hoped recommend place healthy alternative buffet purgatory Las Vegas but crab tomato soup triggered posttraumatic stress disorder  Remember tragic night college when vomited blood toilet? now  Pho serves huge portions but can't eat tomato flavored water looks bloody puke  Thai iced tea tasty  <EOR> Food Okay  chicken pho rice noodles  Thats probably all would order since everything does look great  Soup flavorful though   Service honest   horrible! waiters super slow  Theres always waiter whole place! Food took super long come messed order too   Location Next Coffee shop Treasure Island  Atmosphere Okay Carrows vibe again   Price Lunch under $10 believe dinner prices way up  <EOR> I give place three stars based bahn mi sandwich Viet iced coffee   The presentation coffee terrific bring small glass carafe tall glass ice  carafe inch sweetened condensed milk bottom top small metal contraption actually mini french press  Push down plunger excellent fresh brewed double strength Vietnamese coffee filters into carafe  Mix coffee condensed milk pour over ice yum! Very refreshing!  The sandwich excellent well crispy roll stuffed grilled marinated pork I think only offer pork julienned pickled veggies cilantro jalapenos mayo  sandwich huge it's appetizer menu but coffee made nice cool flavorful meal  don't stuff myself restaurants anyway unless eating pizza   I can't comment pho haven't tried yet  did try chicken curry once so so several pieces mystery chicken parts butts? generic sauce only onions potatoes  bad but good either   While large Viet family came everyone ordered same dish roasted 1 2 chicken tomato rice  Maybe know something pho!  I can't believe only Vietnamese restaurant strip don't think situation last  Meanwhile spot do   Open late it's VEGAS baby!    I'd definitely come back sandwich iced coffee  <EOR>
