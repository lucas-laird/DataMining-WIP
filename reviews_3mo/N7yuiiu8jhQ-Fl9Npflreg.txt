Lemongrass first Thai concept restaurant within Las Vegas casino hotel   interior decoration very beautiful   located within Aria's casino level near Blossom Chinese restaurant    I tried food during Aria Play Days essentially dry run selected employees guest honestly thinks once initial pre opening butterflies worked good restaurant     I tried Tom Yum Goong prawn soup lemongrass portion large enough 2 share came nice hot just way hot soup should served   flavor good but knock your socks off great   mushrooms prawns really fresh prawns overcooked most restaurants   The Chef's Signature Crab Fried Rice also very good   served piping hot rice greasy most restaurants   best fried rice ever tried but Ding Tai Fung's fried rice still tops fried rice category but Taipei just far travel fried rice fix    The only disappointment dessert Mango Sticky Rice Khao Niaow Ma Muang    mango surprisingly good considering ones received operation pretty bad quality time year but sticky rice undercooked lacking traditional coconut milk flavor  very easy recipe master very surprised made least good your typical Thai restaurants   Anyway took few pictures other dishes others ordered those look good   can't wait back try other menu offerings once open public  <EOR> overall OK best Thai restaurant ever  tasted much better  Also portions very very small  would recommend couples  expensive side   By way would definitely recommend reservations if reading this  concierge Aria said didn't take reservations   but did wait 45 mins  The service very good first all  family tried few bowls could share dishes but didn't give until asked million different waiters exaggerating course   wondering why waiters standing around chilling when asked bowls   ?!  Anyways ordered Tom Yum Goong Tom Yum Tay something that basically tasted same  Tom Yum Goong little bit sweeter though  choose spiciness level want    We also ordered soft shell crab fried rice satay chicken creamy red curry prawns I forget name Thai    Fried rice thought good just bit bland  family thought nothing special  Comes fried crab pieces side   Satay chicken chicken good but peanut sauce wasn't  bread good though   Curry thought probably best part meal  Delicious  Creamy  small came only  few maybe bit more prawns   The restaurant very high class Aria bit formal dress probably good necessary though Hope enjoy review helpful!! Also thank first reviewer helping family decide order  <EOR> Absolutely dreadful don't waste your time    Decided try Saturday Christmas  Wish hadn't bothered  restaurant serves Thai food although wouldn't know don't display menu outside! didn't reservation but just 9pm could see restaurant only half full  Asked table 2 when girl desk finally returned she said she could see she could do! She managed find table but really didn't seem know she doing    We ordered when should realised would problem  table next asked manager complain something should left then! However know only open just over week thought wouldn't bad  Little did know    We ordered satay salmon roll start then chicken green curry  wanted chicken satay but told no chicken satay could pork instead  Why could put chicken stick??? run pre prepared chicken satay? also ordered bottle wine    After around 15 minutes waiter brought glass wine  Oh dear but end world easy fix  He brings bottle back then proceeds seems least 5 minutes trying open it  never seen anyone spend long trying open bottle wine  almost asked corkscrew myself embarrassing watch fumble it  When he finally opened he then dropped cork wine cooler! He certainly wasn't used opening wine way he slouched around restaurant didn't seem know he doing impression he hadn't worked restaurant before    By point couple table next sitting around 10 minutes without menu if body language anything weren't having fun evening The woman next them sat arms folded staring towards kitchen too    Had glass wine nice then another  point wondering where earth food was  weren't drinking fast know some sort food should arrived before we'd 2 glasses wine each  then see table opposite arrived quite some time us being served food  check watch almost 1 hour arrived  call manager over ask going where food was  He returns say problem order being put into system ie wasn't!   I'd enough now say would leave we'd pay wine  He tells he'll take car wine leave    This first time left restaurant before even eating  understand only just opened bound some teething problems but half staff seemed completely useless lacked any experience  couple people rushing around looked worked restaurants before but majority them clueless  No spotted never any food almost hour manager stood practically next entire time!   One more small thing sat comfy seat but husband said chair he sitting incredibly uncomfortable he mentioned just arriving nothing wait   <EOR> all dishes kids size expensive  great selection dishes such small bowl talay soup 18 00 our bill wa 140 00 2 person ladies don t take your men if want save money <EOR> As first Thai Restaurant strip Lemon Grass didn't disappoint  live Los Angeles frequented thai restaurants Thai Town obviously same genre  But dishes ordered tasty quite satisfying  Again price 2 3 times much regular thai restaurants but still much cheaper Blossom chinese restaurant across hall  Recommended dish thai crab  omelette tom kha lobster soup  Pad Thai decent  Tips restaurant opens till 2 AM  Actually during high season till Jan 1st opened till 6 aM if need spicy thai food work hang over clubbing place waiting  <EOR> I yellow curry even though really hard mess dish thought pretty good    I would come back order particular dish but least expensive sharing item  thought place bit pricey but city center theme created upscale understandable    I also papaya salad came coconut rice  very good    Being local having many great thai food restaurant options would never head lemongrass just lunch  But if presentation ambiance important would way go   My friend lunch trying plan resolutions 2010  interrupted bit much waitresses very eager please  don't mine occasional excuse checking if food OK but literally interrupted more 5 times  would preferred recognize having conversation just refilled water took plates away rather interrupt me  <EOR> Horrible!
