Great sushi good service!  all eat ordered almost everything menu   Tip if all eat order half rolls try more things menu   The servers very attentive fast   come back more   <EOR> New listing?  New owner?  sure why new but end doesn't really matter   put trust you    wait sidetracked second      How's food???   matters me!!  Well might guessed seeing 5 star review better good book   surprisingly good actually!  I ordered 15 different kinds Nigiri   them disappointing!  All tasted fresh but some noteworthy ones touch Uni Very good Uni! Love consistency   not watery runny overly salty!  am SUPER particular when comes uni   it's difference between thoroughly enjoying slightly gagging first taste   Thankfully former   Hotate Fresh Scallops PERFECT! Super tender melt your mouth good! Buttery just hint citrus wasabi course   only thing found rival ANYWHERE YG S's LIVE counterpart!  considering FAIR compare best found LOL P  Amaebi sweet shrimp slight crunch buttery taste smooth finish   Great choice   did receive fried heads   you probably need specify if want them   The Hamachi Kama daily special   this most favorite part fish!  If see menu don't mind diggin good stuff gotta try collar if sleeping under rock!  If you've before gonna order without reading anyways LOL   And dessert both Chocolate Mousse Green Tea Creme Brulee daily special   If see menu would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse little thicker sister stores counterpart but still same great taste   creme brulee perfect   strong green tea taste love crispy crust!  Service very fast   pretty slow Tuesday night which worried quality encounter but am glad didn't affect visit   But because slow orders taken promptly food prepared served quickly always refills etc   Only NEGATIVE thing think of   I charged $3 sharing Little Foodie Dude   He just turned two yes he DOES appetite LOL but mark forever history first charge AYCE restaurant   mad though considering he ate entire order Edamame 4 pieces unagi ahi salmon skin handroll etc lol   He $3 worth P  I hope wasn't fluke but much preferred visit today last few times Henderson location well G'monster himself!  All need now Grilled Pork Belly never back again lol   Keep Sushi Mon   keep ball rollin forward never look back!  Pics <EOR> This review probably more Sushi Mon used less now  Since new management took over no longer Uni which actually don't but feel added some value AYCE Toro Sake Shooters unlimited sake Mon Thu  am sure if actually gone price but feels value isn't good used be    The fish still pretty solid crispy rice tuna roll probably best thing there  Also chefs don't seem heavy handed yuzu which main complaints past  thing didn't Ahi Poke bowl  used nice starter just fresh pieces now lot other things bowl which did appreciate  Still place probably worth AYCE price food good but used better think am comparing that <EOR> Teriyaki chicken disgusting  heard good things place  terribly disappointed  won't ever back  <EOR> So fresh! Great sushi chefs great personalities! Goyemon II but without crispy rice cakes now   they coming soon   My boyfriend said give star because he doesn't want crowded! Lol! Really great sushi AYCE too! <EOR> Considering location now member Mon Restaurant Group guess would easiest compare place Goyemon   Not many choices Goyemon  Appetizer items such kama gyoza yakitori even takoyaki  But won't find any udon ramen grilled pork spicy tuna rice crackers etc  blackboard daily special however   The quality fish similar Goyemon any other AYCE sushi restaurant Sushi Dai but definitely shark chum  service above average but sometimes chefs little distracted tv chatting each other   I guess describe Sushi Mon Goyemon lite little brother Goyemon  solid AYCE sushi addition west side valley anyone doesn't want drive all way Sushi Mon's older brother  <EOR> We decided come learning part mon chains love goyemon! smaller establishment used come bunch when owned previous owner  seated right away told would $3 bucks year old eat  irked little bit because 1  much year old really eat 2  feeding child food brought exact moment when asked    Overall sushi quality decent  other Yelpers said selection isn't large Goyemon but main thing sushi quality good actually did enjoy it  Halfway through meal realized sushi chefs chef knew before   Chef Tony awesome! If ever chance sit bar would want sushi    Service bit slow but sushi came fairly quick   just takes awhile attention order more when table  back some more sushi days! <EOR> I'm fan all eat Asian food because know quality isn't there   I'd much prefer quality over quantity when talking food   must say though sushi mon legit   all sushi fresh order   just tell waitress sushi chef want right there   variety different sashimi sushi rolls appetizers place well worth $26 95 dinner     There some sashimi's only order just per person because expensive but least try still     The people working really nice   wasn't busy but herd when gets busy food takes awhile come out   sure eat all your food along rice else you'll charged extra     I'll definitely come back place when come back Vegas! <EOR>
