I finally found little piece  heaven earth thanks recommendation Teri C !! !! Hot N Juicy definitely satisfied craving crawfish shrimp bag am used getting family's home state Louisiana  Upon entering restaurant received warm welcome sat down very quickly  two flat screen plasmas across way ESPN news Dodger game very happy that!! server guided small menu gave flavor profile each seasoning seafood fare  friend 2 lbs crawfish 2lbs shrimp half order sausage  When order came table opened plastic bags excitement!! moment both placed euphoric state smell!! Hot n Juicy special seasoning spicy extra spicy want slap somebody good recommend your seafood    a whole lot spice garlic which love!! put bibs town!! crawfish shrimp sausage fresh corn potato just flavorful seafood  service great    we someone table ever needed all times  would give place another half star having Heineken Light available which can't seem find many places except fridge!! very enjoyable experience Hot N Juicy!! back soon         probably tomorrow!! <EOR> Not bad all   crawfish meatier similar California   blue crab also good   shrimp pieces nice big   place good seasoning choose such lemon pepper house special cajun style other can't remember   give piece corn potato ordering 2lb bag crawfish   cajun fries good but similar tasting fries lot places   medium spiciness some kick it   actually five levels spiciness which ridiculous unless you're hardcore fan spicy food   service good but maybe because lunch non busy time   prices just dollar more California but still worth it  <EOR> I drove around around oblivious place    until realized sign  Unfortunately sign isn't eye catching hoped  ended coming Teri C 's Bday party  Reggie grabbed while wandered around aimlessly  Maybe just having off day little it?  You walk into quaint little restaurant  there's bunch tables some them dressed plastic covering   Oh yes  Grandaddy Crawfish Killa here   The menu isn't big all dungeness crawfish shrimp etc    with different levels spice  nosebleed Ok menu Yes spice definitely creeper  But wasn't nosebleed enough me  special crawfish etouffe which good but enough heat   When crawfish come    well normally Louisiana they're steamed water broth  crawfish here    are put bag    with butter    garlic spices etc   Yea  WTF Talk cholesterol issue  Good luck that! BUT FREAKING GOOD  ordered two lbs   It tedious having pick meat  crawfish time wasn't big used but still good  needed definitely liked sausage too! couldn't finish though    I wanted rice talked guys   definitely try incorporate rice bread menu   I did knock them portions rice only because felt being rationed off Survivor  can't wait back  But time I'd crawfish shelled <EOR> Game on! lady NOLA native  While beautiful refined she loves dirty south  loves crawfish  She turned them now am addicted too  Everytime down NOLA 5 pounds  Every time LSU alumni association would boil there  surprised visit HJCrawfish did disappoint    good NOLA? No f in way  But really close good enough    The service stellar  all family  all brother's business treat customers right  Right now getting crawfish Texas think may why aren't good could be  hopes then when back season crawfish once again coming Louisianna they'll even better    Get spicy Good luck  <EOR>
