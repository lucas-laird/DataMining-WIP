It decent think sticking basics where find satisfying late night nosh     The food alright  fruit crepe sausages bacon sunny side egg  Hard screw but also made love which those ma pa's better     obviously breakfast chains put love into but just consistent expected standard    The service alright  Refilled drinks seemed nice but held check hostages few minutes   Sometimes though crepe cheese blintze sounds good 2am just gotta hop IHOP  <EOR> No nothing changed hate place  Most food cold over priced don't home cooked love <EOR>
