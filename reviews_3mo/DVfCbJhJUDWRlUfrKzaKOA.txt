WTF man!? DOES that??  Apparently way know if HK style Chinese name   HK people call Zazang Lo Mien instead normal Zazang Mien   Bunch wierdos   Girlfriend included Cantonese apparently likes HK style  WTF woman?!   blasphemy since familial roots dad's side San Tung happen ORIGINATORS zazang noodles   never even knew very own Chinese brethren would bastardize beloved noodles much wouldn't even recognize them   Even Korean copycats actually copy recipe pretty well   Other dish noodles good   since gf liked HK interpretation San Tung's great noodle dish won't dock stars that   Four stars cuz food good   But I'd also check some other smaller restaurants plaza  <EOR>
