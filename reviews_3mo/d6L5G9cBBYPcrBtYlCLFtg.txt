I mood Mediterranean food last time Kabob Palace took long food decided check Lily's   Upon entering stood 5 10 mins  before anybody even noticed there   big table w 20 people guess waitress busy   After seated took painfully long time order even water   getting impatient wanted leave   actually walked down strip mall grab menu check  Amena Bakery FINALLY when back waitress giving drinks   I think realized getting impatient started bringing appetizers quick order   Once food came very good   couldn't asked better grape leaves hummus baba ganuche   falafel little dry but gave free order tabbouleh made little better   pretty stuffed appetizers but companions raving food   I would given Lily's four stars but wait really put sour taste mouth   just show never second chance first impression  <EOR>
