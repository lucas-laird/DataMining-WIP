This very quiet resturant some somewhat rude customer service but food fresh vibe more local some flashier places closer Strip even Downtown   I ordered  10 piece nugget meal Dr Pepper  able refills just asking which always plus  dining room mostly empty save group women small family  nice peaceful eating  fries actually really good didn't know recipe changed again   I'd come again if DD exhausted hungry drunkard looking chili baked potato! <EOR>
