Strings little Italian bistro  situated shopping center northwest corner Tropicana Eastern approximately forever   outer appearance reminds early 90s but food inside definitely tastes better Crystal Pepsi refreshing bottle Orbitz  Remember stuff?  Why mystery gobs goo suspended your drink marketing strategy? Strings good lunch spot Lunch Dash special used $3 50 but now hovers somewhere around $7 00   garlic bread homemade good reminds childhood which again puts somewhere close early 90s dammit!    pastas good   Just good   spectacular but definitely edible price pay   service always polite quick atmosphere comfortable   Having lunch wouldn't recommend 'night ' but casual dinner sure beats Olive Garden  <EOR>
