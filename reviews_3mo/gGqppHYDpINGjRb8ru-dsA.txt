Update August 2009  Ugh  all over  Luau Buffet no longer held poolside fire dancers other entertainment  Now Luau Buffet very sorry standard buffet heightened prices  free mai tai drinks provided but even those can't put back party atmosphere experienced poolside Luau two years ago  If anyone suggests you're better off finding something less expensive it $25 per Saturday putting sweet sauce chicken breasts does luau make  Sorry Imperial Palace know economy bad but once worst cuts seen over past year   Not best buffet ever but combination food show made wonderful evening  Luau Buffet Show only runs through summer months if you're thinking going sure plans early  Also spend extra $$ VIP package special give aways better table service better view  Don't plan loose free flowing mai tais pina coladas advertised endless  needed drink quite few before finally found some alcohol  But fun none less  Reminiscent envision typical Las Vegas dinner show bygone days  <EOR>
