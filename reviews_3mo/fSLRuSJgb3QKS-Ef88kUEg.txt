Hidden corner strip mall near Food 4 Less unassuming Ethiopian restaurant   red yellow green signage illuminates restaurant's name cuisine   Walking probably nicest Ethiopian restaurants town   modern furniture immediately sets tone along bar right small stage area back   On Saturday night only customers   weren't concerned though because previous experiences other Ethiopian restaurants always left minority   Queen Sheba's menu very limited only 15 items   course knew exactly wanted definitely it   #4  Kitfo Lean red chopped beef minced blended delicately seasoned hot spice  $8 99 made point saying wanted raw again eyebrows raised   when arrived slightly warmed tasted just divine   portion quite generous agreed probably best kitfo far!   #13  Vegetarian Combo A combination split lentil peas cabbage potatoes carrots fresh salad  $8 99 arrived green red lentils yellow beans steamed cabbage string beans   waitress asked if wanted cheese which definitely did also asked red chili powder   wasn't any 'fresh salad' but could care less because red green lentils good here   good spices mixed loving it  yellow beans really good too   string beans steamed cabbage okay same other restaurants   agreed legumes really well probably would just order plate red lentils its own even green lentils yellow beans   Service fine waitress took care whole time   She pleasant but some language barriers ordering water which eventually worked itself out   She came check brought more injera when she saw getting low   bathrooms could use bit cleanup men's room smelled urine women's room graffiti lacked toilet paper paper towels     Overall Queen Sheba fave Ethiopian restaurants five tried   limited menu may challenging newbies   But offer staples we'll probably return when crave raw beef!  Per website offer live reggae Friday nights  <EOR>
