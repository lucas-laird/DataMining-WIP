La Takiza best tacos all Las Vegas!  lived Las Vegas 4 years searched all over best tacos   happy when roommate stumbled into place when looking place same plaza but closed   ended being great find!  La Takiza isn't cheapest but certainly best   usually order daily special which two tacos choice beans rice around 6 bucks   favorite tacos Al Pastor but Chorizo also very good   Al Pastor perfectly seasoned served little bit pineapple salsa which really accents spiciness pork   tortillas always warm soft yet hard enough hold your taco   tried almost everything La Takiza very pleased everything but would suggest getting Super Taco al pastor!   If love tacos live Vegas alarmed La Takiza's random location there! <EOR> The tacos very good short wait time food warm   The place very clean good experience   If around hungry stop by   You won't disappointed  <EOR>
