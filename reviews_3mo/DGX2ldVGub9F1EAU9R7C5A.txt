Meal champions tell you!    This fav Subway mainly because ingredients always super fresh looking whenever there   assistant manager met I refer guys 'Ass  Man ' ha ha said he tries run pretty tight ship because other Subways he's don't  live company's high standards   efforts must paying off because he mentioned particular Subway consistently getting most sales SW part town past several months    saying lot because Subway almost every block go   See kids high quality always leads high profits!  Don't skimp your standards   Back sandwiches   ingredients see always fresh nothing ever looks old   tomatoes aren't soggy lettuce isn't wilted red onions aren't stinky slimy   Subway even serves spinach!  Rare find town most Subways don't veggie menu   never let down any sandwiches gotten leave pretty satisfied   bread fresh fluffy not flattened see some Subways meats don't look they've sitting all day     Personally love Subway $5 foot long menu   work lot happy knowing cheap healthy meal afterwards   fav sandwiches Oven Roasted Chicken Breast ALL veggies provolone extra lettuce tomatoes banana peppers light mayo spicy mustard salt pepper   Another favs Spicy Italian   also Meatball Marinara provolone tomatoes spinach bell peppers banana peppers   good toasted!
