Great food great fun  such great staff really customers feel wanted  If love fun while eat place  BBQ shrimp Parmesan chicken both excellent  Music little loud whistles very annoying  <EOR> Overpriced food wasn't good! wild place all going employees dressing going around giving free shots etc  but food bad pricey! <EOR> Horrible experience  Horrible  Ask seated outside IF misters  seated outside but NO Misters   Moved indoors proceeded wait 10 minutes even water  Never anyone! Overheard waitress arguing next table over order vs  received  could believe it! Seriously?? Unbelievably poor customer service  The same waitress told moment   She never helped us  We left  way waitress asked you're leaving?   YES! WON'T BACK! Strange location inside Flamingo Casino  Looks building just dropped middle casino  <EOR> Do BBQ ribs  Lousy best  Even corn cob sucked fries stale  bartenders nothing but kids goofing off juggling cups bottles  Didn't even Bohemia beer charged $35 shot 1842  Oh yeah $5 bag chips salsa  joke    <EOR> Margaritas suck but entertaining place  better vegas  <EOR> Went right work some drinks   ordered 3 beers some food   food took 20 minutes sandwich busy   couple rounds later wondering where server because he hadn't table 30 more minutes   He FINALLY came ad said shift ending   She since work service industry offered close ordered another round new server   never saw 1st server again   waited 20 minutes asked where beers were   He said right back them   what kind beers drinking again we few empty bottles same beer table already    Ordered same beer again waited another 30 minutes   Finally once beers closed out   $95 tab  which expected strip but service should comped   then bar which great experience   if want decent service bar      but needless say don't want back  <EOR> We ate twice during trip Vegas Memorial Day weekend  though food atmosphere people all great  All wait staff dance songs people tables join in  ton fun decent priced  def better restaurants flamingo would absolutely back again  tortilla soup passion fruit margarita delicious Just don't big mama $26 cup isn't large appears  But besides great! <EOR> A Mexican restaurant can't good beans should running door  If possible place would receive negative stars     The service far great   The food mediocre best   The salad wasn't fresh found limpy brown piece    They weren't busy all yet failed send someone table guacamole described menu  The BBQ chicken served cold when told chicken cold merely heated same piece  My food [chimichanga] also hot but instead telling them just stopped eating because wasn't good anyway Oh plates dirty   My hunni immensely disappointed We felt bit deceived because hostess showed table nice friendly but guess customer service doesn't reflect quality food  All all $60 Carlos Charlies = crappy meal   eating wonderful dinner Olives Bellagio which delish! Review coming soon <EOR> I would give place NO stars if could  lunch friend when craving mexican cantina food hoping would paradise cantina   around 11 45am still pretty empty seated quickly server came over took drink order  He asked if he could sit down few times which thought totally inappropriate seeing he interrupted conversation ask  initially craving taco salad some sort but only dressings offer Caesar Italian  hoping more south border salad chose chicken enchiladas doesn't love rice beans sauce!! friend ordered chicken sandwich fries  server told he didn't choices tried push toward other more pricy larger dinner entree style options  explained why chose chose food delivered within 5 min  usually negative quick service but 5 min seemed little microwaved pre cooked warmed me  Regardless thanked them quick service  dishes put down front friends chicken sandwich looked good  Hot crisp but thick french fries juicy chicken filet  chicken enchiladas however topped red sauce tasted pizza sauce thin marinara then melted over everything SWIS CHEESE  WTF?!?! friend taste everything just sure wasn't losing mind sure enough    italian red sauce swiss cheese covered enchiladas  WEIRD!! Needless say eat much enchiladas looking forward rice beans but even rice roni style spanish rice beans weren't fresh very good either  GROSS!!!  The busier quick clear plates but when quickness stopped  restaurant no busier when arrived but wait 45 minutes server bring check another 20 minutes run credit cards  He disappeared few times  think really sad when takes only 5 minutes ordering food receiving food then hour pay check?!

We left immediately  couldn't believe service place  Glad didn't spend any money because deserve it! <EOR> The food seriously gross way overpriced  am pretty shitty cook honest god could made better tacos  Plus all know day drinking somewhat questionable fare Del Taco taste ambrosia gods yet 10 beers deep food still tasted disgusting  Cold meat no salsa tacos wilted lettuce canned corn salad top off $60 check?? think sir  Spend your money manbuckets Coors Light flamingo pool $48 12 beers hayyyy   <EOR> The drinks tasty  quesadilla bit light meat supposed it  atmosphere party fun but incessant whistle blowing bartenders grating  <EOR> I absolute love place!!!! much fun!

Highly recommended children too  cater kids balloon animals along entertainment dancing conga line shuffle  truly blast! must when visiting Vegas l  prices food reasonable  expensive all!  Don't forget ask barber chair 21+ only!!! <EOR> The food absolutely horrible cold  only thing ate decent cup tortilla soup but even then more tortilla strips soup  ordered Charlie's chimichanga swear used frozen chimichanga flash fried it  luke warm inside grisly bits meat  Disgusting! couldn't even eat it  $15 would expect decent quality  live la same meal fresh no more $10  Hell own baked version tastes better crap  beans tasteless less spoonful plate  rice looked tasted came box  eaten some authentic Mexican restaunts none compare bastardization call Mexican food  here  They're regular margaritas horrible well  threw drinks away neither finished meal  Also Mexican restaurant charges chips salsa?   Stay away far far away  <EOR> 3 stars food good enough   1 star underhanded pricing schemes crappy overpriced margarita's   Beware everything extra charge cheese guacamole chips salsa   inform extra charges front but offer them if free    surprise comes when bill    I think trying another Senior Frogs loud music servers break into line dances occasionally   Avoid place lame  <EOR>
