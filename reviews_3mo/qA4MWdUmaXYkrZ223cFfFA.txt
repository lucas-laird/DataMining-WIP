What say place?   just right  very Southern hospitality without accent but good still fanatastic food  perfect New York Strip cooked perfectly medium rare bourbon pepper sauce side it does better   unbelieveable wine list a very nice 2002 Cosentino Poet guests enjoyed food good time all     Still favorite restaurants   Wish others chain compared  <EOR> Quite tasty especially pleasant given corporate tab D  With said though steak equal even slightly better petite filet slightly less expensive   blue cheese crust tasty but bit skimpy portion   mashed potatoes?  Tasty but inspired   The lobster bisque soup though?  absolutely heavenly!  best ever had   perhaps amusingly garlic cheese bread also quite delicious!  Our waiter friendly helpful    present enough useful but degree being pestery   So take?  if some extra cash spend haven't truly good red meat or soup! while    but if you're budget should probably elsewhere  <EOR>
