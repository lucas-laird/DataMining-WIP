The ramen noodles cooked perfectly   broth around egg ramen slightly sweet due flavor but all broths good   whole ramen good     The server extremely knowledgeable food anime different walls   He friendly helpful water glasses never empty     I recommend place people appreciate anime those looking try something different   Every time Vegas plan coming back restaurant  <EOR> Came 2nd time hubs meet friend   ordered bunch things STUFFED end meal   but yummy!   To start waiter brought roasted seaweed squares sesame oil dipping sauce lime infused sea salt while looking over menu   nice light  Personally liked getting some salt seaweed   otherwise little light    For appetizers ordered Grilled Ribs   which SUPER YUMMY   awesome flavoring though slightly dry time   pork sliders trio lightly toasted hawaiian bread which wasn't menu but hear secret menu might that?? Edamane served garlicy soy sauce reduction same infused sea salt seaweed  it VERY tasty  used putting sauce edamane but admit GOOD   I ordered waffle stuffed sweet chicken curry  came two eggs   i'd probably recommend breakfast item something very empty stomach  couldn't finish waffle cuz already getting really full  But curry inside good spicy  eggs cooked according your request over medium  end ditched half waffle ate curry eggs   The guys ordered ramen forgot ask he liked but looked good steak salad  very impressed presentation salad  looked delish    Dessert good  only small bite though if wasn't full wouldn't shared  strawberry custard brulee which now look isn't actually menu either  ha  lucky us! seriously would licked bowl clean if wasn't dying fullness    all all impressed food service waiter very good checking often refilling water glasses etc decor  bathroom signs best  very clever  <EOR> So place awesome set very modern almost futuristic decor rameni bar middle   They played music James Brown Aaliyah crazy mix ups!  flat screen showing some galactic anime wasn't familiar but entertaining  Server dressed classic white collared shirt black skinny tie  He told place family owned he also related owners  Anyways    I started off Thai ice tea prefect   Here's all stuff order! Scale 1 5 1= nasty 5= food porn Waffles sausage egg chz 4 5 Trinity sliders pork caramelized onions tomato garnished scallions nicely toasted bun 5 Seafood kimchi ramen 3 5 skimpy seafood but broth Yum Grilled pork Ribs 4  I see becoming new hip trendy spot eat  Server let know secret menu changes daily posted Facebook  Come find server also general manager Xalan  Extremely attentive accommodating professional mention nice  He also told since they're waiting liquor license process they'll bringing some exotic Asian beers pairings future menus come  Seems very promising place  Definitely coming back  <EOR> The decor fantastic  service average  But food just worth it  friend herbal chicken ramen could even finish bowl  cold noodle salad  LOVE cold noodle dishes but noodles over cooked soggy  high hopes place but food just outright gross  <EOR> Ever relationship where ended but wanted work badly gave another shot     yea     this place definitely made want come back because thought some serious potential but second visit made realize was 1  Over priced 2  Soup bland Luke warm 3  Portions small  o yea don't order pork belly if you're expecting anything close grilled deliciousness because its everything BUT that   Sorry 28go guess just wasn't meant be <EOR> I wandered into 28GO friend while looking quick dinner near campus   hard express first impression 28GO but 28GO definitely unique    The decor dark lighting dim  Combined eclectic mix music hip hop latin old anime theme songs 28GO gives off cool vibe   walls paintings giant robots various anime  ones noticed variable fighter Macross Mazinger Z   According waiter plan adding more paintings   t v  above bar plays classic giant robot anime live action shows back white an aesthetic choice since most shows featured aired color  The food good  Good enough come back second time good enough would recommend 28GO someone looking try something new around UNLV   ramen doesn't come any fancy topping but feature some interesting combinations meat broth  example Shoyu Rib came bbq rib meat which tasty deviation would normally expect    The prices pretty fair  $8 isn't least paid good bowl ramen but isn't most either    The service good  only person seems work Xalan he friendly prompt both times there   Overall am giving 28GO five five stars because enjoyed both meals there  still getting started but think menu offers some ambitious options lot potential  <EOR> Echoing everyone else said but yes 28GO interesting looking place cool decor its robotic theme  lighting very dim very hipster feel it  If take away all decor seems small sushi joint but suppose works Asian fusion place  Seems cool place hang friends classes grab bite   The server helpful refilled water checked dressed business attire which kinda cool    Yes prices slightly pricey ramen starting @ $8 bowl   Stuffed waffles priced around $6 $8 come 2 eggs  Most expensive item ribeye steak @ $22 then $15 cold noodles shrimp    I only ramen but see great potential it  start comes fancy kind diagonally cut egg shell bowl great presentation  enjoyed miso maizen soup rich nice flavor howeverrrrrrrrrr soup somewhat lukewarm  Noodles hot enough steam come but felt overcooked  comes whole egg cooked enough where yolk still very runny  Chashu pork slices nice decent slices tasted great  Personally prefer meatier slices Monta where its thin slices melts your mouth  FYI miso maizen sesame tonk looked almost same but definitely different soup   I am interested coming back future sample stuffed waffles trying other ramen besides really close campus  <EOR> A couple girl friends ventured over lunch break between classes   girls heard some friends place good    Well friends really low standards just don't know difference between good quality food junk   All ordered shoyu ribs ramen   say disappointing would understatement   soup luke warm best tasted almost sweet   Ramen supposed savory sweet ish soup major no no   noodles also sad   tasted instant stuff   Gross   Supposedly other menu items i e  gogi beef stuffed waffles supposed better but chance am willing take   Their decorations furnishings quite interesting   first thing noticed upon walking Transformer like chairs   some anime characters painted wall some anime show movie playing silently tv   place insanely dark blinded when walking outside leave     It without saying definitely going back   much rather eat Panda Express campus  <EOR> I really excited try place such high hopes but sadly   super impressed  atmosphere place wonderful small intimate just right amount mood lighting   The menu interesting japanese fusion place everything ramen waffles bulgogi interesting hence excitement unfortunately where really mattered lacking  We started braised pork belly slices excited consequently somewhat let down  flavor good great but good prefer pork belly little crisp meat tender barely pick up   sauce meat chucks everywhere   lol thought just but noted several others tried dish also same issue   I finished sesame tonk ramen where sadness really crept in  ramen savory hot tasty   was    bleh warm needed more flavor  seaweed while good overwhelmed dish which disappointing because primarily all could taste   This place left something definetly desired may return but while WONT ordering ramen !! <EOR> To start off reviews read think deserved higher ratings    place newly opened only eaten once  customer service way past greatness any restaurant EVER walked into  waiter very easy hold conversation with  ask anything he absolutely knowledgeable all products    The waiter also sure stop your table often sure everything you're liking  thought menu very reasonable  paid little more double ramen nothing compared theirs    As presentation only thing ramen week half ago cant remember name  bowl came really cool  Even weird shape didn't hard eat of  garnishes looked really awesome  also HIGHLY recommend getting fizz drinks  peaches cream fab  If would deff try dried seaweed strips  Really looking forward going back trying stuffed waffles    Hope guys enjoy much did!!! <EOR> Don't judge restaurant signage! food incredible! Trinity Sliders Braised Short Rib Carmalized Onion Tomato marinated lime    it incredible! Then Braised Short Ribs appetizer fell straight off bone   amazingly tendor very flavorful   entree Stuffed Waffle Melon Custard Strawberries   soooooo goood only $7!!!!!  Highly Recommended great service very knowledgable staff  <EOR> Robots ramen! any way place could possibly suck?  Well suppose need good food  good ramen specific  front can't help didn't try ramen  know  kind reason check them out   What could possibly distracted ramen quest? When saw sweet chicken curry stuffed waffle intrigued  Based dish alone fan  absolutely fan freakin delish tastic  really stuffed waffle but more waffle sandwich  comes two eggs side  Inspired Bentern even ate everything just some chopsticks  quite accomplishment   I suppose return day actually try ramen but now discovered there's another anime themed ramen place! When rains pours  tastes ramen broth  <EOR> It's very quiet joint at least two times gone main waiter always see haven't seen any other employees but he's super friendly attentive  definite plus service   On first visit Sesame Tonk ramen let's just say almost threw point   tried dealt awhile until couldn't take anymore gave friend  He agreed something off did eat something gooey initiated urge throw up  wouldn't flavor ever again  friends before he seemed fine though     On second visit Gogi bulgogi Beef waffle friend curry waffle  comes 2 waffles eggs the sauce pretty yummy friend swapped other each other  They're both pretty good but little more biased towards Gogi cause huge fan curry  Definitely better ramen had  scared try anymore ramen flavors though  want try other waffle flavors  Probably next time   waffles range $6 8  <EOR> This great  everything believe restaurant    Small business unique concept great food    They recently just opened general manager owner does everything  tried back story place  owner all food himself  background Thai don't know where background Japanese food come  general manager also waits tables  Obviously small staff but think those ones best  service get's A+  The concept VERY unique  based off anime  Now honest absolutely hate when people only correlate Japanese culture anime  drives nuts! But place really carries  well overdone  very techy into future kind feel  walls painted  owner himself anime cartoon Tatsugin 28Go which apparently first cartoons robots  unique concept environment A+  Now food  real picky Japanese food   say because only authentic Japanese food because  case  food selection very unique returning try everything else however sign says ramen  expect amazing ramen  tried Sesame Tonk  broth very thick sesame little bit over bearing  pork amazing very tender tasty  tried all other friends' food there's yummmmmy  try bite Melon Custard Waffles spare ribs  Both amazing  food great but advertised ramen decent    They special daily menu check posted Facebook  When secret dessert coffee soffle  couldn't resist AMAZING!!   I would DEFINITELY recommend ANYONE area plan making regular visit myself  <EOR> I came several co workers hoping fun lunch  While decor unique interesting felt black bit overdone  also seems designed own chairs really uncomfortable when sit back  some kind triangular design back kept digging into lower back  forced sit edge seat  Other interior decor service prompt friendly  But wasn't anyone else time   Each different ramen noodle soup order waffle korean beef edamame sliders   The edamame awesome  Super garlicky some good dipping sauce  ramen unfortunately didn't live expectations  sesame tonkatsu broth felt way thick wasn't hot all  Maybe room temperature  noodles bit warmer but much  couldn't finish ramen because thick wasn't appetizing because wasn't hot  other co workers agreed ramen wasn't hot either  waffles okay but something would order  didn't try sliders but said just alright   I hope best establishment but place would return to  <EOR> There saying taking time smell roses  true your food well  searching funky off putting scent but instead taking time enjoy   The herbal chicken ramen those dishes slowly savoring beneficial  presentation magnificent  covered food approaches table  Once placed down lid removed cloud fragrant aromas drifts up  fan medicinal soups characteristics similar Chinese version but milder  does strong flavors ginseng tree bark roots  Instead slightly sweet light thanks dried goji berries longans    With all arguments casual enjoyments aside should eaten cautious pace since broth served temperature over 100 degrees  noodles chewy cooked al dente texture  pieces chicken plentiful moist  hard boiled egg cooked medium cut half laying soup  center bright yellow runny  When dunked into broth cooks yolk little more thickens soup    Pairing healthy soup unsweetened golden ice tea made lunch does leave body feeling weighed down heavy  brewed beverage served Voss bottle comes three servings goblet  chilled goblet nonetheless  $11 reasonable meal upset stomach wallet  <EOR> 28GO    WOW! Seeing menu restaurant pictures online does no justice  looks good online but even better person!  I Vegas company convention strip  28GO just around corner  5min Venetian right across UNLV  When walked knew mind creativity should actually Vegas strip somewhere  Japanimation characters designs know you've just stepped into something uniquely original  Walls black but lighting perfect light place without your food being hidden shadows  Upbeat music played while watching Tetsujin 28 cartoon flat panel  Great touch!  We several dishes which more Tapas style servings  Menu clean easy read understand oppose much information   Items menu some creative names which just let see yourself  came mussels die for  server Xalan very knowledgable dishes recommended attack dish  please use spoon sauce mussels excellent  Every dish came he suggestion along letting know prepared expect  guarantee enjoy minor major difference Fusion foods flavor   28GO restaurant belongs center attention because creative express more offer public eye  Great job guys keep ideas going! <EOR> Robots ramen   In mind little else needed satisfying food experience but coming get   I vibe place   Subdued muted colors decent unobtrusive music   Oh yes whole robot thing   some great illustrations mechs robots adorn walls all while some Ultraman movie playing monitor   secretly love before ordered   But food no slouch either   ordered beef ramen served HUGE artsy bowl full savory noodles chunks meat pieces egg   every bite quite satisfying ate until quite full   The prices also respectable   pay service super nice even though larger crowd   My only confusion bathroom   flashbacks experiences Tao when walked bathroom greeted fancy symbols instead Men's  Women's    must new sort trend dining puzzles Solve riddle restaurant granted access temples fortune glory ability pee     I'm going blow roof off saying weird symbol pseudo stick man looks he may standing pee   expect government agents show door dispose bury body desert within days review revealing code   It's overall excellent place good food nice staff great idea overall design   definitely find excuse frequent place again whenever find myself neighborhood once more  <EOR>
