I really excited when Brooklyn Bagel Deli opened very very short commute work   stopped almost immediately opened waiting freshly toasted bagel creamy creamy cream cheese greet upon arrival office   opened bag unwrapped bagel took big bite and    frankly disappointed     The sheer amount cream cheese put thing ri di cu lous   No sumo wrestler competitive eater needs much cream cheese   texture bagel off   didn't slightly crispy then delightfully chewy sensation look forward good bagel   just pretty ho hum experience all around   Of course since three places way work where pick something quick other two rhyme Cartrucks HacFondles still drop once month if need carbohydrate pick me guess some redeeming qualities taste buds might just wake until 10 00 AM  <EOR>
