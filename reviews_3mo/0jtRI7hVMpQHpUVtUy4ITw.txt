The Omelet House used good but last two times visited quality food service took major nose dive   The waitress rushed through entire meal even though place practically empty  only rushed waitress didn't even pretend friendly   I didn't think restaurant could screw toast but wrong  Toast pretty nasty when burnt spread yellow lard not real butter   home fries eating grease blobs   Do yourself favor pass Omelet House  even good pinch  <EOR>
