Red Shrimp consistently good hole wall Chinese place   lunch specials pretty good ranging $4 75 $5 50   special your choice entree egg roll chicken fried rice   rice kind bland but two entrees tried mongolian beef orange chicken full flavor very yummy   Overall I'd recommend place if your want some authentic Chinese flavor good price Panda Express  <EOR> Sometimes just mood some cheap filling hole wall Chinese food   place certainly fits bill   reminds many fast food takeout places NYC would end getting delivery 4am   place exactly needed even though China Mama just 2 minutes street     The prices pretty darn cheap   $6 50 dinner special gets entree egg roll rice   wife split chicken broccoli shrimp fried rice   generally prefer fried rice brown but fine   can't complain   certainly back take advantage ridiculously low priced lunch specials  <EOR>
