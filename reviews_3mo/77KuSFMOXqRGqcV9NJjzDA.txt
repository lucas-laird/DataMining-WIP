Does good business sense which why glad chose stay  only imagine everything would like   Definitely won't 2nd chance first impression  bigger better things! <EOR> A friend all eat breakfast Dirty South past weekend  Everything prepared order tasted great  price under $10 breakfast  back bringing friends   This very casual place wait staff attentive friendly  <EOR> Food sucked unfortunately   hate say because love supporting small black owned businesses   loud singing nauseating   think just loud and unnecessary such small place   Also singer lovely voice hides behind wall can't even see which loud singing even more annoying some reason   Customer service over top   tried hard annoying   Every few minutes approached table   hard enjoy conversation as talked bad food without being interrupted   serving plates bowls cheap presentation food off   This few months ago close grand opening may improved   would give them another try because trial error important long willing listen reviews improve   potential because items mentioned review mostly great attempts gone wrong   point trying hard gotta give them second shot    right?  I edit review try them again     soon  <EOR> The fried chicken good first but couldn't find side didn't taste stale canned  really wanted place going try again however food left bad taste mouth  almost seemed food cooked old oil  positive side order still steaming hot when home  <EOR>
