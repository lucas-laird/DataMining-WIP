3 5 Stars  Finally pho place don't drive 15 20 min for    Verdict    it's definitely keeper    Ordered pho tai egg rolls noodles al dente exactly them  beef definitely fresh sliced them wherever bought because your normal typical beef other places  husband enjoyed egg rolls more but didn't notice huge difference except no lettuce wrap egg rolls with  sure if forgot if  type but any case decent  broth wasn't bad best but works  wasn't much broth but worked since its hot didn't gulp down broth anyways  There's only size think its 8 bucks bowl give take which same other places? Noodles lil less but full regardless    Not sure long giving away 20% discount but definitely decent pho joint  lady working pointed 20% off received service pretty quick  <EOR> I gave place two stars b c food wasn't bad    but customer service horrible! First don't greeted sit table then once sit down wait 10 mins drink   wait another 15 mins order idea   e ordered Veggie rolls but waitress order wrong   While waiting employees brought kids playing front being loud noisy   can't bring kids if work restaurant!!  going back place again   If really want try suggest food rather eating there  <EOR> Arrived eager excited taste food  Ordered fresh spring rolls without pork waitress verbally confirmed order No pork  dish arrived shortly order placed pork spring rolls  flagging down waitress having explain order she verbally confirmed herself she reluctant bring plate kitchen window  Looking through plate window which exposed kitchen revealed stack pre made spring rolls waiting plated ordered  fresh spring rolls made order left sitting fast food under heat lamp! Main dishes arrived overcooked bloated noodles non authentic broth  Beef boullion acceptable substitute Vietnamese noodle soup broth  Further observation revealed blatant health code violations such servers going into kitchen preparing handling food without washing hands employees using fingers instead tissue wipe nose right before handle food! Lastly asking waiter relay message kitchen he admitted language barrier between front house staff kitchen crew don't even speak same language! <EOR> BEWARE!! Horrible service!! Food mediocre!! Unprofessional rude liars SCAMMERS!! Walked take paid food asked them long take  said 15mins  rush decided gas which same shopping complex  Told lady owner back pick food  when came back 15 mins later sent husband food stayed car baby  He few mins comes saying never ordered  point heated now am running late work  lady again denies 25 mins earlier she doesn't remember  frickin' kidding me?? Now point irate fuming  noticed camera told lady run it  just 25 minutes later  She blabbering says ok we'll cook order!! No apologies instead she tells its long day    RETARDS!! know should've asked receipt but figured only gone 15 mins  Camera just probably display when mentioned she kinda backed off  wonder many other people scam!! need shut down!!

So review opinion whatever worth   Coming Caucasian loves Asian food particularly fond Vietnamese fare speaking behalf Filipino colleague loves some pho say place definitely list regular lunch places   Hats off Sammy Pho! <EOR> So visited place twice more initial visit opening week latest earlier today must say bad experience during first trip purely growing pains   I tried spring rolls again   No overpowering minty aftertaste   Everything just right   Still best but good enough   I ordered pho rare steak brisket meatballs tendon I think house special pho flavor broth lot more tasty first one   much more flavor sweetness really good Pho there   still prefer driving Chinatown savoring pho Pho87 Pho Saigon 8   But whenever craving quick fix since live less mile place good enough   The reason why didn't give review more stars because table smelled damp washcloth   let server know switched different table experienced same thing   chose mind anymore   horrible during wait   Good thing scent soup overpowered when ate all good end  <EOR> Because probably never come again review    Despite man sitting behind slurping Pho ENTIRE time massive fly roaming around table size bird rather unhappy server would say A OK! veggie Pho Soup beef broth but lacking flavor  Added some lime give lil kick but didn't quite meet some previous Pho experiences  <EOR> This place gets extra star because food wasn't exactly terrible  But never ever ever come back again  Even if steps away work which would've convenient but   Bleh   Service sucks  Idk else put it  no organization seating arrangements anything that  People started walking out! finally table but server distracted listening when ordering  waiting 20 minutes finally waters drink orders   Another 30 minutes later he gives 4 bowls Pho when ordered 1 Pho 2 Vermicelli Bowls  listen this    he ARGUING those bowls orders  grabbed menu physically pointed orders he kept saying Ok ok ok! He reached over friend grab Pho bowls he seriously way close comfort spill bowls her  She cussed he just oblivious careless he just walked away   20 minutes later finally food  Small portions tasty but best  Thank goodness Grand Opening 20% Discount  But besides NEVER AGAIN! <EOR> Broth highly uninspired   Meat tough cost pho higher city standard $2 per bowl   no kid size bowls   Bun minimal serving meat boiled then grilled marinated veggies sparse   Noodles used kinda spaghetti vervacelli noodles   Avoid prejudice  <EOR> My wife decided give Sammy Pho try  live southwest side always drive Chinatown Pho Kim Long excited try place close home  walked seated very quickly  place pretty empty when walked but little early dinner  some menus looked over  extensive some other places but  negative no qualms quality over quantity  both ordered pho chicken some egg rolls  really liked option add extra noodles meat  added extra noodles  food arrived pretty quickly  egg rolls pretty tasty  came 4 plate  3 Mrs  1  piggy  Would order them again? Definitely  gotta say really enjoyed pho  favorite place pho Pho Kim Long guess I'd compare Sammy's that  broth Sammy's pretty good  When comparing Pho Kim Long good but different way  slight edge Pho Kim Long broth  really liked though chicken actually chicken  Some other places use squishy chicken meat but Sammy's real shredded chicken  Really really enjoyed that    In regards negatives service others said Pho restaurants tend very customer service oriented  Having said pleasantly surprised level service received Sammy Pho  waiters very attentive checked often  owner Sammy came over introduced himself super friendly small conversation meal  wife drinking diet soda he asked if she needed refill  She said she ok but he brought drink anyway  does that?? very nice him  Overall really enjoyed meal definitely going back  Good food good price  craving some write this! <EOR>
