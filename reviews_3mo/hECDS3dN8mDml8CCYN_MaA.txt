I enjoying wonderful restaurant past 5 years   actually hesitated write review because don't want Vegas' best kept secrets but place really does deserve 5 stars   bit worried when Fitzgerald's became D but Don B's stayed same just good ever     restaurant conveniently located 2nd floor gaming area but very quiet comfortable inside   can't smell any smoke casino   Let best part food!  filet mignon hands down best steak ever Vegas   prime rib also excellent   days going branch try ribeye   Each entree includes generously sized potato fried baked garlic mashed rice bread basket   add salad side dish soup only $6   last 5 years price entrees only gone few dollars   Service always friendly efficient best all pretentious   won't rush finish your meal   tab won't break your bank unless other Vegas steakhouses where steak alone sets back $60    Don B's every bit good Strip's many steakhouses if better    hope enjoy much do  <EOR> The meal poor quality! Nice decor nice menu but food did taste fresh appeared prepared use microwave  Bread good  because article read Las Vegas magazine but article way off did food featured article  Talked long time water restaurant said never meal featured article  Would refer restaurant anyone! <EOR>
