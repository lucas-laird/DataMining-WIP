I'm giving place 3 stars 2 food being non smoking rare commodity area   Like many places area serve both Thai Chinese   guess there's enough demand pure Thai restaurants Thai places serve Chinese dishes well   They good selection lunch specials   food just average little greasy super flavorful though good amount it   If need respite smoke pop Thai Ice Tea   If want good Thai food I'd look elsewhere unless you're stuck area need find food pronto  <EOR>
