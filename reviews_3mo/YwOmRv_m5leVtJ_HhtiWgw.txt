For $4 99 large bowl Pho Tai but bowl soup noodles nothing special  sparse amount meat particularly tender nor broth flavorful   The service typically aloof Asian restaurant  funniest part each table plastic placard 4 5 small buttons base  Reading card says Pho Huong Saigon takes pride its service installed system maintain high level service   Ideally press button attention your waiter refill check  No more snapping your fingers waiter's attention    WTF? thing acknowledges people snap fingers waiters!  And if your dining establishment service oriented no should even *think* asking refill bill  waiter would bring check periodically see if needed anything   But    hell  figured play  I pushed button refill   I pushed again   Damn     think plasic thingie broken because see waiter other side restaurant slurping own bowl noodles   I wave hand general direction  even consider snapping But instead cash register asked refill asked bill  waiter overheard immediately said he'd bring us   Sigh   The hostess shining star  She petite Asian woman TON makeup gold lame leggings glitzy shirt  waiting say love long time  Frankly think she might management owner  bad employees aren't snazzy interesting  Too bad food wasn't very good   The other positive experience super cheap    restaurant seemed relatively clean  I'd only come again see hostess because she such character  <EOR>
