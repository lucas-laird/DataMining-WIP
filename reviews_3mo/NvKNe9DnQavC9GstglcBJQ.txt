Every casino Las Vegas 24 7 restaurant usually serves prime rib then mostly Denny's type fare  Venetian Grand Lux Cafe  Grand Lux Cafe finer version Cheesecake Factory same people    if just forget most means Venetian 24 hour Cheesecake Factory    WOW  <EOR> I ate because saw Larry Flint eating there  There's part restaurant juts outdoor area towards casino  he barely bothering keep mouth closed he chewed  though he glazed over look he ate think he enjoyed food because he finished everything including table bread  place designed more mid west palette everything just little bit much  salad dressing just little sweet salmon just little smoked etc  still taste great going down just lacking diversity  <EOR> Great sandwiches great salads great place lunch  don't 'midwest' references made another reviewer  Californian tend things 'too much'  think parent restaurant Cheesecake Factory does tend towards much  but Grand Lux just right  <EOR>
