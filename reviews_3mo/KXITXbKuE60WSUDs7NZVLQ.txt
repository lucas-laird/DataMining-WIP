WTF?!?!  tastes same regular South American beans   Never again  <EOR> Wasn't first choice Table 10 actually first Emeril restaurant   Have say  for all hype all Emeril's restaurants Vegas surprisingly disappointed   We last tables seated informed immediately kitchen closing ten minutes  both ordered tomato bisque soup  ordered kobe sirloin vegetarian friend ordered meat pasta just minus meat plus vegetables  must say server very courteous throughout meal  Bread service good well    The soups came within reasonable time  entrees took FOREVER  didn't even notice but table four sat down entrees BEFORE ours  server kindly pointed assuring someone would looking into order  Considering location restaurant disappointed speed which food came out  Apologies given but quality food didn't disappointment point   In Table 10's defense did just open maybe they're still figuring things out  sake hope figure things soon  <EOR> For starters tomato bisque very good  Table 10 salad more less just plain salad  bread kind quasi portuguese sweet roll really good when warm fresh    The entrees pretty good though nothing spectacular  all ordered different items including couple specials  seafood items ok lobster pot pie some whole pieces claw meat  rotisserie beef entrees good sides    The desserts nice but no bam found  Emeril's wines surprisingly good  rhone red blend decent chardonnay much better    The service itself hit miss  Everyone very friendly waitress very knowledgeable menu  wine starters all came without problem  Then moved entrees  brought under those room service lids placed tray next table  Where sat several minutes 4 servers rounded simultaneously place dishes  didn't even need 4 because 2 servers gave mains while other 2 gave sides only 2 side dishes  dish probably wasn't piping hot but extra wait basically made everything plate lukewarm    Being close opening guess they're still working some kinks  Having reservations OT somewhat more likely back see if they've worked things out  <EOR> I would expect more Emeril's restaurant expect lot more especially Las Vegas   When compare handful other fantastic choices restaurant Table 10 does stand all   Nice polite service however personable   interior ambiance nice but extraordinary   heard order any house salad started Tomato Bisque which wonderful   whole showing synchronizing serving dishes pouring soup pot your plate front appears bit sloppy   prefer having soup serve hot simple   Thank you    The lamb foie gras appetizer cost $22 only alright   Foie Gras burnt purpose which weird   Then surprised Mediterranean Sea Bass marinated tomato etc   very very fishy    $37   Obviously mediterranean sea bass very different Chilean sea bass     One person party requested Vegetarian dish even though wasn't menu graceful helpful special request   Given vast amount other great choices Las Vegas probably back   restaurant mediocre doesn't worth special trip visit  <EOR>
