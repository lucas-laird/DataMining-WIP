A slice pizza starts  $4 50 slice price expected costco size slice which wasn't   Oh well should expected    all restaurant located  Las Vegas strip              <EOR> stopped late morning some food because didn't feel getting earl sandwich panda planet hollywood area kinda feeling pizza   say say best pizza all jazz but place doesn't but kinda let down   all pizza thin crust which am huge fan but crust being thin still soggy under ingredients which turn off   toppings pretty good good amount them but lets face nobody soggy pizza   staff cool though owner came checked small conversation which nice touch  overall decent but don't see myself coming back anytime soon   round table numero uno much better choice opinion not sure those vegas area though <EOR> This hands down best pizza Las Vegas  Tasty healthy almost good true  <EOR> Hungry horse buddy despite wanting eat first place saw mall opted pizza visiting three other places lunch today  little 2pm reading sign read something along lines being best rated pizza spot took advertised word it   Ehhhhh    total bill came $11 84 lunch special  WTH??? wasn't any sort gourmet pizza   typical mall type pizza beat  did get? okay sized slice supreme pizza mediocre salad small sized drink  guess things cost more Vegas but damn  few beers while rolling dice earlier eating filled but honestly would rather paid $25 lunch elsewhere   The staff friendly restaurant really clean  Being hungry most things would taste great but experience ehhh better  <EOR>
