1900 Asian Cuisine newest Chinese restaurant open former Kung Fu Chef site offering traditional Chinese breakfast dim sum Szechuan Shanghainese Taiwanese cuisine   same plaza Bazic Old SF Market Shuseki   only opened since Tuesday June 4 2013 spanking new still don't traditional menus printed yet currently utilizing single sided print outs stapled together    But staff all sport matching black white shirts restaurant name printed it   At time dropped around 8 30pm Sunday restaurant still busy   reviewing menu asked recommendations finally decided Cumin Lamb kept myself busy game phone while doing some eavesdropping   Plus insightful observation duplicate check printout made verbal confirmation waitress learned new business actually another restaurant venture owner Three Village Restaurant which original location just floor up   also hired chef direct China could offer quality authentic Chinese food   The food came fairly quickly looked good   Tasted great too  only less position impression haphazard way steamed rice served small bowl rice all over upper edges small bowl they charge $0 50 each bowl rice    guess just don't want potentially waste rice someone only ordered entree   Of course entree enough ended getting Walnut Shrimp   portions good shrimp deep fried thick batter just long enough cooked without turning crustacean into rubbery exercise equipment your jaw   Overall dinner menu decent but compared offered during lunch 5pm looks plain   patrons nearby tables arrived all asked dim sum items but all told available during dinner    bad would ordered way more items if kitchen could accommodate such request   hope take cue customers least offer some dim sum items during dinner   For breakfast 7 11am offer small selection traditional Chinese breakfast items porridge soy milk etc     If stay really late feeling extra motivated morning might check out   During grand opening phase offer 15% discount customers local ID or if just look loco    if unsure check them little monetary carrot stick   If sure then order Cumin Lamb!

But probably still come back because food still good  Maybe owner read Yelp undo changes  <EOR> Stop #1 Chinatown Crawl       We stopped late night bite decided check out  pretty big party barely anyone inside  pretty weak part didn't allow put tables together  table  booth corner    sad but whatevs      The menu looked someone's typewritten homework kinda crumpled tons items choose no pictures but no expert Szechuan Shanghainese Taiwanese Cuisine Otherwise I'd order items use force Luke Skywalker which would ended complete disaster thank goodness fortunate dine Tony T Christina W  Team Snow Shavery help navigate choices  WHEW!
