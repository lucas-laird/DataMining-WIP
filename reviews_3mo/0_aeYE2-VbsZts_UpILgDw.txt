Coconut Mojito some more menu   Another great addition Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> The Skinny food tasty  Portion sizes price great 2 service pretty standard 3 value hard justify coming back when better tasting restaurants nearby way better price point  2 quick lunch weekday came away disappointed   Just FYI joint highly popular Summerlin crowd    I ordered chicken pesto salad which came little scoop sun dried tomato hummus two miniscule slices flathead  grilled chicken rubbery texture rather pale color some grill marks it  definitely tasty  Worse yet super odd pesto slathered in  hummus completely bland  honest prefer Sabra's yeah! listeria laced hummus brand over hummus tried here   marinated tomatoes unpleasantly sour mealy while portion greens rather small  Meh definitely better   The hubs ordered fish tacos which sucked  He only two tacos which featured dry bland mahi mahi  pico de gallo tasteless  served rice beans   hubs thought beans tasted straight can  He'd rather hit Rubio's    Service solid quick  tempted send stuff back but rush didn't want bother  Instead home could wash horrible aftertaste pesto mouth    It's hard justify coming back when food isn't even good  Portion sizes price also great but then again really want more bad thing? Avoid joint plague 2 starred review <EOR> The experience summed word     HORRIBLE!! service staff left feeling bother day  Very uncomfortable atmosphere    From start finish place disaster  server bizarre  When she finally came over table she never introduced herself never knew name  She took drink order then returned 15 mins later take food order saying know want?

Sesame seeds gluten  should pose no problem  if why salad even listed GF menu hard leaving sesame seeds off salad?  But point argue people making food just opted fruit instead  Imagine confusion when bring salmon covered sesame seeds  also covered some kind asian ginger sauce  Most asian sauces gluten  GF menu did mention any kind sauce description  waited until waiter came back over check asked if he sure gluten free item because sauce  He assured salmon gluten free    I ate but shouldn't have  Later night severely ill usual symptoms when getting glutened    Yes partially because should trusted instincts especially when refused bring salad sesame seeds because supposedly gluten but then bring salmon covered sesame seeds tell GF   think if going offer gluten free items though need better train staff  pretty sure supposed include ginger sauce salmon  a soy sauce most likely contains wheat    The third star because seriously enjoyed cucumber thyme lemonade  <EOR> First time bad experience starting when called call ahead seating placed hold forever  When showed restaurant management team worked very hard correct issue  What's best tell sincere making happy  back last night first time since incident great  pot roast which delicious sangria pretty tasty well  Management always visible throughout floor which admire quite bit  think place going continue thrive if continue road on! <EOR> Love place!  mac cheese best ever  chicken quesadilla delish  pulled pork sandwich yummy  Everything wonderful! great happy hour sangria only tasty but served large glass  decor adorable  vegetarian friendly options well  <EOR> Service fast friendly  place packed all times  bring your fur baby patio! decor cool log cabin  Reminds places you'd find Northern California  Huge menu selection  try sangria sampler! all delicious! hush puppies nachos Cajun fries appetizers yummy  pot roast good but mashed potatoes taste box potatoes don't poblano chicken bland no spice it  favorite entrée ginger salmon  dessert crumble dessert key lime cheesecake smores really good  favorite dessert warm butter cake  Now few times know exactly dog Sadie likes now  <EOR> Took fiancé two pups other night  service perfect  much  little  Just right  Always perfect portions entrees those looking over eat  JD Wisconsin waitress more 5 star any dog owner general human being should frequent 5 star service 5 star food  won't regret it  pups LOVE chicken <EOR> Been couple times  Place ok  nice bring dogs there  Patio area really nice fire pit middle all  Only 2 tv's outside game would kind hard watch depends where sitting  truly prefer Bj's across street  Service good atmosphere nice just hope food gets better  Maybe o ordered  would try again  <EOR> Came first time pretty cute idea people bring dogs dogs menu also kids thought nice  Shane server evening where big party thought he would another assistant normally but shocked fast he everything down   He extremely nice helpful when orders didn't come he made sure take care gave 2 house desserts   He great attitude helped all satisfied   ribs little dry but still good but corn salad comes amazing   Also tortilla soup very tasty also   Overall liked place very well designed good stock bar   <EOR> I've five times since they've opened still strong recommend  food sort flavor keeps wanting eat more despite full are  trait take lately people  Flavor everything  many restaurants emphasis entrees forget appetizers  here!  guys sure all tummies yummy    Drinks generous don't skimp spirits which important increase those margin society live in  microbrews super awesome especially dig IPA  If into IPA's then your way over cause good  people aren't fans IPA's tell much it  Fortunately already fan moved top tier    Now let's close service  Lazy Dog staff friendly accommodating  think 4 year college degree requirement just plain hire intelligent folks  no snob well maybe little but server understands world around them  see consistent    So why 4 stars 5?  new  need see consistent into next year   But pretty certain they'll me  right ingredients happen pun intended   just keep going know won't let down  <EOR> So come try Home Cooked food surprisingly didn't feel vomiting  ordered Chicken Tortilla soup  pleasantly surprised   actually really good  Good chunks chicken breast avocado firm yet supple bite broth good clear consistency filled bites Tomato cheddar cheese tortilla strips  ordered fish chips instead fries mashed potatoes because nothing says home cooking homemade mashed taters   creamy Apple vinegar coleslaw surprisingly delish!
