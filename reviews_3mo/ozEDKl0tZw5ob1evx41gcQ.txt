Not good other Big Dog's location but still excellent beer course   Yummy yummy IPA many others   reason don't location much seems always much more crowded filled smoke   Also room more cavernous less appealing   separate dining area which good if want away smoke   Menu items differ somewhat other location can't fish tacos but some other fat cholesterol laden goodies such Spicy Mac N' Cheese jalapenos    sure stop hoppy hour 3 6 PM when beers only $2  <EOR>
