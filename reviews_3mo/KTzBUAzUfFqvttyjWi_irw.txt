Yes sir mam don't knock till you've tried it!  sure cabeza burrito quesadilla but tacos since handmade tortillas see being pressed much better  thing would recommend them pack nicely which keeps them warm until eat them include red green salsa     Now don't expect tables chairs comfy while eat but expect keep wanting come back more tacos deliciosos! <EOR>
