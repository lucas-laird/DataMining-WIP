Why did even bother?  Sometimes work especially when work overtime am simply hungry nothing open because off work 12 30 AM  starving did feel cooking when home  happened remember Carl's Jr  also sells burritos under Green Burrito name thought would just try once   Well just happened night weren't actually selling any Mexican food  Bummer  already drive thru sitting stomach rumbling still  decided Carl's Jr  Six Dollar Burger combo bringing total whopping $8 68  don't know other people but paying anything over 6 bucks something someone handing through window never sits well me   And surprise burger didn't sit well either  home fries incredibly sub par  Just sad ass fries general  didn't bother eating very many them  But dogs enjoyed them  cheeseburger such joke! can't believe people fall restaurant burger crap  guess if you've never restaurant burger then     Anyway cheeseburger minute picked slip sliding everywhere  Why? Because massive amounts mayo mustard sliming works  undo burger pick everything scrape off majority sauces throw mealy tomato THEN actual burger  say Angus beef okay  Maybe tasted BIT better normal fast food burgers but really? NOPE     I'd rather McDonald's guys  least fries better  <EOR> The food just ok     This location fall short water  Look picture small water cup  SMH    nothing mad spending 20 30 bucks food then u ask water give small cup water  Again dont need brush teeth want water drink  Three Stars me  <EOR>
