I agree first poster might best pizza Vegas   ordered full pie but Joe's lots times quick lunch before heading off work night shift   bare bones staff very friendly tell good people   counter you'll find few different pizzas display slices   They'll pop oven minute you're good go   Inside few HD televisions wall least ESPN all times   If know anything economy know food prices shot through roof especially those sell pizza   Thus prices gone pizza slice over past year   5 bucks slice bottle water don't quote that but totally worth it   Looking forward next lunch there   only wasn't next Tropical Smoothie Cafe because being torn two trying decision  <EOR>
