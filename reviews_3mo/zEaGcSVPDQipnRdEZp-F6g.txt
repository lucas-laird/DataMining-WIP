Great atmosphere food service friendly   Finally everyday place chain! <EOR> This update first review back DeMarco's 6 times December am formulating some firmer opinions  Obviously since gone often it  some experimentation Really it  certainly best option LV NY style    First crust very good but Much better when order small rather large when eat in  particular bottom crust bit dense when obviously pizza short life span but also little hard when ordered large eat think because cooked longer  ordered small crust near perfect small great charring very airy  Good Bread  also olive oil crusts basted DM's puts Lot olive oil top spreads crust that    Second cheese mix never tangy prefer fresh mozz Neapolitan style  But bit much it  added two pictures where think see bit soupy large  also better small also asked light cheese last two times very good    The minimalist sauce very good toppings excellent mentioned liked pepperoni because thick enough stand under crisping  sausage pie also very good very spicy rough chunks  basil asked if could basil before cooked which prefer but told wasn't okay which understand ideological definitely call    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Good but great    Have anticipated opening while  definitely  transplant rather original tasted mass produced copy great pizza which still puts Way ahead pizza Las Vegas but disappoint New Yorkers    Very good sauce toppings sauce very simple tomatoes herbs rather cooked sauce tasted very fresh tangy rather sweet  pepperoni very good thick enough crispy give snap when biting into it    The crust tasty but texture perfect  fault Carry drive 15 minutes tasted more floury bit dense cooled off  intend try again restaurant   I also thought much cheese    Weird note boxes pain did stay folded into box end kept coming open almost lost whole cheese pie almost slid end don't know if boxes cheap just bad but pain  <EOR> Super good italian food  Food service atmosphere wonderful  super casual family pizza place  dinner little nicer thought would be  food good! ordered anti pasto platter yummy! pizza drinks service first rate!

Well months waiting hoping Dom DeMarco's would complete holy trinity pizzas Las Vegas Jesus Mary Joseph did!  We began eggplant pizzettes which absolutely fabu! sauces used made daily San Marzano tomatoes which use home love rich strong but sweet flavor offer  eggplant fresh flavorful breading coating seasoned Italian herbs combined sauce dollop whipped ricotta top shot appetizer into entrée territory  Seriously should layer 3 4 call meal!  We then moved 15th Street BLT new favorite salad  loaded bacon avocado tomatoes dripping beautiful gorgonzola dressing  perfect two people SHOULD stopped comfortably full    Now main event pizza  crust crispy yet chewy soft perfectly charred dipped San Marzano tomato infused grease dripped onto plate simply moan inducing  combination crust sauce cheeses best pizzas Vegas while    I am traditionalist must finish any Italian meal tiramisu  came little glass light fluffy perfectly sweet creamy  perfect end feast   I'd rank Dom DeMarco's between Settebello Due Forni  <EOR> The service very poor   waited 45 min table then sat aisle next bar wicker chairs outside   more seeing being seen food   pizza very greasy crust really hard  <EOR> Easily best pizza Las Vegas     Had Di Fara hope spelled right pizza   Big old square pizza cut into   squares   freaking delicious   think pizza sauce best had   crazy sensitive taste buds normally pizza sauce taste something weird going usually aftertaste   think sauce doesn't since made fresh   nice flavor slight kick without being overpowering   sauce well meatballs had   The Di Fara pizza great   Nice hand cut pepperoni crisp really well   Also cheese some herbs   Crust nice crispy outside but nice soft insides   Just great crust   Didn't thin New York style crust but can't imagine better thick crust   Don't know crust crisp without making hard annoying eat   Happy happy happy  <EOR> After all Obama hype thought we'd try DeMarco's   drove 20 minutes Northwest LV    OK knew would drive   ordered large pepperoni go   When arrived gave pizza all sorts veggies it   pepperoni sight   said  ordered   girl sort argued saying she didn't take order but New York pizza   said didn't care took order called wasn't pepperoni pizza   She away came back said would few minutes   OK mistakes happen   playing Dark Side Moon exact points me!  While waited several people pizzas go   girl front opened each box showed them pizzas   Each black burned beyond belief crust   Everyone said Great thanks! left pies   couldn't believe it   ready when brought mine out   guess since rushed mine didn't time burned   tasted just OK but way overpriced $20 single topping   Don't think back  <EOR> I've tried Dom Demarcos PIZZA twice now am ready give  opinion  First time ordered large square Pizza Sicilian Style sausage  Pizza excellent taste great sauce  Could touch more sauce lot more cheese thickness dough  also could little less olive oil dough kind greasy  ordered sausage half pie  sausage good authentic taste but hardly any pieces approximately 2 3 small turd style pieces per slice just teaser I also ordered 2 Cannoli  $6 00 Ea tasted if made  store bought flavored mix fresh ricotta cheese lemon sugar almost no chocolate chips dried fruit real New York version  If you're going charge $6 00 pop cannoli real ones!  My second try Dom Demarcos thought 'd try traditional Neapolitan round  ordered 18in  Meatballs pickup Calzone sliced Ham  The pizza looked smelled Great! thing missing! ordered MEATBALLS MUSHROOMS pizza! If used maybe 3 whole mushrooms entire pizza would lot standards! The pizza towards center rolled thin tortilla maybe because weren't any Italians working kitchen  The calzone good but again dough rolled thin tortilla finger touch center poked hole thrrough it  The bottom line if you're going charge premium prices PIZZA use premium ingredients premium quantities your product! I recommend owner should shop competitors METRO PIZZA Biaggios such see offer similar prices!  You New York taste down but put more stuff your pizza! BTW way born raised Astoria New York Grandparents Naples  also 10 year culinary background Saucier Sous Chef  I KNOW GOOD NEW YORK ITALIAN FOOD!  With little improvement place top pizza joints Vegas! <EOR> Compares favorably Grimaldi's   upscale restaurant features good atmosphere great pizza   started eggplant pizzettes   crispy but oily   Good app   large New York style Big Apple pizza   good crust but could used another minute oven crisp bottom just bit more   love truffles also ordered square White Truffle pizza   could used another handful mushrooms but overall loved flavor   Some may say crust oily but way   usually hate square pizzas but order every time come here     If looking bargain won't find here   prices low but quality high   Drinks expensive come during happy hour if going few     The reason star deduction service   service terrible   fact bad would normally given two star deduction but White Truffle pizza good earned star back     Get propane heaters outside working   cold since waiting area small should sure customers comfortable place wait   20 min waited cold felt hour   Check weather report if nothing else Home Depot same parking lot  <EOR> I gave place two visits before writing review   news Obama being town ordering curious try out   We big fans Northside Nathan's Metro Pizza felt going take lot impress us   On first visit couple coworkers trekked down during lunch Friday    Definitely little more uppity scene usually lunch it's really uppity but when Summerlin its just way everyone pretends be  We seated quickly typical waiter in a rush treatment   Sicilian Style lunch took bit table but arrived good   would place somewhere between Good Really Good but great    little saucy cheesy I'd but nonetheless left satisfied   So Saturday decided take family down lunch   older two boys being typical teenagers never turn down pizza could wrong?  Despite fairly slow crowd took forever seated   kept being told hostess despite fact see some tables could party six combining smaller side side tables having shift change needed wait see some reason   waited   and waited   didn't mind   But everyone getting grumpy hungry   Eventually seated table meant party four   When two pizzas arrived barely room table   decided also try thing crust cheese pizzas which MUCH better Sicilian style   Overall family unimpressed understandably so   day Sicilian seemed overloaded even more sauce even least picky child wanted none it   My first visit four star   second visit two star   meet middle three  <EOR> Great pizza! shared pepperoni garlic pizza flavor awesome! Good service but man place gets packed fast early before five if don't want wait  Looking forward trying other dishes which looked really good  <EOR> I Di Fara Pizza Dom Demarco Round Thin Square incredibly similar actual Di Fara Pizza Avenue J Brooklyn except ambiance which infinitely better  Cannoli desert which excellent!  service very good too   Pizza excellent would drive Vegas Los Angeles again! <EOR> Consider yourself warned pizza seriously greasy   Amazing but greasy   place took over old Atlanta Bread Company really dig did space   Very nice bar restaurant nice outdoor seating     Pizza comes two styles New York thin crust square cut thick crust baked cast iron pan   big fan thick crust thin crust white truffle pizza   Very tasty   $22 large but pizza huge!  still eating lunch three days later   greasy left puddles oil plates and still does    over few bites   Also put ton parmesan pizza   You'd crazy ask extra   Generous toppings cheese   variety sizes small large half full your dining needs   We also tried Mediterranean salad which also very good   Romaine lettuce feta kalamata olives garbanzo beans onions cucumber house vinaigrette which Greek dressing   Very fresh tasty   Good beer selection   Guinness Stone Mirror Pond   Deschutes but hopefully bring back     They cute little pizza shaped vibrating pagers if wait table  If want avoid crowds your best bet come during day weekend around 3pm so   Great service   Looking forward more visits  <EOR> Grilled veggie appetizer much soggy drenched oil far grilled get  No flavor all even pinch salt  Pizza great overloaded basil but good crust <EOR> Poor Customer Service!!  First time asked if sauce smooth was  small pizza great very tasty  Second time large pizza sauce chunky reviews show hate chunky pizza sauce! I know fussy but  way is Last Monday 2 20 again large pizza  asked server if could put smooth sauce pizza straining removing chunks  She checked kitchen told  way sauce meaning take leave it  wouldn't big thing take minute remove tomato chunks before baking pizza keep customer coming back  since didn't take care needs never back using Yelp vent displeasure place  owner Take care customers won't come back  NOTE 3 4 2012 Lori DeMarco's contacted offering guest happy   nice gesture but don't care now  don't want free pizza  We'll spend yearly $1500 $2000 pizza someplace else  <EOR> Had first time Friday  all hype   all say MEH!!
