I ordered Sumo Bowl which includes grilled steak chicken  Both meats high quality  serving portion huge could only eat half and fairly large myself   quick relatively healthy meal can't wrong  <EOR> I ordered chicken rice bowl   veggies limp obviously frozen   Chicken also pre grilled just dunked sauce before service probably reheated microwave   Rice okay but nothing spectacular    Also didn't keep siracha ask some gave some small container   won't returning  <EOR>
