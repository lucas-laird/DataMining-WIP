I am pleased report just good remember it   They also nice selection microbrew beers driving didn't try any but looked promising     The parking lot bit mess spaces angled backwards Paradise Rd circle around corner entrance Naples Drive or could pull into space backwards suppose    Also share lot Office Bar next door quite full  <EOR> Great place lunch  paid $2 50 slice cheese came hot fresh delicious  really layout place too! clean inviting   could enjoy lunch then relax bit  Oh green olives which very hard find most pizza places  Love place! <EOR> Went spur moment decision glad did  should say first thin hand tossed pizza crust kind guy  little thicker something would typically ordered but work mostly because quality ingredients tangy sauce cheese toppings  Few things The half sheet huge square cut monster that'll feed large family The wings awesome enough themselves bring back    I definitely come back try sandwiches especially East coast standard beef weck <EOR> Food good  Portions big  Service great  more ask for? definitely back!
