Just walking see Gangnam offer when friendly hostess popped outside talked into coming dinner  glad she did  Second day being open killing it! Really fresh decor SUPER friendly staff neat concept dinner  tried stir fried sukiyaki veggie udon noodles spicy garlic edamame mushroom medley BBQ rib eye Korean honeyeyed pancake ice cream   Everything incredibly tasty  sauce udon noodles delicious veggies fresh cooked perfection  edamame perfect appetizer  would definitely recommend give place try    really hope well can't wait back! <EOR> Not even open week restaurant problems kitchen efficiency service  almost all just showed started doing things without any prior conversation coordination   They haven't liquor license yet still won't allow patrons bring own wine!  Now  just dumb  Virtually every other restaurant town especially ones no liquor license allow corkage   I asked if they'll allow corkage once license answer we'll take under advisement     Well news guys take under advisement whether ever return  <EOR> They opened pretty recently only folks awhile  sauces ponzu sweet spicy yummy but even if you're fan meat perfectly marinated already we bulgogi   All waiters esses super cute helpful notice if leaving your meat grill long time adjust fire level accordingly  cheese wontons delicious honey pancake  Although don't expect textured western pancakes much sweeter stickier eggier  <EOR> We just LOVE Gangnam  Excellent food Amazing Atmosphere  Whole family enjoy dinner  AWESOME 0 <EOR> Great find! Place super clean decor modern atmosphere really good  ribeye kobe chicken  delicious  Bonus when waiter told chicken organic!  10 yr old loves grill table frequent gyo kaku grill home BUT place better food prices  <EOR> So came whim having resolved try all various places area   walked 6 30 PM Saturday place ghost town   other couple table   cheerful staff seated promptly equipped menus     The usual suspects beer list plus few oddballs which made nice variety also choice sakes other asian alcoholic beverages   For those unfamiliar asian BBQ style dining as was each table small gas grill set its center and exhaust hoods fire extinguisers set above them    Each place setting comes equipped pair tongs   order off menus small 4 oz batches raw meat then grill them table   quite Benihana 1 chef doing entertainment cooking front 2 mixed party   waitress did come time time flip meat cut scissors could eaten chopsticks   The service quite prompt pleasant   interior restaurant nicely finished although 2 person bench seats each side table heavy difficult manhandle them into comfortable position     The grilled dumplings tasty but oddly girlfriend's less expensive beef tasted markedly superior pricer order     One thing irksome televisions   showing women's college softball ESPN 8 something just annoying distracting cheapening feel otherwise refined restaurant   Why anyone installs TV's restaurants other sports bars beyond me     The food ok without being great   Nothing made say come again! Prices seemed fair $50 2 including tip ate pretty well    admit am terrible using chopsticks getting food into mouth without making mess challenge   didn't ask if forks knives spoons but thinking it   When left only patrons   wonder if Gangnam BBQ able dial food match good service beautiful interior   rooting them but don't know soon rushing back  <EOR> Checked place friend while vegas  He just returned trip korea loves Korean food  place good although missing sides generally come korean bbq surprised find sake more expensive soju  All all I'd try again  <EOR>
