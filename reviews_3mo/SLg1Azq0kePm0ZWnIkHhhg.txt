I haven't returned while mostly because place seems empty all time lot complaints seem service lacking quality food having gone downhill  shame because when tried place shortly opened pretty good  may try again sometime future but high list food things do     As side note Groupon? Don't link damned reviews quote without permission  Just because posted Yelp doesn't give free reign copy paste words elsewhere  <EOR> We Friday night around 6pm  no other patrons but decided give try based recommendation  service friendly   Ordered two dishes  Took awhile but tasted pretty good  <EOR> I lunch buffet returning place  Service really bad food mediocre <EOR>
