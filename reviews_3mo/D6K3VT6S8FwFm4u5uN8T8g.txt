Great food great atmosphere  simplistic entrees appetizers  Must try 30 hours Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly!!! Unexpected flavor combos taste amazing! If your big fan kimchi try Kimchi Pasta Smoked Mackerel Nice selection beers well  Well done!!! <EOR> I would say place very nice customer service top notch  best Tapas long time owner Ryan great  He very friendly  would suggest place any looking good tapas chill drink beer wine  returning soon here  <EOR> Located across Charleston campus Moko contemporary tapas restaurant few unique Korean inspired selections  thought concept intriguing but frank didn't know expect  Kimchee tacos maybe? cross culture tapas menu definitely trending days needless say excited try out  soon walk there's bar corner which nice because don't recall any bars area  If attend CSN happen around area need quick fixer seems good location  mean Fat Tire tap which awesome favorite Because soft opening chance chat chef used work restaurant Wynn  most tapas menu inspired feature 'socialize food' best suited wine beer  being said let's food!  For most part find would expect regular tapas restaurant chicken wings veggie choices really unusual  However few unique ones such Beef Tataki comes homemade Moko sauce which seriously addictive  Highly recommend! favorite probably best example Korean inspired dish Black Bean Noodles which called Jjajangmyun  pretty simple just egg noodles black bean sauce but best had  liked menu because selections  unique such Beef Tataki others  more filling Black Bean Noodles   As price thought fair considering quality dish  However if you're really hungry bill stack but  pretty much given any tapas restaurant! aiming create more experiential enjoyable atmosphere which totally just give glass wine! great place swing work drink someone slightly more intimate usual especially its proximity  All all very impressed overall presentation selections  excited see restaurant evolves continue work menu! <EOR> Not type eatery but food service absolutely amazing   Each dish shrimp rock three beef combo black noodles oozed flavor unique  Even chicken wings tasted interesting   no means meat specialist but ate best ever had   Wish place more stuff kids    Overall ++++ <EOR> Review little more towards 4 5 stars Items sampled 30 Hour Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly Black Bean Sauce Noodle Beef Tataki Chicken Pottage Spicy Chicken Thigh order   Moko newest take Modern Asian Fusion though case twist Korean food  haven't sampled much fusion Korean but first foray some excellent flavors execution each dish spot on   My personal favorite Pork Belly tender but fat pork belly powerful some variations  While portion quite small 13 dollar price point tastes top notch  Korean scale HKII I'd say 5 10  Bonus points little roasted veggies underlying mung bean crepe  could served any high end restaurant far concerned   The Black Bean Noodle another excellent tasting dish though more line its roots  I'd say HKII 8 10  slurping all sauce afterwards too  little heartier some meat only dishes   Next followed Beef Tataki which some very tender moist slices high quality meat  wasn't particularly memorable some reason but everything tasted great presentation good too  HKII 6 10   The Chicken Thigh probably where most picky Don't wrong excellent piece chicken thigh cooked moist tender sauce quite tasty  just lacked some substance maybe breading if served tiny bit starch veggies even  sauce puts HKII 4 10   I enjoyed Chicken Pottage quite bit heartiest most filling dish evening some very good flavor it  Even porridge looked impressive visually  don't remember last time Samgyetang can't really judge Korean Is    But guess would 6 10    I would definitely tell person going expect traditional Korean food but modern take fusion  looking forward trying some more flavors lot them nuanced complex compared your typical Korean dishes   While felt meal very satisfying taste buds did feel wanted more now given sharing two other people could certainly tried some more but decided save next trip  If thing could suggest menu I'd some more heartier options almost filler! Moko Tapas bar Tapas often means always option paella such having shared bowl modern bibimbap something might fun twist idea   Price adds but much more typical tapas place very high quality  felt effort put into each dish plating pictures Yelp dolled all  Big props chef hope quality remains! <EOR> First off upon walking decor warm modern   Although adding finishing touches   Bar area looks nice inviting    On food    Sampled quite few dishes Chicken pottage 10 hour pork belly 30 hour sous vide Berkshire pork Braised short rib Smoked mackerel pasta Huge prawn risotto  Cold cucumber soup  Black bean noodoohs jajangmyun Hamachi salmon sashimi  And creme brûlée top all off   All plates visually appealing tantalizing tastebuds   your typical Korean BBQ place  The cuisine feeble attempt another Asian fusion joint   Chef Hong executing twist Korean sophisticated palate playful combinations flavors   fine tuning menu venue breaking but see direction food going should bright tasty future!
