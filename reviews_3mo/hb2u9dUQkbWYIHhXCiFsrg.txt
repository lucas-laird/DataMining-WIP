I stopped Mama's pizza MGM probably same reason most people Vegas  You're walking through MGM hungry looking some cheaper options eat  if you're feeling burger taco whatever other cheap crap being sold  than Pizza it      decided Pizza wings see picture   wasn't fantastic wasn't cheap It's Vegas expensive it's Aureole    Bottom line reading Bill C's story   throwing Vegas would assume 99 9% due over consumption alcohol rather food poisoning   keep mind  Anyway bad place pizza but again   it's nothing I'd your way for  G <EOR>
