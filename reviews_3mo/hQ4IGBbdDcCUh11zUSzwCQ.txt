I visited establishment yesterday tried three meat 2 sides  brisket ribs pulled pork pork beans Mac cheese  enjoyed both ribs brisket but pulled pork dry tasteless  would pass item menu  BBQ bake beans awesome but Mac Cheese weren't par  didn't enough cheese pasta used chewy  Maybe pasta undercooked      Free refill drinks but if long line counter don't even bother trying refill    Big side note seating!! Space limited inside seats outside  originally gonna sit outside but then noticed above your head where people walking holes flooring above  If mind dirt other god awful things people's shoes SIT PATIO    Overall decent  <EOR> Where even start __ I mean wanna laugh just thinking writing review   The BF weren't hungry but decided just try since already Container Park    Once entered place girl counter told all meats except sausage links   which funny because  meat didn't wanna try lol  Regardless sausage links sandwich baked beans for mac cheese for   girl nice enough give extra side free!  We sandwich first once opened plate lunch cut sausage links bread   Literally!  No sandwich sight  I looked BF then menu like thought sandwich?????! Let known sausage links tasty   Then side baked beans mac cheese cups  CUPS! kinda cups prolly use complimentary waters   The baked beans hot cup started melt bottom completely disfigured  couldn't stop laughing it! Baked beans weren't anything rave about   nothing sweet caramelized  Tasted honest   The mac cheese penne pasta soupy sauce   Overall disappointing experience  Only saving grace only reason didn't give 1 star great service personalities those behind counter   ****** place just opened sure ALOT glitches figure out  Most def lot potential     Local small businesses Container Park all all  <EOR> Great staff service   really BBQ   combo platters let try 3 different items   also really love coleslaw!  can't wait back  <EOR> great environment friendly staff  reason give 3 stars because food mediocre portions small  ordered 2 meat combo $13 barely enough no drink included   Container park pretty cool though foot traffic probably overcome shortcomings menu food <EOR> I dub Big Ern's first place grubbed Container Park  Pricing little steep but considering tastiness food accept it  place extremely small perhaps fitting around 10 less people seating area   seats patio but 40 degrees outside when went   The girl rang kept looking she annoyed ordering  glad wearing sunglasses because could've terrible stare down competition    Besides service being weird rude  or whatever would categorize as  I lovely BBQ chicken sandwich  chicken little dry side but looooved bbq sauce came it  am usually hater bbq sauces because usually over power taste buds  But sauce actually complimented chicken well     The only critique sandwich bun cold would TOTALLY awesome if warm toasted  But hey do?  My dude two meat combo sausage brisket  He said he liked it  snuck piece brisket indeed tasty but little dry    Overall experience underwhelming  won't come back because think sauce use fantastic  However don't see myself frequenter  <EOR> Great BBQ! Staff awesome whenever would come downtown looked forward eating Big Ern's before container park now work downtown he's cool place too! Love it <EOR> Had plate Ribs Brisket Macaroni Cheese Coleslaw  Food ======== Brisket best item plate   Ribs didn't fall off rib little dry taste  sides picked should best indicators bbq joint both which incredibly disappointing  both bland lacked kick should saying Welcome big Ern's you've just branded life signature sides! Hoping they'll tweak them little bit   Service ======== Note first official day container park take part review grain salt wouldn't consider indicative typical visit  **Service no bearing star rating **  Ordering took while  could've spike customers first time cashiers using Square but took really long time individual place order somewhere around 2 minutes which significant considering fast process should place where take your order counter    Service line fast but forgot sides   Overall everyone working really nice think probably some kinks work but main things I'd look next time back more enjoyable memorable sides ribs your mouth water whenever hear someone mention Big Ern's  <EOR> First off place doesn't serve potatoes side    complete f#ck BBQ connoisseurs   kind BBQ joint doesn't choice french fries baked potato mashed potatoes even just plain potato chips?  Potato SALAD?  Yeah side diarrhea please   Disgusting   Okay well first all don't believe reviews   came because recommended Yelp!  Never again   place annoyance if you're familiar downtown Las Vegas right off Fremont Street aptly named Container Park   means you'll parking blocks away feeding meter then walking your destination rain shine   So finally convinced myself go   feeling suicidal which only leaves two options kill yourself something good eat   chose latter time   expected perk spirits just day before Lonely Christmas but read fellow Yelpers     After going way stalk place less bitter spirits chose three meat combo order all way right pulled pork beef brisket ribs  Just ribs  no idea for   Paid $15 oh did mention unemployed? combo addition $1 meter which include bill inconvenience    Food came quickly line wasn't bad   Here's round eats 1 Pulled pork best part plate   Stringy   Cold   But edible   Pour bunch extra BBQ sauce because DRY   2 Beef brisket Hard   Chewy   You're forced chew 5 minutes then eventually swallow when you're tired chewing   stuff TERRIBLE   recommended all   3 Ribs MEANT HUMAN CONSUMPTION   don't even know part pig was   tendons?  even remotely chewable   attempted eat half then asked to go box remainder brisket ribs   never done before   Usually finish all go    compliment regarding portions   The combo also came roll  I E  Half hamburger bun   Yes read right   Half f#cking hamburger bun   Merry f#cking Christmas   My dog eat well tonight  <EOR> When thinking damn should just Subway then there's problem  am really trying support some local eateries downtown but really hard when some food very good    Let start saying service good cashier funny friendly cook looked he happy place looked nice place stop into couple drinks bars Container Park  But  where ends   We ordered ribs hot links pulled pork sandwich macaroni cheese potato salad  Let sum quick because don't need read novel pulled pork sandwich actually pretty good bbq sauce   The hot link decent kick but little full gristle alright   The mac cheese greasy but dry flavored salt water weird   The potato salad wasn't bad but feeling probably going look same way out  The ribs epic fail  chewy gristly tough stubs ribs? animal did take from? even sure McDonald's would use rib meat McRib    I give places benefit doubt maybe some day give another shot   and probably couple shots  But hope pull together because good bbq spot Fremont would clutch  <EOR> They weren't friendly almost everything tried order some rule prevented getting quantity preferred  Every meat seemed styled different city Kansas City brisket Memphis pulled pork St louis ribs etc  place really didn't own identity  sides looked good but really lacked flavor  example potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste anything macaroni cheese tasted butter guess  biggest problem way presented meat  ordered three meat plate poured sauce everything NOT good sign basically scrunched all three meats into bowl  brisket thin chewy basically no smoked flavor  also cracks guess don't cut order really doing something wrong   ribs looked promising but again chewy no smoked flavor  pork slightly more flavor texture seemed right but sauce inappropriate pulled pork typically thin vinegar sauce side BBQ sauce top   Honestly didn't finish much hate waste food threw least half away  <EOR> I love place! food flavor able without being salty  sides homemade which them tasty store bought heated  meats smoked daily  It's interesting many people understand difference between wet dry bbq  Barbecue preference largely dictated whether saucy seasoned meat  Dry barbecue smoked while wet variety usually cooked fire pit   As say secret sauce  rub  Big Ern uses both which also homemade  Rubs typically worked into meat night before cooked salt penetrate cut tenderize it  But rubs more flavor soften meat also enhance its texture caramelizing forming crispy crust when cooked  Because rub's ability penetrate meat fatty cuts brisket respond well type seasoning  Memphis BBQ typically dry barbecue sauce side Kansas City North Carolina people barbecue wet even more sauce side    The service great lucky sit inside all visits because temperatures but am sure heaters would turned if needed   The price some may steep however any fast food restaurant size meal see you'll pay heart attack box  I only negative remark Lonely D reviewed 12 23 understand holidays may lonely some but unemployed 3 meat combo really necessary if couldn't really afford it?  Ok another remark Lonely D  Sorry  French fries really? just googled Southern BBQ side dishes most common sides available Big Ern's  Only 10 sites even listed oven fried fries side dish  guess next time want take suicidal trip try McDonald's hear form rib sandwich now meant human consumption    Big Ern's BBQ small meaning store location but HUGE success!! <EOR> Run mill BBQ joint Container Park  Staff friendly yet attention detail lacking  Prices high side  <EOR> I stumbled across Big Ern's when checking Container Park  always some good BBQ  service fast food 3 minutes! However food just OK  sides particular terrible  macaroni dried grease oil settling bottom  certainly wasn't fresh  shame because love macaroni melting stringy cheese  won't find there  Also potato salad another favorite sides definitely jar box  preservative vinegary kind taste  took bite didn't eat rest  brisket which usually when BBQ OK fairly juicy  just small portion though could probably more trim off fat  worst thing very pricey  $9 something two sides meat  No way worth mainly because lack quality  together Ern!! <EOR> They 1 star just because couldn't give anything less    First over menu  combos 1 2 3 meat choices two sides roll  Priced fairly alright but hoping more food price   The food less 5  gf shared 3 meat combo  Ordered double order chicken ribs Mac cheese since no fries!! pbr bud light paid $22   Was expecting whole pieces chicken instead eating shredded chicken  dry! BBQ sauce good least  poured chicken  ribs   well 3 pieces absolutely NO MEAT them chewy  licking bone some sort substance but no luck    The Mac cheese  sure even put ANY cheese but butter     boy did use butter  obviously sitting hot food trays all day long  Scooped into small paper bowl bottom whole lot butter!!!! Yuck  want see cheese oil   Roll dry but point whole meal dissapointing   At least some beer  Won't going back you're better off chain BBQ joint town better cuts meat  <EOR> All say disgusting  Spent evening trying different food joints wine bar  First off other food joints decent product  wine bar some pretty nice wines  So reason am writing review Big Erns disgusting  First off during travels through park saw cooks getting drunk wine bar then taco shop  When saw big erns never saw wash hands   just disgusting  say least didn't order any food just beware when eat there  <EOR> Possibly worst BBQ ever had  Don't waste your time  Food expensive bland dry  <EOR> Well CONTAINER park  every store smaller side things  see seating being problem during evenings colder months but anytime 60+ outside outdoor seating more adequate  imagine size also keeps menu items minimum    Walking you're hit signature smoked bbq scent which should sold candle scent bc want around all times  'Pork' Calvin Klein  'Burnt Ends' Yankee Candle  Sign up! menu isn't large but covers most bases  Pulled pork chicken brisket ribs n hot links number sides  Seeing pulling meat freshly smoked pork shoulder walked opted pulled pork sandwich side slaw Fat Tire  Total came $15  meal ended being great! pulled pork moist hint smokey goodness  accompanying bbq sawse good gets through any larger drier portions meat  wish spicy version though  two bottles sauce choose maybe but weren't labeled maybe isn't  knows?! slaw solid too  Large chunks cabbage more vinegar base mayo drowning which always appreciated    While going eat way around park before head back try more menu back 100%  Any bbq fan understands limits restaurant container park sure satisfied offerings Big Ern  <EOR> Trying part support local businesses Container Park which today saturday more resembled chuck e cheese more strollers ever seen Vegas  can't think reason back especially Big Erns   Just back place say? Just wow   it AWFUL     First off service   Good thing tip before your food people behind counter could put simple plate together under 15 minutes  hoped would worth painfully long wait but hopes quickly dashed   We two sandwiches three sides all which less meh    Chicken sandwich=cold dry undersauced cold bun= D Pulled Pork Sandwich=cold dry huge chunk fat= F Macncheese= Cold cheesy no flavor whatsoever= D Beans= Best menu only thing came close finishing=B Coleslaw=Fresh crisp but flavorless=C  All all never return seek better BBQ Mall Food Courts Airports  <EOR> Finally chance try Friday work  time 10 30 all meats except pulled pork hot links but both 2 meat combo  hot links great pulled pork tasty  only bummer sides baked beans pulled pork big chucks raw onion them maybe minority but hate raw onion mac n cheese no bueno    I say service excellent sauce very good  probably going post follow review once try other meats  <EOR> It's forever since excellent BBQ!! first experience Container Park ate Big Ern's   They very full menu offering all classic meat sides  brisket chicken ribs pulled pork hot links  husband decided split 2 meat 2 side combo chose brisket hot links meat mac cheese potato salad sides  Let tell wanted shove way totally share  good! brisket perfectly cooked tender  hot links just right amount kick them  spice flavorful overpowering They also perfect blend BBQ sauce spicy sweet  Loved it! sides ok but would try BBQ beans maybe coleslaw next time  potato salad looked more mashed potatoes lacked flavor mac cheese good just great  Don't wrong wasn't awful any means just fantastic    There limited seating front inside but if willing walk upstairs loads seating excellent people watching  would back Big Ern's purchase some meat pound bring home some messy messy ribs! If you're Container Park sure hit place! <EOR> This place Container Park far Freemont Street  little bit seating inside but sunny warm day sat outside   food South originally admit picky BBQ  brisket excellent smoky flavor little bit char tender able cut just fork  While meat excellent sides very much hit miss  didn't fried okra which bit disappointing  BBQ beans excellent strong garlic onion flavor unique enjoyable  mac cheese just okay while tasty VERY oily    Overall enjoyed meal would return but remember meat star sides just okay most part  <EOR> First visit Container Park surprised  didn't even feel downtown except when walking leaving but once inside really fantastic  BBQ tender dry  sauce pretty good  potato salad bit bland but all all nice BBQ lunch pretty cool setting  Think bring family down day try all again  <EOR> After walking container park awhile wife decided smell line Big Erns must because good we wrong! believe good reviews must people exposed GOOD BBQ  ordered three meat special wife ordered meat salad  three meat plate good size two sides Mac cheese Cole slaw   three meats three pork ribs pulled pork brisket good sampling offer  start meat cold brisket cut grain each piece very dry  use sauce accent bbq but needed just swallow  Needless say made all meat very tough  Only positive good smoke ring each meat  sides awful cole slaw lacked any flavor spice wife commented eating cabbage water  Mac cheese very grainy lacking any really cheesy goodness took picture explain comment  wife's salad fair low quality ingredients canned black olives bad lettuce some shaved carrots dry meat  Considering mid high cost very poor food experience  <EOR> I literally would even feed dog if one   How does place many positive reviews?
