I've couple times groups never really impressed   way interior set odd don't where bands set feel far close when they're playing   Service slow   There's just nothing fun authentic it   someone own 'Grow Your Own Pub!' kit planted few seeds sang some U2 sprinkled Guinness lo behold! grew generic Irish pub!  Additional star despite all being fun place Great Guinness toast although sure could more fun another venue  <EOR>
