Great  fun there   I don't think need any more marketing then already but   I'll throw 2 cents   The food's basically hodge podge tropical influenced cuisine   little  confusing see Hawaiian names foods next Caribbean names foods but Chris Rock would say all right cause all white!  quality food so so nothing write home ma   Location prime   I think TI better hotels destinations strip huge parking garage convenient location near highway ramp close gigantic mall nice theme good club Tangerine    but digress   So Kahunaville try damnedest entertain crap while eat   less intrusive way which appreciated   ordered couple sample appetizer plates which came fake volcano deco pieces   Every 45 minutes would dim lights water show call Baby Bellagio   There's girls walking around coconut bras asking people if want lei'd $20   which cheapest lay Strip   course professional bartender show which gets everyone Spring Break woo hoo frame mind   Remember visiting Cancun spring break partying hard bars Mexican dudes whistling pouring drinks into half naked girls' mouths?  Well take away Mexican dudes add little more clothes girls   that's <EOR> meh  the food okay grilled Mahi Mahi   didn't sit party bar section may more entertained if but didn't find anything excited over Kahunaville   More 2 5 stars  <EOR> This place should getting more 5 stars! friend sat bar area just time flair bartending show complete dj introducing 3 bartenders let's ready ruuuuuumble! hyped way    added bonus if you're bar end magnificent show bartender picks several ppl side 3 sides he thinks loudest funnest whatever several shooters he just poured *for free*   Then if isn't cool enough he'll also pour Malibu esque fruity liquor down your throat while he's still standing bartop if he really likes you!
