I absolutely love place! Smoothies always really good but really impresses customer service  would highly recommend snack bar anyone  looking world smoothie! <EOR> Snack Bar newly opened Mexican Cuban Salvadorian food place  Its menu consists primarily foods grab lunch  GO! RECOMMEND! found place accident but hidden gem!  Located across UNLV next Roberto's behind 7 Eleven great new option students campus nearby residents place eat  senior UNLV becoming tired bored same food options am glad see new place offers some variety  Chipotle Cafe Rio plazas next plaza but definitely place recommend people check if want some Hispanic influenced foods  different things menu    When no customers but soon ordered saw 3 4 people walk in  guy does everything himself he food fresh! Yes  *FRESH*! even includes fresh waters smoothie    The only thing keep mind because only person working may wait line if one  However owner extremely nice tell he genuine hard working guy! He personally told boyfriend he no time advertise because he spends entire day working store  He hands free food homeless people nearby pass flyers  <EOR>
