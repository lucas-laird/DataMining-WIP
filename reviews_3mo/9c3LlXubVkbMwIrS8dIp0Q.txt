could sense excitement pleasure bringing Australian concept specifically Downtown Summerlin where halfway between fast food places south side mall high end places north   My favorite meal lamb slab   Good tasting meat some good flavor marinade   Since didn't ordering sure if burgers gotten different temperatures   burger done well   would blood running down chin   burger OK but didn't special

friendly shakes hit miss  mostly miss   birthday cake sprinkles clogged straw sipping almost impossible   maple bacon doughnut just lacking flavor but banana split really good shake   As service number servers always circling but when asked more napkins did them   trip inside sink wash necessary     We did ask some ice water brought glasses ice water   did see some others paper cups sure if treated differently   There some kinks need worked out   whole ordering process seemed overly long   did seem turning over tables rapidly   We'll see future brings  <EOR> I really looking forward restaurant when found Australian restraint served lamb  Unfortunately just seemed fall short  ordered lamb ribs naked lamb burger because LOVE lamb  ribs came first lacked any discernible flavor  under seasoned swam oil  burger came send back  lettuce brown wilted  When burger came back few bites really disappointed  burger under seasoned too  burger supposed Mediterranean lamb burger but

food service design just prior 5 00pm friend approached Downtown Summerlin's Ribs Burgers line perhaps twenty snaking front door first impression echoed several previous visitors pure chaos several potential patrons taking pass while actively seek liaison three person process took through two persons seemingly no clue going on   Described more once quick casual concept focus quality food without 'fine dining' feel Ribs Burgers acts if setup something unfamiliar despite locations such MTO Café offering exact same thing but shortening distance entrance counter while servers still in training struggle rather limited menu result peculiar delays prolonged lingering diner eventually receiving numbered bucket left find themselves seat while food prepared   Spending most early visit speaking Mona pleasant brand spokeswoman clearly excited prospect brining high quality concept Shores perhaps ten minute wait between ordering receiving food having heard much braising process special sauce sourcing meat produce high expectations first bites 'pork bullets' enjoyed each bite exactly 'falling off bone' tender but decidedly well prepared nuances sweetness rounded several sorts spice   Having received no water order only two napkins meal obviously quite likely messy request first delivered while second never appeared allowing fact order continued arrive readied kitchen only mistaken item appearing unannounced onward burger 'chips' onion straws dining commenced fries completely forgettable really no better those Golden Arches while piled high burger crispy onions indeed quite good former featuring great grind beneath good sear while latter surprisingly dainty entirely greaseless plenty natural flavor found   Moving onward most intriguing item novelty lamb ribs lost someone loves lamb finds far underrepresented menus States suffice say meat's natural flavor overwhelmed least braise baste although provided knife barely capable sawing through connective tissue adjoining rack little elbow grease proved well worth effort each saporous bite offering reason return even when taking into account somewhat sizable tab something served 'quick casual' space   Rounding evening trio shakes point 'must' any place serving burgers 702 told man front team recently stopped using gelato Messina wanted something more 'thick rich ' but whether effect temperature prep time decision eschew alcohol only Pecan Banana Split proved truly memorable texture taste birthday cake thin milky sprinkles clogging straw while Maple Bacon Donut tasted mostly creamy Log Cabin syrup without bit pork smoke found   Still finding footing terms service structure while already serving some rather excellent 'American Classics ' no matter where concept hails interesting see Ribs Burgers does other similar speed locations more local recognition open nearby lower price point   Certainly offering something little different high quality ingredients readily apparent require few tweaks Ribs Burgers really 'work ' but if things dialed no doubt concept could succeed several large markets nationwide  <EOR> There tv   person takes orders needs training    ribs superb burger great well   Slaw dressing wasnt good   Great atmosphere    Manager chefs helpful friendly    back  <EOR> bad menu bad place  bottled drinks ribs fatty expensive its scary u ask glass ice then u need your own water

Please train your servers managers customer service!!  FOOD Lamb Ribs $18 meh  BF if better Costco ribs  only able eat meat should say FAT top because everything else just tough flavorless  LITERALLY FLAVORLESS EVEN CHARCOAL LAMB FLAVOR  buried under BBQ sauce some flavor  give opinion side salad fries chose salad  Salad overdressed oil actually just SWIMMING oil  Yeah just oil     Naked Mediterranean Burger $14 should cheaper no bun  should also just name regular hamburger because could probably your fave fast food chain better burger  overlooked burnt no flavor maybe flavor but burnt away   came WILTED OLD lettuce see pic send back  manager short guy causal attire took said nothing threw back onto table  NO APOLOGY!!!

The reviews Ribs Burgers kind  Most them seem growing pain issues food service menu placement timing  experience none issues  Move over Dundee could next Cinderella story down under    I came lunch some work friends based reviews very intrigued see everything would pan out  ordered off wall hanging menu opposite counter which seems issue some people but now offer paper menus which grab read while wait inline    I ordered sliders boozy milkshake  sliders meal comes two sliders all beef patty mini chicken breast  Which normal chicken breast but cut half  meal comes fries served cutting board  board does leave little room maneuver recommend asking another plate dipping sauces whatever might need    The burger delicious cooked perfect  Very juicy just touch pink middle  sauce top simply called Pink Sauce spicy aioli  insanely good addition burger added just little kick  bottles stuff service area recommend dipping your fries stuff well  Nummers!  The Chicken slider super tender super juicy  veggies piled top crisp added great texture sweetness slider  good but preferred burger chicken    The boozy milkshake Maple Bacon masterpiece  sweet fan but thing delicious  Great mix sweet salty just hint vodka which preferred overly alcoholic sweet drink  would recommend trying least once while you're here  offer flavors boozy milkshakes incase you're maple fan    Overall great experience service food vibe restaurant  didn't use sink middle restaurant preferred bathroom public cleaning  would most likely come back if lived side town    Hopefully Ribs Burgers find glass slipper serve hungry masses Las Vegas  <EOR> The chicken sliders amazing bad people give new restaurant break when first open give them shot again give them 4 5 stars deserve it!!! food awesome!
