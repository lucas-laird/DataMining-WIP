Ordered #1 right before close mustard chili cheese onions  Dog quick service friendly but product sub par small dog looked boiled old all visually appealing   Taste did seem include any mustard per order board but chili actually really good  Onions weird almost shredded death instead chopped  Bun fell apart halfway through eating  This isn't best food court come across but better options instead joint  <EOR> I love hot dogs place satisfied craving! Customer service great owner came super nice  Chili made daily fresh buns all beef hot dog alllll important snap! can't wrong = Capone chili cheese fries deLish but maybe next time try something different owner great recommendations   Good prices well! Yup back <EOR> First off let say owner super super nice  She passionate she does comes across food! Coney Island Meadows Mall but owner informed recently moved  Wishing them success because food definitely enough keep going back! Oh chili awesome! <EOR> Hands down best hot dog Las Vegas! love Sabretts   it's look forward eating when New York  actually think even better those dirty water dogs NYC! lady working super friendly really cares customers  first visit but definitely back! Just wish bit closer home but worth drive! <EOR>
