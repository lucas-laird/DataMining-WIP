Since opening Burger King 5 times  I back couple months    should give them time figure everything out   We encountered issues orders prices wait times despite visiting various times day  staff appears new just Burger King but speaking people paying products   On most recent stop around 7am weekday only other car drive through  ordered breakfast combo large coffee  items did come screen  instructed pull around window  When price more $1 over should been  asked way where bad     The attendant told just  costs  wanna look receipt? said yes am going look receipt  given  bag food then he handed small receipt without saying word  saw decided any more issue    BUT then he gave cup coffee filled followed handful cream sugar packets    bag bag food just dumped them hand closed window again     So problem order??  He rang each item individually resulting higher price  AND did include potatoes bag    I stop breakfast coffee only once ever few weeks treat  $5 every day adds family avoids wasteful daily stops  This first treat 3 weeks terrible  waste time money cost more off both should have  <EOR> I return burger king Ever! Being new would think would higher standard  forgot fries meal order  When fries did come tasted cooked day before luke warm  stale card board texture! two sandwiches ordered much better tasted if cam am pm connivence store! Very disappointed location  wont back! <EOR> on Thursday 15th August approximately 8 30 pm placed order dozen burgers pee wee football team short order   I guess counting burgers isn't part customer service now days maybe little basic math course should included hiring process? <EOR>
