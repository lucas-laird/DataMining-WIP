Liquid Aria's answer Wet Republic Bare Moorea Beach Club Encore Beach Club just every other day time pool party strip offer  managed Light Group which also manages Bare  mind its being nightclub day time DJ's spinning music alcohol being overpriced girls skimpy attire    What does going it? Aria which nice property  facilities top notch but still think Encore Beach Club better bet your daytime partying needs  <EOR> Was Friday here's 4 reasons 4 stars Awesome music!  loud but certainly helps into day party mood! Excellent service    I pick chair staff super friendly never waited long drinks  Great crowd   this may vary day day but plus Liquid doesn't pack people in    there room breathe mingle  Everything new cool trendy   place beats other admission only pools   if no other reason brand spanking new   The downside?  freaking act Congress place even without line  Come early   Come early patient  <EOR> Came Saturday afternoon pleasantly surprised Liquid  Walking tad afraid going walk into something see TAO beach  Thank God nothing sort    They never over packed place always room walk around your own space  felt somewhat relaxed day really nice pool alas still few crazy people doing all wrong things very public place  Seriously know we're staring them bc they're hot but instead hot mess? Children Vegas doesn't mean still don't last name your mom dad would very much appreciate putting shame    Grandma set aside Liquid place some good music a DJ spins good food!! lying when say mahi mahi tacos tastiest had  promise if try them won't disappoint  Only issue eat bar I'd rather eat where sitting take time  throw taco's bc didn't space tum    All all decor pretty place new fresh if you're feeling mood drinks music pool I'd recommend it  <EOR> Why 4 stars say?
