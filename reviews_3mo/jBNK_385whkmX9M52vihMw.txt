Went late some food  Guys drive thru seemed uninterested ordering  Forgot sauces asked kind rude when trying order  Maybe just don't all when slow  <EOR>     don't listen your order   wrong   few huh's     The girl taking order kept saying huh  want combo  No Just sandwich  orders combo meal  window  charged two combos  gave two fries but only drink  Come if your going charge extra give everything paid for     waited till poked head little window  let them know didn't want two combos  Young girl maybe 17 looked man seemed manager   He said well pointed receipt  just asked portion $$ money back  She didn't seem much idea she doing he said Mija put hand ill this  he did give money back    So head way California  begin eat burgers   Dry fries soggy  very disappointed   dont usually eat much fast food  but    together  know its new location but its your creating plate    will probably give second shot see if maybe just having off night  <EOR>
