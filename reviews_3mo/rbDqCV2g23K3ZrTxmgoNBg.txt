I've wanting check new upgrades Tropicana figured I'd try newest restaurants made reservations way Vegas  Upon arrival greeted manager suggested tasting menu which includes both food wine less $40  Sold! Although patio entrance Biscayne very white bright walkway ambiance inside restaurant elegant  service received all night server assistant excellent   All wine tastings paired very nicely courses  crab cake appetizer probably best ever had   delicious! wedge salad bit disappointment lettuce did taste fresh use to  buttermilk dressing bacon served salad decent but little underwhelming  grouper mango salsa cooked well tasty  did some issues filet which asked medium well but came very well done tough  server's assistant apologized brought another filet which came medium medium rare  little undercooked but taste decent very moist  However really fan sauce which came filet feel took away flavor steak  dessert blood orange sorbet which enjoyable   initial dessert chef made complimentary creme brulee which absolutely delicious enabled leave happy palates! Overall food Biscayne 3 stars but excellent service received knowledge new establishment potential   I'll give 4 stars  Till next time    <EOR> Five stars?
