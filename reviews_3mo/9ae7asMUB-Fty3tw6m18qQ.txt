I Rio casino playing poker recently happened look across hall saw thought mirage  closer surprised find new Vietnamese restaurant Vegas no talked yet   name called Pho Da Nang   menu consists many popular Vietnamese items such Pho Bun Thit Nuong rice dishes etc      Two things came mind when browsing through menu  first thing gotta try Pho hopefully very hopefully Vegas finally good Pho joint  second thing came mind pho price  Holy macaroni Pho better damn good if want charge $15 bowl + tax  Almost eveything menu ranges $13 $15 Normally would find prices strip but Rio 5 blocks away Chinatown    Anyway ordered Pho combo came pretty quick  bowl consists noodle rare steak sliced beef shank heck??? beef shank doesn't Pho beef shank normally Bun Bo Hue soup  those familiar Pho combination normally thinly sliced rare round steak cooked brisket tripe tendon    Did bowl Pho pass taste test? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  soup bland un flavorful is word?   put bunch fish sauce hoisin sauce edible  thinly sliced steak tender but beef shank tasted fatty right Pho  Overall Pho two stars   Overall better cut down price improve quality if want attract local customers  Since close Chinatown highly doubt rely tourists main customers if don't improve food  <EOR> Ate twice because staying rio well Vietnamese  Rice dishes pretty good but stay away everything else including namesake pho  <EOR> I stayed Rio happy see Vietnamese restaurant right next registration desk  twice far during 6 night stay  tried pork chop rice plate beef rice plate rare beef pho  All dishes great! pork chops favorite  want back tomorrow try chicken rice plate  would definitely recommend place    $11 per plate Rewards card   Ample seating sports theater next door <EOR> This place sure hit spot when hungry   $12 players card rice plate seems bit expensive though   wait excruciating too   only ones ordering food took least 15 minutes    least 3 times check food   She kepy saying ready yet   wonder chefs doing back   would come again because really dislike Rio   far everything making one's choices very limited  <EOR> The meat seasoned wonderfully especially beef #18!   Kind pricey considering amount food ordered rice plate scoop rice some meat but course Vegas everything more expensive! First time eating Vietnamese good introduction Customer service good didn't know doing when ordered rice stick plates hostess told cold dishes which didn't want  She able recommend two other dishes similar ordered originally but warm dishes served rice  <EOR>
