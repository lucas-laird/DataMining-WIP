Enzo Pizzeria Enzo formaily know La Golosita    under new managment place offers great food great service great price! favorite fresh made pasta    Just home   However all food really really good  Must try's Mac cheese  Ravioli any dessert  <EOR> Enzo's nice change business park offers good Italian food  Calamari point pizza equally delicious <EOR> Can't review food since never served!   Everyone arrived party served eating couple already finishing meal getting ready leave   even before ask dinner salad   given poor excuses horrible service wait walked out  <EOR> Went two hours before closing wife both craving some pizza late night when noticed place parking lot  Easy overlook since way back too  ordered personal pizza the veggi some stuffed shells small house salad well split everything up  surprisingly good!  The house salad fairly big portion especially considering ordered small  I'd say looked double portion size most restaurants when order same thing  personal pizza delicious exactly hoping for  greasy crust managed stay firm cheese didn't slide completely off first bite lol  Also despite saying personal pizza both managed fairly full sharing single pizza  stuffed shells barely touched because salad pizza but piece did eat cooked properly seemingly rarity experiences portion bigger expected    In end quite happy experience ended taking nice amount leftovers home us  If looking inexpensive yet tasty pizza experience wife very much recommend Enzo! <EOR>
