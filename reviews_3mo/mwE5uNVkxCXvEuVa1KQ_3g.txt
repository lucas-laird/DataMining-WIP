Ordered something simple patty melt! Dried bread over cooked patty 14 French fries guest ordered fish n chips all breading few fries must shortage if potatoes never again over priced crap <EOR> Bartenders attentive unless customer not hits royal  Three work shift cannot handle less 25 customers   Also cannot deal players cards   Took over 30 mins one   Then  misplaced next time another one  organized  <EOR> After reading some mixed reviews decided check Distill ourselves  Things started great but quickly downhill  First off place nice huge bar area lots TV screens  sat restaurant area during happy hour started Mashed Potato bites and great couple HH beers wells drinks food  all different sliders sweet potato fires  fries very dark others which looked freshly made hot but loaded salt  sliders could made cardboard never tasted anything dry  chicken cordon blu sliders chicken tender topped driest ham ever  could barely eat any them decided take them home dog see if he could choke them down  waitress disappeared food sat least 10 minutes before asked another waitress to go boxes   When bill came wrong HH drinks full price when she came back corrected bill some drinks corrected but added another full price  wanting waste anymore time  waiting correct bill deducted overcharge bill waitress's tip left  <EOR> Great addition southern highlands area!

Perfect local hangout    bad news    The food HORRIBLE   ordered pretzel bites medium wings   Pretzel bites clearly frozen reheated gloppy poor excuse cheddar cheese disgusting homemade beer mustard soupy gross mess   sent back   Wings ok   sauce little vinegary    Ordered avocado egg rolls Servers recommendation    bad idea   it wonton wrapper filled guacamole    looked gross   kinda baby poop wonton wrapper   zero texture just gross   back beer cocktails  only   Sadly feel could done better  <EOR> Went late lunch friends bar  bartenders really nice attentive but food lacking  pretzel bites way chewy tasted microwaved dipping sauces good  Hoping kitchen improves good location staff nice  <EOR> Walked into Distill thought we'd walked into Eden  first last visit  Decent prices during football hrs planning being least 3 hrs  Until maybe 30 mins into when asked move unique 1 2 machine bar woman just won cashed decent amount assume other wanted play where sitting  playing machine while hands dirty due appetizer sampler arrive 5 mins prior waiting play until finished  Though boyfriend next playing machine having already asked if playing asked move different seat  Thoroughly upset polite say no speak mind    Felt appropriate add well women's restroom poor order  two stalls only paper but toilet seat covers covering floor stalls  accidents people happen would paid attention if weren't fact could hear myself even speak loud due loud music  don't often mind being mid 20's but really?  As good food reason 2nd star regular would become living working just down road won't returning  Which saddening since Molly's closed food good    Don't expect stay seats may choose common courtesy establishment unless Brianna  <EOR> I love coming here  Good food just great place kick your friends    Also bartenders wait staff really cool  Next time coming cigar  <EOR> We just dinner Distill exceptional! extremely excited Distill open especially because knew owned same people own Remedys  food yummy! gyro much better even imagined  meat tender pita warm soft! really good  also fish chips beef tips country fried chicken sliders! all really good  Everyone just kept commenting good food was  love separate entrance section restaurant bring your kids  Megan server although she busy she extremely sweet attentive all around really great server! couple other ladies also came table help things everyone beyond friendly attentive!!
