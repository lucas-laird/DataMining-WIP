D <EOR> Our first visit BJs   Several friends said TRY   PLACE believe if could caps bigger would!  third newest location Vegas valley all say TRY PLACE lol   wife Monday afternoon typically slow time restaurant but time joint packed knew something good happening     We started Avocado eggrolls which simply melted mouths  Tatonka stout darkest beer those stouts richest creamiest chocolatiest stout ever party mouth   shared deep dish Mediterranean pizza fantastic took half home   Shared chocolate chunk pizookie dessert but honestly rest meal fantastic famous pizookie simply pleasant afterthought point     Can't tell happy former east coast residents finally find pizza good Las Vegas because let tell long search!  Edited 3 8 16 first review five stars two Maybe BJs victim its own success but whatever reason place used be   This downgrade based two most recent visits both Beer Dinners which advertised well advance require signing save seats because popularity   first beer dinner speak Summerlin location six months ago apologize mentioning but clear problems experience chain wide confined particular location    The Summerlin beer dinner supposed begin 7 pm   wife arrived early 6 30 checked desk told room wasn't ready yet   ten minutes later others around waited same beer dinner started seating people but order arrived but some unrecognizable system only knew   arriving early did NOTHING help seated sooner fact last couples seated despite people arriving later being called before us   Bad start BJs   think beer dinner featured Stone Brewery favorite beer brands   But somehow managed pick some least pleasing Stone varieties strike two   Fast forward last night Centennial location where signed beer dinner featuring Lagunitas brewery   arrived 6 45 7 pm event lobby area PACKED others also waiting beer dinner   desk said Oh room almost ready just few more minutes  Finally 6 50 huge throng people starts moving towards room reserved beer dinner   wife didn't hear any announcement but tacked end line appeared heading correct direction   checking people entrance room which slowed line dramatically saw room almost capacity before even reached entrance now 7 pm hadn't even finished seating   wife looked each other said Let's leave did     I admit fan crowds 7 pm LATE dinner me   factors certainly played into decision leave   But BJs need better perhaps consider opening room 30 minutes before event don't sardine canned patrons your lobby   if know popular event beer dinners often sell perhaps consider maxing room those fond crowds like feel little more comfortable   things would long way toward pleasing your customers  <EOR> Pizookie near house ahhhhhh!!!!!   I am happy BJ's opened Centennial  excited when saw being built could wait open  hope shorter lines Summerlin!
