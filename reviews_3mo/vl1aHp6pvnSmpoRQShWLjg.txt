Didn't think we'd bad experience but knowing restaurants just open wasn't sure     But great course food never disappoints  Just wish could dessert   probably back weekly  Only down hostess confused reservations mixed but no biggie <EOR> I stopped check new Lucille's happy hour   still going through some opening pains caused service below expectations   Hopefully service improve staff gains more experience   highlight wedge salad delicious crispy smoked bacon bits   Irish nachos French fries cheese tasty but soggy cooled off   fried green tomatoes good but batter broke off tomatoes when cut   rib tips  sausage well prepared but general find Lucille's BBQ sauce sweet taste  also didn't really care biscuits sugar top   Finally happy hour drink choices good selection Skky Vodka martinis but found happy hour beer selections limited primarily house brews  <EOR> So happy opened Red Rock! Food great!

We Saturday evening seated quickly  asked if happy hour still man said no then sweet lady said would able take advantage bar area still Santiago SCORE!  We sat next water front Red Rock super nice! night bit chilly but ok   Im going keep short waiter idiot didnt listen whilst taking order messed half it  then politley asked corrected he AGAIN didnt pay attention ended having incorrect order  THEN askd waitress set tableware she looked though asking million dollars then only reason asked because didnt give enough!!  The food cold flavorless basically ignored 90% night due large party bar area  supervisors most waitstaff kissing groups behind getting pathetic   There sat waiting waiting waiting  Cold food all!  We asked speak manager server gave dirty look asked why? WHAT!? Why? Because said so! Jesus! manager helpful said because still new hadnt opened long time  BULLSHIT! Your servers staff just bunch arrogant morons    The end! <EOR> We such great service Dana food drinks great good price <EOR> We decided try Lucille's tonight take out   did online order morning pick 4 30 PM   ten minutes early ready yet which good because wasn't made ahead time sitting somewhere   online ordering big plus!!  I original pulled pork sandwich side mac cheese   wife Cajun chicken sandwich side garlic mashed   problems simply fact take out   live nearby but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when placed bun therefore wasn't hot sandwich fact wasn't warm   Luke warm would closer temperature meat   mac cheese stayed warm   thought sandwich dry even though menu says tossed special sauce   Maybe should asked some BBQ sauce go   no toss could discern   mac cheese very good   wife liked sandwich although she thought very spicy hot   She liked garlic mashed side   I guess just BBQ person   Nothing BBQ blows socks off   If came back Lucille's would dinner mac cheese   take international cuisines good steak before I'd this   There's other BBQ place need try before put nail BBQ coffin lower ground   price value just isn't there   But Lucille's OK  Just  <EOR> Tried Lucille's lunch  service prompt server friendly  Between two Baby Back Ribs  Pulled Pork Hot Link Chicken Breast  sides coleslaw mashed potatoes  Both sides good  The ribs pulled pork chicken tasty right amount sauce much smoke  hot link nothing special  did encounter 2 pieces fat hot link    My biggest surprise size rib bones  never seen rib bones short Lucille's   consider myself student BBQ avid backyard smoker ribs all over USA Memphis May Reno BBQ Fest  miniature bones  asked server why bones short if entire slab would all short bones  She did know but willing ask manager  manager's answer pigs come all sizes??? There other restaurants Las Vegas serve better BBQ lower price point  summary Lucille's just OK <EOR> After eating District Lucille's years expecting location least much District location   say bar much nicer   seats comfortable don't feel crammed plenty TVs   where sitting each guy easily able see NFL game choice     But food fell short District location   fried onion straws pretty much same needed seasoning   But find issue District location well   catfish po' boy other hand nowhere near quality District location   bread tough quite stale but certainly fresh   problem compounded fact sandwich which comes 2 sauces nearly dry   order more each sauce a remoulade tartar sauce    wait caused sandwich cool down which made eating less pleasant when finally sauces   macaroni cheese standard similar if exactly same District location   I'm sure give Red Rock Lucille's another shot   service good said much better bar area   But order something else hope food more similar food enjoyed years District location  <EOR> This restaurant did disappoint  amazing service food delicious  tritip bf combo  Also banana pudding awesome! <EOR> I order same thing every time baby back pork ribs mash potatoes peach lemonade  delicious  prefer original BBQ sauce but sweet spicy good too  only kicker ribs dry sometimes  Hmm   The service also bit slow but casual spot    bring friends prepared hang out! <EOR> I waffled writing second review particular Lucille's written other spot Green Valley before  However feel experience different enough warrant location specific review    My other review mentions things quality meats sugar content everything ever presence high fructose corn syrup  None changed food still just A OK Yelp calls it  special outstanding but also bad if know you're exactly expect   The difference review comes down building itself staff bar   First building seems much larger just better laid out  isn't great layout but *is* better District opinion  seems just more space even if space seems awkwardly placed   Second staff particular seems more friendly happier work  Maybe because new place none employees become jaded corporate worker drones yet  knows?  Third bar  mix drinks stronger  simple that  Everything ordered District delicious  Everything ordered strong tasted mildly flavored booze instead mixed drink where alcohol fades into overall flavor  some people may great but don't taste well quality alcohol having background otherwise delicious drink welcoming way good night started  <EOR> Me hubby earlier dinner restaurant itself nice clean new course But why need 50+ server maybe even more slow weekday? literately watching maybe stare whole time because 98% them nothing but stand chatting     super uncomfortable manager whatever   ? think Ill stick Henderson's Lucille  <EOR> So capital letters HATE Barbecue  Ok maybe hate but if choice BBQ eating nothing I'd choose nothing     Except Lucille's!  I'm fan smoked anything but put just right amount smoke Q don't feel myself am inhaling smoke directly smoker  Memphis BBQ sauce me  hearts some garlic sauce right amount everything!  Another hooray moments when told unsweetened flavored teas WHAT?! dislike sweet tea lot  If want pound sugar water ask syrup  most places flavored tea but always sweetened no likey  watermelon peach regular sweet tea    They nice backyard BBQ theme stage Flying Pig Lounge which leads believe intend use day live band  It'd pretty cool come live band even comedy show failed restaurants space hope sticks around! <EOR> I driving 215 saw Lucille's Smokehouse just opened   friend raved Green Valley   never gotten eat because convenient where live   love BBQ called see if Lucille's patio seating if I'd able bring small dog   lady Red Rock did know she transferred Lucille's where guy answered phone gave very curt no patio hung before could ask anything else!  He didn't even say bye he just hung speaking   Seriously?  new place just opened you've already rude crap ton bbq spots Las Vegas  <EOR> As far chain Bar B Que always preferred Lucille's over Famous Dave's am happy finally opened neighborhood   honey butter addicting!  waiter Christopher friendly knowledgeable far drink regular menu concerned   He didn't steer wrong Minty Julep Gentleman Jack Crocodile   ordered half rack two sides   feel price little high but  expected chain Bar B Que establishment   whole table loved shredded onion appetizer   Friday night around 7 party three no problem being seated   would back try Happy Hour bar maybe next visit  <EOR> We finally tried Red Rock location liked it   big portions couldn't even finish meal  tried Fried Dill pickles   pretty good  <EOR> Love Lucille's Henderson thought would try Red Rock because closer  sunday night seated promptly  waitress took orders but come back twice see wanted steak kind potatoes wanted  When food came warm  new york strip  Very taisty  put dollop butter steak but isn't hot enough melt it  back hopfully wait staff less forgettful  <EOR> The food great service great  Friday 7 seated 10 mins  sure call ahead before don't wait  <EOR> Loved place    Best ribs long time  Kudos  Ari server he polite professional attentive server    Cozy ambiance bar area   Wish close home    May back again tomorrow! <EOR> Only real BBQ summerlin area   Cute restaurant good service   Try fried pickles  kids love strawberry lemonade   <EOR>
