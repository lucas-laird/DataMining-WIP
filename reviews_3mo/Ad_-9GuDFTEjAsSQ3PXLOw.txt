I actually swore off subway awhile moved GA  because didn't subway anymore but because 3 day drive think ate subway nearly EVERY meal  Apparently truckers LOVE footlongs  P time absolutely sick subs fast food general really   Finally craving tasty sandwich came back off subway go  Tastes just good remember  location clean service good vegetables fresh even spinach which something don't find often back home  Perhaps all subways spinach but wouldn't know   Only thing didn't didn't sliced Monterrey cheddar only shredded  Weird  <EOR>
