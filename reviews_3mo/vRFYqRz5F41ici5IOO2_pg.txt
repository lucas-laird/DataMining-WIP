So basically 3 businesses rolled into one filipino convenience store water store sushi to go store    As far filipino store pretty basic  Lots snacks dried noodle packets some frozen foods some beauty products  prices decent outrageously gouged other filipino stores but cheapest either  also saw chiller machine aka slushy machine back where wasn't clear whether employee operated only available customers fill slushy cups themselves  But only 2 flavors mango something red   The water store part takes whole wall small space  pretty much bring your bottles fill them nice lady counter charges gallon  also sell all kinds water bottles dispensers throughout store    The sushi order front counter lady back your order fresh  Although menu full variety rolls nigiri way lady spoke felt only 2 kinds fish left tuna eel  ordered eel roll $5 99 nigiri mix plate eel tuna $7 99  also maki rolls available California cucumber vegetable etc    The sushi actually pretty fresh tasty  come packaged grocery stores but without weird staleness rice fish  total $14 8 pieces  eel roll cucumber avocado nigiri plate 4 generous pieces each eel tuna pretty good deal  Everything fresh nothing stale but only downside if you're rush might want order ahead time because she took 10 minutes both orders   And just wanted note eel fresher oversauced most sit down sushi places town  taste wasn't fishy sauce wasn't overpowering much quantity  Nice  <EOR>
