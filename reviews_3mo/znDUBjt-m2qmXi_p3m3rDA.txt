Horrible!!! OK perception Las Vegas buffets being outdated overall nothing but mediocre  being said place doesn't even live reputation   My girlfriend just looking something cheap easy while errands  saw Lee's knew just opened thought 'why not'? weren't expecting much but something half way decent reasonable price  didn't either  Everything luke warm pretty tasteless  Most cooked death  kept looking something decent never found it  didn't even dare try desserts  To top off server asked if liked food when told horrible he agreed  But didn't stop dropping $30 check  ripoff  I know there's another Chinese buffet only block away cheaper way better  My prediction place won't last long  Thank goodness! <EOR> Actually going place years now   just can't down strip all time having quiet place  off strip isn't all bad   used called New China Buffet but looks remodeled outside brightened inside since last visit   Anyway contrary previous review Wifey thought Chinese buffet just fine   each found things liked pretty decent dinner tonight   fine dining but just fine nevertheless   Staff very accomondating   Even habachi cook couldn't wait grill little habachi style veges meat    and pretty good far style Chinese buffet restaurant   Dinner cost $12 99 includes drink plus tax   fried banana dessert just right amount sweetness made great end meal   give 3 stars because tonight pretty good compared other similar buffets around country   if you're area Chinese buffets think you'll fine night   empty your wallet strip another night  <EOR> So Lee's Buffet recently remodeled  hoping would mean high quality relatively fresh cuisine  sadly disappointed    I just lunchtime 12 00 try best experience  Most hot items sitting buffet nearing room temperature  cold fruit cold but slimy cut day before stored refrigerator    The best items buffet sodas white rice  Don't waste your time here  <EOR> I ate hour ago  Feeling pretty sick hope its food poisoning  Tried alot seafood  impressed  food didnt seem warm should have  fault eating guess    would recommend !!!!! <EOR> i m pickie eater well personally liked food m service alright even thou need improve but sure liked place would defintely come back bring more friend  <EOR> When originally reviewed Lee's Buffet gave them only star rating I very impressed quality food Since then inspected health department temporarily closed now they're reopened I eaten several times last few weeks all honesty food does seem gotten somewhat better I am changing rating two half stars Since don't half stars marked three stars I doubt ever favorite Chinese buffet I still find myself wishing food could better when eat here But could worse I find acceptable place eat at The staff pleasant enough I would suggest if find yourself area give try least meal If looking top notch food probably won't find here But might your liking People's tastes food subjective some people some people won't I really hope don't end  restaurant report frequently health violations did when New China Buffet I still continue eat now occasionally I keep posted further developments  <EOR> Sunday dinner buffet  $12 99 per person   enter hostess very busy cell phone texting   almost disturbed coming in    very nice looking clean buffet   but       Nowhere near 150 items say have   The food looked good but labeled didn't know having   And didn't matter because all tasted same     5 PM maybe 15 18 others there   The spare ribs crab legs short ribs empty when came remained empty until almost ready leave   seafood soup no seafood hot room temperature   Same shark fin soup no fin it   fruit small dessert bar didn't look fresh either  Most trays 1 2 full best refilled   Actually only items liked mussels clams   In hour asked if needed drinks refilled but did clean table off timely manner   From table watched employees eating kitchen well   Sorry Lees  but coming back   way many buffets Vegas waste money here  <EOR> Was evening family going back  food worse ever but close bland tasteless  service very poor Hostess could bothered off cell phone entire time there    To maters worse when she seating she busy talking somebody else instead being interested us  food buffet lines marked am glad am allergic seafood because thought potatoes turned Sponge Balls    I would recommend place if given years worth free buffets  <EOR>
