Came lunch definitely ate off lunch menu  expensive classy restaurant disguised behind lackluster front semi crappy strip mall  wandered lost thinking would find cheap Indian joint instead treated fine dining  being initially shocked prices ordered some Murg Bharti off lunch menu which came some naan salad rice  dish good creamy flavorful  prices lunch items really weren't bad around 13 dollars per  mad though because ordered normal water brought 7 dollar bottle whatever  Give try just keep mind place fancytime   Edit came again lunch May 07 corrected little water issue offering both  even some extra papadums free  other items menu just good upgrading 5 stars because believe place best find vegas  <EOR>
