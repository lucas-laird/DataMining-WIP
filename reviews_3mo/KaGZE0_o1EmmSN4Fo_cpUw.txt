I brought some co workers just arrived flight northern Cal  Public House just opened few days ago wanted check out  valet parked once entered hotel Public house just left didn't  hike though casino   Our waitress Jennifer took good care service friendliness  happen only second table she waited Public House  OK food choice veggie pasta good portion olives various thin sliced veggies which made entree tasty light   I would return again if happen visiting Luxor  <EOR> Public House occupies former Company space casino floor affiliated Public House Venetian   We welcomed media night event many staff members everyone friendly  enjoyed all appetizers sampled which included sliders mac cheese bites wings pork nachos pesto chicken salad which favorite   The menu great variety although didn't sample any beer taps behind bar speak themselves! The servers made sure no without drink appetizers! really above beyond many company rep's stopped table welcome us   The restaurant space open decor typical sports bar plenty TVs viewing   It looks Luxor another top notch eatery! <EOR> How often two different restaurants open same name same city? guess stupid question because really don't care answer but surely creates some confusion  recently happened opening Public House Luxor  Somehow sharing same name expensive but superior Public House Venetian Luxor opened minimal fanfare couple weeks ago  Does hold well fancy Gastropub down street?  Public House Luxor decent but somewhat generic Stations feeling interior it very open clean but really stylized fun could be  features few pipes tied back beer kegs similar would find place Yardhouse even unrelated restaurant same name Venetian but they're quite impactful  There's darker more intimate inviting bar area well large open dining area  General Manager came table greet before food came mentioned official opening restaurant later night  early opportunity such exciting but kind leaves venue open revisit if meal less ideal early on   The menu isn't available yet website much else matter but Luxor page mentions 'upscale American Fare'  didn't really pay attention anything other burger half pound angus burger brioche choice cheese topping including mushrooms sautéed onions fried onions like  came didn't look impressive but meat great flavor upon first bite cooked more medium medium rare ordered  brioche bun buttery good mushrooms good flavor  cheese melted well coated entire patty  Speaking patty seemed hand formed wasn't close being perfect circle pretty weird shape it  Even if actually isn't hand formed illusion always welcome  Overall burger bit messy but somewhat negative connotation don't want apply burger formed standard looking burger every time gets dull irregular look bit refreshing   The fries sucked little flavor weren't really hot  very hard end kind odd unwelcome texture them  best part them definitely chipotle ketchup which wasn't option given waiter when asked if wanted ketchup but person brought food later no ketchup hand   The burger comes kettle chips salad $12 which isn't bad price restaurant directly casino but hate fact pay extra $3 fries instead  combined iced tea brought meal $18 75 very quickly which bit much get  suppose could start drinking water cutting easily $3 4 every meal but sure most visitors locations would probably order beer something more expensive doesn't matter much  additional money fries annoys but if you're looking burger don't want leave Luxor isn't bad  If you're willing walk couple minutes spend few dollars more Burger Bar far better choice  <EOR> This favorite spot Vegas vacation  boyfriend headed Luxor planning eating Pyramid Cafe  Unfortunately changed hours come little late  Bummed started work way food court when happened spot Public House  menu display outside immediately agreed eat instead    It very open restaurant big screen TVs covering walls  server Rian amazing! She greeted immediately drinks started appetizer Mac n' Cheese squares! fried Mac n' Cheese squares came 5 ? plate I cant remember basically gone second put table came buffalo wing sauce chipotle ranch sauce  Entrees followed soon after   I turkey burger guacamole smoke gouda onion bun  opted substitute fries healthier side salad boyfriend angus burger fries  Everything simply amazing  boyfriend complained onions not regular raw onions but sauteed onion placed under cheese hold against restaurant because server asked if everything burger ok he said yes  did steal few fries off boyfriends plate perfectly cooked opinion extra crunch outside without getting overcooked feel  definitely best french fry entire trip When restaurant only opened 15 days wish restaurant best hope chance eat again  couldn't stop raving food service rest trip! <EOR> Hubby stayed Luxor last weekend while visiting Vegas   dinner reservations N9NE later night wanted light lunch   noticed restaurant way room saw free drink coupon coupon book when checked in   cocktail rum punch which really good definitely highlight meal   He ordered chicken wings which really big serving Cobb salad   salad pretty standard     but hard screw salad?  chicken wings tasted Asian spice flavored wing rather buffalo wing  ok   ranch sauce tasted spoiled left pretty much it   Overall food average best  but drinks really well made   service OK but took way long food come out   decor nice ton TVs could catch any sports game picked satellite  Would back     probably but worst meal Vegas  <EOR> Had great time last night Public House Bodies Exhibit  staff extremely nice helpful food really really good  highly recommend stopping next time you're Luxor  <EOR> Met yelp group Body exhibit fantastic! open bar lot seating all important baseball football games on  finger food amazing!
