I love Taco Bell location no exception  Usually little bit slower others still newer  Service fast location behind Target Greatland Buffalo  <EOR> What happened Taco Bell?  use favorite Guilty Pleasures    it fallen far down list don't even crave anymore   Why? Because portions much smaller  Prices increased  Quality food downhill   My most recent visit other day ordered 7 Layer Burrito $1 99 2 Bean Burritos $1 09    Bean Burritos size ones sold few years ago 69 cents    now they're $1 09?  They're freakin' tiny unsatisfying   7 Layer Burrito taken huge hit quality too     all ingredients tasted bland     blech   Also Taco Bell habit putting Fire Sauce people use    only Hot Mild     and when ask some give 2 packets each item   easily use 4 5 per item    whatever   Overall Value Even though spent less $5 garbage   Only reason why stopped because old memories good junk food   Will return?  Eventually someday     but anytime soon  <EOR>
