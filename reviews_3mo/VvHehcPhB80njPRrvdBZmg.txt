I've only experience other Brazilian rodizio style restaurant before but trying Brazil Brazil guarantee won't going back Samba again   The food served four courses soup salad sides meats  But sides actually stay table meats come guess three even though say four  soup roasted red pepper similar kind sold stores but more orange color  The salad mixed greens carrots dressed olive oil vinegar  The sides included Brazilian cheese bread little bread puffs stuffed cheese amazing! Portuguese beef casserole potatoes carrots spinach fried yucca plantains fried bananas served variety dipping sauces yucca flour  The meats all flavorful cooked well though can't remember many them called  remember tri tip sirloin garlic spiced beef spicy chicken parmesan chicken sausage  ate LOT more but don't remember had   The atmosphere beats other restaurant far  When playing some mellow bossa nova music but band later walked played mix Latin Jazz American Pop Lionel Richie's Hello example     For $29 99 person quality quantity food you'll eat along classy but relaxed atmosphere Brazil Brazil worth cost  <EOR> Great new meat lovers restaurant  Typical Green Yellow Red method controlling continuous stream grilled meats  Gauchos serve 13 different cuts selections meats all skewers  Dinner starts off soup day then salad  Sauces mashed potatoes squash other vegetables provided main course  Meats cooked perfection however chicken breast dry liking  Service timely continuous    For special treat must try sorbets  presentation alone impressive   Meal without drinks desert fixed price less $30 00  real bargain quality food service all perfect surrounding  <EOR> This tough update because really place    but    invited some friends other day service completely failed My first experience two months ago great but second visit did enough servers kitchen could keep up   Everything came snail's pace sometimes waiting maybe 10 minutes plates completely empty middle buffet style meal   Towards end meal requested more rice vegetables waitress informed all out    everything   She explained overrun customers night offered take 10% off bill   She also explained she even waitress but bartender only filling because understaffed   take pity servers but management   To fair Tuesday night two large parties  maybe 25 people  may caught off guard   But should prepared shouldn't seated us   I still thought food very good high hopes place if staffing service consistent   They're relatively new definitely try them again few months but now lose star   hope next visit allows give back  <EOR> i wanted try place cuz read 2 reviews read article them  called them 702 888 6888 ask hours voicemail  guess should've first clue  good business would've leave message your voicemail says your hours going closed approximately 10 days prepare your grand opening  that's sign door said dunno if trek over hendo try again  <EOR>
