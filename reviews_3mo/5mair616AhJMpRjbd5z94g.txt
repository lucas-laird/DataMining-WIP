I tried eat today but appeared understaffed  waited short line 15 minutes hardly moved! Ultimately leave  probably wouldn't back because wasn't even peak hours! <EOR> This hole wall location where employees aren't always friendliest  subway does drive through  open till midnight however each time ordered multiple sandwiches through they've always gotten them wrong  <EOR>
