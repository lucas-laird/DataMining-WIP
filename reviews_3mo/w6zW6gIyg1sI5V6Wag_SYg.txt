Our server also very polite attentive needs   next trip Vegas definitely stopping meal!  Thanks Teppan Bento!! <EOR> While looking place grub dinner group friends attracted place 5 star rating  walked noticed pretty small sized space cashier right front walk 4 dine tables  area strength instantly noticeable excellent service  example friends asshole he brought soup neighboring restaurant  kind woman cashier offered spoon eat well cup water  If  good service don't know is! Onto food     The menu fairly small few starter dishes main bento boxes meat choices chicken shrimp beef    We ordered chicken shrimp box ribeye box sides seaweed salad fried shrimp  highlight definitely ribeye garlic butter came side it  Meat requested medium rare came such  Very tender full flavor  above mentioned garlic butter delicious compliment ribeye or any meats matter surprise why featured many reviews  seaweed salad also excellent might acquired taste since some people don't enjoy it     Pricing extremely fair serving size quality  2 bento boxes 3 sides paid total 50$    The place nice homey hole wall feel complimentary water cooler cups nice touch if don't drink soda    Great place great food def visiting again  <EOR> We ordered steak salmon fried rice bento marinated chicken bento  steak salmon both great  loved salmon yummy sauce steak garlic butter ginger sauce  marinated chicken slight BBQ flavor but think would more satisfied just plain chicken dip all sauces  live right area definitely coming back  still love going Musashi's down paradise but place close good quarter price  <EOR> I am utterly puzzled experience did mirror majority shared here  planned dine but no open seating  No worries live around block felt order wouldn't compromise quality    The steak bento box suggested when asked recommendations medium rare order gyoza chicken katsu  Service friendly but seemed very overwhelmed  surprise wait minimal    Our meal still piping hot when unpackaged it  110+ temps might helped  Digging gyoza fine but rather run mill  katsu fried crisp tender but pretty greasy  steak bland pieces ranged rare well done  quite bizarre  Two scoops white rice yawn  Sauce some sort needed  possible given garlic butter sauce bento box but thick clumpy all delicious  Sadly veggies highlight   I support small business but difficult when first impression rather flawed  <EOR> Clean tasty cheap food! Couldn't ask nicer place friendly workers  saw place going Fresh Easy try it    First thing noticed clean is  menu pretty basic stick just few items Bento box  Everyone welcomes walk think husband wife son run place  always try support family owned businesses  take seat run through menu decide marinated chicken steak combo two scoops veggies only scoop rice  All drinks canned bottled water cooler sorry no soda fountain found here  food comes shortly fresh tasty  Portions decent but nothing large  Flavor good steak also comes sauce kick which nice touch  meal offered some shaved ice house pina colada best tasting one  Nice meal $10 80 plate really can't complain all  full but no left overs take home  Definitely coming back another round  <EOR> My daughter hungry thinking where eat  Yelped places area found Teppan Bento never heard wasn't sure where could located  Near Fresh n Easy but seen all places area     Teppan Bento replaced old Philly Steak place    The lady owner greeted register asked if first time there  She over menu decided sit down figure order  ordered Katsu double protein plate daughter end ordered beef steak plate  also ordered shrimp tempura appetizer weren't sure sauces order owner brought all sauces try  favorites mustard ginger sauces  All sauces homemade good chicken Katsu crispy crunchy oily greasy all  shrimp tempura fried shrimp ver crunchy well  beef steak daughter ordered good without much seasoning would use sauces dipping meat in  mustard sauce very well steak  both lot food left over enough another meal   Did mention owner brought order seaweed salad try house? Yes!!!  We pleasantly surprised Teppan Bento its definitely worth coming back to  think try calamari steak next time side chicken Katsu  Can't wait!   I forgot mention water cooler those prefer water instead soda  Perfectly!  See soon Teppan Bento! <EOR> HIGHLY RECOMMEND   Great family run business  Food great! Recommend steak mustard sauce  Kids loved katsu chicken yakisoba noodles   Don't forget order your shaved ice! <EOR>
