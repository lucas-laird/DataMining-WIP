I hoping when Pancho's replaced Roberto's location would upgrade but sorely disappointed  sad report burrito ordered take out probably worst ever had  burrito cold tortilla flaky stale kind way order incorrect  asked french fries veggie burrito but none found  Instead pico burrito which did ask for  description veggie burrito no mention pico de gallo being added  Whose bright idea pour onion laden pico cold burrito?? starved but couldn't past half point burrito because dissatisfied taste  opted leftover take out pizza fridge instead!   Unlike Roberto's Pancho's does salsa bar  option red green salsa provided when your order handed counter  burrito small drink set back $7 36  There's $0 50 charge use debit card $1 charge using credit  painfully small inside would recommend take out only  only positive thing say order took 4 minutes make  Because experience fantastic failure coming back   YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015 #253 <EOR> Probably worst Mexican food ever had  Used Robertos  carne asada burrito quesadilla take 2 minutes weigh much bag feathers? nothing compared taste which freezer section your local grocer could provide better results  Won't going back  Save your $$$  <EOR> Even change Robert's Panchos still feel best Mexican food ever ! can't enough carne asada fries  fries cooked till golden  made fresh guacamole very delicious  fresh ingredients pico de gallo  carne asada cooked just right well  Very juicy flavorful  great variety menu anyone liking something specific  mexican food still best  <EOR> Personally believe location best hygiene moment walk realize clean floor well counters tables yes might salad bar anymore bummer but still serve green red salsa when receive your order don't limit its just more hygienic  whole facility well taken care    The food made fresh when ordered lot menu pick very tasty  really texture meat its bitting into gum experienced other places before its seasoned properly      Its still owned same people just name change said entrance people very friendly  constantly see same employees Robertos still working there  <EOR>
