Places where some simple dishes reasonable prices  Flush idea down toilet here  Sure omelet OK The Californian Seasonal Roasted Vegetables Egg Whites Avocado but unless baby unicorn tears next time wouldn't order again mmm unicorn tears   Strip mark up? it  But $7 bagel cream cheese? suck     I'll back drunk late night let know if $18 chicken fingers somehow worth cost  Doubt though  Skip  <EOR> Lobster Benedict very good  actually large pieces lobster nice  Hollandaise sauce bland    However price wise definitely little pricey  Most items $16 22 but vegas perhaps  expected  <EOR> Service 4 star  breakfast  Foodwise its 2 5 3 stars  Lobster benedict ok  Waffle sandwich ok well  Price food would say expensive side  <EOR> It's late night fun night Hakkasan seeing HARDWELL!!!! birthday couple wanna grab bite course am down! ordered LOT food  Unfortunately birthday girl suddenly didn't feel well once all food came  birthday man birthday woman while sat sampled little bit everything    Nachos chicken wings chili grilled cheese coleslaw french fries    don't recommend chicken wings breaded  if breading your chicken fingers all means THEM!! But just not  grilled cheese good came cut into four pieces tomato bisque type dipping sauce know just grilled cheese tomato soup! nachos piled high but just stealing jalapenos off pile anyway!  And server really nice understanding = The only thing say SUCKS no bathroom inside walk through casino alllll way bathroom when 4am you've partying all night heels business!! <EOR> My fiancé only came because only thing available time  No matter where always keep open mind especially 130am    We seated over menu couple questions waitress  asked if could tuna sandwich instead turkey  No don't tuna kitchen  Okay  fine    I kept looking saw nacho appetizer  Awesome love nachos some added chicken protein  Joked fiancé saying she would say no again  ahead asked again predicted she said no  because no chicken kitchen simply because couldn't didn't want to    I already very shitty mood blt sandwich  mediocre    In city everything place particular does option personalize    Anyone else looking them accommodate simple food requests somewhere else  place NOT! <EOR> This tough give 2 stars to  honestly think if wasn't outrageously expensive would 3  Yes know Vegas Vegas expensive  But Denny's style menu breakfast lunch dinner all day just shouldn't much   After much debate between make your own omelette french dip    french dip  It big  Maybe big  I'd almost describe some bread meat  sandwich itself wasn't bad  soaking wet grease which disappointing but quality pretty good  sauce they gravy instead au jus waaaay salty  toned down salt would lot better  saving grace fries  really quite good   It's noise level little obnoxious  know its Vegas but between casino amount employees yelling across restaurant little much  With big menu convenience being located MGM may worth shot  However your wallets    french dip $20  Ouch  <EOR> Had NY Strip smothered onions mushrooms salad potatoes Breakfast  Balsamic dressing weak life still good  Sometimes love life  <EOR> The decor really nice no music blasting which great breakfast  Well  good got  2 eggs NY steak $23 big mistake  steak chewy but should expected that  <EOR> Hubby stopped Happy Hour check place out  5 5 special where sliders chicken strips truffle homeade potato chips nacho's   Patron shots under 5 bucks vegas steal couple those  Food pretty tasty service good restaurant very pretty inside very clean    Happy hour bit hit back! <EOR> I expected more because MGM but really let down  food whatever but service      horrible  don't know if waitress deaf if she busy group but awful  cousin found hair food  She brought wrong bread three us  She messed whole order except potatoes    but potatoes wrong? Maybe just ranting just waitress wasn't very professional but overall wasn't very good experience  <EOR> Went late breakfast   nice serve breakfast 24x7   ordered mixed scramble which fine   friend ordered steak eggs he wasn't happy steak   All all ok but expensive breakfast  <EOR> Avenue 24 conveniently located MGM Grand casino area   centrally located spot hotel made very convenient pre game grab few drinks appetizers before heading hotel   only eaten bar sure actual restaurant but most part enjoyed bar   bar couple TVs nice shelves lighting displays drinks good view casino area       I mixed feelings customer service because some bartenders friendly checked often   Other bartenders seemed uptight apparent didn't enjoy job   Despite service pretty good happy hour specials nachos yummy!  I'd return couple drinks quick bite eat next time MGM Grand  <EOR> The newly opened Avenue 24 cafe inside MGM Grand absolutely no appeal except its proximity Wet Republic  ended stopping quick or quick lunch right before day club whole experience quite disappointing   The only good part place service  waiter really nice friendly  Everything else pretty much sucked  First wanted order salad but just couldn't fork $17 caesar garden salad  Some things menu more reasonably priced type dish but prepared spend least $20 more per person   We waited food almost 30 minutes which created huge problem because guestlist closing Wet Republic  ended having only 10 minutes eat before rush because took food much longer expected come out   The taste left lot desired  skillet hash green sauce short ribs fries  both sound good theory but both came less average best  hash didn't good flavor overly salty  fries didn't enough topping short ribs also didn't taste much   With many great places eat Vegas would highly recommend skipping this  MGM sandwich shop  supposed good looks service lot faster  <EOR>
