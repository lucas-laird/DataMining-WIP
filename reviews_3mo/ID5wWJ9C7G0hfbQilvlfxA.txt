To beauty Mexican food very communal down to earth   Its flavors brought life through simple preparation simple ingredients mixed just right   just good homely food free pretentiousness generous quantity best enjoyed laid back unassuming environment   And  precisely where La Comida its cool bohemian ironically hip vibe collides heart soul traditional Mexican food   strips away real idiosyncrasies authentic Mexican dining order offer distant mutated version conveniently prepackaged haughty trend seeking crowd   Let's face no Mexican restaurant touting any kind authenticity would charge damn much such modest portions nor would pepper its ambiance faux Latin cover Sweet Dreams Eurhythmics dubstep remixes Ace Base which caught playing over PA   To fair food bad   Pollo al Horno actually tasty though bit dry side chips salsa also quite good obviously homemade   service also pretty good prompt very courteous basically root dissatisfaction comes down price   Look if you're going charge $20 margarita expect commemorative pair booty shorts kitschy container take home something   also no way shelling $5 PBR unless barrel also feel if going pay $16 chicken entree should own rice beans   Having share such tiny portion entire table didn't feel courtesy but more peeve   I'm sure want back La Comida   sense they're trying elevate experiment Mexican cuisine which all fine good but food just okay which considering prices ambiance means they're way off mark   cool vibe never replace satisfactory dining experience echo sentiments those who've said much rather eat cheap seedy joint offering better food reasonable prices   On note recommendations GOOD Mexican place?  Sorry LV area where still remain far impressed! <EOR> First time but write something  o Carnitas little bland dry side   Good sized street tacos but $5 50 each should big   BTW 2 order $11 order   did math  o Salsa little Old El Paso heavy tomato light well everything else  o Chips decent but sure if bag fried store   very salted which could good if your blood pressure high bad if flavor  o Shot perfect Don Julio Anejo but $19 better perfect   I cantina look place but mason glasses plastic chairs   Also no draft beer  did take picture food which fairly decent presentation   I typically am harsh ratings but $30 2 tacos shot while sitting plastic patio chairs does seem smart restaurant ing   suppose truth hurts hurt wallet sure  <EOR> One word  Over priced   Ok two words  opening day Two  7 dollars corona  11 00 Guaq  Yeah  Authentic Mex  food  Authentic Prices  Careful gentrifying yourself existence  Hip Cool keep doors open  <EOR> We'd walked restaurant peek talk girl front menu any questions had  friend asked if used lard refried beans but she said she didn't know  He asked vegetarian vegan options menu she didn't know   We made mistake going next day lunch  Awful service high prices music little loud  large party seated fairly promptly just promptly ignored  No contact past door  restaurant barely half full clearly wait staff weren't really all busy    The food saw around room tiny portions especially high prices  wasn't keen paying $8 bottle Corona  if hate service yourself if spending lot money being cool  15 20 minutes no contact staff party marched out  <EOR> La Comida pretty good addition East Fremont area I'd say par places Diablos   But never why prices high Mexican restaurants   portions little small side would normally served each plate other restaurants rice beans brought via community plate  drinks aren't cheap either   7+ beer something 15 45 margaritas! service received waiter assistants excellent   back again when craving some fancy mexican fare if downtown  <EOR> La Comida New Las Vegas Fremont Street East!

Carne Asada $12 which consisted 2 tacos   basically $6 tacos Pollo al Horno $16   tip $100 dinner Mexican joint   Food good service good although could use hostess stand front no greets when walk in decor nice   However wait Nacho Daddy open before having another Mexican meal downtown  <EOR> From looks other reviews love hate place   great time thought food really good   best meal 4 day Vegas vacation service absolutely outstanding   We sat bar because tables all full   bartender awesome super friendly top everything   She offered chips salsa right off bat chips thick crunchy delicious   salsa pretty good   carnitas tacos which yummy   meat tender juicy which actually used getting usually fried drier    hubs smoked beef  dish he really liked   also ordered Paloma which light refreshing   hubby's b day gave free shot which really tasty   I really no complaints   knew wasn't low rent low quality restaurant before walked door exceeded expectations   wish them much success  <EOR> I'm total downtown hipster hater course eyed place huge trepidation month opened  LOOKED overpriced annoyingly pretentious place   but trying judgy finally see up   Honestly feel there's no excuse charge prices Mexican food  mean wtf  guacamole corn chips tequila pete's sake! wasn't reCOCKulously expensive  bad I'd feared  but still pricey was   Food wise everything ok  free chips salsa fine nothing ordinary but did replenish basket without even asking give them points that  ordered cheapest margarita list which $9 OK    bad Strip standards but isn't Strip!! Then street corn appetizer which good but   any better real street corn Valley View Sahara fraction price? Then snapper tacos which ok but again   two smallish tacos $12 whatever was? Really?   Ambiance wise place NEARLY annoying I'd expected  actually kinda low key give them points having plentiful outdoor seating   Overall place OK but    expensive consider going back there  <EOR> This exactly type place looking during entire trip Vegas  Off beaten path chain funky decor no pre mixed drinks great made order food   It pretty slow Tuesday night greeted seated right away  Server Frank came right over process going chips salsa water cool little mason jars everyone seems doing days  He answered questions explained menu etc   I ordered whatever Server Frank suggested he didn't disappoint  mojitos margaritas? Then Verano de Jalisco best drink during whole time Vegas  salt girl but couldn't enough salt Mexican spice mixture rim glass   Start ceviche Frank said  Absolutely  shrimp juicy plump plantains added just right amount sweetness   Get shrimp tacos Camaron al maya Frank told me  Done done  Once again shrimp plump filled tortilla perfect amount cabbage queso fresco taste just right   My friend shrimp enchiladas besides sharing chips salsa ceviche didn't offer each other try dishes because good didn't want give them up   The only thing turned Frank down dessert  didn't want press luck dessert disappoint though sure wouldn't  maybe just didn't want rid Verano drink taste polished off meal with    Try place out! Really no complaints  agree people say its pricey  2 shrimp tacos $13 but vacation Vegas felt ok splurge! <EOR> Very solid restaurant worth checking downtown  Hopefully help lead resurgence downtown dining business outside Fremont Street hotels casinos  The points people cost somewhat valid but isn't taqueria much more chef driven better quality restaurant  Puerco ahumado $15 but huge portion smoked pork mole`  Great taste  $11 2 tacos overpriced but high quality getting pay for  usual taqueria all tacos $1 30 feel price point issue everyone else  These modern upscale versions Mexican food don't come expect authentic see comment $1 30 tacos above idea Mexican American food but lots variations Mexican cuisine including fine dining Mexico really authentic ?   Nice place communal seating very nice looking antique ish back bar very good service place worth checking out  drinks interesting massive selection tequilas $100 try if you're interested something other Jose Cuervo  Taqueria Taco Bell vs  upscale Mexican choice you  If want better former 2 place worth visiting  <EOR> We very skeptical trying La Comida all reviews   seated actually didn't greeted server 15 min busy Saturday night   busser did bring chips waters first thing though which nice something while waiting server    The manager noticed waiting awhile apologized   He sent server over night mediocre fantastic!  server apologized very attentive on   Although he busy he made sure explain food items suggestions   surprise manager comped first round drinks house made guacamole! Which awesome!!   I won't long drawn but besides waiting bit beginning first experience La Comida good one   pozole fanastic especially guacamole street corn appetizer!   The vibe fun energetic   put lot effort into aesthetics fun glance around see all details around restaurant   We definitely going back! <EOR> Johnny best! Good service fun atmosphere delicious drinks! back food    <EOR> I think things changed!  took group friends birthday past Thursday because Le Thai booked   Service amazing food good hot fast I told waiter bar reservation meet 45 minutes we left time!     The chips salsa came just before ordered   Very good warm   added trio salsas    I think La Comida best michiladas ever had! I each fish tacos which came rice beans both ridiculously good $13    husband queso which he said just okay   friends ordered enchilada fantastic reviews two people ordered pork shoulder fantastic reviews     Unfortunately sounds restaurant off wrong foot however would say favorite Mexican restaurants! <EOR> I really liked place  hubby lunch Monday   we greeted door 2 lovely ladies genuine smiles! We immediately seated greeted drinks aps      We guacamole great    I shrimp enchiladas awesome hubby chicken burrito said great too  family style rice beans   just wished gave little more first plate     a little embarrassed ask another plate just two us  Great spot     would love come back happy hour! <EOR> I am write reviews but place   super excited try place   looks cool seems cool vibe   waiting place work some quirks since heard bad things bad reviews yelp   thought new just trying find groove   My boyfriend last night date night  saw all bad reviews then couple good reviews showed thought let's give place shot maybe other reviewers just used style Mexican food   price would expect kind place but food not   chips salsa great but two entrees bland   Where flavor seems non existent   Our server great she even offered take entrees off bill   Which think super cool because assumed would just pay them unhappy   Bottom line come back food!  I did see happy hour heard margaritas good come back try discounted margaritas some time  Maybe if drink couple margaritas won't care food bland  <EOR> V  Disappointing  vegetarians almost always find something order Mexican restaurant  No bueno La Comida! <EOR> Upsides Delicious food!!
