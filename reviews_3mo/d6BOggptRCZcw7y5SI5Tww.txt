Way over priced old furnishings slow inattentive staff  hookah lit correctly when asked light correctly rude finally gave asked someone else it  Which he did then problem fixed  However time small amount tobacco already mostly burned up  They give free refills fountain drinks ice tea anything else  No free drinking water  asked specifically tap water he still brought bottle cheap drinking water then charged 2 75 it  already bought soda same price  The food alright however once again overpriced  On weekends let African American people unless other people  terrible if would known did would even gone first place  know because couple friends tried come waiter says where no tables available  show table no problem  This place terrible should shut down  <EOR>
