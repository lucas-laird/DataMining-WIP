I mostly ended grabbing breakfast  leave sandwich lunchy fare someone else   bagels because convenient   4 50 pricey but par anything you'd strip   coffee actually normal starbucks prices delicious   would liked some decaf options but probably only humans isn't wanting caffeine long day night   companions ordered breakfast sandwiches seemed them ok well   Stop quick snack but venture you'll better food elsewhere if actually take time sit down  <EOR>
