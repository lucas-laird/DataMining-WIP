I originally visited L L almost year ago except review listed under 2595 Maryland Parkway location instead  Unfortunately Yelp HQ can't move any reviews   so guess write new location then  I really enjoyed first experience loving pork lau lau other goodies chicken katsu short ribs   even gave them four stars first time   However things since changed     Their regular pork lau lau order came two scoops rice scoop mac salad two pork lau laus $8 50  nothing special time   rather dry just enough fatty goodness good   actually leftovers time when good stuff   I eat all!  mac salad rice only okay too    The BF ordered Seafood Combo Plate Lunch $8 20    Seafood Combo menu but picture wall   three pieces fried shrimp deep fried mahi mahi beef short ribs   Two scoops rice mac salad come combo too   Nothing special once again   Counter service okay   girl register obviously bored very routine working there   Overall pretty disappointed experience L L especially really enjoying first time   probably won't find back again any time soon  Pics lunch posted business profile  <EOR> Oh L Ls where since left Chambana?  University Illinois only place east Vegas L L location but sadly closed within year   The next year closed first trip Vegas being over 21   L L immediately agenda again just past week   mix BBQ plate amazing chicken katsu   also love he macaroni salad comes every dish   SPAM musubi good if SPAM REALLY love rice there's bit much it    Sadly location bit lacking especially compared used university   No free cilantro soup entrance washroom outside gas station   If live area I'd say take food go   If you're visiting I'd say least consider trip off strip some great cheap Hawaiian  <EOR>
