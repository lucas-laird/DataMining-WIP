Before few more fast food options popped barren southwest Panda Express place sometimes ended when tired cook drive far  husband always tried different items spring rolls cream cheese wontons no crab meat once  Then read Panda's website fried meat products  Duh know  Kudos Panda Express being forthcoming though  Mike would usually end each meal Never again  because food terrible but just because fast food once distracting roar Feed Me! silenced think really tired couldn't sandwich? Something less greasy? Tastier? talk full tummy course forgotten good hot crispy food anywhere made other people sounded hour before   I give particular Panda Express A OK rating though  interior always spotless  Two staff always friendly helpful  quick suggest cheapest way set your order they're patient slow orderers time wontons suggested wait few minutes something fresher already tray     Also close closing time  sounds obvious but if 30 minutes before closing food  Try some other fast food places area especially unnamed few doors down you'll told clean time  hours restaurant's door especially fast food place customer cleaning crew    something  particularly important when may only because all good places closed  <EOR>
