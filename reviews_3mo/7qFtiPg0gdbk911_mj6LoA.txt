The Broiler located inside Boulder Station Hotel Casino   My favorite inexpensive steakhouse Vegas  opposite side town but totally worth drive   They start basket fresh baked breads  Save fresh soft baked pretzels!!!  Recommended entrees Filet Mignon King Crab Legs Lobster Tail Panko Crusted Shrimp  You order filet then add any other items reasonable price  Dinners include family style side dish least dozen choices  baked potato huge  creamed spinach delicious  sauteed mushrooms heavenly   The soup salad bar Just anything could imagine want salad bar there  Love chilled asparagus  tuna salad tasty  Just don't fill salad bar because there's great meal coming!!!
