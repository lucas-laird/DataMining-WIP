The only way place could better drive thru! Standard Don Tortaco Robertos food  Greasy cheesy fattening goodness  girl front even remembers usual order  Maybe often    clean fresh yummy friendly cheap  could better? <EOR> Breakfast burrito shrunk  Loved them before perfect size but think tortilla more burrito egg bacon cheese potatoe now  extreme regular    Might done  <EOR> Not bad  under new management owners  Fresh food head head Laurita's  give more details but open business  <EOR>
