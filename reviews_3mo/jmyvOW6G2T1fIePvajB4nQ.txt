We decided try something different found Cuba Cafe through internet  surprise cuban food pretty good  husband ordered salmon diced mango  Very yummy  ordered chicken marinated lime butter onion  bad  love lightly toasted bread! Cant stop eating bread keep asking another round bread  <EOR> Cuban cuisine known its awesome sandwiches place doesn't disappoint!  bread made fresh literally melt your mouth   If don't feel sandwiches there's plenty other things order mango salmon lemon cilantro mahi mahi ask some free bread banana chips along your entree   The restaurant real hole wall feeling which love great photos hanging wall beautiful dim setting sun light peering through windows   The only complaint steak little bit tough side  <EOR>
