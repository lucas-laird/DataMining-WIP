This Burger King slowest service ever experienced most inadequate human beings ever dealt with   Perhaps mean but am only speaking truth   probably smokey environment rotting brain cells     I step give order #4 medium onion rings diet coke  He slowly repeats while pushing some buttons register   move yeah whopper junior no mayo please  But he slowly repeats first order another 2 times   OK fine everyone quick ball   he gets second part order he asks if eat take out   told please he responds OK here  seriously thought he kidding just stared each other didn't say anything     After nearly 10 minute wait food comes fries instead onion rings!  food tray!  Ugh   did patience wait another 10 minutes order right just asked bag bagged order left   Now slightly feel jackass writing such mean review but guess need work anger management issues first  <EOR>
