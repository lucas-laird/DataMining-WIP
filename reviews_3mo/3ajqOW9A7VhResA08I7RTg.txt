After picking bib packet Saturday mornings 9 11 Remembrance Run 9  11 K race am running lady decided grab some mid afternoon lunch  Being eclectic people watching mecca west also known Fremont Street Las Vegas settled checking newly remodeled Plaza Hotel first foray into quirky Hash House which just opened recently   After getting welcomed seated both decided feast big bad sandwich INDIANA FAVORITES  Big O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich With onion pickles course ketchup whole wheat bun served your choice side  You'll think you're back Indiana! when Tommy server came take order rolled it   Except made fatal food service customer error   I asked if could some *lettuce* added above   See former Hoosier grew pork tenderloin sandwiches  staple VFW Post lunches greasy all night diners fairs festivals  Except HH description notes served 'traditional' combination lettuce tomato mayo  Understanding figured would compromise just minor deviation  lettuce added mine also please? asked   *pause*  Tommy want lettuce yours also  Uh well add except would come side come side item its additional upcharge $2 00  Did want that? silence while mentally calculating two leafs iceberg lettuce retails $2 00 food service   Um no  okay can't justify    Good thing didn't ask tomato and or mayo then   The meal came described hammered tenderloin HUGE  Mind depicted   Mine appeared bit differently Less fanfare presentation  Which still okay  no pickle  thing HUGE  wasn't bad taste wise   Tommy great server  Brought refill drink before less 1 4 remaining always gold standard  Pronounced last name debit card spot which difficult    Tommy also said checked manager lettuce she said could without charging extra    which don't agree personally    So all all particular server top game  food decent yet remarkable  bill sandwiches soda lemonade fries? staggering $39 00 lunch no adult beverages   That's right  Kind pricey lunch however guess portion size it   With said fact cannot simple addition iceberg lettuce reason back HH Las Vegas  buy entire head lettuce 99 cents  understand restaurants making profit certainly addition substitutions cost more  50 cents extra? no problem guess  come area where tomato seasonal item actually cost more off season i e  'deluxe' burger   guess same price should ordered hamburger which comes 'deluxe' instead   My point review rant customers restaurants often need substitutions changes dietary concerns that  However server discussing manager standing firm kind request such simple item bit line  lettuce $1 29 BK double cheeseburger nothing because inexpensive item  upscale restaurant needs *some* flexibility its policy adding vegetables side item  ordered side lettuce then would expect charged more because known salad  should asked trade pickle never sandwich instead called even   I don't policy speaking managers  last time did calmly left led fight relationship don't need hassle either  do?
