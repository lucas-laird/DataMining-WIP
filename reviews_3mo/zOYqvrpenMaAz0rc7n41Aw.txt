I used eat location least once week when lived here  Earning free sandwiches regular thing!   The shop always clean when come never packed  Today's visit out  staff extremely nice today always when come here   My only complaint vegetarian complaint might hold true most but wish didn't slice cheese same slicer slice meat  But am aware could simply stop coming here  Actually main reasons typically choose Subway over them   In end sandwiches always fresh flavorful  closest now Hualapai Flamingo same story there  Consistency key seem down  <EOR> I've always loved Port Subs  They're sandwiches way better Subway  location stood because far cleanest location yet! Even cleaner house Anthem  very impressed well service  <EOR>
