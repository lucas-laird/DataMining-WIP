Browsing through Groupon found Legends Café offering couple different deals  searching online unable find any solid info place decided just ahead purchasing Groupon trying myself    The restaurant located near intersection Rancho Rainbow just across street Sante Fe Casino  two doors down Dimas Tacos inside lot where old movie theater used   interior kind basic but nice homey welcoming feel keep very clean  There's good amount seating but offer to go orders well   We seated owners Yvonne kind enough answer questions restaurant food  She explained used another restaurant location called Dirty South which never heard either  When took over 7 months ago revamped everything changed name  still offer classic soul food dishes but investing new $7k smoker smoke complaints neighbors down street forced them put BBQ efforts hold  Apart setback still decent amount items menu including oxtail chitins even AYCE option    I ended ordering fried catfish dinner  $12 99 4 decent sized pieces fish 2 sides dinner roll  catfish appeared very fresh cooked well nice tender flaky interior  only complaint bit heavy handed coating breading slightly overpowering  flavor decent overly salty but think light pepper spices lacked slightly spicy kick prefer fried fish  also able sample fried chicken even though wasn't crispy think fried chicken should batter really good nice subtle heat it  If same fish winner winner catfish dinner! Screw chicken!  Ultimately sides really stood though  quite few choose tastes put just much love into sides into main dish  ended trying collard greens fried cabbage mac 'n cheese potato salad  Both greens mac 'n cheese some best versions side any restaurant  sweet potato salad wasn't huge fan but fried cabbage absolutely incredible  perfectly cooked sweet salty spicy flavors but throw fresh peppers giving amazing texture too   If you're mood desserts handful homemade offerings  Unfortunately lady peach cobbler town didn't try but did order some banana pudding  could tell made earlier bananas starting brown wafers slightly soggy but flavor still very good wouldn't hesitate order again   I'm sure place gone 7 months without making way Yelp but sure hope stick around  only need good spots eat NW but Yvonne company great  don't drink sweet tea even though only ones restaurant time she offered brew unsweetened me  Above beyond service hard find its much appreciated  Legends Café certainly seeing again! <EOR> The boo found spot! am always excited when comes BBQ soul food  Do say alot? excited lot things    lol decided give shot  relieved find fairly close us  Located shopping center across Santa Fe Station Casino where movie theater used be  now replaced church  Santa Fe Mining Company same shopping center just all way back  Honestly would never found place just driving by     Once found ourselves only ones there  don't know why but always nervous  server came find owners sat wherever wanted  actually quite nice being only ones meant VIP service   chatting bit found no BBQ due complaints regarding smoke smoker  left fried foods  wasn't complaining never turn down opportunity try fried chicken  not talking KFC fried chicken dinner opted white meat which came boneless breast 3 chicken wings  traditional way but going give fair shot  also came two sides chose mac n cheese potato salad  chicken pretty good  enjoy ripping off bone but found easy less time consuming  breading chicken golden crispy delicious!
