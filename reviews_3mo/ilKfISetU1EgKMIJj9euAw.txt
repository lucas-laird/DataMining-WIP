I back soon <EOR> 3 stars because just dont many options me  Zero vegetarian options ramen only couple pescetarian options  veggie fried rice  Ok definitely better  place itself neat clean  service very good  friends ordered some dishes supposed include shrimp dish didn't ALL other dish tiny shrimp  Very disappointing  When she asked waiter if dish supposed shrimp he said yes didn't offer any explanation why ONE!  I say ramen dishes looked great!  Unfortunately place come back dish eat wasn't great  <EOR> Okay there's bunch Ramen places suddenly sparking valley we're no longer limited waiting around Monta seat open cursing damn hipster finished bowl hour ago checking instagram    Anyway no idea long place open nor anything else it  Just meet few buddies grab bite eat before meetup    Interior decor quite nice enough build vibe you're somewhat larger ramen house commonly found anywhere everywhere japan cept larger side    Anyway ordered Chicken shoyu ramen just because seemed interesting  Really wanted Popeye Ramen but wasnt willing pay price  never seen chicken ramen before usually pork but some broths chicken sweetness but again just never seen ramen actual slices chicken it   Bowl arrived presented met expectations  Only thing slightly disapproved chicken meat itself  Slices white breast meat  boiled  Sure tender all but didnt no flavor  could both ways because know some chicken but when came boiled chicken always stewing hens  Coming Vietnamese background many chicken dishes usually birds stewing hens which lot tougher then standard run mill chicken  meat tougher holds boiling there's still texture little flavor boiled while   expecting hopefully explains why low score why umimpressed chicken    The broth nothing compare against since dont usually order Shoyu  nice soy sauce flavor obviously since  based on    Overall air place  Sora still place ramen reason came because down street meetup location exactly sure when if come back try something else followup review      Yelp 100 025 100 <EOR> S o many ramen joints popping town newest one O riginally PRIMM   Who Knew? Seriously? R eally great service start finish A pparently serving desserts future   Koraku still getting settled into new location They've only open little over 2 weeks S hoyu Ramen good but favorite T etsuro Godzilla gave Koraku 5 stars didn't I rated Koraku three half stars   I think  fair enough L ove Ramen Curry Combos undecided peeps me    L oved Gyoza appetizer   great start meal crisp outside flavorful inside H ot Chili Oil mixed shoyu vinegar perfect your Gyoza A lways undecided when choose between Ramen Rice??? S eafood Ramen kinda bland squid rubbery     M y Beef Curry good but still prefer Z spot J Curry    Y ou shouldn't come Tuesday   WHY? They're closed  why! V ery good hot tea served too   $1 cup free refills O thers may agree rating    ask if care???? T exture ramen noodles nice chewiness it E veryone opinion experience don't let mine decide if wanna not    ! !!ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013 89 100 Ramen Rice??? Ummm   BOTH! <EOR> The tofu appetizer pretty plain but still delicious if fact tofu dress cucumber various little toppings green onion  Tofu pack cheap appetizer which believe half pack quite worth price   If order Volcano Ramen would probably give Koraku 3 5  haphazardly thrown vegetables just seemed unappealing  guess gotten used eating ramen only basics nori chashu  However best friend middle school Japanese mom would ramen same haphazardly thrown vegetables nostalgic twist    It wasn't vegetables did though  broth  spicy level Volcano Ramen okay but just type spice weirded out  tasted didn't belong ramen but would rather some type curry dish    Why 4 5 stars then? miso ramen! Whenever try new ramen place always miso first time there  Now am die hard Monta fan but think Koraku's miso ramen suits taste just well  might decadent rich Monta's but also where shines  chashu isn't fatty but still maintains its richness texture  broth very yummy heavy noodles cooked just okay maybe tad soft but always preferred firm noodles anyway    Our waiter seemed somewhat shy reluctant serving though if he forced into job  Maybe he's just new?   On another note ice water tasted really good cheap tap  +1 Koraku  I'd definitely come again miso  <EOR> With all new and old great ramen places town would hold rest?  Unfortunately friends answer big fat meh    Koraku mediocrity its finest     I ordered spicy house ramen extra chashu $12 95   broth tasted first   bland chicken based broth some sort bit spice added it   good thing ramen packed full stuff little pieces pork bok choy few pieces squid couple small shrimp etc   Overall ramen wasn't offensive any way but also pretty much average tasting   lot flavor complexity stuff   would say stay away squid rather rubbery   chashu also worth paying extra dry plain tasting     Overall am sure place going fare against two really good ramen places area   even little more expensive those better places service considerably slower   definitely won't returning when those other guys right down street   Seeing existing chain can't see food changing any time   is  <EOR> Yet another Ramen spot added ever growing list ones Vegas! could ever complain because love good bowl ramen  = decided try newest spot other day lunch  first things notice walked really liked decor all dark black color wood bar area perfect single guest  Unlike most other Ramen spots around town feel might biggest one  tucked corner behind Starbucks off valley view spring mountain  chance might miss little gem driving around  Just look Starbucks   The food surprised only serve ramen besides normal sides gyoza forth  also serve fried noodle dishes different kinds japanese curries just nice diversity menu  love fact! Plus offer combo just case thinking ramen curry  occasion feeling more curry mood beef curry side order six pieces order gyoza  presentation really simple scoop rice beef curry also little pickled daikon side  curry many places found serve Hawaii style japanese based curry  Kaba Curry place curry action  Korakiu just might taking over title best curry action Vegas  only thing felt missing more vegetables curry come think just beef it  enjoy flavor curry could any proteins offer loving life  gyoza perfect too! enjoyed filling point   The pricing very reasonable most Ramen places around town  sure long wait when its busy  If line long beauty location many more options road  server nice friendly did wonderful job  tried Ramen but trust willllll  greatest thing Koraku Ramen fact fixes same spot Ramen Curry!! Nom! Nom!! <EOR> Anyone Japan probably eaten Department stores where variety eateries usually top floors   quite good specialty restaurants days but back days remember seeing something okonomi shokudo where served all kinds food big restaurant all kinds wax displays accurately resembled food served which don't see quite much anymore      Koraku reminds those okonomi shokudo quite style Japan   serve all kinds food curry tempura tonkatsu ramen none them well specialty restaurant sticks genre food    As family eat curry tonkatsu ramen can't say impressed any them     I think place may done well 10 years ago but days where compete Cafe de Japon Sora Monta within 2 mile radius may hard time keeping up     The service great place comfy showa retro thing going want place but quality food just didn't me     I'm still waiting authentic tonkatsu place Vegas    please   someone bring over  <EOR> Friends mine myself bad experience   1st person ate Mabo Tofu bowl took 3 bites threw away   2nd person ate Beef bowl salty meat didn't taste fresh sure enough diarrhea stomache whole night   3rd person ate Yakisoba he said no taste he diarrhea whole night   I wasn't going write review but two days later friends come tell Koraku he ate Miso ramen soon arrived he told waitress taste smells funny  changed another ramen    His spoon reeked bleach soaked then given without rinsing  He told girlfriend stomache he leave class threw several times  <EOR> I'm sure people could enjoy food gets your loved ones friends sick   Worst food experience life !  Our friends ate told horrible  boyfriend wanted try heck let's biased try right? Well am greatly regretting it   We ordered korokke start which tasted just took flour cooked then served us  Worst korokke life which sad because love korokke  Next boyfriend ordered Miso Ramen while ordered Shoyu Ramen  Miso Ramen smelled funny thought maybe okay taste first  he tried said tasted sour weird then tried afterward  He correct tasted nothing Miso Ramen tasted weird smelled  boyfriend hate complain restaurants but food even edible let them know he switched Shoyu  When Shoyu came he tried told soup spoon smelled funny  He handed knew smell being former server another restaurant  reeked bleach amount should use sanitizing greater that  if poured entire cup bleach just gave us  gave boyfriend soup spoon instead since didn't really need it   My Shoyu Ramen other hand tasted OK   something tasted weird but couldn't figure out  best Shoyu usually favorite  noodles aldente inside but gooey slimy outside  two three bites really sick some reason   stopped eating took to go then tossed when home  My boyfriend also really sick friends right place  don't want anyone else getting sick friends wants try well even warning  Something done figure you're doing wrong fix just close place down  <EOR> I liked food   service good   atmosphere nice   didn't feel well afterward  why gave them 2 stars   other complaints yelp reviews say became ill ignored them try place myself   hope give place another shot 12 months' time  <EOR> cant remember already but curry good shoyu ramen good gyoza fried side rest soft   crowded busy other saimin place forgot name street lol <EOR> Really wanted place but probably won't back  I came group friends lunch place couple other customers  think Japanese maybe  sign place authentic? Looking through menu beef curry caught eye that  curry flavor very bold however left restaurant very thirsty maybe little much salt? also chance taste friends' ramen broths impressed  flavors little bland definitely lacked depth  also wished offer tonkotsu ramen since  favorite  might've ordered wrong stuff but seems ramen curry main dishes here  If want ramen more choices just down street  <EOR> Finally around Koraku! new Ramen house Spring Mtn course! does fair?  I thought all ingredients fresh tasty but chashu more thick less tender most  broth little mellow full flavor depth but still good  would recommend trying since every place town does little different    the reasons wasn't blown away might reason it   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=oD10Sx3yR8wQtoJTp9CVxA#oD10Sx3yR8wQtoJTp9CVxA  I also tried Shrimp Tempura which good!  Large shrimps flavorful batter    overall yummy   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw#NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw  And quick pic Miso Soup included rice dish   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw#M3PXRlpbbnuXJSt02OKqZg  Service fast friendly   restaurant little quiet but clean   Bathroom probably cleanest walked into while lol   and incense nice touch   Overall happy try it! Just sure when back truthfully  <EOR> Another Ramen house Vegas sorry say wasn't impressed ramen   didn't ramen main meal but tried some Terri R's   Maybe don't know good bowl ramen is   Maybe just loyal Sora Monta   But thing disappointed Koraku's ramen lacking silky creamy taste   Actually lacking flavor all together  just opinion   Other people may ramen almost no taste   But all wasn't lost visit here   main meal Ground Beef Steak side Mini Menchi Katsu   felt both pretty good     Ground Beef Steak served Hayashi sauce  pretty much Loco Moco minus eggs but eggs this   sauce made way suppose i e  thick somewhat tangy all over place   huge fan end brushing lot sauce side  Other thought meal filling flavorful   more Salisbury steak taste ground beef taste opinion    Mini Menchi Katsu basically two mini hamburger patties  breaded deep fried   Think texture initial taste chicken katsu but ground beef taste to   Wasn't bad all just bad you     The restaurant wasn't busy service great   lot food but again wasn't impressed ramen   But could still see myself coming back other food menu  <EOR> Service good very attentive friendly  decor inviting  wanted give them chance even if reviews weren't good  ordered Miso ramen very disappointed  chashu overcooked miso freshly made choice ingredients just did work out  hope improve perhaps might back  <EOR> Went sister other day tad bit disappointed  just decided stop because going Kuma Snow located next door wanted try ramen see fared against competition  inside restaurant just little bit more spacious Monta ramen 2 tables 4 boothes bar lot more items menu  more variations ramen cuople more appetizers choose which cool see  sister Shouyo ramen 1 2 fried rice combo Hot Volcano ramen w corn butter tamago   ramen looked quite nice but just tasted okay  Now saying ramen bad any means but just simply alright  know volcano ramen said veggies but half bowl veggies intead noodles   broth alright  tasted bit spicy shouyo broth  noodles weren't bad felt kind short but otherwise tasted okay  service fast waitress very nice informative    But returning any time soon? No  honest nothing place want choose over Sora ramen Monta ramen both establishments just couple blocks street one   going step game just bit because sure every other person comes compare them other great ramen places town  <EOR>
