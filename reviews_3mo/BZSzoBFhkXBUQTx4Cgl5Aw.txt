There quite few reviews Coco's Vegas but Coco's particular could find  little place right across MGM little secret  came Christmas morning warmly greeted door manager  He walked table taking note party specially assigning largest most private table us  Immediately sat down before could even comfortable very happy bubbly staff member came greet well  Afterwards probably don't really know server because total 3 greeted periodically came checked see if needed anything additional order but review particular Coco's excellent customer service warm tradition coco's standard trained staff course food  hash potatoes excellent warm  Infact server brought saying some yours already done rest weren't but didn't want sit cold bringing first ok? she brought first  SMART absolutely considerate! When all food arrived enjoyed good hearty meal    The host also sat down recommendations taste best best priced  think Coco's staff worth review stop anyone doesn't really feel some more cold warm buffet want some hot food just sure let them know want when comes off stove   <EOR>
