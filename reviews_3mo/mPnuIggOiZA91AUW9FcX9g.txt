I stuck going restaurant night could tell just looking menu would suck  minimize damage tried pick item off menu kitchen could least screw spaghetti meatballs  Boy wrong  still disaster  tasted cafeteria spaghetti meatballs taste meat sauce terrible slogged through bite bite just eat something  still left half it   The best thing place advertised special steak salad beans fries beer $10  itself isn't best thing best thing ad says The price good  worst tagline ever  Talk inspiring confidence taste food  <EOR> We ate breakfast aside slow people serving clearing tables wasn't bad   I pleasure having club breakfast which included 2 eggs your choice bacon sausage patty then toast   orange juice pretty damn good too    <EOR>
