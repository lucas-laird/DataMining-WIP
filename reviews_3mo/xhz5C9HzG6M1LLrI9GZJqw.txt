Food excellent great value  unassuming taco stand off freeway Downtown delivers goods  horchata little sweet but still drinkable  Service speedy you'll see lot customers hanging out  neighborhood looks sketchy but two police command stations within half mile which keeps order  homeless along boulevard disrupt business   Also taco stand right off Cultural Corridor Cashman Center which means close everything e g  freeway downtown Strip Fremont Experience North Las Vegas casinos    only wish somewhere sit momentarily  <EOR>
