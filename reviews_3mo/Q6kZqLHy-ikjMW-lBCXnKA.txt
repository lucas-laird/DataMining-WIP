This fast food side  sure open box check your meal before walk away  ordered 3 tacos asked corn tortillas subbed flour without telling me  OK  back told ran corn tortillas  could told front  where sweet pickled onions? Maybe ran those too? Over salted carnitas dry chicken chopped tomatoes onions cilantro  <EOR> Finding vegan options airport very challenging  looking all B C terminals Tequileria Grille looked best option because actually used word vegan menu  option getting veggie selection tacos burrito  burrito route better good  better most airport veggie burritos  But negative surprise cooked black beans refried beans  sure why would put whole cooked beans processed and tortured refried beans into same burrito  <EOR> Since getting Mexican food Las Vegas figure would least decent  wrong that  carne asada burrito  seasoning great but meat overcooked dry tough chew  service terrible too  Upon calling order ready asked some salsa  wanted woman told other 2 available ones had  She didn't even give 10 seconds decide started helping next customer  wasn't any line only person  tried attention completing order but she ignored me  Lastly overall rating food service food cost almost double spend most fast casual   In summary Mediocre food = 1 star Bad customer service  = 1 star Overpriced = 1 star  Therefore 2 star rating  <EOR>
