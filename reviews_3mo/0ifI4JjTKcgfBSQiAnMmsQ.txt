The BF always find open late places way back home work excited see Mad Greeks drive thru open    hard even find information online place even existing Yelp listing  did know affiliated Mad Greek Cafe Baker even wasn't much it    what place doesn't website day age?! remember vaguely stopping Baker food being okay though very salty thought nothing favorite spot but do  Man wrong we   We kofta meatball sandwich falafel sandwich spanakopita    Spanakopita filled oddly lightly sweet tasting filling earthy spinach stinky bite feta  reheated tasted burnt long for  Falafel burnt but filling inside just didn't taste homemade wouldn't mattered if properly cooked  Kofta meatballs OK though reservations meatballs looked unappetizing  know when cook ground meat grill white fats ooze it? normally scoop most off grill sure nicely char meat becomes flavor instead grease  let ooze didn't grill patties long enough take off    It long time since BF ordered something bad couldn't eat it  also wasn't cheap made even more disappointing could gotten substantial meal less  Sandwiches $7 each spankopita $3    I don't see staying open very long specially since close other Mediterranean restaurants  <EOR> I really want place  Why? Because love Mad Greek Baker  long line never look menu when turn order falafel  Never anything else     Falafel tahini rice pita small salad     always excellent!!  Went locale last week since outside decor made think food would good Baker locale       The guy said same company same menu  I ordered falafel course  Extra $2 rice fries What?! Ok ordered rice  When meal arrived fries  Good thing didn't send back because those fries best part  Maybe turnover slower but falafel heavy pita light fluffy tahini he gave hummus   I'll give them more try even though visit very disappointing  Maybe they'll act together  place far home but lot closer Baker!! <EOR> The name Mad Greek conjures memories roadies SoCal those many pit stops Baker buy lottery tickets  only stopped Baker location once gyro thought pretty decent when Mad Greek opened Rainbow wife she's SoCal wanted check out  reviews mixed!     ordered gyro burger which most insanely delicious burgers ever had  gyro burger fat burger patty topped serious portion gyro meat lettuce tomatoes Tzatziki sauce  bun cradled burger nicely sandwich drip down your arms juicy  almost big  wife ordered gyro slightly less impressed meal mine  pita seemed slightly stale very little feta much Tzatziki sauce  She also ordered caramel shake which pretty decent but still little underwhelming      would certainly back Mad Greek burgers but if you're looking great gyro need around corner Yassou's  still best gyro town  <EOR>
