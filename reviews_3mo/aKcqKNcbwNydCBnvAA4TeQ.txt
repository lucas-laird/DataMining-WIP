***This review casino only***  After dinner Fremont Street walked down 3rd Street check newly opened Downtown Grand Hotel Casino   such pleasure see downtown area coming alive again   I decided slot club card line quickly   place really nice new look smell new carpeting   All slot machines also new   It's small casino   really can't remember much Lady Luck which used closed many years ago   I did walking tour casino dining areas all very pleasant   played awhile came away $3   Wow big spender  major winner!  The area dark only sign neon sign which says casino   place isn't ablaze lights     I hope back soon try Stewart Ogden   looked very inviting! <EOR> First time Las vegas downtown among all times vegas  definetly cleanest most modern hotel area  Since new hotel apparently clean  interior very chic stylish lobby mob bar casino area  However rooms room improve   The rooms spacious! But bathroom bit weak  shower glass only half way covered dont steamy hot shower shower head water pressure somewhat weak  honestly dont toilet flush its same kind public restroom use which step handle public restroom  know sound weird personal but associate myself using public toilet hotel bathroom    Overall its good location if hanging around downtown area  5 min walk D hotel screen light show  But also prepare noise bikers bar right across hotel  woken morning around 9ish 10 when staying higher floor  <EOR> We stayed first weekend open Nov 1 2   really nice see someone renovated old lady luck did such great job it    The staff ultra friendly room very comfortable size casino although little small size filed all new machines   think paid $109 night weekend line everywhere else around  some BOGO coupons drinks art bar mob bar guest packet tried some new things cheap   Haven't eaten yet but restaurants look some good selections   I think own whole block including triple George pizza rock hell yes good around 3am!      Nothing place seemed cheap halfway done   Looking forward staying few more times   It's nice another upper echelon place stay downtown! <EOR> As local aware goings ons well support local projects   Made point check place even book room first weekend opening   Looking past some glitches expected brand new establishment caliber fully green staff like being assigned room didn't exist some major pros some major cons     Pros interior lay both very well done perfect blend industrial elegance very apropo very chic   staff very friendly engaging there's unique food lounge outlets great exploration   if casino outlets leave wanting more place perfectly situated allow easy access all offerings Freemont Street   Cons disappointment upon arrival no parking garage   Self parking happens personal preference but told self parking going coming available near future      The other more resonating disappointment little game  played room rates   room advertised $49 night upon checking there's $20 resort fee  Really?  Perhaps justified 5 star establishment but if place plans gain any favor locals advertise $69 room knock off resort fee nonsense   Because add then tax each charge individually bringing total $99 check out!  some dickering told resort fee would knocked off only see appear back card   charge *still* being disputed    suggesting $99 outlandish stay Vegas but known would opted stay strip hotel caliber convenience WOULD JUST DRIVEN HOME BECAUSE LIVE HERE! <EOR> Got free room Nina casino hostess very friendly fun knowledgable! Then due play offered few more nights! upgraded room beautiful view! casino equipped latest slots just wished more triple play poker machines!  Staff wonderful warm  Lots dining choices  only draw back little far other hotels gambling variety  <EOR> Beautiful re model former Lady Luck  Didn't stay play drink eat but did use bathroom wash hands  WIN! haha Seriously though look forward coming back wish them much success  love they've done place    Brand new machines beautiful lighting bars restaurants all very nice looking  Attached Mob Bar which really cool looking well but much smaller expected  doors off Ogden look closed should probably fix that  Otherwise place really nice easily best looking casino downtown  <EOR> This brand new hotel part redevelopment downtown Las Vegas DTLV   first stay area must say quite impressed hotel  hotel rooms chic modern though size average  only gripe weak shower  Next time upgraded suites since they're much more  Also avoid rooms facing 3rd street because noise bar across street    The service friendly personable valet restaurants  address food outlets separate review but overall food service excellent  Eggplant Patty Melt Cappuccino Cafe die for! Chinese place Red Lantern surprisingly authentic but pricey   The casino floor small but adequate  all latest games  Overall place more uptown downtown  far best hotel DTLV! <EOR> This review based restaurant Stewart + Ogden really good! wings which sweet glazed sauce just hint spicy  couple coworkers Streak Fries entree which looked really good! large group staff prompt very friendly  can't wait back try other platters! <EOR> Everything hotel new redone  love'n it  haven't downtown years but two night stay comped back willing pay   chic 21st century swank  fact kept original catwalk above casino floor only wished scantly clad women walking above binoculars    Jk  Anyway staff friendly helpful  pit bosses fun engaging  Sure there's few kinks still worked but strongly believe right path  <EOR> This review Art Bar Cute little space long couch comfy chairs   Couldn't find art work until Nick pointed ceiling   Cool!  Too funny but ordered wrong drink Mona Lisa    Imagine surprise when picked warm  thought Medori Creme de Menthe   Oops   So nice little bat but no cocktail waiters small menu  <EOR> Excellent new remodel  old hotel Rooms clean bright TV cool latest features resort fee gets free wifi anywhere hotel plus 2 cups excellent coffee Ogden dining room good  breakfast excellent lunch Cool bathroom fixtures but strange shower only 1 2 door but due low water pressure does floor Valets sure helpful everything ran smooth considering only open 8 days God job! <EOR> Just Las Vegas over weekend saw downtown grand want try luck brand new hotel   Kind disappoint downtown style first no self parking whole parking building cross street valet parking   2nd don't enough people works sure if because brand new   Slot machine old sure if re use slow machine lady luck but compare main street aren't fun play with  <EOR> I stayed lot if casinos Vegas off strip Downtown Grand just put lot properties notice  rooms nice without old vegas downtown smell often associated casinos downtown    The casino new games restaurants good overall atmosphere gives vegas something desperately missing  Outside 3rd street actually feels downtown  Hogs Heifers pizza rocks triple George adds all  <EOR> The development team 3rd Downtown did Old Lady Luck proud revamping property   Downtown Grand Las Vegas great hotel casino offering tons gaming dining options   limits reasonable prices food exceptional   many people know open but sure visitors pick once word gets around   would visit place again   probably free room based previous play   would appreciated     If you're Downtown Las Vegas must visit Downtown Grand Las Vegas! <EOR> My husband comp room just beautiful  still some minor construction building function hiccups should expected property underwent such dramatic transformation but where building let down staff decor picked up  am love place new favorite casino downtown Get ready Binions Boyds Downtown Grand upping ante downtown ready? <EOR> Some people clean well add DG list  place looks great  fresh new clean fun boutique feel it  dining options aren't large but always walk across street TGG PRock  Come think nothing large here  rooms sports book eateries even Art Bar    All tiny spots  However rooms modern A OK when you're only paying $30 60 them  now place empty most time  easily grab video poker spot around bar seat table game  Come enjoy now before everyone staying Fremont finds it!  One gripe    only blackjack table open 2am Monday $25 min  no playing  Egh  <EOR> We stayed Downtown Grand 3 day 2 night stay past Sunday  just Grand Opening Nov  12th probably 2 newest guests  valets friendly bellhops before even car!

From walking property before dinner saw mixture plaza Cosmo decor the lobby bar screams Hipster all art ceiling   casino rather boutique ton machines tables which I'd rather lot low ceiling crammed Fremont St joints    I dined Ogden cafe some friends wasn't impressed  average entrée price $15 but portion quality didn't worth it  Granted always adjusting menu but seemed bit pricey got  decor wonderful atomic furnishings colors!  As open other areas casino review could easily four stars  concept pool upper level picnic area  <EOR> You add DG list hotels cleaned well wake downtown revitalization   What used Lady Luck now totally re modeled boutique style hotel  Plaza Golden Nugget Downtown Grand really illustrates redevelopment downtown moving along nicely  During remodel chose keep alot exposed steel girders brick facades giving casino industrial look  DG nice chic feel definitely didn't cheap hotel rooms  rooms completely updated sleek modern touch them $50 charge its great deal   The casino itself pretty small few bars small restaurants littered throughout  saw prices drinks food very reasonable  looks Downtown Grand relies alot Triple George Grill just outside really satisfy diners  Overall DG great edition Downtown 3rd its nice see DTLV up   Tip Downtown Grand doesn't parking garage valet only  Remember bring your dollars! <EOR> Just returned 2nd stay while happy report some initial birthing pains gone hotel some issues overcome  biggest problem being noise level night especially depending your room location    Pros   * Rooms nicely decorated clean modern!  * Large lap top friendly safe   * Resort fee includes 2 bottles water daily fast WiFi morning coffee tea café    * Bed pillows very comfy!  * Great location!  * Strong security presence something want downtown area!  * Large wall mounted TV retains your last channel volume level!!   Cons   * Noise  Knowing hotels reputation being noisy night specifically asked quiet room away Hogs Heifer's bar  Well dummy failed check room thus wound having change rooms 10 00 pm because H H loud could feel bass reverberating! next room much better but fact supply ear plugs says lot       * Parking  valets attendants tell no dedicated registration parking area thus your options park lot across street use valet services however front desk told could used loading area directly front hotel    * Slot VP machines ads which removed but grows tiresome    * Beverage service still haphazard casino   * Ice machines located every floor  * Insufficient shower water pressure   * During both trips escalators operational issues    Tips   * access west tower without going thru casino via elevator located commissary  <EOR> I tan client impressed nice downtown   street very cute    I say rooms good very inexpensive client telling me   She did say customer service little off but happens when first open trying things going  <EOR> 3 negatives Shower 1 star    no way around this   Poor water flow half glass shower cutting it  Lady Luck elevators still present although covered some faux wood trim  Promotional credits granted even though given Cristina code front desk  Shady   There tons potential 4 star based value  <EOR> Swanky!
