Everyone right great food service cleanliness   absolutely love gelato bar!! <EOR> Pizza far favorite type food but just can't enough Metro! waited anxiously location open since opening day quite few times  While love Metro give them only 4 stars mainly consistency issues     Let talk food first though  far wife I's favorite pizza buffalo chicken  just flat good  chicken blue cheesed mixed onions celery perfect combination  buffalo sauce use great super good buffalo taste its spicy but mild either  other pizzas really good too  usual seafood pizza your standard pepperoni just good pizza!   Appetizers mostly good too  can't talk Metro without bringing bread  When hot fresh hard yourself nearly full bread  garlic knots must try! also really meatball sliders which use garlic knots bun for  If you're mood wings Metro decent wings also  only thing don't much fries  use great spice nuclear fries but fries themselves just aren't quite there    Like mentioned Metro some consistency issues  opening night tell gotten way better since then but still some kinks work out  some great service sometimes pizza doesn't come did last time  Less toppings sauce whatever may be  other thing bothers bread inconsistency  Since love bread much disappointing getting burnt loaf  cold   Metro must try opinion  little expensive side but monthly calendar daily deals great  if during weekday 50% off deal its perfect way try first time  <EOR>
