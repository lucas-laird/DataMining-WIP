Drinks came quick!  Waters drinks refilled even when semi busy Friday night   Food There's lot variety choose but stuck usual    Cravin' Cajun style shrimp comparable Hot N' Juicy's Special Sauce but spicy   Somehow tasty tangy addicting but still very enjoyable  Lemon Pepper shrimp Corn Also comparable Hot N' Juicy but lacked some sort addictive ingredient   MSG?  Heh  Deep Fried Catfish Basket Now where at!  prefer catfish preparation because thin slice fish optimal crunchy breading per fish ratio   tartar sauce served along side perfect!  Extra tart creamy  Deep Fried Oyster Basket Little nuggets juicy deep fried oysters   Yum  Cajun Fries tasty crunchy   Equivalent tastiness when compared Hot N' Juicy but downside soggy sitting own steamy heat   easy solution that Just eat all quickly!
