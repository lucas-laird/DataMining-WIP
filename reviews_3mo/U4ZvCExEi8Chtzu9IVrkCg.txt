Not bad option if you're hungry  flier restaurant under door when back hotel  Given hotel only dining option decided try place  even delivered hotel $3 00 fee which bad given time gas prices   I salad garlic break shrimp scampi pasta chicken noodle soup  salad pretty good garlic bread way oily enough garlic pasta didn't quite enough flavor chicken noodle soup excellent  Given bill around $20 really can't complain least 30% 40% cheaper eating hotel mention much more convenient  sure why guy didn't deliver room tho given asked room number  sure hotel wouldn't noticed if he just came straight room since he wasn't uniform  <EOR>
