Durangos best food  salads favorite  restaurant started St  George Utah just found opened here  other side town where live but am more willing drive 25 minutes there!   I always same thing because good  Small salad which more enough black beans lime rice marinated chicken  put sauce over beans rice some cheese which melts all together  marinated chicken but husband loves sweet pork   Then top off salad guacamole pico de gallo sour cream  spicy tomatillo dressing delicious    Warning place addicting! <EOR> Well found Durangos  put GPS wanted Qdoba where took me  know fact Durango's used Qdoba because eaten before back when Qdoba  really really disappointed because heart set Queso Chicken Burrrito   ANYWAY decided already might well try place out  believe must opened very long ago  First off bit different your Qdobas Chipotles  offer wheat tortillas for extra price! Um don't think Zaba's charges extra if want wheat   menu salads tacos burritos enchiladas  enchiladas because enchilada sauce  also put sauce top burritos wet burritos    I ordered grilled chicken burrito  Here's nice grill chicken meat before put into your burrito  Next offer three types beans two types rice I black beans Spanish rice   Cheese inside top your burrito  IF sauce option top which did not send your burrito through heating device melts cheese top I'm assuming   thought burrito okay nothing spectacular must admit Qdoba Chipotle better taste wise   PROs different more options good if want eat burrito fork  offer small size which HUGE can't even imagine regular looks must size head   CONs really best if want eat your burrito your hands  wrap them foil  Also some reason when ladies front wanted lettuce inside burritos I mine way but employees insisted salad came side burrito pico de gallo  Instead asking put lettuce burrito just let them wanted ended mixing lettuce into burrito own   I don't know    doubt I'd return trip  far away where live  But maybe if opened closer would back try something different enchiladas  <EOR> I happened upon relatively new restaurant while driving another restaurant within same plaza   know Qdoba before but never any Qdoba restaurants   when restaurant intended closed observance Passover decided mental note come try place near future   Fast forward week   walked into mostly empty restaurant decorated if dining outdoor courtyard except indoors   some Mexican themed decorations such hanging dried chilis   Since very first time restaurant didn't realize actually part small national chain being third location Utah can't remember where else    main thing burrito sauce both inside outside called Burrangos   tried describe friends said similiar Cafe Rio Wet Burrito I take word never Cafe Rio    variety meats select I  opted grilled steak which very tender vegetarians grilled vegetables   your choice three different beans two kinds rice tomato base lime rice three sauces mild medium hot medium wasn't really spicy finally cheese   assembled burrito placed conveyor moves along while baking think Quiznos something it    Overall decent burrito presented differently   Just FYI regular size burrito actually large decent size burrito   frequent visit card which assume give something free 10 visits purchases   The staff works friendly did mind explaining menu new customers   always plus   A OK!  Three stars  <EOR> STAY AWAY  creepy 50 something guy working there  He never changes gloves made some disturbing comments friend  gentleman looks misplaced construction worker  Mexican kid right next making tortillas he bullied way into making all orders  He should digging ditches  Also cashier another white guy seemed place  least RIO keeps real workers usually can't understand   Anyway food equally disappointing chain hell  three kinds beans all which looked nasty pinto beans lived hype  Enchilada disaster don't order grilled chicken appears packaged strips thrown grill prior cooking  Prices reasonable  No salsa bar all rice at least Mexican kind very gummy  even Mexican food  across shopping center great falafel  place should close soon but Vegas idiots love chain food probably become hallmark shopping center years come  <EOR> These Burritos Moist     Durangos Mexican Grill resembles few other Mexican establishments town appearance   walkway leading counter where order pick your food handful tables middle dining area self serve soda machine expected decor     The food good   burritos smothered sauce if cheese   definitely knife and fork burritos forget burrito on the go know other joints   I Chicken burrito visit   chicken breast shredded chicken opted shredded   all white meat filling high quality but flavorful   Fresh crisp lettuce great pico de gallo saved day but overall nothing crazy about     The small burrito which perfect lunch only $4 making Durango's perfect quick bite during work day   bigger appetite big burrito enjoy  <EOR>
