I loved place used live around corner would walk stumble back home night drinking     One night decided eat figured Why not? if sick Walgreen's next door walk something settle stomach   or buy pack smokes! eating became place where hubby could meet friends any time night since kitchen 24 hours  fun place greasy food   and fell love Philly Cheesesteaks  don't know but never bad philly cheesesteak  ever  Best all could beer pancakes 3am if wanted  many boast that   wait maybe  something proud of   At any rate breakfasts great too  Hubby could split stuffed french toast breakfast but more often didn't because he didn't want share  HAH!  The last time cousin bit shocked different was   clientele seemed bit older lot more cranky   Maybe just wrong time but wasn't Charlie's Down Under remember getting ripped then stumbling back home 4am   Overall still love place  <EOR>
