As fun Strip out of towners incredibly frustrating locals traffic nightmare epic proportions assuming actually somewhere park still negotiate swarms tourists everywhere turn   Most time just worth if all want quick no fuss meal quiet spot    where Ichabod's comes in   Located kind blah strip mall Ichabod's doesn't look much outside   Actually doesn't look much inside quite dark strips Xmas lights running around walls green plants spilling boxes atop dividers between booths I guess must fake since sunlight rarely penetrates Ichabod's    usually slow servers don't seem all enthusiastic sometimes hard find   The food depressing ambience though   Bloody Marys excellent told soups great well   menu pretty casual diner type stuff lots sandwiches salads   wraps specialty definitely worth trying especially chicken caesar wrap Neptune wrap   Packed meats veggies wrapped inside spinach tomato flavored wraps they're huge tasty   There's some kind salad bar but always afraid its janky appearance though  kind Ichabod's theme    This no means hip trendy place if see other diners all they'll older couples families   But if you're tired touristy throngs just want someplace where walk right seated and pay $12 burger turn dark side try Ichabod's  <EOR>
