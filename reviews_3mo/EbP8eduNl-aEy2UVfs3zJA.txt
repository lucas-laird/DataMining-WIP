The restaurant just opened Encore Wynn Hotel  named Switch because every 30 min its decoration changes   pretty cool watch  just wasn't amazed food very plain  ordered risotto braised red cabbage sausages  service fast  <EOR> I wasn't hating much other reviewers but being relatively lenient few issues due being new!  Decor thought walls ceiling changing every 20 minutes fun  Kind silly but novelty    Food French Crab cocktail just crab meat shelled served chilled some sauces side  Fresh sweet succulent delicious    Lobster salad really tasty wasn't just some goopy mayo mess some others seen  Lots lobster some avocado   nice light dressing  Delish    Bread cold    similar bread serve bouchon but good!  Risoto appears another reviewer didn't love much did  parmesan champagne flavored delish!   Steaks Awesome but several prepartion issues  people ordered their's medium awesome perfectly cooked steaks  people 3 ordered them medium rare all medium well steaks  2 3 ate their's but when 3rd diner asked different steak he some attitude waitress  sorry when steak ordered medium rare significantly more done steaks ordered medium goof somewhere    should replaced no questions asked  steak dull grey brown middle    hint pink   hardly I'd call medium rare!  2 diners ordered steaks rossini style foie gras   tasty course   but tell reviews foie gras freak unless overcooked ruined loving anything foie gras    We ordered sweet potato fries but waitress forgot bring them  She belittled 18 yo sister told oh forgot order them     umm no entire table heard order them nice try though  Oh well didn't try these    I think place some potential  Cool atmosphere yummy steaks when prep them correctly some good seafood starters  Service really needs clean act though  If restaurant open more 2 weeks would definitely give them 2 stars    steak restaurant shouldn't screw cooking steaks! <EOR> I dinner Saturday night party 8 service great everybody enjoy different atmosphere changing every 20 min  ordered lobster salad short ribs which needed NO knife  lived Las Vegas 30 plus years rank top spots try  <EOR> Two MAJOR slipups planning Switch location table spacing     I don't dine looking casino within earshot neighbors   Luckily early dinner staggered parties   Later evening joined lovely blue haired couple Montecito charming but secretly happy crashed party end meal     Otherwise restaurant gorgeous three different backdrops evening OOOOH AHHHH worthy   Seriously dinner show rolled into one   Remember look too   Normally just ala carte menu but NYE special tasting $150 pp   Well worth quality presentation   No amuse 4 courses sorbet dessert no mignardises C1 Lobster bisque w a lobster claw side Excellent huge chunks sweet succulant meat soup robust flavor  C2 Butternut squash ravioli Quite enjoyable sweet usually favorite  C3 Pastry wrapped scallops w slivers truffle Bold adventurous presentation good  C4 Foie topped Filet This baby HUGE but also quite good  Desserts Cannot recollect much both very good but check visuals posted liked fruit more but chocolate rich moist crispy rice texture delicious    We happy surprised find sommelier Restaurant Charlie relocated Switch   pairings spot much more reasonable price  did mention price cap but only additional $75 pp vino     Switch supposed premier restaurant Encore but expecting bit more luxury elegance   Maybe he didn't want another over indulgent restaurant compete Alex? <EOR> Ate last Friday night   very excited b c front desk lady recommended strongly apparently decor changes every 30 mins she claimed servers also changed outfits often but didn't seem happen servers    although did least 2 waiters 2 bus people table    Pros ambiance way restaurant built cool   cool might even add another half star review if yelp allowed it   said see decor outside if really just want see changes happen    Cons Customer service horrible   weren't seated until 30 mins past reservation   Then took them another 10 mins give menu   Then another 20 mins take order   ask bread water which all other tables had   waitress made recommendation then came back say chef couldn't it   switched back forth between waiters no communication which very frustrating   Because waitresses mess sat without food while friend ate dinner finally just ordered salad which mediocre   also tuna tartare appetizer which tasted sitting while   friend ordered pasta black truffles $55 something could easily made home if found black truffles    pile pasta butter salt cream black truffle oil   boring   Expensive get   Service bad food mediocre   did comp anything despite mistakes did even basic niceties saying thank left     My recommendation would just watch decor switch outside don't waste your money mediocre experience  <EOR> got freeload meal last night sadly wasted Switch    Gee another steakhouse just don't really powers to be feel what's needed Strip really ? oh  right let's add gimmick switching walls ceiling every 20 minutes yeah them kinda cool but option opens casino basically front entrance can't believe Mr  Wynn bought into option I'm still laughing server making big deal filet being wet aged 55 days no else ages long ! come 40 days 50 days someone really tell diff  Does fillet need much aging anyways ?!?! hosts fillet 10 ouncer cost $55 18 ounce bone in rib eye almost hanger steak think mine cost $58    went asparagus mushrooms cheesy potatoes some fancy french name escapes sides $14 each even high strip steakhouses ! thank god wasn't flipping bill The jamon serrano salad starter think $16 decent nice chunks Roquefort cheese dressing little oily    we opted dessert choices kinda boring creme brulee molten chocolate cake bananas foster etc   started some sort lychee cocktail wine nothing remarkable    for gonna bother making 2nd visit Switch even another persons dime ! <EOR> Going special dinner friends turns terrible! Where start      1st waited 20 mins someone ask water preference was  drinks day still come! manager finally comes over listen complaint only blow off introducing some wine owner Napa cares!     I always order steak well done  Anywhere go  worst steak! Burnt!  I would never recommend place anyone! If wanna watch walls change grab some food stand outside! <EOR> The stars mostly creative design atmosphere   see restaurant change before your eyes every twenty minutes pretty amazing    obvious alot money invested technology   walls shift ceilings cave form new creations music changes all once   pretty incredible! As food service okay   Service little frazzled disorganized first hard tell server   sommelier difficult locate   like 20 minutes maybe?  when he did come he unhelpful kind condescending would actually consider desire Argentine wine   Still stuck French bust attitude   But customer please least don't pull when just asking suggestion New World wines!   taste   grrr    Anyway Hawaiian ahi tuna poke light flavordul scallops wellington unique very good   did feel little miffed black truffle gnocchi   ordered half portion but still same price   understand am paying truffles but little less pressure would nice   dessert Venezuelan chocolate souffle also good but did blow mind    I would come Switch atmosphere but better places Vegas if foodie  <EOR> Horrible  simply no other way describe NEW restaurant located inside Encore latest addition Wynn family resorts Las Vegas  would say experience rivaled equally repulsive time Gordon Ramsay London Hotel Los Angeles  Let delve deeper  Firstly reservation Switch 7pm  showed dial told seat would available right away  hell point reservation if don't respect live it?  Already becoming annoyed quickly set aflame when table became ready told would able enter restaurant because attire  wearing slacks monogrammed polo shirt  Apparently dress code buttoned collared shirts jackets recommended  perused restaurant behind tyrant hostess saw MANY people wearing far worse myself   I quickly smugly showed hostess rules line apparently someone let others t shirts jeans  god sake man Hawaiian shirt! realizing hostess would hear any more back room change  also gave time cool down!  After being seated took decor restaurant  Switch changes its surroundings every half hour walls rising down some side side even ceiling gets act! dance reveals new different motifs all which rather bland boring   Our waiter evening seemed more accustomed McDonald's fancy restaurant  he showed exactly 3 times entire evening  First take order then drop off food lastly check  guest ordered wine straight away came no less 30 minutes! food risotto scallops came 1 hour 15 minutes waiting! hell takes long two dishes? simply no excuse this  add insult injury food just average!  I managed flag down female manager told experience beginning adventure  true circle wagons fashion she defended hostess said she right stopping entering  again showed others wearing t shirts manager looked blankly said rules were rules   hires people?  I never recommend Switch anyone  horrible place food better prepared campfire children  entire experience shocking utterly disappointing say least  Steve Wynn needs implode restaurant start anew  Caveat Emptor  <EOR> I read previous reviews quite few qualms dining there   But tried all other Encore restaurants thought Why not? Going again during past President's weekend knew might some issues getting reservations made them well advance   made them far advance realized day would late dine husband 8 year old son   Yikes!  some doubt walked hostess 5pm asking change reservation 7pm   and greeted pleasant smile quick answer would pleasure  Awesome!!! Walking everyone hostesses managers servers busers incredibly pleasant made fantastic evening whole family   Some restaurants might turn noses down children fine dining establishment but everyone genuinely pleased in   manager overheard son asking olives martini   She returned quickly two olives just son   fantastic that??!!!  just tip iceburg all evening  Yes agree some earlier reviews food wasn't best there   But still good remember open two months!  Most restaurants never really into stride quickly   good service i'd definitely willing back try again  <EOR> I stopped quick bite   Very pricey everything Vegas but steak wonderful! <EOR> Bar review only I mango mojito here  AMAZING! They put real mango puree drink tastes just mango juice   loved it <EOR> Loved it   rec'd outstanding service food excellent   would given 5 stars but seating could little more spaced intimate   great time Switch  <EOR> It's 3 months since Yelp!  Wow   Happy New Year then some everyone        So going try catch little review few restaurants last 3 months starting Switch Wynn Encore Hotel Vegas   last month chance eat lovely 5 star restaurant   scenery quite beautiful room switched different scenes every 20 minutes   pretty cool see walls come down lighting changed decor changed different French sceneries     The service definitely outstanding 5 star restaurant wouldn't expect any less   Butter fish lobster also ordered caviar   say Caviar AMAZING   delicious could've eaten all night   Everything else good but did equal Caviar   wine good supposed $500 bottle should taste good   desert good powdered donuts w dipping     Overall experience outstanding   Personally wouldn't pay much food but business dinner    would say good dinner except caviar else where less money   Even switcheroo atmosphere wasn't worth money but nice see experience   gotta' try everything once right? <EOR>
