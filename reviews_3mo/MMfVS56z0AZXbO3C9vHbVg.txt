Locations reason chain restaurants such dubious reputation  several times last few years always problem order someone else's  service always slow whether location busy long take pizza? Somehow takes people half hour  least   The first sign place unreliable fact quote lengthy delivery times whether busy day not  75 minutes? bake two pizzas some wings bring them mile home? Forget it  easier place order pick up  should be  would if didn't lose orders routinely  only customer happen them seen other people wait extra 25 minutes when tried pick missing order   The pizzas lacking toppings  sure know skimp meats  hate say good things wings breadsticks but let them bright spot review   Oh offer some coupons your next order if issues during your pickup  But why would want come back?  If absolutely must Pizza Hut find another location  Best choice someplace else period  <EOR>
