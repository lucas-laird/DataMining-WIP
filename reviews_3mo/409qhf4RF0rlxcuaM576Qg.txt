Best idea year!  El Pollo Loco West Las Vegas!  They just opened place PACKED   couldn't help but thinking would wait least 20 minutes food  surprise came less 10!  very very quick   Plenty seating space   Friendly empmloyees come around asking if need anything even come around tray when you're done eating napkins mints toothpics etc   Its fast food restaurant waitresses but really   The food awesome  #7 Grilled Chicken Salad  awesome   mint green dressing roasted corn salad most memorable   My friend Chicken Avacado Wrap he thought good   The drink choices good   Low Calorie Lemonade Minutemaid then also CHERRY COKE!  I'll definately coming back place soon  <EOR> Grand opening today! happy side town  true test order chicken breasts see if them  other locations would strangely run breasts  did forget soda drive thru but when inside tell them gave free flan! drive thru quick long line  Looking forward seeing if keep good job  <EOR> Food hasn't bad   Always hot least   People seem friendly most part   But must say location hasn't holding same standards   consistently forget little things salsa   Also food quality lacking few times today   chicken came over cooked thighs   Still love el pollo but needs improvements  <EOR>
