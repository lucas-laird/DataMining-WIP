I've visited restaurant various occasions  Food's always tasty but service unfriendly below average  Doesn't even matter if you're dressed basketball player Italian designer movie star result always same snobbish atmosphere attitude problem     Last time just few weeks ago guest decided check menu  Several people obstructing menu glass window asked kindly hostess show menu  She threw ironic facial expression then turned back started whispering something colleagues then all looked back chuckled    Felt looking bunch clowns us    stunned funny looking people  Didn't know else just left   Hope your experience better! If pass through initial hurdle and if approved host hostess then guess savor great Italian specialties your mood intact  Good luck! <EOR>
