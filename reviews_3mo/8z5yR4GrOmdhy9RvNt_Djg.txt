My suggestion eating TastyBunz don't come empty stomach   ordered six buns $11 ended eating them all!  end satisfied overly full   TastyBunz seems perfect spot hit couple friends when want snack   Split cost tots try some desserts think more economical spending $11 meal!  I'll sure try sides desserts next visit! <EOR> Amazing food courteous staff all around excellent experience  Follow them around city never cook again!!!! <EOR> bacon dog CRACKIN!!!  me frys tots killer breakfast!!! <EOR> I really excited food truck   concept definitely unique wouldn't bun stuffed mac cheese   staff really nice really sides   truffle tater tots die Frisco garlic fries also great   But buns pretty bland   I came grand opening Costco tried visit every time Costco could try all buns   tried everything except sloppy bun bun stuffed spaghetti which am eager try but they've out   The pork special now called Hot Pig? ok but spicy     Dad's picadilly interesting but very tasty   taco meat some vegetables it   dill bun but couldn't really taste it   Mac cheese bun now McCheesy think mac cheese bun   supposed mushrooms and or truffle bun but could taste either   But second time tried more truffle flavor mac cheese  But think built much head just disappointed end   BBQ rib bun ok   cilantro bun but can't really taste it   The bacon bird bun probably favorite far   Nice bacon flavor very creamy   But again getting much flavor bun   I also tried fries but little overwhelming egg   could finish all   probably stick Frisco fries   The dessert potstickers super sweet   sweet hurt teeth somehow   Unfortunately just can't deal sweetness but only tried smores potstickers which fried pastry potstickers stuffed chocolate covered condensed milk graham crackers  Maybe others less sweet   try all three if order happy ending   Cute   This only food truck encountered anywhere does include tax price   bring change expect lot back   3 buns $6 without tax but $6 49 tax if helps   That being said new truck lot potential   looks changing menu making new items   likely back sloppy bun other menu items  If something strikes fancy definitely re review  <EOR> So initial reaction when heard TastyBunz LITTLE BUNS STUFFED SOMETHING OTHER CHINESE BBQ PORK? DOWN   bun stuffed mac cheese truffles? wouldn't down that  TastyBunz cool concept appreciate work into making each unique buns but falls bit short me    I guess first falls tax separate prices so   1 bun $3 $3 24 3 buns $6 $6 49 6 buns $11 $11 89  litle bit pricey but do? don't accept card some change  buns pretty bite size ratio dough meat somewhat leaning dough side but maybe thats only way cook it?   McCheesy stuffed mac cheese truffles but didn't seem dominant truffle flavor    The bbq rib bun interesting cilantro mixed into dough rib still moist rib tasty but couldn't taste cilantro   The bacon bird probably favorite ones tried reminded chicken bake Costco because nice creamy chicken bacon filling   I haven't sloppy bun spaghetti filled yet because they've always out   arghhhh    The bacon dog $4 something pretty delish split fried heavy garlic aioli sauce   The packaging pretty cool custom sticker seal nice touch  probably visit again sloppy bun try some desserts    Side note if you're big eater then come hungry but starving lol  <EOR> Staffed super friendly people obviously love work TastyBunz arguably most idiosyncratic offerings local food truck market bite sized buns filled variety fillings ranging spiced pork mac n cheese truffles  everything menu enjoyed all especially Tocino slider lumpia  <EOR> Tried big food truck meetup costco today  looked interesting love truffley things truck choice  jalapeno pork bun truffle tots  bun opinion way small price  $3 3 bites  pork filling tasty but spicy  Dough pleasant just worth price  tots tasty but kind greasy truffley all  fancy truffle sauce thousand island  Eeh  Nice people food potential but little disappointed  <EOR> I love concept truck  delicious buns filled variety savory options  folks running truck great also  But execution needs some work opinion  main gripe much dough enough filling  Talk carb loading     My two favorite buns BBQ rib cilantro infused dough BBQ beef bacon bird cheese infused dough creamy bacon chicken filling   hot pig jalapeño infused dough Asian pork decent bit kick McCheezy mushroom dough mushroom truffle mac 'n cheese little bland taste   Without doubt all dough top notch  outsides little crispy interior buns all chewy warm  But again just wanted more meat   The dessert tried Sticky Nanas banana chocolate filled potstickers   If sweet tooth dessert need try! incredibly sweet rich delicious smell bad boys intoxicating  But you'll want brush your teeth afterwards because ton sugar each bite   If you're looking quick bite great food truck hit up  buns aren't cooked order afterall  order your way couple minutes  great if eat run  $12 97 for 4 buns dessert pricey lunch still left little hungry   3 5 Stars <EOR> Hmmm am thinking everyone wrote reviews people's friends? don't understand  tried only because next favorite Snow Ono always down trying new food trucks  truck needs lot work  find truck owners Snow Ono Fukuburger others very friendly  person working friendly all   3 bunz  If truck called Tasty Bunz better really good! BBQ rib cilantro infused dough BBQ beef DRY tasted old even worth calories  bacon bird cheese infused dough creamy bacon chicken filling very little taste creamy  fiance said he could even spot piece bacon  McCheezy mushroom dough mushroom truffle mac 'n cheese hard believe any truffle oil guess expected top notch mac n cheese instead flavorless mac n cheese barely edible  waste $ again  <EOR> Tasty Bunz    YUMMY Bunz     gotta grab some Bunz tonight! Finally try truck strEATS festival other night     What great concept    truck festival  convenient bread meat    same time your typical sandwich     The buns small side    probably 3 bites eat unless big mouth take big bites     Ordered * Lumpia kind family usually meat veggies    all seasoned meat lumpia wrapper    Boy Oh Boy savory juicy tasty!  Didn't need dipping sauce all   * Hot Pig pulled pork jalapenos    expecting 'hotter' but wasn't    still    savory I'd some more  * MacCheesy truffle mac cheese inside bun    sign up!  truffle flavor slight which good I think because truffle strong overpowering    case    could taste mac n cheese savor every bite taste flavors without flavor dominating other  * BBQ Rib little dry dipped lumpia swee sour sauce    I'd still again  The buns soft yummy     again    just love concept   Next time tots    which hear killer    desserts which looked fabulous  <EOR> Their BUNZ surely TASTY!   usually need TastyBunz fix least ONCE WEEK   Yes heard right    once damm week!

I headed down festival early avoid crowds 3 tasty buns mac n cheese pork bbq rib   favorites mac n cheese bbq rib tater tots side   second time truck really dig they're similar Filipino siopao twist   someone taking orders outside truck which helpful instead having someone truck yelling down could speak face to face info menu offerings   Three buns plus more enough tater tots enough fill up  The people friendly food good  that's all say that  Pinoy Power! <EOR> I bit skeptical lukewarm reviews buddies rave ones others but trying always best way find right    The BF tried 3 buns  took while since menu written down but quite organized manner focus what's what    Truffle Mac Cheese good truffle flavor it  apprehensive macaroni but chewy texture  nice surprise pretty tasty   Hot Pig okay but expecting hot pig jalapeno would bit kick    Beef curry good idea however feeling curry very raw tasting  When cook curry don't blend cook well kinda bit sharp  wouldn't again   I texture sticky bread would truffle mac cheese again  think rather small price but type buns Chinatown anywhere else  open trying more truck but don't think would chase around town  frequent food truck fest goer try some more  hit miss though think A OK rating fair  <EOR> two tries same result golf ball sized buns costing $2 each much dough sweetness enough filling   Mac Cheese little cheese little flavor  Hot Pig nothing hot no spice no temperature heat sadly no flavor   pulled pork can't remember name but pulled pork filling ok but again dough much me   I concept service good but all flava sadly there's enough return ! <EOR> I wanting try food truck ever since saw them Vegas STReats  line long  3 buns $6 chose Beef Curry BBQ Rib hot pig  hot pig favorite far little jalapeno kick  beef curry spicy enough bbq rib doughy cooked enough  buns little small but am eager try again  Lumpia really good though perfectly greasy crunchy  <EOR> I'm just going dive right one  really adored Cafe Mocha cake ball  lemon pretty good well  quite enthusiastic bite sized cakes pastries cookies right alley  s'more's potstickers good but then again wouldn't deep fried chocolate goodness?  My coworker shared truffle tots quite delish  quite would order but truffle fanatic  deluxe order topped bacon fried egg  She really enjoyed them but commented The sauce bit over powering  all garlic fries  think creamy sauce slivers garlic did me    Now bet thinking buns when going buns isn't name sake is? buns hmm     frankly say think need work  showed thinking going score some soft fluffy Filipino siopao size softballs cut half mom makes  Image surprise when lift small palm sized muffin top box  even though savory the Bacon Bird coated sweet sticky glaze ?? dough bad little heavy filling flavorful but dry instead creamy  also think needed little more golden brown top  pale Louis Interview Vampire   So all bad jaunt try something new  very least if see them around town pop over some fries cake balls  If could would give 3 5 stars just fact Coke made Cane Sugar Glass Bottles! <EOR>
