We ate dinner Haifa Restaurant April 18th  most probably worst dining experience ever had  group 7  moment seated ignored  asked water three times eventually stand walk over server insist water  then asked lemons water again wait 30 minutes 3 requests them  When meals bought table vegetarian table did meal  meal finally arrived everyone else done meals  asked ketchup again walk across restaurant demand server 30 minutes  server gave lot attitude telling things slow because all food fresh made order  Lemons Ketchup fresh made order?  The food itself mediocre expensive  If want far superior kosher restaurant Las Vegas try Kosher Go   Yuck! <EOR>
