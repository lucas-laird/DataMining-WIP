I did quick search food available food court Monte Carlo caught eye  Chicken fingers  lunch today  break took short walk over ordered meal included 3 tenders fries   The breading chicken tenders tasty little bit sweet  But crunchy would like  chicken though super moist tender  also comes huge basket fries type made freshly cut potatoes skin still on  special sauce dare say? reminds Raising Canes' sauce nice peppery   Overall solid place turn food court when you're looking freshly fried chicken tenders  also sell Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs beer  <EOR> It wasn't worse sausage biscuit ever wasn't all fulling either   would gladly chose McDee's over place again     Eh     all  <EOR>
