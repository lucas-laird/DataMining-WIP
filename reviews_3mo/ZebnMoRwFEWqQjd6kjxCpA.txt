Good ol' Zodie's  When smoking ban into effect bar ditched kitchen mounted GIANT sign bold red print exclaiming SMOKERS WELCOME  admit ban probably good idea  cover statement each own everyone's opinion counts etc  etc  etc  But admire zeal which stood cause  Now decor Zodie's didn't click gourd until very recently  Why? don't know because now just apparent  place scattered zodiac symbols sun catchers wind chimes  lighting changes depending shift  If Jim Pete lights fullest level  But if Charla working she'll turn lights completely off fill joint candle light talk where your sun which planet your     can't ever follow but sure sounds nice  Everyone likes scapegoat when luck run dry yeah? also heard several accounts haunt hangs Zodie's which just adds place's appeal  goofs anyway  guess he wears white T shirt likes play TVs radio  never witnessed but keep hoping   The drinks good 'n strong  prices definitely affordable  did however cringe little when selected Night Life category because every time Zodie's only other people bar other employees  Golden Tee machine if take chance know bartenders stories certainly entertaining   It may everyone but favorite places cocktail  <EOR>
