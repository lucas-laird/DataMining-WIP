Plus haven't Indian food while     new! love trying new places see compared ones always to!   Urban Turban gives very modern feel when first enter restaurant  establishment quite big dining area bar area actually separated which pretty nice  Though would've never thought Urban Turban would Indian restaurant if weren't seeing them yelp and or writings walls  Everything establishment modern     American  nice change typical Indian restaurants though    Aside friend only other party dining area  Therefore service quite prompt very friendly  server gave suggestions order he liked menu  actually appreciate knowledgeable server especially when establishment new  typically means know train employees and feed them course !!  We thoroughly looked menu   they some classics BOTTOMLESS CURRIES  know means! means unlimited curry whoever ordered them  However naan rice included all slurp curry goodness    I ended choosing chicken tikki masala  server gave little warning masala tomatoe based kind gravy  little hesitant cause when say tomatoe based tends tangy side but heck  I really wanted try it  also mentioned food spicy server responded take care that  friend other hand ordered bottomless curries himalayan chicken    The food came quickly which nice  chicken tikki masala did nice gravy texture which did like  don't typically sauces very watery if rice  sauce wasn't tangy all even though could taste hints tomatoe base but sweet  sweetness kind threw off  top bit kick it  enjoy level spice put it   it enough presence but enough say spicy    The chicken curry amazing  Every bite tender juicy  probably favorite part dish  rice very fine    little odd because eating but feels eating it  know perhaps  odd  rice though but sure mix much sauce it  fine rice could easily drown sauce then I'd just eating sauce  naan seems normal me      One thing did notice friend's Himalayan chicken curry watery side  guess just used thicker consistency curry curry little odd me  Maybe  just is! no expert Indian food     guess start disregarding whole review HAHA!  As dessert both paan shot which things many reviews suggested  friend liked shot cause he said all he could taste cream  However definitely cup tea  Yes milk cream type drink then herbal floral note end huge stop sign me  simple cannot consume type flavor  gave rest friend We also few words general manager location  he's told dishes ordered absolutely customize dish your liking such wanting more spicy  Also food Indian food American palette which suppose could consider Urban Turban Indian fusion    I would also just say server amazing service he provided awesome  He very friendly very willing start conversation any point time  really enjoyed time there   Overall decent food  Interesting twist  quality ingredients definitely better some other Indian restaurants had  However price point definitely negative me  chicken tikki masala almost $17 himalayan chicken curry $18   the prices quite steep compared lot other Indian restaurants city  Granted himalayan chicken curry bottomless but rice included    most people know would eat curry rice you'd order MORE rice if want MORE curry  top all dishes made American palette mind     would honestly something more traditional  <EOR> Urban Turban restaurant based off Indian Fusion Bombay Style restaurant Auckland New Zealand don't really know means exactly but food quality little higher your typical Indian buffet dive spot   Coming Bay Area there's lot choices good cheap Indian food especially Silicon Valley  Vegas choices noticeably fewer think higher class Indian food could catch on   However didn't find experience eye opening nor particularly good value  prices stipulations bottomless curries discouraging me  primary stipulation bottomless curry aren't shared naan rice charged if want extra  being said plenty food if don't come starving you'll probably full plate food   One thing quite nice rice  tender non sticky yet dry all  Himalayan Curry  chicken inside curry extremely tender tasted higher quality overall most other Indian food joints  curry itself seemed little watery while menu said spicy couldn't detect much personally  GM did come say if problem he would gladly bring spicier but full point   My friend Chicken Tikka Masala which being curry part bottomless deal which bit bummer still  naan quite good though nothing special mind   I don't really know good value place atmosphere does speak higher level quality but food plate wasn't outstanding especially when compare them typical Indian restaurant  curious see well location price point but now give them barely passing grade  <EOR> Items

mixed feelings based tardiness tablemate previous experiences below average Indian cuisine outside hot spots BC DC just 5 15 when owner operator stopped table Urban Turban explain concept 'tapas' having already perused menu through assistance Yelp pictures restaurant apparently cannot update simple website large order soon crafted server really offering much aside occasional water refill dropping off plates   Located small plaza off Paradise just minute Hard Rock Hotel Casino car Urban Turban sort place wants entering largely benign décor aside whimsical rickshaw sitting beside hostess podium focus seems food moreso scene wide view gleaming kitchen flanked chalkboards revealing number Chef's working diligently plates whose results would unfortunately prove average best   Starting off appetizers before progressing proper plates curries trio free Papadum meal began flavor mostly oil thankfully mango chutney made crisp pastry far more interesting though green 'mint' version flavored much bile overly heated viciously acidic particularly something should strive any sort cuisine   Next served quintet plates quickly covered table some confusion looked upon menu item described Dry Fruit Whole Wheat Bread neither fruit nor nuts evident attest moment simply served wrong thing though server assured indeed correct item   Largely ignoring lack fruit instead using 'whole wheat' Naan scoop first bites duo Pav suffice say unless vegetarian Lamb version shows far superior more traditional take serves little more muddled vegetable mush meant served bread turning attention impressive Paneer Tikka presentation tangy cubes amidst earthy aromatics thankful circumstance Samosa Chat only lightly drizzled green chutney thus allowing augment largely flavorless pocket red version instead   Investing rest appetites bottomless curries featured excellent basmati rice par for the course buttered Naan alongside bowls containing less two ounces protein each only said prices ranging $10 $17 better bet visit many local Indian buffets if merely looking 'fill up' partaking lightly dirty tasting Lamb Masala well overly sweet Buttered Chicken bit credit due owner suggesting seemingly out of place noodles show stopper well tuned aromatics least gives hope kitchen could improve rest recipes time on   Ordering three Paan Shots again saw kitchen offer something balanced refined largely lack traditional Indian desserts led final selection Chocolate Samosas but having experienced similarly underwhelming dessert Nosh Swig just few months prior only said slightly better house made ice cream melted chocolate least helping offset same oily taste marred papadum though $7 95 price tag seemed rather excessive something underwhelming small   Suggested 'urban tapas ' thus seeming purport modern take tradition Urban Turban really only seems shine when sticking simpler plates ingredients really seem no better typical Indian Buffet environment does little wow seems very little reason return let alone support another restaurant import when places Mint seem satisfying locals just fine  <EOR> Came Tuesday night dinner  main entrance large bar just off left  into dining room just ahead   pretty dead lights pretty dim  would've liked if table some lighting   The server came over explained menu  bottomless curries tapas entrees  ordered Mojito features cocktail pretty standard anything special  A complimentary appetizer papadum dropped green red sauce  ordered chicken tikka paneer tikka   Usually tikka lot sauce but items just seemed dipped tikka sauces plated  chicken tikka really good but found paneer tikka very dry  also daal Himalayan curry  Both dishes served naan bastmati rice  Each dish very tasty authentic  did find menu pricey but since bottomless curries guess worth it   back! <EOR> When comes Indian food takes some effort impress indian girl me  But Urban Turban did it! restaurant opening day lunch before crowds began surging  food great every single item ordered  favorite samosa chat because boy good! only but presentation nice well    The downfall came when all items spaced timing  Mind only two other small groups venue time hoping quicker service  Nonetheless food eventually   I love modern ambiance mural well rickshaw front lobby when enter    The price point bit unexpected but most people found reasonable maybe just me  Overalls great place stop quick snack two friends family  <EOR> Stopped Urban Turban daughter lunch    found food excellent service best long while ambience perfect
