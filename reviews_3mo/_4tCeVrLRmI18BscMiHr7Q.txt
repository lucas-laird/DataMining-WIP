I MeetUp group set flat rate meal all didn't look menu see usual prices are  being said LOVED food here! never tried Ethiopian cuisine before but definitely fan now!  The restaurant quite small best location  think family business  service very good especially considering group practically filled entire restaurant  They did coffee ceremony which included roasting fresh coffee beans right front REALLY cool! Apparently believe Ethiopians first discover coffee big deal them  course don't know if ceremony every evening if special request organizer gift bringing much business them  <EOR>
