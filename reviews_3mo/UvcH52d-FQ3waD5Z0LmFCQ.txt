I wouldn't call ramen  U won't see again! couldn't believe ramen plastic cup!? <EOR> Sad  stopped because always good bowl ramen place billed itself the best ramen Las Vegas  Nowhere close that    The Shoyu soup stock beyond ordinary  Tastes Swanson chicken broth soy sauce added it  broth probably better suited udon noodles but Shoyu ramen it    The noodles decent though noodles little thicker  But least noodles fresh don't seem use prepackaged stuff   The chashu  very tender  bit thin side well    The ramen comes big plastic cup  Cup o' Ramen  actually cute idea  walk around ramen your hand    When Vegas couple nights eating decadent heavy meals nice bowl soup always hits spot  Except time  <EOR> Found little ramen place while strolling through Ballys  did some research found brand new based Popular ramen place San Francisco  fiancé ordered spicy miso ramen did disappoint! Broth rich flavorful chasu pork tender  glad found great ramen place right strip  serve sushi curry plates too  Definitely coming back next visit!!!! <EOR> I really change light spot   terms vegas pricing spot very affordable  Ramen puts $8 $9 versus $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!  Please negate previous reviewer commenting plastic cup  Any shops Grand Bazaar going inclined towards tourist someone else quickly passing through   no sense serve ramen big ceramic bowl  Why use reusables bother re cleaning when most people come pit stop continue on? Silverware more ideal if offered full dinner service someone truly meant sit dine hour  don't even think half shops connected water line sink   There eating area but offers very little seating only well suited 2's 4   But come on  wouldn't come dinner  group   healthier Asian on the go    But food pretty good! flavorful  hit spot  Well balanced  Noodles cooked well  pork cooked well  also seaweed salad which good melon soda  Altogether meal $18   Next time vegas I'd definitely hit place again if staying Paris Bally's  Ideal lunch quick bite  sushi looked pretty good too  priced $6 roll also pretty reasonable  <EOR> I wanted quick cheap light bite strip thought place would good   Disappointed everything except service   soup all chicken stock tasted nothing   spicy all could taste heat no flavor   love spicy but spicy flavor heat no flavor all   noodles cooked well tasted fresh but hardly any meat good   Everything served plastic to go soup container which probably practical strip   Anyway point story although place looks cute service good better ramen doctoring your $0 25 package store   price just don't it! <EOR> I ordered spicy ramen very good  food ready less five minutes  took to go still nice hot when finally sat down eat  noodles cooked perfectly ingredients throughout bowl super yummy  can't wait try more things offer menu next time visit! <EOR> Great place if looking snack share meal strip  Cheap strip standard food comparable other ramen restaurants Spring Mountain  spicy miso kick!
