Maybe maybe 808 really overdone   When think seafood think simplicity fresh clean flavors     808 tries WAY many things fails more discriminating customer happy The grilled ono tough rock shrimp risotto heavy cream terrible contrast overly salty fish  thai curry basil sauce overwhelming fish     The roasted filet similar something could order large chain steakhouse   put plainly nothing special temperature incorrect     The appetizers definitely most APPETIZING part meal   Order some wine more aptly priced small plates   deconstructed ahi roll nice subtle flavors creative presentation     The dining room flat BORING  <EOR> If don't seafood come here! only few other choices day even wanted   I just think  crappy waiter should tell before decide your meal  really disappointed    I eat appetizer dinner the risotto because wasn't anything else  okay   I split friend   I think $14 then made pay $5 split charge didn't tell us!! would ordered two things if knew charge going 1 3 meal   Just watch out! really disappointed! many other fabulous place eat Vegas! <EOR> I say 808 waste money   fish came really fishy friend send dish back something else   very expensive some mediocre food server gave terrible service because didnt order wine bring check average up   does place survive? <EOR>
