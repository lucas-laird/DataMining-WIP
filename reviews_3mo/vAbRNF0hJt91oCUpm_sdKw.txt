Don't same mistake     Having eaten Rio past knew mistake when allowed others party talk into eating prior going Penn Teller but hoping best along crowd   should gone first instinct     When both in laws don't anything good say restaurant know bad really bad   Since wasn't mood seafood chicken Caesar   chicken obviously pre cooked basically flavorless   sure dressing supposed certainly wasn't Caesar   far tell mayonnaise bit lemon added   The two guests short ribs hardly ate any dinners describing them having stewed own fat hours   The only guest enjoyed entrée salmon  Which looked overcooked but didn't eat any  For sides carrots risotto   carrots very good risotto gelatinous mass   Perhaps all seafood would all happier but am doubtful   There better choices Vegas seafood this   Staff friendly helpful  <EOR> This place used great years ago but now only so   First off seafood restaurant why half menu filled non seafood items?  Second good seafood restaurant should menu  printed daily list whatever fish fresh   On food   bouillabaisse which wasn't bad   However hoping cioppino which no longer menu was fantastic    Overall food ok but definitely better seafood available Vegas  <EOR>
