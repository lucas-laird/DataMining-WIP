But if place popular bc eats good? Deal know wait pay off     I really thought since closest Sweet Tomato Southwest coupled fact across LVAC would've made restaurant bigger which did not  seems smaller bit cramped even entrance way lot smaller other locations  knows perception place could've affected fact super D duper packed human beings   Food consistent other locations  love Sweet Tomato closest thing Souplantation SD which basically same company   Bussers super nice  server really good picking trays even offered refills  <EOR> I holding breath waiting location open because nice alternative fast food joints area  Most time eaten chain Souplantation San Bernardino Hospitality Lane  food always good just location always kind dump  nice surprise see new location like  restaurant  itself decorated wholesome industrial motif exposed ducts big pictures fields fresh healthy messages across wall    This first location offered outside seating  welcome addition only down side next street  food standard chain plenty all very good  desert don't hit soft serve machine win! <EOR> This new sweet tomatoes location amazing   used old but always crowded loud somewhat dirty   haven't encountered any those problems location   super clean looks great generally less people food service awesome   even patio seating! Something didn't know before also take out   box cashier fill take go   On side note Sunday breakfast every Sunday 9 12 very disappointing  trying time check now wouldn't recommend it   breakfast foods just really blah selection isn't all that  <EOR> This place great don't wrong    but visited place Saturday 2 30pm line half long salad bar counter!  We waited 10 minutes hit register then when did paid    asked if wanted sit 100+ weather!  They ran seats!   So stand around 10 minutes food trays until open spot   Compared Rainbow location Las Vegas place pretty small  bad because food very good    Just didn't wait  would've nice warned person front door before started down salad bar   That only gripe everything else just good last time   We also coupon gotten mail lunch two drinks under $22 tax   I still coming Sweet Tomatoes fresh tossed won ton chicken happiness die for  <EOR> Its time opened area!!  sick driving NW cheapo salad fix   Its great always change menu w different themes every couple weeks  some hit  some miss but there's no other restaurant going such huge dose veggies place   always coupons mail which even better     I always 2 plates when in   specialty mixed salads other where just pile bunch veggies etc   never bother w breads pasta section usually couple soups w turkey chili chicken noodle being faves   Its cool Republic Tea included drinks section too  <EOR> This new location pretty damn spiffy  felt clean prices OK $8 50 lunch   coupon bringing down $6 99 I'd consider going again next time send one    The salad bar seems weird fill then pay  Rest assured come back much like  premade salads pretty gross but fixings DIY salad decent  Nothing premium avocado and pay extra chicken! ripoff!   However pleasantly surprised fun veggies jicama zucchini butternut squash etc all shredded your salad eating pleasure    Fountain drinks pricey $2 49 but did Coke Zero!  I tried bite chicken coconut soup my typical fav Thai restaurants really gross  coworkers cauliflower soup looked equally disgusting    For dessert small bowl sugar free mango coconut mousse  can't fault them tasting REALLY artificial it sugar free all plus cool even offered something without sugar  sundae bar looked pretty great if  your cup tea    In general place carb fest adequate salad bar  might come good intentions eat healthy but careful pizza ice cream baked goods all staring face whole time! <EOR> Nothing great salad Vegas heat!   We love come great salad and more ! always packed during lunch time  buffet style set staffs friendly! pretty good helping find table too!   The variety soups bread cheese sticks mini muffins great compliments salads  also sweets section  Yum!  This place great take young ones! sure enjoy variety foods choose end little soft serve frozen yogurt! I need try place dinner! <EOR> This place weird cafeteria style eatery  Right when walk see salad bar  line fill your plate pre made salad your own  Then pay grab seat  find place odd because type person likes scope buffet before deciding eat first  least let pay then check things out  But grab salad pay then more food seems bizarre process   All food average  Nothing exceptional but few items would eat again  couple pre made salads decent  cornbread chocolate peanut butter chip muffin also good  focaccia decent pastas below average baked potatoes tiny  They've chocolate vanilla soft serve ice cream some toppings mix in  some sort low fat mango mousse which good   The place clean bussers quick pick used plates  family friendly restaurant relatively inexpensive place eat but pales comparison real buffets around town   2 5 Stars <EOR>
