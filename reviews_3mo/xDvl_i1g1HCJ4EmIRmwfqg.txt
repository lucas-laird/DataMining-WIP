I'm exactly sure when location first opened but some co workers recently headed over check Denny's Neonopolis  reality big fan Denny's but thought it'd fun kitschy   The Good  It nicest cleanest Denny's ever in  full bar which seems interesting Denny's but then again Fremont Street sense  can't comment bar because lunch during work week  'Nuff said  The restaurant photo booth  Vegas themed NEAT kind where there's outline your head stand take picture you'll come Elvis hair whatnot  But camera kinda high if you're scrimp 5' 1 shorter camera high  Sadly head didn't reach outline no stool anything that   We all french toast special which cheap $6 7 decent or least french toast was sausage        well won't talk that   waitress told they're opening wedding chapel or already did celebrity wedding already lined February  At least we're already Vegas betting purposes  The Bad  My group seated booth adjacent another booth some artsy geometric bars separator head up  paying bill another co worker turned around booth noticed dude's head literally peering over shoulders through bars  Apparently he looking see if done food  Kinda caught off guard bit      The Ugly  It's still Denny's food  Okay decent but great any means  general group consensus Denny's place end up   Overall  So why four stars?
