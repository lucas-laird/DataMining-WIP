I love place now tried Philly cheesesteak sandwich  Although bit pricey even standards Monte Carlo even more expensive Venetian  just think because if pay much cafeteria style sandwiches food would sit down restaurant but mostly only seen inside food courts Vegas  definately worth price when ate Philly cheesesteak  coudn't even finish whole thing  Though isn't worth Venetian same thing Monte Carlo your fix  <EOR>
