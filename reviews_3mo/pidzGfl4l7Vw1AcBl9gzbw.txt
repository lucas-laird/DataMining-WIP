In N Out Burger Fatburger all other fast food burger joints Las #Vegas  place BOMB ASS chili cheese fries Burgers damn good not charbroiled BK grilled INO but diced RED onions Cheddar Bacon Burger WOW!! I another visit soon since susceptible state mind evaluate any all food items GOOD time visited <EOR> This place kind new  Finally chance check out  those Sonic Burger type places where there's no indoor dining room always  good thing Vegas  always say hot cold windy  case windy    They also walk window which did also outside dining area circular picnic like tables  offer pretty standard American fast food  menu sections burgers chicken sandwiches chicken wings hot dogs few miscellaneous items  case ordered Champ burger cheese combo  think #3  Just standard burger drink fries combo  ordered only person line but very soon group built noticed slight problem  see pictures front  pretty much sidewalk worth space where order  Right behind cars pass through  Now when group started building found self trying find spot stand wait order  just found pretty bad layout because seating area side store pick window front only but window further away seating area  wasn't big deal but just ideal layout       order ready within 5 minutes wasn't much deal       burger seating area  pretty neat sound system where can't really hear anywhere else but area but music kind odd  swear theme music Spice Channel playing  song where there's chanting monks back ground little hip hop drum over it  hell did even find song! Anyway back food       first thing noticed fries  fries more potato wedges KFC but cut regular sized fry  good but didn't ketchup really needed ketchup  burger wasn't great bad but nothing special  tasted Wendy's burger  seemed lot signs chicken wings think should checked those out  bought thought good but nothing would way for  Especially if plan eating there       said windy outside point where put drink wrapper burger keep fries bag  hold them whole time because windy  Can't really speak rest menu but combo ordered good but nothing spectacular       thing found funny though bag  anonymous chicken posse thing bunch chickens saying if if don't 20 pieces wings then can't hang us    Why would chickens want hang people just wings! cannibals? sick disgusting  <EOR> Friend HEY!! REMEMBER RALLY'S!? Yeah? Friend now but called Checkers D I  Boulder Hwy WHAT? No way! *hop car took trip EAST down memory lane*  First thing came mind Cha Ching! Link commercial http www youtube com watch?v=g4lZINjpACE feature=related famous seasoned fries   They use Rally's Vegas back early 90's but young forgot where exactly was   want say Bonanza Pecos somewhere but onno?  Help?  Anyways don't remember burgers being small   Baconzilla something   Two small patties loaded 4puny slice bacon smothered some gooey ooey cheese   Now remember why don't fast food   Patties precooked bin before assemble line just mcD's   Heart attack every bite   But Fries still awesome!  could sworn curly fries before blew Arby's Jack's water but menu anymore   Still Checker's Rally's seasoned fries bomb diggity   Strawberry Shakes good here   Man really all time   Don't know what's gotten into me   wasn't even drunk!  Open 24hrs DON'T drink drive  <EOR> First time ate crazy tried 2 sandwiches fries onion rings angry buffalo wings  wings onion rings highlight though fries weren't bad  seasoning better some big name places but fries arent consistent crispness freshness  Since first trip gone back solely wings ordered them large numbers  benefit doing they're guaranteed 40 wings precooked sitting around under lamp watch them fry 'fresh' batch while waiting drive through  first time two ranches kudos enjoy wings gave told it'd 42 cents each additional packet  last two three times gone didn't receive any ranch despite large orders  sure policy regarding ranch distribution but shouldnt 40 hot wings least 1 little packet? Its also obvious when interacting workers aren't particularly enthusiastic  sandwiches subpar inconsistencies something silly couple ranch packets [2 free order 20 wings then 0 ranch 40 wings + attitude?] irritating  There's also timer inside restaurant trying ensure food doesn't take long when off several times servers would ask pull back re position car awkward little drive through order stop beeping   The angry buffalo sauce favorite cheap wings reason back but much different any other chain restaurant otherwise  <EOR>
