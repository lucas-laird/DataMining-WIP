Its standard Subway  Unfortunately some employees speak barely english which ordering asking questions extremly hard  Now English second language but least able communicate pretty good     lady tends rather rude ignores people and or questions  She sighs lot when ask if she would please Yes always say please thank you! put more dressing sandwich whatever  Literally she sigh's!  Maybe would if work Subway all those americans come order english but dont speak nor understand english    How rude order english! <EOR> An average Subway restaurant people nice quick   Smells wonderful fresh baked bread facility clean  <EOR>
