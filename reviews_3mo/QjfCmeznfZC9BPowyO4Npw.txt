so clean here! can't believe ate jones location! yelp more later    yelling live Thai BBQ! <EOR> I shocked when ate here  location did live quality Thai Original BBQ enjoyed since child living slums Los Angeles  seemed evening relive childhood experience turned into big disappointment   I ordered usual S 2 ribs daydreamed mouth watering goodness come  Once S 2 arrived took carnivorous bite off rib scooped spoonful rice mouth  verdict mediocre  Although ribs cooked perfection ribs tasted funny rice extremely dry  Even sauce side couldn't save poor soul  While can't complain service wish could asked waiter chef having bad day? No doggie bag thank very much  <EOR>
