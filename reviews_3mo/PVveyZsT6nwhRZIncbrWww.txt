My first experience chain Jimboy's Tacos only few months ago when Reno  http www yelp com biz BiPItVGi29qC0E2a2v_u2Q  Courtesy Lena D  informed just opened location Las Vegas NV BF stoked when he heard news!  finally chance check location Charleston   Walking definitely didn't look Jimboy's Tacos encountered Reno   fancy chain restaurant nice tables chairs chain restaurant   menu still same though   Shredded Beef Taco Shredded Beef Quesadilla   BF three Shredded Beef Tacos himself   He just loves shredded beef there!  also tried order Cream filled Churros but out!  sad!  also wanted cup horchata wash lunch down but didn't serve horchata location!  Argh!  disappointment!  They also self serve area hot sauces lemons limes   always appreciate place where stock your own hot sauces     My taco quesadilla good especially all hot sauces   wasn't same without horchata though   felt bit empty when heard churros too   least satisfies cravings Jimboy's Tacos though     Word planning opening another location end year!  Update! 02 04 07 BF Jimboy's Tacos today because he craving bad found CLOSED!  Sale sign posted up! <EOR>
