Lavo new nightclub restaurant located Palazzo creators Tao  opens officially next weekend but appeared some form soft opening weekend    Restaurant trying some sort mediterranean fusion tapas place  All dishes small pricey $7 slider $15ish small tapas sized sih don't offer any entree sized portions  tried kobe burger fries twice baked chicken breaded veal dish  All good standout veal dish  Nothing spectactular  Drinks tasty cost $12 each  Atmosphere seemed trendy but contrived everything vegas! Servers main part dressed crap jeans tennis shoes but perhaps soft opening? ate lounge part cocktail watiresses hot well dressed    Nightclub Even though weren't even open yet officially obviously weren't packed still made through ridiculous fanfare going through 6 bouncer checkpoints into club  guy told You're lucky came now when easy into    once start advertising place going REALLY exclusive! Ok ouch ugly going able once place gets cool    mmmk whatever  Also made bf tuck button down shirt which thought weird    Anyways once into nightclub really didn't feel impressed  think Tryst way better  Although dancefloors seem similar sized Tryst dance all over place   place small cramped outside dance floor think once place fills more dance floor full  rest place all VIP bar area  bar area cramped definitely no room dance if standing anywhere but dance floor  Seemed could annoying   Ok another issue had   theme bathhouse  Kind fun cool theme  HOWEVER sucked decor  all black pretty much  There's bizarre pseudo sexual ugly painting back  There's towel rack handles wall weird pattern  Tao all cool bathtubs everywhere but then build place called freaking bathhouse no such decor   really odd  mean place pretty everything just wasn't blown away  Also there's no outdoor part club part  patio restaurant however no service there! but once into club no stepping outside    Last but least   music  Again Tryst wins out  played lot old songs but fun 70's 80's songs   songs just well old  Nelly's ride Gin Juice Snoop  Just lots songs very tired but classics if sense  play trendy cool music play some Bon Jovi   none cool 10 years ago crap  Tryst nice mix songs moment 80's stuff  DJ needs help    Oh last complaint  line place OUTSIDE  Yes August going wait outside  only waited 5 minutes due aforementioned emptiness but if place ever becomes cool actually gets line would hate waiting outside hour + extreme heat even extreme cold Vegas winter  way waiting outside blows poor planning part  <EOR> Umm staying Palazzo said still pay $20 into club looks hella dead inside??? must crack Mr  Bouncer guy needs stick outta your ass  ain't paying shit!
