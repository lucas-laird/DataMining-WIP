Also tried specialty XO Tan Tan Men which prominent seafood taste very forward nutty sesame taste  ground pork clean fresh ginger finish which worked really well combat savory broth  sure its adherence traditional Tan Tan Men but definitely worth try your ramen rotation  only complaint enough bok choy being expensive ramen @ $11    I say confidently great addition ramen rotation however also  more expensive rest  <EOR> So restaurant 3 times now some things hits others misses   never wait all service always good food came fairly quickly   come conclusion rice bowls very much ikura don stewed pork specific fried rice gotten much better   first time way salty but other two much better could actually taste all flavors   big problem chefs use any form measuring cannot count consistency   two ramen dishes lobster tonkotsu   lobster would great if again salty   Everything else dish done well hope   tonkotsu weird taste   think black garlic oil something whatever unpleasant salty again   new restaurant having growing pains am sure would back again just main feature  give them 3 1 2 stars overall but if just grading rice bowls would 5 <EOR> Ramen review!!!

She asked if first time over menu us   Since busy time thought really great take time when normally would just take your order run   She warned ramen very salty if would okay   Since both food saltier side thought would fine   order miso ramen spicy ramen   say presentation excellent miso ramen   best seen vegas  Sorry did take picture sure already posted   Based presentation even more excited taste it   Initial taste miso ramen tasty spicy ramen really good flavor   Now here's bad news   after 3 4 spoonfuls broth began feel slurping straight salt   Remember am heavy salt kinda person but way much   could eat anymore   told waitress she right salt she recommended hot water add side   Hot water???  don't think should adjust ramen hot water   She told broth way   What!???  don't know why wold salty but whatever  = Because spicy miso tasty might give another try with    hot water side but see   Also broth hot enough   Luke warm   told ask next time if wanted hotter     Overall might another try since seen review being salty   maybe bad day  =    second chance coming soon  <EOR> The place good pinch   garlic Fried Rice ok   don't think would order again   Tonkatsu Ramen good but nothing write home about   I'd prefer Monta Fukumimi   think Shoku gets lot overfow Bachi Burger   would way come but I'd eat again if wait long Bachi burger next door  <EOR> I wasn't huge fan place but think due personal preference food quality   seem Sapporo style ramen much more Hakata style restaurant   going pretend knew all but managed take reading other reviews!  The tonkotsu ramen seemed thing style restaurant did just photo http www yelp com biz_photos shoku ramen ya las vegas?select=AJjAleK3jiM_Ul3J1OFYtA#hHXDCiSoCIocVTIh0C4vjA    also made combo adding half order gyoza photo http www yelp com biz_photos shoku ramen ya las vegas?select=ly3aabFtMZw QKAW0WzOgg#ly3aabFtMZw QKAW0WzOgg      The gyoza good tasted home made ordering again if come back   tonkotsu broth decent but didn't tickle ramen bone   noodles also straight thin kind thicker chewy kind love   pork good char grilled flavor enjoyed see myself getting additional pieces   I'm area very often but outside Bachi Burger would other choice lunch dinner at  <EOR>
