Yes please! all ordered fried eggplant duck crispy chicken honey glazed wings Singapore noodles all which quick come but also very delicious  especially loved fried eggplant because seasoned perfectly just slightly crispy outside cut into manageable wedges  tasted french fries but better because healthier! also great place waitress very courteous attentive needs she even took all dishes wanted to go back packaged them us  no complaints really only reason held back giving five stars tastebuds weren't completely blown away honest aren't many places done me  Don't wrong though still very satisfying meal I'd gladly come back try some more sushi! <EOR> Stopped quick dinner  Sushi Combo 2 $18 spicy tuna roll  Felt just alright nothing terrible but wouldn't want order again  service great though  <EOR> The Garlic Basil Eggplant die ! The tempura very good well nice crunchy oily  also slices raw snapper jalapeño lobster sushi roll both unimpressive  Overall really restaurant atmosphere definitely back try other dishes  <EOR> I'm little baffled place named seafood fairly lackluster reviews sushi seafood items  Others complained pricing but most rolls average $12 less didn't feel anything inappropriate     wholeheartedly agree Reggie GARLIC BASIL EGGPLANT dish die for! Awesome takeout option Meatless Monday just when you're craving something lighter contains several cloves garlic crispy texture high flavor  $10 gets portion rice easily two meals  <EOR>
