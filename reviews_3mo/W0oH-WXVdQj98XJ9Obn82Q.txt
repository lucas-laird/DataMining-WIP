My expectations Fridays pretty low because chain restaurant   don't expecting best meal life   mainly expecting food poisoning   reality guess expectations met   I however expect least semi decent service   saying take order immediately close menu however don't think unreasonable expectation want Waiter take order during first half hour restaurant   especially true when middle afternoon Sunday restaurant hardly its busiest    In addition expecting order arrive time would also nice if Waiter didn't practically throw plate food me   Maybe expect much?  maybe just bitter because left all money slot machine outside door? <EOR> TGIF sucks  why did come here? Because really good breakfast deal $3 99   group 10 guys  All worn bachelor party  Five first  quickly seated  next 5 showed soon sat down    We sat over 5 minutes no server  place dead hardly any customers  Workers running about  came serve us  bud asked lady service  attitude she said she'll send someone  wait    no comes    We leave  guess TGIF LV same LA  Horrible  Ping Pang Pong instead some decent Chinese food  <EOR>
