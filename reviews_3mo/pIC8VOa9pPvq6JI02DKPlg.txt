I'm fan place   Keep mind am telecommuter perspective somebody comes cafe primarily work while enjoying some tasty beverages maybe some food   I haven't eaten yet can't comment food   coffee passable   I've only tried iced blended drinks happens only hot days   drank whole thing wasn't bad anything just kind meh   The real problem atmosphere   first time came music really lame easy listening music   asked if could change said no   second time came generic southwest spanish station music   kind sad because paying Sirius basically infinite options   Lastly comfortable couches set front big screen TV which just weird coffee shop   Last time came employee maybe owner? sat front TV watched first sitcoms then soaps both very loud volume   found pretty distracting annoying   Maybe other people atmosphere but watch TV home   Whether cafe social reasons work reasons find TV really distracting obnoxious   The wifi free which nice   no pressure order something every hour keep internet going unlike Madhouse Cafe    But I'd much rather spend money time Baguette Cafe   just more telecommuter friendly opinion  <EOR> I stopped two three months ago meaning come back try something else  But every time lunch always end going somewhere else  does tell you? Well tells many more enticing options  place ok just good enough come back   The place nice comfortable spacious modern furniture mix seating options  couches tables pub height tables  seems would cool place hang but unfortunately don't enough free time just hang coffee shop sandwich shop   So sammie called Mandalay Bay $7   version Capriotti's Bobbie    Thanksgiving bun  Well version wasn't good Bobbie  smaller used sliced turkey instead pulled roasted turkey  stuffing cranberry sauce good though  bread decent but little crunchy side  side some excellent pasta salad which bits sausage salami tomatoes it   The staff all nice friendly  atmosphere comfortable  But ultimately food didn't impress enough come back   2 5 stars <EOR>
