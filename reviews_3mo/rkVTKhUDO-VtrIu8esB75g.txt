New food court Caesar's  veggie fried rice chicken  Typical fried rice corn peas carrots cashews little egg  $3 extra did lot chicken but pieces did good  Overall good flavor  also made order which bonus vs  sitting hot pan under heating lamp  noodles probably way but doing stupid detox yes Vegas! no gluten  <EOR> Considering just food court Chinese actually very impressed  Granted price much higher would expect food court    I General Tso's chicken very good  works better all white meat but sauce sauteed onions delicious  <EOR> I ordered cold noodle ramen  9 99 only came egg cucumbers   it   There's no sauce noodles overcooked   Terribly disappointed  <EOR> Its worse Ramen ever but wasn't greatest food court food  One most expensive food court dishes ever paid though  2 Shoyu Ramen bowls seaweed Costed $40  Overall atmosphere nice cashiers friendly   Would come back? No  <EOR> After arriving wanted something Asian hearty quick  appeared only option Caesars food court This salty Ramen although edible best  did buttery taste but really wasn't very good! guess shouldn't expect much however  disappointment when pay $12 sodium infested bowl noodles lacks flavour! Perhaps wouldn't bad meal polishing off 10 15 drinks busy evening mates but would recommend lunch  gasping dog summer water few hours later! Plus came virtually no vegetables only two paper thin slices meat! There's better options folks! Try something else food court! <EOR> I nothing better say whole last reported Phillips Seafood   Same Forum Food Court same new modern decor same crowded messy restroom same high prices   But while Spicy Tuna Roll ordered very disappointing cold rice laden pre packaged sushi roll  no different would find most supermarkets  my entree Chicken Lo Mein tasty ample portion White Green Onions celery carrots Bok Choy Lo Mein Noodles moist morsels white meat chicken  <EOR>
