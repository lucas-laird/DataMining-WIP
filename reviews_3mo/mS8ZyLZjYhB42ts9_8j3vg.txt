I Saturday around 6 PM 45 minutes four people party  basically fast service    The food pretty good O'aces Sampler lot food  Food prices decent most meals $10 $13  Also accept Restaurant com coupons    Service great because weren't busy food good  <EOR> We've O'Aces both Rainbow Decatur really liked both more decent food low prices   Tonight met husband quick bite Rainbow venue   no longer any Restaurant com coupons but knew served till late prices reasonable   both wanted Asian Chicken Salad    It little past 9 p m  entered find bar completely empty strange gambling joint   walked past restaurant area where soul survived   should omen   Imagine shock when waitress handed menu said Angelina's Kitchen  hell Angelina why she hanging O'Aces?  Sadly O'Aces no more far food goes   No more Asian Chicken Salad big enough feed half China   anything else remotely reminiscent O'Aces old   Italian   Italian wannabe   could tell because pretty smart   Angelina Italian name    where resemblance ends   I hard time deciding order mainly because wasn't prepared Italian food   ever known say no good Italian food but just kinda feeling     Hubby ordered Greek Salad chicken he must feeling    Nothing but nothing appealing settled just sub hoagie hero grinder whatever heck call Vegas where everyone comes somewhere else   Roast beef   pointed while ordered waitress saw point   She also agreed substitute provolonefor white American cheese   What seemed eternity later she came bearing two plates said careful plates VERY hot  thought strange why would Greek salad roast beef sub hot?  She put plate down front stared huge mound brown glop   hell it????  then realized she brought HOT barbecued roast beef LEFT side menu   guess she dyslexic whatever call people SEE things left even though they're looking right   never did find why Greek salad also hot plate though DH did despite fact chicken looked straight fridge plate without chance breathe    The waitress apologized profusely much admitted mistake   While she changing order occupied myself those Wet Naps always carry casinos trying vain scrub barbecue sauce off fingers   Just little bit hand accidentally because just much oozing all over plate stickiest bbq sauce ever encountered   must enough sugar send diabetic into coma   I should cut losses right there   She brought cold roast beef prov sub then learned reason all sauce hot one disguise taste roast beef which arguably worst ever encountered life   no taste roast beef just salt sour   SOUR   roll soft sub roll should very white completely tasteless   eighty sixed roast beef provolone tomato sandwich half doughboy roll   cross cut fries which she menu called CRISS cut okay   Apparently Angelina now home every restaurants formerly known O'Aces  Though bar still called that  really two if count husband stay home   All better devote time writing witty snappy reviews good restaurants deserve them  <EOR>
