Revamped buffet Excalibur!  really really liked changes   New decor kiosk queuing attentive staff great food choices   no Wynn but quality lot better before   The price right point! <EOR> My family decided last dinner Vegas intrigued buffet renovation  new interior design fresh modern way more appealing old buffet  even ditched old Round Table Buffet name The Buffet Excalibur  inside pretty nice layout basically just straight line stations where food standard buffet cuisines including Asian Italian Latin carvery has various cuts meats salads seafood even bar! desserts station located near entrance can't miss it   The food selection decent but able see everything within 2 rounds getting food  seafood selection nice since shrimps crawfish crab legs  thing note shrimp fully peeled unlike some other buffets  seafood paella also hard eat because shrimp still shell head! sushi selection consists California rolls without masago vegetable rolls think spicy tuna  sushi above average compared other buffets    High lights found salmon crab legs made order crepes dessert station  nutella strawberries blueberries raspberries pineapples powdered sugar along your crepe! only downer crepe crispy would but  deal breaker me  also your crab legs steamed but generally line just warned    There bar station located free champagne mimosas along your meal  All other drinks cost additional money    Overall I'd say guys should give place try if going buffets  isn't best but also isn't worse  believe much better used be  <EOR> Buffet recently open renovation husband thinking should pretty good    wrong  arrived 8 30 am thought Saturday brunch offering champs nope  Price $21 95 but Monday Friday $18 95   same food why increase? Fiesta Henderson champs better food $8 99 Sat Sun but wanted try something thought going upgrade    lol joke     Food everything tried looked tasted food leftover day before reheated    Shrimps all water logged crab legs brownish color them odd taste    Pastries none  all offerings donuts  did fresh crepe bar but then again looked very dry  didn't want stand line crepe paper    Overall rating star because no choice  <EOR> I spot before refurbishment but just OK  curious myVegas game advertised re opening relentlessly  typically more popular buffet locations Wynn Caesar's Cosmopolitan Bellagio interesting experience    We very surprised wait    considering probably only 4 5 parties front us  queuing didn't seem work well  seemed all pushed use kiosks but then stuck queue waiting seated  actually no line queue pay cashier  wished through cashier instead could seated quicker  eventually noticed inefficiency allowed people move cashier line everyone would through seated quicker  then caused back cashier line people wanted pay    almost entertaining if wasn't frustrating  Maybe whole system would run better if busier both lines filled didn't feel better option available line hop to      Things thought notable self served beverage island special water dispenser    3 types flavored water well ultra filtered water tasted really good  Although made to order pasta option    pasta shrimp buffet line good  Probably best thing there  decor modern location seemed pretty clean   Desserts just OK  made to order crepe station excited but when asked Nutella they showcased 2 huge buckets Nutella display watered down runny could just squeeze plastic bottle  didn't think could ever ruin Nutella but buffet found way  Also husband really looking forward hand dipped ice cream station    couldn't even find asked someone show us  ended working evening why passed multiple times  hand dipped ice cream bars just small bowls melted ice cream stick bowl  Maybe no attendant work station? sure but husband disappointed   When visit Vegas look forward and am willing pay top notch dining experiences probably return buffet  being said believe affordable option buffet experience  trouble rating between 2 3 stars but 3 believe buffet priced its quality when compared other buffets strip  <EOR> Honestly expected much much more las vegas buffet  NYE 10 more dollars usual  worth vegetarian  only handful veggie options  would havw appreciated beans latino section   News flash excalibur buffet good food lot more just meat  commend tasty cheese ravioli  desert bar amazing  even sugar free section some options including carrot cake better! <EOR> Hometown buffet better  place gross limited food selection  your own beverage hometown  las vegas buffet does this? <EOR> I MyVegas BOGO lunch buffet deal  renovations looks better previous buffet  empty during lunch time  plenty soda self serve stations  different stations Asian salad carving Italian etc  enjoyed chicken salad baked fried chicken wings mash potatoes w gravy  waited dinner 4pm carving station roast beef short ribs shrimp crab legs mussels  Everything else reminds Hometown Buffet  <EOR> I staying Excalibur decided try buffet first time since renovation  wasn't expecting much reading some reviews but pleasantly surprised experience  paid $26 99 dinner Saturday night which bad compared most buffets strip  Fresh food really  nice atmosphere  especially love made order crepes <EOR> Was end January 2015 couple hours killl between check leaving airport buffet looked nice remodeling tried it  3 30pm lunch price already switching over dinner food which initally frustrating almost nothing actual line choose but soon enough dinner food brought fortunately because very few redeeming things buffet crab legs which only put dinner  cold snow crab peeled other places whole but useless cut each help open them mysterious way  crab legs watery nearly good one's bellagio buffet but good enough ate 2 plates full them much else  husband ask random cook behind line melted butter because put hiding what?   actually love drinks self serve if want orange pop once then milk then water I'd rather myself judged waiter person being beverage weirdo  wish all buffets self serve drink station   Anyway rest food pretty terrible mashed potatoes atrocious label don't give easily favorite hard screw foods but seriously almost spit tiny bite took  ugh! husband tried roast beef carvery said pretty bad he crepe dessert station loved though  wasn't impressed desserts but did appear some sugar free pies stuff if you're into sort thing  Overall probably back unless Im planning just loading crab legs am unable better place them  ok way kill some time last minute crab fix before going home all  <EOR> SHOCK AWE!
