I think BEST fast food Mexican restaurant Vegas  far best customer service  food isn't greasy oily other restaurants  love fish tacos breakfast burritos  <EOR> I agree last review  Best Authentic Mexican food town  eaten ton Mexican Food places town wouldn't expect such great place gas station but delicious!  Food taste fresh greasy  staff always SUPER nice accommodating  lot Mexican food places town tend feel really dirty inside Chile Verde all that  always really clean  prices right line would pay don tortaco faustos but tell right now food WAY better  <EOR> Don't let fact place gas station fool you   Extremely clean food fresh good!  Nachos amazing   main guy works fast nice  <EOR> I love Mexican food dishes  GF daughter don't care much though  end result don't enjoy Mexican food often but found perfect loophole    I just say hey sweetie car dirty needs full wash inside gives least 20 minutes drop off car gas station full service car wash detail and fuel up  Once done head inside place order some best top notch Mexican food side Vegas   Being Gringo normally ground beef tacos don't shredded beef ones but shredded beef perfectly seasoned grilled ordered Iron Flat top  throw onions peppers grill fuses all flavors together meat  Simply stated its delicious   The enchiladas sauce damn good well  Probably 2nd Vegas  hole wall dive place south Vegas beats them opinion but  it     Only downside place its express shares space gas station  Seating parking minimal especially weekends when everyone getting car wash fuel but paying full service car wash your car hands least 20 mins plenty time your food cooked consumed before leaving near spotless vehicle   It may seem weird gas station taco but trust its worth it! <EOR>
