Went late dinner  atmosphere stylish cool looking while lounge couches little tables may look hip super annoying try eat at  tables low you're practically bending over waste eat   The food great  upscale hipster Mexican food  service terrible    First asked glass wine some water brought partner's drink but mine  When asked another waitress waitress came behind kind snarky it  Um fault don't rude   Second cousin ordered glass sangria only terrible charged $14 instead $6 menu says  When she questioned waitress she super rude it  end manager adjusted price but left negative impression both us   Terrible service  Food good though  <EOR> Went other night! let say Vegas Local place now new Favorite! pretty waitresses tequila bar said over 60 different Tequilas!!!!! If only could try all them still standing hahaha  The food amazing tried Ahi Tuna Tacos Chicken nachos both full flavor reasonably priced compared other vegas restaurants   As service awesome!  said really pretty girl servers cocktail dresses super nice order quick correct made whole experience bar very pleasant!   Another thing bar located just inside Golden Nugget Shark aquarium pool away casino atmosphere booth looking towards pool! I give place 5 stars! <EOR> I liked it  Sat bar which couple seats immediately available which great  bartender more guide explaining when restaurant opened different options  really turned weekend's experiences around pretty bad food Downtown weekend    Chicken tortilla soup really good  asked no cheese but still came some  didn't ruin though  Margaritas good too  <EOR> Came back strip eat hotel husband wanted Mexican food  Service awful  waitress could careless guest unless your single guy guys  ordered torta she said came rice beans did not  mention tasted awful couldn't even eat it  Ten bucks nothing  order chips salsa gauc nine bucks ya worth it  husbands buger fine but he upset unhappy he didn't want eat  Over all wouldnt recommend unless bad service hey if your single man wants fourty your old woman give lot attention  <EOR> Can people stop bringing kids bars? real gaggle 5 girls under age 13 GIANT baby stroller baby crawling seats bar when Ife A  dinner 6 13 14  Unfortunately came seated already here   So let just way sports bar few actual tables seating more night club NO place kids  don't care if 7 PM your kids bar  bar owners let kids into place  Some places aren't kid friendly your customers don't want surrounded gaggle kids    This place loud scream conversation because TVs line perimeter place  Food just whatever  tortilla soup Ife some sort expensive enchiladas she said weren't good  soup fine but simply bowl soup $7    There's no chips no extras whatsoever which find strange bar  Chips salsa $4  Don't want eat salty foods thirsty you'll buy more drinks? Am only heard tactic food industry? Ugh   I told Ife felt eating couch because hold your food your lap awkwardly eat over coffee table   The fact parade kids place totally turned off coming again  <EOR> This place beautifully put together   for most part!  Lounge seating very neat but few extra pillows your back may needed   The service great! Bartender really trying keep but waitress checking often   The huarache delicious! Great masa just enough beans beautiful presentation   side sauce excellent   selection drinks appealing   strawberry margarita very refreshing tasty   Excited back more friends! <EOR> This place must if area  Great mexican food  Plus great drinks  If sports put whatever game want on  Great place kick back recover  <EOR> Stopped quick bite eat before show going to   chicken nachos ahi ahi tachos  Tacos good but real small pricey  Nachos pathetic worth money   Service wasnt great sat bar even though its small hardly seen bartender  <EOR> This restaurant actually pretty good being casino  loved loungey type feel place couches  Yes some people said kind funky trying eat but bad!! Tons TV's watch sports yummy mojito tons tequila obviously   chips guac chicken quesadillas wow kick them! But very good hit spot pool all day  server okay  best but bad either  Price little high but expected Vegas   But all all think great place come your buds no kids watch game some drinks apps  Glad Golden Nugget now! <EOR> The food AMAZING! much better most other places Vegas   really nice drinks huge selection tequila if thats your thing   but queso best ever!! <EOR> This place really pretty good  remember americanized mexican food casino but pretty good job  Margaritas very good nachos great offer o to go window  would hesitate all stop next trip  <EOR> I stopped some friends before seeing show Golden Nugget   during week noticed happy hour menu Monday Friday 4 7pm 11pm 2am  dining area very clean great view Nugget pool area   also tv's galore around restaurant     They some great happy hour specials $4 margaritas deals some appetizers   decided share chips queso   Delicious!  queso creamy tasty   I'd definitely back more    also split chicken quesadilla   smaller but pack full chicken    Again great flavor spicy salsa side     Service ok   waitress could come over check few more times   realize bit busy happy hour but when eating something spicy your drink tends run quickly!    I wish regular tables dine at    seated lounge benches coffee table height dining table   just bit awkward times eat that     Otherwise shabby great location  <EOR>
