This Johnny Rockets restaurant located Venetian Hotel Casino's Food Court Mall area   I always fan Johnny Rockets themed restaurants  Although restaurant different way only only order sit counter served pleasant wait staff  thing should noted if sit counter always visible any all wait staff    kinda' nice!  I would imagine if restaurant busy may frustrated long wait get   But think rest assured quality food same other Johnny Rockets restaurants   During visit restaurant many seats available sit at    the wait staff quick say hello take drink orders   ordered Patty Melt Onion Rings Iced Tea   my food par other Johnny Rockets restaurants   food service excellent!  My bill came almost $16 tip which believe slightly higher normal  Johnny Rockets restaurant's higher pricing probably due location Venetian   But nice know quality same each different locations   Four Yelp Stars! p <EOR> Here's suggestion if your restaurant dead there's someone waiting place order u tell staff tend them instead performig unenthused dance routine nobody   Poor prioritizing!! <EOR>
