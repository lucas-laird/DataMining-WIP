I super excited when opened because closest KFC Mountain's Edge Durango    I gave them 2 stars because first impression good  cashier very nice however when order 4 cups barely anything there! Good thing checked before leaving  literally 5 small wedges each cup! When requested cashier put more she called manager  manager told normally fill cups certain line  He nice enough put more he added couple chicken n wedges each lol wth   said whenever other KFC locations all fill cups    My advice always check your order before leaving   Hopefully they'll better time though  post update review  <EOR> Had issue order phone number receipt directly linked store   Therefore still unresolved issue no answers phone number receipt   placed order when home ordered  <EOR> I excited KFC area  first visit took FOREVER food did taste good when home  Maybe need some time established might try again  now back Durango us  <EOR> I ordered $5 Fill Two Piece Drumstick Thigh Two pieces fried chicken larger mashed potatoes biscuit medium drink chocolate chip cookie just $5 plus tax I received 1 chicken breast Regular mac cheese Biscuit  Medium drink Chocolate chip cookie  It would 3 star review if order right  <EOR> Seriously enough enough   I now place 4 times last time LAST time! Every single time gone location only 2 things rely on    1 service crappy 2 portions cheap small  Do people think constantly shorting people portions they're paying somehow saving money?? may save 20 30 cents but pissing off driving away regular repeat customers  Brilliant   It s pity  enjoy KFC's product psyched close house but sucks always home see you've short changed   EVERY SINGLE TIME!  No mas me    1 star  <EOR> Went time family meal $20  When home no cole slaw gravy potatoes  drove back explained happened asked lady Esmeralda if could extra gravy troubles  She scoffed said no $1 30  opposed paying but grossed lack any customer service  <EOR> Ive location twice  Both times bad! last visit  my son ordered $5 fill football game he hungry   got 1 drum stick small wing  Suppose 2 drumsticks it   The phone number receipt 281 569 4640 website says 281 561 4640   nobody answers   why Texas phone number?? business Las VEGAS!! used debit card   they charged 39 Cent fee it  and could used charge free    but didn't ask me!
