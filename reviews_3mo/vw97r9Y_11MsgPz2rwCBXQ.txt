Years ago Egypt man told someone gave bad eyes  figure he's talking glasses     nodded explained yes them Dad   No    BAD eyes   glasses?  No  Someone made sick  tummy sick  Ohwait! Yes some guy pyramids put evil eye me  host nodded satisfaction    If only I'd eaten Ibo's first would never happened  During dinner Mr Ibo gave little evil eye protection bracelet    If I'd never found front door I'd luck too  We drove around bit figure still figured wrongly  My guest ordered mezze platter which some delicious baba ganoush some decent stuffed grape leaves wonderful eggplant salad some other tasty bits    We mixed grill deliciously seasoned chicken lamb beef lovely orange pilaf   None food totally blew away  All very good  But prices spendy lunch prices ridiculously spendy meaning any different dinner  The average entree $20 average appetizer $9  interior restaurant bigger probably fancier should called for    If place more reasonably priced I'd loved it  But price point other options you're far off places Rosemary's offer better value   I want see city more independent restaurants offerings other sushi bar food Italian Thai  want see innovative ethnic restaurants thrives  But sure if Ibo's right mix happen even though hope he does  <EOR>
