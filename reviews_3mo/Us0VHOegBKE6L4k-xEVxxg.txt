The same olé Buldogis all know love!  We ordered some favorites such Banh Mi Dog Euro Special Fries   toppings taste you'd expect   excellent!  The only difference price   Most everything solid $7 which little less buck more brick mortar shop factoring sales tax    Well worth considering convenience truck   If see truck nearby worth stop!  Some best food truck goodies you'll find <EOR> Honest God probably best hot dog ever had  said no expert when comes gourmet hot dogs but Buldogis served very VERY good one  definitely keep eyes peeled truck future <EOR>
