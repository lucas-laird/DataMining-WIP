This super close work decided pop lunch  never Port Subs before   I small 5 inch sandwich limited time special sandwich bacon turkey provolone avocado  usual toppings elect have lettuce tomato red onion  olives etc  also oil vinegar mayo mustard salt pepper dried oregano too    I meal drink chips $8 some change    The sandwich fresh sliced meats but made significant difference any other deli sliced sandwich shops  veggie toppings weren't fresh  no lid mayo mustard salads mac potato tuna salad which build crust where oxidized  Overall sandwich just okay   For price especially since Subway across street don't know business  only during prime lunch time to go order  least subway $5 footlong sliced turkey sandwich half left later  Same taste but more sauce bread topping selections better price  Guess where going next work lunch sandwich? <EOR> I love Port Subs  fell love tasting smoky cheddar  cheese creamy bit sharp full flavor  didn't eat much before vegetarian but rocking veggie subs since time   This location 2 locations nearest home  location typically clean but occasionally some sketch characters hanging around location  Maybe its because Wal Mart next store   and seen fair share  People Wal Mart website know usually sketch characters shopping P   Back unfortunately acronym ed POS   I really enjoy woman seems always working maybe she owner??   She super friendly does skip veggies  When order veggie sandwich would assume sandwich shops wouldn't skimp veggies well some but one  favorite part any POS sandwich cheese  really good cheese  fave smoky cheddar as previously mentioned but  really does deserve another shout out close second provolone  cheese no exception  Each every delicious slice laid upon fresh bread little piece heaven soon enjoyed taste buds  Ok now am hungry    I only 2 concerns Port Subs   1 close super early 7pm 8pm depending if they've dinner rush 2 accept Port Subs loyalty card  Ugh! no fun all  <EOR>
