Negihama roll double rice needed  Kiss Fire roll swimming much spicy vinegar sauce made roll fall apart flavor just sauce  Spider roll lots crab salad inside fried softshell crab warm crunchy  Alaska roll Tiger roll just expected    Bottom line average sushi crazy prices  Service trying hard but prices water glasses should sit empty  <EOR> My wife Grandaughter eat Sushi several times month  decided try Sushi Loco  ordered 2 pieces Salman all  fish no taste all  paid bill return <EOR> Not quality food service expected  place half full struggling  Waited 6 weeks try maybe better future?????????? <EOR> Yum!  huge rolls just delectable   bit pricey wasn't impressed non sushi entrees   However sushi awesome!
