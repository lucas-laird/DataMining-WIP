Ever seen those commercials TV restaurant exists nowhere near where live? Enter Ruby Tuesday  Bay Area resident seen repeats commercials many occasions especially revamping image something lamp?   least think thats commercials    Anyway Vegas past weekend crashed friend's house area  Granted house half hour away Strip night where didn't want drive all way when discovered place no brainer try it    This particular location rather empty Sunday night but then again its heavily populated area  There's salad bar right when walk silly thought free  carnivore tend ignore salad bars but if  your thing add onto your tab    I ordered Brewmaster burger  Remember if order any burger comes unlimited fries  T G I  Friday's Red Robin child bore Ruby Tuesday! even some decent strawberry lemonade real strawberries  burger itself pretty delicious wheat bun also plus  wasn't drenched BBQ sauce could taste hint beer meat    Another reason why place is     Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat tap! know it  Suddenly Yard House isn't only franchised place find this  way if anyone knows where else carry Bay please shed some light    Our waitress awesome very attentive but then again weren't many people eating there  What's even more awesome bill split per person much food ordered  Basically overall receipt showed much each person needed pay  No need separated checks need write down much charge each card!   I bet if franchise more common Bay I'd give lower score  Then again its not  Eating pretty good burger unlimited fries enjoying brewski watching NBA playoffs some good friends wonderful experience    I still hate place showing commercials when don't any locations nearby  <EOR> Surprisingly very good  all Ruby Tuesday now  BF cos 'buy 1 1 free' coupon boy worth it  shared Boston Blue Burger Avocado Turkey Burger both very very good  seriously don't skimp ingredients wheat bun just made everything better  amazing stuff two people under 10 bucks  unlimited tasty fries but man   you able eat lot need refills  full salad bar just $2 99 very tempting well but knew couldn't put all me  Although maybe better idea would've salad bar doggie bag some burger     tried Ruby T which supposed pomegranate juice iced tea but tasted more plain iced tea anything else   $5 cocktails very enticing well but decided pass drinking  Oh but service quite possibly some best ever had  girl amazing  think name Brenda  <EOR>
