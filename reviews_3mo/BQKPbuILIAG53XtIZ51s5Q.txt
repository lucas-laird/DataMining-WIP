Oh Tommy oh Tommy let down!  I patiently waiting waiting Tommy's side town   watching countdown new store Craig open months now   happy today when saw Facebook finally open   heart all aflutter couldn't over fast enough grab ridiculously messy oh good chili cheese burger fries   then downhill     First location itself tucked into corner big shopping center   only 3 parking spots near restaurant   Otherwise park walk across entrance drive thru side which lot cross traffic   People driving all sorts crazy area careful walking around since really isn't clear path walk on   I actually drive thru today because kiddo fallen asleep way over   easy into drive thru but really tricky once picked your food   driveway very narrow quite close building   drive mid size sedan tight   feel bad anyone big SUV full size truck   Pay attention might hit wall   Next order taker   She really quite friendly but pushy side   needed second review board know order daughter eat later   asked minute check board   think maybe 15 seconds before she asking if ready order yet   wasn't line am sure why she such rush     I ahead ordered then she asked if wanted upsize drink extra $ 50   said very clearly No thanks which she said Ok  assumed meant would getting regular sized drink silly me!  window she hands large soda which totally charged wasn't just mistake whoever serving sodas   told said regular she said she thought said upsize it   wasn't mood argue just took drink   mean love soda easy drink 2 liters no time but am trying good cut back soda addiction   much that!  just fishy opinion   don't know if girl really made mistake wanted improve sell totals   watch trap   Next burger order   ordered regular chili cheese burger   specifically asked no onions because yucky   girl told only put onions burgers if request them   said great please keep them off burger   imagine surprise when home having drooling over burger next last 3 miles then took big bite into burger covered ONIONS   Ugh   never seen many onions almost extra helping them   Fun times sure   So took bite into onion infested burger take big swig giant soda wash onions down   Guess what?  soda mix totally off   mean place open 2 5 hours time there   soda syrup mix already goofed up?  yes paid extra gross soda     On positive side burger super tasty once picked all onions off smothered delicious Tommy's chili cheese   fries simply amazing! no shame scrapped all extra chili cheese off paper wrapped in  Yummmm cheese paper     If haven't tried Tommy burger really need too!  I still love Tommy's even all messes listed above   am giving location benefit doubt giving them 3 stars   opening day maybe everyone working kinks  <EOR> I still can't believe NV Tommy's locations let alone side town  regular shack count that! through work day couldn't wait break location its grand opening day  naturally line when inside waited table while wife ordered  didn't take long food arrive looked damn good  ordered caliente burger combo  caliente burger original chili burger but chipotle cheese sliced cascabella chilies it  wanted extra beef patty which cost $1 40 worth it  ask extra chili your burger no extra charge  burger great fries great happy  side chilies really hit spot too  nice food tastes consistent just remember eating Tommy's when lived southern California    Not much parking front but location really tucked into corner need most likely park strip mall parking which isn't far away  drive thru but would only recommend if hurry because when food gets wrapped tighter then just end opening your food find most chili wrapper  <EOR> YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! location set Tommy's longggggg time but guess issue billboard being close building something  cares why open now!!!!!  There isn't much parking directly front Tommy's handicapped parking however Tommy's shares whole parking lot rest shopping center isn't far walk all  If true Tommy's fan few extra steps wont kill since likely eating chili use those few extra steps! also drive thru  appears because drive thru little space only put few spots front detour accidents want customers park shared shopping center spaces   It didn't surprise see place packed when walked in  long line hungry customers  line while hubby kept eye snag table  girl took order very friendly repeated order sure right  then made way fill drinks while order being made grab some good ole Tommy's napkins  napkins more paper towels necessary when eating here!   The food ready ready dig in! ordered #4 Chili Cheese Dog Fries drink priced $8 55 requesting drink large adding chili cheese mustard onion fries  Yum! cut chili dog half share because hearty  fries delicious held chili other toppings perfectly  Hubby ordered Caliente Burger Combo gobbled up  friend ordered Chili Tamale priced $3 25 he really enjoyed it  left very full satisfied!   Anybody original location Beverly Rampart knows nostalgia location  never another but certainly thankful location right Las Vegas memories  Thank Tommy's branching California making your presence Nevada! If don't see shack take back! <EOR> Yummy!  Cheeseburgers  great but messy    Parking awful   But food very good   excellent customer service   other reviews accurate  <EOR> I gave place 5 stars because both quality food service  immediately greeted when register taking order another employee opened other register eagerly take order did wait   The food itself prepared promptly tasted just back home!   My significant other fast food burger junkie am but does accompany when mood    As patiently waiting chomping burger manager came table asked everything was  impressed he must notice eating explained he never Tommy 's manager insisted try some chili brought back some complimentary chili cheese fries   This type attentiveness generosity any new business should operate  getting free stuff but letting your customers know aware standing behind your product offering person otherwise would give chance second thought  <EOR> We'll interested trying new burger driving place few times figured I'd give shot   Ordered single chili cheeseburger regular cheeseburger   bun soggy tomatoes possibly pickle well   took those off down pickles most memorable thing burger pretty sad   Also chili cheese fries thought Shyte colored paste resembling well diarrhea but thicker pastier if word  <EOR> I am thrilled Tommy's location finally open   long time coming   Despite rather crappy location being behind rest shopping center visible street driving past people know support such historic piece SoCal culture keep burger joint open hopefully years come   little strange driving under low lying quite large billboard when going through drive thru   equally strange being long narrow drive thru along side flood channel   But product within strange complex know love Original Tommy's     I usally same order when go   double cheese burger everything   burger two meat patties cheese rib sticking chili thick slice tomato diced onion pickles mustard   Add some regular fries scoop chili drippings off paper set   Some times switch order bit chili tamale   tamale chili all other fixin's burger   almost every bit good   Worth try   If breakfast person try burrito   last time BOGO coupon   ate first burrito save other lunch   big  <EOR> Yuck  Actual hamburger paper thin   Chili very greasy  Customer service great  But stick in n out  <EOR> With all rave Tommy's pretty surprised walk Tuesday 6pm see place pretty much dead  Can't say enough staff though whole crew counter really nice friendly    I spicy food Caliente calling name  starters chili friggin delicious! ridiculously greasy but tasty I'd back just chili cheese fries  burger patties super thin when tried taste meat itself all could taste toppings  Caliente only comes patty felt eating chili sandwich onions peppers  really good buns though  plus    Maybe mistake getting double maybe even triple burger  may sound lot but patties thin just couldn't taste meat all  couple things menu I'd really try especially tamale breakfast  Even if just chili though I'd back again  <EOR> Heard GREAT burger could Tommy's  am missing? Meat ? patty paper thin tasteless cheese greasy tasted velvetta yeah know but some people call cheese chili tasted paste tomato ripe  Oh wait  the diced onions GREAT ! ! staff English obviously being second language personality garden slugs  Then even more obvious flaw  location sucks being tucked corner afterthought  parking lot  practically no parking near front door  empty  location previous BUZZ BBQ where people actually see park close door would better choice  Actually Tommy probably did all favor hiding horrible excuse burger joint where customers actually tempted spend hard earned money  yourself favor SKIP IT  <EOR> Tasted exactly remembered growing LA   only problem tastes changed now greasy heavy me   suppose if plastered would love Tommy's burger but would positively regret next day  <EOR> I used Original location since far where brother lived but haven't years    The chili gloopy greasy mess think why am eating this? but yet enjoy eating fries  thing thick cut fries nice inbetween steak fries regular cut fries serve here    I burger but since chili cheese fries already just classic california one  meh   balance all off    what mean patty thin then theres thick tomato slices lots lettuce etc  when things bit more proportionate  BF Caliente burger which better   When ordered messed rang 3 burgers two classics clientele  When told them refunded money extra burger but told keep it  took home pugs cat split cheese meat patty   I see rare occasion want radioactive chili fries coming but something really think visiting often  other burgers better  <EOR> SoCal arrived only 10 mins away! best best here  would travel east vegas grub now just few mins away  Fresh chili cheeseburger     chili cheese fries   and best coca cola   I kno its just soda but taste good here  Good service   Very happy! <EOR> first time trying would def back  Service great food very good  <EOR> Good burgers good fries  huge fan chili but come burgers fries  Good friendly service too  <EOR> A few customers few people work rant good place is   guess lot them grew place cali  honest food wasn't good  chili didn't taste all I'd rather chili store put burger fries  Sitting girlfriend l both ate looked each other pretty much both said Wiener schnitzel better chili  giving 3 only because service good place clean but would 2 star if service also bad  <EOR> Finally 2 years waiting piece L A close home Vegas  say its Tommys    distinctive taste still only reason gave  4       getting pain ass bad bad location  <EOR> I don't understand hype place  think must nostalgia thing people grew it  chili absolutely disgusting  resembles canned cat food  looks pre eaten takes whatever shape design lid if added cornstarch could probably use play dough   burgers very sub par better fries high school cafeteria  3 year old wouldn't  touch any food first bite   and she  eats anything everything    n seems  going anyway  only reason gave 2 stars instead 1 because location convenient  <EOR>
