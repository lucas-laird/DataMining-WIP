Most them priced around $2 85 all full flavor  coconut passionfruit slushy which came gigantic tub like cup!  Also ordered 6 skewer special which okay tasting  chose chicken gizzard chicken heart pork lamb ribeye  could added more seasoning onto meat more flavor but eh  however meat grilled perfection very chewy but honestly can't really full skewers alone which why shouldn't come if you're super hungry  garlic butter mussels delish! but course can't full either  BeeGee's sizzling platter probably only thing full since came porkchop beef chicken plus rice flavor quite savory   Pros gigantic drinks! tasty skewers  Cons price skewers probably won't full unless order lot <EOR> Since first visit back twice all occurred June 2011   Let's update some new things noticed   First all same waiter really friendly helpful each time come eat here  If any questions he'll happy answer them  specials specific skewers $0 99  Luckily favorite chicken gizzards part deal D   Be warned big boba cups fit your cup holder  However seen smaller cups probably ask it  big cups though D  They're cute   I also tried chicken sizzling platter very last visit  definitely sizzling when it  Tastes teriyaki awhile  know sticking skewers which still try all different types   friend beegee mix but  just all meat   If party 4 more sure call ahead time ask yelp special + would definitely help your orders ahead time something  does take LONG time if there's lot orders especially other guests   sure time  <EOR> Super cool dudes super promising eats  popped late night nibble  spot small casual only enough seating 20 30 people  menu small but if you're looking meat stick find need  majority menu dedicated yakitori although other items such udons meat veggie bowls  ordered veggie skewer sampler husband ordered scallop lamb salmon  meat selection wide everything chicken heart squid!   Our main concern little heavy handed seasonings  veggies salty scallop seasoning wasn't preference  scallops baby sized bit chewy which disappointing  wouldn't say serving size generous but then again neither price tag guess   Service kind  Young guys seemed concerned delivering good eats  definitely want back give tasty beverage selection sip  if you're adventurous meat eater would recommend stopping sample some more unique wares i e  chicken hearts! <EOR>
