Also food quite fresh!! <EOR> Craving sushi but wanting off strip referred Sushi Mon resident Vegas    My dining companion asked if restaurant time limit long could eat looked she insane   Well she correct ask time limit All You Can Eat Sushi option  I yet ever experienced All Eat place restrictions time apparently going first   going put timer table? Their menu selection quite large ranges appetizers nigiri dessert even!  few items limited 2 per person few 'hot' items Saturday night   told might wait but actually none   sat sushi bar could order directly sushi chefs   Quite few other patrons sushi chefs commented surprisingly slow evening   Despite slow night chefs busy watching TV pay much attention customers felt wave them down attention       The food okay some good rolls some alright items   recall wanting finish some cooked fish appetizer ordered   wasn't all great   spicy tuna roll wasn't par mind   Service okay   think waitresses didn't understand English very well she colleague help lot   little offended when ordered dessert returned check well  Uh weren't done yet hour wasn't yet either  Overall felt rushed watching 'hour' time limit   think paid $25 each All Eat but figured good deal   all once order couple rolls nigiri you've spent much money already   If All Eat Sushi want Sushi Mon give you  various choices hot cold items gives bigger range choose from     Can't mochi and or ice cream dessert either!
