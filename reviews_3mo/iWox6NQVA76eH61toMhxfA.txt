Nearly $13 sandwich bowl soup   No drinks chips price   It's fairly new place near office decided check out   pannini sandwich almost no meat all    came side orange slices appeared verge rotting   also ordered large bowl chicken noodle soup   should just called noodle soup   less tablespoon chicken few small bits carrot just bunch waaaay over cooked noodles   over cooked cannot tell noodles when eat them    Just pure mush   I'll never back   Silly me!  fault   happens when decided Capriotti's   even take Subway over over priced rip off  <EOR> Food bland cold  Flavors didn't well together  Way over priced quality food   If you're thinking trying panera bread instead  <EOR> Went probably two weeks grand opening still bit empty but just meant food going quick! did pick 2 deal which $8  tried some spicy turkey sandwich which wasn't spicy even when cashier warned it  also tried seafood crab soup winner especially sandwich dip it  pickle spear delicious wish bigger  Overall good sandwich place eat if options open spaces okay price   My four stars service mainly because workers came once but twice see if everything alright  Maybe  because only family but still  <EOR>
