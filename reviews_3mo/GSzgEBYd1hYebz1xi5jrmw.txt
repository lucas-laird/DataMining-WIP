I discovered Domino's Pizzas while back tucked away inside Sinclair 7 11 gas station finally remembered check out  placed order online during March Madness basketball games weekend given 14 min ETA  When arrived store 15 min later pizza done promised paid way back continue watching basketball    I ordered medium Honolulu Hawaiian pan pizza 1st thing noticed when holding box little heavier usual  When opened box pleased find pizza covered generous amount toppings put other pizza chains shame  Well explains why box heavy! Overall pizza tasty although some parts crust could've used few more min cook time since still tasted little doughy  This location smaller inside gas station only carry out available no deliveries  running special where menu items $5 99 each including medium 2 topping pizzas long order 2 more list <EOR>
