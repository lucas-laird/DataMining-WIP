It's because name restaurant only three quarters correct  Philly Cheese Steak? Absolutely  Express ? Absolutely not    This place only few months old but still seem having pretty serious problem service speed  honestly doesn't seem they've mastered fine art making more order time  never waited less 20 minutes sandwich fries soda  Which even though food worth kind ridiculous  If only hour lunch stop here? You're going VERY lucky back time    How long going wait? Well now  Waiting sandwich fries soda  far made restroom trip then sat down wait   and written entire review phone amount time waiting 15 minutes    Okay   after another six minutes food  gonna delicious  But remembered something else also third time three visits handed order remind them hadn't given drink yet    So Bottom line Food fantastic  But service consistently slow spotty  come but time pack your patience  <EOR> Philly steak awful period  even close good quality  Also leaves nasty aftertaste mouth  <EOR> My wife tried place first time  fair  philly mostly bread much anything else  fries over seasoned worse part soggy  wife ordered Kabob 1 6 size pictured didn't even come stick pictured   weren't thanked anytime given receipt purchase  cook arguing someone sign taking phone calls while cooking cell failing wash hands after  won't back  <EOR> Called menu sent office could order lunch   Girl phone said don't menu online don't fax machine fax menu   Said come pick inconvenient   Could hardly understand girl phone   If want more business would post menu online more friendly when customers want support establishment call in  <EOR> The menu chaotic gyros burritos salads kabobs mention namesake philly steaks  But kabobs aren't available steak gyros aren't available lamb  But currently well priced salmon kabob special $11    Considering very mixed reviews phillys opted salads here  gyro salad handful lettuce three strips meat three four cucumber tomato pieces  takeout box half empty  additional Greek salad friend ordered no feta  Seriously?   Restaurant walkup counter  Large patio outdoor seating  Prices low  guy dining exclaimed he Philadelphia food rockin'  underwhelmed enough salads disinterested trying more options  YMMV  <EOR> Food quality terrible  Philly steak bland cook order wrong took 30 minutes correct  know real philly steak tastes won't find anything remotely close establishment   Dining experience whole terrible  returning  <EOR>
