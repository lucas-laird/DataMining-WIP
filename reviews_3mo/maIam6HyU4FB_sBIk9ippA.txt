My only gripe place hidden away   Actually come think good thing way keeps place populated yet enough people keep business   The decor excellent almost reminds home way log cabin lodge style outdoors pictures paintings hanging everywhere   moose head wall staring down while enjoying drinks I swear!    The food served separate dining area bar lounge quite good money   also nice if care watch sports something TV no matter where look sit excellent view flat screen LCD televisions   The bar center bar surrounded large lounge area quite nice comfortable   able relax sit back enjoy couple beers while entertaining companion   fireplace nearby if lit would given lodge feel mountain without mountain snow   If live near Rainbow south 215 excellent 24 hour restaurant bar would recommend anyone probably frequenting more often  <EOR>
