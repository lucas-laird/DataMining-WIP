Typical McDonald's located food court MGM Grand     Prices reasonable no higher any free standing location open 24 hours   Cashiers reasonably friendly considering deal most times crazy control drunk people    offer employee discount MGM employees lot but better nothing   The only thing note breakfast available 24 hours like most McDonald's locations but starts 4am   It always seems food ready quicker anywhere else been   sure if good bad!  Basically if cheap dine other late night option Wolfgang Puck's good choice   Especially if just getting back club  <EOR> The usual McDonald's food prices fast friendly service  morning coffee rather nearby Starbucks faster cheaper  $1 hot coffee around $2 iced coffee  leaves few more $ your pocket lose er use casino  <EOR> Much lower competition    Friendly customer service   We sweet chili chicken wrap $3 99 without meal 2 apple pies which sale $1   This best option food court   Everything else overpriced  <EOR>
