<EOR> Chef Eric fun reputation when comes teasing food over Internet via Twitter Tweeting lots pics  aren't just normal food pics but pics your mouth water Pavlov's dog  time try restaurant inside quirky Artisan Hotel  Having hotel only once before wasn't sure getting myself into  But literally wear scent Adventure decided throw caution Vegas strong Winter wind trek across town   If you've never Artisan veritable hipster paradise First Friday art exhibit never closes  mostly valet parking except few sports round back gives upper crust boutique hotel feel right arrive  Stepping inside trying process decor fun  looks tornado hit art gallery placed pieces everywhere including ceiling weird angles  All tell don't take themselves seriously you're fun try something completely different  hotel itself close enough Las Vegas Strip without all usual hustle bustle   Then arrive back hotel where lounge restaurant located  first confused sans any greet staff  took solid minute ask waiter if anyone going seat me  He promptly replied take any seat wish  sat four top  food biz call table four four top   My waiter presented himself few minutes later asking if I'd glass wine alcoholic beverage  ordered soft drink disrupt tasting abilities  enjoy chef's tasting menu   The first course included watercress salad truffle sauce fried calamari cherry pepper compote unusually delicious  pepper worked well balance sweet cherry nice idea taste good   The second course larger spoon included tasty farm raised striped bass cous cous truffled watercress  haven't fish skin still while but easy remove presented well  cous cous cooked properly nice balance bass since fish usually rich   The final course entree  included braised short rib veal demi glaze cooking five hours port wine reduction  served baby carrots roasted potatoes  entire veal demi glaze tender easily pulled off bone fork  sauce just enough over powering  Even smaller tasting size quite filling  Thanks chef Eric Mood Restaurant fun taste test  <EOR> We Artisan Friday night 8 30 pm   busy waited short time table set   talked Ron seemed host he pleasant   told locals going 5 years  ordered appetizers within 5 minutes seating main courses 5 minutes later     Our appetizer came 3 4 hour later a Mediterranean dish hummus olives eggplant    waited another hour mains still come   people seated beside just theirs long before since 7 30pm  told waiter cancel orders ridiculous wait long no notice staff     The table next said good idea food all bad   steak ordered rare sent back once already replaced least served medium   short ribs good all meat 6 entrees ordered table was overcooked    Ron came say waiter noticed dishes ready lamb rack steak he put new lamb steak grill us   did believe all going throw away perfectly good meat new ones because ours sitting warmer  said would pay eaten wanted leave   Ron came back 5 minutes later said food would ready 3 minutes   said no leaving   no apology nothing   paid tab he still never said anything   people next charged shrimp scampi meal never because no shrimp restaurant night   told waiter food terrible service terrible no response either     Our appetizer plates cutlery never removed table even though least hour since finished them  addition someone other side ordered some seafood not sure smell overwhelming almost sick   thinking lucky didn't order seafood   eaten many times before but last 5 months   back again   treat locals way treated way stay business  <EOR> Okay really sure why many reviewers semi positive place  can't say I'd ever back  positive lobby Artisan really cool  Great attention detail   We didn't know where Mood asked front desk guy rather coldly just pointed its direction  then arrived assumed restaurant A giant menu poster gave away thought    We then stood front menu poster 10 minutes waiting some sign life greet us  then decided venture bar try some understanding seating works place nicknamed The Twilight Zone   bartender told just sit anywhere  moment meal overall experience real snooze  server no personality food okay definitely worth prices  <EOR> I super extra highly hopeful night Mood read great things chef certainly some glowing reviews but    wow  Just wow  bad   First let say little Artisan itself it  gothic bordello nightclub vibe just neat hell walking into eccentric millionaries mansion  quiet lobby maybe some would find tad spooky no there's no signs pointing towards Mood bar front desk going jump start assisting your search but easy find where going chirpy uniformed attendants would've ruined vibe me  isn't strip hotel guys don't except cookie cutter approach   We ventured forward into multi leveled darkly lit bar area would sit drink anytime indeed next time Artisan just cocktail or 6    But restaurant    man    walked waited  waited  Walked away see if missed some sort host stand walked back when realized hadn't waiter looked walked away    waited  Finally he came over said sit anywhere  Since only two other tables occupied pick! decor restaurant itself neat interesting ceiling details cool appropriate theme paintings wall etc great funny piano player playing some tunes platform against wall room   However    some details just chintzy  flowers table fake stuck into green nasty sytrofoam stuff find craft stores  wouldn't horrible except fact clear square vase stuck staring frayed fabric flowers clear vase full cumbled green styrofoam     place $30 entrees   I ordered french onion soup start then lamb friend soup well we're French onion soup freaks say airline chicken breast garlic mash   The onion soup insanely salty  Insanely  when mean insanely mean salt took two bites thought might ill salt content  Neither could eat just pushed aside  watier took them away without comment question  Booo  he's used food being sent back he didn't care couldn't read table  Both bad   Our entrees came both beautifully artfully plated  Really gorgeous  Unfortunately neither matched flavor  lamb cooked MR I asked temp when placed order fact noted but decided just kind see played out   but little sear outside meat bit cold left flabby semi cold fat just sort hanging chop  Meh  Accompanying veg just plain baby veg oven roasted fingerling potatoes appeared boiled left completely unseasoned  Maybe couldve dunked them some leftover French onion soup? Hmmm     My friends food fared no better  chicken breast itself ok both flavor temperature but garlic mashed potatoes nestled cold  sitting waiting table delivery bit long cold but right damned cooler cold  Refrigerator cold  Everything made ahead scooped molded plate cold  Gross   We both few bites pushed away   Just really really disappointing  least piano player total laugh wine nice! If stick piano man lounge double likely nice tipsy occasion but back food no thanks no way   One last thing if you're still considering going aware menu site completely same restaurant  Nothing huge but couple price differences obviously some dishes exactly described  Neither ununusual restaurant menus online vs house but just heads up! <EOR>
