Its good try good teriyaki place  twice figuring maybe first time just came wrong day  Sadly enough feel spent way much money got  For $6 50 fried unseasoned tofu rice   it  even put own teriyaki sauce! could made home! second time tofu stirfry suprised unseasoned tofu bed cooked cabbage  exactly vegtables thinking of  The reasons 2 stars service amazing teriyaki sauce amazing restaurant clean! PS rather upset though time big screen tvs some show top fights crashes tad bit gruesome see peoples arms break bones stick while eating overpriced food  <EOR> I must say thought strange chain opened particular location Samurai Sam's Panda Express located mere five minute walk away but thought I'd try anyway   Plainly said SUCKED   I ordered Spicy Chicken Plate no vegetables WOW tasted such garbage long time  know doesn't necessarily take much chicken spicy but could more creative just pouring syriachi sauce meat stir frying it  tasted ONLY seasoning meat    I also mention white rice crunchy macaroni salad runny reminded more potato salad  Just nasty   For quick Asian eats check aforementioned Panda Express because even Samurai Sam's gone down hill area  <EOR>
