It's KFC  does whatever any other KFC do  All say careful going Friday night because people buying food families sometimes line gets long might 20 minute wait your  bucket chicken  <EOR> I guess can't write stellar review KFC since really actually don't KFC general  Honestly pretty sure chicken some mutated deformed chicken raised torn apart shoved buckets   However family loves KFC am subjected it  against eating just wouldn't without having someone else purchase me  chicken meh mac cheese meh coleslaw okay really lacking sides department  just did used more variety? believe last time could actually select salad side but apparently no longer option   The only thing KFC mashed potatoes gravy  Don't know why but something salty balance really gets me   This KFC pretty well taken care service tends mediocre but nice  busy dinner time sure  Today mother swore down she saw advertisement special KFC offering TV asked special  particular store would honor sure  about   In conclusion no thanks KFC! fried chicken fix elsewhere! <EOR>
