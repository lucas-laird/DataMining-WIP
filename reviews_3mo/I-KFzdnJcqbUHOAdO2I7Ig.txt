** WARNING may lengthy ** I visited location Southern Highlands wanted place just because! first experience however definitely ensure NEVER EVER return no matter occasion   This toughest reviews write because many things wrong during time there  Now am taking into consideration fact new restaurant some employees may never worked restaurant before please think am being critical  fact worked 2 completely new restaurants know goes  My boyfriend arrived 1 30pm  seated small section booths  waitress Tatjana came over introduced herself well menu  She extremely cute friendly quick water take initial orders AYCE    We ordered straight sushi first Screaming Orgasm Amaebi Albacore Garlic Tuna 2 Spicy Tuna Hand rolls Anago  1 2 Krispy Kristi Roll 1 2 Helmet Crest + 2 other half rolls  A few moments Screaming Orgasm came out  decent  sauce seemed bit bland  finished though then 2 spicy tuna CUT rolls come out  put down table even though mentioned didn't order it  During time seemed lot confusion regarding table numbers  3 different people came table wrong orders MULTIPLE times but nigiri came just time   Amaebi served plain best  Albacore seared albacore  ordered PLAIN albacore    yes seared albacore regular albacore menu  MUCH better  Garlic Tuna didn't taste garlic sauce it! closer taste cajun 2 spicy tuna hand rolls never came  guessed must 2 cut rolls table decided might well try it  Before even chewed once put tongue could taste rice  tasted if soap rice  really strong bad taste even overpowered spicy tuna  Anago unlike Unagi Anago usually prepared actually sushi chefs store bought  decent Sushi Factory wins   We never 4 half rolls even 1hr+ waiting  waited some more  The waitress did acknowledge asked order mussels combo tempura anyway  Hoping see if ANY rolls would come out  mussels came probably tastiest part meal  But other orders still nothing already 3pm   Our waitress let know kitchen little backed also mentioned  she'd speak management see she could do  First saying hope don't pay this  But said No your fault  waited 15 more minutes  No manager    I finally enough  didn't want seem rude flagged down waitress again explained work soon asked check  She said very sorry your experience couldn't agreed more  Tatjana gave 1 2 off trouble which thoughtful  She asked if management speak yet told yet but would love if she'd come by  When management finally came a mid late 20something brunette hat on she seemed if no told situation stared blankly  explained sure new restaurant all still figuring kinks but received hardly any food felt neglected opposed rest restaurant  She responded Well supposed soft opening family friends only just weren't really ready only table happen  told weren't complaining  just want let know although upset another couple could much more upset now it'd wise address issue order prevent happening future  kept pleasant even though irritated STILL HUNGRY mind you  wondered If table happening knew then management cannot fix problem?! Especially if ONLY table problem?!?! Just table pay extra attention to! Honestly unprofessional poorly handled poorly executed  IMO looked OVER staffed considering herd employees walk through table   Besides main waitress great even offered dessert end AYCE even though didn't want any  would star rating her  tipped 20% because customer service alone   There lot good sushi restaurants area pick just one  <EOR> I craving AYCE sushi friend already once last week  very new still finalizing some outdoor heating patio  location great especially liked roll door provides sushi bar patio    I think servers new working sushi restaurant but friendly provided good customer service  If sushi restaurant know want shouldn't any problems    They very nice decor inside large wine room behind glass along additional seating further back restaurant  sat sushi bar enjoying nice afternoon view  similar variety rolls appetizers find many sushi restaurants along few heard before    The sushi chefs working time visit very friendly knowledgeable accommodating  given complimentary Hamachi salad try  found new favorite roll which Yoshi Dynamite  mochi dessert server included half sample red bean try    We left totally full very satisfied  AYCE lunch $19 95 thought great deal considering much ate    Overall enjoyed eating thought food great  look forward visiting again  <EOR> I first time weekend opened again yesterday   say still gripe service   don't understand why servers don't know they're serving!  should come early day them see serve   sushi chef show them they're serving least pictures have   server giving names sushi ordered she giving wrong name each one   Now let's reason why still gave them five star rating   Their sushi excellent!  first sushis tightly made falling apart when picked them up   Now they're rolled well tastes damn good!  actually ordered AYCE time took advatage it   order whole menu but steaks lobsters sashimi   nice change timed limited choices other sushi places   ordered fill sushi then came dessert   tempura battered ice cream   word describe delicacy YUM!  With gripe servers would deduct star but least courteous nice   five star rating deserve   definitely come back again some time  <EOR> This place delicious  AYCE $25 99  Recommend mussels yellowtail Xastacy roll red bean mochi  Nice decor choice indoor outdoor seating  <EOR> I loved dinner last Sat  night  husband another couple sat outside Best Time! Sitting patio starting drinks   get Godzilla  Then switched version chocolate martini called cinnamon something  Then ate   Start appetizers baked mussels die for  Can't miss getting Southern Highland salad next move Sushi  Loved Voloshin Motion Potion Krispy Kristie  Don't miss getting Kayla roll save room share steak  BEST EVER! ALWAYS put steak sauce steaks but one  1st time ever eaten enjoyed ever bite just way prepared  <EOR> Xtremely Horrible should name! honestly say worst sushi ever besides Vons pre made rolls! rice even close sushi quality fish fresh service well none  would nice drink before half way done your meal!  When pay 30 bucks all eat would order but some guy street clothes kept bringing over half rolls other peoples half orders finish  Trust plenty more sushi restaurants Eastern blow place away even if dont outdoor patio looking parking lot  urghh  Im feeling sick even writing place <EOR> It's list favorite AYCE sushi places but would back lunchtime prices live right down street  different interesting worth try    service seems bit lacking servers still learning  When ordered Flying Fish pure curiosity server failed tell Flying Fish Roe totally different!! Why even listed wrong menu? wasn't fish eggs wasn't good    amazing sushi connoisseur wouldn't know if flying fish only served eggs! things hope see fixed future    good potential    <EOR> My second favorite sushi place Vegas  Great service fresh fish  extensive menu everyone loves sushi those prefer steak  Its place everyone  Whitney gracious host took very good care small party 4  even roll don't see menu! Just ask! Highly recommend  <EOR> Disappointed! love sushi  But place HATE sushi  Friendly staff but server didn't even know different types tuna  extreme orgasm orgasmic all  Looked unappetizing no taste  ordered roll asked no avocado due allergies  brought order avocado  when reminded server WITHOUT avocado she took away came back minute later avocado off I'm guessing she just took off hands added more sauce  Yikes! only good thing miso soup mochi ice cream  <EOR> Ok      If all time world then come here! Service xtremely slooooow! Sushi good but damn forget order! extremely fond if place! <EOR> Great place feel amazing  chefs nice very welcoming  Im fan chef rolls but wouldn't place that  Instead nigiri sashimi amazing without doubt  only worth if your doing all eat Been 3x now love its minus some cons slow severs kinda seems roll selections all sounds amazing but taste aren't great  <EOR> Horrible Service  Xtremely SLOW   Rice Xtremely undercooked  worst sushi ever had  COME HERE  Appetizers seem Costco   charged three all eat dinners only 2 items ordered   Menu busy   they Sushi place Steakhouse serve Filipino food?    Have nothing good say  <EOR> My first one star review  feel really bad but necessary    Before start off everything negative place maybe couple redeeming factor should said  restaurant new decor pretty nice  lounge area front seems inviting  Hmm     it!  We party eight night  all did all you can eat except pair couple  Given regular AYCE know orders pretty hectic wrote down orders piece paper many number order each  should made server's life easier orders arrive quicker    Well wrong  thing say am glad no time limit AYCE because dinner 2 half hour long  intentional part    First give all rolls ordered which am sure strategy part fill rice  Then bring four orders nigiri server asks if gotten everything ordered  WAIT MINUTE! list didn't you??? Anyway waited food longer took eat food  terrible!   Second rice cold hard  felt swallowing pebbles no matter much chew  fish itself very decent fresh but rice terrible  However fresh fish rice 75% nigiri wasn't much room turn into more positive situation    Anyways place dollar cheaper your usual AYCE  I'd avoid if can  Good luck! <EOR>
