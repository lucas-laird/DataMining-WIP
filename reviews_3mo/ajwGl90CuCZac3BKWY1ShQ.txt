Another national chain spot no reviews  good reason  pretty pointless review McDonald's  unless want FTR!  McDonald's good thing  their dollar menu  sucker $1 McDouble maybe some fries  road trips $1 one price fits all sizes fountain drink priceless  Unfortunately all McDonald's locations stick pricing structure but location certainly does   I've never actually inside but drive thru nice face to face three window system  sure need third window just ordering but whatever  works  <EOR>
