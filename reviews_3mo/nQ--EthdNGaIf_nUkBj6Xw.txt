Don't let decor pictures fool you   place shit   first table arrive Saturday dinner   12 people no other diners whole place except 2 people bar   3 hours friend still gotten 2 rolls ordered  two she ordered!  finally canceled them!     While tasted some food others gotten theirs   Meh   not great   baby octopus cooked soy type sauce nasty   Normally am big fan but eating dog toy treat chewy goop side   4 tried   none said would order again   Edamame undercooked cold     The waiter did know flying fish egg sushi finally brought some bowl   send back made rice seaweed   Really?  work restaurant?  While it    horrid service   Waiter never knew ordered mess trying figure whole time   No manager staff complain to   Top all off added 18 5% Grat bill!  I return suggest find somewhere else Vegas eat   Lord knows enough them  <EOR> I loved restaurant  Vegas weekend restaurant right across street hotel  just convenience stopped wasn't expecting much but pleasantly surprised  Immediately when walk through door ambiance decor take your breath away  beautiful inside  waiter couldn't friendlier  nice relaxing meal  tried four different sushi rolls all great  salmon skin roll favorite   garlic edamame appetizer fantastic well  definitely going back next time Las Vegas! <EOR> The sushi bad but bit pricey get  ordered salmon lover spicy salmon but spicy salmon seemed better flavor and its cheaper    Being college student going vegas hit budget bit hard cheaper sushi all eat yamasushi little farther off strip   The sushi decent but take off star because terrible service had  waitress nice but took FOREVER food  only only very slow sushi chef but remember seeing food kitchen counter 10 min before even brought us  would understandable if restaurant actually busy!   When ordered extra roll wait took another 20 min when check found overcharged us  <EOR>
