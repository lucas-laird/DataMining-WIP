I plain pho no meat   It very good only $3 95   Fried tofu 2 5 stars wayyyyyyy salty taste  $6 95  If salty it  If less salt probably could good    Veggie egg rolls yuck me  0 stars  bit left plate  filling inside egg roll just wasn't me    This place clean fast service  even gave pitcher ice water  definitely worth checking if you're mood Pho  <EOR> Situated small town outside strip place some best Pho awhile  broth authentic Vietnamese taste wasn't oversaturated oil  Only reason 4 5 stars eat place twice before giving 5  Very good first impression though <EOR> Haven't many Vietnamese restaurants review average joe perspective    Walked hour before closing there's sign says wait seated but really just seat yourself waitress comes you  menu very simple read nice big pictures show your ordering  prices very cheap compared some other places but quality same if better  total came around $7 50    I ordered Beef Broccoli  food great! broccoli crisp yet soft same time beef cooked perfection    Overall don't expect much  five star fancy restaurant but good mom and pop family owned restaurant  most likely coming back near future  <EOR> Convenient cheap if bit eccentric  egg rolls nothing write home pho even plain excellent  thoroughly enjoyed sliced beef dish but bit slim meat portion bad deal given price Their bun needed little more roasted garlic flourish but its almost there  nuoc mam could stand bit stronger but guess want maximize potential customer base personally no problems passing fish market some excellent Vietnamese  yet try Chinese dishes menu but look mighty appetizing  Service still getting sorted but its bad just work progress  Later hours weekends well offering broken rice would nice  <EOR> This place good no joke!   I ordered Rare Beef Noodles soup   ahhh delicious  beef finished cooking just right hot soup  Totally recommend place! <EOR> Excellent broth good food exceedingly clean restaurant nice owner definitely returning! <EOR> The spot good   lucky found since townies    We street skateboarding some sick ditches yelp pho spots    Thanks great pho all hospitality    You rule Pho Rancho  <EOR> This 4 5 star Pho spot   Who hell serves pho broth  piping hot??  Look picture   not hint heat coming bowl   Pho Tai $6 95 Rare Beef Noodle Soup  Simple   broth HOT enough SALTY without balance flavor depth    just salt   Noodles clumped together due broth temp difficult eat meat portion bit lacking  disappointing!   We also tried Spring Rolls $5 95   Smaller shrimp tasting almost unseasoned but plated nicely well rendered peanut sauce    We also served soup without vegetables hot tea asked initial seating did arrive until 2 additional requests   received vegetables which served pho hit table   I'll gladly drive extra 10min much much better Pho same money   Pass! <EOR> Still gonna stay 3 1 2 stars   Went Pho Rancho again few days first visit some Asian eats   time around tried few different dishes which overall still just OK   House Special Fried Rice Seasoned Jasmine rice fried chicken pork shrimp scrambled egg peas carrots green onion   delicious!  Great balance salty tart sweet tangy all bite   Exceptional fried rice made very well fresh   Down side?  Portion!  Made little people people adverse carbs!  am I?  five years old?  am petite!  Feed me!  stretched portion fried rice feed three people but wouldn't hard time imagining could barely feed one   pile fried rice pretty small   Shrimp?  Man MAYBE four shrimp entire serving   weren't jumbo shrimp either   Only change dish would include LARGER portion price   Curry Chicken Shrimp w Rice Noodle Noodles flavored curry sautéed chicken shrimp onions bell peppers green onion bean sprouts   love curry dish just didn't fit bill   probably expected something dish wasn't   dry!  should asked if curry curry SAUCE instead more curry seasoning   Curry spices all cooked rice noodles much terms moisture!  dry hardly any oil liquid used dish   If don't curry won't really dish because spices tend strong   no exception   handle spice but can't handle lack moisture   drizzle olive oil?  splash coconut milk?  Would helped dish right track   Another gripe?  Portion!  swear Pho Rancho might hinted diet something   Pretty dish tiny portion!  could barely feed average sized person   mention skimpy shrimp well   shrimp crisis?  found four shrimp dish among spattering chicken pieces   favorite dish night   This round food still average needs some tweaking   House Special Fried Rice would definitely eat again yummy   Just needs bit more substantial   Curry Chicken Shrimp w Rice Noodle?  don't venture dish again anytime another visit   Just didn't meet any expectations     NO Curry  PHO SHO  <EOR> I just moved Las Vegas found pho place nearby neighborhood The price reasonable food delicious  highly recommend restaurant <EOR> I just want update review say food side place very good  All except thai tea no ice because server did know thai tea light ice   good food shitty service  <EOR> Great Vietnamese food being north!

Despite slow service definitely coming back because closest decent pho spot home! Also little cheaper compared pho Kim long  which where usually pho! <EOR> First say food delicious   Thai Tea fleek   That's where fleekness ended   EVERYTHING else off fleek   place absolutely WORST service ever experienced restaurant   To start off water came without any ice   Then took least 10 minutes waitress take drink appetizer order   fairly certain only reason waitress took order then because another patron seated near came 5 minutes arrived register ASK waiter waitress   The appetizer arrived entree plate veggies which always accompanies Pho never arrived all   then waited least 20 minutes to go box check could leave  No checked during meal  made gestures waitress least twice 20 minutes she nodded though she would return never did     Only when retrieved to go bag ourselves looked leaving did acknowledge all   Do yourself favor   If Pho takeaway place because service ruin your appetite  <EOR> Its great place eat  6 times last month  Just because hate waiting lines   My 84 year young mother ate entire Tempora lunch  She rarely finishes any meals  wanted try just little bit too  Curry Chicken also  reason Curry bad prepared order taken which means served fresh meal every time  No steam table food here  kinda used steam table food anyway  All food excellent  Darnit!!! spoiled me   Go McD       ds  same price B   Mac  pay more square burger We  dys   Don't come please  secret  love no waiting lines  sure once word gets change  good places do  <EOR> Overall would say food good service wasn't bad only problem serving size  beef teriyaki only 6 small pieces  Only soda can  If servings larger would 5 star sure <EOR> We came because found new pho place rather close house all way over Chinatown  Nice clean place lot's space! place run Chinese Vietnamese owners  Service needs work wait times little long bowl pho being only customers sunday afternoon  We ordered pho broth good amount meat decent but noodles hard chewy  noodles need little work before come back again  If you're looking quick pho fix around area place! <EOR>
