So   we did reservation due fact staff advised day prior should big deal would busy   wrong  coming back 2 hours later ready go  all suited jump suit harness  woooohh!! then took top floor platform area  watched couple people jump getting amped up! Then   the jump operator came behind enclosed area said windy close ride guys wait if want but don't know if reopen   getting all amped given bad news  taken back down took off all gear full refund  Spent total 3 hours day trying jump shot down     I know weather anything control but might want check wind weather report before going  actually checked weather report but much more windy top expected  hope chance actually take jump day     <EOR> If you're adrenaline junkie SkyJump Stratosphere Casino Hotel great attractions Las Vegas  Where else jump off building ground 855 feet below?  It's true freefall bungee jump skydiving but plenty fast amazing stand your toes over edge platform pirate walk plank  circular target far below looks really small remains looking small until you're almost bottom    At SkyJump store near bottom building you're asked use locker store any loose items your pocket elsewhere even including wristwatch   put jumpsuit then fitted into very snug harness  worker leads elevator accompanies top where wait small holding pen jump  When your turn comes two jumpmasters check your harness hook cable ask step edge platform quick countdown jump  impressed conscientiousness jumpmasters  jump feet first descent over all soon end padded landing site just outside SkyJump store   Most jumpers remain standing while few including fall knees pad   Technically jump called controlled descent decelerator descent  jumpmasters attach end very long cable most which wound large spool  spool cleverly constructed variable radius  mostly large but dwindling small radius end  approach bottom last part cable unwind small section  slows down last moment  Also spool attached fan like mechanism air resistance fan limits your top speed 40 mph   The web site refers short safety lesson but never received that  Fortunately didn't seem matter   The brightly colored jumpsuit seems unnecessary but mini celebrity time leave store time jump  usually crowd onlookers around SkyJump area 108th floor Observation Deck often ask questions you're waiting your turn  also fun eavesdrop comments onlookers  people crazy   Lord I'd never that  My only complaint $100 little steep such brief experience  If want DVD various other souvenirs price somewhat higher  course excitement just jump itself but anticipation jump ready your turn approaches   Most people jump promptly end countdown   Occasionally jumper freezes takes bit time before making plunge   person day chickens altogether    There weight limit 275 pounds   Because includes your street clothing jumpsuit harness your body weight shouldn't exceed 265   If you're close limit don't indulge many all you can eat Vegas buffets before jumping   The Stratosphere tallest building Las Vegas easily visible most places city   doing SkyJump you'll think every time see Stratosphere distance   plane taking off morning looking Stratosphere thinking Cool  jumped off building last night  <EOR> I loved SkyJump Las Vegas  true adrenaline junkie I'd never any other rides top Stratosphere but experience done  I only two issues over hour behind  Most likely due people hesitating  hesitated 20 seconds but girl before took 10 minutes  17 second jump  long time hesitate  Two harness snug around legs   Everything else awesome  Standing edge platform right before jumping exhilarating then jump step off throw yourself off fly! If $100 couple hours Vegas this  DVD also  Its poor quality video but its clear enough watch yourself jump top bottom  <EOR> My husband jumped midnight 4th July  start finish done hour half  ride absolutely amazing! staff highly skilled through numerous safety checks before able jump  worried roller coaster stomach feeling all  Felt more fast zip line straight down  recommend jump night views lights skyline spectacular  Highly recommended definitely again  <EOR>
