 The chicken good most part everything else good but something wrong coleslaw there  point ever time would eat I'd stomach cramps soon after  Once thought because side beans ate but then next time ate didn't order beans yet still same problem  Then I'd notice when ate leftovers only chicken didn't any problems figured only common thread coleslaw seemed problem  haven't coleslaw ever since haven't any problems since  <EOR>
