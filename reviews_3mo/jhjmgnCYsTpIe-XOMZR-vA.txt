We almost passed eating diamond ruff   staying Marriott night late didn't feel going picking between places there    picked right!  quiet little place tucked away down restaurant row Rampart Casino   While unassuming outside setup food great!  While can't say its best pub food ever eat its defiantly top 3  If looking decently priced simple place Vegas good food then check out   While its probably worth drive strip just eats its great if want change pace  <EOR>
