My group least 15 different dishes served all night full was    just could stop eating  lamb chops super tender calamari scrumptious lobster n' crab carpaccio Tortilla Espanol which even Basque friend said spectacular amazing grilled romaine dish yes    said Romaine lettuce    expect MUST ORDER!!        mouth watering just thinking it    all way dessert you MUST try truffles lychee vodka   only thing did enjoy ceviche     but probably because just don't ceviche general can't relied upon comparison this   In Las Vegas only 2nd restaurant 20 years coming regularly dined MUST DINE list each every subsequent visit Sin City the other being Kraftsteak MGM    Platinum cut Kobe steak    !!!   Firefly good     but place      class itself    Oh    VALUE!!!!! Price quality?

SCORE! The food exceptional price definitely reasonable  I enjoyed grilled romaine salad  Very flavorful  salad warm really taste dressing individual flavors  lamb phenomenal  enjoyed Carpaccio LOBSTER tortilla espaniola which authentic spanish  It wasn't room temperature which supposed served warm tasty herbs potatoes  Definitely try duck breast  usually more rare but definitely delish  dessert presentation very classy yet cutting edge  Truffles Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL! If chance definitely should try out  I'm really sure why even bad reviews  HATERS! <EOR> I special place heart reserved Tapas   I think place where all plaque accumulates  Anyway when Vegas usually Firefly and or Cafe Ba Ba Reeba eat own weight meat cheese   but anymore  new favorite Tapas place Vegas RE Tapas!

Marinated beef tenderloin skewers very garlicy moist delicious   Smoking crispy duck breast It served chinese steamer still smoking when arrived  actually smoke steamer  duck juicy inside crispy outside   it coated dry rub really smokey tasted cumin  really decadent fabulous   Coconut flan The flan served burnt sugar sauce garnished flaked coconut orange sugar dusted plantain chip  some best flan ever had   Overall experience amazing! RE Tapas bit way but definitely worth trip  <EOR> Twice RE   Twice disappointed    The first time didn't think food bad but wasn't anything special   service fine   sangria tasty but way light booze taste   The second time husband wanted check he missed food tapas places worked NY   patatas bravas   While flavor spot weren't hot enough could tell precooked past prime   also some beets ricotta salata   Except wasn't regular fresh ricota   Big difference   want order if don't please inform me   know difference   Another menu mistruth when ordered fried piquillo pepper   However when arrived said careful hot   Piquillos hardly hot ever never ever!  Anyway freakin hot   Maybe anaheims?  sent back love spicy food but when don't order it   also chicken croquettes   Dry way salty love salt   only tasted oregano salt   Oh did forget salt?  Dry dry dry   Honestly best thing meal cheese plate   would hard mess up   Even bread came sucked   pre toasted then brought table oiled soggy tough   Oh serrano manchego fine    Again much mess up?  All plate it   Now service   server very polite nor he all attentive any way shape form   8 30 Thursday night   maybe 4 tables there   He ended having large party 12 half way through meal   took while drinks first place   Which funny bar right next but he no where found   never refill   wine glass sat empty over 15 minutes too   He walked many times too   He acted if he couldn't cared less   He could made some money off table but let slip away   When discovered hot piquillo's pushed them side   He came collect plates tell take them off bill he no clue   suppose wasn't obvious didn't eat any them   Finally he asked if wanted some refills   Where Denny's?  No want another glass wine but wanted over quarter hour ago   point sheer disappointment food lack service set all wanted leave   fact couldn't wait there   hardly ever happens me     Oh interior   Don't even started that   trying hard mod interior those dowdy curtains windows   Yuck  <EOR> This place wasn't bad   Enjoyed 1st glasses mojitos sangria but pitched blackberry cherry sangria seemed seriously lacking booze department   I think actually MORE sober drinking it None foods particularly outstanding but none bad all   tandoori calamari a ridiculous name just fried calamari w curry powder them nothing w oven dates which weren't good Firefly lobster gazpacho nice presentation very tasty rolled eggplant dish just small lasagna but tasty   The staff extremely attentive  almost point funny but fine   If comeback again   I would w more lobster dishes instead standard tapas fare bring few more people could sit couches  <EOR>
