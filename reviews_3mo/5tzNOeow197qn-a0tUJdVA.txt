If see guy parked shopping center near you  do yourself favor stop by!! <EOR> The food around UNLV generally pretty terrible  Whenever heads there's new spot vicinity usually first give shot  Even 100+ degree heat couldn't stop stumbling in    I wasn't expecting much random food truck but reading menu place wasn't messing around  some legit food just some standard run of the mill snack bar food  wide range wraps tacos hot dogs salads custom burgers ranging Hawaiian burgers turkey boca   Prices weren't bad either  $5 walked two generously sized blackened mahi mahi tacos which awesome  should added some sweet potato fries extra $1 but guess that'll another time   The only downside walking through scalding heat reach place  There's no AC around your best bet arrive car eat carside AC blaring  most part truck seems stationed mainly across street UNLV car wash lot  Occasionally special occasion needs catered but see truck fairly often  check Facebook page http www facebook com pages Las Vegas NV Curbside Cafe 129298443760458 good update schedules locations   If see place definitely stop try it  Sure isn't much buzz around truck Slider Truck Fuku Burger but food definitely keep coming back to  <EOR> You mean tandoori chicken sandwich mango chutney TRUCK?
