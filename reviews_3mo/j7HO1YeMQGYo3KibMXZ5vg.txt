Yum! <EOR> Finally Hawaiian spot South Summerlin!    I little afraid try place   location previously inhabited two failed Mexican restaurants   figured spot must cursed  But rejoice all think place last      Although sparse plain cafe serves some pretty decent Hawaiian fare   menu nowhere near large places Island Flavor Aloha Kitchen but seem handle classics  If you're looking Lau Lau however you're luck   I tried Kalua Pork Cabbage $10 95 which came two scoops rice mac salad  Unfortunately found rice tad wet mushy   Maybe need new rice cooker?  But otherwise thought pork cabbage divinely moist flavorful   Just add little Hawaiian chili water dig in   also appreciated macaroni salad wasn't caked mayo   I also ordered spam musubi which came freshly made piping hot   would definitely order again it pretty big brick $2 00   Prett eh tasty   I'm gonna keep fingers crossed start serving Lau Lau hint hint nudge nudge Kauai Cafe   Then trouble  <EOR> Yay!
