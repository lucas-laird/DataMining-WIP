When working office area most frequent dining experiences   Wendy's scores major points because drive thru lines fastest business  More often served promptly correctly   Even restaurant usually true  However restaurant seem difficult time telling difference between milk Frostys Frosty Shakes  Numerous occasions ordered Frosty Shake only them try give regular Frosty pick window least occasion standoffish when explained them  Other times ordered chocolate milk respond something kind Frosty did want? NEVER once used word Frosty   Despite rant good does outweigh bad particular location  Just damn sure your order right before drive off  <EOR>
