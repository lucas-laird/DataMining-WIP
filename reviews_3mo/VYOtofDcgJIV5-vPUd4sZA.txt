It's pizza duh awesome  Good very friendly management  Can't complain  <EOR> It $5 pizza buffet! course crap but into place knowing that  typically 5 6 different types pizzas sitting counter any time but they're pretty much just different combinations same ingredients  only good pizza pepperoni deep dish pizza but usually soon put gone  When pizza want request few slices next comes they'll give big ass orange safety cone type thing put your table  don't know why but don't that  essentially buffet regular order when you're typically waiting 5 8 minutes next pizza come because probably don't throw oven until current least half done    They also some brownies some cinnamon roll pizza thing some pasta think soup they're all crappy  Everything taste some generic brand stuff Costco's frozen food section  really very good but around $7 unlimited pizza drink sometimes all need  <EOR>
