This real hip looking restuarant price tag it   bad but service only o k  such upscale place  busboys actually more efficient waiter busy looking lost  He didn't really seem well versed menu something just expect fine dining establishment  ambience place cool restrooms funny sounds really quite pretty maybe  why girls few tables over kept visiting it  Everything la carte if order steak gotta pay sides  sides large enough share  also set menu your choice salad kobe beef salmon 2 sides dessert which creme brulee could smoother  Overall decent food but service lacking  <EOR>
