We walked over Paris Las Vegas Bally's found Steakhouse    vegetarian asked whether if he would taken care hostess assured he would   But comes ordering waiter no idea even though hostess said she checked told he order any side dishes no pasta no mixed veggie plate just side dishes    Ok know Steakhouse but asked before seating!  The foie gras ordered appetizer much more veiny would liked    definitely much better   steak great but good less expensive later tasted Bouchon   norms most Steakhouses order all sides steak came nothing except few things veggie    The other problem first ordered petit sirah then zin zin way sweet second wine petit sirah way dry first    sommelier said nothing against ordering in fact suggested second wine good second wine    Anyhoo probably won't going back considering thousands excellent restaurants Vegas  <EOR>
