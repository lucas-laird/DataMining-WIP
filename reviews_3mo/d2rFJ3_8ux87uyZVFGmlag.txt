I'm surprised no one's bothered review place  even Vegas nor did actually eat anything here!  That disclaimer aside giving three stars based following *The waiter may understood 'vegan' meant when trying explain why wasn't going couldn't order anything but ridiculously kind even offered bring bowl grapes   *The BF discovered unlike all IHOPs CA IHOP no vegetarian omelet menu nor avocado ingredient create your own department  he order country omelet substitute tomatoes ham  waiter looked confused but did best accommodate him   *Dirty bathroom  Ewww     *Cherry Diet Coke = Yay! <EOR>
