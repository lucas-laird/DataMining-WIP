I know probably wondering McDonald's four star rating quite honest thinking same thing  However explain  numerous times convenient easy way grab quick meal pretty good iced coffee  Usually lenghty line drive through but always seems quick  lastest visit no exception  getting sample Mighty Wings earlier day made mind early grab some dinner  simply amazed much better could ever imagined  three piece cost three bucks but less expensive buy bigger quantity  When window asked pull off side wings done yet  waited only short time before wings came hot fresh  given coupon free order fries next visit result having wait  offered coupon every time wait which cannot said other establishments  would highly recommend Mighty Wings give high praise local Mickey D's fast friendly service during dinner rush  <EOR>
