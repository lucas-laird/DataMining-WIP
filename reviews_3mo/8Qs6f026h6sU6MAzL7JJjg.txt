FINALLY! Great pho summer rolls  Nice atmosphere clean friendly staff  <EOR> A few years ago started short lived Bun Bo Hue kick  Coincidentally catalyst reading T's review original Viet Bistro location  tried few around town enjoyed them varying degrees but think favorites Viet Bistro former Bosa 1   So think appropriate first thing tried new Viet Bistro BBH  Dare say might best ever had  no idea if authentic  just know enjoyed all way down empty bowl   It's certainly perfect  starters broth more sweet spicy  sure if non Viet treatment if  is  Digging old review BBH north wasn't spicy either  time around made sure specifically ask pork hock  their menu actually states pork hock only included request   One thing don't BBH noodles  thicker aren't easy eat compared pho noodles  Last night noodles seemed overcooked point falling apart  But strangely made them easier eat worked great!  There aren't really any pho places Summerlin area  news Viet Bistro opening part town highly welcomed quick jaunt down 215  solid BBH checked off list eager explore rest menu  <EOR> Food good authentic  less star because staff seemed struggling little amount customers <EOR> I've looking good Vietnamese restaurant close south Summerlin area   remembered opened shopping center near Grand Canyon Flamingo but couldn't remember name it   After trying number web searches finally found adjacent Sushi Tower restaurant because Viet Bistro could found when Googled search Vietnamese restaurants near 89135   finally found sister Viet Bistro restaurant which provide location Grand Canyon well phone number    I finally found location food very good did nice job interior restaurant   wouldn't normally waste much time looking restaurant but no other Vietnamese restaurants within reasonable proximity      With difficulty trying find information Viet Bistro location including address online menu would bit concerned may business very long   I truly wish them success recommend them also suggestion specifically web site some visibility people find try your restaurant! <EOR> After enjoying original Viet Bistro location Lake Meade pleased see new location open West Summerlin    The food excellent   Seasoned Beef Roll Betel Leaf appetizer delicious roll your own style ask them pre rolled  favorite dishes here   I'm huge fan Vietnamese vermicelli bowls Viet Bistro always prepares them perfectly  Noodles cooked just right meat well trimmed marinated vegetables crisp aromatic herbs fresh  bowls much even tried pho yet   I'm taking star off because service location pretty much non existent   guy took order disappeared into back never came back out  food brought another guy talking phone while he handed plates  dude stayed phone entire time there  He brought check while still talking away phone   If place act together service would easy 5 stars  Hopefully experience just off  <EOR> This places hidden gem! NO other close pho places ginger lemonade tea AMAZING <EOR>
