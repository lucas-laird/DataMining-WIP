Young Special Roll super white tuna salmon    flavor very good texture even better melts your mouth !    Grilled sea bass   Absolutely delicious!  might've tiny tiny bit salty the chef could've used less sauce but overall fresh flavorful perfectly cooked buttery texture   I'd prefer bigger thicker chunk wouldn't but decent size price   Yellowtail Collar   Very good!  Grilled sea bass definitely stole spotlight but collar pretty good well terms both size taste   Some parts just silky buttery sea bass while other parts little bit dry which uncommon   Fried Noodle Vegetables little bit salty saucy but did taste mushroom egg noodle cooked well  <EOR> This new place opened while back sold when saw sushi sign  came last weekend ordered large variety items  Everything really good really cheap  really really cheap  Even better  All food very fresh tasty  Since live close sure we'll back often  <EOR> I love trying new sushi place  wished bit better me   Armed Amazon deal purchased $20 $40 worth food arrived dinner Saturday night  very busy     Our server sushi chef friendly helpful  looked menus handed monitor set pictures showing slideshow sushi selections asked rolls  server knew some yet still turned ask most asked sushi chef  guess new menu new them too   ??
