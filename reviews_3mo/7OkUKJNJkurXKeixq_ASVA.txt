I'm celiac but wife GF pizza base let say quite incredible crust   tried many GF pizzas majority them dry crumbly thin rock hard   exactly pizza crust should crispy outside chewy inside good bite   All ingredients top notch nice talk owner apparently trained CIA     also Fricos starter which excellent import cheese Italy it   Many other dishes looked tasty but wait next Vegas trip  <EOR> I quite enjoy food here  quite tasty  However terribly overpriced  But yeah understand OMG Fresh scratch ingredients! Yeah  great all but 16 pizza $20 just doesn't really happy    Although pizza amazing   The other problem service tad bit slow don't just mean waiting your fresh scratch food  mean getting more water soda seeing if need any condiments etc    Those two things really keep giving place 4 5  But other recommend coming here  decent lunch special  comperable other pizza joint's around town quality probably even better here  <EOR>
