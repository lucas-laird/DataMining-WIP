This place gotten new name paint job some giant cards wall last year  Welcome Aces! Yeah know original name giant food court Las Vegas Convention Center  feel sarcasm?  I've eating place since South Hall opened but review new location  much changed! still giant salad bar middle lunch time fresh fruit yogurt oatmeal cereal breakfast time  Fruit costs $1 50 per piece  know but remember convention center  Salads come large small only pay cram there  good bonus those know pack really well! only thing new management added giant rope around whole thing which even more confusing  really hate it  no room pass wait behind indecisive people large bags full literature they never read shoulders  really love that! Again more sarcasm!!!  The food okay   runny eggs morning overcooked burgers afternoon  sandwich shop good  also Asian option pizza option too  pizza slices pretty large greasy  noticed seems new refrigerated case some grab items  think great idea because lines lunch time control   Once into Aces line every food station prepared wait  Oh yeah more ropes too  fact set switchback tight could hardly down  fact gave around entered front  people line laughing hard because made some funny comment it  all said made right choice going way wished chosen route prior arrival   The food great  really try stick fresh salads fruit least know wont bloating 10 000+ milligrams sodium  FYI many options around  gone over hotel quality little better  Sometimes just hop monorail head towards strip off first stop find better option  place convience would never eat choice   My rating quality choice food  employees always seem really good  just keep working away trying but fighting losing battle  review rating them fact would give workers 5 stars   Also room really big always find place  usually always end sharing table others  call European rules here   so sit new people share table friends!!! <EOR>
