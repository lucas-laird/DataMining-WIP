Landed needed some food but fast food walked around decided joint  build your own sandwich only $9 99 which isn't bad when other places selling sell them higher price same but less food pre made  also some sandwich combos pre set should building much  <EOR> The gobbler earl sandwich's thanksgiving sub  pricey $11 just smallish sandwich but pretty good  menu incomplete staff seem pretty downtrodden struggle bit  no complaints but probably wouldn't back  <EOR>
