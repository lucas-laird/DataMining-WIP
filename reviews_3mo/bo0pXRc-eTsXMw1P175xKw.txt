This small cafe type restaurant Rio Hotel   food ok nothing write home but wasn't expensive service pretty quick actually veg option   believe Tofu menu   great served lots baby bok choy but vegetarian   easy find Vegas   back next morning I meeting breakfast   Service fast courteous breakfast breakfast  <EOR> Ugh underwhelming food served captive audience  I thought eating would spare dregs convention luncheon fare  convention luncheon fare except pay it   You probably cannot wrong standard burgers 'n shit but steer well clear spaghetti meatballs fruit plate  Don't even *look* pseudo chinese food list back side menu  $11 congee?? Come on   Now didn't order spag meatballs business partner  He's young guy sometimes young guys aren't picky long full  But even he told afterwards food really bad  I fruit plate exactly convention fruit plates  Crunchy cantaloupe browning bananas tasteless strawberries   But no other place time eat   Finally business partner thought staff working seemed little lackluster  said eyes showed soul crushing disappointment neverending tedium serving cafeteria food profession desperate gamblers exhausted convention goers  Maybe same lackluster but try creative   Oh water glass silverware smelled eggs  <EOR>
