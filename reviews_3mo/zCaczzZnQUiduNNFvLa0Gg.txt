Ah interactive dinner theater   Some say where actors die   Well Vegas      it holds true  almost died TNT 2 years   it almost devoured soul   But review isn't body work let's move shall we? Tony Tina's credit oldest piece interactive theater around still going strong   tickets tend little pricey $125 pop but local deals just check box office   food bit dull side but much want   Buffet style all way   On bright side   going big fat Italian wedding hang some really funny actors   ready dance then dance some more   But opera really play matter   Don't expect master piece Amadeus proportions but    do expect bride slapped priest drunk gay brother prance    and maybe if you're lucky someone Chicken Dance all over your face  <EOR> I once while dear friend Damon it   He fell conked himself head backstage disappeared halfway through show   would say if weren't worried would more engaged show however don't think would been   It's no doubt fun but coming theatrical background kind seems improv game gone awry   But most improv games don't all eat Italian buffet!  Again flip side food really isn't all good   It's bad show but definitely glad didn't shell money it  <EOR>
