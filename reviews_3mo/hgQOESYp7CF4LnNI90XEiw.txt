Textural violation number 2 night  Flavorwise okay but nothing special  truffle bit understated while eating pizza   There 2 problems because pizzas fired correctly anymore crust would burnt   crust issue much toppings  vote amount toppings because edge crust fine   The Caesar horrible  Probably worst Caesar long time  very weird fruity aroma permeated throughout salad  think maybe type cheese used  maybe some other elements another salad mixed in  Whatever very off putting  didn't taste any garlic anchovies dressing all  red leaf lettuce threw became limp quickly acidity dressing having much dressing  Textural violation number 3 it's hat trick!
