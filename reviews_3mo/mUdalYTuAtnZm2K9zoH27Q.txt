You cannot level service Vegas eateries   Everyone attitude free prompt knowledgeable   especially impressed wtih service L'atelier   bf 10 course tasting menu excellent   can't mashed potatoes     addicitive! came hanger steak but he quail stuffed foie gras AMAZING  foie gras ravioli chicken broth  basil      stil thinking it   chocolate peanut butter dessert won't disappoint   Although sushi bar idea neat didn't care red black decor   three courses shared dessert bf's tasting menu but could just 2 courses full  <EOR> My crew Club Menu supplemented some fois gras   am huge egg fan egg thing didn't much me   main course ribeye melt your mouth good   still feel famous mashed potatoes arteries   well worth though     array tarts desert incredible   Fantastic service   place bit cramped found   can't wait try restaurant next door   16 course tasting anyone? <EOR> Ok ultra fabulous suite Venetian Hotel Thursday night  But instead being going buck wild hung lo style all over town decided share experience L'Atelier fellow yelpers woo you!    First off dig decor   Very dark chic trendy cool think best describes it   However don't sushi themed tables where forced sit bar   Although comfortable very good intimate conversations playing footsie matter   Second food good great   sorry but if some think  best tasting menu you've ever then you've all wrong restaurants   food good but best dish cocotte egg parsley puree mushroom foam sauteed chantrelles   quail also hit served soy chicken demi sauce or least  think tastes like truffled mashed potatoes Joel Robuchon known potatoes signature dishes basically your basic pommes puree equal amount french butter added it   awesome but sickeningly fatty  micro green salad truffle vinaigrette  Other good dishes include Poached kumamoto oysters poached butter lemon chives sea salt   Strawberry milkshake strawberry sherbet fresh strawberries pistachio crisps   Not good the Assortment ice creams sherbets waiter failed identify   The grilled Santa Barbara Prawns Romesco Sauce just didn't feel real romesco imho    and  The scallop carpaccio lemon marmalade the marmalade great soy evo pepper   So ask 'Hung if food good why only 3 stars?'   Well if you'd just wait minute I'd tell you   Service  Service  Service   The bill came 300 dollars two cocktail water   being said service should par true french restaurant   waiters should snobby unprofessional unenthusiastic cold answered questions short remarks   The conclusion back?  No   But am glad instead initial plans which visit Joel Robuchon's Mansion next door where average dinner two runs grand   won't revisiting L'Atelier because cuisine Asian me   If going laying kind dough which equivalent 15 lap dances Spearmint Rhino street should eating food know nothing enjoying hell it   includes eating quail entree served sauce grandmother used back home   So those two cents Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier take leave   AFK now time party! <EOR>
