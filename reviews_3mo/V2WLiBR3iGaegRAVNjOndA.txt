At first didn't think Panda Express in PH's Miracle Mile Shops even warranted review but am still dissatisfied need write this   I Vegas past weekend know you're thinking Why would waste precious stomach real estate something Panda Express when tons delicious buffets around?! answer DONT KNOW T___T Actually because friends grab something quick leave before traffic bad which did anyway    First prices already little higher LA  paid could gotten sandwich Earl's would actually made happy    Second food sucks  actually Panda time time but chow mein bland kung pao chicken bland even spicy fried rice tasted nothing!! I rather eat dirt! orange chicken ok  Seriously love eating but meal brought no joy no marginal utility I'm econ major     Third workers monotonous mediocre  No smiles  Just pack your food ask your money send your way  Vegas place waste time money Panda Express   I heard insult ask soy sauce because implies cooking seasoning your standard  put some soy sauce least tasted something just salty but still   UGH don't think dissatisfied meal long  <EOR>
