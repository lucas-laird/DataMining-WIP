Starting noodles  Friend ordered beef noodle dont remember exact name   bad  slight numbing would typical sichuan restaurants special combination spices use create numbing effect   Reason why said slight because kind slight  strong should but its good start  other noodle ordered Dan Dan Mein   decent  made slightly different ive used which dry noodle not soup which their's was thick sauce coating all noodles numbing spices  bad though    Next thing lunch special  $10 2 dishes your choice vegetable egg roll bowl rice  Portion quite large depending big eater could possibly share it  few dishes tried ranging cashew chicken beijing style pork twice cooked pork eggplant green bean   All pretty good   few mentioned probably liked eggplant most  Flavorful soft  Green bean could slightly better slightly underseasoned   well underseasoned but flavors weren't mixed evenly  cooked minced pork believe   pork salty but green bean slightly bland    One thing noticed overall dishes things ordered visit slightly salty side    Design restaurant simple overly decorated  Slight contemporary design    Overall pretty good place minor cons but would stop friends visiting again soon =] Legit reason ditching Panda Express ! Haha ! <EOR> Update 04 14 2011 3 times last 8 days   Zha Jiang Mian favorite far  HeHe   Update 04 28 2011 If large group friends each order different dish you'll taste lot more Sichuan ness you'll probably end paying less lunch special  D <EOR> It's closest best Chinese food near UNLV  really sick tired all food around area   prices notch higher but portions big   I really Chongqing spicy chicken   another restaurant chicken Chinatown Plaza but closed  Theirs better but least found replica! cheap though   I might around trying more menu when next semester starts but give try! waiter always super nice  Don't know name but they're all friendly! <EOR> Came lunch boyfriend since right next campus!
