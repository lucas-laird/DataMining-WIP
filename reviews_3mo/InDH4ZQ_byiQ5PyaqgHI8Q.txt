Who resist going place called Big Mama's Rib Shack ?  couldn't!  love some barbecue especially ribs!  Located near Rancho 95 excited try place!  ordered full slab ribs fried chicken dinner   ordered greens yams hush puppies macaroni cheese   Big Mama must've because she probably wouldn't approved quality food put day   greens yams macaroni cheese decent hush puppies salty fried chicken pretty tasty   But place called Big Mama's Rib Shack Big Mama's Chicken House   ribs such disappointment!  only teeth ripping tough obviously least day old reheated not very well    ribs most warm 85 degrees   I'm sure health department wouldn't approve     The fried chicken actually very good but does warrant extra star?  Hmmm   it's supposed rib place think not  <EOR>
