Anyways imagine your Japanese tea garden   at night  pink orange purple sunset occasional fireworks display  stream bridge lots cherry blossom trees  actual dining area  inside house which inside inside outside tea garden overlooking stream  hostess dressed full kimono attire escorts your table  Other all just regular old Benihana    <EOR>
