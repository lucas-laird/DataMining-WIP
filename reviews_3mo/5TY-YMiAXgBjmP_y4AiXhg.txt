Tucked away Santa Fe Station food court Capriotti's seemed best choice all food options there  usually back forth between Bobbie Capistrami time wanted hot sandwich Capistrami before going movies  combination contrast hot pastrami combined cold slaw russian dressing addicting sandwich take bite another until no more!  I ended sneaking other half sandwich because weren't keeping track time didn't wanna end junk seats great sandwich prefer any day over bucket outrageously priced popcorn fake butter   ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE 150 365 The Smuggled Sandwich <EOR> Not really into sandwich places but Santa Fe Station hungry followed friend's advice tried it  all food choices did seem most interesting one   Got Capastrami must say nothing short amazing  Juicy without being sloppy in fact sloppiness all just right amount dressings meat  pastrami itself flavorful juicy hint fresh spices serving very generous  Next time try Bobbie which most famous sandwich told tastes Thanksgiving dinner sandwich form    The prices bit high side paid $9 5 it might always table sit but should prevent anyone trying especially if happen Santa Fe Station  <EOR>
