I am giving place 1 star very good reason   place twice now approx 2 3 weeks apart way work very early morning  Once inside once drive thru   think same person take order both times   Well BOTH times order messed up   screw breakfast?????  First time told wanted new egg white mcmuffin white cheese even POINTED huge pictures displayed wall want sausage   When opened american cheese it     When 2nd time drive thru ordered sausage egg biscuit sausage egg white muffin white cheese hashbrown  buy coupon total only $2 40 knew right then he messed up   Sure enough pay open bag canadian bacon sandwich instead sausage no egg sausage egg biscuit     Both times only person there  I'd hate see kind mistakes when busy     GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!! Making breakfast sandwich isn't rocket science  !!!! <EOR> Ran through drive thru today way work much advertised Egg White Delight McMuffin    250 calories 7 grams fat! versus regular Egg McMuffin 300 calories 12 grams fat Oh hells yes!   am HUGE fan Egg McMuffin excited try one   If only McDonalds would serve breakfast sandwiches all time just morning whole darn world would brighter!  Sigh!  think need start petition!  Anyways back sandwich   egg fluffy light airy   Totally expected but hugely amazed good was   wasn't dry thought would be   cheese white cheese versus American cheese Egg McMuffin   didn't notice much different   Overall Egg White Delight probably better Egg McMuffin   Ooops shhhhh did just say that?
