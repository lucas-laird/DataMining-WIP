I love innovative food  hate mindnumbing bar food  delighted find little tucked away Israeli restaurant middle Summerlin   The place would really cute except they've some harshest most glaring lights ever seen restaurant  might okay lunch but dinner  Hey owners! Ever hear dimmer switch?! First highlight bread! all homemade warm lovely  also split order Greekplant which thin slices eggplant wrapped around cheese pesto grilled sweet potatoes delightful   For main course ordered Halumi salad which comes Mushroom red bell peppers scallions spinach cherry tomatoes over baby mixed greens all sauteed light soy dijon  topped halumi cheese deep fried   But halumi cheese promised would wonderful feta  loved first many bites but somehow continued eat taste became cloying  could enjoy half portion sandwich but wouldn't order main course again  Also $13 99 even though portion large seemed expensive was   My date Tuna salad Fresh mix greens topped corn cherry tomatoes avocado onions egg home made albacore white tuna  unusual pink color   not sure why  very decent but something I'd way eat again   Overall if you're tired same old bar food give Panini Cafe try  I'd back explore menu bit further  <EOR>
