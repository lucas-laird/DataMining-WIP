Wow   if wasn't truffled blue cheese potato chips appetizer would worst dining experiences ever   chips where best ever   paper thin curly salty    For main course ordered sea scallops spinach over mushroom risotto ponzu sauce   Sounded good   When dish came tasted risotto first   crunchy undercooked   Then moved scallop aside cut see compared   No sooner bite mouth looked down saw green worm yes dead grub thing spinach   felt going hurl   Companion says Just stick your bread plate eat around it  WTF does that?    When waitresses attention she asked if anything else she could reordered   Then new meal came out steak medium instead medium rare   fingerling potatoes bitter   No manager chef ever came over table   Naturally meal comped     I really wanted place   try showcase organic ingredients  interior crisp servers very inviting   know stupid things happen   If risotto properly cooked steak right temp if chef apologized then maybe could give place another chance     Maybe just having off day  <EOR>
