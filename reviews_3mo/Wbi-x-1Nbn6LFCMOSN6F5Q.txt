Went lunch friend   ordered Nachos no meat   pretty large serving came topped Cheese Beans Sour Cream Guacamole Salsa Rice   I surprised put rice Nachos   never eaten Nachos rice before   bad   thought rice bland didn't add flavor but gave interesting texture it   requested spiciest salsa but wasn't spicy all    I guess most Gringos   thought Pinto beans ok but could used little more flavor   chips home made but good quality   Overall bad   My friend Barbacoa Pork Burrito    the portion huge!  He liked alot   One cool thing large selection Hot Sauce   tried few really spicy ones packed some punch   curious burritos tacos try them if eat again   Will return?  some point probably    but 1st 2nd choice  <EOR>
