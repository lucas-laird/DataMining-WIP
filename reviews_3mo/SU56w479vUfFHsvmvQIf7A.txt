I only lunch buffet seems they're going quality over quantity   many choices buffet but ones did all tasty   Hooray white meat chicken!! <EOR> After being disappointed Capriotti's Sahara closed walked around came across restaurant  When first saw store front listed dinner buffet 5pm 10pm woo hoo! But when walked turns didn't buffet dinner at least night came minus star false advertising!    It's okay though because ended ordering Vegetarian Thali which almost mini buffet itself Palak Paneer Channa Masala Rice Pakora Naan    Kheer! all very good! especially liked Channa Masala   The interior restaurant clean well lit  Service attentive always full glass water  <EOR>
