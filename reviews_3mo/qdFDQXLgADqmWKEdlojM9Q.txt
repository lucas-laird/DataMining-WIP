This restaurant pretty new  used serve free milk tea your orders  offer now gone  several times tried most foods  find portion really small items mostly over priced  food pretty good though  only few items worth money Lunch Box Rice Taiwan Sausage Rice  rice noodles even enough feed petite girl $6 99 tiny plate! shaved ice $7 00! OMG! I would again free milk tea but offer valid anymore am going back unless lower prices  way many good restaurants Las Vegas lot larger portions! Hopefully read review revise Portion Price! <EOR> First all place spells chicken chichen    Anyway    The food mediocre  bland took forever  pepper salt chicken tasted literally ass      They also kept restaurant EXTREMELY hot  restaurant definitely warmer outside night Las Vegas   which saying lot  tried eat but because uncomfortable hot inside place   Their prices also freaking ridiculous    expensive bland food aint even good! <EOR> So far twice love food! Taiwan taste home   Service great! Fast! Hospitable! very generous when asked some clear soup  menu gave free but good portion bowl soup  glad there's more place could when miss food home! <EOR> They don't turn ac  Instead use ghetto fan cool entire restaurant   The service horrible  Instead making sure each table okay would rather chat amongst themselves  If plan asking multiple times napkins other stuff then come here  Even if remember give napkins they'll only give two  order wrong multiple times  Even when taking order impatient waiting decide wanted   Do order any kind rice dish  Also order any kind boba drink  In summary come eat   Bad service lousy food no ac  <EOR> First all just wanted thank Amanda M turning Little Kitchen Cafe which cool little restaurant serves popular Taiwanese food desserts   They opened almost two months but must avoiding Chinatown Plaza completely clueless new spot decent Taiwanese comfort foods various shaved ice snow ice desserts   operated Taiwanese business owner staff authentic Taiwanese restaurant biz   Most probably professional wait staff years experience but friendly courteous   On first currently only visit only ordered 3 items still lot more menu explore     1   Pork Nugget Rice Noodle  popular comfort food Taiwan which usually least once when back Taiwan   flavor familiar would say decent but only because tried vendors restaurants known serving best Taipei entire island country   But without having fly across Pacific least driving Monterey Park bad   Portion large   Price seems high item but lot it   Good sharing others family style try more things   2   Pork Crispy Roll crispy exterior roll but again just average appetizer me  Hitting best best item Taiwan ruined me!  3   Milk Snow Ice correct texture   Just already superior imitation snow cream Kuma just down street supposedly invented just Al Gore invented Internet local celebrity chef since moved himself SoCal   Snow Ice 7 flavors Taiwanese shaved ice smoothies plus toppings dessert  $3 75 $7   7 22 2013 Update   group could ordered more items split family style   very accommodating food came pretty fast   Almost fast all foodies take pictures everything ordered before portioning everyone   All rice dishes served Taiwanese pickled napa cabbage similar Korean kimchi but done day without fermentation process hard boiled egg simmered soy minced pork   Pork Chop Rice traditional bento box offering travelers back days 20 30+ years ago traveling train bus across island   pretty good would order again   Taiwanese Style Sausage Good but prefer cooked little more slightly crispier exterior   Spicy Wontons good but all agreed could spicier   Minced Pork over Rice Very popular Taiwanese comfort food but also very hard really good   version okay   Salt Pepper Chicken   Taiwanese version more popcorn chicken Taiwanese style salt pepper seasoning   Fried Rice Noodle   Another traditional dish popular Taiwan   good item order sharing group   Matcha Shaved Snow + Red Bean   traditional flavor combination decent   green tea flavor pronounced Frost Bites their version king    Peanut Shaved Snow + Boba   liked roasted peanut flavor infused into milk before mixture frozen  Boba alright   Blueberry Shaved Snow   Texture creamier rest almost gelato like grape flavor   Nelson Q suggests having Peanut Shaved Ice PB J flavor combo   Taro Shaved Snow + Taro   Mild taro flavor real taro boost taro powder that color just purple all nature but think most agree only item where people prefer powder base flavoring over all natural   Mango Shaved Snow +Mango   Pretty good  big pieces mango although some still semi frozen when made its way around table back us   Based above think 3 5 stars   P S   AC issue mentioned previous reviews resolved time visit     P P S   friendly American Express card holders   $10 minimum paying credit debit card  <EOR> 4 people $70  worth it   I come vegas almost annually restaurants change frequently  Simply put They taiwanese food bad taiwanese food  There four ordered 2 same things 2 different dishes  Portions small taste only average   My noodles came really quick     the other same order noodles didn't come until everything else came out  Everything else including dishes came taken back then brought back again because order confused  when eating noodles ton corn starch clumps both bowls  Corn starch ingredient garnish  We actually told bowl came ran thanks telling old soup making fresh pot   Here's temperature problem  only 10 degrees higher restaurant outside  if you're looking sweat pregnant nun overpay proceed  wouldn't surprised if gone trip next year  <EOR> We stumbled upon place when couldn't find something wanted eat open late  Little Kitchen small restaurant limited seating  sells Taiwan dishes shaved ice drinks   husband island Taiwan whenever he finds place sells Taiwanese food try out  husband fan Taiwanese meatball  small dish outside coated translucent dough meatball inside  hard find place special dish correctly even all  He tried come back two days row     One things would change dessert menu English Chinese  hard order if can't read Chinese but use photos choose want try out  shaved ice really good  soft melts your mouth  icy tried other places past   condensed milk along pudding great    portions shaved ice large compared would find San Francisco Bay Area      If place opened closer home would regulars  <EOR> More 3 5 star   Earl came dinner last night literally around neighborhood 3 times before finding it   First all address 4215 vs  4250   located next Mother's Korean Grill inside shopping square where see 99 Ranch Market   call confirm address   Anywho when seated promptly   recommendation lady owner cook won ton noodle soup pork chop rice crispy chicken roll   She doesn't speak English very well but she point point help another gentleman works made decision  won ton noodle soup clean broth won tons deliciously handmade   don't care noodles  pork chop rice underneath tender pork chop slices minced pork   boiled egg over boiled super dry   comes picked mustard greens kim chi  crispy chicken roll favorite evening   roll slightly crisp outside flavorful inside   also came kim chi   salty sweet tangy order   When requested check lady owner asked No ice? said no because full   Though $7ish small bowl ice doesn't sound valuable deal      The meal cost $24   Overall think decent place decent Taiwanese food  <EOR> I attended Tony T 's UYE last night enjoyed food lot   shared 7 main dishes 5 shaved snow desserts   winning dish last night salt pepper fried chicken   dish salty somewhat spicy cayenne pepper sprinkled chicken pieces   terrific   The Taiwanese style sausage minced pork rice very good   addition cuttlefish noodle soup also very enjoyable  spicy wontons good but spice level low really very spicy   For dessert ordered 5 different kinds snow ice brought each flavor time which then spooned into dishes     Going group perfect!  chance taste lot food   Going alone another person would limit could try because portions large     Service very good owners small restaurant very accommodating   Having Tony T  big plus because he could explain some dishes conversant Chinese helped ordering process   I'll returning   own order salt pepper chicken  <EOR> So really 3 5 stars me      The good 1  Tasty braised pork minced pork nice mix veggies pickled veggies  2  Peanut snow ice egg pudding surprisingly good combo  fluffy snow ice good    but best had  3  Pork belly sandwich bao per friends minus sweet sour sauce inside   The bad 1  Poor organization    they come back table tally dishes afterwards since few items menu seemed forget bring some dishes   but party nine  2   Mango funny taste snow ice    I stopped eating piece made note owner  3  Portion size small minced pork rice    carnivores beware! If meat order pork chop rice much better value your money  4  Confusing menu enough explanation ABCers illiterate Chinese   The okay 1  brought new snow ice mentioned funny mango taste   asked mango snow minus fresh mango but came peanut snow ice instead     the lady working little bit food nazi   She also picked replacement dish friend   well he sort bullied since she rapidly speaking Mandarin pointing he didn't understand he just ended nodding head     2   brought sample sticky rice cupcake friend bullied since finished cooking later meal   and  he originally ordered   FYI same owner old Noodle Pot few stores down   they apparently sold restaurant opened one   AC works but very strong    I think past reviews regarding no AC personal choice owners but rather AC working stores plaza since Mr  Sandwich same issue around time  <EOR> It's surprisingly easy overlook small unassuming cafe  When arrived Chinatown Plaza friend looked around few times realized right front us! Little Kitchen Cafe between Mr  Sandwich Noodle Pot   Upon walking you'll greeted friendly waiters ensure you're taken care whole time  Placing order simple marking number next entrees you'd like!   Their Taiwanese menu includes some appetizers such wontons crispy rolls entrees noodle soups  Each rice entree heaping pile rice topped minced pork side greens pickled veggies overcooked soy sauce egg  recommendations include braised pork Taiwanese sausage salt pepper fried chicken   The shaved snow small avalanche soft layered ice cream topped off fruit condensed milk  fluffy texture spot unlike thick gooey snow other places  created own dessert ordered blueberry shaved snow kiwi condensed milk pudding top  Extra toppings $0 50 each   While food pretty standard shaved snow best find along Spring Mountain  should bring some friends help dig through mountains food dessert  least if you're sharing  <EOR> If read original review may read some humorous venting  playing nice removed first paragraph Located main part Chinatown same plaza 99 Ranch Market but more center near Mother's Korean Grill  isn't big sign but if you're passing may run into elderly Asian woman inviting in  service entrees good no complaints  But you'll probably stop mainly desserts  cold very tasty shaved snow  Besides Frost Bites Shavery which changing name SnowFlake Shavery!? probably only other place Vegas I'd highly recommend shaved snow treats   bunch combinations flavors shaved snow toppings  peanut boba matcha red bean mango mango blue berry condense milk taro taro think mango mango love them all more some   servings shaved snow big inexpensive  Check pictures know want some now too   I guess all 13 wrote review business listing don't know anything better  <EOR> Delicious traditional Taiwanese food very home style food awesome tasty food great service place eat home style cooking must try <EOR> I've place 2 times already  first time last month decent  good but bad  decided take parents give place another chance   regret it!  We ordered Sticky rice cupcake literally MICROWAVED long  Yes    said microwaved  rice became dry crunchy! Gross    Sesame noodles okay better   Pork stew over rice probably only good thing ordered    Stinky tofu took 30min more making it    Half batch freshly fried half old they tried re fry hide oldness Anyways wont back   another disappointing Taiwanese place  rather tea station   <EOR>
