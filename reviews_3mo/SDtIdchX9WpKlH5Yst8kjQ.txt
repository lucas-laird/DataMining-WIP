But think next time just order pick up  Maybe fact just opened but room sitting very limited  There's 8 booths seats 4 table 6  7 someone sit car eat  Yeah     wasn't pleasant  wait food 15 20 minutes ordering  But side everything fresh    Aside really no complaints when came quality taste food  niece sister loved lumpia egg rolls also liked shrimp patty also honorable mention  Perhaps might expand which hope do  garnering alot attention Islander community  wish them best  hope become very successful! definitely come back  for go  LoL <EOR> I'm no expert Chamorro food but say share  quiet few Chamorros friends love cooking!! favorite all time Chamorro food chicken kelaguen  flavor outstanding! When ordered chicken plate which consisted BBQ chicken chicken kelaguen red rice salad finadene  Seriously give half scoop chicken kelaguen!! smallest portion ever!! very disappointed tastey??? much    waaaaaay better!! BBQ chicken just okay    Nothing special    I ordered daughter chicken Nene small mini plate  Tell why daughter more chicken Nene plate regular size plate  only that     friend ordered chicken plate too    Why did she 3 regular size BBQ chickens plate two small pieces?? Very inconsistent!!!!   Also menu offer white rice     But don't ask because don't any  Wasn't sure daughter would red rice attempted order white rice shot down  don't serve it  Also don't ask fountain drink because machine doesn't work  WTH!?   Okay last complaint    guy register still stool!!! Sitting stool leaning arm elbow counter he taking people's orders    Don't know you    But  very unprofessional me  never restaurant where worker sitting stool only leaning all over counter he bored   I lied    more complaint    service    Takes forever! should timed it  But waited pretty lengthy time before getting food    Will return? wouldn't choice    But if friends wanted id again  Other that? No wouldn't  <EOR> Only second time eating Chamorro food no complaints!! fiesta plate could try everything favorite chicken kelaguen!! food overly tasty salty  hit craving perfect  Then coconut titiyas did it! Completed meal  Wasn't super sweet but finished meal just right!!!!! top everything off staff personable friendly  Coming Hawaii used going everywhere getting aloha spirit Red Rice too!!! We'll back <EOR> Im Guam grew Guamanian fiesta food    Definitely best Guam restaurant Vegas yet   kelaguen chopped chicken lemon onions peppers shredded coconut bits good amount heat tang flavor BBQ chicken ribs great marinade properly grilled moist dry Fina'denne' spicy soy sauce vinegar condiment nicely made great flavor perfect amount heat acidity  Red rice great texture flavor just home  empanada filling good spicy but spicy ones can't handle much heat moist tons bursting flavor crystals each bite!

Great portions! Very authentic! A+ customer service! Definitely recommending kind establishment  Great find town! <EOR> Unimpressed 2 5 stars most    The BBQ chicken probably best part plate super juicy delicious charred taste  all downhill there    The BBQ beef extra chewy stringy  the dry side   The pork spare rib lacking flavor same chicken kelaguen    The last Chamorro place vegas closed down much tastier one  place doesn't even come close Chamorro restaurants tried San Diego    Also place called Red Rice  would think red rice would Bomb dot com    But another disappointment  Maybe should've named place BBQ chicken instead because star whole plate  <EOR> I'm familiar flavors Guam looked similar Filipino food but place pretty delicious!  lunch pretty good amount people already sitting restaurant   Ordered Fiesta Plate Beef Plate      The Fiesta Plate way if want try bit everything   awesome!  Especially red rice!  favorite!  empanadas looked good also but we'll save next time   The only reason couldn't give them full 5 stars due wait   ordered must taken close 25 minutes food come out   didn't look anyone really hustling kitchen   Hopefully just due place being really new  I'd come back but we'd definitely call ahead place order  <EOR> Very disappointed ate here  Chicken very dry  Portions very small  Ribs also dry  feels nothing eating back home  <EOR> Service really slow molasses  Some folks kitchen just standing around  cashier only moving fast enough  empanadas crispy good  Red rice tasty chicken kelaguen so so  Nothing special chicken bbq well  All all its ok but all that  <EOR> Wow! need slap someone  next person see need slap!

If able focus just more flavor taste food would very good restaurant  sum all food okay but Guam vibe made experience! restaurant lot potential I'd willing give place another chance  <EOR> One word BOMB  Finally Guam restaurant Vegas  place great customer service good ambiance which feel back home last but least good authentic Chamorro food!
