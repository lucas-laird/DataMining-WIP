Why am only reviewing this?  know others tried it   Fess up!  LBS Patty Wagon back downtown other day Western Cab location swung some burgers   afraid wind people down because order window boarded when there   But removed board took order    This time tried urth slider which would recommend   Dry weird pea flavor   Even if vegetarian no other choice don't it!  Run away!  Just fries   fries spectacular   Huge chunks sea salt give lots fries   sure fry sauce   particularly healthy but oh good   The perfect slider perfect always classic slider great well   three sliders fries drink $9   diet Snapple! <EOR> Tried Californian Perfect yesterday pleasantly impressed! burgers mini but packed full flavor  definitely want try Ahi Shoestring fries next time   I would definitely recommend anyone curious  only downside wait but well worth it  hear restaurant too! Hope able hit sometime near future    The price bad either! <EOR> Finally chance try them Throwdown Fuku Slidin Thru   I ordered Perfect burger which thought pretty good  would give 3 stars but bun weird texture  expecting texture soft spongy but weird can't even explain it  top if off prices pretty pricey which $7 just burger  Sorry but deserve 2 star rating  <EOR> Maybe expectations higher normal LBS Patty Wagon being mobile kitchen extension sit down restaurant inside Red Rock Casino   But trying Perfect Burger thought just okay burger composed more gourmet ingredients i e  frissee gruyere cheese herb mayo compared other food truck burgers sliders offerings   $7 fair value obviously less your money trying other food choices other food trucks   The taste burger somewhat disappointing me   Maybe lot all beef patty being cooked well done which major turnoff right there   But combination beef melting Gruyere Cheese Herb mayo Smoked Bacon LBS Burger Sauce Frissee Oven Roasted Tomatoes Red Onion Marmalade which looks really good paper ended doing anything me   Hell even Carl's Jr's Original Six Dollar Burger better tasting more perfect burger opinion   I probably seek LBS Patty wagon future  However those into budding food truck culture Las Vegas say give try decide yourself   all know dry patty fluke burgers supposed more juicy   The best part LBS Patty Wagon experience sample nitrogen chilled treats   definitely worth trying especially since free   Dessert Slider made macaroons concept think needs refining along flavor profile   2 Stars  <EOR> So FINALLY tracked down truck  seems its always Henderson!? Anyways 4 trucks hanging together afternoon slidin thru sno cone foodslingers lbs  bee lined lbs cuz starving! ordered perfect burger  Oddly enough NO WAIT! but all other trucks did wait which made bit wary lbs  Sno cones understand hot today  But slindin thru foodslingers more busy wondered bit why lbs unloved  Even yummy burger bacon gruyere arugala interesting ketchup yuck! sundried tomatoes  If didn't already know tomatoes cold fresh any other way disgusting  looking places serve steamed tomatoes breakfast! Anyways all all good decent burger but nothing innovative  think I'd prefer fuku over lbs  <EOR> The LBS Patty Wagon Perfect Burger $7 beef patty topped gruyere cheese bacon oven roasted tomato frisee red onion marmalade LBS sauce herb mayo  Sounds good doesn't it? thought so  reality patty dry devoid any juiciness thin hard overcooked  those nasty burgers McDonald's except twice expensive   bacon fatty undercooked although did enjoy flavor red onion marmalade sauce  proliferation food trucks valley doubt ever back  <EOR> first time truck  Ahi sliders pretty good  would 3 5 stars  some better but would eat again  next time would try burger  <EOR> After seeing truck driving around town often never going Red Rock restaurant made point trying Costco Food truck event  Texan burger $7 burger Brisket Slaw BBQ sauce  $7 fair drink fries $9   The Burger itself ok much dry bun really thin patty decent amount brisket  Defiantly better fast food burger but lacked lot depth  think if thicker patty better bun would 4 star maybe 5 star range  <EOR> Being food truck junky wanting try truck long while  voted best burger during recent street food throw down knew good!  Writz Beverage building where parked day waited short line order food  stepped back prepared wait burger  surprise horror guy running truck outside reached warming oven pulled burger!!  keeping open mind thought well maybe fresh anyway  head back truck open take big bite found could more wrong  burger its self thin tasteless  If brisket burger would made trash  Let just point whole premise  Gourmet food truck movement all fresh quality food good value        <EOR>
