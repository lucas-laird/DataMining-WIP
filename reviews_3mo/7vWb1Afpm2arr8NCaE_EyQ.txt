I really appreciate cool little convenience store three blocks where mom lives  Since part town used considered bad might initially swayed want stop here    But must resist those wussy urges!  This BEST place come sandwich! deli legit  would even venture say just good if better Subway bit cheaper too   The staff always joked while counter always really nice  Lots crazy characters tend stop place but everyone pretty cool  Good people watching LOL   There also some random things didn't even realize needed fedora fellas straw hat ladies   I came buy foot long sub split before trip Hoover Dam best ever no lie   Cheap prices quick goods yummy deli friendly service  place can't beat! <EOR>
