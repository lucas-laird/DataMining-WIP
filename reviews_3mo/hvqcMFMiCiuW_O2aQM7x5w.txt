Ambrosia Cafe decent reasonable Mediterranean restaurant Southwest  don't live areaa but saw fairly new restaurant decided stop in  little weary place serves Philly cheese steaks ribs pizza falafel even more weary when latter spelled 'felafel' menu but hungry some reasonable lunch specials  Considering first impression actually quite pleased lunch  ordered 'felafel' sandwich plate $6 99 which came good version tabbouleh undressed salad  realized eating half sandwich should put little salad inside since weird or kind interesting combination falafel hummus pickle peperoncini needed little color touch more crunch  falafel itself beautifully browned flavorful but could used bit more kick  hummus fine yet fairly standard tabbouleh salad properly done lots lemon juice  hummus tabbouleh Sunnin Los Angeles however am finding difficult draw comparisons become slightly disappointed two items elsewhere  portion lentil soup $3 99 huge but sure supposed judging way waitress move pace snail avoid spilling any over onto plate  appreciated care but unfortunately time wasn't super hot anymore  pleasant hint curry enjoyed but needed salt probably more flavorful stock  definitely improved once doctored leftovers back home later day  wasn't terribly impressed lunch yet better I'd expected content  isn't place would your way but if lived neighborhood wouldn't mind its presence would most likely frequent occasion they also deliver   <EOR> We love cafe   food always fresh something everyone   daughter thinks falafel pita best   lentil soup also very delicious  <EOR> Enjoyed here!  On spontaneous trip Vegas past Memorial Day weekend honor meeting some down earth peeps DJ David Chrissy whom introduced friend some local Mediterranean food off strip   After long drive needed quick bite eat before hitting nightlife scene convenient place us  small casual restaurant accomodates nearly all kinds foodies  from health conscious hard core carnivores    Waitress attentive seated almost immediately  liked colorful bright menu!
