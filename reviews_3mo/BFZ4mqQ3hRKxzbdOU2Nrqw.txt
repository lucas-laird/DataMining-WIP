I am Las Vegas  friend mine puts towering monument American dream all its gaudy crass tasteless glory   means buffets unbelievably big name restaurants hours upon hours shopping pretty clothes wear night people egos match casinos all amounting insane amount money wasting  where people find fun    It August  don't even want know exact outside temperature is  spent miserable days Vegas before days just fun  need something something reminiscent home comforts teddy bear  then spot it Ramen Restaurant   plain sign plain strip mall behind all casinos but once enter parking lot find quite big presence plaza    The windows glass door completely covered inside but flashing neon open sign invites come in  Vegas? not? Inside pretty large space walls plentifully decorated signs nothing but Japanese written them which positive note me  open kitchen left cashier directly front where waitstaff watch door seating area right    The menu many typical Japanese snack food including croquettes kara age others rice curry dishes mapo dofu Japanese style course nice ramen list simple yet enough everyone find something tastes  chashu ramen significant other mapo ramen    The broth nice clear even mapo ramen which good sign  served right temperature came steaming table remained plenty warm last drop  noodles could bit softer but am also used Korean ramen which much softer noodles just Japanese tend drier rice Koreans know Japanese firmer noodles  But perhaps could cooked just bit more found some noodles sticking each other beginning which good thing  loosened time 2 3 done bowl   For Koreans other people stronger flavors mapo ramen definitely more suited tastes  Very strong presence sesame seed oil pork bits ground pork floating soup caught amidst your noodles making every slurp bit more interesting  chashu ramen much more subtle hearty yet mild however pork slices unfortunately overcooked hence bit dry   But end ate drank all grateful fact such place present desert hell Vegas  last sign satisfied immediately overcome sleepiness only produced good bowl ramen quite content   I would back just mapo ramen perhaps try others afterwards  If ever find myself stranded Vegas horrors yet again place would turn order keep sanity yes find teddy bear   And did mention smoke your ramen? Californian mindboggling  <EOR> Every time Vegas try come place   If think college ramen noodles mistaken   Ramen meal itself   usually order Gyoza it   When speaking Japanese food most people think sushi hibachi   here   you'll find fares served regular restaurants Ramen Donburi food cooked fried grilled   off beaten path strip but  ok   also funny watch errant non japanese hunt menu written English  <EOR> I am happy when found place Las Vegas! always visit mom know    only buffet places many times    *shiver*  thought all those food people gorging themselves        Anywhoo finally search Japanese Ramen restaurant yay! ^^v found one!  also serve spicy ramen warning! spicy! Different style Suzu though   Portion huge! if don't want waste food think sharing  offer half size basic ramen fried rice    I selection ramen ranging clear broth shoyu thick tonkatsu base miso  If mood something hearty thicker base soup    I say though am crazy chicken karaage  Compared other Chicken Karaage tasty juicy  Therefore known specialty ramen  <EOR>
