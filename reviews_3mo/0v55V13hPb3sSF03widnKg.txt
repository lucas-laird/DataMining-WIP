Convinent location horrible customer service  sandwich burnt sloppy falls out  Sandwich preparers side conversations loud  During peak hours enough coverage amount people  Cashiers usually somewhat happy there  <EOR> PROS dark side campus  more healthier options    They friendly staff clean atmosphere inside    there also 2 places order   CONS even all still really inefficient  line way long wait in    there many times under stocked food items  some items don't taste fresh others!  sometimes customer service awkward lol very good   OVERALL always come because closest classes but could use major improvements! <EOR>
