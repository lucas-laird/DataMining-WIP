The food good I'd consider most slightly better SF probably par sushi Japan but doesn't seem cost premium worth especially since we're talking double more although flying Tsukiji fish market sushi would cost lot more  $100 dining credit hotel where stayed which made cost little easier stomach but wasn't enough cover full cost meal 2 wished used credit another restaurant instead taking dining credit into account would've rated place 3 stars just food   + taste fresh ingredients according LA Times fish famous Tsukiji fish market + Menu highlights geographic origin food + Homemade soy sauce without MSG + Warm wet hand towels brought table before dining + Accommodating when running late reservation had call MGM's central number wait awhile before being connected them piece sushi $6+ nigiri smallest ever seen vs good sushi places SF Bay Area maybe even Japan though waiter did tell served individual pieces sushi rolls much better deal but still expensive Decor seems look modern but fan mixed industrial feel place concrete floor walls bar doesn't quite reflect fine dining if turned lights might felt dining artsy cafe SOMA district SF Bright lights kitchen clash dimly lit dining area which seem someone forgot install double doors kitchen wooden open wine? box BM scribbled side seems permanent marker used bring food but looks more supplies being carried kitchen rather classy touch not sure if supposed rising trend saw another fine dining restaurant use wooden wine box serving bread   Very minor but second sushi tray sushi roll pieces laid but cleanly would expect fine dining or judges Chopped FoodTV Dinner Notables + Hamachi Nigiri $7 buttery melts your mouth Yarika Nigiri Salt Yuzu Zest Squid $7 bit slimy tastes but liked citrus bursts o Tarabagani Nigiri Alaskan King Crab $9 just ok o Spicy Tuna Fresh Green Chili $18 tuna par budget sushi places SF  Also Asian fine dining Asian cuisine hasn't really made lot sense if fusion but maybe because Asian food just food me  <EOR> Came because $100 dining credit hotel  Upon entrance place really modern reaallllyyy nice upscale  also expected food just nice plus delicious   The $100 split among 4 ppl     when looked menu only enough 3 entrees 4 appetizers enough 4 people!! portion very very small  price RIDICULOUS get   We ordered yellowtail scallion roll salmon roll kobe beef udon chicken karaage kobe beef fried rice salmon sashimi  rolls cut into 8 tiny pieces taste so price $18 each  bigger better rolls back home half price  udon delicious according friend guess  that  fried rice waaaay salty tender meat tho  sashimi piece fish size small toe $6  Seriously? finished meals headed Hooters some 25 cent wings because still hungry spending $180 they charged water  around $3 per person   say more satisfied food Hooters here   Conclusion never come ever again  Total rip off service they forgot sashimi order ask it food worth price  <EOR> Barmasa little bit letdown boyfriend kept telling good NYC is  He's also bit sushi snob    Anyway 7 30pm reservations which figured would enough time eat light head Rio Penn Teller 9  Little did know would take 30 minutes time placed order time received first dish Kobe Garlic Soy Steak then another 30 minutes before received Sashimi Tasting plate 6 Nigiri sushi pieces  Everyone around seated ordered sushi before much faster  Service nonetheless could MUCH better  Granted place just opened 10 days ago price paying food expected better average service  unacceptable    The food other hand high quality sashimi sushi  Sure pieces small but many places selection fish outside Tsukiji fish market Japan  prices because environment you're quality food  Don't expecting same mediocre rolls see corner Japanese Sushi bar run non Japanese  other commenters below except Jen L  ridiculous expectations  high end restaurant high end hotel  If you're going try Barmasa or Shaboo matter expect significant price tag menu different kinds high quality fish and meats  kobe wagyu won't normally see    All in all hope service becomes more polished fast  food alone would warranted 4 5 stars but fact waitress didn't know she talking orders took considerably longer should keeps rating Barmasa greater 2  stick New York City  <EOR> Dont ever there!!!Crap place!!!!! Ridiculous price tag low quality sushi worst sushi ever ate!!!  My boyfriend dec 20th  decor n no theme  waiter knowledgable all!!! When asked recommendations he told fried chicken n popcorn shrimp ?!?!? What? Popeyes?? ordered beef sukiyaki pretty good but small  N probably best dish night   Man don't start sushi    $15 piece tiger prawn sushi u expected pretty darn good right? But nope   tasted rubber w slighest hint freshness  said fish japan really doubt that  may hav Japan but long time freshness all gone  O toro roll cost $68!!  4 pieces!!! better any Japanese supermarket   We never again rip off  costed $380 2 dishes 10 pieces sushi totally worth it!!!! <EOR> I recently dined Bar Masa new ARIA Hotel CityCenter Las Vegas   Having heard Chef Masayoshi Takayama holder 3 Michelin Stars more excited dine new restaurant   We ate restaurant 12 20 09 less week ARIA opened   4 people party   The decor inside generic best   Cold concrete floors walls throughout gave restaurant zero personality   expected your usual Japanese restaurant decorations fans masks kimonos tatami mats but frankly restaurant could any other restaurant    Italian restaurant steakhouse even 24 hour hotel coffee shop decor would fine   said generic best   Getting down food disappointed menu's selection   ARIA website did menu online restaurant look ahead time but checking menu Bar Masa NYC figured menu would similar   wrong   menu good selection sushi sashimi but when came hot items lacking   couple Yakitori skewers items couple udon soba some fried rice soups other items very inspiring much different usual Japanese fare   felt menu watered down cater towards general masses used miso soups california rolls   note restaurant serves la carte style no entrees   We ended ordering sashimi box sushi box   Unfortunately waiter very familiar menu could quite confirm included boxes   He guessed 6 7 types sashimi maybe 13 pieces sushi   boxes $99 each   Food brought wooden crates letters B M  written side which made all giggle because Bar Masa first thing thought when think B M stood for   don't understand why chose use crates over trays   looked cheap way try different   addition crates hid food waiters brought them don't really see others  ordering   Unfortunately remember number pieces sushi sashimi boxes either   remember absolutely delicious   sashimi sadly sliced very small very thin   However surprised see 3 pieces toro even though 3 pieces equaled regular piece sashimi normally would regular sushi bar   fish extremely fresh tasted such fresh sashimi sushi since dining Matsuhisa   Even simple maguro tuna delicious   price boxes very fair sushi sashimi grade   In addition boxes also ordered favorite flying fish roe tobiko   waiter somehow ordered ikura instead   Big oversight book   ended getting both both also delicious   Lastly finished off meal Kobe beef garlic fried rice winter mushroom fried rice   While don't generally order fried rice restaurants something shared everyone table   fried rice $28 each   The fried rice typical egg stir fried style fried rice find Asian restaurants   First used brown rice almost looks risotto   no egg used rice taste more flavor ingredients   very well done even though Kobe beef cut into small cubes which unfortunate since really taste beautiful flavor tenderness Kobe beef   winter mushroom fried rice very flavorful enjoyed quite bit   We opted skip dessert instead incredible Jean Philippe Patisserie inside ARIA   Including drinks several bottles beer bill came $100 per person   average high end restaurant   Even though food ate excellent decor service uninspiring menu made dining experience less memorable  <EOR> So Masa NYC reputed best sushi restaurant country    promote new Aria hotel MGM giving away $100 dining credits any Aria restaurants   hearing opened Bar Masa Las Vegas brand new Aria hotel figured we'd try out   $100 dining credit would least put bit dent huge bill anticipated   Because place very expensive    More expected  I absolutely love sushi really looking forward trying lots sushi   Unfortunately learned server right away orders nigiri piece normal 2   really took wind sails   ordering tuna salmon yellowtail toro kampachi jalapeno appetizer $100 dollar credit pretty used up   realized would super expensive if kept ordering sushi stopped   sushi selection very good though having lots things won't find most other sushi places   But stuck stuff knew first time knows when next be quality really great   However didn't think amazingly better lot great places eaten California    30 dollars 2 pieces toro alot   12 salmon etc   kampachi appetizer also salty potato bits which though took away    also ordered yellowtail scallions negi hama cut roll which great   wasabi great wife enjoyed ginger but should expected     We then ordered some hot food   kobe beef sukiyaki black cod dish   Both very good   wife thought cod dish Ame San Francisco little better but both very similar   kobe beef very tender flavorful good sauce   mushrooms excellent     I know others complained service but thought great   very attentive   food came fast server definitely helpful   He told before ordering sushi orders only piece     So overall different good experience   food very good but definitely pricey   $100 dining creidt helped alot recommend taking advantage deal MGM running   point though knowing very good suhi other places half price can't give place high rating   am glad tried though  <EOR> Reading all glowing reviews Masa New York fact chef owner 3 Michelin Stars expectation high  LA great sushi restaurants couldn't wait compare East Coast version  restaurants expensive distinguished ingredients but preparations standard executions great  ordered theis specialty items ones seemed different see other sushi restaurants  Verdict 1  Chilled hairy crab appetizers chyrsantemum salad bit fishy 2  Sushi Roll * Masa toro toro toro sushi roll good fresh toro but special  *sushi canape fishy especially shrimp one  *Chiba beef sotomaki black trumpet mushroom different very good  sushi roll filled black mushroom inside rice topped grilled beef  *Lobster tempural roll good but standard dish u find many sushi restaurant  prefer LA Katsuya creamy sauce *Unagi avocado roll good 3  Jalapeno yellow tail dry Katsuya LA prepares much better half price 4  spicy tuna tataki seared dressing bland   5  kobe beef sukiyaki tasty kobebeef cut thinly still bit rare almost Pho  Good but broth bit sweet  6  kobe skewers yuzu spice grilled perfectly sauce great   7  Uni risotto white truffle $78 small bowl lots uni but bit dense rich me 8  Winter mushroom yakisoba winter mushroom fried rice very tasty noodle great texture  <EOR> Definitely letdown going Chef Masayoshi Takayama's student's resto over summer   But yes understood BarMasa ala carte version Masa NYC     Interior stark modern no hint cuisine come even most wait staff Japanese   server stoked spoke Chinese um really unprofessional old while     Yes Bar Masa still super pricey but bill taxes tip low $400s expected actually thought would come more   Kobe Steak put bill over top $68 very simple very good heavily marbled   sakes decently priced junmai daiginjo carafe less $30 pop     LOVED Kobe Steak Kampachi Jalapeno excellent quality fish great texture nice heat Yakisoba delicious Salmon Avo Tempura Flake roll melted flakes wonderful   Not much Sashimi Tasting $98 price little high but if good would baulking  Kobe wraps tasted something Chinese resto sauce thick delicate Japanese cuisine should be     If you're walking dining room restroom ladies LEFT reception boys RIGHT   Would come back try few other premium ala carte dishes but anytime soon definitely Shaboo $500 head   INSANE   shabu shabu   Heck no  <EOR> We defeinitely looking forward dinner Saturday night  Unfortunately rest hotel let down   Portions tiny prices way steep quality food   walk into stark open space leaves feeling cold if concrete box   spent $500+ still sandwiches two hours later Jean Phillipes note meals comped true evaluation price aside    two orders kobe skewers sashimi snapper kobe steak $68 beef sukiyaki clam soup yakisoba blue fin shashimi spicy toro lettuce wrap why would cook dish? loose flavoring avocado unagi roll white truffle ice cream sorbet sake bottle  Note Just Cynthia C  comments waitress came speaking mandarin   Odd  bad only 1 person table spoke understood mandarin   Service supperb though <EOR> I very excited having dinner new City Center   While room very cool food prices service enough ambiance   food very expensive portions very small   ordered $98 sushi tasting server didn't even tell kind fish platter when served   $8 piece unagi?  Ridiculous!  cancel second round drinks because took long   spending nearly $400 leaving hungry friend walked across street Fatburger   mere $17 couple burgers fries left happy full   short don't waste your money Barmasa  <EOR> So think Vegas   brand new 10 something billion dollar hotel   top chefs    HA! Let stop right there   came all way try restaurant did get  Let tell friends     If looking decor? Nope   Think warehouse high ceilings them drop lights  tables linens chairs ordinary      Looking good food? Expect pay price! one  yes literally one! piece sushi least $8 piece    believe me   thought joke   piece came size half dollar  Take half dollar put screen see freaking California roll cost you    remember uno 1 piece!!! $ 8 dollars!  more some people hour    all devour still think still some more coming  yeah right! keep dreaming    OK   now lets service   hostess very nice  but boy train servers well   don't know eat cause place new   do? course ask server?!?   suggest? most freaking expensive thing menu  yes  the caviar thing   price?? $240 EACH! Damn! would love them work if restaurant   course did but neighbors did   guess happened? returned first bite    $240 per person well spent? let answer one    So overall if planning try place   PLEASE DON'T!! SUCKS!!!! Such waste money!! If want good Japanese Vegas   Yellowtail Bellagio  more food better price cute servers nice view better selection Sake    end story here    I love try new places but first time EVER Yelp place   Save your money try something else  am pretty sure  95% come unhappy  willhave fnd somewhere else eat portion did get       TRUST ME!!!  wish Yelp 0 rating!!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> This place definitely crappy  OMG can't believe overpriced food was! stickler when comes paying GOOD food but pay GOOD food  pay mediocrity  Bar Masa  get  5 star price 2 star food  SKIP PLEASE!! <EOR> Stay away here! wish Yelp negative star rating  We originally wanted try Shabu but then found $500 person  shabu could possibly worth $1000?!! The waitress overly nice polite disgusting  busboy would refill sparkling water every sip took because restaurant pretty empty pretty annoying   We cucumber salad came few pieces cucumber some mediocre sauce cost $18! waitress told great seaweed salad but nasty couldn't more 2 bites  Everything tasted weird some way  salmon sushi which waitress claimed flown overnight Japan daily  very mushy soft  taste ok but texture didn't feel right me  toro roll fishy made feel pretty sick  food expensive but don't mind paying lot good food except worst  As soon left restaurant trouble breathing  few hours later experiencing full blown food poisoning vomiting everything back up  horrible  love sushi can't even think eating fish again  still suffering days typing this  <EOR> Small portions  very expensive  decoration ok  good signature cocktails  <EOR> I did eat but did check restaurant menu trying decide good restaurant Aria   What really turned off atmosphere decor  The place massive cold lighting very flat depressing unflattering   Though interior modern cool nothing special felt empty half built cafeteria must only 3 tables occupied carnivorous space devoid any character   wasn't even any music which made space errily silent   did feel comfortable all   The menu looked rather uninspiring hearing all disappointing reviews Yelp happy didn't take chance eating here   Tiny portions typical tab $500+ top would made really angry   excellent shabu other restaurants much livelier atmosphere satisfying portions personable service tenth price here   Seeing expensive restaurant must costed build near empty dining room typically busy restaurant night can't see restaurant surviving much longer   Luckily Julian Serrano nearby excellent dinner  <EOR> The short message Bar Masa joke   am scrolling through other reviews am surprised all reading     We wandered into Bar Masa browsing various restaurants Aria decided while high prices might feasible whim since Valentine's Day   heck let's best!    I very high expectations all would chef Masa really attach name something would deliver bad food? dreaming going Masa Urasawa last 5 years! figured worst would leave full because ran money but would enjoyed every bite     Sadly case     Here's ate 1  Grilled Eggplant awful   commented moment stuffed eggplant dim sum tastes better   cost $18 recommended waiter being must try  bored death essentially eggplant teriyaki sauce     2  Kobe beef skewers saving grace meal   beef juicy tender marbled   some tendons but overall best dish night   3  Braised cod Daikon fish well cooked but sweet   daikon tender enough again dim sum better   enjoyed but wasn't perfect expect when paying kind money     4  Kobe Beef udon when cross kobe beef $5 bowl instant udon?  Masa's $28 version includes some overcooked meat floating it   broth just so   average   No should ever order this   Ever     5  Seasonal tasting Sushi Here's where expected menu shine but where biggest letdown is   Some big reviews read pictures gone piece piece detailing flavors textures etc   apparently NY Times says sushi flown Tsukiji?  Well guess flight must destroyed all sushi ended Bar Masa because just average   single piece impressive   doubt could tell difference between served Bar Masa vs  sushi special Teriyaki Boy   utterly disappointed yes sushi snob     This definitely worst dining experiences Vegas ever   Average below average coupled very high prices result that   least buffets always choice   only choice empty your wallet surrender your taste buds  <EOR>
