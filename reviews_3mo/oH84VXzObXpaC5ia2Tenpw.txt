Totally unexpected good way   First its looks lot its menu those typical at least far places know NYC Mexican diner but staff Salvadoran   addition tasty Mexican staples serving array other Latin dishes great comfort food even those didn't eat them home   I chuletas rice beans well some shredded beef tacos which would recommend anyone   Entrees come choice tortillas handmade ones pleased was   GF enchiladas which she pleased enough offer taste   Portions bit large opinion just don't over order you'll fine   Everything positively inexpensive when need fill come Esmerelda's  <EOR>
