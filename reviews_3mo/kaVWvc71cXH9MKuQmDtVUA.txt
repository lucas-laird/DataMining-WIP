Never ever seen fresher bean sprouts pho addendum plate    Now pho did veggie pho menu but once again friendly service delivered! asked if could pho only vegetables waiter eager honor request  specifically asked broccoli he quick come back ask if would also some tofu  Yes please!  When pho arrived chock full broccoli tofu! broccoli bright green without speck darkness  flavor wasn't incredibly complex flavor alone may 3 star but overall package earns fanship  definitely see visiting again  <EOR> My wife decided tryu Pho Thai Binh again   second time around decided original rating bit high     Yesterday ordered rice fried chicken served side salad    wife ordered Duck Noodle soup     My rice bit dry taste   chicken positive negative   outside very crispy good however inside hit miss   Parts chicken tender other parts extremely dried rubbery   could tell freshly made    mixture nuke deep fried   rather wait meal done right!  As soup tried duck kinda tasteless   However brothe very good   In addition ordered 3 bean drink   bit watered down   but good   Overall give meal 2 5 star rating   Average last outing deserves around low end 3 star   Personally if Vietnamese food Vegas would 1  Pho Mailan Henderson or 2  Hue Thai Las Vegas China Town <EOR> Was while back during its opening month  Very clean   Service typical Asian place lack it  staff appeared family run waiter no experienced taking orders  great deal time understanding friend me   Pho flavorful  Did add great deal hot sauce hoisin sauce   Have good potential if little marketing going slightly faster service especially during lunch hour   <EOR> Pho favorite food finding good Pho place Las Vegas trying rich gambling big casino Pho hard  Everytime new Vietnamse restaurant opened Vegas always hope  finally good Pho    define good Pho? Must good flavor  flavor must come beef bone meat + enough herb + spices star anises ginger onions salt sugar etc    just MSG +salt+sugar+ star anise    Even though grew California don't think set standard high when comes Pho Vegas  Anyway back Pho Thai Binh  Tried first time when first opened wasn't impressed  Tried again week even worse  broth bland flavorless tasted water + salt + sugar only  Also tried rice dish wasn't impressed either  Rice old hard meat  Bun Thit Nuong decent   Overall Pho # 1 Pho # 8 still better choices  only upside restaurant really clean but think b c place still new  <EOR>
