The Suncoast's Oyster Bar serves pre shucked oysters  They remove blue plastic bands around each before serving them half shell  two dozen oysters satisfied price paid   $14 99 per dozen didn't expect greatness exactly expected   oysters large plump but none liquor probably due them being pre shucked    don't different kinds oysters would expect oyster bar would   guess good place if craving oysters want place  quick cheap   fun watch most dishes being prepared right front you   bouillabaisse could stronger flavor but tasty nonetheless   If Senor Miguel's next door order Oyster Bar menu too  <EOR>
