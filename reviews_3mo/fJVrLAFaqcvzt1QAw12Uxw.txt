Stalls included Beard Papa boba dessert place Fuku burger noodle stall some dim sum Chinese BBQ stall  dropped around noon Saturday check place dead  Walked Fuku burger peaked interest  eventually did come back around 1 50 am ate Fuku Burger really liked meal #5 jazz fries good drunk food reasonable prices   downside Fuku closes 2 a m  really should open until least 3 4 a m  club crowd sober at    Overall need totally rethink execution place bring some high profile brands LA's SGV let them set shop here  Boba Half Half desserts Bambu still overpriced  b c right now only option kind stuff Strip  point I'd recommend driving over Chinatown if want your asian grub on  Only if desperate boba if want some good fusion y burgers  <EOR> This place needs some serious work  admire decor looks really hip fresh but food wise place way expensive honestly poor quality    FAME seems set modern Asian Market Place vendors lined kind lunch line  Fuku Burger end area which friends ended eating said pricier food truck  chose opposite side area where showcased duck pork hanging kind Sam Woo BBQ if anyone familiar restaurant   ordered duck pork combo switched rice noodles lo mein possibly which came $18  While definitely thought way over priced something trying mimic Asian Market where prices cheap hell helloooo i e  Philippines Thailand etc still gave fair shot     Still quality food garbage  literally saw them microwave duck  didn't cut duck hanging window when server brought food table she forgot utensils said Oh shoot forgot give utensils just them? Smh  Also manager scolded workers front giving someone number card really professional    The food tasted old fresh duck soggy  pork reasonable but definitely $18 worth  noodles so so oily very flavorful side vegetables oily also fresh    If place wants survive need cut prices work quality food big time work customer service  really disappointed place wary  <EOR> $9 Thai Tea boba tastes milk slight tea taste yeah no thanks  If you're going audacity charge almost ten bucks Thai tea should least taste Thai tea if best Thai tea ever  didn't try food stalls but if anything overpriced drinks taste nothing watered downed milk would say avoid place much better places walking distance  worth your money  <EOR> Was really excited visit place but such disappointment  didn't try boba cause ridiculous $7 99 just drink then extra $ 99 just boba say what!!??? finally decided roasted duck absolutely edible disgusting microwaved right front lolll  Anyways hope stuff right soon cause if see place going bye bye soon  <EOR> I love idea place since fuku burger wins over  tried bbq pork tender tasty   hope continue experiment expand menu   sure visit again next trip   <EOR> TURN DOWN DAMN MUSIC!! cream puff papa place pretty good  Couldn't hear anything though  <EOR> After reading most reviews they're pretty accurate  still haven't ramen Asian food combinations but FUKU Burger Boba Lounge Beard Papa    Fukuburger far most hyped burger joint planet  burgers when first opened pretty decent  But place disaster  two times including today messed order forgot give food ordered until asked them  hard look need it? people mistakes but twice row mess up? guess third strike they're out  But top Tamago just big mess  just throw all ingredients together call food  fried onions always stale now  paying 9 bucks messy burger    Boba Lounge  You're getting you're paying for  9 bucks traditional fruit slush real fruits honey infused boba big ass cup  if big twist add shot 5 more bucks  Service cute haha    Beard Papa  read some reviews place actually eclair pretty good  Haven't original cream puff yet try it    Overall  Two stars  Boba good price give em'  Fukuburger overrated need more organized  Beard Papa ain't bad  Pretty good  <EOR> This place located Linq very convenient since staying Quad  During EDC weekend if showed your EDC pass boba BOGO  Surprisingly actual boba exceeded expcectations   done nicely!

Great concept they'll only better time  isn't 100% fully open yet give FAME time  Fukuburger followers Beard Papa's fans don't seem problem!? Personally would never buy anything ramen Chinese spots nor would buy boba drink machine knowing there's better quality selection nearby Chinatown  Hopefully Beard Papa's opens other locations around town but until then frequenting FAME whenever Cream Puff craving hits    even more Sprinkles! ALOHA!!!   Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu \uuu \uu  3 5 <EOR> Love place   Good ambiance  Good music  GREAT performances!

I enjoyed Ramen tea all while watched people dance outside ate very lively place    I would see myself coming back still getting Tea without Boba  Gross things lol <EOR> Imagine food court all Asian food everything double price!  is! <EOR> FAME legit concept just wished food owned name  food advertised little papers expensive look far appetizing  always walk take gander offer but then quickly change minds dining here   We've also tried Fuku burger's Tamago burger jazz fries but completely disappointed  Every flavor could taste very salty  burger didn't any exciting pops flavor fries became super swampy soggy terrible salt bombed gravy mayo  flavors just simple fell flat asian fusion radar  would try another burger creations future but definitely wary   The reason why hating hard FAME because incredible location LINQ right smack dab middle thangs! Plus Boba Lounge half bad  honey green tea super refreshing actually robust full bodied deep tea flavor  also added right amount honey sweeten nicely  boba itself white clear pops reddish pink color which really cool look just wished cooked properly  Most boba super mushy dissolved contact some super chewy then few boba right consistency  drink size hefty but $9 wouldn't way it  But if immediate area there's real life boba emergency would definitely dabble  <EOR> Just vacation family  Stopped because they're craving asian food  Ordered burger ate half way through looking okay until literally raw beef  wasn't rare  Just literally raw     It struggle getting refund waiting awhile manager whoever managing day didn't apologize      The girls nice though thanks    Boba tea awesome though  <EOR> Ultimately place sounds much better theory actually experienced  Cool concept but execution lacking  popped few times now but never feel compelled order more snack   The few promotional articles ads seen place sound ton fun Food Art Music Entertainment but just comes across dismal food court  yet when buzzing full positive energy usually fairly empty even employees look they'd rather elsewhere food simply doesn't look appealing   Maybe just need more work maybe Art Music Entertainment portions happen times when but fun dynamic environment dancers drummers yet materialize   EDIT Correction saw drummers outside once  But didn't realize affiliated FAME business just seemed courtyard area live entertainment general  only saw them once  <EOR> FAME seems having identity crisis  doesn't know wants be  several counters serve different types food but call themselves Asian place  burrito  Don't wrong food good prepared right front tasted very fresh  girlfriend ordered dumplings made wait long enough finished burrito completely before she 6 dumplings  did give dumpling sauce instead gave cup put soy sauce in  Soy sauce does dumplings   When place order worker approached asked if wanted order Mexican counter  said yes she asked which type meat wanted  said shredded beef  She then simply turned told woman behind counter could easily told her  all very odd  no real 'counter' server outside kitchen stand she just awkwardly standing next me   I asked shredded beef pretty sure pulled pork  still tasted very good but place made kind uncomfortable oddly poorly ? run   FAME stands Food Art Music Entertainment  wants food court single restaurant club all once  Oh yeah forgot mention DJ corner trying people dance middle essentially food court  Very odd  Maybe I'd try place again afternoon when hopefully aren't trying hard  <EOR> The concept great Karma Pizza good nothing exceptional  Boba tea something would recommend tried lychee lychee jelly watery then tried milk tea ran boba offered rainbow jelly accepted  Such horrible suggestion rainbow jelly tangy acid milk tea sweet creamy  huge very expensive <EOR> So bomb dim sum option point seriously  Recommend place those craving Asian food budget  definitely come back sure <EOR> Fame pretty good location linq  8 food stalls including boba beer ans sake  stalls include pizza tacos dim sum all types noodles burgers sweets  udon ramen dim sum  Udon doesn't much flavor would to  Ramen good  Dim sum good if front you  decor very hipster  Worth visit if area but worth planning whole trip for  <EOR>
