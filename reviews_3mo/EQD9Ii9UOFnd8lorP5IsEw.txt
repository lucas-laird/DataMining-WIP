My all time favorite place ice cream growing DQ but ended closing down back home haven't while  different feel then typical old school diner DQ remember having little more stylish update look  chicken strip basket pretty good better then raising canes chickenbonz but did spot plenty filling   ice cream treats dilly bars DQ sandwiches bit smaller then remember now premade boxed up  Where big white DQ bag each individually wrapped frozen treats? guess its good customers don't wait them made but  separated them store bought ice cream  Anyways still blizzards sundaes dipped cones banana splits   Don't forget waffle bowls  workers location pretty friendly let's stay until finished even though closed    If online sign blizzard fan club always offer buy free blizzards   Never tried Orange Julius before try next time <EOR>
