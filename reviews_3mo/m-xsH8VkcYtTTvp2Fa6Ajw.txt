Prices jacked WAY downtown Summerlin   Better Mexican several places nearby   Sorry say doubtful return recommend   Seems other people feel same according reviews  <EOR> I waiting restaurant open while anticipating great costal Mexican food Panchos famous for   When finally dined place really underwhelming  First all no carpet restaurant sounds warehouse  ordered chili verde burrito which staple Mexican kitchens seemed pork cooked separately sauce which enables them use multiple sauces  pork Chile Verde should cooked braised sauce which emparts meat juice sauce  unctuous experience totally absent Panchos considering companions mediocre dish most definitely return Panchos  classic Americanized Mexican restaurant strongly prefer eat more authentic eateries! <EOR> Service fine food OK prices insane   This great looking restaurant excited visit second day open  won't judge service much since always crazy during opening although sure why waiters always feel comfortable complaining day other customers happens many restaurants just one    Pancho's basically '90s throwback Mexican restaurant Americanized Mexican food which isn't bad thing  obsession authenticity made miss stuff but can't imagine reviewers calling authentic ever outside all inclusive Cancun   We ordered appetizer platter which $18 while big would've cheaper any other Mexican restaurant  quesadillas great rest standard  husband steak fajitas tiniest serving fajitas ever seen but he said steak excellent  Pancho's trio enchiladas your usual enchiladas both size flavor   We thought ordering $16 guacamole but waiter said try side portion comes appetizer platter  pretty much just mashed avocado  No flavor whatsoever charge more any place ever including those Strip   All food good but no way justifies fact charge twice much every other Mexican restaurant  probably most expensive Mexican place seen absolutely nothing special food  They'll need cut prices nearly half keep regular clientele  spent $67 those three items Casa Don Juan next week same stuff $28 tasted much better   Another problem little kids running around all over place  None them same party but whatever reason everyone felt comfortable letting kids run around circles packed restaurant full rushing waiters  common see someone doesn't care kid doing but just weird when room full careless parents   The waiter said seafood specialty back try see if any better rest  Unlike last reviewer said cheap  regularly eat restaurants more expensive but quality matches price those places  Pancho's just doesn't it  figure restaurant attract same flavorless Summerlin soccer mom crowd Crave  <EOR> Terrible overpriced   Lunch plate avg $15 dish taco enchilada rice n beans   you warned <EOR> Well pros cons  food quite expensive tonight salty  started queso artichokes  great  did come tortillas which thought standard mistake  main course enchiladas del Mar crab shrimp  enchiladas themselves alright but rice beans awful  garnishment rice looked side salad carrots cabbage    WAY MUCH!

I highly recommend Pancho's any occasion definitely suggest checking yourself  atmosphere alone worth trip! <EOR> So ordered Burrito Carnitas Especial   won't lie tasty   Comes dollop sour cream middle two slices avocado top burrito semi glazed some cheese sauce   The atmosphere nice server but when wait 20+ minutes Mexican food off Strip Monday night amazing there's something bit wrong   I'm actually shifting towards latter   atmosphere great place perhaps justify cost due being Downtown Summerlin    But just wasn't anything enlightening it   Maybe just me   The burrito ordered cost $19   Honestly probably worth $12   Unless ingredients all fresh farm raised organic all just don't see it   Maybe do    Trader Joe's right across there   Somehow doubt though   Vegas isn't SoCal wasn't Strip experience   Unfortunate  <EOR> OMG! visited Pancho's Downtown summerlin cannot wait back! little pricey but décor beautiful food AMAZING! server Alfredo   he rocks!We definitely back! <EOR> Restaurant open till 930 tonight bar separate live music scene karaoke some nights  Service great bartenders Ariana awesome cocktail server! fajitas awesome great portion size <EOR> The food service very good  But don't think prices McDonalds  far quite expensive but food authentic fresh  only problem waiting 10 minutes place half empty  would recommend place if bank account larger  <EOR> Just objective assessment visit #3  I ordered Enchiladas de Mole traditional Mole Poblano made Ancho Pasilla chiles sesame seeds peanuts  good BUT should ordered Pollo en Mole Verde green cilantro lime rice  food three visits both lunch dinner consistently good spot high quality ingredients   The service all fairness first visit chaos because opening week  following two visits both dinner now lunch bar staff exceptionally engaging gregarious Kelly Jessica    The Margaritas base tequila Cuervo Gold  Total liquor 2 25 oz  painful $10 50  three closest competitors within less 5mi radius use 100% Agave tequila unlike Cuervo's mixto pour 3 oz liquor $11  establishment $10 using Patron 2 75 oz  The bottom line Food good service good booze above average albeit value wise fails  final note truly shame anyone Google Manhattan Beach menu see Las Vegas pricing whopping $3 more straight across board! Did think Las Vegas locals smart enough investigate that??? happy hour loooong! Starting 2 2 30 through 6pm but complicated!! worse yet no real value  $2 savings happy hour although suppose if milk staying entire 3+ hours then MAYbe better value  <EOR> Panchos great restaurant! food service atmosphere fantastic  other yelpers prices affect repeat business  Being located Summerlin probably very successful  wish them best back only special occasions  <EOR> Way over priced   Took fam there   I didn't know hi$tory place surprised prices   soon saw menu felt guilty wearing shorts suit but staff nice anyway   beautiful inside decor great but agree w another review seemed bit cluttered w tables which took away aesthetics bit   food good   Better your typical Mexican restaurant but still worth price charge   surprised if w lowering prices knows though maybe there's niche rich people overpaying ok food passing better restaurants area   Supply demand guess probably wrong   BTW while 2 different families came sat down looked menu prices left  <EOR> This beautiful place should offer better quality food if want survive Las Vegas! Servings skimpy overpriced  <EOR> Was quick lunch Saturday noon place packed since just open few days prior  Sat bar ordered steak burrito looked more quesadilla flat due lack meat it  As eating rice saw appeared piece chicken bone included rice!! How see whole piece chicken going rice?? The GM came full operations discussion owner sitting next  Right over shoulder literally inches ear  Long story short good bad expensive  One burrito Arnold Palmer $25 00 Not dinner lunch <EOR> Nice atmosphere great location   However overpriced $40 lunch two  Complimentary chips salsa very good   Entrees mediocre best  Hubby Tacos de Carnitas  Meat obviously overcooked dried looked yesterday's leftovers   back  <EOR> Went back second time today worst  1 1 2 hours later food came out  six 2 meals right other 4 all wrong  think price high food isn't worth it  $3 95 Coke give small glass  going back place <EOR> OVERPRICED!
