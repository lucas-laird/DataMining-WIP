Brand spanking new place right neighborhood! located corner strip mall most part vacant see why first review it    It's teppanyaki type restaurant but without all fancy tables onion volcanos  think actually good idea since teppanyaki but sometimes don't need whole show weird people sitting table annoying birthday songs  took them 5 minutes to go order considering just opened seemed fine me   I ordered Ckicken Teppanyaki plate Bok Choy Fried Rice  all cooked right front all ingredients looked tasted fresh   not shabby seems lot healthier Panda Express   The price little over $7 without drink guess seems fair  decor simple modern dark brown reds  kind cracked Teppanyaki chef guy still add little flair even though don't think neccesary guess old habits die hard   Overall back very new place hopefully it'll well  <EOR>
