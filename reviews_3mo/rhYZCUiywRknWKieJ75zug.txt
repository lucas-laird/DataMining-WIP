I'm surprised place doesn't review yet  considered casino video poker various slot machines haven't touched I'm gambler restaurant seating bar  Every time far 3x never seen restaurant side open  place 24 hours best part full menu available 24 hours well  noticed lot places close kitchen during later hours night  no good people munchies fun night out    It's very mellow place far looks only locals come don't expect speedy service  good service   but more 'lax service  Plus usually only 1 2 guys running entire place  food comes pretty fast order but kind place won't give check unless ask it  time finished meal just sat watched TV played phone chilled good thirty minutes before finally told bartenders would pay    The food great too  bunch items haven't tried yet but tried very good the potato cheddar soup bbq ribs cheesecake la mode few appetizers   love fries theirs perfect crisp hot well seasoned  full menu including breakfast which am determined back try days   So if drunchies drunk munchies just want midnight snack Mad Matty's perfect place just relax fill before return your humble abode  <EOR>
