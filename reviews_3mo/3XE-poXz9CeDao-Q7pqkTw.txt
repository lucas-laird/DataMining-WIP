This Michael Mina's Vegas seafood restaurant   When place first opened great big cylindrical aquarium thingy front filled hundreds little silver fish swimming circles all Nascar style but when couple weeks ago aquarium gone   Automatic 1 2 star deduction   place very nice look service good seafood I salmon friends bass shared oyster sampler fresh tasty but can't help getting nagging feeling dollar didn't stretch very far place since 4 5 ounce fish quite frankly really all filling   suspect if Mina's restaurant San Francisco could same quality fish much less money simply because don't cart all way into desert   Speaking dessert desserts restaurant quite good  And *hic* glass port wash all down    <EOR> We swung Seablue while staying MGM Grand pleased decision avoid seafood buffet Flamingo which tends leave full but trying find one's sea legs quite some time afterwards   First off service expereienced excellent   seated table next busy thoroughfare waiter came picked grimaces asked if would sit somewhere else selected booth off side     We started off soup sampler ceviche   Both arrived wonderfully presented ceviche star shaped bowl top bed ice   soup sampler came cute little cups cute little spoons   only way appetizer could've any cuter if Smurfs marched your table   thoroughly enjoyed both appetizers   entrees date selected DIY salad grilled salmon   entrees arrived simultaneously which time also brought some bread slightly grilled pita almost naan various toppings including olive oil curry like paste crumbled cheese   Both salad salmon great although wouldn't recommend salad entree if really hungry    skipped dessert   Throughout dinner waitstaff extremely attentive filling water wine glasses checking time to time   those people feels embarrassed if someone waits *too* much but felt good balance between excellent service being OCD   restaurant itself nice setting dimly lit without being dark   music noticeable but overwhelming still hear your company across table   those cascading waterfall walls only look good restaurants     My only gripe feel restaurant overpriced especially wine hence 4 stars    However food service great  would still recommend if nice dinner and willing to pay a little extra tonight kind mood  <EOR>
