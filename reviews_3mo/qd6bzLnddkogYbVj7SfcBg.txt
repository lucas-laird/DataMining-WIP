Located somewhat hidden location intersection East Wyoming Ave South Las Vegas Boulevard behind corner ARCO gas station Super B Burrito now open business feed hungry masses large quantities Mexican specialties Super B style   Menu items include favorites such burritos tacos salads like   sampled breakfast burrito simple creation eggs bacon other filling items addition couple Mexican style street tacos   Unfortunately no lime provided tacos bit flat   Overall food items ordered somewhat average flavor but quality ingredients would consider return visit  <EOR> Best carne asada fries! Better over hyped dish Roberto's  Closest authentic mexican food going Mexico yourself  Location clean staff readily available take order  Lady took order sweetest thing! She chatty genuinely trying help assist even brought condiments table  Also horchata best versus other mexican food places Vegas hispanic know good horchata's like  good fact refill drink pay they charge $1 refill lady filled cup didn't charge me! Cherry top experience  Definitely would recommend  <EOR> I few times its nice alternative Taco Mexico Roberto's  some items menu better others  San Francisco burrito super burrito different occasion both really good but tacos   I better tacos other spots  Salsa Verde major factor because simply love salsa Verde salsa Verde good  not bad but great either  enjoy extra tortilla chips side pour some salsa Verde top it  3 1 2 stars bad Yelp doesn't incorporate half star system  <EOR> The food good fresh  Cooked right then there  taste just grandmothers cooking its old style mexican food   Down side portions small theres no super <EOR>
