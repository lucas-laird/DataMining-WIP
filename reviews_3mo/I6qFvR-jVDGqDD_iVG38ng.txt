Came soft opening offering free entree drink different times during three day soft opening before actual Grand Opening  Tuesday night right before opening class around 4 20 no really around but time opened 5 line leading parking lot  when left parking lot full still long line out  Everyone loves free food!   I Bun Bo Hue pretty decent  wasn't really spicy all  contained lot pork meat which okay well  mom would say meat smelled she picky meats definitely smelled eating pig  friend ordered same dish meat dish smaller mine since don't really eat pork gave mine which when he commented mine larger    Second time lunch special Pho Dac Biet which also pretty good  wasn't anything special stood out  Both times portion size seemed smaller Pho 1 any other locations but might because promotion giving out  sizes might gotten bigger  free food worth trying probably again final conclusions if I'd again not    The thai tea everyone came pretty fast but wasn't strong  All foods came pretty fast but sure ready very long line certain specials being free didn't think anyone would really stray 'free' menu much  <EOR> Here grand opening!  They giving complimentary choice Pho pork chop thai tea soda   Their pho broth very beefy full flavor   Probably most flavor tried but some may feel slightly overpowering   sides etc fresh delicious   tender meats   The pork chop very very tender   pulled apart fork   Very good   Yum!  Service quick friendly   Setting very nice   lots nice granite tasteful interior tid bits   blows away most pho spots decor wise   Give shot! <EOR> Pho tad oily but decent nonetheless   Considering Jenni Pho some regular joe shmoe pho restaurant Chinatown soaring expectations  mediocre meal decent service bad any means but slightly disappointed   First off still NO CREDIT DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS  just don't carry cash rarely 'em me  Jenni Pho why always take trip Bank America take withdrawal $40 bucks meal? Until slowpokes update system take some cash you   Secondly service lightning fast which many pho eaters may accustomed other venues  ask extra napkins because there's no dispenser table only give two napkins each person start with  tables middle terribly small joke there's four chairs around them because crammed tuna three people   The pho pretty oily  reason why liked Jenni Pho Rainbow because broth usually very clean less oily  pho location just tasted very thick saturated unnecessary flavor   Overall pretty mediocre meal  know better time because new  sure Jenni whoever charge straighten things eventually  HEY JENNI UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS OK?!!
