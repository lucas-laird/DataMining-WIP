I recently discovered old lunch haunt relocated Clark County Government Center  The old location Industrial Rd  excited find Expresso King again particularly thought being reunited Granny Wrap chicken wrap apples other good stuff     The location cafe next Pyramid Room end building   Basically parked guest parking lot then walked NW main hallway which sort curved   kinda reminded Dorothy following yellow brick road   But digress   5 minute walk found cafe end hallway road   Upon entering saw empty podium right immediately front cooks cooking food diner     There wasn't sign anything co workers stood 10 minutes waiting order cooks   Well come realize needed order cash registers first which far left door entered in   literally stood 10 15 minutes   cooks didn't say anything two ladies guy near cash registers   wasn't particularly busy yet no said anything even asked if needed help        Finally think co workers noticed cash registers   then informed needed both order pay registers   people registers made seem inconveniencing them asking questions!  suggested sign entrance would helpful especially if no podium   lady just gave sort irritated look didn't say anything     After straightened finally food   food just remember delicious!  wrap not Granny well seasoned flavorful   Everyone liked food but time ordered started eating over hour half   only starving but pressed time   While food good rushed eat back work   feel food sullied bad service     As Pyramid Room essentially giant cafeteria   nice but kind felt high school again   But there's also beautiful outdoor amphitheater center building benches grass   seems nice place lunch spring fall   My tip enter cafe Pyramid Room you'll hit cash registers first and therefore likely avert issue had    Espresso King really do   weekly lunch specials http bepnv com site php?ben_site=7 reasonably priced   probably try more time   it's just disappointed especially when recommended others   holding hope caught them bad day  <EOR>
