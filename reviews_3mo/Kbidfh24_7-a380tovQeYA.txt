In unassuming rundown plaza new pupuseria popped summer  put off visiting but once finally did? Mindblown   In addition pupusas menu Mexican meals seafood grilled meats  Pupusas star though they're great queso camarones shrimp queso frijoles try beans both ample sized well priced stuffed toppings  Salsa slaw side salsa practically puree but flavor awesome acidic spicy perfectly balanced  pupusas I'd again rare say that   Also opted try some stuff appetizer menu there's yucca frita dish pork can't remember exact name served chopped salad more salsa  yucca meat crispy could used tiny bit seasoning but pleased weren't greasy  Cut meat small chunks very fatty but think specific dish error part kitchen   Lastly tried tamale elote con crema basically corncake wrapped corn husk made masa flour tamale  kind dish sweetness don't sweet corn  bad dish though texture good   Pupusas $1 50 3 ea based toppings again good size amply stuffed  Yucca app $8 portion made fair plus bit rare find yucca town  Tamal maybe $2?
