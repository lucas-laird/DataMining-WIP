I'm convinced using search function correctly because shocked place isn't Yelp yet!!!  I love Town Square   really do  many fun spots drink shop   catch movie   etc  love Yardhouse Blue Martini but freaking packed! When usually looking scene   looking more place relax   drink   enjoy company people with  If you're looking something similar Bar Louie might your spot!  We escaped insane mobs Blue Martini stopped Bar Louie check free luigi roast beef sandwich promo  barely made 5 7 PM happy hour able try some half price martinis appetizers    The downside happy hour and why taking away star! doesn't include awesome sounding specialty cocktails   promo something 1 2 off all wine beer appetizers martinis   wanted mojito   damnit   Anyways martinis good but honestly selection 8 martinis doesn't compare Blue Martini    Food good but amazing  pretzels YUM! But pretzel freak really easy please loaded cheese fries again freaking cheese fries   screw up! Luigi sandwiches  solid Roast Beef Sandwiches but honestly prefer processed garbage Arby's ok least honest!!   french buns superb I'd try other sandwiches future!  All all great spot try if Yardhouse Blue Martini packed gills want just away actually table somewhere instead being packed sardines  loved chill yet upscale atmosphere   PS Tuesday $1 burger night   maybe someone check good $1 burgers are!! <EOR> We Bar louie 2 26 09 happy hour   between going Yardhouse Grape Blue Martini way packed annoying! day doing free luigi sandwich too!  weren't many people thats kinda weird only other person review Bar Louie same day time!    Anyway bartender super friendly    happy hour prices awesome   didn't Luigi  but looked tastey   only stayed drink but definately come back next time  <EOR>
