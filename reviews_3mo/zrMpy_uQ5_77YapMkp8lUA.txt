It always bums when something super amazing doesn't any reviews telling whole nation its wonderfulness but then again little secret  Well Yelp going share secret you  little hole wall taco joint called Asada's Fremont Street   They sign front boasting daily special which drew in  When $6 3 chicken tacos drink  hubby decided that  However am ridiculously addicted carnitas try theirs  ended two carnitas tacos corn tortillas  put some onion cilantro mix your choice salsa top   looked perfect recommended skipped cheese sour cream  Oh my    I felt died taco heaven  onion cilantro mix good some best raw onions ever tasted  going try re create when home  carnitas also piping hot temp wise tasted they'd soaking pork days  good!   For 5 tacos bottle water only cost $13  can't even something cheap home let alone vacation  If you're going near on Fremont try tacos sure fall insta love too  <EOR> Any gives place good review must really drunk  Terrible food  Thats all   If taste paper hot sauce found right place   Enjoy  <EOR> The food pretty decent  chicken burrito bowl which did remind bit chipotle but definitely doesn't compare  Don't wrong good but chipotle way better <EOR> Great taco special  LOADED chicken! Kind messy eat but tasted great  opted bottled Coke instead fountain Coke  it added 50 cents extra each order but worth taste  <EOR>
