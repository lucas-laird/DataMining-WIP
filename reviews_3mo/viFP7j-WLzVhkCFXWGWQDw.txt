Is more perfect quick meal grilled cheese cherry limeade tater tots? All less $5?   I think not! <EOR> They sell fast food don't seem sell anywhere else  cherry limade cheese fries  Also fast cheap  When feel out doing McDonald's but really good place  <EOR> One good thing Vegas wide variety dining options   And them definitely Sonic Drive In  way to find Sonic I since none near Strip   Everything at Sonic delicious  wish Sonics Northern California then wouldn't feel obligated visit every time we're down here  <EOR>
