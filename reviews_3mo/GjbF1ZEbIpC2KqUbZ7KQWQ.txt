This place amazing twice only open 2 days   create yelp page could let everyone know  <EOR> I excited place open  love Japanese food hibachi sushi! high expectations place because imagining Volcano Grill Yelp worthy   know only 2nd day open hoping work kinks because location convenient us  hope start entreé pricing because super ASSpensive   I wouldn't mind paying $90 did meal if quality par  understand labeled sushi express but what's dine in hibachi where the chef puts on a fancy show for you cook in front of you prices????? Seriously! $12 average Hibachi Entreé STEAMED rice $3 extra fried rice  also steamed veggies  mean fast food style restaurant! serve food styrofoam dine in   cool all but price quality no balance   What ordered Vegas Roll The closest normally called Tiger roll elsewhere  Shrimp tempura roll spicy tuna  Tiger roll this  first time eating sushi styrofoam plate lol  But gotta give bomb we'd come back only this!! Shrimp Tempura They don't TEMPURA SAUCE!!!! know new restaurant but poor girl register gave look making shit when asked tempura sauce? She looked confused said all sriracha soy sauce other sauces back sushi  Wtf???? Salmon Teriyaki Entreé  My 4 year old finished fish he said good  Beef Entreé + $3 fried rice This husband's  He said good but nothing he'd come back for  He's sauce guy he's appalled why no sauces offered served  Hibachi sauces together!! Shrimp Entreé + $3 fried rice Look photo uploaded! shrimp rice looked charry  didn't clean grill well before cooking meal  if gets busier tonight guys? Fried rice should part entreés!! Chicken Katsu Entreé + $3 fried rice  My son loves chicken Katsu almost anywhere sort upset because poured sauce over meat  He ended eating all anyway because he hungry basketball game  He's big fan Hibachi fried rice he said tasted weird  Probably charry tasting mine did   Next time want Hibachi again we're going down street Ohjah  We'd paying same price plus salad miso SAUCES!! Oh we'd free show cooks too  Next time want express style food we'll take drive Volcano Grill  least meals come fried rice everything tastes delicious    Southern Highlands family oriented neighborhood need more tables family friendly  everyone coming come twos  High chairs needed well  Staff needs more Japanese food education  Girl register kept asking cooks stuff lol  almost feel bad asking Tempura sauce meat sauce what's rolls etc  <EOR> I've 3 4 times now feel fair judgement   stepped since opened  entrees come salad veggies rice  portion easily 2 meals everything fresh  Salmon Teriyaki good but find inconsistent depending cooking  Chicken Beef Teriyaki also good   Veg perfect spot between still crisp yet soft  love simple good fresh food  get   also added $5 95 lunch special   cook cashier very nice  <EOR> New spot side town decided why let try out    Well coming into restaurant few days open does look ready opening  Decor restaurant still looks little bare  No music anything conversations little awkward when everyone hear   Restaurant ready opening  top owners main reasons smaller restaurants fail  Still decided try food   So look menu restaurant style teriyaki madness ish  Prices restaurant range  Beef shrimp combo 16$ pretty small portion  Twice price half food Panda Express teriyaki madness which closest comparable restaurants  Two entrees two drinks 40$    Still don't write negative reviews wasn't going if weren't lack service wait time  then decided politely return meal took bite since completely tasted pepper beef yakisoba wait 25 minutes try return it  lot people waiting long wait times orders    Wouldn't back  always try find good places optimistic possible but restaurant just didn't me   The kids working girl taking order sweet tried but we're just inexperienced fault    Below average food  Restaurant ready opened  Slow service  Don't worry you're missing anything stopping here  knows maybe better improve future   <EOR> I hate giving bad reviews going hold opinion until try place again couple weeks? months? however long takes them really ready open    I love supporting locals business whenever possible but just soon business  Rolls expensive veggie tempura pricey raw! Menu no description rolls ask chef explain  styrofoam plates boxes cups made all feel even cheaper    Plus toxic environment  <EOR> Horrible won't returning   outside media leads believe decent sushi place but don't fooled   fish fresh tasting sushi sloppy well done any sense word rice even sushi rice   prices charge same premium sushi restaurants   waste your money just your favorite sushi place thank me  <EOR> Short story expensive get      boyfriend really excited place open specially since place across street gone down hill since changing owners    Biggest problem prices  no problem paying good sushi but when your charging same more sit down restaurant 3 times your over headed issue   expected fair priced good not great fast sushi     Ordered three rolls 2 3 good  good enough order again would tell but gave mistake sure   probably back but no rush when order sushi mon right gym just pick before heading home Southern Highlands  <EOR> Staff friendly  salmon teriyaki entree  wasn't worth imo  I'd probably somewhere else if you're looking bento box type  rolls  champ roll    SO GOOD  I'm def coming back rolls  seaweed salad good gyoza  Gyoza served dynamite sauce   and tasted fucking amazing dipped sushi it  miso unless dark salty that's she said   There's couple things wouldn't but most likely gonna repeat customer cause can't away sauce rolls  <EOR> If zero stars would give them zero   yakisoba noodles gross  sushi flavorless  no hibachi restaurant even though hibachi name  waste your money place  <EOR> Where begin   ??? place?? I excited when first saw establishment under construction could wait open  But boy   what tremendous disappointment!!! am Southern Highlands resident dinning options very limited neck woods!!  First decor As bland plain vanilla gets without hint ambiance!!! uncomfortable hospital environment  could only imagine Joe Bastianich Tim Love would say if episode Restaurant Start Up!! Plain walls no music no   style!! place felt ran money drastically cut corners had  If weren't signs would no clue Japanese restaurant!!   Prices Overpriced get!!  I ordered teriyaki chicken n beef entree  paid $16 dollars felt cheated amount food received! don't mind paying food but give money's worth!!  pieces fat blubber beef hardly any chicken!! food bad   but better  impressed   just   ok   2 Stars The wait bad order come out  10 minutes  ordered go  young girl counter very sweet nice  Great customer service   Bottom line Save your money elsewhere  Champagne prices beer quality restaurant plain vanilla ambiance!! <EOR> All ambiance dmv none character  Teriyaki chicken weak no brown rice option over priced cook prepared speed smell  Good luck! <EOR> I am sure long place looks long  6 45 Wednesday    don't eat meat only thing veggie seemed veggie roll sushi menu  asked if could veggie hibachi I'm thinking easy reasonable request girl register looked kinda funny turned ask cook if madness even possible  He said sure he would throw some tofu  Cool   am even lying when say waited 20 minutes   finally counter ask what's up  girl said oh sorry god knows long there  back counter mistake  paid 10 00 some mediocre food  Hopefully check prices maybe run special something   don't afraid throw couple vegetarian items menu  <EOR> I agree Many outside does match inside   Very bland very exciting   week day looked maybe owner inside   No customer service   Very basic   Super expensive! could another actual restaurant down street paid same price chicken terryaki received better service  try again few months if still <EOR> I wouldn't complain much food   enjoyed spicy crab sushi roll would come back food if changed everything else     Prices  First use paper plates which fine but $16 bucks chicken teriyaki shrimp combo? Only food found change your rice fried rice additional $3??   Umm $19 combo plate     ouch ! gotta step your game up   portions small   Use real plates instead paper serve restaurant style because doubt family orientated neighborhood going pay over $20 bucks 1 person eat   Let money's worth   Variety Food The name sushi express you're thinking variety sushi but much menu   Also no descriptions any rolls would need ask them it   Maybe suggestion would adding bento boxes lunch specials people combo hibachi sushi instead paying full price if want both      Atmosphere Seating limited if large group stay away   No music no decorations hear everything everyone    I hope change some things because love seeing new places succeed !!! know neighborhood excited something opening    now if want chicken teriyaki bowl would down street teriyaki madness 7 bucks if want your sushi fix your favorite sushi restaurant because you'll paying same price! <EOR> Finally checked Dynamite Grill tried several rolls spicy crab California rolls very good tempura perfect bad neighborhood  food joint  <EOR> Salad no dressing  Veggies completely bland  Chicken little no sauce  Beef little no sauce  asked descriptions sushi rolls told didn't any does anyone know what's Jason Roll?!?   Unbelievably overpriced  Took way long  Nothing walls create any ambiance  never back  <EOR> Decided support Southern Highlands newcomer   Food awful guys   maybe bland side but  way better overly seasoned  wife food but see other reviewers saying spartan decor  Owners take 5 minutes put little love design  hard put some tunes   it'll help guys when you're working well    Then saw bill  Listen Southern Highlands considered remote neighborhood  Places Off Strip set standard pricing remember Italian restaurant tried match pricing except big difference  Off Strip gets didn't  business  Owners cautionary tale take seriously  can't charge super pricing type food  know know already your flyers printed    but guys  cheap replace  also digital menu   changing easy  Wouldn't rather lower prices more people trying rich off few?   I believe guys come rooting you  improve decor food quality pricing Southern Highlands come  <EOR> A little disappointing    excited something open neighborhood    I ordered 3 things Tiger roll seaweed salad miso soup  Tiger roll bland missing flavor  miso soup miso soup quite flavorless  seaweed salad normal however amount given way more necessary  did reflect price well    I did appreciate menu did description some specialty rolls    Overall overpriced bland unexciting  may consider trying them again few months see if any improvement  <EOR> I shrimp really good flavor special sauce die for!
