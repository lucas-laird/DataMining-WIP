I wanted give pizza good rating   understand all effort expense open new shop        then pie crust dull dishwater  sauce good   Lots good cheese  Prices reasonable  None really matters if crust ruins it   no taste dry cardboard  really hard good crust?  If want experience good crust just walk across street Brooksys   Maybe PMD should switch flour supplier whichever use? <EOR> Ok saw place right around street apartment decided try out  pretty good pizza! ordered large pepperoni some breadsticks  pizza good sauce great yummy cheese even liked crust! tasty dip marinara sauce  Atmosphere good staff friendly  definitely return when craving pizza  <EOR> Love food used other location other side town happy when saw them opening house guys really know put flavor pizza  <EOR> The salad good  But pizza far ok best  Those guys pies much better  pizza extremely undercooked  <EOR> I am fan PMD east side due ambiance but pizza    Well finally place   Atmosphere 100% above Warm Springs but said working that   favorite thing cheesy garlic bread   suck oil today didn't disappoint   thin remember but still great!!
