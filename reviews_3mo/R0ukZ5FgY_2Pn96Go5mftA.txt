Since work mall only few places usually lunch place coworkers frequent not   The food ok mediocre burgers fries but major problem location service  continuously mess orders substitutions    other problem seem ignore customers  call ahead don't pick standing right front hostess' stand person just ignores you  Wouldn't think would want try help right away? guess not    Since first official review location share review meant location posted different JR Here's suggestion if your restaurant dead there's        someone waiting place order u tell staff tend them instead performing unenthused dance routine nobody   Poor prioritizing!!    Care your customers them keep coming back more don't ignore <EOR>
