I loved choices wild game burgers Mt  Charleston   chose ostrich burger while friend ordered bison burger   Both cooked perfection delicious   appreciated could order side cottage cheese opposed french fries cole slaw if wanted it   server EXREMELY friendly like woah although staff all together seemed little dazed   affected meal slightest  just wondered all fresh cool mountain air does people On side note suppose food bit pricey    but coming New York didn't really bat eye over $8 nacho appz  <EOR>
