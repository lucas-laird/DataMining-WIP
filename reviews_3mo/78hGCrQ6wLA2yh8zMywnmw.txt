St  Patrick's Day first day business Vegas' 2nd Wahoo's   chain originated Orange County CA familiar all SoCal transplants but never Wahoo's until tonight   If think all fish you'd wrong like me!    choice fillings addition fish chicken carnitas carne asada shrimp tofu mushrooms in Polynesian marinade sauteed vegetarian Banzai veggies a veggie mix sauteed teriyaki sauce    happy say food fresh abundant glad location opened 'hood   shrimp taco combination 2 overflowing tacos brown rice black beans   couldn't say no Maui Onion Rings those but maybe best combination tacos   Regardless am full!  place brand new service great ambiance laid back just if beach right outside door  <EOR> Maybe just working kinks  food really kind pedestrian  screwed part order brought burrito bowl  Took almost 15 minutes bowl  food kind bland chips marginal  <EOR> The mushroom enchilada green sauce amazing! also grilled fish taco black beans rice  food came quickly fresh tasty  love laid back atmosphere place  portion plentiful free drink refills plus  definitely back  <EOR> So friends raving Wahoo's Fish Taco long time when heard new location Boca now open super excited  haven't decent fish taco anywhere Vegas really looking forward great weekend treat  pains say perhaps worst fish taco food general ever had! fish dry desert along taco shells entire combo entree complete rice beans essentially flavorless    The ordering area very conveyor belt feeling no salsa bar if ordering only hot sauce if remember ask  sauces themselves definitely heat but again nothing particularly interesting memorable flavor department    On upside restaurant itself fun open feel lots big screens watch sports great bar patio  suspect if you're interested neighborhood cerveza hang pleased but food I'd say stop Baja Fresh across parking lot fairly decent fish taco before heading Wahoo's meet your amigos  <EOR> I am old school Vegas guy when comes service town  place only open couple weeks all say wow! witnessed owner GM personally each customer see everything going  seen ALL four times visited  hardest things convey service staff anticipate guests needs recover mistakes  obviously done great job that  Kudos!  I love Cajun style fish shrimp tacos  Really fresh perfectly soft corn tacos  BTW happy hour pretty freakin awesome take advantage indoor outdoor patio  Way more bargain laid back atmosphere Kona Grill  in same lot  just hope Lambo driving Affliction True Religion wearing Summerlin douche bags scare away all cute girls away don't ruin new favorite spot  <EOR> I pretty stoked Wahoo's restaurant opened near me  Some friends really hyped up  Unfortunately order cajun fish tacos came super late fish very dry bland  anomaly because both friends' fish dishes dry well  Did expect much place? excited coming back trying other dishes  mean they're called Wahoo's FISH tacos  If can't fish right why bother?  UPDATE back tried carne asada beef  gray color bland  Seriously grilled gray  meal stomach ache  Coincidence? think not  <EOR> Loved food but could tell just opened  The bar tad bit dirty but promptly cleaned when brought bartender's attention enjoyed salad grilled chicken fish fresh cabbage   drink menu bland but plenty  options far drinks went    food extremely fast if take your time order bit bit!  However fast food feeling   look forward more meals local Wahoo's  <EOR> I twice since opened first time made couple mistakes order but quickly rectified understandable since everyone new  food excellent good pricing  clean fun atmosphere  If simply compare Baja Fresh pricing easy see much more your money Wahoos  <EOR> We wanted place but food dull service was    atmosphere lends itself beach hole in the wall but reality smokey hole far any beach freshness food air  ordered vegetarian nachos outer reef burrito wet classic burrito quesadillas chicken taquitos all to go  took over half hour food mostly because kept giving incomplete order insisting complete  food very little flavor  nachos outer reef burrito reminded something would throw together left your refrigerator very uninspiring dry  Speaking dry wet burrito hardly wet  quesadillas akin cafeteria food  chicken taquitos more whole bay leaves them chicken  chips crisp but flavorless salsa equally touch heat  Obviously won't going back  <EOR> In Summerlin area Bocca Park convenient great location shop dine out  always nice new restaurant locate here  first time eating Wahoos  expecting just your typical fast food type restaurant but pleasantly surprised find step that   nice bright lay lots seating  decor Southern California beach theme  bar middle open wall outside seating  real vacation type feel place  You order counter  but your food brought your table  wife Cajun Fish Tacos daughter Cajun Shrimp Taco  menu only offers corn tortellia which none really like  But if ask flour tortilla when order it  say wahoo fish caught ocean delivered fresh store daily  serving size plenty big enough all three agreed tacos very good  Being able feed family 3 under $20 town pretty good! The only draw back some excellent outdoor seating but considered part bar area anyone under 21 allowed sit there  hard find place take families days fun place offers good economical meal  place certainly great place families  bad limit best seating area adults only  <EOR> my review biased eating wahoo's since early 90's  been fan ever since  it's tough when you're socal beach city  wahoo's pretty much staple beach folk   i've always loved laid back island aloha vibe place  i love throw stickers anything   the more better  the vegas locations aren't quite stuck cali locations yet but sure they'll eventually there  = it's pretty rad there's bar gaming vegas locations   the food consistently good great  they've always slightly overcooked fish  i think i'd give them solid 5 stars if they'd just stop overcooking fish  i suppose great they're called wahoo's FISH tacos fish just ok  they should probably work that   the onion rings bomb tho! my fave   i'm super happy socal girl now wahoo's vegas! <EOR> Wahoo's yeshoo!  After seeing cute location reading reviews checked very happy find food very good   fish tacos very good spicy salsa awesome   white rice very tasty unlike major chain competitors similiar fare black beans tasty well     Went again another trip tried Kahuna Grande selected spicy fish taco chicken taquitos w guac sour cream very good greasy all they use lard tried white beans better quite saucy bit zip   Tried Wahoo's salad grilled Cajun fish spicily wonderful!  fish portion long platter not bits meat chopped cilantro dressing quite tasty!  Try very nice atmosphere! <EOR> Nice place chic chat friends having cold beer glass wine  fish taco's good  Made Ono wahoo   Maui onions Very taste  return  <EOR> If you're looking something par Chipotle good option food fresh prices great   classic burrito $5 flour tortilla filled lettuce cheese salsa protein your choice   thought carne asada nicely flavored   burritos served wet green red sauce cheese which also tasty option   husband didn't think shrimp fish tacos anything special   night restaurant uncomfortably warm actually hotter restaurant outside does bode well summer months! <EOR> Wahoo's Fish Taco default place eat when can't decide anything better  family eat Wahoo's LOT! matter fact should tested much exposure Mecury point  ever crave Wahoo's? Never  But never mind eating anytime day    The only addictive item Wahoo's Mr  Lee's sauce  put everything  costs $1 side which STEEEP considering cheap menu  little known secret should ask them put your burritos taquitos enchiladas etc FREE! <EOR> A nice slice coastal goodness reminds hometown San Diego   except parking lot Boca Park!  The food tasty but menu little overwhelming   first time Where just fish tacos? Apparently pick your vehicle taco burrito etc  then choose your innards fish chicken tofu ! mushrooms ! etc then choose your rice brown rice option !  beans   fish tacos little dry would liked more sauce   also some sort tofu bowl don't remember name goooood   prefer Cajun white beans black beans great flavor but rice lacks something read flavor    They full bar nice happy hour special each day   nifty margarita where stick mini Corona it   fun very college Spring Break inspired   But think favorite part restaurant open patio   window wall opens bar area nice little patio comfortable seating   only wish didn't over look black asphalt parking lot but take some al fresco drinking eating any day just imagine black asphalt ocean water while eat fish taco drink beer margarita concoction  <EOR> I love Wahoo's!   So thrilled store opened pretty close home   Great customer service great outer reef fish burrito *cajun style* always quick service also! <EOR> Kevin Molly Ashley more could ask for?? Oh wait great food too   <EOR> Wahoo! right! place cheap delicious great customer service fun atmosphere    more could little Yelper need?  This place two main attractions dining room bar   The dining room set seat yourself fashion  first order then pick place sit then deliver your food name   I ordered Wahoo ono fished grilled burrito wet  Both enchilada sauces delightful  asked sample each let both half half   food came quickly fresh   The house salsa lack luster  Nice veggie taste but nothing special memorable   Mr  Lee's sauce business sweet spicy thick  I swear teriyaki   it! You'll thank later    The bar great beer specials  variety Mexican American tap around $2 11 piece half during happy hour   If you're single gal great place surfing dudes   I'm pretty WAHOO Wahoo's! <EOR>
