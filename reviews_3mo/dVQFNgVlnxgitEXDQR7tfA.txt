Luckily same day Yelped them needed area work errand needed do   Originally going try different taco options however quit hungry opted 2 entree combo  combo ordered brisket pulled pork sides corn bread fried pickles  am fan both meats whenever Billy's version certainly did disappoint  truly tasted smokey flavor brisket something differentiates real BBQ all other stuff  smokey flavor mild but overwhelming  funny part when ordered brisket cashier asked if wanted fatty piece lean piece  asked lean because would felt sick eating piece fatty brisket  guess  know truly southern when ask questions haha! Billy's BBQ sauce okay if mistaken there's another review feels same way  pulled pork good pretty standard  Although amazed still did enjoy it  yet find knocks socks off  think would enjoyed pulled pork more sandwich? corn bread pretty amazing  really moist which difficult corn bread considering corn meal course try itself  corn bread ton other places theirs probably better versions  sure butter came would made much better trying sort cut down calories  fried pickles menu because side special month  read another review fried pickles compliments BBQ well don't know if does but certain taste good  never fried pickles before but glad tried it  did taste odd all but pretty good actually  saw condiment area white sauce submerged ice  cashier explains  version another sauce adds more vinegar base  tried different  wasn't exactly bad tasting but wouldn't use meat entrees next time come  may awhile till come again but definitely recommend Billy's friends looking good BBQ spot  Please try them deserve your business! add food disappoint  <EOR> Best BBQ around! place fantastic!
