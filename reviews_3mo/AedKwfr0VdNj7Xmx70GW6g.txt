So far fan  Joseph James Citra Rye tap  should enough anybody fan  1 15 didn't house brewed beers tap yet  However fabulous bartender said would available weekend  haven't back yet but guessing own brews flowing now    Prices very reasonable  Staff friendly fun  smoking gag bar area completely separate dinning area  abhor smoking but only saw person sitting enclosed bar area when arrived decided risk it  all brews  momentarily disappointed when tender told brews weren't ready yet  feeling quickly abated when saw Citra Rye menu  Anyway only handful gaming machines maybe cancer kept minimum? Only time tell  plus side clean air dining room much appreciated option    The food tried pretty standard bar food but thrilled see some salad salmon options menu  trying salads when back sample brew  Happy drinking  <EOR> I dying try place since first saw coming in  Boy let down  love tater tot concept besides them being cold did great hash browns  Everything else could done without  Everything ordered besides biscuits gravy which actually delicious cold when it  Side note only ones there! everything cold?! really hard stomach paying meal when only eat maybe 6 bites really hard butter your cold toast ice cold butter    With all being said waitress super friendly may consider going back only reason gave them two stars  <EOR> Now pub food! way business appointment didn't try beer but if even close quality food then hit  The service exceptional! <EOR> We driving area decided grab some food drinks here   I'm really sure review place  awkward very spacious location  opted restaurant side which huge  little well lit taste rows rows booths far eye see  just recently opened but decor bare  being kind  walls stark really no ambiance speak of   The menu small despite restaurant being completely empty server only menu table promised find another which she did while  restaurant large pretty surprised don't more menus especially since printed paper clipboards    The menu didn't look exciting while perusing neither nor dining companion could find anything wanted try  server nice friendly felt obligated order something house brewed hef  server offered sample start taking sip knew wanted nothing since flavor didn't anything me  friend cider  also shared some tater tots  waitress recommended house brew offered sample brew first off which worked well  She described Flavors lost interest she mentioned bubble gum  still sip didn't enjoy bit  glad gave sample first  tots basic but didn't really enjoy any flavors beer cheese bbq dipping sauces   I understand new working all kinks including menu drinks  wanted place although didn't try many options can't see making any special effort return  hope put little more decor walls lighten atmosphere develop menu bit could see place being successful but now dullsville  Maybe even adding trivia night would help restaurant portion bit  always root new places wish best them  <EOR> I don't want premature writing restaurant only because Old School Brewing Company seems open prematurely   mentioned other reviews no character ambiance yet   some point something bare brick walls but time only two flat screen TVs   menu odd   ordered chicken sandwich which comes tator tots BBQ sauce on side    Tator tots fine   sandwich nothing more grilled chicken breast nice bun lettuce tomato     could easily bland sandwich home   son ordered chicken wings   Really nothing memorable them   certainly usual battered wings come expect appetizer item would order again   wife ordered Margherita Pizza which lists basil ingredients   No real evidence basil   really great pizza just average   clear restaurant trying fit into its skin   Beer brewing seems real focus food   all call themselves brewing company   think time menu tweeked necessity restaurant more inviting families especially those neighborhood used bring families old pizza joint occupied building many years  What's missing carpet video games kids now just concrete floor all cracks repairs    covered something pay few insurance claims slip and fall lawsuits!
