Simply put love place   few true neighborhood bars Las Vegas almost all customers live Mountain's Edge bartenders servers some nicest ever met my first time bartender greeted Welcome Home called name ever since  The food tiny step your standard pub food slightly more diverse options although some dishes absolutely superb I can't enough Crispy Ranch Salad    But most your standard Vegas style pub where nobody knows each other puts head down night playing video poker everyone talking bartenders dancing music playing darts Golden Tee generally having great time   much hate say place where everybody knows your name  <EOR>
