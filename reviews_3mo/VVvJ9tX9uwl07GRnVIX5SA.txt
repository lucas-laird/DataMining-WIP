I'm really happy though bit surprised see m first review High Roller's  really love place! Fat Tony crew kitchen  haven't failed impress any occasion  chicken parmigiana cannoli everything great    Going past place know might little skeptical  across street UNLeV 2 story building  housed such legendary Vegas institutions d Espresso Roma Tremorz  next tattoo parlor all flame imagery inked ruffians behind counter might intimidate minute but man step counter guys actually couldn't nicer  first glance might think prices high but never dissatisfied paid finished eating  ingredients all excellent Polly o Mozzarella Hebrew National pastrami etc everything prepared freshly possible  being said all work put into making everything right takes bit time come leisurely lunch call order ahead if you're rush  place still relatively unknown there's still always plenty seating much line but now because sure change  sometimes stop lunch bring stuff back office all ever hear Wow good! Where'd from?! High Roller's also does catering Fat Tony loves opportunity let true skills shine   Even when he took care simple to go order some cannoli plating presentation something you'd expect high end restaurant you'd expect plastic to go box!  Anyway could but you'd better off just giving them try yourself  faves chicken parmigiana Vic Vegas clearly cannoli  Don't tell them sent but always say you're friend Neil's  <EOR> Legit   Across UNLV   Solid sandwiches easily shared 2 folks   2 hungry folks   Salads fresh interesting ingredients  calorie conscious but definitely flavorful    clever combinations   I've tried but am dying see someone  see  sandwich fried mac cheese  ingredients    French Dip  but mine simple  tad salty but definitely good   The owner's food and tattoos actually interesting cred Food Network  Matt said don't let biker grunge look intimidate  boys really cooking  <EOR>
