Several gluten free options incorporated into Divine Eatery's final menu! <EOR> Came opening day  dying good restaurants area  excited see going in  menu small which understandable new restaurant but  only reason 4 stars instead 5  Would love see some more variety  atmosphere ok sure its work progress  But more importantly food  came lunch burgers  Great burgers  don't eat red meat many many turkey burgers all over town  very good  Obviously hand made fresh ground turkey well seasoned  I asked wanted turkey burger cooked  Haha  fries fresh cut cooked very good  husband regular cheeseburger  He said great burger well  Very friendly definitely back  really hope area gets behind restaurant keeps open  Love having place walk isn't chain  <EOR> My wife support local business Providence area  restaurant only open week  walls still plain no pictures art signage yet   Very quiet only three employees Chef Esther owner Waitress Mary friend owner dishwasher son  Another customer couple leaving sat down while third couple came leaving  steady business but overwhelming  adds personal service received just Mary but Chef Esther well  Everyone very friendly polite! The menu just two page flyer but all offerings you'd expect 9 am 5 pm cafe very reasonable prices  The drinks ranged fountain sodas flavored teas hot cold coffee  coffee extremely hot but little weak taste sweeteners available only sugar turbinado cane sugar Stevia Raw  think natural no preservatives thought restaurant  Still prefer Splenda   Finally food  Divine Biscuits Gravy which besides two biscuits pork turkey gravy came cubed potatoes home fries two eggs any style  biscuits yellow layered flaky kind which fancy  prefer buttermilk biscuits but tasted good  gravy bit bland no meaty flavor  suspect because restaurant new small portions gravy doesn't time soak flavor meat? Perhaps even making plain gravy then adding type meat upon ordering  food came VERY hot especially potatoes once cooled very tasty  over easy eggs received good too   My wife ordered The Healthy Way which VERY flavorful especially tomato composee which cubed tomatoes basil  She gave wheat toast which light crispy  VERY tasty!   All all very good experience  going back again bringing teenage children  believe foundation already place most notably great service place going build something amazing glad experience it    Walt D LV <EOR>
