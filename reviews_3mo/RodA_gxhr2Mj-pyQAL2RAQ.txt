Someone saw looking impatient told them waiting 20 minutes asked ordered told them hadn't even ordered yet! point left because trying movie time elsewhere red rock  He didn't ask wait minute speak manager try right things  very frustrated especially because food looked good liked ambiance  <EOR> My husband myself couples friends dinner Saturday night w 7 30pm reservation  four checked hostess stand 7 33pm seated 7 45pm  literally table 20 minutes BEFORE ANYONE greeted us!! umbrage was    My husband flag staff members assist table   Nine more minutes passed before female server FS showed table totally callous long wait she amicable albeit unapologetic   FS took cocktail order forewarned diminutive serving size pasta entrees  she correct since ordered Table Side pasta w Vodka sauce meatballs serving portion deplorable $22 00! FS proclaimed table she sure kitchen put four fried zucchini flowers appetizer when appetizer came only three flowers!   In summary Salute overpriced immensely slow disorganized service   decor elegant modern kitchen whips delicious foods  Assistant General Manager AGM Anna Golden apologized table took off two cocktails bill gave complimentary dessert platter 7 types desserts end evening   MAYBE try Salute again future   keep fingers crossed restaurant improve organization initial greeting time  <EOR> We came convenient dinner  going across street but checked menu place decided try everyone else agreed too  guess remembered loving Red Rocks last Italian restaurant thought place should just good  place really fancy  guess didn't really pay attention prices when checking place out  bit underdressed but thought if place expensive food must good  being Vegas  always true    The service good glasses always full waiter nice helpful  start big antipasto plate ordered prosciutto burrata cheese because love burrata cheese  Some freshly baked sesame bread came table first  hot touch crust light brown covered sesame seeds  tried piece only because Mom said really good  bread fresh soft light center  great olive oil balsamic vinegar  appetizers came fast which expected because nothing really cooked  antipasto alright  parmesan cheese served huge hunks which made weird eat no eats parmesan way  rich eat big chunks that  mozzarella balls flavorless needed some seasoning  ricotta basil wrapped zucchini needed served little warmer cold ricotta just really gritty no good  olives prosciutto peppers plate good though  burrata watery bland which disappointing because looking forward it  liked thick sweet balsamic served though  tangy sweet great prosciutto freshly baked bread    Next came salad which only couple people ordered  tried some Aunts caprese salad served kind weird  plate only few small tomatoes huge portion mozzarella very balanced  She just gave some cheese  kinda gross trouble getting down  First all looked weird small black specks which highly unusual  cheese spongy soggy flavorless bleh  just something wrong cheese which really sad considering Italian place    Our final dish night best dish night veal marsala  Mom split it  plated very elegantly edible flowers  small portion but split weren't hungry perfect both us  veal delicate yet good bite  marsala excellent whole pieces mini mushrooms  bit salty side though  Needed some water eating dish  Dad seafood risotto he very disappointed in  tried seafood good but rice undercooked  Aunt salt baked branzino also disappointed fish she said bland  tried actually liked thought cooked very well but could see could bland if  all eat  felt kinda bad everyone exactly happy meal because chose place     This place way expensive food wasn't good enough worth it  Just overrated over priced Las Vegas restaurant  <EOR> My boyfriend took Salute past Saturday dinner because realllly wanted see them flaming vodka sauce pasta tableside!

special one  huge block parmesan wheel your table pour vodka set fire melt cheese  something similar except don't set anything fire    but Salute set fire! definitely joy able watch happen  melt cheese pour pasta  cooked vodka sauce into cheeeese mix it  Afterwards serve plate you  Great entertainment value! taste    gotta honest gets little mundane while  think if added something else it'd turn better  Also pasta use normal  fettuccine wavy  guess pasta house  urge slurp ramen noodles because wavy haha    Overall Salute nice place dine in  little awkward sort fancy place inside local casino  just seems place me  only prices little high side  Then slow server  Maybe just haha  Bright note if gamble players card use your rewards points here!
