Good place check  5 5  <EOR> I wanted try Peruvian restaurant family while town wanted close airport since sister getting around dinner time two options looked at  decided option compared down street because looked lot more spacious  noticed place brand new it only open few weeks when expected them still getting into swing things and were    We seated table clearly small size party no way could fit all food once  eventually moved bigger table  pretty slow night wasn't really any reason seated such but assuming lack experience all   For appetizers ordered Papa la Huancaina Causa de Pollo Salchipapas appetizers  against ordering Salchipapas hot dogs fries but dad insisted  Huancaina sauce great Causa good too   We ordered few pitchers chicha morada purple corn drink because drinking if you're eating peruvian food  just seems natural  drink tasty but hadn't chilled weren't given ice it  Back Peru used having chilled drinks all time but different story when back 'Murica   For entrees collectively ordered Lomo Saltado x3 Aji de Gallina x2 Carapulcra x1  Most family tried lomo before think big hit time Aji de Gallina because creamy sauce just delicious  other dishes also very good  When asked some aji rice pleasantly surprised when brought quite large dipping dish it  good!  I give restaurant 4 5 because know new restaurant work kinks wasn't much hassle those things wrong anyway  food great! <EOR> Random tid bit made feel authentic place asked if wanted water without ice  Excellent service but little patient aren't flare pinned sycophants forced hover over chains    Tried chinese Peruvian fried rice chaufa they president Alberto Fujimori sense came giant whole fried shrimp  good enough three people lot home    Dining companion El trio del sabor giant deep fried frutti did mare  Also good    I'll back later try more nuanced dishes definitely want try some new desserts   far looks solid choice Peruvian food  <EOR> The food GREAT !!! portions HUGE !!!
