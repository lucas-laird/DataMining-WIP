Oh My!!!! HEAVEN!!!! Lovely CLEAN facility super fresh food great choices!! Friendly staff decent prices!!  found new lunch spot!! YUM!!!! <EOR> I frequented some other Zabas locations town excited when new location Plaza Hotel opened since close where work     I lunch happy see ordering process menu prices same other locations  staff fast friendly  Although ordering chicken burrito bowl things odd    The first issue encountered didn't any fountain drinks only bottled Pepsi products cost $2 50 per bottle  over neighboring fast food places fountain drink if want   overpriced bottle soda price lunch over $11    Then only seating available some tipsy uncomfortable tables chairs 50 feet away restaurant  While sitting homeless looking person walks table cardboard sign saying he stranded needs money just stands 2 feet away food waiting give money      Encountering folks outside casinos downtown Las Vegas pretty commonplace but inside Plaza Casino? person other tables area did same thing   person finally left own didn't see any security come through     I very sketchy vibe whole experience which probably prevent going back particular Zabas any other restaurant Plaza matter  shame really looking forward place opening   Although still give Zabas three stars food being good  But Plaza really needs clean its act  <EOR>
