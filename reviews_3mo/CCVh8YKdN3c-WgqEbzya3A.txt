The food average breakfast lunch café    My only problem as employees café give exactly order  Now know big deal but irks when place order tell them specifically want give anyway    For example first time stopped breakfast asked just bacon eggs  No potato no bread  told them couldn't eat don't mind paying extra items receiving  course when food came did plate potatoes bread  Sadly waste food throw away  could simply avoided if actually listed me    Then second time came breakfast I thought would give second chance said same thing  even told them first experience promised would give potatoes bread  But course when came it  hard understand someone does want bread potatoes am sure common thing  Many people request all time  mean come if allegoric touching all food  guess would throw away whole $15 breakfast???  Needless say learned lesson when elsewhere breakfast rest week  <EOR> Market Cafe Vdara only food available Vdara hotel now Silk Road restaurant closed    They serve short order breakfast all day sandwiches other simple items available well small market necessities   I omelet fine liked could pick choose any ingredients wanted list  spinach tomatoes mushrooms bacon gruyere  came toast some potatoes cold greasy laughable fruit salad consisted 1 tablespoon finely diced melon rind  did gave little jars strawberry jam imported Austria toast elegant touch   After order give number table service consists bringing your food you  isn't useful don't bring cutlery napkins  pick your own dinky plastic forks knives little packets salt pepper supply corner  Also didn't bring smoothie forgot give soup well   The strawberry banana smoothie pretty tasty if little sweet very big considering $8 price tag  <EOR> Overpriced burger fries slow service   Can't expect much only food available hotel    <EOR>
