I thought Wasabi Jane's just another fast food stand located Food Court within Venetian Casino Resort just doesn't quite measure rest stands  Having two kids tow family doesn't luxury sit through fine dining extended meals  food stands stopped dinner   The ordering process fine asked cup ice water proceeded charge 10 cents ice water  When inquired charge replied plastic cup   life could locate cup charge menu anywhere false advertising some type bad business practice which later report BBB   Their udon noodle just ok nothing outstanding but charge left sour taste mouths   Oh just your reference walk 10 steps Panda Express same food court ice waters yes plural extra plates extra napkins fortune cookies utensils all FREE! Never going back Wasabi Jane's  Another thing spell name Wassabi Jane's receipt  Anyone cannot spell own names properly really should operating any business  <EOR>
