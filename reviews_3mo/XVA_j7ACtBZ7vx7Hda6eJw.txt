I'm biggest fan cranberries never tried Bobbie  However cheese steak exactly right touch melty gooey cheesiness   Try mushroom cheese steak sweet peppers yum  Service decor could nicer but you'll forget right your first bite  <EOR> I visit place every time town!!!  I order medium turkey sandwich cheese mayo onions seasonings   it!   The turkey roasted fresh daily  shred there  bread always fresh tasty    Sometimes you'll wait while your sandwich but let tell worth waiting for!  By far best sandwiches town  wish them Southern California  put Subway Quizno's shame  <EOR>
