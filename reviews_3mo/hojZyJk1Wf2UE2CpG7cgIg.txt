What found amazingly fresh burger cooked order   pickles nice touch long bun length bun toasted just right! only knock bacon just ok need add some sauce burger mustard only thing there  But Im sure if play around you'll find your perfect way  First impression thought still lacks signature taste department compared N but best #2 found     saying lot!   The custard die for! Tried turtle sundae wasn't disappointed all  think next time Hawaiian one    Actually wife choose next knows!  The place clean people friendly very inviting  Way different then other steak burger places Vegas located near Southpoint Casino    I totally back!! <EOR> Cool new place  lot Steak Shake except without shakes  Steak Custard  badum bum ordered traditional California burger chili cheese fries turttle custard concrete    The California burger would expect traditional California steakburger it tastes just steak shake california burger   thinnly sliced steak burger all California burger fixings   Now love chili cheese fries! big fan chili cheese fries only because filling full off fast  steak burger chunks nacho cheese mini cubes onion it  french fries also those thinly cut fries which all more better  taste more chili cheese thickness fries which loved   Now turtle custard concrete  DELISH! custard nice thick super solid! rich creamy  all fixing turtle any thing  pecans caramel chocolate just made custard taste good  If prefer premixed want just sip concrete  If dig helpings top where eat best best first sundae  <EOR> I hair cut Roosters those folks told place because owners Freddy's smart invite neighboring business around them day before open free event     business owners very smart idea because attentive client listening them least half hour    but just remember win them over which Freddy did   Freddy's right name all Custard Steakburger     forgot bring carb blockers but doubled fat trappers tackle #7 combo double steak burger Bacon      Ordering painless but watching them put together Hawaiian blended custard painful   it's looked pretty killer!      My order done four minutes very happy appearance burger    caramelized finish old snoop burgers really miss place but happy old bacon but heck burger done right     folks nicely season burger while cooking separates them Steak n Shake     The manager does take rounds dining room checks your doing always feel breaks new business listening your customers feedback going your biggest tool success     Good luck Freddys you're right track  <EOR> The burger carton Freddy's proclaims every order special order   Maybe explains missing top bun burger  wasn't great first impression food waiting five minutes drive through window  Luckily planned eating car noticed before home  headed back inside approached presumed manager wearing polo shirt he friendly apologetic   Once he bunned back car tried double steakburger California style  California style comes American cheese lettuce tomatoes raw sliced onions typical thousand island style special sauce  burger smashed crispy Steak 'n Shake style  tasty but felt little small $4 69 price   Despite bad first impression probably give Freddy's another try  chili cheese fries calling me    <EOR> I'm impress!!!! Very disappointing   Patty melt patty thin crispy juicy all over cooked   Onions inside burger onions skin pleasant     No flavor  worth it  Waste time money  Over price too  Just opinion  <EOR> When sitting Freddy's enjoying burger heard some criticism nearby tables   think overarching criticism Freddy's thin almost crunchy burgers merely indicates people seemed confused steakburger IS   steakburger MEANT thin crunchy    whole point   guess people region just don't yet   If want your burger thick juicy you're wrong place   case recommend Badger Cafe Tropicana     However if you're just LOVE steakburger you've come right place   originally Midwest college down street Steak 'N Shake king steakburger disclaimer Steak 'N Shake Southpoint representative Midwest steakburger is   they don't seem know right    SHOCKED find Freddy's does steakburger BETTER Steak 'N Shake!  meat flavorful cheese very melty sorta 'N Out bun light buttery   fry sauce well both burgers fries   Speaking fries    think fries most notable difference between Freddy's Steak 'N Shake   Both chains known shoestring fries   However Freddy's fries fried golden perfection seasoned incredible seasoning salt blend   SNS known undercooked underseasoned cold fries only find palatable if drenched piping hot cheese sauce     I haven't tried custard   don't eat custard but curious   might fiancé order next time live vicariously through him   Five stars exactly delicious high quality STEAKBURGER   isn't fair rate any other way   If isn't your cup tea    fine!

Portions pretty big could probably share   burgers thin come everything   The only thing seem bit more greasy other places  just opened still few kinks service but overall nice change bigger fastfood chains  <EOR> This place good but great   They lot offer lot potential but could some improvements   cheese burger which good but anything special necessarily  Reminded In n out because also own sauce  If someone wants eat I'd no problem but don't think necessarily back just myself   Something note if go horrible line area   lucky seemed during lull but 3 minutes line incredibly long uncomfortable because people didn't know where stand kind funny   Also WAAAYYY many workers walking around standing idly   made super awkward when family trying eat every few minutes someone asked meal is  not gonna lie but 3 minutes nothing going change answer haha point kind wondering if they're going many workers why don't bring food instead calling numbers it? Just thought  <EOR> Great burgers   amazing onion rings  excellent service   I being indecisive changed mind 3x drive thru   as apologized employ said change your mind many times like   refreshingly sweet attitude  Drive Order employ reached hand shake mine said nice meet name heaven    I never drive thru attendant shake hand introduce herself  then all which great experience     the manager gave comp chocolate custard   which delish!    crazy cool fast food joint  If havent been   GO  Another bonus   there no tip jar drive thru window <EOR> I haven't patty melt years! just good remembered! Love skinny fries Dr  Pepper! Next time bring kids! <EOR> This solid place fast food reminded lot In N Out variety frozen custards available    The burgers shaped very thin but also spread wide  fries thin cut  appearance meal gives Freddy's unique characteristic remember by   The frozen custards come large variety toppings which main draw  However if just looking frozen custard burgers would recommend venturing down street Nielson's some frozen custard your taste buds explode  <EOR> I just drive thru ordered chicken sandwich lettuce wrapped six patty lettuce wrapped steakburger   When drive thru associates could believe ordering six patty steakburger  upgraded ten patties upon request calling Freddy's Challenge  took home although told them eat there  insisted next time come by    Pictures posted  <EOR> Thank fellow Yelpers helping expect potential unexpected   As others state isn't your typical savory juicy meat loaded burger  burger much thinner patty bit crispy on outside great toppings all honesty better fast food burgers had  Decided ol' #1 because if #1 can't done right fast food restaurant then can't anything right  Burger included two patties 2 slices cheese onion pickle decided them substitute mustard Freddy's sauce  Excellent choice if say myself  burger cooked perfect crispy outside overcooked inside  Freddy's sauce made burger fries spectacular  order but happy see Freddy's seasoning salts right counter available use prior leaving restaurant  Great service food quickly definitely plan going back   The decor inside restaurant great very 50's looking more importantly CLEAN  often walk into fast food chain restaurant see tables look flock 4yo's dominated smorgasbord?   I can't wait back try some custard  If taste half good pictures look may checking back 5 star rating  <EOR> Ugh shoestring fries   Why?  Why?  Why?
