<EOR> 2nd visit norm's since gf having oil changed nearby   place busier last visit  good thing   tried country fried steak eggs biscuit   gf egg white veggie omelet bagel   Again good service timely refills coffee water food came quick   the food Norm's comes short again   CFS small overcooked   gravy decent though prefer see chunks meat gravy   biscuit crumbled cut good   GF did veggie omelet but bagel wasn't fresh   I think next oil change include visit Norm's <EOR> Norm    must Frank   Sometimes if high expectations place tend hypercritical   course most reviews assessment weighted compensating factors   wasn't bad but expecting more   If breakfast place only breakfast better good!  The place inside more sandwich shop   plain quite stark but close   want breakfast place warm inviting   If warm inviting then want bistro style    something   literally no atmosphere here   The service okay   kid trying hard but he seemed uncomfortable   always thought serving tables breakfast place required zero talent but realized some level ability this     The Food chicken fried steak basted eggs taters   chicken fried steak tough   okay eat but tough lacked seasoning   basted eggs sub par want NO color basted eggs!  Turn heat down   taters good   portions prices good some value here   The chicken fried steak supposed come biscuits but out   actually didn't mind because later day which tells biscuits fresh every day    I appreciate fact place trying quality homemade type breakfast place   does cary weight review   would back second chance   just wanted more      ** side note   saw owner leave   He car parked right front   hate that   Why would tie customer's parking spot?  Oy veh! <EOR> I read yelp reviews place decided stop hubby  The food great huge portions $8 10  fresh young waiter polite attentive    The only thing really left bad taste mouth halfway through realized did hash browns hubby did fruit bowl which included cost super breakfast combos I forget name exactly but first thing list   My hubby convinced ask since already such huge breakfasts  still felt ya but dammit paying it  full even shortage hash browns take pancakes home stuffed   Other that   its convenient location menu simple back receipt stamped $3 off coupon fab freddy's carwash should want those  Not sure if I'd return   maybe groupon would  <EOR> Love attentive staff great eats all around    sure why others posting giving place such poor rating   eat least twice week again prefer locally owned Mom Pop Cafes over Dennys  IHOP   <EOR> Great neighborhood place breakfast lunch  Basic menu food but done well  simplicity best small cafes great job full flavors fresh ingredients presentation  Good service friendly welcoming staff  <EOR> I've Huevos Ranchero alot places alot states including Mexico    Norm hooks BEST HUEVOS RANCHERO EVER ! ! ! its magic cure hangovers  I've also tried biscuits gravy which excellent im very picky bout biscuits n gravy very noticable use fresh ingredients everything in house lunch menu looks very appetising also very importantly AFFORDABLE  great views city desert breeze park  This place goldmine but dont tell anybody cause pissed when catches gotta wait line huevos rancheros   its nice see owner operator  great personal touch <EOR>
