Beware review WHINY   City Centre Cafe serves downtown lunch crowd state federal buildings  serve sandwiches soups salads related fare  food fine though $7 sandwiches smaller side  number average meals but latest made pissy  Here's happened I asked manager owner working register if used solid white tuna tuna melt  He said yes ordered one  But tasted sandwich knew immediately chunk light sometimes called chunk white   Anyone eats buys canned tuna knows 2 grades solid white being higher quality more expensive chunk light white being lower quality more miscellaneous fish parts cheaper  brought sandwich guy told sure chunk light white he said asked if wanted something instead    So dude straight lied thought wouldn't able taste difference??? really don't care if City Centre Cafe wants save few bucks using lower grade tuna but don't lie your customers!!!! said maybe  whiny complaint  canned tuna all  but whole thing just pissed off   If hands big enough would karate chop place  HYAH! <EOR>
