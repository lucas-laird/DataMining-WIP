I generally hate restaurants Apostrophe league Friday's Chili's Applebee's   you know mean   wasn't fan Friday's until caught happy hour appetizer specials   A ton apps 1 2 3 dollars piece   walk 10  2 people grub your fat little heart's content   Americana appetizers aren't hard screw most stuff pretty good   Chips salsa chicken strips onion rings artichoke dip nothing astounding but amount price can't strapped for cash night nosh  <EOR>
