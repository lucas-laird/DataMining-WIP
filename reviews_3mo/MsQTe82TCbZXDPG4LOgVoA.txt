First time location   Not nice Summerlin during bit lunch rush  felt bad staff lady really rude a customer but employees did best demands   Next front space cadet looking chick she pulled list 6 orders annoying! She couldn't read hand writing peoples orders stood called everyone then annoyed staff wasn't working fast enough When finally turn order bread started burn instead making arrangements fan blow smoke she just opened oven smoke filled room made everyone's eyes water   My wrap made haste sloppy came unwrapped  husband's sub turn okay  We'll sticking summerlin location now on  <EOR>
