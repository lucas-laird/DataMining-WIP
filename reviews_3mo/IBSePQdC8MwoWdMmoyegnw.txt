This place formerly known The Junction recently changed Five Star Tavern   Anyway twice already figured I'd write short review   This place definitely lot bigger looks  Very spacious inside 360 bar gambling machines them  two pool tables western side venue right when walk in  look they're pretty good condition too  times renovating keeps looking better better everytime here  cool place chill watch some sports while drinking some cheap beer  also complimentary drink if you're gambling which quite nice  The kitchen yet ready bartender told but open week's time  definitely back here  kind dead both times but expect change once word gets place    Gripe 1 wish turned volume T Vs whenever game playing because definitely quiet sometimes  Plus love when hear game even if low volume     Gripe 2 No top medium shelp liquor  No Crown Jack Ciroc Patron Don Julio  actually made really sad All all though can't complain much place back! If know am going place more just couple times then gotta qualify least 4 stars D <EOR>
