The food's bad   typical Jack Box but drive thru service location HORRIBLE employees rudest met any fast food joint  9 10 times you'll asked pull front bring even if there's no cars behind you  Then sit wait until them feels walking your car  Maybe getting old but isn't Drive Thru supposed prevent  finding parking spot sitting waiting idea? DON'T if you're hurry looking friendly service  <EOR>
