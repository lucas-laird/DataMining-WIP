This blast! Trekkies heaven non assimilated really enjoy too  There 2 separate experiences   Klingon Experience far superior Borg IF you're only going there's no doubt  do  Also if buy tickets online ahead time good year save $10 ish don't stand line if your tickets printed out  <EOR> I give 5 star review based solely fact allowed stand bridge Enterprise D   The Borg experience also scared living hell female companion while classic experience world  especially transporter room   I'm first admit much attraction 100% cheese but just cool walk around corridors Enterprise   If any future upgrades hope actual integrate experience harkens back original series films! <EOR>
