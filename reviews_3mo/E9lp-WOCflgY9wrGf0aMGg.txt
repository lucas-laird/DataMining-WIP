I drove hundreds times  Mexican catering truck close construction workers unemployed men looking work  Needless say never felt need stop especially since taking chances street food heard nothing want enjoy every meal  husband more adventurous he began frequent place maybe year ago  morning dropping off work tackling horrendous hangover usual cure N yet open  He made left turn Decatur Blue Diamond towards Southern Highlands he decided stop Cukis desperation! He pleasantly surprised  He would stop talking it  He he said most f****** delicious breakfast burrito ever!! He began least twice week  Sometimes before leaving work morning        He started bring shrimp cocktail refused eat along everything else he there   He would take 6 year old every morning She would always quesadilla  would sometimes eat there  She loved  there! He began well known call Gringo !  Well broke down tasted burrito and yes very very good then tacos also very tasty fresh  but wasn't until shrimp cocktail regretting trying it!! call Cocktail de camarones although thought ceviche  Whatever good  Fresh chunks avocado beautifully clean tasting tomato sauce crisp tiny onions wonderful seasonings cilantro! light yet satisfying healthy  might wrong but really seems really take lot pride making it!!       conclusion share put business Yelpy map really deserve it! way haven't personally stopped myself but husband tells clientele changed great deal  Sadly he only Gringo anymore lot busier    Sorry  don't quite know hours days  assuming open very early weekdays maybe done 5  <EOR>
