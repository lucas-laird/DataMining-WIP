Fries over seasoned if ask NO season lightly seasoned! <EOR> Horrible service horrible food! should allowed call Philly cheese steak  recommend anyone wasting time money!!! <EOR> My husband daughter July 7 2013  waiting open excited try it  husband steak wrap chicken wrap  Both delicious but especially steak wrap  Both came veggies inside sauteed zucchini broccoli chickpeas  huge unexpected bonus  assumed would fatty cheesy thing but wasn't  Both very large though which good bad depending your perspective amount self control have   Major plus highchair   Negative didn't free cups water  If want water buy sodia cup bottled water   terrible way save money especially Las Vegas   I plan back! <EOR> Yum yum yummy!  First let state never eaten cheesesteak Philly can't compare those   say cheesesteaks eaten super tasty!  twice enjoyed cheesesteaks both times   even craving which why ended second time   should say something right there!  Both times location cheesesteak combo   $7 99 yummy cheesesteak fries soda   just right size totally pig basket goodness!  season meat something really sets apart other cheesesteaks past   almost Cajun seasoning but quite   really good though!  fries super fat steak fries come seasoning them well   cooked perfectly both times   would back fries alone!    My hubby really likes gyros well   also chicken options menu items those into beef   also wraps kabobs salads really something everyone   haven' tried items because am love cheesesteaks though   YUMMY! <EOR> I  love  philly  steak  sandwiches!     first  visit  unfortunately   last    philly  meat   pretty  bland  really  any  flavor    paid   extra  cheese but  could  clearly  see   he   cooking   he  did    so    telling  them  opened   package  back    placed     closed   back  up    sandwich    worth   price could    allot  better   next  time   stick   pop's  <EOR> So when saw Philly sign super excited!  Philly cheese steaks most favorite food groups!  Yes said food groups!!! sign long before place opened   Everytime drove did quick glance over see if big OPEN sign front   Finally graced Centennial area presence opened doors   gave bit let them work kinks Saturday finally made time try out   Their menu BAM right front you   wording big there's no need squint which great thing   Nothing worse being able see menu's small print   items very simple point much fact forgot put side dishes drinks carry   Right away asked if kids menu   nope no kids menu   girl counter little flustered explaining things could daughter   Nothing kids really    Minus star that   Big bummer   Immediately knew meal would strained because knew poor girl gonna sit watching eat while stomach growling   would thought would hotdogs if anything   Something consider guys!!  Just saying   I ordered chicken philly combo   said comes side but remember don't list sides   don't remember else offered but ordered mine fries   BF ordered steak philly combo onions mushrooms fries   Immediately he asked if American cheese YES it   having huge deal breaker BF   While ordering girl friendly   cook owner? said nothing even though he standing right front us   biggest pet peeve especially if he owner     So anyways food came looked amazeballs except could count fries had 9 fries  sad face Then daughter started digging fries   What? Hey wait minute!  want those   quickly gave some money order some fries   Poor girl  LOL  $2 00 fries     The sandwiches lets just say FANTASTIC!  bread fresh little flaky but enough substance didn't soggy   chicken cooked perfectly all flavorful  fries good   big fan steak fries but seasoning them pretty great like sweet salty taste     The restaurant itself really hot   front place all windows which probably hard keep cool?  guessing   But hot   Ick   place really clean girl wiped tables when she wasn't busy   Sunny 106 5 playing background   hate music many small restaurants resort that I guess because think universal   But Journey did come point all good   several other people while which always great!  Imma big fan helping local small businesses!!!  I cannot wait back!  Next time considering taking if temp hasn't changed getting some BK daughter prior  ***definitely consider pack dogs kids!  don't want exclude people when whole family enjoy meal!  Just helpful suggestion  <EOR> I ate ton cheesesteaks day  tried damn near all them Las Vegas  used eat Pops Triple Play  good but when found Philly Steak Express knocked out  cheesesteaks much favor  cheese melts your mouth  steak very subtle spice suprises when bite it  bread soft nice flavor  Fresh cut mushrooms great bonus   happy didn't come can  onions fresh also cooked into meat providing nice combo  fries thick steak fries nice seasoning  service outstanding  fast friendly always conversation guests  Try them out  disappointed  <EOR> The staff's customer service skills need some work i e  say hello people when walk thank them order etc      food other hand very good   ordered #2 combo Philly Steak fries soda $7 99    sandwich perfect size lunch VERY tasty   use steak fries which huge fan but  far deal breaker me   However would seen another handful fries   portion fries give just doesn't coincide sandwich   Overall very good since they're right across street work sure back! <EOR>
