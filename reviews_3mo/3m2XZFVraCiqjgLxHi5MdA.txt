I'd heard place few times then highest rating food Las Vegas Zagat guide figured worth try   However made big mistake inquiring far away place Strip  Mandalay $25 cab ride that's each way    warned!  cabbie drove back told drivers LOVE taking people Strip   Heh   The food really good though   $45 prix fixe deal 3 courses which good if think eat much   appetizers salads entrees sized pretty well keep mind   husband really enjoyed Asian slaw accompanied seared tuna he's addict say? scallops tasty overcooked although slightly overseasoned   Sunday night which conveniently happened 1 2 price bottles wine night   HUGE plus that!  cab company sends drivers very quickly end your meal least don't wait long ride back  <EOR>
