Very good service  Little bit way  Great prices quantity food served  Chessy garlic bread very good  Thick crust pizza good  <EOR> Very mediocre food bad service  around 8 45PM looked close  When order we dining in guy taking order seemed act if weren't standing right waiting order  he realized wasn't going away he reluctantly took order  all meat pizza garlic knots wings  Pizza ok mostly because cheese salami good  meatball just awful almost ruined pizza  Only lots ranch crushed pepper saved complete failure  Wings good but nothing special couldn't myself home bag frozen Tyson wings bottle Frank's hot sauce  Last but DEFINITELY least knots totally burnt bottom! guys working back didn't even wait finish leaving building before turning off lights  said highly recommend eat place unless already Groupon did    which case just carry because service unacceptable  <EOR>
