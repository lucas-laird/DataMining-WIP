Please don't try fuse traditional Taiwanese dish using Udon  Only flavor dominated bowl salt  Tonkatsu Ramen clear brown broth  Again Tonkatsu know      but then again ramen connoisseur but different tastier versions around town  Salt again dominant flavor  Before anyone says anything realize Tonkatsu salty but other ramen houses taster pork flavor permeate  best items appetizers     sadly   If want more flavorful noodle experience around corner Downtown Summerlin visit Rice Republic  walk 80 feet Feast buffet bowl udon Asian section buffet  Asian Approved  <EOR> My husband came lunch seated right away bar area  restaurant itself looked very nice  Open kitchen where see chef prepare your meal  decorated place noodle bowls which added nice touch  Now moving food    ordered spicy beef brisket noodle tonkatsu ramen   noodle house broth breaks soup  broth tonkatsu ramen bland  add soy sauce other spices decent  certainly $12 ramen  spicy beef noodle alright although choice using udon type soup off  span time having lunch three customers complained food  soup sent back because served lukewarm  couple ordered fried egg rolls sent back lettuce serve dirty! complained lack flavor soup which chef just shrugged off saying tastes fine him! Needless say never going back  <EOR> Worst noodle house experience ever   Paid $ 12 bowl water   call yourself Noodle Bar if can't even Tonkatsu Ramen right  Your better off getting pack top ramen   Good luck getting Asian community eat here <EOR> Such cute spot! Super trendy yummy sounding menu items  Unfortunately felt food wasnt good sounded paper  <EOR> I craving Asian tonight even though shouldn't be! decided head 8 noodle bar   I am stickler duck  No matter where always it  Today ordered duck bao  very traditional Peking style since capacity but great flavors  always it  skin crispy wish duck skin add on! sauce always crave since fresh  overly sweet over powers duck  great compliment duck    Always second must have shrimp toast! don't know but staple when come here  Soft toasted bread rock shrimp sauces I feel bad having asked were but practically inhaled it! good  Upscale homey works  Very comforting weather   I know noodle bar did ramen time  But again again pork belly bowl enhancement soft poached egg  Dont wrong fried rice great all but simpler things white rice meat egg  sauce char siu pork cooked always consistent  Great balance flavor perfect amount size bowl  round all MUST egg  friend tried last time without egg but when gave own bowl she ordered egg hers   Service improved  seating now according your party instead being overlooked skipped out  manager great  He always very welcoming takes time feedback guests see service food went  Today wanted dessert but stop myself because getting full  But would recommend others YES dessert menu  Even though listed just know there  always ask mango roll! wish mango season already!   Overall am improvement last visit friend  <EOR> Went 3 weeks opened very slow only few tables occupied  After eating could see why The duck bao very fatty bland  Followed Chinese sausage fried rice hard very ordinary something you'd Panda Express Finished spicy beef soup also very bland lukewarm   All all nothing compared asian restraunts Spring Mountain Its American version Asian food lacks authenticity SOUL  Dont waste your time take extra 15 minutes China Town    <EOR> I heard lot 8 Noodle Bar recently couldn't wait try it   finally chance last week only food great but fast service! smell food just kind lures in   Can't wait back next time near Red Rock! <EOR> Seeing dishes come first reaction place way overpricedfor portions give    We ordered pork belly bowl comes only two pieces pork belly no bigger hot wheel rice  pieces pork did quarters biggest piece just fat  pork belly also traditional braised pork belly lot sweetness it   We also ordered shoyu ramen which smelled amazing bur actually tasted very bland  drink bowl think soup amazing smell coming off only disappointed its lack flavor     Lastly ordered buns two each duck pork belly  weren't bad but different probably because more traditional tastes  Both spicy mayo them which made really sweet pork belly super greasy   To sum if your going come pork belly dish flavor your experience more pleasant  If you're going come late night stop seating 11 30 though choose 12 but least take out  <EOR> So first time being place craving some kind Asian fusion touch class did meet expectations   looking through all reviews yes new restaurant but God sakes give another chance    have open mind!   Ambiance When friend walked felt hominess area although smaller place then expected still Asian theme liked especially  bars made bowls   pretty clever  seated promptly hostess very friendly service top notched! couldn't ask better service always top things making sure taking care of!
