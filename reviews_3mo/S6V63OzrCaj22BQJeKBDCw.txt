You're giving Pseudo Mexican fast food joint FOUR STARS??  nuts ?  Well actually giving them 3 5 stars but there's no option half star   People always ask same question every time drag them alllll way Blue Diamond just Crisp Rolled Burritos when there's Taco Bell just down street me   The grub spot really good though for deep fried fast food 1 4lb crisp tacos just way better Taco Bell Del Taco opinion but true favorites rolled crisp chicken burritos    Imagine chicken Alfredo sauce wrapped flour tortilla deep fried until tortilla crispy flaky but chicken all dried Mind really Alfredo Sauce think but just sauce reminds of    really hard explain but just such good grub!  The only reason doesn't full 4 stars if fact grubby travel station reeks smoke travel station funk could never enjoy meal comfort fresh fryer always end eating road  <EOR>
