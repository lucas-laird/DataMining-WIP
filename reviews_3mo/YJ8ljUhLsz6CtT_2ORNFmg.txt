Deviled Eggs served interesting way   egg whites served separately sprinkled parsley yolks served small cup scoop put much wanted into egg whites  yolks smashed mixed smokey bacon cheese    far best deviled eggs ever had   all experience 5 star   The second night came shortly 5 PM dinner menu   again sat bar   first beer ordered but offered sample another beer might like   bartender very helpful   ordered Fish Chips   took 25 minutes food which little long but thought might due lot folks ordering right around 5 PM when start dinner menu   figured if anyone could fish chips right would Gordon Ramsay however disappointed meal   definitely best fish chips ever had   fish OK batter really good but fish little dry tough overcooked   prefer fish more moist flaky   thicker piece fish would probably held better cooking   potatoes biggest disappointment though   expected chips french fries big blocks potatoes hand cut rectangles which boiled baked fried into state blandness would never expect Gordon Ramsay product   hard ends overdone   seasoned all no salt when removed deep fryer no flavor all   However mushy peas outstanding!!!  never really liked mushy peas mean really would anything called mushy peas?  However combination whole baby peas mushy peas some seasoning eating entire portion a first me  In general bartenders very helpful friendly   Would nice someone checked dinner let know status when long without getting meal but  small point   I liked decorations   pretty noisy music playing but much couldn't hear each other talk people next us   pretty busy 5 PM   Probably even busier later on   I would again but Fish Chips definitely Deviled Eggs though  <EOR> An excellent Xmas day dinner!  upscale British pub food done really really well   am already looking forward next visit    We chose eat bar since couple basketball games on   way could also ask bartender beer selection   bartender let sample few ended going pints Innis Gunn Moa   Those $8 75 each but Pacifico Corona no point going stuff anywhere else      The first entree Dublin Brisket which set pumpernickel bread bowl   bowl filled hearty tender chunks beef cheese sauerkraut well side thousand island   3 standard steak fries=1 fry only 4 them which enough     My wife wanted Shepard's Pie just hearing those two words gave flashbacks terrible school cafeteria mush poor man's English lasagna if will   But galaxies away past   Savory word first bite   Each spoonful filled buttery mashed potatoes carrots peas slow cooked beef lamb   truly awesome dish would gladly any cold weather day     We skipped all good looking appetizers small plates just dessert   Everyone recommended Sticky Toffee Pudding  did disappoint   perfect ending indeed  <EOR> As Brit embarrassed eat here   terrible  Overpriced $10 side chips potatoes food freshly prepared dry very warm snapper mussels clams old cold  Very disappointing everything Gordon Ramsey tells establishments do  wine lst belongs 5 star  restaurant bar   wish he would stop using British flag he representing average Brit  <EOR> Ate 19th best meal Vegas  the pretzels delish Yorkshire fish chips best ever moist thick chips different good  also Shepherds Pie savory tasty  but dessert takes cake triple choc triffle peanut butter jelly cobbler total stars night  definitely eat first night every time come Vegas <EOR> We arrived Vegas 22nd  Upon entering hotel room immediately noticed magazine Gordon Ramsay front Ramsay takes over Vegas Being HUGE fan read giddy when found only did Pub Grill open already but Burgr planned open very night!! Turns opened earlier week but OPEN      We decided hit Pub Grill Saturday night  Josh waiter swear he ESP  Every time mentioned something needed POOF he hand said   hey could use       jokingly asked if bulldog lamp wired  Josh simply amazing  can't say enough  would say he gave best service all places ate year  He gets brownie points remembering name Darlene many people two minutes later forget call Diane Donna   something D    Ok now food  ordered Shephard's Pie boyfriend ordered Lamb Burger  Shephard's Pie good first  mashed potatoes amazing  However quickly discovered didn't care lamb first time ever trying it  ate 1 2 dish  wanted love but just couldn't  boyfriend loved lamb burger said top 10 burgers  ordered dessert sticky toffee pudding he chocoloate trifle  OH GOD!!! sticky toffee pudding die for  could eat everyday!! warm sauce topping cake side frozen cream just fantastic  tried boyfriend's chocolate trifle incredible  Layers chocolate brownie bottom served two little chocolate cookies very cute    Pub Grill your typical Pub Grill       Gordon Ramsay does again!! <EOR> We tried Hell's kitchen burger  good  expecting more flavor   Fries garlicky  Service fast made sure always full glass drink  <EOR> After series meals designed appeal lowest common denominator palette glad some flavor packed comfort food   At Pub greeted warm soft pretzels acompanied whipped butter cheddar spreads  Beef cheeks tender tasty  normally dislike cooked carrots but prepared well maintained snappiness  Shepherd's pie standout shredded braised lamb rather usual ground preparation    After watching Gordon's Nightmare shows good hear he practices he preaches each staff member tasted dishes serve could describe them well  server also knowledgeable Belgian UK beers    I even glad hear disagreement favorites good confirmation sharing opinion rather promoting certain chef signature item  end decided complete meal blueberry cobbler topped peanut butter crumble peanut butter creme fraiche instead more traditional sticky toffee pudding   We'll back  <EOR> My absolute favorite pub point   did take long time food come out   did however notice free drink didn't even say anything   +1 point being aware preemptive   give some bread service assorted pretzels butter horseradish cheese rivals Culinary Dropouts pretzel appetizers   just bread!  food worth wait   potato puree rich delicious   chicken perfect   drink menu iPad four tried all spot on   Enjoy! <EOR> Slow key word! little bit Terribly slow! 30 45 min appetizers same entree! Fish fishy small portion! Appetizer little burger bites good  Others party impressed    Service people very nice personable but kitchen disaster killer!! $50 head plus tip won't again! Server embarrassed kitchen  beer good server knowledgeable  Even reflection weeks later No stars kitchen wait time food fish poor! Server 4 0  Overall 1 stars  December 26  Unfortunately service cannot overcome food since  why came   I would caution accepting high reviews face value  Appears must stellar opening served drinks because good reviews rarely focused Dinner food but liked bar  Guess depends if eat drink!  Overall left short trip Vegas feeling wasted good meal opportunity given price just many other outstanding choices waste dollar precious time here! Appears Mr  Ramsey better hyping restaurant TV shows producing restaurant  Save your time money  <EOR> I saw place while exploring casino realized just opened earlier month  decided take sister belated Christmas gift she many others Gordan Ramsey fan aspires also cook amazing food day   Luckily no need physically stand line placed name waitlist roamed around until estimated time gave return which table ready   After sat down wait several minutes before server came but staff food more made it  waitress Elyse very sociable when she arrived chatting while before taking order  Because time constraint sister decided settle dessert only  We debating between sticky toffee pudding potted triple chocolate trifle both $9 10 Elyse highly recommended sticky toffee pudding decided that  disappointed overall selection all!  Sticky Toffee Pudding combination toffee pudding it's actually cake Britain toffee syrup wasn't sweet which balances cake vanilla bean ice cream made fresh daily gives nice balance between hot cold heavenly!  Overall Con getting waiter right away when sat down Pro needing physically wait line friendly staff quality dessert  Will come next time over buffets try rest menu! <EOR> Definitely truffle fries  crisps think they're called    really good you're given large helping truffles! Yum! really surprised when came table because looks 6 large fatty fries stacked top each other  When picked first surprised its weight almost dropped it    Apparently fries boiled baked then fried give great consistency!  They're still working smoothing service everything since just opened long ago  initially seated table basically no lighting  Other great experience boyfriend  <EOR> Being big fan Gordon Ramsey steakhouse high hopes place  wife ate Christmas Eve   Very disappointed  sat pub side even offered look pub menu  wasn't until ordered realized second menu  both chose fish chips  Greasy thick batter flavorless fish  Chips thick cut don't mean steak fries mean block rectangular potatoes no seasoning   If want fish chips steakhouse Paris!!!  Also place just opened Vegas packed but place half empty 9 pm   Lousy vibe music  only positive cocktails   Much better choices Vegas  <EOR> We stopped seeing Jerry Seinfeld expected wait would hour  returned 40 minutes later friendly hostess remembered table ready   The dining room very dark  asked waitress kind beers available she put iPad table scroll through walked away   It bit awkward since she didn't tell if follow directions select choice if she that   She bit slow return but very knowledgable menu drinks arrived quickly   I ordered Yorkshire Fish Chips son Bacon Wrapped Shrimp   We then served warm soft pretzels cheese spread mini loaf bread whipped butter  Honestly could just pretzels perfectly happy   Our meal arrived son's shrimp huge  Usually worried won't flavorful when jumbo but great  Cooked just right didn't try sauce but he loved all   The fish chips very good  Nothing extraordinary but did notice less oily most  tartar sauce best don't usually care tartar sauce  eagerly tried thought cocktail sauce other ramekin disappointed just ketchup   I really wished malt vinegar offered fries but time anyone available ask already full able eat them didn't bother   Even though sever slow she very friendly assume disorganized atmosphere due just being open few days   The prices line most Vegas casino dining  We would eat again  <EOR> I am huge fan Gordon Ramsey  say very disappointing experience  Food mediocre  Service great   all would expect Gordon  word sum would OVERRATED!!! <EOR> Were start let's start service  could better  sat bar Adam took care us  great time Adam guided through awesome dining experience  If bar ask Adam  However problem virtually all bar tenders named Adam  But no worries seems all above average  Ok now important part food  having Ramsey's name carries high expectations  am happy say meet  need particularly point Shepherd's Pie  something would normally avoid because stepfather's failed attempts  worst thing ever ate  Gordon's best thing ever had   back again again  Finally famous chief opens very approachable place blows away expectations  Good Job!!! <EOR> Gordon Ramsey blowing Las Vegas steakhouse Paris Pub Caesars then Burgr joint PH   someone forgot spell check sh*t!   Anyhoo back pub tastic   we attended preview dining very pleased  All servers very attentive pleasant cutest outfits!  food good very nice mix European English flair although lot selections Vegetarians  They nice ambiance Pub would suggest sure mix between restaurant bar lounge choose sit any     EXCEPT     it's VERY pricey   meal two people $125 Eesh!  husband Scottish beer he loved it!
