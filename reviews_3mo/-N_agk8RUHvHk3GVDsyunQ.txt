I ended being dragged place while back because father brother's new wife blues musician plays regular basis  Quite honestly being far north Las Vegas Blvd  not so good part town that takes long time no less wasn't expecting much place    I definitely wrong    This place isn't half bad! food items all superb plus decent selection things boot  staff pretty flexible no problem preparing some chicken fingers even though weren't listed menu  Needless say mostly BBQ type items menu however everything far just fine   The actual restaurant seating behind building small patio area also where blues bands play restaurant sometimes has  fair amount seating whole lot but never seen every seat full either    This place obscure location difficult reach but ultimately worth it  food entertainment alike both top notch  easy recommend  <EOR>
