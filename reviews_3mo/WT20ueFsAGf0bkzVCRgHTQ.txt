I felt bit old place   Always full younger crowd   Neon lights fill dark lit pool hall   There's VIP room which rent drinking relaxing singing karaoke   There's also arcades located corner room   Prices above decent   give three stars because place nice roomy won't knock place   However just seems trouble other customers there   also situated best part Spring Mt  <EOR> Sure place full younger crowd  But don't feel old all types people welcomed  Besides when you're young you're hip    hip good  Location isn't such great place but seems good location most seen people all over Vegas there   It's also centered near karaoke lounge hookah lounge  several Asian stores surrounding near streets Chinatown   The prices pretty flexible if can't afford enough game itself always use quarter tables  If enough staff give discount  There's also music choose yourself provided along other stuff arcade bar lounge area   Overall pretty chill environment although greatest spot definitely check because places Vegas where almost anyone done pool gone there  <EOR>
