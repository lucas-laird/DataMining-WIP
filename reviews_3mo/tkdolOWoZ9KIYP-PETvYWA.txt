Jersey Mike's Subs those few sandwich places don't mind going every often  main reasons why only 3 locations Vegas area  being fourth just opened only percentages having JM sandwich even higher   This day regular size Big Kahuna wheat bread  Philly Cheesesteak Onions Mushrooms Peppers Jalapenos  tasted Philly should taste like  only thing kind bothered wanted extra onions but when sandwich hardly any all  Since time constraints lunch long line just let go  Hopefully next time right   Their cold sandwiches also very good  If sure recommend #9 Club Supreme  Roast Beef Turkey Swiss Bacon Mayo topped off Mike's Way  Mike's Way ask? Well all cold subs if want all fixins' say cold sandwich want say want Mike's Way which Onions Lettuce Tomatoes Spices The Juice red wine vinegar olive oil blend    Their location many eating establishments all clustered together front South Premium Outlet Shopping Mall right next Las Vegas Blvd east side   Service efficient assembly line style sandwich making  notice person constantly making sure all tables nice clean   The only negatives say parking limited especially during lunch dinner rushes  said free WiFi but set yet  think would ready when first opened    Overall definitely eat many rotations area  <EOR> Pretty good sub  Regular size decent size sandwhich  Good enough lunch    I ordered Club Supreme  Turkey roast beef bacon  bacon crispy  plus  Ordered Mikes Way without tomato onion  lettuce mayo oil vinegar seasoning salt  added pickle banana peppers    They put lot oil vinegar beware if aren't biggest fan  slice meat cheese when order  nice    Overall good sandwhich  probably come back  <EOR> Where's meat? Just $12 sandwich maybe 25 cents worth meat it  Total ripoff never eat again  <EOR> Make sure listen your sub  wife never problem ones Dallas area  But screwed both orders little not horribly bad but apparent didn't listen very well wanted subs  staff very nice though  <EOR> This first time Jersey Mike's thought good   philly cheese steak made perfect   atmosphere bread reminded Jimmy Johns already love place   looking forward back try different sandwich accurately compare other sub restaurants   workers helpful very nice   highly recommend trying Jersey Mike's!! <EOR>
