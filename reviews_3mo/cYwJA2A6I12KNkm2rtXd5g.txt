Presented individual serving glasses dipping sauce full flavor extra kick because chef leaves seeds surprise   very impressed presentation preparation   I farm burger bacon fried egg decided share Tuscan fries  burger literally bursts mouth  egg exploded over rest burger first bite making fantastically flavored burger  burger's preparation very unique perfectly charred outside perfect amount pink middle    Overall food wise place hit price $30 per person perfectly line other gourmet burger places town    Luckily food best part experience  staff really steals show  only all young trendy beautiful but very knowledgable product  glasses never empty  never ask anything always felt taken care of   The management just gets   manager came over check few times despite them being busy   She took time explain state art grill works asked things better   When mentioned eaten some other similar places town she wanted know compared  trust wasn't pandering she spent great deal time seemed genuinely interested opinions     The manager staff made want come back established new place bring town guests delicious burger experience    Highly Recommended!!! <EOR> I assumed since Gordan Ramsays name would delish    For just OK $15 burger  ordered hells kitchen burger which asked medium burger damn near still alive traded boyfriend cause hate complain  Besides burger still being alive lacked flavor really bland   told onion rings amazing ordered them  werent  onion rings tasted saturated salt  Also really think need water filter cause glass water tasted came toilet  Never drank toilet water but im sure its nasty   But brighter note milkshakes delish  That deserves star alone  Now service  high end burger joint expected little better  mean wasnt terrible only complaint sat bar noticed server almost 15 minutes  just wanted soda while wated order taken  but ever   I did see some orders going looked yummy  wont going back burgers but want try dogs jalepeno poppers looked good sitting counter LOL until next time  Peace BurGR  <EOR> It long wait  waiter friendly seems very knowledgeable wines but we're much drinker The burger $15 00 each  size average  didn't come fries seriously $15 couldn't believe   Comparing chilis burger don't think there's $7 difference taste    My kids very impressed they probably want because price because they're fans Gordon Ramsey searched hard before able find place inside casino ordered fries recommended parmesan truffles? came nice cone shaped container did taste good  freshly grated parmesan cheese sprinkled top there's separate garlic aioli dip which probably just garlic butter some spices  cost $11 per order  fries many small pieces came ends potato  impressed that  If you're going charge $11 potatoes pls  sure good parts you're serving    Long wait overpriced burgers fries lot looks leftover pcs  3 stars  <EOR> We came around 1pm weekend  40 minute wait  took down name numbers text when table ready  absolutely love system think more places should implement such system  allowed wander around mall kill time while waited   When seated noticed creative menu designs Gordon Ramsay's giant face them  also thought fact used ipads each table cocktail menu pretty cool  vibrant pictures ipad screen definitely added appeal   We ordered roasted jalapeno poppers truffle fries start  roasted jalapeno poppers fun game Russian roulette  purposely left seeds six poppers lucky customer receive nice surprise  truffle fries served side truffle aioli house ketchup   For entree ordered farm burger  came duck breast bacon fried egg sharp cheddar  burger pretty good filled nicely  But better ones less  Overall enjoyed myself immensely huge fan burgers but value price point keep coming back  <EOR> I'm beginning wonder whether Gordon Ramsay just fictitious overly confident chef  Having tried several restaurants now really just impressed anything he's put out  concepts just over top trying way hard   I guess time Asian influence e g  honey pig bao buns translation bun buns? soba noodle chicken salad etc  Except    servers all wearing shiny pewter charcoal grey spandex type dress bowling shoes?   The burgers mounds high piled condiments requiring knife fork  hotdogs visually appealing  tried Pork Belly Dawg wasn't bad but pork belly sauce added top hotdog made everything super salty  used gourmet sesame bun though instead usual cheap ass stuff  made big difference texture no dry loose crumbs all over place   However truffle parmesan fries seriously delicious! Another salt heavy item but fries crispy cheese pungent drool inducing truffle oil just made want keep eating 'em!   I most impressed dessert and think almost passed because unimpressed hotdog   Just try salivate over sticky toffee pudding salted peanut caramel ice cream PUSH POPS!

accounts  <EOR> I craving burger decided stop into GR Burgr    I really felt details missed when stopped last night  everyone else wait although did see few empty tables curious why weren't just seating people there    First all didn't really menu didn't describe any meat anything  just pretty basic listed ingredients  didn't know type beef used still don't know point    Ordered Euro burger medium rare but well done  tired hungry them remake it  flavors burger just OK  came goat cheese arugula truffle aioli roasted tomato  dont think flavors distinct burger just seemed mediocre  burger itself wasn't thick    I really liked truffle fries though  liked truffle aioli  But won't back just fries    The ambiance supposed sport bar but just seemed restaurant bunch TVs  did feel it'd comfortable going watch game t here    The employees knowledgeable food did care describe any us    I won't back when craving burger  I'd rather back burger bar bachi <EOR> I walking down Vegas Strip saw fliers Gordon Ramsay's  BRGR   right entrance Planet Hollywood casino curiosity struck because seen insatiable passion efficient customer service rich flavorful food    seat bar avoid long wait table  Initially took 10 15 minutes someone take order which saying myself 5 more minutes walking out  Luckily waitress came over apologized delay took ordered    I decided try Hell's Kitchen Burger Medium Rare side Truffle Fries    staff very nice made sure water ice tea never empty  time burger however long side well  fries very well seasoned full flavor  burger solid good quality burger     but no $15 burger  still yet top incredible burger place just outside DC made incredible burgers half cost After indulgent weekend Vegas could find anymore room try desserts but did look delicious  huge sweet tooth concept pudding topped milk shakes sounded looked incredible       Next time am town may stop milkshake but probably full meal   <EOR> Literally best burger life  Farm Burger  Amazing  also truffle parm fries stupid good too  highly recommend place  Compared most Vegas restaurants reasonably priced service great food amazing  back <EOR> The ambiance staff 5 stars unfortunately charred flavor medium cooked burger big letdown such high priced burger <EOR> This place let down    Service iffy not all expect Hell's Kitchen guy The hostess complete b word I somewhat understand since she deal annoying people all day but HIRED FOR we ordered American Farm truffle fries  really enjoyed American truffle fries much  basically crap French fries ton Parmesan cheese it  ketchup also beyond disgusting  And apparently speak really loud because waitress didn't hear wife say farm burger wait until half way done mine before she finally burger    Terrible experience unfortunately cost $80  Never going back again <EOR> After going Gordon Ramsey's Pub Grill night before 100x better  right 11 wouldn't wait table  place clearly popular 10 parties waiting 11 already if wait long time should no bearing rate restaurant  lots tables lots staff when left around 12 30 place teeming    Our server very knowledgeable she explained menu gave recommendations  service great she kept checking us   The burgers delicious no complaints  sweet potato fries could barely finish many  place priced very reasonably considering Vegas restaurant  $13 15 burger can't really complain   Great place we're sad didn't try shakes  <EOR> Great burger place  Friendly staff fun atmosphere  However prices little expensive but expected Gordon Ramsey   The staff really way informative    I loved food  tried several menu items all really good  really liked wings both flavors super easy eat  The burger jalapeño avocado delicious  little spicy but avocado really complements jalapeño  Best onion rings ever had  The curry ketchup gave fries unique taste  The sticky toffee pudding push pop dessert seriously sinful fun eat   I really tablet drink menu super easy use  drinks great  <EOR> Holy
