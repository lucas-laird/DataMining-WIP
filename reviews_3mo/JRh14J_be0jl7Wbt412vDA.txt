 sure why some other horrendous reviews   Yes review long but trying help others   Here's see it Service 2 1 2 stars  While hope Oscar's management takes whole review heart area need take most seriously   waiter nice enough but best ever had   Both hostesses those front desk check reservations those seat guests bussing staff well lackluster  hard read way   Quite honestly two best staff members met during evening general manager circulating room food runner always came smile   those complaints other reviewers say waiter never seen between order bill  apparently didn't dine same restaurant because friendly all staff present   agree however all staff could use afternoon seminar smiling saying Yes  Food 3 1 2 stars   food itself more 4 stars I am clueless poor reviewers eating  most everything wonderful but menu selection gets them knocked down 1 2 if full star book   never steakhouse doesn't least pasta dish menu because steak fan hubby fanatic pasta always order   However Oscar's does single one   When inquired waiter if pasta request could accomodated I know share kitchen sister restaurant Italian Simpatico shoudn't impossible  he stated could see Simpatico menu but if wanted order off would re seated room    ridiculous!  husband wants Oscar's menu both want appetizers desserts your menu all asking pasta entree kitchen   already even viewed Simpatico menu going order most expensive dishes! Pricier ended ordering off Oscar's real menu oh well your loss bigger check Mr  Waiter  Anyway pieced together dinner myself   started lobster bisque  5 stars!  atypical delicious!  large pieces lobster which never served before when order dish other restaurants   Then crab cake appetizer entree side sweet potato fries   4 1 2 stars crab cakes  very little filler lots lump crab meat   3 1 2 stars fries  delicious sprinkle them generously cinnamon sugar mixture   husband started caesar salad then cedar planked salmon baked potato   words all three items solid 4's   both agreed  the free onion bread  5 stars all way!!!!  disappointment dessert   ordered triple chocolate mousse which food runner called triple chocolate cake he delivered house doesn't even know is arrived still partly frozen   Sorry Oscar's but please jump off thawed pre made desserts bandwagon your own   Even if specialized just two could recommend those customers rest pre made   Decor Ambience 4 1 2 stars   Near perfect  Old School Vegas husband calls both hoping for   many places Las Vegas nowadays some hip interior designer's idea new fancy  place time don't wrong but really enjoy occasionally going place feel stepped back time   Oscar's definitely upscale fashionable decor faux croc upholstered booths metallic chairs couches but still feels classic cliche may said old school  only caveat way music competes  live piano player bar which great area's ambience   However play canned music dining room because restaurant huge when dining hear both   only overly loud atmosphere hearing waiter your dining companion hard but annoying due two different battling tunes   If anything Oscar's would skip piped music   Final note  floating Broads Unnecessary tacky   didn't approach assuming because Valentine's Day but there   just find insulting Oscar's believes women appropriate restaurant should catering couples quite bit money spend nice date night out  <EOR> The recent renovation put fresh modern face nearly iconic domed dining space Plaza  overlooking Fremont Street fabulous downtown Las Vegas  Take escalator 2nd floor see Oscar's Beef Booze Broads steakhouse   Service friendly informed efficient  Food quite wonderful  Being locals delighted see Las Vegas legend menu     Alpine Village's Chicken Noodle Soup  your typical chicken noodle soup but savory satisfying!  Now recall Alpine Village restaurant but never enjoyed chicken noodle soup am sure Oscars' version compares  hope Yelper first hand knowledge share soupinion    We window table close center dome fun entertaining view people parade Fremont street below    Our entrées Halibut Special Bone In Prime Rib fabulous! Halibut perfectly cooked prime rib ginormous medium well still tender  Oscar's horsey sauce top notch well perfectly balanced taste  ordered creamed spinach mac cheese sides  Both good albeit slightly under seasoned but adding little salt pepper easy fix   Splurging dessert chose Creme Brulee he Tiramisu both made in house   actually thought full dinner but somehow magical creme brulee vanished mysteriously into mouth within seconds  crazy good!  tiramisu yummy but CB still mouth water   Not crazy broads aspect     Nice enough ladies but whole bit felt kind being visited annoying mariachi band tits  am sure would want wander room full strangers wearing evening dress puppy begging attention making small talk then expecting strangers pay privilege  Awkwaaaard!   Overall fun enjoyable dining experience bar appeared hoppin' well  also thought cool smoking lounge outside restaurant cocktail lounge nice touch appreciated thoroughly enjoyed  <EOR> This quite experience   food wonderful best skirt steak ever service wonderful?  Saturday night extremely busy  even reservations wait  view cannot form any seat restaurant   pricing fair portions grand   first time dined Oscars both Oscar Carolyn Goodman but last night   local Las Vegas really old Vegas feel Plaza great restaurant enjoy  <EOR> I really skeptical place  friend booked restaurant given namesake throwback old school vegas thought would good idea  read yelp reviews ready some bad service some bad food  friend called ahead reassurances bad reviews just opening problems   I must say happy here   ambience nice  Upscale old school feel place  modern  Being downtown vegas clientele seemed more older midwest southern crowd     Was best steak had? No   Was good because really low expectations? Probably Was enhanced fact we'd drinking couple hours prior? Likely  The bread awesome! can't tell much stuff ate  menu bit limited  crabcakes which excellent not alot breading    Also tried lobster bisque which pretty good alot places salty but just right Had new york strip which cooked just right nice char outside  Another member party prime rib which say excellent!  Would come back but many other great places eat vegas probably won't  But would still recommend give place try <EOR> Service outstanding! hostesses bussers servers bartender  Food great filets cooked perfectly rare order shared mushrooms mac cheese  top all off dinner ran into man himself dinner bar  He gracious host take picture him  Job well done Oscar  <EOR> The ambiance great but service food need help   This second visit Oscar's both cases service extremely slow servers nice but think need more 2 bar area busy night more slow night   The charcuterie plate great when ordered 2 ample 4 people   down hill   three meatball appetizer came cold middle Ahi Tuna appetizer came wasabi ginger but absolutely no soy ponzu sauce dipping   ask why put wasabi paste plate if you're going give sauces dipping?  server drink orders wrong thought odd would want bread actually come charcuterie plate     My martini glass leftover soap residue which tainted very simple Kettle straight twist As local know return enjoy some new spots popping downtown only hope Oscar's strive become better place eat vs  just drink  <EOR> Steak shtick  COURSE check place out!!!  I HUGE fan old steakhouse used location unpretentious very reasonably priced steakhouse fare  Then replaced poseur ass tapas joint which thankfully didn't last   and now back being steakhouse although bit more expensive old steakhouse   I'm guessing new higher prices subsidize cost having Broads payroll  sexy women fake Marilyn Monroe costumes sashay around room table table telling all Vegas  main reason  wanted see Broads all case ever need new job!  I pretty much expected strip club aggressive Broads forcing themselves trying buy them drink buy them dinner pay law school tuition stripper speak coke pills   But wasn't way all!   The night Friday only solitary Broad working room   and she very easygoing  She stopped table few times chat sat down once   but even when friend offered buy dinner she said she busy working room! loss  friend those guys gives $100 bills any bimbo comes down pike she could made some cash off easy! credit though she didn't pander  Nice!   Foodwise average steakhouse fare  no better no worse any other steakhouse  caprese salad very good petit filet $32 good loaded baked potato  Bottle wine cocktails sheesecake dessert  only real bummer bar did stock B B which ordered dinner drinks  waiter said Benedictine which could just mix brandy B B   but man tasted ass! think Benedictine BENADRYL something! Bleccchhh!  The service ok  never did bread basket table never crumbed anything  But hoity toity restaurant  shtick! Oscar Goodman memorabilia all over walls Broads cheeseball gowns feather boas poor waiters cheap looking pinstriped Mobster shirts ties    it's more Disneyland fine dining   Which fine me! friend made day  first hit Mob museum then took leisurely stroll down Fremont St dinner here  very shticky day!  My complaint decor ambiance weirdly lacking  through all trouble hire Broads live piano player lounge basically re create old time swanky Vegas steakhouse   and then furnished looks leftovers 1998 cruise ship! Boring uninspired drab  boo!! some really cool retro vintage swank? Right now lounge area isn't even cool enough bother stopping drink You'd more atmosphere Holiday Inn!  Step Oscar! <EOR> We came walking around downtown Fremont   quickly seated empty   slow taking order which peeved little bit   Anyway ordered strip steak girlfriend ordered some kind mozzerella other   The skirt steak cooked really good   Little bits garlic cooked into steak uber tender   mozzarella ok   Fresh   bread butter table amazing   butter where expression butter came from   smooth warm   goodness  Yum   The reason give place 3 stars instead 5 because even though food splendid price isnt   steak minimum 40 something dollars    heck   Am made money?  If money no issue then eat here  <EOR>
