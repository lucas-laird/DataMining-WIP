To honest boy generally ignore side Aria  lackluster experience Sage ever really being mood tapas wasn't must reason there  weekend however Aria food credits spend wanted try something new  Tetsu apparently very new just opened past Wednesday August 1    Front staff entranced manned or should say womanned 3 young ladies  nice attentive  promptly seated own teppanyaki grill which great because gone other places lump together right away  Other guests also seated own tables   Atmosphere Decor found entrance beautiful especially sun setting backlighting really made colors pop  However once led your seat décor drastically changes simple modern stone background  little disappointed interior didn't mirror beautiful qualities entrance but stare design eat  attire marked casual but would lean more toward dressy casual  least wear nice shirt people! Overall if want know feelings associated Tetsu would describe them neutral  place gives warm fuzzies log cabin but isn't uninviting DMV either  hard explain guess but just associate modern design décor neutrality  Moving on         Food Four grills surround ice mountain where see vegetables seafood   The menu offers appetizers meats vegetables rice  For appetizer jalapeno calamari  f r e s h  chef brought whole squid tiny octopus wooden board chopped right front us  jalapenos seeded cut fresh inches away well  few minutes later dipping calamari into two seafood sauces salsa verde good salsa roja awesome   coming gal looooooooves green salsas over red any day week too  Two side notes sauces brought chilled square black rock containers  cool literally figuratively !
