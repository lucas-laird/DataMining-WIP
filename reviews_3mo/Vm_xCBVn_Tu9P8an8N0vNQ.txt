The restaurant very clean even restrooms   other crawfish restaurants such Boiling Crab Hot 'n Juicy where restrooms disgusting infested germs breath while eating your yummy goodness food!  place cleaaaaaan restrooms actually smell nice   I took star because still prefer Boiling Crab over place   intense lobster colored painted wall difficult eyes adjust   Also spicy ness factor couple levels higher normal   usually take Medium at most but Mild already spicy enough     I really recommend place   hold Hot 'n Juicy competition because Cajun Crawfish's foods BOMB JUICIER!  P S  WETNAPS! <EOR> One star nice staff   Zero food  I REEEEEEEALLY wanted place   mix routine just seafood restaurant all time Hot N Juicy Crawfish HOWEVER would come back even if someone paid to   ordered usual mild crawfish all seasonings bowl half full frozen the legs antennae all broken off crawfish   no seasoning just some water bottom bowl limp onion pieces   asked side spicy garlic butter sauce helped little bit but does change fact crawfish fresh   corn came crawfish no seasoning tasted old freezer burn something   Bleh  also ordered large fried shrimp which granted actually pretty big but sadly battered??  fries just ok   take Texas born raised self over Hot N Juicy where even though real louisiana style still flavorful infinity times better then place   also 10% off discount guess cuz just opened when but yea   Thanks but no thanks  <EOR> I'm all little competition crawfish world but Cajun Crawfish definitely challenge   super hesitant all negative reviews but still kept open mind   It's large restaurant space additional seating back around corner TVs abound  However pretty sterile environment blame high ceilings   We started two pounds Crawfish $9 99 lb House Special seasoning Medium spice level  They warning says spicy level two levels higher normal   Husband did ask ahead time if crawfish big fresh waitress said was   She also pointed tank back could look  I did walk over take peek noticed lobster clams tanks too  also side corn potato order two pounds more crawfish   When order arrived silver bowl noticed difference right away   wasn't way wanted crawfish mistake   Husband asked some lime salt pepper dipping sauce but couldn't help crawfish   Sure large but also dried out   no head juice suck all   When break head off tell there's something wrong immediately   sauce bottom bowl watered down concoction something other   don't think fresh say ones tank just show think!      The staff friendly really anxious refill beverages   But couldn't sad crawfish   left two pounds headed Spring Mountain Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead     We didn't order famous shrimp gets all ravings but did see some someone else's table large indeed   But then again restaurant called Cajun Crawfish Cajun Shrimp    I did ask if any grand opening specials especially since other yelpers mentioned it but told weren't offering them anymore   However did notice ad offering discount beverages just other day    Oh well   Overall Cajun Crawfish doesn't measure good crawfish way it   Sorry   06 07 10 Update!  recent magazine article changing name Cajun Crawfish Crawdaddy Crab House   Hope helps business! <EOR>
