Great happy hours 12am chill spot   comfortable leather couches   Cool bartenders hooking some strong cocktails goose without extra charge!  some fries legit   think fresh cut but f'd could've frozen Ore Ida kind  all know   Right heart Chinatown   bad hot filipina server married   wow she smoking hot!  Great service very attentive   back maybe March Madness  <EOR> I couple times already  Personally think very good good place hang co workers also close where work as part time job !  They security guard check ID before enter bar area then see full bar front 2 3 TVs each side  If want avoid smoke group ppl maybe should turn left couple sofa down turn right if want quiet eat something because provide 1 2 off pizza midnight 1 2 all drinks very very value    I love nachos especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!  Easy parking + open 24 hrs + looking DANNY service very much        = enjoy night! <EOR> I usually love PT's great because close work  last visit kinda different    Stopped work grab 1 2 priced drinks food long day work  Sat bar served right away normal fashion  Then once all ordered drinks looking menu female bartender oh looking happy hour specials? think might well changed 1st happy hour 4 7 new time 3 6  time now 7 25  pissed no told sooner  She claimed started 2 weeks ago she wasn't sure which ones  told need because radio commercials banners still old time  then checked yelp happy houred neither updated   How serve people always come your bar tell them changed? Such bullshit  stayed since already ordered drinks but she continued time spent miserable  She talked cell phone ignored people bar unsure common pt drinks  wasn't even busy ALL   Then when person asked leave she put all drinks receipt  really confused when asked split it    I continue but now only late happy hour never when Bartender there  <EOR> I've many times  When worked down street coming breeze  This place gotten me    friend life   job  lost friend once sat over 7 hours drinking talking music until sun came up  friends strange experience walking morning sun kisses your face  I use place meet old friends new friends  food pretty good won good rather    not talk moments  My co worker the job comes much everyone nick name whenever meet he's celebrity   I also Love big few pool tables   separate seating area certain meet groups So seen   Bottom line  When advertisements say PT's   yeah   me  <EOR>
