I typically Las Vegas anywhere 3 10 times year   Needless say am pretty tired every casino's restaurant   think trended charging gourmet prices so so fare   Plus casino restaurants always jammed packed   Having said taking chances away casinos very pleased thus far   I found La Scala via Opentable last Christmas   The place itself fanciest but decor very nice   very relaxed atmosphere   tables spread packed gills   wait staff helpful keep drinks filled   The food excellent   Pasta    al dente   Portions might considered little small but think most appetites would fine   probably case would taste good if portions Buca de Pepo size   If picky pasta eaters think safe here   Be sure save room dessert if any dessert lovers your party   myself am much into sweets but appreciated pyramid cake split   The wine list fairly extensive   While think sommelier hand waiter knew wines well enough help out   enjoy wine quite bit but am no expert any means   depend staff know wine when ready recommendation   As aside actually carry some decent tea if tea drinker   cannot remember brand but guy appreciates little Taylors Harrogate work say English Breakfast Tea quite acceptable unlike some finer restaurants serve Sir Lipton's bitter tea   So if need place chill some decent food your place   only few minutes away Strip   Also sure directions handy if taking cab since seems many cab drivers know place  <EOR>
