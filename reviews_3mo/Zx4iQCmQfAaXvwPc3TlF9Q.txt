*Smoker friendly advertised sign outside    I guess smoker friendly means non smoker hostile  brazenly ignore non smoking law enacted voters    I invited join gathering here  came away clothes reeking cigarette smoke   sinuses clogged smoke stench  reason stay away crappy bars this   Meanwhile reports fellow attendees food drinks good   martini $5 50   good price?  seldom frequent places wouldn't know if $5 50 good price   The waitress sweet old gal   She friendly she kind cute   Meanwhile very young waitress informed standing bar area allowed   would find seat even if meant sitting strangers table   What?  numerous bars where least half crowd stands  fire regulation?  Sort she said   So this?  Tap House openly defies state law enacted voters but insists inexplicable restriction standing bar   They're neighborhood institution sure they'll fine without me   If enjoy typical smoke filled dive place you  <EOR>
