Why does 5 stars?  Because would return tomorrow try something else   order exact same thing! <EOR> Easy 4 stars! experience confusing would 5! YES believe hype tacos el Gordo don't nothin' Al Pastor!  We entered through back restaurant but no way telling outside  weren't specific instructions where order just bunch taco stations  Each station offered something different  am still sure if order station person front explaining things   What know some best taco meat ever life   I 2 al pastors carne  all exceptional but al pastor took cake  could eat 5 SURE opt grande size taco next visit   The salsa bar 6 salsas carrots onions radishes jalapeños cucumbers limes  Did mention besides all awesome selections extremely clean?!!  I'm hoping confusing part fade figure run things because can't wait return! <EOR> Yummy times infinity!! Love tacos de lengua super soft overly salty  Jamaica tasty fresh Sunday when offering buy two taco free I think only night   excited try other stuff but far hands down tacos de lengua tacos de al pastor salsa bar  <EOR> By nature usually compare new things try favorites    I think comparison Taco Taco definitely Gordo's!   Upon seeing lay does scream copycat but looks deceiving because think offerings better Gordo's only point ill give Gordo's adobada  Taco Taco wins everything else   I love Gordo's but its always busy! know dumb reason knock them but am happy discovered Taco Taco friends   I'd also say chipotle mixed Gordo's  There's large seating area  always clean  salsa bar legit! really awesome thing your customers especially when you're dining in  label each sauce would good   My first visit during lunch break   I only person ordering took awhile food me  Considering large staff just didn't see possible    I can't knock them making food fresh but Gordo's quick   Whenever try new place always crazy ordering new things real taste food    This final conclusion food   I al pastor gran tacos which yummy  think flavor salty but still good  supreme taco sorts  larger regular tacos packed meat  also carne asada tacos which good  fries come full half sizes also carry nachos both sizes  any meat either  bowl today also really good  lot choices tacos    One disappointment when language taco no sauce it  Since salsa bar many salsas shouldn't problem but maybe suggestion which sauce pairs best each meat?   Overall hit me   My only gripe place don't ordering system  staff nice don't send different area they'll just tell order correct person  If found good ordering system way translate customers would easier them take orders easier them serve customers they'd more money return    They shrimp weekends but run three times been  can't wait try them though  <EOR> I love offer vegetarian options none meat eaters  tried soy rizo taco delicious! <EOR> A decent option east side town  twice week  chicken carnitas pretty good but show stopper Al Pastor  beautiful marinated meat gets carved order topped all good street Taco ingredients  Friendly helpful staff  music loud flows through place  Sweet new lunch spot! <EOR> Add your taco list immediately! If don't taco list start immediately put Taco Taco twice  love most double name double delicious eatery based limited knowledge appears authentic but easy enough gal myself navigate without feeling completely clueless  Big signs help    There different stations different meats  Just saunter let cook know many you'd your preferred meat  They'll whip them fresh plate them hot push them over counter you  large selection meats including lengua  even vegetarian chorizo aka soyrizo  tortillas made fresh house each meat comes different selection toppings salsa  If want avoid carbs bowls well if want bigger bite burritos available  variety incredible    I am sucker pastor pineapple soon saw beauty spinning hunk pineapple top said Give two! Unfortunately thought salty thereby violated sacred taco shop rule first visit just order each decide which really like  carnitas should doubled on! should known when saw simmering pot juicy pork bits    Every taco super generous meat  definitely $2 00 pile goodness  service super friendly  place big clean    I may may special trip over east side just tacos but if am hood definitely go to! <EOR> Thanks hook Yelp!  place rocks   three small tacos chips salsa drink under $10   carnitas tender carne asada great pastor intensely seasoned the way it  Second time azteca special taco nopales pastor burrito   Again chips guac drink under $10   Buying chips dollar great bargain huge salsa bar   unlimited fountain drink refills Coke Zero  high five!!  seating area huge clean music blaring  which isn't awesome intimate discussions but entertaining nonetheless   order system definitely confusing never know ask  all talk while you're looking menu feel order anybody but guess you're supposed order items station they're assigned?  *Shrug* <EOR> These far best tacos Las Vegas! Even better TEG previous reference believe inspiration Taco Taco methinks student surpassed master  Great Bandini trifecta Asada Carnitas Pastor all meats tremendous flavor servings generous  Pastor may best ever even better TEG Tijuana   Please NOW Taco Taco work doing wildly important deserve support  <EOR> If love Chipotle love almost authentic Hispanic food then place you   So wanted give place two because read reviews excited try place  drive past daily commute work inevitable would try place   What anyone failed Mexican version chipotle  am telling you  Yes salsa bar yes more meat options    I tried al pastor bowl decent  slightly disappointed because mozzarella cheese instead authentic Mexican cheese    We also tried chicken burrito good solid eats  But nothing rave about   If mood Mexican then definitely try place out  just might love it  just expected something else   I probably would better off if stuck tacos  would back just try but sure anything else  <EOR> Awesome tacos! Even better Gordos! extras free where normally most taquerias charge extra beans grilled chiles green onions  also awesome fresh jugos juices beverages salsas elotes corn think tortillas tacos asada home made  twice already coming back more  There 3 separate lines different meats sure your tray ready tips hand hook up! 4th final line check line pay all grub!  I would given them 5 stars if weren't favorite taqueria back home La Pasadita Chicago IL  <EOR> Hands down best deal Mexican food Las Vegas  Maybe even best tasting too  freshness ingredients ridiculous  salsa bar HUGE always well stocked  extremely generous meats fish  ordered delicious shrimp burrito $6 50 enormous helping fresh shrimp big box warm chips $1   There no better place quick tasty Mexican town  <EOR> We arrived 3 minutes until closing treated amazingly    did close door insisted come order waited until done    Customer service dead place    addition food amazingly good    Tacos al carbon delicious   corn spicy but good    returning  <EOR> Good stuff! tried lunch day then back dinner  big clean  Order counter pay cashier seat yourself  Employees friendly  Great fish tacos great carne asada tacos yummy elote  going back! <EOR> I'm always lookout try bookmarked spots lunch decided give place try when having major elote craving    I arrived around 12 30 place pretty busy but packed  decided some Mexican corn two tacos al pastor  Everything looked really fresh handmade all smelled good  While paying chatted cashier asked heard them  told Yelp she glad word spreading them well  All employees really nice friendly  Before left goodies stop famous salsa bar some delicious toppings  really keep everything very clean which happy many salsa options which nice  really clean dining area everything super cheap   I enjoyed tacos right away amazing! Some best ever had  juicy amazing flavor  absolutely love first bite just better better ate  finished two tacos sad over  corn  really great  Very typical Mexican corn  liked kept little more crunchy side which prefer    Everything fabulous am already planning return really soon! <EOR> Confession Time  Authentic Mexican food places intimidate me  am very interested trying new things but rarely because language barrier  staff Taco Taco nicest most helpful staff ever 'over counter' restaurant  first time took time explain entire menu let sample all different meats  great experience  settled soyrizo   The food excellent  confused white guy think Taco Taco chipotle style establishment real Mexican tastes  point stop try something new whenever am east side  <EOR>
