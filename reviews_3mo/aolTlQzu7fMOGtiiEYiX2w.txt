Essence Thai now defunct!  restaurant now new owners renamed   told new owner old cook still there   Apparently lot old dishes still available new dishes added   I ordered Thai tea yellow curry chicken new appetizer called 4 Queens      I am happy say Thai tea much improved!  lot sweeter even watermelon taste   also lot lighter cream     The appetizer ordered wasn't great but edible   Basically little fried patty shrimp pork chicken ground corn   deep fried nice tasting batter   shrimp chicken pork mixture wasn't best but did come nice sweet homemade sauce   actually quite good curry had   The yellow curry plentiful just old Essence Thai served large bowl   pretty basic standard yellow curry potatoes chopped carrots   curry soupy but soupy favorite styles curry   wasn't sweet all although curry taste little bit bland side   Still good though better places dump bunch sugar into coconut based curries     Unfortunately never yellow curry Essence Thai can't compare old place   Next time try Khao Soi roast duck curry both which really good old Essence Thai   return again see if new owners improved overall quality old Essence Thai  <EOR>
