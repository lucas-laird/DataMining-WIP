To surprise and disappointment Springs Cafe Springs Preserve no longer under Wolfgang Puck but instead now ran Culinary Academy Las Vegas  They did stay within same food guidlines previous owner which continue offer sustainable dining selection  We during Halloween festivities special Halloween menu which overpriced really good selection items  I thought odd boo burger didn't come any veggies no lettuce no tomato nothing  Hello isn't place supposed promote healthy eating? No veggies? Why? So basically bun burger which seemed came your grocers freezer slice cheese  reminded food while eating school cafeteria  $9 00 worthy all!!! The kid's meals also those darn frozen dino nuggets pizza sticks find Walmart  Is food fresh what? Too bad food view setting restrauant beautiful  I know employees students but whomever instructing them needs step teaching quickly won't anyone serve  <EOR> I little worried heading today reading other review Yelp but greatly surprised!  My business colleague suggested meeting Springs Cafe business lunch  space beautiful clean free wi fi! food fresh quality healthy  bento box special pork belly forbidden rice  pork belly perfectly cooked tender rice full flavor   colleague fish tacos which looked tasty client panini which she said full flavor   The staff very attentive helpful everything very well priced  definitely bringing clients back future! <EOR> Lots parking but may crowded some days   No need pay park entrance fee eat cafe   atmosphere warm inviting   Wonderful view city park   Inside outside dining   food pretty good   Employees friendly   manager dropped check things say hello   Prices little high but bad   Daily specials served bento box   menu designed sustainability mind   Busy lunch crowd   favorite part experience atmosphere  <EOR> Prices high side quality food   essentially spaghetti meatballs good   meatballs super dense   sauce salty greasy   think pasta whole wheat spaghetti which didn't mind but could see some people liking texture compared regular spaghetti   husband roast beef sandwich french fries which seemed ok   server brought food without bringing any utensils then off several minutes served another table while sitting around waiting food front us   Kind awkward   plus open feel place plenty seating especially outdoors balcony seating great view  <EOR> Amazing view affordable prices delicious food great staff  Perfect experience going back every week lunch  <EOR>
