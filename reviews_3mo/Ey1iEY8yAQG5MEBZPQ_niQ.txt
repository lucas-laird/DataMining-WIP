Part Boyd line hotels  Fremont good gambling worrying idiot tourists split 10s  6s    against face card  But digress    haven't done well while but just means using all bad luck you'll more good luck when go! <EOR> The Fremont great seafood buffet under $20 person  seating area gaudy hell emerald green everything accented gold Vegas  Service great super busy but never something drink plates cleared before came back your next round    The seafood buffet snow crab king crab oysters shrimp scampi cocktail deep fried cooked shell on mussels clams smoked salmon sushi  honest sushi isn't great but really going buffet sushi? There's also really great prime rib but when first  bring meat because medium rare part best  BEST buffet town but cheap good would say gets job done   Validation gets free valet parking first 3 hours  <EOR>
