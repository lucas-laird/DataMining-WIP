Went group 20 last night  Large bar area good sized dinning room decent sized room off dinning room  large flat screen TVs encompase each room   probably good place catch game  servers still getting used place but very nice gracious    service bit slow food also came slow horribly slow but noticeable  hope just because still getting through opening jitters    someone ordered 4 sets chips salsa $4 95 came very hard chips tomatillo salsa chopped tomatoes little onion cilantro added  tomatillo good but tomato side boring   i full size Cajun Nachos Half $10 95 Full $15 95 Blue corn chips Cajun blackened Louisiana mudbugs blackened chicken shrimp Andouille sausage pepper jack cheese tomatoes scallions red onions garnished fried okra sauce remoulade   pretty good entree but would great appetizer two share   couldn't finish all but someone else group powered through it!  very tasty mix nachos   all others group commented food good Jambalaya nachos club sandwich   we probably back look forward faster service quicker food  <EOR> I'm fence place still  could down 2 stars could 4 stars  currently exercising some forgiveness since just opened few kinks pretty much inevitable   When walked greeted 4 hostesses  Yep 4  assuming part some kind training  technically really only greeted 1 them  others just sorta looked on  asked if wanted sit bar dining area bar area includes high tops   replied bar area fine  hostess then back other 3 hostesses conferred bit then led high top bar area   The bar dining areas aren't really divided all  all big room no physical division  dining area all booths most part  bar area long bar stools then cluster high tops including some high tops part booth   Upon seating hostess explained only part menu available nachos  rest menu available until January 1st   And sat awhile  No even much looked me  Though counted least 12 staff hostesses bartenders servers milling around only 4 other customers entire restaurant  But ok waiting someone maybe waiting until person arrived  Nonetheless seemed strange no took drink order brought water etc   After person waiting arrived continued wait another 10 minutes  point woman assume manager came over asked if we'd helped yet  She then promised server would right over she took drink order stating drinks her   She incredibly sweet friendly  Things looking up   The bartender being all befuddled drinks could possibly manager brought drinks one  pleasantly surprised find draft beer selection rather decent  standards Bud Coors etc  slightly better Blue Moon etc  then also way better Snow Cap 2 Below Dogfish Head etc     After few more minutes server arrived  She apologized wait asked if ready order  nacho list quite extensive inventive and also build your own   all nachos available half full order  settled two half orders Buffalo Hot Sloppy Daddy  point informed didn't chips Buffalo Hot supposed come with  Ok then we'll just regular tortilla chips   Our server very nice good timing checking etc  However definitely seemed she very new new only new restaurant but new serving  She super sweet but seemed little flustered  fact think same could said majority staff here  staff mean young thin females strong preference blondes  Possibly trying little hard Hooters feel   It seemed take while food arrive especially considering nachos  But didn't take long all ok  nachos pretty good  Good enough warrant coming again  chicken Buffalo Hot just right size perfectly spicy which book very hot side   pulled pork Sloppy Daddy great flavor  best part didn't skimp cheese  Unlike other plates nachos left halfway through eating plate chips no toppings  cheese permeated every inch chips  weren't best nachos ever had  fact even close  But different yummy    The prices though did seem little high get  full orders nachos elsewhere less price half orders here   The manager came over two additional times asking ordered and making some small talk then again food arrived asking everything was   Major props   The decor nice everything very pristine  Several large flat screens bar area tuned different sports channels  Even couple flat screens corners dining section  No gaming  No smoking  Music neither loud soft primarily all Top 40   Overall decent experience decent place  fully intend patronizing again especially see kinks ironed out  ok yeah might already craving Buffalo Hot nachos little bit  <EOR> My family Nacho Daddy 12 20 10  While waitress nice enough she ackward niece wasn't quite ready order  asked waitress regarding beers she seemed limited knowledge beers would expect such sports bar    agree other reviewers food quite cold better nachos home cheez wiz   wouldn't back   understand kitchen isn't fully operational however wasn't made clear when ate night   think if going open restaurant don't open if ready  <EOR> Food ok  Service below par   It seems bit amateurish would suffer some more experienced staff management <EOR> Slow service waitress looked train wreck piercings tattoos head toe   Ok overlook insane look but then greet table hi blank stare then odd silence until ordered drink told waiting someone   service horrible slow restaurant she never around   other staff tables near looked great personable but woman train wreck needs job gas station local tattoo shop   food okay horrible but sort bland mexican but am interested trying some other nachos offered menu   back again everything deserves second chance but if next time anything visit bet another restaurant failure within year  <EOR> My husband Nacho Daddy hoping new Mexican restaurant opening area   very disappointed when arrived told entire menu avail only nachos sandwiches   Why would open restaurant everything available?  When looked menu disappointment because all typical Mexican restaurant   wanting car drive another place ordered nachos   big disappointment   ordered taco meat ours more grease plate meat   barely any chips plate way little food price   only bright spot margaritas which quite tasty   waitress friendly everyone seemed very unsure themselves   shame spend big bucks into location spend big bucks decorate hire folks then bad first impression  owners don't open until ready   Try things week invited guests then open when ready   only chance good first impression  <EOR> The first time around 10pm busy  few other parties restaurant generally quiet  waiter energy friendly attentive  took two orders nachos Buffalo Hot standard kind just safe  took far long order come somewhere around 45 50 minutes  Considering un busy most restaurants area close kitchens 10pm Nacho Daddy exception closing kitchen 11pm pleased  However when food arrived hungry delicious enough worth wait  standard nachos little boring naturally Buffalo Hot unlike anything we'd before just awesome! All all decided would return   This evening decided reward ourselves long day another plate those Buffalo Hot Nachos some regular 6 pc  Buffalo Wings Nacho Daddy  walk there's no apparent hostess but everyone seems chatting bar sitting around  moment two notice awkwardly waiting noticed someone comes over seat offering anywhere you'd fine! smile  Dining area empty except couple  sit waitress comes perky nervous well  She takes drinks complete order returns timely enough throughout evening check she did great part  great refilling drinks clearing plates finished appetizer basket  Order nachos came really late again time cold even although waitress told watch because plate hot? hahaha which may may true didn't care enough check  nachos all soft where cheesed cheese starting solid again   ended finishing them because things aren't really appetizing when they're melted then solidify again  lot more disappointed evening but really bent over all worth mentioning  only heartbreaking part Not So Hot Nachos  Which really Buffalo Hot but don't think worth going back again even if craving them   Hopefully things figured isn't Chef Ramsay intervention wills customers back year now  They're bad but slow business wise both times somehow food coming slow  mean even if really good when they're hot they're still nachos does take long put them together? Also feel chips bought made house  If wrong them being made house then sorry didn't look all nice thick bubbly or taste regular fresh made chips familiar with  Maybe they're frozen then dunked fry idk  even really expecting them but just suggesting would really cool fresh made order homestyle tortilla chips especially when place called Nacho Daddy  feel would totally worth 10 15 bucks 40 minute wait  Assuming they're warm time  <EOR> Awww sorry see all horrible reviews here! husband friend check the place just opened old El Jefe's know Nacho Daddy   The setup inside pretty standard dining room side big bar other atmosphere typical fiesta style  No problem there  The menu kinda random because centered all crazy nachos regular sloppy joe buffalo veggie cuban etc but then other side threw bunch other Mexican dishes some sandwiches hamburgers  didn't try anything back side menu but figured better stick namesake nachos  ordered traditional large size split thought really good  Nothing outstanding mean hey we're only talking nachos but used some really quality ingredients everything nice flavor  $13 full platter 2 almost finished it little more pricey other places but think they're also little better  Bonus Nacho Daddy decent beer selection big 22 oz think domestics only $4 $3 during happy hour! Service pretty average nothing write home about  Overall back Nacho Daddy if area feeling nachos NOT Mexican!    Seemed they're earlier service issues cleaned hopefully everyone back support new local joint! <EOR> im gonna lie main reason checked place name! expected authentic mexican joint it used mexican restaurant   decor still same before  huge bar area main dining area roomy well    their menu comprised mostly nachos surprise! your typical bar fare  simple pastas couple burritos salads etc  since specialize nachos plethera every kind nacho combination think of  some novelty items menu nachos meal worms circkets scorpions more adventurous eater hawaiian nachos spam pineapple kimchee   i steak fajita nachos  typical steak fajita served top crisped flour tortillas usual fixins  pretty average  amount meat al ittle disappointing  bf fish tacos  battered white fish corn tortillas   nothing exciting food really  pretty average  just good place hang watch game eat appetizers guess  catchy name though <EOR> The Good server enthusiastic when could hold did best genuine recommendations  reasonably priced 1st marg just perfectly made there's catch read below    The Bad other's pointed service very inefficient  far #1 reason wont going back here  waited waited waited some more  Food memorable  defense menu suggests genuine effort present unique fresh dining experience  Unfortunately execution off  El traditional nachos nothing special  Thin chips average grade cheese traditional spice levels  can't call traditional when recipe tamed down cater average 8 year old  fish tacos looked delicious but bite mouth overwhelmed taste onions and possibly radish?   Note chef When comes Fish less more  Add much run risk over powering delicate taste fish  2nd Margarita said earlier 1st marg just perfect set high expectations night  Unfortunately all downhill there  super sweet 2nd marg undoubtedly handiwork Baja Bob's not so fresh extra sweet premix  Salsa dips Meh  better salsa jar Smiths Rojo's fresh cut salsa rocks! And ugly true  He probably isn't yo daddy <EOR> In job work long hours sometimes okay most time don't time cook  being said eat out  whole lot  Last night ENTIRE group work all 15 decided try Nacho Daddy  only did fit made special accomodation thier bar area which smart considering group NO filters mouths    We began lots cocktails beers  beers ice cold pitchers maragaritas phenomenal  Mike serever total doll made several suggestions didn't say no  guacamole flight salsa flight perfect way help wash down margaritas  ordered Buffalo Chicken Nachos       Shrimp Diablo Nachos continue snacking while all chatting relaxing    What perfect atmosphere music      televisions attentive staff  managers came say hi chat bit chef all pretty cool     We stayed long enough ahead order some meals well  enchilda trio plate complaint other getting stuffed    I say        why bother going Yelp give 2's 3's 4's?? don't  All BS middle road     the chips thin garbage       but enjoyed company CARES?????? All wanna food critics stick relevant       PLEASE   Bottom line NACHO DADDY Food great fair prices Drinks awesome GREAT prices wells decent liquors Atmosphere very easy going CLEAN which hugely important Service Fantastic   I think found new Sunday night hang          perhaps Monday well  <EOR> After going two occasions am going give them benefit doubt round three stars  Being 1 2 menu dedicated nachos both visits  Personally buffalo nachos kind let down chicken soggy doused some low grade hot sauce while Cajun nachos pretty awesome  Service solid both time but could bit slow times    One thing love place though favorite beer tap     Negro Modelo  Solid! <EOR> I live almost across street meaning stop while  Brought nacho obsessed bff w gave try   brought really yummy corn muffins  Warm soft slightly sweet w whole kernels corn mixed into batter  Great start   They ton really unique nacho options but honestly none really sounded great  Settled w shrimp some spicy cream sauce  also shared coconut chicken tenders  Both pretty mediocre  Chips looked homemade but kind hard didn't notice any kind cream sauce top very dry  nachos pretty much just chips w fair amount shrimp sauteed assuming mentioned cream sauce some kind white cheese melted hardened onto chips   Coconut chicken might've good if seasoned chicken before coating it  really no taste Thai citrus sauce bland well   The meal did least end positive note nacho sundae awesome! Cinnamon sugar tortilla chips w coconut coated fried ice cream w strawberry chocolate syrup  Yum! Service also quick friendly  bad entrees aren't better  <EOR>
