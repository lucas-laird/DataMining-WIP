Dessert * Cannoli 4 5 stars I am very picky cannoli favorite desserts Bonanno's did disappoint   enjoyed shell remained crisp every bite!  To drink tried 1 specialty cocktails   think called Morning Spritzer something similar   cocktail enticed reading ingredients Aperol Prosecco   Having spent 2 weeks Italy last Fall became addicted infamous Aperol Spritz craved since   Bonanno's first place seen serve it   Another variation served Campari but prefer Aperol less bitter flavor   cocktail bit pricey size but ended having 2 because damn good!  The service excellent! 5+ stars hostess server chef   extremely pleased dining experience start end  <EOR> Relatively unknown Italian restaurant opened just month ago  Bonnanos right strip around corner Planet Hollywood shoppes next CVS   Good food good price no waiting extremely friendly helpful staff  sure when featured menu available but great prices decent pasta btwn $6 8   <EOR> Great place ask Paolo!
