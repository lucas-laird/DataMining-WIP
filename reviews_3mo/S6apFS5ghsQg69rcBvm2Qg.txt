The restaurants Red Rocks food court offer vegetarian options but Capriotti's only place offers four mock meats turkey steak salami burger   did doubletake menu wall because although vegetarian section thought mistake  Looking closely saw Vegetarian Meats 100% Meatless  Bingo!!  I initially ordered Cheese Steak which really looking forward to but told still frozen ready I 11am   opted Turkey sandwich  Mmmmmm! mock turkey portions generous sub roll lettuce tomato lettuce italian seasonings  reminded days growing New Jersey eating hoagies Wawa  would give them five stars if vegan mayonnaise like excellent Wildwood Garlic Aioli    I hope chance try vegetarian cheese steak btw if you're ever San Francisco check Jay's Cheesesteaks seitan offerings   <EOR>
