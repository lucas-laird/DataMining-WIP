Don't fooled   address isn't McDonald's photo   McDonalds actually located Wal*Mart across street   They used workers really unprofessional but shaped workers recently think   food pretty good can't complain   Being Wal*Mart bring food pretty fast because gets pretty busy certain hours   McDonald's good because they're pretty much 24 hours   Except hour close 1am   ^_^ <EOR> This McDonald's located inside Walmart Arroyo Crossing shopping center   Since local Walmart pass Mickey D's all time   More often Husband convinces he's hungry wants grab snack while we're there   Usually something easy Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich but other times sat down full meal   My most recent find discovery during Halloween   selling Halloween Treat books $1 each!  Inside coupons free apple dippers free small cones free apple juice milk jugs   total 12 coupons $1!  deal!  location cooler others even offered it! I tried purchasing more another location didn't offer it! Overall pretty efficient professional some other McDonald's Vegas  <EOR>
