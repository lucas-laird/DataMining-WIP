It's food stupid  No really location fancy design catchy name any other thing end day food  Yes best area but Las Vegas good neighborhood  walked Saturday place packed    menu full traditional Southern Foods Fried Chicken Catfish Bar b Que other items cook order can imagine some fancy strip downtown restaurant doing that? <EOR> I pork chops potatoes eggs  Delicious  sign spinners advertising place made curious  Glad in   would again  Price right even enough food share  People beg when smell good food! <EOR>
