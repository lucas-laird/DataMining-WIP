Pamplemousse sells itself Vegas's most romantic restaurant its website  many great restaurants town may hard say most romantic but certainly try best unique special evening   The restaurant located just off northern end Strip  staying Stratosphere 10 minute walk  decorated inside restaurant dark colours  service attentive unique some ways see below    They pride themselves having no menu your server recite all dishes obviously aim them making each dish sound really appetizing  Some may find charming but others may find irritating try remember all dishes being recited you  They're very happy repeat dishes if necessary but imagine ordering taking long time some tables!  The other unique selling point basket crudites whole boiled eggs offer start meal  food traditional French  Tasty but maybe modern style even French food moving days  did enjoy meal but some dishes could perhaps lighter touch sauces creme brulee wasn't good version home   Worth look but maybe date 2 3 rather 1st date  <EOR>
