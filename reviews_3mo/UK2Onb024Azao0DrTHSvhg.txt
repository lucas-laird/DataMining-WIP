Fresh very delicious!  Large portions price!!  I'm impressed quality love see places town aren't chains   Check them out     Not lot seating room but mine anyway Worth every star!! <EOR> I really looking forward enjoying place all great reviews  extremely disappointed  those rare occasions forgot cell phone could posted pictures explain why  ordered vegetarian plate hummus baba falafel  hummus form fitted section plate just jello pudding cups plated morning 7 30 pm visit? expect when post sign counter don't specials because don't use have? leftovers  Really wish I'd phone take picture  Baba form fitted but both covered clear oil if even olive no olive taste color low quality even olive  better hummus buying pre packaged grocery stores  Baba did impress sad made once home online recipe guests loved taste enough  continue drive Stephano's when craving some baba  I love falafel extreme when Parsley Mediterranean Grill soon walk ask many orders falafel want day  when called before going see if gluten free told made mix which gluten free garbanzo fava corn oil  But judging shape texture balls bean flavored cake almost cupcake consistency  baked fried? wasn't oil plate under them soaked tahini squirted them  Baked would healthier but just didn't cut me  ate  1 2 came 4  Yes left hungry having eaten less 2 full bites $10 plate  His kebab plate which he ordered chicken charred wasn't even showing speck char second trip grill yes know unhealthy charred but he likes ordered it   Greek salad plate drenched oil flavorless because said oil no color taste  Probably why much paprika spread top guess just presentation but if any taste desired mix in  Maybe rush since closing time but $30 above order garlic feta fries soda if eating off plastic plates utensils food should good   This kind reminds food mall's food court stand alone restaurant Food 1 star service would 3 but couldn't char cleanliness brought them 2 stars   Still trying figure all those 5 star reviews  use yelp all time find great new places but time feel really let down  Maybe meat eaters good but definitely don't recommend vegan  <EOR>
