It's no different any other Burger King except never seem order right drive thru  just don't bother location anymore   The burgers fine just probably burger ordered wrong size wrong flavor soda   you idea  <EOR> As usual Burger King ketchup!! wish could give some negative stars  worst thing least four other burger king's same problem ketchup but guess  bad time when ran outta buns!! run burger joint going run two essential things run burger joint?! Plus bun always two sizes big patty  Just sloppy made burgers  Worst chain ever!!!! <EOR> Normally dont expect much fast food joint but last night serives way above par  Food nice fresh didnt them food over special burger  pleasantly surprised  <EOR>
