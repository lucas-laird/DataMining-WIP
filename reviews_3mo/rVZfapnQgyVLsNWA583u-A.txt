From other ppl's review seems pretty decent food service here       Maybe should've come them   service lack why star       I walked greeted right away     But when walked place order girl behind counter walked blocked walking counter   ok     stopped 5 feet counter asked question     Would possible large soup half egg drop half hot sour soup?   She proceeded faces crazy making request     Then proceeded tell bad idea told would just add extra egg into hot sour soup   she didn't understand sweetness egg drop soup spiciness sour hot sour soup all mixed together  best soup   never issue getting any other Chinese restaurant   But apparently restaurant HUGE ISSUE   Then she proceeded tell going long long wait since large order ahead me   guess family order huge order when u only 1 person working kitchen   since only ordering person     guess order didn't count???  And she made very very clear she did want business  walked out  Why bother spending hard earned money restaurant doesn't want it?
