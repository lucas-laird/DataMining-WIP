Chinese die hard bbq fan  bbq pig ear legit should come try! girlfriend loving it! <EOR> Went place because 4 5 stars   Everything looked really great pictures   venue nice quaint good sized booths flanking walls   side more open other side booths drapes dividers between each booth going most way wall  made feel little more private   also nice quiet   hate when places think some sort club   cafe clearly knows place playing cheesy Asian covers pop songs low background blasting overworked cheap speakers   could actually hear   The food just OK   braised beef combo   soup little peanut dressing salad standard but good   Braised Beef flavorful but really fatty   should expected dish can't fault them that   broccoli super raw though looked felt came right earth just then     They didn't Thai iced coffee only Thai Iced tea  waiter looked confused when asked Thai Iced Coffee but he offered if didn't would free   wasn't Thai Iced coffee but good   If could give 3 5 due coffee waiter would  Venue waiter 4   just can't give place 4 due food   friend smoothie more slushy ice smooth devoid fruit flavor mango NO! <EOR> This nice quiet place catch friends Boba tried passion fruit milk tea honey dew yogurt drink both amazing  Definitely would try more fruit flavors!  Food tried oden which skewers come sour spicy broth  shrimp squid balls squid definitely better choice  also taro skewers which good if wasnt much cumin it  free beef skewers same seasoning taro skewer said before cumin here!  Overall service good prompt  server took time answer questions even recommended honey dew yogurt drink  Its still new place ask people yelp review better service food  <EOR> Really enjoyed meal couple days ago   I skewers taro lotus root chicken claws peppers  chicken just right  not falling apart but tough  Watch those peppers  thought they'd something milder shishito but jalapenos  skewer two peppers two skewers per order  Just pepper enough though finished skewer   I also ordered unagi kabayaki   good but pretty standard  Came small side salad small bowl kimchi   I'm planning back once weather cools down try oden  <EOR> tasty delicious little meals      ordered chicken chicken hearts chicken claws beef lambs garlic mushroom wrapped bacons skewers  very good kinda salty  spicy but little kick spice  grilled squid chewy big   grill fish bbq ribs combines excellent serving dishes decent  peanut butter noodle okay   all good foods w warm bottle soju  back more   very mellow cozy settling   very nice clean place talk over street foods beer  back more  <EOR> We came around 9 night  place difficult find lack lighting illuminating area plaza  place decorated nicely booth seating very comfortable! think since booths draped decorative curtains sight server would wave over whenever needed helped  When order mark laminated sheet dry erase marker  thought pretty clever  Although thought marked chicken katsu musubi but instead regular spam musubi  sure marking proper because you're marking its number rather having name dish paper  So! Onto food Grilled Squid 5 5 Good sized portion  Very flavorful good texture   Lychee Milk Tea Boba 3 5 5 Taste good but very picky boba texture  squishy would liked  really liked milk tea wasn't super sweet tho    Spam Musubi 5 5 Can't really mess up  noticed rice topped some sauce  Spam cooked til warm rather browned  know everyone different versions preferences just thought I'd give description   Chicken Katsu Musubi 4 5 nice spin musubi  just wish topped katsu sauce something side  Overall very tasty   BBQ Beef Skewer 1 5 5 supposed free taking photo sharing Facebook  Ended charging us  itself wasn't big deal very inexpensive anyway  taste good  put wayyyy much cumin meat love cumin! just don't want feel all am eating  left  5 because felt cooked well texture meat nice tender but only able eat two bites  Even spoonful rice didn't cancel out    Service decent give 4 5 being Chinatown  very polite    My boyfriend only ones but place fairly new  Overall nice place date night! Hopefully service still decent when more customers restaurant  <EOR> Cute spot cozy private booths  Menu includes variety tapas sized apps snacks plus combination plate specials boba drinks  wasn't really impressed tried but would consider coming back other items   POKE $6 app flavorful shoyu? tuna version fish fresh recommend dish  SKEWERS every other review states seasoned insane amount cumin  paste coating every skewer point where can't even taste meat  Whoever's kitchen needs chill seasoning  MACARONS surprise! Ordered them small sweet treat expected them dry crumbly many places Vegas  But 2 piece lemon flavor soft delicate great punch citrus flavor! completely nuts come more macarons yet pretty sure  keep them radar   Service quick prices fairly low  décor cute booths would great catching friend having more private but still casual date  They'll improve food other macarons obviously come back though  <EOR>
