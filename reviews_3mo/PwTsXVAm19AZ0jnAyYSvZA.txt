After seeing advertisement Seven Magazine determined try place because suckah lobstah!  There two locations town Anthem Eastern Serene  some trouble finding Serene because inside Doc Holliday's isn't lot light  lot bigger appears outside    I started cup seafood chowder  potential because flavorful but served lukewarm wasn't thick I'd like  ordered U Conn Roll which full succulent lobster inside warm roll  came side fries  husband ordered lobster mac cheese disappointing  tasted boxed Kraft mac cheese chunks lobster   The only redeeming thing place enjoyed lobster roll  Service just okay  think place potential but won't way back again all other options town  <EOR> After reading glowing report RJ gave try  Serene location inside Doc Holidays Saloon   Food great but service lousy  server nice but she didnt refill drinks check point only customers    Place bit dirty smokey   While food good everything else not   Whover managing place needs work harder   Too many better places especially area  <EOR> Horrible!! Six dinner soup salad 3 lobster dinnahs samplah mozzerella sticks kiddos mac cheese     Of course soups salads girls' food came first   liked put little blueberries salads mozzerella sticks pretty generic   soup came cold sent back reheated   friends' daughter didn't mac cheese send back   waitress came over said Well homemade  Aside being very rude comment cares if homemade if she doesn't it?!    All 3 lobster dinnahs cold send back well reheated   must cook bunch lobster all once then reheat them which doesn't anything taste tenderness meat   didn't taste very good first place even worse when came back couldn't eat all    No wonder place dead when walked blatantly rude staff cold tasteless food     NEVER mistake coming again!  Final words Spend few $ more Joe's Crab Shack  <EOR> First timer here   and GLAD options NON Lobstah fan! know know   you're probably thinking why would even restaurant name lobster if am lobster fan!? BUT defense business meeting didn't choose location   However really great BURGER! staff friendly Carol particular funny gave great service!  I'd again   and think try Chicken Quesadilla next! lol    <EOR> Despite many mixed reviews decided try place anyways   name monstah lobstah know doing lobsters least     We walked into restaurant Sunday evening because shares entrance Doc Hollidays separated another door attack cigarette smoke smell   Once inside looks quite cheesy red white checkered table cloths   place empty!  Bad sign   So seated person attended quite good seller   However stuck basics   Two lobster 2 5 lb each 1lb clams ordered U Conn Roll because read good reviews even reviewers given star   Steamed clams peel off outer layer end piece won't eating dirt   comes small bowl clam juice broth but didn't add much flavor me   put some salt pepper small dish squeeze some lemon accompanying sauce clams   brought some flavor enjoyed it   The U conn roll ok   liked fat fries next roll absorbing some buttah GOOD   anything w butter bad?!?  lobster roll other hand alright   But probably just me   I am fan lobster   The lobsters guys order ok   mentioned those lobsters tasted if though boiled life them   Would tasted better if steamed   Well all all aight  <EOR> This worst dining experience had  should known better when ONLY table 5 30 Sunday  looking forward trying restraunt since he came Vegas  Henderson location birthday  AWFUL  dirty  food edible  waitress Shawn brought baked potatoes brown inside outside corn old lobster cold rubery  companion ordered surf turf $24 99  steak nothing ever seen  1 4 inch thick all light brown fat   Allen Berube obviously doesn't restraunts if he does he should ashamed  <EOR> This fancy lobster restaraunt if looking dissapointed   Despite other reviews said decided give place shot   The food good  chowder bisque both piping hot yummy  Chowder thinner prefer though   I U Conn Roll which LOADED big chunks lobster  really curbed craving having  fiance lobster pasta  He said delicious would definitely order again   I ready some awful things service seriously nothing complain about  waitress really nice quite attentive  restaraunt slow no fighting attention    Next time hankering lobster roll definitely head Monstah Lobstah  <EOR> Great Mother's Day special $59 99 2ea 2lb lobsters HUGE 2 sides 2 desserts 2 coffees   never lobster large but perfectly cooked delicious  kids fish stick actually large piece sliced fish which great  No yucky minced crap  bit dissapointed didnt any chocolate cake dessert but did complimentary champagne which sweet    They pushed tables together group having kids relaxed atmosphere relieving   hope some more staff quickly holidays  sure your wait staff knows stock day advance  But staff sweet genuine hardly upset them    It seems every time more more people there  People may finding lil secret dive hot spot! Oh no! <EOR> Went lunch place only 2 tables other patrons should walked then   told sit anywhere waiter would bring menus  well 5 minutes waiter finally realized waiting menus  Ordered U conn lobster roll  the meat chewing rubber but fries really good  service horrible the waiter never came back see if needed anything no spoon stir coffee  counter check  Very disappointed <EOR> A good friend took dinner love seafood really enjoyed dinner!  being desert lobster wonderful Ucon roll simple yummy!  Chunks lobster toasted roll melted butter fries   The lobster cooked perfect tasted awesome!   I followed cup lobster bisque creamy hot loved it!  Stole hush puppy friend awesome also try lobster quesadilla everything tried great   I would recommend place anytime  and those say sandwich didn't pound fourth lobster should know lobster sold weighed SHELL adds just FYI <EOR> **Summary** U Conn Roll good  Lobstah dinner great  **Price** $45 2 **Ordered** U Conn Roll Very good  Perfectly toasted bun seasoned fries cooked just right  lobster chunks tad bit chewy though  Lobstah Dinnah Moist lobster dipped melted butter  Need say more  **Recommendations** I'd come back Lobstah Dinnah <EOR> Fresh seafood? No ordered shrimp $13 00 frozen sea pak style shrimp crinkle cut frozen fries wilted tasteless cup coleslaw  girl Lobsta dinner which little better but much  Veggies drowned butter soggy  Service just terrible  won't back sure! <EOR> This place blows! still trying figure place ruin something dip melted butter   but guys able manage it  <EOR>
