ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu \uuu \uuu 4 <EOR> A worthy addition LV Ramen community namely Monta Sora <EOR> I love ramen! wanted try place longest time but hours late 3pm 3am  off yesterday no wanted just myself!   seated immediately just party 1  sat bar took order quickly   waitress asked if before when told hadn't she explained menu reccommended favorite dish which chicken pork broth  love pork ordered tonkotsu assari  came immediately  broth actually lot lighter am used to   broth heavy thick  plenty veggies top  first scared it'd all veggies but noodles hiding underneath mountain bean sprouts  noodles only noodleson menu thick  reviews complain only 1 piece chasu but mine 3 pieces    My younger sister last minute wanted some ramen order spicy chicken ramen spice flavor hot her  order actually took little bit longer more crowded   noodles thinner broth more chicken flavor  did spice level ramen broth  When ordered noodles take put noodles container broth another container  garnishes top noodles  sister just put noodles broth tasted wonderful  drive through coming soon which probably package that  wonder drive through going work noodles take while cook      Just minor complaint  spicy am part Korea but didn't any chili oil  Sadness  did chili powder spicy sauce but just wasn't same without chili oil    The service really good waitresses checked several times ensure everything okay  just didn't taste better expected  <EOR> I've waiting Jinya open while now hearing long while back during ramen festival  when did open course go  friends decided give try nights dinner   We started off organic tofu which made front you! pretty awesome see  texture tofu bit rough used when eating all could think wanted some syrup along turn into dessert tofu! Taste wise nothing really special but interesting experience   I also Jinya Bun try which pretty much pork belly bun  gotta say   I've better  lot sauce bun most times covered flavors pork belly    didn't really that  sweet smokey type sauce wasn't exactly very appealing me    As ramen decided spicy chicken ramen spiciest level  normally tonkotsu but most ramen places Vegas tonkotsu broth really heavy salty didn't really want there  Instead thin noodles decided sub thick noodles  noodles al dente most places don't cook thin ramen noodles way took chance thick ones    Good choices part  broth light very good  heavy salty spicy even though take really spicy things  Best all didn't tired taste it  When normally eat tonkotsu tired flavor really fast  noodles perfectly al dente!   On side note bathroom very romantic  quite dim some lights around mirror lights around toilet  toilet's lid automatically comes up! Its those bidets  pretty spiffy  All really need some soothing music bathroom could nice rendezvous there!   Overall great ramen  Would definitely come again try other things! <EOR> I finally decided stop driving past nearly everyday  interior looked much nicer expected before entered restaurant  small ramen bar front kitchen small Japanese themed dining area  staff all very friendly restaurant appeared very clean   The food service better average  would definitely recommend giving place go   Takoyaki excellent  If Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then dish  basically same ingredients then shaped bite size portions   Crispy Rice spicy tuna just says is  good   Crispy Chicken ponzu sauce would good choice if chicken would greasy  think oil fryer needed changed dropped chicken back fryer cooked   Spicy chicken ramen noodle ramen excellent  ordered Hot   lot heat but much heat could enjoy it  may just Spicy next time though  <EOR> If restaurant want order Brussels sprouts purpose quite accomplishment  order them every time visit Jinya plan regular  waiter welcomed back although I'd never seemed good beginning meal  Three ordered different ramens all raved them  tan tan men flavorful  ladies miss toilet experience! <EOR> This might new favorite Ramen joint  don't necessarily think Jinya beats Monta but definitely same level them  gyoza may little more tasty though    We've eaten Jinya couple times now  first when still pretty new boyfriend both tried Tonkatsu's  did Tonkatsu Assari he Tonkatsu Black  weird because when eat Ramen guess don't automatically notice difference flavor right away just think they're all good  tried mine next boyfriends able compare  Both delicious both win  also enjoy JInya because offer option making your ramen into combo which includes  salad other item gyoza fried chicken cali roll some kind meat bowl ordered friend chicken gyoza  Good deal! chicken incredibly juicy seasoned very well  atmosphere really nice also liked decor but think could utilized center room little better rather throwing oversized group table middle  table wide center doesn't any use really instead takes lot wasted space  Which wouldn't problem if food tastes horrible people didn't come there  But seeing food good people visit busy  Jinya should realized instead created two tables space available would accommodating   Oh yeah note ladies  Don't forget check bathroom  BEST TOILET ever seen  probably could've stayed bathroom while just played all amazing things smart toilet could do  haha  <EOR> No ramen no life! Wise words wise person  Las Vegas getting pretty wise recent years being hot destination spot ramen restaurants open  Its crazy think few years equal number fingers your hand only handful percentage residents knew ramen beyond its instant form? current day its hottest thing always spotlight local magazines its trend  Thankfully it'll never die cupcakes cronuts    Jinya NEWEST TRENDIEST ramen residents franchise locations places California Texas  Two pages variety include ramen suited carnivorous cravings vegetarians Vegetable Broth Ramen  Ordering combinations $4 5 such gyoza chasu bowls best bang your fairly spendy meal  wouldn't trendy without tapas available course  Jinya Bun $3 80 pork steam bun worth try once if steam buns but pass kaarage crispy chicken  assume its called Jinya Ramen BAR because offer various brews many delicious Japanese beers aren't widely available  seems pricey but trust liquor store pricing far off must importing    So ramen    unfortunately am fan four tried  blame Brittany Murphy  awful acting Ramen Girl really thinking soul heart true artisans put ramen Jinya just don't feel it  probably just crazy though  Tonkotsu Black premium white broth's both sour finish me  garlic chips fishy taste but could just me  enjoy taste chicken broth over pork am much appreciative variety Jinya offers   Maybe Ramen Girl onto something Sorry Jinya think there's gotta more heart something else beyond dim lighting bidets iPad ordering sushi 350k franchise opportunity community seating  <EOR> JINYA diverse menu compared most Ramen restaurants Las Vegas  offer dishes add onto your ramen pork gyoza Tokyo curry rice crispy chicken  JINYA also additional page tapas rice bowls desserts    My waitress recommended pork bun start  $3 80 most expensive single pork bun ordered  arrived small black plate toothpick center hold together   ended being reasonable size high price  bun fluffy unlike most pork belly meat lean  also very tender but thought lettuce bun unnecessary would done better just cucumber  sauce did pack enough punch mixed house made ramen sauce chili sauce dip rest bun into    For ramen decided chicken ramen because waitress said favorite just much flavor pork broth without being rich  She right most flavorful chicken ramen broth had  rich creamy but noodles chewy taste    JINYA ramen much better chicken broth any other ramen restaurants town  three house made sauces well executed diverse menu bring back even if am mood ramen  <EOR> JINYA JINYA JINYA ramen Las Vegas asking for  Granted only ramen three other restaurants but JINYA definitely top   The broth deep rich flavorful  Toppings varied fresh  greatest praise JINYA spicy ramen broth actually spicy! chashu pork thick but delicate melt in your mouth fat  Even chicken bowls chicken chashu isn't differentiated pork variety meaning just delicious even without melt in your mouth fat    JINYA offers pretty awesome appetizers tapas takoyaki anyone?   karaage always necessary order well  paid price burnt tongue many times just consume succulent pieces fried chicken  But what's really killer brussels sprouts tempura  Although already lover those mini cabbages thin crunchy slightly salted tempura version even better  Wish each order came more because addicting   The atmosphere amazing well  wood detailing dark lighting posters Ramen Life pretty cool late night place friends  mention bathrooms Japanese robot toilets  almost gave JINYA four five stars but those toilets    <EOR> Atmosphere nice only complaint music pretty loud some reason   Gyoza delicious!
