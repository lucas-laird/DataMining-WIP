EDIT 2018 place fucking awesome FTR doesn't really reflect feel Raku now     My wife found place through Mixi which kind Japanese myspace   Its only open 3 weeks wanted try another izakaya style place besides Ichiza which packed Memorial Day gave place go   The place bit small great groups over 4 but atmosphere wasn't bad   guess prefer Jpop over koto music but fine   specialty yakitori grilled stick type stuff   w chicken thigh $2 piece wasabi kobe beef $9 asparagus bacon $2 tsukune which grilled ground chicken stick   Everything tasted awesome   sure they're putting grill flavoring but its fantastic addictive     You definitely tell ingredients used higher quality Ichiza but menu lot smaller aside yakitori pricier too     Ofcourse weren't full all above tried some rice dishes along oden a winter food boiled soup  kinda hot pot    wife Tororo don which gooey potato mixed w soy sauce she loves but find inedible while ikura don which salmon roe eggs w seaweed rice   Both cost around $10 piece portions pretty small   Just small bowl rice w topping   Definitely disappointed w that   wife also bummed didn't natto     The oden tasty though   ordered chikuwa fish stick konnyaku daikon which all around $1 50 $2 piece   They only Sapporo beer but nice list sake shochu wines which would nice place some beverages small food   would also recommend just buying pitcher beer $22 pop opposed $5 glass if your party plans drinking least 4 glasses   WHOLE lot more w pitcher!!!!!    The bathroom funny only single unisex stall but put bunch fake flowers ceiling w speaker playing bird noises entire time   Priceless     Overall would rate place 3 5 stars but its closer 4 3    am just sticking grilled stuff next time back rice dish portions way overpriced   few tables ordered deep juicy fried chicken $8 which looked awesome maybe we'd next time   They're open til 3am which cool   Most patrons Japanese  I think 1 3 weren't    So yeah  this good alternative Ichiza although wouldn't say its better   just different  <EOR> I taken Japanese friend   Yes place small   Only 30 seats   I'd suggest no parties over 4 people   cozy room 5 seats counter I'd even tempted solo   The food quality!  while may connoisseur seems more authentic over more popular izakaya restaurants town   Memorable menu items   homemade tofu!!  Grilled tendon kobe beef foie gras mochi wrapped aburaage ahi collar   Desserts Cheesecake watermelon sorbet     I'm definitely goin back! <EOR> We Las Vegas recently friend lives area suggested try new restaurant   drive strip but well worth drive   food delicious service attentive but annoying way  <EOR> The first thing strikes intimacy place  Its located near Chinatown but off Spring Mountain hidden behind some other generic plaza near Savers  can't really just stumble place  need told it  Someone needs take there    The dining area just large enough accommodate maybe six small parties then five bar  wouldn't recommend parties more four    We 10p whole restaurant ourselves  hour later joint filled in    The decor very modern Japanese wood accents beautiful ceramic wall behind bar    All front house staff speaks Japanese very knowledgeable food drink menus    This kind place would take businessman Japan entertain impress  wonder if never want arrive reason  Keepin' exclusive    They don't served any sushi  Mostly everything grilled cooked hot pot style oden     Right off bat order five dishes per two people then things wind down order neeed  Its izakaya portions small pricey  favorites oden mochi aburaage scallop thing Kobe fillet yellowtail collar pork cheek fresh tofu tomato konbu iriko    They also asparagus cherry tomato wrapped bacon grilled salmon grilled musubi grilled corn wtih cob hollowed stuffed potato     don't know it     Some more exotic items include foie gras $12 even mouthful Kobe liver grilled tendon pork? beef tongue cooked carpaccio chicken stick dipped poached egg duck balsamic vinegar    The grilled items all good all but all teriyaki drizzled all over them  love teriyaki but  kind cheating    Their desserts all really good too  tried watermelon sorbet chocolate bubbly cheesecake lave cake green tea ice cream  can't pick favorite  lave cake really light lava cake  But order 15 minutes ahead  cheesecake Japanese style steamed fluffy  watermelon sorbet  Just try it    To eat enough fill you'll rack pretty hefty bill The four last night took $340  Bring big wallet  Don't bring big appetite  think traditionally izakayas drinking establishments food accompany food  other way around  We're doin wrong!   * off strip non casino <EOR> I've eaten quite few meals left feeling satisfied  This tops all them   best meal had   Food cooked exceptionally well   Great ingredients even down green tea salt togarashi high end soy sauce table   Everything tomato skewers foie gras custard udon soup unbelievable   Definitely again! <EOR>
