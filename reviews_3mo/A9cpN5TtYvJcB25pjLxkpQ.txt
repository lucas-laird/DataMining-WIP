This place opened right down street job far good  took over old Quiznos didn't change much inside  tell they're newer subway  staff generally pretty nice effective only time issues when ordering multiple sandwiches time then things start screwy  major plus give them vegetables always fresh while overly liberal no problem filling sandwich veggies if ask which two major things don't most locations  Overall experience more most subways kudos there <EOR>
