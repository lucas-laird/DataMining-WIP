The place quite small seating maybe 30 people including bar   During lunch wait seated   cooks open similar sushi bar trend   always good service although sometimes little bit communication problem    English isn't good sometimes! But  never annoyed because love soups here   So far only tried Tonkatsu  ordered extra pork egg I know shame butter   also order extra noodles if aren't big broth eater   Tonkatsu believe pork based broth   Its thick for broth little salty but salty very flavorful   pork cut very thinly juicy almost buttery   barely chew it   Now am no expert homemade noodles anything but noodles quite good    filling tasty     I can't wait try other two main ramen dishes have   know now isn't perfect time hot ramen but exception rule place any time! <EOR> I am Japanese Japan  tell ramen probably best ramen find Vegas  Taste pretty close find Japan  Five star me  <EOR> Talk ramen noodle supreme!  first time place Monday   ordered Tonkatsu addicted!  only provide 4 pieces pork soup order extra   hooked came back two days later    The place menu really small and lacked some a c but food well worth it    Reasonable prices too  <EOR> Went tonight hubby friend   ordered two tonkotsu ramen miso ramen side chashu order gyoza three beers tap total came $31 14 bad     The gyoza very tasty chashu nice tender noodles great broth alright nothing spectacular better grated garlic give you     put gyoza ramen kinda wonton mein mandoo kook soo there's something dumplings broth feel warm fuzzy inside my comfort food      It hot eating hot ramen does help husband couldn't wait there    Service fast friendly   far best ramen Vegas  <EOR> My boyfriend big ramen lover he said tonkotsu ramen Monta best he ever tried  think soap tonkotsu ramen good chashu which comes ramen VERY GOOD  Everytime order ramen pay $2 5 4 more pieces chashu because just good  chashu bowl think soso because chashu fried  Therefore good those ramen  think pork belly bowl soso nothing special it  fried rice think tastes good smells good  only tried fried rice   didnt try kimchi veggie  gyoza think okay  Nothing special too   Overall would recommend try ramen fried rice  price really cheap delicious !!!
