Not greatest Mexican food ever but certainly worst   waiter wasn't great but he did ensure fast service   ordered chicken tortilla soup cheapest thing menu quite tasty well   soup generous portions chicken nice because restaurants skip meat portions quite often    Instead traditional red salsa give salsa verde another dip tastes similar guacamole but salsa form   Good food good price but there's nothing special place  <EOR> My friend randomly picked place while walking through New York New York   atmosphere just any typical chain Mexican places think multi color Christmas lights strung above your head    seated within 10 minutes promptly basket chips two salsas   chips very fresh   they hot just frier warming oven and greasy all    Salsa tasty spicy   Tacos al Carbon friend crunchy tacos $11 95 $10 95 respectfully both served rice beans   Good prices good food! <EOR>
