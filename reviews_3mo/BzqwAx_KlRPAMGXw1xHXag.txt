I agree  place good  few times food always fresh  love Gyros plates also  good salads  pizza which fair say because your typical Med type New York style pizza which don't personally care for  others type pizza might think great  restaurant newer clean along bathrooms another way judge restaurants   worth try! <EOR> I came across place day while running Walmart Neighborhood market being huge fan Greek food    I check out  setting simple very casual dining  atmosphere comfortable coast clear bring kids clients pretentious  Now real reason people read reviews    prices wonderful food spectacular service good  Again casual dining restaurant however if good food your looking place! beats many other high priced Mediterranean eateries  Oh try Baklava wow fan dessert until ate there  <EOR>
