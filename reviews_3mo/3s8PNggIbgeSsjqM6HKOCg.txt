The salads tasty but bit pricey  Lunch two small drinks $23!  expected cheaper Jason's Deli's salad bar because fewer standard choices i e  pudding humus cottage cheese    menu doesn't offer many non salad lunch options either   bright side ambiance nice vintage movie photos great touch  <EOR> Cool find downtown Las Vegas!  took over old Potato Valley Café which awesome but just good if better   This restaurant specializes make your own chopped salad   fill form http www theverdictsinn com images VI_Chopped_Salad_Form pdf let magic happen   Unlimited ingredients   Whatever dream up   Then chop serve you   Very tasty only $7 unless add meat avocado artichoke which cost extra   comes pretzel bread which isn't best but passable     I also tried chicken burrito $6 which special occasionally   made brown rice ton vegetables   yummy!  comes salsa sour cream tortilla chips   tortilla chips weren't great kind stale   But burrito excellent   Really fresh ingredients all difference     They serve wraps soups smoothies hot dogs addition daily specials   legal theme cute   offer repeat offender card where free wrap smoothie hot dog 9 meals   Good lunch places sparse downtown definitely repeat offender  <EOR> I'm loving all new food treasures Downtown lately!  joint walking distance dad's office stopped other day   fitting old courtroom decor movie posters Inherit Wind!  I immediately decided brown rice bowl Limonata dad ordered wrap   only ones enjoying late lunch but staff made feel welcome without close 30 minutes vibe quite enjoyable   I'm looking foward next meeting Downtown   hopefully around lunchtime stop again   Also could perfect spot Saturday brunch! <EOR> I'm no expert but would assume its good idea open restaurant until you're able provide best service your full product   I read review Las Vegas Seven magazine place sounded great  Walking place looked charming described magazine but menu definitely limited  Just sandwiches hot dogs smoothies veggie bowls smoothies   I made mistake ordering turkey sandwich which just regular sandwich bread plan deli meat cheese gross white part lettuce soggy tomatoes  worth price all  order chips literally I counted them 7 chips   Their chopped salads looked something you'd clean lawn mower but nearly everyone int he restaurant eating one   My dining partner hotdog offensively long only served small thimble sized servings mustard ketchup relish onions   Again price location you'd expect least *some* effort into dishes   I've tried Verdict's Inn recently because close office because smoothies aren't bad but seriously mess smoothie? but doors locked  sure if they've already gone business they've decided wait open when they're able serve good food   I hoped best because location but if you're downtown you're hungry until Verdicts Inn act together you're better off 6th Fremont  <EOR> I am completely biased due fact live above restaurant but say Italian sandwich live for! almost religiously fact enjoy amazingly healthy smoothie experience all better    Though only open few months where heading food selections    The Verdicts Inn great place nice lunch people watch especially since 100ft world famous Pawn Stars! <EOR> ok  ridiculously addicted chopped salads  great pick your own toppings its impossible mess up   Friendly staff great service great location  cake pops? Diet Coke? WINNING! <EOR>
