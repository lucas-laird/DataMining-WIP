Check show won't mad  <EOR> Actually hailing natively Brooklyn going original Brooklyn Bowl initial thoughts were wish Vegas would just itself  But learning longer Vegas' culture actually just appropriation all other cultures    That being said actually really dope inside whole area incredible Brooklyn Bowl significantly bigger! also giant industrial wasteland which appreciate  see Roots perform free highlight duh    Blue Ribbon y'all already know  Fried chicken always gets two thumbs wink! Lots attractive locals seem frequent which happy  LONG TIME coming Vegas needed place this  Somewhere Strip open walkable atmosphere down earth something overly kitschy glitzy touristy  sure once Linq actually opens it'll shit show  Until then into it    Lastly hung Bruce Bromberg patio obviously  going color opinion  All all wonderful night back many more  <EOR> Because bowling shoes dancing shoes! It's always tough reviewing concert venues because actual show such major factor  Seriously Kenny G anywhere or Kenny Loggins Kenny Chesney     pretty much any Kenny going suck  Elvis Costello Roots other hand any joint your favorite place Earth night   The beauty Brooklyn Bowl its own perfect game going  people running staffing BB separate class awesome  In particular Adrees Ali earned title Grand Protector Redeemer  took made sure everything needed sent home feeling we'd just found true oasis desert   I confess mostly hate Vegas  BB understands everyone wants wallow desperate skank floods every casino most every corner strip  They've found right blend food drink music atmosphere naturally added bowling! works brilliantly  Even without tasty grub ten pin hijinks great venue  sound excellent no matter where are  floor balcony bowling deck  you clear sight lines  size ideal just under 2 000 capacity tell musicians feel intimacy well  whole affair also screaming good deal   If your show starts 9 00 grab lane 7 00  you're taken care of  kind magic Copperfield can't touch  <EOR> Great food atmosphere but two rounds shots 5 plate fries 2 games bowling came 360 00!!!!  would NEVER back here     way over priced     <EOR> I really dig venue  Roots playing night arrived early start night off drinks some famous fried chicken    The fried chicken top notch  Loved seasoning it  Probably best city Note Vegas isn't really known fried chicken   Super juicy but greasy  Real good combo some beer Magic Hat tap   Came $20 4 pieces chicken collared greens mashed potatoes slice white bread  Wasn't hungry shared friend  Good stuff munch while waiting  eat indoors outdoors view Linq  great people watching   As music venue really great too  just overall fun atmosphere around  Plenty bars lots walking room outdoor 2nd story patio some air  also liked fact away stage some seats where actually hear conversations company   I didn't try bowling but alley looked really modern trendy  More upscale most bowling alleys seen   All all really great venue offers lot do  looks some great artists lined perform future  definitely going dropping often  <EOR> Amazing service! Seriously don't think ever picked after   Loved Rock Roll fries but they're acquired taste sure  fried chicken   so good  Crispy goodness served collard greens mashed potatoes  The atmosphere fun   a little loud next bowling alley but fine dining terrible   Oh adobo corn   get that! <EOR> I am pretty freaking excited now Brooklyn Bowl! VEGAS officially taking over! FUN! =D  A few days ago friends family check first time see Roots so yet actually bowl there!   huge line outside but since venue pretty big fairly quickly   The stage fairly small but plenty room move around if watching show  couple bars close stage bartenders pretty fast lines aren't CRAY    One coolest things observed bowling lanes upstairs downstairs! Also if performance going huge screens front alley watch while bowl! 8 Now isn't cool?!  I definitely update soon finally bowling but mean time check out!  PS  did hear kids bowl before 8pm bring family!  HAVE FUN! =D <EOR> Went Elvis Costello Roots concert! venue! dinner patio over looking 16 Block Hospitality High Roller nice view! Fried Chicken wings good   serve honey put fried chicken   blowling alley double decker lanes thought super awesome! same time concert area jumping! Bars all over lounge front Bomb! back! <EOR> I nights offered free bowling 90 minutes plus half off food locals   Couldn't over size place!  Vegas come long way Gold Coast bowling alley   least GC still all those great photos people bowling poses scoring 300     Good luck throwing 300 here!  If anyone manages all flashing lights pizza grease your thumb enhancing spin ball ever slightly might test positive some substances   I'd also meet you    But bowling good isn't all Brooklyn Bowl   feel  true but might still 2% sore over losing girl   even barely     dominated   atmosphere really cool good beers tap starting $8 balcony could sneaky chill when gets warmer   lot fun venue         I wasn't digging seats bowling   would awkward if party 4 all sat big leather couch together tight squeeze   party 8 across table pretty bunched up   also would've kind mess ordered drinks food since all 12 sharing albeit long table     Definitely dine before bowling because eating your hands playing balls then eating more gross   Someone bound pink eye worse   Although The Fatty pizza Stouffer's French bread pizza steroids delicious eat fork while standing    kinda lame     It's all minor stuff whole picture things   Can't wait check some shows!  Lots great acts schedule already  <EOR> This venue mind blowing!! Music booze food bowling all roof    definitely can't any better that   Came see Roots set ridiculous!! stage quite small but wasn't crowded  also 5 bars throughout place serving Brooklyn brews tap   dope though?!  What most excited Brooklyn Bowl Bromberg Brothers serving Blue Ribbon fried chicken right around neighborhood till four morning   sure eat hot sauce honey    foodporn!!  Bowling alleys two floors overlooking stage   much bowler but I'd actually try place   sure if need show tickets bowl when someone's performing   also stream concert front alley players see what's going stage while having game   Then again why trade epic live performance bowling?!  Overall Brooklyn Bowl certainly Las Vegas' awesome music venues   pick over Boulevard Pool House Blues any day  <EOR> While concept Brooklyn Bowl good space small concert great  security staff far less friendly very confusing know where your allowed go  Many different colored wristbands no rhyme reason where being brand new establishment would think security would bit more friendly when explain MANY rules place  definitely need lesson customer service  <EOR> Great design but many rules loads if security night club but during day  <EOR> really rad place bowling concerts food drinks patio nice atmosphere plenty room good time  seeing more shows future! <EOR> Brooklyn Bowl far most amazing indoor music venue ever without doubt coolest new spot Las Vegas   Finally 21+ venue books great talent does focus electronic music DJs Vegas club scene!  We grabbed tickets see Local Natives Sunday night   First all venue absolutely gigantic  outside would never expected big  There's restaurant area back check food 5 different bars nice exterior border space  TWO floors everyone access each floor bars along side stage   tap options include Rogue Dead Guy Ale three different Brooklyn Brews beers  bar staff also really friendly helpful ordering Dead Guy Ale coke bar tender asked if coke DD when said yes she said no charge  Little things really made feel happy where spending time money    I don't think there's bad view stage any spot entire venue  floor area front stage looks big first glimpse but soon band takes stage begins play area immediately begins feel more intimate which great live music atmosphere  venue also pretty solid audio visual  They're trying much hanging huge screens everywhere over top lights LED laser shows   Instead focus band music highlighted impressive mix smoke effects color schemes  No distractions let music venue speak itself   sound absolutely incredible every angle  stood floor side stage bar back upstairs booth bowling alley sound consistently great  sure if because Local Natives playing they SUCH great live band but super impressed Brooklyn Bowl's acoustics     Oh yeah bowling alley inside lanes both floors!!! back every lane giant leather booth overlooks stage don't miss anything while you're bowling     just hang enjoy show  Reserving lane probably way when you've big group friends drink food service seating bowling huge screens above every lane show live feed band  playing  place any cooler??

Nope but damn good recommend ordering it  being said hell know? Well let tell you!

I came other night Lauryn Hill concert  friends aren't huge fans dishing $70 ticket bit much  Instead decided dine restaurant listen singing background  1+ hour wait table when first there  big deal  left number hostess she said she would text when table ready  15 minutes later text rushed back! just time because opening act finishing ms hill set stage    We ordered beers fried chicken  delicious! dark meat  juicy crispy  only thing sucked wait loooong time honey ranch come out  busy though don't really mind    The waiters servers awesome  friend accidentally tipped half empty beer over spilled bit table  main server brought extra filled beer free  Super nice him!   I love Brooklyn Bowl! Free concert while grubbin some good food beer! <EOR> This place jammed pack  Very busy million things going once  Came lauryn hill show  seems though if already bowling didn't buy ticket watch show while bowl    $70 could possibly saved? kinda bummed no sitting areas view show _ everything big cluster f     need find way better manage concert area    For show itself performances great liked she remixed all songs  Almost 2 hr intermission opening act ridiculous!!! she performed hr then left stage left venue  IDK if concert over then not     I would return bowl try food  <EOR> This place might known hot new concert venue but shouldn't overlooked its food  menu Bromberg brothers Blue Ribbon fame fried chicken garnered much praise  mixed fried chicken dinner might pricey at least lunch but didn't disappoint  Consisting half chicken  breast wing thigh drumstick  plenty filling almost any hungry diner  Plus comes mashed potatoes collard greens  You'd hard pressed find exterior delicately crispy crunchy flavorful coating fried chicken  Along meat juicy tender far best fried chicken town  <EOR> I decided take stroll around Linq tonight check some new restaurants shops popped last month  stopped into Brooklyn Bowl grab bite eat totally impressed! staff super friendly bartender Paul super hot! food great! Chicken Muffuletta sandwich side mixed greens  greens lightly dressed sandwich absolute perfection  There's olive spread sandwich bring just right amount salt meal  Delish! definitely back! <EOR> Unfortunately worst customer service experience really long time  repeatedly ask drink orders  friend asked twice place order order ignored  tried ask another waiter but when asked he said place waiter e going him  Twice did waiter never came  TWO hours later never drinks!!!  It honestly worst case just giving F #k employees there     The only reason place deserves star because food good even though ordering food also quite challenge  <EOR> Just saw Tedeschi Trucks Band Brooklyn Bowl  Wow!! unbelievable place see concert  early grab some food before show  Very cool sorta comfort food bar food  boring ordered burger brother ordered BBQ pork Sliders  Service fast friendly food excellent  If local check place out  know most locals want avoid strip most time but worth your time  All bowling lanes situated right next stage floor where concerts bowling enjoy concert we didn't bowl time but next time    venue small probably would hold 2500 max floor set no seating wander right stage if want  hard explain cool place really hope here  Ticket prices totally reasonable ordered tickets online paid $35 each saw them last year Hard Rock three times price great seats    back every chance get  <EOR> Positively awesome   If could take House Blues mix bowling alley put some great food cool bar then sprinkle cabana like service would it     This place really cool   really super cool  family just noon couldn't believe fun was  very kid friendly right opening noon but would think would change around 4pm atmosphere must truly adult like as should  be      Our service spot on made experience great   felt just cabana service major Strip resorts but bowling alley  took brain few minutes wrap around concept     I can't wait see show here  missed Cake  Grrrr   I really place  see things next visit  <EOR>
