We browsing food truck line First Friday's May 2 2014 many trucks didn't know where begin! didn't any cash luckily cute little Filipino food truck accepted credit cards  glad first stop since best truck tried entire night    The BBQ pork belly sandwich sounded right ally  sandwich looked simple wasn't anything else inside sandwich except pork belly but love first bite! packed delicious flavor salty sweet really moist tender butta! satisfying addicting  enjoyed it! If sandwiches aren't your thing totally top rice well    We've also tried lumpia which Filipino egg rolls filled savory meat  bite sized absolutely addicting!
