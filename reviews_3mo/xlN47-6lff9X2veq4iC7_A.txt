I spent week temping office Wells Fargo Tower ate twice  little cafe connected tower obviously caters all businesses Howard Hughes Center business park  All people coming employees around area  Surprisingly enough super busy Noon lunchtime both times exactly Noon  However appear thriving take out business  guess most people days just can't office even if place they're ordering just few floors down them   Anyway nice enough joint seating inside out  HUGE menu considering small place is  cold sandwiches hot sandwiches plates mostly Greek origin wraps soups salads    On two days hot sandwich Turkey Loco which okay but just did realize going any veggies all  Guess  own fault  Second day gyro salad  Basically gyro meat bed lettuce but also comes dressing tzatziki sauce cucumbers tomatos red green peppers yum!  I suggest going salads because most bang your buck  salads generous since you're paying much everything $6+ might well most it!   Not many people going just come because want bite eat but if find yourself working Howard Hughes Center place definitely do  <EOR>
