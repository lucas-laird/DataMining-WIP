I pleasantly surprised find decent restaurant Luxor!  last dining experience sub par but T T actually quite nice   margaritas made fresh fruit juice taste pretty good   didn't care tortilla chips think mixture flour corn   But salsa guacamole above average   fajitas tasty Gerald's burrito very good   finished dinner cafe au lait which made extremely well   I would probably back if Luxor but still prefer Diego MGM Grand even though gone bit downhill lately  <EOR> We stopped watching excruciating Criss Angel Believe show which another story entirely  seated quickly but hostess waiter kept going should come Saturday because dancing fun non stop tequila action really should come different night  Well want turn around leave? Thanks dashing hopes wonderful evening  But stayed food lot better expected  salsa assortment delicious fish tacos although portions bit small  expected know El Torito sized plates  general food good T T nice place stop if you're already inside Luxor  But don't your way  <EOR> This great place kick back enjoy margarita   There's plenty tequilas choose great food   Try pomegranate açai margarita chile rellenos   Both rave reviews table  <EOR> Been before terrible chicken Fajita dry bone   time much better   Bean cheese enchilada well received carnitas tacos needed sour cream something else but pretty good  <EOR>
