I usually stick BBQ Chicken cutlet whenever Hawaiian places but time decided try Mahi Mahi   disappointed   fish nice flaky oily   also good amount food money   am definitely happy place close stations work at   pretty wide selection but would love see some scallops here   Good food good prices clean kitchen nice people  <EOR> Unfortunately food can't kindness owners  much better Hawaiian BBQ places around same price Las Vegas   I Chicken Katsu which become staple Hawaiian BBQ Las Vegas theirs just wasn't very good  chicken itself seemed low quality sauce wasn't sweet all actually tasted little bitter which huge turnoff  only arousal came when tried macaroni salad which actually delicious   Overall place just another Hawaiian BBQ place Las Vegas won't heading back to  <EOR>
