Hear ye hear ye kids love place!   Jousting yelling your King cool techno fireworks just when least expect dancing maidens acrobats huge chickens eat ye hands!  show great food good but feel wasted alot because none could finish meals   If your child does loud noise recommend bringing ear plugs   ambiance whole show fantastic!  show knights kings let your kids pet horses take pictures  Sometimes also magician crowd give your child magic stone   much fun    Good company always equates great time!!  sure bring friends loud into whole character show! <EOR>
