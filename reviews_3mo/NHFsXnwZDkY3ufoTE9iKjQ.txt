New location McCarran Marketplace  place heavily staffed due grand opening everyone sure your experience top notch  interior nice modern but very loud echoes quite bad space needs acoustical panels ceiling  consider somewhat fast food option but overall quality pretty decent is  also Patron margaritas 7 dollars should mood strike you  <EOR> Clean fast fresh  Decor slightly updated new location but same modern minimalist feel  Nothing else say chipote never does wrong lol <EOR> I really Chipotle experience eating other Chipotle restaurants usually well    This location just opened near school which THOUGHT very convenient especially since order off phone select time pick up     So today group classmates ordered food pick selected pick time 1 30  ready soon which good  sat down ready eat  ordered burrito bowl brown rice no beans fajitas chicken corn salsa fresh tomato salsa sour cream cheese guac  classmate ordered chicken bowl brown rice black beans corn salsa fresh tomato salsa sour cream cheese lettuce  Whoever made order completely wrote  bowl only beans but both pinto black  Ummm   Wtf?! Also didn't fajitas  classmates bowl seemed missing fajitas but bowl no beans  guessing whoever made bowls wasn't paying attention he she doing  Whatever  Easy mistake when busy right? Although busier Chipotles never order messed up   Anyways realized bowls wrong immediately brought them front  girl cash register extremely rude  Clearly she ignoring stood front good 2 minutes she once acknowledged until said EXCUSE ME  When told bowls messed she sighed rolled eyes  Great customer service! NOT! She told coworkers came help us  She very nice right away made new bowls correct way  other girl learn some customer service!!   Aside messed order rude employee place clean  There's plenty places sit inside out  chipotle gets busy during lunch  shopping area general always busy  <EOR> I commend place attempts making place more viable vegans vegetarians  They changed way pinto beans doesn't contain bacon anymore  They've also offered new type Sofritas basically flavored tofu substitute your dead animal corpse    However always brag cheaper no meat burrito guacamole pay extra but Sofritas comes extra  Why am paying price meat tofu waaaayyyy cheaper damn sure? Sorry Sofritas you're damn good   The service always great workers very nice work really quick  place new hope positive atmosphere stays particular location  <EOR> Over all bad place  clean staff fast friendly  Food moderately priced tastes pretty good  wife liked lot more did  She vegetarian good options that    With being said personally taste similar food café Rio  convenient place gab bite eat  If area hungry stop <EOR> I am usually big Chipotle fan but am sure going location    freezing cold blasts air conditioning beating down music coming speaker box around drink station loud could even hear person your own table chairs uncomfortable no booths    food brown rice fajita veggies chips stale lacked usual salty lime bite love   staff nice but seemed little confused   All all still hit Chipotle regularly but doubt return location  <EOR>
