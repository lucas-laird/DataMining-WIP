The newest Izakaya establishment Las Vegas  They've just opened door last week   This place conveniently located mall next Palms Casino Resort much closer center strip most Japanese restaurants Chinatown   The owner three restaurants Tokyo first branch US  No wonder foods authentic familiar modern feel if you've ever lived Japan   I'm impressed selection small bite appetizers Izakaya all about! yakitoris hot items  Qualitywise items hit miss guessing due grand opening mess but pretty good average   Some notable items are    salmon carpaccio uni deep fried octopus bakudan steak bowl   Some yakitoris meager portion but overall great creativity decent pricing   In Vegas Izakaya style Japanese restaurants booming Raku Kyara Ichiza name few Cocokala much welcomed addition scene   The name bit hard spell though  play words koko kara which Japanese idiom means probably twisted way communicate Japanese clientele   The location great deal imagine eating quite regularly  <EOR> Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects lot would found typical street corner izakaya Japan couple wrinkles norm   excited check out   Things looking even better when only non Japanese patron restaurant 75% full Sunday night    always good sign!    Shocking right off bat being served cold edamame   Although typical other places like umm  Japan? actually met people grew Vegas thinking edamame always served hot   Even expect hot everytime LV now chrissakes   could tell place gave damn keeping real just itty bitty green things   My wife ready order bakudan soon sat down   She thinks natto fermented soybeans smell foot corpse taste even worse single greatest culinary contribution Japan world   Cocokala's version included said item tuna okra yamaimo mountain potato spicy mustard   Mix everything town because you're braver person I   She thought awesome     I didn't expect grilled saba mackerel favorite dish but totally was   Nice portioned filet terrific char tender meat oil fish considering another order soon finished   very well samurai barley beer which strongest brew 10% alcohol     I also bottle stout brewed oysters which tasted you'd expect     super funky Guinness   wife loved Echigo red ale   All premium brews $9 $10 12 oz bottle   also nice selection sake shochu         Their chawanmushi egg custard chockful seafood deliciousness rivaled Kyara's version   also thought highly take black cod miso   everything you'd expect very reasonable price     Chicken cartilage skewers something missed dearly days Japan   Usually cartilage stripped naked any meat before grilled but kind liked better way chicken meat still it   Cocokala would become new best friend if started serving fried chicken cartilage Some stuff didn't visit five stars but they're all things correctable probably due being new   thought white meat yakitori very dry   ume jiso sour plum sauce kind masked dryness little but wasabi yakitori wasn't good   mistakenly added grilled hamachi receipt   instead being offered refill water glasses simply taken away     None very big issues   am just happy there's another quality izakaya town!! <EOR> We enjoyed lots selection Beer Sake   wished if house hot sake but OK cuz many choose it   hard find tasty Agedashi dofu but excellent!!!  true Agedashi dofu  <EOR> This place ridiculous   It took 40 minutes them process credit cards  open restaurant without learning use credit card processing system before hand? Please learn run business better    We came party 8 split checks  through mass confusion ordered when bringing food  Shouldn't figuring before hand?   I tried several items menu nothing made want come back try food which means most likely coming back  <EOR> Being newly opened only couple weeks restaurant already seems its regulars everyone coming actually knowing each other if walked private event   guess  good sign authenticity dishes since Japanese people frequent location   Great selection beer sake   Looking through list oyster stout sticks more others   bit apprehensive getting though due idea being brewed shellfish   Surprisingly tasted just Guinness minute hint oyster sauce flavor   Another first would bakudan  natto tuna yamaimo mountain potato okra mixed bowl spicy mustard soy sauce   dish somewhat reminded poached egg dish sea urchin salmon roe Raku   however isn't faint heart especially natto fermented soy beans quite off putting those haven't before because its strong smell slimy texture   Everything else ordered delicious cooked perfectly   bad place isn't robata nonetheless flavors point   grilled Salmon Kama won't disappointed   yakitori also reasonably priced   ended ordering multiples chicken gizzard cartilage   Overall Izakaya Cocokala great addition Japanese restaurants valley   Delicious food superb service   Dope place hang friends  <EOR> This place brand new more modern style  Food great but service even better!
