Ate last night while staying cabin Mountain  Its Mount  Charleston Hotel  menu pretty simple but reasonably priced being only real place eat mountain  Steaks chicken some pretty good appetizers  french onion soup pretty good too  restaurant itself pretty small but decorated pretty nice  flowers tables multiple fireplaces Enya playing background     Most tables situated windows almost every table great view surrounding mountains  took off star because candle table wasnt lit never brought bread said would another because steak little charred outside but least still medium rare inside ordered it  did serve A 1 sauce? Which personally dont think any steak house takes itself seriously should ever do  wine list simple but good alot wines glass  Overall decent place dinner while mountain even though better places 45 minute drive away city I'd recommend view ambiance  if your inclined room pretty reasonable price worry drive home  <EOR>
