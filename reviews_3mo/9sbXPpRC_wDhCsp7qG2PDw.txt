A place really similar menu venerable HK Star  fail execute dishes eloquently inexpensively HK Star  Located across street Ichiza right next Pho Kinh Do!   I came tougher critic believe Mom Sunday evening  No else good sign   @ Soup Included meal  good par stuff HK Star   @ Shrimp Tofu tofu good  saw shrimp but couldn't really taste shrimp all since overpowered tofu  Just regular tofu next time   @ Sizzling Beef came sizzling plate  While good item sauced fairly heavy little more salty side  Food Express dish right   @ Bi Fung Tong Seabass favorite dish HK Star  Even though HK Star uses frozen seabass dish place doesn't taste fresh them  just lacks spicy kick HK Star offers  bad dish overall but could lot better   @ Roast Duck duck bad recommend going Sam Woo your ducks recommend against going Sam Woo entirely past! all fairness HK Star fairly bad reviews duck well  lacked nice crispy skin firm meat duck unhealthy eat but oh good   @ Thai Ice Tea whatever  tasted much better stuff before    @ Carrot Desert carrot dessert soup  full opted it  included meal    Lobster $10 pound $1 12 more HK Star  Across board everything same couple bucks more HK Star but nothing terribly expensive  also $5 $6 lunch special menu HK Star    This place seems wide selection ChaoZhou dishes  Upon further research type cuisine tends healthier seafood veggie dishes other Chinese cuisine  tend less flavoring letting ingredients speak themselves  similar philosophy Japanese food  Whether place actually follows philosophy can't confirm   This place fairly new having 5 months  place related HK Star anyway despite similar menu name  inside feels cheap all fans there  But best chinese restaurants notorious looking nice inside!  Service really iffy  terms getting food they're fast HK Star  Since its only couple mintues slower its still reasonable dishes  waitress speaks mainly Chinese very little English may language barriers those only speak English    They 2 promotions where  if spend $38+ free vermicilli dish if spend $55+ free 1 5lb crab  cool all but waitress could just answered question much needed spend $38  She asking if wanted soda thai ice tea implying free  charged it  When asked she says oh its $38 free item  Just tell need $3 more pick own item  Uncool sneaky way that  able duck instead vermicilli dish little social engineering     I only came because food whore check other options despite HK Star being very good me  guess put head shame walk back into HK Star ask forgiveness   You would only come if factor HK Star wanted ChaoZhou dishes  HK Star better place every way price taste service  only thing over HK Star its more tourist East side friendly since its closer strip open till 3am late night eaters    Not Chinese Mom approved  <EOR> Wow    T T  good   love review   only HK Star once did enjoy food but tonight HK Seafood Garden   I rated place higher because friendly waitress staff also good food   great company so   that helped them four stars also  op  This month's special fried flounder   very crispy moist inside   baby gone right away   delicious   The place clean   ample people restaurant when slowly people started coming in     Overall service great place clean food tasteful   recommend  <EOR>
