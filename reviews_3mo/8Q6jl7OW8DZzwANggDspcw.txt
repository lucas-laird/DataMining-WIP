The fact Sugar Factory candy store just across way REALLY indulge sweet tooth yours   The Cons The theme restaurant seemed really discord food restaurant   mean American Brasserie    My soup French Onion Soup which usually am big fan really salty all cheese gooped bottom instead being nicely melted toasted top   still good   but definitely good enough finish little cup portion   The reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory feel while ambiance pretty everything place decor book style menu unfocused menu   made feel Cheesecake Factory  Eh  favorite restaurants   The salad yeah know above pros section  stand fact Caesar pretty good   just wish salad bit crisper   All all those places come because    or need entertain your children sending em over indulge sugar side while try enjoy yourself 'brasserie' side   Probably won't craving place but wouldn't against coming again  <EOR> If delicious turkey crepe cookies would given star  service horrible decor obnoxious cupcake desserts kid 4 5th icing seriously gross    waitress no newbie but maybe she many tables maybe she wasn't bright maybe she just slow she couldn't recall order time she computer  She totally forgot appetizer appreciate fact she owned twenty minutes later   time food finally arrived pasta cold but hungry didn't send back   Stick carry desserts  <EOR> We found Sugar Factory random outting night landed Vegas few places open eat such late time 3 AM perfect late night craves   menu ranges breakfast crepes pastas burgers desserts bit overwhelming  just asked waitress she recommended she wasn't kidding when she said try Fettucine Alfredo which normally would never order choice pasta but really surprisingly good wish knew recipe it! sauce very flavorful hint garlic pasta cooked PERFECTLY looks very plain eye but tastes amazing!!  crave dish normally don't even pretty darn good  ended going back 3 times just eat pasta again again! <EOR> Nice atmosphere Cheesefactory Susie? Hmm thought nicer very airy dark agreement   said claim fame front seat Bellagio fountains fountain show but would only meaningful if ground underneath them raked second floor  lamp poles people street traffic more people blocking see tips vertical glimpses fountain big deal  we patio outside! It's all ordered yes? feels absolutely right give two star specific food but having time trying three dishes feel little bad giving experience two star    didn't care hyper large menu unfocused yep thank Susie Q nailing     Service waitress 2 also bus person other hand 5!  He kept accountable when she wouldn't check us   We crepes dinner crepe which name can't recall two dessert crepes berry banana split  dinner crepe said come greens part dish but garnish featured ingredient  salty masked subtler tastes many ingredients  berry crepe single one excellent but small serving price larger banana okay but don't expect crepe tasting treat because more generous filling overwhelmed single crepe  whole single crepe thing mystifying  If going generous filling provide more crepe  cheap part remember? serving Fajitas getting tortilla    Wouldn't again $66 bill small not great meal gamble elsewhere    Don't miss real Sugar Factory candy shop next door!! <EOR> I ate 3 times while staying Paris Hotel Vegas  Twice breakfast once late night dessert chocolate lounge   Everything delightfully delicious  First time 4 cheese omelet hasbrowns rye toast big cup coffee  Perfect scrumptious  Dining companions waffles chocolate chunks whip cream berries top  Delicious fun  Dessert breakfast!

Set upscale diner ambiance fun service good  started off fried macaroni balls delicious but only came three table  much debate entree choice settled bleu burger which delicious juicy huge  ate every bite well worth it  dessert cookies sundae which good though wish more ice cream less whip cream  Overall would recommend place but prepared large bill even if don't order alcohol  <EOR> This review going short guessed sweet   If you're walking Las Vegas strip morning basking afterglow night fun partying come non traditional breakfast   Located right next Paris hotel Sugar Factory candy shop bakery little restaurant café all one   Julius walked curiosity when huge Reese's Peanut Butter Cupcake stopped dead tracks   headed bar where enjoyed breakfast consisting selections 2 major food groups alcohol dessert lol  Pommery Pop Mimosa a cute split bottle top line champagne OJ Reese's cupcake coveting   Unfortunately despite little chunk Reese's crushed Reese's Pieces adorning huge swirl frosting cupcake little bland dry did taste Reese's all   Julius just beer liked subtleness flavor though  if you're called Sugar Factory give bouncing off walls sugar!  think just ordered mediocre cupcake while woman next devoured Red Velvet   based dish alone dock Sugar Factory couple stars    Pop champagne biz though! <EOR> I hearing place quite some time now   how great desserts all celebrity sightings   Since family town decided give try     We great server   believe name Heather   She very attentive friendly   ordered various sandwiches pasta dishes   All dishes ordered pretty good phenomenal but pretty good   Yup tend try another's food   ordered fluffer nutter milkshake which enjoyed thorougly   extremely thick   tasted more peanut butter then fluff   would say fluff better     We perused candy store well   couture lollipops pretty look but $25 dollars decided pass     I'm pretty sure come back need constant sweets sweet tooth   Plus place open very late  <EOR> I start saying expectations low  Let continue saying thank goodness  food ok good great just palatable  But here's where problem really lies   the service lack thereof  large staff running around sure  quite few issues but let ask this   How eat huge open faced tuna melt no fork knife tried but   no napkins? constantly flag down someone service basics  visit but two  Yep they're open late we're suckers punishment  understand you're new you're working kinks but Roland much your apologies overflowing kind couldn't more insincere though smiled politely urge roll your eyes barely repressed  realize crisis management opening hard handle but  why you're manager  Breathe deeply your s   t together  <EOR> Good idea nice concept probably bad business   Review restaurant part TERRIBLE SERVICE Kitchen cannot keep servers much handle  Plan being long time ready send back food hot drinks being cold not even lukewarm  Food big meh but whole experience bad especially sugar high  It basically caters simple sweet tooths creative way  <EOR> My disclaimer before review Wednesday 11 00 am   If want pay atmosphere rather food then place you  Overall everything place trendy chic except staff's attitude which bit casual  bus boy came over place set some glasses he actually told glasses  Thank you    Breakfast served eleven  crepes listed menu sounded delicious but turn lunch menu  Sandwiches salads some hamburgers  patty melt eatable but bread meat ratio size quarter sitting saucer  extras added onto listed menu's description    I did delight desserts specialty drinks much meal themselves however think where should spend your money if decided walk into place  <EOR> This place feels upscale soda fountain ice cream shoppe Cheesecake Factory like menu   Service bit slow initially   took awhile someone come over take drink orders but fine because menu pages pages long took awhile decide wanted   Service good initial lag  Btw came Friday night 1 a m  75% full when arrived most tables taken soon there  I ended ordering Pasta Carbonara absolutely loved it!  drink cocktail called Grape Crush   Though bit watered down very sweet tasted just candy enjoyed it   tried dining companion's fluffer nutter milkshake sweet rich thick creamy strong fluffer nutter taste other words delicious!!  table inside right patio great spot taking view Strip people watching   Overall really satisfied experience would definitely come back again!
