In Bay Area noticed surge Korean Tofu restaurants popping up   those around awhile appeared getting new surge customers   damn curious see hype all restaurant named Tofu Hut figure would satisfy curiosity   actually passed another Korean restaurant first new complete Grand Opening sign up   figure we'd try Tofu Hut since Vegas awhile lasted   Usually sign business must doing alright right?  Wrong   So first mistake assuming because Vegas awhile would decent   second mistake made checking Yelp first see if anyone anything restaurant   If done first would seen TWO 1 star reviews no other good reviews counteract two   If done research first would seen eating here   Walking early Sunday evening dinner party four chose cooking table plan cook some serious meat   Instead ordered Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup $8 36 two orders Short Ribs BBQ $12 59 each Kimchee Pot Stew $8 95    If want table barbecue minimum two orders that   They brought side salad each person start then five banchan side dishes share   yes said five   thought joke April Fools' Day haha kind joke   No   know some Korean restaurants give more banchan Koreans even asked more said  all had  thought being gypped looked over neighboring table six Koreans see if more did   No did not   Tofu Hut only gives five banchan!  Blah!  coleslaw concoction never seen before cabbage kimchee fishcake bean sprouts cucumbers   used getting 5 10 banchans imagine shock disappointment!  When tofu soup pot stew arrived waitress asked if she wanted crack fresh egg there   Sure!  she passed over hot tofu soup she knocked over BF's water glass   No big deal she apologized cleaned up  I just glad she didn't drop hot soup too! tofu spicy more mild   wasn't much taste going less impressed   did hot stone burnt rice comes tofu soup though   friend's pot stew more soup like she cared well   only thing really good Short Ribs   ended ordering another plate because pretty good   Everything else fell below par     To close meal check came   asked if shikhye which cold beverage usually served end meal   refreshing greasy meal used getting automatically meal concludes Korean restaurants   told did this   Oh goodness   Five banchans no shikhye?!    Final bill $70 including tip tax   This restaurant sparse   Lots Koreans eating but perhaps just higher expectations Tofu Hut doesn't cut it  <EOR> The food used pretty descent here   However quality declined prices higher   Service always friendly when there   isn't much banchan side dishes probably wouldn't anything other SoonTofu soups   Still place  supposed specialize  Tofu Soup isn't great should be   plenty better places go  <EOR>
