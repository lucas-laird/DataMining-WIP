We're big fans Capriottis always excellent service location  personal faves Bobbie SlawBeJo  If haven't give them try highly suggest do  Also phone ahead save yourself little bit wait time  <EOR> Great food great service  place want eat but can  more take place   The Italian Capistromi sub favorite  <EOR> This store run CHARM  dreamed years perfect turkey stuffing sammie could ask ANYTHING more having served such amazing people  Everyone works really understands business should run  friendly smiles playful attitudes place just great vibes  Don't forget leave guys some BEEEEER money! haa! Oh yes! <EOR> Capriottis those chains can't help but like  still kept character homemade feel among most sandwich places where your food comes premeasured pre prepared food box ready assemble max fast food capacity  Sure wait bit specially since place seems always busy but 5 minutes extra wait all bad good sandwich?   I also never take polite friendly service granted  somehow ended Capriotti's twice odd considering live NW rarely ever down way but each time someone counter smile wishing great day  tip jar seems always filled dollars see why! course add Washington into jar  Maybe positive vibes world wanted turkey sandwich smile today    Oh waiting Cole Turkey saw put Michael Jena's review wall among other accomplishments  see some pride good work    Keep <EOR>
