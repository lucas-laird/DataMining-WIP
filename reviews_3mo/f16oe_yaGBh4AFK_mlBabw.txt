Blah    really don't know why keep going Panda  Maybe its undying love chinese food? Maybe its because its quick convenient? Maybe crazy?  Still yet anything more average experience any Panda Express location yet keep going  But need feed cravings chinese food between jobs quickest easiest way without dropping much money strip   Food never seems hot its average tasting best  Yesterday usual 2 item combo  time ordered chow mein side chicken green beans option 1 beef broccoli option 2  chicken green beans flavorful but hot enough  beef good but broccoli terrible   Pluses location its easily accessible right across street Mandalay Bay  Its clean lady behind counter nice gave good size portions  Plenty seating indoors out   Wish could say wouldn't back but sometimes do  Chinese food why love much?! <EOR>
