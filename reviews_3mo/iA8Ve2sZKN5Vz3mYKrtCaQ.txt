I used place   remember first time came New Year's Eve food excellent   service   server even let friend take home bottle special plum sauce because he liked much   However both food service gotten worse worse now never want eat again   First realized put MSG food unless tell them to   Wha?  Should flavorful spicy Thai food need MSG?  labels itself healthy vegetarian friendly place   service poor takes forever your food when invariably disappointed     Last time ordered Vegetarian Pad Si Ew normally favorite Thai dish   love Chinese broccoli yummy sauce    Figured since vegetarian dish would probably tofu protein right?  Wrong!  no protein except few small beans   also made American broccoli sauce tasted weird   tasted MSG even though requested none   The atmosphere restaurant also quite weird   located Commercial Center within walking distance Lotus Siam    just instead! <EOR> This far best Thai resaurant found valley    I place family operated  always during lunch when its near empty waited hand foot  waitstaff talks we're friends customers    We always order panang  panang friend puts die for  She gets chicken panang tofu panang  way all you're really going sauce  day we'll grow balls just ask panang sauce couple straws    We also order tom yum start nam tok beef salad standard green curry sticky rice  Green curry favorite Thai dish ever but Komol's pretty lackluster  But everything else always really good  friend told you're supposed little balls sticky rice sop juices    The last time pushing Moonstone Coconut Lemongrass sake  sell $7 50 half bottle  tastes mostly coconut milk + nigori sake  lemongrass caught more aromatically end taste  really good    Komol located Commercial Center sparsely populated small businesses including Asian Korean market  some dessert mochi   * off strip non casino <EOR>
