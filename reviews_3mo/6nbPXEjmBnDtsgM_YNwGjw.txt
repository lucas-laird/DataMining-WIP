Broke da mouth      <EOR> Small shop 7 tables sat 4   Tried Loco Moco eggs over easy egg oozed yolk other little over done but no matter brown sauce portion size made it   almost dropped container because heavy food   Also ordered Avo Poke again good quality fish   Recommend freshness food  <EOR> I expected really mindblowing experience all hype around original location positive comparisons drawn between two but Eastern outpost restaurant lands merely really good category   Island Flavor Express Regal Colonnade plaza Eastern Pebble very clearly Hawaiian restaurant given all depictions islands reggae ska music typical plate lunch menu options  also offer varying specials some desserts although desserts seemed run waning evening hours  decor very simple but doesn't detract experience  sure walk far end counter place order but feel free sit down if you're taking to go  They'll bring food your counter or table if you've picked table    I ordered mixed plate $11 25 Furikake Chicken Kalbi Short Ribs +$1 00 particular meat   presented foam to go box even if you're dining in  favorite part actually macaroni salad which salted good way creamy you'd expect  chicken kinda KFC Gen Korean BBQ not so good way  more dry stringy texture moist natural chicken texture furikake didn't stand much sweet glaze did  Sriracha saved day though bestowing little extra sweetness along much needed acidity heat  don't having add condiment something stand but very glad option   As other parts dish white rice cooked perfectly kalbi great rendition tender beef nice touch ginger some charring  little fatty side but let's remember fat = flavor which proven case  Actually muted sweetness when eat something sweet Furikake Chicken but able taste full flavor when dove into leftovers  If mixed plate again kalbi probably something pork dish  sweet   My friend shared spam musubi $2 me  nice sized portion but rice ratio bit high me  Also seaweed little mushy which friend pointed may side effect heat lamp  Although interesting seasonings herbs Island Flavor's version prefer Ross J's rendition which sure prepped order   I also tried friend's oxtail soup $10 which actually comes real bowl if you're dining in  Unfortunately can't compare renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup hotel downtown because yet try it but version tasted well seasoned meaty  vegetables welcome sight but watch not so edible ginger inedible bay leaf  I'd consider ordering again especially now we're getting soup weather daily although might to go order otherwise bring own soup spoon avoid dealing inadequate plastic spoons   Given food reportedly much same OG Island Flavor wasn't quite impressed I'd hoped  certainly enjoyed having plenty leftovers huge portions definitely come back try other proteins specials pork chops w mushrooms onions anyone? but expected experience something sublime other music  Maybe find future  <EOR> Can't better this  Food exactly point  When order Hawaiian supposed certain way way supposed be   They pile food on  funny because reviewed another Hawaiian place long ago complained portions big  Well big difference give lot delicious food unlike other place gives bunch nasty food   Kalbi very good  give plenty  Ahi poke fresh delicious  Furikake chicken really good flavor   I'm regular now  weekly sure  <EOR> Great authentic Hawaiian food  Tried Loco Moco Hawaiian Style Roast Pork  Portions very generous price  Most food under $10  Finished off Chantilly Guava Cake  Very good!!! Just island  definitely back more place highly recommended! <EOR> I haven't written review awhile   but felt obligated trying Island Flavor first time  Located right off 215 Eastern Regal Plaza right next PT's the old Roadrunner bar those remember place   heard good things Hawaiian excuse big island style plate lunch spot  day off thought would give go     First off very small place maybe 5 bistro style table seating side kitchen other side  Love Hawaiian Reggae music selection playing does anyone still call Jahwaiian?   Decor would expect pictures Hawaiian flowers foliage representation all islands wall   but hey decor foods   They small specialized menu daily specials board all sounded good me    but opted mix plate w Furikake Chicken everyone's raving Roast Pork gravy $11 25   Ordered go   when chef called name handed plate lunch bagged he gave those what's bruddah chin nods  he knew deliciousness store for  grabbed bag food swear thing weighed least 5 lbs ! He noticed surprised look face smiled mustered thanks bruddah headed home   In anticipation popped open styrofoam container and   boom! Huge mean HUGE portion chicken think might've actually gasped   unbelievers see photo    Now know all hype Furikake Chicken super ono  Crunchy fried chicken nuggets love rolled honey sweet sauce salty seaweed bonito flakes sesame seeds   sweet savory likes it  If reminisce would say kinda reminded Tasty Chicken serve Alley Aiea Bowl Hawaii if you're Aiea know talking   Roast Pork tender juicy just fell apart dug into it  Good gravy! gravy good   and Mac salad legit  think audible oh god good! nom nomming away   So yeah   that happened  delicious but couldn't finish it   leftovers yay! Island Flavor thumbs shakas!!! definitely back maybe give fifth star <EOR> This new go to when am town business   Being Hawaii living Houston coming Vegas area serves purpose Hawaiian grinds   lot Hawaiian places take AmEx which fine but would rather use company card when road   deal maker breaker but instantly gives them least half star purposes   The food ono!  Last night ordered mixed plate katsu kalbi   mac salad legit   chicken katsu moist which rare thin cut that   kalbi delicious!  rice perfectly cooked   best Hawaiian food since leaving Pearl City   The decor nothing fancy    should be   Jawaiian music playing   people nice take time learn names customers   place just feels home   I am going back lunch today since leave tomorrow   place definitely must eat list whenever am town   Mahalo!! <EOR> Love place  Best local food far since 5+ years lived Vegas!!!
