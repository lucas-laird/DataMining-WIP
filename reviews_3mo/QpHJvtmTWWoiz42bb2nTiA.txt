Flow Rider New Truck Town pretty solid menu offering burgers hotdogs sandwiches   The first thing notice Flowrider Portions let's just say they're BIG every order includes fries drink   The menu pretty expansive D Porker which best summed deli exploded ended bun D Porker includes Fried pork beef bacon ham sliced hot dog beans egg muenster cheese lettuce tomato avocado served grill french bread   It huge sandwich camera phone doesn't work unable snap photo but trust impressive!  The fries rather forgettable but nice included along drink other trucks la carte price add quickly   My friend 12 Loco Dog which includes 12 beef dog wrapped bacon grill onions jalapeno relish special sauce guacamole grill bun  He said really good little messy but good   I liked Flowrider still few kinks work but given time could become contender vegas food truck crown   Ok   here's few complaints work improving getting 4 5 stars next visit   1 fries weak under seasoned little soggy rather blah  may just gotten bad batch but pretty forgettable   2 Toppings point when reach overkill when sandwich more 10 items might going little overboard all ingredients Porker great but lost when mixed all together actually dissected second half ate piece piece all meats amazing but may little overkill   3 Location know finding places hard when start place ton traffic rainbow russel parking ok hospital lot across street but no tables benches grassy areas anywhere sit don't mind eating car but if group people want eat little hard   4 Your Hours know you're new still getting things worked but being open 3 hours day 11a 2p enough time people chance try your grub  really think your portions prices would better late night truck lunch truck could corner post bar greasy food market if found right location word out!!!  I give flowrider truck few more tries hopefully earn few more stars more quality trucks town gets better!!! <EOR> My BF just left home getting call him  Uhoh    Nothing worry he just letting know he saw Flowrider right house  He knows love food trucks even way before cool curbside  Gotta love thoughtful man    I grabbed Philly Rider which Beef  grilled onions mushrooms green red peppers topped melted cheese lettuce tomatoes jalapenos 9 grill french roll  Comes fries choice bottled drinks the usual sodas water some Jaritos $10     Wowwweee huge sandwich  grabbed fork work definitely think should stock lot fork knives! LOL liked sandwich lot thought flavors work well  Philly cheesesteaks but cheesesteak person because gets dense rich just whole lot meat cheese going on  take because crisp lettuce gives crunchy texture tomatoes jalapenos lightens flavors bit  might stating blasphemy some right now saying probably philly over Pops  Pops good but damn rich always share sandwich other sides another sandwich break dense flavors    ate good amount fries first thought lightly crispy good  weren't seasoned but apparently before put seasoning some people thought much they're trying without  added packet salt where want it  Since sitting most under sandwich think  really where pose problem losing its crispness since weight sandwich it   The ingredients fresh quality weren't skimping quality big quantities  Some options wild D Porker but think lot people into some other offerings  always strip down if you're topping person    Theres also some mini options smaller appetites really nothing stopping anyone share some these  maybe 3rd food before take to go eat little later    As eating talking crew food truck culture randomness bit themselves  Apparently they're new foodtrucks ran taco truck construction sites 2 years gone new route into culture   When comes business personable people long way  no secret where food good but frequent places where staff owners people feel ease feel eating relatives house  fact Pelon reminds  Tios   very comfortable talking Gigi runs orders Flaco  Pelon manning line  normally never let businesses know Yelp Yelper but really easy talk them very receptive wanting know people think done better  also rarely give suggestions while business since never want put mouth where don't belong cause tension but since receptive threw some ideas might help putting fries paper bag side maybe leaving french fry seasoning people season liking  Maybe see some locations where people sit curbside some grass since lot really rocky I suggested check Centennial Hills Park Library YMCA area   really want see truck succeed    After reading Chris M s review see where he's going night time venue  Don't wrong would eat lunch but just late night person just woke threw clothes 1 30pm catch them 3hour slot they're day  few longer days maybe day where late night might bring more customers  late night honker sandwich end night    hell yes would lovely  Fuku does they're always crowd  Perfect nightcap dinner often times night owls drunk food stoner food    and  downer comment coming high compliment since usually want lot things while altered state but same time very oddly picky would eat  would good First Friday those Thristy Thursdays bar crawls    I think them being open only week doing good  Every truck  doing well work kinks out   see some promise hope well  Since used taco truck try tacos next Super Tacation   Once more into Flow into following Rider  <EOR> Due incurable desire try all food trucks Vegas stop  Flow Rider truck since far where live  Flow rider truck's design interesting can't see pictures but background strip along its sin city theme   First off would say portions puts pretty much everything shame  thinking along sin city theme giant proportions good but can't help  Food range anywhere $4 50 $20  $20 item huge burger 8 sirloin patties many other things    Anyways only ordered two lunch specials mini loco dog mini hydrolic but man $4 50 regret touching subway  believe four specials which mini versions regular menu comes McDonald's medium size fries 20 oz soda great lunch deal if ask me   diet friendly food but only live once  Moving mini loco dog which 6 inches its California street dog giant proportions  huge beef dog wrapped bacon top avocado lightly grilled onions relish some kind sauce maybe parsley jalapeños?
