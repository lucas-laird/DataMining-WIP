This newest Blueberry Hill  opened little over week ago corner Flamingo Decatur replaced used Marie Callender's    They didn't change much far interior decor but am glad quote while location being vacant new restaurant area  Even better new breakfast spot    On occasion mom stuck dinner menu several grand opening specials going now  opted dinner entrees received free dessert  menu huge long time perusing decided honey coconut chicken side fries green beans  canned veggies avoided green beans but enjoyed rest meal  chicken moist overly sweet expecting  mom enjoyed pork chops dessert ordered carrot cake mom blueberry pie  She enjoyed but felt mine little dry taste  took home fella enjoyed quite bit more acquired taste   I'm usually fan chain's breakfasts back that  also enormous assortment desserts choose all made house    The food nothing amazing but solid location lot nicer others town  <EOR> Although restaurant very clean decent service very pricey some mediocre food bland hot chocolate  We couple friends ordered three fruit crepes warm compote chicken fettuccine chicken fried steak    Crepes Weren't satisfied artificial flavored syrup coloring   Chicken Fettuccine Chicken lacking seasoning very tasteful   We don't believe would return back near future  <EOR> This place nothing decatur  Decatur great because history  environment food great  wedding going night went  Overall good experience  <EOR> Food delicious! Portions big  Everything place amazing  really looks taste everything freshly made  <EOR> Ate few hours ago wanted try location first time since used Charleston Decatur location which frequent when can  Anyhow first impression location alot bigger then other location love design also alot more add menu compared other location food just good other location same big portions same exact price only negative potatoes some cooked others real raw point where couldn't eat anymore but  only grip food delicious still full 10 30 am now 1 24 pm lol  service lady didn't check much she did she didn't offer knife fork spoon she nice but just wish she checked more then she did other then those major gripes think might come back again  <EOR> The food good  Sadly kind service drags down food worth it  hard refills twice having asked salad does come until food arrives  said food good but service desperately needs some work  <EOR> Food pretty good but service received horrible server clear order did verify order when placed received something changed mind reason 3 stars  Bad first experience <EOR> Another great Breakfast  Portions huge! Order breakfast enough lunch dinner <EOR> I took mom location since eaten yet little group hungry  Upon arrival awe great  Still reminds lot MC before took over but still clean  Very Clean  seated booth comfy told waiter would arrive shortly  Shortly must ment 15 minutes because busser coffee came several times before water showed up   Now waiter Josh young kid  But boy did face read disdain when he arrived table  ordered right away  mother ordered piece blueberry pie ordered Bonanza 5 year old ordered kids mac'n'cheese fries    Then played waiting game  Which actually didn't take long all  mom received pie right away  Somewhat disappointment because figured all found would arrive together  Then came other meals  really wish taken pictures food  scrambled eggs little runny side  two pieces bacon somewhat burnt  my daughter actually ate those mac'n'cheese though burnt noodles cheese whatever was  She took bite almost threw table  Now she's picky kid tried it     She wasn't lying  thick creamy tasted burnt whatever  does she do? town fries I really don't blame eating it   So comes Josh oh Josh he asks everything daughter immediately replies gross! which then turn tell when he reached plate asked leave because she eating fries   Fast Forward Check time  JOSH DIDN'T REMOVE MAC'N'CHEESE BILL!

Honestly angry paid left  returning suggest  only reason giving stars because other two meals delicious  <EOR> The food alright eggs cooked all way but biscuits gravy great  however service terrible late food drinks halfway through meal wrong drinks  would never come place again thanks service  <EOR> I love new location much  The only reason don't location decatur Charleston workers always rush don't really care job  new location workers super nice look clean if any sense   never know order asked waiter she recommends only knew wasn't pancakes she suggested potato pancakes  first thought yea sure lets see goes  mother always orders same thing fresh fruit creeps     When order came pancakes look hash brown  knew going because love anything made potato  But pancakes where amazing  tried Apple sauce cream cheese  But enjoyed maple syrup  hash brown but sweeter  order only now on    I love cleanliness  restaurant looks feel house   pies look amazing entrance  <EOR> Don't waste your time money better meal found burger king next door  sister sent back turkey dinner because smelled disgusting unhealthy  chicken salad completely flavorless but maybe could tasted if put more tablespoon chicken salad bread  Although little bit tasted clean water  chili total garbage   it advertised meat beans coli but yet find meat  Needless say recommend eating someplace else <EOR> I really enjoyed experience location closer condo  visited Christmas night each ordered Holiday special    I ordered classic turkey dinner which $12 99 complete turkey dinner which included soup salad drink any dessert! sage stuffing delicious gravy tasty! really packed turkey which tender along stuffing mashed taters corn   My guest ordered cherry glazed Ham dinner which included soup salad drink any dessert $12 99   This lot food both meals delicious!
