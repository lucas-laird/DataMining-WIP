A Torta Ahogada last culinary gems become exposed yet  Perhaps good reason it provenance Guadalaraja Mexico place origin having done business enough years genuinely believe history even other parts Mexico easy find  But starting see sandwich show some Las Vegas menus give shout out El Birotazo making best found far   Torta Ahogada literally means drowned sandwich   Roast pork salty bollilo the latter preferrably just bit stale dipped into spicy chile arbol based sauce  Add some pickled onions squeeze lime  fantastic combination if meat roasted properly bread sturdy enough little staying power especially if eaten cart Guadalaraja    El Birotazo does right  owners Guadalajara take lot pride product  Generous meat bread crusty just enough oomph two thirds way through before collapses  But no problem serve shallow plate spoon enjoy last drop  rest small menu clue all trips sandwich difficult think taking any other direction  <EOR>
