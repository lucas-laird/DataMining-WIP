I experience Strip House first time past week while SEMA show Las Vegas   restaurant quaint dimly lit well suited rambunctious group   Limited seating ample wait staff made evenings service flow quite well   Groups gathered large round tops while couples ca noodled overstuffed booths along walls   The food impeccable wine list complete while still showing some great hidden finds try Flora Springs Trilogy!    The front part restaurant housed large bar but never wait new Planet Hollywood Casino formerly Aladdin seemed somewhat quiet making good chance seating without reservation  <EOR> Strip House relatively new LV Planet Hollywood simply outstanding   Decor intimate red hollywood chic   new sommelier Nancy Pietras did outstanding job selecting wine dinner   Paul Hobbs Cab inspired choice really made meal     Food outstanding   Fillet's hot perfectly cooked wonderfully spiced served full head roasted garlic   Wow   Can't wrong goose fat fried potatoes 12 layer chocolate cake wrapped things perfectly   Definately better Nine significantly better Craftsteak neck neck Del Frisco's best steak dinner Las Vegas  <EOR>
