Bland Boring BUT Cheap  $9 99 per person   Smallest buffet ever seen  Very limited selection dessert selection WORST   Nothing special the pictures tell ALL   Service fast friendly but didn't food   I won't back unless FREE  <EOR> Ok absolutely terrible but pretty bad  Came Thursday night   seafood night  eaten quite few buffets but pretty sad  if truck stop middle desert decided specialize seafood  Deep fried stuff just tasted batter non deep fried items quite chewy some items slight funky smell  totally inedible but most joyous culinary experience   Seafood pallea bizarre  Now know where all uneaten crab legs they've recycled into stew can't recycled anymore  Also ventilation place pretty bad constantly smells smoke unless you're sitting near food  All $17 change  Pretty lousy deal  Well name pretty good indicator  <EOR>
