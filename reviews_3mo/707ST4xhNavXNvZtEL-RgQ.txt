I've big fan original Windy City Beef N Dogs location Lake Mead since its first week  thrilled welcome second location added bonus even closer home  new space next Boodles Lounge  They'll keeping later hours original location hours 11am 9pm daily but intend keep grill going long hungry folks feed  potential great late night grub   No matter hour food just well done over Lake Mead  Italian beef Chicago dogs still top notch they've added additional menu items gyro corned beef ruben pizza puff combo   Now two locations taste Chicago easier ever had  <EOR>
