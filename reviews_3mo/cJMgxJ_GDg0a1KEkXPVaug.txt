Don't wrong restaurant did decently good Italian food   family spaghetti meatballs chicken parm alfredo   All which enjoyed but nothing merit exorbitant prices dishes   reason why am giving only two stars because over priced!  Pretty much around 20 bucks meal   and even audacity put menu required minimum $15 person even if split plate!  Kids meals 10 12 dollars also!  Just ridiculous   I could see paying maybe down strip but Southern Highlands?  top didn't even offer refills bread   no way I'd back those prices  <EOR> Can give 0 stars?  I walked family dinner having just moved Vegas Southern Highlands   Very small place noticed probably owner older man greeting seating server nicely dressed cook *cough* definately Italian   furnishings ok atmosphere passable   Now fun begins   sit down crack menu open see all entrees 19 24 bucks even Chicken breast vegetables   Ok fine dining pay but prices did seem justified based location ambiance really didn't feel $100+ meal three politely stood said changed mind  EXPENSIVE HUH??? exclaims older man   Wow   feeling based statement quite few walkouts   just quietly ignored statement proceeded door  CUT BREAD NOTHING!!!! he exclaims again   Now worked many restaurants thing sure ever cared cutting bread table getting used later     Anyway terrible experience never ever again felt really embarrassed mother nephew subjected such rudeness  <EOR> I live California but frequent Las Vegas area because family   am always search great italian food   family received coupon mail 1 2 price entree purchase regular priced entree online read other reviews posted Nicolos Cucina Italiana  Based food reviews decided last night try oursleves   When arrived greeted Nicolo himself made feel very welcome  asked owner where he because accent he told Sicily   He wife run restaurant them selves Ignazia Nancy Nicolos wife runs kitchen does cooking herself help assistant  italian restaurant should run italians   Thats authentic   From moment seated given basket fresh bread which never left empty drink always full   ordered calamari fritte appetizer which outstanding!!!  then tried Minestrone soup which best ever had  ordered Chicken Picatta again most amazing picatta found day   When find authentic italian cuisine hospitality wish lived could visit them regularly   portions very generous never leave hungry   owners very friendly enthusiastic attentive   continue visit Nicolos because know never disappointed  <EOR> I planning only write reviews places great  often people quick bad mouth complain but rarely say nice things establishment  using motto if nothing nice say don't say anything all  don't hurt businesses especially now days but disgusted man's behavior say it  especially reading Bryan G 's review he family treated     We live Southern Highlands 2 minute walk plaza restaurant located  eat ALOT stay close home  excited restaurant opening! soon opened boyfriend menu bring he wanted try food early tell it  He figured glass wine order pizza appetizer try entree  Well he asked gentlemen find later owner the same exact man Bryan G  talking believe Heather L  said welcoming she definitely different experience maybe he's changed anyway he asked if pizza man said PIZZA???!! made snobby sound again said PIZZA???!! NO!! guess pizza comment offended he felt  pizza beneath establishment    I am sorry many fine Italian restaurants pizza therefore don't understand behavior  rude unwelcoming  back many good restaurants better service atmosphere 20 some dollars entree don't need treated that  don't mind spending good food but service come close reviews food exciting  <EOR>
