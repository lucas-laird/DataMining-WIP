Meh  experienced better  MUCH BETTER   The Wing Stop chain decided branch try SPORTS version original place     I understand second day but decided overwhelm anyone sat bar   Yes everyone pleasant  But fine line having 5 yes five people waiting good customer service  Every time turned hubby started say something someone new asking question   It felt getting ready tell did enough FLAIR on   Anyway    The chicken I ordered three piece boneless plain  Sounds boring but spice hubby does not   They hand batter here  more country buttermilk recipe without black pepper part  boneless location large chicken strips  tasted them see pics good   The sauces The garlic parm sauce disgusting  taste mayo paste shake parm knows mixed into chunky glue   My hand immediately five helper guys flew rescue  explained taste spoiled asked Teriyaki  kinda tasted ok  Just really thick syrup sweet soy sauce  I ordered regular hot sauce  ok  just right amount kick but much vinegar  seemed little watery but least thick   The fries Standard fresh cut fries  don't remember salt pepper being them  salt fan would remember   Carrots celery For 99 cents pay them actually ten pieces each which seems odd lol   Sooo   I understand sports bar concept idea going but picked horrible parking lot  It's Best Buys parking lot   understand all employees need trained but 20+ all during day we lunch two tables filled ?   PS guys   I don't know which one   rang order under Carry Out   thus machine gave no spot place tip when used card  Odd   We won't back  Don't really care all FLAIR  food nothing write home about  <EOR> Stopped try different menu because WingStop Sports   New Vegas market disappointed   grilled chicken club delicious along lemon pepper fries   really impressive staff continues sure your having great experience   You'll never anything   Sports Wings Alcohol Great service nuff said  <EOR> Very nice people! driving down Maryland saw place just opened  ordered Louisana Rub 6 piece  Very tasty!
