We retired gone McDonald's since built two blocks house   last year gone down hill   things often week week     The service become poor   Some long time employees good but bad now outweighs good location   The street people hitting drive through inside but managers nothing them   Talked owner he said he would see thing better but did not     all years decided no longer need McDonald's three months   ten grandkids missing either   Poor service cost them lot when think over years  <EOR>
