Today another those busy Saturday mornings where short time  husband decided eat Bagel Cafe whim because close home  wasn't impressed    I more upset anything because food mediocre price  paid $23 00 Grilled Cheese Sandwich w fries Chicken Salad Sandwich w Potato Salad 1 Coke 1 hot Chocolate    I ordered Grilled Cheese tomato which charged 85 cents extra add order  tomato kept slipping sandwich  better Grilled Cheese Jack Box $1 29  Jack Box's bread nice     toasty buttery  sandwich soggy messy  also tomato free Jack Box!   I jealous husband's Chicken Salad Sandwich because looked really good  When he let try bite found bland  Potato Salad also tasteless    I hate writing bad reviews end positive note   the Hot Chocolate delicious  tasted hint Cinnamon it  <EOR> I Bagel Cafe few times now think A OK!    Good option bite eat when looking something quicker sit down restaurants Red Rock something better food court   Like Ken M  Philly chicken however sandwich dripping oil fries crispy delicious   staff seems friendly everything made order   also seen club chicken fingers few others   Everything good     Now let's crazy   wouldn't order EVERYTHING off menu   C'mon folks its grill next sports book    still advise making your choices wisely   Maybe avoid tongue chopped chicken liver sandwich?  just saying       bag baby   all things ordered haven't anything bad   I say when want quick bite for lunch breakfast even snack stop Bagel Cafe  Order smart keep your expectations check enjoy your grill food!  Then back gambling! <EOR>
