after hearing 3 people talk place check out   disappointed   even major workout   always hungry workout   anything taste good   dunno living Austin just 4 years made snob   dunno but disappointed   pricey place   two meat combo rib tips 2 sausages + corn bread + 2  sides   sausage good firm sweet tangy classic crunch when bite into it   rib tips just thick pieces brisket   dry hard no fat seem more moist other sauce   wasn't rib tips Famous Daves   also sauce no spicy kick all   sides fried okra which dry just weirdly off   maybe much batter   macaroni cheese ok spectacular but think kraft cheese macaroni way better   good thing big cups ooh sweet tea   sad bbq need back famous daves it   maybe weekend  <EOR> I am always looking great barbecue which why excited when friend told T  C 's Rib Crib   name alone sounded authentic enough   She said she loves place because ribs oh fall off the bone good   couldn't wait try it!  small place located strip mall corner DI Durango thought some good barbecue quite possibly some great ribs!  Upon entering noticed smell   not smell sticky smoky barbecue but generic smell all purpose cleaner   No biggie thought least place clean!  order photocopied pink paper menu excited see serve Kool Aid beverages  Now  authentic! thought   even more excited   ordered full rack baby backs order brisket pulled pork fried okra beans greens donut bread pudding  Hey hungry planning taking most home!  What disappointment   ribs barbecued   no smoke flavor no smoke ring   Ditto brisket   Ditto pulled pork   Yes all meat tender but tasted boiled meat slathered sauce   beans were   well beans   greens almost salty eat   donut bread pudding crusty stale around edges tasted couple days old   best thing fried okra Kool Aid   The employees cheerfully nice restrooms immaculate food edible but enjoyable   never willingly back   If am forced just fried okra Kool Aid   But don't let strong opinion stop trying yourself   just might friend does   But before consider going T  C 's Rib Crib would recommend consider following Do love flavor tenderness meats slowly smoked hours low temperatures?  If don't T  C 's Rib Crib! Do your barbecue taste made boiling and or pressure cooking meat until tender slathering barbeque sauce over slapping grill few times caramelize sauce?  If all means T  C 's Rib Crib blast! <EOR>
