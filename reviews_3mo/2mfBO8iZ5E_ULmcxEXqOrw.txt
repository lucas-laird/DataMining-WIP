I dined first weekend Aria opened public  space beautiful you'd expect restaurant Light Group tasteful blend chrome leather wood  Even Nambe flatware striking  Just Fix restaurant opens casino but never feel you're casino  restaurant seats I'm guessing 300 people ton staff running around we counted least 30 people floor     The food alone would earn restaurant 4 5 stars  losing half star terrible value $10 individual sized sides $5 drop sauce!!!   only thing table didn't gratin potato side  potatoes undercooked cheese top overcooked dish decadent point wasn't enjoyable  said union salad fresh unique beef carpaccio savory treat steaks melt in your mouth delicious  bone in rib eye best steaks enough feed two not starving people  but $58 should  surf turf looked spectacular could feed 3 lighter eaters rather recommended two but again $159 SHOULD giant mass food    Service general genuinely helpful pleasant but pacing meal problem  took over 45 minutes time ordered receive appetizers then another half hour time salad plates cleared time received entrees  point all entrees came same time all sides came runners no clue where anything belonged  don't care party 9 upscale restaurant charging kind money expect service discombobulated whether you've open 3 days 3 years    So would come back? YES  if just work little service kinks fine restaurant  just going wait few months before give Union another try    Side note Management SIGNIFICANTLY compensated experience which greatly appreciated but Yelper good reviews can't bought! <EOR> I am giving Union 5 plus stars!! great restaurant! expected pinch nice silver dollar two but paid for    The Place The decor place surely high end!! Dark rich woods silver accents  Nambe silverware nice touch  leather place mats brings whole table together  Since Light Group does present itself very high end lounge feel it  cheap decorating place    The Service The service unnatural times  hostess did try conversation but seemed more force  fact lot personnel did too  rather them try great service then blow off  spend money elsewhere  Vegas far many choices  catered 5 people  1 head server excellent he DC appeared lot high end serving experience then another server three assistance  never once needed ask anything  type service expect average entree price 50 00   The Food Drinks We few martinis 14 00  Samba Smash awesome but fresh fruit mud made impossible drink cocktail straw  also Calm before Storm awesome too   We shared Hamachi Wontons Yellow Tail Crunch serving small 5 little pieces deep fried pepper top off   For main dishes Jennifer Sea Bass which soft flaky cooked perfectly  am Red Meat binge lately opted Organic Chicken  unique dry unique hint sea salt   We shared side Brussels Sprouts generous portions   Dessert skipped dessert Union headed over Jean Phillipe    Drinks 14 00  Sides 9 00  Entrees 40 00 50 00 avg unless want lobster Dessert 12 00   Overall  back sure  previous review must worked lot opening kinks because food prep time serving time perfect  fact even staged silverware each plating    Cons Seriously 5 00 sauce your 50 00 steak??? Really??   If FIX Bellagio STACK Mirage Union <EOR> I'm giving UNION 4 stars because reasons down further but food amazing! Salmon Carpaccio Spicy Yellowtail Crunch Union Signature Crispy Duck great appetizers  entrées Ultimate Surf Turf which 2lb stuffed Maine Lobster 44oz Porterhouse Steak comes 2 sides 2 sauces  cherry bread pudding really good  sure try some signature cocktails Peachy Keen suggested    One thing must say STACK FIX UNION would think LIGHT Group would figure way design restaurant doesn't look all others  also saw some things menu could other restaurants roasted tomato soup grill cheese sandwich unique new addition LIGHT Groups already saturated presence Las Vegas  <EOR> I don't know going Vegas week   Maybe city wide experiment see would happen if famed hospitality Las Vegas ended   forced wait hour reservation   Once cocktail table actually opened ordered drink which should comped but not which ample time finish still wait   then all but kicked cocktail table ordering another drink while still waiting table open up   understand things happen cannot gauge exactly when table empty but when expecting 100 bucks every person seat very least grab them well drink soda if forcing them wait hour bring loaf bread by   convention feet 12 hours day    If incredibly patient don't mind horrible service food absolutely worth price    wish space additional comments takes reservations bottom  <EOR> This good place grab quick bite eat before heading clubs  Service efficient food comes fast! I'd recommend coming appetizers impressed sea bass entree had  veal sliders crab tacos! tuna tartare also delicious but warning those allergies comes lot pine nuts! <EOR>
