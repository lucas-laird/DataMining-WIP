Good Northern quisine  2 tandoori ovens pleasant interior  Watch olives Martina's hot chillis  Surprising casino such international choices  staff okay service fair  important thing food good  <EOR> Omg! wish found restaurant day arrived Vegas!

Now should see decor restaurant spacious luxurious island heart hotel Rio  It's greatly non smoking space   Thank god that! I add review EXTREMLY welcoming warm attention ate details oriented service  everyone restaurant absolute sweetheart  I defently comeback  <EOR> This Gordon's Hell Kitchen experience     I came place felt robbed  over $40 USD per head less average food no favors clueless service they least bill right though    If don't believe am say just see restaurant 95% empty dinner even better dinner experience yourself be sure share =      We made reservation dinner Saturday May 2013 thinking restaurant crowded because its Vegas  checked menu before hand saw fairly expensive offering main courses $25+ vegetarian dishes $15+ reasonable expectations decent meal     When arrived 6 30pm see restaurant basically empty  There's only other table  felt something wrong but then thought may early Vegas people coming yet I wrong!    I debating Okra vs  Veg  Biryani asked waitress kind vegetables Biryani  She said peas   rice peas $19 00? What? even meal? OK ordered Paneer Appetizer Okra Lamb Curry main courses Nan rice which also rice peas but $9 00    The paneer came know shouldn't come  basically dry very little favor  tasted more paper cheese  When waitress came main course she blatantly commented she no idea ordered which dish only 3 tables!    Well could handled saying Lamb?   Obviously its first day  Though admit she doesn't many customers practice skills   The Okra extremely sour  tried very hard eat much don't time another meal due scheduled evening show  think ate may 1 3 Okra  sour dry can't figure whether rotten months someone washed feet Okra  Then tried some Lamb Curry wife's dish  meat tasted more goo source more puree curry just wrong thing  $26 USD small bowl may 10cm diameter not would want any more   rice below average couldn't taste much because sour Okra   Nan OK its only thing didn't mess up   In middle dinner another waitress came beer asked if ordered beer  did three tables time possibly mess up? Getting check really slow but don't care much that    The final bill + tips over $80 00 which most expensive meal Vegas until point worst many years  simply worse some very average Indian cuisine find California  We $130+ meal next day Eiffel Tower Restaurant which reasonably worth it    Finally say place fits exactly into definition Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen highly over priced clueless front house food lack favor above all no customers hemorrhaging cash  If don't major Ramsey over guys just going continue burn money close up     Don't here! some other reviews may decent lunch but am going try   <EOR> Just its name nothing special place  casino its overpriced low quality  no wow factor buffet world's largest  would stick off strip Indian   fast food indian gourmet live entertainment modern deco would worked better  No signature dishes bar small hidden nothing special  would made into bhangara bar fusion tapas  <EOR> Went group friends service wasn't great  Food ok  don't think coming back again  server gave wrong check charged wrong amount money credit card  Didn't refill water tea coke  <EOR> Joined few friends enjoy place   It recently remodeled fresh look  sat towards back where could look pool RIO  Service quick friendly  ordered variety items  enjoyed Tandoori items along Naan  friends some Vegetable Chicken curries raved about   Would love try place again next visit  <EOR> We $14 11AM 4PM Lunch Buffet     We twice before dinner when Gaylord both experiences quite similar nice ambiance good but overpriced food lousy service   excited back same owners new name could major affordable chow down worry service because buffet   Really could possibly wrong?  So are nobody seat us so poke head into dining area someone comes ushers table near empty room   look around WOW design fallout!  Gaylord India Bistro remodel more demodel  once rather upscale attractively appointed space dehabbed cheesy booths tacky over bright chandelier  Oh well moving on     The buffet consisted of Dal Maharani Baingan Pakoras eggplant Aloo Baingan think potato eggplant Palak Paneer Basmati Rice Tandoori Chicken Chicken Tikka Masala Chicken Curry some expired salad   A little heavy chicken eggplant but still OK that   until discovered every chicken dish contender food despair jackpot   commonality all shared Styrofoam taste consistency   worst rice ever debated if old undercooked settling notion probably both   Everything else pretty much sucked well   people starving fill blank would probably choose hunger over buffet      The only plus server kept attentively stocked only palatable things had Garlic Naan water  <EOR> Worst experience ever casino  sister read place Weekly excited go  sister nut allergy issues other local Indian restaurants made sure ask several times nuts did told nothing nuts  soon she took first bite she could tell something wrong  called waitress over asked again nuts took them 10 minutes figure nuts which point already run gift shop emergency Benadryl  server told she could try something else eat only thing buffet nuts she eaten  She clearly sick eat informed staff would leaving  point staff brought bill buffet despite fact plate still full  never again patronize restaurant plan call manager well  <EOR>
