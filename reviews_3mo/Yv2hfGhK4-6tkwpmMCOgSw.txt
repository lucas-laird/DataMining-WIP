 décor pared down layout open refreshing!  Still great view well   started Caesar salad red crab sweet corn bisque   Both excellent   entrée stuck tapas crab cakes garlic pollo bites   am always hunt best crab cakes amazing especially sweet lime chili sauce side   server Zachary enthusiasm professionalism joie de vivre made real dining experience   only suggestions would serve water choice lemon lime wedges bring plantains when cocktails ordered   Overall great experience look forward another amazing dinner there  <EOR> Was invited Isebelas Desert Shores told Puerto Rican resturant? its Tapas resturant  Food lack luster best over priced ordered quail over cooked ordered Tostones over cooked very dry no flavor  Music bad very nice place  <EOR> Beautiful setting  3 friends enjoy Happy Hour  took 10 minutes back forth waiter realize 10 wines menu only full bodied Chardonnay left which none like   Finally left without ordering  Very disappointing time consuming  Wished just said front all light crisp wines  Hard believe couldn't run Total Wine tide them over few days  <EOR> Gave place 4 tries no more   Really really wanted because live right across street   Food decent however bar service worst ever seen   EVERY time try glass wine list glass least 1 if 2 3 top choices choices aren't great begin with   final straw came Tuesday night when ordered Freemark Abbey cab which amazingly stock   Later ordered another which brought bartender   Took couple sips tasted off server check sure Freemark Abbey  sitting back bar heard bartender say Mondavi FA course could predicted one!! WTF he charged most expensive wine glass tried pass off crap good stuff without even saying anything   told server bring Arrowood instead   out course   Rather intentionally deceiving crap wine bartender could just told would happy martini   anything but crappy wine   guy should fired absolutely cannot believe he did that   server great way completely embarrassed whole thing   predict restaurant closed end summer   at least should be   embarrassing say place exists Desert Shores  <EOR> I very excited see new restaurant lakes desert shores  Unfortunately expectations full filled  Some dishes hit miss  service slow prices did match dishes  ordered crab cakes which good but smallest crab cakes ever  very disappointed size literally bite  also latin clam chowder which lacked clams very tick  main dishes pork chops which pretty good size dish  pork stuffed blue cheese which good complement  problem pork bit dry  also fish chips which complete disappointment too  Before ordered server told having problems batter but fixed issue  wished could gotten tip  dish mainly batter   fish small pieces but tons batter  flavor just ok   I liked fact live music Friday night which made atmosphere lot more fun  just wished food good enough come back   probably won't coming back restaurant  <EOR> ** 4 29 15  This review Isabella's Vegas The new Latin Fish high expectations based rave reviews read Yelp Restaurant itself hard find  saw sign building but couldn't figure if restaurant upstairs downstairs  Needs better signage  Received friendly prompt service Saturday night  complimentary plantain chips delicious! Just salty crispy enough  Half off select tapas during happy hour but prices hidden green dot  odd  should changed should always know prices front without surprise when bill arrives   ordered calamari little pollo tapas plates  just ok  given menu Salmon Salad priced $8 95 BUT charged $15 00 it  salad delicious although should brought server's attention chose because hurry next destination  end day though prices charged should advertised menu prices  $5 sangria best ever had  would back just sangrias  view stunning   hope return sometime Sunday Brunch menu looks delicious  wait few months though Isabella's iron kinks before returning  <EOR>
