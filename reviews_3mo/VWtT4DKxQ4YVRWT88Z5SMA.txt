If you've original location you'll disappointed find smaller less seating  But plenty more outdoor seating comparison    The usual treats drinks crave Sambalatte still available here  there's kicker drive thru!!  Not sure if open use   only time tell well go  <EOR> You did again Luis  Best coffee town time easily accessible parking readily available  wait time shorter new barista LA made coffee amazing! can't wait until every corner America  <EOR> First time coffee shop very long time  big coffee drinker  But since within walking distance brand new thought I'd give try    Interior very nice spacious yet maintains sense coziness  Decor you'd expect    The pastries expensive  guess normal types places but $8 ham n egg n cheese muffin bit much  said all looked delicious    Now ordered  chai latte  warm hot which don't really mind because could drink right away  But those drinks piping hot you'll disappointed  $5 chai latte something I'd everyday but when mood fancy drink stop again  Besides feel snooty haha  drink sure you'll happy did  liked chai latte  <EOR> I'm happy new store  original impossible parking spot at  Now ride bike Flat White  Which highly recommend  Coffee good steam punk brewer  Store does 'charm' original but coffee just good  <EOR> Was fan Boca Park location   Great location nearby now   Wish inside seating bit bigger but now weather doing well plenty outdoor patio seating  <EOR> I wish would throw couch two but place lovely anyway! Nicely laid laid back  No hectic vibe but still very quick  Everyone seems green store 2 small mistakes nothing big but super attentive apologetic it  Seems once staff gets into groove top notch spot top notch coffee  So kind cut them some slack first few weeks  sure am! <EOR> I love cappuccinos those definitely deserve 5 stars    But am REALLY bummed close 7pm  isn't Summerlin where everything closes down early  same complex two 24hr businesses restaurant closes 2 3am  10 people just leave more coming because said close 7  don't stay open until 2am though I'd love it but least until 9 10pm most other things area  Even Starbucks stays open late block away    I've waiting months location open great just hope change mind hours! <EOR> I never made other Sambalatte but bookmarked long time excited opening near S  Jones 215 same place Kyara Tropical Smoothies   It's nice inside few tables long bar top but doesn't seem hold lot people  some tables outside though since weather nice sit outside if gets crowded   I've few drinks far liked them  offered liked them  Nutella Latte White Mocha Café Con Leche  heard some nice creative designs drinks  only gotten heart which ok maybe need stop taking drink they'll something nicer    It seems bigger fan pastries food  Everything looked good  ordered Ham Cheese Croissant really it  warm cheesy flakey  I'd order again  want try quiche meal something dessert side next    The layout seems little wrong because if come front door which closest parking lot you'll walk through people waiting orders your order   They drive thru but sure if they're functional yet  <EOR> Really excited try place since never Boca park one   I don't drinking coffee but still wanted foam art green tea latte good! If you've ever those Japanese green tea kit kats tasted yummy every sip  also 2 macaroons almond caramel  pretty disappointed since much hype  both way sweet overwhelming  Maybe wrong ones    This place worth try plenty seats outside nice weather days  want come back try Nutella latte  <EOR> Macaroons great almond nutella anything rocks! am glad close work! <EOR> I wanted give more stars but first time Jones location sort miss   asked gal register veggie quiche which spotted display case berry ice tea she said don't any more veggie quiche  said wonder why ones case say veggie then? She then said oh sorry then asked if wanted go?  probably again give them another chance being just opened kinks out   way quiche priced tad high seemed bit small compared other establishments frequented  also inquired blended coffee if almond milk which Barista stated did but flavoring used would dairy it   another day  <EOR> Yes there's no doubt coffee good but pretentiousness place overall never want set foot again  cheesy music covers play uniforms baristas wear constantly changing wifi password overall bad service  not mention overpriced is  just scene  veggie quiche $8 but tiny served plastic silver wear  open mind leave generally annoyed  Sunrise Coffee House legit local vibe fair prices great service  <EOR> I gave Summerlin location 5 Stars  Jones location just opened going give few chances since love coffee  All foods drinks great  give those 5 Stars  3 Stars because service price  don't mind $5 price coffee but $8 ham cheese croissant! Really?! service VERY slow moment  understandable IF busy if they're under staffed but there's 5 people behind counter 3 people coffee section 2 cashiers  found myself waiting acknowledged finally someone took order coffee took forever made  because baristas just socializing talking plans night! Really?! Come on! hear see you're doing doing! Then ask cashier much some pastries respond don't know  least employees know prices small amount pastries top head! going give them chance though because coffee! really hope themselves together! really want them succeed close later time!

Anyway sat around waiting perusing local mags while coffee made  little section back booth like area but chose cafe tables front  also countertop stools facing outside  some music wasn't loud  far ambiance seating don't know if LOVE getting work done  But great catching friends light reading   The coffee perfect  Truly  don't know feels rich creamy mean must consumed 1000 calories right? Actually no  But  delicious is  book if side town no sense coffee elsewhere  <EOR> I looking forward opening cafe weeks  am now sad taking retail space where another more reasonably priced coffee shop could be   If browse thru pictures pretty lattes fun designs oh so flirty feel them also come across mine  very boring cup standing next iPhone 5  did give real sense shock when handed over card tune $6 42 Yes $6 42 plus tax measly chai espresso  awkward concoction bought recommendation very helpful friendly barista  because am giving 3 stars  If based price alone would demanding negative star rating  imagine now shock worn off bit am still feeling just tad violated   On side note almond macaroon delightful included $6 42 price just clear   suppose all lost  Just careful when pick your poison here  may end blowing your week's coffee budget fail swoop  <EOR> super super love coffee shop! if looking good morning boost u must come  your caffeine! always look good crema espresso latte  ENOUGH SAID  love it  <EOR> I excited see new coffee spot side town other starbucks  great place come lots indoor outdoor seating  play great music really mellow  Besides great atmosphere drinks great  always great recommendtions try something different everytime  Cortado wonderful strong  If love green tea try matcha latte even blended just frappe    I've 4 5 times already recently noticed dog bowls water would great bring your dog here   A wonderful spot! <EOR> I always enjoyed Sambalatte Boca Park am elated opened new location off Jones 215S   decor unique great customer service outdoor seating inviting  cafe lattes served real cup favorite   Expensive? don't think prices comparable mega chain coffee stores  big difference  local cafe local owners some big chain where all profits Seattle! <EOR> Met clients touring rain all day last Friday     Do really say if am going pay over $5 coffee drink expect hot?  entire party's order lukewarm   ok  <EOR> Pretty much same vibe original Sambalatte but less crowded rich people  location perfect I could walk home always wanted convenient study location   That being said tend study night place closes EARLY  surprised when leave 30 minutes arriving! should checked hours though  drinks par original well prices service  think service actually better because employees don't rush orders   For some reason place draws incredibly friendly polite customers well  love it! Great little place study catch friends just your morning coffee way work there's drive thru   Convenient location 215 well   One strange thing noticed absolutely no music playing entire time there   Conversation filled air but still silent times  normal original location well? honestly never noticed because place always bustling people   In any case probably back soon if need some intense studying during day  <EOR> The coffee great but prices overly expensive even clientele cater to your moneys worth  only offer 16 oz  drinks some drinks only 12 oz  When asked 16 oz  drink sales person said give but only add more milk additional coffee  am sure best customer friendly approach    I think stick Coffee Bean Tea Leaf  Coffee quality same but reasonable prices  <EOR> I jumped joy when saw place opened far away house! agree previous yelp reviewer taste true original  real treasure ambiance customer service  workers nice welcoming almost want love drinks  ambiance amazing but inside outside music playing inside really outside  great place study talk friend if early  Outlets inside easy find easy outside unless you're sitting big conference table  really want love place hopefully find favorite drink   I coming more! <EOR> I didn't much wow factor walking did original location but still great spot hang out   Plenty seating all around especially outdoors  laptop campers there's few outlets spread throughout place but super plentiful  No huge co working table location too  really liked working table original location   Coffee still great my favorite flat white always served happily  Another good spot caffeinated southwest part Vegas  <EOR> Not extravagant boca park but location drive threw!!! Nevertheless location still relaxing samba vibe when walk inside    For first timers nothing Starbucks coffee bean use too   coffee tea more authentic more exotic flavors Nutella latte       If chai fan chai latte best ever had   more spice taste layers unlike other places where consistent flavor <EOR> Second Sambalatte location same mall Kyara   Since moved San Francisco hard time looking great coffee shops offer consistent high quality espresso drinks  Sambalatte Summerlin great but crowded loud   This location much quieter neighborhood which big plus   Prices high end but quality well worth buck   I'll come back often  <EOR> Although location doesn't carry same charm Boca Park find more welcoming comfortable convenient   It's located Jones just off 215 next Tropical Smoothie near Sierra Gold Kyara  Small inside but ample outdoor seating shade  Working drive through those go    Baristas awesome very consistent  drinks taste very milky other location but drinks perfect balance between coffee milk  always opt nutella latte nutella cappucino chocolate cappucino almond milk  Heads shots espresso large enough count two according baristas  No tall grande ventis size availabilities 12 oz hot drinks 12 oz 16 oz iced lattes    If cards 15 drinks your next free  only complaint your tab rack here  drinks pastries pretty pricey  <EOR> I recently moved Seattle area found Las Vegas coffee scene disappointing nonexistent   tables Starbucks near apartment seem gathering place deranged homeless  Anyway am very happy showed Sambalatte  love atmosphere course signature Nutella Latté  am straight black coffee kind person thought latte would sweet but lo behold just perfect  <EOR> This place EXPENSIVE  drinks baked goods tasty but nothing special  sizes drinks relatively small compared other cafes prices much  specialty drinks sounded great new fresh idea taste didn't match expectations  liked but probably won't come back  Oh aren't any trash cans outside eating area which also weird  <EOR> Only second time admittedly expensive but worth it     treat great coffee frappe delicious!  almond croissant amazing!!! Unreal thing cashier remembered name only other time there!!! Cashier wonderful great friendly personality       True alittle stuffy people tend just stay long coffee gone using wireless allowing other patrons sit but all all great place treat yourself <EOR> I coffee shop mainly flat white   convenient location friendly staff qualify product   wish quicker making orders clearing tables  <EOR> Classy coffee joint  Expensive but frothy hearts lattes worth it  <EOR>
