I finally eaten enough menu items write decent review!  I tried following order them all again Spicy Apricot Quinoa Zucchini Lasagna Chicken Chimichurri Wrap Loaded Oatmeal Cookie   The first time tried food CMYE Reverse Spring Break Campus Commons   knew event going eating much more healthy delicious food   I promised myself order something different next time Campus Commons food court but Spicy Apricot Quinoa calls me   already miss it old friend   blend spice sweet light aromatics properly cooked quinoa   once said could eaten buckets  now think have!  The Zucchini Lasagna w red wine marinara such great take traditional lasagna didn't even miss pasta  cheese veggies zucchini roasted red peppers spinach mushrooms sauce done well nothing being over powering   may try again meat sauce but am sure because seems self defeating veggie dish   The newest item tried  Chicken Chimichurri Wrap   Very straight forward tasty   sauce mixture spicy red sauce chimichurri   Fair warning those sensitive heat item fairlyy hot 5 6 10 random heat scale    Though liked tasty 3 ingredient dish chicken wrap sauce   served few little whole pickles side   think flavor pickles actually masked flavor wrap didn't eat them all   Lastly loaded oatmeal cookie loaded is! Chocolate cherries coconut seeds fortify standard oatmeal   There's lots going cookie best cookies lately   The speed food isn't supremely quick but don't problem because high food quality   last order took nearly 10 minutes chicken wrap quinoa   Prices reasonable but exactly cheap   bottom line flavor healthiness food   If eating healthy then why can't everyone else well?!? <EOR> So came internet cafe meeting friend no idea gonna get  waiting saw place  menu looked amazing! sad though because 12 closed  Frowny face  BUT when friend arrived very fashionably late 27 minutes exact OPEN!  WOOOO HOOO!!!!  I decided two things spicy apricot quinoa cherry tabulah   owner asked if wanted quinoa hot cold   interesting    How take it  She said she liked both asked if could half hot half cold  She said no problem   The cherry tabulah outstanding  Dried cherries couscous but buckwheat berries something fennel raw cauliflower personally think should blanched bit but still delicious cherry pomegranate dressing  OMFG! damn good  back NO DOUBT! The spicy apricot quinoa delicious too  flavorful tasty just right amount spice kick notch!  My friend ordered no preservtive all beef angus hotdog he really enjoyed it   This place amazing hope she's stay  back  Probably next week  want zucchini lasagna   If delicious good food very decent price it! <EOR>
