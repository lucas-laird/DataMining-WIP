This large relatively modern looking mcds  Its bit grimy which mho kind defeats purpose remodel  Why bother making all pretty modern if youre going wipe down regularly?  The service ok  Food standard mcds fare    The reason come HUGE four story play area  kids enjoy exploring enjoy getting half hour sanity   theres small space underneath littler guys play but playplace realistically more older kids climb well    The kids room completely closed off rest restaurant which works great keeping boys running off theres separate bathroom just aparents   No changing table which some strange reason seems way las vegas restaurants roll  really hate that    Therefore shouldnt surprised when change poopy diaper posh bench seats since theres nowhere else it  Maybe then they'll wipe down afterwards    But dont count it  <EOR>
