The service horrible!!  recently opened within last couple months lot used Arby's   screwed mine two co workers orders last 3 times went    batting 100!  drive through slower molasses takes good 15 minutes even when only car front you   don't understand takes long even order right   even sat watched employee check bag 5x course I'd assume correct    fast food workers want $15 hr?  Yea right!! <EOR> The food decent i wouldn't put any higher then two stars drinks watery chicken cook uneven but sides great mash potatoes good Mac cheese exceptional service well continued  <EOR> I love church's chicken but location ridiculous   employee super slow rude  assuming manager pants sagged much see sweaty marks undwrwear  definitely contacting Corp because if  manager there's huge problem  weird slow because all food already made  <EOR>
