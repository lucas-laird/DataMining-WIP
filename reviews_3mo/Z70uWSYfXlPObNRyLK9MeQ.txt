Getting first review course seems fitting since twice past 3 days  only few issues course seeing basically glorified par 3 course   One glaring issue green fees comparable Rhodes Ranch which no sense  However coupons playing round less strenuous your wallet  Another issue fact workers basically hassled 15th green asking if actually paid 18 holes  pretty sure he same person paid he should've already known answer   Other course definitely bit short but fun beginners  If looking finish quick 18 holes should definitely check course  <EOR>
