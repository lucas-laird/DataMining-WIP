OMG      Probably best meet longest time  Tender flavorful   they tell marinate days some secret sauce    I tell them whatever your secret guard well !!! I tried some drink made sake but looked margarita    going hit hot summer Vegas nights  House trans music awesome service uniquely friendly owner    Haza won heart stomach !  Thank you <EOR> From start service issue  server explained menu saying isn't Outback where each person orders thing order bunch stuff share  Then given metal forks knives eat dishes while Asian customers given chopsticks  guess look white know anything Japanese food? found also white female server's assumptions  laughably offensive   On top given wrong bill  manage mix your tables when only two parties entire building beyond me    The only reason giving more single star because Chef Henry came introduced himself which much appreciated  Other staff sitting around talking playing phones   Menu limited dishes average bland  CLAM GINGER SOUP Tasted ginger water  MISO FISH SOUP Large bowl miso soup fish instead tofu  Very simple  VEGETABLE TEMPURA artistic presentation but tempura coating very thin falling off  Server forgot dipping sauce  VINEGAR GRILLED MACKEREL Decent chunk mackerel wish skin crisper   SAUCE GRILLED SQUID Generous portion but very rubbery bland despite sauce  STIR FRIED UDON Ample serving chewy noodles veggies comforting flavors  Nothing stood something would come back for  <EOR> This place just didn't all  am sure trying do  authentic Japanese Americanized what??  Food pretty subpar  Tempura pretty tasteless Clam Ginger soup bland squid rubbery  did mackerel even though skin could more crispy   I would say biggest problem service  No chop sticks ?? Hmm very strange  Attitude service probably even more strange told order eat  also told place quote Isn't Outback where each order entrée  Hmm okay now just starting feel insulting  eaten ton Japanese food especially right Las Vegas  am sure why treated first experience outside American offerings  Very confusing  am even going into fact card ran wrong charging bill only other table there   The chef owner did come say hi appreciated but Ilooking overall experience just can't give them more star just way many issues  <EOR> The lamb chop #1 must order  son ordered seafood udon miso soup he loves it  Finish whole plate  Tiger fried shrimp great        Yakitori also very awesome chicken wings pork  Very friendly waitress table big good group family dinning  came around 7pm food came very fast enjoy food very much finished 8pm  Would really recommend place anyone  <EOR> My experience amazing!
