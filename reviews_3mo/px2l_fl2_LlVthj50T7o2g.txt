Despite people say China Joe's used love ordering them  would Curry Chicken lunch special perfectly happy  ten years ago   Fast forward now  China Joe's gone through ownership changes haven't Curry Chicken lunch special menu several years  result pretty much never anymore  some reason decided lunch today  Being General Tso's Chicken fan $5 25   smelled amazing driving back office but when opened container just looked off  sauce chicken way dark just threw ton soy sauce into mix  actually tasted OK but definitely GTC hoping for  Appearance affects taste almost much smell something just didn't seem right mind   It may unfair dismiss them based dish but don't think returning at least another few years   way glad  Having less option choose lunch decision ever so slightly easier  <EOR>
