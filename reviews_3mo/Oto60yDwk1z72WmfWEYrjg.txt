Baja Miguel's reminds Don Miguel's restaurant Orlean's hotel  anything catchy names ??? In fact entire Southpoint Hotel reminds Orlean's just newer    Both Hotels same room layouts which really quite large nice       exactly same type Mexican restaurant   I really service Baja Miquels much better quite display Margaritas  food very good  bring many bowls chips salsa handle  The Margaritas quite tasty  If stay hotel couple coupons your dining stay bit lighter wallet however prices very resonable portion size  A very nice very average Mexican restaurant  <EOR> My wife Vegas locals Mexican food favourite  When South Point opened its new Mexican restaurant give try especially only short drive   The first thing noticed Baja Miguel's looks more cafe Mexican restaurant  colours decor layout tables doesn't most intimate setting   Before meal given Salsa bean dip guacamole  can't comment guac since neither salsa good but bean dip revolting   I ordered shredded beef nachos wife cheese enchiladas   best way describe food Pedestrian sort would expect chain restaurant   beef nachos bit sloppy wife described food ok but nothing id ever crave again    In city many cheap Mexican options give Baja Miguel's big miss  food OK but when similarly cheap fare all over town usually much higher quality don't see any reason again   On plus side drink service sensational staff looked well  <EOR>
