This worst KFC ever to  closest house sometimes come satisfy chicken craving  But try avoid all costs  several incidences where wait 10+ minutes food drive thru  completely unacceptable fast food joint  first time happened gave them benefit doubt because particularly busy day  But happened again then again then again    also cut down menu tremendously  used big fan Honey BBQ wings  Now don't even offer any sauces wings  place worth your time  <EOR>
