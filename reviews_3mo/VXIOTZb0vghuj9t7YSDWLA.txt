It's mystery when Ice Monster actually opened    just popped nowhere  First noticed Ice Monster few weeks ago when checked Pot Tea Social House   First impression nice decor useful digital screen menu images   small selection macarons other baked goods  Definitely opened recently because staff fairly disorganized     I wanted try shaved snow but still full brunch   Plus shaved snow priced higher competitors $8 95   friends tried few drinks Honey Green Milk Tea Organic Matcha Float Ugi Milk Foam Tea   All drinks great flavor   didn't artificial flavor all other boba places   Only complaint thick layer honey bottom honey green milk tea     Also place NEEDS trash cans   no trash inside outside   Although wasn't busy staff very attentive cleaning tables timely manner  <EOR> The place very friendly atmosphere good music free wifi  drinks made seems fresh ingredients  sandwiches salads good  snow fluff huge fresh  wish trash cans but told would throw away us <EOR> New snow ice place near me! bad didn't chance try snow ice lol did however chance try drinks  others said place new servers still learning menu  However still very polite took time find answers me  wide variety snow ice choices though such peanut milk even bubble milk tea ! try later  able try some drinks UGI milk foam tea Ceylon black milk tea matcha snow slush yogurt  those favorite would matcha snow slush yogurt drink  boba done better expected just right chewiness sweetness  other two drinks overly sweet  hyperglycemia pee pants sweet  UGI milk foam neat but sweet drink just gets lost  Overall definitely back try snow ice  would probably pass tea drinks but would try matcha drinks  <EOR> 2 Stars  being little generous     We arrived lunch friends also Yelpers   going speak them but opinion Ice Monster some work do     Ice Monster Cafe new couple hiccups expected right?  They're new clean decent place hang at   However what's lacking knowledgeable staff desserts worth price them at   Coffee Ice Cream which literally small scoop Blue Bunny Ice Cream   Tasted good but worth $5 95 price tag   biggest disappointment overall service   gf few questions items menu staff couldn't even speak it   even stated could Google some items menu us   Really?  Google it??  don't expect new business staff experts but least some knowledge you're serving   few friends orders took long ie  20 minutes boba just wrong i e  coffee instead tea       Overall fan good gets but giving them break  Better only because they're new   sure improve hope do   look forward reading better rated reviews willing give them another when time comes   now 2 stars all me    PS Check In Offer reads 1 Free purchase 2 items    They're speaking Yoda really mean Buy 2 items receive another 1 free   <EOR> Decide try place lunch Pot Tea Social House  same shopping area behind DQ convenient many restaurants chose from  admit desserts bit more expensive but service speciality items snow fluff coffees review all about   ATMOSPHERE The place relaxing kind reminds hangout vibe Easy Life Boba Tea Crepe Shack  Place clean board games available customers we played UNO Jenga   6 booths large enough parties 4 6  good thing because they're snow fluff portions huge  You're gonna need many people finish it   FOOD The pastries okay  Sugary but no wow factor really  $3 6 per pastry pretty small  pastry would recommend three tried CHOCOLATE GANACHE TART  larger portion rest chocolate shortbread crust fudge more chocolate mousse top garnished gold flake  Next PISTACHIO TART  Chocolate pistachio gel top raspberry mousse inside  Okay great  Expensive size but many pastry shops are  Last pastries ROSE RASPBERRY MACARON    okay but best save your money coffees snow fluff  wasn't special but least crunchy outer shell chewy inner shell    Now good part  ordered ICED CINNAMON BLACK COFFEE which yummy super delicious  sweetened but perfect amount  Delicious coffee strong cinnamon flavor  Would looove order again  Next STRAWBERRY SENSATION SNOW FLUFF    said above thing created Godzilla's babies  Huge portion keep table 5 satisfied even 1 3 left  came panna cotta fresh strawberries strawberry ice cream strawberry syrup  love strawberries great  ice cream okay tasted regular store bought but strawberries perfectly ripe panna cotta gave creamy factor snow fluff needed    SERVICE We helped two young ladies Tori Gigi  Great girls good humor  helped explain everything pointed display case offered thought good  also checked table  Also when more family came door guy I think owner? helped clear bigger booth could all sit together  Very welcoming place   Overall wouldn't come back pastries but would service relaxed atmosphere coffee snow fluff  <EOR> I came boyfriend because neighborhood  hot summer day needed something cool down  server Gigi extremely helpful friendly  We gigantic bowl shaved ice  Very expensive very big  wish smaller size didn't want pay $7 something knew wasnt going finish   Overall love place!
