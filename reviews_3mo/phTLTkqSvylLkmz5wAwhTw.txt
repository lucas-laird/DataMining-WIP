We tried place only because coupon mistake   Spring rolls greasy wrapper soaked within 5 mins took drive home   Then blotting paper towel soaked another full towel full grease   Dipping sauce gelatinous  Orange chicken tough breading soggy   Took loads antacid over meal   plus side counter girl sweet when she rejected coupon because small print said dine only only within certain time frames   Really!  best way garner new business your grand opening celebration    Coupon flier said Grand Opening Celebration but appeared same storefront operation always next Domino's  Teriyaki beef nicely flavored but consistency little slimy <EOR> Stopped figured I'd try them out  gave establishment 1 star due lack service  waited almost 20 minutes given glass water then longer just order taken  must say food cooked order decent    I should listened review 1 star lesson learned  I'd rather China A Go Go next time  <EOR>
