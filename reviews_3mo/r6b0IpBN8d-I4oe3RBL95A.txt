Yum! good simple froyo place Treasure Island located first floor right before hit casino across Pizzeria  Froyo $0 45 per ounce just many toppings Yogurtland  favorite far lychee consistency almost sorbet  There's also no sugar added yogurts which somewhat healthier  think fewer flavors typically Yogurtland   They also variety crepes waffles ice cream sandwiches look great well definitely hoping try some more    For kids somewhat guilt free dessert definitely isn't bad option if you're staying here  menu other items also decently expansive something everyone  <EOR> The flavored all bad except lychee  Even plain bad    does even happen <EOR> The two stars nice lady cash register clean interior  extremely over priced would opt yogurt land instead  When tried flavors very disappointing  plain tart tasted extremely sour more tart supposed taste like  Maple syrup interesting flavor well  lychee flavor only good one  wouldn't come back here  <EOR> Their shakes pretty decent Banana Bread Pudding! Their yogurt solid thumbs down though  just plain good  If you're mood froyo yourself favor find PinkBerry YogurtLand  <EOR> Good selection toppings except gummy worms VERY hard  Good thing only put two  Also actual yogurt selection sort weird? flavor offered weren't appealing all  Other place looked pretty clean cashier talked nice  definitely try something different next time come LV! two stars hard toppings weird flavors  <EOR>
