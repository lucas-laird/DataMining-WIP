Located Venetian food court casino level   This Chipotle Cafe Rio style fixins' made front you  $9 10 3 tacos your choice meat + lettuce + cheese + salsa  They charge extra almost everything else  ie  sour cream guac extra salsa chips extra meat   This really 2 3 stars but price does justify food  Def worth it  But   if you're ever mood something else BESIDES Italian since seems  all Venetian Palazzo   then good alternative  Also less expensive Taqueria Canonita which only casual style Mexican restaurant property  <EOR>
