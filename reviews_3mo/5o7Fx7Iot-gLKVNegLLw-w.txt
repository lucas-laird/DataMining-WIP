Loved place! last day semi crazy Vegas weekend brother cousins decided stop off place eat no crazy lines off strip search long shot  guess totally paid off! ordered much food but worth it  pupusas filling tastey  Shrimp cocktail awesome! forget bro cousins but all loved it  Everything ordered good! server nice jokes around bit  jukebox lots old new music didn't seem mind singing songs! didn't problem until cousin thought she ordered Salvadoran relleno de papa instead she Guatemalan relleno de papa which TOTALLY different  don't remember if specified menu but if then mistake  Just sure ask them clarify because some countries same things different names different things same names  <EOR> Liked it  Kakik which very tasty hearty tamale which genuinely Guatemalan unlike other latin restaurants claim authentic traditional offerings only fall short   The strip mall located wasn't best but can't wait back try savory Pepian  <EOR>
