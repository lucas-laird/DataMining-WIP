I've only experienced original cheffinis once 1 am good buzz going  imagine most delicious hot dog ever  might alcohol might can't say sure   BUT crave maybe something there    When Ty told going container park told must!  Plus little man loves playground he never days no  Saturday which normally busy but think gloomy weather may something because amount people manageable    As walk giant praying mantis into park cheffinis located past coffee shop left side where old pork beans was  If you've ever before know absurdly small is  replaced long middle table three tall tables side short table stretches length window   menu available above order counter  selections varied slightly came preselected toppings  option naked dog add two toppings your choice plus sauces price $4 99   normally would but El Mexicano stood me  run $6 99 including drink side    El Mexicano bacon wrapped all beef dog you option beef turkey vegan cherry pepper relish green sauce garlic aioli Chipotle guava onions tomatoes avocado cilantro garnish    Lots flavor lots spice! hot dog super juicy snappy crunch when bit into it  all toppings kept taste buds going!  Delicious!!  didn't try any sides thankfully because hot dog plenty  stuffed rafters  bit disappointed iced tea had  tasted sour tea does when old    But overall great experience come back when container park  <EOR> I stopped into new addition Container Park work decided start litmus test Naked hot dog just mustard onions   wanted actually taste hot dog just guess tastes under mounds toppings     The hot dog nigh perfect!  Good tight outside moist tender inside full flavor   bun mushy added well experience    Reminds great concession dogs would theatre ball park before invented dreaded steam roller   dog A+   Totally worth 5 bucks   My complaint comes drink 3 dollars small seems added lot total price without any real value   Several places nearby same size almost half price   Also something wrong lids use wouldn't stay leaked much did away quick   Overall great food choice but think drink should find bit lower price point  <EOR> I'm pretty glad Cheffini's managed evolve cart standalone restaurant  glorious hot dog most perfect foods follow drunken pub crawl around downtown  gives reason set food once again Container Park place didn't interest much before   Keep mind you're getting gourmet hot dogs here  plain dog cost $4 99 fancier stuff going more toward $6 9  $8 little much pay hot dog but hey could tell used some quality ingredients into dog let slide  If more quantity over quality type may sit nearby casino cafe order gigantor hot dog usually serve couple bucks   Price point aside hot dog very good  Crunchy Dog hot dog concoction all sorts crunchies all over bacon potato chips fried onions etc    also topped nori seaweed sriracha mayo give bit Asian twist  wasn't necessarily blown away but still good   Would come back? Probably  price point something starting see all renovations going around east downtown  times crave hot dog way it  Cheffini's does good definitely some best area  <EOR> I love place  Great dogs  great beer selection Make sure try Grandfather best Hot dogs ever had  Highly recommend it  I can't wait back! <EOR> Food ok but dont see why takes 20min plus kids hotdog   Worst service   itsxsucked pork n bean container its sucks now cheffinis   Its sad could great place if owner knew whats trained staff   countergirl could take ordrr cuz she counting er drawer other ppl waiting food did pay cuz she counting  Tastes ok executed poorly  <EOR>
