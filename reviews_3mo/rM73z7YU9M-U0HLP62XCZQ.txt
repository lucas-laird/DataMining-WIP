My co worker decided change lunch today hit Arby's  We're strangers Arby's but wouldn't say regulars decided take look online menu  found Market Fresh Farmers Chopped Salad looked pretty good decided order that  When arrived Arby's tell don't any such salad  Now Yum brands least restaurant websites tell participating locations Arby's location offered no explanation  Now because co worker split bill lunch when return office amongst each other receipt required so  Well no receipt either  If wasn't enough when time dig eat also discovered Arby's sauce requested non existent    alternate food choice amazing but service experience   meh  <EOR>
