More flavor too! Staff very friendly nice  Can't believe haven't heard them before when 4 other locations  <EOR> Three words    Everything Needed Salt   We came lunch during week completely empty 12 30 afternoon  Only other couple came while dining in    I ordered chicken salad husband pork burrito  meats only thing actually salt little much that    You romain cabbage your salad decided mix two little more texture am glad did because almost everything else over cooked soggy    It's your basic diy salad bowl burrito nachos some very similar toppings would see chipotle only Hawaiian twist    I fajita veggies under seasoned incredibly soft oily    The corn salsa under seasoned corn overcooked chewy    The pico under seasoned did taste fresh    The salsas all under seasoned  tried them all back because started eating salad realized needed some heat thought asked spicy salsa  asked side spicy salsa brought back realized already salad but didn't much heat it    The girls working nice offered some samples meat but beef only able try chicken pork    I think place could excellent if seasoning down cooking time veggies right  Unfortunately wasn't case time    They also gave sample coconut dessert bar only thing ate properly salted  dessert bar    <EOR> Food delicious! first time visiting establishment  staff very helpful recommendation point!
