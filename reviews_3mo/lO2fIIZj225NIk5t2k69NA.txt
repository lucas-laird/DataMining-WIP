Whomever kitchen no clue Singapore Malaysian food should just stop trying   better recipe book instead just tossing bunch ingredients together hoping nobody would notice drastic differences   Having dishes menu insult cuisine   The only things decent beverages but then considering easy Thai Iced Tea mix poured commercially prepared container no brainer   case no talent required job   Service good attentive   know front house responsible back house throws !!! tries pass off cuisine but perhaps should just stick food place eponymously named try attempt cuisine obviously no clue about  <EOR> Terrible service!
