Damn! Someone it! Haha   I ate inside Venetian  If you've eaten Cheesecake Factory then pretty much same thing    Portions pretty big  Pricing same Cheesecake Factory  lunch special pretty well worth it  sandwich special came half regular sandwich house salad soup $10  Strawberry smoothie delicious    4 people came $70 including appetizers cheapest spot eat if you're looking quick bite  think drinks soda smoothie iced teas alone came $20! <EOR> Thank goodness TWO GLs   Palazzo location much quieter no lines!!!    Yums Duck Potstickers Max Burger a MONSTER fill 2 3 adults!!! Zen Noodles White meat Pho healthy versions anything   Hours close two hours earlier Venetian location  <EOR> Went lunch 6 27 2008  Ordered half sandwich soup lunch special  chicken salad sandwich very good  clam chowder also good  portions big very satisfying  If you're looking reasonably priced restaurant eat suggest trying Grand Lux Cafe Palazzo  <EOR> Please avoid ordering omelette here  looks styrofoam frisbee  folded half stuffed your favorite diced meats and or veggies   tastes styrofoam because don't think use real eggs eggs carton fo sho   omelettes steamed   yuck  visual evidence posted those doubt me    Other decently priced food  portions big don't leave still feeling hungry  twice lunch didn't wait line all  service polite prompt accomodating  Overall restaurant good place eat convenience if you're staying Palazzo decent food  <EOR> Although only gone couple times experience Grand Lux Cafe enjoyable During recent trip Vegas stayed Venetian ate Grand Lux everyday   Palazzo didn't wait line quieter seemed much nicer   The service great waiters really friendly would check every often sure glasses filled  The food comes big portions  never finish it   The Grand Appetizer Platter good big groups spring rolls delicious! I forgot its called but some sort Asian soup surprising really good American place The soup great night drinking The kick chili little salty  Fried Chicken Waffles sweet  My favorite Warm Homemade Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies  Yummm Chicken Royale good also   The only down side wait think waited 30 40 mins food  We did big group though Prices high  Their menu HUGE! hard time deciding get  little bit everything    I can't wait till next Vegas trip try something new  <EOR> I came place lunch break arrived around 11 15  akward crowd waiting staring hostess while she proceeded jack around waiters  waited until 11 23 seated    no reason   empty    Next wait over 10 minutse waiter stop by    any waiter all  When waiter finally showed he asked anyone stop yet?  NO    oh ok      apology jerkoff since youve passed table 10 minutes now could see only table empty section! Geez  I ordered chinese chicken salad  guess ok if really rice noodles  Basically  salad 65% edible styrofoam  YUM  not  Nothing good redeeming salad   yuck  With many amazing places eat Vegas disgusts many tourists waste money chain crap hole  Seriously walk 10 minutes you'll find 50 better options  <EOR>
