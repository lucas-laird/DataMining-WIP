First off Smashburger SB only valley where ten percent 10% Yelp check in offer available  Thanks nothing Tom Ryan! Maybe rent damn high  Doubt it  Secondly cute see many students checking restaurant out  sure where when small local Mexican restaurant recently shuttered but now popular international chain found stumbling over themselves over CSN no Crosby Stills Nash    Now stated those two points       Smashburger It nice place burger right near campus  cannot think another option before SB  any case now    There much say food  chain fucks sake! burger same Maryland Parkway Calgary Alberta Canada Kuwait City Kuwait    It alright  fries alright  shakes alright  ketchup packaging brilliant  Five 5 stars ketchup packaging!    The wait seems interminably longer when compared other SB locations take out  Maybe need work some kinks  would hate location training facility appear function training facility chain  but no queue when come yet still wait bit long food    I would take stopwatch document precisely long taking food but would hate accused being overly pedantic  taking long take word it    Or don't  But going late your class back work lunch  You're fired! <EOR> Smashburger! I month ago Yelp event received couple free entree coupons   This weekend craving sweet potato fries CRAZY convinced fella should Smashburger   We both ordered Sin City burger fried egg bacon grilled haystack onions egg bun cheese smash sauce  The girl assisted Emily? think? very nice did couple substitutions no problem  BF subbed goat's cheese instead cheddar no smash sauce  When food came pretty good   I'd say step two above McD's BK   meat wasn't really seasoned all   but cooked well flavors all toppings good   The sweet potato fries exactly wanted delicious   We finished off salted caramel shake   this alone worth trip!  delicious    As far burger places probably wouldn't drive completely way but prices good quality burger would definitely glad come back  <EOR> It's clean workers very friendly  Also spinach goat cheese salad amazing  swiss mushroom burger truffle sauce also delicious but favorite item menu nutter butter milk shake  Its 1000 calorie deliciousness enjoyed heavy workout day  Just JK but try milk shake  Its delicious  <EOR>
