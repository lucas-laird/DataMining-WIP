Definitely big plus Las Vegas chinese cuisine market! definitely coming back bringing wife well  <EOR> Gorgeous  love noodle there  Garlic vegetables also delicious  Service also very good  <EOR> My friend love dan dan mian place  Every time they've gone always busy go  2 hour break other day decided try place    When first entered seated immediately  girl asked if ready order in Chinese wasn't sure she said  When called over later she said asked if ready order didn't say anything  Uh    ok    Anyways menu doesn't seem many options just lot noodles broth dishes  could also wasn't looking very closely   don't peanuts dan dan mian wasn't good option me  fell back favorites beef noodle stew  bowl pretty big  came maybe 6 7 small pieces beef  used huge chunks beef wasn't expecting  many few tiny pieces vegetables  Maybe just things differently here  Since wasn't used didn't really it  noodles also different  white rice noodles I believe tasted overcooked  broth bit watery  did spicy flavor used but didn't taste awesome me    They pretty fast serving food ordered brought less 5 minutes  soup probably pre made perhaps noodles also pre cooked heated them again? could why noodles tasted overcooked  Other taking order bringing food servers ignored me  Another gentleman gave bill took payment  He must noticed getting antsy  going counter pay but he brought me    The menu doesn't seem lot variety food like  don't know if would again  <EOR> Recently visited again February 26 2015  Food 5 5 Price 5 5 Service 4 5 Cleanliness 5 5  One few Yun nan noodle places town  confused Yun Nan Garden behind Chinatown  Mi Xian noodles traditional delicious similar those Yunnan Garden over behind Chinatown   restaurant roughly 7 8 since open multiple groups friends  great location lunch dinner because quick service affordable price food                                            Food 5 5                                                   Yun Nan style food manly spicy noodles spicy hot pot bowls  highly recommend selecting 0 spice level if spicy food since level 1 spice level minor kick it    Dan Dan Mien Have order item 3 10 visits  noodles served without soup peanuts minced meat peanut butter soy sauce  tradition Sichuan Dan Dan Mien which served chili oil but similar Taiwanese American style  Ma jiang mien which less soupy Sichuan counter part   Spicy chicken Mi Xian  Have order item 2 10 visits  traditional style Yunnan Mi Xian noodles served spicy chicken soup  soup base uses lot chili oil if spicy food suggest asking lower spice level   Beef Noodle Soup Order 1 10 times  confused Taiwanese style beef noodle soup people more familiar Yunnan style using more chili oil beef noodle soup base rather Taiwanese style which consistency soup thicker  more oily spicier   Mince Meat Mi Xian Forgot exact name menu but order 1 10 times  similar Chuan Rou Mi Xian where clear soup minced meat pickle radish served soup mi xian noodles  no spicy level great those don't want something very spicy but still traditional yummy   Self Serve Hot Pot Had 4 10 times various spice levels  charges pound $4 99 non meat related items veggies tofu seaweed telephones udon etc $9 99 meat related products Beef lamb fish tripe etc    self pick pick items want buffet style bring them weighing cook bowl spicy non spicy soup  weight bowls place them already subtracted off scale being charged only food placed bowl   spicy level ranges 0 5 5 being extremely spicy 0 being no spice  few friends eat very spicy say level 5 very enjoyable but see them sweating whole time eating it  If looking challenge yourself try level 5 spice but otherwise would recommend level 2 spice because still kick                                               Prices 5 5                                                  $4 99 pound non meat products self serve hot pot $9 99 pound meat products self serve hot point  Majority time end spending roughly $6 $8 Hotpot items quite filling  normally just add $1 rice more enough food    The other noodles range around $6 99 $8 99 which quite affordable lunch dinner portions big filling                                               Service 4 5                                                 The service expected traditional Chinese place  servers quite nice but visits where servers paying attention customers  recent visit 2 27 2015 training staff improved being being more attentive customers                                             Cleanliness 5 5                                             The restaurant open month now still clean  Many issues Chinatown restaurants poor training dirty dining violations hear much about  restaurant maintains clean atmosphere front house  might issues food storage buffet but never long enough see long keep food frequency changing product    Overall Good food good price fast decent service  Very good location lunch dinner very good groups all sizes  <EOR> All favorite Chinese restaurants never last  hope last    I haven't tried many dishes  But self serve hot pot pound worth it  only pick want eat charge pounds  meat $9 99 pound non meat $4 99 pound  put many things two bowls came less $15 both meat vegetable  love fact don't count bowl weight which means pay exactly get    The first time picked medium spicy broth perfect me  eat spicy life those don't eat spicy food regularly might need choose lesser spicy option  flavor broth reminds spicy broth Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot    The second time chose same medium spicy  But came little spicy me  ordered another set vegetables no spicy broth mixed them spicy balanced spicy level  thought non spicy going plain no flavor  surprise non spicy broth actually pretty tasty  didn't even need mix together  kind having both options   My advise all first timers  bowl meat spicy broth another bowl non spicy broth vegetables  Those two bowl rice enough feed 2 4 people    You notice broth very oily lot herbs might pleasant when accidentally eat it  But  normal   just traditional food made  oil important keep broth hot without stove  legend says long time ago lady Yunnan bring food husband worked far away home  But every time she arrived husband work place food became cold due cold weather Yunnan   she figured way keep broth hot without reheating which adding lot oil broth    So if don't something oily spicy  Then place might right place you  Which okay means more room sit  I feeling am going place every week  Especially during winter time     Spicy food  Checked  Flavor  Checked   Price  Checked  Ambiance  Checked  Location  Checked   Parking  Checked   Uniqueness  Checked   Customer service  Checked for Chinese restaurant standard Overall value  Checked checked checked    Yes Yelpers am fan  <EOR> They bit overwhelmed when party dozen folk walked through doors might want phone ahead give them notice if chance   At lunch time presented paper menu consisting 21 options   selected #1 Yunnan house special casserole rice noodle $9 99 since many items marked red spicy peppers indicating heat level dish   Turns four some beside ordered off menu which resulted being presented rather large basin filled hodgepodge meats veggies bathing spicy red broth   Another neighboring table own similarly sized dish minus red tinging broth   I looked longingly direction but when casserole finally arrived made little show its own each ingredient arrived separately plated tray but then quickly quickly take photo sad face dumped into ceramic eared dish resulting all good stuff hiding beneath noodles   most pretty flavorful dishes but more enough appetite served quite hot   Yunnan Tasty Garden located plazas making Chinatown Las Vegas   3 5 stars  <EOR> Finally another Yunnan restaurant Las Vegas! place lot nicer inside Yunnan Garden  family Yunnan use home cooking Yunnan cuisine suppose be    What self serve hot pot! $4 99 veggies $9 99 meats which think very reasonable  ask your spice level 1 5 pretty spicy too!   I ordered Yunnan traditional noodle okay  But honestly think Yunnan gardens lot better less oily  But portion good sized noodles cooked al dente  needed more pickled cabbage lot more spicy!   Hotpot put little everything there  very oily though but tasty  didn't many while black peppers everywhere way eating   I don't think come back  But happy tried it  <EOR> I love place!
