Almost passed location up  new logo look generic Tropical Smoothie but guess entire company rebranding   must new location because couldn't find check Yelp    I pulled 24 hour drive thru since didn't want walk kids in   repeating Pear'ific Green Tea 4 times she couldn't understand she asked pull window continue ordering  asked if there's menu window look while ordering  No response pulled window requested  She said couldn't understand through drive thru  did want order? repeated Pear'ific Green Tea no sweetener turbenado  asked menu kids review   She left window came back catering menu   losing patience point definitely more troublesome experience if just walked in  She leaves window again decided just restaurant    The experience inside wasn't much better  menu all way against back wall but ordering counter 20' wall there's partition line sight ordering counter  Strange setup  kids couldn't read menu counter walked over bar where menu more visible however awkwardly far cashier   made even worse while ordering counter cashier ringing drive thru window  Lol  just such awkward experience  Maybe because she only employee she drawer setup window accommodate drive thru?  After finally smoothie orders added spinach salad  She asked if wanted small large  told large all 3 going share side dinner  asked dressing side since going accompany dinner home  She replied all toppings separate containers side  Perfect!  HOWEVER when home opened salad bed spinach under all containers toppings yes containers placed salad toppings took 3 4 box  Large salad?  even close enough all share even side  maybe 6 oz spinach box some turkey bacon weird taste almost tasted fish if any sense all peaches salad syrup  Ick  even slight bit satisfied  waste money   used order salads Tropical Smoothie all time  huge delicious   definitely THAT     The cashier wasn't friendly staff other locations however she wasn't rude either  She just take order then it    We did good deal smoothies because ordered during happy hour buy 2 1 free because Sunday free supplement added smoothie  probably only positive experience    Overall and unfortunately location failed deliver expect brand  <EOR> Came happy hour 5pm 7pm which buy two 24oz 4 99 third free  blueberry bliss paradise point Bahama Mama meh  good! definitely happy  <EOR> Been 5 times now haven't received great customer service yet  think greeted window maybe once  Normally just window open total demanded me  No enthusiasm smiles    One time came through female cashier told the item wanted still frozen would take longer    Cool   Ironically ended getting faster other visits    The drive thru menu awkward slant found difficult read first time came    They're still pretty new hopefully management gets employees least pretend somewhat give damn  Unfortunately seems common theme multiple locations reviews read  best location service off Cheyenne 215 experience   Cmon guys! sell great product! better attitude! <EOR>
