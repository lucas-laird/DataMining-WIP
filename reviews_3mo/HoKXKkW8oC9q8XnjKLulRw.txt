Service pretty good but lot time between courses some reason   drinks starter courses came fast but took while main entrees desserts some reason   However server really nice knowledgeable two managers came check us   The restaurant only one stall restrooms which annoys me   But restrooms Cosmpolitan just outside big deal    A little disappointed cocktails but tough person please category   Definitely fan back! <EOR> While food good service unacceptable   group 4 did require much little attention less received  If entertained each other cocktails wait food placing order would enraged anyone   Lynn manager doing nice job putting all fires caused wait staff but doing nothing anticipate prevent them happening  When asked drink directly found company's website waitress no idea where talking about   hope place takes time train but feel wont help till invest people really want part company's culture  <EOR> For those spoiled original Los Angeles Comme Ca please advised same experience  version rests among many other restaurants floor dedicated food Cosmopolitan Hotel  Everyone mean everyone floor just dining never experienced before hotels usually spread eateries    Las week greeted friendly hostess however wound having wait additional 30 40 mins because table yet available whatever reason reservation 9PM   wound having drink bar featuring worlds slowest bartenders I'm kidding wish was   wine selection apparently nothing compared LA location again prepared step down experience    Once finally seated view nice overlooking strip  menu varied many good options very similar if same LA  server friendly but little tweaked out  being served first course normal time period waited waited waited entree course  Finally flagged server only approached manager asked if heading show no apology no explanation just question quite odd  Hint readers   always tell them heading show serve more timely manner  Dinner finally came quite tasty  skipped desserts because didn't want risk wait   Overall food good ego typical Vegas I'd return just ensuring nothing agenda remainder night  If LA sure visit location Melrose its superb  <EOR> Had heard wonderful things Comme Ca truly disappointed  ambiance nice but casual great bright dining room perfect brunches casual lunches   The food mediocre service poor  Everything constantly asked refills dishes even bread  Gave place 2 3 chances service always sub par  occasion asked server particular dish menu he did even know disappointing The food isn't bad hence why still think decent place but push improving service pace bringing food easily improve place  $32 three course special lunch! <EOR> I heard great comments others comme ca excited try  am fan David Myers Sona amazing meal  fear perhaps late evening but food expecting  all looked nice simple rustic bisto fare but nothing memorable due simple fact seasoning off  bone marrow oxtail which looked delicious  marrow red tinge though off putting  oxtail nice  Next charcuterie  good but best had  cod white beans chorizo tomato exact opposite hoping for  getting ready cassoulette sorts beans mingling chorizo tomato flavorful stew  Instead beans cooked water then chorizo added then finally halved tomatoes added last minute  Nothing came together dish salt neglected  Finally pork belly  looked amazing slabs crispy belly over polenta onions  Once again though dish didn't live simply due fact wasn't seasoned  Poor experience   yes but return  opening week late night  positive note bartender great!
