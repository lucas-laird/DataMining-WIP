I usually order Mango Smoothie mango sugar only   Great serving size  branch happy hour 4 6 p m  buy 1 1  <EOR> Ok missed happy hour   Hell didn't even know happy hour joint   3 30pm guess missed half hour   Damn it!  Cheap bastards hate wasting money especially when just 30 minutes away!  Tropical Smoothie any other fresh fruit mixer except actually serve food   didn't any stomach probably could handle anything except smoothie since Vegas nights pretty much destroy any appetite have   If don't know talking then don't know party   The smoothies good they're large won't feel ripped off   Except when you're cheap bastard wish come happy hour instead paying full price  <EOR>
