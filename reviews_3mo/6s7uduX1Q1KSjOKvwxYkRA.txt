Ooh first review place  Well let start saying place inside Orleans Hotel Casino  staying hotel every time visit vegas 4 years now  always noticed sushi place but always forgot option when came choosing where go  girlfriend Vegas past weekend decided try it  little past noon pretty early place full  waiter polite attentive  ordered Las Vegas Roll Dragon Roll  Las Vegas Roll delish!! Came Salmon Crab Avocado cream cheese  melted mouth! girl ordered Dragon Roll which came dont remember inside cause couldnt even see inside due generous pieces eel top roll  did skip eel lemme tell ya! Overall good sushi good service definitely back when return! <EOR> We took parents because wanted eat non buffet place during dad's 70th b day Vegas trip   figured we're all sushi Strip yay!  Well no   place waaayyyy overpriced is   surprising since Vegas   Seriously though prices similar NYC NYC mmmmkay? Plus spicy tuna did mayo   just straight tuna   also spider roll crunchy roll unagi roll   all pretty meh except unagi     Also since found through AAA book dad discreetly asked if discount being AAA member   don't usually ask discounts but little brother hungry but hindered ordering more because prices despite assurances could cover it   waiter actually snickered said Nooooo hahaha no  guess kind tip left him  <EOR>
