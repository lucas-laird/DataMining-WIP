Tin Sing's favorite mine when lived Cali because feature amazing dishes egg rolls big cucumbers   am particular because Panda Express  only option fast Chinese American food     Everything prepared fresh place  front end ladies very personable  Pacific Shrimp Ball  Great signature dish  Never shrimp ball  Yummy yummy hot light  shrimp fresh coating crunchy enough give perfect balance  also ordered vegetable roll crispy light outer shell allowed actually taste delicious filling inside  Yum!!!   I am foodie!!! also ordered shrimp vegetables spare ribs entree  Light greasy  Clean freshly ptepared  staff very accomadating  am glad opened shopping center return   Best luck you!!!! <EOR> My only complaint place isn't closer house work  Yes you'll pay little more other places town but food obviously higher quality    No mystery meat other Chinese places  worth pay little more know eating    Also staff really friendly  never walked into fast food restaurant greeted warmly  glad they'll opening more locations around town  <EOR> Not bad but confused    really excited try place because thought dim sum place  really wasn't much choose far dim sum couple tried overpriced great  place pretty much glorified Panda Express costs nearly double Panda Express charges  If food much better Panda then ok but wasn't  food fresh give them but WAYYYYYY salty  I'd rather just Panda across street  try place again later if when actually dim sum  <EOR> Good service HORRIBLE overpriced food  morons need down Chinatown see dim sum is  place Panda Express dim sum  Worst shumai dumplings ever had  <EOR> Unbelievably disappointing  first thought is why dim sum name when offering scant? Serving 4 different kinds shumai hardly qualifies  LOVE dim sum excited when heard place opened nearby home must understand disappointment   This Panda Express knock off! sales pitch serving supposed organic food may only thing going them  considering all things equal Panda Express because they're meals better priced I can't believe just said that   Lucky still choice  other hand fortunate  daughter hungry settled    The cafe clean tastefully decorated plays upbeat music pleasant staff hence extra star    If describe overall experience 3 words it's ever returning  <EOR> This new contemporary Asian eatery tucked away corner Lowes shopping plaza between Starbucks Great Links   Cute fresh decor   They've only open 5 weeks probably need work few things  expecting good variety dim sum since  sign indicated but only 4 type siu mai  shrimp pork beef chicken plus pacific shrimp ball  also standard Chinese entrees steam trays  ordered all varieties siu mai $1 98 each hot oil mustard sauces hot sour soup  The cashier helpful friendly gave 10% discount  generously sized dumplings okay flavor   soup could bit more savory     really want them succeed because would nice good dim sum place nearby hope change menu differentiate other Chinese food places maybe adding steamed baked char siu bao along other popular dim sum appeal good cross section people  <EOR> There article local paper said fast casual Chines Dim Sum Restaurant   guess true if consider dim sum 4 choices siu mai different meats   chicken corn soup best thing had   offer organic choices which drew place but those dishes $3 more wonder work when comes cooking in same woks? same utensils?    Granted smaller portions served would think would fresher would cook them more often but many items looked sitting while    Basically just glorified version Panda Express  <EOR>
