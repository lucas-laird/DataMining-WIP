Ok here's thing Subway's all over southwest part does because its cheap fast somewhat healthy other part just see much better worse get   I ordered double meat chicken salad   once again mystified chopped part chopped salad   please dont use some type medieval torture device mutilate salad greens ingredients  happened nice layered salad purchaser gets mix destroy themselves?   It seems language barrier always challenge understand people try fast food but clear communication would slightly smoother process   Overall cant complain much since order correct   only thing think Subway should work chicken egg   appears egg egg white parts sandwiches wraps pre made really appetizing   also chicken pre sliced grill marks all exact same size    know isn't store level thing but step Subway? <EOR>
