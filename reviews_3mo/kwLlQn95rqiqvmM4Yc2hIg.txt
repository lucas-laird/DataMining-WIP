I finally dragged along chain Roberto's popping everywhere Vegas   hearing some Roberto's aren't cleanest ones bit hesitant concerned without Immodium     The S  Fort Apache actually deemed pretty decent said fellow diners frequent eaters other Roberto's around Sin City     I ordered Rolled Tacos 2 chicken 1 beef Guacamole   okay   think frozen ones home bit better   guacamole plentiful but little sweet mind   would superb cheese melted bit   maybe add cheese first then pour guacamole?  insides rolled tacos weren't hot enough tastes either   Overall just weren't crispy enough something just came deep fryer     I did try Al Pastor soft tacos those definitely much yummier order!  meat super flavorful definitely hitting taste buds   taste even better when load them freshly squeezed lime juice hot sauce jalapeno peppers   Unfortunately dining companion bit piggy didn't bother saving any leftovers next day!  Keep mind al pastor isn't offered all Roberto's take advantage when find menu       Another friend ordered looked Carne Asada Fries hell mutha focker order!  When open your styrofoam box damn   that's your dinner?  Major bang your buck sure! It noted friend said he more other Roberto's! I finished meal $2 large Horchata oh yummy!  two bucks deal!  Hot damn!  hard finish those big gulps your own share it!    We love Mexican restaurants self service condiments section side   love loading tons fresh limes peppers hot sauces cucumbers radishes etc  without feeling pig 'cuz staff isn't watching overload   watch red sauce kicker alright!   Side note pictured menu above definitely helps decide order   prices vary per each Roberto's take note that  <EOR>
