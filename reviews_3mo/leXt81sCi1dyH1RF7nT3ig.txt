2 5 stars It's those hole walls where feel really bad yourself after  1 food reminds fat 2 flies restaurant probably touched your food already know fact flies touch poop too    I tried chicken torta site edible  sandwich consisted boiled chicken lot creamy stuff sandwiched between two loaves Mexican ? bread  those things probably won't recommend friends but I'd secretly eat when alone   The additional 0 5 stars spicy pickled carrots  Because its crispy crunchy nature seemed fresh batch  pickles definitely made chicken torta more edible  Actually eating pickled carrots side chicken torta! Haha! <EOR> NO!! BAD ROBERTO!!  We should eaten here  There many good least decent Roberts' Las Vegas  possibly worst to   There no customers no music playing no employees first  One guy phone talking friend Spanish gave hand guesture wait minute    then must assumed understand Spanish he carried inappropriate conversation   The food bland boring   HOW F BURRITO'S??   I miss place <EOR> Whoa Nellie   really   a 1st review!  forever since seen me!  Roberto's Taco Shop very first places tried Mexican food when arrived UNLV 1996   Prior Maui many locals thought Taco Bell authentic ever gonna get   Boy taste buds surprised!  now many years later still keep Roberto's Taco Shop mind when want some cheap hearty Mexican eats   I'm guessing Roberto's fairly new because hasn't reviewed yet!  can't really find location website yet either   located same shopping center N  Decatur where Walmart is   also very close where Goldilocks bakery used reside which sadly now closed   Bring back pandesal!  Now gotta drive A$$ all way over Maryland Parkway Filipino pastry fix!  If you're fan Roberto's know standard Mexican fare   Yes realize many especially those really Mexican think Roberto's McDonald's Mexican food   yes realize much better Mexican food there   But damn easy find Roberto's near me!  Almost no matter where am town am able easily find Roberto's nearby   When Chipotle option Taco Bell Del Taco constantly give random cramping still urge some carne asada?  hit Roberto's no doubt   This Roberto's particularly clean I'm guessing because new bright color   Somehow color orange mixed lime green always reminds papayas   guess just works them   also read somewhere bright colors invite feelings hunger   Nice psychological marketing ploy Roberto's!  menu Roberto's also no different other ones town which welcoming because am pretty familiar menu     I know shouldn't but usually stick fattiest things find menu   Those things first fell love when Roberto's back day   Beware eating stuff daily basis raise cholesterol levels turn into Fatty McFat Fat!  please handle some restraint   family shared Carne Asada Nachos covered marinated steak tons fresh shredded cheese sour cream guacamole Carne Asada Quesadilla burrito sized tortilla folded loaded marinated steak more shredded cheese  Mind supposed snack!  two items easily filled four us   usual Carne Asada Nachos point tasty!  always laugh nachos come small layer nacho chips loaded meat cheese toppings   usually grab fork eat rest delicious carne asada   extra order chips   quesadilla good well   Oily sure but damn good   Meat Cheese Tortilla Repeat   Fat = Flavor notion Roberto's sticks!  I am also fan Roberto's rolled tacos tortas   Try lengua burrito some best damn tongue you've ever had!  Well relatively speaking   Yes tongue very good indeed   What also love Roberto's complimentary salsa bar   Load red green sauces but don't forget helpings fresh cut cucumbers radishes green onion pickled carrots!  All cleanse palette cool down senses   grab cup Horchata your Mexican meal   Refreshing!  Service friendly super fast   Prices very nice cheap definitely par other fast food joints to   Ole! <EOR>
