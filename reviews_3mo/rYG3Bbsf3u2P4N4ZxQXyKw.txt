Can't wait try whole menu  Staff super friendly vibrant just decor  <EOR> My review place based 3 visits myself two visits friend  first visit pretty good because steak eggs delicious  Paying 22 dollars steak eggs expectations high  2nd time ordered same thing but quality steak dramatically worse  want assumption steak frozen  20% steak gristle bone  decided come back 3rd time try same dish see if just off day 2nd visit  wrong  Same quality    frozen 20 30% gristle    If you're going charge 22 23 dollars steak eggs dont freeze meat sure its 20 30% gristle  steak should priced 14 bucks if quality gonna low   My friend came ordered brioche french toast said amazing  2nd visit he brought wife family friend  He ordered steak eggs initial experience it  Not 2nd 3rd He same complaint did but difference friend head chef hotel 17 years  He sent back steak because raw he ordered medium   manager back kitchen then came back started argue friend  point friend started yell manager because he wasn't asking another dish refund  He only wanted state cook back doesnt know cook proper steak  Anyways probably back more time try something else menu but just advised    if any complaint food theyll try look idiot instead apologizing asking if something else  Also don't order steak eggs    its over priced over rated  <EOR> I wondering around yelp trying find good place breakfast found place  Being vegetarian never ate Bachi burger but heard lot apparently same owners great spot    Their juices great carrot ginger awesome! food wise friend took frittata veggie scramble pretty perfect    I'll def back! <EOR> Horrible Service  Always looking good breakfast brunch place  reading all positive reviews Yelp decided give try last Sunday around 2 30pm    The quality food good prices little high  But isn't days  problem service  First waitress couldn't tell wife Miyagi burger  wife decides short rib pocho breakfast  waitress asks wife she wants eggs cooked but doesn't ask me    Once food brought wife requested additional napkins which never brought out  didn't see waitress again until 20 minutes later  She didn't stop ask if everything ok if needed refills drinks  She behind bar doing whatever she doing  Finally different waitress stopped check    While eating lady came into restaurant waited reception area which no at  She read menu 10 minutes when no showed seat she finally gave left    Maybe just having bad day  But restaurant only 1 4 full    Will back probably give then more try  <EOR> No negatives think of  Amazing food  Great service  Brioche French toast short rib loco moco winners  <EOR> Don't let name fool unhealthy yummy menu items outnumber healthy ones  While yes did see Acai bowl various juices smoothies menu would categorize them healthy restaurant  However never thought myself health nut place suited just fine!  Interior bright clean new looking  Service great love offer variety condiments jelly butters syrups    We ordered Beignets guava jelly jelly more purée but flavor excellent  Beignets light airy inside although lot flavor without jelly   Mango bread good but wished mango flavor stronger  Added guava jelly worked well together   Short rib loco moco saw popular other yelp reviews wanted give try  Overall very good  Supposedly braised 36 hrs but surprisingly tender expected  Fried rice gravy both flavorful  Little pricey $20 though   Strawberry banana ricotta pancakes also very good but eating all above only finished 1 3  Four large pancakes bananas strawberries top  chose almond butter maple syrup sides  Really liked slight crunch toasted ? graham cracker crumbs sprinkled top! <EOR> Food mediocre service bad  want note place small several servers during lunch time   place busy well   When came seated took server 10 minutes come order  ordered Monte Cristo side salad Oxtail Chili Scramble  When bf asked if he eggs cooked different way server immediately just said no  He didn't even say he ask chef    So food finally came 25 minutes  server brought plate Monte Cristo Oxtail Chili Scramble  few minutes server brought side salad container sauce  Since both salad sauce came together assumed salad dressing put salad   When asked extra dressing server said jam Monte Cristo Oh thanks making look stupid   did offer salad replacement but since pissed just said never mind  didn't eat salad since tasted funky jam    Both dishes bad that's 2 stars for   Monte Cristo came sweet potato fries exactly same taste Bachi Burger's sweet potato fries yuzu aioli sauce    When done bf asked box  waited waited    10 minutes another server came asked if need anything else said need box  Finally she brought out    Maybe give place another chance since just opened  Hopefully better service  <EOR> Food good best serve alcohol but there's no scene no outside seating uncomfortable seating  <EOR> First time food good but service slow  second time service still slow but then some juices wanted  figured would back third time even joked way them running items  time only service lacking but all fresh juices majority salads  11 30 morning couldn't believe much  When salads finally came chicken hard seemed old  also messed friends order  When told waitress concerns unhappy she brought check then disappeared  didn't even eat lunch payed $60 tab  disappointing never back  bad because excited new healthy food spot  <EOR> Nothing write home about  Tried corned beef skillet  didn't think possible but first place ever made taste good  soy sauce salty ness it  good mix  Side note manager shouldn't assume because your 120 Lb drinking diet soda  <EOR> Ate again June 2014  time coffee fresh say pretty good  Food amazing again funny location but worth trip  someone try ostrich burger another French toast  Give smoothies try many menu but tried most liked them all  <EOR> Really great high quality food   breakfast bloody mary's which very spicy definitely don't use pre made mix   Really enjoyed meal great service look forward future visit   service bit slow but any new restaurant it'll way first say don't them over especially if want support non chain type restaurants more unique pleasurable dining experiences  <EOR> Was pretty underwhelmed considering much love bachi burger  place definitely healthy create your omelette bf waffle    Meh all say   <EOR> I really excited try another new place Vegas  reviews great love Bachi Burger  food really good but 5 hours later really sick  corned beef hash cup coffee   bad because food really good  Now thought hash cringe   called manager just let them know  She said she would some researching call back  She didn't  No worries though  didn't want call but boyfriend insisted know   friend pancakes said good  She fine   PROS Creative corned beef hash recipe               Kona blend coffee  CONS Eating something really sick all night  <EOR> So sad give 3 stars but must  Loved menu such high hopes  Let start saying breakfast two ran $50  and smoothies liquor  So cheap but don't care if whole package  It's service killed it clearly understaffed running kitchen well  We waited over 50 minutes food when came forgot half accompaniments  manager did come apologize but didn't offer anything like smoothies sucked 50 minutes complimentary gesture  The food promise   hell whole place did   but let down   Also wasn't busy even half tables full  May give more try but they've know normally you've shot right  Spend extra $8 hour hire couple servers and take double check whose running kitchen  <EOR> I love Bachi Healthy Life kitchen!
