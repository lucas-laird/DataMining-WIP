Shout C F  mentioning spot Talk thread   friend today wasn't bad all!  ordered green curry beef $7 95 pad see lew chicken $6 95    also indulged Thai iced tea $2 00 which nice balance sweetness creaminess     While best really liked green curry   spice level 4 5 little bit added chili powder nice strong flavor no sweetness   wouldn't say character curry itself all unique interesting but nice liquidy strong one   added ingredients zucchini egg plant which very yummy very tender beef found myself going back seconds!  The pad see lew like ew? wasn't favorite but still good   bit sweeter saucier perhaps much teriyaki prefer   sliced carrots American Chinese broccoli cabbage even single piece bok choy  wished more bok choy though   All meat veggies fresh nicely prepared   Although definitely edible prefer drier version dish wouldn't order again     I safely give spot 3 star review but may better that   lunch menu pretty small ordered off dinner menu   pretty simple standard Thai menu nothing really stood other places noticed   prices just right pretty much everything $7 10 range dinner entrees  <EOR> Stopped quick lunch Service great nice professional courteous Food delicious love thai curry tried dozens thai places all around best curries had! prices very affordable also deliver  good simple place delicious food  Will back sure! <EOR>
