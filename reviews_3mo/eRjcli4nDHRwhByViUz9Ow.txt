Okay Let just say    I'm sure if food poisoning coincidentally came down stomach bug 4 hours eating pizza     but 36 hour adventure toilet bathroom floor can't say willing give place another shot    not mention pizza really wasn't even worth misery   So pizza itself  spinach trio comes spinach tomato feta cheese   thin crust pizza waaaaaayyyyyyy much mozzarella thing  cheese least 1 4 inch think  wouldn't problem appropriate thickness crust  poor thin crust just couldn't hold all cheese floppy soggy  also strange smokey flavor pizza which just don't get  Plus hardly any spinach all pizza    On plus side girl working counter very peppy nice    So if your going try place recommend skipping spinach trio   maybe feta poisoned me     good luck hope better experience I    if you're brave type  <EOR>
