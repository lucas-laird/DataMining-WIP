some hamburger steak sip some amazing Columbian coffee   I'm torn between 4 stars 5 stars  Comfort food should inexpensive but Cafe de Japon definitely pricey side  Dinner entree's start $10 portions small for American palettes   If just few dollars cheaper per entree I'd probably weekly visit  <EOR> Again am listening fellow Yelpers trusting opinions food   Maybe taste buds developed    tell where am going right?  food just okay   didn't wow me   looking place wow taste buds   everyone recommended omelet chicken fried rice hubby Japanese Hamburg   omelet wasn't special fried rice tasty enough   If tastier fried rice home why am paying $13 dish?  no flavor   bit more seasonings please    cost food gone but soy sauce still pretty cheap     As Hamburg first bite very good but sauce became sour first few bites   into sour hamburger patties     I am giving place 2 stars because place well decorated very comfortable inside ketchup omelet best thing ate night   ketchup special but bad rest food lacked it  <EOR> The rating should $$$ prices   Went because eblasts Raku Chef Owner Mitsuo Endo recommended fellow carpenter friends' place Cafe de Japon  just opened when small crowd point family only customers    OK Hamberg Japanese style tasty especially enjoyed it  two patties potatoes carrots  Good flavor daikon every bite seemed more hungry if sense  doesn't come rice $3 extra small dish yea came dish bowl   very weird   and fact rice extra wow   $13 meal $16  Wait   there's more   I also yuzu juice citrus fruit which good but $5  came medium sized glass lots ice bottom menu reads no refills except iced tea  Two sips drink half full   crazy   $21 then   My family Hamberg demiglaze egg a special okay $13 Hayashi rice beef stew good $9 wife curry at $9 think   curry disappointing   the spice great but something didn't taste right   maybe we're just used Curry House's L A  flavor even Ichiza's? just seemed muddled  also crab pasta croquette which came two pieces shrimp nothing write home just fried food     For desert chocolate strawberry parfait $8 coffee jello can't remember $5 6 then wanted try siphon coffee $5   deserts weren't special enough really ask those prices  Ichiza serves more unique Japanese deserts honey toast  worth it  coffee? very good  thought going bring siphon over table but just plopped over cup   think could've gained more points presentation if did that  UCC Coffee L A  comes mind tasted blue mountain beans    So  worth it? food good but VERY EXPENSIVE was  bill $97  know ordered lot but should've half cost  Touting cafe which suppose casual prices really meant higher end Japanese joints  example Raku  only imagine owners Japon highly influenced Raku's owner since friends but same caliber  saying food isn't good but ask prices what's offered? would rather Ichiza Spring Mountain Kyara Jones    It's bad I'd often coffee if wasn't expensive  fair new maybe they're just testing structure still  If you're listening prices should $2 3 less each item includes DRINK MENU!!!   think more people flock if case  <EOR> Simple food done very well   some reason expecting larger menu variety  Instead limited selection well crafted  far most people praised hamburg steak hayashi rice chef's salad tororin omelet tried something different  garlic beef $9 99 impressive  Thinly sliced beef marinaded soy sauce base sauteed onions garlic until tender then plated large helping grated cabbage  comes salad start plate rice meal  leave before food arrived take important call gone 25 minutes  When came back food still warm  waitress worried gone cold but must scolding when first came because retained temperature well  serving size plentiful friend helping herself  came back late try vegetable curry $6 99   She must enjoyed because even bite left me  am beginning think close your eyes choose end delicious meal   Being outside long chugged down water  waitress must refilled eight times  Cafe de Japon employees attentive quick friendly  <EOR> Stopped new spot based referral friend did dissapoint!  place same plaza Cathay House Spring Mountain used korean restaurant didn't well apparently   Being new still half restaurant closed off owner former sushi chef Sushi Roku informed he making Paris themed area possible karaoke fun! I lunch ordered special which home made hamburger steak stew gravy fried egg side scalloped potatoes  also gave side white rice   dish served sizzling skillet delicious   Hamburger steak cooked perfectly nice juicy   stew gravy made want try stew complete dish fried egg top   YUM    The coffees serve brewed few different ways depending like   way slowly brewing coffee which apparently takes 5 hours no acidity   Ask coffee menu inquire options  Service pleasant very attentive never having wait anything  I back curry which cooked without water ? made fresh daily   can't wait see place finished completely may regular places visit especially flexible schedule    Mon Thurs 12p 12a Fri Sat 12p 2a!!!!!

Maybe home made tonkasu sauce? Add some  basic veggies curry?   Plus lunch menu serve bit over priced   Not sure well place does night but def  lunch place IMO   The salad dressing best part and reason gave two instead one   <EOR> Please come try new place  hidden germ busy Vegas  U feel relaxed soon u step in  food typical japanese food serve strip n china town  dont sushi  food hearty n yummy homemade food  <EOR> Great place lunch  garlic beef Katsu curry Pasta favs  Coffee amazing desserts nanners   try it  trust me  <EOR> You know you're treat when Superman behind counter apron   This cute little cafe same plaza Cathay House Rincon de Buenos Aires  When walk you're greeted now familiar irasshaimase  found way tables along outside wall beneath row hand prints plaster   Among three shared some Karaage $5 plate Vegetable Curry Rice $6 99 Tororin Omelet $9 99   guess we're fans Japanese curry because weren't very impressed curry rice mostly heat very much flavor  hoping anomaly   On bright side Karaage extremely flavorful chicken cooked perfectly tender and piping hot inside   Tororin Omelet also extremely good  kind looked gigantic piece tamago sushi  omelet itself still runny inside forewarned if turns off   As drinks only ordered something  Reading reviews Christopher Philip T intrigued siphon coffee give try initially ordering Calpico opening it   brewing process looks chemistry set http www yelp com biz_photos O85iR6k pDHpRFwXlppdSw?select=bpdXofQNObyw5hqrmFgV1A   coffee connoisseur any stretch but definitely worth ordering  some cream sugar flavor coffee very smooth   Based limited experience fan Cafe de Japon  think just sucker cute places this  food good family feel  <EOR>
