My husband made own sushi burrito decided own nachos which pretty disappointed chicken  flavorless tasted came frozen package    would've much better if katsu chicken marinaded grilled chicken similar Mochiko's grilled chicken    In case true sushi burrito place order chicken nachos!

Seating limited if come during busy hour might find seat  prepared take just case! <EOR> Wow! place amazing!!

Think sushi meets burritos meets chipotle  create your own burrito bowl salad ingredients such spicy tuna yellowtail steak chicken shrimp tempura guacamole lettuce cucumbers jalapeños tempura crunch wonton crisps more  If aren't feeling creative select burrito options  Again chipotle style compete control over does does into your meal    We ordered twin dragon three S's burritos  three S's bit much sauce but tasty  If ordered again would tell them easy sauce  preferred twin dragon which little lighter sauce delicious    We Saturday night around 6pm steady stream patrons  There's lot seating area restaurant but didn't seem issue  Many people taking order go  Service quick efficient considering number people    Overall if sushi place definitely worth trip  If there's people line don't let discourage shouldn't take long  <EOR> A few people know love place curious see hype about  decided build your own burrito  pretty much based off 3 Amigos but modified liking    I * Sushi Rice Wrap  * Meat Ahi Tuna $7 50 Fresh Salmon additional meat = $1 5 * Sides Toppings free no limit Cilantro Corn Red Onion Tempura Crunch Crispy Wonton Strips Cucumber Furikake   * Sauce Wasabi Aioli  * Extra Cream Cheese 50 cents Total = $10 29  [PROS] * satisfied w order  yummy filling  * cream cheese totally worth made even better * fish fresh serve generous amount * They're open Sundays now  bummed closed Sundays but now they're open definitely plan eating  church something  [CONS] * menu little overwhelming just looking especially newbie   But once concept pretty cool unique * bit messy dirty inside  Although near closing time little bothered messy was * quite loud inside  sure if music just acoustics restaurant but speak louder normal conversation w party * Although enjoyed roll tasted no different regular sushi hand roll   But just wrapped size burrito  I'd definitely back try Asada create non traditional sushi roll  Maybe that'll give true experience Jaburrito aka Soho Sushi Burrito <EOR> Amazing! line door  order off menu create your own  flavors legit fresh  burrito through two meals $10 50 price extra awesome  toro chips cheese   There's some sort fine lime sugar seasoning put chips causes addiction issue don't fight against  Just  place happy dance just thinking it  <EOR> Pros AMAZING food decently priced super friendly service customizable great bring friends town to Cons pretty crowded peak times even random times day    but worth wait!  I recommend Everything good but absolute favorite Sunny Salmon Twin Dragon Triple that taro chips cheese new spam musubi burrito!  I LOVE place  Love it  crave regularly  bring friends town here  tell many people place  just great  fan since Jaburritos days although tweaked recipes tiny bit still absolutely fantastic    For price portion absolutely huge  Think it sushi roll average sushi restaurant least $10    price could JUMBO roll sushi burrito form! aren't skimpy when they're making your burrito either  want happy!  The service friendly polite  write which burrito which once wrapped no need worry if you're ordering multiples  haven't made own burrito yet because premade ones much  new spam musubi burrito amazing well  Don't forget order some taro chips register!   I nothing negative say food service  something everyone if don't fish meat tofu veggie option if don't seaweed soy wrap option etc etc   place amazing if sushi haven't hit place yet missing out plain simple  <EOR> Good food but long wait food  boyfriend tried later 7 30 dinner   We waited half hour before ordered  Food phenomenal worth wait! <EOR> Now know all hype about   Clearly sushi burrito grabbed attention  Why wouldn't it?!!??   First off confused name some since yelp other patrons told called something else but cleared confusion finally found it  place little hard find because all construction but sure only temporary    The place chipotle  pick burrito bowl nachos etc    then top you're choice protein  New thing vurrito wrapped seaweed  wide selection sushi sauces fun  add your choice sauce vegetables salsas end  Interesting say least    I tried yellowtail spicy tuna ponzu sauce  burrito tad slim side but overall bad  am bit interested other sushis back    Service par did arrive busy time maybe played factor it  Nonetheless really cool concept!
