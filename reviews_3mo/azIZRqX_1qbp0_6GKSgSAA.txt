Ahhh second review it  Japonais did impress me  starters ordered Bloody Mary wasabi shochu ok   The sushi didn't care only because sushi all over  visit strictly hot foods  consumme eh   not best  citrus taste made little bitter  Lobster spring rolls    definitely good mango relish  isn't using trendy mango relish nowadays? Mango salsa mango relish  Yea real creative  There's blood orange vinaigrette really didn't care for  Eh there's gotta more it   wagyu beef cut japanese clay pot   Ok lime cooked it  5 little pieces beef    Hmmm right     Well most culinarians know if cook citrus wanna add citrus last because your dish bitter when cook extended times  Le Quack Japonais    Hmmm kinda version Peking duck    with mango chutney  Hmmm original  ok  dish also something wasn't new imaginative  good  wasn't GREAT! If want fancy fusion  Yes try if budget it  quite impressed menu  ambiance nice  seems tables little close though  flat rock thing steak novelty item  didn't fact tried order steamed rice ordeal  over all 5 things  2 dishes ok ambiance nice thinkin 1 2 stars    I'll round down  <EOR> Wow!
