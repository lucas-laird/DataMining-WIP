Having tired spending copious amounts money food during stay Las Vegas friends decided take walk try find something bit cheaper eventually ending food court within Caesar's Palace  Although two friends eyes set Chinese food drawn into Lobster Chowder Company menu fried seafood goodness   Although menu first appeared decently priced soon realized time ordered drink meal quickly shot $11 $17 talk outrageous price fountain drink  Being hungry however seeing friends already ordered decided bite bullet oder picking fish chips    After receiving food pleasantly surprised find least received hearty helping food freshly prepared something did expect  However even surprising quality food cannot bump review Lobster Chowder Company past two stars  restaurant simply expensive get  coupled fact take absolutely forever your order <EOR> Long wait substandard overpriced food   Saved lunch just try them particularly lobster roll   lobster roll served buttered brioche bread roll which just doesn't taste right horrible   lobster meat chopped into tiny pieces copious amounts mayonnaise celery point no lobster flavor definitely no texture   bread coated butter pan fried which produces oily sloppy mess   failure sandwich disappointment   Also tried lobster chowder bread bowl which ok but way overpriced little amount get   friend ordered shrimp po boy which bad well   shrimp battered deep fried then served hot dog roll good all   Why refused serve lobster salad bread roll never know we did ask chef refused      The sandwiches come fries coleslaw combo $6 which means add drink  WTH?  If comes fries anyway aren't just paying $6 drink then?  Better strategy would another spot order drink separately since all come same coke fountain anyway   ordered coleslaw because friend fries fries anyway   20 min wait food didn't want back exchange   Bottom line walk across street Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead good lobster roll  <EOR>
