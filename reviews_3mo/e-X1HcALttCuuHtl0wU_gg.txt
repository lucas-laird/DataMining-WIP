Usually place OK  Don't try ask any questions won't any meaningful answers  Food Great  favorite thing diversity options compared other mexican places  location usually filled business casual people  completely packed lunch  Now Tortilla soup go  $3 comes small cup leaves worst taste your mouth    Stick burritos  <EOR> I enjoy food here  Straightforward concept Chipotle like  am big fan nachos here  three cheese sauce delicious little spice  enjoy salsa always seemed fresher competitors  burritos pretty standard always consistent  only real concern veggie nachos veggie burritos pay more fajita veggies rice only nachos   Seriously? am already getting meat which means already cheaper make  Other place stay rotation   This Qdoba always very clean really busy service typically pretty decent  <EOR>
