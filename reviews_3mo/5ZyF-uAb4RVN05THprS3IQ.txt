Just okay Tropical Smoothie but when you're Excalibur looking something quick you're left fast food choices   location upstairs rest fast food restaurants   am fan Tropical Smoothie chain   order same almost everytime   their Pesto Chicken Flatbread   Service location bad especially since most people hitting McDonalds Krispy Kremes   One plus   they open 24 hours stay open really late   midnight still open  <EOR> The chicken salad sandwich great!  could done without smoothie   expected better since smoothie name   Mango magic couldn't taste any mango   located Excalibur food court good alternative fast food places side  <EOR>
