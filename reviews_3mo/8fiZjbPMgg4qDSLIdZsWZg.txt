The neighborhood very sketchy plaza where restaurant located even sketchier  owners however done admirable if cheesy job decorating storefront Sunshine Cafe   Once walk inside your senses immediately assaulted smell greasy spoon diner coupled noxious colors 1970s  artwork walls kitschy reminds some might call classy  The food surprisingly good! French Toast they serve breakfast all day while several others table BLT someone else fish chips  Everyone really enjoyed food  some reason bacon tastes REALLY good here  staff friendly provide good service  party six under hour   If aren't looking fancy neighborhood definitely would recommend visit  fun atmosphere looks if forgotten time  prices excellent food better then you'd similar place IHOP Blueberry Hill  <EOR>
