Well not  Unremarkable best way describe it  more thing second half burger ice cold time finished first first half piping hot anything but ice cold?  The bar menu no section distilled spirits despite name another thing gentleman sitting next thought curious  did coffee infused whiskey part signature Manhattan but if didn't read description drink would never known offer unusual item  asked bartender coffee infused whiskey before could even finish sentence he returns TWO shots curious liquid gentleman just met then charged BOTH them tab  Wow really?  If opening restaurant enviable western valley location personally would avoided poker machines  But then goal would wow patrons good food service rather just open another smoky gambling hall   In all food great service needs little well delicacy place sure overflowing men but thought okay  <EOR> On recent trip Vegas found ourselves looking local place Summerlin dinner  ended across Red Rock Distill  We seated ourselves patio enjoy sunshine  welcomed quickly Erin drinks flash   We decided order appetizers settled mashed potato balls homemade poppers   The manager brought them introduced himself   Bar food but really really good!!! try poppers We then ordered another round six pack assorted sliders  appetizers served diligently quality ingredients tasted amazing  A free whiskey shot full belly later  again spoke Tony manager  although local made feel extremely welcome   We felt people really care customer   During next  trip Red Rock visit Distill again  <EOR> Got bourbon?  So bite drink night few mates thought would try Distill  no real expectations strolled fairly busy bar  brewery style decor lounges table seating pool tables very nice large bar boot Distill great setting groups sit down meal   Checking yelp you'll grab Distill bar infused Bourbon house  bartender gave pretty sweet Coffee infused bourbon diet coke  gonna say pretty nice drop if little sweet recommend it   For dinner ordered some mash potato bites app!!! Order them! amazing  dinner six pack sliders!!! mix combo different sliders  Ruben cheeseburger Philly cheese steak  All pretty tasty   Id give place 5 stars but maybe because full hard find seat didn't full experience  sure place come back nice watering hole lot people <EOR> Not fan Very slow service little attention did server good  food marginal best pizza bland crust doughy  <EOR> Was excited place open  space thought would great place watch games  taken several friends everyone said same thing couldn't believe allow smoking  Today overheard another couple say same thing right walked in  few people said doubt would ever back  very disappointing  lunch again today  move two times away smoke  could great place  day where smokers options why does non smoker exposed miserable experience? Management should reconsider policy  Doubt back unless becomes smoke free  <EOR> Really slow service  when both empty crowded both times still slow service  Waiter staff very friendly no personality barely talk you  <EOR> Came delicious dinner Echo Rig fell love place!

First all having local bar summerlin rare when saw distill openings walking distance house excited  when show during week dinner took 20 minutes water another 10 mins server realize even then another 15 mins drink  food decent forget asking refills because takes another 10 mins  Plan going weekends? Well did took just long drink  waitress forgot when she finally realized ordered drinks she made another waitress serve us  sad cool urban bar just another waste space <EOR> Good food fast Friday night Chicken sandwich bomb chili surprisingly good  Forgot check free whiskey  Damn it  Next time sure   We sat back pool tables but see rest bar patio awesome  come back  least visit weird bathrooms  Although say men's room very dirty when there  <EOR> Had great time!! back cinnamon orange infused whiskey awesome!! Brian great bartender pores great drink!! smokey really good bar food!! must check out!!! <EOR> Crystal great Deena   Great venue killer happy hour   Place great before Red Rock trip hold its own your spot night   Menu huge generous portions extremely reasonably priced  <EOR> First time came Yelp event purely enjoyed  Came last night see regular night  vibe very relaxed  bar seemed pretty packed  But able sit yourself dining area  Someone automatically brings menu lets know server us   Erin server night  automatically checked into Yelp redeemed free whiskey shots  also ordered Mad Mule $10 which served Yelp event Cinnamon Apple Sour $7  Apple sour sour side extremely strong  whiskey shots came coffee cinnamon flavored  Yuck! Those drinks did job done alright!  For food Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip $9 99  very very very very bland  didn't enough cheesiness  shrimp didn't blend well other ingredients  lot chips enough dip   Street tacos $7 99  shredded chicken usual contents comes taco  chipotle dressing top  pretty good  Still nothing made want order again    New York Steak Eggs $11 99  beau said good cooked perfect  came hash browns  choose between English muffin toast  tasted tasted regular steak ¯\_ ? _ ¯   French toast $7 99  beau also French Toast guess he hungry   excellent  Probably best thing ate last night  light fluffy    Erin server very attentive  She came checked every often  She nice lots personality  When asked if change channel TV next she said she would but she never did but didn't big deal it  Other bummer she charged free yelp check shots  course told beau look itemized billing ALWAYS course he said he did but really didn't men! just signed life away  Later looked bill charged them *insert angry face* <EOR> I high hopes great place work   food disappointing outright bad   free coffee infused whiskey shot Yelp disgusting keep it    plus side people bartender great fun!  Maybe try something else when eat there  <EOR> I Distill twice  Both times sat bar   first girlfriend happens margarita's   bartender greeted introduced himself then gave Happy Hour menu which consisted 3 house wines limited cocktails VERY limited food chips salsa discount WOW! bartender convinced friend try famous fresh squeezed margarita cost $10  Not Happy Hour menu    drink tart bitter she could drink it   bartender replaced drink glass wine charged both!  The second time took dad loves good hang bar   bartender again greeted introduced himelf shook hands then promptly disappeared never seen again   took 10 minutes next bartender see did any drinks ask would like   happy hour offer draft beers $3   dad ordered instead bartender asking Would large additional $1 25? brought large one   did order appetizer but since Happy Hour menu limited ordered Calamari off regular menu   very good served mango sirracha sauce dipping   asked little extra sauce then found charged it!  don't always pay Distill pay everything!! <EOR> I agree add more gaming machines place busy bar  <EOR> I really enjoyed night here! happened night 80's costume party  DJ amazing atmosphere  only  those parties once year  drink options great appetizers  good! Service good just hard find seating  visit again soon!! <EOR> Been lunch dinner really does feel local joint opposed those done Vegas bars   Cure burger nice though buns little large compared rest burger   Steak tacos nice amount marinated flank steak which might owe itself better fajita carne asada platter  <EOR> We excited try new place then very quickly disappointed  appetizer shrimp artichoke dip bland lacked flavor traded dip salsa     No better  All taste pepper again no other flavors  then ordered street tacos     dry issues actually swallowing chicken  BF Distilled chicken sandwich  when found all salt lacking other dishes  top off waitress bit angry personality  Sadly b returning here  atmosphere ok  <EOR> Place smells bit smokey  waitress nice quick   Overall first time experience wasn't Wow factor   beers weren't cold  Enough said! <EOR> Fast friendly service  Great local bar but still more upscale feel  dive bar  <EOR> Went other day say impressed  walked loved atmosphere right away  loved decor vibe restaurant however actual dining experience extremely poor  waited long time drinks ask multiple times waters while waited which still didn't come until food arrived  didn't receive ordered but chose say anything just pick through did want   I suspect food service sub par some reason but definitely ruined first experience sure willing try again  <EOR>
