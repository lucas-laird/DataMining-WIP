Typical   Late night     drive thru kinda sucks!  order first window not through speaker but window   so time second window if aren't any cars front you then you're just waiting them your food  So sitting 10 minutes minimum 20 minutes  Not really fast food if ask but sometimes MCD's just fills craving   especially drunk partying strip all night long its time just head back unwind ! <EOR> Verrazano certainly cut above though  fresh mozzarella pizza delicious nice thin crust just right amount cheese  <EOR>
