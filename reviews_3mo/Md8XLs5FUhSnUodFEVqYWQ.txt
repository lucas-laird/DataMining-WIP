See Note Below It's tough pizza Las Vegas but Carmine's Pizza Kitchen great!! son lunch there  pizza large thin crust great taste well done requested  No tomato chunks sauce wasn't extra spicy most Vegas pizza  Quick service  going back soon   NOTE Sep 2011 place new owners Carmines any more pizza good when Carmines!! Review adjusted  <EOR> I've driven Carmine's thousand times finally decided try out  called some pizza delivered other night  10 cheese pizza 10 vegetarian mushrooms peppers black olives tomatoes onions   third party deliver pizza pay person separately  $2 plus tip  didn't take long pizza arrive surprisingly wasn't soggy all  crust thin crispy outside chewy inside  Both pizzas very good  veggies looked fresh based varying sizes tomato slices guessing use fresh ingredients  pizza could used more mushrooms but overall delicious  little pricey  over $20 two small pizzas  but quality very good  <EOR>
