Visited Tropicana intent eating Carla Pellegrino's Bacio but closed  downstairs Pellegrino Pizza Deli beacuse read good review pizza  Then changed mind bought hamburger  Best decision ever made Vegas! didn't tell them wanted burger cooked medium well  size normal 1 4lb  Didn't seem much $6 burger but taste excellent! Fresh lettuce tomatoes grilled bun pickle carrot spears side  French fries would another $4 upgraded $5 onion rings  Another best decision! Big fluffy battered 'rings dipped bbq sauce  All cooked perfectly none burned  basically paid typical $12 casino burger but best fast food meals ever town  Other places want care more burger's size rather falvor  Pellegrino decided emphasize quality over quanity couldn't more satisfied  only drawback alone  While burger normal size basket onion rings large enough shared  almost cried when threw away leftover 'rings but just couldn't eat them all  pizza slices looked normally see home town but course wasn't able taste them  saw other people very delicious looking sandwiches  Bacio supposed open next week little deli definitely made good impression  Staff also nice friendly  Thanks Carla! <EOR> Awful pizza    bought $4 slice terrible  Salty dry burnt  No good  <EOR> This place appears open 24 hours  menu items seem very reasonably priced including pizzas soups salads  didn't really want leave Tropicana during stay seemed gravitate towards place  people work seemed quite friendly  would definitely stop place again if staying Tropicana  <EOR>
