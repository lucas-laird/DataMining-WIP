The past week slaving away kitchen ready eat out  run some errands while driving saw big billboard sign Jack Box Oh Yeah! but then instantly sad when didn't see immediately around    Nevertheless kept driving look ahead see Jack Box   quickly look over shoulder move over 3 lanes quickly pull into driveway  No other drivers hurt should mention   I hot tired drive thru was  two tacos special running All American Combo $4 99 said why it  don't typically purchase burgers Jack Box wasn't sure expect   Randy name fella serviced me  He polite cordial very friendly  When he asked if order screen correct told couldn't read he didn't feel bad give fuss he politely repeated order me  Then when window he takes payment he hands back card explains he going close window but food being prepared ready momentarily   I think jaw hit ground  completely amazed EXCELLENT customer service  know when drive thru feel more inconvenience employee rather paying customer rude when just shut window don't say anything?
