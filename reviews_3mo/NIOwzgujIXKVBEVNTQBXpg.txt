Always big fan Jjanga work over original location down Spring Mountain Rd  heard through grapevine he expanded opened second restaurant over west side  Even more intriguing fact he taken over Kanji restaurant which known teppanyaki  group headed over check new place recently suffice say all good    hood!  Jjanga located west side over near Fort Apache Warm Springs  taken over space formerly known Kanji Steak Sushi  But retained teppanyaki location even if mood sushi your onion volcano fix here  interior definitely very cool classy  probably more upscale sushi spots town  If teppan route side restaurant very fun exciting   But oh let talk sushi because something should definitely miss on  Jjanga and also different restaurant top two favorite ayce sushi spots Vegas  He uses lot fresher product most other places he would willing send anything isn't standards  cuts fish used nigiri thick rice portions small   big plus me  rice cooked really well here  personally big fan rolls but Jjanga does some good ones  group ordered some able sample few conclusion really good all flavors balancing each other and also Jjanga probably best salmon skin hand roll town    A lot people take apps granted when sushi restaurant  would urge look over apps Jjanga because would missing out  Because same care quality he chefs put into sushi same great quality care being put into appetizers  first thing must order golden scallop  thick meaty whole scallop lightly battered simply fried  great way start your meal  baby octopus textural sensation chewiness octopus offsetting crispiness preparation  save yourself room oyster  would icing cake! But try all apps sure won't disappointed      Jjanga killing original location only sense expand due growing popularity  skill eye level detail caring guests without question  No doubt back always bring people want some great quality sushi great chef  Thanks Jjanga!! <EOR> Jjanga favorite sushi place  sushi only excellent but experience customer service employees place shine  Sushi chef Sponge served most recent visits making rolls alway exceed expectations  tried Vampire Taste ex girlfriend chu chu riceless roll spicy tuna only $3!!!!! few others  menu prices now changed Jjanga now more affordable ever!! place alway clean friendly bright yet personal always such wonderful experience staff  Ellen fun feel staff Jjanga family  coming often even before prices changed now Jjanga easily affordable several times week! $21 three HEAPING rolls? #sold  Don't walk run  won't regret it  <EOR> Sushi fresh delicious  Jjanga wonderful host making sure everyone best experience possible  service outstanding tappen smells wonderful although didn't tonight  <EOR> The ambience upscale zen but once you're inside better ready some fun! hibachi tables chefs front sushi bar seating side  isn't your average sushi place where all squished room  very spacey gives your more privacy  followed Jjanga each restaurants plan continuing tradition until end time  sushi fresh accomodate your tastes  first time doing hibachi birthday can't wait! Clean friendly staff great food! <EOR> This place awesome! staff amazing! If you're west side town must stop by! sushi best town drinks best!! experience kind! <EOR> The food awesome!  Lots vegan options me   Fairly cheap amount food potentially all eat    The servers always polite fast food comes fairly quickly    I'd give 5 stars but we're usually greeted when come in   4 times only greeted door once   All other times stand several minutes waiting acknowledged  <EOR> BEST AYCE FAR  My big sis told grand opening fort apache location jan  31st 6 AYCE! decor location PRETTY! Very open spaced high ceilings felt elegant nice AYCE dining experience    We meet owner JJANGA he also sushi chefs! All staff very friendly all very helpful  All sushi ordered came very quickly although UNI then guess just shows fresh things are  Becuase also ended running halibut well ahahha They definately accommodated well becuase allowed order more beef tataki  place uni   The only concern hot foods came little bit warm rather hott but assume those just some kinks worked future  Definately can't wait try habachi side restaurant!

Sushi wise good but best  course AYCE can't expect best quality but quality ok  wasn't freshest but wasn't worst  There's huge variety rolls appetizers pretty quick getting orders  rice fish ratio standard rolls weren't over sauced    Overall would come back convenience factor service  going best sushi ever but fairly good  teppanyaki well if rather raw fish  fairly big place if there's ever wait don't see being extremely long  <EOR> I visited Jjanga back when Kanji sushi  time came Hibachi Valentine's Day  did reservation miracle party six able hibachi within 30 minutes  awesome hibachi chef  He hilarious put awesome show  food great no shortage! house sangria delicious house made sake sampler  also did 2 rounds sake bombs! personally think tastes better plain cold sake but flavored isn't bad either  Benja awesome took great care us! <EOR> This place $#%t! Awesome!!! freshest fish! Great people etc etc  followed guy third location JJanga bomb!!! Love places  Just go! <EOR> The quality food bad price  table 8 3 doing AYCE while other 5 ordered La Carte  Two things really bothered 1 When ordering AYCE 2 3 ordered when told server think enough now  However 3rd person still wanted add 3 more orders sushi but server repeated same thing without saying did 3 extra order  first round finished he acted really surprise finished when told going ordering lot but definitely finish  want people ordering food wasting finishing  If he said he did during second round ordering then would understand but during first round? No  If did order much did finish he told once then charge waste no need repeat  Needless say finished everything    2 constantly person perhaps manager always walking table  Yes wanted sure no ordering AYCE sharing those ordered La Carte but walk many times? He might well sat down watched eat    Overall quality food good but service needs improvement  There's more subtle ways doing did say  Also asked extra sake cup napkins numerous times before things requested  times put La Carte items side 3 AYCE people sitting  even grouped ourselves things easier them serve monitor as doing but did work out  <EOR> Fabulous place!  Jjanga's food best   never bad experience there   travel Vegas 4 6 times year always eat Jjanga's <EOR> Updated Review!!!

Oh don't worry though! They're same price though  Don't worry  Thanks?   I also ordered squid nigiri spicy salmon roll  Another waiter come asking if would check  mentioned missing items apparently never put in  look confusion passes over waiter's chef's face few moments  He says Oh! put salmon roll came but waited 20 minutes squid just ended asking check  original waitress came back asked if wanted anything else asked squid again chef never check squid asked them remove paid left   This probably worst dining experiences ever but If enjoy sh*tty service mildly rude waitresses JJANGA place you! <EOR> Great service greeted seated immediately  Great chef chef Jim hilarious very entertaining  Atmosphere welcoming charming  Very casual classy  Hands down back asap! <EOR> I never prefer location original  such mediocre experience server asking several different occasions ordered and then forget put order in sad little pieces fish misshapen rolls  know everyone start somewhere but seems none sushi chefs experienced  <EOR> Where hell place been?
