Nathan's hot dogs outside Coney Island different story original   stopped dog yesterday most annoying thing happened  know when bottom bun rips?  Yeah both dogs problem which means buns fresh   find Nathan's across street NYNY much better previous trip   But none comes close original location  <EOR> I've Nathan's dogs Coney Island yonks ago  don't think going back anytime soon meantime dogs do   We've come back several times snacks whether early late snack always line location  guess if you're staying hotel then just sense place   I agree buns aren't great if dogs thicker would even better  However nothing comes close snap Nathan's hot dogs even though most time try resist dogs eat somewhere else end having bite two dog  fries seriously addictive but must say damn expensive get   3 5 stars <EOR>
