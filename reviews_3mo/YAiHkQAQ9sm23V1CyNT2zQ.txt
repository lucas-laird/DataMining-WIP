We Onyx fine dining part building beer pairing dinner   Decent looking room all though lit wrong   The service friendly but food simply awful   understand hard put dinner 50 people but crossed line    waited hour between third fourth courses then didn't want eat lamb   Our other courses consisted short rib basically beef jerky steak salad swimming dressing while managing most lettuce dry store bought brownie watery vanilla sauce   The highlight night when waiter came over took picture told looked wanted punch someone    response He's probably wearing chef's jacket <EOR>
