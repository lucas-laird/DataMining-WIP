Just barely opened soft opening friend decided check place out  Over 215 Decatur its fancy 2 story building Orleans style facade patios  Once inside foyer looks home winding staircase greets you  interior sort typical low wood paneling pale white ivory walls  Wide selection wines available could seen though glass full bar  blackened catfish red beans rice which good some fried oysters which average  Everything reasonably priced service OK some nervousness  worth trying again back  <EOR> Ate Rhythm tuesday girl daughter  understand they've open less week    I've intrigued place since started building last year thought building unusual location thought going office building wrong !   When finally saw sign saying steaks seafood thinking great local spot frequent  But time open move but still drive often gotta try it    I little surprised lay open dining area tables close together no booths per se tables damn small ! entire upstairs banquet area good luck !   We order several apps Crawfish tails $8 99 alligator tails $9 29 calamari $11 29 Charbroiled oysters $9 79 overall very average  calamari way over priced get  oysters decent challenge anyone taste crawfish tails blindfolded guess much coating small lil niblets    We also shared seafood gumbo bowl $6 79 daughter impressed she tried first burnt roux WOW ! she actually listened years making gumbo tried next she's right see lil flakes black gumbo bitter  still served ??!?   I bbq ribs $16 99 includes 2 sides mushrooms asparagus loved sides love butter cream ! ribs meat good sauce little sweet strong molasses flavor Daughter tried salmon $16 79 spinach mushrooms good    The girl ordered Seafood delight rice broccoli $15 29 basically shrimp catfish believe oysters cream sauce delicious !   We shared bananas foster $8 79 bad but damn expensive !   had nola beer abida very tasty $5 75 Overall toss gotta give them little time work kinks think pricing might little high  Definitely try again month see if they've improved  wish them all luck   Happy Eating !   pics posted <EOR>
