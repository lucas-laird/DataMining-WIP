Looked promising first  4 people ahead line when there  Menus printed color nice paper don't displayed walls  Decided Orange Chicken lunch special since price wasn't bad $5 95  also ordered Vegetable Egg Rolls  going try smoothies but didn't look very good those machines  weren't mixed very well  paid order told would 10 minute wait  No problem since cooking everything fresh I think    Took home pretty disappointed  Orange Chicken bland sauce seemed chunky old something  know bad when Panda Express serves better Orange Chicken! egg rolls weren't very good either  hot crispy but bland well even sweet sour sauce  Again know bad when Panda Express better egg rolls!!  Stay away! Unless ok tasteless Chinese food! <EOR> People very friendly food excellent  guy even gave more coupons even though just used coupon!!  never happened before  am glad live close going back soon We lunch special 5 95 enough food feed two people easily     and eat lot!
