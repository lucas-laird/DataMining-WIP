I live around corner place high hopes   First say place looks very nice inside   keep very clean staff seems friendly   Both times saw owners come ask everyone food the reason give place two stars instead one    As food most horrible each time   chicken marsala wine used sauce bitter couldn't finish it   Chicken marsala favorite dishes many times honestly say worst chicken marsala ever had   pizza OK    I'd rather pizza hut if wanted pizza   chicken wings wedding soup average   Overall just feel since place new just need work recipes could easily become 4 5 star restaurant    give place chance every 3 months see they've improved but many bad experiences stop wasting time  <EOR>
