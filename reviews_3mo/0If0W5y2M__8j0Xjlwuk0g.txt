Boo Woo! party 4 impressed restaurant  service overwhelming point became annoying food best average decor nothing special   Since restaurant only opened 3 days ago dining guests definitely outnumbered waiters  least 4 people waiting us  While normally would good thing case Woo  often felt rushed try clear table between dishes  even cases when still food plate! conversation also interrupted least 2 occasions because waiter just describe dish us   Our main waiter kept upselling entrees drinks too  He recommended order least 2 everything could few bites each dish portions smaller side  Um hello see 4 relatively petite women table? He also seemed very particular where placed glasses plates utensils  He kept moving stuff around if way where he wanted place dishes    all dishes overpowered sauces  much just plain sweet   Oh final note   even bathroom rather unimpressing  toilet seats way low toilet paper dispenser easiest use   1 star view Wynn billboard table  1 star $5 plate vegetable fried rice  <EOR>
