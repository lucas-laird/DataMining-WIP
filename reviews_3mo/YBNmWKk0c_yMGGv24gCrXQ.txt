I would return without strong coaxing  food nothing special  ordered skillets  can't remember name but only feta cheese  Maybe expectations off but when ordered skillets other restaurants ingredients integrated  Griddle each item scrambled eggs potatoes chicken feta cheese appeared cooked placed iron skillet separately then served  Additionally chicken dry  waitress also did charge correct price egg whites but friend did want address only $1 over should been   I ordered French toast heard Griddle Eastern known French toast  portion good size tasted fine  wonderful bad but would bring back restaurant over another place  <EOR> My wife  decided eat Sunday morning excited try new place breakfast  mistake  Country Combo which consisted biscuits gravy potatoes  potatoes obviously fresh could taste freezer burn  biscuit actually ok but gravy warm side cold other  wifes skillet other hand just bad  All ingredients separated  All melted cheese over freezer burned potatoes side scrambled eggs  staff impolite but overly friendly either  expected much more  Sorry say won't coming back  <EOR> I really disappointed experience breakfast  excited new place try within walking distance home but trying think going again   For restaurant only serves breakfast lunch menu didn't many choices  It only page both   also would think would serving freshest ingredients possible yet case either  ordered skillet those usually favorite  couldn't even eat it  only ate part eggs weren't incorporated into skillet would normally be  I guess blessing   potatoes which absolute favorite actually freezer burned!!! palatable  The restaurant itself very nice appeared clean but service should been  wasn't busy would thought server would bothered notice food barely touched  I say very disappointed hoped could new place frequent since close convenient  hope notice some changes  <EOR> Love place four times already   Good portions your dollar tastes lot fresher less greasy ihop   Service good coffee great food fresh <EOR> I mood good breakfast couldn't wait check menu  don't see lot places offer chicken waffles when spotted knew try it! When came wasn't expecting  waffle beautiful  kind looked flower but piece chicken disappointing  thinking chicken would drumstick chicken strip  wasn't quantity    I just think taste different  would rather chicken bones it  would give more down home type appeal   waffle fresh could tell wasn't frozen because crispy outside fluffy inside   I thought restaurant's decor could brighter  If going mustard yellow why step above sunshine yellow!  just think brighter yellow would remind more breakfast   say love bright colors!   The service fine  food came timely manner didn't hunt down waitress refills  just thought entree could better   <EOR> Outside myself daughter only 4 tables guests 2 servers   I'd say weren't busy   sure why unable warm coffee ask meal check us   I know breakfast time but daughter asked Diet Coke  Standard you'd think   server told out   He did however someone run Vons p u couple cans which he brought over when meal over   The food mediocre potatoes skillet far cooked    Definitely going back again  <EOR> What great place! first time couple days ago since mood breakfast  son french toast loved it  bacon eggs delicous home fried potatos!   The food great service friendly professional prices right! back sure! <EOR>
