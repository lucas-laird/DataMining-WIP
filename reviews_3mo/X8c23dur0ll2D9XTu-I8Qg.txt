Upon first approaching Hakkasan instantaneously awe over entrance   massive   massive fact fit entire white house + some inside space  Gorgeous blue waves reflect off elevated cement walls   fan all randomly placed steps inside club but most security guards carry flashlights help ladies navigate heels thank goodness    first clubs where bouncers actually nice give them lot credit that   Just every guest entered club sincere smile welcoming   elevator staff engaging friendly too!

Decor ugly music subpar no dancing including terribly dressed go go dancers It's pretty bad when even hired dancers won't dance    The worst part Hakkasan clientele  definitely opposite upscale club  Picture drunk botox filled late 40 somethings mixed dirty cowboys mixed girls couldn't into hotter clubs    I 6 good looking girls left dump XS within 30 mins arrival most epic night  walked Hakkasan bouncer actally told hurt feelings because leaving already    Word advice Save your time sexy outfit  Any club housed 5 star hotel strip better choice one  <EOR> Hakkasan=Major dissappointment!    Came Grand Opening night Deadmau5 headlining   Bought tickets ahead time shorter line   waited maybe 5 10 min     With all competition admit Hakkasan doesn't even measure Marquee XS Surrender   curious hopeful Hakkasan would another great club   time    Negatives no re entry all other clubs offer no tapwater bars No outdoor patio area The layout enclosed many sets stairs Dancefloor Ling Ling Room quite small The crowd whole isn't attractive crowds XS Marquee Another Asian themed club terms decor   nothing innovative nothing new nothing really talk about  It really dissapointing wasn't outdoor area   mean come on!  think  best parts XS Surrender Marquee   warm weather coming around option hang outside would considerate addition     Sadly there's nothing special Hakkasan   only good thing good DJ residencies but really don't waste your time money coming here  <EOR> My friends ecstatic Hakkasan's grand opening weekend landed same date trip! Hakkasan announced resident DJs lineup which includes Tiesto Deadmau5 Calvin Harris Dada Life Hardwell course favorite Laidback Luke name few     Tables bottle service Hakkasan INSANE! quoted 6g's hip hop room 8 10g's main room  NO THANKS!    ridiculous price range initially noticed 90% tables bottle service booths EMPTY!   Anyway GA admission guys $60 believe $30 girls! arrived club early since grand opening weekend didn't wanna deal long lines! night club HUGE! thought only 3 floors but told bouncers actually 5 floors! elevators pretty organized take each floor if wanna avoid endless stairs *AHEM MARQUEE*  The club itself pretty nice! dance floor each rooms bit small compared XS Marquee since filled each room many bottle service tables booths THAT SADLY EMPTY LOL   But still easy navigate your way dance floor!  With said give kudos Hakkasan lightings visuals sound system stage setups! amazing lineup big name DJ's sure attract crowd! wouldn't say club tops XS which still favorite club strip but definitely better Marquee since actually elevators!!! image Hakkasan trying but insane charging people 6 10 grand table specially all other clubs strip XS!   Oh small bottle fiji water $9  don't even ask tap water don't F@%K tap lol WOWZA!  4 5 stars since everyone group fun  Thank Hardwell! <EOR> Summary nicer Marquee  I came Vegas whim opening weekend check out  super apparent people running run Marquee just jocking them  elevators lasers light beacons hand quirky ass dancers some decor exact same    The only ridiculously nonsensical thing must mention steps throughout club  Why would build club couple steps all over place hire men stand next them flashlight warn people constantly? didn't stay long but sureeee people tripping all night   Even Sunday night didn't want attempt hitting dance floor crowded! ton tables above main floor empty nice area chill at  supposed 5 floors each diff vibe music hadn't explored yet  Just another reason come back <EOR> Was last week Hardwell amazing night     Overall good experience  Only downfall all stairs  all people complaining drink prices stop being cheap Vegas isn't people budget if you're broke then don't out!! See April 26th Deadmau5 <EOR> Lines crazy but thinking its probably because its brand new  space nice resident DJ lineup great  still seem figuring manage herds people let but just opened they're forgiven now  guest list line awkwardly located need around other side find it   If its crowded its hard find area decent view decent space  All areas available stand wind being right path people walking around your options stand somewhere knocked into just keep walking laps around place    My main issue weird layout stairs everywhere  take elevators floor floor but there's lot sets 2 4 steps down seemingly randomly located all around main room seems some job's bouncers just shine flashlights them people see them    Girls don't even wear heels its even worth your feet kill next day hiking all those stairs all night probably crowded no even notice you're flats  would 4 stars if random stair situations  <EOR> Overhyped opinion  understand part strip pretty dead they've trying bring some life back into part town but could spent bit more time looking other clubs seeing could upped them    Went pre opening weekend see Hardwell awesome  Lights sound awesome along endless amount confetti  air thingy though sucks  mean barely feel it   Went bit early took forever  mean SLOW still empty  Stairs weren't bad Marquee but dark enough drunk person eat it  Dance floors bit bigger which nice  Did mention there's large abundance restrooms?  I'll back depending DJ because friends but place lacked lot things such open area sit down  mean other clubs offer crappy seating but least  something instead nothing  Tables aren't really going cut especially when can't even sell all tables  Oh did mention drinks bit pricier here? <EOR> This club just BEAUTIFUL   Every room level perfectly done   Even though first weekend little hectic EVERY CLUB Vegas didn't smooth road opening   believe Hakksan did great job opening     Favorite room Ling Ling Lounge!  Just read reviews Hakksan   heck asks tap water bar inside club Vegas?! <EOR> All gotta say NEW FAVE nightclub Vegas!!  Went Saturday opening weekend lines weren't bad since group girls directed early early 10 1030 promoter host Kevin    There 4 levels club but don't count 1st floor  The second floor hip hop room dancefloor middle tables bottle service each side along full bar each end room  QuestLove DJ'd night pretty siiiiiiick  The third floor main floor    meaning whoever headlining night which ours Bingo Players where set 'unz unz unz' music!  The fourth floor where lil lounge area more chill music more seating ONLY bottle service more tables surrounding balcony like area overlooking 3rd floor   I much fun would totally recommend everyone come check out   I gave place 4 star though because NO outside area    little NO places sit  <EOR> Ok its newest club strip expectations high  Great sound Awesome lights!!    but let just say stairs need some lighting! lawsuit waiting happen look something bat cave  many tables bottle service dance area smaller such shame great DJ line have dance floor over crowded  pre sale tickets which highly recommend since regular non ticket line over 2 hours! <EOR> I haven't disappointed since found Santa Claus wasn't real   Hakkasan lackluster combination Tao Marquee's Godawful stairs   except more stairs passageways labyrinth club  If you've ever clubbed Grand SF then should familiar circular lay out  almost same referring EDM side only except extra floor so  plenty bars spread around itself gets star    Speaking bought drink bar right corner turned head see seemed 200+ lb black guy swapping mad spit skinny little white guy grabbing each others   ugh wtf!! Almost yacked drink   I want money back mental scarring! jk but seriously no should see that  Another weird incident happened shortly down hip hop room randomly attacked someone looks talks Steve Smith American Dad  He came mumbling God knows push away 2 times before he turned around started chasing 2 girls just happened walk by  Seriously kind people coming here!? Wtf!  Besides nothing else really stood except seeing people next rolling balls which hella funny Vegas night club vibe wasn't just seemed expensive rendition Chinese karaoke spot famous EDM artists playing center room  Dance floor tiny forget trying close stage    Maybe being harsh it's only open 2 weeks but XS Marquee Surrender still better IMHO  don't think coming back anytime soon if ever  <EOR> This best nightclubs seen very long time   did great job design club especially light sound   4 26 see Deadmau5   reserved booth 2nd floor overlooking main room   it amazing!

<EOR> I've chance visit Hakkasan XS past weekend let tell XS completely blows water almost every level   Sure Hakkasan exclusive contracts deadmau5 tiesto calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup nothing scoff at Porter Robinson Knife Party Avicii Steve Angello Eric Prydz Afrojack etc    But amazing club experience consumer's standpoint more just comes decks 1 30AM     There plethora factors both tangible intangible new clubs neglect ultimately leads conclusion XS remains best club Las Vegas over Hakkasan Marquee   few reasons 1 Hakkasan should renamed Hakkastairs due massive amount stairs cannot avoid MUST take even into main dance floor   also major problem Marquee's presale line walk 10 flights stairs main dance floor   fun your 5 inch heels ladies   2 No outdoor patio area?!?!  real life?  No pool? 2006?  3 No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No don't want pay 9 dollars your bottle water   give option play blackjack lose $1000 but least couple free drinks   4 XS Marquee when presale ticket never wait more 10 15 minutes    Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour    5 No re entry stamps Hakkasan    seriously?

Okay 10 minutes locate where stairs up  considerably more roomy but many tables most them empty NO WHERE stand see stage  Once more people started making way again told couldn't stand behind bottle service tables  ended doing laps around club! ridiculous!  All all probably only spent 30 minutes because miserable  even Calvin Harris's great set could keep longer  Maybe few weeks when hype dies down isn't many people might better but did leave good first impression getting friends ever back going impossible   Pros many  Good DJ's great staff member spoke to   Cons many stairs horrible use space way many bottle service tables most which even use allowing no where stand if didn't drop 10k table skeezy practices when came charging people told getting free etc etc  most likely going back any time soon  <EOR> I'm going CON first every lady should aware 5  Beauty eye some DB promoter s Hakkasan CON ruin Hakkasan  Whilst line assisted some girls taking photo group because front facing shots no bueno majority time  Then overheard them say send promoter  Um all right  Odd  Then saw another girl send full length picture she took herself room promoter  Light bulb! Turned friend said If send pictures guy getting hell line because  cool  Fortunately did not  Hurray upstanding promoter even though he misspoke girls getting free see Meh category !  My suspicions confirmed when back home when lunch friend told friend Vegas  group girls same weekend wanted Hakkasan  contact promoter required send picture group her  All girls group passed but did list  opted go   I dealt multiple promoters Marquee XS Tao    but NEVER once send picture them  Nor should to! If promoter wants refuse service every right based lack ratio boys vs girls untimely guest list request etc but send photo?! better put some PR BS need confirm guest photo because  check IDs door!

Deal it  don't  But don't come expecting Ferrari but only pay Ford   club   3  agree let few many people in  dance floor suffocatingly packed hard actually dance   But overall great vibe pro staff really killer layout design   I back Hakkasan  definitely back! <EOR> Crowded Overpriced Snobby people  Complete waste time energy money  <EOR> HORRIBLE stairs galore!   WORST club set ever!!! forget mingling others pitch dark  if don't table screwed bc no real dance floors  table walking around entire time bc can't block walk way  Also whoever managing door people horrible hater girl managing guestlist girl line would let any girls unless paying $$$$$  Right when friends leave all good looking girls told marketing guys he walked right in  P S  Don't put plain hater girl manage girl line  XS Tao       pretty much any other Vegas club better this  being 45 minutes Tao didn't even wait line gave table  <EOR> Love place  The hugeness different levels see DJ crowd above  Tables everywhere all decent view  I still love XS but think HK beats now because amazing DJ residents  Went preview opening much fun back grand opening well <EOR> My girls came Friday night see Deadmau5  Thanks promoter relatively easy in  BUT once inside mess  started 5 flights stairs main floor once crowded could barely bar  Now cheap anything but jagger redbull cost $21!! Needless say would last drink  Because crowded lost 4 friends pretty quickly  Here's biggest gripe   stairs! stairs everywhere  can't even look people cause your eyes focused ground  saw couple guys trip them  next night XS my fav club vegas much better time  <EOR> Probably worst managed club all times  Came opening weekend staff more concerned making sure girls couldn't sit then stepping when fight broke out  Also came see deadmau5 preform he didn't actually dj until 1 45 couldn't straight answer any staff when he going start leave club sit down but informed no re entry club  Don't waste your time money club much better options there  <EOR> This place seriously doesn't live all hype  much did spend place? $170m? hell did spend on?! Don't wrong place nice but $170m nice  expecting club would raise bar all clubs Vegas but instead just seems cheap knockoff all other clubs here  Definitely doesn't same wow factor XS when first walk sound system doesn't even come close Marquee  Ya good dj lineup but most them already Vegas couple years nothing new innovative category either    also understand want look busy outside line really slow but waiting hour into club then realizing club practically empty once you're inside pretty disappointing    All all club isn't bad  well  Just fell kind short promoting before opened finished product turned into  <EOR> What place really going its stacked lineup  Tiesto!!  That being said expected club top all other clubs strip  many good ones assumed anyone making new club would extra spectacular order insure its success  think still prefer Marquee over club  reason 4 stars instead 3 because although more packed guest list line does take hour expected Vegas clubs  fair ding them something standard  Luckily able join table balcony level main room avoid being absolutely smushed  made night much better would been    The inside really beautiful enjoyed all different LEDs  very classy upscale vibe  shoot confetti which covers interior looks really cool good dancers  If you're going buy drinks prepared fight crowds bar area pay lot  know everyone said but say way many stairs! walking between levels elevators available though    Overall would come back newness lineup  But still fav   <EOR> No outs no place sit stairs everywhere   rate Hakkasan gonna cockest   You really don't think girls travel miles country even Las Vegas going venue 8 flights stairs you? don't think they're going want wear flats instead heels just accommodate club you?  If you're smart girl you'll bring to go flats switch night  BUT  unfair girls can't don't bring them   PROS Some best DJ lineups REALLY good lighting main room Extremely good sound system probably best Good ventilation 2 rooms main edm house room smaller hip hop room played some good hip hop music   CONS No outs No place sit won't let girls sit side booths   Ugh excuse security guard want try wearing heels next 5 hours dancing?? Stairs everywhere = DANGEROUS drunk people   Only people bottle service allowed use elevators which minimum $6 000  No outside  So maybe good place another EDC rave but drunkies beware   saw guy miss step fall spill drink   He embarrassed  But sir shouldn't be  If didn't leave club early being over club sure would lot more falls Stairkkasan  <EOR> Question eff asked more asians clubs?   Hakkasan major fail book many reasons   would say skip place unless your ideal mate 5'0 asian male    First all managers promoters incredibly rude 'require photo submission' guestlist  seriously WHAAT?! know those hot girls 5inch heels skin tight dresses? HELL no want walk half mile just down bajillion stairs  together your club sucks Lady LingLing unsatisfied   Also no outdoor pool patio area? how's girl supposed hustle some drinks then? Hakksan perfect recipe failure expensive hell + thirsty girls + rude management + terrible layout= unhappy vegas goers  Back XS go  <EOR> This place reminds lot marquee because stairs  group didn't trouble getting because presale tickets but line door pretty long heard charged $200 guys o_O  Upon getting stone walls stairs kind castle dungeon     The first floor Or guess second hip pop  didn't can't say much it   The next floor main stage dance floor where big name DJ's play  dance floor definitely looks lot bigger Marquee but just crowded  You're literally shoulder shoulder or less pushing your way through walk ways dance floors everything  only side decent AC wasn't super sweaty whole time  Oh also didn't bother wearing heels  know blasphemy!  The top floor all tables  Don't bother coming unless table  no space really look down dance floor unless you're table  only look afar  Might well downstairs   Overall enjoyed time I didn't even any drinks! which heard $20 pop    mainly because Calvin Harris put good show  I'd come back again DJ's really because venue which bad but nothing innovative special  <EOR> Global Night Life Expectations  Cons 1  did see where 100k million went  comment states wow factor innovation clubbing experience  new nice m good sound 80k sqft does count  going cost way much money maintain every month such high maintenance interior   2  partying Europe Hong Kong Dubai Mexico South America expectations high place   a I expected zen feng shui outdoor lounge chill different experience each floor room  floor similar Box NYC another floor Thailand's BED main area Privledge Ibizia  afterhours only Drais  State art LCD interactive dancefloor shark tanks holograms projections optical illusions  Pool  More Asian theme  b  State Art technology bottle service admission  still use paper stamps?  c  said eco friendly green LEED building lush interior landscaping  doubt if 100% eco friendly designed operated did see all secret gardens    3  XS Marquee still run city far     Pros 1  Sicked DJ lineup  sure free  2  There's going restaurant eat  love food  3  Hakkasan brand known worldwide  4  MGM needed upscale club finally woke did something it  5  There's hip hop room just electronica  There's lounge just club  6  There's more elevator   7  put your feet seat table service sit counter better view crowd 8   Caesars Wynn Club Owners Las Vegas design something bigger better city if can  <EOR> Think Hakkasan larger Marquee many more tables but no outdoor patio designed offer absolutely 0 sitting space     To see DJ dance floor which pathetically small considering club's 3800 person capacity table     How much tables?  Assuming you're going Friday Saturday tables start $5 000    not $500 but 5 GRAND    are serious?  place just seems shameless money making club no regard fun factor anyone through general admission    which $40 presale $150 door men   My girlfriend left 11 00pm saw many more people leave around time because thought club just good      P s TESIA Y's review 2 reviews ago nobody club find mate LOL <EOR> Go XS great time instead  am old 35 deal such attitude door  3 guys 2 girls dressed well tip over $200 just looked at  Then once inside ambience sucked  star workout climbing stairs    This place all hype no substance  <EOR> I'll keep short but rude management    Just 4 girls through Guestlist line really fast once ID check  when horrible  very rude bouncer checks friend's ID does believe hers  friend 24 am other 2 friends 25  WTF? He then grabs another guy check ID he also says her  SUCH BULLSHIT  coming Vegas 3 years along friend checked gotten into XS Marquee TAO EBC etc  NO QUESTION whatsoever  ID picture looks exactly friend just younger because HIGH SCHOOL picture  He then tells she's coming tonight  She pulls Chase Sapphire Credit Card but he doesn't even want look it  WTF  Then he looks coming going leave her?

Freaking ridiculous    I heard such horrible things friends recently coming here  If want keep business successful better management  <EOR> My friends REALLY hyped place even though pretty good time really just OK venue   I lucky enough friends bottles place sit most night pretty close stage  ton stairs people noted  although sprawling layout don't feel theres anything special place minus DJ lineups which very good  Actually youll probably lost most night because youll keep back tracking center stage figure where want next   I can't complain because pretty much free night me   we even MADE money some guy just handed friend some HAHA but Idk if guy if i'd pay 80 bucks in  BUT if consider fact its sort mini concert guess its worth it  but no feelings nostalgia other clubs XS have <EOR> This just overhyped club   that leave disappointed  twice now don't think back unless book table which doubt cause overpriced   by lot    First time free cause girl won tickets 5 see Bingo Players guess fun then since didn't wait line  Drinks pricey but same level every other Tier 1 club Vegas  decent time free 99  However layout almost strictly caters tables whole club littered them  spent all money club hoping recuperate costs back tables exorbitant prices   I mean seriously club ain't no fun general admissions  dance floor small bit bigger Marquee's but doesn't say much  no outdoor area   so trapped no where sit if don't table  hip hop floor cool though   so definitely check if feeling some hip hop   Last Friday Tiesto second time bouncer kicked girl cause waiting Tiesto she rested head chest  WTF? fools no idea cause entire night looking people kick no reason! followed homie around whole night but he didn't anything wrong didn't kick out  pretty much useless ass bouncers nothing better do  don't even know name but he short scruffy looking white guy  Obviously must some sort Napoleon complex   but man waste money Tiesto ticket  missed much though cause heard Tiesto drunk DJ messed lot  Yeah don't think he really likes club himself  <EOR> We pre sale tickets grand opening April 27th nightclub month prior  Upon arrival numerous security bouncers helping organized many lines club  let pre sale ticket line first right 9 30PM when club opened  Once through few stops checking IDs tickets sent way dance floors  first two story held off restaurant wasn't opened yet  third floor hip hop dance floor thus reserving fourth fifth floors main stage EDM electric dance music   stairs difficult especially girls heels  reserved elevators people table reservations   I blown away absolutely stunning main dance floor was! 4 LED panel walls focal point entire space  total 4 bars more tables could count  entire staff friendly helpful  Everyone greeted smile answered any question had  more staff member offered take group pictures us  Honestly best staff any club to  even rivals some hotel staff encountered strip   Calvin Harris featured DJ night  He Fergie opened closed he only played 1 5 hours 1 30 3am  Tiesto also made quick appearance did spin some songs  paying did wished Calvin Harris played longer set  While he playing he distracted all commotion going behind DJ table  models lots men suits investors sure he mingle with  point during set he making model instead spinning  probably excitement Grand Opening weekend but wasn't good set him   There some high points low points  Overall gorgeous top notch club great service  However crowd needs more diverse 80% Asians DJ sets needs better  charge $9 small Fiji water which thought ridiculous  No outside area huge letdown too   Tip Arrive freakishly early  <EOR> We'll see long place lasts   impressed going into place but simple guy does high expectations Vegas clubs   resident now only venture party Strip when friends family town   Another reason going clubs probably age Detective Murtaugh sometimes feel old fo' sheeet haha! But hey felt young when saw caucasian dude fifties maybe sixties nice Magnum PI style Hawaiian button walk into club   staff giving issues wearing sweater! WTH if don't collar! Does more dangerous! lol   Well enough under radar     I usually judge places quality Hip Hop RnB Room     vibe pretty good here   DJ point old school felt Booty Hop Kaboom in Bay back day haha!  crowded but fair amount bumpin grindin   cool see experience Ms  Jenny Lynn Nebraska hyphy when E40 being played   There's your shoutout Jenny!

No  kicked resting head boyfriend's shoulder?  wasn't stumbling wasn't all over place  wasn't even near yacking looking needed to    This club ridiculous   I SUCH high expectations given club second chance COMPLETELY ruined birthday weekend too    The only good part? promoter nice girls fast   But downhill  avoid club ALL costs   suggest guys same worth it  all  point where Marquee seems better  mean does re entry outdoor pool area  <EOR> I want understood club  Its place where reserve ULTRA EXPENSIVE tables watch tons people crowd way around your table free spot dance which won't found  focus club TABLE RESERVATIONS  Every spot could place table did  no great spots dance because there's table course corded off area table guests dance but you  unless afford table reservation  no point  Want see DJ? Wet Republic see DJ least dance there   There couple nice things hence 2 stars The lighting amazing main room which won't able see because damn crowded   sound system amazing which won't able enjoy because constantly getting stepped person next large group people thinks see spot stand far back dance floor squish through impossibly tight crowd   <EOR> Looks lesson your way oil billionaire!  never back only redeeming quality place Calvin Harris   First off place hideous   few hundred million $100 cover expecting extravagance  unimaginative lackluster econolodge   Second place serious design flaws   nowhere stand around club listen music watch LCD stage show except tiny super crowded dance floor   Don't come without table because no place be   Third let way many people its very crowded wont able dance move floor during peak hours   Don't come here   even ultra expensive table reservations   Enjoy your time money elsewhere  <EOR> DON'T HAKKASAN! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! WORTH IT! WASTE TIME MONEY! I wish negative stars give     5 5 13 Cinco De Mayo see Tiesto experience Horrible beginning lot ass hole bouncers don't really know job right chubby short white bouncer checking ID California's Driver's license he didn't THINK valid!! he tried act all tough smart ass front ticket girls he wanted see another ID didn't want give another ID because he didn't any sense he asked step outside asked boss then manager let right away he saw ID he even asked bouncer what's your problem     That just beginning then going inside stairs 2 levels sure fun everybody buzz specially girls high heels then inside club different story club small all advertising DJ line those DJS deserve better venue no matter where won't able see DJ unless made dance floor through all squished people mostly made bottle service tables all around club can't stand anywhere see whoever spinning unless dance floor dance floor super packed point can't move muscle dance bouncers keep pushing people keep them off bottle service tables!!  couldn't stay dance floor more 5 mins then anywhere  there's bouncer asking keep walking where didn't know second floor though might better place see Tiesto spinning but also all surrounded bottle service tables also second levels speakers weren't working!! only listen music playing main floor!!  I also cigar asked put saying can't smoke cigars but smoke cigarrettes!! never seen heard something any where world!! Even Tiesto when he stage he didn't look happy all probably cause he stuck residency without really knowing he getting himself to    Tiesto different Venues Vegas LA hes always smiling good mood club way CROWDED anybody enjoy guess even Tiesto himself   couldn't stay more hour then friends left   So far nothing beats XS Marquee   I'd never back Hakkasan even if free!!  bad experience was!! <EOR> This late review review opening weekend  locals night Sunday April 28th couple girls  around 10PM when opened 10PM waited hour guess standard  When inside NO INSIDE uh why did wait long again no reason? Annoyed already   Not only walk EXTREMELY far parking lot valet many flights stairs time top feet tired dance  Talk discouraging go  Oh if think ends doesn't  stairs literally EVERYWHERE  girlfriend tripped off 3 step stair because she didn't see because drunk  wary   Since opening weekend locals night assumed all rooms open would least decent DJ  WRONG  Ling Ling Room aka hip hop room closed WTF?! Closed opening weekend?! only music really sucked main room  mean am into EDM but groove if need be  Well whoever played night really did know read crowd  No really dancing  don't know if back if even recommend bring friends  disappointing   You'd probably better off Marquee honestly  <EOR> Absolutely worst club vegas! wish could give negative stars  First off wait incredibly long strenuous  group through promoter comped table  But Hakassan people overbooked tables night ended getting table hour wait  Once inside felt if nothing special club  dance floor crowded life  constantly being pushed against another person tiesto even come yet  fact left before Tiesto came because crowded drinks good expensive $18 vodka red bull just really didn't seem worth end  Lastly every other review mentioned way many stairs  thought Marquee bad  definitely come back club future  way overpriced overhyped worth money  think stick XS Marquee next time <EOR> Good If pre pay tickets line very quick non existent   Nice Hip Hop Room but small  If you're trying some exercise two stairways climb main room   Feel bad girls high heels   Bad expecting main room epic terms space but same size dance floor any other club   wanted something size relative Rain Nightclub but same ole crap   club last   EDM crowd when don't capacity it   Half ppl dance floor probably don't EDM     On thursday Hip Hop room closed around midnight wtf   does that? said would take 5 6 years pay club off say club close less 3    Look stars ppl many ppl hate place  <EOR> I gotta give them credit having nice decors lights however did exceed expectations all  place down right crowed guest list line took forever bouncers down right rude  came because Light's opening day postpone following  weekend  Hakkasan reminds Marquee but Marquee definitely better hell hole    Tips 1  Never when deadmau5 playing  Unless want something mellow it   2  Come early because line long 3  upstairs if want avoid pushing shoving 4  Bring extra form identification because bouncers dicks  <EOR> I pretty pumped club   maybe circumstances being Thursday night prior huge fight   but think may worst controlled ratio party ever to  really poppin literally sea guys  However thought setup club pretty cool feels lot more open comfortable marquee  many stairs though   a huge pain  <EOR> Odd many negative reviews place  When looked around crowd everyone seemed lost minds in best way possible   Perhaps Hardwell working magic? I don't know write review without going into details night girls 4 20 opening weekend     but memorable one!!!  Pros x Lines move fast  think  little tipsy  x Bouncers security aren't rude douche bags  x Temperature perfect all times  Yay no sweating  x Good lights sound great sound system x Elevators x 3 different ways enter exit dance floor x contracts top DJ's always expect someone good spin no matter week go! x Areas away music breather   Side note wish could comment bar area service drink prices but don't quite remember part night P JUST BEING HONEST don't judge   Cons x Confused hell where every time going down stairs  No signs  x Some tables all way back barely see DJ  x  Dance floor bit small opinion    In all great experience here  Good review let's frank here    doesn't matter venue people follow DJ  place good overall    Ok having insane Vegas withdrawals right now  <EOR> Went last month bought presale tickets 1 month prior  some friends celebrate birthday friend told ID fake??? WTF  management involved run around   friend bought drink Centrifuge bar right next club entrance show them real still didn't care?? No ID scanners no black light?? this??  though supposed world class club  Talk subjective hell doormen   Update apparent lots fake ID issues ahead emailed info@angelmg com only email available told them all fake ID reviews if already don't know   If operations would stand poor handling management being able identify real fake ID  <EOR> the worst fucken club ever!!! bouncers suck doing job  first all extremely rude  second said id fake!!  showing them other id's still said no  asked management he told im getting anyone fat bald light skinned bouncer  even mgm anymore!!! <EOR> Disappointing   That's takeaway here  If didn't steal all big name DJs next 1 5 years would no coming  Since wasn't built scratch tell age  no outdoor area which feel new standard Vegas clubs  Everything small enclosed  drink prices standard Vegas but charge $9 smallest bottle Fiji water refused acknowledge free water unless specifically say give tap water    The dance floor small when performer comes don't much view although DJs don't really much guess  ok  Also main headliners don't come until 1 30AM aware that  came Bingo Players crowd probably little thinner upstairs 5th floor bar table area pretty spacious ended there    The feel vibe place more Haze Tao  definitely prefer Marquee XS Surrender because outdoors  Really wasn't terrible club but given all hype waiting cost tickets very disappointed  Once headliners off contract move imagine place old news very quickly  <EOR> Hot clubs Vegas usually overrated  Its just fun try something new party HOT looking crowd its always fun all female crowd  Find promoter guestlist  If need message send info   There also option buy pre sale tickets  club pretty spacious  Reminds larger version Marquee club    Price drinks Ridiculously expensive  Hottest club Vegas right now     they charge anything want guess    Would come back summer Hakkasan? Probably unless group girls visited dying just checklist off  Think prefer Surrender XS summer nights  <EOR> Cons far far outweigh pros even free entry which hot DJ lineup don't fooled hot DJ lineup! save place    If decide check not recommended may find yourself wondering where Vegas hiding attractive people sure also arrangements into XS Marquee night  <EOR> HAKKAWHAAAAT!    I came girls night opened April 19 super excited check new club everyone hyping up     My first impression upon entry reminded Marquee's layout  stairs stage dance floor layout tables   Unlike Marquee seemed more tables located near back club well some standing room   But recall being outside patio     I feel your experience as well any club Vegas depends DJ you're if table if you're good level   Hardwell performing night YES! good group girlfriends YES! table YES! all great level YES!    Dom hand light baton other danced night away http www yelp com biz_photos hakkasan las vegas nightclub las vegas 2?select=TlKuPAyQGHWSyHKAWlenig#JLdHcSRynz3EI7ZnGO3QxA    conclusion did amazing time haha     We did try going dance floor but packed!

Over crowded  laser tag cavern  Hot loud lame  Tao night before blast  Also heard XS marque good too  <EOR> Hakkasan currently hottest club Vegas strip  Located MGM Grand hard miss nowadays exterior MGM Grand hotel largely displaying electronic ads Hakkasan  Although 5 levels total first two levels actually restaurant space  club located upper three floors level being just lounge second being main room resident DJs third having hip hop dance room    I came second weekend opening debut Calvin Harris Fergie featured main room  prefer house music main room favorite dance floor however if hip hop head Ling Ling Lounge some beats   My group ladies arrived early around 8 45 9PM guest list line a ladies only one club upon its doors opening 10PM  FREE  No cover charge  Love it  Many thanks gal pal contacted right promoter hook up  Also wanted note contrary other Yelp reviews girl friend told didn't submit group photo advance accepted guest list   weird some patrons fulfill requirement  never personally done other top tier Vegas nightclubs either   Once inside found club very spacious although time many people yet  dance floor particular hauntingly empty  even open? proceeded start night drinks bar  midnight club filled up  dance floor super packed but ladies managed good spot close front hang out  close could see DJ's expressions  Party on  light effects pretty amazing well  Lazers smoke ever changing neon blinking lights  another note found even though crowded didn't hard time getting drink bar  enough bars around each level keep bar crowd being 10 people deep   Overall great time but some small disappointments along way    Stairs everywhere  Unavoidable unless table reservations  Elevators VIP  Watch your step ladies gents!

No wonder sausage fest girl wants come here! ipod plays Calvin Harris hotel     pressure began build into hakkasan more bodies more asian guys began shuffle front remove area once again slid HK without insulting industry folks feeling needed shower manhandling being manhandled sworm dudes lingering side bar  Music still pretty point must say hence 1 star music entry technically should give another since time its didnt cost kids 3 5k    But hear Trophy rant rave hour car lobby bar take off sorry dont rules  Keep your chin HK somewhere Asian kid working front bathroom mirror perfect shuffle dying come show moves! <EOR> BAD Guestlist lines confusing ridiculously long  There's ladies general don't know which way want if girls first need stay guys even girl guy ratio  Stairs EVERYWHERE mean it  only long ass dangerous concrete stairs connect 3rd 4th 5th floors but 4th main floor down steps all around back  Unavoidable  means if want drink bathroom walk steps  No wonder sell flip flops bathroom  No outdoor area  Other popular clubs XS Marquee Tao Pure? all outdoors area chill hear music see Vegas view  Hakkasan lacked which meant stuffy smokey hell  whole place dark feel you're dungeon whole time  Wouldn't surprised girls fall face steps Small main dancefloor  #1 come hire such good talent charge guys ridiculous price theres really room see dj? floor maybe little wider left right Marquee but long front back way   if sense  wouldn't whole stage view if weren't front middle back middle  left right entrances dancefloors poorly designed because 1 3 into tables area ppl would fall into flimsy railing area know which way go  least Marquee clearly designed wide walkways leading into dancefloor half wall left right won't fall into table area anything  Little room see dj  floor because theres enough room walk left right walkways crowded I'm sure middle dancefloor good space because ppl give midway push way back  But there's no other spots see dj because everyone tables surround dancefloor fucking standing blocking view  little down steps back? good thing people lean against railings theyll view  ppl pouring over every railing mini balcony half wall behind tables areas just see dj  most upsetting because all came see talent people settle standing step leaning railing order a good spot  Marquee considered small packed but least wherever see dj blcoked people standing tables because all tables front middle  5th floor balcony definitely can't see stage because all tables front railings blocking regular people standing back  No water  $10 small Fiji bottle no tap water no water fountains  Bitches trying rip off  Complicated layout  Stairs 3rd 4th 5th floors near each other no signs no way know where where anything is    GOOD Sound system lights background stage designs good  Dj music good expectations  Did Tiesto play 1 4am maybe longer? Bouncers nice kindly directing stairs bathrooms which very important because confusing layout  must asked them question 10 times patient  3rd floor hip hop room played late 90s 2000 era pretty good  But does close 12am? Sigh   TABLES  only time hakkasan SERIOUSLY if table  best views many sit  Basically people tables ruined rest because would block all views opinion    CONCLUSION Hakkasan trying appeal richer crowd people willing throw down money tables  If don't don't dancefloor early may enjoy yourself  <EOR> Considering Memorial Day weekend many friends town wanted check new hotspot   So emailed host regarding pricing tables   And lemme tell might take seat hearing quotes 4 people $7 500  including 40% tip tax    You see     FORTY PERCENT TIP TAX  So basically $10 000  believe that!? 10Gs   And believe table upstairs  Imagine ones floor  And if table lounge can't see main floor  Ridic    I know Vegas pay ridiculous bottles cost less hundred bucks  pay place sit  But c'mon   40% completely ridiculous  <EOR> Hakkasan amazing nightclub!  It's new modern several floors cater your type music   would consider best nightclubs attended years   Then again don't clubbing much used to   However sure definitely more well laid clubs     Overall definitely enough space large crowd   favorite bar staff well done   Drinks popping left right before finish BAM another hands already    When flows fast people generally drink more funny thing know spent some $$ but where'd all drinks go     Needless say atmosphere music gets going just kept buying drinks everyone else!

Why care if drink tap water bottle already paid for? layout completely wack  close off dance floor if gets crowded then people standing tables surrounding dance floor completely block everyone's view  no problem dance floor being closed off just where once closed? Everything tables everywhere  actually felt bad tables lined along dance floor though  view almost completely blocked people standing tables people between isles pillars supporting structure  sound also does carry very well tables back  warned those tables back dropped least $10 000 blocked view stage sound average best  tried see if could better view top floor but balcony lined tables well  end opened dance floor back Deadmau5 able down watch  Stairs ramps everywhere  saw 4 girls slip fall throughout night  Two them ramp going down dance floor other two slipped stairs but caught themselves before completely falling  careful girls   The Good The Talent  past 5 years seen Steve Aoki total 11 times  amazing watching music sets grow now  epic set he absolutely killed it  Deadmau5 also absolutely amazing  He played lot new chill tracks first hour  Then he put gold mousey helm started rockin old stuff  guys only reason there  The people everyone met really friendly dressed 9s 10s  The energy level crowd during Aoki's set  But any top clubs Vegas   Summary The amount money spent myself everyone around should more enough fix quality drinks lines attitudes people working there  100% management problems easily corrected  want Hakkasan enjoy idea there's upscale club favorite artists playing every weekend  But can't recommend anyone  think we'll wait while before returning   Side note saw Tito Ortiz there  checked Twitter account looks he shaft well table service  He waited hour charged 40% gratuity didn't let half crew in  If guy Tito gets bad service going get? http tinyurl com qgm5vn5 <EOR> Thurs night Memorial Day  Laidback Luke   Girls free  Guys pre paid $30  waited less 10 minutes line when before 10 30pm   The dance floor main room small  crowded really fast  group happen along edge dance floor next roped off area tables  Everybody mother used portion dance floor walk way  dance floor crowded no place move just stand there   Like everybody says random ramps stairs everywhere ladies careful!

He threw cakes ground rode around raft crowd carrying sprayed champagne all over place     glad front  He also great light show cool dancers him  tell lot thought into performance  just read even servers outfits designed him  also played some crazy videos partying felt watching Behind Music Guns N Roses  Without doubt DJ's new rock stars    Deadmau5 came 4 he started kind slow  all kind pumped Aoki's antics took people while going again  left little 5 feet super tired but very happy  surprised much enjoyed myself  would definitely return see Aoki  <EOR> On final night MDW 2013 Hakkasan watch Hardwell!  For event also bought pre sale ticket own line moved quite quickly   being escorted through seemed mini maze few more check points Hakkasan patrons then put into elevator where ascend main dance floor   The main floor similar Marquee but just bigger   DJ middle dance floor VIP tables walk way circling around it   Thankfully night wasn't crazy able dance floor no problem   There lot ramps small steps narrow hallways easily see those being problem choke points when nears capacity   The lighting great most notable integrate lights ceiling look veins pulse music   also glad whatever speakers Hakkasan uses didn't ears ring nearly 24 hours left club   All all check club out!  But also expect typical hoops politics people mainly guys deal when gets busy  <EOR> HOLY CRAP  don't write reviews ALL but if give ZERO stars would   I very excited see new club Vegas when long weekend I memorial day weekend Saturday night few friends  First off almost didn't let because bought ticket off friend's sister couldn't it  confirmation email name it  girl checking rolled eyes stared dead face said  with terrible attitude might add all she needed move neck side side take off hoops throw down  KNOW DIDN'T HACK INTO EMAIL INTO CLUB UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM BIATCH please  sorry break honey but your club ain't important enough learnin hack into people's email just fuckin $40 ticket okay  BETCH AIN'T DAT SERRRIOUS   So complained another girl finally let in  Then when started checking IDs wouldn't let friends because said he didn't look ID  guy almost 30! asked 5 other securities if he looked including cops way all said he just looked darker picture  When friends tried reason them just turned around COMPLETELY ignored them started talking eachother   WHO RAISED BOY!?!?

Once club DEAD EMPTY   felt only few patrons whole establishment   line long don't know why     The club itself very modern cool look at   There's three stories TOP LEVEL bar mostly table service   tables overlook dance floor stage where Calvin Harris playing but unless table can't really much here   also found drinks level $17 18 range versus cheaper prices lower   MEDIUM LEVEL more tables stage dance floor which seems bit small huge size club   Again tables line dance floor tiered see stage   BOTTOM LEVEL where hip hop music played though found most song selections older hip hop R B songs pretty fun reminisce haha    There's another smaller dance floor where seems more chill vibe   Tons more tables encompass rest floor there's small bar where found could buy drinks $13 piece   The three stories definitely cool appeal club seem sophisticated HUGE   However three stories  lot stairs climb group girls 5 heels!  save cost going bottom level bar every time wanted drink   so feet knees sore end night   Another thing note mention many tables priority really seems table service club   friend asked worker much table costs STARTS $5k!

Drinks waay overpriced but club reasonable prices? Don't frightened bad reviews below check yourself  loved Hakkasan <EOR> Um excuse me     $16 w o tip Long Island??? Holy cow  cannot believe paid much single drink  Super disappointed able hook no cover girls promoter but    no free drinks?

There's pretty decently sized dance floor Pavillion the main dance floor but don't upstairs unless want air table service  There's basically no view stage upstairs but good place chill air before getting back onto main floor  <EOR> Went Memorial Day weekend     CROWDED  expected though guest list waited line over hour  around 11pm maybe line thinned later night  super excited because anticipated everyone Vegas  feel would lot more fun if wasn't million people there    dance floor smaller imagined being largest club Vegas but only room Tiesto dj ing in  other rooms might bigger less crowded  would say first impression okay but ill probably wait while again less crowded actually dance floor actually bar without getting trampled  also want come back see Calvin Harris  club also really far walk parking structure prepared walk  <EOR> 0 stars if possible   That pretty much describes experience over weekend friend's Bachelorette    Gueslist useless= promoters worthless  line 9 30 1 30  Girls shoes off line since everyone stand 4 hrs  joke!

Absolutely nowhere sit all couldn't even front see Calvin Harris because tables blocked off rich mighty  3 hr wait feet killing badly couldn't even enjoy music left hr    No no no no no   The only good thing some girls working handing white chocolate balls ice cream  Other that    sad miss XS next time  would've great see Harris but honestly when drunk can't tell whether DJ Harris Boi2chainz  <EOR> Why impressed why won't back   I am impressed magnitude scale spectacle place   truly spectacular worth visit just see   times felt watching live concert big name DJ times felt watching lot people popping Mollies while watching live concert big name DJ times just caught myself looking around sea people 4th 5th floors   Seriously many people does place hold?  5 000? 10 000??  couldn't really tell   So why won't come back?  Simply put just don't feel safe place   Here's deal am sure Las Vegas nightclubs codes regulations wazzoo Hakkasan folks followed them T   being said scale magnitude never seen before   think own common sense observation main floor if something wrong would lot trouble trying way exit along deluge humanity enclosed space   light show made wonder risk fire amount people space made realize weren't searched security when came idiot gun away chaos   Maybe am completely paranoid but really thought just based common sense could easily end dangerous situation place   So all all glad once seen Vegas one itself once again but think I'd very apprehensive risk going back  <EOR> One most hyped clubs since last year Hakkasan  When WMC year Miami saw cab cab advertising place  month heard many reviews both positive negative thought only way find see myself  particular trip doing preview comparison between two newest mega nightclubs Vegas built cater EDM crowd   other review Light Mandalay Bay    Located MGM Grand prime real estate serves convenient spot South end strip dwellers  Most younger crowd ends staying hotels around area close all clubs without spending fortune cabs   didn't checked into hotel Platinum Ballys until 9 30 somehow enough changed Vegas bests tie vest whole 9 yards still club 10 45   fairly good ratio females already texted long time host which worked Wet Republic Thomas in   As approached club zoo surrounding place  Also guest list line wrapped around building into hallway where stores are  Finding Thomas almost impossible especially when he caters mostly higher end clientele probably busy seating 25K min tables he sold particular night  Thomas directed someone else worked ropes front he able group ladies smoothly  process getting past ropes didn't last more 5 mins bouncers checked your credentials entry    I physically set foot club 11 15 PM dance floor still crowded  managed quick tour entire place found few sweet spots where bass hit very well  Surprisingly sound dance floor itself loud second level  Another thing notice crowd tends flow right side dance floor  If entering dance floor would probably easier time staying left without being bumped into   midnight all bets off free movement dance floor    One gripes read lot other reviews many stairs  did find issue all  If comparing stairs Marquee just baby steps  also elevator takes two places exit downstairs hip hop room  guys working elevator specifically tell where going sure take right one   So finally decided enough getting bumped into sub standard opening EDM acts hip hop room Chris promoter Light met night  took elevator down heard nothing but ratchet music tons smoke  People definitely getting party on  hip hop room actual dance space seemed crowd able more fun  spent good 45 minutes down before almost time main act come main stage   When Dada Life finally came seems lighting volume increased production value up  production mean more confetti ever before  Dada played very expected set  wasn't haven't heard before other festivals clubs  think problem signing resident DJs play every other week tend lose interest changing crowd  probably more problem Vegas now days anywhere else   The night came went  can't say let down  also can't say mind blowing   think owners really focused keeping restaurant element Hakkasan left few essentials probably help put place over top  overcrowding issue tends occur clubs converted restaurants  I e  Tao nightclub almost unbearable most nights full house  Hakkasan does few places take breather only if know where look  would definitely come back    PS  met favorite day club hostess Danny Wet Republic  its own made night   You read full review pics http bit ly 13EMT94 <EOR> Came Calvin Harris last weekend    My friend guestlist  still ended waiting 30 mins line  club SUPER SUPER crowded point where just couldn't walk anywhere  absolutely no where chill too  wants dance 8 hours straight?!   Never coming back here  <EOR> The more clubs especially Vegas more realize probably more lounge guy opposed club guy   show lights music women  don't insane crowds being packed sardines getting drinks spilled ridiculous cover fees insane prices alcohol kids trying Bruno Mars look a like dancing having emotional breakdown dance floor  Maybe just getting old but just doesn't seem anymore   When passed through MGM thought Hakkasan looked pretty cool mention only few steps away didn't walking commuting down strip there   plan check once night rolled around   I line kind late 10 45 because figured maybe I'd XS instead since never but changed mind headed back Hakkasan   Needless say wait general admission line good 45+ minutes before getting in   Since somewhat spur moment thing hadn't checked cover fee halfway through line asked $50   really wanted pay just inside but since awhile already said screw did anyway  proudest moment but figured just wouldn't drink anything  hear drinks close $15 each anyway anything over $9 $10 pretty much rip off even Vegas standards   The decor inside pretty cool  Simple but nice   didn't find cool interior Tao cool pictures seen XS but overall wasn't bad   Multiple levels several views main DJ performance stage large dance floor several restrooms tons booths bottle service   As big venue appears packed really quickly   dance floor insanely crowded much navigation nearly impossible    Tons people getting drinks spilled them getting bumped into ever nanosecond worst all friggin' hot   Tons people dancing around drenched sweat bumping into throwing elbows etc  while dehydrating took toll 30 45 minutes before decided enough off floor    occasionally confetti being dumped above fog mist being blasted floor which should happened more frequency due temperature floor   tons kids floor some whom didn't even look near 21 but then again  really concern anyway  Vegas    I ended finding place stand behind bottle service tables watched main show there  main show DJ duo called Dada Life name rang bell but aside didn't really strike chord me   actually hoping more see Tiesto performs regularly but alas wasn't nights   music so so but show pretty impressive lots lights lasers choreographed dancers huge banana shaped inflatables beach ball style even pillows being thrown roof into crowd add carnage   cool scene just sure mine   This club just okay   Cover fees steep especially considering fact prices drinks steep   Bad combo   Clubs crowded Vegas but guess getting little less tolerant insane crowds mention having anywhere sit down just becomes exhausting   don't regret coming but same time kind wish would original feeling gone XS instead   Basically each time club Vegas fight crowds find probably going more lounge guy now on  If going drop lot cash drinks etc  might well style comfort Hakkasan pretty much solidified notion  If end going another club Vegas probably end going XS somewhere where feel little more value entertainment getting   just wasn't Hakkasan   mean real fun  just wasn't real fun  <EOR> The club does incredibly crowded expensive all hell nut great time  saw R3hab show amazing  said given cost probably only return if huge name DJ playing  <EOR> The next big vegas night club if no other reason amount ridiculous talent locked in  being said venue itself pretty sweet  mega club warehouse feel multiple levels rooms but enough fine touches keep feel worth time money likely spent Recommendation guys unless you're rolling deep getting table presale ticket option   drinks standard vegas over prices  definitely big size discrepancy hip hop lounge vs main floor  Just based headliners its obvious place caters more EDM heads there  Speaking main stage light show giant LED screen pretty spectacular even if you're rolling <EOR> It's no XS  sure   Went last Saturday three girlfriends walked line no problem  wasn't big talent night might better time if Calvin Harris Tiesto playing  didn't love crowd little young opinion    The layout reminded warehouse rave circa 1997 including awkward transition area where could obnoxiously hear two DJs once  shocked see actually bottle service set god awful spot  Sucks those suckers    Hip hop room downstairs highlight even though  am usually such gigantic EDM fan  Some 21 year old booty dancers taught twerk google you'll impressed little white girl booty could even pathetic attempt dance move which pretty hilarious  Although any reflection actual club    No outside area which feel just any other club you've ever your life  guess okay change if you're looking something different XS Tryst where always end going but anything special beyond that  <EOR> This review based solely nightclub experience MDW  saw Calvin Harris show absolutely fantastic but zoo trying in  all pre paid tickets but wasn't clear wasn't organized where line up    I guess used Studio 54    impressed layout place    giant room felt beyond capacity most Vegas clubs  absolutely nowhere sit friend kept getting told security guards sit bottle service table section    The place pretty unique all    maybe just spoiled XS but feel place die down fabulous DJ line over  <EOR> One word over hyped    This place lame  layout absolutely terrible  complete maze trying find other rooms  2 5 levels The top level kind balcony level which absolutely pointless if don't table since line whole balcony  The bottom floor floor 3 hip hop room  thought Top 40 which would fun but turned ghetto hip hop  way cramped small almost size Lavo   To downstairs stairs just right elevators  Don't ask bouncers most them total douches   The main floor floor 4 which where off elevator where all unse unse music is  place meant ballers table service  isn't much room elsewhere  walkways tight Marquee only imagine impossible place another full night  still traumatized night Marquee Kaskade but  another review   Even great girl guy ratio buy tickets $34 guys $24 girls  Lame!!   plus didn't wait line    other option guest list but wanted PICTURES girls   we hell?! really don't vibe place  totally worth hype  Tao night before free no line absolute blast  <EOR> Hakkasan supposed highlight weekend   Came Saturday June 15 worst experience  Megan guestlist line lacks professionalism should fired job   She made 1 hour long line first asked when arrived when first arrived see if list otherwise just pay full price ticket  She said line before she look see if list   waiting 1 hour arrive front line tell list need regular line   waste time!    Then regular line charge $50 guys $30 girls   didn't mind paying but wish didn't wait into 2 separate lines   When asked cashier management if knew Megan guestlist line told know everyone name   Really?  Most people didn't want join LIGHTS where Zedd performed day before but LIGHTS Mandalay bay hands down waaaay better club Hakkasan   partying many worlds top party destinations say billionaire owner Hakkasan tried hard great venue but he needs work kind people hire first    DO WASTE YOUR MONEY Hakkasan   LIGHTS XS much much better experience!!!! <EOR> I just back trip Vegas very excited going Hakkasan because good things heard few friends  Boy mistaken  starters bottle service group 12 people mainly girls wait quite while even taken inside because someone named Joe unable found even though he person told ask when table reservation line   wasn't big deal just wanted start night did think much wait    Once inside couldn't see anything front us  club dark honestly finding your way through maze  only difficult maneuver your way around club but also over crowded can't take more two steps without bumping into someone    We finally table guy assuming 'Joe' asked credit card ID  Now where real frustration starts  explained 'Joe' friend male volunteered give card but temporary because actual card stolen while Vegas  He said wouldn't problem called over host order bottles  45 minutes waiting wondering where hell bottles mixers 'manager' comes over host starts telling card unacceptable because doesn't name it  simply asked why told information when asked earlier he looked said don't need deal this  canceling your bottle service  all back outside pay cover in  response little question   I think deserved explanation considering you're supposed manager YES actually need deal this  managed money together pay bottle service which $3 000    We started enjoy night having little more fun considering ordeal just through  hour later finished bottles host cleared table  all dancing around empty table some girls table others platform surounds booth seating  when night took turn worst  single person came tell girls could dance little empty table once bottles but second friend the same guy issue credit card starts dance someone club walks literally PULLS off table  Luckily he didn't hurt  seemed entire security team surrounded because he apparently wasn't supposed dancing table thought he going physical  Fortunately club friends civil know speak people  don't need use force unlike employee   At point asked speak manager  Guess manager was? YUP same heavy set hispanic man glasses gave hard time credit card happened same person pull friend off table  HE manager? When asked reasoning doing he did he simply said he coming   do dance your coffee table home? response MANAGER club gives paying patrons? NO  When asked speak supervisor told wasn't working  only person could speak guy thought he position physically assault someone club he manages  When said he did illegal he laughed face  Really 'Manager'? Just your own future reference battery actually illegal  help further more happy provide definition battery under Nevada's Penal Code  NO CAME TELL COULDN'T DANCE TABLE  If told wouldn't done it    I work hospitality industry would never treat people way 'manager' rest employees night club treated party  If would suggest finding somewhere else spend your money unless being treated you're below employees there  left club without any resolution  No could even give email address business card supervisor least SOMEONE higher position manager no problem laying hands paying patron  Let end saying never write reviews but because couldn't email address express thoughts poor service club just no other option  <EOR> I last Friday night celebrating birthday friend's birthday   table reserved Ling Ling Club absolutely no issues getting in   could see people could confused but new place still working kinks   think most might remember when some other popular clubs opened tons issues well time fixed that   Give Hakkasan chance everything fine   I am also pretty easily entertained but don't lot patience    neither problem night   escorted table a corner booth Ling Ling Club which surprisingly crowded 11pm night   seen lot complaints being nowhere stand if don't table well saw bunch people plenty room stand in aisle    We absolute BLAST!  server busser awesome provided great service security very nice music bumpin!  nothing ghetto music ever listened hip hop before?  DJ played good mix current old school music group danced butts off   We did explore rest club because happy where EDM really thing can't really speak rest club   But am REALLY happy Hakkasan offers something hip hop lovers   crowd night seemed all enjoy themselves but probably came write bad reviews later    consider night success   The only negative thing would say good idea stairs main exit end night   lot intoxicated people interesting departure when try down stairs your heels few cocktails   Other beautiful space! <EOR> I last Sunday celebrating bday! club good but expected something more    Its spacious    sure guest list because even though line huge moves pretty quickly! fun but much hype place thought would XS but no    Monday XS where Lil Jon performing that'e where blast   I guess if into techno trance music would love Hakkasan but if more House HipHop then place you  <EOR> So sorry but give place 1 star  Megan if  real name told guestlist   problem she just kept scrolling through guestlist ipad without carefully looking name   point hint  She did want honor guestlist but wanted into general admission line pay   She dismissive me   But realize may just her  gonna ahead point finger management too     After wasting all time guestlist line decided just into general admission line pay $50 in  Maybe experience turn things around   I am impressed  Looks typical    Here ranking 1 XS 2 Lights 3 Surrender 4 Marquee 5 Vanity 6 Pure 7 Hyde 8 XS's restroom 9 Surrender's restroom 10 Hakkasan  At least Hakkasan top 10!   I say going club appreciation others much greater  sure time work issues Hakkasan but wouldn't hurt better personnel  Good luck guys  wish could refund money but hey know Vegas gambled Hakkasan going best club ever   Guess lost  <EOR> The worst Vegas experience EVER!!!

All bouncers encountered douches  But guys answered BF's questions mines ease tried help us  incredibly nice both inside outside bouncers  ones inside super nice when trying find hip hop room  HUGE PROPS  If Hakka keep they'll definitely attract much larger crowd    Upon entering lights blew away  Blue pink lights PRETTY! dance floor main EDM area HUGE bigger Marquee  several bars sides your drinks  looking hip hop area just check before settled Hardwell but found using floor EDM specific weekend  bouncer guided another area lounge thats connected HAKKA! walked EMPTY!

Thing remember sure hookup just any other club Vegas  But newest really need good hookup otherwise can't sure  But overall club definitely Las Vegas standard world class night experience! <EOR> This place sucked  Great DJ lineup but  it  most over priced piece crap strip!! Save your money your time head XS Marquee  think girls struggle all those flights stairs    assuming some in  night table mostly guys those bottle service looking around non existent girls talk to  No Bueno  <EOR> UPDATE Came back again EDC Weekend   still whack LOL  <EOR> Went Friday night during EDC weekend left within hour  bachelorette party 8 other girls  guest list    BIG deal everyone else!

Awesome! Even more plus if you're staying MGM! Since always same few stops whenever hit Vegas excited could mix clubs hit whenever town    Hakkasan without doubt beautiful night club  amazing light displays sound system really awesome  two levels Hakkasan however really crowded when came Hardwell Thursday before EDC weekend  lines ridiculous thankfully friend tickets pre bought online  line short sweet record time  prices night sure guys always pay more girls if door  If already know want come big night always try pre buy online   Once inside you'll notice lot stairs  also isn't lot space dance floor but ample seating if bottle table service  few bars located around club drinks various points club  Overall experience only okay  wanted Hakkasan more did  really nice new club but just crowded people stairs didn't watch rest Nervo's set   Maybe next time come less EDM crazed weekend hopefully it'll much better experience! totally worth check though! <EOR> I wasn't really looking forward place but wow blew mind!!  Your best bet no hassle entry buy tickets before hand eat restaurant   dinner manager escorted through back way skipped whole line process   bartender very generous pours Ciroc Peach!!  little details into club crazy way try catch deadmau5 thought he would cheese but he amazing!!! <EOR> One best clubs Vegas far! Starting bouncers very polite professional just normal asshole bouncers  club immaculate drinks stiff 16 year old virgin prom night  Definitely buy pre order entry tickets though! would definitely recommend place! <EOR> Checked Dada Life Hakkasan last week   blown away DJ but club   reminded layout LAX just didn't anything me   just club   decent club sure but no Surrender! <EOR> Do yourself favor pay $30 online presale tickets avoid massive wait line  couple friends decided pay presale ticket price ended wasting 3 hours line just denied front line due reaching over capacity limits   Other its your typical Vegas night club  Beautiful surroundings beautiful people high priced drinks nice beats good DJs  Calvin Harris night went  Over all good time  <EOR> Honestly scared based reading reviews others mentioned Hakkastairs    wasn't bad thought    Went last weekend bob sinclar using presale tix wanttickets     waited whole 2 minutes in   only way if you're doing bottles    Was absolutely blown away  opening DJ dope hell   had great mix felt crowd warmed up  layout surprisingly dope dance floor able around bit    sound system tremendous FREAKIN CRYO BLASTS COMING DOWN CEILING YOU  just insane   video screen above DJ second level choreographed dancers performance   Just freakin incredible really really impressed venue Bob Sinclar dope hell      Checked venue bit I'd personally stay away hip hop room   out way just weird vibe  main stage where its at   go dancefloor tables don't think back room upstairs would good  <EOR> I've never vegas club before but say pleasant experience  Hakkasan some pretty prominent DJs spinning inside club only bad thing kind big lost ooh $9 little bottles Fiji water      Other very comely club dance with  separate lines presales  There's times where wait line presales  <EOR> Please don't contact purposely offering VIP concierges bad experience  stuff just worse  Why trying offer bottle service rather apologizing hakkasan? 1 star  <EOR> We presale tickets line moving along well but god damn prepared ID ed least 2 3 times! venue interior designed amazingly!!! Everything looked different compared pictures took place! various floors attend but main floor small crowded maybe cause all tables surrounded it!  I give place 3 stars because DJ night basically played same over over! Everyone waiting Dada Life but he didnt come until almost 2am when he suppose midnight = everyone exhausted then   Girls watch your purses  Two friends phones stolen friend almost did! <EOR> Went second time much better time first  Its beautiful club time staff definitely more friendly   I would still recommend Hakkasan some non VIP seating but maybe its because Im getting old feet hurting  <EOR> This probably worst clubbing experiences   I last weekend tried clubbing Hakkasan  previously contacted promoter supposedly put guest list  arrived around 10 30 line building  bouncers kept telling general admission line same line guest list line later line became guest list line only  Whenever asked lines long wait received different answers every time  time front already 2 30am waiting 4 hours  When finally let club wanted charge $60 girls $125 guys even though club closes 4am would only less 2hrs  When tried tell guest list she told guest list closes midnight  just ridiculous ended just leaving    Definitely don't if line door if there's popular DJ  Most likely if line isn't moving steadily don't within 2hrs gonna worth time  probably won't much time club charged ridiculous amount it  <EOR> I came group 12 girls being only guy  promoter said he could walk girls but wait line  revival chivalry said no prob I'd just wait line myself girls should first  Figured it'd maybe 1 hour tops before could join them  9  12 15 still line stuck 15 people front last hour  meantime girls inside say still pretty empty  maybe few hundred pple behind line  Oh yeah $125 in   You guys really need manage your line better least provide updates folks waiting line know status is  If known going happen would've gone somewhere else all could've come ahead  Instead you've created customer only never return but convince everybody else to  Worth it? <EOR> Saturday Calvin Harris spinning   My friend in unison Hey let's Hakkasan! Me Suddenly worried But bad reviews? Friend Nah all related people having trouble getting in  Me Yeah won't those issues! know host!   The host surprisingly tells late follow advice way past 12  ticket admission line side guest list ladies lines other  first guest list area line because point rules don't apply everyone themselves pushing front trying unsuccessfully catch someone's attention  When doesn't anywhere move ladies' line but no difference  Everyone guest list almost everyone  lady because 1 5 hours waiting saw 1 5 guys average in  But more later     We see host know tells he minute but right now no getting over capacity etc  etc   hear other hosts tell other girls same thing could anywhere 15 50 minutes in  But once while see only certain hosts people in  late night form conspiracy theories analyze hierarchy just keep waiting  long while passes when some hosts start changing stories telling people might well leave because getting in  host comes hiding just ask honestly tell if getting he assures just few more minutes    Meanwhile decide into bar adjacent Hakkasan  When come bar just happens area where all hosts hang getting closer access  point story still stays same anywhere 15 50 minutes  gets ask? People meeting people tables seems general response  Mysteriously those people mostly girls few guys sprinkled between   group girls waiting long time host whom seen getting others in  talk him  Same story 15 50 minutes  those girls just ask? friends Calvin Harris host says  doubt any real friends Calvin Harris waiting line hour but OK whatever   finally talking yet another host knew point disappeared  BUT really made whole experience unpleasant constant lack clear answers   If we're getting just TELL US!!  appreciate honestly night  Yes your strategy keep people outside your club seem hottest place earth but don't want puppet outside making club look good while wasting precious time knowing what's going happen  lack disrespect disregard really threw off    However once Inside energy amazing sound quality lights visuals all great  No line bar very nice bartenders making very nice strong drinks  stairs bad but maybe because semi sober  Maybe drinks weren't strong all  Anyway all almost worth waiting Almost    Next time if want see DJ just buy online tickets  Seems way without hassle  <EOR> Has most exciting club Vegas right now  twice far both very different nights but both awesome    People complaining amount stairs but plenty elevators take stairs  main floor amazing see DJ pretty much any angle bars all around side dancefloor huge plenty tables    The first night group girls guy wanted sure purchased tickets week advance pre sold ticket line moved little faster general admission when closer top all girls guided way while guy put slower line unless money pay tables bottle service really annoying guy Vegas   chatting really nice woman working security she managed pull line into ours which lucky because never would found inside    Calvin Harris playing music amazing  spent entire night dancefloor lost some group because busy but all great night    The second time just girls guestlist  arrived little late looking guestlist line many different lines   walked line tables started chatting group really nice not sleazy guys invited join table  no idea much spending but table best place imagine lot! hostess gorgeous really sweet all hostesses seem best Vegas all hot really nice     If insane amount money spend then tables way but even without great time  can't wait back!  One last note friend lost purse don't know if staff someone else found but handed security all cards cash still inside love honest people! <EOR> Saturday Deadmau5  Here observations Extremely hard walk inside many people see DJ better table cost least 3500 dollars 21 dollars drink If women can't walk high hills all night forget no place seat unless table Next time XS older place but 20 times better  <EOR> Decent venue  Came see deadmau5 during EDC weekend  layout venue extremely confusing narrow walkways crowded corridors  Open place bit! <EOR> Take party girl Hakkasan Vegas' commuter club  check because new some awesome DJ then leave when realize great  Amazing DJs but club itself ergonomic fail design    Unless you've bought VIP table club probably isn't you  Guys you'll good time  Girls don't much  most Vegas clubs where random people meet start drinking together  club setup inviting experience    My 4 girlfriends Tiesto last Friday  Tiesto amazing best sets heard him!    but ended leaving club before close which never do because Hakkasan itself  girls live stuff wish wish could said something good it     Where fails 1 missing experience   When walk through Hakkasan most people walk aren`t smiling weird  reason experience missing  Everyone club should able experience ambience atmosphere everyone partying having good time  Hakkasan doesn't offer this  Unless you're VIP table willing smothered sweaty bodies waaayyy over packed dancefloor enjoyable clubbing experience because can't see anything! can't see DJ main room because design layout you'll stuck wandering paths dancing overflow area    2 You're always looking down because can't feel comfortable walking around   First there's many stairs random levels  Second overflow room raised platforms visible crowds  result many girls taking tumble because poor design lack  area guards bouncers didn't anything it  ridiculous  Third floor pattern misleading gives illusion white steps when not  girls kept thinking steps felt always cautious    3 If you're VIP you'll feel second class citizen  girls we're usually used being treated well Vegas clubs but because Hakkasan isn't designed mingling meeting new people girls left behind    without view DJ not even TV screen anywhere without single place sit wandering around aimlessly  result leave  Hakkasan known girls leaving  staff know why Vegas commuter club   It doesn't offer glamorous Vegas nightclub experience really disappointing   Here's some suggestions better TO HAKKASAN OWNERS 1 Overflow Room  room offers no experience  remember people come DJs even if they're main danceroom need give them experience  Add massive LCD screen showing DJ playing along side balcony  Also can't girls falling all over place! Add barriers corner areas platform safety    2 Waterfall back area  need let girls sit otherwise leave  idea people pay sit club but just ridiculous  need let girls rest feet sometimes  Marqui allows certain areas should you!   3 Upstairs small suggestion  If you're VIP noooo experience therefore waste space  Give people experience  Add some small LCD TVs everywhere people feel DJ  People create own fun front TVs     4 Upstairs big suggestion  Because openings VIP booths opposite DJ stage guys VIP facing DJ stage  Therefore when girls walking behind they'll never noticed  think another tier few steps lower VIP area should wrapped front non VIPs  way guys VIP physically see girls tell them join them they'll feel more VIP more people seeing them  Also regular people actually view    5 Dancefloor  Having 2 entrances dancefloor ends stage inconvenient exiting  Add two more paths enter dancefloor Marqui    These problems may seem petty but Vegas exactly all about  Someone s missed mark here  Hakkasan needs some work big time  won't back unless something changes  <EOR>
