Andrea's where Switch used Encore   totally different now 1 2 club 1 2 restaurant sleek interior DJ 1 wall faces Surrender club      We restaurant opening tonight  Steve Wynn also eating wife guests!   OK food great balance asian fine dining!  Rock Fish Tempura generous portion wonderfully prepared more enough starter 2   sushi eel roll also excellent wife enjoys particular roll says best she's had    Our main meal Wagyu beef sliced 2    awesome!  normally shun any sauce steak but side wonderful complement   eaten SW Botero Picasso Michael Mina food class!    The environment way more hip   Think cocktails vs  big wine lists cool music vs  heavy upholstery   guys bar started dancing tipped DJ more 80s tunes!     Highly recommend! <EOR> My wife opening night new Restaurant  Didn't think we'd able table but when walked very nice accommodate even though looked fairly full    While waiting able take look decor people etc    personally really liked clean hip look place where tables relation bar other parts restaurant  main dining area slightly elevated lounge area thus creating separation but close didn't feel disconnected bar area where lot people watch  definitely isn't place if want quiet dinner for two but wife great   Once seated decided choose multiple small plates try different things  sushi roll noodle dish duck crab cake ball some items dim sum menu  food generally 3 5 5 because didn't blow away but couldn't really say anything bad it  just you'd expect Asian fusion menu much more     There thing really didn't 1 Maybe because opening night but way many people working floor!
