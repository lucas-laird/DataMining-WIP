Since reviewed Nathan's should review exact opposite good hot dog joint   I love dogs   day high school friends day where did stuff we'd never done before   those things Wienerschnitzel   didn't then   I then married man LOVED Wienerschnitzel would bring home every opportunity   then learned hate Wienerschnitzel   I've made better hot dogs home grill much cheaper   don't know them mayhap don't enough fake German them but they've always tasted slightly ass cat food  <EOR>
