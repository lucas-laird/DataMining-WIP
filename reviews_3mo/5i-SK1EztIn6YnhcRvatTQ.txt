My only complaint Cafe Vetro fact don't serve full breakfast menu all day long   love breakfast foods usually Vegas only place actually eat brunch breakfast dishes   Having woken late just missing lunch hour well hoping still able order breakfast   Since always crave omelettes sad see late breakfast dishes   However luckily asked server still serving omelettes   maybe 3 breakfast entrees breakfast list still served   If wanted smoked salmon outta luck     My omelette light delicious served hash browns toast   Pretty standard  but nothing special   Service really kind helpful   coffee wasn't good but okay   another downfall but other pretty decent place eat   Hey anything tastes good when you're hungover starving  <EOR> We arrived hungry ready eat but since only places Aria open breakfast line  long line  around twenty thirty minutes waiting finally shown seats  Since waited long hostess sat area good view outside   Our waitress provided excellent service  only ordered item share she brought all ready separated  When food came missing something extra ordered she gave several options fix issue  opted being charged which she removed bill then some   The food overall okay  price high $8 00 orange juice but made best it  ordered omelette pancakes  nothing special omelette but enjoyed pancakes   Between two food satisfying  would return if area  <EOR> Like every other strip restaurant course theres wait  Haha  horrible buffet lines but still     The decor first thing noticed which super bright open very welcoming    Anyway order BBQ burger which amazing!! Could also because also starving   haha  Hunger best spice  bacon thick bun soft brioche burger bun  meat itself cooked perfectly    I would say biggest disappointment soy cappuccino  probably came automatic machine  Big no no me   Other would definitely come back eat if staying Aria  <EOR> When am Vegas think quick service unless buffet     many empty seats yet waited long table Saturday morning breakfast   menus torn name faded didn't even know name restaurant   Pretty bad brand marketing!  food just ok   standard breakfast eggs hash browns ham    sure if would back  <EOR> Very tasty breakfast!  I egg white scramble egg whites scrambles spinach tomatoes some other veggie mushrooms maybe swiss cheese   came toast hash browns   Maybe just starved but seemed extra good first morning Vegas vacation   husband some Mexican food themed breakfast really enjoyed breakfast well   He said coffee bloody marys good   carmelized pineapple belini   would order again   fine but $14 fine   wait staff very friendly kept waters full   Good stuff hungry potentially hung over people! <EOR> The food service fine  Kitchen little slow breakfast  faster less expensive breakfast Aria try buffet promenade level  <EOR> Typical Las Vegas place nice quiet break business strip casinos   Large open bright space   Breakfast served morning but all day which bit disappointing  <EOR> I would back becasue selection food   wish staff more attentive   other then great place eat open all day   <EOR>
