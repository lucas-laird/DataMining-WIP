Just warning  light colored shirt stained it    Now big complaint if late night drive thru check your bags before driving away    We've gone only few times forgot things 3 times maybe 5 visits    and somehow always BF ordered since he orders few smaller things just usually want just salad churros   Also don't assume put proper sauces your bag he appetizer trio didnt marinara ranch sweet sour    Nothing more irritated going home things missing paid now theres enough food  don't yourself   check because they're paying attention location   I should add just opened hopefully just learning curve usual disposition staff here  <EOR>
