Listen don't know anyone Del Taco over other food choices  mean given choice between other food places DT probs gonna pick other food places  location convenient because two minutes house but place worth drive otherwise   ?  The last two times gone Del Taco gotten fish taco combo  Seriously only reason place getting three stars two  Speaking exclusively fish tacos  great  mean really good given price point  No complaints all  almost want drive over right now just that  NOM  Why think smart serve french fries fish tacos beyond though  Everything else ever gotten there? Meh  eat because you're hungry you're time crunch but amazing  ok    The service never bad  good quick no complaints there  place also isn't dirty anything  no complaints either    All all place isn't bad  Some food leave wanting more in terms delicious volume but fish tacos think totally good  them  <EOR>
