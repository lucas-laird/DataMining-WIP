Just give fellow Yelpers some context family reasonably good looking people any measure dressed casually but neat ex  Business casual jeans no jacket    hostess glanced back into dining room pretended weigh options  Sorry don't think able seat your party tonight  large empty table front restaurant directly behind hostess  being held? wife asked  Oh being held hostess replied but table would small also don't enough chairs   we're closing 11PM  table set seat four could obviously comfortably seat six but believe NYC would sat eight   wife pointed additional chairs unused guests other tables   Another hostess trying more helpful scurried off look couple more chairs   head hostess did move  sorry just no chairs we're closing hour really don't think seat tonight  back forth five minutes hostess eying down whole time     After while left   hope some point hostess realized she missed opportunity restaurant more money a group seven willing dine table usually seats four which probably couldn't filled rest night    Actually scratch hope she stays dumb rest life   Anyway Scarpetta instead where food great service better nobody made feel lesser class human being  <EOR> Pros world fried eggplant honey must order die pan con tomate!!!!!
