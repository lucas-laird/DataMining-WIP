 your life   only thing muster dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience ever have   Ever   see   originality ensures cannot disappointed  <EOR> It wasn't bad but wasn't great either  Main complaint every single time put course down front we table 4 dishes wrong  OK  nice restaurant know where each plate going each person ordered   As far decor underwhelmed  small restaurant bar across floor stunning but restaurant ambiance so    I enjoyed food but didn't blow away  spoiled last 2 weeks number amazing meals bar pretty high  But   I really looking forward trying Chef Gagnaire's food  liked variety  but times much going just lost  3 scallops appetizer really liked one  Same thing foie gras   Veal main course which quite good  don't even remember if ordered dessert    probably just espresso point  <EOR> My husband did 6 course tasting but substituted courses foie gras appetizer at additional charge course   foie gras appetizer foie gras 4 different ways think   it amazing especially custard seared versions  thought food really good but times little adventurous i e  langoustine tartar   privilege going some pretty nice restaurants past though thought food good don't think blew away  husband agreed next time if come back we'd just foie gras app main course dessert bypass tasting   Service good decor trendy but think pretty small restaurant  <EOR> Amazing! I'd actually give 4 5 stars but doesn't seem option  made reservation two weeks before emailed someone off website heard back right away table 9PM Saturday night which thought great  personally thought decor beautiful   understated modern but classy   I told reservationist preferred eat vegan when seated waiter brought through menu point would suitable vegetarian choices could changed  also adjusted amuse well  Points off fact thing definitely vegan cream sauce sat film over it  happened delicious though no big deal!  If you're want special meal Las Vegas here  liked didn't walk into noisy casino people carrying yards margaritas  <EOR>
