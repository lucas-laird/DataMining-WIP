Learn read table  don't come ask every 5 minutes if okay  tell if okay walking table observing  If eye contact LOOK need THEN come over   6 Sense urgency  Yeah rush may over but there's still work do  Watching waiter mull around dining room unnerving  fun walking into store watching shop girls gossip each other instead servicing customer getting ready more customers   Finally    food       I Kurobuta sausage appetizer sausages cooked perfectly slightly crisp skin clicked your teeth pierced through  could used more mustard though  last 2 sausages eaten dry because wasn't any more mustard dish   The truffle fries good when kitchen heavier truffle second try    Pork belly steam buns unusual twist peking duck buns  horseradish sauce pretty good but particularly liked dipping sliced boiled egg it   What most memorable cherry yuzu soda  loved it  delicious  I'd come back just soda   The potential great totally here  Nice people work here  But need better training  don't realize they're doing anything wrong   If could see taste past service food good  But once guest sour taste mouth because service hard past it   I know guys new working kinks  really want love place come back month see if service changed when update review  <EOR> I'm big fan burgers but good thing fish burger  price pretty pricey  15 bucks which includes fries drink  Dam  lot  only burger drinks fries pricey but wait long  took hour food  If read reviews wait pretty long  think owner came asked doing asked long does take burger  He said 12 mins   Hmmmmm     Why did take hour?? Anyways fish burger really good  really liked fried too  would definitely come back place if town  <EOR> I randomly read place Yelp since going Vegas decided try out   nice eat off Strip sometimes   definitely oddly located missed first   pretty dead lunch didn't wait long food   asked beef turns beef comes Kansas some other corn states   waiter ask someone back but he said cows grass fed   ground all meat in house   Prices definitely pricier side considering portions   fact friend order another burger split w someone bc he still hungry   All burgers similar taste think patties glazed some sort sweet sauce but toppings made difference   tried three burgers all good though liked Bachi Burger best  Bachi Burger Kalbi Burger Bahn Mi Burger I'd recommend all them though Kalbi Burger nothing special   kim chee use spicy all made regular cabbage  Pork Belly Buns Good but filling all    two tiny buns   Nice snack maybe  Truffle Parmesan Fries Shoestring crispy fries   Yummy!!  also asked side pineapple ketchup should really bottle stuff  Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee $3 50 interesting taste bc whipped cream made w salt   wasn't sweet would liked but definitely different   Another friend came later ordered turkey chicken burger but never came   Apparently waiter forgot she ended canceling waiting long time   bill came $51 including tip   waiter reminded Jimmy Fallon but taller nice did best answer all questions   I'd definitely come back next trip Vegas though wish portions bigger!!  PS website says open daily 11 a m  2 a m  but sign door stating close 10 p m  Sundays   sure which true but I'd sign! <EOR> So when walk new restaurant Yelp cycle kicked many 5 star reviews random people even some friends level anticipation expectation   alluded previous review  Its probably warranted but its unavoidable! few friends Bachi Burger giddy school      boy   Bachi oddly located strip mall missed first pass unfortunately them entry door end place imagine hard tracking new arrivals   venue itself small sit down type place clean modern simple   2 flat screens wall news foodtv running some entertainment variety   Our server came quick being seated drink served right away  menu if name didnt give away already asian inspired several options food drinks yay boba tea   ordered Kiki burger truffled parmesan fries   first thing taste burger bun oh boy tasty!  Its asian style sweet bun awesome  meat very fresh all ingredients good harmony together everything tasted great  fries expected more truffle flavor but fell just little short   The only thing kinda bugged server kept trying take plates little food left it  Now kicker would highly recommend place anyone town but only 4 star review me   Why? Because 5 stars perfection  place fell just short flavor profiles  Everyone table agreed great burger great price but just weren't blown away  coming back shortly ordering few other things update review then! <EOR> My husband just moved area town every time drove place more more curious  decided read reviews Yelp since they're mostly all good finally stopped few days ago try food   The people really nice  tell they're still getting used place since only open less month some aren't sure describe some items menu but overall they're helpful attentive very friendly  restaurant very clean servers great job keeping clean  wait food little long but haven't ever heard Patience virtue  ? just made food taste even better   We started Sautéed Edamame w Truffle Oil Garlic addicting! tried Crusty Crab which fantastic!! crab cake patty tender flavorful mango chutney sauce perfect  also Truffle Parmesan Fries which yummy!

Something other faceless ownership bland environs Chain Food Hell  when indie place falters aspects cheap prices awesome service bolster them  But Bachi lacks nearly all positive traits small business  Personality? None  Bargains? Zero  Service? Conspicuously lame  leaves food  while admittedly good Bachi *that* good   PRO TIP Another establishment  MANAGEMENT Take page your competition PERSONABLE! You're brand new restaurant only gets word mouth unique concept    so why isn't owner manager greeting customers when walk sit down introducing himself concept restaurant? only does help better sell place but easier give benefit of the doubt when something wrong  <EOR> Went boyfriend Thursday [5 27] heard place coworkers month earlier  bit drive but hey they're open until 1am!
