Came lunch before trip Walmart  big fan Panda Express since am accustomed authentic Asian food but same time terrible enough hate  clean restaurant but portions pretty stingy  most Pandas give ton rice noodles least stinginess entrees if even stingy entrees really depends person serving you but location  bf pointed perhaps if ordered might gotten more  outdoor seating  facing parking lot street which made quieter more relaxing eat outside  We'll probably back order food hopefully stingy  <EOR>
