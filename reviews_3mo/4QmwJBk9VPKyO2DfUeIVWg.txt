This bar style restaurant  If during day expect wait while   waitresses running around crazy getting some personal attention kind hard  put peace flags smoke signals  The food okay  wrap wasn't bad way down but later upset tummy   friend tuna melt wasn't happy all  But  heard dinner gets much better   that    Acceptable but recommendable  <EOR>
