Today forgot lunch decided lunch break ventured down Maryland Parkway restaurant  normally Cafe Rio nice change   Upon entering somewhat island themed restaurant really nice colors  really use past along dark brown wood seating  looked menu plethora different food selections could choose  Although looked all photos Yelp all look delicious decided volcano chicken sandwich regular French fries iced tea   The volcano chicken sandwich topped Swiss cheese cilantro Mayo pineapple salsa lettuce red onions  chicken itself seasoning rather large piece chicken  perfectly grilled placed delicious white bun  Now bun your typical bun delicious artisan tight bun perfect large portion chicken place inside along all garnishments come your sandwich   I work took first bite literally shocked  chicken tender perfectly cooked juicy didn't even put salt it  those know put salt everything even before taste very nasty habit LOL   regular French fries cooked perfectly seasoned really well didn't try  sweet potato fries  but looked delicious  opted drink cup bring back believe its only $0 25 refill next time come  chose iced tea lemon really liked tea tasted kinda hibiscus mango super yummy!!  I def reccommend going trying sandwiches also daily specials during week which include drink!! <EOR> Just ate Rumbi island chicken sandwich  great! definitely eat again  <EOR> Amazing food friendly staff  Brought 4 year old over heard birthday coming came said if came back birthday shed free dessert which amazing staff work me   customer come back happy kid  Food awesome live your own rice bowl  <EOR> This place great Hawaiian twist menu  twice first time Luau Pork Sandwich which kalua pig sandwich made cole slaw  surprisingly tasty! kalua pig home all time know should taste like  second visit Kahuna Burger which made teriyaki sauce pineapple some veggies  surprisingly tasty well! burgers which pretty big option ordering Rumbi fries which crinkled sweet potato fries served regular fries I just wish ratio Rumbi fries regular fries higher   sauce comes fries also very good!  The interior bright clean modern splashes Hawaiian art although space bit small side  staff nice very helpful  also very patient took time deciding order   Overall give Rumbi's 5 star rating based menu cleanliness restaurant helpful staff  <EOR>
