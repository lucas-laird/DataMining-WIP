Bottom line foods taste  rubber    pricey $35   cheaper  better food IHOP next building   daughter  told reminded  come back here   gave them 1 star due nice little restaurant  <EOR> The name Truffles n' Bacon definitely lures customers  Saw place try because doesn't love bacon! cute blue pig character modern french look restaurant place definitely looks appealing fun hang out  However brought down rating place service food  Sadly upon siting waiting see every table came order food first served before someone came take order  waiters seemed disorganized kitchen slow  Now someone expect customer service hasty food but if you're going wait terrible service food better it  Well didn't  Tried several dishes let's just say nothing seemed fresh  fries stale cold when served any dish biscuits just avoid completely because hard rock fork can't even break salad served some dishes bad because greens almost brown  Now most popular dish burger Mac n cheese  would hope most popular dish least well made least disappointing dish  burger bacon jelly although interesting didn't taste bacon more sloppy joe mix  Now really excited mac n cheese but boy did disappoint burger  mac n cheese did stick together fell apart ate barely any taste hello    where cheese mac n cheese? Now could only two ketchup bottles restaurant two bottles available empty could talk limited items menu over priced but think ranted enough  feel place look but some changes need made staff possibly menu  least place food fresh higher quality  Unless some changes made don't think coming back sucks cause love bacon btw weren't many items available bacon   <EOR> Came across little gem while bike riding neighborhood  thought anything bacon plus truffles  Yum  wanted come breakfast but when arrived lunch time  decided mushroom blt Brie sourdough small side sinful tots bacon truffle oil   seemed open only two months need work service however extremely polite   think just need more time figure out  Seems staff confused times  Overall great food back <EOR> Love ambiance hospitality here  food bomb! Try Your Mama's Grilled Cheese  won't regret it  bread pudding pretty good too! <EOR> This place amazing bacon jam   grilled cheese brisket Incredible Hulk best grilled chicken sandwich ever had  <EOR> Nice clean inside but VERY limited menu! Sunday brunch literally three breakfast items choose from  quite sure is    Cafe? Coffee house? Tea room? Little over priced well  <EOR> Another case coming into place high hopes high reviews menu looked pretty good  Truffles bacon just great combination   Service when first came very weird  Nobody quite seemed know should come seat us  Then assumed couple standing several feet behind part group  Again just awkward   And awkwardness continued through entire lunch  far most awkward restaurant eaten at  food alright nothing excited eat   However just came random intervals  wife's meal came first then starter then solid 20 minutes later ask sandwich realize gave table across us   He never he wanted told them just cancel it  felt bad him  He wasn't happy sandwich  If constructed mine though understand it   Sinful Tots good but $7 50 want something mroe bacon crumbled bbq sauce over looked run mill frozen Ore Ida tots  Sandwich alright except construction pretty    awkward  Big glob center bread nothing outsides   And salad just no dressing  wife's did  something  also didn't any sort acknowledgement Hey sorry watch someone eat lunch while sat empty space front once did your server come over 20 minute period time ask   would cool  also would less thirsty   Way overpriced get  Nothing close worth when compare other restaurants same price point both terms service food   And best part Watching them clean tables  Something looks unused silverware table? Don't clean just rearrange table! guess important save water but    move off table if you're going reuse it  <EOR> Just third visit won over egg salad smoked salmon sandwich called Simply Jessie    just handful places area egg salad sandwich  Im bumping place top egg salad sure!    What you'll love egg salad light whipped but creamy  great smoked salmon   tasted really fresh  Oh good! marbled rye bread simply delicious  egg salad you're nice treat!  This sandwich also came salad greens plus your choice sides fries tots additional 50 cents    additional 2 50 little side Piggie Wedgie   potato wedges topped shredded slow roasted pork cotija cheese garlic crema  pretty good but ended being much food me   sandwich alone pretty filling  keep mind    Nice see Truffles n Bacon getting back groove   Starting little shaky there  Soft opening rough starting first day kitchen especially when able test equipment prior first day  Great see running more smoothly addressed concerns  shared other reviewers    They increased staff which did great!  young lady server nice confident knowledgeable menu items  Other staff floor friendly attentive also   They additional help kitchen well   visit order came promptly   Everything presented made order hot   For those tried Chef Jackie's TnB Burger when TnB over Antiques Market you'll happy see permanently back menu!   I why now called place Truffles n Bacon  reason why bacon jam! Chef Jackie's version favorite!  Perfect balance savory sweet! wish would more dishes incorporated bacon jam   deserves prominently featured   Another reason just sets tone place fancy Truffles comfort Bacon   Chef Jackie very talented culinary treat!   Their new place Pebble Eastern where Regal Collonade Theatre pretty nice!  Huge dining area  Beautiful artwork graces walls   Look more working space exposed kitchen well    Only minor gripe    menus printed paper grease spots food stains crinkled little turn off  laid good easy read though!   With improvements made past two months menu items offered Im looking forward more visits here    And someone mentioned review tea service? didn't see any mention menu daily special menu board gotta check next time too! Tea time anyone? <EOR> Nice inviting atmosphere  Magnolia promptly greeted when arrived very personable during dining  food great presentation delicious  <EOR> On first impression restaurant when first walked in very clean atmosphere very quaint Decor really nice well wall color  waitress Magnolia very friendly down earth  ordered steak egg biscuit gravy hashbrowns amazing  would recommend place everyone <EOR> Service subpar  Walked seated older woman  1 year old son yet ask high chair being seated waiting someone walk table   Then took 5 minutes someone bring high chair table   Only 3 other tables seated  so busy   then took them almost 10 minutes return table drink orders    didn't know use iPads put orders busy chatting each other take care us    The only reason rating 3 stars due food  the food Yumm! When finally took order truffle tots husband pastrami grilled cheese fried chicken biscuit sandwich yogurt parfait son  all delish! service though needs some big improvement     <EOR> Got signature burger crispy Mac cheese bacon jam side sweet potato fries  very delicious lots food cost 15 bucks no drink  burger very rich last couple bites almost much but would definitely back try something different <EOR> The worst service ever  She took husbands order dropped off ice tea then didn't come back take order  asked other waitress take order  She did  no place other couple  no excuse poor service   Food greasy horrible horrible  Never asked if wanted more drink   She cell phone  ask check  Limited menu  would hate see if busy think she owner    give 3 months  <EOR>
