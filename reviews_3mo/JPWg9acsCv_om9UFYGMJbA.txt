I hate chain restaurants especially sick uber steakhouse trend   However advice some reviews gave Flemings try when visiting cousin Las Vegas couple years ago   remains  possibly best steak ever had   cooked bit long never able attention waiter fixed thus star knock   I'd return heartbeat upside being chain may able recreate magic closer home day  <EOR> Went anniversary say place but wow!!! really know wine dine here  first place ever didn't season steak add any kind sauce all  Filet Mignon rare  say melt your mouth butter? Oh man! Everything la carte meaning you'll order steak sides extra  Even though place drive strip worth it  little high side but once again those places pay get  can't wait visit again  <EOR>
