Their dessert portions HUGE!!! 1 piece enough family! No prices them ask  flan only OK kinda hard chewy  bagels hot dogs cheap too  <EOR> Inside South Point Casino great spot late night snack dinner   Tried both Corned Beef Pastrami sandwiches both really good huge    I also Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain stale thus 3 star rating    but if toasted cream cheese sandwich then probably would better  However prefer Carneige Deli Mirage  <EOR>
