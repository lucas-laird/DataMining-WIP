I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if succulent wrappers used encase dumpling fillings hand made dumplings assemble cook order  major comfort food category me  fact ?? boiled dumplings first item ever personally ordered own lunch money mom gave elementary school Taipei  just few pennies each shop made delivered plastic bag school name just time lunch break   don't remember much tasted but memory having tremendous emotional satisfaction joy simple meal still very strong   So while driving try new ramen place few miles down street light new restaurant caught eye decided quick but very safe u turn into small parking lot front Dumpling King   plenty spaces back building case restaurant gets super popular coming weeks  initially afraid dropping restaurant close since fairly empty inside but looking hours operation relieved see 1 25 hours left   I made quick scan restaurant pretty much blinded all red color restaurant   Red floral printed seat covers over each chair   tablecloth reddish color lighting fairly dim yeah slightly disoriented color red   wonder if normal reaction just those minor details made just little different other 6 odd billion people planet not including aliens left zigzag lights over skies Hawaii    Anyway picking nearby table good lighting taking food pictures going over menu eventually found dumpling section all way last page under Main Food ordered following 101  Beef Steamed Dumplings 4 ???? Decent flavor but felt texture filling off  overground overworked   102  Beef Dumplings 4 ???? Same filling above except dumpling boiled   103  Lamb Dumplings 4 ???? Good dumpling nice lamb flavor  Dumpling also boiled looks exactly Beef Dumpling   112  Stone Dumplings ???? big plate full pot stickers cooked pan inverted onto plate  residual starchy water forms thin crust connects all dumplings together see picture    kind cool looking but eat fast   Because taking time take pictures all food came more less same time noticed small pool oil puddle plate 10 minutes which made taste good very first piece had   Just something think if dining solo eat very slowly   NOTE Although menu prices listed dumplings portions 4 told misprint now minimum order 8 dumplings now need order those items x2   But Beef Lamb Dumplings comes 8 pieces $5 bad price wise but does present additional hurdle against trying much menu possible without asking doggie bag   did however let order four pieces each Beef Dumplings Lamb Dumplings total eight pieces since both cooked same way   Overall thought food A OK family operated restaurant Mom son both works front dad likely kitchen cooking    closest Chinese dumpling restaurant where live now stopping near future   Plus asked see if also Xiao Long Bao given calling themselves Dumpling King serve many dumpling specialties same region told just added menu day   Would nice offer such information when reading menu time placing orders but oh well  Just another reason back  Maybe later dinner   Credit cards accepted but when gave them AmEx card AmEx sticker along usual suspects front door but asked pay different card because American Express charges higher fee perhaps but more likely due AmEx distributing funds merchant clients entire billing cycle   Yeah pretty much all small vendors hating AmEx think if old enough once dominated credit card market  Oh mighty fallen indeed     3 5 stars   am sure another update forth coming should try XLB next visit   Review #26 2014 <EOR> Finally northern chinese food place vegas looking forever  owner super friendly food good if enjoy traditional northern chinese food  <EOR> New dumpling resturant sure if anyone else recommend other dumpling resturants but very delicious    I brought friends LA enjoyed too!
