BEEF BROCCOLI?  FORGET IT! Another visit arrived 10 30 asked beef broccoli  It'll 9 minute wait told  assumed solo attendant would order started right away  NO! She finished waiting other five customers first   then halfway through meal   She explained beef broccoli best consumed fresh  hurried preparation compromised quality however  Forget beef broccoli   Choose something else   It's staff's fault   proprietor seeks maximize profits hiring single multitasking attendant  many businesses practically guaranteed steady flow customers couldn't care less any customer's experience   If work around problems location throws bad place grab bite before shopping  <EOR>
