alright came dinner 'cause fast but fast food didn't require reservation didn't require spending arm leg some famous chef's Vegas outpost never actually visited said chef  Besides most them SF anyway can't home! Dinner passable  chain food served its purpose   rosemary cornbread yummy   ribs pretty good but connoisseur fried chicken crisp outside tender inside   Beers only available bottle oddly enough   Dinner two cost same would buffet least food freshly made can't that  <EOR>
