Definitely come back try other things see like  <EOR> Am only without blown mind while eating Other Mama? suppose so  Perhaps expecting lot Other Mama due wonderful reviews high star ratings head chef trained under Morimoto  yeah expecting some world mind blowing unforgettable dishes     but truth told quite disappointed    My friend night dinner sat bar  chatted David English little restaurant menu  started Mildred which composed bicardi lime strawberry mint soda while friend Beryl which mix apricot buffalo trace blood orange bitters yuzu tincture  Both drinks priced $9  Both pretty good aside Beryl being little bit strong due whiskey but no problem! English it! He added more sugar help dilute helped!   We started off half dozen oysters  three types oysters special night Fanny Bay Bluepoint other can't seem remember name of  chose two each  LOVED them  simply LOVE oysters indeed VERY FRESH  top freshness price point die for! Fanny Bays $1 50 each  Bluepoints $1 00 each  third most brine $2 00 each  Where else amazingly fresh oysters price Las Vegas?

Sorta tail end stocked items hence fresh perhaps     With some stellar yet mixed reviews other items original goal stuff face oysters only but know all those options your face hard walk away JUST oysters    Semi Spoil Alert!  Oyster prices gone 50 cents! Yeah yeah know some don't give crap 50cents but super stoked solid number $1 $2 change  course bound happen increasing popularity time    Duck Island $2   Fanny Bay $2 Beau Soleil $2 5 Kumamoto $2 5  No $1 oysters available day dream shattered  2 each try them all out    My favorite Fanny Bay all them ordered two more  wasn't fresh hoped  Granted Las Vegas transporting stuff across land no seas expected but unfortunately neither mentally expected nor noted me    Amberjack Crudo 4 stars  delicious probably highlight meal    Caviar French Toast 1 star   I read some review having french toast warm? Ours seemed refrigerated taken out  special menu  fact erased off special menu order 5 30 p m  30 minutes opening might sign having last bit left earlier week  waiter told ran he erasing off board  thought okay  Definitely good enough $19 6 pieces  somehow just found photo where dish 8 pieces which wonder   did serving fall short due them running out? did actually reduce pieces give out  No es bueno mi amigos  NO ES BUENO   So all stuff bill came $70 tax tip  half full   My husband haze such disappointment meal he did unbelievable  hit another restaurant immediately attempts ameliorate disappointment when bill came he realized he left credit card Other Mother  heads low drive back pick up    Perhaps rave reviews other yelpers definitely set high expectations place  Service great waiter being super approachable cool waters being full  even nice chat chef owner   Great interior open feel nice cool spot gives twist restaurant name staff would expect Asian fusion restaurant    Would back? Hmmmmm think giving fresh oysters Las Vegas MAYBE would back Amberjack but  it  IMHO prices high think worth  Oh sweet potato chips definitely worth trying  $3 plate nice snack  <EOR> Hidden gem   Kimchee fried rice oysters amazing! Just sure fairly early because sold several items while there  def making spot part routine   <EOR> Definitely only table grey haired tourists perhaps offer different perspective other diners  But maybe different    most reviewers solid four stars  It looks joint outside inside modest  Prices modest too  The oysters beers bargain which even well healed traveler appreciate  The Pork Belly Kim Chi excellent   Perhaps could spicier some but very much taste pork belly butter but better    Ceviche very generous well prepared   spend fair amount time Peru many ways preparation very good  Asparagus tempura crisp overdone   par Raku truly great more expensive Las Vegas restaurant    The Shrimp Jalapeño Hush Puppies exceptional   Good enough expensive  The Rib Eyes very good but steak steak  So boil down staff wonderful   Enthused friendly    Because late Foie Gras seems first time treated round drinks   above expected appreciated  The food sometimes bit cutting edge admirable    It refreshing leave convention halls mega hotels see chef really working craft   place bases loaded home run but lot fun bit audacious solid three bagger   open mind really enjoy it  <EOR> The food great friends REALLY enjoyed cocktails! Try devil eggs wings good  Definitely worth trying  <EOR> Other Mama located Durango just North Spring Mountain inside same center restaurants Norm's TC's  restaurant itself small side somewhat tucked into back corner complex  Inside you'll find modern but homey inviting feel  There's minimal seating alongside fairly small bar I'd imagine there's going wait during peak times   but worth it   In addition regular menu they've also daily special board hangs wall towards back restaurant  looks many items rotate but visit some non standard specials including $1 oysters  There's plenty options between two even few things those don't eat seafood  stomach able take would likely ordered everything menu  Instead party 3 decided share few things     Spicy Edamame Per 6 years olds request started these  Solid starter but live name  They've kick much him  sucker spicy food though couldn't stop eating them  use dry seasoning opposed spicy sauce find lot other spots   $1 Bluepoint Oysters Juicy plump delicious   and cheap  ordered two sauces Pickled Pepper Habanero Ponzu Salsa  Neither did much taste  habanero flavor basically nonexistent first although salsa great flavor didn't think complimenting oyster well  see sauces great praise maybe just off visit?   Oyster Foi Rockefeller order oyster rockefeller normally but foie mix couldn't resist  Then came ate them asked eachother foie?   seen pictures ours looked maybe half foie others maybe less  Maybe just off visit but based wouldn't order them again   White Fish Ceviche Paired perfectly crisped sweet potato chips must try opinion  Unlike prior sauce ceviche very present but enjoyable habanero kick  fresh cilantro nice balance aren't skimpy fish  When run chips delicious own   trust one   Amberjack Crudo Quite possibly most popular dish good reason  Fresh tender fish delicious sauce little bit sweetness little kick  first time having amberjack thanks Other Mama constantly craving order anytime restaurant it   Live Scallop Excellent! Sliced thin but still nice rich tender buttery taste  Absolutely delicious own good even 6 year old couldn't stop eating it    Overall pretty much everything great aside oyster foie I'd order everything again heartbeat  Must tries opinion ceviche amberjack live scallop    Unfortunately service wasn't quite excellent  waitress seemed little rushed questions bothering her  Since seated only couple other tables full bit disappointing  also bussers take two plates food them without asking if done  Just walked straight table grabbed them quick gone  food without hitch drinks stayed full but service nothing write home about   A few little hiccups but still extremely enjoyable experience me  Other Mama only open less 3 months mine just many positive reviews keep flowing in  If you've yet come stop procrastinating  <EOR> We Peter server very funny knowledgeable reepects peers there  food amazing small menu enough order everything menu try tapas style  cross cut fries super crispy seasoned perfectly  oysters foie gras delicious  desserts them all wow surprise  Loved every bite  back soon tell all friends fam place  <EOR> Unbelievably amazing!!! Love rustic Asian fusion place  Sat bar met Chefs Dan Stan  adore comfortable feels almost going while  bartender point mixology knowledge  But saving best last     the food    INCREDIBLE!!! GREAT JOB!!!! <EOR> Oh em gee! little hidden gem amazing! Service point food top notch ambiance very cozy  ordered great variety things Caviar French Toast Amberjack Crudo Octopus Carpaccio Pork Belly Kim Chee Fried Rice Softshell Crab  first just ordered crab then saw also made sandwich! Ok Softshell crab light batter some cornmeal mix super meaty cooked perfection served nice ponzu sauce  Now sandwich     if crab wasn't good enough added nice piece oh tender flavorful pork belly nice Asian slaw top off fried egg all served soft brioche bun! say mouth gasam?!  House made waffle cut potato chips smoked ketchup accompany amazing sandwich   Jean excellent! Changed plates even crumbed table! don't find often casual places this  definitely back again! soon! <EOR> I idea Asian fusion tapas fusion fine dining  other mama luckily did just pretty innovative tasteful way  Parking wasn't hassle all since area pretty much dead exception small bar sushi restaurant near by    Inside seating pretty open well never seem problems being seating because being crowded  ordered oysters Korean kimchi fried rice mint cucumber rolls tuna poke live scallop wings  most part really enjoyed cucumber mint roll topped off little ikera really refreshing taste similar Vietnamese spring roll    The kimchi fried rice okay but came off slightly bland especially since Korean used eating dish regularly  wings also mediocre didn't seem stand but warning bit spicy kick  oysters made place though me  oysters San Francisco fresh lack any fishy taste ever smooth eat    This place comes close second fresh oysters try 3 sauces accompany your sampler  best part them 1 50$ each! Idk if regular price thing part happy hour but any time fresh oysters under 2$ always take advantage it  If you're looking new fusion fine dining tapas place try grab some oysters bar I'd suggest other mama  <EOR>
