I never El Pollo Loco before no idea expect  going Taco Bell Del Taco? Turns completely different aforementioned fast food joints  When walked huge grill behind counter loaded suprise pollo  unexpected because chicken looked fresh supermarket quality  Plus just shit ton it  also liked fact actual salsa bar    I coupon stuffed quesadilla combo came drink chips $5  ordered quesadilla enchilada style pretty substantial tasted better expected  wait time longer would liked  took 10 minutes  gave buzzer order  WTF? buzzer fast food joint? Anyways since took little long food gave free brownie!  Customer service great  think greeted 3 seperate times  brand new location tell employees still getting hang things  All all El Pollo Loco bit pricier say Del Taco but food higher quality  <EOR> I pleasant experience  Food fresh service prompt through drive through  little difficult hearing employee through intercom drive thru  <EOR> In general El Pollo Loco   location though brand new appears some minor growing pains work through   First think need hire more help   noon just every table dirty   whole time no came clean   can't guarantee but looking behind counter appeared only two people working   second music overly loud pretty awful   getting tired going into restaurants being blasted bubblegum pop especially when average age clientele probably 40    Plus Mexican ish restaurant   Something little more ethnic might nice I'm talking mariachi bands    While only songs played Spanish   Neutrally food seems same any other El Pollo Loco location though cilantro dressing bit thin today    On positive side I'd say particular location very nice looking   floor to ceiling windows three sides very open feeling   I also suggestion all El Pollo Locos instead microwaving your tortillas which just bland commercial things tossing them onto your grill   might watch timing but might add some much needed flavor them  <EOR> Very disappointed ! I eating El Pollo Loco  years but last night disappointed food ate tasted bad won't come back long long time  <EOR> This bad El Pollo Loco location  few times lunch break food messed each time back corrected  said didn't want any guacamole avocado yet food  said wanted bean cheese burrito put rice it  ordered carnitas taco chicken taco  wait drive thru inside ridiculous waiting long time even getting right order only done again just isn't right  chocolate churro actually tasted burnt nasty  crushed oreo cookie gone wrong  Definitely better locations  <EOR>
