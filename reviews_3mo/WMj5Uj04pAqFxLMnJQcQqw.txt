Jesus sunk new low   eating Panda Express because when ate Wasabi Jane's year before Venetian Food Court sick grease   figured Panda Express could better job   god did!  I ordered Mandarin Chicken Lo Mein which basically some chicken bean sprouts thick flat rice noodles kind shaped udon but longer squared off    actually cook took forever   definitely fast food   But least fresh overly oily   also enjoyed icy iced water gave me     I watched workers check temperature food change soup basically clean every 2 seconds between each customer   would say fairly pleasant experience   I still can't believe it  <EOR>
