My girlfriend accidentally first people eat Namaste  area very familiar great places tucked away Commercial Center  recall considering going Komol favorite Thai food restaurants hangouts when saw Namaste finally open  both love Indian food she primarily eats vegetarian Indian restaurants easy targets us   THE LUNCH BUFFET $9 MISSED! Indian buffets hit or miss  Some put standard dishes only two really yummy entrees set out  Namaste! pull all stops many favorite dishes same time    Mind place new many new places start way then downhill but don't think case Namaste  Chef owner Om Singh reputation precedes culinary world suspect quality Namaste endure   We eaten many times since opened every meal outstanding  Most notably VEGETARIAN DINNER TWO $40 perfect  first course last exceptionally yummy  main courses all super good plentiful lot left overs lunch next day  dessert especially carrot REALLY GOOD   The wait staff very friendly constantly circling floor  atmosphere decent comfortable  attend discussion group every Sunday afternoon usually dinner afterward  Komol regular haunts but now seems Namaste new default location  <EOR> I really love place!  Me friend lunch buffet couple weeks ago finding coupon Vegas booklets  think coupon might've buy 1 1 free really good deal    Once walk enter somewhat small dining area dark walls dark furniture which gave pretty nice ambiance  Once seated just over buffet area  looks pretty small but more enough! tried EVERYTHING buffet ALL DELICIOUS! tried eat much possibly could because good  favorite Palak Panneer just incredible!  made 3 trips buffet just more more that   stuffed!   I definitely recommend lunch buffet anyone wants nice taste Indian food low price! back asap once find someone me! <EOR> If best Indian food Las Vegas some other cuisine   Daal very good  Bhindi good  Pakoras dry salty  Chicken kabab dry  Rest average   If drink beer try Kingfisher standard 12oz bottle   Avoid Indian beers come larger bottles  <EOR>
