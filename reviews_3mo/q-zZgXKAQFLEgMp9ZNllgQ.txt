Alex took pride fact he made broth scratch he should  it tasty but Japanese any means     Service definitely top things   3 waiters checking throughout meal earned gratuity  <EOR> You gotta just see Alex Pete Eric Show crazy! sushi chefs just amazing thing place  love all reasons though promise!  First menu EX TEN SIVE  AYCE place many choices granted some 1X only mind blowing  nigiri appetizers right down mochi hoping second stomach time all said done  certainly needed one!

I'm headed back few months once all sushi digested  Wow ate much  Enjoy! <EOR> This place used called Kaizen didn't AYCE sushi   But Friday night wife looking AYCE sushi spot saw place everywhere else crazy 1 1 5 hr wait   decided try place out   immediately took because atmosphere spacious   wasn't crowded nor place most sushi spots where small compact there's barely any room walk on    The staff very friendly warm   menu very extensive! actually 4 whole pages food including huge amount foods aren't seafood ish   know many people would say why sushi spot eat seafood sushi? Well some people something called allergies don't want them excluded especially since brother allergic shellfish nephew allergic freshwater fish   really awesome plenty great choices those cannot enjoy certain aspect sushi eating   Including steak teriyaki noodles beef pork chicken dishes     My favorite Snow White Ono nigiri   But  Tuna sashimi w AJ sauce die for   wife loves oysters she said uni very fresh   food just all around very good fresh well prepared   We loved place much back family next evening   would definitely going back again! <EOR> Best ayce sushi restaurant town ! chef alex best sushi dont even order  He already knows prepares when he sees walking in  5 stars all way <EOR> Went bf Monday night  busy night restaurant  only 5 6 tables occupied just couple per table    I noticed immediately service little slow little unorganized  seated though immediately but orders taken 15 minutes  mentioned kind unorganized because male server took orders 5 minutes female server approached table asked if orders taken   Now let's rate food     I say fish quality good fish very fresh firm Nigiris    Grilled seafood so    eaten better   Deep fried items also so    soft shell crab ordered drenched oil  Also don't put dipping sauce side but just drizzle dish more wet rather crispy light outside moist inside  Rolls okay    ordered Tuna Tataki Rating 7 10 Snow White 4 10     I say though Seared Tuna AJ sauce something different really good  bad only 1 order per person   Desserts    Also ordinary per person too  tried mango mochi tempura ice cream   Maybe back say Goyemon still best AYCE town! <EOR> We stumbled upon location tucked shopping plaza off Flamingo Arville across Palms Hotel Casino    Is anything better taking chance restaurant finding hidden gem could become absolutely favorite?!?!  By far largest AYCE menu selections  Although some selections 1x order only absolute must try!   The staff friendly attentive  When gf ordered food came rather quickly  seafood salad absolutely yummy!  The decor beautifully understated  Long tables wooden benches  average sushi spot tables  Great place groups!   $25 99 AYCE  dinner two two drinks walked completely stuffed sushi mochi ice cream hour half later bringing total $62 59  <EOR> I definitely money's worth $26 95 AYCE totally worth here! couple friends wanted check place dinner  ALL glad did    As everyone saying large selection appetizers BUT feel most AYCE sushi restaurants now a days such Oyishi  What say stood fact skewers AYCE man did order bunch bacon wrapped scallop skewers  A MAAZING  put little much eel sauce but over quickly    We also ordered ** seared tuna sashimi AJ sauce** totally recommend this  zesty flavor  bad only 1 order per person but  reason why  womp womp womp    Baked mussels alright when reached weren't super hot   I didn't fresh oysters tasted really fishy straight ocean  But hooray included AYCE    I really crispy rice texture chewy crisp love it  crispy rice tuna appetizer which loved much ordered 2 orders it    We ordered TON sushi rolls  all made perfection  Baked rolls  baked perfectly delivered hot  While regular rolls weren't wrapped much sushi bite size looked delicately rolled    I recommend getting **snow white roll** **orange blossom roll**   I also ordered mackerel end all sushi roll rounds which mistake because hearty portion  give WHOLE mackerel    Dessert option kinda bleh only entire dessert list  your average dessert list sushi restaurants ie tempura ice cream mochi etc <EOR> The best selling point AYCE sushi spot addition $10 cost all drink draft beers house sake   But other really solid spot     Another thing Umiya did right being new adopting what's good getting rid didn't work   Umiya totally new former Kaizen Fusion   But name change severs any affiliation other Kaizen   except sushi names kept same     The only times come during slow hours before dinner service   Because slow service great   sit right bar even better faster service   Any time order straight Chef  should it   Trust works done Honey Salt   If come during lunch worth upgrading dinner price Uni Ama ebi Seared tuna sashimi     There some good items some AYCE grade sushi neither bad   If know look then ask more likely they'll he'll lie say he doesn't   Some few items asked salmon belly fresh wasabi yellowtail belly etc   some items but advertised anywhere ask    When come order everything order item which includes Baby Octopus Gingko if know herbal medical properties take vitamins then order if don't pork belly oysters   Ask specialty fishes every time come hasn't but keep asking   Uni good ama ebi little disappointed especially pre prepped head deep fried antennas     The ice cream good confirmed ordering second but different flavor   waitress gave hard time getting another even though told I'd pay another separate different check if she needed no language barrier knew only per AYCE  <EOR> Read all way end! Saved best last! We visited Umiya late lunch AYCE Tues  around 2 30 only other group seated virtually whole huge open place ourselves  Liked that! Once seated took ten minutes come take first order  say only thing service chilly but businesslike take order bring order clear plates take order bring order no eye contact no smile no re filling beverages unless requested  is  usually warm any chilly server but one! Might try sitting bar next time 100% reliant server    Nonetheless food pretty spectacular  If you're familiar AYCE sushi scene Vegas little hard impress short time  happy surprise delighted impressed long      The menu indeed very extensive  sure could visit many multiple times never duplicate yet leave full happily satisfied  Since trial run took some tips previous yelpers     1  Screaming O salad did mayonaise soup  Steer clear if don't heavy handed dose stuff  90% mayo coating thick mayo top three thin slices ahi underneath some lettuce swimming watery mayo soup bottom bowl  Now know    2  snow white roll orange blossom roll FRIKKIN AMAZING  Snow white roll each individual piece roll ever slightly grilled whisp smokey flavor  little tastebuds freaking out  Insanely good different! Orange blossom roll also enjoyably different  3  Red Rock roll kind forgettable but remember thinking ugh more mayonaise? 4  Rib eye steak just ok   5  Now there's thing menu discovered day would place EXQUISITE category  bacon wrapped scallop skewer  O  M  G  tiny little gems come two ONLY TWO? skewer  Just trust you're going want few these  popped first mouth just sit moment this?
