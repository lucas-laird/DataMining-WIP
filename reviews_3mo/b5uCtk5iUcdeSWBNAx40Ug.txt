I no idea why insists location closed    regular assure most definitely open business!  Midnight 4AM all drinks half off  pool darts never over crowded  You'll never want another scenester bar again   The only down side if you're looking food 1AM sure grab before hit door  cook leaves around then no food served  <EOR>
