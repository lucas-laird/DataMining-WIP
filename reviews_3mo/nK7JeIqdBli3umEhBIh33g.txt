We came lunch  place cutely decorated though bit faded around edges  seats hard tush!  Three all same salad wasn't wide sampling food  But good nicely dressed generous portion chicken   The waitress seemed little flighty  She originally brought soup realized mistake mumbled walked away  Meanwhile due mistake time ordered until time food took awhile  would better if she explained  maybe even comped soup   But menu inviting enough I'd try second time  <EOR>
