I've loving katsu place since original location Sahara Maryland Parkway   Everything tried far great  The Katsu perfect blend juicy crunchy katsu sauce absolute favorite  The Bar B Q beef juicy dry   Unlike other Hawaiian places don't need compensate mediocre food over marinating     Other favorites include Portugese Sausage Musubi BBQ Chicken Musubi Curry Katsu course Authentic Hawaiian cakes imported direct Mike's Bake Shop Waianae!! !   They don't always cakes but when better grab one   matter fact fresh Dobash fridge right now hear milk just calling name   back guys later  <EOR>
