Lots flavor truffled mayo mushrooms brie  bread amazing  big sandwich also  could only finish half it   Pork egg rolls came 4 pieces egg rolls deep fried topped w some slaw  pork wasn't very tender little spicy but still decent dish   As other reviews mentioned space cool trendy provides good view Treasure Island north part strip  <EOR> Had dinner while back  server Shay very attentive knowledgeable  food very good freshly made  few things really impressed   1  truffle pappardelle delicious only $13  2  music playing very cool   3  wine list priced WAY below strip standards   4  Overall great setting    They kind tucked away hotel hope place does well  certainly recommend everyone  <EOR>
