Maybe because NYE but workers friendly  connected convenience store also few slots gas station too  There's lot cars going parking lot   In general think Jack Box decent but location slightly disappointing because fries warm soft when received it   they room temperature kind crunchy  <EOR> Its clean its fast its good food wont break bank <EOR>
