The first time ordered everything pretty good  pie little undercooked taste but everything ok  second time just awful  pizza very undercooked cheese running everywhere calzone also undercooked nearly raw   So third time ordered everything near perfect  ordered Sicilian Garlic Knots  Garlic Knots similar New York  brought back home whole time devouring them  Sicilian definitely best town  tasty thick refrain  she said moment  also soft perfect chewiness it  rectangle cut into 8 squares  New York usually square pizza takes entire 16 box but common find them 8 slice rectangle  Which fine but absolutely love giant square style because those awesome center pieces which no crust just cheesy goodness every side  Just prepared probably longer wait if order Sicilian  first time tried order told wait least two hours WTF? starving ordered regular pie  next time prepared myself ordered early delivered hour half which very bearable considering expecting two hours   Now pricey but if food good last time ordered then isn't bad  few bumps along way could see place having potential  just need work consistency  holding back being regular here  <EOR> Biaggio joins Bo Yi Mei Champion Deli list absolute nicest owners could ever meet  People Biaggio precise reason why need support local businesses  Great food  Personal service  Owners aren't happy until you're happy   It New Year's Day friend looking place watch Rose Bowl  called Biaggio's sure they'd open he said they'd switch channel whatever wanted watch   When Biaggio somehow recognized Yelp  He knew ended backing CMYE  Wow! someone claims all internet savvy he sure does keep finger pulse social media   Long story short friend ordered Italian Stromboli Pastrami Stromboli  didn't realize huge would added some Garlic Knots good measure  Garlic Knots extremely moist doughy inside  they're huge! But nowhere near huge Strombolis  Even 3 hour game no way we'd able eat all food  Oh yes Strombolis all hyped be  personally Pastrami over Italian friend concurs  delicious   With Strombolis only half eaten food coma setting decided leave half time  Biaggio stops says some Fried Dough way  Um  OK  turn down free food such generous man? course Fried Dough awesome  basically pizza dough topped butter cinnamon powdered sugar  smelled really sweet but surprisingly mellow  few pieces added rest to go boxes   It without saying coming back  need try Chicken Wings everyone raving about  Also when mentioned boss loves pastrami he offered send Pastrami Stromboli when return work Monday  Now epitome generosity! sure supplement own order Chicken Wings    5 stars <EOR> I hate against grain but true pizza connoisseur would wrong hold back one  reference traveled NYC many many times lived Chicago awhile spent month Italy pizza favorite food earth  If know anything pizza!! never disappointed slice here    I laugh when read Vegas yelper complaints brick oven places having burnt pizza  NYC many order pizza extra well done relish beautiful black bubbles true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers  crust most bland tasteless cardboard crust ever had  crust flavor crust none  wasn't chewy wasn't crispy just blah    I thought Metro greasiest cheese town until tried Biaggio's  attached picture disgusting pool orange oozed every bite  know some way into whole grease thing but am not  If you're type wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms your place    In fairness did order lunch special 2 slices drink around 5 6 bucks perhaps pizza just doesn't reheat well should ordered fresh pie? Definitely hands down most tasteless greasy pizza ever yup including Sbarro Little Caesar's that!   pizza may appealing some but isn't anything pizza served NY  <EOR> We've Biaggio's twice week already! Once Monday second time Thursday but always go   fiancé ordered pizza wings Monday  WINGS DIE FOR! pretty much addicted wings could eat them all time  wings crunchy outside moist inside dipped ranch hot sauce its just irresistible  pizza thought good but nothing world  just plain pepperoni half mushrooms sausage other half   Last night decided try stromboli  actually bigger thought going be  Chicken artichokes red pepper  loved artichokes but other think would stick 6 99 stromboli's vs specialty stromboli which 12 99  Both meals ended around 30 bucks which seems lil pricey some pie wings  definitely back wings though  <EOR> So seeing plenty check ins reviews fellow Yelpers via Yelp App restaurant did realize just minutes away house  night wanted try something new sounds reviews place Must Try say Yelpers could never damn right!
