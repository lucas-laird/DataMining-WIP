So looking quick meal  thought myself whats inexpensive but quality pretty good Popeye's came mind  closest Popeye's near UNLV  never again  begin staff persons mopping floor while food being prepared am no health inspector but think its health hazard provided unsafe environment worker all just wearing tennis shoes  Second cashier asked if wanted spicy mild chicken told mild  She said I'd wait 15 minutes mild chicken said fine just give spicy  also ordered apple pie which she forgot give until asked said she didn't put original reciept  Anyway am fan Popeye's but location  <EOR>
