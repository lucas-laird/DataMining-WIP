We came 12 15 pm scurry clean table seat is  Okay  fine  But whole point ?? drink tea along your food! didn't any service tea 20 minutes into dining even though cart ladies already bombarding options    We ordered quite bit! Fung Zhao chicken feet classic dish  Pretty sweet spicy enough  But bad had! Har gau steamed shrimp dumpling Okay butchered  crystal skin cold falling apart  Siu Mai open topped steamed pork shrimp dumplings bit oily pork! But still yummy  *Be warned found piece hair this  Luckily could exchange it   * Jiu Cai Bau fried wheat starch skin dumpling chives yum! would again  bit oily side but stuffed good amount meat thin skin  Cha Siu Bao steamed BBQ pork stuffed buns Mehhh  huge fan item regardless where it  Cheong Fan rolled rice noodles errrr  Probably worst had  big soft other places! tiny stale    too much soy sauce added really cold! beef gross shrimp doable  Luckily didn't order many! Pei Guen steamed tofu skin roll Classic dish love! did okay seriously screw steaming this  But only complaint stuffing inside way little did classic bamboo shoots  Lo Mai Gai steamed glutinous rice flavorful all barely half teaspoon stuffing center  Regret! Daan taat egg custard tart disappointment like everything else   But guess good kiddos! bowl intestine soup  sweet but love intestines regardless  bowl pig blood soup  super clean taste still taste some freshness   Good portion though! plate stir fried beef rice noodles  Good! Pretty decent potion oily enough beef everyone    Pros Helpful service  patient helpful questions needs  cheap? would say 8 people only paid $85 before tax    Cons Not lot options rolling around  mean literally rolling around  classic Cheong fan wasn't being served unless requested it! No menus  nearing lunch time would think you'd give lung menu since cart ladies taking off! You'd frequent able understand doing     Tips Observations parking lot small! prepared circle around    Overall never again    I would check other places besides here  <EOR> Having tried just every dim sum place town there's no doubt try place out  did hold some type expectation place sister restaurant Jones but location serves dim sum     Overall would say place potential    SERVICE 4 5 Came late Monday afternoon lunch rush  packed but empty either  did run into problem being asked tea wanted one first things ask when seated notified them sitting around  sincerely apologetic surprised because most dim sum places wouldn't think twice it  ladies pushing cart also friendly  Didn't give whatever attitude  point finished all food no more carts pushed out  Again sat around then flagged someone down  Service great also apologetic guy offered bring over dishes wanted    ENVIRONMENT 2 5 I definitely think could work place looks  Maybe still process decorating since new? felt eating prison room nothing walls all  Oh well   I am food   FOOD 3 5 5 Unfortunately realized did try more offer which why docking off stars  Maybe because came peak lunch hours but still disappointing  should've prepared   heard good things flowing custard bun lau sa bao but said out  Wanted try favorites good ones nonexistent Vegas  apparently soup dumplings xiao long bao but none available   Shrimp dumplings ha gow rice noodle roll cheung fan egg tarts dan tat very good  Shrimp dumplings juicy loved soy sauce use rice noodle roll though admit noodle silky would wanted it  would say egg tarts more true Hong Kong style aka flaky crust! <EOR> Location easily visible parking accessible  Came party 6  didn't wait which great  offered decent amount choices dim sum  Spring rolls weren't part dim sum wait awhile those cooked  Hot tea priced per person  good amount staff during lunch time  However biggest turnoff dirty restrooms were! Really sad know cannot maintain cleanliness restrooms which kind speaks maintain kitchen   YELP 100 CHALLENGE #3 <EOR> Went dim sum lunch before heading Los Angeles  Yelped place thought worth shot Monday  Waited 5 minutes table 5 noon  bad  dim sum carts OK  choices OK  Pretty standard  Nothing stood would need come back for   The table 2 next stomped restaurant because only dish 20 minutes sat down  Apparently enough food choices restaurant didn't seem care    Will continue look decent dim sum place Vegas next time there  <EOR> So far Saturday lunch time    Excellent   Best Dim sum Las Vegas    almost all them  <EOR> Pretty good dim sum solid service! Although somewhat far strip 10 15 min drive restaurant corner somewhat newer plaza served delicious Cantonese brunch reasonable price   Highlights shrimp noodle not har gow although har gow also good very fresh oily great texture chinese broccoli egg tarts nice crispy bite size xiao long bao some soup   The waiters also took down orders quickly if didn't see wanted carts brought drinks quickly well  good alternative brunch strip if don't wanna throw down $$$  <EOR> Used come years when place Cathay House last week just noticed its under new management looks new name place remodeled     After getting seating seems feel back overflow room waited service  only 3 carts going around wait waive them down dim sum delivered your table  servers nice but attention service didn't come around check table    Food wasn't great remember service aight just used be  coming again need look new spot  <EOR> This place used Cathay restaurant then Jade restaurant while  just reopened new business Hongkong seafood restaurant past few weeks  They another branch Jones close 168    They complimentary soup during dinner time which nice especially cold winter night  ordered foie gras truffles Asian twist excellent  Creamy foie gras melts your mouth amazingly good  probably order again   Hubby wanted tried true seafood tofu hotpot salt pepper pork chop did disappoint   Service excellent which unusual real Chinese place  server checked several times refilled teapot without asking  also offered complimentary sweet red bean dessert meal    I'm docking star place itself old dated although tried hard renovate it  bathroom wasn't clean want trash almost full brim  Maybe because came late night almost closing time meal?  Overall food service excellent price reasonable  come back try dimsum next time  <EOR> Great dimsum selection attentive service! Even better dimsum places often Diamond Bar  Especially loved tofu ku chai dumplings fried fish  Even yang chow fried rice seemed freshly made not refried few times   <EOR> The place neat clean food all right  However waiter seem endlessly mess order come wrong dishes    takes forever wait dishes     Probably won't come back again  <EOR> Our hiking group comes Chinatown dim sum every year around Chinese New Year   yesterday because group Taiwan during New Year time   used come when Cathay House decided come back   The member group going Taiwan stopped week before reserved private room us   place renovated bit main part restaurant now all floor   Opposite entrance down few steps private room its large round table lazy Susan easy sharing   problem room though carts no way coming down steps room order want but can't see used carts wheeled around   few times women brought dish room see if wanted but most part Asian friend ordered us   We standard pork shumai steamed pork buns sesame balls rice noodle rolls   addition order Singapore noodles chow fun   Singapore noodles quite good good amount curry   food OK lunch   Service good but needed ask water which came nearing end meal   I restaurant almost filled   sure we'll back another time enjoy lunch  <EOR> Dim sum place open before 1030! Service fast food great very pleased  all essentials feels very authentic  new management floor servers assisting service well    I enjoyed shu Mai chicken feet rice rolls hot sesame balls <EOR> Have coming years when Cathy house   consider them best then now   all Dim Sum restaurants recently Las Vegas HK Garden best tasting dim sum   also love new reno job  warned sometimes difficult find parking parking lot during peak hours  <EOR> If you've other dim sum restaurants you're missing much here!  My family absolutely love dim sum when saw new place give shot  When walking could already tell ambiance change compared when Cathay house  Much cleaner however very compact when came seating   Whenever eat dim sum usually order Yang Chow fried rice actual menu accompany dim sum  nothing special fried rice very very greasy   The menu breaks down prices based size dish very confusing considering some items weren't even provided break down  Because dim sum pay per order usually calculate much getting know expect when bill comes  Due confusion pricing spent over budget   The actual dim sum itself wasn't satisfying hoped would be  ordered shumai steamed pork bun shrimp ball chicken feet  best item fact shrimp ball! definitely took back when use authentic dim sum downtown California    The water obviously tap taste bad order other refreshments accompany meal     Overall would never way come back because other establishments  enjoy Orchid Garden  staff very nice general but didn't compensate lack flavor dim sum  Don't wrong wouldn't mind coming if friend ever suggested but myself wouldn't trip  <EOR> Solid 4 star experience here  dim sum Sunday 11 45am  Two around 5 minute wait    Good food quick attentive staff  Parking seems issue since only lot  Some items much better others  I'd again  <EOR> The kitchen can't seem keep when busy  Tables joking another when waitresses kept saying coming meant coming summer  food able good though waitresses good  <EOR> Best salt pepper pork  Great waiters didn't hunt anyone down refills orders  Definitely repeat customer  <EOR> This second time first time 4 days ago party party room  food fantastic wanted try again    We ordered dish same other night   #99  Fish fillet baby mushrooms  fantastic!
