Absolutely love having Rosati's close by  staff always friendly food excellent  party few weeks ago completely filled second room made sure all guests happy  favorite lunch! <EOR> We getting takeout Rosati's Wigwam many years super excited when saw they'd moving walking distance house  Location 5 stars  Ambiance 4 stars  clean but bland  as yesterday liquor license full bar inside  Plenty seating  few well placed tvs watch game   Pizza 4 stars  thin crust but double crust  Note Rosati's if want crust breadier thin please give some seasoning  seems crazy but pizza hut actually really good seasoning crumbs outside theirs   Other food 4 stars  love cheesy bread frozen mushrooms pretty sure them in house   wings meh but husband likes them  haven't tried sandwiches pasta yet but appreciate varied menu  back soon check other offerings   Price 3 stars  pizza pretty high considering mostly regular ingredients unlike fancier cheese pepperonis down street Grimaldi's   Overall back  hands down best option walking distance right now  <EOR> We ordering pick Rosati's years  When moved Warm Springs Eastern now converted sit down restaurant thrilled  We evening enjoy good meal unfortunately case! When walked unsure whether wait seated could just seat ourselves no sign posted should do  stood front counter quite while  could see into kitchen where 3 guys standing talking each other totally ignoring us! Finally girl came back asked if helped  told wanted sit down eat she said just sit anywhere  sat down waited 15 minutes someone come give menus silverware ask if we'd beverage  decided wait 5 more minutes before we'd leave  5 minutes passed nobody ever approached table leave  reached front door 2 girls behind counter talking  walking girl said good night thank you!   said thanks what? never ate!   continued door turned take last look girl spoke she other girl laughing! Rosati's would better off firing your current employees going back being strictly take delivery restaurant! Do even think eating there! <EOR> The pizza great but service terrible  called order quoted 25 minutes pick up  arrived restaurant exactly 25 minutes ordering  paid told would ready 5 minutes  Understandable  Sunday night during football season extra 5 minutes no big deal  But almost 30 minutes later still no pizza  kept being told would 5 more minutes   the worst part no apologized no offered beverage while waited  just sat there  No seemed care  Pizza good but shouldn't take long  Especially Ben quoted 25 minutes  <EOR> I came twice day once pick catering order work second time dinner boyfriend  Both times received outstanding customer service! When came dinner server fantastic even made recommendation calzone delicious  <EOR>
