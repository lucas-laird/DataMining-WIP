Coffee lifeblood country  Wait right? sure   maybe something else  But last week me   COFFEE lifeblood little Vegas country  Especially 8 30am startings long meetings short breaks quick rushes bathroom stolen gelato moments   But yeah coffee  wouldn't made without it  Pinot Brasserie's little standalone coffee bakery stand being right around corner Venetian Conf Center lifesaver  Quick service yummy croissants  Lattes just okay but can't wrong cup dark roast some whole milk  Hits spot  <EOR>
