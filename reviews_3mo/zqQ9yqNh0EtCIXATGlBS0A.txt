Being only parties restaurant thought place new horrible   looked LTO Yelp find only review horrible that   waitress actually told they've open two months but still found odd basically no restaurant   Service bit spotty   rarely checked but workers friendly     LTO does potential it   food good but maybe because they're located back corner there's whole lack promotion   Until gets bit more crowded think time being should think having less staff duty   Its odd looking into open kitchen seeing wait staff chefs just standing there  <EOR>
