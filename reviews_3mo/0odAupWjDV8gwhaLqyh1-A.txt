Don't if your hungry because pay for!!! give half portions tell full portions  never chipotle where still hungry eating  Usually never finish because much  When first opened GM said may ask little more no extra cost  But now charging few extra pieces chicken  pay extra 3 pieces now right portion  <EOR> After waiting 25 minutes line watching over 10 people turn away final arrival counter see food lack only let down but disgusting  food run low meats empty dried bottom bins no salsa chips guacamole  instructed would need wait five minutes new freshly baked chips which actually took 20 minutes  total 40 minutes point still waiting manager speak us  Avoid location all costs if you're looking fresh meal competent service staff management  <EOR> I guess when work hang play tic tac toe manager watching winning laughing it  While doing ALL co workers hanging telling each other bout doing last night   All going while tables leftover trays crumbs all over them    Buyer beware location extremely tight portions!! <EOR>
