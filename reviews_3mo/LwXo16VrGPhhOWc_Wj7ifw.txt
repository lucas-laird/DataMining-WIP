Great first impression OM   Well done  <EOR> My favorite Las Vegas Mint last 4 years  tried many other popular Indian restaurants none them come closer Mint until last month  friend recommended location said food cooked front prices reasonable  bookmarked location Yelp finally day   Its located plaza 215 Eastern  area always busy many restaurants location parking might small issue  restaurant lavish many other Indian restaurants TV where some Indian music played but over all its atmosphere more  Roberto's  owners Nepalese food mainly north Indian some obvious Nepalese fusion it    I always two curries naan basmati rice location  far tried Chicken Tikka Masala Palak Panner Spinach w cottage cheese fav  Chilli Chicken Chicken Karai Garlic Naan  think restaurant most authentic Indian flavor any restaurant food cooked fresh front you    This prices also very low compared Taj Mint  its excellent place take meals  When first restaurant running promotion 20% off entire bill only month March  made deals even more special  also saw deliveries now    I highly recommend stop try sampler plates Thali which come 1 2 entrees 1 3 side dishes  also groupon amazon living social deals   Overall 5 5 <EOR> This Himalayan version Panda Express   pick place two three meats side   place spartan clean   watch Bollywood musicals TV    always plus   naan perfectly cooked   hard some places serve them   sauce various meats tasty   right kind spicy curry   meat however tough   sitting steamers long think   deconstructed samosa bit mess   doesn't taste samosa should be hearty soft potatoey goodness   sweet one   Maybe should call sweet vegetable potato plate instead   mango lassi averagely refreshing   Chai made way drink them   made hot milky full spice  <EOR> This place really good very fresh  don't over eat would regular Indian buffet  employees super friendly too  <EOR> Being Indian know good Indian food tastes place pretty darn good!  customer service great  would definitely come back again  <EOR> I say wow completely blew away  ordered chicken tikka naan today  chicken tikka best chicken tikka ever came bell peppers onions masala it  naan good  Everything fresh  right front while your waiting  would definitely recommend place friends  new favorite place eat Indian food  <EOR> Delicious food great prices!  I Thali 1 plate which includes 2 entrees side $6 99  chose chili chicken lamb vindaloo entrees naan side  spicy food entrees both considered medium hot which why picked them  dishes did little kick them more chili chicken but would preferred little more heat  But looking past flavors spot on! sauce lamb extremely flavorful great soaking naan  also little taste friends' plates chicken tikka masala chicken karahi I'd order them both future  said only gripe spiciness  Since aren't many dishes spicy wish could choose spiciness level many other Indian restaurants offer  Oh well!   As atmosphere place VERY casual  Just booths mostly blank walls occasional random wall hanging  clearly don't care decor but don't long continue serve quality food! <EOR> Great little place  Speedy food fresh taste Chicken Momo's aka dumpling really really tasty  Highly recommend place if looking fast yummy indian food  <EOR> I chance try place surprisingly offer MOMO's!
