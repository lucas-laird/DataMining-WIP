Came yesterday friends didn't even know opening night  restaurant located Circus Circus  Its real edgy rocker decor should  There's also lots cool pics wall other rockers cool display clothing back along art gallery rock roll themed art  Its noisy but its party atmosphere t v 's play motley crue videos    As far food drinks priced decently nothing expensive  drink ordered the groupie which made bubblegum flavored vodka  didn't care much because way sweet loaded syrup friend also complained drink being same way  food Bang Bang Shrimp  menu described shrimp dusted some kind seasoning spice bacon sliced carrots zucchini squash scoop jasmine rice  soggy vegetables barely any bacon 5 pieces shrimp rice wasn't jasmine swimming bath spicy creme sauce  wasn't expecting when read description dish  ate much could plus rice little undercooked  Next time come back won't again   Aside food all great time added bonus Vince Neil actually there! He came over table took pic friends big fans  super cool that  opening night still time place work kinks food department but other did eat drink party  <EOR> I'll start giving credit good food delivered fast  restaurant sports bar beer  No manager presence near restaurant nor floor  restaurant busy all waitress handling over 10 tables    PS all wanted eat drink party! Think twice before coming   Last thing look your receipt twice  <EOR> Giving two stars because food decent otherwise give star   No management around server friendly   hardly beer receipt wrong  told pay cash because system down but then changed mind  Never going back  <EOR> Let's start worst back corner location obscure crotchety Las Vegas hotel casino   Then throw worst margarita rocks could imagine first no margarita mix all sent back replaced tasted watered down lemonade   when waitress says just new triple sec no likes it! personally think Vince Neil's crappy tequila ball sweat he used brew it   It's hard talk bad food  safe but doesn't wow  simply served purpose being edible filling up    All all only thing more depressing lack atmosphere worst margarita history alcohol itself looks self deprivation each employees faces  honestly felt bad because knew knew working worst restaurant Las Vegas! Save yourself! place shouldn't open much longer hurry see yourself! <EOR> For fans Vince Neil's myself awesome   Vince Neil Motley Crue memrobilia all over   Plus Thursday's sing karaoke real rock band rock a roke! Very awesome   back  <EOR> This place only recently opened staff still getting feet  Came breakfast  Music atmosphere classic rock if you're fan then maybe but haven memorabilia era true fans  massive flaw place dead centre circus circus place would recommend anyone whether worth walk neighbouring places Encore Wynn Treasure Island Palazzo where good food already exists <EOR>
