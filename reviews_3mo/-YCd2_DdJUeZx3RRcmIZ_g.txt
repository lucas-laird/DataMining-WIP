I gotta admit love Taco Bell! Remember everyone loved Pizza Hut when kid? Well liked Pizza Hut but preferred Taco Bell  know weird right?  Back day used Taco Bell Grande which bigger version Taco Supreme  loved it! think Taco Bell because food simple tasty cheap  favorites Taco Supreme Chicken Supreme Chalupa Nachos Mango Frutista They oh addicting! I never dined but drive thru always fast friendly  screwed order few times but guess sort expect any fast food place  Now weather starting heat back often those Frutistas! <EOR> First all am much Taco Bell person  only things Doritos Taco Mexican Pizza   only reason would give them two stars   What came try Cantina Bowl  decided steak anticipating good  NOT! basically knockoff Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! steak itself flavorless pre cooked taste meaning all heat up  rice beans lettuce some kind chipotle sauce kind ironic since ghetto imitation   Immediately review am going contact Taco Bell tell them better quit making just stick making Doritos Taco  If take Doritos Taco away then just erase another star review   Service ok cleanliness place decent well    So if reading thinking getting Cantina Bowl unless want ruin your apetite! Chipotle night dinner just satisfy steak bowl craving! <EOR>
