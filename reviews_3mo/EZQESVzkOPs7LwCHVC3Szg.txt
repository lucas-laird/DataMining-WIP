It's new perhaps Mizumi working kinks   However price should worked those kinks before opening   My friend past Sunday   arrived without reservation but able order full menu bar   ordered tasting menu   explained bartender friend did eat beef but bartender assured would much food wouldn't even notice   point sure she considered much food but 6 tastings total inclusive dessert   Plus eaten L'Atelier Joel Robochon few evenings before recently familiarized several tastings looks shouldn't problem some adjustments menu due diner's dietary restrictions   The food       first tasting  which thought amuse bouche thrown greet  chilled oyster yuzu champagne vinaigrette   thought tasty but better oysters L'Atelier   second tasting various concoctions top 3 bruschetta like bread slices concoction beef tartare   enjoyed all but friend couldn't eat beef one   third tasting dry salmon soba noodles   never disrespected salmon way wouldn't expect pay such   noodles good flavor however   fourth tasting inedible bloody kobe beef dish top root vegetable puree maybe turnip parsnip overly sweet   Apart fact friend couldn't eat dish found inedible being poorly prepared   Part problem forgot already served salmon brought more salmon   Then took back prepare beef dish which obviously rushed barely cooked   Apart flavor good   last savory dishes sushi could buy better quality Kroger   sweaty fish top rice  dessert sorbet some sort   okay but entire meal overall disappointment   The drinks good however   despite bartender being off base courses being sufficient or them being good she nice personable   But wouldn't waste money food place   least tasting menu  <EOR> Amazing food great place take date too     http www visitwynn com documents Mizumi pdf <EOR> Loved!!!  We frequent Vegas   well   we frequent Encore Wynn typically eat Wazuzu sushi cravings   decided eat Mizumi night new since last visit    We sat front Sushi bar could take whole restaurant   gorgeous waterfall lighting decor   staff could nicer more attentive   sushi delicious   Also hurry overslept less hour without even having rush   super efficient   I would definitely recommend Mizumi definitely returning! <EOR> What beautiful restaurant!! Luv decor layout!! view waterfalls done superbly!! food very very good! Delishhhh!!!  A perfect place take someone special!! Servings good portion!  I enjoyed dinner girls!!! <EOR> I many Japanese restaurants but Japanese  I think restaurant serves best Japanese food in country far   We ordered nigiri rolls robata yaki on  Everything great  chawanmushi okay but  I would give them credit just having not so major dish  on menu   They own tea collection which $30 per pot   Since grew real Japanese tea Japan did find tea special $30 but only thing think something negative  Otherwise food service view decoration  restaurant all phenomenal  <EOR> Mizumi reincarnation Okada   If you're familiar Okada then Mizumi no surprise you   food items same before little differences save name decorations   The sashimi still fresh ever grilled items cooked perfectly     My favorites included lobster sashimi uni amaebi crab miso   If you're staying Wynn Encore don't want venture food good place eat at  <EOR> Food great fresh  Service incredibly slow  <EOR> The most amazing set ever see your life 100foot waterfall just enjoy while eat wow wow even if don't sushi just drink won't regret it <EOR>
