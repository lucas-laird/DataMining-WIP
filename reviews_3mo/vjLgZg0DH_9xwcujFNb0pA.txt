Formerly China Star Buffet just recently changed BJ's Buffet   Price $6 99 AYCE all day every day  Extra drinks Unfortunately worst Chinese buffets ever if worst   Horrible service ordered drinks front cashier when walked in  servers failed give drinks until reminded them maybe 15 minutes later  Also failed refill any drinks did pick ANY dirty plates  whole side table stacked full dirty plates wasn't until very last dessert plate did come pick them up   Food seriously tasted eating same thing every dish  aren't many choices   all also really really salty   Felt blood pressure rising every bite  Friend thought soups hit miss mostly miss     Everything decent just bad  The tastiest thing ice cream least good!   Environment least place clean pretty filled up! Being Chinese buffet weird see any Asians beside myself friend eating there  should caught first warning sign    Don't see myself coming back here  <EOR> I really really wanted place   However just couldn't bring myself give any higher 2 stars   First off customer service HORRID  walked expecting welcomed but instead almost exact opposite  cashier wasn't even when he did come he looked hassle even there  ordered drinks front took seats very back which nice couldn't help loving deco  just beautiful earned stars However bit misleading   actually want say extremely  pictures wall picture food even exist   excited when saw pictures but excitement quickly vanished when made way buffet line   Nothing pictures false advertisement ? Maybe    The cream cheese wontons no cream cheese them ones did dehydrated crummy   rest food overall bad ambiance beautiful  But definitely lacking service mention everything buffet labeled wrong  <EOR> Ok large 6 99 AYCE signs brought in  Judging reviews gonna hit miss  Since only 4 reviews far would say giving them try least do  pleasant surprise actually decent   First off drinks included price aware that  If refer pic tip think kids cheaper  Other food actually edible meaning your basic Chinese items  best way describe comparable Panda Express but more choices  good deal because Panda only 2 3 choices 10 bucks    What actually attention Mongolian Grill section  alone worth 6 99 price  Come put all veggies sauce want  Then give dude grills you  He ask if want pork beef chicken your veggies sauce  all 3  easily eat 2 full plates stuff im set   For dessert basics always see all other Chinese buffets  Things fruits jello cookies frozen yogurt   Service tolerable  came table food ate  servers basically just sure your drinks take any excess plates  No complaints here   So 6 99 all day everyday bad deal all! Just don't expect gourmet top line food   Right now eat free your birthday special proof I D  Give guys try thought ok  <EOR> COCKROACH dont bad experience never again Bj asian buffet <EOR> Okay many reviews any idea expect  did however  set expectations low since only 6 99  HORRIBLE would better off Panda Express  rice hard meat questionable keeping pans full food happening  paid before seat say ourselves  worker just sitting couch playing phone   Just somewhere else people  really worth  even $6 99  Also couldn't even find clean spoon use eat soft serve ice cream  somewhere else folks  <EOR>
