We order delivery love it   Usually when order Chinese delivery food mediocre but food pretty good   only prices more reasonable food comes hot fried options come crispy   don't skimp serving size always order small options   Although sweet sour chicken pork stereotypical radioactive red sauce over battered meat still good   doesn't kind crap once awhile?  As other menu items everything good go   husband digs egg foo yong lot love beef broccoli   ordered six dishes 30 bucks don't delivery charge tip generously   Great service great food lazy night   can't say fan because something order every week but decent chinese food west side  <EOR>
