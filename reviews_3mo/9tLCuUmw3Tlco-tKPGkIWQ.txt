We ordered to go   Chicken Katsu plate+ $1 add veggies Katsu little overcooked inside bit dry crispy hard crisp when sat long fryer  Veggie mix consist cabbage carrot zucchinis broccoli seem fresh since none overcooked still bit crunch    Chicken teriyaki plate chicken juicy  couldn't quite place why sauce tasted familiar but came later today tasted just Yoshida sauce buy Costco    Plate portions hearty also come choice mac salad which decent side salad typical iceburg mix poppy honey mustard vinegrette BF shared leftovers   Not bad quick meal but think stick grilled meats instead katsu  <EOR> The food good but nothing fantastic  prices reasonable portions fair pay  fried rice yaki soba pretty good  would avoid appetizer items because saturated oil greasy eat  Its worth try  <EOR> I'm huge fan teriyaki being mad thought Teriyaki Madness would float boat more did  four times since opened location am genuinely impressed  Why back three times since initial visit wonder? GOOD COUPONS    I haven't cared read other people think regarding Teriyaki Madness' prices  But take place cheap  seems everything additional dollar add making rice white brown chicken white brown simply adding vegetables  When am already paying 8 9 bucks tray food blame being hesitant add anything already expensive meal??  I complain prices all want but fact food itself mediocre  chicken katsu often dry teriyaki sauce tastes many BOTTLED teriyaki sauces someone else said teriyaki tasted Yoshida's CANNOT agree more!!   easily leave Teriyaki Madness paying 11 bucks single meal still somewhat hungry plate empty  Did mention macaroni salad NO flavor whatsoever??!! didn't think anything mayonnaise could bland!  The service just food mediocre  more say? Every single face works inside Teriyaki Madness says cannot wait off work   Maybe normal maybe problem  decide   Now coupons expired or used honest little reason ever Teriyaki Madness again  absolutely NOTHING would entice come back Teriyaki Madness     even if down street living quarters    Teriyaki Madness       Doing teriyaki disservice since 2003 <EOR>
