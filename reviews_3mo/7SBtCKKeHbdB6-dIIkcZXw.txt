Love unique different twists Hawaiian Filipino food desserts Truck Norris Fluff Ice both Los Angeles area   Sin City Cupcakes   alcohol infused cupcakes   need say more??? follow separate Yelp reviews them   Ive learned attending past foodie festivals take cash since some vendors food trucks take debit credit cards   bring cash you!   The admission price initially might scare people away but note good both days privileges  Kids free if certain height! so tell taller kids bend knees lil bit you're under 48 limit   haha   pick $2 coupon off McDonald's sponsors event PLUS part proceeds good cause local Ronald McDonald House  found all info website before came   good value if take advantage attending weekend  enjoyed afternoon back  <EOR> The family today seeing advertisements   fiance really excited agreed hoping would nice break norm great way spend early Saturday Evening   We arrived right 4pm bought tickets 2 adults 2 kids no kids discount $52 60 entered festival   immediately grabbed hard sell timeshare company took more effort planned spending break away   The festival relatively empty granted early day few open booths   major disappointment found no Japanese food which hoping for   Vietnamese Filipino Thai all well represented well couple Hawaiian fusions but it   The food trucks definitely highlight   both chose Truck Norris kicked ass see separate review    day progressed crowd only mildly picked but entertainment slightly elevated   All told left 7 30pm roughly $220 expenditure   I believe event priced high side but enjoyable   second annual hopefully gain momentum years come   definitely give them shot next year well   Note Bring Cash!  ATM fee $4 50 no takes credit! <EOR> We around 1pm first day started  ticket lines died down security guard said  Thankfully won free tickets Yelp! Thanks again Misti Y  Yelp guys rock!!!! tickets headed straight festival  We're pretty used size San Gennaro little under whelmed  no lines anywhere thankfully  tried some Filipino food fluff ice which delish! food trucks awesome lots choose from  daughter both cupcake Sin City cupcakes mini without alcohol then headed carnival    You could tell RIGHT AWAY jacked ticket prices festival  paper towel over cheaper prices sun if count 2    my 3yo good time pockets didn't!   All all good time  biggest complaint prices carnival but if just hubby would little complain about! think during down time which nice! <EOR> Hmm high hopes festival however left feeling disappointed   There just much anything festival warrant $10 + let cost  keep mind foodie feat $8 addition most festivals Spring Mountain free  if going charge Asian festival expectations going high  There no merch booth section ridiculously small worth time look all  would assume since Asian festival would Asian type stuff buy but most booths consultation type ones births trying buy service timeshare  guess  kinda Asian lol    There no cultural booths educate anyone celebrating just quick tid bits cultural dancing followed major dose hip hop    The food booths comprised many local Vegas restaurants food trucks  Many f food booths mostly Thai satay booth were downright disgusting nearly all them skewered food sitting God knows long waiting some sucker buy them   steered far away those  top many food booths charged arm leg food  know expected  event but when $2 00 more restaurant menu price combined smaller portion craptastic experience   In addition why McDonald's there? only thing Asian McDonald's all used work there?   One big minus lack SnowOno shave ice  shaved ice booth location Bleh! could done better job snoopy shave ice maker home!  The only saving grace food brought few town trucks fluffy ice   We spent $60+ still left hungry    There abundance rental carnival rides carnival related food booths  Why? Just another way try more money   My honest opinion save your money foodie fest instead  If feeling Asian inspired then your kicks many festivals held Spring Mountain during year  <EOR> I am big fan festivals also happened lucky enough win pair VIP tickets via Yelp Thanks again Misti! decided check Asian Food Festival  Upon approaching SIlverton saw tons rides booths set ready fun eat lot!   Upon walking into festival food para para paradise! saw many familiar food vendors well some new ones eager eat lot! main meal decided try some Filipino food since craving while now   food tasty reminded best friend's food back home California  Having VIP tickets also huge bonus fair  could say no comp drinks?!
