We ordered delivery service them last night   family meals   generally order couple things then share between pretty cool already format better price tag   thought very affordable portions good   food good exceptionally fantastic but still really yummy   wasn't fan fried rice probably wouldn't order again   The delivery time though fantastic 20 minutes less told would be   would definitely order again   = <EOR> Really yummy good prices fast service  fav dish eggplant tofu good spicy factor excellent sauce  noodles aren't greasy soft  Delish! <EOR> The rating more 3 5 but option isn't available yet  Haha  Anyway just stopped Mongolian beef fix must say some best flavor portion wise   order Mongolian beef pork fried rice which totaled $14+  Maybe just but seems kinda steep take out 1   service quick tonight but heard sometimes pretty busy call ahead   Everything flavorful tasted good but only gripe fact whole container bbq pork fried rice fat pieces meat Next time steer clear politely ask them again  <EOR>
