I love place much   far best all you can eat sushi found   Everytime am Vegas sure hit place least once   always very fresh fish since full menu made order all you can eat happy ordering nicer stuff worry breaking wallet  <EOR> This place dirt cheap daily lunch special $4 95   day CA roll tempura   Other days combinations chicken teriyaki   Miso soup salad included   portions huge   Granted group lighter eaters mostly senior citizens except but everyone seemed half rolls few pieces tempura leftover   must 12 pieces CA roll per order   tasted ok just average   tempura way overdone thick batter just looking its oiliness made queasy   ah yes also greasy tempura smell when entering restaurant   Good deal wallet but palate  <EOR>
