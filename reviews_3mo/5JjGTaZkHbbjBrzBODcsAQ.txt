Tamara Rick C <EOR> *This visit just THREE days Tony T 's Michael K 's 5 star experience      Before meeting gang some Bingo action South Point decided sushi hearing good nigiri kick ass appetizers head sushi chef Blue Ribbon inside Cosmopolitan  Already high expectations appetite destruction sit bar all in AYCE   We start off both salmon tuna poke  salmon good but texture tuna kinda suspect   gave them benefit doubt ordered some nigiri Uni Blue Crab Fatty Albacore Amaebi  The Amaebi good   too small says sushi chef      OH    KAY??? The tuna good he says   so put trust dig in  Uni good Blue Crab sweet but tuna lacks its glistening fresh appearance again hesitant trying Fatty Albacore which looks butchered barely cold almost body temperature   I chase bad feeling Iced Green Tea then ask where tuna from   his answer?  Hawaii   after tasting mediocre tuna knew fact did come 808 State knock off sushi chef playing chump! much rather smaller Amaebi but then again knows fresh was!?  Little did he know he messin' Goyemonstah        Little did he know Goyemonstah born raised Hawaii worked fishmarket some best tuna own waters     and VERY little did he know Goyemonstah wanted reach over display case and     Never mind!  We ditched nigiri section ordered off appetizer section Miso Black Cod Hamachi Kama few Yakitori Bacon Wrapped Quail Eggs Bacon Wrapped Asparagus Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms  expected Yakitori items grilled fish items arrive separate plates but pupu platter complete orange slices delivered former Blue Ribbon sushi chef himself everything same plate! flavors Miso Black Cod the Ha Ka Half Hamachi Kama confused war chant New Zealand All Blacks perform before prepare kill opposing team all blended Yakitori which big fail presentation  probably tested other half Hamachi Kama freshness? ordered some scallop salmon saba nigiri still just okay cure saba barely evident   I order Shark's Tale Wild Fire What's Wrong? Roll  Shark's Tale mentions tempura snow crab   it tempura imitation krab  Wild Fire Roll okay What's Wrong roll swimming sauce alright  think Yuzu Sherbet Green Tea Ice Cream sadly highlights here  No half rolls allowed until your last order only dessert per person FYI      Shady quality fish lack presentation witnessing lots shortcuts they don't tamago soft shell crab fried chopped prepared way advance YUCK! does warrant return visit here    ALOHA!!! <EOR> Had ayce lunch $19 95ea two Sunday noon pleasantly surprised   restaurant didn't very many patrons time came maybe five six other tables aside service super fast   food being delivered almost faster eat them old plates being taken away just quick beverages never less half full   facility also sparkly clean expect brand new spot   We able sample majority nigiri found them very good overall   fish fresh good rice fish ratio   seem nigiri bit smaller average which appreciate since gives opportunity sample other items menu full quickly   also feel better taste food if you're mouth less stuffed per bite   We also sampled good number yakitori totally loved each one   probably sets them apart other ayce joints   Sure find yakitori elsewhere but bacon wrapped yakitori items exceptional most flavorful recent memory   also both salmon yellowtail poke thought good though nothing compared poke poke express   While plenty ayce sushi places valley only handful really worth going back again again   back again sure evaluate consistency but Daisho sushi looks keeper me   would rank place same class category Yama Goyemon overall food flavor dining satisfaction   best part Daisho slightly cheaper lunch only $19 95 dinner $24 95 where competition charges 1 2 bucks more  <EOR> I love !  I saw daisho couple weeks ago very intrigued   neighboring buildings did complement compel eat sushi  Until day Friday rather hungry found myself driving ever caught eye  saw daisho regular rolls 50% off love sushi especially 50% cheaper first viewing daisho exterior did find very appealing   However when walked presently surprised  interior pretty people incredibly nice     I am writing review 2 times visited daisho both times met expectations exceeded it    The first time 4 regular rolls $10 because BOGO free  okay but because used special rolls haven't regular roll ages    The second time AYCE OMG choice appetizers ahhmaaazinng  SERIOUSLY your gonna give salmon Kama? also skewers love bacon wrapped enoki mushroom however did cook liking   disappointed cause really looking forward it  scared eating raw pork because biology class   However everything else really good ! thought food 8 scale 1 10   But thing definitely service   jenny Michael  Jenny server she sweet helpful  She unfortunately only server night due some mishaps she informed  but she still rushed serve smile face     So if want good AYCE sushi excellent service  cheaper other places daisho ! <EOR> The location great! story behind chef inspiring glad support local business owner   We dinner tonight service incredible staff very friendly   The food good  Daisho Fried Rice big hit table highly recommend it  portion size enough three share along other entrees  going NA k try some sushi rolls next time around  <EOR> We group Yelpers  Honestly having second thoughts place since reviews seem inconsistent but Tony T's guidance seem picked right stuff menu  few hiccups can't give place shining 5 stars   I tried miso black cod bacon wrapped enoki bacon wrapped quail eggs bacon wrapped asparagus yakitori beef salmon poke tuna poke oysters salmon skin handroll uni unagi salmon garlic tuna amaebi salmon collar hamachi collar Wild Fire spicy tuna cracker Starfish fried bananas red bean ice cream yuzu ice cream   5 5 I love bacon obviously clear winners bacon wrapped quail eggs asparagus enoki mushrooms  Also 5 star worthy items oysters salmon nigiri super good!

Wow   never come back again only being treated way when am trying polite just talk manager but also fact she won't let talk manager third accidentally finding type place where if need owner's manager's help correcting verifying transaction sort response would get   side note food ok better but since literally across street would every few days     anymore  <EOR> Definitely solid 4 stars Daisho Sushi!!!

Food barely adequate  prepared properly Japanese all presentation food poorly presented   really shocked because reading review raving celebrate BD place instead felt more compromised    Worst part place empty 40 minutes service poor then packed many groups came shy asian boy obnoxiously loud demanding diner boy keep pushing service food bill     I shocked!  DAISHO japanese means big victory soaring large   place needs change its name something else      GK says OK year older depressed   check place out   come again give second chance  all first time         Fried Shrimp Heads come    <EOR> Get Starfish Roll  Wild Fire Shrimp crab tempura Blue crab nigiri Salmon nigiri Fatty albacore nigiri Yellowtail salmon  collar  Sweet heart  Stay away Uni bitter tasting definitely creamy fresh ocean y nutty taste should be  Garlic tuna nigri didn't really much flavor surprisingly    Unfortunately menu bit confusing   marked permanent marker new selections now Dinner only   came around 3 50 pm lunch seated told still time lunch     Then server left waters   time he came back ready order he told sorry now dinner pay dinner price =T   'okay' because wanted eventually try dinner menu few things enjoyed during lunch ayce found now dinnner only        Most service pretty fast think some reason though sweet heart roll took longer ? but pretty good  <EOR> AYCE Lunch worth it  know alot AYCE sushi places rules but rules want come back  them being can't order half rolls until as waitress said the end when you're full full rolls     umm    what?? <EOR> I came take can't really comment service any other menu items   however comment sushi   prices great time review running 50% off all sushi  pay certainly felt first visit which case whole lot   sushi rice properly cooked mushy outside crunchy inside   rolls thin rolled tight lacked any usual cucumber avocado toppings sauces   tempura definitely made order hence crunchy but rather stale California roll nothing but imitation crab again no cucumber etc    rather excited see place conveniently located way home work  Sadly return  <EOR> First time Daisho sushi  love place   Good food good Price    I buck !!! <EOR> i say Worth try                    nice restaurant ! During trip vegas looking good sushi restaurant which didn't cost small fortune  exactly restaurant is  space tiny lucky wait just few minutes  ordered sushi sashimi combination which great but don't miss yellow tail  something remembered !I eaten number sushi joints time must say sushi best but good quality price even better! am crazy size decor place  skeptical first but friend both into virgins  amazed quality sushi  <EOR> Amazing friendly !!our service always top notch  used dine Sushi Mon every time until first time came haven't looked back since!! spot try!! Don't let last 3 terrible businesses located change your mind!! place remodeled completely cleaned up!! Fresh fresh fresh else want sushi bar!! <EOR> So decided Daisho last sushi spot before cut back AYCE sushi meals awhile D' abused whole all eat sushi privilege since moved Las Vegas year ago finally catch me  Le sigh   Anyway decided Daisho since new buzzing spot Yelp see all 5 stars about  Decor To start off decor mediocre  Nothing special but time improve later future doesn't really affect overall experience  plates provide regular large circular ones would normally find any other restaurant isn't serving sushi  Merh guess just more used traditional small rectangular plates  Nigiri I see why majority ratings 5 stars  fish freshest tasted awhile AYCE options  feel since sushi restaurants give option eating much possibly mere $25 serve high quality products  But must say hotate scallop delicious uni best tasted Vegas thus far  never much uni piled piece nigiri  actually really shocked amount given  However only nigiri where felt spoiled  Although fish serve all fresh slices really thin  HA!  WHERE YOU! knew good true guess really can't your cake eat oh world  Rolls Moving rolls those don't care much raw fish  rolls surprisingly biggest reason I'd come back again again  NEVER SAY THAT! good news offer half order rolls bad news wait till your 2nd 3rd round till allow privilege  love 'no rice' rolls  Basically everything would typically roll except instead being wrapped seaweed wrapped cucumber course no rice  time actually enjoy roll put restriction say only per person All other rolls welcome order much like  huge variety rolls if you're roll lover you've hit jackpot  thing must note if your go to roll spider roll    order 'Godzilla Roll'  version Spider Roll incorporates lettuce why??   Godzilla roll usual Spider Roll you'd find any other sushi restaurant  Appetizers other items Something really enjoyed Daisho really sets apart other sushi places selection appetizers  Quail egg wrapped bacon asparagus wrapped bacon mushrooms wrapped bacon! wasn't very fond fresh oysters since warm when table  many other items though   All around bad bad all! definitely taking out of town friends more into rolls nigiri here  <EOR> We came lunch first time experience   room nice chairs comfortable   I special roll combo  The rolls selected pretty tasty size rolls perfect large loaded rice  special came salad miso soup  salad salad all  ramekin shredded cabbage small drizzle dressing  found miso soup weak   My wife salmon tempura combo  salmon tempura tasty but came similar salad combo  both ordered hot tea  tea weak wondered if bag reused surprised find $2 charge receipt    The overall value fair received  certainly no home run hit left smelling deep fryer oil  If another sushi spot stick it  <EOR> Have visited two times really enjoy everything!  The location great busy   The food always tastes great The prices decent right now grand opening  The staff always great but think should talk guests more  comparison other sushi places if worked they'd 5 star! <EOR> Been waiting close sushi spot does trick  Great prices friendly staff  only complaint Ive 3 times ordered fried calamari but dont it  sure whats that  definitely back keep bugging them it  <EOR> Another great experience! service much quicker time all sushi rolls came together much sooner last time  new favorite yum yum scallop crunch roll husband's lobster roll  Cajun albacore much more balanced garlic albacore  eel spicy tuna spicy tuna crunch rolls also delicious! Yea didn't realize ordered two similar rolls until food 3 but still tasty  seemed pretty busy tonight glad seem doing well  Love place! <EOR> Keep forgetting write review place!!  Anyways all say place top notch Japanese appetizers!! really glad part all you can eat menu  fish used nigiri actually fresh   especially tuna   looked funny  size nigiri also quite small compared other places around valley but didn't really bother since take small bites anyways  Service excellent  only problem when ordered salmon collar  actually undercooked but immediately replaced new good service part  probably wouldn't come back all you can eat but definitely place take non sushi lovers + sushi lovers since larger variety non fish appetizers   Appetizers Miso black cod Salmon collar Yellowtail collar Yakitori Fresh oysters <EOR> I love place! down to Earth fancy food good    all combined means cheaply priced delicious sushi! originally came because Groupon    still Groupon because waitress kind enough point Groupon doesn't expire until January 1 2 priced regular rolls Grand Opening special  am fan simpler sushi rolls anyway finding gold mine going back ever since  sushi already reasonably priced without 1 2 off compared rest Vegas means Grand Opening special which still going 11 16 13 resulted $2 3 regular rolls    The rolls pretty standard ingredients fresh  Considering fixed income sushi addict couldn't ask more sushi place! <EOR> This best meal Vegas  Godzilla roll! Only caveat if all eat charged anything isn't eaten  Luckily finished cheap roll wasn't bad  Just keep mind start expensive rolls work towards cheaper rolls nigiri  salmon collar also delicious! <EOR> Great Time Great Food Great Service  write reviews but guys  all eat dissapointed  Everything spot Chef behind bar asked girl if x x x which he then created something those items  Bacon Wrapped Mushrooms Quail Eggs sure  Iced Tea never below Half  even though getting close closing time never mentioned made feel rushed leave  Very good experience  <EOR> Love place!
