The Mongolian Beef okay   tepid okay  might order again but probably not  expecting savory spicy but tasted more sweet notes anything  Once accepted sweet ride realized really heavy onions bell peppers  onions especially customary green onions but would preferred if refrained drowning beef bell peppers  just because right color doesn't mean welcomed flavor profile  shrimp order also fairly light protein   Overall place  convenience sake back fairly often  Yay Chinese food! <EOR> The food delicious  Sauces awesome pork chow mein the mixed vegetables pork real deal  gonna new chinese delivery place  <EOR> Love place!
