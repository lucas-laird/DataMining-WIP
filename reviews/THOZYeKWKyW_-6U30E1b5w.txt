Dissappointing  took over hour house  food old stale cold border line disgusting  fries worst part  am certain re frying old fries day possibly even week before  used live over Sunrise LOVED Angelina's side town  never oder restaurant again  wish restaurants would realize just because open doesn't mean anybody wants your food once word spreads your product terrible no pride putting front very people depend living only matter time before your customers start going somewhere else  guess back Pizza Hut me  <EOR> Seriously LOVE Angelinas!! place always provided great customer service even better food!!   From burgers pizza calamari  delicious!!! portions way more enough!   Would definitely recommend friend! <EOR> The only reason gave two stars pizza good  place really doesn't together  Delivery takes FOREVER time argued hadn't paid card when clearly showed eat 24  Also could hear girl phone being nasty she could delivery driver    He's doing job maybe should yours  <EOR>
