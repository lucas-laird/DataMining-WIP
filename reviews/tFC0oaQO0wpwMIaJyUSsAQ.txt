No more bread hogging everytime LA! interior definitely different SoCal stores  much more modern organized  Even uniforms cuter! don't wide selection pastries nor sell loaf bread but am pleased least something town  need bring blueberry yogurt cake milk loaf breads!!  friend came during grand opening said everything kind salty ? but enjoyed all pastries!  Service honestly frustrating  charged random drink when confronted them girl upselling dragging she void entire ticket then re do purchase so  do want take drink? understand pain through process but choice if guys made mistake  just ended taking throwing because she seemed she better things but wasted $8   <EOR> Had grilled chicken caprese sandwich bread soft  really yummy want try some pastries desserts LOT variety  Customer service could use boost but food yummy affordable  <EOR> I say mixed feelings small French style coffee shop  First off coffee excellent  fresh brewed quality coffee beans  also grilled cheese sandwich  must say started well  variety artisan cheeses very large  But unfortunately entire middle cold  heated toasted long enough  said I'd say experience 50 50  Maybe if tried place next time would cook food appropriate temperature  But coffee definitely worth it  <EOR> This place amazing! very delicious Asian style breads! Especially Vegas great place quick breakfast light brunch! service also good! <EOR> Amazing pastry coffee  croissant donut iced coffee  Both very delicious  downside charge $4 water    If you're feeling hungry dessert some sweets stop in! <EOR> A large variety sandwiches coffee drinks beautiful pastries  coffee latte incredible crunch choux delicious  favorite morning cafe visits  Vegas  service great helpful  <EOR> Great place grab late breakfast lunch Grand Canal Shops  offer great looking sandwiches terrific selection pastries! tried Hawaiian Sausage Bread which delicious Pain Au Chocolat which also good  also tried Lavender Macaron ok  fresh orange juice great comes adorable glass bottle  service nice quick really enjoyed upstairs place eat view Grand Canal Shops street performers below  Thanks tip Samantha D  read review place before visiting very insightful  Love spot come again next time Vegas  <EOR> Wow place HARD find  saw those little billboards place but didn't say where go  going all over place except was  finally found but getting ready close  NO!  I wanted iced coffee he said pre made fine that  ended also getting Cappuccino Royal Pudding   I actually liked coffee lot  nutty hint mocha  Very good! Royal Pudding good but bit hard eat   Will definitely back if area  Wished came before other places coffee! <EOR> Staying Palazzo overcrowded event Paris Baguette place smaller lines food go  poke bowls ok but absolutely true poke  But they're cheap fill up  Also tried sandwich another day which just Ok  Service disaster  <EOR> Had first breakfast Vegas here  told buddy quality bakery sweets  Being fan both mentioned things told myself must try this  disappointed all! self serve style bakeries similar Chinese bakery restaurants where grab platter serve yourself clamps  tried chocolate croissant well ham cheese croissant  loved both them  ham cheese blended very well croissant felt eating delicious buttery grilled cheese ham    I also vanilla pudding  came cute little bottle  sweet creamy but opinion little soft  texture closer yogurt then pudding  taste great nonetheless   Lastly tried iced house coffee  Great coffee taste but super sweet  but would recommend people dislikes sweet iced coffee ones McDonalds  <EOR> The first breakfast place Las Vegas which located Venetian   probably cheaper places sure which big bonus since most places resorts above $10 breakfast while place probably spend less still decent meal   I found breakfast sandwich decent came scrambled eggs ham brie cheddar cheese  Nothing special outstanding  nice gave tray then select which items want grabbing them want line moves along counter  They'll also toast sandwiches other food you'd want toasted  <EOR> There presentation wonderful  lured free sample almond pastry very delicious  Very light taste overpowering almond flavor which caused buy 2  offer coffee other pastries but honestly coffee didn't look good but coffee drinker guess opinion probably doesn't matter much  Overall love it  <EOR> Awwwww man place awesome   tried number savory sweet pastries all great   almond croissant nice crunch buttery flakiness off chains   great view sure grab seat upstairs overlooking market square     Great selection pastries decent prices Vegas   definitely stop back next time staying Palazzo Venetian  <EOR> Paris Baguettes common NYC but some odd reasons or maybe just personal bias did expect see Las Vegas  surprised find Venetian casino why Paris casino?   even doubted same Paris Baguette chain much just confirm myself  entered store disbelief but all changed when spotted red bean bread  Okay totally screamed Paris Baguette   The bread selection much smaller stores NY but some pizza esque ciabatta never seen NY store before  also salad station well   I hard time deciding ended getting crab croquette which only 2 75 price commonly see Strip  very content economical lunch would until ordered coffee pair croquette  small cup hot coffee $3 more croquette!  While understand store inside Venetian rent must through roof but just doesn't sense charge more regular cup coffee requires no barista skills prepare should cost more food itself  Had reversed prices say 3 bucks croquette 2 75 coffee would feel much more rational   In any case would given 5 stars if weren't pricey coffee   Pros economical snack lunch if skip coffee square where performances entertained while eat   Cons coffee pricey <EOR> This place truly delicious recommend other coworkers but man ALWAYS running product Poké bowls   started review months ago when stopped lunch much Poké bowl product   bad took photos empty containers but deleted them when decided pursue review  excuse busy earlier     Many visits later they're still running product! good day when come everything available  keep returning because honestly bowls amazing!  many coworkers hooked them nice change cafeteria food eat 5 days week want treat ourselves but just wish product fully available     Also service very slow but believe they're low employees because seen We're Hiring signs quite often  <EOR> This place great!!

Same cakes  chiffon cake light airy very good size split among 2+ people    I'd also point staff patient polite  2 customers before both demanding rude  However cashier patient polite carried customers' requests including repackaging desserts individual boxes bags providing cake cutter candles when only single slice cake purchased payment  <EOR> As any nosey K drama fan would add Paris Baguette list musts since logo name pops prominently many sponsored end credits  over 1800+ locations probably every other block Seoul Nevada's first PB located inside Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes    The mini chocolate croissant Cocossant nice flaky only $1 50  tempted raspberry cronut but other dessert stops itinerary decline   To expected regular sized pastries desserts pricey side few take home souvenir treats attractively packed purchase   They also similar pastries found home macarons sausage bread mushipan cream cakes etc    If staying Venetian somewhere close would've returned try quick bites sandwiches ice cream popsicles iced coffee etc stopped upstairs relaxing break people watch above  <EOR> Expensive   It could just Vegas tax but everything saw more expensive Paris Baguette near house  flavors alright though  Definitely less sweet San Diego but kind par Arcadia  <EOR> Really disappointing service  quick bite  place called Paris Baguette but when ordered sandwich employee said baguettes  offered dressing sandwich then said out    We sat down eat five minutes four people sandwiches baguettes  Employee really rude helpful  <EOR> I wanted try place because saw croissant donuts   When came only two left lemon creme croissant donuts bought $5 Curry Croquette $3   lot yummy looking pastries but figured might stop another day   pastries bought good but did think croissant donut would much better  <EOR> This  favorite place Las Vegas poke bowls  fish fresh all veggies seasoned perfect! regular because never finish large  Service always great price good  always offer free crab salad! could eat everyday  <EOR> Went several times while Vegas coffee breakfast  Great hot sandwiches coffee reasonable price  Check yelp free coffee! <EOR> YAY!  proper croissant   May two please? chocolate croissant well    oohh yeah need    need? yeah need those eclairs bretons  Shoot no fridge room guess start eclairs when back    I came twice hour   Once sandwich some latte then wandering Venetian straight back rest pastries listed above   much loved getting steps while Vegas day 4 legs killing me   No way going next day Bellagio   only regret Bellagio didn't similar location would every day   nice respite since miss Paris much   Hoping some decents croissants baguettes next time real thing  <EOR> Paris baguette inside Venetian   bound happen!! happy cronuts here! just wish didn't cost arm leg but Vegas what're gonna do   cronut?!
