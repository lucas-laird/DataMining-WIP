Won't coming back again  <EOR> The food court probably best food quantity cost ratios Vegas  tofu beef soup ordered Soon Tofu stand came pickled daikon mayo based cucumber pieces fishcake kim chee rice whole fried fish  All just $7 99 great deal stuffed until ready explode   The cool thing food court multiple similar stands selling tofu soup noodles rice dishes numerous other korean specialties  prices all comparable since appears all appear compete same demographic   Tip water complimentary tea located side communal between various stands  <EOR> It's rare find Korean market Vegas heard decided look around  typical Korean market    it fun look around but all same since live around lot Korean markets  just interesting find Vegas    We dinner dumplings Korean soondae corn fried beef lot Korean snacks    It fun little adventure driving over looking around  back! <EOR> Greenland closely resembles LA's Korean markets except its selection much smaller  sells pretty much all brands items normally purchase but nothing beyond that  ready to go side dishes kim bab rice rolled seaweed fresh oxtail Greenland brand dumplings in frozen section    bummed today because early didn't kimbab   usually come 1 2x month because long way Henderson usually stock galbi shabu shabu beef black pig pork belly    I would given place 4 stars but customer service stunk  bag own groceries when plenty employees around  don't mind bagging groceries but irked everyone acted good bag groceries didn't help another cashier out    Lastly food court bit overpriced hesistant eat unless really desperate Korean food  glad actually Korean market around but wish closer could kimbab fix  <EOR> this place really good! There's wide variety food court portions pretty big  If can't decide try grilled mackerel spicy noodles note its cold! <EOR> Korean markets almost always cleaner more organized Chinese Viet counterparts though tradeoff almost always more expensive  Depending looking may choice  example Greenland probably only market Valley sells uni seasonal   tray $7 99 bad but any other choices town   They've also several types marinated kbbq meats ready grill which haven't seen anywhere else either  seafood section cleanest but no live fish crab lobster tanks  Produce section mostly Korean specific stuff even real Korean pears actually Korea but again pricey   If you're into Korean noodles huge section front store though brands sold everywhere else such Nongshim priced $1 50 more per pack  Nongshim Black priced $6 99 SF down street $5 49   Another huge selection expecting pickled daikon radish takuan   looking some other markets town all only 3 5 brands every single artificial color Yellow #5 aspertame and or MSG  Greenland found few brands none above offenders only limited natural ingredients  If daikons artificial coloring perhaps pickled correctly since traditional pickling process turns radish yellow   Too bad prices high otherwise I'd come shop more  reason only shop if something can't find elsewhere  <EOR> First time today family   Great prices produce quality may quite high Whole Foods but eh fantastic selection Korean not Korean foodstuffs including but limited to Hello Kitty marshmallows kimchi pork belly seafood moves grooves sauces oils satisfy almost any need craving   place very clean which appreciate very much!    We eaten lunch KoMex before trip Greenland otherwise would checked food court   Next time       I know coming lot   fact few ideas stocking stuffers snack candy aisle! <EOR> Love korean japanese food? place it! fresh uni tako yaki jajangmyun bulgogi they've huge assortment goodies choose from! meat selection favorite last time bought $50 worth galbi bulgogi thinly sliced beef tongue duck breast ground meats pork belly beef slices sukiyaki    plus army sauces [gochujang bean paste fish sauce ponzu salad dressings etc] all sizes could possibly need  huge bags mineral salts well supplied produce section large refrigerated section rows noodles natto huge frozen area meats dumplings etc  haven't tried food court yet but might next time because photos look yummy! open mini store areas near front mostly unoccupied but hoping they'll fill soon because lot potential  pretty far side town but worth making trek stock awesome foods hard find  haven't seen skate fresh uni anywhere else marinated bulgogi delicious! If spend over certain amount offer bag rice $ 99  going back next payday! } <EOR> This 2nd time visiting Korean market  selections carry esp  Japanese products which hard find  I usally stock Marukai Nijiya Cali  Today shopping experience pleasant one  walked through every aisle noticed tall Asian guy white jacket following me  He wasn't pushing cart nor he carrying basket  demeanor quite strange  He totally gave himself away he shop  20 minutes store decided leave  When walked cashier pay groceries saw man white jacket turn around talk employees    #smh <EOR> My favorite asian market  everything imagine inside store just korean but really other asian culture food products  am Hawaii seeing basically aisle all local comfort snacks foods through store  store most diversity comes find local style products  fresh meats love getting kalbi just back home plus regular grocery store aka alberstons smiths never find cut meat fresh seafood produce all really clean fresh looking displayed really nice organized  prices very reasonable most all products   The food court LOVE place never thought checking out  usually market  wanted check since brother telling ramen stores  ended getting meat jun island style store  awesome! exactly meat jun back home islands  egg batter just right heavy light  dipping sauce tasty  comes rice mac salad nice hot fresh clear soup not sure call but great starter cleanse palate speak couple side dishes kim chee bean sprouts  Both really good  love kim chee general   The atmosphere nice laid back lots tables chairs  never super crowded maybe could loud? service excellent call your number paying attention come drop off food  Something different most food courts  All stores food real plates nothing strip mall food court all paper plastic  Nice change knowing every store family run places chain places see normal food courts  island style twice but point few times try other stores  <EOR> Backstory    My best friend Kelly Korean always used come ask go  bookmarked some reason beer ventured out  Jump present time Kelly moved back home heartbroken  ease pain place bookmarks decided finally come here   Now wasn't blown away  Maybe because Kelly sends items mail Korea used it  maybe Korean stuff just isn't thing  more Mexican meat market type girl  Okay okay review    This market high quality fish but any other great types meat  ones limited  felt walking through just snacks chips munchies etc  ginormous amount ramen soups  definitely shocked me  course spoiled though why would ramen box when ramen house delivers fresh practically almost same price    My husband coffee  te picture  He's ridiculously obsessed all gets through long days work  Swears better Starbucks mad hatter    It very cool see food court outside supermarket sushi ramen tofu BBQ grilled type foods  tried grilled one  Thought inexpensive  Just wished would liked more  She said came two sides  sides being potato broccoli fish patty macaroni salad beet salad  potatoes fish patty  Fish party fishy if couldn't eat it  potatoes delicious but ice cold  Which made difficult eat  BBQ chicken though extremely tender delicious  much BBQ taste but good care  wouldn't come back restaurant    Next decided try roll sushi food place rolls only 5 99  husband dragon roll ad thought amazing price  def back sushi place    Warning food courts only take cash    Market shall meet again but just fun walk around come specific reason sushi food court  <EOR> this place when need shishito peppers fix twisted peppers label   its typical los angeles style korea market  beauty store bakery cafe korean old lady style clothes store computer repair store travel agency post office jewelry etc    supermarket good produce  over priced korean snacks  food court ok  employees usually busy playing phones occasionally dont see customers waiting front them  some good  food when first opened but most stuff now just your standard  korean food court stuff  <EOR> The parking lot Greenland less hectic 168 Market's but opinion  only redeeming quality it  Inside cramped organized way does sense  If cart ready squeeze your way past people because barely any room aisles  Although market variety Asian goods primarily Korean market  Probably fault coming first place because named Greenland KOREAN supermarket but aware if looking Japanese ingredients might difficult find need    I looking packaged mochi New Year kind usually buy does need refrigeration  looking alllllll over store finally found shoved between Korean rice cakes corner refrigerated section  also did carry vegetable commonly used Japanese New Year cooking which found 168 last year    Even though specific things don't feel though shopping trip should frustrating claustrophobic  <EOR> I purchased two Okinawa Soba Okinawan Noodle made Hawaii Tuesday soon home 15min  put them freezer   raw partially cooked noodles should stored until ready cook them   Today opened package cook found some mold starting grow noodles   Unfortunately Greenland Market doesn't store them frozen   Just stacked open refrigerator   mold grows   stopped buying raw partially cooked noodles especially Yakisoba 168 Market reason 168 even worse   Fortunately enough Okinawa Soba noodles pretty thick able pick ones mold just cut part off   boiling them examined rest fine however some people may allergic reaction if eat those noodles   also checked other pack freezer opening outer bag sure enough mold   afraid imagine other noodles look stack       also bought some curry yakisoba stack   yet examine those   Raw partially cooked noodles should always kept frozen while fresh   When using them just put frozen noodles boiling water <EOR> Ahh Greenland new favorite market  much goodness   spent almost hour store looking around bought nothing  just over whelmed all great selection I'd probably leave least couple wagons full easily   Being late didn't want pain anyone save next time  First thing straight back where fresh blue crab still kicking ahi trays other fresh seafood all Korean marinated meats ready just cooked Kalbi bulgogi spicy chicken     all kinds Kimchi variations bottles soju round buck ton frozen mandu dumplings pastries sushi Hawaiian aisle all favorite treats list on    I also closer west side town don't rush home before Asian ice cream goods don't melt  Bring cooler if live other side town   There's also really good food court which haven't tried yet because all closed when @ 10pm  But menu prices wall  probably coming back some quick bites  <EOR> Greenland Supermarket right around corner parent's house  when needed pick some Korean chili powder Momofuku Daikon kim chee immediately thought Greenland  think right though hard tell since only

In addition finding all need Kim Chi fried rice bulgogi also pretty good food court where order variety korean dishes  Even through its food court prices relatively high  Probably 8 12 dollars per dish  highly recommend spicy pork rice  Forgot name stall but look menu  generous amount food flavor very good  Pork might little fatty but adds flavor!  Their produce selection ok  think chinese super markets trader joes carries more variety might better quality  pre marinated meats your own korean bbq home though  also premade food section filled Banchan side dishes Kim bap ddok bok ki etc  <EOR> After all build friends praising place expecting better   didn't see anything really special here   course decent mix various types Asian packaged items but another Asian supermarket couple blocks away bigger seems better selection   Maybe employees friendlier but only bought thing couldn't really say   Produce meat didn't look inviting did back when similar market Honolulu   But admittedly maybe just because closed long time ago undeserved charitable memories it  <EOR> I few days back just getting some last minute items daughter's bday  Customer service worst  issue pricing  didn't want honor price displayed  speak 3 people finally honored  trying scene but ladies doing own  walking back forth different people showing them price displayed finally getting price honored back register all items bagged already scanned but then wait longer because couldn't find items scanned saved register  asked if scan items front but insist finding it  When finally found items noticed lady made bigger deal should speaking other lady actually honored price being very passionate words  She obviously speaking another language near where standing  thought disrespectful  obvious she talking situation  way  bad customer service  disappointing because used coming here  Because won't returning  <EOR> It's while since whole debacle feeling sick getting bunch deli items again issues since  getting various pancakes specially mung bean chive seafood pancakes braised fishcakes various kimchee    I shopping clean convenient work all Korean staples basic Asian staple items  prices vegetables fruit pretty reasonable though sometimes quality hit miss but generally more good bad  Only thing don't really buy meat  carry mostly sliced meats bbq  sometimes marinated meats  fish selection small compared other Asian markets but generally pretty fresh area doesn't stink fish just because there  always nice smelling here    Of course bonus food court various other businesses all same building  Eat shop post office kiosk often routine mine  <EOR> Probably wife's second favorite Korean grocery store!

Large selection cheap marinated meats everything tried far great  Spicy pork isn't fatty great flavor although don't consider spicy all  usually add more garlic chili paste before cooking it  Bulgogi pretty good but may marinated long enough since flavor wasn't really set in  Same kalbi ribs which also extremely fatty  Yes know cut supposed marbling but excessive    They also ready fry tonkatsu pork cutlet chicken katsu  Katsu simple but creates such mess hate it  Awesome option  must season meat because flavor even w katsu sauce  Spicy chicken just ok teri chicken flavorful juicy   Their regular meat section cuts varying quality including some beautiful expensive kobe beef  Next small hot cold prepared food section  best thing beef pancake  Its beef patty w carrots other veggies mixed dipped egg pan fried  Its patty version meat jun  Whatever just it  FYI label simply said beef mine    Greenland best selection Korean snacks nori instant soups  seems only place carries fav potato noodle soup    Ladies check quick friendly although always talk Korean  respond staring back blankly        I've only tried homemade fried mandoo island style  Its just Korean aunty used love also Hawaiian sun juice w it   This market pretty damn awesome but still prefer SF market spring mtn decatur produce seafood spices since Greenland solely Korean  <EOR> When gotta kimchi action where go?
