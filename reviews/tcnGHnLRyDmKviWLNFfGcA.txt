Also no long johns fries boo <EOR> Now understand why long John silver's facing las vegas   no drive thru service location no sense urgency   love product but employees managing restaurant right people enjoy good piece fish    <EOR> We area thought would give place look see if things changed  turned around 180 degrees  tables clean looked much better  Could still improve some  ordering waited immediately food ready reasonable time  If keep raise rating next time  Thank keep please love Long John's <EOR> I am only giving star because hae order show publicly   second time 1 month  gone Long Johns twice  seems can't together    I month ago  When tried through drive through sign said drive through closed   inside waited line 20 mins  Finally front line order  restaurant full people waiting food  ordered waited too  two hours total  Listening girl behind order ask 5 breast girl told only 3 breast right now  time she food could cooked more enough whole restaurant   gorl counter said every order because easier them remember  Sounds lazy me! Where OWNER?

She said she sure  asked came them corporate? She said think manager  told mother law lets go   That restaurant SUCKS!! <EOR> Wow!!!  having eaten Long John Silvers long time decided go  inside planned eating there    When only two people inside  appeared finishing meal   walked counter stood several minutes  could see employee appearing working drive window  Finally someone came counter   actually three people behind counter  But only appeared doing anything    We both placed orders fish meals L4 two small drinks   total came $22 66  paid credit card somewhat surprised much fast food bill two basic meals come to    Anyway bill paid waited food prepared served   side note paid another couple came lady ordered fish sandwich  She told $10 58  She asked clerk much again told same thing  lady's response indicated she happy actually surprised LJS fish sandwich going for  seemed pretty high well   Apparently LJS trying ahead $15 hour disaster before actually takes effect never happen though because fast food inexperienced unskilled employee worth type wage especially LJS    lady opted lesser priced item  don't blame her    After five minutes tray food placed counter  already discussed getting tartar sauce vinegar fish  looked through restaurant dispensers could find any asked counter person items  astonishment she told didn't any tartar sauce!!!  kidding me?!!!   No tartar sauce fish restaurant??!!!  could believe it    At point told clerk if didn't tartar sauce would just prefer money back  She started yelling something Spanish another person walking around back restaurant     actually hoping would find tartar sauce would eat food still counter  No such luck  clerk finally came drive window area handed $20 51  waste food    Wait second paid $22 66  difference fine accepting meal going way?  going happen  told clerk much paid she back rest   refund back cash soon left restaurant    So LJS come to?  Based numerous other bad Yelp reviews would appear some serious issues location  could those stellar not employees filled restaurant according other reviews could know may lose job think $15 hour solve all problems with  time real LJS  drowning sea restaurants dot every corner neighborhood    I back  <EOR> We felt fish chips lunch  long johns Big mistake sorry say  Very disappointed  used very good before  Now realize why all closing  <EOR> Employees horrible attitudes stink   floor tables all dirty such waste time am completely disgusted experience <EOR> I arrived 1 20 PM could find clean area eat  Someone really needs clean dining room dirty grease  <EOR> Lobby decent but when walked no one   ordered told no corn  heard another customer ask honey told didn't any  no napkins lobby either  condiment area mess  Shortly quite few customers came ate meal just watched chaos   Very poorly managed bad service   No wonder low rating here  Won't return  sure  <EOR> STAY AWAY!
