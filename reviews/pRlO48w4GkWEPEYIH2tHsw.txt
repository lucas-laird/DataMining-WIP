I ve before breakfast thought pretty good  I returned few weeks ago dinner group 6   I very disapointed bread basket banana bread carrot cake nice brunch but dinner ? don't know  I ordered quiche which pretty good but also came muffin strange combination ? fruit plate    Overall restaurant good food nice but don't think should open dinner then maybe change menu   <EOR> We search Saturday morning breakfast landed here  last few experience for dinners less wonderful but good memories baked goods thought would good breakfast spot   We early 8 30a service great coffee never ran low  ordered crab cake Benedict disappointed  spinach seasoned all small drip hollandaise sauce lumpy seasoned potatoes bland  boyfriend ordered corned beef hash one favorites breakfast corned beef clearly fresh made came slab beef  highlight breakfast apple streusel muffin came breakfast  hot gooey both really liked it  Sadly muffin service rest mediocre breakfast returning  <EOR> We came Thanksgiving never treated poorly  manager way over head no control over service restaurant  Apparently reservations don't mean anything  tip all skip place you'll wait eat until 9pm when reservation 6 45  <EOR> I always felt price point Mimi's high get   Menu selections average   wife loves place she would give 4 stars but unfortunately am writing review <EOR> I did work catering order couple months ago Mimi's such great experience hubby decided try breakfast couple weeks ago!   What difference couple years makes!    Everything fresh delicious friendly service throughout   love egg white omelettes!  Bloody Mary very tasty too!  back very soon! <EOR> We ordered Shrimp Chicken Fettucine Dijon Salmon salad soup  Pea soup salmon regular salad pretty good  fettucine confusing taste mixed spice overpowered everything  worth it    They 3 seating areas bar 2 separate large seating areas  sat near kitchen area dark very inviting  waitress slow paying attention all  arrived just past 5pm busy all  table filled started bread salad soup addition main dish she did offered put away anything  No iced tea refill offered waited forever catch attention desert long just asked wrap desert to go  good first experience branch  hope next time better <EOR> Why did Mimi's take all good meals off menu  No steak eggs! No Santa Fe omelette!  new potatoes no flavor  <EOR> This place pretty good food decent prices quantity  patty melt cooked med cooked perfectly only prob rye bread grilled butter but toasted  bread dried pretty good almost crouton edges  Ceasar salad good dressing fries surprisingly good  thing can't miss dessert sampler trio $4 99! don't usually dessert but really good  small dish apple crisp bread pudding brownie ice cream! wife shared enough two us  Very tasty! Can't wrong here  Staff very friendly helpful  Valentines Day lunch coupon which said good holidays  didn't consider Valentines Day ' holiday such Xmas July 4th  manager very nice coupon honored no problem  comfort food pretty good  <EOR> I think exact location pretty poor  While located big shopping center Rainbow 215 all way back center along Chili's Sammy's Woodfired Pizza  imagine if more visible along street it'd more popular   Anyway place good all day long breakfast served  usually mixed berry pain perdu haven't disappointed  Some servers seem favor older patrons   Not really place those looking young hip environment but safe bet place decent food ok  <EOR> I love love love food but only gave four stars because don't new changes       Prices gone skimped down thier kids menu   totally eliminated kids dirt cup which kids LOVED only reason always wanting there  <EOR> I always come parents because such homey atmosphere   always good service pretty much everything ive tried here  parents love frequent mimis when come visit las vegas  <EOR> We served artichoke frites lemon basil aioli   aoili which similar may base shiny dark yellow coagulated film over part it   touched sauce finger found barely cool   When pointed waiter he basically acted what's problem that?  When asked if because mayo base maybe darker shiny film may safe eat he acted same way if he didnt understand why issue   offered solution just could use marinara sauce dip them instead     The manager busy helping friendly  but sometimes very absent  server deliver orders must informed aioli issue because he did speak it     Beyond food a mussels dish spicy marinara sauce pasta good except flavorless french bread something resembled whipped butter but tasted more whipped vegetable oil served before meal   But because possible gastrointestinal hazard aioli sauce lack concern just can't bring myself 3 <EOR> Service started VERY SLOW  waited over 10 minutes any service being seated  Finally some help course time more enough time already knew going order  huge hankering Bloody Mary remembered decent ordered Bloody Mary's  YUM! only good part meal experience  husband ordered Monterey chicken thing chicken noodle soup Monterrey chicken burger fries corn chowder  Bacon side which ask again cause forgot first  burger suppose come pesto aioli  did not  Disappointing  Only came mayo  Sad  Chicken although tasty  Corn chowder yum  husband impressed  half half  mean its Mimi's Cafe is  Blood Mary corn chowder yes please try them  bread pudding Yum! Don't hold your breathe service though  <EOR> I've many Mimi   yet disappointed any them location no exception     Took daughter sis brunch   cajun chicken sausage eggs pumpkin muffin   comes glass oj cost $9 50    actually good deal considering OJ see charge glass OJ Denny's holy cow !

Service good  <EOR> Been few times now while much better any Dennys iHop still seems very pricey   breakfast lunch far   While both good more care spend  <EOR> Amanda server she cordial checked me  I ate in fairly quickly without having ask refills  The Food made well franchise chain cafe expected lot less  belgian waffles warm soft but crunchy outside  eggs made order turkey sausage okay  would come back if around area craving brunch food  <EOR> I don't chain restaurants because almost always disappoint  food bland tastes prepackaged and or overly salty portions strange way much hardly enough french fries cover plate service isn't best    Mimi's no exception    My girlfriend friend came around lunch time Saturday afternoon because close house none felt driving very far  immediately regretted decision once started looking menu watching food travel through hands waiters section    My girlfriend ordered cinnamon french toast  dry took much effort chew eat  friend ordered some type eggs benedict  ordered grilled cheese sandwich fries cup tomato soup    You can't really mess grilled cheese sandwich right?  thought  Yet somehow able taste bland dry  fries okay but only received handful them  waiters chef see plates before taken tables right? tell plate looks thrown together three year old right? Awful     tomato soup only thing worth talking because pretty consistently good  probably only thing menu consistently good only reason why review gets more star  also only reason able enjoy grilled cheese sandwich dipping yum! Another thing really bothers waiters obviously trying sell something  said didn't want any drinks  don't tell ask 4 more times if want try new mimosas   already ordered diet soda water  already said no politely  Please don't feel walking through used car lot President's Day    And usually extremely critical service    but seriously guy? top off service extremely slow   Every time chain restaurant regret it  Never again  honestly guys many other mom pop type places opening spending $10 20 person Mimi's really isn't worth it    Make them step game before eat here! <EOR> Great food! looking another place breakfast besides dennys ihop   tried Mimis good!
