After becoming bored typical chain pizza decided give Angelo's try am glad did  ordered pick cheese special added sausage mushrooms sun dried tomatoes very good  women store friendly polite bathroom clean ranch dressing cups ordered side better most  reason getting 5 star rating because feel skimped bit mushrooms extra $1 75 could lot more pizza  But overall good going back again  <EOR> We ordered delivery Angelo's last night seeing coupon mailer   ordered 2 hamburgers but wanted them hoagie rolls instead bulky rolls   coupon subs   meatball subs menu so figured would charge meatball sub but instead just chop hamburger 1 3rds put sub roll    Well spending 15 minutes fellow taking order come find coupon won't apply because coupon only applies subs listed menu recall basically ordering meatball sub without marinara      We say ok just bring order without applying coupon    Delivery time 45 minutes long but ridiculous    But then order completely wrong!  Instead  hamburger meat sub roll Angelo's put hamburger meat tortilla wrap which course never asked for    wet soggy mess   called back spoke Sam turns owner he such bad attitude   He said no substitutions allowed menu   order taker should never said would put hamburger sub roll He then explained could come down right now refund applied another order   Well already decided would order Angelo's again said just bring correct order      Sam said would another 1 1 2 hour wait because slammed    But said why should wait behind other order when your establishment messed order first place   order should take priority  Sam said he could anything wait time   Reluctantly agreed wait delivery   Finally correct order arrived nearly 10pm original order made 7 30pm      The delivery driver complained he wastes much money gas deliverying replacement order because kitchen constantly messing up  He gave complimentary dessert felt sorry him   told spoke Sam asked if someone else management should speak with   delivery guy said would no good because Sam owner    never order Angelo's again   headache! <EOR> If could give them zero would  ordered online over 2 hours when finally called cancel order  previously ordered them did take while but never long  <EOR> This place horrible! First all ordered food inside live bug crawling all over it! disgusting!!! called Angelina's back let them know old lady rude there's no way would bug your food container  drove all way back restaurant showed live bug crawling all food  All she said oh wow really bug  wanted money back being disgusting live bug crawling all over food having drive all way back lady's rudeness towards me  lady said would call later when owner there  back home called Angelina's Angelo's lady answered said owner busy would call back   owner never called back  next day called able talk owner Sam  He rude told he could refund money! told live bug food unsanitary front desk old lady rude he still did nothing me  He very terrible owner should treating customers kindly  hard would refund 9 bucks customer happy want maybe come back being live bugs food! Sam obviously doesn't know run business because main thing CUSTOMER ALWAYS RIGHT! If Sam wants business he should treat customers better cleaner restaurant!!!!! would recommend place anyone!!!!!!! personally don't live bugs food rude workers rude owner!! TERRIBLE SERVICE! <EOR> This place best food place clean staff always nice  surprised negative reviews  Love everything tried far  personal favorite Philly cheesesteak would definitely recommend place everyone  <EOR> I see why place bad reviews ordered them once before took over hour half order ok maybe little busy reordered them order comes wrong call them let them know order wrong lady phone says give ten percent discount off your next order said don't want would just receive food ordered she said ok when delivery driver gets back driver must driving New York because still haven't seen ordered never never order place again totally unprofessional <EOR> Received flyer mail yet another pizza restaurant   time Angelo's pizza    We called pick up   ready time looked good when picked up   Tasted ok cheese toppings good but sauce just mediocre   crust nice light   Overall just another average pizza   order any local pizza restaurant find type pizza Vegas   Pizza hut still tastes better  <EOR> delivery takes long!! Almost two hours before received food reasoning was Friday night 7pm everyone ordering same time   But  didn't order food 7pm ordered good 6pm told 50 60 mins delivery    took way longer second time happened but time justified because Friday!? First time weekday food showed cold soggy excuse then accident he stuck traffic thought would try again Also wings over done couldn't even eat them $17 down drain! don't problem waiting understand places busy but young children don't  then even enjoy food sorry won't ordering them again  <EOR> I've eaten pizza wings several times  wings delicious pizza some best  always friendly great service yet disappointed <EOR> I would review establishments food unfortunately given opportunity    I leaflet menu door long day work decided give them call  1 minute into call why The young lady phone refused exhibit even basic customer service skills  asked #5 Combo Deal  Pizza + Wings + Chicken wings + 2 Liter  Good deal money except wanted boneless wings something readily available menu   seemed pretty simple substitution but young lady phone just said Yeah can't that   Why   Its just computer can't it  Excuse me? Okay your computer set weird  Talk your boss manager call your mom anything    I offered pay extra substitute    Nope    The least she could done put hold talk superior things worked out  didn't ask impossible outrageous just boneless wings    I didn't feel respected customer leaflet now trash eating some mediocre chain pizza  Sorry Angelo's! tried give money but wouldn't it  Better luck next time but won't next time me   t <EOR> While freely admit am tough judge when comes pizza am sure just your average pie   bragged freshly made dough sauce doesn't mean great flavor   Good value toppings very plentiful tasty but overall product nothing special took way longer said   suspect since called order didn't start making until arrived   other reason would take 45 minutes 14 pizza 2 toppings?  I hoping broaden choices pizza but only place remains topped  <EOR> By far longest time ever wait pizza ordering online arrive store early pick told going take 10 15 mins later    So 45 mins waiting listening cashier talk shit waiting counter food ordered over hour ago  thought myself professional attending needs timely manner making wait then proceed talking shit behind swinging doors    I would highly recommend going down street papa johns Pizza Hut  <EOR> We ordered line when 25 minutes later said just order Then took another 30 minutes food Your better off call them directly  food very good pizza great sauce good  cheese sticks Very cheesy good  garlic knots die good  if never ate food should put review  Why even there  <EOR> My boyfriend live down street Angelo's pizzeria  ordering them over year now  If wasn't they're great food probably wouldn't back based off customer service   There's older lady works front counter every time pick food she seems unorganized she's rude she worst customer service!! Don't bother calling every time called put hold several minutes time  Usually hang call back would just place another longer hold  When inside pick order just shake head watching scramble around! Multi tasking strong points LOL  Since ordering over phone obviously option bf  usually order online  Besides crappy customer service long delivery times ordering online way go   Their food other hand delicious!! usually order pizza calzones  first time ordered calzone ordered small shocked big was! yummy  second favorite item deep fried mushrooms  melt your melt nice crunchy  own dough sauce ranch dressing  Each time order sure ranch  Its die for! always order few large sizes it   This place definitely worth try food wise  But don't expect best customer service  sucks!
