Especially when come form warm soft delicious pretzels!! work literally 20 seconds away location hard come everyday  smell goodness baking outside since always busy know your pretzel going fresh    The factors making review 3 star instead 4 5? ok paying $3 piece bread pretty much   more entire loaf bread grocery store  Another thing wait times ridiculous  line over 10 minutes since always many people  employees super unprofessional nice    But whatever  love carbs despite all negatives fat butt back fulfill cravings  <EOR> The pretzels didn't look fresh shift leader attitude  <EOR> My favorite place visit but wish could give location negative star customer service  stopped grab drink while shopped  waiting patiently watched 2 staff personnel roll dough  apparent no register take orders  line grew six people ounce acknowledgement staff  Two 6 customers left realizing no being served  courtesy someone wouldn't hurt  actually would kept negative review being posted  Hopefully someone corporate read use post opportunity customer service retraining  <EOR> I knew Auntie Anne's Pretzels last vacation Manhattan NYC wanted recreate positive feelings  The place pretty crowded when arrived but didn't wait long order   But then wait nearly 15 minutes pretzel nuggets cinnamon sugar    best thing when you're craving some pretzels!

I still visit other pretzel locations when mall happens only time visited Auntie Anne's location  <EOR> The inside store looks pretty old lines usually long whenever stop here  Because old interior kitchen doesn't look very sanitary shouldn't expect much quality pretzels either   The cinnamon sugar pretzel nuggets come tall cup good amount nuggets  coat nuggets tons cinnamon sugar though last bits pretzel nuggets absolutely caked sugar! pro con depending much sugar your pretzels  <EOR> Exceeded expectations  stopped early morning beginning road trip Southern California some fresh baked snacks road  4 different varieties all fresh excellent  pretzel bread quality excellent fresh compares favorably any Bakery product  <EOR> The food good  just really annoyed customer service provided  shift leader Diamond took long pauses during transaction speak friend line behind some work drama  Apparently someone filed complaint she felt necessary deal first   People conduct business shouldn't management positions   <EOR>
