When arrived and even when left only ones dining  greeted waitress Lolo very nice knowledgeable entire menu  However list dishes somewhat confusing no images nor descriptions menu specials wall board lengthy all required vocal description waitress  required good 5 minutes understand menu   I ordered lotus chips w scallops fried rice yakisoba noodles Nigerian prawns broiled w truffle butter tobanyaki w filet mignon  lotus chips expensive $10 but somewhat worth price  Don't expect filled but good representation Asian fusion food all about  fried rice yakisoba noodles scale 1 10 10 being best 8  Nigerian prawns delicious but $26    again don't expect filled  Finally unfortunately tobanyaki w filet mignon    just never came out  waited patiently 40 minutes politely inquired waitress told order never placed!

Super  Hands down  We did 7 course meal premium sake  awesome  super picky eaters because palate all around world aside fact cook well reviewing restaurant saying great things something    The flavors just right u taste every bit it  <EOR> Excellent food! met chef Kevin nicest guy you'll ever meet excellent service but most all food exquisitely delicious! <EOR> THE WORST CHEF EVER! 2 friends late night around 1 30 am only 3 people restaurant whole time  whole meal great until ordered yakisoba yakiudon both same sauce which tasted baked beans  rest party  politely told waitress disliked 2 dishes she came back check informed chef owner would reimburse 2 dishes hadn't even eaten  He then came table tried justify misfired dishes threatened call cops if didn't pay bill its entirety  recommend restaurant EVER! <EOR> 4 1 2 stars people   really?! Where begin?  When walked realized restaurant somewhat small  Luckily reservations seated right away  potent rancid smell coming front kitchen  no idea but decided continue dining journey anyway  waiter took order truffle edamame bone marrow salmon salmon tuna tacos other items did try but family ate    The food started coming when say really mean one  edamame first small portion ok  worth $5  Then five minutes later tacos much wasabi ok  worth $4 two tacos  Then bone marrow oh salty couldn't even eat it  take back! Obviously worth $17 didn't even ask if wanted anything else since didn't it  salmon good but drenched sauce which am big fan of    Everyone practically done eating but more entree waiting specifically person fiance  came last he eat food uncomfortably while sat watched since done eating  practically took 20+ minutes first item set table until he food   ridiculous!  We didn't even see waiter he took order which annoyed even more  ask check another employee  Overall flavor great portions small appetizers! actually left restaurant hungry hell thinking going somewhere else eat! joke    Seriously questioning if just punk'd  think did  Japaneiro you're good punk'd me! <EOR> I really excited try place since friend said must try it    Service really great when first since only other table seated  Once little busier waitress seemed little frazzled  waitress friendly very knowledgeable menu items though  permanent menu give specials constantly change which located wall which really hard see unless your seat    We ordered rock shrimp which said creamy yuzu spicy sauce  alright  dish more sour anything else  also salmon tuna tacos  fish seemed fresh but other nothing really rave about  main dish ordered NY steak tobanyaki which comes side white rice  presentation nice because comes sizzling plate waitress pours sauce right front caramelize  dish good but tasted similar teriyaki    Overall experience ok  glad tried food selection unique but don't think would come back  <EOR> Despite being super close strip place delivers   bone marrow wagyu fantastic   hairy crab sashimi amazing   Loved homemade Tiramisu   definitely visit again  <EOR> Went birthday dinner    Great quality but small portions   Good if japanese latin fusion   Service great  <EOR> Pretty unique fun little spot  good selection main menu such Tuna Tacos Yakisoba the Japaneiro special crazy good comes Angus steak Shrimp Lobster     However real fun comes seasonal specials  Seems ton items only available stock them  just Salmon stock last night Salmon Belly Ceviche super fresh delicious  Also truffle bone marrow which just great sounds  even gave bones take home because dog's birthday! he signs off good review well   For dessert both Egg Roll banana dessert Milk Tea ice cream some best ice cream Mango cheesecake desert  Both amazing  am huge cheesecake fan but texture awesome  Also comes little kick cayenne honey side  waitress also telling owner's wife gelato but currently leave back 6 months    Overall wait staff super friendly helpful offering menu choices based tastes well providing unique experience thinking dog   Reverse happy hour 10pm 2am  No liquor license yet bring your own beer wine!
