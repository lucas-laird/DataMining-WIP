Sadly food neither good nor bad just    was   Bland closest adjective give it   The salsa bizarre strange tangy ness unexpected off putting  consistency kind Cholula hot sauce true salsa  beans beans loose side dip  Pretty decent better salsa  chips fine   We each ordered fajitas he steak chicken flour tortillas  steak swear no flavor all  just tasted cooked meat   chicken slightly more flavor but really nothing write home about  saw spices but strangely none tongues  no zing no heat no depth just    food   Now tortillas  those awesome  Really good tortillas freshly made    Where lacked flavor department did service  While initially forgotten being seated way back toilets reminded them existed extra attentive  Overly even   think could tell didn't love food asked box just few bites I decided try hand improving upon leftovers next day  very concerned being happy  said smiled nodded  just didn't heart tell them thought food mediocre  They brought extra hot tortillas no additional cost very appreciative tipped accordingly   The meal itself pretty pricey mexican restaurant opinion  $15 $20 person  maybe  going rate but used more $10 $15 plate high end fajitas   Our bill without alcohol $49 including tip pretty high 2 orders fajitas if ask but maybe just old fart recalling used quarter movies  don't know   Anyway feel bad being totally love them  lacked flavor made customer service 3 stars is  <EOR> Anyone read reviews Mexican restaurants knows judge Mexican restaurant first Chile Relleno    then anything else might have   My first impression Lindo Michoacan restaurant does take Chile Relleno seriously establishment serves only ala carte item item included within combination dishes  NO entrees Chile Relleno itself     waiter recommended order couple Chile Rellenos just own entree    He just does see difference!  Chips Salsa Large crispy warm tortilla ccrn chips  Very tasty appetizing Bean Dip Red Chili Salsa concoction  FYI kids told take easy Chips Salsa during Lunch Lindo Michoacan charges customers Lunch extra Chips Salsa! WTF!!!!  Chili Relleno Abover average size Chile but immersed very watery very watery sauce  Relleno disintegrated while just sitting there! Ttalking Hispanic friends California found Relleno very difficult item make     but Rellenos also staple any Hispanic restaurant   Camarones Ranchero Immersed watery Ranchero sauce reminiscent Chile Relleno sauce     coulda same sauce! $16 pricing just way much money below average preparation  NOTHING innovative recipe Shrimp Ranchero Sauce entree would justify high price! Lindo Michoacan should apologize every customer before seating them high prices below average quality    Tortillas Hand made home made flour tortillas   Besides Chips Salsa best part Lindo Michoacan experience   I'll temper two star rating kids' above average ratings  love Mexican restaurant some reason  positives home made Tortillas Chips Salsa does offset negatives watery sauces smother Chile Relleno Camarones Ranchero compounded very high prices below average service  <EOR> I think eaten all Michoacan locations through valley original Lindo Michoacan Desert Inn far best  worth drive  best Mexican restaurants city  love chips beans salsa bring when first sit down  never fails finish every bit  fresh guacamole table must!! taquitos fresh they own home made tortillas   husband whole fried talapia devoured every bit  super burrito biggest burrito ever seen also delicious! several times never disappointed  <EOR> Excellent food! queso fundido pretty amazing well 4 shrimp entrees table tried  waiter Albert terrific  native don't know why never before  definitely returning don't even mind 30 minute drive here  <EOR> I spot  liked staff atmosphere food   We big hurry explained waiter brought food super quick!

Service terrible waiter today Sunday December 22 2013 Irving took money then came back acting innocent asking if wanted change back low can't believe Jack place!!!!!! <EOR> Really good food but wait 30 minutes check done eating further 30 before picked charged  Might just busy but still ridiculous  <EOR> Been couple times each time leave tummy satisfied  Service great but menu items kinda pricy  But lunch specials bargain good amount food  love everything tried portions more enough  thing keeps coming back table side guacamole  fresh seasoned just right  <EOR> Love place  husband frequent always enjoy ourselves  Great atmosphere great food awesome service  love margaritas chills salsa come bean dip without being asked  Really place great don't know why took long review <EOR> Just ate tonight family say most pleasant dining experiences some time   The food good  don't know if any item really blew away but food top bottom satisfying  combination plate chile relleno chicken enchilada tamale  tamale which actually reason ordered plate probably weakest thing hate but more made good enchilada very very good chile relleno   For desert fried ice cream favorite dish night sopapillas  Both delicious   Now having mentioned food want say part outing made night service  plenty good food plenty places  it's really hard find Las Vegas  Finding place feel great Saturday night purely strength service though?  lot harder   Everyone waited smiling prompt very nice  bussers key waters full tables clear  orders arrived quickly everyone particularly nice interactive baby  If fact during course meal lady brought stuffed burro restaurant gave us  entertained daughter long enough finish dinner   I hope evening anomaly because looking forward same treatment when return  really set place apart really made nice Saturday evening  <EOR> Really enjoyed welcoming atmosphere salsa beans Fideo soup treat too  soups could little more home style authentic although still good  back try more stuff  <EOR> It's just very good used better but never really good  remember when opened big success immediately  never understood why popular call 10 year restaurant   place where eat don't really food then 10 years people telling good think maybe missed something  try again am reminded why did first time 10 years ago   We ate again recently because open late  meal disappointing usual nothing terrible but nothing good either  only ate half meals did containers take leftovers home  kind pricey also $100 two definitely worth money   Las Vegas great town Mexican restaurants LA San Antonio are tacos yes but restaurants much  however two places same part town far superior cheaper Lindo Michoacan  El Ausente Hacienda del Rey much better choices better values well  <EOR> Overpriced Mexican food    least 3 restaurants thinking location issue but no!  It themed Mexican border towns   bright busy colors Adelitas dressed female staff    look far current Mexico    The food geared more bland palettes    little better taco truck because served actual plate  But food quality isn't superior warrant premium menu pricing    Chevy's restaurant although Tex Mex more authentic feel taste!    I'm rating 2 stars only because represent another option town other effort     They known margaritas but nothing haven't before any Mexican resort    After going 3 different locations theirs Including Green Valley restaurant only gives patrons false sense status but lacking major points food quality service food temperatures SNHD overall experience place    GM's take notes hope welcome constructive criticism your place better option town  <EOR> I can't say enough awesome place is  great experience  hosts wait staff food decor mariachi band  Everything really great  welcome break strip  Next time Vegas absolutely going here  <EOR> I haven't location LONG TIME! tend frequent Carnegie Henderson  less 5 minutes house Summerlin   Place packed Friday night seemed overwhelming number people celebrating birthdays night!
