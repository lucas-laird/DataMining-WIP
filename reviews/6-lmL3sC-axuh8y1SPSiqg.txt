Oh sweet gracious underwear   Never any good Michigan     The peppers huge heat flavor balanced nice    back 2 more times while area   Wednesday 99 cent chicken taco day   other items ok but tacos especially chicken where at  <EOR> I Robertos church ordered Torta specifically asked NO ONIONS even little girl next repeated people behind counter  hate onions bad experience child! really feel put extra Torta just rude! granddaughter help pick them off  awful experience all around <EOR> Roberto's mainstay Las Vegas Valley decades  never disappointed  Quick good food  <EOR> Attention now serving food poisoning fake mexican food need shut down  Pls stay away  just bought burrito couple hours into day started throwing  better Mexican restaurants around valley waste your money crappy Ass  fake Mexican food joint  cooks behind counters probably don't give shit they'll serve whatever probably don't even give shit proper food handling stay away places trust me <EOR> I multiple Roberto's  prepares food BEST  another review said biggest chicken tacos! skimp sure! Great cashier too! all around 5 stars! <EOR> I last night  wanted order two items  California burrito carne Asada fry side shrimp  First no spoke any English  couldn't understand wanted  Both items together should cost no more then 15$  When she tried charge closer 30$ confused bc also added wanted shrimp burrito  When said no didn't she couldn't understand saying  Then phone rang she left took phone order gave cook then did something else then came back me  she kept trying charge things didn't want  cook no help either  left without ordering anything while wait 20 mins   Worst ROBERTO'S ever  <EOR> I live LA but Vegas every January July couple weeks visit folks  Roberto's always first stop regardless if am hungry regardless if don't feel eating mexican food regardless time is   I usually two beef tacos combo but lot other items menu   love bacon breakfast burritos   best but pretty good  Overall food never disappoints   always made fresh price food reasonably priced   The only complaint only reason why gave 4 star 5 because red salsa   used favorite but when came visit July 2015 noticed red salsa tasted very bland some kind plastic taste it   thought Okay maybe just made bad batch    But came back January July 2016 2017 noticed still same taste   it's good once was   don't know if changed recipe but stick salsa verde now on    <EOR> I am San Diego enjoy Roberto's having grown food   Usually good but particularly bad day just wanted food home   I ordered Carne Asada chips but Carne Asada fries  When asked ignored then he read receipt which said fries   I explained didn't care receipts said ordered chips  He then turned next person line started taking order!  I paid $9 something eat   Do location 2nd time row order wrong overcharged! <EOR> I love Roberto's store meets high standard every Roberto's ever visited  few fast food restaurants offering vegetarian items menu am regular  always buy bean cheese burrito quite deal $3 45 but quite mark extras $1 10 pico de gallo $ 50 lettuce totally worth it!   amount quality food receive great place stop when need pick quick lunch    A great thing Roberto's stores also salsa bar  fan salsas hot lily white girl but love cucumbers radishes carrots okay they're little hot because they're mixed whole jalapeños   Walking door tasty burrito filled vegetables addition baggies full veggies salsa bar less $6 incredible    Some things don't like  I'm particularly impressed tortilla chips  made fresh but don't flavor   You wait your food but doesn't take long  Everything made order  no heat lamps here!  Some things like  I really Roberto's doesn't skimp size burritos  athlete often famished long run 13 1+ miles ride 75+ miles   go to place when need quickly replenish calories   They're open 24 hours  <EOR> We when wednesday  tacos $1  break made chicken   Add couple limes now flavor land  <EOR> Finally found solid Mexican joint great foods solid prices staff can't speak word English which ok because throw down kitchen    Must try Carne Asada Fries post pick POWERRR <EOR> I'll three rolled beef guacamole combo cheese quesadilla guac some chicken tacos extra quac  Thank you  all  <EOR> Our late night craving Mexican fast food calling decided place  needed  very filling service fast price reasonable  definitely back when craving hits again  <EOR> Carne Asada Burritos Rolled Tacos    They're Yummy! Yes Hot Sauce Actually Spicy  Can't 24 7 Service Either  <EOR> Rip off  Maybe SoCal snob when comes taco shop but huge let down  Guacamole thin watery  Carne asada fries over $8 but 20 French fries box Carne tough bland  Even salsa watered down  guess all Roberto's created equal  paid over $12 food still hungry  <EOR> Now burrito place  Breakfast burrito choice spicy carrots top notch environment simple easy going  Mexican place stuff dreams  Thanks Roberto's! <EOR> We come very often   other Robertos but taste different   always shrimp burrito comes rice inside little kick spicy department  Their horchata admit very good   location convenient where live another plus  <EOR> Is Wednesday? Yes means  99 tacos Roberto's!! Oh yeah!!  Roberto's Tacos originally CA locations all around Las Vegas area all pretty much uniform Good Mexican food fast  serve traditional Mexican fare very reasonable price    Everything pretty good but favorite dish Carne Asada Nachos  warn however may never satisfied any other nachos if try these   As someone posted earlier don't Tex Mex  also don't ground beef substance tacos within taco   consider pro  <EOR> Fast friendly cheap greasy  perfect Mexican restaurant! I also love 99 cent chicken taco days! <EOR> We delivery through Postmates twice now   first time impressed   I starving ordered ton food   guacamole chips cheese cheese enchiladas relleno burrito California burrito tostada   Maybe should start saying am New Mexico VERY high standards Mexican food   chips cheese literally chips even melted yellow cheese them cheese enchiladas toastada super underwhelming   relleno burrito pretty good  second time well  boyfriend seemed enjoy California burrito well   Only Mexican food since here   I looking new Mexican restaurant  <EOR> Don't know taco shops Vegas maybe just spoiled living SoCal most life but lack flavor used to  meat using something different  cheaper texture noticeably different flavor obviously different  can't over but people awhile don't seem notice   even Mexicans lived many years   they lose own taste authentic flavor  9 10 bucks per burrito??? Yeah   no thanks  <EOR> I thought closest location but isn't!   I only chicken tacos green sauce pretty good  tex mex though! <EOR> As lover Mexican food more specific Roberto's disappointed particular restaurant   food isn't par compared other locations around Las Vegas   ordered  bean cheese burritos way much cheese runny refried beans   quality beef used tacos also subpar unfortunate recipient its   after effects following day   restaurant usually clean staff pleasant just wish food good other Robertos around town  <EOR> The place does ever stop   late night stop always satisfies need drunken sub par kind real mexican food   Seriously though dudes work place crack good putting some pretty good mexican grub    <EOR> This place great better taste Mexican fast food  three rolled tacos guacamole great  salsa bar wonderful marinated onions carrots  Mom brother dinner menu which great quality when want dinner quality fast food  no drive through 24 hour location  Enjoy! <EOR> When you're hungry when your time short when lot your mind last thing want fast food comes Roberto's rescue  Always open always great food free carrots scallions jalapenos could ask anything more?
