First off Panna Thai Restaurant looks bit more upscale your average Thai joint which think reflects price well   We walked relatively empty restaurant weekday   waiter brought table he immediately asked if any coupons before even sat down    did but apparently lot floating around bit restrictive used   think also restaurant com too   Lunch specials available everyday 11 am 4 pm   all include fried wonton fresh salad steamed rice soup day  You substitute fried rice brown rice $1 more  Started off miso soup   Interesting choice    I Yellow Curry Lunch Special Tofu Thai yellow curry Thai herbs served Jasmine rice  $6 95     Fried tofu potatoes main components dish   Raw bell peppers decorated top   wished cooked veggies curry though   fried wonton peas carrots bit different normally find inside those things   biggest problem rice   mushy much water cooker!  never good sign when rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special Deep fried short ribs sauteed garlic black pepper sauce served Jasmine rice  $6 95 tasty dish lots flavor but then again deep fried sounds would tasty   Overall found Panna Thai just okay experience   definitely few other Thai restaurants neighborhood foot selection taste price  <EOR> Clean Place kinda slow service but food taste really good without doubt    sweet scenery beautiful paintings attach wall    always order through Eat24 Lunch specials really descent food size serve    love place <EOR> My family love place  Always great service great food  usually order shrimp pad Thai hubby gets Tom kha spicy kids chicken sa te meal share!!

Trust best thai restaurant ever eaten! <EOR> We celebrating anniversary New Years night thought restaurant perfect spot  wrong    We entered restaurant no issue seated right away   when everything wrong  waitress took long while order when ready girlfriend asked if all orders delivered same time  because main dish tom kha kai which tends come first because they're served appetizer  She also ordered pineapple fried rice because  she enjoys soup  Back order when she asked waitress if all food delivered same time rep retorted not so reassuring Uhm    hope so  She chuckled walked away  Experiencing displeasing if weren't even going try happen   We waited while food come guess what? all came separately  First chicken satay which ate pretty quickly  Then soup noodle entree  girlfriend tried waiting fried rice when she realized soup getting cold  Very displeasing see eat me  point she started eating soup thinking twice other order still late  she another server tell them she didn't want order anymore    The food very basic  Nothing stood mind  noodles lacked little bit sauce appeared dry  satay rubbery peanut sauce along bland  girlfriend liked soup but impressed mushroom used it  Still hit spot    Overall would come back second round? No  restaurant courteous enough give 10% off discount trouble which surprising because didn't really seem cared beginning  Anyway we're paranoid repeated offender think we'll pass restaurant somewhere else  <EOR>
