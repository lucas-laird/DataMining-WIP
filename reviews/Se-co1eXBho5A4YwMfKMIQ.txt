Try coffee   it's best coffee town <EOR> If wasn't focused gluten free breakfast might given them higher rating     I drawn place gluten free menu   Most places offer gluten free limited menu Griddlecakes no exception   But did signature GF griddlecakes menu course  ordered   thought needed something round breakfast ordered couple sausages eggs well   really wasn't necessary because griddlecakes huge two them   Loaded butter syrup all more all normal person should eat   lot GF flour based fare heavier wheat flour counterparts   Sadly griddlecakes floury under taste   would recommend talk staff could corrected before ordering them again    On other hand wife country fried steak gravy she rated very good   she absolutely loved pan fried scrambled eggs  which looked more scrambled eggs home battered eggs most places   She also coffee connoisseur said coffee bitter but if wasn't different tastes wouldn't 100 flavors supermarket     The staff very friendly helpful   kept coming back check kept coffee cups full well  setting fresh different   sort 1950's made modern   Hard describe but real nice   place small but luckily wasn't busy when no trouble getting table right away  <EOR> I first person when opened 7am seated almost immediately  Waiter super sweet attentive when needed refills  Food delicious fresh had french toast just right amount cinnamon sugar  All all great first impression! <EOR> The service pleasant efficient but food didn't match expectations  restaurant bright clean but chairs quite uncomfortable rigid  relaxing environment  Breakfast memorable  food adequate executed someone following steps recipe  review written experience generic uneventful  <EOR> Great restaurant nice service  something skillet  going again mornings although when family  order very customized managed all accurate  <EOR> Food good staff great!

Which fell love instantly  love simple pancake taste yummy  Oh ordered raspberry drizzle side cause why not?   Apart yummy pancakes service great! Nick clearly sweetheart seems owner manager awesome well  busy during Sunday afternoon he helping waiters waitresses  He also cracked few jokes table  definitely back! <EOR> I woke mid morning mood some breakfast y food luckily came across place decided try out   I pleasantly surprised portions pay you'll able enough take left overs home  cute american style breakfast lunch spot open until 3pm every day  wasn't able take picture menu but quite selection add substitute no issues  If you're mood big breakfast oatmeal parfait options well gluten free section which thought pretty neat   The staff friendly very attentive  kid friendly providing high chairs booster seats well kids section menu  looks fit some big parties since there's already tables put together then there's booths middle restaurant   The only reason why didn't rate 5 stars bc warm inside  overheard some parts day temperature vary maybe next time earlier but lot fans waitress did address warm even though wasn't much issue us  first timer 4 stars should reassuring definitely try out! <EOR> Good food good service  especially nice great toppings pancakes  <EOR> My family would've really enjoyed eat but unfortunately wasn't important enough serviced  husband told young lady front he wanted order she didn't even acknowledge him  Other customers line even felt she did rude being everyone else serviced before yet him    Unfortunately family did feel discriminated against being only minorities place business     Honestly we're just hard working family wanted enjoy some breakfast off day understand harm that  <EOR> Came grab some breakfast since searching yelp saw place four stars  tucked away corner next past Thai places lunch Panna Thai    There hostess front greet walked door which nice considering busy were  place pretty small ran high chairs putting two chairs together baby's car seat    The menu wasn't extensive helps look other reviews yelp  ordered  Monkey business Chorizo scramble    I personally love anything peanut butter  Sadly disappointed when tried monkey business  pancakes bit dense felt add ton syrup because missing peanut butter flavor  chorizo scramble better pancakes  flavors chorizo good thought dish very tasty    Overall service good towards end staff more attentive which nice  would try other things pancakes though  <EOR>
