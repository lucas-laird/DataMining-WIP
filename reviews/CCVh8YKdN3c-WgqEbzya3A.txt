Like     Did put special butter France something? Please    cannot serious  <EOR> Overpriced burger fries slow service   Can't expect much only food available hotel    <EOR> The food average breakfast lunch café    My only problem as employees café give exactly order  Now know big deal but irks when place order tell them specifically want give anyway    For example first time stopped breakfast asked just bacon eggs  No potato no bread  told them couldn't eat don't mind paying extra items receiving  course when food came did plate potatoes bread  Sadly waste food throw away  could simply avoided if actually listed me    Then second time came breakfast I thought would give second chance said same thing  even told them first experience promised would give potatoes bread  But course when came it  hard understand someone does want bread potatoes am sure common thing  Many people request all time  mean come if allegoric touching all food  guess would throw away whole $15 breakfast???  Needless say learned lesson when elsewhere breakfast rest week  <EOR> Convenient quick bite before hitting strip  Ordered chicken burger fries huge burger patty melt fries huge! some tacos meh   Regular priced Vegas delicious  Can't complain  <EOR> If need eat there's nothing open guess cool  Good quick coffee pastry  Exotic Fruit Platter pictured $12 sake quality sweetness suppose worth price  Cup chicken soup $5  bad but use pasta elbows some type veggies see chicken skin floating in case freaks Asian don't matter However nobody else waiting food forgot soup  Literally empty place  actually thought maybe making scratch merely scooping soup pot but no just forgot lol Couple left didn't even finish pasta food  didn't look worth entree prices $16 $20 all sandwiches look dry af too  <EOR> If need quick breakfast staying Vdara good choice bit expensive side but quality very good service very attentive  ordered steel cut oatmeal bowl friend ordered avocado toast both $14 each   waiter let take fresh cup coffee which awesome! <EOR> I'm absolute love Vdara but place fails very terms sets itself    1  Overpriced bad bagel smoked salmon all but undrinkable coffee weirdly heavy pistachio macaroon 15 dollars    2  Very very slow disorganized   3  Worst coffee life  a tie Burger Heaven which serves bilge water but drink anyway because people work street NYC    Market Cafe intended provide alternative 20 dollar omelets other breakfast foods room  Admirable but frankly Doubletree Hyatt Regency charge 15 omelets not room which more breakfast prices line regular overpriced breakfast fare hotels    The omelets looked okay but great  heard scones look better taste  sandwiches clearly your best bet likely take them pool  macaroons traditional they're extremely heavy more straight marzipan  pistachio unimpressed    Beyond incredibly slow  saw blonde runner age didn't know marathon weekend Vegas bazillion times  She says Market Cafe service always pretty much sucks bagels aren't bagels true     I loved very large gorgeous wedding band engagement room  say more Vdara which handful other hotels Vegas strives forget fact Vegas  Even casino slots neighboring Aria civilized very reverse traditional casino other side Strip    My salmon bagel capers onions cream cheese chive 8 75 which much  But coffee 4 dollars don't know manage coffee WORSE Burger Heaven NYC but Market Cafe managed so    Service overall Vdara impeccable never well yes some point want leave 570 foot room which did enjoy until 12 38 AM when finally checked closure Strip stupid idiotic marathon could just well put middle nowhere suburbs but choose rather put center town thereby shutting Vegas down day    The market part  Kashi frozen food Wolfgang Puck etc good concept  But sure could find Whole Foods something stock kitchen half price  <EOR> Was served Salmon raw inside waiting nearly 40 minutes  waiter served he apologized wait saying cook fish long time  joke   I ordered breakfast day before told wait bar across lobby someone bring food  plenty room wait empty restaurant  waiter brought coffee told condiments back restaurant   It's they're running psychological experiment far push hungry people  <EOR> This review long over due but devouring meal previous trip felt compelled finally sit down type out   I've loved options different food side kept refrigerator area change variety always there  Each time stay Vdara sucker frozen cookie ice cream sandwiches  Don't ever rid those PLEASE!!

Maybe  why theyr'e super slow because they're servicing people eating cafe entire hotel room service    We ordered two items patty melt sandwich breakfast burrito probably waited 20 min? Another person waiting complained service people waited probably 40 min! Holy moly!   The second time came ordered pre made sandiwches think just heat them much faster! opinion those pre made sandwiches way better yummier! favorite chicken sandwich aioli sauce maybe chipotle?

Basically your dream stop shop essentially    I drooling over some pictures saw online place but then quickly dried when saw damage it'd already swiped many times debit card   don't really understand pricing food here   i looking some salads they're just medium sized honestly kind looks someone ate some $13  what?! haha could expensive? They're leaves!    Anyways food did though good   Vdara cheeseburger comes shoestring fries   Asked bleu cheese smothered yum!!! sorry those hate it fries really good except put little much salt  my lips chapped end     Overall if you're staying Vdara would say easy something might well   But honestly wouldn't way come just because expensive   If dropped price bit bet it'd line door every time   or maybe  why!!  figured obviously  <EOR> I staying Vdara while Las Vegas work  needed quick bite eat place conveniently located lobby hotel! ordered club sandwich could enjoy room pleasantly surprised good service large portion delicious food!
