The asparagus 6 pieces over cooked  backed potato OK but could crunchy skin   Lastly gave them more chance dessert ordering Creme Brûlée  boring caramelization over done bitter rubbery    Overall paid much if eaten Stripsteak Cut both very good strip casino steak restaurants yet received subpar dinner  would recommend anyone eat unless 50% price  <EOR> Prime rib usually favorite cut meat but boy definitely changed mind coming here!  I would highly recommend getting Prime Rib Dinner which includes salad cut prime rib side mashed potatoes Yorkshire pudding  Yorkshire pudding little odd but more later   The house salad delicious signature spinning salad tossed table side  wheel around whole cart prime rib prepared different temperatures depending your preference  just tell them size cut want slice right you  think favorite part eating prime rib horseradish sauce  Lawry's gives two different kinds really concentrated kind which clear your sinuses week whipped kind which light fluffy better more sensitive palette   The prime rib served side some mashed potatoes  also option some la carte veggies creamed spinach creamed corn  Then give Yorkshire pudding which always thought dessert  But dry kind bread let soak au jus mop all delectable flavor   Overall nice dining experience coming back again  Good celebration even romantic night out  <EOR> I prime rib thats servers dressed 30's waitress outfits looked nurses outfit anyways great service very friendly  Ordered appetizers calamari good all but ordered prime rib cook carver comes huge stainless steel serving station he opens flame carves meat based size would cooked carves right front your eyes served right no waiting  btw sour dough bread awesome      will try again  <EOR> A couple friends pleasure dining fine establishment lunch  Everything experience sensational service food ambience such great lunch experience only $180  highly recommend finishing your meal off cheesecake best ever had  <EOR> We always Lawry's whenever we're Vegas never disappoints!

Juicy soft side dishes yummy too   It's old style set waitresses dressed diner looking outfit  Very cute   I would given place 5 however server wasn't friendly informational establishment  He never explained history business place  party 7 families first time which stated  Chicago location whole spew wonderful restaurant but Vegas nada   He did offer sides cream corn spinach but forgot mention additional charge those  thinking came meal   The desserts just okay  Free valet parking <EOR> my friends craving meat prime rib specific better place lawry's?   what ate spinning salad fun watch even better eat  super classic salad but nice start  california cut thinner cut meat but perfect me  gives enough room eat all yummy sides creamed corn side sweet creamy mushroom side very earthy well cooked  liked variety mushrooms banana coconut pie seriously best really long time  crust nice coconuty coconut cookie  perfect dessert  BUT slice huge! perfect share two other people  just right size when need some sweets  pros service perfection always food awesome! everyone loves when cart comes around cause eatin time! able rez right before walked in didn't rush us  very late dinner probably last patrons but no rushed meal let use enjoy every bite huge dining room! plenty seats small large parties  cons bit stuffy  when beverly hills location type place older rich people go  but regardless nice treat yourself especially winning some money roulette table! no meatballs! maybe came late maybe don't location but really missed mini meatballs beverly hills location usually bar appetizer people waiting  oh well  would come again? um    duno maybe if town mood prime rib minus buffet    corkage fee $25 i think??? <EOR> Yes prime rib kicks ass here  Probably best Ive ever had  Whenever Im Vegas always try friends away casinos venture buffets into Lawrys   Its good service excellent its always packed house here  Your dinner doesnt come plate via server its rolled carving station ! They're proud meat here  <EOR> My wife reading all Yelp reviews  impressed  dinning room bright banquet hall feel  prime rib good but awesome  better prime rib enjoyed atmosphere more Palm Forum Shops  <EOR> Yum! Easter dinner few nights ago did disappoint  prime rib mashed potatoes creamed spinach spinning salad  All amazing  took home half dinner incredibly large serving  ordered mushrooms appetizer garlicly buttery delicious  Service outstanding  <EOR> Definitely worth every bite    Yes those annoying reviewers frequented House Prime rib hard compare   Lawrys actually offers other options steaks lobster   salad great bread basket whipped butter too   started shrimp cocktail large meaty prawns nice spicy cocktail sauce   both prime rib really enjoyed thin cut juicy flavorful   creamed corn much better creamed spinach HOPR better    Portions huge could finish   also tried sticky toffee pudding but lackluster sticky much toffee flavor   restaurant many unique qualities waitress outfits old school decor   If mood yummy piece meat give place whirl won't disappointed   Free valet parking too  <EOR> Met colleague lunch other day   while since Lawry's excited see if still good remember   near Howard Hughes business area there's always ton businessmen women having lunch weekdays   mind decided meet 11 30 am opening time lunch rush   I chef ordered BBQ Beef Sandwich $12 Cup Chili $5 Iced Tea $3    BBQ Beef Sandwich very good   Beef juicy BBQ Sauce slightly tangy sweet    just way it   negative amount Sauce would preferred less Sauce     you can't control amount Sauce though served way   The Chili amazing!  easily best Chili ever had   Vegetarians though     there's Beef Chili   combination ingredients perfect    I wish knew it!  also slight spicy kick too   The atmosphere upscale professional perfect lunch meeting   Overall great experience   Hint If want try amazing Prime Rib but don't want pay Dinner prices come lunch Lunch Cut Prime Rib which $20 believe   Did Value money?  Yes  Will return?  Absolutely  <EOR> FANTASTIC! both Prime Rib lunch cut all 3 sides  Creamed corn best ever tasted  Creamed spinach good  Mashed potatoes gravy good  Service excellent Amy waitress   really liked idea mobile carving station  Less work less chaos   Sad men don't enough manners remove hats hence sign telling your parents failed   Only part didn't manager appreciating some folks don't give private information willy nilly  If don't want give full name phone number should laughing  some respect your customers preferences  <EOR> Every corner near Strip filled luring opportunities pampered  Sensory overload gluttony and every other deadly sin within arm's distance  Welcome Vegas say! Lawry's provides atmosphere compliments kind fine dining expectation but also few more classy perks side  Overall Lawry's provides 4 star experience leaves your prime rib cravings quite satisfied    Food Lawry Cut $44 Probably better Prime Rib options buck  10oz substantial amount doesn't disappoint  Since cut right front you'll probably getting varying degrees well done ness  medium rare closer rarer side dad's closer medium side  Lovely juicy tender portion prime rib gently seasoned but marvelously welcoming any added flavoring if wish  meat sauce gently splashed side welcomed hint flavor complements prime rib without taking spotlight away it  Adding some horseradish gives slight heat still highlights rib personally mixed mild strong both worlds without overwhelming palette  just hint!  expected meat closer bone juicier more flavor but whole portion beautiful very satisfying  Lawry's prime rib really seals flavors! Spinning Bowl Salad no mistake you're going classic garden salad special dressing tastes close Thousand Island some croutons  Spin around apparently salad supposed seem little more gourmet? Sorry really wasn't special no matter many times spin it  expected lot more salad  lot more baby greens maybe less iceberg? cold plate salad rested nice touch though nevertheless   Pros Excellent flavors commendable menu options  Prime Rib options worth looking into  Luxury night fancy food? Yes where wear your suit tie dress if wish! Helpful attentive wait staff  asked food 5 different employees  Complimentary valet parking  Yes!  Cons spinning salad just didnt cut it  it felt underwhelming compared other food items! cheap ness stood more anything else  Maybe just table but kind foamy spongey under table cloth  thus made hard aerate wine  Also seemed kind cheap since normal tables never odd layer? tried some father's medium rare steak really large portion medium well pieces  Meanwhile mine more rarer medium rare  understand why difficult perfect searing cook levels when you're carving station  but would bit angrier if paying medium rare something less stellar!   Horseradish hints come creamed mild grated much stronger horseradish options  ventured off mixed both them in between option since both polarized  turned perfect just wanted just enough heat mildness! Try yourself separate plate lather away!  In end hard time reconciling great flavors options price paid  no doubt Lawry's quality note worthy prime rib options take no fear those love cut meat   will granted satisfaction heart's desire  Cheers! <EOR> first time ever try lawry's  excited try eager try much expectations them impressed everything turned excellent!   i two days prime rib wynn bellagio buffet before going lawry's  kinda  too much  like beef overload  but didn't stop going lawry's third day prime rib  wat great decision would probably crying regretting if didn't  best prime rib ever! well  so far    service also something mention nearly all middle age women hostess servers  feel special taken care of  rmbr server Miss Wilson she unbelievably friendly very talkative  first thought all those ladies kinda scary because very dramatic cartoon like  or if wanna call fake  fine  reminded fairy godmother cinderella's dunno why kinda look her  but anyways service really good   food wise cox prime rib super delicious  think lawry's cut did split plate which charge extra $15 but portions pretty big   then split everything mash potato salad two lobster tails ordered  would say everything great besides mashed potato  don't know why just more just butter cream another taste didn't much  also mushroom sizzling plate side  good but oily fattening high cholesterol  o well meal superb  kinda craving now   oh  n did tell u also salad front called spinning salad ice filled bowl pour dressing sky high  kinda cute  dunno wat dressing but salad goood! <EOR> Such amazing experience!!

But Lawry's most people fan because well  employ large metal table side carts just House Prime Rib does Van Ness City    They least 5 different sized cuts small sliced medium large super large in bone  most popular Lawry's Cut  $37 but comes tasty chilled Lawry's Salad mash potatoes bread pudding  order optional sides cream spinach recommend good corn  served warmed sourdough like bread before meal   We started bar having 5 trade show cooling down over cocktails talking shop  great crunchy potato chips bar  seated hostess when your table ready served waitress separate chef carves your meat plates table side  4 ordered Lawry's Cut side creamed spinach  fifth order increment larger Jim Brady Cut  lot food especially started 2 plates calamari appetizers split which came tasty Chipotle spiced Aoili dip    The service great food very good ambiance nice relaxed    Lawry's Flamingo Hughes Center between Paradise Las Vegas Blvd the strip    PS Lawry's seasoning only USDA Prime cuts good Prime Rib  But favorite part still Horse Raddish!
