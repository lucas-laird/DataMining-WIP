Just tried Fritos enchilada melt  bad lunch  try it    sure Id another one  gets little busy during lunch staff just focuses getting out   If eat usually pick meatball marinara buffalo chicken  <EOR> I usually don't good customer service location rarely go  But thought should just give place second chance also starving no choice haha  But instant walked artisan named Ashley nice such radiant energy even made happy!  think come back again because her! <EOR> Service really slow   person working enough   walked 2 weeks ago same reason   better choices area   come here  <EOR> Good great here  But member staff constantly screws order  Every time Pedro screws sandwich doesnt ring item then tries over charge it  Take instance today  usual bmt  chips drink added soup  transaction rang he starts yelling making drink  said yes made eye contact while said yes   he tries charge over 2$ extra drink demanded he rings whole order again because am being ripped off man again  return subway again if Pedro still working here  He obviously some kind language barrier blatantly does listen people  <EOR> Customer service horrible flies buzzing around food even girl making sandwich act she didn't see even another employee tell eat meatballs because couple hours when girl working just served somebody else  incredibly okay  street better service quality  <EOR> this more customer service issue now far since coming location customer service good morning afternoon they're cool lol  But whoever bald guy works nights needs some sleep something don't know hell issue but he always attitude when come in  <EOR> My girlfriend stopped late night dinner 11 30pM when entered restaurant noticed man working sweater no subway shirt  ordered food while ordering repeat ourselves few times since he headphones on  don't think appropriate headphones no subway shirt wash your hands before making sandwich customer  overall experience subway very disappointing  <EOR> This place needs phone number added  forever no way contact them <EOR> I stopped afternoon ASHLEY working solo she nice friendly made sandwich extra yummy when said EXTRA toppings she put EXTRA! I also questioned if Veggie patty Vegan she checked unfortunately isn't  She even offered use different knife me   Great customer service Ashley! <EOR> This Subway location Jones just south Warm Springs  find same shopping center Thai Style Noodle House yummy! Lucky's Bar   This pretty much your standard Subway location  big thing going fact open 24 hours day! Sometimes leave work early 5 am options scarce time  Options typically JITB McD's Del Taco Don Tortaco  If want eat something decent without blowing Goodyear blimp probably best way go   I guess biggest complaint place every time seems lot toppings look bit old crusty  Lettuce pickles tomatoes looking all dried shriveled up  Foul  just don't add those toppings sub   The young lady works early mornings always very nice friendly though   definitely appreciate 5 am!  Subway isn't necessarily first choice sub actually even top 5 but 5 am best option going definitely pinch  Just keep expectations realistic you'll fine   It's A OK!  3 stars  <EOR> The option pick ingredients want your sandwich great thing  Usually turkey vegetables chipotle sauce  choices breads great thing also  Always service smile here! somewhat healthy option compared fast food places  Subway shows comparison napkins  bad breakfast well  <EOR> I avoiding location because service awful right around corner why irritated? But person driving stopped location other night  kid behind counter patient sweet little girl front us  mom ordered then asked she wanted  could tell she no clue took awhile order  guy behind counter kept saying thanks your patience folks right you  time turn he still friendly personality working us  tried new Chicken Caesar Sandwich very happy  Glad gave location another chance  Hopefully rude staff members no longer working there  <EOR> I usually good service location but today RIDICULOUS!!! guy working today 9 22 16 @ 3 54pm  terrible slow making sandwiches  asked add bacon foot long response im sorry cost extra money said know response sure? look broke? money then he apologizes he put 2 pieces bacon foot long response excuse normally put 4 foot long your first day? no its but if put 4 bacon charge $1 50 2 only   75 response yea know read once again MONEY He finally finished sub sat down eat slow guy didnt even cut foot long half  wasnt even busy look stressed  confused  he seemed he needs extensive training move faster understand some people financially stable life $1 50 big deal them rude treat customer broke cant afford asking for  guys name Goran dining area also mess usually its nice clean location  <EOR>
