Carnevino definitely meat lovers joy but maybe little over priced get   My boyfriend carnivore steak addict point where friends recommended he come here   We started Beef Tasting Menu while crudo well done issue many places seem raw Kobe appetizer  Something little more creative same meat! would lovely  say really loved beef cheek ravioli stole boyfriends because felt portion needed more it  Personally wet dry aged beef good beefy meaty but preferences run towards melty buttery type steak  preferred dry aged wet   the wet aged just seemed little bland comparison    We veered off course bit boyfriend wanted MORE meat ordered dry aged bone Rib Eye 2  didn't eat much boyfriend devoured but meat flavorful sure   just style  Ending tasting menu desert which can't remember because generic  think creativity could lot better   Service good helped find wines pair dinner well  server excited wanted more steak but maybe he just wanted bigger tip resulting massive bill? worst part meal being seated area looked onto casino hotel walkway  prefer people staring meals when eat    Lastly price  While cuts meat good just don't feel costs justified done meal  creativity lacking maybe because such meat BASED restaurant   but feel could more creative    If liked dry aged steak big bold Italian reds place your  But prefer steak melt butter mouth isn't place it  tell boyfriend enjoyed far more did  Otherwise maybe try another more diverse restaurant Palazzo Venetian Restaurant row  <EOR> It worth every penny  ambience excellent for main side which on Caprese delcious tasting portion sausage orchiette perfectly al dente osso bucco very good girlfriends filet mignon fantastic even medium well   think since Celebrity Chef restaurant inside top 3 hotels vegas strip prices could higher! Honestly! Yes all al carte but sides only $9 when could $12 other steakhouses  petite filet $10 less other steakhouses think its best bargain celebrity upscale restaurants vegas  <EOR> This second visit Carnevino  first right opened best dinner experience 2008  say last trip left little desired  Some dishes especially pasta amazing  orchiette pasta sausage broccoli rabe black ink pasta crab meat jalapeño fantastic  prosciutto wrapped cheese puffs which melted your mouth last time visited served luke warm very disappointing  steak course very flavorful serving two more enough four share    The biggest disappointment reason why only getting three start trip service  took 1 2 hour bottle wine    service remainder meal mediocre   I would try Carnevino again but would try lunch sit bar only order cocktails pasta     <EOR> It Totally SUCKED never back even mention anyone  Totally disappointed lamb chops octopus calamari sausage broccoli rabe asparagus bread bread Oscar Mayer sausage piss

let post WHY <EOR> Starters lame but steaks bomb drinks strong service freakin great   If afford porterhouse way all day <EOR> Pretty steep prices but Batali doesn't disappoint  Started octopus intensely nuanced flavors  both filet which cooked perfection order medium if medium rare  Service very attentive knowledgeable food  downfall music  Strange hodge podge 90s pop rock  Decor nice rustic elegant but nothing crazy  sure Boulud Brasserie Venetian compares but if you're looking classic steak probably your top choices  <EOR> I almost never leave reviews but feel compelled order communicate just impressed professionalism Carnevino staff yesterday evening   wife tried dine another Strip restaurant but left hostess treated rudely extreme lack class   Even though arrived Carnevino 11 05 p m  well final dinner seating manager duty graciously allowed sit main dining room where other group still dining   eaten many other Batali restaurants both New York food almost always stellar   meal no exception   started off two sides  mushrooms fregola corn  appetizers   Both healthy portions close family style size both well executed   mains shared 1 spago pasta lamb ragu 2 tagliatelle vegetable ragu   latter ragu typically accompanies gnocchi but chef agreed accommodate request sub tagliatelle   other restaurant which shall remain nameless instructed order quickly because late kitchen wanted close even though dining room still full people ordering food    Carnevino contrast attended if VIPs despite late hour   All all food great once again   But night superb service salvaged otherwise would horrible night  <EOR> I came recently business dinner  service phenomenal  Knowledgable everything menu including individual farms all produce came from  When served perfectly choreographed everyone table received food same time   Ok food  started caprese salad which best ever had  mozzarella just melted mouth  starter bread fantastic crusty outside but soft warm inside  came soft butter thought whipped olive oil which turned lardo lard back fat which tastes good but non meat eater put down  roast chicken good outstanding but good  Mashed potatoes ok but mushrooms delish  Others table filet mignon shaved truffles all said best steak they've ever had    Dessert trio sorbet again good but nothing special    Overall experience fantastic decor romantic  food good but bit inconsistent  would again just service try pasta which admiring another table  bit expensive get  <EOR> Once again am wowed place  wine starters amazing  But just when though could any better ribeye dry aged 3 months am hit something extra special  reserva steak  Bone NY strip  know your thinking  those  But try dry aged 9 months  Yes 9 months  Unbelievable   mention truffle pasta even kale salad something special   Truly best steak anywhere atmosphere service fantastic  Mario Batali genius   I am once again reminded why must every time am Vegas  <EOR> I believe when neither ordered any alcohol waiter lost interest providing top notch service   both ordered steak no sides meat fine honestly nothing outstanding nor worthy anything close price   Unless just hit large jackpot stay away place  <EOR> Carnevino best Steakhouse Vegas probably world!! Lol  Seriously though only restaurant world dry aging steaks anywhere 2 11 months besides Hong Kong  literally something can't anywhere else America  worth every penny!!  live Hawaii dined last two times visited Vegas probably keep going back  First off would address or rant sorry few things place help figure if Carnevino place you!!     First Just any other steakhouse Vegas Carnevino cheap   won't say much spent but website see prices see if  your price range  literally takes few minutes help know getting yourself into  point prices listed pastas smaller portions appetizers usually shared between 2 3 people  Steaks high price point because exclusivity steak course also because lot product lost during dry aging process but necessary great dry aginess ?   Which brings next point     Please know dry aged steak is!! am no expert know don't want cut paste Wikipedia article assume you'll able look if don't know is  also literally takes few minutes  Dry aged steaks everyone  completely different steaks store even steakhouse chain such Morton's Ruth's Chris aren't good steakhouses just don't dry age steaks  When see reviews saying taste cheap supermarket steak cook steak better just shake head  If cook steak better why steakhouse?! cook something cannot possibly find supermarket!? experience Carnevino's steak no other     Third if tenderness you're looking suggest finding place Wagyu selection such Cut Craftsteak  personally steaks aren't worth paying huge price unless dry aged  Craftsteak payed around $200 person American Wagyu tasting menu which opinion just regular tasting steaks    Everything else Tom Colicchio sent though amazing  side note if YouTube Craftsteak show butter poach steaks if cook compare tastes exactly same  pleasure dining Cut but hear great things  offer wet aged steaks which typical steaks dry aged steaks American Wagyu even Japanese Wagyu steaks   Might next visit  another side note did know Wagyu steak intended more texture rather beefy steak taste   Japanese intend Wagyu melt your mouth just great piece Toro does much huge beef flavor     just few things keep mind when deciding if down try Carnevino  Ask your server riserva should order enjoy knowing something enjoyed only two places world then thank me!! Hahha    P S  Service excellent when ate here  server brought white truffles ooh ahh at  Don't know busy gets but sure try your dinner special  But if you're high maintenance complain tip bad everyone favor just always stay home!!! Hahhahahha server humor!! <EOR> I disappointed  meat wonderful but atmosphere service high price  service slow all staff seem racing around     literally  middle mad dash waiter   And blaring music  atmosphere want in  Could wait leave <EOR> A lot mixed reviews one  Some 3s Some 5s  middle option  Here's why Starting food complimentary parmesan balls few other yelpers mentioned delicious nice small start ended being really great meal  Appetizers shared table included Insalata Romana daily special which consisted baked bread topped burrata ramps  special quite tasty  ramps provided very subtle complement burrata  salad other hand comes anchovies overpowered everything else salad   A friend split Florentine Porterhouse which delicious very nice crusting outside cooked excellent looking medium rare inside  Really didn't think could any better until friend previously gotten same cut ordered additional gorgonzola mascarpone one around six sauce options   Amazing  definitely elevated porterhouse few steps now consider best steak ever had  grilled spinach hot peppers provided nice spicy vegetable side which just right amount kick without leaving aftertaste might otherwise interfere steak   So why all am giving Mario's steakhouse four star review?  few annoyances first service just average few missteps along way biggest problem came when steak florentine presentation came out  ordered medium rare steak indeed medium rare  However line chef written Medium ticket waiter announced chef written  caught let them know definitely wanted medium rare  double checked but between roll whole presentation tray back pretty humorous but bit odd  Next   atmosphere seemed off  glanced quickly way may another possibly main dining room other half restaurant but party placed other side split which open air casino  Now love hometown Palazzo very good smoke filtration system bad but can't life figure any reason you'd want noises scenery casino right there  really seems odd definitely annoying choice   So because all fact couldn't seem $18 salad right  Four stars  <EOR> 3rd time here     Bone in rib eye key meat lover's heaven  also enjoyed skirt steak Carpaccio  hotel priced    but you're LV    why heck not!

For side brussel sprouts mashed potatoes egg they added bacon tidbits only thing made good !But world   Then completed dish tiramisu again mistake made two desserts because gave chocolate peanut butter torte first which did order servers said now compliment chef since already table  We cappuccino green tea   I paired steak Pinot Noir  must say good wine but glass way price   I hoping well compensated worth dining experience respect paid but failed expectations  I must say service great except getting order right steak dessert    Lastly complimentary chef cheese puff pastry instead regular bread  <EOR> Booked family birthday celebration while Vegas   7 people put table private alcove which fantastic because could talk each other   Main restaurant very loud   did find sommelier helpful when trying order champagne   sons ordered individual rib eyes loved them   mashed potatoes come poached egg center which mixed table   big hit asked order without egg   Pasta intended course portions small   enough ladies but really nothing special   Ordered tiramisu dessert phyllo dough both just ok   Overall enjoyed because private space service but food just ok  <EOR> Get table main room  wine cellar across really loud    One big server's schtick really old really fast  He robot    Had 12oz Filet Oscar  Awesome  Strawberry Yogurt thing really good well    Again place lot but cannot deal schticky waiters  <EOR> Went yesterday spent evening husband  food very very good but definitely overpriced we paid $160 porterhouse steak share   The server very sweet helpful but many

them   waiter all LV waiters very strongly pushed few dishes but glad he did   beef cheek pasta bolognese dish both sumptuous perfect amount bite pasta     let's talk beef   don't daunted choices menu   wanted ribeye but ribeye two which definitely bigger head arm attached   waiter told ribeye which absolutely wanted     how describe it?  ordered medium rare looked red but bloody   truly perfectly cooked   fat meat flavorful   texture amazing   routinely buy grassfed pasture raised organic beef does even come close this   if chance PLEASE carne vino  disappointed  other things great  the service sides okay extensive wine list <EOR> We wanted relaxing dinner good steakhouse  concierge resort recommended Carnevino  He 4 star the steak less star 'relaxing'  request  room lovely mostly empty when arrived tried seat 4 top doorway between 2 dining rooms would party partly blocking flow waiters patrons moving between rooms  requested reseated second table acceptable  Then trouble began MUSIC better suited Hard Rock Cafe volume major outdoor concert!!!   4 occasions requested music turned down never was  waiter told manager refused that  requested manager come table talk us  did happen either  Really good steakhouses difficult find     especially $$$$ designation    so skip where customer' reasonable request given curtesy response   just table location walk through room while leaving revealed same decibel level throughout  when want spend $500 00 without wine SOMEPLACE ELSE  <EOR> Yet another steak house las vegas   happened staying Palazzo heard good things place   mean c'mon its Mario Batali's steak house its gotta good right? much   1st gotta say hostess OMG beautiful   going back just chance run into again    The highlight evening besides hostess hand made ravioli some sort duck sauce   Just great dish   heavy all bursting flavor   The low bone rib eye two   requested Medium came twitching   cut steak serve only imagine much blood before reached plate    Maybe palate isn't sophisticated enough enjoy flavors meat cooked way but cooked key word   steak just wasn't    Overall expensive dinner left feeling completely unsatisfied    I give Carnevino great wine selection  <EOR> We great steak chicken bread really good well   sides bit salty   Service really good us   People crying price need realize Vegas steakhouse Outback   Overall very pleased  <EOR> A restaurant deserves second visit if recommend other people  Although food respectable ambiance pleasant simply can't recommend restaurant    The pasta dishes intended appetizers egregiously small  Insulting actually  $48 two very small plates pasta  isn't Ponzi scheme   it's Pasta scheme    Side dishes respectable but nothing outstanding  Options steak sauce weak sauce   Carnevino's definition steak doneness rarer normally accepted  other words if usually order medium well would order well done Carnevino  obvious attempt part Mario Batali prevent eyes savages order cuts well done process ruin steak  pretentious paternalistic  order steak well done   and guess came well done medium well promised  would sent back wait food long   There extensive wait food  server apologized twice thanked patience once dinner arrived  declining desert presented complimentary desert  nice gesture but allow offer come constructive criticism  If you're going present complimentary desert management should let patron choose which want   instead testing them see whether order desert  ordered desert suspicion wasn't going complimentary  <EOR> We ate lunch New Year's Eve 2010  ribs burnt black charred inedible dining partner's $40 steak cooked unevenly  comped  ribs drink but still charged salad asked if wanted instead ribs  waiter said slammed preparing New Year's evening rush but still unacceptable  positive Carne Cruda good  Overall restaurants Vegas don't care repeat customers  <EOR> I can't begin tell all problems restaurant again won't back would recommend one  Mario Battali needs actually visit restaurants train staff waiting tables cooking steaks  <EOR> The reserva dry aged steak amazing  While ribeye bit fatty previously porterhouse 60 day dry aged steak amazing well less fatty    For great drink try blood orange Cosmo  <EOR> Pre Appetizers Amuse Bouche Rosemary Foccacia  Appetizers Orecchiette sweet sausage broccoli rabe  Beef cheek ravioli aged balsamic vinegar

ribeye 2   Dessert Chocolate peanut butter torte peanut brittle salted caramel   That progression amazing meal Carnevino  Everything scrumptious but steak particular everything more hoped when picked Mario Batali restaurant   waiter brought ribeye whole bone table carved table side   outside steak wonderful crust tender juicy perfectly cooked inside     The steak paired perfectly mashed potatoes   Note shaved black truffles extra $10 but worth it   market beans least favorite part meal   weren't bad but definitely weren't worth valuable limited stomach space trying squeeze everything else into   The beef cheek ravioli chocolate peanut butter torte also deserve extra shout outs   beef cheek ravioli thanks Yelp reviewers recommending asking that! very good but aged balsamic vinegar really made great dish   peanut butter torte smooth very wonderful crunchy base   All all walked away ridiculously full happy sleepy  <EOR> This restaurant lives name Carnevino  Meat wine says all  Mario Batali Joe Bastianich put together very unique dining experience  because blending fine Italian cuisine along side Steak but due blending everything dining enjoyable  Carnevino located Palazzo Casino Hotel 3325 Las Vegas Blvd  S  would never know dining casino due location restaurant  Carnevino located side casino no foot traffic passing your dining area  restaurant also divided two parts which facing each other  area where kitchen located other itself only other patrons your wait staff  Each area see other but connected which itself quit unique   The first time bit taken aback thought high prices  say though once taste food presented understand prices wonder charge little  wife Bone Rib Eye two  say far best piece meat ever pleasure eat  tender easy eat  did melt mouth  If meat melts your mouth joy meat resting your mouth chew  say bravo chefs created bit heaven earth enjoy  salad prior steak wonderful well  sides equally pleasing   We also most wonderful dessert  would tell but does seem currently menu think would cry knowing no longer able get  know am crying no longer there   I must say am equally pleased wine selection  would expect place called CarneVINO  Somalia very knowledgeable took time sure every customer pleased taken care wine cocktail selections   I also must complement wait staff  two attendance waited only until just before received check  wife both made feel if only patrons establishment  Thank very much Carnevino  <EOR> I suggestion brother reading few write ups Yelp   Service service excellent   great waiter prompt thorough thoughtful   Food started truffle pasta $50    wife liked better but just thought ok   other places where mouth watering but seemed little dry   Perhaps should also used truffle oil butter instead just shaving truffles top dry pasta   We shared bone in ribeye two $140   While caving table noticed seemed very fatty more fatty most rib eyes   tasted ok but certainly worth money   very rich decedent   When done several large chunks fat still plate   Normally well marbleized steak but took extreme   plus cost high given uneatable     Abiance its most secluded place Vegas seeing stick middle mall   table some privacy but could definitely hear mall traffic   Vegas filled great steak places am sure would way revisit Carnevino    especially given price point  <EOR> Glutonous all say  Salami plate peppers tempura fried squash blossom Lobster Lobster Mousse calamari Mid course beef cheek ravioli gnocchi bolognese black fettucinni dungeness crab  Veal chop Porterhouse Ribeye entree  couldn't move but managed choke down some Hazelnut Semifreddo glass Tokjai    The food amazing service over top peppered lardo die for  <EOR> If want break hustle bustle Vegas carnevino offers top shelf servings steak great selection meats  don't famed steak scaloppine cotoletta last couple visits sensational    Wine list vast but extremely top heavy Vegas fashion  still menu two years ago which some better picks $80 120 price point sweet spot  <EOR> First off let explain why 4 star rating   gets 4 stars its steak which very good but average consider restaurant caliber   fun watch them carve table side very appetizing but steak opinion would any good steakhouse     My favorite part meal pasta part BBL tasting menu   beef cheek ravioli amazing definitely say most outstanding dish meal   Even other pasta pappardelle mushrooms opinion better steak   Italian steakhouse least Italian part right     Yes fresh bread very good very hot butter came good however Lardo way heavy rosemary couldn't taste anything else it    The wine 2nd favorite part meal superb   did wine pairing tasting menu just wow each wine different others   really liked server sommelier would explain each nuances while serving it   If your afraid ordering wine just sommelier brought over tell them your price range they'll suggestions based that   meal brought notch due wine   whole would give 4 5 star rating if possible but would entirely because amazing pasta service received  <EOR> We visit Vegas several times year love different restaurants available  time Carnevino  reservations 700 but arrived earlier  No problem  taken right in  brought nice ciabatta role lardo butter whipped butter which delicious  Grilled octopus great  problem entrees  read way cooking steak but didn't believe it  should have  very expensive strip steak came mooing  ate half area bone really raw  made waiter aware just tell chef  weren't looking anything  steak taken off bill   Very surprised  Excellent service  Food mediocre <EOR> As Texan afficianado prime beef Carnevino bad beyond belief  signature bone in ribeye flavorless excessively fatty even ribeye tender  would paid five dollars $70+ steak  total disaster  <EOR> What disappointment!   I wondering if should write review because work restaurant industry don't writing negative reviews but couldn't help it!   In short Very overpriced $1200 5 people  didn't even splurge great wine Wines very overpriced!   Food nothing special small exceptions but should great across board given prices!  Our server great!   However can't say same sommelier  He very helpful zero personality he didn't seem care  am sommelier myself but wanted input because wasn't familiar majority Italian wines menu wanted find good one  took recommendation ordered wine appeared flat little off  kindly asked sommelier  wanted taste tell if way supposed taste  hate sending wine back but really wasn't pleasant $170 bottle  Someone else came might manager  He tasted wine said unfortunately way supposed taste basically told price $170 if ordered cheap wine!!!! O well true cheaper side wine list    So keep wine! Any respectable restaurant would taken back!  restaurant believe restaurant norm  least norm good fine dining restaurants!   I never return would never recommend restaurant anyone  But don't think would care  plenty tourist traffic probably don't care returning customers  <EOR> My friends came bachelor party dinner  second time Carnevino   Here thoughts Venue Very nice designed well  high ceilings made place standout addition layout restaurant  Great group date type setting    Beverages Generous pours all say  wine menu selection great     Appetizer skipped focused side dishes  However jalapeno crab black ink pasta great    Main Entree dry aged rib eye fantastic  amazing aging steak big difference taste quality  leave bone in helps flavor steak  Best steak ever had   Service definitely let ball drop  checking being seated ordering continuous service through night outstanding  never empty glass water    Nice benefits Table side carving rib eye added nice touch cook steak perfectly    Other notes Take picture bull! Try mash potatoes poached egg  <EOR> I best steak ever entire life Carnevino   would say probably better notoriously expensive kobe beef Japan  good was   It steak made night must admit amazing don't remember much everything else   Oh guess foie gras barolo  LOADED shaved truffle sure helped made night but steak totally blew mind   Did mention steak awesomely fantastic?  Ok steak   reason why because husband found Carnevino some 9 months old died aged steak available   If already know dry aging beef itself already rare practice dry aging process actually shrink meat quite bit   if steak house dry aging 1 2 months maximum time would it   advised waiter restaurant would lost 50% meat dry aging 9 months   Anyhow google stuff yourself   order picking cut meat ribeye striploin thick want it   ordered 2 inch ribeye which 30 oz bone in   steak alone $230 ouch but boy good   taste intense melt your mouth goodness   actually very filling well given most moisture gone just lots protein    Aside steak everything else good but nothing mind blowing  restaurant decor gorgeous would but sure return steak  <EOR> Food fairly decent  chicken way dry though  steak fair  sure if back though    The atmosphere okay  music way high  couldn't talk without shouting  wasn't good  <EOR> As registered guest Palazzo tried Carnevino lunch   sat immediately large dining room large wood tables covered white table cloths   When first sat only diners restaurant   end meal three other couples sat   Thus ambiance noise level relaxed so long didn't mind hard rock music playing background      We enjoyed well seasoned light calamari steak sandwich Tuscan fries thinly sliced pastrami sandwich pickled vegetables   server helped pick glass Pinot Noir accompany sandwich recommendation paired excellently     The food delicious service friendly professional prompt   bill $105 including tip expensive lunch but well worth it   believe most Yelpers commented dinner service   Carnevino worth try lunch if want more relaxed atmosphere more choices food selections   Even lunch order dry aged ribeye which sliced tableside weighs approximately 35 40 ounces meat two persons costs $140 according server  <EOR> I gift certificate otherwise would never gone there  Not meat eater    However high cost find inexcuseable could ruin simple lobster tail  5 oz most!!! very very small    Tough cold no butter lemon served alongside     We ordered two side dishes cauliflower gratin broccolli bits pork   broccoli cold very salty   cauliflower raw melted cheese top!  only thing worth eating warm Saffron rice pudding dessert    I very disappointed think entire evening waste time   reccomend restaurant anyone isn't meat junkie  <EOR> It awful ridiculously expensive  party 10 Waiter did whole lot fast talking push table family style  tried slow down but group all getting uncomfortable acquiesced  pasta poor meat super rare great recooked some just poor only thing good octopus  wine menu hundreds bottles wine $150 thousands  checked wine app $150 bottle great reviews guess didn't but called colleague sitting next before ordered it  They'll it     the wine Waiter course pushing $300 bottles minimum  My guess don't much repeat business just fleece people way expedient them  bill over $300 per head several people left hungry  Amazingly disappointing  <EOR> An experience would wish worst enemy  Three requests same drink  A glass wine took 25 minutes prepare   I believe required ask three time glass water  35 minute wait gelato   really?  When noting lead waiter service substandard especially considering paid $130 per person shocked when Manager smiled told party inaccurate describing experience told party going pay everything including mandatory $250 tip nothing do  add insult injury when Manager came back table bill she brought two security gards going oversee table until bill paid   never treated poorly entire life would recommend ever stepping foot establishment    There many good options Las Vegas even run risk being treated this  yourself your guests favor enjoy dining experience where restaurant treats patrons some courtesy   Cheers So  Cal  Food Junkie <EOR> Should rated higher!

fingerling potatoes   full happy it   My buddy burger fries   never seen happy eat burger   They wide variety Italian beers most which I'd never seen before even fancy craft brew bars cocktails Honeyed Ginger Ale Wild Turkey American Honey bourbon liqueur ginger beer fresh ginger gingery hurt   But good way    Would back second any beef related cravings  <EOR> Was very disappointed visit

bit over cooked   They forgot sides squash   finally brought but scorched edible   also no utensil serve it   asked person finally brought happened he real attitude   No comes check you   No water refill point fill own glass   Average food best horrible service   many great meals Vegas week soured trip   Move somewhere else  <EOR> I eaten CV several times including hosting business dinner 3 years ago   Vegas past weekend 3 others birthday took CV celebrate   fired previous dinners awesome there   Unfortunately disaster   seated main dining room 9 50 20 min late but no problem   table very strong breeze ice cold directly girls freezing   asked moved next table same issue   fact all tables available same issue   informed all dining rooms linked same HVAC system if moderated main rom then other rooms would warm   anyone heard balancing system   wait staff gave girls chef coats warm them unbearable strapless dress while trying eat   Lets move music   BLASTING loud bad   Some speed metal totally inappropriate nice restaurant   group rock concerts all time music some obscure metal band thunderingly loud   Even staff hated it   told Mario's own play list     Finally lets turn food  buddy split bone ribeye usually favorite   piece meat wasn't just well marbled should but gristly   Tough strands solid gristle ran through meat     All sides cold 5 min due cold win blowing table The whole experience disaster   Only good thing wait staff great except snotty gum chewing hostess   last time spending kind cash crapy experience when many good choices Vegas  <EOR> There many steakhouses Vegas they're mostly backed famed chefs come history can't really wrong  tried couple give props Carnevino being uniquely Italian Steakhouse  means lot other great Italian dishes besides just steak   I've tried Batali's other venture B B which all Italian restaurant which pretty spectacular  Carnevino able deliver part refine italian cuisine yet let end hearty unpretentious piece meat enjoy   We excellent server funny knew Menu very well  Definitely made experience Carnevino even better   The wine list read yellow page   it comprehensive didn't know where begin  if Italian Steak Wine then you've come right place   As delayed review can't remember all names dishes very well  say sure Grilled Octopus must try Beef Cheek Ravioli not Menu good Truffle Pasta seasonal so  I find truffle lacking flavor although homemade pasta superb  Then steak ordered two Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye share great marbling which definitely rock star evening    I would consider steakhouse top 3 favorite steakhouses  back more  <EOR> I really wanted dinner B B but group preferred menu Carnevino   really fan Italian Steakhouse's   would think best both worlds but somehow both sides come short   If want Italian someplace authentic   If want steak somewhere specializes it   dinner good but great definitely didn't equal bill   We started calamari gnocchi bolognese   calamari tender light peppers nice but marinara sauce seemed thick dish   gnocchi good but bolognese didn't seem lot flavor     We weren't original both getting filet which very tender but nothing more would expect steakhouse   would suggest adding sauces dining experience more unique   ordered mixed mushroom spring onion side   pleasantly surprised when severed Fresno peppers added listed menu   couple ordered spinach which also Fresno peppers guessing bunch peppers needed rid of   thrilled didn't heat added   told sides large enough share but pretty sure only if each order side   would recommend everyone order own side then share try different items   Overall dining experience pleasant   service very attentive especially number large groups dining evening   just don't think anything stood spectacular would come back  <EOR> Wonderful experience 2 more enjoy world class protein   definitely spot carnivores if  your thing I'd find other options   Great selection pasta side dishes shared amongst table   But star show carne 2 cut table side   Wonderful dining experience ridiculous wine list  <EOR> I admit its few years since but still fantasize Ribeye  steak never understood big deal until visit its BIG DEAL  steak experience vacation all wrap most incredible meal life  would meal would request if deathrow last meal Dry rub ribeye Peach sorbet  Thank Mario Batali apologies if misspelled your name <EOR> The service best experienced along Fleur de Lys SF food AMAZING  beef tasting menu fantastic  steaks brought table carved flourish  very impressive  wine pairings which very well done  If want very special meal remember place  Special thanks main server Brian! <EOR> They say should very careful pick pocket thieves Spain but never did realize could safer Spain Carnevino Las Vegas  staff puts words your mouth adds services did ask charges anything everything hopes dumb consumer realize hit you  Then once bill automatic gratuity because group 40 people waiter tells $1 800 tip shared tables wait staff begs add additional gratuity them   Soeverything overpriced think heard ask $200 bottles wine when didn't charge $20 per head without telling waiter walk around truffle shaver could on  should really stay far away restaurant can  Deliberately unethical  <EOR> Carnevino fabulous albeit really expensive meal especially if some good selections  brother the hard core foodie knew best steak reservo menu  hanging since late June almost nine months server Jim did fabulous job explaining taste profile  He also suggested pairing more traditional cut both provide contrast cut gamey taste older meat  two cents old stuff great element ham its taste   but  just me  appetizers sides fine but utterly uneventful though steak tartar touch better that  first round cocktails solid but nothing special but first round bartender Cooper came check us  He offered something off menu if gave taste profile  He came back A+ concoction amaro orange bitters orange vodka ginger lemon  Highly recommended!  My only complaint would pacing  $200 person expect pacing 2 hour meal  appetizers coming expressed concern Jim 2 hour meal did fact occur  Without intervention though guessing 1 hr 15 30 minutes which quick restaurant caliber  <EOR> During stay Las Vegas there's only handful restaurants wanted Carnevino them  Unfortunately visit came time where give red meat pork rice lent  Sad know  Why would torture myself going steakhouse dinner? Because pasta serving  Pasta B B didn't meet dietary restrictions off Carnevino go   Dining alone always felt weird Vegas all friends family dining alone big city very alien but sitting bar dinner talking staff made easier me   As much wanted eat ribeye steak can't  ended ordering spaghetti frutti di mare cannoli dessert    They started off offering amuse bouche Parmesan cheese ball fried cheese ball salty savory  Great way start meal off  Then complementary rosemary ciabatta bread 2 spreads butter lardo spread  ciabatta baked perfectly amazing outer crust tasty salty super soft inner bread  goodness could eat bread all day everyday  best variation ciabatta ever ever tasted   The spaghetti frutti di mare delicious  base sauce nicely balanced slightly acidic some heat it  seafood 2 big prawns which size langoustine half lobster clams alot calamari which all cooked perfectly  prawns lobster soft succulent calamari fork tender clams great  real perfect dish  $31 seafood generous   The cannoli gigantic  meant shared  2 big pieces cannoli 2 ice cream sprinkles pistachios  Perfect dessert finish meal   During meal asked if famous 6 month dry aged beef server told no don't but 10 month old dry aged beef   mind 10 months!?!?!

No!

So bottom line waitstaff pretentious dicks truffles huge scam  Other delightful experience food above average quality  Prices high but somewhat worth since food very delicious  <EOR> Great food nice big bar but small portions! know you're fancy restaurant but afford fill when order dinner! <EOR> Not impressed! steak through aging process which claims add flavor steak nothing special  extensive wine bottle list seemingly least expensive $350  service good however would recommend restaurant if you're looking steak Vegas  <EOR> Absolutely Love Carnevino! half dozen times never bad experience  usually enjoy lamb mushrooms mash potatoes   Pass all other restaurants Venetian eat here  Lol    Enjoy! <EOR> It really all preparation   server comes rib eye bone cuts into smaller pieces eaten your plate   bone almost comes flinstones     The rib eye meat only okay definitely could more tender   spinach potato just same level only okay  <EOR> The server fantastic! order filet lunch  Great cut meat! taste being very well marinated but much seasoned  didnt really seem missing anything but leaves option open some salt your coice seasoning  But again bland all  If italian youd fond everything else  humble opinion preferance spinach very garlic ee' strong Veggie  greens taste  potatoes great parmessan crumb crust them very tasty just type potatoes used wouldnt first choice but taste wise okay  Very pricey lunch maybe dinner would more reasonable  loved sparkling water choice DELICIOUS! even extra bottle free two thumbs extra points because super thirsty!!! lol  I dont think Id again unless some wine bar place beautiful very nice feel   The bread butter YUMM!!! <EOR> My family restaurant celebrate father's eightieth birthday because he big fan good beef   prepared pay top dollars good meal   whole dining experience annoying felt horrible being responsible selecting place occasion   We called restaurant ask if arrange birthday cake   some food allergies person answering said would easier bring own   specifically asked if cake cutting fee told wasn't one   When showed cake waiter informed would cake cutting fee   explained phone call he reluctantly stored cake giving hard time   We arrived early evening because guest honor east coast  back dining room empty time except table 10   restaurant playing some rock roll music obnoxiously loud   asked waiter turn music down switch something more pleasant  told could adjust volume music when more guests arrive would noisy anyways   When everyone yell over another open dining room course gets loud   guess having loud rock roll baseline would help ambience     Next comes bread   restaurant selective supplier even know if dairy bread!  We encouraged share meat   Supposedly portions big enough two   definitely say no stuffed when ordered bunch appetizers 4 steaks lamb chops two pasta dishes plus 5 6 side dishes 7 adults 3 kids   waiter assured sufficient food everyone when he took order  don't know kind diners would prefer little food celebratory occasion   Maybe looked skinny stingy but expect waiters classy restaurants give good advice food   The pasta portions small 8 year old ate thing few bites   brother law polite complain but enough kid would fill adult   12 year old niece ordered steak plain because she allergies   wait staff ended giving plain steak wrong person   also ordered some sides done without sauce those also ended wrong side table     The other problem food SLOW   would ordered seconds except waiting another 45 minutes increasingly noisy room would just add annoyance   It supposed joyous occasion   No party good time Carnevino    Safe say won't going back  <EOR> We started seared scallop antipasti which amazing  scallops impeccably fresh cooked perfection  followed white truffle pasta Garganelli porcini trifoliate  truffle pasta simply prepared which allowed truffles shine through  ended La Fiorentina  the porterhouse two see photo  with porcini bernaise sauce  might best steak ever eaten  Perfectly seasoned cooked just right  tender juicy intensely flavorful   So why am subtracting point? Mainly because wine service  list extensive but stratospheric price  very few bottles priced under $100  markup steep  cite but example Antinori Tignanello 2011 listed $260 but K L Wines LA $85 which equals 3x retail markup  Anticipating problem took bottle cellar only faced very steep $50 corkage fee  Turning price service took bottle away open somewhere sight why?   brought back placed farthest away point table couldn't reach bottle without getting hence leaving pouring wait staff's hands    This pet peeve mine  Christopher Hitchens put breathtaking act rudeness     conveys none subtle mercenary message Hurry order another bottle  brought it  bottle  should decide when quickly gets poured  <EOR> This Mario Batali's restaurants Las  Vegas am sure if he served dishes he would find new staff   Went dinner mother week ago while Las Vegas convention   She before enjoyed it   time   Something gone wrong back house   We orered pasta truffles share starter   dish no flavor truffles whatsoever   used dried truffle which might well colored pieces construction paper all flavor held     For entree tuna tartare Meyer lemon   Again total lack flavor   cook Meyer lemons quite bit dish even scent fruit   tuna nicely presented but again lacking flavor     Service friendly but very slow   number servers around nothing should much better   restaurant busy   It seems restaurant changed does cooking trying maximize profit much forgone flavor   prices charge quality meal should MUCH BETTER   When looking place dine end strip avoid Carnevino stick Bouchon same hotel  <EOR> I many high end steak houses Vegas far worst  better steak outback 1 10 price  7 everyone ordered  steak  all shared same comments small portions over priced over cooked tasteless  The only reason am giving 2 stars  wait staff excellent  Do waste your money  <EOR> Worse dining experience family ever had   Music loud couldn't even hear waiter  When asked turn down he said way management liked it   also steered wrong waiter telling order larger portions needed   steaks tasteless tough   If feel dine order appetizer portions   recommend Maggiano's across street   Great service  5 times value flavor less half price  <EOR> I would eat everyday if wallet would allow!

So although waiter s all pushed sell other steaks filet prix fixe menu all very impressed it   Very tasty love outer crust   good!  We all also bottle wine per couple all enjoyed vegetable choice salads gelato oh wow gelato!  In end meal company made great experience!  But when bills came all wrong   vegetable pricing all wrong items mixed each persons bills   should all same except wine pricing take bills back twice couple 3 times other 2   This only drawback try sell let customer decide want! <EOR> We ate dinner tonight say awesome! New York strip which cooked perfectly tasted good! also mascarpone mashed potatoes sauteed mushrooms  delicious! dessert caramel bacon cake which yummy! ate entire thing  Lol  waiter Bryan very professional attentive  definitely visiting again whenever come back Vegas <EOR> Hmmmm more 3 5 but rounding 4 stars because service absolutely fantastic  When sister came weren't sure expect  following When Vegas all mantra decided splurge some Batali fare  New York strip bone sister duck  Both items absolutely delicious  Nevertheless couldn't help but feel if might overpaid meals  royalty corporate inheritance snobs meal might just cost chump change  necessarily case East LA cats  However service staff top notch then some made visit quite comfortable  back? Probably unless win lottery  But hell meal experience  <EOR> 3 5 stars  wanting try Carnevino some time since Mario Batali's food well respected  enjoyed dining experience but price meal don't know if would really recommend restaurant which why decided round down 3 stars  booked Saturday night sat bar area where still order off full menu  ordered Black Fettucine Crab Jalapenos Shallots Main Course Portion $38 Very light tasting could taste sweetness squid ink  pasta tasted fresh but wasn't best pasta had  Overall solid dish but worth $38 upgraded main course portion still TINY!! Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye 2 $144 WOW dish bring over huge piece bone in ribeye carve your table which cool bonus presentation  ordered medium rare came perfect even though server warned might rare side  ribeye tasted good own but adding sauce dip meat would good idea  lot beef around but sure if worth $144   maybe $100 $125 max  Bison Carpaccio Garlic Radish Greens Basil $19 YUM bison sliced super thin meat melts your mouth  must order opinion  Side Roasted Beets w Pistachios Gorgonzola $9 Solid beets nice tender but overall dish didn't work super well together  Strawberry Shortcake w Honey Macerated Strawberries $13 Pretty good but shortcake pieces small didn't think worth $13  Vanilla Bean Affogato Solid affogato   Again although enjoyed most dishes just wasn't wowed  price point portion sizes won't back just many other amazing restaurants eat Vegas! If really love steak would recommend coming try bone in ribeye bison carpaccio long you're prepared damage your wallet  <EOR> I would give place 3 5 star   The food great   place good but expected more price paid!

Calamari shellfish crab salad shellfish another seafood dish   Moreover 5 sets 3  15 appetizers 10 people pasta main dishes come  felt guy trying take advantage us   much food   Also received extra dessert nobody ordered   pointed waiter instead just leaving which typically done fine restaurant considering we're running bill over $2 000 he took dessert away   mean much dick be?  spend over $2 000 you're going take cruddy little dessert off table?  think really says all   On spectrum fine restaurants gets 1 star spectrum all restaurants maybe 2 5 3 stars  None ever eat again best spread word crappy service food place   continue patronize Mario Batali's restaurants because only presume he doesn't know bad place really but if good taste know good service you'll give middle finger Carnevino  <EOR> So last night friend's 30th birthday  Since such big group reduced menu help orders faster  little irritated reduced menu didn't any vegetarian entree alternatives but thats probably friends fault theres  brought full menu unfortunately disappointed fact all pasta's made tomato sauce which fine but really want pasta dish some Alfredo sauce  three courses ok but nothing write home about  admit service really good im sure would again  <EOR> We came lunch during monthly Vegas jaunts  2 words steak sandwich! OMG most delicious sandwich ever eaten  Seriously  boyfriend tried take it!! food really good but sandwich UN freaking believeable! talking last meal earth kinda shit good! Carnevino does right!!   Great salivating now    <EOR> My hunny wanted steak really bad he's wanting try dry aged steak while are top chefs Mario Batali's restaurants  cleaning few tables off sat bar ordered drinks blood orange cosmos which FREAKING GOOD!! called table told close tab bar first  did sat overflow room right across main building  If your being frugal place repeat place  Very expensive but deals people sharing steak  Best thing if wanna save bit money someone agree which type steak both sharing  Don't worry large steak enough  steak deal but everything ala carte  both picked side asparagus mash potato sides each enough two people full meal  But back steak OMGEEEE! DELICIOUS  juicy tender inside slight crisp outside well flavored there's nothing medium cooked steak mmm  potato probably some best ever had   Mascarpone guanciale Italian cheese bacon mashed potatoes  came poached egg top when waiter brought table he popped egg yolk whipped in  Man good  shall return some day   <EOR> Huge disappointment!  Two celebrity chefs equal big flavor right? No such luck   Three words    season your food!  little salt brussel sprouts mushrooms lamb chops would elevated all three dishes    except double lamb chops pure fat! Literally could slice off enough meat small bite    which would okay if hadn't paid price farm meal wine!

Exceptional  prices pretty steep we ended paying $300 2 people but lifetime experience  steak hugeee mushroom pasta tiny but die for  service outstanding  <EOR> HAPPY FAT    The operative words come mind when hear name Mario Batali  Sadly overpriced lackluster fare Carnevino only made latter! But disclaimer quite while since visit hopefully they've made some improvements since then    Located Palazzo Carnevino semi failed go  While maintains top notch customer service decadent chic decor expected high end Vegas establishment ambience marred raucous sound Beastie Boys blarring stereo system  neccessarily opposed them but likes Intergalatic  Sabatoge didn't jive well scale environment     The menu sneaky too  watch out! Case point prices listed pastas range $17 $31 however appetizer portions only  additional $15 needs tacked entree size  Also steak two listed $72 but $72 PER PERSON making whopping $144   steak legitimately worth much wouldn't eating should plated precious metals embedded Swarvoski crystals   We ended ordering Bison Carpaccio Fried Calamari appetizers 16 oz bone in New York strip Grilled Sweetbreads Pork Milanese  Pretty much all main courses failed establishment boasts the highest quality excellently prepared steaks seriously expecting more chewy bland New York strip served  appetizers actually pretty good I'd recommend getting Bison Capaccio  But other highlights meal complimentary cheese puffs bread w butter peppered lard    Needless say sad way start trip Vegas  Luckily night debauchery XS later night made it  Two stars! <EOR> Delish!

No problems service    They try steer towards more expensive entrees the meats which kinda off putting saying pasta eaten main basically telling should order if want order starter pasta only thanks! thing if you're informing guest portion sizes whatever but phrase way vs telling people order    The bread butter tallow give start delicious maybe favorite thing! mashed potatoes egg yolk bacon very impressive looking but sure added anything already creamy potatoes    All all can't wrong some antipasti petite filet! <EOR> What joke  must preface review saying accustomed eating restaurants where prices high need mortgage your house just dinner  But vacationing Vegas large group friends where wanted eat  gave shot!  One quick glance menu knew going break bank  took moment map game plan decided ordering ravioli plus side item wallet wouldn't take much beating  wife also alarmed prices decided order gnocchi side item quick recap little wine we're way over $100 point  ouch My first red flag should when waiter pointed ravioli actually raviol o singular just piece ravioli hell? scratched head  $25 1 ravioli?? price must wrong must huge delicious giant thick piece ravioli  asked waiter describe hands he made rather large circle  assumed would decent sized dish  OK order it   HA! 45 minutes later yes 45 minutes served tiniest thinnest smallest ravioli ever seen  roughly size thickness ritz cracker  1 cracker  $25!!

ROYALTY TREATMENT! 3 times  always order family style   Perfect way try all different exquisite plates  am lucky food critics circle friends  Believe place everything  Menu available online  <EOR> Mario Batali's place Palazzo just ok   Mario's careful   Some places awesome but he risks becoming sort celebrity chef joke   Carnevino supposed Italian style steakhouse maybe fault meal average because didn't order any beef   All signs pointed toward excellent meal when started basket excellent bread always good indicator   continued encouraged through app course gnocchi bolognese   But when entrees came little off track   pork cutlet brown butter bland could've used some salt maybe some herbs sage?    dining companions noted parpadelle looked and tasted almost exactly gnocchi started with   buddy's saltimboca excellent though   ultimate indicator skipped dessert expectations appropriately lowered   I bet if Mario actually paying attention coming kitchen name would much better  <EOR> Our server CarneVino fairly rude  group four ordered two entrees 4 appetizers small plates dessert couple glasses wine  He did seem fact weren't all ordering 3 course meals sharing everything   He definitely acted snooty it   he realized weren't going crazy gorging ourselves food basically ignored entire night flag down if needed anything   However bus boy runners hostesses all great   When finally bill stated suggested gratuity 20%   No matter awesome service don't think should put bill let alone when bad service!  especially off putting when you're already generous tipper begin with   The food good but unfortunately did service would recommend going restaurant   all other options Vegas could definitely great food great service elsewhere  <EOR> Went during honeymoon chef's tasting menu   real treat   Beef cheek ravioli touch 200 year old balsamic vinegar   recommended preparation everything rare   server extremely friendly did great job guiding through several courses meal   If your budget tight could share order wine pairing along tasting menu   pours generous enough share each course   My only regret show tickets Jersey Boys immediately following little rushed   error though timing   Learn mistake leave yourself plenty time enjoy  <EOR> REVIEW VEGANS  Duh know smart steakhouse when vegan  LOL  But group omnivores where wanted gonna do?

Steak tartare pasta course course aged ribeye did aged Porterhouse hey Vegas say   Excellent cuts excellent flavor melted your mouth     To those complainers price seriously?  expecting pay quality service atmosphere?  buffet <EOR> possibly 4 5 stars  extremely enjoyable experience all around  fresh shaved truffle galore   am true believer Mario Batalio visiting both B B most recently CarneVino  <EOR> If wasn't winning big poker night before would ended Delmonico instead CarneVino where nickel dime everything  experience Pizzeria Mozza knew better order Coke for $5  But did expect every sauce additional $5  understand good steak doesn't need frills sauce but just thought funny even lamb optional $5 mint sauce  Another example crazy costs $22 appetizer pasta   right pasta appetizer haha  additional $15 entrée  Whatever Batali win  You're food still fantastic  Every bite food perplexes mind even bread delicious peppered lard turned pretty good  Highlights night + + appetizer Black Fettuccine crab jalapeno shallots wow amazing dish + entrée Bone in New York Strip + side Broccoli pork hot peppers if only pork its own dish yum!

If fan real Italian food place   know known steaks however ordered lots small stuff lasted REAL AMAZING!!! can't wait place again      very highly recommended pricy small portions but deserve every penny pay <EOR> The Riserva most glorious piece meat you'll ever put your mouth   challenge even all sluts *gobble gobble* very fortunate porterhouse edition  WTF seriously? Super rich intense flavor hint blue cheese note truffle Rod U  put best umame  However filet side T bone just much though  only able piece   Most steaks aged 30 60 days but Riserva could aged anywhere 6 11month!! You'll never taste anything it   Chances won't available but demand anyways!   Dry Aged Steaks time process two things changed meat  Moisture evaporates muscle which creates greater concentration beefy flavor   Secondly enzymes break down muscle tissue result you're left more tender beef   Keep mind aging process require lots space also time consuming  mention significant weight reduction beef therefor many steak house offering approach     *tip* If you're lucky off menu item request sliced up  way don't rush eat beef's oily texture turns kind waxy rather quickly  If you're sharing them distribute meat evenly among your friends     Not into all jazziness??  Dry Aged Ribeyes exquisite own rights   All steaks rubbed sea salt black pepper fresh rosemary prior cooking nice thin char  However Riserva cooked neighboring broilers prevent crusting   Steaks then cut table side before serving dressed little olive oil dash maldon salt     Whatever choose keep mind going heavy meal pick your sides apps accordingly   fact skip appetizers bread offering salted butter bacon butter all together   Just straight goods some sides Mascarpone Guanciale Mashed Potatoes  every 2 people highly encourage your party split serving meat   if you're still hungry that?? L'America!!! <EOR> Came friends' recommendations  very good  Two things stood out 1  Beet salad  love beet salad order frequently  think their's best beet salad ever had  simply perfection   2  Steak  bone in NY strip  very good but thought just tiny notch below Cut Delmonico's steaks   In any case loved experience  beautiful restaurant  Service great  Would definitely back  <EOR> This steakhouse definitely fell short expectations  general dishes under seasoned just lacked wow factor would expect celebrity chefs price  braised short rib which would qualify least favorite short rib dishes ever had  dry purée served over just clashed  No mean but better short ribs Delta Airlines  Maybe just caught them off night but don't think we'll going back give them second chance  PS  B B should spend less time tv little more time restaurant  sure would agree assessment served us  <EOR> Exceptional service wonderful food excellent sommelier  Don't reservation before 5 00 as did Sunday before early show you'll seated bar very limited menu left came back later   The appetizers pasta just good steak which delicious  Sides extremely basic bit disappointing  Obviously great place bring vegetarian  <EOR> Probably most disappointing $500 meal a group 6 ever had   1   FIVE girls hostess station when approached somehow still took them while find reservation   asked friend whose name under spell last name least 2 3 times  Whatever    2    steaks which supposed star offering CARNEvino let down   First OVERCOOKED which even more atrocious given waiter when ordered emphasized temperatures grade two cooler normal   Both guys ordered steaks ordered them medium rare which according waiter rare other places  FALSE  Both steaks well side medium   Although dry aged steaks did didn't enough flavor stand own weren't seasoned all   If you're going charge $50 $85 per person piece beef better top quality perfectly cooked  neither   $35 steak strip mall Fresno much better see Cracked Pepper Bistro     3    pasta another disappointment   Four pasta   Another girl both pasta lamb ragu frutti di mare lobster ravioli   lamb ragu good but touch salty definitely $35 quality   could probably something similar home   lobster ravioli bad friend rest taste just experience bad was   0 01 ounce stringy fishy lobster somehow bland over salted same time   manager nice enough take off bill   friend frutti de mare seemed love entree   Sadly he only one     4    late dinner reservation 10pm   Obviously busy   Somehow meal still took 3 HOURS   How? Why?   Probably only better meh part meal steak tar tar friend appetizer   delicious   quality food would expect while paying prices    In summary Mario Batali never set foot restaurant he doesn't deserve Iron Chef  <EOR> The Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye outstanding  <EOR> Amazing food but bring your appetite! tried 5 appetizers highly recommend crab salmon crudo but all stellar  ribeye incredible lamb chops! Desert Tiramisu topped off excellent meal  600 wines choose Batali outdone himself CarneVino  <EOR> This place overpriced meat taste popcorn seemed just wanted two fast possible public nasty smell <EOR> I've Las Vegas 11 times  understand appreciate opportunity reservations high end restaurants else don't seated    I made reservation gave cc over phone week advance dinner Tuesday night 4   We showed table said would bit because don't room   fact multiple other parties awaiting 8pm reservations stand waiting past 8 30   This unacceptable   made reservations 4 more 6 days advance flew Las Vegas special dinner stand   Hungry 30 minutes past confirmed time staff did care   weren't even phased situation if normal occurrence   This okay    I eaten here   point might never give them business  made reservations called confirmed day then when showed no tables ate elsewhere   Thank spoiling reservation Carnevino   Thank you  <EOR> Ok didn't eat but did sit bar few drinks appetizer   steak tartare best ever had   only complaint reason knock down few stars price   ordered bourbon neat   bartender suggest two ounce shot Pappy Van Winkles's reserve   Now consider myself connoisseur  bourbon but I'd never heard PVW's said why not   Freakin $55 per shot?

Only followed article really happened Mario's sexual allegations hit streets yesterday    Since received no response email complaints any staff decided ahead post yelp   Update last experience Carnevino   heard back management Carnevino apologized happened 10th Anniversary event refunded money   appreciate very much return Carnevino dine again  <EOR> I've three separate occasions every time come seems better better  way seem think place its simply prepared food but done right  Its probably most accurate description but mean its many different flavors seasoning added food yet its simple ingredients such salt pepper used draw natural flavors steaks other meals   The wine list pretty decent sommelier seems pretty knowledgeable  last time sommelier recommended bottle French Cru something loyal Napa Valley wine drinkers would rarely do  liked lot though we'd say he made good choice  Good overall service well  never wait long anything always feel pretty well taken care here   One absolute favorite dishes anywhere recent memory steak carpaccio  honest exactly sure perhaps some type raw meat maybe its better don't know  But all know really good! I'd definitely recommend it   I almost always order filet mignon steakhouses Carnevino no exception  medium no blood probably more overcooked true meat eater prefers but think steak perfect here  over seasoned just done right  definite must mashed potatoes side dish  sure name but its potato dish where add egg your table  probably raised cholesterol level but worth it!  The only weak point noticed restaurant desserts  However usually pretty full dessert anyway doesn't bother much but bit let down  specifically remember panna cotta some sort date cake both merely okay paled comparison rest meal  desserts little bland me  However don't think fathom deducting star since rest meal more it  <EOR> Great place!!! Had dinner 8 people great time  Pretty much asked each beef dish bring out  Of steaks presented cut front thought all great  Well maybe filet want good hoped  The wait staff excellent blast!!! <EOR> There steak houses all over Las Vegas but none better this  ribeye aged 90 120 days!   long time folks  gonna cost but worth it  Then pastas  Freshly made each morning your Italian grandmother would proud call own  yourself favor grab couple hundred bucks eat tonight  <EOR> We just returned week Vegas where year round healthy eating exercise window culinary tour Strip   Carnevino ended being more expensive meals which understand Vegas together good food good wine comes price but case price did match experience!   This third time Carnevino though looking forward most ended being worst three times here  We began drinks husband beer Sommelier recommendation ended truly fabulous wine! decor wasbeautiful service attentive though devoid any personalization  music through perhaps odd many given formal setting great Soundgarden!  Food however spectacular ! Oysters began good but surpassed those Table 10 Morels Bouchon even Public House   husband four course tasting menu beginning Steak Tartare followed pasta aged steak finally Tiramisu   He enjoyed but noted heavily rubbed distracting meat certainly winner trip!   I lobster joke!! Smal over cooked rubbery served its own no butter no taste ! Charge more good good!   Sides good previous visits spinach which enjoyed past left slightly salty! potatoes other hand bland    The tiramisu many others Vegas deconstructed put glass gelato taking place traditional coffee soaked lady fingers! Personally standard tiramisu hit cocoa being better cocoa nibs! If ended being left!   The biggest problem service smooth well executed but almost robotic! little personality turn good meal into great meal   Service again surpassed every other restaurant ate exception  Otto Enoteca which funnily enough another Batalli establishment   It just okay but considering most expensive meals supposed both food service several other Venetian restaurants  sure back <EOR> First seated across hall cigarette smoke filled room   then asked move seated main room  much nicer no smoke   Then car sales man guy talked fast didn't understand specials   Almost all food salty  Steak good other high end steak houses Peter Luger Primehouse Grill 23 DK Steakhouse Hys   <EOR> It really best experience service spot on food really impressive   I Manhattan which perfectly sweet front manly kickback   Table bread rosemary ciabatta served seasoned lard which never before almost sucked down entire little pot it   Bison carpaccio goddamn astounding albeit bit small two share but could fine just one   Of course filet side porterhouse lot softer strip side good eat strip side first finish filet   They leave bone table if you're inclined scrape down really soft red goodness     OH potatoes? ricotta poached egg? could drank milkshake   We skipped dessert  didnt want wash flavoring aftertaste 8 months dry age  just kicked back enjoyed assy taste back own teeth while    I absolutely returning  <EOR> If steak wine just here   know dine   some best steaks Vegas staff courteous pleasant   taken several people return many times when am Vegas   If he puts LA definately problem  <EOR> No offense but came bachelorette party 8 some fine dining  yes while good food wasn't worth almost $600 tab especially when alcohol wasn't even involved   We share Fruiti di Mare Spaghetti $31 your basic sea food red sauce pasta  nice inclusions lobster bites  PAPPARDELLE 'porcini trifolati' $22 appetizer portion $37 dinner portion good but just good less appetizer price   Here's doosie Bone Ribeye 2 WATCH PRICE list $72 but really $72 x 2 = $144 large ribeye steak Porterhouse 2 again same tricky pricing wording list $80 but really $80 x 2 = $160 large porterhouse   I'll honest ribeye porterhouse steaks tasted good but NO steak should cost $160 unless encased gold  Seriously ridiculous  I don't even want bother telling sides dessert ordered because end outrageousness steak prices boggles mind   the food service fine  but telling everyone now save your money somewhere else  just good any other place still money gamble  <EOR> Worst dining experience LONG time 40th birthday dinner well night before     rushed appetizers steaks table 20 min ordering cook steak quickly brother's $50 pasta bland he sent back took waiter 15 min return menu order something else he declined point   DUMB manager smug pompous I don't know he almost looking down complaining more once   brother brought very fine expensive bottle wine even sommellier impressed with  waived $50 corkage fee big whoop!

However he took stride when ordered only some he recommended    The meal started some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes which small bite very savory tasty well bread basket choice butter lardo spread top which thought nice touch    To start grilled octopus two salads  enjoyed arugula salad triple cream cheese but other starters memorable  also ribeye which yummy but honest nothing special compared other steakhouses both expensive more affordable  also weren't super impressed pastas black fettucine crab gnocchi orrechiette sausage broccoli  all fine but definitely memorable I just look menu website recall ordered! honest highlight meal side mashed potatoes ordered which comes poached egg some sort bacon type meat  indulgent rich!

delicate handmade pasta accompanying filling    other three party filet mignon  perfectly cooked order  mashed potatoes accompanied poached egg mixed table surprisingly underseasoned   simply missing appropriate amount salt  They bring your own cute little dish sea salt if request    table mates ordered fingerling potatoes which bit underwhelming    If again would've another side   finished night peanut butter chocolate torte which divine   waiter came back over inform manager comped dessert well   Service impeccable someone food industry over decade noticed all those tiny but important

Then asked brussel sprouts he told ordered broccoli which definitely ordered  point things looking good Carnevino seemed comedy errors  server then came told he put grilled octopus he would comp which unnecessary but appreciated   Finally ate food      all forgiven  orecchiette great little small portion especially while splitting between two people but great flavor  steak well cooked excellent taste  did taste ravioli but heard no complaints either  While eating brought grilled octopus completely worth wait  tasted amazing  three people never octopus reluctant try but badgered them give taste all three equally loved it   Despite serving snafu's actual meal very pleasing  server did atone any mistakes he may made throughout meal  don't know if would return due all eating options Palazzo Venetian but would recommend others give try taste octopus very least  <EOR> Overall 3 5 stars rounded down 3 stars because unjustified price mark up   A note price Things definitely more expensive Las Vegas   While annoying try let affect much review since paying more LV comes territory   being said cost slightly more needed even mark hence rounded down review   place most expensive steak ever had   This definitely nice restaurant  type place come occassion   Jackets aren't required but want look nice white table cloth type place   The food good   ordered 12 oz filet which came cooked specifications medium    Often found places err side going rare tastes but place cooked steak right   meat size baseball  delicious baseball   The side dishes good  potato dishes broccoli side   Both good but portion sizes SMALL   server said side dish would feed two people but case all   Basically side dish per person each runs around $12   I mint infused manhattan beverage great   nice take classic beverage mint gave nice refreshing flavor   Service nice friendly though little skimpy bread   basically keep asking bread   say?  love bread   A nice experience but money better deals Vegas  <EOR> Just know if review help traveled world eaten some very expensive restaurants   Paris San Francisco Rome Maui  etc    am foodie   great experience   beef cheek ravioli balsamic drizzle appetizer great  Not menu but waiter told it   Ribeye steak flavorful very tender  mashed potatoes egg bacon cheese just great    Service great   come again  Ate delmonico's well but meal better   Just experience trip  Good luck  Otto yes Buddy v no delmonico's  yes Carnevino yes <EOR> Loved loved loved  Carnevino!

I talking couple next made same observation   trouble finishing steak split   I ordered pork chop Milanese style lacked dark crusty fried outside prefer   meat good overcooked but under flavored    Instead chopped arugala green salad braised fennel topping very sparse grape tomato halves    Again miss prefer flavorful greens more tomatoes   dish because don't need order salad usually topping along shaved Parm  usually fills bill but topping disappointed   The butter served bread great but bread itself reminded bread serve Italy    good but lacking salt    bland other words   The house Fruilino Bastinich very good   The bar area lively     walk all way back    the beauty restaurant hidden back   Also word tall bartender    if someone asks ice water serve ice   America ice ice water   don't frown if single person isn't ordering sides   Your menu geared large parties  <EOR> Carnevino early restaurants bookmarked Yelp 2011!

BUT     There whole slew things into making establishment crave worthy   food main selling point if Carnevino relied solely merits its culinary crafts would 5 star store  Unfortunately them world does revolve around well cook steak prepare meal rather teeters points atmosphere service price value experience   Carnevino excels food but fails quite miserably other parts    It expensive  While steak very good don't think worth $75+ price tag  alcohol OBNOXIOUSLY overpriced atleast 20%  If plan drinking sure bring extra cash! Very very expensive alcohol    The atmosphere way off fine dining  ate steak while Black Sabbath background  loud music  Ozzy Osbourne great musician but he didn't music pair 16oz dry aged New York Strip  Needless say didn't well steak actually detracted dining experience   top allow loud drunk customers  Yes know Vegas but come on   give $250 meal some respect     Then service   waiters attentive but definetly trained selling   Some subtle which natural totally fine but waiter pushed additional alcohol purchases dessert very hard  Annoyingly hard    I return price doesn't match value many reasons  very high quality food cannot Carnevino's skewed experience obnoxious atmosphere pushy service  <EOR> BEYOND AMAZING!!! sorry but if remember your server's name any restaurant absolutely terrific night   server Brayden he absolutely terrific server   He didn't rush when debating wine trust took 45 minutes decide even help master sommelier Michael   wine list incredibly beautiful look though wallet bank account cried prices   But found beautiful Henry Fessy Beaujolais $60 which incredibly delectable!

metal Mario Batali's choice playlist destroys conversation mood  Fine kitchen grossly disruptive dining room  also distinctive lack intimacy dining room soaring ceilings la Italian castle then seated near empty dining room away against wall near bathroom made feel dungeon  I called ahead 2 requests since special occasion neither we're fulfilled   asked 2 bottles champagne iced ready table toast husbands name added Happy Birthday prescripted plate    Didn't happen    <EOR> Horrible service wife sat bar 5 00 pm busy all maybe 4 customers bar  totally ignored bartenders talking among themselves dis further water left 20 minutes no service  <EOR> Me sweetie Carnevino anniversary because good steak Mario favorite celebrity chefs  delighted experience  greeted staff wished happy anniversary seated right time reservation   We calamari mozzarella appetizers which great  mozzarella salty sweet perfectly prepared bone rib eye 2 amazing beautiful crust but perfectly medium rare inside   I asked server pick glass red wine steak instead just giving most expensive red he gave moderately priced red complemented steak perfectly   The staff way occasion special each server helped wished happy anniversary fruit tart desert happy anniversary written across top plate   This easily best anniversary dinner simply best meals 8 years together  would recommend restaurant anyone looking celebrate something just looking really great steak  <EOR> Had high hopes one   know doubt Yelp folks further proof stay away places mixed reviews especially when your target restaurant pricey   Not food related Initially sommelier suggested three stock wines which thought strange bit embarrassing him   Second music loud could barely carry conversation another   Additionally while playing AC DC during dinner probably cute edgy idea Mario corporate found strange disjointed especially when looking demographics patrons  observed several walk offs because music   waiters said common occurrence only happens more frequently night switch hardcore rap seriously    The most annoying part experience incessant walk note taking hostess staff   Apparently keeping close tabs where diners meal process   Food related We started calamari which flavored nicely but bit soggy time arrived   Amuse bouche cheese fritters but also cold    Split 2 inch reserve rib eye friend which close expected but sure worth $108 per inch   total steak 22 24 ounces   95% steak great perfect super dry aged steak flavor but meat close bone acrid   wife filet which just OK   porcini blue cheese sauces both gloppy bland   The most disappointing part centered around side dishes   mashed potato mascarpone egg yolk just flat bland   Boiled newspaper would more flavor   house special Brussels sprouts much lemon them eating sour patch candy   three people finish two small side dishes speaks volumes  <EOR> If looking exceptional culinary experience give place try   If budget don't bother coming here   Food really steakhouse guy   nice grill excellent butcher all cuts think of     until now   Appetizers wow highly recommend grilled octopus tender hard time believing octopus   Duck egg wonderfully prepared full
