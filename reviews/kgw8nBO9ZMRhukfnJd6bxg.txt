Food very good steak Steak Salad leather Italian sub mediocre   could use help   $17 personal pizza worth it  Clams good  rush food although place beautiful might stop bar future  Expected better renowned restaurant! Hope take note! <EOR> The restaurant very lovely! Love cellar  The food wasn't Amazing anything special  price pretentious that's opinion   served some bread butter completely melted please keep your butter refrigerated    None cocktails attracted asked waiter if bartender could prepare me A cocktail made pear vodka splash sprite St Germain liquor slice lime  did THANK YOU  Service excellent great selection wines Conveniently located heart downtown Summerlin  <EOR> I read reviews knew expect  But really did high hopes place  loved feel place  romantic setting    To start hour half wait  Which really wasn't all bad because you're mall! actually down Crave few drinks bar  When came back basically time seated    Took 15 minutes just water  Once waiter came ordered right away because almost sure food going take forever  actually didn't  Food came reasonable amount time  thing didn't friends cocktail she ordered  30 minutes finally told didn't particular drink  Then she wanted beer which came already done food    I ordered Filet Oscar  meat medium rare  Nope well done be! meat sitting mashed potatoes crab top meat topped asparagus which everything swimming sauce  honestly whole dish nothing special  $38 really hoped would Amazing  dish came Caesar salad which also bland  know just salad but basically no dressing    The beau seared ahi tuna which he clearly enjoyed devoured  dish looked real pretty!   I probably come back location  would probably try other location because wine flights over but one  <EOR> LOUD INSIDE Spaghetti sauce shall say water side pasta House salad tasteless which lettuce whatever hard    DID SAY LOUD INSIDE? Main dish chicken parm over soggy spinach but chicken flatten hard chew add ton burnt gooey cheese  Okay service good give them much waiter   And LOUD INSIDE <EOR> Decided last minute come dinner seeing movie  restaurant rustic trendy cozy but bit noisier expected  seated 5 minutes waiter finally came absentmindedly plopped someone else's check front us  He quickly realized mistake spent good few minutes laughing off didn't really mind it   I some sparkling wine husband ordered listed pinot noir but waiter said he does recommend steered towards higher priced pinot  When brought wine waiter claimed he remembered serving particular wine last visit  Odd  Since just told few minutes ago never restaurant before  husband ordered veal parmigiana which decent portion tender tasty  just mussels red sauce appetizer  standard but only six pieces   When asked check made joke waiter having bring check next table  He said he couldn't some long winded anecdote some other table paid someone else's meal  OK he also forgot he gave someone else's check earlier  point convinced waiter suffering short term memory loss    The verdict food wine alright while odd server interactions left scratching heads  <EOR> First visit DTS Grape Street' Most outstanding smiles over top service received bar  decided meal rather move table!

My boyfriend Greek salad loved it! He said very light refreshing    If place top service game would given them 5 stars!   Side note wifi pretty weak but noticed everywhere downtown Summerlin  <EOR> Wow   what tremendous disappointment food!! Even bread given sit down good!! tasted old stale!! higher expectations place    I ordered Orange Chicken Chinese Salad strange salad bombarded way many crushed wontons!! felt resembled eating bowl Kellogg's Corn Flakes without milk!!! Also hardly any chicken explains excess crushed wontons few miniature cubes diced chicken tasted frozen chicken breast microwaved   bland boring!! salad also roasted red bell peppers some pieces crunchy raw other pieces mushy if came straight jar marinated olive oil!! haven't roasted red bell peppers Chinese chicken salad before!! adding excuse Italian twist because restaurant's food theme Italian    very bizarre!!   My friend ordered Black Salmon salad very good!! should instead!! drinks although well made size glass way small charge  larger size drink Vegas strip same price Grape Street charges drinks!!  Due beautiful ambiance good service saving grace friend's Black Salmon Salad give Grape Street another chance  just sure steer clear very strange Italian wannabe Orange Chinese Chicken Salad!! <EOR> Servers bus boys eating counter  Using hands washing them after  know mother saw waitress lick fingers doing job   Hitting each other hugging each other  employee came shift walked over bread warmer  touched multiple beads hands choose eat    Didn't wash hands   Even though tongs right counter   Spoke manager  sure if he really listening  All happening within eyesight   Hope he keeps better eye out  staff seems more control management   may try again few months   See if experience changed  <EOR> Went first time date wife  server while apologetically cannot remember name fantastic  Bread Pudding Profiteroles we mood dessert    Also couple cups coffee   first round coffee cold server brought fresh cups hot coffee them comped off bill   desserts delectable highly recommend bread pudding difficult just right but Grape Street Cafe nailed it   wife rather enjoyed dessert well which basically cream puffs steroids way more flavor   Great ambiance look forward heading back dinner  Five stars thanks Grape Street  <EOR> This favorite restaurant wine bar  place could anything lower 5 Stars beyond me  living Vegas 6 years go to spot!! gfs luv place favorite server Nick  He's fabulous! Great spot eat before movie while shopping date  Great location  food!!!!! always stuffed shrimp appetizer blackened salmon salad   Luv wine bar feel there's always classy crowd  more casual hipster cheaper restaurants area but Grape Street more scene  never anywhere else if downtown Summerlin  taken all friends mad when without me  Lol  spot!! <EOR> I came Summerlin blind date restaurant I'd never strength some YELP reviews  met seated outside beautiful August night where met most pleasant courteous waiter took drink orders returned promptly both cocktails witty banter  He gave ample time talk never felt rushed put orders food  starters decided charcuterie platter baked Brie which arrived puff pastry which included apricot preserves  Yum  Before time delve into main menu already decided second date Grape Street also  Wish could say more but happens Summerlin     <EOR> I just ate resturant good  service amazing  When ordering told waiter going terry fator hour he told enjoy show  recommend eating here  <EOR> Reason star service  Although food great server took 45 minutes take order    45 MINUTES!!!  more understanding if truly busy they're low servers but wasn't case  server back house whole time managed show only fill drinks other tables but ours  When he finally managed take orders no acknowledgement fact took 45 minutes take food orders  Totally unacceptable!  If decide come back believe bar probably work best someone more attentive    don't usually write yelp reviews but experience compelled start account write want place succeed high hopes regular place  <EOR> I 4 colleagues expected all wines great but took 4 tries right! expected wine amazing but even wine enthusiast friend found Pinot noir subpar Besides appetizers excellent including tuna carpaccio calamari cheese charcuterie plate  Chilean sea bass accompanying spinach very flavorful its soy based sauce  I would return but hope restaurant improves its wine selection! <EOR> I'd say would give Grape Street Café similar review did other located Lake Mead Boulevard  food very good but yet again service very slow  waited 20 minutes slice cheesecake  would nice place if time kill you're big rush  appetizer entrée dessert hour half  <EOR> This more comparison between Grape Street Cafe downtown Summerlin Grape Vine Cafe Buffalo Lake Mead    going Grape Vine years back when used Grape Street    staple lunch steak salad meat cooked chef's recommendation which usually medium medium rare      Today ventured downtown Summerlin quickly ordered same thing   Let tell Grape Street's version average best   summarize dislikes 1 Quality meat lacking   tougher steak seasoning lacked any flavor  2 much blue cheese   don't mind blue cheese however no need excessive amount placed salad    3 quantity meat much less place Buffalo Lake Mead  4 bread hard   crust bread very crunchy    soft fresh normally is    5 meat overcooked unless chef recommends steak cooked well done which seems odd      In summary if heading lunch two options would recommend original different name   Grape Vine Cafe much tastier fancier brother  <EOR> How does place 3 star average? people?
