When received food hot NO taste really did live would any other Johnny Rockets!   Save your money head over Dairy Queen your burger fix!! <EOR> The hamburgers fried very thin if pressed down griddle would fill bun   Both hamburgers BLTs seemed very dry   While retro hamburger restaurants pass Johnny Rockets now on  <EOR> Place gross!! few places open late @ luxor food court  disgusting  Frozen microwaved breakfast   AVOID <EOR> I mean guy Jason legit best person yo working here!! cheeks sunshine your morning he best!!!! <EOR> Meat no flavor  Needs seasoning  Meal very pricey  $20 single patty burger fries drink  sh*@ttin me???

Les frites sont très bonnes   Mais ce n'est cependant pas le meilleur Hamburger que nous ayons mangé durant notre séjour à Vegas  <EOR> To honest received food but two people two burgers two fries two waters $37   serve myself  very likely return next visit  <EOR> The hamburger okay It bit greasy hard edges  fries dirty could taste oil them its time change it  beverages good  butterfinger shake made meal  creamy thick  tasted great  Hopefully rest food rise standard  <EOR> Had lunch couple days ago service slow at register wait while longer food but absolutely delicious   never received onion rings they said they'd bring them out   finished meal   manager gave note bring back free onion ring free meal   just stopped compt entire lunch we only ordered 2 burgers 1 onion rings ice water    We're very pleased way took care us!!

Unfortunately took almost 20 minutes food definitely took away bit  Still worth skipping Golden Arches for! <EOR> Stopped late night snacks twice during trip Vegas  eaten restaurant many times although location  cheese burger meal good always  Only problem cannot tater tots meal instead fries   they need change policy  staff very pleasant Bertha awesome  <EOR> Absolute junk spending $13 burger without anything extra then two additional burgers son daughter think joke guy would spend $35 place drink water five stars thank you <EOR> Food good moderate wait  Ordered bacon burger fries drinks separate $14 plus Patty didn't much flavor <EOR> Way over priced !

Never regret it  <EOR> Love Much wouldve give 5 stars but burger small before   wonder why! <EOR> I found place inside Excalibur Hotel Johnny Rockets exact same menu Breakfast Burgers which upstairs food court  Definitely false advertisement don't think lot people catching this  definitely know food Johnny Rocket it  Trust me  <EOR> Johnny rockets just okay place looks nice but price over price don't meal combo price plus food pretty messy friends could probably better burger  <EOR> We've many Johnny Rockets worst  service awful  small stack pancakes size sausage patty seven dollars  don't mind paying but when they're reheated hard old problem  location needs serious update service food gives bad reputation franchise  <EOR> Got sweet potato fries staying hotel   fries tasted donuts couldn't figure why didn't taste sweet potato fries but sweet donuts   well  because Krispy Kreme donuts well  am sweet lover but bad combination flavors   The next few days busy two days later returned refund fries  server told no should called right away returned fries  supposed save fries carry them down 19 stories elevator order believe me    Lesson learned read reviews before eating anywhere  <EOR> First off $7 TWO DRINKS?! Smh   Breakfast bland much choose from  Staff uninterested   Thought would better alternative buffet Luxor but wrong  Still overpriced definitely good all  <EOR> Great Burger spot inside Excalibur! But think worth expensive price? jury may still because say prices charging know some un named competitors give them run money same prices if lower! But flip side located strip inside casino expensive prices come territory! meal came $22 burger mixed fries onion rings drink! Would return? Maybe    <EOR> Worst service  Ordered shake sat 20 minutes until asked if ready yet then gave us    seriously?! <EOR> Mediocre best  logo says The Original Hamburger but think should check Louis' Lunch New Haven Connecticut that! <EOR> There no secret why place only 2 stars average  Excalibur needs tell jokers shape ship out  disservice customers Excalibur keep franchise inside casino  expensive far burgers yes Vegas expensive but give money's worth  am complaining because effing burger buns stone cold when served  burger patty OK  why still gave 2 stars but enjoy burger if buns grilled steamed made warm way other? Just burgers fries drinks two guys cost nearly $35? Vegas could eaten more grand manner Orleans other places even Grimaldi's pizza Venetian  coming back all  <EOR> What   the   hell? pretty sure only smiles moment leave  Considering isn't traditional Johnny Rockets format meaning walk counter order no waiter price outrageous  ordered two burgers fries two waters $36!   The fries rock hard tasted old grease  give them added star having decent burger but even menu weird compared regular old school Johnny Rockets    Kinda sad price could eaten real sit down chain  Sheesh    <EOR> Horrible   Chicken breast could supplied rubber plant   Service disinterested overall disappointment   When Excalibur spend extra time money head over Dicks Last Resort better meal fun time  <EOR> The food okay  Overpriced but least there's unlimited soda refills  <EOR> The only good thing say experience clean  However service beyond slow  waited over 20 minutes burnt food  prices aren't particularly great even Vegas  Save yourself trouble move food court  <EOR> Went dinner last night  Wow worst food terrible service rude workers  am very unimpressed  took20 minutes cold dry food worst all $72 34 4 basic meals drink  VERY DISAPPOINTED <EOR> Absolutely sad  ready awesome burger  NOPE!!!!
