Why yes am   Other good place cool off sun <EOR> I love some Pepe's Tacos  Tacos full meat menudo really good  Service always friendly open all time  Super convenient salsa pretty good  especially love switch music spanish song then english song song  boyfriend white when walked music changed  Obviously purpose but still super funny  haha  Love place  <EOR> When you're hungry 1am quick spot some Mexican food  However because am gluten free pescatarian left very unsatisfied food itself  customer service plaint she knew exactly suggest when mentioned don't eat meat gluten  cashier suggested breakfast tacos scrambled eggs beans cheese  She mentioned she wouldn't able them but she could give ingredients so  eggs came cold corn tortillas thick steamed which didn't good taco  All all cold bland soggy tortilla disappointment  also cleaning Horchaga time bummer well but can't fault them that  <EOR> I'm only judging one  two beef hard shell tacos chicken burrito   Tacos appreciated  liked shells  Flavor fine but amazing  Many chunks meat very big much meat tough beef jerky  Maybe time there  Around 11 pm  May simmered all day lost its tenderness    The burrito filled everything  Good size  $8 dry rice  But chicken perfect    Basically experience average if again would chicken tacos happy  <EOR> Servings small charge 50 cent fee use debit credit card  lost customer hope many more  <EOR> This new favorite taco joint   Very good food authentic always leave wishing would ordered more!  two separate occasions now food great both times   restaurant extremely spacious small hole wall most other places   Plenty choices drinks well including pineapple horchata house version fruit punch   literally am willing sneak away office even though 10 minute drive   I've ordered shredded beef tacos chicken tacos rice n' beans   Never leaves empty plate shocking because most Mexican restaurants can't rice right   All homemade ingredients bargain prices   Definitely bookmarked when area need taco fix  <EOR> A coworker run some errands adjacent strip mall figured we'd stop Pepe's lunch  Unfortunately huge mistake   We chicken quesadilla combo carne asada burrito  First off combo just means drink supposed included doesn't come rice beans sides  Worse yet quesadilla managed both bland really really greasy which seems cardinal sin  burrito also lousy more really dry ground beef carne asada  small making value proposition quite suspect   And there's reason said combo means drink supposed included CC receipt noticed they'd charged extra drink  same lady processed order refused credit CC wanted pay back cash instead but when she gave cash she only gave back menu price drink without sales tax which charged   talk another person them understand also owed sales tax   I can't shake feeling wasn't mistake since never asked drink first place since supposed included combo just arbitrarily charged one  Also single person apologized during whole interaction   Finally charge $ 50 use CC  Bad value proposition lousy food shady cashiers still nickel+diming top all that? No thanks  <EOR> I yesterday evening place okay  lady assisting nice but food however SUCKED order 2 burritos de asada taco de asada Bf I  meat very dried told lady wanted little bit beans multiple times ended getting them ton beans  Long story short both now bed food poisoning puking lives away   WORST PEPE'S never again am going back rather eat Taco y Taco Tacos el Gordo  <EOR> I place because cheap good    Tacos good staff  very friendly <EOR> Their street tacos gross      once chicken taco piece edible meat it      nothing but knotty fatty weird pieces chicken   carne asada even worse I'm serious street taco person wife loves shredded tacos but every time give place another shot severely grossed out  hear them hacking taco meat back caring they're cutting through then pick nothing throw shell   going Frijoles frescas down street now where several times never anything gnarly meat  <EOR> The food so so  place clean service decent  Ordered carne asada fries actually think meat sour cream guacamole would've better fresh tortilla chips fries  Also would've preferred real shredded cheese vs  liquid cheese  Overall I'd only give 2 stars  more fast food Mexican we'd prefer  <EOR> We love place but every time come always seem hiring taquero cashier which question treat employees  <EOR> Pepe's Tacos surprisingly good but remove some stars because just isn't lot meat there    burrito stuffed everything but totally lacking meat department  see photos tacos stuffed meat but don't see what's inside burritos! touche! <EOR> I used big fan Pepe's Tacos over E  Charleston  would head over night clubbing some tacos soak alcohol  tried most tacos carne asada fries delish  remmber meat being really nice juicy fatty all  excited see going opening another place house looking forward some delicious tacos!
