I ordered Apple Endive Salad which just lovely mix flavors very light Grilled Trout fresh seasoned well Pretzel Caramel Tart which chocolate caramel candy bar vanilla ice cream large portion would recommend sharing one   Good service great food nice atmosphere   Only complaint music playing typically amps noise level along place being very full Friday night  <EOR> I'd prefer leave 3 5 star because basing review someone prefers eat meat every meal  options meatless meals very limited ones fried  happy hour per sign 3pm close which great menu ok  two house wines Cabernet  Chardonnay which decent  food option happy hour disappointment chose only drinks move next place  environment really clean modern however quite warm inside  Everyone once while someone would walk cause breeze thankfully  <EOR> Had girl's night last night place perfect drinks small dishes  heard great house wines attest that! really enjoyed Rose not sweet but light fruity also Moscow Mule    We ordered Heirloom Caprese Crispy Calamari Artisanal Charcuterie Platter Salmon Tartare Potato Chips Spiced Cauliflower  Among enjoyed Heirloom Caprese since fresh tangy mozzarella Caprese perfectly melted over fresh tomatoes  Artisanal Charcuterie Platter packed flavor cured cuts meat really tasty cheese varieties toasted bread  also think good choice since pairs well wine  Spiced Cauliflower popular favorite among group but personally felt bit bland    I didn't enjoy Salmon Tartare Potato Chips Crispy Calamari much  salmon lacking tanginess flavor something just forgettable  crispy calamari wasn't crispy would liked some pieces felt bit soggy also lacking flavor component    For main courses ordered Rigatoni which nothing special  However loved Sausage Pizza! crust perfect ratio cheese sausage  bread general yum including free bread    I would given place 5 since service phenomenal experience great but just few dishes fell short  would definitely come back Pizza Wine! <EOR> I thoroughly enjoyed dinner experience last night boosted impeccable service received upon entering all way through exiting   We arrived 20 minutes before reservation time when said early hostesses someone think maybe manager waved off no big deal sat immediately   walked table greeted waiters servers walked by   Very friendly   first table sat right back door patio husband asked if could move away door she said course promptly moved booth without any hesitation   Our waiter I think name Eric came right over very attentive throughout meal   ordered cheese salume board app   nice portion truffled honey delicious   Word caution horseradish mustard clear your nostrils out!  spicy!  dinner papperdelle oxtail ragu   noodles definition al dente perfect   ragu slightly sweet flavor made keep coming back more tried figure was   husband roast chicken which flavorful moist   He also ordered sweet potato side but maple butter made little sweet me   It's also worth noting wines cocktails nicely priced   crisp New Zealand Sauv Blanc just $8   Most cocktails around $11   I see some other reviews people mention noisy true quite loud there   But restaurant really made its service everyone friendly accommodating welcoming without being overbearing   fabulous date night! <EOR> I many restaurants usually am impressed  first time DT Summerlin location  Met some friends 8PM happy hour  8PM happy hours   Cox holding very loud gathering bar  Felt more sports bar then anything would Wolfgang's name it   The happy hour pricing apps good however plate calamari tiny  Compare size calamari app Sienna  Night day  <EOR> Our food good served fast  macaroni cheese die for!

Then brownie ICE CREAM came out  good but really nothing special  But GEEZ server nice  end free tiramisu paid only three dollars brownie twenty percent off meal mistakes  mean what's wrong that  excellent service really saved experience  <EOR> Finally gave place visit happy hour  vibe ambience place great really liked look place comfortable   Sat bar 5 minutes before HH ended bartender able order quickly  order salt pepper wings parmesan fries calamari  food pretty tasty all favorite wings  Definitely try those full flavor  only down side only 4!! fries good portion calamari good well   Can't forget liquor tried Summerlin Sour cocktail probably what's gonna keep bringing back  refreshing tasteful texture egg whites perfect  Ended having 3 girlfriend  Must try!  4 5 stars because wasn't amazed happy hour food choices but next time try main menu  <EOR> ??????
