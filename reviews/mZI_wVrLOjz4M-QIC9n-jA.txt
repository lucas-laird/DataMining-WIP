The nicest most attentive bartenders location especially Lacey she's just nicest keeps eye every guest there <EOR> My story begins Saturday night November 21 2015  decided friend your location Tropicana Maryland Parkway night began any other  came carded then sat bar  bar very crowded service time wasn't good all  only bartender working which didn't understand since busy Saturday night but  material different complaint letter  friend ended waiting 20 minutes until even able menu drink  bartender male possibly Samoan Hawaiian he curly hair ponytail   sitting bar awhile longer he finally able take order  friend ordered boneless chicken wings fries messy tatter tots barbeque chicken pizza  food drinks extremely generous tips gave totally came little over sixty dollars    for two people  friend ate enjoyed atmosphere  friend could barely finish wings friends ended eating whole tatter tot plate slice pizza  both extremely full especially since drinking beers  then asked bartender if he could give box something pizza since full couldn't eat where night turned bad  When originally ordered pizza asked if he could give box he said no eat said problem followed directions  Since pizza $9 dollars ended tipping another $9 dollars since discount  Once asked box bartender ended flipping front friend other bar goers  He said quote You're going eat more pizza else charge full price man! then replied serious? Even though spent all money? He then said Yeah man charge full price  You've before man know drill knew doing man trying pull fast us  dine in only deal should charging cover ass boss but guess let slide he said rudest tone possible yelling talking child  shocking especially since spend least $100+ dollars location week always tip extremely well   yet can't take pizza building without catching case bartender? quality pizza wasn't even good but  material another complaint letter well  don't see guys could charge $18 dollars bland pizza let alone give people half off attitude  Next time just Albertsons beer then pizza hut  It'll cheaper far less attitude come it  Quality food bad service terrible talked child rudest manner possible top all bartender ultimately ruined night because wanted stay bar drink more but angry pizza left  just didn't want pizza sitting while drinking wanted put away box    but having wishes came consequence getting talked dog your bartender  don't know needs change but he shouldn't gotten attitude me  Another thing acknowledge he's under pressure because company policy let people walk pizzas  But if people paying customers then why won't let people leave? Especially if they've eaten least slice did  bet if told any Kids hunger program World hunger program tried force eat pizza suffer consequences having pay more would appalled  funny part he already cashed bill ate awhile then he threatened charge more leaving pizza! absolutely ridiculous  can't force people anything they've paid food constant paying customers yours  Next time PT's someone threatens charge more $ eating more public then imagine  ridiculous service bartender needs brush customer service  If service better would stayed longer bought more drinks  Even if he just said nicely couldn't leave pizza THEN WOULDN'T HAVE! But he rude such douche write complaint  If he seriously losing mind over pizza then maybe guys need reconsider employee  guys just lost good loyal paying customer due your bartender having bad day giving attitude over PIZZA   totally worth losing constant business sarcasm   Goodbye PT's <EOR> As much love wings which price jacked lately place just doesn't know good customer service  20 mins drink turned wrong order very dirty bar didn't look cleaned last 12 hours  Even more disgustingly dirty bathroom early evening can't imagine place looks gets busy later evening  If public areas dirty can't imagine kitchen might look like  far WORST BARTENDER SERVICE EVER or lack thereof based least 5 visits thinking might better      forever drink if right order watered down then check wrong bartender gets attitude correcting tab accusing trying cheat him  ask if he remembered serving cosmopolitans which hate never drink yet 4 tab remembered he couldn't remember ordered crown coke begin when did order it  Oh yeah very little comp playing $80 max bet quarters only two drinks comped? Management really needs overhaul staff big time  Used pinnacle service standards some years ago  Lots pooltables really only plus here  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  Came UNLV Arizona basketball  Waited 45 minutes order drink because two bartenders entire place  No clue manager but cost place hundreds dollars night  Embarrassing  <EOR> Very nice casual bar  Bartenders all friendly  Food great!!! 8 pool tables beer pong table golden tee  very busy very Hispanic weekends  Mix locals college students etc   <EOR> Not  huge fan PTs   food good but feel know bartender come everyday good service  asked simple cherry coke he came back no cherries  ask cherries cherry coke????I stink eye when complained lol    well cherries coke ! SORRY! only nibbled friends plate don't feel abilty review food much lol <EOR> Though hate smell people dying cigarettes bar favorite around university area  Pool tables sweet jukebox beer pong tables great staff  Bobby probably favorite bartender now    It heavy smoke inside but past when hanging friends here  amazing food least far had  Pizza wings chicken caesar salad club sandwich favorite !  They may huge variety beer pretty much any drink want  Bobby pretty good AMF    Thursday nights UNLV pride nights well karaoke night  Come wearing any UNLV gear discounts drinks  $2 bud light last night! Plus drunk sing ridiculous songs all night  cannot sing Summer Lovin' Grease sober sure    Then everyday 4 7pm 12am 3am Happy Hour    I really love coming just sit beer some nights  chill favorite hole wall place eyes  If often would want request Beer Bites card  Reward card food drinks well needing Happy Hour prices  Another rewards card add collection one's already every casino town no biggy  haha   PTs may most cleanliness place town but your style attractiveness lures people in   seeing soon! <EOR> I put 1 star but if could I'd even give half star  leave wanted ID 2 people clearly 60s  They're visiting country without passports them  husband late 20s early 30s ID  Rules rules but common sense should always prevail didn't want business apparently  just took road dozen drinks planned having last night town  Cheers  <EOR> Great bar UNLV sports  Close campus great happy hour   Tons Pool Tables beer pong  <EOR> I hour between classes wanted quick lunch  other PT's thought might good choice  Ambiance walking bright sunny afternoon sky takes few seconds accommodate because very dark inside  room pretty much divided into three sections  walk into bar area  Then relatively small area tables eating  then third section 8 pool tables  But overall pretty depressing part because dark  part because empty other only three people shooting pool entire place   Plus while eating someone came while sitting bar lit cigarette  no real separation between bar area dining area smoke drifted over  Yuck!! Service server table almost immediately sitting down  She gave specials menu full menu  She brought drink almost immediately  different person brought food  server came back couple times during meal sure didn't need anything else  Overall service good  Food barbecue chicken salad  biggest surprise presentation excellent see photo   salad actually quite tasty  Unfortunately third plate chips which mentioned menu no interest in  come back lunch would order without chips  Value Overall four star food service dragged down 1 star ambiance  would come back lunch  <EOR> Went 2 others work  all casino workers played hour all ate dinner 5 drinks amongst us  check came bartender did comp drink  Never PTs gotten drinks comped  receipt says Loreta  may bartenders name  she introduced herself even remotely social would known  Never going back that  Super disappointed both service fact personally spent over $40 playing didn't $5 00 drink comp  seriously PTs become?! <EOR> I informed bartender $20 machine equals free drink  $60 later compted 1 free drink  your choice but would somewhere else  Even chain bars offer better that  <EOR> This those PT's stuck middle strip mall  looks divey sketchy outside  Inside definitely more rundown PT's but otherwise isn't much different every other PT's  karaoke set just odd there's just really enough room it  whole thing just feels awkward  When comes down though I'd much rather hang different PT's  <EOR> four stars because won't let order just flat wings  Rick ross said wing stop place eat wings   Wrong Pt's  This place many co workers work late night party  Singing thinking filet mignon thinking PT's Lemon pepper jk Lemon pepper wings bomb baby <EOR> Me boy while waiting flight watched Warriors game  reason giving review mainly due good wings French fries were!! off hook! couldn't believe even heard ppl around talking good wings fries were!   Other food normal PTs  nice new ones course but could definitely benefit some bigger TVs <EOR> This PTs terrible sure franchise allows it  Bathrooms positively gross service slow feel hassling bartender every time ask something  Nice pool table section but apparently heated over winter pretty sure warmer outside   watched lots patrons getting mad because jukebox playing during football      If wanted visit 'hood PTs would cruised down Arville!  And edit can't call order French fries 'skillet' just because serve frying pan  Lame <EOR> Located corner strip mall right across UNLV campus  There's probably lot UNLV students comes since dorms right across street   Stopped before MWC semi finals  lot UNLV fans getting prefunk some New Mexico San Diego St lot Colorado St fans but everyone all representing  busy but did good job handling all craziness   Typical neighborhood bar but little older maybe need little touching up  There's typical bar entertainment tvs video games darts billiard tables etc   Full bar great friendly environment   Parking kind sucks because lanes right front way tight confusing when lot packed people  driving wrong lanes  Also shares lot other businesses which equally busy  <EOR> Can all just agree rude unnamed woman everyone writing Mandi? She probably worst bartender ever   Doesn't sense treat customers crap expect good tip  Idk  just though   Won't back if she's working    <EOR> Lacey bartender good pleasant bartender  didn't cousin walked same time two males she served them before girls  Also she asked if wanted run tab said yes she asked hold ID's which perfectly fine but noticed she asked males next same thing but didn't require hold ID's  She didn't come back until beer completely empty mind ordered big cup beer ask if wanted another one  Normally stay few beers maybe shot but today  cousin PT'S regularly happy hour work worst experience due Lacey  <EOR> Best PTs opinion  beer pong tables pool tables  close UNLV usually big crowd games weekends  usually big group drink through happy hour    My favorite thing selections  pear cider BOMB  Usually bartenders really cool little busy gotta patient  <EOR> Quite honestly reason am fan lot pool tables offer free pool certain nights bartenders male female always awesome  PLUS humongous beer 2 50 during happy hour PT card  free if playing 5 quarters  really this?

Probably cause she knew hated she wasn't getting tip anyway   This guy must afraid eye contact something cause pretty much whole freaking bar's attention besides his  People even tried helping wave over  No avail  Took over hour half dump gotten sit down meal real restaurant faster  getting fed finally walked over waved hand face demanded check    I don't ask much when coming run down bars but really  bar  corners  Look over them  <EOR> Of all PT's scattered Vegas really think nicest ones  clean comfy gazillion pool tables all pretty well maintained  menu pretty large consisting all sorts anything fried sandwiches burgers wraps  never really gone PT's specifically eat but happened handful times condition where food become necessary  chicken Caesar wrap pretty good but packed full croutons which quite mess your lap  your grill  prices reasonable service always friendly there's juke box  couldn't ask anything more   If before midnight say hi Bubba  can't miss  he's comparable Fridge  Sweet though  He'll take care ya  <EOR> Sad report but changed mind PT's   bartender didn't name little afraid ask Comp Nazi insisting play video poker non stop lightning speed order lousy shaker pint glass Stone IPA  Boo!

Looks sketchy outside but gave try because picking someone waiting delayed flight  inside nice though  Very deceiving outside  first bartender very nice drinks right away  Decided leave bar area play pool opened tab    So     when back grab another drink another bartender clearly saw sitting waiting order then turns around asks need something? Um yeah! Hello  rude  Drinks overpriced $7 tiny rocks glass rum coke barely any rum  Stay away    Oh yeah! Someone swiped truck way out  Didn't notice until home called told no parking lot surveillance  <EOR>
