Prices reasonable $8 99 burger looks real cool place eat small bar too  Only thing just 2 locations both NE NW Las Vegas   If haven't checked place DON'T WAIT!! <EOR> Ruby's really close come fairly often  Especially when coupons floating around which usually are  generally having dinner tonight especially good    I ordered usual glass wine favorite RT dinner crabcake   order broccoli mashed two sides   broccoli doesn't anything added isn't raw well done Baby Bear says just right   helps atone crabcake which probably drenched butter   really good   My husband sliders salad bar   lunch menu but available dinner few bucks more   Two beef sliders fries any side your choice all you can eat salad bar think 9 99     I Ruby Tuesday's burgers but most recent menu incarnation now two different qualities meat available   very old days Ruby's burgers awful   used order them sometimes because knew I'd never pay meal since I'd invariably send them back complain   Then few years ago more upscale burgers top shelf fabulous   don't think burger Ruby's since switched B burgers just sliders but since discovered crab cake  usually order   I love fact drinks reasonably priced $5 cocktails house brand liquors which decent quality   drink though depends which bartender which RT happens mixing night   Ruby Tuesdays all across country sure vary   Our server Raymie very friendly efficient though surprised she never heard Yelp!   But best part dinner ta dah none servers running infernal carpet sweepers back forth!  process going every single Ruby Tuesday's ever Las Vegas New Jersey Indiana Tennessee everywhere  didn't matter if 7 pm near closing   annoying pervasive emailed corporate no response then called   curt answer way things  Maybe others finally complained maybe rain made all servers sluggish lazy tonight but finally meal without damned Whirrrrrrr  May continue 2011  <EOR> I don't know Ruby's  very good experiences other locations but now avoid one    The server never came back check asked burger medium rare well done waiter kept making weird comments people table  price meal would better off staying home wouldn't put such awful service  <EOR> Their bison burger LITERALLY took breath away   seriously respiratory problems bite weird  didn't mention anyone else table until saw grimacing uncomfortably then asked am only having hard time breathing? all said having same problem!
