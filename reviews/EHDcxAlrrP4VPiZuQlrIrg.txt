Most likely but same team still know NEVER back because place more interested serving bad food in more then sense being safe   The Health Department should informed    As aside asked myself why people running place when realized quite possible people didn't realize something wrong opposed making scene returning food ate thinking Maybe supposed taste  If think absurd realize most people keep drinking bottle rare vintage wine even if turned vinegar years ago because rare vintage told good  happens lot  <EOR> I scream scream all scream for     FRIED ICE CREAM!

Evidently no management let things hand   Meanwhile Charcoal Room next door always 5 start experience  MANAGEMENT Santa FE Management! <EOR> We returned previous bad experience here  management tried correct issues but limited policies evidently unable more then verbally admonish poor employees  bartender made clear he knew complained  He unfriendly unprofessional he  made entire experience uncomfortable possible returning  Plus bar still filthy  win  <EOR> If avoid place so  leave bad reviews but when your girlfriends ends vomiting your sister law feels sick myself same  must something bad food  service good no complaints even though server forgot bring margarita least he didn't try charge then changed minds  good thing he forgot completely haha    The food though beans tasted if canned beans rice dry very old  rest food did good taste blah  <EOR> In word   this experience underwhelming   I remember coming Cabo back when first opened years ago just LOVING food  Have tastes matured much once awesome worth 40 minute wait table just isn't anymore?  Sure think maybe they've matured little but really think its just drop standards    The whole night Cabo underwhelming time approached hostess till left important exception service   server amazing manager bit misunderstanding complaint very receptive criticism feedback   We arrived hostess station 6 35pm told would 10 15 minute wait   when plenty open seats  asked if could just sit bar top she said servers busy catch tables   Ok strike horribly understaffed     Then noticed time noticed happy hour ends 7pm every day    Are trying seat late don't take advantage happy hour?  lot HH menu wanted but still     Luckily seated 6 50 ten minutes spare order wings $5   Our server said before treasure   She pleasant kept water glass full whole night   It took while chips salsa which discovered because kid bringing chips also ONLY busser saw floor   which brings question sanitary practices?  same guy bussing dirty dishes bringing chips salsa   no gloves   Hm   The chips good but salsas little   boring   Another stations property Mexican restaurant salsa bar MUCH better selection salsa's   Boring disappointing     So wings arrived standard wings   nothing write home about   When entrees arrived where problems started occurring    My chimi fajita thing ENORMOUS   Like   ridiculously huge fed dinner last night lunch today STILL didn't eat whole thing    served refried beans cheese Mexican rice garnish pico de gallo   pico laughable   If you're serving pico want enough put chimichanga wasn't enough plate first bite     As far flavor goes   it started off mediocre mostly just vegetables end   closer middle found chicken actually pretty nice     My fella ordered steak fajitas REALLY disappointed  First all he ordered them NO sour cream   and received bowl pico sour cream it     Second fajita platter lonely tiny stalk cilantro   One   mostly stem no leaves    Worse all though   the steak bland!  could dropped floor stepped would more flavor    At point asked server speak manager   When told steak being bland think she may misunderstood trying she said would steak  Uh   yeah   little angsty bit stepped game letting know simply trying provide feedback quality food bland   advertising steak marinated didn't taste way all   After explained ourselves bit better she VERY apologetic offered take fajitas off check that wasn't  goal but since he didn't eat much nice offer accepted told much she valued feedback   The best part though she came back table taking food back said she tried steak bland     So good news if she true word she seemed she kind person cares business she should chefs season meat better    I torn giving Cabo 3 stars simply change heart but end day food just wasn't very good all    I don't know I'd come back again really   its other side town better restaurants but if someone wants come probably won't say no   I'd see if actually improvements  <EOR> The food mediocre best  much menu  chicken taquitos tried bean salsa dips which very plain  Tried Cadillac lime margarita which tasty strong  service great waitress very friendly  Overall probably won't come around seconds but if players card 10 points every dollar would probably meal free next time around  <EOR> We going Cabo years since moving northwest Vegas am sad say probably last time  Quality food just anymore  family ordered beach party appetizer chicken tortilla soup fajitas dinner last night  When chile con queso dip says queso would think would some resemblance cheese  Nope  something taste butter flavored melted cream sauce  No tomato chile description  other items platter medioacre best  Hubby says fajita ok  least soup good but beyond disappointed restaurant  <EOR> Cabo go to neighborhood Mexican restaurant  queso chips best town! If allowed call order then would queso daily  Okay exaggerating bit but definitely weekly  combination plates decent too  easily two meals three item combo  servers timely manner most servers very cool  generally dine when Station's Casino coupon mail save few dineros  <EOR> We tried place mainly because its close proximity home it's always nice good places close   long wait which don't blame them but handled poorly  return hostess twice pager continue wait  Once seated service good hence second star  food mediocre right down middle neither good nor bad  drinks similar  problem prices high end unless you're starving I'd recommend finding different place  <EOR> This first last time eating here  Where begin? Initially came kill time before seeing movie Btw movie Quiet Place great! asked drink menu waitress said didn't one  First red flag seen drink menu would seen charge $12 per margarita   price expect delicious expertly crafted drinks  Nope  Basic margaritas could probably TON ice very little actual drink  Now comes chips which somewhat stale salsa meh  Then ordered food  dinners suppose come salads  drinking over priced BASIC margaritas entrees arrived  asked waitress happened salads  response basically Oops want wrap go? we're going eat salads theatre?
