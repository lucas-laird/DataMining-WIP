No eating no serving  asked nearby bartender he said could sit where wanted he would take order minute   This weird but he proved extremely nice helpful all night   I polenta friend Kent burger  also hummus appetizer  polenta salty but burger hummus decent   The pricing very reasonable even though place located Rumor  sure would back but worth experience check hotel   It looks patio open during summers maybe trip back sit outside couple months would fun     <EOR> Awful place never ever there  Looks use water toilet prepare coffee tea end waiting food ages    seriously 1 hour prepare sandwich?? only excuse see if grow chicken kitchen before actually put into sandwich  <EOR> This place could lot better but service simply there  dinner took 45 minutes food ordered  Waitress never checked nerve drop off check before food even there! <EOR> We dined party four place ourselves Saturday night  single other diner until nearly done dessert  didn't realize but food tapas style  probably would've better off ordering ala carte rather prix fixe three course Restaurant Week menu $30 12  least tab benefited charity   We started French Onion Soup Mac Bites Deep Fried Smoked Gouda Cheddar Mac Cheese  Mac Bites real tasty soup wasn't very good  lacked richness should overpowered salt   Next Mixed greens Toasted Walnuts Citrus Vinaigrette  lightly dressed greens crisp  Nothing notable however   The salad followed Seared then Braised Short Ribs Sweet Potato Puree Crispy Potato Strings Smoked Salt Wild Honey Port Burgundy Sauce  Tasty but portion small without potato strings would've baby food    Dessert concluded meal gossip sundae green tea ice cream bananas fried wontons  bad nor memorable  lava cake bit dry  recommended   Addiction odd place decent food  trying occasion may successful but particular Saturday? ghost town  actually felt part horror movie times  dined early avoid Saturday night crowds guess could say suceeded  But we're certainly addicted  <EOR> My friend decided check place restaurant com coupon While weekday afternoon really really quiet ambiance nice food pretty good  each burgers split appetizer dessert  ordered Gossip sundae when given wrong dessert let keep it  forewarned if you're looking green tea ice cream sure you're gonna cuz pretty sure pistachio    Still yummy! <EOR> I friend's birthday party   decor very different feel girl clothing store Modern Luxury feel    food pretty good price   Salmon Salad Burger Hanger Steak   steak came cold first time but Chef apologize ahead made new plate right away   service good but slow    server nice but everything came kitchen just slow  <EOR> Burned Addiction yet again! mom wanted come birthday because she incredibly picky eater conceded offering many other restaurant options which knew we'd substantially better eating service experience  leaving dinner mom told could pick restaurants out  She said she trusted me  Sometimes takes just having bad experience all your face!  Our waitress nice but inattentive laziness but because she only waitress sure waitressing only job duty  food meh everything fell flat presentation deeply disappointing unsatisfying  ordered parmesan fries french onion soup mom ordered off Restaurant Week menu also french onion soup salad seared ahi sundae    I feel if restaurant going offer classic dish French onion soup better put own spin better best best  version neither think tried hide fact unforgivable amount salt  cheese neither melted nor hot just slice some identifiable cheese point melted but now sitting thick unappetizing layer top soup  Underneath slice appeared wheat bread  soaked liquid soup soggy again unappetizing  broth's only minimally redeeming quality abundance onions but overpowered broth offensively salty if hypertension I'd writing review grave   The rest food mediocre best mom nailed when she said fries tasted Jack Box fries which like! But could've paid $2 those instead $6  Presentation bad ahi should've served some starch possibly polenta potatoes in addition salad    I don't want keep bashing place because potential  food needs work restaurant operations could definitely use boost la Restaurant Impossible  Being only restaurant Rumor really need step game invest better quality food additional staff shut restaurant down completely use space something else  <EOR> To sum all Addiction restaurant part poorly ran hotel called Rumor   food exceptional considering many things  However SERVICE want slap everyone valet dishwasher! NUMBER 1 ISSUE SERVE FOOD SHOW MENU WEBSITE??? decor style sure cool hip funky risky etc  Chef GREAT chef but delivery awful  If hurry check place out  certainly different say DA H    going around here? hahahaha lol smh rolf  # INTERESTING <EOR> Without question best dining experiences Vegas  Professional delicious affordable memorable  If come ask Stephen chef give experience won't forget  <EOR> I wanted try someplace new interesting birthday dinner long ago decided wanted try Addiction then boyfriend Friday night   place pretty empty except few tables ended sitting outside     The menu decent selection everything very reasonably priced compard other restaurants strip   ton food all which delicious! Here's had Appetizers Kobe Sliders $9  3 tasty sliders loaded bacon cheese Chicken Bacon Quesadilla $8  Mmm more bacon cheese can't wrong there! haha Mac Styx $7  YUM!! Two large pieces deep fried mac cheese    fav appetizer three     Entrees Karmal Pork $19  thick large pork chop smothered amazing caramel whisky glaze creamy mashed potatoes veggies   phenomenal!! Easily best pork dishes ever restaurant  House Filet $26  very similar Karmal Pork but filet mignon slightly different sauce equally delicious   pork two most expensive items menu but since come all sides huge portions very reasonably priced!!    Dessert Da Nutta Butta $6 4 deep fried nutter butter cookies served raspberry dipping sauce    OMG   good!! But full bring most them home enjoy later  Also since birthday brought 3 complimentary mini cupcakes they serve them dessert option Gigi's cupcakes nearby    pretty good Service great throughout waitress very friendly attentive then again wasn't busy    Overall extremely happy place thought food fantastic decently priced   I'd absolutely back would highly recommend place! hope give shot <EOR> Had Restaurant com gift cert decided try Addiction dinner before heading over HRH Adult Entertainment Expo parties last Friday night   Upon entrance into lobby Rumor Hotel could see restaurant but little unclear where entrance but combo hunger determination engine drove successful seating main but SMALL dining room   Menu changed January 2012     no longer entrees dinner menu     Only burger bar Tapastizers    opted tapas  server friendly accomodating  Perhaps little chatty because he engaged conversation little long when he remembered placed food order he rushed into kitchen fetch food but every dish slightly luke warm rather HOT   star gone   Another star lost due fact tapas adequate but nothing terribly impressive     Here ordered French Onion Soup Very rich broth yummy melty cheesey goodness top  Enjoyable but found broth little intense lacking sweet mellowness some better dining venues around town   Parmesean French Fries Very good cooked crisp coating seasoned well generously grated parm  YUM  Short Sweet Pork short ribs top whipped sweet taters topped rich burgundy sauce 3 little piles    Pretty good but could better served appropriate temp   Flat Iron Steak Tacos Good but almost room temp when served  Probably would enjoyed most if served hot   Overall bad food decent service unique atmosphere   happy gift cert though because don't think experience worth full price  Nevertheless would return try burger bar happy hour deals!

To preface night medium sized birthday party held lounge bar lobby area which overflowed into small dining area   DJ spinning music which really complimented ambiance modern decor   Although only two different dining parties would still recommend reservations due amount parties private functions hotel restaurant does business with     We impressed food last week just called reservations tonight!!!!  place now Addiction !!! <EOR> I really think someone might've kidnapped banana man   Why two TWO times bananas? Yes people BANANAS  According Norm K  also bananas when he only witnessed this  should just change description Gossip Sundae don't tell people they're bananas whenever someone orders it    Other mystery missing bananas layout seating situation place just weird  When walk toward pool area Rumor you'll see bar right left you'll see appears eating area but no hostess wall separation let know  restaurant  only assume Addiction because you'll see some people eating staring while look all puzzled  Finally few minutes waiter come fill someone's water something then see standing there  He'll take table hand some menus but both times gone ask tapas menu because didn't give along regular menu    I've ordered Cuban Ruben w pesto salad $9 sandwich dry  pesto salad bland  pretty much attacked boyfriend's burger because food boring   Custom burger medium well w fries fried egg swiss mushrooms avocado aioli toppings $11 Yummy  course sh*t good picked toppings myself!
