The kamaboko fishcake dip done just right  rich heavy but still flavorful   Currently favorite menu item pulehu tako dried octopus mostly because reminds something grandfather used make  chewy dry sauce adds little bit heat  similar items other places Vegas but nothing comes close  exercise extreme constraint eat entire container sitting   Regardless if you're Hawaii something everyone  Hawaii some ordered may seem unusual like kamaboko dip because don't find menus town  But back home you'll find potlucks family gatherings any day week    Highly recommend definitely going back again soon! <EOR> Located spring mt rainbow next Greenland!   My favorite poke spot right now! definitely home vibe it  Being Hawaii hard finding good poke place lives expectations  yet try other options today time but kewalo bowl  contained furikake spicy shoyu they also regular kine onions white brown rice ahi poke  poke tasted fresh everything blended perfectly together! believe around $9 10 bucks regular size  also give good sized portion! lot poke places really lack portion wanna very cheap fish  place give good amount  also try girlfriends salmon poke good smooth buttahhhh    Overall back soon try other options  Specifically wanna try ahi katsu bowl sounded bomb! staff friendly place clean good amount seating  <EOR> Paina brings original Hawaiian style poke bowl Vegas! Though many poke bowl spots opening around town all native Islanders quick point they're real thing Paina is    The poke flavors Paina traditional fish forward actual Hawaiian poke your bowl rather just fish sauce  If you're used usual overly sauced fish bowls tons toppings may find underwhelming note each topping comes 60 cent charge  also purchase pokes weight take home keep eye tako poke which sells out!  The Nanea salmon bowl first tried followed Hawaiian bowl which combines hot cold protein lomi kalua pork your choice poke   fish fresh flavorfully marinated fish quality higher competition  ahi katsu Caesar salad also interesting menu item protein portion further looks crisp Romaine flaky parmesan add lot texture    Bonus star partnering OnoSweets fancy Hawaiian influenced desserts strawberry mochi ube tarts love! matcha roll cakes  Definitely plan having something sweet end your meal! <EOR> Ordered Hawaiian Poke Bowl kalua pig rice lomi salmon choice poke which picked Hawaiian style poke   ono delicious topped off pickle onions kim chee takuan  <EOR> Tried desserts today  ube tart overrated flavorful basically just sweet custard bright color while passion fruit tart delightful great combination sweet tart soft crunchy  Other tarts good all worth trying  green tea custard very matcha awesome  ube cake roll well cake part great again ube custard along Chantilly custard very impressive  Aloha tower not sure if exactly name banana pound cake cream Chantilly custard banana pound cake very good  other Haupia bar good period  Overall desserts decent back try other items  Big disappointment ube custard but cafe advertised ube crazy good  didn't expect chantilly custard special anyways cuz basically just butter sugar egg milk  ube flavor tastes maybe if try really hard taste some starch  mean expecting ube just potato different color don't expect something magical guys sweet potato better  <EOR> First time trying Pa'ina Cafe    lived HI 20 years haven't even tried either  finally decided drive all way across town try since sister craving poke   The atmosphere place super cute hip love canvases throughout store add touch Hawaii store  menu pretty self explanatory but felt expecting  spicy ahi bowl would probably rate little more spicy side compared spicy ahi had    You great amount fish price bowl but dislike charge additional 60 cents per topping    didn't end adding toppings anyway because felt took away poke  Another plus would serve just plain white brown rice sushi rice hate when poke places give sushi rice it's poke bowl sushi bowl     They also variety desserts choose chantilly tarts ube tarts which looked delicious  am definitely putting list next time visit    This place clean cute food good customer service great  <EOR> This review bakery portion cafe  am thoroughly pleased ordered good friends birthday ordered custom cake well two dozen white cupcakes day before friendly communicating everything    Highly recommend bakery! back try poke! <EOR> I'm giving place 4 stars based off loco moco  beef patty strange sweetness it  boyfriend finished both loco mocos regardless  But both agreed probably would've tasted better if entire dish savory sweet  Heck add shoyu beef patty drown sweetness tasting   But otherwise  poke DIE FOR  favorite place now Vegas fresh quality poke  Shoyu poke Spicy Ahi favorites  definitely want try other flavors   And sure back feed inner diabetic  want try those beautiful pancakes desserts  course practically everything else menu lol    I faith Paina! far good  <EOR> Food good but lot options  rice substitute only normal lettuce  no options add vegetables other proteins  It other poke places tried before  Still yummy though! <EOR> Found Yelp ordered salmon poke watery sauce lacking flavor 30 % poke onion disappointed wont return  <EOR> I love poke Paina consistently delicious!    my favorite spicy tuna  crunch bowl garlic chips <EOR> The reason giving 4 star because haven't tried EVERYTHING  menu sweets  Other atmosphere quite laid back refreshing I feel Oahu when stepped into establishment   staff friendly efficient easy converse with  price reasonable since bowls fill up   I definitely want try sweets next time since always sweet tooth  <EOR> I've came back few times food just home but    employees really don't seem want there  business flourish customer service  da ALOHA??? <EOR> My absolute favorite spot when you're craving poke bowl  Came poke crunch bowl w spicy tuna  poke toppings rice perfect!
