McDonalds does better higher quality $1       Been Aria 3 years now resturant still sucks  Plenty better places eat  <EOR> The food good BUT service horrific  Servers chocolates side awful  overheard man tell sever honest any interest because felt took extra time sure sandwich good  he left asked same lady pricing macarons because no pricing anywhere only chocolates she quickly said something left back never came back  proceeded wait good ten minutes serviced man would rather restocking they seriously no other clients   Also when finally serviced rude barely answered questions  When he food he made feel annoyance busy day  only reason why gave two stars because food least deserved that  Otherwise I'd give them zero stars if could  boyfriend heard many good things place decided give try willing pay try bunch items but price awful service you're better off spending your money elsewhere  bought two sandwiches five macrons raspberry tart chocolate croissant totaling almost $60  weren't even able enjoy because upset service  <EOR> Pastries pretty good but 5 dollar coffee don't any cream half half right now next 3 hours?  don't mean seem needy but doesn't seem much ask something thicker milk put coffee   Especially when leave two half fingers room cream    Sorry mean milk   Did mention didn't cream? <EOR> No chocolate waterfall but deli layout Aria location  Reasonably priced sandwich salads  always desert coffee  <EOR> Came night just before closed while should know better order food Patisserie ordered food anyway   Cobb Salad pre made probably sitting hours   only came Blue Cheese Dressing while normally isnt problem already ton blue cheese salad itself felt blue cheese overload   friend ordered Roast Beef sandwich which also probably sitting hours but he seemed enjoy it   he just SUPER hungry   After food decided try some crepes   ordered savory crepe chicken mushrooms just so so  crepe good but chicken mushroom more liquid anything flavor just so so   also ordered bananas fosters crepe also just mediocre   Again crepe itself good but only small serving bananas fosters top   bananas inconsistent some hard others mushy   flavor just so so   While probably could crepe good could definitely better bananas fosters    I'm writing place off completely would probably come back try something better known for  <EOR> This first time coming here  Friendly staff  Great atmosphere  Fun visit  tried Salmon crepe  <EOR> The pastries OK I'm pastry chef myself same stuff but service terrible  Bored looking workers no acknowledgement when counter  No hello no smile just give your money  Took 10 minutes two items just needed put box  wasn't being busy saw lot screwing off  working customer service Vegas trying wouldn't it  But paid $15 two small pastries curtesy much ask? <EOR> COCONUT GELATO  am eating very moment    so  good  Every single bite filled loads shredded coconut creamy goodness  If coconut order disappointed!  I also tried Almond croissant very large croissant every bite flaky layers almond paste even very ends  Sliced almonds top  Perfect  Crepes souffle apple compote chocolate some savory don't remember sweet crepes decadent! Can't wrong any them  savory crepe just alright  Vanilla latte $6 small  Nothing special   I've both Bellagio Aria locations both serve same items  employees very nice always smiling never seem impatient annoyed  once dropped broke glass chocolate sauce accident only joked didn't angry all even though felt terrible  prefer Aria because dining area but chocolate fountain Bellagio still fun look at   That located right next guest elevators Aria    oh man  walk three times day want eat everything!!! <EOR> If love french pastry place definitely check out   would recommend raspberry strawberry tarts   little bit pricey over $8 piece but definitely worth it  <EOR> I LOVE place!! baked goods all authentic French I know cuz French    Some favorites The pain au chocolat chocolate croissant The Palmier The Croissant aux amandes Almond croissant Their curry chicken sandwich YUMMMMM! wish could eat everyday! <EOR> Came quick breakfast  line fairly long service fairly slow  Two coffee forest crepes  food absolutely worth wait  enormous delicious competent stuffed meat veggies cheese  Excellent place if you're staying Aria don't want stray far  much seating available unfortunately avoiding busy times may good decision  <EOR> I think Aria   There's another Bellagio next door   Had prosciutto sandwich breakfast sandwich some chocolate dessert forgot but just ask servers recommend give that    All very delicious   Great eat inside Aria   Kinda pricey food but hey its Vegas  <EOR> Best pastries ever life! Pricey but definitely worth it  mention design quality into them  Recommend anyone going Aria stop pick something sweet  <EOR> The manager jasmine decided talk employee 5 minutes before greeting take order  Then completely rude while taking order  guess employees conversation much more important guest's order   won't returning ! <EOR> Came last night having early dinner other end strip yet again despite fact favorite croissant sold ordered cheese Danish taste still fantastic even though made earlier day   OAN passed JP's other location Bellagio which much smaller although nice flowing chocolate fall display  If never JP locations recommend going Aria full sweets experience!

None best gelato we'd ever but hit spot hoofing few hours  Seating bit tight given many things offer but once seated comfortable    Very recommended! We'll back  <EOR> You can't walk Jean Philippe drawn gorgeous display pastries  While location may world's largest chocolate fountain Bellagio kinda better because less crowded which means shorter wait they're less likely sold anything! Plus menu selections both locations identical   During last day Vegas friends decided some pastries JP  original location Bellagio first bunch pastries there  However croissants! Fortunately when check Aria saw location still plenty  While friends gamble more pastries  Hey risk losing when gamble pastries always win!  I totally suckered irresistible displays ended buying lot more pastries could finish even help friends  Food seems some type mystical power over me  palmier apple brioche croissant http www yelp com user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd gfcUl6o5j7FQ select=2KjxGRE16UT4LSBsq5lSsA apple turnover nutella brioche almond brioche http www yelp com user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd gfcUl6o5j7FQ select=_5qyR nH5KbGQOnvAYxuNg   pricey side I'd never spent much money pastries!

Take picture enjoy  <EOR> Not great all  Expect better French patisserie! Vegas 4 days work tried all kinds pastries dessert  coffee barely mediocre Starbucks pastries range bad ok  chocolate raspberry dessert bad but wow either  <EOR> I give place 4 5 star based service food   One night watching show Aria friends decided lets crepe cause looks good  course shared mine friend because really big lots fruits we ordered berry one   whip substituted lemon sorbet  good great berry crepe  watch them right front eyes    The place really nice looking  Made want everything but know limits sweets food  hehe  would probably fatty if eat everything there    Reason why didn't give full 5 star rating because service didn't wow me  smile huge difference me  Saying thank mean means nothing me  ya    I would totally come back if Vegas try other stuff would totally suggest others come  really good  crepe alone doesn't taste much but fillings top awesome  <EOR> Just breakfast service inefficient setup done such way wait forever cashier while others empty but since can't see just wait it took 20 Minutes order few pastries coffee   staff unwelcoming trained rude even French standards  croissant chocolate croissant almond croissant good but nothing world  americano ok hot chocolate bad mostly hot water slight taste chocolate   If you're looking pleasant experience somewhere else  If you're motivated stay pastries  <EOR> Ate two scoop gelato  Delicious meal dessert if satisfied expensive five dining restaurant desserts  Also won't break bank much    One should learn sample few before making your selection  combo coconut cappuccino turned better expected  <EOR> Jean Philippe Patisserie perfection  <EOR> Ordered Omlette coffee cold time ready  Don't bother wasn't worth wait <EOR> Excellent panini! recommend prosciutto tuna melt delicious super satisfying  There's usually line but through quickly  Price reasonable  <EOR> Had blueberry cupcake  Beautiful delicious  Time stopped ate it   For nondairy folks also put soy milk your latte no extra charge  Considering expensive lattes good  use Pacific Soy Blenders    we also raspberry macaron sandwich thing  Beautiful but macarons way sweet no exception   The Jean Phillippe Aria better Bellagio because more seating seems more selection  <EOR> I wanted try place last couple times Aria Hotel but just did time stop few things    So today day decided check place out   walked deserts beautifully presented just stop drool   So finally 10 minutes carefully checking each item decided vanilla flan tutti fruiti chocolate intense coconut macaroon chocolate coconut macaroon   The vanilla flan awesome vanilla flavor intense delicious   tutti fruitti fiiled lemon mousse topped strawberries      very light super tasty   chocolate intense chocoate covered chocolate mousse topped chocolate macaroon    sooooo yummy   Bottom line if enjoy awesome sweets must check place out  <EOR> It decent stuff but overpriced mind  know its Vegas its hotel famous but still  <EOR> High quality latte  hot mocha latte such delicious drink first drink! rich flavor but overwhelming  cafe seating plentiful  only problem location inside casino without windows outside but actually still quite scene even Monday afternoon  <EOR> So serve super hot crepes omelettes straight plastic plates!!!! No paper any kind protection between hot food straight into your body plastic plate  melt hence releases all sorts toxins Phthalates BPA name few into your food   big no no Jean Philippe know it  Also ironically decorated all fresh colorful fruits including oranges around serving counter yet serve fresh squeezed orange juice! Haha  Pretentious? say yes  serves sugary O J  concentrate nowadays   besides McDonalds is? guys do  matters worse ony 2 people preparing all omlettes crepes busy Sunday morning  order took 45 minutes ready  Good luck  <EOR> Delicious paninis!   We tried prosciutto mozzarella tandoori chicken  sandwiches could tad lighter sauce but overall good ratio fillings bread  top layer bread crispy but bottom kind soggy due heavy saucing   The desserts looked yummy but stuffed  Maybe next time! <EOR> This probably far best feature Aria had  also right next guest elevators why HELLO THERE!   I don't know much candy pastries although place does boast awe inspiring chocolate fountains Bellagio does certainly large lounge area interesting bizarre but very attractive designs architecture inlays    I need speak more crepes but they're so  good  can't stress enough  Yes you're probably over paying few bucks but probably shouldn't all time anyway your cholesterol sake     Vegas!  Delicious crepes friendly staffers lots room chill  Perfect vastly improvement needed Aria  <EOR> When Vegas past May finally try place say bit disappointed I mean prices higher normal pastry places because Vegas can't really fault them that  However pastry coffee mediocre  chocolate cake thing dry heck!   The only upside place open 24 hours your sugar fix anytime  <EOR> Oh man macaroons but stayed crepes    The macaroons probably some best ever crepes right delishness  suggest coming here    Down side price lines lack seating  <EOR> Their extravagant looking confections pastries tendency draw visitors in   certainly case several years ago when visited location inside Bellagio   second time stopped newer location inside Aria but first time purchased something   While buddies losing hard earned wages gaming devices eye candy dealers decided indulge another sort eye candy taking mid day break snapping photos Christmas themed confections http www yelp com biz_photos P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q sitting down iced mocha http www yelp com biz_photos P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg slice cake   I chose Opera cake slice http www yelp com biz_photos P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA made liqueur soaked sponge cake coffee butter cream chocolate ganache because seemed safer selection any other 20+ varieties individual cakes tarts napoleons mousses really needed shot caffeine staying late previous night catching z's hours passed   normally coffee drinker but turn rather instant energy products   Maybe because choice safe but cake slice did wow all   flavors all meshed together quite well but no particular component dessert gave any oomph  just sweet slice cake really nothing special it   cocoa covered truffle sat atop cake unusually thick shell center wasn't smooth sensuous some mass produced truffles sampled   actually enjoyed bitterness cold iced mocha more did cake   Maybe better way   Next time Las Vegas walk past beautiful desserts know treat treat other eye candy   better sample no matter delicious tantalizing seem be! <EOR> Google Now phone showed 4 star Yelp review went  disappointed  try specific cranky because see lots high marks    Ham egg cheese sandwich $10 bust  Velveeta? three slices Wonder Bread? Gross   Chocolate croissant  stale almost no chocolate   The ultimate insult  espresso cardboard cup   Granted display cases look magnificent maybe made to order crepes better  But $30 brekkie two amounts school lunch line serious no no  <EOR> Way overrated  Sure sundae looked cool but didn't taste good nor worth price tag  Employees very unenthusiastic slow  Tables cleared trays trash peoples leftovers    Disappointed all really say  <EOR> Pretty expensive just dessert pastries but hey everything expensive Vegas  location better Bellagio hard find hidden near where all conference rooms at  bigger much easier find   Love different stations everything  admit pastries Macarons other treats die crazy sugar rush just standing sugar store  definitely back more deliciousness  <EOR> Be prepared wait line few minutes if you're getting anything here    All pastries chocolates well everything see looks amazing! just wanted quick coffee almond croissant coffee bit hot if drink black you'll let cool off little before drink it  almond croissant delicious!

Needless say only reason keep going back because love creations  On Saturday 5 yr old son highly allergic nuts  precaution matter habit every time restaurant ask if food contains nuts  did same JPP and first time taken   chocolate mousse looking thing the patisserie shelves almost empty some items did any name tags them while placing order asked if any nuts  supervisor says don't guarantee anything    strangest answer ever heard  Well no planet guarantee anything but since pastry doesn't name tag since guys made perhaps tell if nuts? Now guy gets extremely irritated tells curt tone no no nuts but cant guarantee anything   Needless say very upset attitude but wanting disappoint 5yr old mousse left  first time 10 yrs husband left without getting crepe some chocolate dessert himself  <EOR> This place just inviting all sweets just calls come here!  eat some sweets! Long overdue review Vegas trip January 2012     Tried Caramel twist good    Turkey croissant bread flaky yummy stuff inside okay    Dessert yummm just sugar crazy!    Love seeing cake designs too! <EOR> The JP location Aria beautiful inviting    impressed elegance even though suppose cafe style type dining   Everything menu looks good   But looks deceiving   ordered black forest crepes $13 25 tiramisu   crepe okay   huge portion   But disappointing cheese ham mushroom cooked enough crepe served hot!  tiramisu good    wasn't sweet rich well coffee       Overall place overrated  addition price high cafe style dining    would give JP another try but time Bellagio    hope won't disappointed again  <EOR> Yet another awesome establishment inside Aria   didn't try food but did indulge pastries coffee   prepared pay tourist prices here    cheap any means  quality very high service great   particularly enjoyed place because allowed grab without having worry dressed     Their cheesecake gelatos no brainer  <EOR> The pastry really good!

Based recommendation already knew wanted but would frustrating  Seating suck well  being said crepe made fresh order presented beautifully   display cases gorgeous packed full every type pastry confection your heart and hungover stomach could possibly desire  <EOR> I stopped while ago while staying Aria business   walked past patisserie when headed rooms brightness area along cakes really caught eye  next morning whenever craving some coffee decided head down fiancé each one   Whenever down able see multi tiered cakes close truly amazing!  made wonder long took them   short wait made front line ordered two Americanos only watch them punch something into machine spot them out   $10 cost really hoping barista take minute pull shots   coffee itself decent but great   The bottom line would head back again future coffee   However would definitely give try if looking baked good  <EOR> Came quest gelato   did gelato and some macaroons since looked beautiful    somewhat gelato connoisseur only so so Jean Philippe   delicious satisfied craving but did live hype top 10 gelato   ultimately settled scoop Creme Brûlée Cookies Cream random craving    Creme Brûlée similar tiramisu caramel sweetness little more cream typical gelato and therefore higher fat content usual 6 8%    Cookies Cream average vanilla gelato cookie pieces swirled in   If back would Creme Brûlée again but Cookies Cream   20+ flavors time try few until find delectable need have  <EOR> I tried eat ice cream visit   It also popular  I ate cappuccino ice cream unbelievably tasty   The staff very good good   We took pictures polar bear model dolls beside getting ice cream recommend place <EOR> I visited 4 patisseries Jean Philippe Amore Bouchon Payard during 4 day visit Las Vegas them all   tried 4 pastries all wonderful Carrot Cake moist cake surrounded centimeter coconut buttercream frosting trimmed white chocolate Mille Feuille perfect vanilla custard puff pastry topped fresh raspberries Raspberry Macaron Large parisian macaron filled fresh raspberries custard hint lavender  favorite finally slice flan no  flan Mexican restaurants but rather perfect vanilla custard baked buttery crust  yum     I also visited Jean Philippe Bellagio   same pastries but presentation attractive Aria's one   Aria's Jean Philippe feel kid candy store   recommendation Buy everything share your companions wonderful tour pastries! <EOR> To die nutella strawberry crepe!

I also sampled handful rather unremarkable chocolate truffles  would only recommend fruit jellies which absolute must if you're fan fruity chocolate! may appear dubious but blueberry jelly hands down BEST piece chocolate ever had  Unlike bland chocolatey ness other truffles jam  which closer ultra rich syrup consistency  packed huge fresh blueberry flavor thickly layered atop white chocolate infused mascarpone cream wrapped thin dark chocolate shell perfectly proportioned bite fruity tartness intense cocoa creamy sweetness  wish ordered 10 more these! <EOR> Some Best Desserts earth   selection 2nd none   Chocolates melt your mouth   Coffees typical  torts sticky buns just ok   If your looking chocolate fix  place   gelato fresh variety good  <EOR> Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 Los Angeles #23 #365  If you're looking Vegas experience seductive desserts suggest Jean Philippe Patisserie inside Aria casino  craving some dessert didn't want pay arm leg strip some sweets  MyVegas page bought Crepe coupon 10 000 points ended saving myself $10!

Banana favorite flavor recommend everyone try least one   Overall would stop everyday Vegas again future  bunch other items still would love try  thing kinda bothered but didn't ruin experience some employees working registers n such very friendly miserable demeanor them if don't really care dealing customers  Put smile your face least look if happy goodness sake! lol  <EOR> Having gunnies book world record doesn't help when can't even prepare cake less 24 hours <EOR> I came many times! buying gifts trying food but mostly gifts tried them  many things buy but they're all labeled you'll catch yourself asking this? lot  reviews different products    1  Gelato Coconut pistachio mango Meh    sweet rich  Half  scoop enough sweets junkie  Also pistachio hardly tasted pistachio  2 scoops 1 scoop friend = $9ish    2  Carrot cupcake very weird  baked cup some kind divider top topped dome shaped frosting  tasty though  They complimentary candles if need them   aware look cupcakes walk pass them without even knowing   3  Chocolate mousse Very rich but expect? mousse!  cupcake mousse = $13    4  Marshmallows because bf loves marshmallows try because $22!!!

Really enjoyed tiramisu flavor!  In addition gelato also crepes smoothies breakfast pastries chocolates small mini desserts   Excellent location right next elevators grab something bring your room enjoy heading day  <EOR> Much larger location Bellagio     Love pastries would pass chocolate crepes    other places dessert this     no   Rather going starbuck getting something anywhere else suck just buy some  <EOR> Lovely pastries coffee   prices made sweet older midwestern couple ahead freak out   $16 croissant coffee? <EOR> This girl sweet tooth place friend heaven   visited twice day wasn't disappointed!  first time dark chocolate mint truffle then nutella brioche   AMAZING!  overly priced either   great part Aria just chill people watch listen music enjoy great eats  <EOR> I feel bad   passed Jean Philippe Patisserie inside ARIA countless times but never tried tried them until last trip Vegas   always knew some awesome sweets desserts sold various types pastries croissants   However if known paninis good would come much sooner!  Although aren't always busy there's usually crowd Sunday mornings   friends lot people drop grab something relatively quick before heading airport   However don't scared off line may look bad but actually moves rather steadily   Finding seats when they're busy other hand little tough   While couple secured table buddy helped order PROSCIUTTO PANINI $11    looked good menu Cured Italian Ham Basil Aioli Buffalo Mozzarella Basil Tomatoes but tasted even better   Prosciutto mozzarella two favorites but really liked aioli bread perfectly buttered toasted   little messy eat it drips but delicious!  Based sandwich alone Jean Philippe Patisserie easily worth FOUR HALF STARS but rounded down because price   good portion just little light money   Still beats food prices airport though   Now just way back try some sweeter treats! <EOR> Food good but expensive   Also chocolate croissant closer plain croissant very nice gave different but same result   put 2 choc chips whole thing its absurd <EOR> I didn't try chocolates review just paninis macaron    I sweet basil chicken chicken tandoori sandwiches  Both good but basil really good  Greasy though most paninis are    Macarons good    Really pricey all but guess  Vegas  <EOR> Walked past place stop by  friend shared triple chocolate mousse cake  best mousse cake ever! white chocolate mousse milk chocolate mousse dark chocolate covering half it  tiny green macaron top  BEST EVER  highly recommend place! <EOR> Ton selections choose from  Decided lime     tart? beautifully presented caught eye!  Anywho yummy but did hard sugar piece atop dessert  SWEET  took off  Overall inside dessert good presentation good   full execution? Needs worked out  Thing liked most awesome napkins took few home! Hahahha  <EOR> Get crepes! They're bomb!

I also came another time gelato  pretty good  best but still good  <EOR> Located front ARIA's elevators guest rooms Jean Phillippe offers BIG salad three forum varieties  combined croissant sandwich feeds two very well  Prices good location allows people watching   Yes spectacular sweets but also excellent luncheon fare    Please note some visitors clear tables twice two visits   may need hustle something off good spot yourself grab but it   STRONGLY SUGGEST Play MyVegas points used all sorts things including something HERE  free gaming purpose! <EOR> This place expensive really good  sure why reviews good maybe people eating pastries while drunk winning lots money?  Shared  almond croissant super sweet kinda soggy nutella brioche probably best thing but small kinda dry vegetable quiche just ok 2 large coffee tall coffees starbucks  $26 total which kinda lot but suppose confirms theory everything Vegas overpriced    Anyways if staying Aria its bad place some pastries but wouldn't way come here  <EOR> Shut  The  Front  Door   You need try savory crepes breakfast anytime day   sure rest menu delicious but still dreaming Forrest Crepe over easy gooey egg top   Seriously best crepes ever had!

It's such dangerous shop right next guest elevator! <EOR> I loved it  Everything loved it  But last day placed order pastries while paid all them    two missing  Tisk tisk  <EOR> This place decadent  Everything screams sweet elegance  interior if could call that beautiful  While no walls closing off dining area casino metallic arches encompass enough provide some separation  desserts seem match overall design restaurant really quite beautiful   I decided try tiramisu favorite desserts  perfectly portioned exact combination creaminess coffee like  ladyfingers well soaked seemed if little pool coffee left bottom  moist astoundingly delicious  highly recommend it    I also tried chocolate cheesecake  spending moment figuring actually consume dessert found tasty but lacking overall excitement tiramisu  creaminess expected but flavor comparable any other garden variety cheesecake  while presentation unique difficult eat  instance perhaps function over form would preferable    I would love return Jean Philippe sample crepes  Unfortunately wait until next trip Vegas  am happy stopped before leaving though  great place grab something satisfy sweet tooth  <EOR> Gelato fantastic!!  pastries good them Paris   four tried loved Cheese Danish some kinda flaky vanilla pastry   world! <EOR> I love Jean Philippe Patiserrie Bellagio only natural would fall love bigger better newer version Aria! place amazing! vast number desserts choose any heart skip beat!  I came breakfast they don't call sin city nothing! gotta live up! few friends stood line 10 minutes until made cases upon cases delicious desserts  opted raspberry macaroon trio cheese cake milk white dark chocolate cheese cake oreo cracker crust incased white chocolate topped milk chocolate truffle scrumptious nutella cake thingy sorry more descriptive look pictures see why distracted   All desserts scrumptious especially nutella cake!  Bottom line best  breakfast  ever  love Vegas! <EOR> Gelato good   particularly rocky road! Overall though found quality chocolate better Max Brenner  also nice place hit breakfast because killer iced coffee  <EOR> Holy Crap just move here?  Stayed Aria few nights needed light breakfast  patisserie right next guest room elevators quite convenient decided give try    I ordered ham cheese croissant which hands down best ham cheese croissant ever had  also something called Chocolate Intense  Wow! Just wow! amazing very well named   Later day checking bill front desk discussed couple Aria's restaurants him  When Jean Philippe Patisserie came he recommended almond croissant  guess breakfast next day? equally awesome  also bought muffin cookie road home  Both massively yummy   Also plenty seating  Considering number people thought would hard time finding place sit but quickly found seat despite constant flow people didn't see anyone struggle find seat   Okay now downside  little expensive but expect 5 star Vegas resort  ham cheese croissant chocolate intense large soda cost over $20  resort credit didn't care  credit might docked them star but considering location good complaining   Also service leaves little desired  While fast enough weren't friendly all when people asked questions seemed more little put answering them   Still food good give them 5 stars  <EOR> Barely drinkable espresso servers wish really weren't but beautiful display pastries   Located bowels Aria Casino drink espresso eat B pastries amongst slot machines smoke  <EOR> Overpriced some mediocre fancy chocolates  worth spending money on  Godiva Hershey's  <EOR> I really sweet tooth can't say actually eaten any treats JPP offer but am writing review because am pretty sure coffee BEST EVER!!  I really needed pick stopped JPP order something strong  decided large iced white chocolate mocha extra shot espresso  Now cheap coffee don't expect any McDonald's $1 menu prices  extra shot espresso alone more $2   There seemed issue coffee machine young man making drink step away complete order  quite bit delay which good when someone dire need coffee LOL but when he returned he sincerely apologized mentioned he wouldn't charge extra shot since waited long   Now seriously most delicious coffee had  am just saying because desperate need caffeine    The staff all great put lot love into everything make  eyes those crepes definitely back maybe even something sweet! <EOR> Jean Jean oh Jean!!
