What  The  Hell? know people order water seem cheap but can't normal glass some ice? Other people soda normal glasses ice  Since thirsty down cup never refilled  which pretty bad when everything you're eating salty    Then while half way through meal she came while eating asked if I'd order anything else HANDED BILL  What?

Apparently  way soba noodles are  I just expecting more flavor   tempura mix fried rice came meal very flavorful presentation plating ALL food fantastic   Just because fan soba noodles per se doesn't mean thing  you should check some authentic Japanese eats  <EOR> I confession make  Before visiting I Naba hadn't eaten soba noodles nearly two years   I've thinking but really trying look for finding places eat soba Vegas when heard good things I Naba decided drop lunch   It's cute casual little place  easy find corner Desert Inn Decatur  potted plants lining outside scattered throughout inside which seem very natural neighborhood friendly  way tables set very eclectic lacking straight line formation most restaurants use   The waitress very helpful friendly  particularly appreciated fact she didn't judge smelling everything just seemed amused quirks  Thank kind waitress  tipped well   The menu simple neat little info cards all tables describing nutritional value components soba noodles  Now talking about! Love much   I could describe every aspect I Naba word for word   Except soba noodles  can't quite describe it  All say noodles perfectly firm dipping broth mild but somehow maintains its flavor  batteru combo came cold soba four pieces pressed mackerel sushi  normally don't mackerel but just soft delicious   When finished meal waitress gave sobayu the water used cook soba which mix dipping broth drink soup  sobayu its own smelled very sweet fragrant  literally sat inhaled steam good few minutes where waitress seemed amused   resulting soup all kinds amazing    Leaving I Naba felt full but overly full usually eating restaurant  refreshing change  <EOR> I Naba favorites places soba buckwheat noodles  Last time hot soba noodles mushrooms spinach other vegetables along yam paste which helps consistency noodle  service fast restaurant clean quaint    They play pleasant instrumental oldies music Beatles etc  which appreciate   hidden mall 15 minutes Strip but worth going  <EOR> After week eating great restaurants Vegas   this place probably served most favorite meal  Sometimes more simple things what's best  cold noodles perfect such hot day  tempura fried perfectly  miso eggplant appetizer amazing  yourself favor eat here! won't sorry! Delicious!!! <EOR> This chain west coast serves fresh made soba udon Although chain very authentic quality food  Nowadays very difficult find authentic japanese food place gem! noodle itself bit thinner standard udon  noodles bit bland compared usual udon package came lunch goood  lunch set ranges $12 $15  shrimp tempura udon which came salmon sashimi  roe over rice  such hearty meal  <EOR> As frequent visitor Vegas learned early all balance when comes food  If you've just stuffed your face buffet last thing want eat something fried greasy  wife venture off Strip since mood some soba noodles found cozy spot   We both opted cold soba noodles  perfect refreshing hot day  both veggie tempura couple bucks more also shrimp tempura  When food arrived entire tray looked fantastic  However once started eating found ourselves wanting more   Clearly star attraction soba noodles  aren't your typical store bought soba noodles usually darker grey color  soba noodles lighter color tiny little specks throughout each noodle  firm almost chewy consistency balanced well cold broth    Along delicate contrasting crunch tempura everything tasted okay  But yet something missing  can't quite figure  meal seemed lack any soul if sense    At any rate just seemed $25 ordered bit skimpy  still somewhat hungry  Then again wasn't wanted? Something light healthy counter balance smorgasbord buffet night before? Perhaps just spoiled Fukada Irvine CA  <EOR> One best Japanese restaurants LV   gem near china town  multiple times  Everything high quality meticulously crafted  Sashimi bowls delicious healthy Most time Chirashi bowl assorted sashimi  Add half portion soba noodles yourself very complete meal    Try Battera appetizer   Outstanding    Love place! <EOR> I Naba always list new restaurants try out  finally made last weekend  hot humid day Vegas eating cold soba seemed right thing do! arrived shortly opened lunch  seated right away only 2 other parties restaurant    They simple 2 page menu  ordered cold Zaru Soba  husband ordered same along Katsu Don  soba noodles thin cooked perfectly not hard soft   dipping sauce refreshing made just right very salty but bland either  good wish portion size bigger but guess can't wrong $8  If looking eat light definitely good place! husband liked soba well  He liked Katsu Don but did put lot green onions it  Ewww  disappointed no longer Green Tea Trio dessert  server told long time ago when chef dedicated only making desserts  But anymore  ordered green tea ice cream husband ordered Shiratama Anmitsu  Normally don't really care green tea ice cream but actually very good  green tea flavor wasn't overpowering usually everywhere else  light tasted more sorbet    I most food freshly made in house  servers very polite friendly attentive well  think only bad thing place hours  never understood why restaurants would want close few hours between lunch dinner  serious business being turned away LOL! Regardless try back more often sure  <EOR> Like said before  Las Vegas INABA location cannot compare Torrance California  said before people Las Vegas morbidly uncultured    I still believe two chicks work best when comes customer service work very hard         But listen very closely because something say INABA        INABA LAS VEGAS recently gotten liquor license  Unfortunately resulted tragedy anyone proud Japanese lineage   other night came back INABA find packed hipsters emos scene kids Wine Cheese people  Everyone piss drunk shouting idiots  sophisticated Japanese fine dining atmosphere raped sodomized drunk Vegas douchebaggery   things worse huge group Wine Cheese people doing nothing but shouting racist jokes sexual references    Japanese women very polite tend just ignore things  exactly waitresses did  didn't understand drunk white dudes kept walking into kitchen every couple minutes  guy somehow associated business?   The positive thing situation noodles actually tasted better during recent visit  zaru soba tasted made fresh morning  texture very chewy length noodles very long  vegetable tempura kind cold time though    I don't think ever coming back INABA because become new Ichiza  INABA well Vegas  only wish best owner  But doesn't need help support LV Japanese American community anymore mainly due fact hipsters made drinking spot now  <EOR>
