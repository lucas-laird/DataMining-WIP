Cheers! <EOR> The concept Harvest great  Being Southern California lot farm table restaurants eat at  menu Harvest simple small bites bring table side fun idea  execution Harvest however lacking  4 different cocktails none enjoyed ours  poke underwhelming  truffle fries miss thick cut borderline sogginess  gave them second star concept did hit flat bread  combination pork goat cheese peach really good  Overall total disappointment when come Vegas ready pay high prices Wowed flavors  somewhere else  <EOR> Excellent place novel farm table food! cocktails also great  Would highly recommend sticking small plates snack wagon best food value  would also recommend briscuit brussel sprouts ferrel pouridge everything snack wagon  Each excellent ingredients come together really well  fish day dissapointingly small four small pieces sasbimi scallop large plate only three medium scallops  All cocktails looked awesome  apple rye delicious  bar area doesn't require reservation access full food menu watch bartenders drinks  Service fast friendly   highly recommend place!! <EOR> The positives visit last night wait staff oysters ahi tuna which sashimi special night   oysters really amazing   She ordered ahi tuna ordered aged ribeye steak  She enjoyed tuna  Overall really disappointed  Ordering steak place really big mistake   aged ribeye caught eye  $60 steak no sides absolutely nothing special it  thinnest cut ever seen paying kind money   wasn't seasoned overall something would breakfast steak some eggs   also made big mistake ordering version Manhattan few sips couldn't drink anymore  chocolate drinking very rich liqueur   She negroni cocktail similarly way sweet cross between cough syrup liqueur   place very loud well     So order oysters but avoid steaks!!  would stay away specialty cocktails  <EOR> So many great restaurants Vegas both off Strip   menu description Harvest really sounded interesting focus farm table locally sources foods   In hind sight should more skeptical aren't many farms Las Vegas  restaurant isn't farm table? would alternative farm warehouse table?  guess don't understand significance farm table thought simply implied fresh   In any event restaurant located Bellagio nice but great ambiance  However service exceptional   Very attentive prompt    The food very good no complaints  chicken both risotto dishes asparagus brussels sprouts all very good   some other dishes well bad bunch   I very disappointed spending over $700 dinner would validate $9 parking fee   would probably think twice going back principle   many good restaurants Vegas feel your being jamed that   comp people if drop $500 slot machine little courtesy if eat restaurants?  Can't blame food people bad policy  <EOR> I wanting try restaurant ever since discovering replaced Sensi  ate Sensi three times all three times outstanding!!! felt crying when heard awesome restaurant history  I super excited learn same chef helm  Sensi also executive chef Harvest  When made reservation through OpenTable mentioned celebrating 15th wedding anniversary  hostess wished happy anniversary but nothing else mentioned  When celebrated wedding anniversary husband's birthday twice Sensi treated beautiful dish three flavors sorbet gorgeous ice carving lit candle! At Harvest both ordered diver scallops because awesome when Sensi  delicious Harvest well  For amount charge everything restaurant plus parking worth it  decided let tourists support Strip now content visit favorite restaurants northwest corner valley less hassle more value  <EOR> This place amazing!

Fan fuckin tastic! <EOR> Wow! place pretty amazing  Harvest relatively new when told friends coming didn't much reaction  dining though would highly recommend anyone looking quality dining experience Vegas   First there's cart push your table where order small tidbits like dimsum cart all $7 during harvest hour 5 6pm 9 10pm nightly   then mark small card many plates order add your total bill end meal   Also during harvest hour specialty cocktails half off! fruit infused vodka which equivalent two drinks price higher but still 50% off    I tried poke beef skewers both delicious but if choose I'd poke  Then roasted octopus appetizer diver scallops main course  Both cooked seasoned deliciously  octopus came sea asparagus which never before but crispy succulent combined blistered tomatoes lemon dish pretty memorable  friend lamb chops she pleased selection guessing can't really wrong any choices menu! <EOR> Harvest far best dining experiences ever had  moment walk greeted warm rustic atmosphere extremely friendly staff  mention space itself gorgeous! love open restaurant is    I really impressed knowledgeable waitress menu origin food  farm to table concept she explained different anything seen especially Vegas  waitress also made some great recommendations those party unsure order    The menu split into two sections social plates large plates  Everything meant shared could when everything looks delicious? also cart called Snack Wagon around restaurant additional small bites  tried Steak Tartare amazing! also tried Duck Confit Buns delicious well  can't wait come back try more Harvest offer! <EOR> Modern restaurant good service  Social plates small good share  tapas  back experience similar   Eating bar also good option bartenders friendly helpful menu  <EOR> Mediocre best  service terrible    business guest I waited 15 20 minutes sat down greeted    another 15 minutes water another 15 minutes order cocktail  then proceeded order $55 seafood appetizer which waste money mostly 'fishy' tasting wasn't much it    would think $55 would big enough 4 5 people hardly enough two us  would give entrées 5 10    flavor wasn't again way overpriced  don't mind paying premium nice meal good service but place missed mark  recommend it  <EOR> I really can't praise restaurant enough think pretty high standards living San Francisco which essentially mecca farm to table fresh ingredients concept  But treat coming gem heart Las Vegas! came twice during week town CES ended being able sample almost all menu    My favs? Those veggies tho! Brussels sprouts cauliflower worth two servings each because no wasn't sharing! Duck confit mini bunz? Nope all mines!   And love little cart concept reminiscent favorite place SF State Bird Provisions but much smaller scale  cart eggplant caviar puree right into mouth anytime!

Filet Mignon delicious however best had  Finish your meal treat beautiful sweet wagon delights   Service could better server disappeared couple times took while bill  definitely return when Vegas  <EOR> The food fresh flavorful but 5 stars worth  coconut carrot soup very good risotto pretty good truffle fries very good Brussels sprouts very good  Prices reasonable strip  would dine Harvest again  <EOR> So glad sister decided birthday dinner here!! enjoyed dinner great! great customer service greeted immediately seated very quickly  tried rib eye steak lamb which die for!
