Opted water instead  Ordered every dish happy hour menu except quesadilla  Portions seemed itty bitty unless just super hungry day dark couldn't see other half plate  best thing steak tostadas which sweet red cabbage slaw it  potatoes good but just roasted potatoes spices sour cream hm    potato really worth $4?  For having many customers 1 other table bar area 1 table regular restaurant area service S   L     O   W    I overheard other table combine groupon living social coupon happy hour specials  other discount   Overall trying once enough  <EOR> I happened Vegas long place opened up   Having spent some time Southern Spain definitely looking forward trying place out   If sign text alerts website some pretty decent discounts   two for one unlimited tapas deal   tapas very tasty service very good   waiter good sense humor   even complimentary tapa top all stuff ordered   sangria very refreshing   would definitely hit place again  <EOR> A friend mine restaurant tonight   When guest arrived number dining tables open at least five    host front which also owner asked if could wait bar 10 minutes before getting seated   She also suggested grab cocktail   thought awkward considering open tables   Nonetheless wasn't problem easy didn't mind waiting long table     Twenty five minutes later still waiting bar table  still open tables!!! hostess owner passed twice no updates   Another family come seated before well   give idea experience friend felt waiting outside club trying in   worse trying Marquee   guest frustrated left   Unfortunately never come back   In case wondering dressed appropriately previous customers that several employees recognized even said hi   <EOR> We great girls night here!  Decided try because groupon   sat bar practically alone   resturant old Ruth Chris very nice inside kinda felt bad talking having tapas sangria people dining room probably trying enjoy fine dining?  Small menu doesn't compare firefly sorry but still sangria tasty   tried both white red preferred red   bartenders awesome say    ordered pitchers red sangria he nice enough bring samples white   sangria house least bottle   food good    more greek influences Spanish   Some favorites EBrussel sprouts Lamb Sliders Shrimp Ceviche Steak Kabobs Gambas al ajillo Empanadas  When DJ came ended staying great time   new bartender Brandon came shift he awesome!  Very friendly took care us    Overall crowded Firefly close home me    back <EOR> If want best Marbella experience visit beautifully designed website then stop there  Marbella crafts perfectly mediocre unimaginative tapas  thrice foresee fourth visit although stuffed mushrooms enjoyable enough  paella particularly bad dry tasteless   service decor both passable  safe just pass place all together  <EOR> What nice time   heard first through Groupon read other reviews try   first experience remarkable   hostess treat she warm inviting sunshine service responsive yet over bearing   food very good over priced   If any negative   I would bit more description menu several questions server did even know some things were   He did descriptions chef   Just saw another Groupon although just last week jumped it  Check out     worth it  <EOR> We Marbella because locals just happen see while driving always looking new tapas place besides Firefly  little concerned when first walked because only customers  quickly learned place only open 2 weeks  atmosphere beautiful soft lighting great lounge music playing  waiter very nice accommodating when asked if any way he could find candle table! ordered four different appetizers just taste would favorites  shrimp ceviche best ever calamari most incredible sauce! only didn't really care empanadas  owner came over presented 2 free signature drinks Marbella kiss introduced himself thanked coming which thought really nice!! All all great atmosphere great location right next palms great service really good food! say local restaurant should support! <EOR> HORRIBLE SERVICE good food cheap prices but damn management needs overhaul place ASAP it'll end Ruth Chris <EOR> Had great meal  Started house Tempernillo wine which great  bartender said try Brussel Sprouts did  crazy good!   I come again when am back Vegas  <EOR> First off some reviews point Firefly don't expect same thing  twice now  First time waiter named Rasberry least attentitive waiters ever had  When return restaurant hoping same waiter good thing  second time girl named Chancy  improvement huge one  She awesome  Took time explain recommend  tried empanadas brussels both excellent  Also cevich prety good few skewers The rice dish served side excellent  think only thing did care salad comes some meals  Th dressing kind bitter tangy something else did some spice  But all all prety decent place  Much more subdued quiet Firefly but fills own niche  <EOR> I've wanting try restaurant since saw chef cooking demonstration Whole Foods which included Shrimp Ceviche Manchego Mac Cheese   Both delicious   I came Tuesday night around 6 30  8 people entire restaurant which large elegantly decorated   seated immediately hostess     Once sat waiter introduced himself asked if wanted drink   ordered Cava husband glass red wine   selection glass simple but well thought out   According waiter some technical difficulties drinks   am quite sure since only eight people entire restaurant should hard bartender pop cork use corkscrew  Nonetheless drinks first tapa   I format menu offering small medium large plates which cost $6 $9 $16 respectively   price points encourage diners try several dishes but if mood share most medium plates sizeable enough single persons meal   addition menu offers charcuterie platters paella      The first several tapas started off promising but husband both felt beef dishes over cooked using tough cheap meat even came cold   chorizo cheese empanadas good but hey anything fried good however very chorizoey    beef tacos OK    little dry bland dish would pass next time if ever back   Gambas al Ajillo probably best dish but white shrimp does lack flavor overall no heat dish despite chili oil ingredient   steak kabobs missing didn't enough red wine demi counteract dry chewiness meat    carne asada salad decent portion but again meat dry chewy Luckily dressing add moisture   According chef during Whole Food demonstration desserts made in house husband ordered coconut flan   husband said superb bite   it definitely well made definitely highlight meal    Will back probably not   However all fairness think many more signature dishes didn't try which could potentially swayed feel differently   Some other reviewers comparing Marbella Firefly's which don't think equal comparison but if think Marbella won comparison hands down  <EOR> The food isn't horrible but pretty underwhelming compared other options Spanish fare town  prices also tad whack  example Chorizo Filet stuffed Mushrooms medium plate cost $9 00 but three mushrooms smaller golf ball  don't know waitress dropped table straight face    The service polite but definitely slow paced  itself isn't bad thing  just something should know before coming in  <EOR> We ate finding deal eBay through Vegas4locals  ate dinner Saturday night 9 8 12  server attentive food served quickly  prices reasonable red wine Sangria yummy  bit trek because never ventured off Strip before but worth short taxi ride dinner walked over Palms  hope Marbella's business picks able stay around years come nice dinner experience  <EOR> I found place groupon when walked thought place nicely put together even though person did sound polite when made reservation over phone  Food blend over priced  $9 3 little stuffed mushrooms  buns lamb sliders burnt  better  Water refilled even once during dinner  back ever again  only reason even two stars because place looked nice  <EOR> From 4 00 6 30 pm Happy Hour bar area features select $2 99 tapas addition drink specials  also received special 2 for 1 promotion via text message restaurant seemed ideal time check Vegas's newest tapas bar   I'm sure why bar almost empty $5 mojito delicious deal during happy hour plenty fresh lime mint flavor  ordered few items off happy hour menu addition calamari mixed ceviche off regular tapas menu  tapas concept size plates seemed rather confused  fried calamari large plate comparable order any other restaurant  looked odd next ceviche which served small plate same size cup sauce served calamari  husband ceviche connoisseur thought ceviche could use just touch more spice but pleased overall  coca vegetariana new dish me  Spanish style pizza came topped plenty mushrooms best Happy Hour tapa tried  disappointed traditional tortilla española essential dish judging authenticity any tapas bar  bland bit dry texture potatoes onions lost   Marbella good better any off Strip tapas joint terms food quality prices very accessible  atmosphere upscale more Spanish flair flamenco music menu  trying more authentic Firefly  really appreciate focus music touches Spanish culture  happy hour definitely worth checking but feel may sampled best dishes offer  Stop some sangria paella papas bravas just may transported Spain  <EOR> Delicious little hidden treasure   If looking eating establishment where virtually everything menu must try? Where bartenders just your average drink slingers but true mixologists? Then Marbella your place!  Why less 5 stars ask? Because its strip mall busy flamingo  Lame reason perhaps but traffic poor curb appeal huge reasons some want skip trying some place new all together   All all food just all if it delicious if mood calls tapas zero location restrictions happy visit Marbella again  <EOR> 3 stars only because Vegas needs least more tapas place   The most exciting thing GREAT atmosphere lovely music  DJ  spinning fantastic house Latin flair My concerns it 1  kitchen closed know fact some people did stay because it    2  sangria which bartender literally made front some wine juice really quick soda fruits top   Fireflys lets wine absorb fruits 5 days before serve customers  flavor comes whole point   Just saying back? Absolutely! Because always give people places second and last chance! <EOR> Oh gosh   Wine Canvas event friend Amy held here   First all thanks free sangria checking Yelp   awesome  white sangria favorite though both red white   Here's had Huevos Estrallados 2 over medium eggs chorizo string fries Chorizo Filet stuffed mushrooms Hummus Tahini served pita chips Smoked Tuna Sashimi  The prices during happy hour amazing   regular costs small plates $6 medium plates $9 large plates $16   didn't any large plates but small medium well portioned     The Huevos Estrallados DIE FOR   wish some right now   hummus very yummy smooth garlic y   Tuna delicious Chorizo stuffed mushrooms lovely though only 3 which thought little lite     Service ok bit snobby but bad   Great ambiance   would definitely come back food amazing  <EOR>    really GREAT place!  it energy old ruth chris which previously housed @this location west flamingo nightclub lounge feel! great happy hour 4pm 7pm reverse happy hour starting @11pm! foodie food! <EOR> Came wife Groupon  server asked if ever sangria told never had  She brought 2 samples each  Really nice  placed orders sat waited  Marbella fries nothing special but once seafood paella wonderful  thought best thing tried long time  many wonderful flavors  food served waitress hard back table  Paying check difficult  turn off but back because paella delish! <EOR> This yet another tapas place recently popped Vegas    intrigued being old Ruth's Chris building assuming would nice inside   nice inside although managed little uglier adding lot unnecessary fake flower plant things walls   still nice environment though    Yay free drink Yelp Check in!

She awesome even if she lost voice  restaurant ask Chancy order Ahi  Truly winning combo!  P S  Chancy hope enjoyed pumpkin cake! <EOR> I groupon Marbella while ago excited finally use it  friend came eat dinner 6 Sunday wasn't busy  seated given menu  then waited 5 10 minutes water then another 10 minutes order I wasn't sure waiter just asked while lady take order    The food fantastic! ordered shrimp ceviche lamb sliders shrimp kabobs Brussel sprouts which best ever had   then decided order two more items complete groupon  She ordered Greek salad without feta she's allergic ordered calamari  salad came small bits feta decided just take home  another 15 minutes waiting asked waitress just wrap calamari take home well  home excited piece two calamari open box its melty chocolate ice cream mess  Specifically didn't ask dessert now am craving calamari Great food but unfortunately service left something desired  <EOR> The food super yummy great service guitar player roamed around restaurant amazing  great date night here  <EOR> I came once before gave place 4 stars but time 5 star experience   far dining ordered Fried Calamari $9 Ahi Tuna Daurade $16 2 Beef Tacos $6 Lamb Beef Sliders $9  In total food $40 which perfect purchased $20 $40 Groupon before arriving   ahi tuna last time think order dish every time dine here   simply perfect ahi tuna   Good size perfectly cooked seasoned   Honestly steal $16   other dishes delicious well jalepenos calamari nice surprise sweet potato fries came sliders   But 5* experience really came bartender Ryan   buddy Tim originally asked server Riesling wines he didn't know answer Ryan came over chat us   He let Tim try two different Rieslings discussed merits each   When he settled which Ryan returned only glass wine but two samplers sangria red white  ate chatted bit more Ryan scotches specialty cocktails we'll definitely coming back see Ryan capable of  <EOR> This restaurant closed  Just refund travelZoo  <EOR> Make no mistake Marbella no Firefly  If keep mind simple rule manage your expectations accordingly perfectly tasty meal good time   After enjoyable rather wild Elite event wife decided return late night happy hour tapas sangria  sangria served wine decanter doesn't come close Firefly's but gets job done  could improved adding lots fresh fruit decanter instead small bit put glass   The food hit or miss  chorizo empanadas delicious shrimp ceviche well shrimp ceviche  gambas al ajillo enjoyable but much its Firefly counterpart  far biggest disappointment Marbella fries  sound incredibly flavorful menu's description but actual product huge letdown  Perhaps because late night run fresh potatoes but fries obviously store bought frozen product barest amount truffle oil cheese added   Marbella off good start  some tweaks drinks food great neighborhood tapas bar  <EOR> A Groupon certificated but food bring back again     We sampled many different tapas all wonderful   particularly enjoyed Cauliflower dish cabbage cashews   good ordered multiple plates   While arrived early seated right away when left wait list   good idea reservation  <EOR> First time really surprised find such elegant restaurant inside strip mall  hear old Ruth Chris's see that    We greeted several staff passing hostess stand when hostess came back she took table  booth booths   Our sever named Dominic say he awesome  Informative honest friendly but professional  pretty much ordered all popular menu items he suggested   Small plates Brussel sprouts which typical cut half sautéed fried Brussel sprout leaves tossed vinaigrette  good different   Cauliflower garbanzo cashews cabbage  Definitely something home but those simple dishes appreciate   French fries    Because Regina's favorite  supposed truffle oil but didn't really smell much but am little sick stuffed up   Medium dishes Ribs cooked 6 days becomes tender meat falls off bone serve boneless  tasty good portion price think  Gambas other medium dish which ok  expecting shrimp prawns  sauce buttery lemon sauce but nothing exciting  Maybe if actually spice sauce instead chili decoration would liked more  Dessert Chocolate torta came banana ice cream walnuts  menu said vanilla but actually liked banana better  don't banana many places which made think made themselves  chocolate cake warm kind gooey but mine oozing out  more warm cake soft center    I would definitely come back would look Dominic server bartender  Also want check happy hour  <EOR> We've 3 times Marbella last 2 months  Mainly because less mile home open late  looking alternative other tapas place become way popular   The good prices decent service attentive food decent  Since don't eat seafood cannot speak but chicken steak skewers tender fall off stick cucumber yogurt jalepeno dip smooth creamy though would liked more cucumber jalepeno less yogurt but  just me  also empanadas tasty but crust little dry boneless baby backs must have lamb sliders  last visit ventured large plate selection tequila chicken lamb chops  Excellent choices  Very attentive staff kept plates pace  would liked better variety small plates dessert but more popular perhaps expand menu   The Bad homemade sangria tasted 3 poured bottle sprite added  Also bar seating comfortable  only high top tables very low ground tables    the Ugly mention website  1st its flash eliminates iphone ipad uses  2nd dark hard read thankfully full menu pdf

place    pretty new <EOR> I recently visited Marbella event recently asked write review restaurant itself voluntarily no extra incentives given    We sampled variety tapas brussel sprouts crab chicken skewers shrimp ceviche empanadas choice beverage I chose red sangria    My favorites brussel sprouts chicken skewers empanadas  couldn't believe quickly food came out  staff servers made sure guests served  definitely plenty around! typically don't brussel sprouts but super tasty delicate   definitely average brussel sprouts  chicken skewers also delicious really liked marinade used cook with  think empanadas winners though   disappeared quick!   Because event consisted very large group people rather loud kinda crowded  guessing non event night venue bit more calm  definitely relaxing romantic vibe place servers very nice accommodating considering fact probably expecting smaller amount people event   I back soon try more things <EOR> Bad  took grandmother introduce tapas  menu good prices agreeable  But service oh service! food came pretty late wasn't flowing tapas normally does  fries noodles first then waited 15 minutes peppers    Then waited 15 minutes macaroni  Think though table 4  ceviche wasn't great food appeared waiting while when it   guac fish tacos started brown little    We didn't even two items  took another 15 minutes written off tab then check  ask 4 times     I'd really give place another shot  But service might killed me   Oh regardless amount customers please don't excuses  other tables looking around servers party didn't any servers either  wondering if people called if service more problem just us  <EOR> Marissa awesome!
