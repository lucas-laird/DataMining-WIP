Roast beef amazing sandwich alone bring back again before leave Vegas   didn't care pizza better   But sandwich easily best had   ordered pizza chips drink roast beef sandwich $20   The veggie sandwich around $8 also great  BLT good well  <EOR> JJ's Paris made real convenient during last stay LV  really liked meat croissant thing had  Almost piroshky   can't remember exactly but super good especially snack during long drive back LA  <EOR> It totally slipped mind review JJ's vegas trip  weird thing skipped over pastries ordered bagel smoked salmon top  $10 definitely overpriced but delicious surprisingly enough full finishing it  Considering price food general Strip I'd say JJ's worth considering nice change pace breakfast  <EOR> If could give zero  I would  Worst effin workers experienced since moving Vegas  I kid u not  First don't order right  Then when sandwich noticed dry   it supposed Dijon mustard advertised  first thought ok no problem let just ask some side  When ask it  the lady no idea saying  Pointing breads saying sandwich    don't know u mistake Dijon mustard  5 minutes trying explain going through mayo other condiments wasn't talking she finally says she just sandwiches   umm  o  k  obviously described menu   then girlfriend asks rolls forgot give her   so another worker hopefully speaks bit English if she say says she didn't give u? No   that's why standing waiting idiot  Then girl asks if she pizza warmed girl says can't its against policy   my girl wasn't having thankfully chef heard told course u just put oven! tone where seemed he wanted call jackass  Any way   stay away place  they can't prepare sandwich describe did horrible  pizza bleu   just don't here   walk FAR AWAY!    <EOR> Have come last few years prosciutto sandwich   changed disappointed   don't little pickles anymore!  best part  bread hard tough time biting without cutting inside mouth  Balsamic glaze really good could've used more it   Arugula fresh   Ok quality prosciutto but lot fat it  Definitely worth $14 but resort credits worked out   would say just OK  <EOR> Two Words    Vanilla Eclair!!  Never leave Vegas without having three     husband took trip Vegas bring back dozen!!!  Yup good!! <EOR> Mediocre food mediocre service high price   Hostess very slow seating customers spent more time socializing coworkers seating customers  $23 breakfast buffet price more George V real Paris cup coffee croissant   place if u r hurry want decent food  Hampton Inn quality food premium price  bad if u r hurry want stuff urself however  <EOR> The sandwiches JJ's pretty good fresh bread ingredients   However  takes long your order   Expect wait least 15 20 minutes   While appreciate attention put into making sandwich please speed process!  even all time ladies took sandwich included onions when specifically asked none   probably back JJ's because frequent Paris Hotel Casino but keep fingers crossed hire more efficient sandwich makers  <EOR> I love love love pizza! 2 slice w sode special $9 99 evry time vegas  order any specialty pizza deal  great if don't want feel stuffed frm buffet  also location  patio style seating usually sit people watch  Great relaxing losing your $ <EOR> Very expensive get   If stay Paris hotel 9$ spend bakery   In good case enough regular coffee small brownie  If want expensive least bring more quality food   Not recommended  <EOR> While staying Paris Hotel stopped breakfast  down little side hallway MUCH BETTER other little french shop right casino part  ordered waffle strawberries mascarpone cheese which very good  boyfriend ordered turkey breast sandwich supposed different bread but he asked french bread instead I would highly recommend because bread really good!   little expensive but most restaurants around area are  However plenty seating quieter because back little farther loud casino  <EOR> great people watching sitting drink while waiting seated le provenal   the gelato refreshing but food junk food side  service slow  <EOR> I used come every year but yes bit disappointed some services don't offer anymore employees kitchen such bad mood almost rude I'd say  <EOR> Stopped hotel some great reuben sandwiches  made fresh tasted very good  tables could eat quite messy cleared off very well  garbages also overflowing  need some basic housekeeping! <EOR> Worst system ever  Avoid breakfast time  Totally messed order  Waited over 50 mins food  Over priced terrible food  $9 peanut butter sandwich!!! <EOR> Very european friendly staff yet professional   prosciutto sandwich favorite!! took back Europe    <EOR> Good pizza very large slices  When something $10 00 two slices which stacked top one another fit plate drink  also good gelato reasonable prices relative Vegas     It probably won't blow your socks off but if want grab something simple fairly cheap lunch good option  <EOR> My boyfriend stopped before seeing afternoon show Paris something quick eat    We shared order roast beef sandwich cheddar cheese vanilla napolean  both large sandwich large dessert sharing wasn't problem  If both eaten individual serving each would much handle    The best thing sandwich incredible bread chewy crispy same time  napolean also very tasty good mix creamy filling flaky thin waferlike layers    The price everything came $20 which crazy expensive but thrifty either  <EOR> Before waiting line hotel's breakfast Buffet cafe au lait   decor trying look boulangerie pâtisserie but really doesn't pull off well   It's typical cafeteria style experience   But only looking drink kick start morning cafe au lait delish! <EOR> The service terribly slow unless getting pizza under staffed  Although sandwiches actually tasty especially Italian Deli Sandwich  <EOR> I discovered JJ's Boulangerie few years ago during stays Paris now look forward eating every time back Vegas  perfect cafe grab quick breakfast lunch during day  There's huge assortment pastries danishes breads coffees choose cherry cheese danish being favorite  gets crowded though prepared fight table  <EOR> stopped because starvingggg  overpriced  horrible customer service great food  ordered cured meat sandwich mediocre basic nothing special   definitely wouldnt recommend place  <EOR> I ordered bacon egg cheddar croissant sandwich quite frankly best breakfast sandwich ever life! croissant fresh buttery crisp outside  bacon

care good food if employees shitty attitudes then fail  Someone told They're French part culture   bullshit  <EOR> Locate Paris Casino casual quick eats type cafe    Filled Pastries Baked Goods Hot Cold Sandwiches Pizza whole slice soup salads They take window pizza which great fast bite  stopped breakfast pastry coffee prices reasonable relaxing atmosphere   No waiter service seating available inside out  <EOR> Simply amazing! tuna roast beef sandwiches while big line real fast  sandwiches themselves probably best each ever had all very reasonably too  service quick very courteous  biere wasn't bad either  Quite affordable too  All all loved late lunch here  <EOR> For some reason continue pick sandwiches although they're overpriced bland   Stand line crepe buffet try burger place just somewhere else!!! <EOR> This place overpriced ridiculous  pizza prices okay but drinks everything else  I bought water juice 9 bucks  My sister waited forever pizza only told didn't having wait  also run pizza fast long while only magherita  <EOR> This acceptable place casual quick meal when everything else closed   serve cold bottles beer if need one    wait Wednesday night few minutes but bad   don't mind waiting bit sandwich hasn't sitting wrapped plastic few hours   beef dip sandwich pretty good   highly recommend pastries   two different ones $6 each shared them good looked  <EOR> I can't understand place functions  Everyone HORRIBLE attitude  Service isn't great nasty people towards customers  never return establishment would recommend place anyone  far worst places experienced Las

consume half hearty sandwich but struggled leave other half but hey Vegas taking doggie bag unfortunately should but didn't wrap offer many homeless panhandlers strip  associate tried pizza said just alright guess all making right choices even restaurants Vegas gamble sometimes    <EOR> On Sunday May 13th daughter arrived Paris hotel much anticipated 3 night mother's day getaway  Check well  room clean  great time exploring hotel pool gambling   We walked past JJ's earlier day pizza smelled great  evening dinner decided stop window grab couple slices bring back room   window agent wasn't waited line began form behind us  agent Teresa walked past telling inside  approached register waited when noticed Teresa helping gentleman behind farther down counter  down there  She brought selections same register waiting then began assisting people began line again behind us  2nd time Teresa walked past telling over there   When turn line mentioned Teresa didn't think fair she kept telling over helping other people front us  She claimed she didn't when she absolutely had  asked speak Teresa's manager she  said she would call manager  While waiting coworker Katrina sharply said oh its mothers day some people just want complain   asked repeat herself because astonished employee would rude customer  She said wasn't talking talking friend   work mothers day  feel sorry being bad mood while some people work  completely taken aback   already frustrated back forth line Katrina just making bad situation worse  daughter told Katrina stop talking because she could tell Katrina just making bad situation worse   The woman behind line asked happening told her  Katrina yelled should line wait over stop complaining guests   Shortly Frank manager another area came over asked going on  explained situation  he apologized asked if wanted file report  told just wanted aware because personally spent over 35 years customer service field current position  Director Toursim if employees would spoken guest way would immediately sent them home while situation investigated  Frank assured would investigate even brought another area file report  asked if just waste time he assured wasn't  sure transpired but know Katrina still working restaurant saw when walked past  contacted again management during  stay despite filling report phone number room number  am very disappointed service lack follow your management staff  <EOR> Late night service slow even without being busy  Tables clea sandwich mediocre <EOR> So sandwiches fantastic  town weekend girlfriends wedding stayed Paris  ate JJ's sandwiches twice really enjoyed them first day when swung during slow time day grabbed late bite    That bring said second experience nowhere near positive first  bakery packed lunch hour understandably going more wait  35 minutes cold sandwich little extreme though especially considering friend ordered hot sandwich same time 20 minutes before did  Multiple people ordered eaten left time given lunch which only received asking eta was   lost order  Then made sandwich but threw before even offering made wrong  then when finally did receive looked completely different day before even though ordered same thing    I would chalk mistake seeing worked service industry understand happens  Problem 1 10 people waited exceptionally lengthy amount time food just watch people ordered way leaving meals hand    JJ's great food but don't come starving expect patient  sandwich line incredibly unorganized while chefs friendly enough food consistent  Lost orders orders made incorrectly lot confusion behind counter going menu if decide come during lunchtime rush  <EOR> pathetic eclair  shame french hotel <EOR> A good alternative if buffet line Paris your stomach knots wait time  large pizza 3 toppings $25 door  Very shareable among 3 4 people  alternative very much cheaper per head buffet let's just say that   But nearly good  fix calories  I'd probably avoid dinnertime see offer breakfast lunch place really bakery menu seemed teem French delicacies ranging croissants specialty sandwiches   Hilarious anecdote if see cash register technician
