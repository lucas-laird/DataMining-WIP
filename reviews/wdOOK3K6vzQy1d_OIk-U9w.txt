AYCE $23 95 per person Will come back again <EOR> I've regular doh months now changed Yama sushi quite few disappointments  First services  don't know if servers fault chefs but lot times never ordered  Dishes missing reorder again again  Next rice soggy crumbling when pick up  last thing whenever family gets seated seat always dirty! There's crumbs food irritates much   But other okay  <EOR> Service horrible  Brought wrong rolls incomplete orders when asked correct order    waitress rolled eyes     water never filled  Food worth service  <EOR> I extremely excited find second more mid location between family I  pretty much same menu flavors same original me   I customer service tad bit more original though 'cause more space less crowded give wait staff more time pay attention you  least  fiance when around 5 30PM Friday  The only thing found kinda weird setting theme location  reading other Yelp reviews realized haven't able redecorate Doh still painted background sushi bar  <EOR> Awesome food staff MULAN!!! besttttt !!!! love place already   always think customer more anything else  <EOR> We love old Yama but due large party decided Spring Mountain  food great however seat attendant told would take 20 minutes before could seated ended being well over hour half    After table waitresses placing Styrofoam cup apple juice table when tore spilled onto daughter niece  Just thanking God wasn't hot beverage  didn't blame waitress but hoping restaurant invest some higher quality products    There bit attitude waitresses while taking orders well  2 year old picky eater but she loves miso soup extra tofu that's all she eats Sushi restaurants specifically asked it  When came evident bowl did much tofu  daughter finished quickly asked more  asked waitress another bowl more tofu last  she told they're working rolled eyes     If wasn't larger space probably wouldn't choose Yama restaurant over other one  <EOR> Have patron Flamingo location through cramped quarters sometimes questionable service decade now learned new second location Chinatown in former 'Sushi Doh   parking rough especially weekend evenings! however worth it  Same AYCE menu same favorites but far more open atmosphere quicker more attentive service  Even Sushi Bar more spacious   Sure there's still wait but sister locale deliciously worth it  <EOR> I loved going Yama near Maryland when going UNLV! ecstatic opened location Chinatown!  First off space much room! Wide sushi bar plenty tables  Several sushi chefs plenty staff check think  wonderful!   Sushi tasty comes fast  all rolls before other location  Appetizers sides miss here  Chicken skewers hard chew dry don't recommend all  The hamachi kama salmon kama disappointing both incredibly small dry   Seafood salad shrunk considerably  I would love see Yama improve this   I say save your stomach room just nigiri rolls  try thier baked rolls its amazing mouth!! <EOR> This location literally favorite  Even though isnt good original Yama worth coming here  less waiting time ambiance much nicer less crowded    This literally favorite sushi place all las vegas  All fish super fresh all rolls super delicious  staff super friendly attentive  never ask them refill your drinks pick your dishes  TOP GAME!!! Snow Vegas No Name some most favorite rolls menu   I forever loyal Yama sushi  tried others super let down don't compare  <EOR> The best AYCE sushi city  Service unique passionate  Food fresh delicious  Place cool clean  visiting many more times  Love place! <EOR> Me girlfriend Food good tasted fresh  service horrible extremely slow place wasn't busy  literally sat table empty plates while waiter fumbled around doing nothing  <EOR> Some similar menu different bigger location   For starters why wasn't new Yelp page made new location? DOH wasn't great but why confuse people differentiate two? Yama really earn reviews stars instead reflecting off DOH mixing two! The place still felt DOH but Yama menu sure they're still working it   The waiters waitresses attentive friendly but didn't seemed yelling every time someone walked in  Maybe tone down 5 since everyone working greet anyways lol   Now food   My all time favorite and would probably crave Wet Dream roll! Baked cream cheesy shrimpy goodness! Then maybe No Name then Sun Beach    Their nigiris looked good much rice fish looked fresh but am more roll type person! also good amount appetizers sides choose from   I haven't Yama sushi years but dining recently crazy it   I just honestly wasn't impressed  ¯\_ ? _ ¯ <EOR> Food alright   waitress rushing fucked whole order  didn't even ask if wanted just order individual rolls all eat but just assume doing all eat  others party end waiting close hr 2 rolls time most already finish eating  <EOR> worst japanese food  place smells its old  terrible horrible  staff friendly <EOR> I late dinner last night AYCE  hostess great  She greeted promptly sat quickly  waiters waitresses another story  order drinks 3 different times before brought out  ordered first round sushi didn't see waiter atkeast 20mins  kept trying flag down order he kept ignoring continued help everyone around us  Finally ask another waitress take order    The food mediocre  mussels over cooked nigiri did taste fresh all  only good say price really good   once asked another waitress assist no longer waiting long  am stickler customer service  <EOR> This place terrible! never recommend anyone eat here  isn't worth it  stopped Saturday host seated two us  Shortly waited 15 minutes someone take drink order  Another 10 food order  terrible  new server every time someone came table  rude unhelpful  When rolls arrive servers stopped coming table  Eventually wave hostess down  She helpful  rolls weren't even all good either  California roll tasted really fishy  More fishy usual  used cheap imitation crab  wanted more rolls but no else came decided leave  Here's funny part  LOCK IN! think fear people eating running the all eat sushi   hostess ask ticket  She paid it  friend attempted outside while paid door wouldn't budge  He turned said doors locked  He noticed hostess slyly push button under stand doors unlocked  f*** kind sh** that?!! ate lunch  told service awful plan never return  She snooty that  HIGHLY RECOMMEND NO HERE! Save your time money! somewhere else! <EOR> Had 2 rounds AYCE sushi then staff completely ignored party  ask receptionist check even then ignored attitude  <EOR> Agree most other reviewers sushi isnt amazing  Employees very friendly but service slow  Took long sushi come appetizers late but did give sushi didnt order said ok if didnt finish it  cheaper most places $20 95 AYCE lunch menu does lot choose from  forgot some orders  Idk when busy during friday 1pm  Also dont know happened but place used called Do'h  Its now called Yama which lm assuming near UNLV but nowhere good  Although employees super nice recommend taking pass place  Theres lots other sushi places nearby chinatown much fresher fish  <EOR> This place rocks!!! Ayce Sushi fav  eat any sushi menu  service great   the girls it  Parking breeze  far off strip  Price great   quite bargain think  place list visit every time come Vegas!!! Great job people!!! would recommend place highly!!! <EOR> Been few times sushi always great  Today though group waitress bit unpleasant  Hopefully its just cause shes having bad day but still dont take people you're serving  Ya'll great still though! <EOR> The wait ordering food long also forget your food  customer service just terrible  Save your money somewhere else  <EOR> It's heart Chinatown   picked because pack means food good! 2 no wait pretty big sushi restaurant  waitresses don't keep still circle tables getting your orders fast  comes fast delicious  hamachi fresh desert  Large portions too  did half orders Hawaii sun beach night Yama oh dam harry! try Harry Potter too! definitely come back again  Only thing missing fried shumai  appetizers great too! <EOR> I'd start review off say quality sushi food good which only reason 2 star review  However really brought experience down lack customer service place has  husband waited 15 minutes before anyone came ask if wanted order anything else  only reason someone actually came table because hand trying wave someone down  plates stacked because already finished sushi rolls   and still no came  No even came fill waters seeing glasses empty  usually complain but lack initiative urgency servers mediocre  unfortunate because usually loved dining location Doh Sushi however now establishment replaced it   don't think coming back  <EOR> This better original Yama! long wait very spacious  Food amazing! <EOR> Doh where did go?!?  Even though Doh decided give new stand sushi bar try    mentioned below seated drink order placed   20 mins later waiter named goofy came sure ok   He quickly apologized delay said sure doing? all ok even fact nothing came available   once sushi came started lose appetite   eel sauce very strong burnt burnt flavor   lot rolls chose maybe picked wrong rolls  just don't know if back now know Doh gone  Sorry Yama <EOR> All eat sushi   shabby  colleague work  wanted local hangout sushi house outside strip    All eat includes drinks except liquor free dessert  Can't wrong any sushi rolls   They're also huge potions  only $23 eat much sushi bento tempura your heart's desire    Cheers! <EOR> My favorite hamachi kama!

Servers very attentive asking if needed anything things didn't rush when ordering food  food ordered came SUPER QUICK  appetizers actually did come first which  different because normally take longer because they're fried then alllll rolls nigiri ordered came together  granted always order lot front because take while but place point   However only bad part everything coming once then ordering more different times things tend lost  friend order 3 more items all which did time decided bill dessert  I would definitely come back just based sushi service just sure keep track your orders! now might always location speed <EOR> For price pretty awesome  sick sushi onto bbq ribs sesame chicken salad  appreciate awesome variety! wasn't particularly impressed tempura miso soup though love tempura miso soup little sad end  batter seems suck oil something  temperature fryer probably off but no big deal because much other stuff eat! <EOR> Great quality all eat Japanese food!  Probably best sushi joint ever to  wait bit long but totally worth it   Good parking too! <EOR> I never really into sushi but eating sushi fan now   kinda stumbled place looking seafood restaurant  I can't remember all names sushi rolls ate know eel salmon tuna all really good   think all eat $23 well worth it   Next time Vegas no doubt coming again!! <EOR> This area hardest parking but worth it  friends came Saturday night grab some food before movie  another Nicole came put name down while waited other friends show find parking   took them forever but understand why!! hard! seated while waiting them drink order finally came in  look menu while waitress came over took order  wasn't really hungry only dragon roll other friends doesn't really care sushi she just some fried rice  other two friends all eat menu which also include fries fried rice some other random things  cost extra dollar per roll soy paper  But really love when places okay when all table all eat  know people probably think going share food something but doesn't always work way  food really fast delicious  all kinds unique rolls  ones remember Harry Potter roll  didn't much Mr  Potter but unique name  Before finished ordered mochi ice cream which perfect ending meal  ordered green tea ice cream strawberry mochi only charged one  really nice them  <EOR> Yama Sushi AYCE sushi restaurant though also order la carte   But time order couple dishes menu may find better AYCE pricing $20 95 lunch $23 95 dinner  set price seems way here    Located very heart Spring Mountain Yama brings lot foot traffic quite busy here  record typical choice sushi but already chosen good friend mine   inside Yama very clean even air absent any fishy odor which often signal leave without looking back   but day guessed stayed   While guest ordered many different rolls enjoyed them very much ordered Nigiri Sushi  am fan rolls general especially those drizzled sauce nothing say rolls simply avoided them  often case some items restricted only order per person such Uni Sweet Shrimp Giant Clam etc   A typical issue AYCE Sushi restaurants want fill fast   they put much rice rolls Nigiri   not Yama Sushi  Perfect amount each bite!!   The service attentive friendly  don't rush but slow take your order either   So if need spot AYCE want option rolls nigiri sashimi might bad option you  2017 Review #62 <EOR> Great food but horrible services  Only good employee Carlos aka sexy daddy  He isn't even waiter  waiter kept forgetting order brought wrong orders  need better waiters  Hopefully better services  <EOR> Got experience buffet!

Good Job Yama Sushi!!! <EOR> I came because Yelp reviews said peanut butter roll  Well old place said few times tried things people raved here  OK AYCE priced average used paying  service pretty good because everyone works comes see if OK want order again  did somewhat  nothing rave regular sushi place Vegas returning next trip   Just super bummed felt Bait switch kinda  Yelp needs places start over when business changes name ownership  IMO <EOR> Lol all salty people writing bad reviews just because favorite sushi spot taken over  expect different restaurant serve same type sushi you're used to?   Personally love new look  Came Saturday night seated 20mins later CES weekend  Since every restaurant Spring Mtn wait looked no further  Everything seemed promising until handed over dirty menu soy sauce stains all over it  miso soup tasted bleach  also ordered few nigiri rolls Quail egg extra charge but somehow came inside roll  sure why server didn't even apologize offer another one    Me boyfriend also couldn't help but notice every single roll going tables abnormally ginormous    much rice  ridiculous amount could possibly full 2 rolls  Wow Vegas kinda AYCE? eat ALL EAT RICE?    Cute server uniforms creative name badges water tea refilled spontaneously  Pretty wall installed right which looks you're somewhere Himalayas  Other coming back    If you're visitor then you're better off somewhere else  Jjanga's Umiya Sushi Takashi excellent alternatives far where are  <EOR> Not  Doh sushi anymore! food just horrible Yama rolls just soaked starch oil  <EOR> Awesome again!!

How? If can't serve people now why would seat more? guy booth  Behind continued ignored  walked hostess thanked coming    This first time here  Whatever reason poor service shame showed lack concern people fund business  <EOR> AYCE $23 95  Can't wrong AYCE    The poke bowl amazing decent appetizer portion size    Highly recommended Sushi restaurant definitely popular Vegas choice  <EOR> For buffet style restaurant great!

Tempura lukewarm chewy old tasting  Green mussels equivalent chewing ear  Firecracker dried overcooked spicy tuna inside tried hide quart mayo  Green tea ice cream tasted old lady's perfume  We're surprised place dead  Service very friendly fast there's but won't returning  <EOR> This place good when uses doh   Yama sushi nasty    There's flamingo Maryland parkway if liked would     very upsetting location changed used come every week    We never return guess now find another place   <EOR> Yama still best all eat sushi West    This first time particular location Spring Mountain  open midnight Tuesday therefore went    The sashimi Yama rolls all other rolls included $25 can't beat  Included also miso soup edename some ice cream    We ate until hit food wall  only regret couldn't eat anymore  Everything tried delicious  Ask yellowtail belly  Spicy tuna exceptional  Yama sauce wish could buy  sushi chefs extremely friendly knowledgeable told exactly should order    Fantastic experience can't wait back Yama! <EOR> Came dinner loved it  Really loved mussels Wet Dream Roll  service really nice friendly  <EOR> 3 5 5 stars exceptional service but few disappointments food  came Saturday 6 30pm party 4 seated within 10 15 min which great! soon sat down server came orders since already knew wanted  funny because whole time felt 5+ servers table since all kept stopping table making sure alright taking orders dropping off food refilling drinks constantly etc! food came super quick well which huge plus considering AYCE sushi experiences waiting years food come out!   Overall food just ok  miso soup very salty which made hard eat  dessert selection wasn't very appealing only ice cream mochi  really looking forward some tempura type dessert but sadly wasn't menu  Rolls great Harry Potter  No Name I'd give those try! Also pricing $23 95 AYCE dinner 3pm 2 30am  <EOR> Like any AYCE sushi place your money's worth just bc all options available  But judge sushi place based nigiri sad say disappointed here  sashimi pieces rather dry rice lacking flavor enough rice vinegar  menu nigiri rather small much variety used missing some standards opinion  But large variety cooked rolls  rolls however really delicious kind saved place 3 stars instead 2  baked deep fried rolls all sound amazing menu flavor doesn't disappoint  But again if don't nigiri feel wasted time  don't really eat rolls all but felt need try them really value paid $23 90 AYCE dinner     The service great orders taken delivered promptly  All servers really nice attentive thought cute all name tags cartoon characters    If COOKED sushi then definitely give place try  But if you're prefer nigiri real raw stuff you'd better look elsewhere  <EOR> Best all eat sushi place ever not only Las Vegas but all over   Sweet Shrimp No Name roll Sun Beach roll Trust Baby roll particular favorites  Awesome service 6 7 different waiters waitresses constantly asking if wanted put more food orders in  Tab would easily exceeded $140 two anywhere else but ended under $60    Definitely worth Uber strip if find yourself Chinatown <EOR> Horrible experience!
