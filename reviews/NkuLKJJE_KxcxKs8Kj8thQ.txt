We'll back! <EOR> I normally hate give negative reviews anything having worked many years service industry myself   Unfortunately experience tonight compels share thoughts regarding restaurant    bit context am Las Vegas local tried many sushi restaurants area   would back any them before come back here    Food Average best   edamame served cold first time ever served cold edamame restaurant   Further no creativity rolls  flavors simply fish rice nothing bring flavor tuna salmon eel   heavy use green onions chives spices overpowered sushi rather having pleasant mix heat bring natural flavor dish   You'll find much better variety more complex flavors other places     Atmosphere Simplistic uninviting   setup merely  waist high sushi bar approximately 10 tables crowded into narrow space   Decorations sparse lighting more akin dim office environment    wasn't dirty  But layout colors don't feel comfortable either     Service Sadly worst part meal   note girlfriend did sit bar   Thus served owner Ken referenced other reviews here   Instead served very young looking girl only server night   Besides two gentlemen sushi bar girlfriend only ones there   actually ask separate menu listed sushi rolls   would think server SUSHI restaurant would presence mind give SUSHI menus regular menus   also ask plates  silverware   dishes pour soy sauce wasabi into   although she hovered uncomfortably around table during obviously supposed intimate meal between girlfriend I waiting snatch refill water kitten ball yarn when needed pay meal she nowhere around give check   She when didn't want when needed her   Price Overly priced but egregiously   There's no all eat menu not atypical Las Vegas    But even simplest rolls couple dollars much get    because $10 coupon gift through restaurant com   Turns if use coupon spend least $20 somewhat understandable force pay 18% tip regardless size your party   cheap misleading tactic defeats purpose coupon   normally tip 20%   But don't want feel forced tip especially when large size party   Bottom line ANY other sushi place Las Vegas  <EOR> Service nice friendly but slow only other person restaurant  sushi average nothing write home about  <EOR> Sushi Yamaguchi! First time enjoyed dinner very much  Very nice staff food delicious  Philadelphia roll Katsu Don  sushi roll made perfectly easy consume    sometimes hard time sushi because sometimes fall apart rolls made nicely easy consume without mess! Katsu Don yummy well katsu chicken rice peas egg bowl YUM!
