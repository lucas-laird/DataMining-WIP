Probably  Riv its time sun but ever changing climate sin city desert hosts nothing forever   For non mega casino umbrella properties i e  non Caesars MGM etc  Vegas longest surviving casinos  last 50 years Riviera graced north part strip its over top scintillating star theme having bankruptcy very moment erected  Personally surprised even lasted long   For serious players gambling more nostalgia earning comp dollar  casino itself understandably dated cheesy factor evident throughout property  worth felt more fun play surrounded whole 'nother crowd Downtown but some point Riviera practically senior citizen home   The rooms never fancy even higher end suites would trumped low grade suites mid tier properties  But lesser association means getting comps no big deal  Even retail stance getting room $50 under during week relatively frequent reality   I wish around years when Liberace headliner here  Crazy Girls a pseudo risque nudie show seems desperate transition attention  Following bunch D list celebrities filling space time adding charm being suppose   The days properties numbered  When Stardust imploded several years ago signal new wave mega properties hit Strip  only matter time before Riviera followed suit  last month finally has   R I P  <EOR> My friend booked hotel Expedia $17 night   very confused because right Strip   We Tuesday Wednesday why cheap probably   I little sketched would very sketchy but very nice hotel casino!

I've stayed other cheapie hotels Vegas would definitely consider coming back here  rooms Monaco tower recently remodeled while may luxe other hotels good deal price   as long price under $100 weekends which through website  Some friends waited till last minute book found prices gone 199 night! sure book early good deal  Everything costs just little bit less hotel walgreens CVS far away  Beers scary Slots Fun across street only 2 bucks well  Most patrons seemed older folks conventioneers young people trying save few bucks  may little far strip but far walk Wynn Fashion Show Mall if moderately good health temperature under 100 degrees  charge $12 use gym no idea why since equipment outdated spa nonexistent  also 24 hr coffee shop featuring late night $5 all u eat pancakes special  place romantic getaway but perfect rowdy weekend friends  <EOR> I'm staying now am disappointed decided so   Ok free offer 3 nights needed Vegas trade show   offers 2 other hotels but thought old Vegas would cool   checking tried nap afternoon construction noises next room   Unfortunately tried call front desk no answered lines endlessly   Then tried call manager's office no answer 15 minutes   course now unhappy   call Security three times tell check loud repair sounding noises Sunday coming room next us   No call back   When called again Security employee told over !!!  Well marched down front desk eventually pack everything moved another room     The hotel old  ok undergoing some renovation  good   But customer service weak   Let's give them chance better   hope do  <EOR> My husband booked Fri Sat night because ridiculously cheap  into town 5pm Fri  Parking garage bit pain  ended luckily finding spot very top floor just someone pulling out  check line long folks behind desk slower molasses  girl suggested self check walked over just work  Also only 2 3 stations working  pulled reservation but wouldn't let check in  Back long line went       So checked without any further issues given coupon book which didn't use anything it room we stayed non smoking king bed room Monaco tower   Everything seemed okay room clean    We headed down steakhouse dinner friends  food quite tasty service really good given big party  dinner headed upstairs some TV bed   The next morning woke brunch down Wicked Vicky's Tavern friends  10 30 AM but didn't seated until 11 AM missed breakfast  made quite sad  food good service okay  Nothing write home about    We headed back room ready day  town wedding left 2 PM  gone all afternoon evening   When arrived back 9 30 PM couldn't into room  headed downstairs new keys but didn't work either  back down went     guy behind desk called bellhop but he wasn't able room  told they'd call maintenance security  Neither them could told they'd call locksmith  Ugh     moved rooms but double bed  called moved again single king bed room top floor  asked comped somehow trouble told they'd take off 1 2 days resort fees  Whoopdie $15 off  headed back friends  11 30 PM stopped front desk ask if gotten access room  husband asked asked being comped again wiped 2nd night resort fee  sent another maintenance guy could in  Finally      gathered all stuff headed new room  maintenance guy most apologetic everyone sad maintenance guy seemed more sincere front desk    Check next morning fairly painless  2 3 self check in stations working  rebooted used just before using worked  But girl beside frozen couldn't check out    Overall    cheap comfortable clean price  <EOR> Place OK! Employees nice friendly but Valet would take ever bring car but overall service A   only giving them A because place needs updated  Oh Buffet needs more variety but $16 99 cant that  I would return casino only maybe gamble  <EOR> This place very bad reputation apparently but don't see why  stayed 3 days 2 nights really enjoyed it  liked bit secluded others but still easy walking distance  liked also bit smaller but still everything other higher end and way over priced hotels have  rooms clean comfortable spacious  buffet very yummy nice variety  parking wasn't overwhelming other hotels  casino good too  People saying aren't any live dealers but think they're smokin' something because played black jack roulette craps live people  very helpful too  front desk nice all workers casino very friendly    The only two bad things dusty alarm clock $30 resort fee never told until checked out  All all though enjoyed would definately stay again! <EOR> After booking room priceline read bunch bad reviews web dreading stay there  Since named price priceline no way could it    tried  stuck!

My only complaint would early close down pool area 7pm Friday night but life guard staff Las Vegas's present economic situation guess shutting down pool early isn't unreasonable    It located end strip across street Circus Circus  If looking walk your hotel see roller coaster pirate ship and Celine Dion then probably isn't good location    I am sure why many bad reviews online? Perhaps some bitter gamblers home broke some unreasonable tourists couldn't afford real vacation ended going Vegas looking Paris vacation left disappointed?? <EOR> If getting hotel free would alright stay here   But if paying consider other places   It north end strip far walk drive places   rooms alright but nothing special  casino old just depressing   If 40+ am sure would enjoy place full older crowd   If young hate place much did  <EOR> This OK   Good price   Main problem far away rest strip but  fault Riviera   i would however complain something annoying happened upon check in   night before spoken customer service agent whether early check in would OK   She told would fine   words isn't much going Vegas weekend  still lot availability  arrived Riviera next morning MAGICALLY all booked   booked only few hours having lot availability?  matters more irritating couple front permitted check early but expected walk around dunce waiting room cleaned   I wouldn't minded early check in issue except some incompetent fool website chat thought appropriate lie booked or just check one      I know focused mostly negative but just experience hence why still gave 3 stars fine hotel   best but safe clean which all hoped for   great if plan spending most your time outside hotel but keep mind transportation annoying  <EOR> Timeless Affordable Las Vegas Hotel  This hotel flair affordable   The staff very friendly gave desired room  Before official check in time already room   On April 6th 2013 early afternoon met Woman dark long hair thin kind poncho shoulders casino  She accompanied Asian Girlfriend  just came back Grand Canyon West tour very tired  day started 4 AM  other reasons asked name contact details Woman  give something Woman  important  However know where search Woman  <EOR> The line forever long    the self check in broke   the pool ok   there's really no where eat     The only OK thing gym  rather gym old equipment vs nice limited  fitness center old equipment but many use   There's really no cafe buy food if food court morning only serve called 'breakfast' menu  stood line Quiznos no served me  Indian place didn't know breakfast menu items never heard of  thought could chicken sandwich but only serve breakfast food opted omelet  omelet gross because smothered cheese bacon editable because cold lot fat it  dare try bread  hash brown greasy couldn't eaten  didn't give napkins forks ate bare hands back room  <EOR> I haven't vacation over 5 years       came Southwest Challenge 9 ball pool tournament Didn't lot money spend planned just playing pool    Check in took lil long but lot people line   Casino nice enough    pool area nice   rooms nice flatscreen tv fridge OK glad mini bar    mean come on    figured ppl wanna put own stuff save money!

Then room itself  When told property gone through remodel would think would put newer rooms  No room circa 1975    There sticker mirror bathroom asked keep staff safe if any hypodermic needles dispose ask housekeeping assistance  Seriously?! Dole banana sticker bathroom counter when arrived when left even though housekeeping came each morning  cupboards under sink wouldn't close    The room clean  window overlooked pool mold fungus windowsill  wouldn't noticed except drapes falling off hooks trying put them back up    On ventures noticed room service tray outside neighboring rooms  tray more 24 hours!
