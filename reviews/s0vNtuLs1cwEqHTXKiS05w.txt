Had German chocolate pancakes sweet chocolatey yummy  Paired chocolate milk P <EOR> I Babystacks two times now  assumed first time coming fluke maybe understaffed day but today returned find exactly same scenario   When party 2 arrived only person front counter ringing people no host hostess  stood 2 minutes until another patron walked front signed herself sheet  she finishing someone else walked took names down  asked if counter first come first serve if also wait that  host told he ask other parties list wanted seats first  He never asked anyone seats remained empty along several other empty 2 person tables  10 minutes into wait group 3 guys came sat themselves counter  Nobody stopped them even glanced way    When finally seated seated party before which also group 2 two separate 4 seater tables  least two smaller tables other side restaurant am certain already cleaned because watched them clean them  Why seat bigger tables perpetuate incredibly long wait place always seems have?  The only saving grace place quality food  very good  If wasn't nobody would wait long place  However need some serious changes way send orders    When finally food 20 minutes ordered neither sides included  going few extra minutes  both completed main breakfast still no sides  chocolate chip pancakes which just chocolate chips TOP pancakes way other person toast  When finally came toast definitely sitting out  first time came situation exactly same but waiter apologized said kitchen behind  Understandable but apparently kitchen ALWAYS behind  seem need more staff     All while never refill  table behind seated order taken before paid left reseated well before able leave    This location really needs learn manage volume  never busy  need staff accordingly    Speaking staff everyone very friendly nice but enough want back when there's Rachel's Kitchen same parking lot plethora other breakfast joints just 5 minutes away  <EOR> The menu itself no joke neither food!

The coffee perfect pancakes  only reason didn't give more stars service little lacking  didn't seem all busy but took while order coffee refills didn't come around much would liked  couple times different days week sure why service just so  tell though red velvet pancakes worth your wait!  NOW! <EOR> I love babystacks always original location Summerlin best service should've just gone instead  Never coming back location again experience   Yes there's lot people busy    BUT doesn't give excuse rude inattentive your customers  server took 15 min drink another five orders    Once he did orders all orders incorrect! simple sorry would've sufficed BUT he managed say sure didn't order that?     BRO    ordered Portuguese sausage rice over medium eggs pancakes      he gave sausage seasoned potatoes scrambled eggs toast    instead apologizing he just changed your mind toast  ? NO  never ordered it   he telling wasn't he wrote down   Well OBVIOUSLY paying attention didn't care much good service   he apologizes hearing comment claiming ordered he wrote  put cherry top of horrific service he managed put 3 drinks didn't order bill       cashier asks if wanted add tip     answer big NO  usually good tipper but service he lucky didn't walk out    Amazing food won't keep customers coming back if your service horrible unprofessional  did expect 5 star dining experience but also did expect attentiveness little bit courtesy     SMH  <EOR> Very long wait        Really only negative maybe actually positive     Decor inviting BUT brought 6  girls all said food delicious!!!! Everyone wants return  <EOR> My good friend always head when breakfast big takes over  All unique flavors slight island flare little morning spot hard beat  love German chocolate pancakes when fighting sweet tooth lemon ricotta when want little more tame  But let tell GARLIC RICE!!!

Deffo regular spot me <EOR> Never disappointed! Service sometimes slow only because they're always busy but they're friendly doesn't matter! Food fantastic especially Nutella pancakes!! Yum! <EOR> Went huge group taken care quickly food delicious usual!!!!! Great customer service  <EOR> I coming babystacks past 6 years  Recently babystacks made change policy where cannot split checks  can't begin explain inconvenience caused party with  top drive 25 minutes location because always good experience food great  But another reason because military friendly  Today Krissy told entire military party she couldn't give military discount because already gave check although hadn't even paid yet  looking handout but always support small business especially if they're military friendly  splitting check inconvenient annoying but then deny military discount because didn't announce military before ordering food absolutely absurd  Again coming various Las Vegas babystacks locations but last time return again  <EOR> I know most people come pancakes but come Hawaiian breakfast  love Hawaiian food! <EOR> My ultimate favorite breakfast location! Food service always 5 star  Wait time little longer would but  because always busy  staff always very kind friendly come least 3 times month never gets old!! <EOR> My favorite breakfast spot Las Vegas!  bananas foster pancakes die for!  comfy casual restaurant entire family enjoy  <EOR> Giving four stars instead 5 because restaurant made portions smaller sure   Service awesome!  love red velvet pancakes   Coffee could better   Breakfast two around $35 00 tax tip  <EOR> My favorite place Church  However its always packed but its worth wait  Great red velvet pancakes enjoy vibe place  Glad took chance place  When leave Las Vegas going really miss Babystacks  <EOR> Pancakes amazing! But omelets food! Wish open later then 2 00 pm <EOR> Babystacks usually go to pancakes  probably biggest variety town   This first time location others quite busy  NEVER eat restaurant because busy is  Instead pick eat comfort own home The Mr  loves S'mores pancakes typically try different ones  don't think wrong any pancakes  All tried delicious matter mood for  think Babystacks pancake everyone   This time Hazelnut course delicious  best part home made whipped cream  delightfully creamy sweet fluffy  typically don't eat pancakes whipped cream but can't say no to  I also tried new breakfast item since trying chicken fried steak recently first time if read reviews already know decided broaden breakfast horizons  tried Corned Beef Hash tasted good flavorful crispy  really thing though  usually Kalua Pig Benny really good! Hash browns fave little under cooked me  But seasoned fries awesome stick those  All all great breakfast option especially if you're fan pancakes  <EOR> If yet RUN walk!!!  now! Unless past lunchtime closed  attempted eat weekend morning but line going door didn't even car   Yesterday Wedsneday daughter decided drop in   place very plain   guess expecting fancier but fancy all   waiter very friendly helpful   menu tons items it   Everything sounded good hard decide order!   each picked something share   ordered pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich macaroni salad skillet scrambled eggs potatoes green sauce whatever else put there   OMG       everything amazing!!!!   could totally understand why packed weekends!   prices reasonable portions fair   only complaint open dinner!!! <EOR> Meh    just ok  feels more cafeteria then restaurant most pancakes just sweet  more desserts then pancakes  2 times wait staff polite took orders pretty quickly  however price bit high   However place should tried especially if sweet tooth! <EOR> Food should stuck pancakes  am visiting Hawaii little home sick wanted try loco moco  First off little disappointed couldn't sub fried rice small charge but rather only could garlic rice over garlicked buy $10 adobo fried rice side  something any L L big city diner loco moco shop does easily  gravy tasted little    Boxed  coffee tasted distinctly plasticky mixed airplane coffee taste bad water sugar didn't any better  But admit fault ordering something Hawaiian Las Vegas  husband white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes gobbled them those good  stick pancakes   Ambiance staff very nice smiley little inattentive but functional  decor little sparse but music nice!   Overall good place breakfast if want traditional breakfast foods but some work Hawaiian local specialities  <EOR> The best desert breakfast place town! biscuits gravy also mine  Wait time usually less quote as  see why line always door  <EOR> Almost every weekend nutella crepes BLT go  only food delicious but always kind courteous  even take time even though always swamped open each box ensure order correct  Everyone knows knows rave Babystacks  Highly recommend! <EOR> 1 star management 5 stars server  yesterday morning told would 20 30 minute wait which normal restaurant  Because size party choose wait outside  35 minutes passed still waiting outside we're starting wonder going on  Shortly woman white dress comes ask if party 10  said yes she said they've calling you  thinking followed in  She off side talk another girl said Wait don't even work here?
