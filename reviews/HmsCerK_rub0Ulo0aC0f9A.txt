Overall presentation place decent looks clean etc     We ate Saturday night around 7pm   Place ghost town seated quickly   Menu looked promising anxious try some stuff!  Let add real quick when eat take 4 year old son well EVERY other sushi place AYCE options children whether its children's pricing just half off adult price  no such option son LOVES sushi seafood extremely disappointed he allowed any things he enjoys !  pay full $30 adult dinner price when he doesn't eat much anyway order few meals designated only children  He stuck eating very plain Kids Meal option  California roll miso soup 2 pieces tempura 8 $10 While applaud Kid's Meals all wish would've AYCE option well  Some kids enjoy flavors variety   We some difficulty ordering staff waiter didn't seem spoke very much english which happens quite few sushi restaurants around town didn't think much it  UNTIL ordering appetizers rolls ADULTS started tried order Edamame son  asked waitress if Edamame La Carte son could eat them   told would pay separately everything Since he AYCE she said no which point confused didn't understand why tried asking again  which she just kind shook head winked said shhh finger mouth   place just KID friendly waitress REALLY does speak English no idea saying   point before even any food already really disappointed way dinner going  we never edamame Once food arrived say fresh sense hot seemed freshly cooked made   But flavors most rolls quite bland nothing amazing   Even appetizers disappointing  Its worst sushi tasted but wasn't anything worth commending   Also ordered sons Kid's Meal first plain California roll came almost all rolls did! Which just bothered more      I think biggest things irritated most end meal left sitting 15 20 minutes  cleared table still brought check which isn't necessarily bad but once did bills noticed added Gratuity  Which most sushi restaurants add big parties  We party 5 plus child did eat AYCE usually 12% 15% NOPE! place took automatic 19% 20% Gratuity all bills totaling $50 $60 tips alone   irked quite bit especially because did think service food par such generous TIP!     I dining again  it worth drive money  <EOR> Highly highly recommend !!!!!!!! Tell Andi Robert sent you This place family owned very extensive menu  There's no doubt Summerlin area best AYCE sushi restaurant  If can't fill your money's worth your own issue  <EOR> This worse sushi ever had  Grocery store sushi better place  honey bread smelt rotten just threw away  <EOR> Excellent quality excellent service outstanding sushi great selection premium Japanese beers most sushi places don't offer   No rush long stayed  price right  Great place family friends  <EOR> This little sushi spot located Village Square used 808 Tapas   from place small but familiarly cozy  Nothing special ordinary decor but little modern side without getting contemporary  Upon entering   greetings staff welcome most Japanese places  All seem nice helpful  Food wise sushi portion rice ratio little off sometimes more rice other sushi restaurants  Food taste pretty good mediyoker depending order   This place doesn't seem overly packed but decent enough place if craving sushi area  Look Yelp check unlock offers sake  also specials going social media sure check ask save price   Would come back? Probably but back up  Nice place try though   you may different experience  <EOR> Hanabi great its price  Really good pointer actually salmon tuna poke octopus AYCE even during lunch which plus because all AYCE places serves that    Their shrimp tempura die for  Hot crunchy  Lunch only 19 99!! even skewers which fave  scallop bacon which scrumptious  Also ordered salmon white tuna nigiri  salmon okay  But white tuna super good melts your mouth  Decent sushi rice ratio  Also ordered miso soup which yummy flavorful  spicy tuna hand roll which also good  But if u want avo cucumber u gotta ask it   Then dessert ordered course green tea ice cream which wasn't frozen  good tasted authentic    Service nice  never rushed bothered while girl chatting away  always came right time ask if wanted anything else order  Also think manager would ask randomly if doing okay during time which nice    The environment simple tables sushi bar  But type tables had  wooden benches wooden tables which felt kind Japanese traditional    If you're area would def recommend place  Food great  Service great  Price even better! <EOR> Omg  food amazing  all eat each sushi pieces thick  Service great overall hidden gem  Secret try Udon soup  BEST udon experienced Las Vegas  <EOR> Highly recommend! very happy quality fish presentation   serve large portions quality excellent   new spot when visit Vegas  <EOR> Came work dinner fell love place first sight  Now became regular superior selection sushi grills good pair all creative rolls have  tried grade 5 kobe beef marbling itself says all  Every bite melted your mouth   Hanabi also offers great selection premium cold sakes premium japanese beers alot other japanese restaurants stock of  favorite sake dassai which more citrus cleaner finish sake wine pairs well chef's premium selection sashimi!!  know sushi chefs!

Now new favorite place  <EOR> Alright overall great place AYCE sushi  Awesome price   Sushi call ngiri sushi too  sushi always great two tiny pieces NOT WORTH UNLESS YOURE DOING AYCE always 1 bluefin 2 tuna 2 salmon 2 superwhite yellowtail  opinion solid food  Decent quality 25 99 AYCE worth it   Rolls careful  If says habeñero good roll  habanero rolls literally no flavor  don't put any good sauce just dumb horrifyingly hot sauce it  Rock roll good dragons  If spicy wary   Other stuff oysters good but expect pork belly AWESOME chicken good jalapeno poppers delicious shrimp poppers good ice cream good    Again crazy sell all ^ 25 99 everything total   ridiculously good prices good quality food  service nice food comes SUPER FAST   Update when someone ordered shoyu ramen  tried broth really nice clean flavor when came back decided try tonkotsu ramen  came hot should broth nice  Noodles cooked well tasted just cooked  personally prefer thin noodles instead thick ones but whatever  few criticisms first usually egg liquid yolk which always nice mix into broth  Also ramen literally broth meat green onions  Nothing else could see  Lots pork meat however some reason wasn't seared? Normally crispy skin then soaks broth crispy outside super soft inside melts into broth  Instead just soft   Now onto important part broth  first taste loved broth  wasn't clean flavor shoyu instead thick flavorful broth  Both broths seem good different  broth pretty awesome  Once cooled clearer taste broth  wasn't porky though    tasted lot more chickeny  Personal preference thick porky broth Best but thick chickeny broth good it tonkotsu though    maybe wrong no chicken flavor ? almost tasted super high quality top ramen way very chickeny  Anyway enjoyed broth just needs little more  Please sear pork skin crispy outside!!! Add little more into broth some bamboo more interesting opinion  <EOR> Came lucnh myself sat bar  3 sushi chefs duty orders came super fast  only server but feels there's also 3 them  She friendly efficient took very good care every customer  Sashimis came fresh hot appetizers taste excellent! come back again family next time  really great job here!

My qualifications AYCE restaurant very minimal fresh ingredients mainly uni amaebi salmon skin hand roll actually crispy mostly salmon skin? natto? carry fresh wasabi?  Their uni very fresh  Firm no bad aftertaste  Same amaebi  downside amaebi puny size no tempura heads accompany nigiri    Their salmon skin hand roll should really considered salmon handroll more salmon fried skin  Taste fine always forget ask no eel sauce  very picky menu items don't list something if presenting guest  While topic please don't say soft shell crab menu only give half soft shell crab  understand only 1 per guest AYCE but least specify half soft shell  gladly pay full crab   Natto menu saw but did carry it  Down side out! Tuesday closed Monday but Tuesday    deliveries should made compensate busy weekend if running low let down   Seeing par necessities sushi opted inquire fresh wasabi   Dessert menu offered nornal sushi staple tempura ice cream mochi ice cream  Nothing made desserts stand scream out   But definitely willing give them chance again  <EOR> What perfect experience  food service both remarkable owner Andy staff made spontaneous family sushi night relaxed enjoyed  Looking forward next visit but maybe next time date night without kiddos  way plan making usual neighborhood stop  <EOR> Simply amazing! Would give 6 stars if could    Most all eat sushi places middle road quality wise but Hanabi  fish fresh tender melts your mouth  variety quality rolls availabe even most picky diners happy  thing loved Hanabi doesn't skimp fish rolls way many all eat places do    Big John owner Andy chefs visit friendly accommodating  entire staff matter genuine made feel old friends    Make sure try Andy's roll Hanabi roll  if big John Andy behind counter ask them something special thats menu prepare your taste buds perfection  house sake par delicious food  new go to place sushi    Great sushi places great auto mechanics  Almost impossible find!

Second worst sushi ever eaten! Normally Zenshin Oyshi! However Moms birthday decided try something new    Biggest Mistake!!!   We checked before bringing mom met chef owner claimed he worked yellowtail Bellagio Nobu Ceasars love Nobu decided thus place moms birthday dinner! Bonus Chef seemed very nice!  When arrived 5 adults 2 toddlers hungry excited however met two worst servers!!! extremely rude unfriendly lacked knowledge also never checked first order ?? leave table three times request food drinks check!!! Don't worry didn't forget charge 20% gratuity charge!   After two hours sitting left hungry spending just under $200 00 no dessert mom any us!! Because although green tea cheesecake menu server said available today sold 6pm no business?! Okay some ice cream    1 4 scoops fingerprints actual finger prints!!!!  ice cream disgusting!!!  Thankfully cream downtown summerlin taco Tuesday always great! saved day! <EOR> Strong 4 stars   This might new west side sushi spot when don't feel driving across strip Sakana   Pros Small nigiri cuts but also small rice portion   fair balance Halibut nigiri menu   YES! Shrimp appetizers done 3 4 different ways Overall good quality fish They loyalty card where your 11th free Honey toast tasted better Sakana ice cream wasn't rock hard Friendly owner Andy came ask everything was   also friendly servers  Cons I miss all no rice sushi options Jjanga Sakana offer only menu order once opposed other places give 5 6 options order and order them all They two specials written board which could each   they figured they'd allowing order two other  Nope  Haven't found favorite roll yet comparatively limited choices offered but nigiri guy anyway    The raw oysters need small dab cocktail sauce sirarcha something flavor    someone else pointed review   gotta happen  Anyone moaning $28 price tag dinner   if math and place comes back into $25 $26 AYCE dinner price range   completely line rest AYCE sushi joints Vegas   Overall walked happy return    <EOR> This place going downhill  Small portions fish sushi cut right resulting small chewy fish  Wasabi dried no way fresh  All deep fried items taste old oil  only good thing waitresses  very pleasant hard working despite hovering manager  <EOR> We told trusted friends best place eat Japanese foods including sushi  warmly welcomed promptly greeted upon entering   The layout design very clean simple yet elegant    Now important stuff    food! disappointed extremely pleased every item ordered  quality extremely fresh taste great better expected AYCE presentation perfect    We sampled more 24 dishes menu all exquisite  any favorites table because all great  would note eel salmon mackerel yellowtail all noticeably high quality fresh compared other AYCE restaurants value prices well worth money spent!

Instead cooking medium heat more well done inside burnt outside cooked full flame  Salty means just cooked longer period time more cooked without changing any level sodium adding water  Hence mushroom onion meat also salty  Baked Salmon Roll some more expensive ingredients such cream cheese salmon some more cheese top but again could balanced flavours  Other side dishes best either  Wasabi pretty low quality stored right temperature  Iced green tea green coloured iced water instead tasting green tea  Salad fresh but much dressing  Overall food kind food would find mall food court no expertise love cooking  *  Price Japanese Hamburger Steak should sufficient $4 Baked Salmon Roll should sufficient $6 just because some higher priced ingredient it  So total bill tip should $14 but instead bill over $30 *  Recommend People who loves watching sports if use TVs watching sports just eating sushi finger food unlimited sushi  $22 lunch $28 dinner Sushi cannot bad if using sushi rice making machine putting fish top  <EOR> First time doing ayce  variety very good  All rolls great  Andy favorite  Fried rice bit greasy taste    Service spotty  server top other much  Overall really good value variety  return  <EOR> Tried All Eat sushi lunch but should've known better  sushi pieces tiny thinly sliced pieces fish top rice  also ordered Yellowtail Jalapeño la carte extra $16 jalapeño slices bigger fish  amount money paid better quality elsewhere  <EOR>
