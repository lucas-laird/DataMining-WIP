When mom finally finished meal took another 15 minutes them come back outside check again clear table  all still ended having pay $79  even took forever them pickup check could pay leave  Hopefully next time come food come right first time service pick some speed  <EOR> Even del taco  would taste better food  server horrible  No common courtsey  Did even refill glass water  He only interested offering high priced drinks    Del carbon chicken dry bland  hate paying $20 dish when no way worth it  Mt guest ordered fajitas he said same thing  Even salsa served starter chips bad   This real bad food anyone understand flavors knows good food agree    This restaurant off list  going again  <EOR> This place cool location atmosphere  food however food over priced amount quality food  Spanish rice tasted made cheap box grocery store  customer service great  <EOR> What wonderful experience!  1st call inquire Saturday reservation 18 4 birthday celebrations through dinner    Lily absolute doll Jose server awesome rest staff equally great!

There's two kinds more spicier other kick spice it  other   pretty mild taste bean dip taste better sounds   trust lol Now onto food really portions   its smaller most authentic mexican restaurant dishes  Some might but cuz weight conscious  lol paranoid if feel eating bunch food  But lets sidetrack  = boyfriend ordered chicken enchilada also order chicken enchilada sweet sauce top it  boyfriend both thought eh   just okay  rice didn't taste good  kind bland  drench salsa  Prices think came around $12 16 per dish  Obviously more expensive if going order any type seafood entree   Would come back here? Probably not  drinker didn't try any drinks but maybe place would've better those drink such  would good little spot grab drink eat some ceviches some complimentary salsa chips  <EOR> Love restuarant!  many places Vegas good mexican food but place awesome!
