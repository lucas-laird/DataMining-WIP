Label orders ugh!  ended waiting another 20 minutes them remake only b c kids LC fanatics   last couple months seem getting better but we're still waiting another mix up   very disorganized times  <EOR> We around 11am today  waited car while friend inside picked order  two employees dealt nice  manager supervisor cashier both handled order  ordered upgraded pizza extra cheese pepperoni 2 liter pepsi dipping sauce  pizza hot tasted fresh  Paying $1 extra cheese really pizza taste extra delicious  highly recommend location  review ONLY location  <EOR> This place absolutely horrible! Little Caesars all hot ready speed  location pick phone no matter many times call them row   attempted call location 15 time's when way work hurry never pick phone thought maybe busy except when walked nobody all employees sitting ass watching videos phone  wait around place order started running late work but while sitting decided call phone number again see if would pick 5 times row didn't pick because busy playing your cell phones    Never again come horrible location if your parrot suggest don't either    <EOR> This location STRUGGLES! always call order never ready time! Today called 8 05 pm  said would 15 minutes  Showed 8 30 pm giving them plenty time HADNT EVEN STARTED YET! sense customer service accuracy urgency very lacking! When talk anyone very mono tone robotic  C'mon guys let's some personality!! <EOR> Worst most unorganized location town   Pizza never hot ready advertised generally wait 20 min basic order   None employees ever seem happy jobs clearly don't communicate another most them no idea customer service means   know only $5 pizzas but common courtesy your customers free!  Today came location 10 50 am opening time 10 30 am doors still locked   could see employee inside messing safe getting drawer set up   Shouldn't already done?  Employee told through door manager didn't show gonna least another 20 min before he could start pizza   Clearly something seriously wrong location when store manager doesn't even show leaves employees run store   hope someone corporate headquarters reads all reviews cares enough over location fix issues store   today long while before visit location give them business    if ever  <EOR> The sauce terrible zero flavor dough okay toppings best  pizza bottom line  <EOR> Cashier couldn't take order right  kept repeating myself she just wasn't getting it  Took FOREVER  there's plenty other Caesars could without crap  Then top made wait FORGOT ORDER <EOR> Not bad quick kid food! Friendly service location  $10 81 two pizzas! Ask kid cookies they're free your order  <EOR> It's hot but ready wait pep pizza 10 min don't offer ready if <EOR> Ready made pizzas kinda stretch!  Never really massive ready made pizza kinda person maybe view altered little  just can't see pizzas maybe sitting actually fresh ready go    Any few times location found packed due no pizzas ever being ready order wait 20mins every other fast food pizza place  Although prices cheaper most maybe heading over grocery store grabbing frozen pizza might easier   The layout simple counter no seating inside if busy prepared stand while   Overall Service 2 5 Food 2 5 Drink 3 5 it's soda Coming back maybe if isn't busy <EOR> It's hit miss might extra cheesy pizza crazy bread hasn't fully cooked    seriously happened more once when complained employees didn't care  all    But pizza cheap spend $10 leftovers next few days  <EOR> So stopped cuz work nearby some dinner    think came really good time  ordered food immediately  only but pizza hot fresh well crazy bread  crazy bread actually big  didn't think Little Caesars made crazy bread anymore  Little Caesars house crazy bread thin your pinky finger  hard cracker  dry bone pizza never ready  <EOR> This little pizza place expected something amazing   But actually pretty good  pizzas very basic but tasty   buy them very often   really convenient usually pepperoni option ready go   run mostly young kids   friendly but sometimes little messy less attentive customers walking through door  <EOR> Not sure persons name manning register around 10pm  But unprofessional d bag short Hispanic Indian looking guy  When he asks girlfriend name she says Chris as Christine   Asks repeat again then he smirks lightly laughs? Says 10 minute wait weren't hurry fine but happened hot ready? pay wait  Decide want buy liter soda blatantly put front register  3 minutes later another customer walks he runs ring order said pay real quick? he drew blank stare sighed  Finally when order ready he tried giving pizzas another dude  said no wait  order Chris  He still hesitated said wait no  You're Chris Chris? he looked other dude again  said 3 pepperonis 1 cheese man give food  Drew blank stare again finally gave me  <EOR> NEVER HOT READY Ready   so frustrating time time  really need ensure products ready    I've walked 3 times during 4 8 time frame because nothing ready <EOR> I came other day pick something 35 pizzas work thing  ordered paid beforehand scheduled staggered pick times knew coming  So      Wait you've never Little Caesar's? big thing $5 pizza ready pick all time  best pizza ever only slightly better frozen $3 pizza Target but hot ready guess worst  also $8 pizza extra meat something but never ordered it  probably also just ok   Also other traditional things other pizza places such soda breadsticks wings    all stuff  probably ton food your large group $20  certainly deal if cost your main concern    Ok aside service actually pretty damn good  case pick ton pizza really polite really good letting know kinda early it'd three more minutes welcome sit wait whatever  other pick ups actually kinda behind pizzas because said two ovens down slow  stuff happens pizzas only late 10 minutes no big deal    The only snafu reason am debating bringing place down star because first pizza order 16 pizzas  guy put them all counter asked want help your car this? said that'd great man thanks  He kinda rolled eyes sighed then helped me  Dude why'd even offer?! could've just said You're all set thanks adios would've cool  But no jerk  Good job    All said would return here? Probably not  pizza only barely ok sure I'd want save $2 whatever Domino's wait extra ten minutes  But work thing HR set they'll probably again because work cheap  yeah  <EOR> The employees friendly happy professional  order ready correct no angry customers yelling order being screwed other cheyenne! <EOR> Worst service ever  hold forever hang just there  wait 10 mins while lady long pony tail pretends busy im only 1 then when order pizza thats spost hot ready she says 15 mins  left hungry back work hungry  <EOR> Corporate needs seriously consider retraining replacing workers  watched father request only half pizza covered pepperoni man behind counter gave hard time wanted upcharged him  Why upcharge using less ingredients? Why some restaurants comply listen customers others simply not? father said he would pay pepperoni worker rude it  Very bad customer service no wonder your rating low  Never again  Im tired giving Little Caesars chance other options  seeing people mistreated simple requests  <EOR> Okay know Little Caesars authentic Italian pizza but truth told no pizza chain is  Little Caesars pretty consistently best $5 cheese pizzas Crazy bread  sauce cheese ratio perfect never over cooked  very particular  the appearance taste Crazy Bread too  soft spongy hot buttery seasoned evenly  nail every single time! Lastly employees very courteous respectful  <EOR> Ordered breadsticks no cheese butter them because vegan handed breadsticks everything them  noticed walked back told guy register if could breadsticks nothing them  He rolled eyes said ugh now throw away snatched everything breadsticks hands huge inconvenience  He new breadsticks threw them counter  Safe say won't going back  3 dollar breadsticks worth attitude received  <EOR> Know pizza only costs $5 00 but worth it! Dough tastes cardboard rather spend little more good pizza! <EOR>
