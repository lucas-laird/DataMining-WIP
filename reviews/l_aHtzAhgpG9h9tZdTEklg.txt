Also serving size saddest small $1 99 ever seen life  fiance a creamed corn fan declared worst cream corn ever made  I'd agree!  The issue meat instead big slices meat falling sandwich *diced* meat  don't DICE meat BBQ restaurant just ploy hide fatty gross pieces your sandwich  place quality brisket actually wants see pretty slices doesn't anything hide  serving size sandwich also very small no wonder prices litte lower    I also disappointed find no combos sandwich potato  asked if could pay more potato sandwich combo  SURE  ok great   did want ring sandwich combo + potato sandwich + potato + drink?   HUH paying extra upgrade combo? just paying full price everything?   Overall pretty disappointed  state TX wants name back!

Unheard of!  Lucille's still place Beef Ribs Dry no sauce but Brisket everything else CJ's new spot    I'll admit best BBQ ever because hey nothing Home Cooked BBQ but ranks pretty high especially when factor great prices convenience factor Sahara Buffalo TIP Wear your grungy clothes if planning eating restaurant because come smelling you've slow smoked  Update Several visits later STILL Love Brisket sweet iced tea   am absolutely addicted it   seems place getting more more popular which good thing   bad news popular times where shut down early because everything sold out  AWESOME  <EOR>
