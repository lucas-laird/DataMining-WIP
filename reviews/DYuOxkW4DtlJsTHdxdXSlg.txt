Breezy   Luckily even no reservations wait time table less five minutes   place open airy noisy boy love smell Jerk chicken grills   really hoping cooked open charcoal flame but pretty sure probably not   Can't everything suppose   After getting seated giving drink order Bahama Breeze using bottles Republic Tea Ginger Peach tasty but tad pricy ready view menu   really bit mix some Jamaican some Caribbean some American   Fortunately lot sounded tasty   Wifey couldn't decide she settled Island Hopper $19 99 appetizer sampler platter sorts included signature Jamaican chicken wings crispy coconut shrimp onion rings conch fritters   came sauce sides jerk BBQ sauce citrus mustard roasted pineapple chutney   most part she enjoyed it   Jamaican chicken wings bit smaller she remembered but still very tasty peppery kick   Coconut shrimp indeed crispy but light good hints sweet when dipped pineapple chutney   Conch fritters only OK bit forgetful because tasted more hush puppy very little conch inside   onion rings well just onion rings   I ended getting Cuban Sandwich $10 99 while did should read menu better   Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce tomato Cuban sandwich??  salami???  Very very strange   Just Cubans guys marinated roasted pork good ham Swiss cheese pickles mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed plancha till golden brown   Simple!  Thank Jon Favreau Iron Man Chef fame!  think would enjoyed sandwich lot more without extra fluff but did applaud effort Bahama Breeze trying sandwich own   Next time would just order no lettuce tomato just put side   Overall good experience Bahama Breeze atmosphere inviting service stellar without being pretentious   food could use some tweaking but  par course   If place wasn't far where live would likely check menu further least come down hoppin' Happy Hour   Jamaican crazy! <EOR> I came family over Thanksgiving holiday lunch   getting sick buffets decided try something different   Food average   ordered wings big size! lobster quesadillas side seafood chowder coconut shrimp side chicken tortilla soup portabello mushroom burger   Only items stood seafood chowder wings   Burger very good something all ingredients manchego cheese just did work well together   signature lemonade cane sugar very good   Overall ambiance cute tropical inside   Nice getaway Vegas crowds!! <EOR> Great beautiful perfect priced! reccomend Jerk Shrimp Appetizer Banana nut covered brandy sauce dessert   delicious  service very calm assertive your need delivers well  Sunday through Thursday happy hour 9 til close all appetizers half off great deal!!

No kidding ordered appetizer but guess doesn't come first BB? Eventually appetized entrees delivered together? OK do! manager ? came over asked if everything OK course being served all 3 courses same time saves waiter trip  waiter into seclusion pout walk front bar refill Coke  waiter came table ask if needed straw NO needed refill! food good remembered being ended getting boxes  did want try desert but honestly afraid take chance guy!  terrible experience! <EOR> I wanted find location meet greet first night destination wedding weekend totally disheartened pricing any all on Strip locations  While driving around BFF happened see Bahama Breeze  know know chain  but fun vacation y appeal called car ask group events   Options low $20s per person?
