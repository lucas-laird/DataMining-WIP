Assuming mistake no fault own simple non intentonal mistake Jimmy Johns figured would call inform them politely concerns situation would rectified quickly would still able provide amazing coworker much deserved Jimmy Johns lunch  Unfortunately transferred multiple employees explaining situation multiple times kindly connected someone named Gabby   When explained situation Gabby immediately became defensive accepted zero responsibility even low tell someone called cancelled order  When told virtually impossible she reassured person called cancel order repeated order verbatim therefore cancelled order  Gabby insisted she right acted if thought happened did happen completely wrong  All could think fact she still hadn't said thing trying fix situation!!! still wanted Jimmy Johns!!  never met someone Gabby works industry meet needs customers treat such disrespect disregard! Anyway order sitting office unclaimed order suppose cancel   obviously   not mine which way could never repeated verbatim since totally different sandwich order  Throughout incredible effort explain fact no called called order   completely impossible   Gabby NEVER once took time explore situation further even attempt understand actually occurred  Instead accepting responsibility canceling wrong order which would graciously understood response insist called recited order verbatim asked cancelled  sat   no lunch   starving no lunch coworker insisted bring lunch home day because treat provide amazing lunch Jimmy Johns ? feeling disrespected unheard completely unvalued dedicated customer  ended informing Gabby even years years excellent customer service Jimmy Johns location she outrageous display inability accept mistake could easy rectified chose approach dumb customer called cancel own lunch order coworker looking forward all week long  if wasn't bad enough   I contact coworkers ACTUALLY cancel completely different order which never actually cancelled would put effort Jimmy Johns order removed credit card since charged same order respectfully cancelled appropriately  am YELP reviewer taken weeks write but situation could let unnoticed  No person such Gabby should handling situations such especially when dealing dedicated satisfied understanding forgiving customers   simple Oh man  mistake  Let fix you  would turned already awesome customer into even happier one   Instead opposite occurred because blatent disrespected towards customer just wanted check lunch order hadn't arrived time  never nor affected coworkers ever place order Jimmy Johns location  suggestion would Gabby never again default person handle such situations  sad situation could opportunity display great customer service outcome  <EOR> Good food plenty it!
