She replied saying pretty small  then proceeded ask if two people could possibly share them?  I'm sure she thought meant if she wasn't aware actual size chili cheese fries  But feel she isn't sure job if she trying sell more food  way didn't tactics would recommend place if don't feel driving few more minutes Baby stacks  <EOR> Best club sandwich ever  Thick cut bacon delicious herb mayo awesome side cole slaw made great meal  Friendly service decent prices nice clean  going back  <EOR> I would put zero stars but don't option guess lady served nice  reason being wait 35 minutes chorizo burrito small plate huevos rancheros  all honesty shouldnt take long  weren't even busy  top people came food before us  All all am very unsatisfied don't see 4 stars  Yelp sucks! <EOR> The Divine Eatery delicious! All food made order don't even own freezer! staff amazing attentive  love always offer husband cup never need box because food just good clean your plate  <EOR> Very disappointing  Why charging $4 plain cup coffee? When asked Sweet'N Low because all sugar raw sugar stevia raw told waitress don't Sweet'N Low lest think they're just no  owner said she carry all different brands sweetener  Lots people know use Sweet'N Low cheaper sweeteners why stance against carrying many people want? aren't many choices menu  companion both Divine Throwback  $10 two eggs two strips bacon home fries 2 pancakes  $1 extra substitute red velvet pancakes french toast  friend red velvet pancakes  She liked them  french toast  wanted regular french toast pecan caramel french toast  piece regular bread cut into two triangles  food good service friendly  However other red velvet pancakes nothing can't home  thought prices quite high get  other places nearby similar food more choices cheaper prices  ended spending $30 minus tax tip  $15 person breakfast? don't mind paying more when getting money's worth  didn't feel case here  Also other people commenting decor  odd certainly but didn't mind it  did mind table chairs wobbled  won't back there  <EOR> Finally decided drive check out  FAIL!!  closed  9am sure what's going on  <EOR> This place awesome!! bacon sandwich potatoes best! Great big portions service good  never bad experience here  place bit small but great atmosphere  only open till 2 00pm  wish would extend hours but specialize breakfast lunch  <EOR> A very cute small cafe  some pretty great breakfast options   Everything certainly made scratch  staff friendly but your face friendly   slow enough chef even came see things which nice   food all quite good gravy delicious   also priced reasonably all except coffee which $4 fancy drink just cup coffee  definitely back  <EOR> I also wrote your Facebook page   Your food fantastic!  just two suggestions   Please note while own business restaurant however advice applies every business   Because own business look fellow small business owners   explain below think something great rare your food amazing want see succeed   am only writing seeing your new hours just opening few months ago write did see website only way writing you   First your hours  Being new business pay your dues being open longer   Ask any business owner tell beginning put your hours succeed build relationships regulars developing relationships them   11am 2pm during weekdays would okay if located downtown would all lawyers business' eating lunch rush hours but located residential area where most work stay home moms just starting day being located can't see aren't open 5pm   also loose future customers regulars   am saying past experience   business open 6 days week long hours but emergencies sometimes post letter door saying opening late am closed day can't tell bad pissed people off would write wasted drive unprofessional right quite annoying when see business closed driving especially when its during business hours   first thought just being petty but learned quickly many people pissed off   Eventually growing cut down your hours but now can't   Because your rarely open people just give all together most don't memorize your hours every time come your closed   Your food great once word gets also customers other areas town drive eat your place but give time word keep getting referrals if drive your closed loose them good   11am 2pm just pointless open noon 9pm thought closing 5pm bad but 2pm just good   Secondly know expensive signs but good future investment would Divine Eatery letter sign next your Cafe Sign above or replace Cafe    know glass window door but missing ton business orders because lot people don't know your business name can't call info 411 your number just see Cafe no think looking window   When first open called 411 order did know your name nothing coming Café off Hualapai   lot people would probably prefer take just off work don't want cook meal family would place take order you  suggestion maybe small clean classy banner put above Cafe sign City allows file 6month temp sign such banner I business your allowed file once year fee $100   Now don't know your landlord rules but sure if pick nice clean looking banner no problems  But would give time save new sign I know expensive most simple signs start $5 000 But your food good know if eventually open dinner during week ton take orders   business experience learned pay your dues beginning no shortcuts takes time time word time referrals but once give time could really pay off   Whatever don't frustrated give up!   Also don't shy ask some food critics food journalists try your food write article your place doesn't hurt ask   Sorry trying overbearing but know something special want see grow your full potential because some business experience look fellow small business owners even when place to if see some things could help them offer advice  know when open business its your dream most gave everthing just keep dream burning small mistake could close you   But doing great job said above your food delicious!

The menu just two page flyer but all offerings you'd expect 9 am 5 pm cafe very reasonable prices  The drinks ranged fountain sodas flavored teas hot cold coffee  coffee extremely hot but little weak taste sweeteners available only sugar turbinado cane sugar Stevia Raw  think natural no preservatives thought restaurant  Still prefer Splenda   Finally food  Divine Biscuits Gravy which besides two biscuits pork turkey gravy came cubed potatoes home fries two eggs any style  biscuits yellow layered flaky kind which fancy  prefer buttermilk biscuits but tasted good  gravy bit bland no meaty flavor  suspect because restaurant new small portions gravy doesn't time soak flavor meat? Perhaps even making plain gravy then adding type meat upon ordering  food came VERY hot especially potatoes once cooled very tasty  over easy eggs received good too   My wife ordered The Healthy Way which VERY flavorful especially tomato composee which cubed tomatoes basil  She gave wheat toast which light crispy  VERY tasty!   All all very good experience  going back again bringing teenage children  believe foundation already place most notably great service place going build something amazing glad experience it    Walt D LV <EOR> Food great! pulled pork sandwhich onion strings inside delicious  love fact offer rasberry iced tea because many places do  service good too  He came table checked things made sure left smile   definiteley back! <EOR> Nice place close home breakfast lunch if don't feel cooking   Tried special Hawaiian burger turkey patty very delicious!
