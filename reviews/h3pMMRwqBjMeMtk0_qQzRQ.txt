Prices reasonable Good small bar The fruiti de mare very good vary spice level  Lasagna pretty predictable Spaghetti meatballs very bready way spicy  The lamb special week tough tasteless   swapped fast fruiti de mare but good usual  think may punished chef insulting crappy lamb dish  To finish night style old cold coffee but comped really tasteless tiramisu ! <EOR> The chef needs come careening into 21st century  many really heavy dishes loads cheese cream butter  Ok maybe some people love ingest 2000 calories entree but isn't possible include few choices light touches other red sauce? I mushroom over spinach cheese appetizer  tub cheesy cream sauce  Way heavy taste  would much better just touch sauce  The veal piccata actually lovely sauce angel hair pasta  Unfortunately veal really chewy  sure whether quality prep   My husband gluten allergy  He severe reaction dinner  We're sure from  Perhaps GF pasta wasn't cooked separate water  Don't know  wouldn't recommend gluten intolerant  On plus side service great wine list some lovely choices  <EOR> Poor experience poor quality food took forever 30 min between salad meal being served     Only 3 tables took forever served    Attached picture lasagna all pile just cooked noodles plain ground beef    no cheese no sauce    horrific!

Sadly impressed say least    I ordered probably most basic Italian dish but hardest right! Spaghetti meatballs OMG bland! Besides being bland lacked moisture bit hard taste! love taste cheese meatballs bread crumbs parsley! Idk don't add theirs but plain! would order again!   As far Italian wedding soup should called chicken noodle soup because  all legit two tiny meat balls!!! never known shredded chicken weird! wasn't horrible  flavor wise but broth kind thick meatballs must boiled then sautéed cause crust! Once again meatballs should tender boil them soup all  needed! Lastly noddles big all know small pasta soup traditionally served with!   boyfriend liked lasagna though but he doesn't know authentic Italian me! Jersey east coast girl all way better! Sorry but plan returning food tasted tonight! <EOR> What pretty interior! waiting unusually long time doorway before being addressed anyone finally seated  ordered lunch menu spaghetti meatball nice Caesar salad standard  But holy hell chicken cleopatra  disaster  chicken literally inedible  couldn't figure if cooked several times just bad bad cooked several times  texture similar silly putty covered leather glove similar flavor  Then bill came charged dinner prices at 1pm held tongues reflected price differences tip  Needless say never returning  <EOR> Never disappointed when eating here!
