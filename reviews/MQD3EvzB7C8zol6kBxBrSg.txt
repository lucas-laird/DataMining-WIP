But way home decided try it  greeted soon came staff full aloha very helpful  Clean comfortable environment  asked popular dish suggested notorious rib that  Took home ate it   meh    different  put sauce where first couple bites good but then used flavor didn't appeal anymore  sure if come back just opinion sure lot people it <EOR> I live area decided try place first time couple friends    My first impression place looks very clean nice really enjoyed atmosphere  staff very welcoming nice  spot basically if Filipino Lady baby Hawaiian guy kid Fist Fusion Island Grill The food pretty good  tried some friends orders yummy  ordered garlic shrimp  excited because reminded shrimp trucks Hawaii  Reason receiving 5 stars garlic shrimp wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy much garlic very salty  didn't even finish meal  tired best eat but man even glass water next just couldn't it      TIP sure check inn yelp your free appetizer  <EOR> Found hot new Yelp  We're town Mississippi visit family looking something can't home  Hawaiian Asian Fusion fits bill probably imagine  counter service spot smaller focused menu  opted pork belly rice bowl short rib rice bowl  small plenty filling lunch portion flavors all worked  While ate staffer offered churro house  amazing  covered sugary goodness addictively sweet! A+ friendliness helping menu  Check place out! <EOR> This first experience fist fusion hoping better experience  ordered loco moco chicken katsu short rib Kalua pork sisig  loco moco seemed relatively tough but gravy pretty good  Short rib tender mildly flavorful  Kalua pork sisig might well called Kalua pork instead capitalizing trendy gimmick  But most unfortunate occurrence metallic wire chicken katsu pictured fiancee's plate  sure but lodged between two pieces katsu slices  Island Flavor still reigns supreme premier Island food hot spot but hoping better experience fist fusion day  <EOR> Four stars because food bomb  However ordered 3 plates all which managed every single sides WRONG  Nothing new people said previously        <EOR> Really great food great vibe!
