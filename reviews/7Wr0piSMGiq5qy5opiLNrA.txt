Oh ya noticed last time $6 iced tea  Ahhhhh hello Long Island Iced Tea gives!?  Other prices seemed very reasonable hotel  back but might drink water next time! <EOR> I disappointed stay MGM where planned spend every day all day pools find poolside food service via waitress  Most hotels strip do  fact MGM didn't impeding time sun taking away 8am efforts grab first best pool side chairs I'd potentially lose leaving lunch  only option to go portion Cabana grill which very limited menu quite heavy fare pool side  would preferred healthier lighter selection  <EOR> We arrived breakfast family  All ordered breakfast burrito coffee  When burrito arrived cold! ate regardless but ask waiter why arrived cold  She later found kitchen forgot turn stove all way? Made no sense but moving on    <EOR> This cafe amazing atmosphere right pool side  bbq burger delicious buffalo chicken sandwich amazing kick it  am big fan spicy food but enjoyed buffalo sandwich very much! <EOR> went first time today buffalo chicken wrap  absolutely terrible fridge long time literally just buffalo chicken lettuce wrap  Would consider getting other dishes weren't just stored fridge <EOR> We ate while MGM Grand Pool  voucher food free  kids ate chicken strips french fries  good pool prices  daughter also pretzel wasn't menu came nacho cheese  think other items sold weren't menu too  Also wanted virgin pina colada but blended drinks come machine  <EOR> Yummy breakfast before going cabana  crunch french toast must! <EOR>
