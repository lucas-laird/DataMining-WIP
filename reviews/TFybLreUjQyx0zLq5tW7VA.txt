So asked sushi chefs how's uni what's market price moment  He told its good REAL good  Market price doable order  WHOA stuff FRESH way better then first time fresh uni Even fresher maybe!  Only thing keeps giving place five stars whole groupon issue which care lot less then should offering all eat during happy hour  Sure happy hour happy hour there's some percentage off rolls stuff but   damn if wanna stuff myself 20 garlic tunas 10 unis LET ME!! <EOR> This new place opened while back sold when saw sushi sign  came last weekend ordered large variety items  Everything really good really cheap  really really cheap  Even better  All food very fresh tasty  Since live close sure we'll back often  <EOR> My husband love sushi just moved Vegas  eaten 3 sushi spots far favorite  Fish always fresh  uni tastes just came water  Price very reasonable  recommend eating here  <EOR> I love finding new family owned loved place greeted huge smile enthusiastic hello walked in   but honest think confused someone else because said welcome back first time Anyways regulars must feel pretty special when walk thru door    I ordered Chirashi bowl tofu ponzu sauce nice big glass plum wine all delish!!

Never left disappointed but definitely food coma few times haha  highly recommend place J roll! <EOR> We arrived immediately greeted overly polite waitress seated immediately  Noticed 2 patrons but since 3 00 PM thought arrived before dinner rush   Waitress gave menu looked over couldn't sense it  When asked certain items waitress hard time finding menu  Unfortunately she trying cater closely body space  When she spoke she inadvertently spit over wife's shoulder   Eh   Reviewing menu became more annoying especially since didn't know where find items menu  fought through ordered all eat lunch kids  ordered sashimi lunch   Looked around place liked 2 flat screens sat watched ESPN little bit until food arrived  sashimi okay nothing amazing  rolls just okay  Fish somewhat fresh border stale  Nothing write home about   The all you can eat lunch $20 95 per person pricey family five  know other Vegas sushi spots charge less better quality food   need work menu being more simple easier font read  Maybe put more pictures cater less informed sushi patron    Since sushi place heart Vegas suburbs don't see them taking business away other notable Sushi places near them  hope but something tells may struggle sometime   I'm being kind 2 stars  <EOR> After Rock N Brew fest wanted grub something   Remembering awesome picture chirashi bowl posted Tony T decided head over LF   Cons Staff did forgot Chirashi Bowl Debbie tasty bowl LF ramen way before chirashi bowl  Expected chirashi bowl look Tony T's pic but instead received less tuna hamachi salmon sashimi   Pros Very spacious awesome decor waiter kind quirky but friendly enough  We received some delightful items house maybe makeup wait chirashi bowl? So now am going give A OK   try LF again    <EOR> Since work around pretty much tried all Asian restaurants around Lucky Fish   Because outside restaurant isn't exactly appealing never considered eating until living social coupon good marketing strategy!     inside restaurant surprisingly pleasant   twice far both dinner lunch  waiter seemed little dull stiff   waitress spoke little English confused couple times but all good   Although service definitely needs improvement overall am pleased food prices     They limited sushi roll selection   Most rolls snow crab shrimp avocado cream cheese   those believe Sushi restaurant no room stomach any other shenanigans but fish!  Young Special Roll super white tuna salmon    flavor very good texture even better melts your mouth !    Grilled sea bass   Absolutely delicious!  might've tiny tiny bit salty the chef could've used less sauce but overall fresh flavorful perfectly cooked buttery texture   I'd prefer bigger thicker chunk wouldn't but decent size price   Yellowtail Collar   Very good!  Grilled sea bass definitely stole spotlight but collar pretty good well terms both size taste   Some parts just silky buttery sea bass while other parts little bit dry which uncommon   Fried Noodle Vegetables little bit salty saucy but did taste mushroom egg noodle cooked well  <EOR> Great quality sushi  no all eat but quality definitely recommend Shufflin Special Roll <EOR> I hoping found Las Vegas' most underrated sushi place sadly disappointed   4pm 6pm only time fresh heard   Uni which heard fresh not   God's sake brown streaks through  respect post pic it   first order Uni would passed satisfactory but last uni order didn't taste fresh all   ordered twice because didn't Toro which dessert    everything ordered Ikura freshest   I tell myself came wrong day   wasn't first person day but first customer   first person come day repairman ?
