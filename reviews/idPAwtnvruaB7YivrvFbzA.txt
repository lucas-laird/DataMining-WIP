An okay experience   It's shell actual fast food restaurants but fills hole quick bite drink while traversing Rio  Service adequate although attacked restaurant when no customers  maybe adequate good enough when only customer   The Whopper bland  ingredients fresh enough saw server hamburger know wasn't premade  But just tasted bland   Overall just meh  <EOR> There only 6 whopper Bars world am lucky enough live near them  Located Rio casino Las Vegas where Burger King your favorite sports bar collide  C'mon all know you've dreamed being able order Whopper while guzzling beer watching game  Now done  Whopper Bar    Where dreams come true! <EOR> Thee worst service stayed Rio Hotel only fast food spot local manager cussing speaking another employee while customers waiting food    this insane! <EOR> First took few mintues anyone come counter take order  ordered sandwich saying lettuce onion only but rang add onion  counter apologized explained meant wanted lettuce onion nothing else   literally just took off slice tomato gave back still covered mayo  willing send food back once but second time just asked money back  place LAME  Bad service bad food   much worse just eating regular Burger King  <EOR> I came because freakin BK lounge  deconstructed burger king  Mehh probably never again unless sweet sour sauce all over  <EOR> Worst service ever encountered  received food  short order but French fries  hash browns cold  asked fresh fries received fresh fries  asked hot hash browns received same ones  asked hot hash browns he asked  want hot food?  said yes  finally received food  absolutely care whatsoever assembling food  understand fast food but rocket science  <EOR> Fast! line door      I really enjoyed Whopper Bar  mean where else Whopper beer?  <EOR> They squirted bbq sauce all over mushroom swiss  burger! Obviously wasn't very tasty   Also fries seemed sitting around quite while  watched some drunk chick steal soda made happy  No free refills <EOR> It's just Burger King getting service slightly different manner  Nothing super special except watch them build your burger beer if want buy      it!  nothing world     <EOR> Never mind all nay sayers place good  other day lunch  good experience  ordered whopper cheese no onions  received food timely manner exactly ordered  Staff friendly attentive   come back sure! <EOR> The only other restaurant Rio where burger fries late night  ok  Jalapeno Burger  bigger normal size but mean little bit more pricey  Good late night snack   all  =] <EOR> There's really no reason eat here  Unless course you've boozing Rio need food fix help sober up  which case when comes late night eats Rio spot  Yep your options indeed limited   So place basically dressed Burger King  more burgers usual BK  But honestly couldn't pay eat BK burger  Thankfully also offer chicken fries which enjoy   And hey if want keep drinking serve beer too   Fair warning place drunks  Things spilled people obnoxious  Frankly just feel bad people work here  <EOR> The staff friendly professional  order always complicated most burger places mess redo  correct first time  Good affordable place eat  <EOR> We stopped quick bite way hotel  Let just keep short point  If want burger staying hotel don't want anywhere else all means eat here  Otherwise save your money  burger king Jacked prices because offer beer  handful special toppings some sauces few special whoppers  charge twice cost down street local burger king more menu items all drink soda  don't refills  no Whopper bar  service terrible food just ok save yourself few bucks any regular fast food place area  <EOR> Most disgusting burger ever had  Way much sauce ordered plain BBQ burger patty's burned payed guacamole which could fit into spoon ants  Would rather normal Burger King spend $8 burger 4 year old niece could better   Service acceptable  Food horrible  Would rather any other burger place town including any other Burger King   Oh few drinks food should even better feel sick burger threw away fries if  option drive down flamingo anywhere else  <EOR> Stopped long day walking strip before heading room  husband double single whopper  Service quick friendly    Our burgers cold only thing compare taste burger patty gas station burger  Totally gross $13ish dollars 2 unacceptable  Burger King isnt favorite places begin but damn least patty usually edible    I return would rather pay even more money burger somewhere else casino through again  <EOR> If absolutely positively pay nine dollars gourmet whopper two am Vegas best suspect only place guaranteed satisfy singularly bizarre craving  <EOR> You don't your way husband hungry wanted more food He's Italian Italians told don't eat mayonnaise  He asked no mayonnaise burger  Course Slapped Mayo noticed said he wouldn't eat worker there  Next husband opened saw Mayo told cashier he wanted money back    They all frightened shaky husband didn't scream anything wild although thought he might he just look thought  innocent guy slapped mayo tearing   The guy took order just threw money tip jar   WTF <EOR> Whopper bar?!? FRICKEN AWESOME! prices little ridiculous    Almost 14 bucks 2 whoppers 2 small drinks no fries but whatevs  all day night  wanted food  Ideally would liked buffet but 10 aren't any buffets open  Boooo  hit spot! Brilliant idea  Even if bk DOES use horse meat swore never gonna eat again just couldn't resist  Damn good  <EOR> Was bit surprised find rather upscale looking bar Burger King restaurant   Decked deep colors red black branded rather well think option having beer your burger $2 99 more   Crappy selection beers though Bud Light Miller Heineken but cares?  joint open late passed midngiht still open perfect if mood meat carbs washed down cold beer  <EOR> This place kind sad but if you're eating then is  wanted something familiar fast while Bacon Bleu Double Whopper tasty prices little expensive get   but Vegas right?!  A medium Double meal over $10 wasn't fantastic  service friendly but exactly quick store itself   a little dirty FYI  It'll pinch but I'd take back room next time  serve beer though few big screens  <EOR> Eduardo cashier whopper bar rio hotel casino   He horrible customer service littlerly return whoppers since he only put cheese them worst all he likes argue saying he right worst experices ever rather any other BK better service   defenely expecting place receives many tourist  two dumbs down   going back <EOR> I don't understand why anyone would want ever   Burger King just fine idea having more options burger sounds good but everything place just awful   The first time very busy layout such there's almost no separation between tables any potential line form   some people imagine crowded uncomfortable eating experience   double whopper when asked pepper jack cheddar cheese pepper bacon totally confused mean point having explain wanted two different people over course 2 minutes no don't weird accent speech impediment    Anyway your options small combo  medium combo which weird because medium combo still giant drink but only medium fry   Why take options away customers?  Isn't whole point Whopper Bar give people more options?  Of course when burger completely wrong combined rather disgusting look fries same normal BK fries but batch looked old refund   would almost $10 exactly     I again few weeks later asked same thing   No confusion order time surprisingly busy despite being Saturday afternoon   first time gone explained double whopper comes 4 slices cheese don't worry they're thin pick two different types free   whatever reason charged extra time   Anyway getting burger opened noticed bacon looked exactly normal bacon any BK half cheese wanted there   took back took nearly 4 minutes ! fix which weird considering no other customers did fresh burger just put cheese old burger   When burger back bottom appeared soaked some liquid   extremely nasty once again refund meal   manager herself even said  disgusting offered herself give refund but just wanted there   Even though never tasted food exactly same stuff find normal Burger King restaurant   nothing special except being overpriced having poor layout having unacceptable levels service incompetent staff    Nobody right mind would ever special trip Rio just Whopper Bar if happen Rio looking burger would infinitely better off going All American Bar Grille Sao Paolo Cafe only slightly more expensive but think some best burgers city  <EOR> So going inside Rio parking garage first thing see when come Burger King     BAR?   What   Is real life?  Only Vegas even  Only Rio Las Vegas!  They couple beers which didn't but if ask them they'll totally tell is   The Burger King VERY limited Whoppers  double Whoppers  breakfast     eye all made  O_O don't hamburgers cheeseburgers etc unfortunately  whatever else BK because haven't BK  long  smoothies though!  Ordered whopper tasted alright cheaply made course didn't put enough sauce felt little plain  totally fast food lines show  when production begins slow down cashier man working making burgers people back making everything else  Hash browns fries      took couple minutes order but even longer them hash browns  mean breakfast     shouldn't some already ready?   They nice service accept LA coupons whose food working them   2 5 stars here  Located across Chippingdales Rio  Which half naked hot men picture if look pictures instead P <EOR> My boyfriend stopped lunch   Figured would something quick then splurge later night   both weren't expecting fabulous however amazing   sandwich front you   create whatever topics want it   best sandwich ever eaten BK   Even french fries fresh crispy perfect amount salt   both amazed would definitely eat again  <EOR> It's true only TWO BK Whopper Bars world??  Damn woulda thought would better burger!  All show no go   This place Rio 3 star because actual BK is   If take way chain gets average rating   No extra stars wannabe mini bar concept   kinda excited finally check place too!  After getting Trekked Star Trek Convention famished Vulcan without home planet   Places Rio Hotel Casino HELLA expensive eat just wanted something simple   burger   Eureka!  finally thought check BK Whopper Bar   Burger beer?  Can't much more grandiose chump change left taking interplanetary beating buying collectibles     I finally place guess what?  Every single other klingon vulcan U S S  Enterprise crewmate attendance   Drats   Damn burger better good  15 minute wait line finally approach cashier   look menu boards   Whut?  all same regular BK!  Damn again!  coulda just left place gone less busy and less expensive BK!  All same items available BK Whopper Bar sans order bottle beer your meal!  dammit why did ever think could order foreign beer it?  All friggin' domestic   Unless consider CORONA being foreign or alien case Star Trek Mexican    Other choices Bud Bud Light Miller Lite Heineken Corona   Bleech   really favorites   Would kill guys brew of the week special Newcastle Sam Adams??  Ack   So ok kill beer settle soda   other perk BK Whopper Bar fact your burger YOUR way additional toppings available your regular BK   But hey being starving standing slow @$$ moving line seeing skanky beer and skanky dressed cosplayers mood   Even more seeing additional cost adding any extra toppings your burger   gave just ordered damn Whopper Cheese combo nearly everyone else before me   Although did order onion rings instead fries   setback?  'Whopper' $9!  NINE friggin' dollars!  Oi yes least expensive kind fast food slobbery   The food?  Luckily just good regular BK   Which saying much   Whopper Cheese lettuce tomato onion extra pickle light mayo ketchup add mustard just OK   least bun supple veggies semi fresh   burger itself though dry was probably holding tray    onion rings basic but fried fresh although wish filled box top instead ripping off few rings   Soda just soda luckily Coke    doubt would enjoyed meal better skanky beer   But knows   Overall much 'Whopper' time me   fancy BK ooooo   beeeeer fancy price included   Though much fancy doesn't food experience itself   fancy fancy price acquiring liquor license place   BK big boys aye much potential sucked down fast food drain   Just      DAMN  <EOR> Apparently only TWO BK whopper bars somehow Rio Las Vegas them   Now admit liked concept BK whopper bar   build your own whopper bar complete plethora different toppings would see normal Burger King?  Count in!  However some odd reason BK whopper bar incredibly SLOW service   painstakingly slow   ordered something simple somehow took 20 minutes food   I guess since around 7 may hit dinner crowd?  However looked set just conducive more 1 person putting together people's seriously complex build your own whoppers   I'm sure if BK Whopper Bars set more subway restaurant would concept could taken other locations   Until then think just regular BK where know food within 5 minutes  <EOR> the burgers good bourbon burger   better but its good fast burger food strip area which hard find  <EOR> Only place found Rio serves Coke!  glorified Burger King  <EOR> We really looking forward going extremely disappointing  guy working slamming trays down giving dirty looks obviously bad mood he put bbq sauce husband's mushroom swiss burger! disgusting! fries tasted they'd under heat lamp 4 hours! cashier cell phone entire time there! <EOR> The food pretty good different 50 cent addons different cheeses bacon etc along free stuff onion ring burger along usual add on   Unfortunately service while busy really sucks ability recover pretty sad  First time breakfast ran eggs then hashbrowns resulting 30 minute wait breakfast combo  Coffee sitting long thick bitter   Next time lunch printer back ran paper something 10 orders including mine disappeared  Even discovery took another ten minutes them realize could just ask customers receipts work off those  Again over half hour whopper combo even served customers ordered later   Other times much better coffee much better next day   They really should just give free soda vouchers folks wait more 15 minutes order    would probably cost them five cents take edge off wait  <EOR> This Burger King relatively new concept serving beer your meal  works  When place your order add bottle beer $2 99 more  If only want beer $5   lunch dinner menus feature whopper sandwiches  some them never saw before   passed beer because going drink downstairs casino  enjoyed Bourbon whopper meal which recall seeing before   spending time bars coffee shops felt employees need more friendly     Overall cool Burger King serves bottles beer addition fast food  <EOR> Yup BAR   Only Vegas fast food joints sell booze   particular sells few beers   guess gives them right call BK Bar  actually Burger King inside Hotel Rio    The lady waited acted she didn't want there   She rather rude   tables empty but completely messy dirty   sad because specific end Hotel dead   No around   Why didn't anyone clean mess  WHY? The only thing favor that   It located beside Male strip joint   being said stopped quick bite before hit strip night   whopper something fries   ate cold food watching over beefed strippers trying pull passers buy strip joint   The fact located beside male strip club random peeks male beefy goodness sale booze only reason am giving them 2 star   actually deserve 1 but booze beefcakes earn star own  AVOID place  <EOR> Other being open 24 7 serving beer nothing special  menu actually more limited regular BK!  I ordered two Veggie Whoppers each grilled onions grilled mushrooms cheddar cheese minus tomatoes   know  sounds complicated but 1 45AM no line anything order taker repeated order back correctly   About 7 min later two Whoppers   Both meat them    order taker very apologetic said he'd correct mistake right away   5 minutes later two Veggie Whoppers but American cheese tomatoes without grilled onions mushrooms paid extra for   Instead pressing luck removed unwanted tomatoes then ate Veggie Whoppers   Perhaps shoulder called Whoopsers?  Is attention detail consequence we're supposed accept when dining late night? Perhaps manager BK just assumes anyone eating midnight probably drunk won't notice    <EOR> Its fast food lets just there  being state literally drink anywhere place made laught beer your whopper  bit understaffed when but service good  Whopper your average whopper  Nothing outstanding but if want something eat its perfectly fine  <EOR> If want affordable spicy burger night drinking partying angry burger bk bar rio you! Don't forget grab some extra packets jalapeño spicy salsa side! <EOR> This great  way start nights debouchery  Double Whopper Coors Light  didnt Blue Moon since im Colorado love Home Brewed beers  menu great  California whopper Guacamole  Angry Whopper  Some toppings free others charge 50 cents Hickory Smoked bacon Onions which raw grilled fried onion rings  Adding beer 2 99 meal isnt bad  Germans beer fast food establishments years    Its time catch hopefully will  also Caramel Sundaes menu which havent seen any other Burger king  downside when fountain drink dont offer free refills  <EOR> I high hopes Whopper Bar   mean opportunity Burger King franchise take burgers next level   Now did unrealistic expectations   mean knew patties would same restaurant   did expect gourmet toppings  did expect 5 star service   However did hope would some creative toppings sauce choices such maybe blue cheese crumbles sauce   also expected would extra effort quality service cleanliness   However day staff less friendly screwed order unattentive when tried straighten out   prices slightly higher BK franchises reality don't much different burger restaurant since your way Burger King anyway   The toppings reminded bad subway chain looked wilted sloppy mushrooms dripping into other containers   angry onions really only different topping menu flavorless limp   The restaurant itself clean hoped  trashcans overflowing floor looked dirty  tables wiped down well   even server  just walked behind counter refuse answer simple question plastic knives because she off duty   No employee anywhere found 5 minutes then looked asking them angus patty covered gold before handing sealed plastic knife   All all disappointing end sounds great concept  <EOR> First off am reviewing Burger King its hippest coolest BK ever to!  1 All employees teeth A++++ 2 The bathrooms didnt standing turds previous trucker ate there  A+ 3 Its perfect when your last $10 cheap eat way getting casino raped RIO  4 only bad thing??? Its way top back corner very eay miss   I mean everyone knows NOBODY KEEPS BK CORNER!!! <EOR> Hmm    well probably cheapest eateries Rio  Also open 24 hours  bonus  also serves beer which why BK Whopper Bar  much selection food does taste any other Burger King nation  If run money because 1  spent clubs Vegas 2  gambled all away then place refuge because least prices food reasonable for Vegas is <EOR>
