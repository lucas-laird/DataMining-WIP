Seriously    My favorite flavors are Mango best mango est flavor ever  Better sweeter regular mango  bonus don't Mango hairs stuck between your teeth   Straciatella usual favorite flavor vanilla     but when add thin layers chocolate shell added texture crunch treat!

In addition options when colder outside Hot Chocolate! 12 different flavors  only tried spicy hot chocolate but back try thick European version    Fun fact ship everything Europe  Ask them it  <EOR> Fantastic flavors  Sticker shock  Amorino a Gelato   OK maybe took little creative license achieve alliteration  try straightforward rest   **This tip order because don't want feel awkward did want pick size pay first even before sampling + ordering gelato **  If check Town Square map you'll find Amorino hexagon marked 1  walk manageable any parking area but think best spot South Parking garage near Miller's Alehouse  If take Las Vegas Blvd Strip turn right toward Fry's Whole Foods  highway leftmost lane take overpass  walk down alley garage center Town Square look left  You'll find place near Brio's outdoor seats  amounts glorified hut but plenty patio umbrella tables outside   If you're really lucky business might temporarily slow employee may stand outside door small 1 5 oz sample cups  Well least more few bites  mango sorbetto fantastic resembled fruit closely color flavor  stracciatella gelato somehow halfway melted all samples but alright   Prices range $5 50 $14 copied off Nelson thanks there's other options such crepes gelato filled macarons  claim allow many samples want many different flavors your order you'd but didn't really test limits   In terms samples both vanilla offerings the Tahiti more subtle flavor Madagascar tiramisu quite full coffee amarena tasty but compelling passion fruit excellent strawberry true fruit albeit sweetened    My order grande cup 6 oz astonishing $9 19 tax   Aside getting more mango few other flavors  hazelnut nocciola rich namesake flavor came actual crunchy hazelnut  raspberry impressive and creamy yet milk less all fruit sorbetti were  yogurt almost cheesecake like flavor employee mentioned but might only wouldn't order future  topped off order mini waffle cone their take wafer cookie which pretty much only useful crunch   Overall Amorino premium experience gelato lovers must try least once  Quality texture assertive flavors far most expensive gelato recent memory Strip like pricing opinion   can't give full 5 stars yet because 1 marvelous gelati around town more reasonable prices 2 does seem place churn experimental flavors  <EOR> Had Amorino first time opening day tried bunch flavors gelato all AMAZING!!!

And always very good snack before going movie Town Square! All all definitely 5 Stars  <EOR> I understand gelato Italian specialty but would loved names flavors English aside Italian  More importantly would loved list ingredients used various flavors  While personal issue am allergic raw eggs would liked known raw egg tiramisu    Aside cashier may exhausted long day however she appeared rude less happy group arrived into small shop    For personal issues would return however party enjoyed immensely  Because recommended others long severe food allergies  <EOR> Absolutely best gelato anywhere Las Vegas  Forget Venetian any other mega hotel no better gelato anywhere else  Flown Europe simply very best  Highly recommended if gelato connoisseur  <EOR> Unfortunately vegas location does represent Amorino brand  used frequent Amorino New York unique presentation quality made favorite gelato spot  vegas location compared quality bit definitely lacks presentation   During visit requested medium size cone picked 5 different flavors tiramisu pistachio hazelnut amarena banana sorbet  young lady worked cone she made center 4 petals each flavor  tiny petals didn't even completely cover center made no sense know Amorino values presentation  may sound petty but only paying quality gelato several great gelato spots Vegas fell love shop quality attention detail  If you're even going attempt your product represent brand why even bother making cone into flower ? I actually asked girl for lack better term if petal per flavor standard she said yes    If fact telling truth its standard practice then quality means very little when you're delivering patrons pay for   I think next time crave Amorino hold until next trip home  Oh New York Amorino's yelp page see ship supposed delivering  <EOR> OMG!! best gelato ever! tried most flavors all delicious but favorite Pistachio Amarena Cherries plus macaroons yum yum yum! presentation fantastic  Super friendly staff great location  <EOR> Beautiful ice cream  basically paying art but really taste some ways  pretty pricy ice cream  Nothing really special  located premium tourist attraction place tourist prices   People come love taking picture ice cream  beautiful pick unlimited flavours  <EOR> Excellent service Nanda Nandi I'm sorry can't remember name It first time visiting interested chocolate hazelnut flavors  She made best ever had Beautiful too Everyone family very satisfied flavors appreciated girl behind counter's advice flavors she let try things helped pairing  I thought excellent she offered military discount when asked if offered shocked see I definitely recommend place absolutely sensational suggest skip dessert dinner many restaurants town Square <EOR> The Town Square actually opens 10 30 10 00 stated Yelp   They Salted Caramel Butter topping spread originally drove all way well other breads pastries however waffles best ever had   Customer service very nice sample 3 flavors she very helpful bestsellers other recommendations   Everything ordered heavenly! <EOR> Best gelato ever  many different gelato stores but nothing compare one  would highly recommend place almond flavor  <EOR> Today discovered Amorino really best place earth! craving some Linimitabile but cold today Polyana offered she Latte Nutella it! Finally Linimitabile hot cold!   Nicholas owner really funny he always takes care customers he treats them VIP! Thanks guys! But really!! Try latte! really good! <EOR> Holy hell! which eating gelato 104 degree Vegas weather often feels like  making Town Square mall new home trip thanks super cheap matinee movie tickets fantastic end season clothing sales  Amorino caught eye made rounds all positive Yelp reviews secured its spot must try list  little kiosk near mall's center virtually looks all others outside  Inside warm elegant decor I'd expect Italian gelato store have   What experience memorable simply effing fantastic gelato is  cruel small which gives MAYBE 2 3 ounces gelato costs $5 50  But when flavors hit your tongue understand why gouge your wallet  creamy soft flavors pistachio speculoos took home me  Alphonso mango creamier gentler version Talenti but pretty close all all  Passion fruit good but knockout which doesn't surprise least since passion fruit tricky flavor master  blood orange tangerine whose Italian name hard remember shockingly tart even citrus loving taste buds   However dance flavors your tongue while lounge outside under umbrella covered tables chairs near aerial misting system despite being far short minute heaven unforgettable one  <EOR> Yummy yummy gelato   think im  just loving little flowers when cone here  thats sets them aprt other ice cream gelato places  say prices pretty expensive but its really worth it   Hazelnut Pistachio faves  <EOR> Not fair Vegas two Amorino locations close each other all CA  This location just lovely am obsessed only pretty but insanely tasty gelato is! It light refreshing but somehow still dense decandent fruit flavors mango strawberry passionfruit shaped into beautiful flower waffle cone  I think prices fair portions quality presentation getting  Service fantastic favorite places dessert back next time am Vegas again! <EOR> I've meaning since day opened but also time couldn't because wasn't supposed sweets  day found myself standing front tiny shed waiting them open  before employee came which few minutes 10am  stickler time but she gave samples delicious gelato she redeemed  Eat all gelato!!!  I tried amarena nocciola hazelnut hasselnus   whatever language speak pistachio Speculoos more commonly known Cookie Butter mango chocolate hazelnut call Imitable   Insatiable   Imgivinguptryingtorecallthename  also some gelato macarons  gelato filling thin would wanted little bit more gelato between macarons  But 2 favorite things combined always fantastic! chocolate hazelnut macaron gelato bit disappointing because tasted more chocolatey enough hazelnut   They also crepes waffles  your gelato cup cone  love cone though because your gelato looks beautiful flower could eat    Imitabile   Inimitabile    <EOR> Expensive ice cream doesnt taste good fresh      service average more below average        Town square tourist area follows yelp easy misguided fake inexperienced reviewers         You warned <EOR> Tried place recommendation  girl love gelato  place top notch  owner spent time explaining company gelato shipped Paris  far best gelato town  Must try it  5 stars <EOR> Went yesterday 8 23 15 around 1 00 PM   business located small kiosk across Apple store   no indoor seating   bazillion degrees outside yesterday thank god misters outdoor seating!
