A group friends recently visit Nanay   food good esp  Bistek Sinigang but all good really  can't price  off time 5pm Saturday  only ones restaurant  When left business picking quite well  only downfall Nanay kinda came back way when she tried leave through Glori holes  I'd back again but those refined palate may pass  <EOR> I really want impress readers restaurant gone downhill within last couple years   Nanay Gloria's Maryland Parkway used good deal your dollar but things changed feel save money much possible   Firstly if children between ages 1 3 years old charged   doesn't sound lot  $1 99 but more respectable buffet eateries don't usually subscribe such practices   Still didn't use this   Secondly they've gotten rid trays   Yes trays   cafeteria style buffet line expected fill your plate carry your table hand   means multiple trips back water your silverware   God forbid happen carrying soup   and kid tow   Talk accident waiting happen   honestly feel rid trays discourage customers filling plates   actually asked them why rid them no could give decent answer   But trays just practical any eatery strongly condemn restaurant  getting rid them   always liked kare kare ox tail tripe peanuty broth which always complemented sauteed shrimp paste known ginisang bagoong    remember used love sauteed shrimp paste   Now tastes if shrimp paste coming straight jar without being sauteed   pancit left wanting more noodle anything   big chunks rootier parts cabbage  not leafy part left dish tasting bitter    curried chicken time dined veggies undercooked happened scoop chicken's neckbone which opinion wasn't going ravenous diner any favors   expect sucking length neckbone just lap last bits curry?  If want add flavoring should remove prior serving   dessert items very limited   always hot dessert food line but selection fruits other sweets very limited   Trying sit down clean table almost impossible   Even cleanest table felt sticky touch   need only remove dishes but need really wipe down tables and chairs better   all think Nanay Gloria's likes rely reputation past   local honestly say customers better off eating elsewhere   am no longer impressed  <EOR> Love Filipino buffets! Las Vegas huge Filipino population  means Filipino restaurants authentic  Nanay Gloria's buffet closest U experience authentic Filipino cuisines just $9 99  Suprise many people know Yelp fantastic location  Oh well!

Would come again? Sure would but first I'd angioplasty clean arteries first time came   Nanay Gloria should really consider expanding place just because little crowded times all people coming take out orders well  said many excuse me's phrase lost all meaning! <EOR> My husband Vegas November 2011 celebrate 1st wedding anniversary searching Asian food  When found place thought perfect there's Filipino place nearby   I disappointed  Service very nice but very slow  3rd line only ordered empanadas but wait line pay half hour seriously husband made sure knew long took  Granted completely fault since people front ordering families seemed keep changing orders but then should re evaluation ordering system  Just separate express line people picking small ready made items drinks chips etc  instead cafeteria style line  eating empanadas sadly worth wait  <EOR> Was excited find AYCE Filipino LV  Let down   Arrived 5 45 pm concerned place closing 7 pm may enough time eat   Well done eating 20 min   Food tempered right    thus kare kare gelatinous along another curry dish   Fried salmon   mouthful cold grease  Sisig  cold nothing biting into cold pieces pork fat   Caldereta   Meat tough sauce greasy  All food luke warm except soup which very hot   Soon figured first spoonful mainly oil soup   family partly Philipino know food culture greasy but excessive   best thing place staff friendly bathrooms clean!

Absolutely! thing note very confusing when first walk signs say pay first yet saw other patrons ordering food then paying  employees didn't look very happy weren't very helpful but could Las Vegas heat  menu indicates could two three entree option just buffet  group ended being charged buffet option even though didn't want but mentioned before very confusing  Fortunately only $2 difference between three entree buffet  ended getting bistec beef kaldereta  Wish skipped bistec really tough but kaldereta tender delicious  should loaded plate instead  family pork adobo kare kare fried chicken pork bbq  only complaints heard kare kare didn't any oxtail overly peanut buttery then tough bistec    So big question when town would eat again? Probably but only because other places similar set I'd try before would decide visit again    Note no labels food if aren't familiar Filipino food won't know items unless ask  Hopefully employees more friendly  <EOR> Their phone kept ringing ringing no one's answering phone! Its two days now! order value your customers pay attention your callers too! <EOR> Our family glad found place  craving Filipino foods  Price reasonable  <EOR> For Filipino buffet place gave great first impression   But few more visits noticed quality some dishes just average   One star pretty good selection authentic dishes only $7   There's 25 dishes include Pancit Chicken Tinola Lechon Kawali Laing Kare Kare Crispy Bangus   standouts Sinagang na Salmon Adobo skinless chicken pork colorful spicy sisig bell peppers crispy pork skin    But don't expect see large dessert selection buffet   Only Ginitaan some fruit available during visits   I'll give them another star having Mang Tomas A popular Filipino all purpose sauce used lechon other roasts Jufran banana sauce available EVERY TABLE   Speaking tables place cleaner most other Filipino buffet joints to     Their unlimited Fried Chicken SKIN another standout buffet dish deserves star itself   Where else would find hoards crispy chicken skin?  Sadly eat crunchy goodness popcorn   good but hell    whatever happens Vegas     right? <EOR> If you're Filipino find relish mere thought your lola nanay's home cooking place you    If you're Filipino but you're dating someone also place you  if your friends Filipino ones if just chicken adobo honestly good place all    It's all you can eat self serve buffet style  favorite dishes chicken adobo pork sinigang deeeelicious warm rice pudding type dish  filling flavorful hearty!!! <EOR> Been going place many years now  Filipino buffet less $13  All eat  actually just flew Vegas some food fix  favorites dinuguan monggo igado liempo bikol express  Thank maintaining consistency guys never disappoint  <EOR> This place cheaper Ito'y sariling atin store  big plus me  aren't lot people place isn't really decorated but hell place cheap   all care about   to go because ready back hotel  woman put food together think rather tired day she made mistake putting wrong kind soup to go box   Oh well  really picky  food average cheap   really all care about  <EOR> Horrible service!!!! Never coming back again  Came family party baby's christening  Did provide any utensils such catering  Hospitality important gave none  <EOR> Went friend pick food party having 9 16 12  He's Filipino he picked place out  picked ton food you order day ahead cash  The seafood platter legit whole fish boned anything  ended trash because nobody tried any REALLY pungent  Come think restaurant smells like  question fresh fish begin with   The beef steak oil favorite  Delicious  Also Tibok Tibok coconut pudding delicious  pancit mini lumpia also good    Most food ordered good but wouldn't order fish  <EOR> The positives think food authentic  for example no labels which figure most people come know items since know probably actually something Filipinos eat  fact also sell balut also points toward authenticity  Sadly am Filipino food expert  Also service very friendly older woman working behind line explained several things  Some dishes  particularly somewhat sweet baby squid baby octopus  were tasty  also quite affordable   The negatives place isn't clean I'd be  section water but containers all empty which particularly problematic Vegas summer day  Some dishes less remarkable  Particularly dish carrots such large slices carrots bit undercooked difficult eat   Overall category 'restaurants would more did ' think niche low cost Filipino food  But place I'd race back to  <EOR>
