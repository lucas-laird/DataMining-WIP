Stayed Mandalay Bay restaurant dinner    very crowded right in    decor beautiful food even better    Dragon Shrimp Cantonese sweet sour pork both great    service impeccable    specialty drink Tang Dynasty asked recipe good   highly recommend  <EOR> Horrible service mediocre food   first sign problem should've only few tables full Friday night 9 p m   first waiter attentive   ordered appetizers soup entree dessert   waiter disappeared right appetizer   busser filled empty water glasses finished entrees but literally no server least 45 minutes!  both wanted more cocktails wine but no place order with   Only person brought food   No checking zilch nonexistant service!  never happened whether Chile's level restaurant certainly finer dining place!!! The hot sour soup highlight meal   entree flavors bland dessert joke prefrozen pastry puffs ice cream middle served hard rock you'd better off $3 dessert Trader Joe's feezer aisle  <EOR> What did taste? Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken others  How long wait? Right away party 4  What's different Shanghai Lilly? Dishes lot less oil healthier  paying for  Food did taste good  Canton food served Shanghai  <EOR> Ate 3rd time sunday wasnt good last time ate here!

I enjoyed egg whites scallop fried rice though    scallops cooked perfectly! drunken chicken ehh girlfriend's mom made way better!  Next time HOST order! <EOR> Excellent service especially Mandarin only speakers but food very disappointing  Basically if live near San Gabriel Valley overseas no reason come here  food expensive though very good quality however really isn't any type specialty can't elsewhere cheaper  place mainly show decor rather food  Keep mind am very critical Chinese food am use home cooked meals cheap but good SGV    Also caveat isn't any real Shanghai speciality food even though restaurant named Shangahi Lilly  0_o <EOR> My husband another couple   $100 pre paid discount spend minimum additional $100   atmosphere lovely        very clean looking uncluttered comtemporary   staff attentive cordial   However when am dining upscale restaurant expect plates removed until all diners finished   Furthermore friend last finish only already removed all plates but served dessert while she just finishing entree   Our tab each couple approximately $85 00 each   $100 discount total actually $270 00   quality food fine presentation good but nowhere world superb price would indicate   food just okay only part above average two desserts came part fixed price menu selection @ $58 each husband ordered   We all very disappointed   commented better tasting take out food neighborhood Chinese restaurant but course no atmosphere!  By way all local residents tourists   If you're going Shanghai Lilly comped  fine!  But         need your head examined paying customer  <EOR> We came off night evening just rest relax all day affair Mandalay Bay's beach cabana's  both mood seafood she chose Sea Bass Halibut   Started w Gyoza which highlight   fish good nice clean presentation see pics but better both texture taste   it wasn't bad per se but just knock your socks off good that would food Sensi two night later! Wow!! <EOR> My mongolian beef delicious companions lamb ginger onion basil chili enjoyed well   Hot sour soup outstanding!

Oh if Boc Choy colleagues raving  lemon chicken general tso's dry flavorless  noodles sticky blah  meal no way worth price I didn't pay thank GOD     So many other better places Vegas dine  <EOR> I once organized banquet around 24 people Shanghai Lily booked both VIP rooms partition removed   decor throughout restaurant spectacular service flawless   There two things Asian service   very laid back unaccustomed American standards service EXTREMELY hospitable traditional Japanese restaurants   Shanghai Lily's lack food awesome ness made balance service   As worked manager banquet everyone very welcoming   most amazing hostess prompt waitstaff served table   Only thing food just alright   overpriced tasted like   bad but restaurant strip prices itself par other strip restaurants food did deliver caliber   couple unique ingredients used general Chinese dishes it   Portions family size   typical any Asian restaurant strip though   Ever Wing Lei?  Imagine something notch less formal menu somewhat more familiar dishes you've Shanghai Lily   If you'd date simple eat place do   But if you're looking wow someone skip it  <EOR> I just Shanghai'ed extra star!  inside immaculate dare say pretty?

Great Chinese food!!  Cool interior great service fabulous food!!  Little pricey but worth it   <EOR> This restaurant held small wedding banquet cousin's wedding   food definitely kind Chinese food made Americans   few dishes couldn't eat due being allergic crustaceans didn't try any shrimp dishes but other food OK but nothing great   The decor ambiance fine trying keep rest restaurants part Mandalay going chi chi look   long white things dangling ceiling then bottom them small red lantern like thing but didn't any lights them some them missing fact     The waitstaff pretty much would expect   Nothing spectacular except hostess wearing chipau sp? really long slit side  <EOR> I Love here!  around 3 4 times    Great Chinese Food!

Maybe because all eat? sure   He made point saying know bring raw meat cook yourself right? waiter took order told he'd return take drink order but he never did take drink order water glasses empty most night think he refilled water once     Our Shabu Shabu arrived surprised such nice restaurant such tacky setup  He brought Coleman type burner hot pot  couple hot rocks pot would awesome but would even settled anything smelled less propane   waiter quickly rattled off contents each plate left rather impatiently    The food itself decent but said earlier nothing rave adequate serving beef pork chicken small assortment seafood  minor peeve fact even though all eat never offered more anything  sad say service lack thereof made worst meal time Vegas    Another thing charged friend $3 50 5 cent bowl steamed rice!
