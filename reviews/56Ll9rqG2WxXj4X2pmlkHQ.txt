Let know if agree  <EOR> Freshness variety two words come mind when dining Sweet Tomatoes   staff always good job keep salad soup pasta dessert bars clean stocked fresh   Even premade concoctions very beginning soggy because already dressed   Soup favorite things sample   love always 8 different varieties choose include many vegetarian options well   bad soup yet   Even when creamy potato gets burned sitting well all day still very tasty     Sweet Tomatoes highlight different ingredient seems every season   ingredient incorporated many salads sides dishes   mean selection vary slightly if space your visits enough   each plate your own frequent trips soup salad bar   creative try something new    The issue concept price soup salad   Over $11 00 each adult including drink dinner seems little steep opinion   Also why lunch dinner price when really no different choices offered 4 pm when dinner price kicks into effect   Overall good choice dining Las Vegas quick self serve lunch dinner  <EOR> So found dead fly salad    after when practically finished damn plate  Ummm yeah   looks won't going place looooong time now  completely turned off Sweet Tomatoes point   Granted understand things happen sure must eaten some other unmentionables point another life  knows happened back stage other restaurants to  BUT    seeing something RIGHT FRONT just disgusting    Imagine if didn't see actually swallowed it!?

Ewhhh stay away dirty plates horrible food utensils salad bar line 2 thumbs down!!!!! <EOR> I stumbled upon salad bar while killing time driving around Las Vegas couple months ago need something lunch   looked interesting did quick Yelp search parking lot see all seeing decent reviews stepped inside     When first walked took minute figure process but thankfully employee right doing some cleaning he pointed right direction   Down salad bar worked creating huge salad all favorite veggies many which don't see typical salad place   wish realized time more delicious things down other end bar beyond could left some room plate!  Once work past regular salad stuff some prepared salads   tried vegan   finish salad bar pay flat rate per person depending whether lunch dinner hours   cashier somehow realized newbie she explained company welcomed me     After paying chose your seat then your way hot bar which included soups chili bread potatoes sweet potatoes probably some other things can't remember two months later   Even though already huge salad plate try little taste ministrone soup wheat roll  also dessert bar but aside fresh fruit didn't appear anything vegan could eat     While sitting enjoying meal manager apparently also caught wind new restaurant came over welcomed gave small bag in house made chocolate chip cookies!  Never before felt welcomed business knew I'd returning before trip over   Didn't even care being given cookies could eat   happy share them husband's hockey teammates     I did return day two later husband also enjoyed experience   Unfortunately second trip rushed didn't sit enjoy meal much but still delicious     I really wish business New Jersey   Next time traveling west definitely keep eye Sweet Tomatoes! <EOR> We lunch OK   found bit hit miss   nice selection fresh salad greens toppings   But some dressings lacked flavor   Thousand Island didn't much taste but Garlic dressing awesome   Likewise Mushroom soup delicious!  But chicken pot pie soup lacking   All all good meal liked clean restaurant fresh food friendly employees  <EOR> A gem place! Super affordable great selections salad toppings   For 12 bucks place absolute steal especially when compared Panera  Sure isn't sandwich option but much more much cheaper   I've twice going whole lot more  Everyone super friendly too  <EOR> I've always loved eating over 15 years  last 2 years quality slowly decreased but today worst  fountain bar always drenched even 1 piece ice Half salad bar nearly empty containers forks  salads point but when classic chicken noodle soup chicken hard tough couldn't eat it  pasta bar mushy dry old pasta  approximate 5 30 when arrived 7pm still same  quality just getting worse worse  don't know corporation could even half pleased allow current quality place  Sad say find new place <EOR> A couple days ago came early lunch Donald  coupon $6 99 lunch good four people  open 11am Mon Sat only 11 15am when inside  When started going down salad bar couldn't help but notice everything looked just uncovered night before  lot salad limp majority toppings almost empty  Considering just opened 15 minutes before shouldn't looked all  fact would think would getting best everything because should all newly stocked  just wasn't case here     We looked menu online beforehand sure soups would like  main reason why wanted Cream Broccoli Sweet Tomato Onion eating some salad load soup  saw French Onion chili Cream Broccoli Turkey Noodle Dill Potato Split pea  missing?
