Ahhhhhhhhh!  Moving menu glad see things really haven't changed  some slight changes but think  more just fit theme being casino  There's still riduclous amount things choose including famous giant pancakes bunch savory items breakfast lunch dinner even late night snack  Most importantly though won't paying more eat same food just because you're Las Vegas casino    Now said   The Griddle Café pretty famous giantly portioned pancakes  Normally stacked 3 high large plate served can't even seen underneath 'em  all honesty portions absolutely ridiculous don't think know anyone personally finish whole plate 3  Thankfully just learned any pancakes ordered single portion  Really all means order more just flavor every time come here! here's today     Eyes Wide Open favorite day  takes pancake batter notch adding shot espresso semi sweet chocolate chips  amount espresso perfect just pancake themselves weren't stingy chocolate chips  Even being stuffed rafters just couldn't stop eating one   Mouthful Yum just bursting flavor texture too  There's Godiva Chocolate Liqueur brown sugar banana batter then topped fresh whipped cream sprinkles crushed Butterfinger  definitely sweeter option menu but good one   Barry Yellow Fruity tart fresh delicious  ones raspberry lemon mixed into batter  Both flavors present without hiding other great option berry lovers don't want something sweet   Tis' Season Even though least favorite day means nothing bad whatsoever  easily some best pumpkin pancakes you're going find town  pumpkin flavor isn't overpowering aren't mushy lot them tend be  Solid choice anyone likes pumpkin   Between visits LA SLS location probably tried close 10 pancake choices  far favorite pancakes any restaurant!

Lastly service  really bummed hear some fellow Yelpers terrible service morning before   always bad thing hear it' sucks deal many issues  Since service completely opposite hope just some sort opening weekend fluke  waitress great drinks never empty anytime asked something plates napkins etc seconds  If anything better then LA location since didn't rushed feeling gotten before   The Griddle Café really does bring new unique breakfast Las Vegas more worth checking out  Even if aren't area braving strip traffic drive any part town small price pay amazing breakfast   if ask me  absolutely love place very frequent regular! <EOR> I'm fence Griddle  only brunch place SLS besides buffet maybe   line long but moves quite fast  service fairly friendly if bit forgetful she forgot few drinks but nice when nudged her   vibe cool sort traditional diner    Onto food  Eggs Benedict plain WRONG potato skins instead muffins? criminal  friend ordered them regardless her love eggs benedict reigned supreme expected disappointing  cookie french toast which tasty but huge almost obscene  could feed 4 people  felt super wasteful leaving most it    Overall still good experience  However think place needs iron few creases compete other Vegas staples Serendipity over Caesars  Cut portion sizes down tidy scrappy looking menu stick originals people instead freewheeling quite frankly bad combinations sort music offer more non alcoholic drinks  <EOR> Griddle SLS Hotel Casino great breakfast lunch destination  Pancakes spotlighted come hungry  pancakes apparently made please Sumo wrestlers!

No worries    The Griddle Café extensive breakfast menu also build your own burger   Trust me   The Griddle Cafe worth it    Long Review LA location impressed pancakes French toast service  disliked LA location wait   Yup those fools waited over hour breakfast LA location  didn't regret meal but wasn't heading back anytime soon due wait   Now they're Las Vegas inside SLS wait isn't bad   know means?  means monster breakfast Mel C fork     So what's good?  Well thoughts  Peanut Bubba French Toast If you're peanut butter lover then you'll love this   French toast  dipped peanut butter?  Enough said   Texture crunchy outside peanut buttery inside   love peanut butter taste   NOTE LA location   LV menu well  Sow Your Oats Cinnamon Honey Rolled Oats??? Imagine your typical bowl oatmeal cinnamon   Well  Sow Your Oats stack  Texture different but popular stacks  NOTE LA location   LV menu well  The Golden Ticket banana lovers there   don't eat much fruit due allergies but willing take risk sampling bad boy   Banana caramel walnuts all combined create masterpiece  Pure Imagination basically Build Your Own burger sandwich   Yes this   love pancakes but craving sandwich burger last visit here   them create chicken sandwich mushrooms jack cheese green chili   sloppy but good   huge plus side steak fries  Chicken Breast Egg Whites Yup   I boring visits   Actually supplemented chicken breast egg whites meals   Taste wise   it's just grilled chicken breast eggs whites   Nothing special  NOTE LA location   LV menu well  Tortilla Chips Why even mention this?  Because good addicting  Fresh crispy airy would describe them     Overall isn't thing disappointing   Also don't let price meals fool you   low price most meals backed monster servings   whole order pancakes easily serves 4 people two Mel C's     I would probably give LA location 4 stars star drop due wait   But location wait wasn't bad they're local me   5 stars is   Yeah Buddy!

When friends ordered sides bacon he very excited  knows maybe having bacon selling competition day  Anyway last straw when eating delicious pancakes he came made ANOTHER bacon comment  He asked pancakes said amazing he said Yeah but probably good since didn't bacon side   Ummm      It wasn't just though   Water glasses coffee cups empty table far long  asked more cream glass ice to go boxes  He brought thing time ask each time else said needed  ok    I definitely back hope different server he really ruined first trip Griddle  food just good give another try! <EOR> Came around 2 00 Saturday place packed! guess everyone wakes late Vegas  just 2 people 5 minute wait  waitress came take order check promptly frequently   The food once past shock factor size portions pretty mediocre    We Hoagie Omelet Addicted Noisella Nutella french toast     The hoagie omelet comes griddle potatoes garlic bread  Hooo boy eating garlic bread able keep vampires away week! omelet quite dense came sausage cheese inside bell peppers onions top  mostly eggs cheese just little bit sausage  wish onions grilled several pieces onion skin present  far flavor hearty dousing tapatio required preference   The french toast huge came plenty nutella  wonder big nutella jar back    mmmmmm  french toast pretty thin though  thick slices toast lots egginess but suppose if toast thicker big would never able soak anything    At first blush although prices high think pretty good deal huge portions are  But then realize just paid $5 side bacon 4 pieces! Yowch!   Overall if wasn't novelty massive portion sizes although doesn't really seem novelty days 24 hour breakfast close strip really sure there's anything exciting come for  <EOR>
