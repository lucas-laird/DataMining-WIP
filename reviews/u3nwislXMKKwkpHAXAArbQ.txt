Where did come from? food mediocre best fact would considered bad quality if used San Francisco area restaurants but assume there's just much reasonable Chinese food Vegas though say am disappointed seem lot Chinese restaurants drive around would think there's some competition really wonder if other Chinese restaurants even edible   For example boiled chicken disaster  never seen boiled chicken stale obviously microwaved 'pool' yellowish oily water plate  Never ever seen any Chinese restaurant life    Fried string bean boy did use oil 10 years old cook it?  Or perhaps just unlucky day    Service attentive though waitress really did try best  <EOR> This place hit miss  Sometimes great food some time mediocre  Came summer place doesn't even AC very uncomfortable hard enjoy your food  Just last weekend ask wait staff how's roast duck because  usually gage good Chinese restaurant most places just awful duck usually reheat according wait staff she said good took word ordered it  totally reheated duck probably microwave then gone thru hot oiled wok crisp skin  Also asked fresh vegetable day order hollow Chinese vegetable garlic but instead baby back choi  Didn't bother sending back! Crispy fried noodle seafood bland  Husband ordered fried intestine usually any thing fried would good but he said wasn't freshest tell he meant when smell stinkyness it  Don't think we'll coming back long while! <EOR> Not good all  add soy spice just Fuk Jin Seafood fried rice edible  Looked $14 TV dinner chicken place most seafood  Strangely menu didn't mention chicken  ask included dessert  guess didn't spend enough $14 fried rice!
