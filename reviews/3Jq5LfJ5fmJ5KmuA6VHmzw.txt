The views Strip place great food good high tech driving range cool  bowling where rent lane but instead paying per game pay per hour  Oh every player also needs pay membership    We group 15 three hours  Some food some didn't  Most hit few balls some didn't  half food estimated average food drink bill per person maybe $35 stretching it  means cost over $675 golf   $225 per hour! each lane $112 50 per hour  Maybe added huge tip into bill but couldn't find it   The place fun but $1 200 worth fun  <EOR> Paid all inclusive premium bar package only surprised very simple drink included package  only did server inform party fact drink included but she also ordered additional drinks without being prompted thus incurring further charges  Great location great product very poor service  <EOR> 1st level ground level BELOW where check in and desirable opinion there's no view feels secluded lack TV's stuff going cannot really see targets higher elevated levels   Choose least level 2    Be careful where park!  Staff put fence behind car blocked all sides cars fence  acted doing favor letting leave     DO CHOOSE DELAY YOUR CHECK IN TIME!

So I'd say first hour being just awkward annoying just staff service alone  finally checked waiting walked bay  girl check didn't much personality she lacked confidence well  Everything seemed bit unorganized  walked bay wish remembered name finally someone personality cracking some jokes made laugh  finally played some TopGolf having good time  when 108 degrees outside @4pm  assumed would AC which looks set but wasn't on working    The game itself lot fun  bit pricey but didn't mind spending money  staff seems inexperienced lost shows wasn't lot fundamental training done guidance management  employees just seem really socially awkward goofy which okay but some level professionalism  Hopefully tie loose ends staff everything seamless check ordering check farewell  <EOR> Nice place hang friends few drinks  golfing experience comparable bowling  <EOR> Fun place party   Don't eat any uncooked food lettuce cold slaw      !!! Food handling big issue  <EOR> Very very fun  Food drink prices no where near expensive some casino restaurants clubs bars  Very friendly attentive staff  pool good private parties  Very cool GPS technology golf balls  Lots bar lots places sit mingle even live band  Love place  <EOR> If serious golf care competition wouldn't recommend coming unless your own clubs  default selection joke someone uses steel clubs you're screwed if you've never hit graphite clubs    Other atmosphere great fun drink hit balls but don't count playing competitively unless your own clubs  <EOR> I skeptical place going but must admit genuinely surprised  food great took dip pool enjoyed drinks watched all friends whack some balls  night live band which nice compared yet another Vegas club mix   Next time Vegas    back bring few more friends! <EOR> Another great visit great venue!!! blast playing few hours getting drinks food  All great  Only thing noticed golf balls hit very dead  probably getting old hit lot??

The reason knock off star because usually always wait  While many bays 4 different levels they're always busy! accept reservations but believe minimum reserve   I highly recommend place those want some non nightlife activity especially bachelor parties  <EOR> I've couple times definitely fun place when visitors town  don't know motivation would local regular basis but out of town visitors great time whether avid golfers not   The wait never terrible case called earlier 30 minutes said would be  Still wouldn't suggest going without reservation if trying squeeze into busy scheduled day    It's Topgolf most everything impressive even flatbreads drinks yummy  thing little annoying tout locals prices but never ask when bring your bill when matters your ID  if you're local local sure pay attention bill  huge discount but  point!

membership not   also wasn't given physical card even though website said I'd given upon arrival   All things discouraging if you're going paying premium play  The place rather costly cheapest hourly rate $30 Mon Thurs  before noon rates higher later day upper floor bays one's local regular driving range   quite novel attraction likely attract casual visitors town looking fun way spend hour two  Hope place improves over time essentially company's flagship location   Novel fun but perhaps costly trendy avid golfer's regular range  P S  parking onsite valet only comped time review self park must use MGM garage walk pathway past MGM pools center which may become annoyance once MGM parking fees into effect   <EOR> It's unfortunate give 2 star review because most part great experience considering all only complaint customer service sales rep  called April 8 check pricing premier reservations later night told sales rep would give call back  received call but unfortunately couldn't understand name  over phone experience wasn't issue  He explained $100 fee per hour 2 drink minimum per person  told group 6 people  He followed saying everything would total $330  asked repeating everything gonna total $330 just sure  He then said yes  ahead booked reservation later night  When arrived private event desk told person helping appointment  He looked then told $100 per hour  He then said drink food minimum would $330  surprised asked clarification  He repeated prices  then trying say guy talked phone told everything $330 before he interrupted said well didn't say rude tone  looked family discussed them  uncle asked much if just waited 3rd floor without reservation  He told prices finally decided that  looked back rep told just going normal rates 3rd floor  He then just crumbled reservation info didn't even acknowledge me  sales rep left bad impression location   Even bad start eventually great time  giant monitors few Cornhole setups couple shuffle boards course bar waiting area while waited  Then another employee showed bay explained rules everything works along where things were  customer service employee showed bay waitress excellent  Although little pricey everything thought well worth experience  look forward trying Topgolf again although might consider going another location which inconvenient because live southern California probably closest one  If employee's unprofessional behavior could easily 5 star review  <EOR> This place awful mean awful  came party 12 people table golf booked  sat downstairs started drinking overly expensive drinks right
