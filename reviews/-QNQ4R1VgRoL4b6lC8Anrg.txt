I'm going pretend some sort sushi aficionado   But I'd think tell difference between good sushi not so good sushi   Mizuya Sushi Saki lounge located within Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino definitely falls into former category   The atmosphere pleasant choose between seat bar view sushi chefs table slightly more relaxed feel  also lounge area enjoying selection sakis but being real saki lover can't comment quality selection   My wife started off cucumber salad which tasty refreshing   did good job cleansing palate upcoming food   ordered spicy tuna California maki rolls salmon yellowfin shrimp nigiri   Everything delicious well presented   total all food should $47 which very reasonable sushi considering fact located within hotel   bonus dined during 3 30pm 5 30pm cocktail hour almost 40% savings order   The service good but complaint  fountain beverages $4 apiece which obscene even hotel restaurant standards   If would known would ordered $5 beer inadequate beer menu   But lack good beers bottled let alone tap endemic rest restaurants visited strip   Otherwise thoroughly enjoyed ourselves would definitely keep place short list places good sushi Vegas Strip  <EOR> I craving sushi while hubby staying Mandalay Bay   tried Sunday night but restaurant closed 10pm 10 pm Vegas?  Really?    Anyway still craving next day back lunch say really wanted some Miso     The miso soup met needs nice   loves some Miso soup when am feeling 100% ups   However rest meal really fell flat me     The poor waitress super overwhelmed only person serving restaurant   service great   sushi badly rolled fell apart SUPER expensive quality crab sub par octopus cut really thickly     Having lived Japan having more sushi restaurants count very unimpressed   Probably wouldn't seemed bad if hadn't cost $80 without alcohol    Overall opinion skip it! <EOR> Terrible food quality worst customer service   Found BONE Sashimi complained manager duty last name KIM first word she said fish sir  Kidding me   How apology first??? <EOR> We eaten many times when wanted something light didn't want wait line forever reservations   sushi good nothing extraordinary but place delivers!  service quick drinks cold it  <EOR> I very excited eat nice sushi break lunch   The service awful  ordered spicy sushi roll miso soup beer  Simple? Well apparently not  When sushi chef informed waitress beer order she immediately started complaining much inconvenience her  also thought odd received roll before soup? sushi wasn't great soup okay but food poisoning place evening   2 days into vacation   There many other sushi restaurants Vegas definitely wouldn't give shot  worth hit miss experience  <EOR> Unimpressed all way around   Got MB little early MJ cirque figured would stop in   Place small many others there   dinner special things quick   Service extremely slow unintentive us   sushi looked tasted assempled middle afternoon stored walk cooler    polite   quality supermarket     Won't mistake again  <EOR> I eat few times when am Mandalay   just fine pinch     Only standard fare fish selection   menu very creative but right ingredients like shiso something creative   guide them though   Fish fresh  <EOR> I disappointed food time  spicy yellowtail roll spicy  over did siracha sauce spicy mayo  didn't eat much none servers sushi chefs noticed  rice nigiri tasted good  hard maybe undercooked  also tuna specialty roll though portion large but rice ehhh  service wasn't bad except asking if yellowtail roll okay  Don't think back though  <EOR> The Uni delicious ordered another set   spicy tuna roll salmon nigiri yummy!  hubby really liked ikura salmon egg dish topped salmon   Green tea great usually don't green tea   Ama Ebi scallop roll okay   come back again try other sashimi rolls   spent $100 between two price good last night dinner   Waitress very nice! <EOR> I came lunch think should gone else where   should sign didn't really see many people dining any other times day   The rolls ordered tasted almost those you'd find supermarket and kind there       rice didn't taste fresh all   price charging food needs taste made some factory else where supermarket  <EOR> Went family 7 altogether  We ordered 3 rounds sushi family style sharing plates came out   No any complaints any sushi Tiger Roll ordered each round I'd say everyone's favorite!

I used deluxe sashimi but over priced  edamame miso soup everything! C Mandalay Bay gone down since 2008 many food places changed closed but mizuya's food 10 10     I took star off because during dinner loud band playing really music everyone would customers yell over music conversation  still come because sushi just great  <EOR> I've eaten many Japanese sushi restaurants guess spoiled   place wasn't anywhere near minimum expect  very limited choices no escolar super white tuna no softshell crab rolls also very limited menu just overall exciting   just leave try somewhere else but craving sushi much settled roll bowl rice  not even sushi rice also disappointing  husband said miso soup only tofu it   kinda sad <EOR> this place good  tried three different pieces  everything very poorly made nothing fresh  very unhappy since stay hotel all time  needs some serious work all areas  <EOR> I love sushi love Mandalay Bay but sushi deserves minus absolutely terrible unbelievably bottom line quality just horrible   aware !!!!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> Horrible service horrible food  Would recommend anyone eat here  top all off waitress couldn't speak any English she constantly repeat herself could understand she saying  Save your money somewhere else vegas sushi!!! <EOR> Food good service even better  Surprised very busy  <EOR> Best sushi all Las Vegas  Fresh large portions reasonably priced! sure eat least once every time Las Vegas  <EOR> I wouldn't recommend Mizuya dinner  coworkers came Tuesday night dinner mostly convenience since convention hosted Mandalay  really disappointing dinner    I ordered $55 which consisted 19 sushi sashimi deluxe   nothing exciting dinner experience  Service very mediocre sushi nothing exciting just typical tuna salmon albacore yellowtail  deluxe set didn't even uni  never disappointed sushi restaurant here   We also ordered Sweetheart roll just bad  saw sushi chef placed couple frozen shrimp tempura into small oven shrimp cold when received $19 roll  bill over $100 drink a roll horrible sushi set tips    The sushi chef bored bit attitude  Never coming again!  Take uber somewhere else! <EOR> My boyfriend staying Hotel originally walked place few times because didn't look open but walk really far into dining table area even see sushi bar     It far freshest sushi ever experienced prices unreasonable   sushi chef rolled rolls incredibly quick   best places went   loved it  <EOR> The service great when but sushi mediocre best  WAY over priced lack flavor  atmosphere also great  hoped experience  <EOR> Good sushi but somewhat staggered meal Mizuya    Meal started exquisite toro  sashimi appetizer  Some best fatty tuna ever had    I dining three collegues   ordered Braised short ribs pan seared salmon    I ordered unagi spicy tuna rolls    They're meals arrived  Mine delayed 15 mins which seemed just very poor kitchen management coordination sushi chef    Hence awkward no ahead discussion back forth    By time sushi arrived Meals cold    Again awkward    For such expensive meal would expect basics covered <EOR> I ordered 2 sushi roll 2beer  But used vegas reward 2for1 saved money! It very simple use reward  Just Mlife card say waiter waitress wanna use reward! <EOR> This place great quick afternoon bite   Plan going between 11 30 5 order take advantage happy hour prices $7 roll    Spicy Yellow Tail Spicy Tuna Eel Roll   All fresh tasted great! normally eel actually enjoyed it    The waitress friendly quick no wait seat   others mentioned plenty TV's watch game well   if Mandalay Bay need something quick tasty fresh try out! <EOR> The food fresh ginger sailad awesome  proud pricing perspective but bento box somewhat reasonable  <EOR> Oh  Yeah   love some sushi!   service Mizuya personable efficient   sushi sashimi quality top notch   mixed green salad ginger dressing Tiger Roll Scallop sashimi   Delish!  Mizuya definitely food rotation when Vegas  <EOR> Not very good sushi  Maybe its quality rice? took fridge   it cold n hard   Im probably spoiled but when comes sushi shouldn't spoiled?!  sushi craving ambiance cool     but more likely wont come back  I'd better off food court <EOR> Great sushi! Wonderful service!

Although he didn't really tuna he said weird texture maybe wasn't fresh  eel favorite nigiri    The miso soup very flavorful also really liked ginger dressing salad  vegetarian roll bit small made carrot avocado cucumber bean sprouts  best vegetable roll ever especially $7 50 although avocado very creamy    Overall compared other Japanese places sushi bars restaurants strip Mizuya definitely more affordable side If call $50 everything affordable   sushi good lucky unlucky sashimi soup EXCELLENT  definitely recommend place if you're looking some decent sushi decent price  <EOR> I saw number 1 yelp when did search but didn't see 3 stars  restaurant located center Mandalay casino  menu limited primarily sushi 3 selections dinner eel chicken teriyaki vegetable curry  sushi friend didn't state California roll ingredients yet came California roll inside topped ingredients top suggested menu  wasn't wait time since area practically empty around 5 30pm  going back place  lacks imagination create unique sushi roll menu mostly drinks sushi  <EOR> Why did eat here? hungry thought would quick which was  didn't want bother all other crowded places hotel  sushi ok edible but don't special rolls because worth price!
