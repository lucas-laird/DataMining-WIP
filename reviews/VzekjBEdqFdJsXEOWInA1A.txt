Les quantités sont quant à elles énormes et le prix imbattable comptez 12$ pour un plat et une boisson  En résumé Albo Pizza est une très bonne option si vous cherchez un resto passé 21h dans cette section assez désertée du strip  Merci au staff du Cat Hostel! <EOR> Love place  Deliveries work every time great lunch menu good prices  <EOR> I dare anybody find better pizza Las Vegas!!! sandwiches salads burgers pastas bomb too   owner staff always super friendly   Everything delicious prices really great   guys know they're doing no doubt it  <EOR> Amazing Philly cheese steak!!!!! 2 times would more stayed longer!
