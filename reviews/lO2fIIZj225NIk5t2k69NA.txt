Service Slow It took while seated even when restaurant did appear busy  being seated servers did take while ask orders  fan service all   Food better I ordered BBQ sandwich fries  very disappointed tiny sandwich which think overpriced  fries ok came warm seasoned but nothing ordinary   Summary worth it! Chinatown real food  If you're looking Chinese Hong Kong types foods you're better off going Las Vegas' Chinatown  If you're down appear posh dine nice looking silverware but slow service less mediocre food give place shot! <EOR> The food HONG KONG's even name   also expensive  value money  never come back  <EOR> By far most disappointing place palazzo resort bad service bad food overpriced authentic all its joke <EOR> It's Thanksgiving day am thankful for? decision stop Hong Kong Cafe lunch!  For those familiar dining Palazzo Venetian merely rebranded Zine restaurant   interior bit different but menu mostly same some Hong Kong items added   all Vietnamese Satay soup don't oxtail anymore only Filet   Whatever super good   also excited getting some Fried Fish Balls Curry   important term here   Service hideously bad! Sat good 15 minutes before server deigned come over ask if we'd something drink   took another good 15 minutes before he came back see if wanted order food   Here's worst part weren't busy saw same server three different tables full white people   hate calling kind stuff but no lie he table near 5 times interim between asking water being able order food  4 white people 4 Asian people   Perhaps also 'important' 'high rollers' whatever end day money same sir shitty waiter   We finally ordered food waiter when he comes back confirm order asks if ordered Edamame  say no no edamame  Fried Fish Balls Curry   He says The curry sauce spicy  mind doubt it    loud Yes know   spicy   Extra if can  He says ok leaves   good 15+ minutes until flag someone else down refill water try order beer   Vegas! close hour no food no drinks  WTF?!?!  Food finally comes trolley cart nice but totally clueless food runner does Fish Balls Kim Chee any bowls spoons soup   explain her   She comes back few minutes later bowls all   While waiting try some soup chopsticks we would use them whole time but Jim G's mom friend us need spoons   soup super cold noodles congealed mess underneath film developed top   clueless food runner brings Fish Balls  cold flavorless   totally enough   Jim G  find manager even took good 5+ minutes come by! Michelle manager perfect attitude beginning   She apologetic wanted replace everything had   Unfortunately point where didn't want patronize establishment any way   She gladly offered pay two beers plus food ordered   She didn't feel need offer pay dining companions' food   Now claimed food fine but considering way afternoon unfolded everyone uncomfortable even food 'fine ' no dined well   would've even more generous gesture pick whole bill   clueless waiter continued check nearby table non white people  When he came back he gall ask if needed something else! hadn't seen more 40 minutes manager already few times    Jim G  walked having beer few bites Kim Chee   all options Palazzo Venetian complex sure never waste any time dining establishment   When food made well servers deign pay any attention might nice time here   If then why pay top dollar treated shit?  No thanks  <EOR> There plenty dining options choose Palazzo Venetian building   don't pick one   We started Xiao Long Bao Dan Dan noodles  XLB no soup dried out  Dan Dan noodles tasted heated instant ramen  much flavor   The next items pork shiu mai lettuce wraps  Both items average   For price location would choose any other options building  <EOR> Slowest Chinese restaurant ever experienced  Food over priced subpar  Ordered pho sweet sour chicken spicy sautéed scallops sea bass chicken fried rice  Bland bland bland      <EOR> I hesitated try Hong Kong Cafe because ratings low but pretty decent   going skip whole value bit   Vegas hotel     Szechwan Eggplant 4 star   spicy enough but tangy   Steamed Sole Fish 4 star   Simply steamed ginger scallions soy sauce   would order again   perfect comfort dish several days eating out   Wonton Noodle Soup 3 star   Pass by   suspect noodles dry noodles don't taste quite good   wontons bad but good   doesn't taste classic Hong Kong style wontons   subpar wonton noodle soup Caesar Palace food court Ah So    Note rice does come eggplant fish dishes   Order rice separately  <EOR> Just another run mill Chinese sprouted Vegas hotels last few years   The food mediocre course Americanized  The service terrible  Lots waiters hanging around doing everything but taking care guests   If hankering good Chinese food Vegas head Chinatown <EOR> Horrible experience! Can't believe hotel resort caliber Palazzo tolerates low level quality!  We entered 2pm lunch sat promptly but greeted 10 minutes  server barely spoke English could understand menu questions   The edamame lukewarm lacked salt any flavoring   beef broccoli lacked much flavor   Chicken soup tepid again very little flavor   The restaurant crowded all   We never come back restaurant  <EOR> I'm sure why says PALAZZA but ate Hong Kong Café   Their service superb   to extent   knew when put more water into glasses w having flag them down   swoop empty plates right time move other plates like appetizers center table   adjust everything just perfect fill everything perfectly   if read your mind   even brought check right moment   know where soon while still food table its long time finished your meal   good true tried pick bill fold weren't ready just yet picked up   But cool   Service wise excellent   Food ordered oven roasted duck rice   Excellent   compare usual spot order duck from?  No   All say each place unique taste flavor cannot compare each to   duck very flavorful moist tender     We ordered chicken wings appetizers two orders   some reason orders spicier other   plate brother sister took when took bite  immediately said oh g' spicy  happen take other plate minute looking them talking about?  isn't spicy  yes whatever reason set chicken wings way spicier other   For dessert tried egg tart   crust excellent IF meat product it   egg custard part wasn't all great   wasn't sweet all   if give stars five five being awesome would one     So all being said Happy EATINGS! @  }    <EOR> I'd give 3 5 stars  Service attentive speedy  If you're vegan rice rolls plain house sauce  House sauce basically just palette 3 sauces sesame yum sriracha if spicy hoisin don't eat if you're vegan   liked rice rolls just fine but we're Bay Area still good Cooking Papa's! parents seemed enjoy leung mein wong best husband said chicken rice good too  Dad said Macau styled BBQ nothing write home about  Overall very solidly average experience food wise  Environment pretty clean though because hey Palazzo! <EOR> Wow haven't such bad service quite some time!   When restaurant used Zine never received bad service but also never best  service Hong Kong cafe takes new low  waiter lost except certain tables weren't white  received food multiple returns table before ever food  Some food finally arrived missing half dishes  Oh gets better food cold    I complained manager she extremely nice apologetic  little late  Beware  <EOR> After watching BAZ Musical Mashup gambling Palazzo decided small bites drinks Hong Kong Cafe located edge casino  service bit slow side but weren't rush leave  great place conversation   For drinks ordered Iced Citrus Honey Tea which consisted honey yuzu citron honey  Other guests party ordered following cocktails Exhilaration Oriental Moon  Exhilaration consisted blend Grey Goose Ty Ku Cucumber Sake Fresh Ginger Fresh Crushed Cucumber Fresh Lemon Juice Lemongrass Strip Club Soda  Oriental Moon consisted Malibu Ty Ku Coconut Sake Moonstone Coconut Lemongrass Sake Lemongrass Syrup Fresh Lemon Juice Orange Pineapple Juice  Both cocktails delicious but surprisingly light alcohol content    For snacks shared Pan Fried Chicken Pot Stickers Steamed Shanghainese Pork Dumplings  Both you'd expected them like  served different sauces dumplings served ponzu sauce while XLB served black vinegar ginger  <EOR> Just because restaurant Palazzo doesn't mean good quality food! shrimp fried rice fried     nor rice  chef took boiled white rice boiled cocktail size shrimp mixed pre cooked egg yolks raw green onion    I also ordered shrimp pork wonton soup which arrived luke warm lot flavor  don't depend soy sauce flavor food but case meal    I feel would better off going Panda Express Fashion Show Mall!! <EOR> Another high end Chinese dining place Hong Kong Cafe's food does warrant high prices   Because friends craving Chinese food while staying Palazzo all decided down Hong Kong Cafe   Given previous experience Chinese restaurants Vegas see Noodle Shop should already set expectation low steered friends elsewhere   When enter modern chic subtle decorative pieces let know eating Chinese restaurant   Because pretty much empty greeted seated immediately     However stated other reviews all food items ridiculously overpriced   ordered Poached Chicken Ginger Sauce   Especially priced $15 95 hoping entree sized plate but instead insulted paltry two pieces chicken   Although dish flavored okay does come rice which pay extra two dollars for    better off getting Hainan Chicken Rice which friend got   basically same thing bigger mound rice would side rice   Sure service decent though pretty much no else eating    If craving Asian food Vegas succumb trap  <EOR> Came Sunday afternoon lunch  crowded good atmosphere service  Food potstickers shrimp tempura not greasy all Kung pow chicken fried rice  All very good taking leftovers home  dessert mochi crispy sesame balls interesting really sweet but I'd say good  comparison other Chinese restaurants off strip same little better  <EOR> Well wish read Yelp reviews before walked first seat everyone way back when peak place ghost town  Service slow stuck up  Food ok but way over priced tiny portions  Would eat again  3 people entry counter when left could say anything  Simple thanks coming would nice    Lastly no hot sauce table asked some fried chile oil deer headlight stare back no clue meant first brought dish oil then hot sauce point gave up   Every Chinese place ever table   Will back  <EOR> We eat every time stay Palazzo  every year  enjoy food service  food tasty decent  <EOR> Food mediocre considering price  Food came slowly service terrible  aware restaurant automatically charged 15% extra even though left 10% tip return minimal service received  Can't believe restaurant Palazzo doing such shifty things  <EOR> This very typical Hong Kong cafe  If ever Hong Kong love local casual dinning experience  Fast milk tea  Sandwiches  Macaroni  enjoy place  Highly recommended  <EOR> I wish read yelp first then won't come in  food really good       high price  If enough time please other place Chinese food  <EOR> Price food quality seriously lacking    plenty other better places eat Palazzo Venetian <EOR> Delicious Asian cuisine beautiful Palazzo resort  atmosphere fresh clean inviting  nice menu array options suit any palate  personal favorite Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns OMG good!
