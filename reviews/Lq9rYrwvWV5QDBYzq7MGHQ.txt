Now service very rude no it all zero customer service skills   because sign said Late Night Specials called told many rolls very discounted  truth half rolls! if ordered whole roll off main menu would cheaper then two half rolls  think because late night Vegas people eat less deal? If order half roll late night specials save average $ 25  Really? your draw people in? Very deceptive  quality food OK nothing amazing even sure if ordered  Also expect refill your water tea beer matter    So many better late night places Vegas actually wants repeat business  <EOR> Sushi great Bonzai sauce amazing however staff bit standoffish tea terrible also never charged tea before new other really liked it  might back if only amazing Bomba dessert <EOR> Very good sushi  extremely delicious  remember eating parents service top notch  <EOR> I happened catch Diners Drive ins dives Food Network other evening featured Osaka Japanese Bistro   Being new Vegas depend Yelp restaurant recommendations    Naturally pulled Osaka Yelp reviews bad husband decided eat Sunday    around 1 30 when pulled able find parking space  Warning parking lot very small   opened door literally hit wall   right left enter restaurant but no sign why 2 different entrances   Odd but decided right enter another set doors   run into dining room sushi bar right   assuming hostess station middle restaurant but sure   Just very strange layout first timers    sat table waited waiter   10 minutes waiter asked if anyone taken drink order which replied no   He promptly took drink order while viewed menu   took advantage lunch menu special   lunch menu ordered Kamikaze Tiger rolls addition beef yakisoba   daily special menu ordered King Crab roll    rolls ok   both Kamikaze Tiger sauce very salty   Yakisoba very good   beef really tender   king crab roll nothing special   Overall  Glad tried but try other sushi restaurants  <EOR> I love place!! favorite restaurants Las Vegas! coming years! bring all visitors friends family members place! love traditional booths you take your shoes off tables bar hibachi grill  prefer booth  favorite desert tempura ice cream chocolate drizzle whip cream top! <EOR> I happen visit search GPS  open until 02 00am nice TaTami Table  Selection apertizers main Japanese foods wide addition good sushi  satisfactable even Japanese guests  variety Sushi wide could enjoy Aji oh toro chu toro etc Impressive fried rice exactly same Japan  Although most guests Americans recommend Japanese peoples <EOR> Service excellent  Husband two rolls kamikaze caterpillar  He said least 4 5  teriyaki chicken meal just right amount food wonderful flavor  definitely back when sushi craving hits  <EOR> Mmmm sweet Osaka  some best sushi Las Vegas  As noted another user entrance looks crack house  traditional Japanese seating where kneel take your shoes off  <EOR> The food amazing!! ramen combination  picked spicy tuna roll tonkustu flavor  order came salad rolls ramen salad  gyoza really crispy  best had!! <EOR> My boyfriend wanted some late night sushi weekday  strip but couldn't find anything open past 10pm  door guys Bally's suggested grabbed cab  bit off strip but I'd probably walk across country sushi  sat sushi bar which pretty dead as rest place 11pm Tuesday   ordered handful rolls all super delicious!

drab bit dark decor sadly lacking many ways   outdated dingy appealing    We opted sit tatami room vs  tables near sushi bar  set up   taking off shoes tatami mats I suspect those tatami mats haven't cleaned long time! GROSS    If know anything Japanese culture know cleanliness top list  second generation owners establishment need take note effort create atmosphere which bright clean inviting    Food Mom ordered sashimi tempura combo $22  She said sashimi delicious but she happy rest meal  sunomono cucumbers crunchy they're supposed served way  rice plain ol rice cooked thoroughly  RICE served any way KEY any respectable Japanese restaurant!! miso soup ok  ordered Nebeyaki Udon  base good but overall wasn't impressed    The rolls way overpriced just wasn't going pay $15 $20 'specialty' roll!

ONLY restroom establishment???!!! where servers cooks SUSHI CHEF washes hands relieve themselves??!!  hands use prepare serve your food???!!!! health code violation!   I don't think average diner aware authentic Japanese dining experience  definitely isn't Osaka Japanese Bistro  disappointed say least    1 star rating = half service half sashimi! <EOR> My cousin loves place  actually seated Steak N Shake epiphany should sushi instead  drove all way I 15 Osaka   When enter you're greeted blank wall  Japanese Speakeasy? then turn right through another door takes small sushi bar area  initial view you'd think place tiny  If continue back left though discover place seat quite lot people  Teppanyaki area surprising number private booths traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables  space very aesthetically pleasing   Unfortunately when came food disappointed  really wasn't hungry but tried everything cousin ordered  stuck late night special menu available 10pm 2am   * Beef Tataki Salad looked amazing but lacked flavor  think only ever Beef Tataki Ichiza theirs runs circles around Osaka's  * King Crab Tempura easily best thing ordered  Delicious  * Salmon Skin half Roll also lacked flavor  kind purist eat sushi exactly chef made it  never use soy sauce add wasabi  stuck guns despite roll really needing extra flavor  * Screaming Orgasm ahi sashimi top some salad also looked amazing  better flavor Beef Tataki but wasn't blown away it  dressing little vinegary   On plus side service excellent  two ladies served extremely friendly attentive needs  green tea tasted great perfect thing still recovering throat  Whenever running low tea lady would come back top off promptly   I really hate giving less three stars but must stay true rating system  Indeed experienced better  bad because service decor Osaka top notch  <EOR> Food good but meal told only cards chips taken  bank doesn't chip told cash machine  managers solution acceptable self printed sign adjacent entry door acceptable!

When he asked waitress another one   Then few minutes later she came took drink away! We wondering why she did that  When she came back drink she said she refilling again  I guess drink disappearing first place  BF asked own pot tea since big tea drinker save them trouble having refill teacup every five seconds   One waiter came twice take away dishes weren't done yet   process he would try squeeze between reach plate only realize still food it   finally end meal when plate clearly empty then he asked if he could take it!  amused   actually when both done sharing plate actually put side help them reason don't reach between couple lovebirds   Duh!

Best all delivery them always skeptical getting sushi delivery because food sits well long  Tried delivery though fresh! Definitely recommend place if want quality but don't want break bank  <EOR> Now Yelp offering delivery many excellent restaurants really should option mark review in house take  delivery  eaten Osaka once before in house birthday treat  before Yelp but would posted very favorable review back then  only criticism would didn't serve pickles rice   This review delivery service through Yelp   I recently reviewed another sushi establishment based delivery order  disappointed then experience much better!  The sushi ordered prepared beautiful generous but overly big slivers fresh sweet fish expertly prepared rice  presentation delivery food excellent  even included plastic grass which annoying but least says tried! All boxes labeled menu item included really nice touch! order correct blessing  asked extra chopsticks wasabi sent service eight enough wasabi ginger keep nasal passages clean month!  We ordered tempura well  where establishment lost its fifth star  tempura bit heavy oily  dense oily texture due part sure delivery time lapse because tempura meant eaten hot oil  Even few minutes left sitting cause become oily  reheating problematic shrimp over cooked veggies limp  even though really no one's fault but mine for ordering it still pull last star    This place cheap  balance price quality though order judiciously  certainly couple rolls side would better value but prefer traditionally prepared nigiri ordered no rolls   We'll returning restaurant later month birthday Living Social deal very budget friendly  heartily recommend restaurant its delivery service! Well except tempura but if order fried food delivery your fault! <EOR> I give place 3 5 stars  only time really come late night during happy hour  sure if would come during non happy hour  usually order sushi rolls maybe sake sampler just water  Tatami rooms but place older activity surrounding area feel sketchy  double check car sure don't any items valuable visible outside tempt some passerby possibly breaking in  restaurant itself borderline dive status but staff nice friendly  Although did seem almost into debate servers time over correct pronunciation lychee  Whenever would say lie chee he would respond back saying lee chee   sure he pronounces tomatoe toe mah toe but digress   Never issue place being super busy  Teppanyaki grill area but never tried cannot give opinion  food decent prices more par many other sushi places town  Maybe couple items priced higher other places to  am repeat customer stop again if during happy hour happen area  <EOR> I recommended try sushi friend mine pretty good  ordered white tiger roll banzai roll oh kamisama  gave option full roll half  ordered half rolls  price right service great  place does offer all eat  also tried OG special which similar crispy spicy tuna appetizer  only negative thing parking  real small if place gets busy may park parking lot next business  server named Jared helped he great  Very attentive nice  Anyone sure ask him  won't disappointed  Everything ordered recommended delicious  <EOR> Best spicy adamame town! service food always consistent  come weekly don't tired happy hour favorite  Definetly favorite sushi places  <EOR> Very unique place  bit intimidating outside no windows just door  menu vast  Ramen worth calories but fried rice spicy tuna excellent  I'd say stick sushi if come here  Service great  <EOR> I've heard many great things Osaka Japanese Bistro course hubby try when Las Vegas last week   Both love sushi high expectations going here   We chose dine tatami rooms since really wanted experience authentic Japanese style dining   tatami rooms provide somewhat feeling intimacy privacy nice change   We ordered sashimi platter ahi tuna yellow tail tuna salmon albacore kim chee miso soup perfect blend sweet salty kamikaze roll eel roll sweet sauce spider roll deep fried soft shell crab roll sprouts white tiger tuna roll flame cooked top white sauce tuna poki favorite all dishes slices super thin fresh tossed light sesame oil dressing sweet thin slices seaweed Nigori sake sampler apple strawberry lychee flavor favorite      We pleasantly surprised everything tasted fresh all dishes came fast   Prices bad considering Las Vegas   spent total $130 total all dishes including drinks tip bad really good sushi joint   Would definitely love come back when we're town again  <EOR> I'm rating 2 stars because food arrived very quickly  eating restaurant since cousins family opened  Although food arrived quickly cold portions very small  average teriyaki best   Very tough slice beef very dry  Gyoza over cooked  <EOR> Vast menu really well executed Japanese fairs   Casual yet elegantly presented decor   You enjoy coming back try new dishes styles <EOR> We unfortunately chef first night first table  He came table seemed quite unsure himself when he lit grill flames very high he let stay lit until burned away  He only able start cook thing once until he finishing cooking lobster  He then added raw chicken grill used same spatula knife tossed lobster it  cross contamination disgusting watch  ordered fried rice he left egg shells it  He did no special tricks except trying set onion fire but he even messed up  He kept dropping towels picking them wipe spatula knife  worst part when he put steaks grill   bright red looked fresh other brown  pointed steak being brown he said only cut hour ago  He offered put teriyaki sauce cover mistake  When he put plate bad smell  refused eat it  explained waiter nice happy  still made pay all meals but took small amount steak  terrible experience unfortunately Mother's birthday now memory special day tainted  <EOR> I always pass place very committed sushi bars  BUT place blew away place amazing am definitely coming back thank Osaka !!! <EOR> My favorite sushi place town  Love all rolls fish really fresh chefs very creative  Everything even try very yummy  services alway friendly  open late night  those hidden neighborhood jem   ALSO lots bad reviews regarding Osake other Lake Mead most people mistake two  worst  night day  Please don't let mislead you  <EOR> Recent visit tells place still consistently very good  sushi donburi udon combo teriyaki dishes all high quality  decor could use update but food reliably excellent! <EOR> Best sushi town!
