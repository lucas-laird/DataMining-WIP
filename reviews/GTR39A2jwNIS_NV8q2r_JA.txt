Nonetheless custard outstanding  only remarkable dish   Some fried pork patty salad Whose idea grind some pork fry into patty? presentation poor soaked through oil  thought dish might redeemed through its flavor but alas no good   Oxtail pasta the tasting menu best part dish pasta  well cooked springy  oxtail plain  way cut into little cubes reminded dog food    Quail quail perfectly cooked slightly rare delicious  presentation good one  Then ruin adding small red pasta bottom dish very salty sauce  Why?  The food bad $100+ person  lost lot respect Mario  <EOR> The food ok   I don't remember everyone table ordered but know Beef Cheek Ravioli Black Truffles Crushed Duck Liver $26 mother ordered Linguine Clams Pancetta Hot Chiles $29   seafood linguine $29 dollars beyond me   guessing clams clammier your normal clam   found some distant unknown cove Sea Tranquility   If couldn't tell   Seemed normal seafood linguine me   beef cheek ravioli sure Mr  Batali's idea creating dish Let's stuff everything  tasty into small pouch   Texturally felt eating baby food   rich   Every bite felt eating pillowcase butter   But!

PLAN GOING AGAIN!  very romantic dimly lit amazing food! Pirscutto start main course quail!  Best quail ever quail least once year hunting november october    Amazing restaurant perfect bring special someone <EOR> Disappointing     The boyfriend decided dine last minute seeing name Mario Batali expectations   Unfortunately downfall   The restaurant only other table occupied when arrived 930pm hostess seated right next table which only 2 feet away!We asked move over table   However hostess continued seat other diners same area cramped right next each other   Another couple asked moved well   The food    started grilled octopus delicious! octopus tender moist   chef point   ordered linguine clams which bland noodles seemed undercooked   boyfriend ordered short ribs which ok nothing special   Our server Kelly very accommodating bus boys very helpful   Service great however food does shine enough return visit  <EOR> On vacation over Xmas break local friends really recommended restaurant  My wife high expectations    we've many highend restaurants I'd consider very adventurous open eaters   We very DISAPPOINTED!  Most tasting menus tried other highend restaurants actually tasting menus included many dishes also available la carte menu  The dishes tasting menus totally different offered la carte menu   I didn't think much disrepancy time especially because waitress really recommended tasting menus ordered  2 options both 7 course dinners $99   first pasta tasting menu which wife ordered 2nd regional tasting menu which ordered   Thus able share taste both tasting menus   The pasta tasting menu say least GROSS! It started off decently    lamb's brain ravioli squid ink pasta however main course totally DISGUSTING!  Duck testicles liver cocks combs simple pasta   am generally very good eating all sorts organs animal parts however stink meat just much me   Usually great dish involves some very stinky meat try mask downgrade stink meat   dish however really accentuated stink meat point needed drink more wine wash down stinky taste mouth! My wife almost puked odor just bite! The next course wasn't any better    liver ravioli drenched much basalmic vinegar started coughing soon put towards mouth!!  The regional tasting menu very similar    a decent first 2 courses which included simple egg yolk truffle pasta rabbit ravioli   Again main course really bordered inedible     I expecting nice piece veal but long strip veal really fatty almost bacon which rolled chestnuts anchovies   seemed great idea however more fat veal   Each bite pretty much soggy bite grease point where just couldn't eat anymore 2 3 bites      To say least wife barely made through 3 4 courses just couldn't take anymore it      The waitress basically directed any concerns immediately manager basically said fault ordering something didn't understand simply didn't enjoy    especially speaking pretentious manager I believe name Melinda wife almost left restaurant tears   wife disappointed meals manager just didn't seem care enough anything unsatisfying experience restaurant   manager basically insisted although meal totally unsatisfying borderline GROSS pay full price $300+ 2 tasting menus bottle wine most horrible experiences ever restaurant   Bottom line AVOID TASTING MENUS even though waitress really pushed it  And if run into any problems issues don't expect satisfying result because very pretentious stubborn manager doesn't believe satisfying unsatisfied guests   entire situation could end ruining your vacation most horrible dining experiences EVER!!!  A restaurant considered great because its great service always consistent quality food  Vegas many great restaurants    unfortunately just doesn't keep them     <EOR> Outstanding title review  Anyone loves good food wine must visit restaurant  Four dined tonight everyone said every single course outstanding harsh critics  called journey taste  The wine list outstanding Sommelier extremely professional very helpful  the waiters all extremely good high standard friendly service  Pricing wise its same all other Vegas restaurants visited but food service put top Vegas list <EOR> DON T TAKE CHANCE WASTING YOUR TIME   ordering drinks started looking menu   having good time discussing choices considered splurging tasting menu   Then realized more 10 minutes gone no drinks no waiter   Finally flagged down passing different waiter told hadn't gotten drinks   Instead going BAR drinks he heads some other direction presumably pass buck waiter   5 minutes later no action left pausing long enough way tell hostess lousy service leaving   She looked stunned but looks lot other reviews she shouldn't been  <EOR> I disappointed!! love Mozza!! high expectations    I 3 other gfs dinner few weeks ago  venue cute servers started off very professionally attentive then kind downhill there  would ask random things olive oil separate checks would forget it  ask twice  server nice but little stoic   and  attentive would expect such restaurant    As food word salty  But heard could Batali's style   so maybe just me   but pasta salty couldn't finish it    This ordered Octopus salad pretty good  Probably best dish night  octopus tender   Beet salad Also pretty good  Very colorful    Linguine clams disappointment! noodles only undercooked but dry  said bc al dente  al dente but beyond  Many noodles stuck together pretty hard  sent back  made new dish me  Noodles perfect  However salty couldn't finish it  really tried too  Salt lick    We few other pasta dishes  gf send back bc noodles also undercooked  other gf 's pasta dish wasn't appetizing she didn't finish hers  Another gf mine short ribs she enjoyed dish  tasted pretty good  Salty though    If love salt you'll love place  <EOR> I Mario virgin  No more  post dining conclusion suspected man does know stuff  meal pretty dazzling   We picked restaurant they 3 location more adventurous unique menu   disappointed  fact sent into full on crave mode next day lunched Canaletto  Pasta just please give more pasta  virgin addict overnight    Anyhoo order house made salumi prosciutto perfect pears charred bread both mouthwatering green salad basic but lovely achieve balance pasta bolognese pasta lobster both outstanding   Top quality ingredients simply done perfectly cooked   amuse chick pea bruschetta rocked  toss whether dessert cheese ricotta fruit dessert fulfilled both desires well portioned over sweet way     The room dark yet open masculine shiny walls walls glass doored wine displays  Flowers rustic wood touches warm nicely     Service top notch often actually want converse length staff? incredibly knowledgeable both waiter female sommelier could joined dinner would perfectly happy   I'll back next time town  <EOR> To best part Vegas dining  hundreds amazing opportunities when + your buddies fork over $50 person just ain't good feels just spent your Christmas vacay flu    place if oversalted small portions pasta $25 plate    Want wait 45 minutes food when place half empty?   waiter looks down nose because there's kid your party?  all ended gnawing same rack lamb because rest entrees small lacking  But lamb excellent!

P  Anyway second visit was   anti climactic  hoping I'd very similar time first visit but something missing  service subpar salmon was   OK 40 bucks  felt being served someone TGI Fridays some points which big deal if you're trying classy restaurant more casual atmosphere  also thought salmon wasn't fresh tasting would expect wasn't best quality had  least herbs spices citrus flavors along being grilled brought salmon together nicely just would nice if salmon itself better quality   fiance's lamb superb course calamari did disappoint    Overall think I'd again   only if someone pays calmari does run experiences change  <EOR> Mario Batali your restaurant sucks! If ever want eat lamb brains tongue rabbit ragu calf cheeks bone marrow penne pasta then dumpster diving local butcher shop  It'd hell lot cheaper probably tastier because use whatever spices want your wannabe chefs recommend   could haven't dissapointed    nay disgusted seven years but think save rainy day  Thank much making want vomit every bite  <EOR> Had great meal  Traditional tasting menu  Nice wine list  Good service  great but quite good  Expensive but good  Thanks Mario!

Forget everything repeated several times  The service while knowledgeable personable  Whatever  Everything ordered pasta mediocre fact half dessert melted when reached oversight don't expect when dining restaurant caliber  <EOR> I want honest   I think enjoyed meal but reason why think opposed knowing because drunk off rocker  Now came ex breakfast which Las Vegas time meant 4 PM actually early dinner  ordered fantastic pasta pulled lamb's meat even pathetically drunken state remember thinking myself WOW! PASTA PERFECTLY AL DENTE! Oh meat incredibly tender remember sobering 10 seconds  Just 10 seconds    Our waitress very nice knew tip depended drunk she could she kept vodka tonics coming  doll! <EOR> As per Mom's request dinner  She huge fan Chef Mario Batali  came seeing Phantom Opera during its last weeks performance Vegas   reservation 10 15pm but came early  did any problems getting early  hostess very nice pretty gave them 4 stars because seated very tiny area where people sits very close each other  3 ladies seating behind very noisy flirting much boys seating right next us  Mom very hard time hearing conversation  All hear giggles girls table  good thing room eventhough its little bit dark side seated right next wine stack which very interesting  kinda it                                 Food wise everything superb !!! ordered several favorites  given amuse bouche complimentary bread  Both delicious     shared salad  main course ordered beef cheek ravioli truffles very good  pasta perfectly cooked  Mom Branzino  very nice asked if wanted fillet  fish lots bones its good idea fillet  very good too  enjoyed entree decided dessert  Peaches cream all time favorite tiramisu  Overall great experience  disappointed  Despite noisy people room everything just perfect  definitely back try more dishes  A+++ <EOR> Simply fabulous meal  Three tasting menu every course spectacular  Exceptional service great ambience  All all first class meal best life  eaten some exceptional quality restaurants  <EOR> Before going Las Vegas best friend's 21st birthday asked around bit recommendations restaurants take to  typical suggestions given Michael Mina Joël Robuchon etc but name stood mind B B Ristorante  did research place found amazing list Mario Batali owned restaurants  Perfect  same friend just recently Manhattan college graduation ate multiple Batali restaurants Lupa Pó which both blew away  also dined Los Angeles restaurant Pizzeria Mozza next door Osteria Mozza   Each every time dined Batali owned restaurant stomach left extremely happy wallet isn't hurt  B B perfect choice celebrate friend's second birthday dinner   B B inside very classy Venetian Hotel tucked Restaurant Row  Friday night Vegas casino floor bumpin' suits cocktail dresses galore while walking restaurant  Thankfully came prepared sporting suits well  walking million steps through humongous hotel casino arrived front B B happily greeted two gorgeous hostesses  then led seats against window cozy half booth half table  Sitting window great because people watching outside couldn't beat  all hotels beforehand Venetian definitely most attractive interesting fun looking crowd   Our extremely professional server came over greet take drink orders  Right away felt if teleported off bustling Las Vegas Strip into fine dining restaurant tucked under stoop NYC  looking over menu came decisions   To start order calamari seppie fritti share  probably best calamari tasted life  sauce bottom complimented calamari perfectly adding slight spice each bite but enough knock your chair  devoured dish pretty quickly then sat back wait pastas   My friend big pasta lovers stuck Primi section menu  friend ordered spaghettini spicy budding chives sweet garlic one pound lobster   second friend said order server ecstatic  He said best dishes also most popular  He then described great detail exactly prepared well each ingredient compliments next  Whoa  guy knows shit  goat cheese tortelloni dried orange wild fennel pollen   Again pro status server then described cooked ingredients would taste each other  friend's dish amazing  small kick spice but lobster helped even flavor  Also lobster most tender melt in your mouth lobster ever tasted  dish also fabulous  sold immediately any dish prepared goat cheese dish didn't upset  milky goat cheese gave explosion flavor each bite tiny shavings orange offered different interesting flavor every third bite so   Before meal started told server very discretely friend's birthday  He said if order dessert add candle but don't offer any special mean complimentary birthday desserts  Hm oh well  ordered dark chocolate torta spiced huckleberries   Sure enough came candle script writing side dish  looked beautiful as well delicious   Needless say devoured thing pretty damn quick well   Being familiar Mario Batali's cooking both came knowing exactly expect amazing meal  both left very satisfied  then proudly excitedly crossed yet another Batali restaurant off list  <EOR> I think bad but Batali place expected more   menu seemed similar Babbo NYC which requires very advanced reservation excited try B B able reservation day of     The amuse chickpeas nice but nothing special    We started special day app which fried squash blossoms stuffed ricotta cheese   usually don't see most restaurant menus excited item special menu  light loved sauce on   think around $18 4 blossoms   Ouch   We seafood theme both ordered lobster pasta   impressed   sauce just ok didn't taste very fresh me    several Italian places NYC think would better version    For main shared grilled branzino   simply grilled fish nothing special   really shined memorable herb salad accompanied fish   Unfortunately only tablespoon it   Perhaps they're better meat items but considering paid $200 without wine 1 dessert 2 expected more   If price lower then would given 3 starts but price doesn't justify quality   Perhaps they're catering tourists local repeat customers which explains quality but guess reservation Babbo find out   Overall experience utterly mediocre price  <EOR> I am entirely certain wrong but something did   lighting bit dark   wait staff bit rigid   smoke wafting casino bit distracting   I really wanted B B but situation conspired against me   Granted ate may best pork chop life a bone in number quintz accompanyment but didn't walk happy   if restaurant started off wrong foot could never entirely correct itself   B B won't crack any Top Ten lists food Strip   find countless other places offering impressive Italian fare more reasonable price more comfortable surroundings  <EOR> Small intimate  waitress excellent  Very knowledgeable helpful  Wasn't pushy but 2 3 recommendations every course  She also walked through menu ensure wouldn't order much less  Sommelier paired cheaper wine perfectly meal first recommendation  Salumi prosciutto excellent along pasta bolognese!  couldn't decide between ice wines dessert poured glass each but only charged one  isn't overly fancy  keep simple delicious  <EOR> My buddy ate B B yesterday Saturday night getting around 9 45 last night Vegas hoping extraordinary Italian food   each tasting menus overall disappointed  glass Morellino di Scansano Perazzi La Mozza 2007 Toscana enjoyed glass half pour mini decanter very much   Very smooth no acid no tannins great fruit but just enough    For starters both tasting menus start off 3 courses raviolis   Its just raviolis raviolis   example Pasta tasting menu ricotta ravioli butter sauce lambs brain ravioli butter sauce sage green pasta light meat sauce then another ravioli filled short ribs  mean enough raviolis  next course Gnocchi real disappointment   gnocchi really super firm bordering hard obviously hand made definitely light   again braised oxtail which tasted beef brisket  highlight meal 2 dessert courses   Zabaglione grapefruit absolutely light sublime transcending magical   reminded friend some delicious Japanese dessert crapes he Seattle strawberries whipped cream Zabaglione crape cone   final dessert Italian Flan crunchy cocoa nibs which very good  Overall C+   Portions very small   5 8 ravioli per plate  All ravioli hand made   The Lombardia Veal Tasting Menu much better  first course thin deli slice cooked veal over mayonnaise sauce some capers   Next very creamy Tallegio cheese ravioli which tasted liked warm brie inside ravioli melt your mouth good   next bone marrow ravioli memorable all  friend liked next course best pounded thin slice veal breaded panko deep fried very crispy topped arugula lemon wedge   liked but nothing write home about   very good country fried steak which better more tender  Next very slender piece medium gorgonzola cheese some candied fruit very small delicate cheese plate   desserts tasting menu awful   Toasted panttone apricot jam joke   Cinnamon honeyed butter toast would better  fried Italian donuts dense dense cake light good beignet worth calories effort eat whole thing    They also raised price 100 $120 Thursday March 10 2011 raised wine paring 70 75   comped wine because confusion but still enough erase disappointing Italian meal   All buddy could recall better meals lives     I can't speak rest menu   if best foot forward then would spend money elsewhere  <EOR> I took mama very big birthday  Sorry can't tell which bc everytime want mention she subtly kicks legs taps arm lightly  tight rush but arrived B B 1 minute spare literally straight check in MGM  hostess seated right away   I ordered mom glass Moscato di' Asti which very sweet usually served dessert wine slightly sparkling  glass Barolo Lecinquevigne Damilano 2004 Piemonte  If sweeter drinks then would definitely recommend Moscato  Its highest quality ever had  tasted crushing Muscat grapes mouth  Barolo nice but think hoping would little bolder    We Grilled Octopus Limoncello vinaigrette starter  best! thought going salad octopus but octopus really feature dish and alot it   serve octopus top flagolet beans + pickled red onions  sweetness red onion candied little? contrasts really well against tartness limoncello  But smokiness Octopus cooked perfectly way really dish shine   For main ordered Beef Cheek Ravioli Duck Liver brown butter sauce  Obviously dish isn't faint heart no pun intended   butter sauce alot goodies ravioli's its very rich dish through through  If good but if back 2nd time would probably bucatini branzini  mom ordered black spaghetti nduja sicilian pesto  She really liked much but she's spicy person  waiter warned theres some type red pepper used when sausage used dish why hot    We ordered chocolate torte candied hazelnuts salted caramel gelato birthday girl  mom death chocolate sort girl  She loved dessert but can't desserts sweet  ordered cappucino really good    All all good

Doubt  kitchens fuck dish two any given night but entire meal amongst 4 diners  Did fleeting Mario Batali man crush cloud judgment during first visit? Maybe  much love flowing red locks atop greasy Italian belly wearing clogs I don't taste buds through enough heartache know swindled infatuation  Maybe shell shocked all silicone awful dye jobs taste food first time  Most likely stuck backup chef second time  But any restaurant worth its salt shouldn't vascillate dramatically its second stringer behind pans  Cuz if  gamble take when walk through door taking shit elsewhere    So measly 2 stars your Vegas joint Mario  Michelin stars Yelp stars  Consistency matters   p s  also irritating shit walk into half empty dining room told they're completely booked we'd sit bar while your gamboholic comps gum craps table flanked some plastic flusies  but  vegas what's expected when dining strip  which why try avoid it  <EOR> I girlfriend really loves pasta  The ambiance place so   kinda feel mall because crowds walking outside restaurant   guess can't helped  The servers very nice   aren't attentive other fine dining restaurants but wasn't problem  The food good but didn't blow away   gf goat cheese tortelloni which delicious but both love goat cheese maybe we're biased   other dishes tasty but nothing worth mentioning  Overall value good  <EOR> Skip place   There simply many good even great restaurants everywhere Las Vegas waste night b b ristorante  first time wife ate great but 9 months later come down no talent kitchen  real Chef would never served old precooked leftovers   4 full dinners served item special Tripe  guess precook serve Tripe still right  <EOR> Always come when Vegas  Best Italian Vegas  Great food veal chop world  Super service waiter n team  Kevin  informative  could tell he loves food wine   Bartender knew mixing too  Impressive   Just bought Mario's cookbook too  A+ Well b back Sept  <EOR> Disappointing   service incredible   other couple ordered dry aged rib eye $135 worth every penny   best entree ever tasted   girlfriend each ordered pasta dishes lobster spaghetti Pappardelle Bolognese    spaghetti horribly under cooked even close al dente    Bolognese just okay lacking any good rich flavors   Disappointing Italian restaurant say least particularly Mario Batali's name restaurant  <EOR> I totally don't understand low scoring place  food phenomenal service superb  steak amazing rest meals delicious    It's while since but remember made long lasting would recommend anyone would indulge give go  reason why celebrity chef Resturant food speaks self  Resturant itself little bit bigger but staff way present your meal HUGE  Resturant Resturant along such NoVe Italiano high marks me!!!

Almost   The dish extremely salty  little disappointed since saltiness took away sweetness lobster  tried ignore but enough annoy me  potential really amazing dish  Just needed few more notches     Next two entrees     Beef Cheek Ravioli Black Truffles Crushed Duck Liver $26   I really really excited dish  Beef cheek? GOOD  Truffles? GOOD  Duck liver   AMAZING Right???? Wrong  dish bit fail  highlights dish definitely beef cheek ravioli  pasta fresh filling succulent delicious  complaint stems truffle crushed duck liver the server called foie gras        Although foie think smooth buttery fatness liver  duck liver extremely gritty very strong flavor overpowered delicateness pasta  Quite opposite reaction expecting  truffle flavor did come through all seemed sort afterthought  Also two measly shavings truffle which appeared come jar  guess really excited dish when did deliver just killed me  pretty much over eating two raviolis    Gnocchi Braised Oxtail $27  The server told gnocchi house made  pray he wrong because resembled something similar Trader Joes version  love gnocchi  When prepared right those soft pillows pasta really create euphoric experience  gnocchi extremely dense did all seem homemade any means  dish's saving grace braised oxtail  lot beautifully braised meat flavors rich flavor  If only served braised oxtail another pasta   I would much happier   Ok   so you're probably saying   come Michelle    give Batali break  say NO  Look if you're gonna charge $30 dish    you're highly rated chef    should really paying attention detail  your own pastas don't over season potentially amazing dish don't charge arm leg it  other complaint portions rather small  huge eater although love eat but dishes around 6 oz  pasta person    Would come again? would hard  justify when many other great places Vegas  would undoubtedly back if someone picked tab though = 3 stars service ambiance food  <EOR> Obviously Mario Batali restaurant going great food  unprepared psychologically just great going be    We started appetizer Grilled Octopus Fagioli Marinati Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette  octopus meaty salty played perfectly vinaigrette  far best part exceptional meal  never octopus tender delicious    Next came primi platters  Bone Marrow Ravioli Osso Bucco Ragù  While delicious portion unconscionably small  understand gourmet fine

 My secondi Short Rib al Barolo Anson Mills Polenta Horseradish  gather far short rib best ever made  turns don't short ribs seems  Such life  co worker enjoyed while stole rest Crispy Fried Sweetbreads Italian Butternut Squash Wickson Apples  never sweetbreads before MUST them again  Those excellent    Finally because we're gluttonous Vanilla Mascarpone Bruciato with Fresh Huckleberries which heavenly he Apple Crostata with Vanilla Bean Gelato  Both top notch    All all worth trip if you're taking client dinner expense account you're extremely wealthy your own  <EOR> I lobster pasta thought very good but portions really really small   encourage buy five courses each person really full experience but wasn't French Laundry weren't blow $500 anything less   each three courses even though waiter trying bully into ordering more spent close $300 tip   All all I'd say food good but price outrageous especially was   better food Jack's La Jolla half cost   Bouchon cost less Michelin Star   If want fine dining French Laundry don't waste your time money here   If want fine dining Las Vegas check any Michelin Star restaurants much better dining experience   If need brag your friends

away squash dish flavors more delicate would describe elegant dish  If you've grown accustomed overly spiced salted foods may wow but really enjoyed app  Grilled Octopus however hands down best ever

shared    My dinner included order Orecchiette Short Rib al Barolo   server assured short rib would tender could cut spoon  He exaggerating  every bit good mother's which never able duplicate kitchen myself    Our dessert included order Spiced Bruciato Limone di Torte which fabulous end fabulous dinner  Worth  Every  Penny  <EOR> I've dined other Mario Batali restaurants B B did disappoint  During

My only complaint B B sommelier  thought she bit pretentious tried steer more expensive bottles without asking questions see budget qualities wanted wine  She didn't seem knowledgeable would expect able describe some wines much detail would liked  understand wine list huge would practically impossible memorize every wine but she seemed more interested pushing higher priced wine finding right wine budget   All all fantastic dinner would almost certainly return  just hope goat tongue still menu next visit! <EOR> We arrived little early reservation decided sit bar order drink   ordered martini but bartender decided he something better mind asked if liked blueberries   said yes he made very interesting cocktail but he never thought ask if liked all other ingredients put into basil balsamic etc    yuck!

finally able order sister's entree drinks left wait probably least good 30 minutes before Blood Orange Cosmos appeared glass wine sister ordered Bolognese Paparadelle  should cue walk but being tired day trudging around strip all exhausted take action fired up  When tiny Cosmos finally arrived indeed delicious  However when sister's thin slice flute baguette topped chick peas showed small side plate dwarfed agreed indeed amuse bouche   Very funny   joke's us! some length Bolognese Paparadelle showed up  Again huge white plate serving pasta looked more appetizer  No bread no nothing  All mere $28  Finally slice bread really! brought when she half way through pasta  plate appetizer never removed  joked sister because tiny speck sauce left plate restaurant staff thought still serving left  sister left hungry all felt assaulted music insulted lousy service  microscopic portions food good I would hope so   it Mario Batali's restaurant   I tried send feedback directly B B but email contact provided  Needless say won't back certainly feel compelled visit other Batali locations  <EOR> Dined B B other night wife last 2 visits amazing  We ordered pasta tasting menu split single reserve wine pairing   First service all around excellent   server staff very knowledgable only meals themselves but some history where originated   First course tortellini minestrone   came small amount broth   Nothing filling tasted great   Second course tagliatelle sweet corn crispy pancetta   Awesome flavors texture really worked well together   Third wife's favorite raviolini   ravioli but quarter size filled very tasty braised pork shoulder  came small amount but very powerful heirloom tomato sauce   Fourth ragu variety stuff      Pork hearts liver etc   I am normally big fan hearts livers but actually found most flavorful tasty dish them all   Fifth final main dishes black squid ink spaghetti moderately spicy sausage which somehow reminded chorizo   good well but getting full   Finally 2 deserts   strawberry sorbet chocolate souffle   Both awesome   chocolate souffle extremely fluffy   The wine pairing excellent well chosen   All red wines which enjoy very much   One final note ventured prior occasion where extremely slow night I cannot imagine many    simply asked chef prepare something off menu very satisfied   very enjoyable experience any restaurant willing effort please which are  <EOR> My brother randomly decided dine while browsing through all menus Palazzo   Since catch show w in hour pressed time   price point fair ambiance casually elegant Mario Batali establishment    could wrong?

Babbo literally best meals life every single need anticipated dare say it   everything flawless decor service food   Since Mario doesn't any restaurants Chicago couldn't wait try Vegas offerings   wine appetizers Carnevino which couldn't more impressed then came dinner dessert   glad carnevino first drinks because bar essentially foyer no all   tables uncomfortably close together combined multitude servers made dining sort weird felt constantly interrupted couldn't help but overhear everyone's conversations around us   first course goat cheese fennel pollen orange ravioli amazing!  Next came mint love letters which just couldn't any more disgusting   husband LOVES lamb mint bad he half bite couldn't any more down   obviously didn't eat rest when server came over asked wrong he immediately removed them couldn't any nicer   manager came over next apologized offered help then two glasses prosecco arrived   could dealbreaker turned into moment made B B even more since handled well   dessert amazing!  Overall since Babbo amazing lofty expectations place didn't fulfill   If didn't expecting amazed though think would much more satisfied solid restaurant  <EOR> Let simple you  restaurant should top your fine dining options Las Vegas  Fantastic meal best ever had   Our waitress Brittany extremely friendly helpful knowledgeable every dish wine made evening flow without hitch  wife 22 yr old son

Fashioned BTW   asked favorite thing menu he immediately said octopus   Right money two them table amazing   also all shared artichoke salad good beet salad excellent calamari best ever had   I bone veal chop   cooked perfection great Barbera recommended waiter  Most rest pasta some sort all which tried outstanding  I would happily recommend anyone visiting Las Vegas  Couple things people complaining small plates need head examined   Also good food good atmosphere good service costs money end   Finally read through reviews remember most America consists great un washed masses LOTS un washed come stay play Vegas   just leave that  <EOR> I ate two friends each ordered appetizer first course second course  decided against wine some very delicious mineral water  Overall service excellent let them know only 2 hours eat right time  addition water glasses never ran folded napkins every time someone bathroom etc  server extremely helpful when trying decide between ordering la carte tasting menu    We decided below Starters Grilled Octopus amazing slightly over salty Grilled Porcini Mushroom w Spicy roasted corn A must order fantastic combo perfectly cooked seasoned Lambs tongue w chanterelles earthy delicious First course  Beef cheek mushroom ravioli hearty very intense meat flavor favorite dishes although still quite good Spaghettini aka Spaghetti w lobster slightly spicy very light fresh tasting pasta perfectly al dente lobster also perfectly cooked  exactly most inventive dish but absolutely perfectly executed Oxtail Gnocchi another very hearty dish very meaty well executed but favorite little rich taste Second course  Steak spicy greens forget cut friend really made look amateurs when he ordered he kept saying waiter charred waiter offered extra well cooked but then friend said medium but extra charred outside waiter rightfully some questionable look face  steak came med med rare quite good really prefer mine more rare hard say more  Also very large portion  Duck came med rare roasted breast over stewed leg huge portion especially price $32 very good but wasn't blown away Veal Chop EXCELLENT must order entree  don't enough great words describe it  med rare perfectly cooked came some sort creamy herby sauce stuff  best meat ever had  huge margin  also large portion meat approx 10 14 oz guessing served bone  Again just case didn't point clearly enough before if Las Vegas eat meat must least come order dish  Dessert We berry Napoleon something berriest thing ever had  Served some cold lemon ricotta highly recommend dessert    Also vanilla flan dessert some caramel sauce  good but cannot compare berry dessert    Cappuccinos excellent    Just note table size did find large but did order good portion food trying play footsie under table    I would given four stars if gotten veal berry dessert  <EOR> I must gotten lucky great meal B B given its 3 5 overall rating   dining experience Mario Batali no wrong my favorite restaurant Carnevino B B did nothing change that   group 4 dinner B B Saturday around 8 00   doing brisk business but place certainly wasn't crowded   ton employees if needed something couldn't find your exact server moment always someone help out   We spoke somm some wine options she recommended nice barolo lower end price range   wine list good best seen Vegas but even close worst   mark consistent other upscale restaurants   Wine isn't cheap Strip but B B wasn't more expensive any other nice restaurants   The chef provided amuse bouche marinated chickpeas crustini table enjoyed   started butter lettuce salad served pancetta onion gorgonzola dressing   salad constructed very well   Every bite every ingredient   dressing perfectly coated lettuce but overpowering point leaves wilting   would definitely eat again   For pasta course Tarajin seasonal pasta shaved white truffle which table side   thing impossibly creamy bursting truffle flavor   incredibly decadent pasta very glad came during white truffle season   cheap but would definitely eat again   shared some pork trotter ravioli table likewise very good   Covered breadcrumbs cheese very flavorful ravioli   But couldn't stand mighty truffles     For main course short rib served polenta shaved horseradish   good dish but didn't entirely land me   short rib fork tender cut should everything seasoned very well   just didn't completely come together me   prevents giving B B 5 star rating   wish could give 4 5 stars but can't 4 star rating   I never left Mario Batali restaurant Vegas disappointed streak continues B B   Another fantastic night highly recommended  <EOR> So many great restaurants Vegas   might them   just ordered wrong things   may decide your own   When sat down table waiter brought over chef's choice quick bite   seasoned chickpea small grilled bread   looked wonderful but really zero flavor   started meal   They pre fix menu but skipped that   Instead party four started off three small plates share   clear standout octopus recommended waiter   fabulous   best octopus ever had   Super tender flavorful   But definitely best thing had    charcuterie plate just plain bland especially head cheese simply thin slice tasteless fat     We finished protein plate menu share    pork bit flavorless  know good when left couple pieces uneaten expensive entrée plate  <EOR> We ate Mozza L A two weeks ago blown away opted B B while spending weekend Vegas    rather disappointing    The food OK  but even close level Mozza while charging same prices   staff kept referencing Mario Batali during table service ie  Mario doesn't use knifes primi course   but gotta tell last time think Mario grand opening   underwhelming     esp $180 no booze price tag  <EOR> I general policy avoid Celebrity Chef restaurants plague BUT friend told outstanding   am forced concur Oxtail gnocci just wonderful then overshadowed sheer GLORY Veal Shank!  eat whenever swing through Vegas! <EOR> I heard such rave reviews B B colleagues back when came CES   decided should give restaurant try since gambling Venetian   ten minute wait decided grab some drinks bar    bar some fantastic spicy breadsticks try if end going there   nice kick   We decided following dishes dinner I attached pictures Pork trotter top greens wasn't sure pork trotter didn't want find out   assuming feet but willing give try   really didn't dish   breaded outside seemed filled potatoes pork fat  Bleh   Don't this   Spaghettini Spicy Budding Chives Sweet Garlic One Pound Lobster $31 $31 expected lot more lobster plate   Where did one pound go?  spaghettini perfectly cooked al dente but  all say it     Homemade Orecchiette Sweet Sausage Rapini $23 dish ordered   Half table liked but found extremely salty average     Linguine Clams Pancetta Hot Chiles $26 Average   dish salty too   guess forgot pancetta would salty well    Grilled Pork Chop Cipolline Artichokes Vin Cotto $34 pork chop very good probably best dish ordered   I really wanted restaurant but didn't anything me   prices expensive portions small   taste off opinion well    much better choices dinner Vegas  <EOR> So disappointed $150 steak ordered! requested medium cooked came all bloody rare  barely even touched server didn't even check food was  good all  Most disappointing meal Vegas  <EOR> We excited try B B dinner actually waited almost half hour seated   A curious looking dude name Rich closely resembles Dexter Dexter's Lab emerged started schtik menu    we ordered margaritas rocks start waited come back orders    some 15 minutes later different guy walked decided orders   Dexter must watching over some chemical concoctions he's to    Then food arrived   Nothing fancy   would expect little more 4 dollar sign ratings price but disappointed   There's something flat taste   boyfriend's brasato super tender but wanting more savory robust flavor   linguine cooked perfect al dente   Both dishes toward saltier side saltiness spectrum   missing clams clam shells lol   arguable might buzzed strong margaritas I feel could use better service friendlier more attentive waitstaff  There's only attentive wait staff religiously poured water half emptied goblets   Kudos him   Also don't think there's need change utensils every 10 minutes restaurant claims certified Green   Emeril's Table 10 second level could easily outperform place flying colors  without changing utensils 4 times! <EOR> Craving Italian weeks visited Mario Batali's B B Restorante   friend eater weeks ago recommended give try   Per usual order tasting menu   pasta tasting menu B B two tastings   I'd hope detail each course Yelp member but visiting B B few course changed tasting included lot ingredients particular proteins hadn't eaten

desired   The casual but elegant dining service very much liking including Queen music playing B B's adjacent bar   service exceptional expected be   Unfortunately meal didn't  hit spot but fault restaurant   When thought Italian mistakenly thought homestyle thought rustic   However refined Italian B B Restorante delivers   I'd back  <EOR> I mixed thoughts experience last weekend  Mario's

which he said best he ever 18 dollars   He some experience grilled octopus spending time sailing around Aegean sea   chestnut pasta I'm vegetarian which good but very small   doubt if 15 pieces small stuffed pasta   companion Barramundi which filleted table which he stated very good   citrus fruit desert light delicious   Service attentive  <EOR> This food okay   definitely worth amount paid  started off bottle rosè peroni's famous octopus which kind tasted chicken  also some calamari which pretty good  friend shared goat cheese pasta butternut squash pasta can't remember exact names actually really good  Very unique rich flavor both  mom spaghetti which all impressive dad beef cheek ravioli he seemed enjoy enough I didn't try because don't eat beef   Besides all service

informant servers bartenders    The whole experience felt cuinary adventure    If sit bar sure ask Eric   And yourself favor step outside your comfort zone try something you've never let them pick your drinks let down  <EOR> Since experienced deliciousness Carnevino wanted try B B   Dimly lit romantic restaurant  Wonderful staff wonderful service  Even loved modern music played ambience  But food didn't hold candle Carnevino  We started few specialty cocktails which very good  noticed few similar items both restaurants share  wanted try some different dishes   Before meal presented Chickpea Bruschetta compliments chef   I'm big fan chickpeas but delicious   To start decided share Housemade Ricotta Olivestri Olio Nuovo Tuscan Kale accompanied nice crusty bread ricotta light oil kale flavorful complimented each other perfectly  We Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana Carnevino good decided again compare two  good but did seem more bacon  also Jose's Pyramids which sort ravioli stuffed short rib beef  pasta nice meat bit dry bland didn't care sauce felt missing something  when dipped sauce Bucatini al'Amatriciana much better need hire me  We quit decided some dessert shared nights specials which Apple Crostini Vanilla bean Gelato  gelato perfect apple crostini good but sauce served bit strong overpowered dish  presented complimentary dessert sampler multiple tiny bites liked Meringue Pistachio Chew  husband liked Chocolate cake    Not worth money Carnevino  <EOR> Pricier many New York restaurants but expected while Vegas   pasta dishes simply phenomenal Batali genius   6 ordered number appetizers pastas split amongst table   entrees aged rib eyes which while good amazing waiter described   would probably something else next time      Great way start night   XS Marquee dinner amazing night  <EOR> Beef cheek ravioli x2 spaghettini 1 lobster x2 Jose pyrimads grilled octopus x2 affettati dinner only ok price  Thankfully buddy credit big gambler bill much less rest us  <EOR> It difficult assign overall star rating because inconsistency food  Most dishes spectacular but quality issues thought below standards Batali Bastianich restaurant would have   The bread terrible  tasted frozen straight walk in  crust hard rubbery middle barely thawed  wasn't good first impression    The chic pea brushcetta passable  seasoned well tasted fine but amuse bouche boring   The octopus appetizer where things started look up  incredible  intense colors sauce plate made octopus stand out  grilled perfect crisp without hint rubbery ness  best octopus dish ever tasted   My gf goat cheese tortellini did disappoint  pasta silky combination citrus fennel contrasted rich goat cheese perfectly  divine    I short ribs served creamy polenta freshly grated horseradish  flavors all but short rib dry which odd considering braised barolo    I wanted give B B 3 5 stars rounded up  <EOR> We excited try restaurant birthday dinner while visiting Vegas   favorite things world

relatively inexpensive make   just charging inconvenience having something off prixe fix?  When pasta came disappointed see large amount whole parsley leaves   Parsley never ingredient dish completely overpowered delicate flavor guanciale   everything built be    The short ribs also disappointing enough sauce served over very boring polenta   could taste horseradish all     Our friends pasta tasting some exceptional pastas beautifully prepared tasted delicious   octopus appetizer quite lovely well   They very kindly brought panna cotta Happy Birthday Message but unfotunately panna cotta absolutely awful   sweet all consistency hardened paste     The food overall well cooked almost everything tasted good service very fine but price considering owns restaurant expecting perfection  <EOR> Such inedible expensive disappointment  husband ordered each tasting menu share pasta traditional    My husband wanted wine dinner but wine pairing waitress sent over sommelier  He asked he could help then just stood silently staring us  awkward silence husband explained he having tasting menu wanted three glasses wine total glass every two dishes  guy kind shrugged shoulders asked husband likes answer which both find infuriating  back forth awhile getting nowhere finally sent away  husband ended asking waitress select wine which she did did good job   In fact service pretty good other sommelier  Server very nice bussers friendly carefully asked everything each dish  However odd thing where ostentatiously cover spills your table napkin accompanied lot hand flourishes  happened twice  only draws attention your table found really unnecessary but whatever  Otherwise good service   The music while good way loud  could hear each other all night just ended making gross out faces each other across table which communicated disappointment meal   We served piece dry bread each no dips spreads anything else all it   As dinner First course Pasta Tagliatelle  Bland  needed more spices flavor though fresh herbs nice  mushrooms really good  great but promising  Traditional Veal  liked most part though overly salted   Second Course Pasta Tortelloni  pretty good though oddly sour overall goat cheese citrus combo  point thinking really impressive but maybe ramping hit really good stuff  Traditional Tortellini Brodo  worst dish night  never served such weird inedible pasta such sour mushy sauce  tasted ground canned artichokes  bad bizarre actually thought must actually amazing most beloved dish planet little Italian grandmothers Piedmonte just ignorant understand it   Third Course Pasta Pyramids Tortellini aside where things started going noticeably undeniably downhill  pasta gummy beef cheek center gritty pasty marinara sauce tasted just Chef Boyardee  some reason still holding hope  famous Mario Batali right?  Fourth Course Pasta Beef Cheek Ravioli  Presented proud declaration dish made Mario famous  think finally! dig in  Holy SALTY! believe second dish made anyone famous anywhere ever  clearly butchering man's food kitchen   Fifth Course Pasta Foie Gras Ravioli  actually kind liked ravioli but balsamic sauce overwhelming ruined it  Traditional salt level dish made beef cheek ravioli look bland baby food comparison  Utterly inedible dry bone greasy  husband said trying salt cure clients inside salami   Sixth Course Pasta Sfoglia  best thing ate  Quite tasty  Traditional Semifreddo  Boring  Odd texture   Seventh Course Pasta Budino  Good but let's honest its just your average lava cake  Traditional Panetone  dry piece crumbly bread honey top  bad almost turned night around since point just started laughing   I really understand high ratings place gets  worst meal ever Vegas most expensive  another reviewer said just can't even look Mario Batali's face now without feeling bitter disappointed  <EOR> To little dark but love place very much but every time leave leave tummy stuffed actually kind cashed night   hate feeling but food good kind no self control usually always start rabbit confiiet appetizer then usually beef cheek ravioli duck liver then let Chef Doug surprise dessert    Perfecto! <EOR> Very good Italian restaurant   appetizer took burata bread   same savor Italy !!  took bolognese papardelle 1st plate Haaahouuu good !!
