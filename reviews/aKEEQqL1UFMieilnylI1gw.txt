Great job Brandy!!!   As Las Vegas native know restaurants Strip until tonight them used Bartolotta   The food good great but downfall service! beginning meal waiters attentive but once entrees served seems table 10 did exist   For example asked glass Pinot noir 10 minutes before entree arrived glass came finishing meal btw pour less half others   let's talk water! No table water refilled until flagged down maitre d then finally directed water refill  um Denny's does better job then team Lastly table wanted gamble and or watch fireworks again took flagging down someone else see could check  Once asked check took 15 more minutes finally it   All all if want great meal great service avoid Bartolotta SW steakhouse   One last thing party 10 tip already included kinda slimy if ask me <EOR> Let's see where start   Relatively awful service split across two waiters very attentive while he assigned first 10 15 minutes 3 hours there  follow waiter rude short when he sporadically paying attention   group 7 adults yet seemed treated group teenagers Denny's wanting free refills coffee while loitering few hours school  20 minutes no refilling glasses champagne purchased asked hostess grab bottle us   She takes ice bucket puts table walks away   think all part picture poor service there     So we're off bad start ultimately those qualities service could potentially factored into star rating if food made it   food mediocre bad most cases exception being artichoke salad which tasty may only worth pointing because rest meals bad   Vegetable Risotto easily worst Risotto ever completely underdone hull rice somewhat crunchy    also absolutely no seasoning whatsoever   ate couple bites decided ask salt pepper something shouldn't need restaurant stature should season food properly seasoned myself    took few more bites decided wasn't even worth digestion   chose say anything send back since birthday party didn't want bring attention it   waiter cleared plate which mostly untouched didn't say word again lack attention care   girlfriend Gnocchi tomato cream sauce nothing special couldn't whip myself home without much effort   We eventually main course where majority decided Branzino   First all cost fish weight astronomically expensive but guess might due fact all fish flown Mediterranean daily  Don't even started environmental sustainability issues arise that   option accommodating sauces could choose fish   guess assumed wrong fish might cooked sauce case   staff bring over cooked fish dissect plate table side they did rush job because found several bones pieces served roasted overdone fingerling potatoes sauteed mushy zucchini slices   fish unseasoned expected dollop accompanying average sauces ontop it   potatoes zucchini nothing worth remembering neither fish   The other slight upside meal desert gelato sorbetto great however no idea if responsible them if shipped them Italy everyday  Gelato hard its good sign didn't miss mark otherwise would zero star review    Ultimately many other more amazing restaurants Vegas probably even better Italian restaurants your hometown should visit first before Bartolotta   huge disappointment  <EOR> Delicious  Best Italian seafood Vegas  service amazing even bread ricotta delicious  Dessert heavenly  husband returned next day bar menu drinks  ordered frituras which mixture calamari sardines fried die for  If enjoy seafood visits amazing rest definitely comeback  <EOR> Had nice birthday dinner wife  beautiful restaurant  pastas perfection sampled few each unique amazing  dessert really great  only issue server caught large group sort forgotten near end meal he didn't bring coffee ordered desert clearly distracted  Other small issue really nice dinner absolutely recommend  <EOR> We reserved cabana birthday dinner very romantic evening  Would love back!

If able opt private cabana dinning  all difference! Great service hospitality  <EOR> Full disclosure upfront did pay cent meal people invited mega guests casino host   being said believe bill approx $170 pp    Atmosphere = 5 stars big time! When heard sitting outside along lagoon fainted b c temps 109 day cooling nice 98 evening  asked table? wondered   But see disclosure above job shut grateful!  Much delight actually AIR CONDITION OUTSIDE making wonderful peaceful cozy dining experience each table having its own canopied cabana  Sorry energy saver geeks    just other reason appalled Vegas  Food Wine = 4 stars  Beautiful simple presentations high quality simple fresh ingredients portions moderate   Considering $$$ menu wines surprisingly value priced   If know your Italian wines hard wrong if dry mineral y whites anyway then you'll happy porcca merda   Menu = 1 star extreme over complication  So price fish gram most around $15 100 grams   Good thing There's App b c figure out?! BTW 1 oz = 28 35 gr want 170g fish standard 6oz serving  Ok we're messed don't use metric system but seriously  just unnecessary   Plus then suggestions many ounces suggested per person    thereby going schizo standards measurement   even stupider you're bound pay whatever size whole fish b c buy whole thing kitchen available just enough decide want 650g san pietro b c then server check w kitchen see if something even stock   WTF?  After 20 mins straining over menu and all sober mind you agreed just close waiter order us   Everything delicious but I'd think twice before coming back b c kooky menu hassle  <EOR> Came 2 months ago but yelper then    Wow! bust  very high expectations place    Started appetizer recommended Bobby Flay  really good  All shellfish lived expectations along great flavor   Then ordered called best shrimp world  even close being best shrimp  30 bucks per shrimp  Even if 3 bucks still tell weak    Then ordered fish called branzino cart fresh seafood roll your table  charged 120 bucks fish did taste fresh fish  Maybe refresh   rip off!   Some restaurants good making feel satisfied rip off  place did come close  <EOR> meh  That's all say   First off place loud hell since open tables all pretty close together   For starters cart refrigerated fish display thing over tell available  dunno but wasn't interesting because wondering going happen those poor fish display  Did die no reason just thrown away unfit cooking??? Poor fishies  = So three people waiter suggested some sort sampler thing  ok sounds good  Then somehow ended bottled water some bottle crazy red wine  course there's no prices menu but since wasn't paying told worry price     bottoms up!!!!!!  Each entrees pretty sparse honestly don't even remember anything good them  only thing recall thinking holy crap if paying then I'd pissed because stuff pretty bland  Plus starving when bring small amount food time really doesn't hit spot  more teaser scared each thing last  sure enough last thing came still hungry  Even dessert meh some sort ice cream things some bland chocolate cake thing   They lot waitstaff but almost impersonal since none them really know ordered going specifically your table  Almost kind high end clusterfuck  somewhat slow service when barely 2 3 done party next table done gone and seated were!! So ended knocking off two bottles wine well bill came around 700 bucks  OMFG pretty horrible since neither impressed drunk nor full   Sadly if spending 700 trying impress someone would epic fail  Good thing wasn't case!  So yeah if trying show off someone maybe somewhere else would better idea  In n Out would probably better job could even buy your date 5 In n Out tshirts all kind goodies save 400 dollars  =D <EOR> Bugs!  Terrible service wrong order food sub par   review limited outdoor eating area   Perhaps wait staff indoor more amicable but waiter outside absolutely terrible rude   He never checked entire time    Instead he spent majority time talking couple next table   Great way feel special!  The absolute worst response wife when asked change table linen place setting because covered bugs   He said you're sitting outside expect?! He didn't change clean thing   wipe utensils down     The food orders wrong  ordered vegan ravioli   received regular ravioli stuffed cheese   risotto wasn't any good   Took two bites ate bread asked check     This restaurant just sad   Friday night looked empty nursing home    I usually stay Encore when Vegas   Typically grab dinner show within hotel but experience bad staying again  <EOR> Super delicious food very full flavor  read another review wine super expensive right  able bottle $100 really delicious but definitely least expensive bottles   would say only disappointment desserts  lemon cake dish similar tiramisu didn't eat much either  ravioli unbelievable!  order second order good!
