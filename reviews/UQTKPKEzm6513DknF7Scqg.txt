Couldn't plastic fork eat with?  Ridiculous   Also place needs serious cleaning  <EOR> Edit Normally bad first experience would just return case would just ask refund Groupon which super easy but really BBQ places very close convenient home decided give second chance   The BBQ very good maybe best Las Vegas  If just rating food would probably 5 stars but consider whole experience   Back Groupon part dissatisfaction http www groupon com las vegas deals big pauls bbq  Your supposed $70 worth food discount cost marketing acquiring new customer  exactly kind customer places want attract  spend lot money food every month often try new restaurants using discount then return guest without discount   They absolutely give say your going get   The two slabs ribs really 1 5 most chop them before put them your to go box hide fact shorted you   The large sides supposed 16 ounces according website   actually 12 ounces yes measured them because already leery place   mean come Seriously much does 4 ounces baked beans cost  Give portion say going get   The other crappy thing offer nice sides candied yams Black Eye Peas Corn but when try redeem family pack only offer few basic sides entire sides menu which all priced exactly same $3 99 16 oz You $40 worth food food actually very good bad try short change discount  only $17 Groupon Typical restaurants run 35% food cost $40 worth food not $70 its supposed be would cost them $14  don't think realized until made promotions  maybe just offers trying survive cause Groupon sends them check right away   really don't know Only Big Paul knows but summary definitely don't amount food your supposed when using discount   The place also needs thorough cleaning organization cashier where computer setup major mess    I really mixed feelings posting because I'd actually return Big Pauls BBQ good but deceptive business practices really bother publicly posting bothers might read review recognize ??  If cleaned place little less deceptive offerings would absolute Gem BBQ joint Las Vegas   Big Paul If your reading wish  best success but need clean joint more few ways if want succeed longterm    Original review Below place joke    If using groupon offered few weeks ago treat differently if Paying customer   I called redeeem Family Meal Package but told sold them day  asked if could substitute some other items since wasn't fault ran food  quick rude 1 word answer= NO  asked if could subsitute some other items Beef Ribs pay difference price =NO   I asked speak Paul the owner   He matter factly told already redeemed 65 packages seems BS day sold promotion day come back Tuesday  said wanted BBQ today Tuesday  He said If don't just call Groupon ask refund ??? little further complaining being counter intuitive good business whold idea behind using groupon attract new customers chase them away he gave song dance he just small mom pop place can't afford give food away every day  why limits place yada yada yada   Needless say rather irritated   decided call back 5 minutes later using different phone no coupon  Miraculously now items previously sold out  Talk shady unethical  He didn't problem cashing check Groupon sent but seems he doesn't want pay back timely manner  This guy might no BBQ didn't actually try it but he doesn't know caca run business   Caveat Emptor Buyer Beware Jason <EOR> Used Yelp App phone while driving around area  Found place suddenly urge bbq  only 10% off announcement deal app!
