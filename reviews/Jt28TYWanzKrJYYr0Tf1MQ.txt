The 2 for 1 margarita special total rip off just doubled prices 10oz plastic cups margaritas   But wasn't worst it   happened notice charged $1 00 more each entrees price listed menus   When talked manager he said wasn't mistake   He said prices changed but didn't new menus printed yet   Apparently he saw absolutely no problem charging all patrons more thought they'd pay   When mentioned clearly unethical he just said he'll giving $25 off next meal   other words shut worth your while  told didn't want coupon he should just right thing lower prices reflect what's menu tell patrons increase when order   don't think he listened me   Just think thousands people paid more menu price   hear Class Action Lawsuit ? <EOR> I'll keep simple   If Vegas better off drinking your room coming CWC    + margaritas pretty good + chips stale salsa tasty + service SUCKS slow rude   We came Cabo Wabo Cantina because 2 1 margarita coupon  Thank goodness didn't eat because food did look very good would probably settle well stomachs  top off service HORRIBLE! waiter rude seemed pissed off there  He did even bother ask type margarita wanted  Instead he just flavor most convenient him    I'm happy now know ever come back again! <EOR> Great patio people watching strip  Love sampler platter lobster enchiladas  service usually pretty good but summer sure under umbrella  <EOR> I give place five stars delicious jalapeño margaritas awesome fajitas chicken beef shrimp off hook        service excellent loved beautiful view also strip     <EOR> The hubby stopped during quick but epic 4 day Vegas run  Despite being open air setup outdoor area perplexingly stifling  Tables crammed together uncomfortably very little air movement  tabletop sticky which attribute tacky finish rather uncleanliness    but could wrong  More importantly though anyone Vegas budget and exist should step foot place  Overpriced but average bar food drinks thing! margaritas $15 pop but overly large strong    or good  price drink should give back rub least kiss!  In short SKIP IT  <EOR> We recently stayed Planet Hollywood found ourselves group Cabo Wabo   people sucked manager Lou bartenders John Nikki AMAZING   John made best bloody marys ever them super spicy showed great time   back next 2 days Lou treat wonderfully   service fantastic drinks great food did eat enjoyable   Having such great experience definitely added already wonderful trip!! <EOR> My husband dinner rail last night Awesome  Laura server she made date night experience Cabo  back!

Definite stop if your ever Las Vegas strip  <EOR> First came years ago when first opened support dueling piano friends did gig here  Last nights visit result Groupon purchased November 2014 Xmas Eve expiry   Cabo Wabo may hit elsewhere but Vegas I'd say its epic fail  Located Planet Hollywood place H U GE!   Multi level huge outside seating area great views Bellagio Fountains  restaurant itself occupies ground floor  stage lots tables limited room walk around  lift stairs take levels above  don't know  suspect club and or private rooms  exactly sure  am sure if people constantly move down stairs causing quite fuss    The music loud  Really loud restaurant  yelling each other heard other diners staff  restaurant outdoor bar weren't busy sure why server Victoria took forever greet take drink order  She very nice though   Lots servers seen but none found  Food coming kitchen ridiculously slow    I BBQ bacon cheeseburger friend Cilantro jalapeño chicken breast  served onion rings  Sadly upon biting into she immediately pulled chicken bone within ring  Fortunately temp crown root canal wasn't damaged  still can't figure happened    I order burger med well  Since took forever food come hopeful burger properly cooked bSadly arrived cooked LESS medium  gross  fries tasted fish  took good 15 20 minutes server  Why don't know  Numerous servers walked table never stopped ask if problem  obvious was   both plates pushed away untouched    Eventually Victoria arrived along manager  He quite gracious  Free margaritas redo food  Fortunately both arrived properly done    Dare mention other diners standing tables dancing?  Security guards putting own dance act sitting down hanging friends trying pick girls    This place joke  Ok food worth wait pricing  Irritatingly loud music  TONS empty tables inside out  Bathrooms disgusting water used towels everywhere  Servers galore but no use    Not sort place  expect see experience when dinner  No wonder ran Groupon  place awful   If you're local better places off strip go  If you're young classless dumb tourist wanting nothing but show your ass spit drunk   then place great you   FAMILIES STRONGLY DISCOURAGED  <EOR> Always great time here!!!

All all great dining experience great families kids   returning next time need quick meal near Bellagio  <EOR> We ended Cabo Wabo because around midnight Sunday night several other places tried closed long waits   Cabo Wabo did should sent red flag immediately   pretty terrible karaoke band playing far loud small place   waitress took awhile take order when asked good recommended met blank stare   She did want there   ordered couple margaritas OK but far expensive   When food finally came little cold just so so   nacho plate thing forgot called 12 chips barely any fajita meat it   Once finished eating waited good 30 minutes check all while ear drums bleeding awful music   wife ended going back hotel because check took forever   Overall pretty bad food bad environment overpriced OK drinks   lot better strip   Heck better truck stop middle Iowa  <EOR> Up until now mostly disappointed 'celebrity' bars restaurants   Most big name hype low flavor   Cabo Waco Cantona changed me   drinks area bit pricey however did deliver flavor size   Queso Fundida cheesy good portion appetizer   jalapeño line chicken large enough two spices inedible   Plenty Sammy memorabilia great waitstaff sure bet Vegas strip sorry couldn't avoid pun! <EOR> Food great! Only reason give them four stars because messed friends order but overall food delicious <EOR> The food terrible eat restaurant  When sever asked food tell good all  She looked nodded if say know  drinks  all  <EOR> Went lunch because going conference next door Paris  guess since group ten server knew he'd getting automatic gratuity he figured he didn't need put forth much effort  took 10 minutes drink order then another 10 take food order   about 30 food you see where am going this? All waitstaff seemed want eye contact patrons fear may asked anything  server only checked once 15 minutes food come which unacceptable especially because weren't busy  took another 20 minutes check  food terrible  beef tacos beef tasted dog food smells if sense  overall horrible lunch horrible service horrible food  Plus overpriced  Avoid place! <EOR> Greasy chips Weird sour ceviche No ability blended drink other pre made mixed stuff keep slushie machine  Overstretched waiters can't seem back your table drink ordered 30 minutes ago  Nobody party 5 especially happy meal   BUT did nice outdoor patio looking strip Bellagio fountains  view worth 2 stars  <EOR> Over priced medicore pre prepared food  Inattentive disorganized staff  Lame  <EOR> Wish read reviews first before dining here     We stopped quick lunch drink  Service wasn't bad though waiters all awkwardly sitting table near entrance just talking waiting around  around 11am when stopped super busy but weird them just all sitting table   The food bit expensive was  ended getting carne asada tacos  anything amazing memorable  Roberto's Tacos off strip much better choice  margarita strong but also amazing taste  bill tacos salad 2 margaritas 2 bloody marys $100    I'd pass place during future visits try something else  <EOR> Please don't waste your time money place!! wait 10 minutes then when seated seen plenty tables available just didn't want sit us! Then waiting ten minutes single order drinks gave flat pop  walked out!! worth price all pease don't waste your money!! some where else!! <EOR> Definitely worth price  expecting better I don't know why but left disappointed  Didn't know getting souvenir glass double drinks certainly would declined  Now throw them away figure pack them won't break luggage  heads server would nice  Overall just okay  <EOR> sitting patio vegas strip margarita some nachos   little bit heaven!

She did offer bring manager over explain fee but didn't feel waiting    It's 3 star place minus 1 hidden fees  <EOR> Really BAD service bad attitude   Lots places eat Strip sorry wasted any time one  <EOR> This place awful     Lucky owner Las Vegas Blvd looks happening good    because otherwise would no customers  food overpriced good all service even worse rude!!!!!!!    unfortunately ate twice experience only worse first time  Would never come again! Save your money eat Taco Bell instead! <EOR> First off let start saying come expecting gourmet Mexican food place it try Lindo Michoacan off strip if looking find that   said eaten many Mexican restaurants Cabo Wabo still among top 3 restaurants  husband come once month order nacho platter something similar  always consistent amazing  Great quick bite eat   The servers bar completely different story  all times never seen server hostess bartender more once  Obviously through new staff very regular basis reason  normally wait your food those brought food runners but water napkins any kind condiments GOOD LUCK! normally just head bar them myself   Now onto frozen drinks  servers tell completely outright frozen drinks premade strong all don't surprised when indeed true  try upsell them while appreciate Cabo Wabo should doing something rectify this  If your own waiters even try sway customers purchasing them you're going good profit these  alcohol! Fat Tuesday's just few steps away lower price best frozen drink strip offer   All all place  Great food but staff lot work on  Lots room improvement here! Cabo! <EOR> Sammy Hagar rocks  bartenders Ashley Darien suggestions  Never thought would seafood middle desert but amazing  drinks  variety uniqueness margaritas impressive  <EOR> I'll give place star music would never eat drink again ever  2 1 margaritas which ended being $11 00 each even 2 fer!! Yeah server said regularly 22 bucks each  came small plastic cups nice touch weren't bad but food horrible  ordered tons starters everything bla dry even nachos back!  safe route street style tacos tell any Taco Truck California 100 times better dry bland chopped fajita meat thrown some greasy corn tortillas then topped raw chopped onions some cilantro ate half gave rest all back  Ew  Actually friends said she probably wouldn't eat Mexican food while  bad was   Oh cute bar girl poured tequila all over face  neck when Mas Tequila shot bar  Seriously   <EOR> This place really nice  only thing  disappointment price pay beers food  would say slightly over priced   I fish ceviche which really good  mango traditional ceviche but super tasty nonetheless    I karaoke which super good  doesn't last long early but DJ very nice sound system phenomenal!   Definitely going back place  <EOR> The 2 hostess' very unorganized couldn't keep track people line when bring more people back  watched 2 other couples front came us  When asked didn't remember even waiting  weren't writing down names keep track either  Once finally sat took 15 minutes waitress even acknowledge us  ready order drinks food time she there  fish steak tacos ok nothing special  Steak tacos spicy fish tacos just bland  never Mexican restaurant don't tortilla chips brought your table pay extra them  wouldn't recommend anyone wasting time going here  <EOR> We last Sunday 4 21 13 servers rude  wanted sit outside took name ask much longer see why taking long  sat 6 other people behind finally table made such fuss left hell all wanted eat  no stars if could  2 coors light chips salsa 37 00 dollars  Rediculous  explain manager waitress 7 times  <EOR> So place ok Maybe its better night I personally prefer diablos but even last time bartender douch! staff actually great waitress outside still smile face when wanted move inside bartender inside super nice cute!

After all said done glad Groupon   though wished hadn't even spent time eating there  Avoid! <EOR> Plus Chips salsa warm plentiful nice heat salsa  Jarritos soda refreshing afternoon drinking sun  waitress also lovely attentive  Hubby's salad ok    Minus BLAND flavourless food  rice seemed sitting under lamp very dried beans basically kindergarten paste  worth money  <EOR> I did expect place all   I figured chain similar TGIF food quality  started impressed drink mango pineapple mojito  Ummm   yum! Mango puree muddled mint weak strong  coconut margaritas also hit  albondigas soup outstanding  Everyone else loved food mix salads seafood tacos  server worked hard keep 7 indecisive women happy  OK line dance broke mid meal   kinda corny but consummate Vegas  music bit loud especially those Sammy songs making tad hard talk but Vegas   who needs talk? <EOR> We liked it  Service fast  crazy spicy  Chips fresh salsa tasty  margaritas bite quick  please strip seating people watch live singer  <EOR> We dinner even though more bar vibe  Hey Vegas  ordered tortilla soup nachos  excited when bowls arrived tortilla shards avocados other add ins center empty bowl  soup pitcher which server poured around add ins   thought fun unique way serve it  soup itself very thick brown which wasn't all expected but kept open mind  wasn't good  sister doctored sour cream able eat 1 2 it  probably ten spoonfuls couldn't eat any more  Ick  The meat beef nachos weird flavor very strong  Neither liked it  cheese runny queso esque  concoction  serving generous but barely made dent them because tasty   highlight visit adorable friendly attentive waitress Sarah Ma   She fantastic  If want drunk then eat most likely won't care food isn't good  If want party drink then place would great  <EOR> Everything tasted good!

If service would've better maybe could've justified food price but hard say    sure would try again  <EOR> Boy miss Trader Vic's   back location because outdoor seating pretty great thinking bad could Cabo Wabo be?  almost give 2 stars because cadillac nachos ordered tasty almost worth price rare vegas nowadays    However margaritas absolute crap   house husband house specialty evening which claimed made reposado tequila blue curacao grand marnier   Mine teeny bit more drinkable but basically cheap sour mix 14oz  plastic cup filled 12oz  mark didn't appear lick tequila it   C'mon people ordered actually enjoy limey tequila flavor gut rot lime sour drink   yes did say slightly more drinkable husbands cuz he finish mine   top off those crappy 12oz margs cost $15 each   Un freakin believable  <EOR> Over $80 tiny table two next door leading outdoor seating next pillar  avoid having constant traffic brushing passed turned face pillar  chicken tostada salad good  say that  bf burrito looked very pathetic  Came handful scorched tortilla chips  both tried Can't Drive 55   sickeningly sweet didn't even finish them  both regret didn't power through hunger until reached south end Las Vegas Blvd  where better dining choices  Very disappointing  <EOR> Walked bar nice drink GREAT guacamole   Bartender gave great service   overall check out! <EOR> Food good  grilled chicken tacos  ate outside watched fountains    pico great pass salsa  coconut margarita good but 26!$  husband's drink 28$!

Didn't take much time seated  decided sit outdoor patio because view good particular day bright sunny! music really annoying  loud  Apparently wasn't deliberate  Something wrong music system volume going down  Better rather shut off!

No but nothing remarkable  sure  service? Horrible    Let's start beginning  party four crammed tiny table tons foot traffic  Some girl came over take order    sure she she made point tell she server but going taking order  Clearly she wasn't happy being told help actual server she rude surly uninterested completely unhelpful    When ordering said short rib enchiladas? blank stare she replied they're good such way began question order said hearing any enthusiasm    should order something else? She robotically replied sigh said she's never them but popular there  Um ok    Then friend vegetarian told people front almost everything menu could modified into vegetarian dish  I mean really difficult  Take any freaking dish omit meat voila! Rude girl taking order told that?!! rolled eyes put hands defiantly hips  Then she added The ONLY vegetarian options cheese quesadilla salad! being told said front friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas avocado told Oh guess could that  When food came no cheese enchiladas    but instead cheese quesadilla   SIGH    food runner just rude  friend made comment wasn't she ordered but she'd eat anyway  runner insisted getting enchiladas she barked BECAUSE WANT HAPPY! Lol   And during long period time waiting food flagged down server asked some chips salsa  if place didn't suck already told CHARGE chips salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never ever life Mexican restaurant and LOT time charged chips salsa  mean know price gouging capital world Las Vegas where dumb tourists fork any kind money knowing any better but cold day hell before pay $5 bucks chips salsa  week later still shaking head write this   Other never saw server again    never checked refilled water nothing  food unremarkable  Average best  mango picante margarita pretty decent    took forever arrive but tasted good  85% thru meal when someone over shoulder tried take plate away wtf   then remainder meal staff member table stalking fill table second stood which uncomfortable felt rushed even though service end slow     Summary Disappointed  <EOR> While some people would consider Cabo Wabo noisy thought added ambiance gave place electrifying atmosphere   food choices plentiful but food itself generally unimpressive   Mexican restaurant black beans refried beans nor ground beef inexcusable   server Adam F  excellent helpful   Overall nice experience but food wise  <EOR> My original review flagged removed moral police @ Yelp because honest  apparently included personal attacks naming names God awful restaurant  still however want put 2 cents it    We $60 groupon apparently only able used party 4 more  written tiny print online only nowhere printed groupon  manager duty ass  He immediately said he going office order print something prove wrong  He VERY condescending attacking just all around awful person  GM much better cam down finally agreed take $30 off paid groupon  waitress great and  Feel bad she work nimrods  She no clue per party requirement which again speaks lack of skill brilliant managers    I threw fit Groupon money back  chick phone did sound surprised  Also other tables having similar issues Groupons    Regardless never ever back  <EOR> Great atmosphere but food drinks just ok  carne asada tacos sangarita can't drive 55  patio perfect people watching <EOR> Place super expensive  $20 plate least bring some chips without charging extra    It's loud big  If can't patio seat consider just pushing on    However tortilla soup amazing  service excellent    Fish tacos great presentation texture but low flavor  Nachos standard    I rated 3 considering price  <EOR> I came Cabo Wabo use Groupon $30 worth food $15 because frankly intrigued schizophrenic Yelp reviews place  early lunch around 11 30 am Wednesday sat outside watch people walk Strip   I pretty good experience Cabo Wabo  Cactus Pear Margarita surprisingly tasty always big fan margs  guacamole not great some saying but pretty decent jalapeno cilantro chicken  Nothing spectacular but nothing terrible either   To big downer Cabo Wabo price  But come right Las Vegas Strip expect? drink guac entree came $34 used Groupon then some  Between price Groupon amount paid tax tip whole experience ran around $26  Without Groupon would $41 which seems awfully high person  However Cabo Wabo does happy hour 4 7 pm half price drinks appetizers  I'd imagine would worth your time if seat  <EOR> Went friend SERVICE ANIMAL asked service animal papers hostess   telling don't law doesn't require she became very rude it    Needless say left  Perhaps staff should trained when customer walks dog least use common sense  <EOR> Horrible food service outdoor patio!

Took 10 minutes waiters attention just try some hot sauce! never return Las Vegas again! HORRIBLE! <EOR> I ordered taco salad surprised huge portion was  typical taco salad tossed shredded nachos Chedder cheese guacamole  nothing extraordinary  But if you're looking quick non fast food inexpensive place eat Strip would good place stop by  <EOR> Mark Christy best bartenders ever  way fun made day @ Cani wabo ! Thank ! <EOR> No   Obviously don't very high expectations when going place this   basically glorified bar   location Las Vegas Strip   and basically mimic another reviewer said service sloooow food GROSS    I ordered 'chicken fajita burrito'   which came he table 'BEEF fajita burrito'   35 minutes ordered  AND CHILI all over it    beef chili   slopped over top   along fake canned cheese   which guess would fine if ordered   extremely drunk   incorrect   looked unappealing   but hey gave chance  Sufficed say won't going back particular menu item  I did mention server incorrect    he claimed sent wrong said would deal it   but bill listed BEEF Fajita Burrito  as in   he ordered wrong item lied it  Mistakes happen   it    just sayin   The 2 friends both decided pretty bad service missing utensils drinks 3 coming time   really seemed no excuse lack service because all busy    all agreed drinks weren't bad   outdoor patio nice attraction ''people watch'    but other that   eating any signature dishes again   ever  chicken tenders fries menu if ever visit spot again drinks   decide am hungry and very lazy because 10 better choices less 50 feet away having those    I don't recommend food all  drinks good Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka ?

Anyway    that   good luck your dining adventures! <EOR> Despite name bit expensive mediocre but well located busy section Strip   Come sit outside large deck otherwise worth seeking out   Despite proudly featured margarita ads house tequila being top shelf Cabo Wabo no drink list minimally described only 3 tequila based drinks which available frozen mentioned first    seemed much more interested selling beer   Tortilla soup decently spiced but little salty little thick   Service attentive fault checking every 5ish minutes    The location however quite awesome  major crosswalk across street new Aria view booming fountains Bellagio   Good taking strip while having drink if sit outside   some gas heaters deck winter but sort doesn't seem give off much heat   Doesn't seem there'd view inside   I've original Cabo Wabo Cantina Los Cabos which better pricing drink specials much much more atmosphere if much less view  <EOR> I impress food Cabo Wabo Cantina Las Vegas   friend because super hungry craving Mexican food   The portions small very very pricy   We spend over $60 2 plates   Our waiter nice but still wasn't worth it  same meal $20 some where else  <EOR> My group ten all found all drinks seemed absent alcohol   caused several watch bartenders pour ultimately waste good money   overhead heaters close proximity patrons concern virtually cooking all     Overall service subpar   waiter treated if he bothered providing service stated matter fact tip no less 18%  <EOR> The food excellent waiters  Patio usually crowded but also eat inside  patio fun though because much fun going outside  <EOR> The ghost Sammy Hagar ever present  Oh wait he still alive  She maybe just essence if Sammy  Eau d'Sammy <EOR> My husband decided play tourist Memorial Day weekend   started Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops   While walking thru shops decided share yard margarita  If wanted play tourists look part!

Hey mad them just wondering if some kind dress code? friendly definitely very laid back vibe  think bikini some small cover didnt feel place  moments when felt service could little quicker but am very fast paced like casual dining 30 minutes less forgive them little that   What warrants 4* rating?   The FOOD!!  I would describe upscale maybe more fine dining ish    nothing heavy handed greasy overly cheesy most mexican restaurants   it presented nicely tasted delish husband did feel overly full I hate that    ordered ceviche combo cheese enchilada think beef taco rice beans    I really did expect caliber mexican food when walked into place give them props    Also location really great right off strip next alot shopping Sephora right next door Anyway seems alot mixed reviews place but husband truly enjoyed food maybe depends order  <EOR> I always come because love taquila but time im done  burrito just fell apart bland oily  Salad mostly lettuce couple sliced tomatoe pieces couple chopped avacado pieces  2 fries 1 salad 1 burrito 1 chicken tenders 2 margaritas spent 92 bucks  grandmother ate nothing wife ate nothing kids just fries  Terrible experience  Margarita very sweat made feel sick  Glass dirty well  sure wrong werent all busy  <EOR> After strolling through streets Vegas common sight people drinking adult slushies  first thought virgin until continued see empty beer wine bottles everywhere   finally ask someone drink streets yes  amazed then all made sense   Seeing all started crave margarita badly   passing Cabo Wabo few times thought would appropriate place quench thirst   slight wait into cantina but outdoor elevated patio worth wait   Upon being seated server told menus just asked margarita mojito   started some chips salsa   salsa really smokey background but much flavour   Shortly drinks came taking sip both realized very water downed drinks   both very unsatisfied drinks mine literally tasted just lime slushie no alcohol   basically just wrote off night poor restaurant pick but then bill came   drink $10 sisters $14 never felt ripped off   think why Cabo currently low Yelp rating because people feeling ripped off   Overall would come back because believe tourist trap   banking time diner versus returning diner  <EOR> So came low expectations place normally would since style rarely strip  However Chris told some specials love hanging group Yelpies came along    The staff awesome place!

Although Cabo Wabo isn't mainstream type chain restaurant still pretty much chain food really reflected that   kept expectations minimum CARNITAS TACOS pretty mediocre   and overpriced   Two tacos Spanish rice beans $15?  know Strip all but damn http www yelp com biz_photos cabo wabo cantina las vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg    taste carnitas driven heavily generic sauce rather savory seasoned flavors you'd something authentic but least tacos fairly full   so yay?  As far drinks friends seemed mostly satisfied had   ordered CHUPA CHUPA cocktail which kind fun drink but particularly amazing   Essentially flip mini Corona into regular margarita your table quickly drink before all overflows http www yelp com biz_photos cabo wabo cantina las vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ    Creative unique but pricey considering wasn't heavy alcohol    Amazingly though hurt more overpaying generic medicore food lack reception stopping checking Yelp when first sat down   petty trivial sounds would seen Free margarita purchase entrée deal before ordered could saved myself $12 Chupa Chupa!  Ugh    <EOR> I Cabo Wabo every time come Vegas  margaritas strong some best had  always order Cocorita but am often tempted other enticing drinks large menu    They serve free chips salsa which unfortunate Mexican restaurant but nachos don't mind  nacho platter carne asada go to perfect meal two people alongside some ice cold margaritas    I always come Vegas during most crowded times year never wait sit inside  usually wait outside seating which overlooks strip  <EOR> Although margaritas tasty pretty expensive!! honestly hard time finishing grilled fish tacos just weren't  great dad lobster enchilada ok also tasted Cadillac nachos all all nothing special  Good location mediocre food over priced drinks  Nothing surprising here <EOR> Love love love  love LOVE Cabo Wabo  special trip every year Tahoe location birthday  Vegas location once before wasn't overly excited  But last trip once again made fall love all over again! eat nachos ONCE YEAR Cabo Wabo only choice  server suggested shrimp nachos  Freaking amazing  Great margaritas too  Good Service  Really nice patio great people watching  Can't wait back  Counting down  Oh strangely enough boyfriend tried burger I know right burger  at Mexican restaurant? said die for! <EOR> I las vegas staying Paris hotel sisters bachelorette weekend decided come breakfast before walking whole strip  thought way early drink didnt taste drinks but girls said strong good  don't recall name breakfast but remember finishing whole plate just needed  fact all girls devoured most food  outdoors seating nice people watching plan next adventure  would return future bachelorette weekend !! <EOR> We bit service problem lunch time  couldn't refills timely manner took some time through meal  better Yolo's other Mexican food but Texas Cali Mexican food level   That said quesadillas fantastic  nice crust outside hadn't seen before  queso below average mind but drinks good nice place  Again whole no free chips salsa thing kind blows mind when getting Mexican food    <EOR> If come ask Danny   guy definitely sure you're taken care of     Tacos awesome!

Visiting Texas  Food amazing flavorful FRESH  wrong here  <EOR> Food good service fast  Sitting balcony very loud if don't loud would sit inside  Otherwise place is Pretty cool! <EOR>   Review www JerseyGirlinVegas com   Several months ago came across groupon restaurant strip Planet Hollywood called Cabo Wabo  Mexican Cantina type restaurant some great dining options   As approached birthday boyfriend asked where wanted birthday dinner  Without hesitation said Cabo Wabo! Lucky another Groupon going $15 $30 worth food drinks!  Last time shared 3 Choice Fajita  bit pricy $45 but well worth it! Both times selected sirloin chicken shrimp  Both times fantastic!! perfect amount food two people where leave full satisfied    During first visit margarita rocks which yummy!! time buck beer 5 $21  bit frustrating when walked hostess little bar sign $5 beers but when inside dine bump those same beers $6 7 each  much difference more principal  guess try tourist leave resort $5 beer?   Moral post Eat Cabo Wabo's but your beer bar near host area  <EOR> I cannot say clearly enough GO! wasted $86 place  Took over 20 minutes just chips salsa  Chicken Fajitas Pork Carnitas bland tasteless  ordered pitcher margaritas am lightweight almost 3 glasses never felt thing  husband used bartend seriously doubted ANY tequila overwhelming flavor sweet sour  No dissing waitress she attempted best no help front door staff bus staff  Yes busy Saturday night but did expect that? C'mon already strip! only part made feel any better view Bellagio water show  Come sit bar overlooking water! <EOR> Great place people watch!  service just absolutely sucks   Takes forever food drink   But if sit outside patio people watch great view   Very cool  <EOR> I bought groupon place because figured could just some drinks it  told hostess just wanted drink she pointed direction outside bar   well no seats bar wandered around eventually sat ourselves inside bar  BF couple 'signature' margaritas  pretty terrible  prickly pear margarita very strong tasted fairly terrible  Also put some super spicy stuff around rim cup really unpleasant mentioned menu  drinks 12$  ridiculous  would come back again  <EOR> Came quick frozen margarita which okay icy slush  offer different flavors  Unfortunately don't remember names flavors but thinking bar all remember blue green yellow red black margaritas dispenser pump    I'm much margarita guy but hey serve different hotels just those colors margaritas tempting nice cool inject alky mood    Service good bartender pleasant sucked typically tell extra shots cost extra few bucks hook up? Overall quick margarita place recommended if happen walk down Planet Hollywood some re charging  <EOR> Three stars great service    waiter awesome  He top things offered many options specials   The food other hand wasn't great  beans runny think actual bean included watery bean stuff   rice fluffy but very tasty  asada dry but some good flavors    The churros pretty good   The facility very clean but little run down considering strip where everything glamorous  <EOR> Went breakfast food AMAZING! many options very affordable great service  <EOR> First time trying place coming year year never took time come  big mistake definitely must try came breakfast chilaquiles quesadilla both BOMB ! packed flavor returning also very good service nice host server Amber very helpful made great recommendations  Thank Guys !!! <EOR> Wonderful food   sat patio under heated umbrellas cool night air laughed night away   duo ceviche appetizer LOVED IT!  tuna favorite   dinner short rib tacos!
