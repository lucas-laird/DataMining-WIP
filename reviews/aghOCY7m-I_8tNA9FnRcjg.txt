The foods really nice  place cery clean modern  Would recommend thus food anyone any age  Good jo Chiam! <EOR> Food really good would come back again if lived Las Vegas  bit expense side amount food given  <EOR> Not sure why place includes dim sum name  only traditional dim sum item offer siu mai charge $1 28 per individual piece  other offerings same standard fare you'd find average Chinese buffet  setup same Panda Express choose noodles rice two entrees  But food inferior Panda Express and big fan Panda Express   top off two meals without drinks $28! <EOR> Thought would try ChiAm again see if any organic options sign advertisements say have   Nope still nothing organic   Also weekday just before noon no customers no beef   guess know why no customers both visits  <EOR> The shrimp ball cold outside almost frozen inside  Pork dimsum tasted smelled fish but pork meat  items very expensive things prepared fresh looked old sitting steam table  $13 50 2 item plate steam table No way  <EOR> This biggest waste money time ever done   Flavorless food  Awful service time  Size wise  Tiny tiny tiny all jus another Chinese food place couple appetizers  Don't waste time  <EOR> Unbelievably disappointing  first thought is why dim sum name when offering scant? Serving 4 different kinds shumai hardly qualifies  LOVE dim sum excited when heard place opened nearby home must understand disappointment   This Panda Express knock off! sales pitch serving supposed organic food may only thing going them  considering all things equal Panda Express because they're meals better priced I can't believe just said that   Lucky still choice  other hand fortunate  daughter hungry settled    The cafe clean tastefully decorated plays upbeat music pleasant staff hence extra star    If describe overall experience 3 words it's ever returning  <EOR> I visited restaurant twice to go orders  only complaints side item wrong 4 meals purchased husband felt beef overly spiced  being said chicken consistently delicious fried rice best fried rice restaurant  restaurant immaculately clean love coca cola freestyle  All food received took approximately 20+ minute wait but no complaints all fresh totally worth it  <EOR> Opens 10am arrived 11 10   Girl working cash register very helpful explaining order choices   However nothing organic side available   Ordered orange chicken walnut shrimp wife ordered beef broccoli also teriyaki chicken   also ordered shrimp balls some dim sum everything go   FINALLY FOOD 11 55!!!!  suspect may first customers day but if open 10 hour prep should gotten food faster   also forgot dim sum order   only reason added star because food pretty good obviously freshly made   But wait half menu unavailable price order mess up   we won't back  <EOR> Food no MSG pay bit more that  Most if all chinese restaurant uses MSG  place clean design good  wish guys goodluck  <EOR> Really fresh food  Great Vegetarian Vegan options super reasonable price  Friendly staff  highly recommend! <EOR> A very Panda esque restaurant  claim serve organic options here  hopefully lot healthier   Food better tasting panda tastes more fresh   Nice presentation upon ordering  Friendly service  Only reason gets four stars instead five because very expensive here  Two two side order plates dim sum large drink cost $32 change  back  But next split three side order plate ever come hold off coupon  <EOR> Nice staff told 10 min thougha nd still waiting half hr later  May update eat food but thought woulda t least checki n     <EOR> Good food   however would seen larger selection dim sum  Sui Mai which very good Kung pao chicken  Right now only offer Sui Mai shrimp balls  chef said offering more dim sum soon  Otherwise everything good  <EOR> The worst Chinese food ever tasted  ordered two traditional chef platter because did organic time  server helpful she spent time informing don't have  beef walnuts walnut shrimp it Noon   ordered Garlic Prawns Mandarin Port Emperor Chicken Mushrooms Long Life Noodles King Fried Rice  Don't let fancy names fool you  Emperor Chicken simply boiled gray dark meat button mushrooms off white water  Long Life Noodles greasy pile brown noodles few strands scallions cabbage  fried rice dry few frozen carrots peas  three small pieces shrimp three sprigs broccoli  much better quality price Panda Express  saying much  only patrons time took cook over 15 minutes prepare food  two traditional platter two medium drinks cost $26  dim sum selection joke  only serve dumplings each bite size dumpling $1 68 piece  used Groupon $12 $20 discount still worth it  <EOR> My family because yet find good asian restaurant town  good looking forward going back  only thing I'd change larger portion sizes because everything good  ordered noodles florida orange chicken white rice spring rolls  those awesome soda machines allow almost any drink you'd which big plus! cashier nice enough put basketball game tv place super clean <EOR> As soon walked noticed clean restaurant is  staff duty

friendly staff! serve organic which why prices high side  craving dim sum let down small selection had  impressed nice staff was  Pacific Shrimp Roll perfect tasted great! <EOR> As pulled parking spot saw ChiAm cooks walk Great Links couple doors down some food  good sign if cooks won't eat food own restaurant  wife bought Groupon sampled few things menu  shared shrimp ball which huge but lacked seasoning  tried couple pieces dim sum which tasty but falling apart  also tried platter noodles orange chicken walnut shrimp  walnut shrimp highlight meal crispy flavorful  But orange chicken lacked flavor noodles way much onion  more onion actual noodles  probably coming back  <EOR> great dumplings shiu mai  least close SF china town's dimsum bathrooms clean very clean <EOR> TL DR Sui mai does dim sum restaurant make   Lured words dim sum exterior building knew trouble when walked cafeteria style setup  looked menu only thing dim sum category sui mai four types   sides apps section included Pacific Shrimp Ball    Majority offerings premade sitting under a heat lamp exposed to the air offerings find any Chinese fast food joint  claim use higher quality organic ingredients but if you're going serve way doesn't matter  7PM no customers freshness food questionable    The items sampled average if slightly below  Sui mai huge golf ball sized items which helped justify $1 30 charge per piece  Shrimp items fresh juicy nicely shrimpy  Pork chicken ? sui mai did stand out  fully convinced aren't freezer just freshly prepared  <EOR> Finally managed try place but disappointed  two stars cleanliness friendly staff  food ranged okay sad  dim sum restaurant only dim sum available four different meats  beef pork shrimp boring chicken disgusting  They're large least  thought long life noodles okay but hubby's entrees boring tough chewy  doesn't matter organic if badly cooked kept warming trays long  might return noodles some day but nothing else   Post visit note NOW they've added more Dim Sum sure want try them because love dim sum but sure it'll quite while before do  need memory visit dim more  <EOR> We don't say food often but awful dim sum really poor  tried all them honestly resembled something washed beach  mention each them stuck badly paper plate served on  found ourselves having choke down pieces immediately needing something chase down taste   Their fried rice teriyaki wasn't bad but chicken seemed boiled flavored just eh     We won't going back <EOR> This place offers delicious high quality food  prices bit expensive Much organic <EOR> This new contemporary Asian eatery tucked away corner Lowes shopping plaza between Starbucks Great Links   Cute fresh decor   They've only open 5 weeks probably need work few things  expecting good variety dim sum since  sign indicated but only 4 type siu mai  shrimp pork beef chicken plus pacific shrimp ball  also standard Chinese entrees steam trays  ordered all varieties siu mai $1 98 each hot oil mustard sauces hot sour soup  The cashier helpful friendly gave 10% discount  generously sized dumplings okay flavor   soup could bit more savory     really want them succeed because would nice good dim sum place nearby hope change menu differentiate other Chinese food places maybe adding steamed baked char siu bao along other popular dim sum appeal good cross section people  <EOR> Food delicious  chicken corn soup Mongolian beef both organic regular gmo organic tastes better Pacific shrimp balls  shrimp balls huge tasty chicken corn soup hearty filling   The price kind high get  would think $13 88 large container would getting small rice  But guess organic means added cost   The restaurant clean employees nice   For Chinese fast food pretty good  Much better panda express  <EOR> Immediately greeted warmly  place wad very clean love flower printed things ceiling  menu little confusing but servers helped understand order  Everything made fresh only took 10 minutes total  California broccoli beef orange chicken long life noodles  delicious  love servers greet come in   would definitely back sometime soon <EOR> Well waited month place open   Some 4 wings 2 pieces dimsum

Good service HORRIBLE overpriced food  morons need down Chinatown see dim sum is  place Panda Express dim sum  Worst shumai dumplings ever had  <EOR> This restaurant  business which knew would happen

more money food cold  Tried denied won't back! <EOR> There article local paper said fast casual Chines Dim Sum Restaurant   guess true if consider dim sum 4 choices siu mai different meats   chicken corn soup best thing had   offer organic choices which drew place but those dishes $3 more wonder work when comes cooking in same woks? same utensils?    Granted smaller portions served would think would fresher would cook them more often but many items looked sitting while    Basically just glorified version Panda Express  <EOR> Service excellent  Beef Broccoli very good  Orange Chicken good but no Orange sauce  Dim Sum Just Ok  Kind strange tasting  Shrimp Fried Ball good  King Fried Rice no Meat Which bland  expensive Just Ok Food  <EOR> Had amazing dining experience!  food fantastic!  Can't believe healthy everything is!!!!  Really top notch service too!  back <EOR> I put star could write review  would put 0 if could  didn't half items menu  No organic meats no shrimp no dim sum  groupon $20 worth 50cents under $20 made purchase something else over $20   food quality mediocre say least  When opened plate amazed tiny portion was! never coming back recommend place  <EOR> Worst place ever  Bring back quadobas please   looks fast Panda Express type place  girlfriend only people getting food took over 20 minutes them food  dim sum disgusting worth 1 68 piece more 5 cents <EOR> While bad place eat really dim sum restaurant  some dumplings but basically nicer more modern version your corner Chinese food take place  sure back but worth trying least once  <EOR> I reviewed restaurant grand opening thought excellent  took wife lunch today disappointed  store very clean comfortable   Apparently Health Department earlier day location retained its rating  Now food both ordered combo platters $10 88 each included rice organic noodles two regular entrees beverage  Appetizers substituted entrees  Unlike Panda taste bland overwhelmingly sweet   meat tender vegetables fresh   No dreaded MSG only healthful organic ingredients really feel good having lunch there!  ordered beef broccoli chicken wings shrimp balls noodles  included photo below  am very suspicious lower ratings given few others would suspect written request competitors  <EOR> Fresh delicious definitely different and delicious experience  Service great restaurant immaculate food definitely worth waiting for  We'll back soon! <EOR> Horrible  Serving shumai does restaurant dim sum place   terrible copy Panda Express   Tried teriyaki chicken walnut shrimp   3 pieces shrimp 4 pieces chicken rice 12 bucks   If good then maybe  Yuck <EOR> It's 15 minute wait mediocre fast food dim sum won't even serve glass water place joke <EOR> Not sure why there's much bad reviews place really good honestly     par most amazing dim sum but enjoyed it!

Only shumai shrimp ball  should change signage  Wasn't fan shumai  shrimp balls really good admit   Honestly would knocked Place down 2 stars but other dishes decent boyfriend liked it   taste food fresh  Except maybe walnut shrimp   Looked sitting while  entrees smaller batches  offer organic option higher price  say pass save your money traditional version  <EOR> just wasted time driving all way across town try place apparently they're closed because many people getting food poisoning here! good know! <EOR> My only complaint place isn't closer house work  Yes you'll pay little more other places town but food obviously higher quality    No mystery meat other Chinese places  worth pay little more know eating    Also staff really friendly  never walked into fast food restaurant greeted warmly  glad they'll opening more locations around town  <EOR> Came around afternoon  Cashier very helpful attentive  Food came timely manner  its freshly made  food good service smile  <EOR> Very very slow order food  Interesting  I'd say similar Panda Express but far less food flavorful   Quite expensive little bit food  Plus organic vegetables! thought must new place everyone learning but they've open 8 months! Doubt we'll back! <EOR> Unfortunately whole concept place seems off   trying next panda express? But wait serve fast food Chinese food but fast   it's cooked order   Hmmmm going survive?  walked place empty albeit friendly staff showed menu explained food   No clue why labeled dim sum shu mai dumplings   that's it   ordered longevity noodles beef broccoli   noodles tastier Panda Express but beef broccoli very similar   also very limited menu food options compared Panda Express food more expensive   however organic option     All all don't concept don't think going very long   More expensive slower Panda Express less options   If going setup fast food joint fast appeal clientele   want step higher Panda Express but don't deliver goods  <EOR> I very disappointed place  regret going lunch today  Panda Express way better option food service here  <EOR> Been twice now  Both times soul dining place yet 5 employees behind counter  exactly same setup Panda Express but pitch organic options dim sum  Dim sum nothing rave ordered food told would 10 minute wait  looked everything already but probably cook Dim sum order waste  10 minutes asked if ready another 10 minutes  impression when you're eating food waited ?   Asian woman walked asked few questions walked !

Bad business! next door another restaurant instead  great meal Great Links always! When back car noticed few more customers inside getting food  heck???? <EOR> I figured would close year end last year made few more months then closed door bad tho potential quality Chinese food grille  <EOR> I am disappointed place  anxious open often Starbucks run next door  decided try tonight  two meal option Order items individually  first issue organic two item $13 99  regular two item $10 99  seems little higher priced but fine totally willing try it    Especially if find its worth being little more pricey most Chinese tried area  problem more half items organic your options pretty limited  closing food HORRIBLE  don't even know where start!The noodles sticky dry    rice crunchy sitting days Mongolian beef probably equivalent dog food comes orange chicken tasted microwaved several times throughout day  note demanded refund walked out! first clue should've place empty!
