Why toppings cold?  A waste money  <EOR> Good convenient location right off Lake Mead US 95  sometimes stop way back somewhere north coming off Lake Mead exit going southbound US 95    Parking kind pain sometimes especially since blind spots created some curved areas kind tight curves larger vehicles    My usual order burrito bowl extra white rice black beans half chicken half steak mild hot sauce extra corn sour cream cheese guacamole sometimes depends if im FEELING day lettuce    Service amazing  day ran both steak chicken  myself another customer wait few minutes then few minutes again another  finished ordering end manager store said meal free because waited long  O o wot? im standing credit card already    Lol staff super nice just because getting free meal    Still come eat despite all recent news going around xD <EOR> Had solid 1 star experience location keep going back   Dining room pretty messy which tolerate  rude inconsiderate staff something different   Suffice say left wash hands came back discover food left counter thrown away overzealous employee  When discovered happened told would no replacement but instead directed where could food garbage can   So eat Chipotle if want eat restaurant where staff thinks ok if eat garbage  <EOR> Never seen chipotle stingy food  half scoop everything burrito even asking more rice beans another half scoop  Every other location does full scoop least but one  Avoid location all times  <EOR> While applaud your efforts clean your menus am completely disgusted way employees treat others  Case point while driving restaurant last Thursday your employee gunned past cut off hit breaks red turn signal Rock Springs  caused hit breaks groceries spill bags  light turned green off he drove into parking lot walked right work  took picture car because he needs made aware careless behavior  chose n burger instead  am keeping would really say only professional courtesy your company  step foot location ever  <EOR> Love food! Place always clean but full  Parking small  main complaint workers rude snotty times    No thanks! <EOR> I actually really food low review service difference portion give compared another location  location Durango nicer staff actually bit more giving when comes burrito bowls  food great service not  You're better off going Durango! <EOR> The food great but tell place develops long lines during non peak hours   Management does staff line properly efficiency   standing line now 20 minutes haven't made order yet   line door only 2 people preparing food   Manager nowhere seen  <EOR> Closest location but definitely worth driving bit further elsewhere    The portions overall lesser side even if asked extra  Chipotle can't expect much customer service since piece your order together  But if looked photo would able tell asked extra for? Probably not    Always those days when just crave Chipotle but if neighborhood I'd rather N since literally across street  <EOR> Just passing through while visiting friends Vegas   came Chipotle quick bite eat   workers extremely friendly soon walked greeted even bough really busy  All workers hustling while being attentive polite customer's situations surrounding them   Nataly assume shift leader manager engaged friendly conversation asking many months pregnant she nice helpful   just wanted give props because she seems run good team she made small chipotle experience memorable enough write post Yelp  left happy full super satisfied food <EOR> Nightmare  Always problem location  No forks really! Try eating salad spoon  Poor attitudes  Save your time eat different location <EOR> I luv Chipotle but all locations same    The staff prepared meal location 7175 W  Lake Mead LV NV 89128 rude unprofessional sarcastic    The girl rang bill polite guy back cooking looked hard work two idiots making order could learn those two   The pico de gallo looked disgusting       looked mushed old tomatoes looked disgusting    This location 1 STAR <EOR> Although may chain always delicious employees always friendly  come often burritos consistently good staff always friendly  Although may line may trouble finding parking good reason delicious! PLUS many meats organic support family owned operated farms which great  <EOR> I'm really big Mexican food kind person told Chipotle isn't Mexican but coming when Vegas  usually bowl steak guacamole salsa stuff    Bottom line good fill up  learned something  visit  McDonald's hand Chipotle  <EOR> Great customer service!  Today line ordering salad   didn't lettuce ready told them would wait help other customers line   only waited few minutes helped 3 4 customers until back me   finished order when time pay told order house since wait!  Extremely nice them  <EOR> If Chipotle considered fast food and fast outside lunch rush then better fast food options there   In general food solid but thing miss when dine other similar establishments Chipotle's carnitas!  better carnitas 80% Mexican restaurants town   and well sweet corn salsa! <EOR> Always fast friendly service great Tex mex flavor! location also very clean! Customer service great too  <EOR> For last week NO LETTUCE   preposterous  need buy some close down place  <EOR> Been frequenting chipotle over 15 years love always happy price serving size   location always quick friendly service even if long line moves swiftly  location never disappoints only negative thing think chicken being bit burnt dry but 3 4 times ever better well done under done   Quite impressive actually 8 years going staff management changes sure taken place  <EOR> Food alone should made 5 stars but guy cooking giving coworkers attitude  no steak veggies left which ordering no problem waiting  He seemed really prissy mood  <EOR> Chipotle never disappoints !

Wtf? <EOR> When fast food chain really only two things looking for   food good done correctly? The prices fair no different any other place     The service nice  quick easy   I'd back if ever area <EOR> As someone used eat Chipotle several times week recently seen light Zabas first trip back Chipotle months   There aren't really lot bad things say Chipotle but same time lot good things rave either  best part Chipotle cilantro lime rice its buttery fluffy great flavor  No does rice better fast casual market    Beyond everything else Chipotle offers rather average  protein selection wide but none them strike particularly amazing  Chipotle also doesn't give lot meat unless ask 'a little more ' pay double meat  tortillas bland cheese almost thick creates gelatinous layer top your bowl if go    I've also experienced many inconsistencies rice texture meat temperature meat seasoning various other aspects something seems fairly straightforward cook    Overall if you're looking something fast cheap relatively healthy side compared something McDonalds Chipotle solid choice  But if really want amazing fast casual Mexican food Zabas better selections fish shrimp don't skimp anything Cilantro Pesto probably greatest sauce ever created  <EOR> I am extremely disappointed chipotle  Over course couple months yes couple months husband loves eat bad experiences everything fountain machine working running meat soggy chips now pure brown guacamole  worst part manager told avocado season  why brown  funny cause buy avocados restaurant aren't brown!
