Glad tried place! definitely going back! <EOR> Without Yelp $20 $10 deal may never really given El Regio much thought   would just ended Roberto's   But wow glad visited!  The wifey recognized owners El Regio because used own Mexican restaurant work closed down Rancho   She glad see still business because used some killer and killer cheap breakfast burritos   plus one   But minus because made think If closed down other place because food? Luckily not luckily them turns think owner building decided sell   old restaurant demolished almost immediately closing sits now brand new Checker's which might add 1st review    El Regio pretty off beaten path located between gas station convenience store do it yourself pet grooming place   Totally non descript   Let your eyes wander far down road just might miss turn into parking lot   Upon entering restaurant fairly small   Good guess would cater take out crowd   But 4 5 small tables where dine in     The menu El Regio very similar style tone your local Roberto's   Easy read includes lots pictures   day family carne asada mood   Really carne asada everyone!  naughty naughty naughty choices   shared Carne Asada Nachos Carne Asada French Fries Carne Asada Burrito  Steak crazy!  good measure special cheap combos Chicken Burrito drink only $3 99   know just lighten meaty mood   Verdict?  Holy crap stuffed!  Greasy cheesy gooey all spades   Fatty goodness!  Please place El Regio expect overly healthy   salsa bar complete cucumbers marinated carrots jalapenos   but  far organic goes   old proverbs If destroy destroy completely pulled off 187 undercover cop murdered almost all glorious carne asada!  LOT around   funny places El Regio builds thin layer carbs bottom heaping layer steak heaping layer cheese healthy scoop sour cream guacamole   Healthy   know carbs bad should all Atkins Diet!    Carne asada nachos fries good but said layer chips fries meat skewed   Much bigger portion meat carb   Which = good   rather more meat cheese more chip fry   trays pretty heavy   hold myself back eating much red meat sitting   Good thing four share   lot food     The carne asada burrito wasn't skimpy either   Loaded just steak pico de gallo guacamole   Fat burrito   only managed finish half it   liked chicken burrito because actually lots going on   Marinated shredded chicken Mexican rice pinto beans   lighter which good needed help cut through all meat just eaten     The only real complaint any carne asada bit heavy handed onions   lot more raw chopped onion dishes would liked   No big deal though next time we'll just request little no onion order     Prices reasonable well   Running same rate Roberto's really comes down preference location   multiple Roberto's locations its kinda El Regio beat   But those side town should really give El Regio try   $20 $10 coupon only pay extra $7 pocket   steal all food   leftovers!  Which happily took work lunch next day   Along some Tic Tacs  <EOR> We watching show afternoon featuring wet burritos  inspired search nearby place try  pleasantly surprised find place very close  Based great Yelp reviews   and photo exact burrito craved   we headed door two minutes later   There two people working restaurant clean  flat grill really clean which very nice see  interior very simple no decorations  very inviting but taking food did bother us   We ordered burrito pastor carne asada  done quickly headed home  food excellent  definitely coming back  Clean restaurant friendly people excellent food   check check check! <EOR> Best place inexpensive quality Mexican food! If your northwest part Las Vegas place your Mexican on! <EOR> Came when yelp deal $10 $20 food pretty good price   would say food better Roberto's but won't good nice sit down dinner   some good carne asada fries shrimp chicken pork carne aside tacos   few times now just some horchata  <EOR> Under new management  Love burritos huevos rancheros nachos  Always coming back since down street house  <EOR> Solid taco shop tried driving long time  back again  grew Southern CA know way around Mexican food  Burritos Chicken rice fish carnitas carne asada all good  Decent Salsa bar three flavors marinated carrots cucumbers   El Regio solid choice NW Las Vegas Ann 95 north Give them shot  <EOR> Hmmmm don't know  really feeling it  always try base reviews off things overall  just food portion   I carnitas adobada  The meat seriously lacking flavor all could taste onions   The carnitas taco bland didn't seem slow cooked  somewhat tender but fall apart your mouth   The adobada typically very strong marinated pork least flavor ever experienced    Even green avacado salsa rice beans use very mediocre bland    I don't know  Maybe picky? Or   I food flavor it?  I also need point important detail STARVING when ate these  hadn't eaten 6 hours eat every 2 3 hours daily basis  When starving pretty much think almost anything good  being said should stick your mind  I know haven't tried other items menu but tacos should key factor any mexican joint  taco whore judge any place based tacos  main thing majority people eat when want fast Mexican if can't right don't know anything else could better  If Asian Mexican joint Asians cooking right   I don't know hell else can  <EOR> I grilled chicken burrito $4 99 huge homemade burrito  Very authentic  employees very well groomed restaurant kept felt clean safe eating within  prices definitely affordable well worth purchase  recommend everyone stop if you're side often authentic Mexican food  Awesome food awesome service  <EOR> The salsa bar veggies pictured don't exist  Coke machine pictured doesn't exist  Flowers tables pictured? Nope those either   They didn't even water customers literally  guy told could water bathroom sink if wanted water  WTF?!  The carne did good flavor but California burrito steak fries cheese  it  No guacamole no sour cream no pico de gallo    nada!  Seriously disappointed high Yelp ratings run down taco joint  Pretty much Meh  experienced better  Way way better  <EOR> Well   it's taco shop  All ingredients excellent everything reasonably priced staff friendly  Better Roberto's  <EOR>
