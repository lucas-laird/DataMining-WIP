Very disappointed place! can't believe all hipe! just basic chicken   I never ever back place! Why pass Popeyes Churches chicken place! Kudos opening business creating jobs  just doesn't float boat! <EOR> Apparently driven place million times but never noticed it   looking new places try online found though quickly made trip over there     I arrived shortly before lunch rush hit    fairly small place just 6 7 tables   feeling most people just takeout   While cashier quite upbeat service fairly slow   just chicken strip meal fries drink took good 10 minutes prepare   asked no cole slaw but put anyway     You decent amount food pay but nothing really sticks particularly good special   chicken strips standard fare lot pepper batter fries just fine   hot sauce fairly disappointed it   another reviewer said basically straight bottle   pretty sure just Louisiana Hot Sauce some knockoff  lot more vinegary thinner Frank's Red Hot just give idea expect   also piece bread your meal   buttered toasted just plain piece white bread which soaked some grease fries strips   am fairly sure stale left while bit dry crunchy started curl up    Even though didn't eat slaw comes tiny container  tiny Solo cups some places ketchup them   According menu 2 ounces   hot sauce comes same size container absolutely enough   If want extra pay it     Aside chicken strips regular fried chicken some fish menu doesn't much else offer   If want side dish your options only jalapeno peppers okra mushrooms cole slaw   Seriously?  No mashed potatoes?  No biscuits?  No mac cheese?  No green beans?    The prices seem random oddly overpriced some places well   extra hot sauce $0 50 but small cole slaw $0 44   Chicken wings cost over $1 each ordered sizes 13 18 24 but 10 cents more expensive per wing if order 24 if order 13     right more expensive more get     I love chicken but best Harold's just called absolutely average almost every respect slightly disappointing  <EOR> I super excited when heard Harold's opening Vegas  opinion Chicago some best food around  wing dinner some extra chicken side hot sauce  pretty packed when which late afternoon but only waited ten minutes  heard another friend wait lot longer occasionally sell evenings  wish gave more cold slaw huge fan fries because little soggy  But chicken anyways which perfectly fried perfection  <EOR> Damn harolds gonna knock down star last time visited disappointment  cook must've reached bottom seasoning batter perhaps wings brined long cause wings pretty salty   <EOR> Harold's mainstay life Chicago positively tremulous upcoming visit Vegas would give chance sup delectable birds   Look you're getting fried chicken dinner Queen  Adjust expectations accordingly  ones Chicago hole in the wall type place small exactly sparking clean  But actually much nicer frequented Chicago  No bulletproof glass no sticky walls no seedy crowds   The chicken deep fried crispy hot  half chicken soda set back whopping 10 bucks  served on fries tiny button coleslaw  only things missing two slices white bread come why drop ball there! hot sauce thing love nice hot tangy  There's BBQ style well if want   All all most satisfied Harold's would fit right South Side  <EOR> I wanted place   really did   don't   place non descript person behind cash register did utter single word during order nor during orders next 4 groups observed   order mixed chicken dinner    cole slaw actually wasn't bad but served small cup size two thimbles   think two spoonfuls it   french fries ordinary   leg chicken incredibly small mean really small   Very little meat thigh wing well expect that breast did meat but wasn't anything extraordinary   did order mild sauce   ok   All all really doubt place around year now   Exciting concept but poorly executed here    employees need personality portions need normalized whoever orders chickens should splurge order normal sizes   Seems cutting everything bone save money but cutting off arm process   easily better Las Vegas   Really  <EOR> I thoroughly impressed place   Vacant tables cleaned generally uninspired staff service   cashier didn't take order correctly she asked sauce wanted fish tartar didn't put takeout order   Another customer approached counter ask bread left dinner   subsequently found left dinner order well   The chicken although nice crispy pretty bland   say same catfish Old Bay seasoning anyone? cole slaw very fresh   Chicago Harold's left better impression even though hole in the wall storefront spot   would recommend waste your time money place  <EOR> My husband Chicago he's reason heard place  just opened recently but would NEVER know place super busy!   We chicken fries pizza puff  GOOD  never pizza puff totino's pizza rolls but WAY better bigger! Almost everyone one! Chicken good breaded seasoned very good    The 4 stars because seating packed very small restaurant fills quick  Luckily son grab first available table while ordered  Other awesome lil spot  <EOR> I've heard many rave reviews place give try even though bit drive work  Gizzards Wings combo added small side fried okra   I honest  little disappointed  only two wings order rest plate gizzards  While both tasted good expecting more wings  Just opinion but gizzards should accompaniment wings other way around! only eat many  plate also comes fries some coleslaw  fries decent but good could be   I wanted love place especially since gave extra food due error part  While waiting meal guy comes explains cook misheard started preparing Giblets instead Gizzards Wings  offered give Giblet plate well  took offer but full eating gizzards sure if ever it's fridge    I'm little fried moment and definitely gizzarded out but definitely want come back try something else  probably try chicken dinners perhaps fish plate  now give them A OK  <EOR> I grew South Side Chicago Hyde Park fact work Chicago Executive VP famous Regal Theater 79th Street   husband lived Las Vegas 15 years   Nobody fried chicken Harold's   NOBODY!!!  taste unique finger likin good   Another location soon open 215 Trop   wish heck put Centennial Hills   Rainbow handle all business getting   need help!
