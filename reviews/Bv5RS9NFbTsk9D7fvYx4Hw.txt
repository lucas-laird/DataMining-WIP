The cashier pretty nice but think only upside expierence   They completely ranch don't ketchup dispenser  Though little weird because every McDonald's one  When husband ask ranch lady extremely rude too  The fries hot tho burgers okay  If you're really hungry hotel want something cheap if recommend this  Other then that  would say your better off leaving hotel going different McDonald's  <EOR> Stopped McDonald's location cool off when wandering through Circus Circus  place pretty small but does job  Tables clean service fast  did any attitude while ordering which always good thing  <EOR> This McDonald's located Midway section Circus Circus where circus acts performed kids games played   I believe prices same regular McDonald's locations   priced higher just because located inside Hotel Casino Vegas    good thing   There plenty tables seating   Nice spot getaway some craziness casino and or children's games  <EOR>
