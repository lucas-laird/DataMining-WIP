I've taken several people took some convincing  name Pasta Pirate people expect some kind Italian Chucky Cheese  lot weird looks but once inside try food they're hooked!   The restaurant VERY small intimate  reservations otherwise you'll easily least hour half wait  While inconvenient walk dining adds bit exclusivity insider regular knowledge which kind part fun    The food delicious great value money  Each dinner served amazing bread salad glass house wine  highly recommend clam Linguine White Sauce    If could change thing place would name  Then maybe I'd easier time convincing people go! coupled pretty much reservation only system small size can't handle large groups 4 Star review me  Still overall great place dine downtown  <EOR> Our waiter Dionicio coolest greatest waiter planet Earth! come part because him  He gods gift restaurant community  food good deals great! can't lose dinner specials have   Visit Pasta Pirate AVOID RAT HOSTESS enjoy awesome waiter Dionicio food!!

Oh sorry if hurt your feelings because don't know your job then crappy boss doesn't know share information customer  manager offered buy each drink we said no thank you dessert we didn't want anything   top very end took while credit cards processed  said don't blame server star rating upped two because her  Beatrice did great job trying sure taken care checked often  more overall experience said won't back    As food each just ordered Alaskan King Crab salty  $40 I'd rather stand line buffet come back here  <EOR> Came because Market Street Cafe closed cleaning  menu there  needed    oxtail soup me!    Service good food! <EOR> It many calories inches since last dined Italian seafood restaurant located dump California            Entrees include glass wine choice seafood soup house salad  each chose salad dressing side cioppino entrees  cioppino served over linguini included lobster shrimp clams white fish saffron tomato broth  surprised much enjoyed dining experience though wife little less enthusiastic  <EOR> I would prefer eat here   food isn't great   ambiance weird   But worst thing eaten life  <EOR> Came last visit Las Vegas finding coupon online   Immediately walking sensed chaos   hostess could keep track people walking she kept walking away stand   People starting getting angry she just didn't want deal it   Finally seated but waitstaff just hostess seemed show much indifference presence   Finally being served meals   it really just eh   think Olive Garden I am really fan tastes better   broccoli cavatelli swimming garlic oil   I didn't even want left overs   Won't returning  <EOR> Arrr ravioli! Pasta Pirate cozy dark restaurant California Hotel Downtown Vegas   serves pasta duh! steak salads bunch other stuff   service friendly cool watching chefs glass booth food you   best part meal calamari  it oily all came tasty sauce   free wine comes every meal? Oh no wait BEST part meal FREE! Yay comped meals! *See pics* <EOR> So hangin downtown want full meal deal more ambience Mickey D's mo betta menu sure  Now sayin gourmet fine dining but hey da $ good reliable  frequently eat when want touch aloha filet lobster small but ok glass wine included $19  addition scoop rice steak lobster nice touch indeed  sistah seafood pasta said da bomb   town guests always amazed place exist land over priced EVERYTHING  bonus when run into friends friends friends da island  feel am home surrounded aloha spirit  <EOR> I've going California Hotel years never really thought dining here  boyfriend selected place surprise date he planned  didn't reservations but only took 20 minutes seated which gotta say isn't bad Friday night!  The food pretty good but can't really say much since almost always chicken fettuccine alfredo always taste delicious  ONLY negative thing really say against place seating  hard concentrate eating due beaming bright red light hanging over us  know ties into theme pirate but just made difficult eat food  <EOR> With name Pasta Pirate bit hesitant walking into joint but didn't pick place  ambience bit strange but service efficient friendly  try Portobello Chicken Pasta Filet Ribeye  Food pretty good $  mushrooms excellent pasta filet best price $19 Filet + Lobster tail + glass red house wine   I'd eat again if drinking downtown felt good cheap steak  Quick tip ONLY order steak medium rare less anything more your steak come overdone badly  <EOR> My mother town she wanted try Oxtail soup Market Street Cafe  Apparently all friends back home told delicious was  Unfortunately didn't know only served during certain hours I believe 11 00 pm 9 00 am she leaving night  decided try Pasta Pirate next door  walked 5 minutes before opened already many people waiting inside  didn't reservation but because early able table  pretty small restaurant gets crowded very quickly   The menu small but pasta surprisingly very good! ordered Penne Diana which comes sautéed chicken broccoli  garlic butter sauce very tasty overpowering  also little spicy but point where mouth fire  mom ordered pasta day which believe mushroom ravioli  She enjoyed offered some but don't eat mushrooms  portions just right  full but still room some dessert! Speaking desserts would order them here  tried creme brûlée which very bland ice cream tasted something cheap could buy market  Every dinner includes bread soup salad glass wine  both don't drink wine can't comment that  But if order salad sure tell them light dressing ask side because put way much! chose Italian salad very sour!  Service friendly attentive  server checked often drinks always refilled didn't wait very long food even though full house restaurant   Very good pasta but skip dessert! Oh give bunch Andes mints when pay your bill  wouldn't mind coming back again  <EOR>
