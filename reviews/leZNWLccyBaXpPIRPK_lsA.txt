Quick easy affordable  big fan  <EOR> Good food fairly good service but need more drink options and or Coca Cola Freestyle machines   Fazoli's essentially Italian fast food restaurant number dining option entrees available which surprisingly delicious transcend fast food label  once four locations Las Vegas Valley but reasons unknown others closed down only left   As far variety menu no shortage that  Pastas sandwiches pizzas all  No matter should able find something menu  personal favorite entree menu cheese ravioli marinara sauce but am sure find something suits your tastes   The service gotten restaurant always good  semi regular recognize know usually want eat which actually speeds visits little  good find place knows regulars   Prices little high some items but cannot entirely fault restaurant this likely factors into pricing food myself am aware of  still far less traditional dine in Italian restaurant nearly good despite casual approach atmosphere   The problem lack drinks only limited number sodas choose things teas milk lemon ices such  need add vitamin water and or sports drinks menu give customers some variety  Why installed Coca Cola Freestyle machine yet? day age only restaurant Vegas Valley now no excuse this  If anyone management team reading PLEASE install Freestyle machine I already requested official website   If am using coupon requires buy drink need more variety your outdated machines offer   Overall Fazoli's provides quality dining experience though lack Coca Cola Freestyle machines major weakness needs addressed near future  Still would recommend eating despite that  quality Italian food fast  <EOR> Decent food good price  Feels much better most typical fast food places good breadsticks fresh salads  <EOR> Stopped place could past lack cleanliness terrible odor upon entry  location definitely needs some attention detail cleanliness  decided eat based lack cleanliness  <EOR> Yummy fast cheep Italian food  $5 99 lunch special awesome    Special shout breadsticks! garlicy delicious <EOR> It's just your typical chain restaurant pseudo Italian eating establishment  Nothing special  fast food  If fill yourself high sodium pasta entrees your lunch break your place   all say  <EOR> I'm huge fan place but never put any fast food joints better 3 star because quality food meaning fast food place   Other never seen fast food Italian food spot which why love place much  Pasta pasta pasta pretty much any kind pasta want plus slammin' salads w pizza also     YUMMMMM! <EOR> Me hubby enjoying lunch  Thanks great service good food  Terrific value too  <EOR> Not best italian food but if you're mood italian dont want pay sit down restaurant place good option    Their spaghetti meat sauce doesnt much meat  alfredo sauce  bit salty but breadsticks yummy   Sign emails coupons! <EOR> It wasn't good remember  used come lot family back 10 years ago but today nearly close used be  girl works obviously hates job  breadsticks soggy menu big used be  boy  works great worker though he earned most stars lol <EOR> Fazoli's now closed I'm kind sad hear place closed down  email saying closed just called see if true  Unfortunately closed Sunday  If new closing last time ate would've visited few more times  liked getting $5 lunch  I'd normally 2 another kids but we'd all share  <EOR> What say? Italian restaurant drive through    the food solid  ordered Twisted Chicken Parm which twisted noodle pesto sauce chicken pieces cheese  served two breadsticks  would minded try slice pizza which thought ordered but neither charged nor delivered guess ordered slice pizza     Admittedly Italian craving  Though entree tasty just did cut it  meal cost $10 bucks which included pasta large drink but place look back think can't wait next Vegas visit here!    That said imagine locals very convenient drive through  <EOR> While lunch break work decided check Fazoli's again first experience six years ago another location   Nothing changed other prices going flavor going down down down   I ordered #8 which cost $9 79 Penne Creamy Basil Chicken slice pizza w small drink  pasta dish did eat because balsamic tomatoes just overpowering pasta being main course lunch truly disappointed  slice pizza actually very good began thinking should just ordered two slices pizza combo instead    Anyways did contact store Supervisor later inform bitter tasting pasta she did advise most likely added much balsamic which could ruined it   She sweetheart put name credit book may return replacement meal bad pasta dish had    The bread sticks tasty flavorful!  I give them another shot really think just ordered wrong pasta dish wrong time! <EOR> Really good spaghetti meat sauce! Nice atmosphere employees friendly  Unlimited breadsticks when dining in! I tried new spicy marinara sauce very good! The menu variety meals including salads flatbreads  Lots good choices! <EOR>
