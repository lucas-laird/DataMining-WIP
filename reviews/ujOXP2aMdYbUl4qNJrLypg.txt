Still search best breakfast place can't say place but say came hungry home satisfied    My bf ordered create your own omelet  mushrooms olives cheddar cheese omelet very satisfying  omelet comes your choice bread choice potatoes  suggest house potatoes because seasoned perfection  prices reasonable but orange juice pricey being large  $3 50 fresh squeezed orange juice seems way much!   I would most likely come back try some crepes since looked yummy  <EOR> Egg Works  Egg Cracked Egg now Egg World   thinking same thing before mentioned breakfast restaurants but surprised find no way associated another  no surprise apparent Egg World doesn't live others  Bottom line keep driving down real Egg Sahara  <EOR> had sunday breakfast   waited quite while place order place full capacity   other tables getting orders taken faster due server   said part egg works egg which find amazing absoltuely no afilliation all?  hard believ ethat  wait time eggs pancakes 24 minutes    nothing special environment service quality pricing  <EOR> This place GREAT!!!! nothing perfect breakfast Great Coffee tons tv's showing football Sat Sun   It's weekend hangout since moved service completely wonderful entertaining   They dishes everyone standard egg dishes crepes pancakes griddles skillets  Even pickiest person would hard time finding something totally mouth watering menu!!!

Cold eggs cold hollandaise sauce your Benedict Total waste good money!!!! eaten least 4 rimes thinking might better opening  Guess not! <EOR> Our first visit Egg World       Will last visit Egg World   Came today Sunday around 11 45     restaurant mostly empty maybe 10 tables customers      We waited 15 minutes seated       right away repeated few times       15 minutes later seated   The toaster broken      they only toaster Egg place?? Lots complaining other customers      Our breakfast brunch finally served 12 30        Both ordered Eggs Florentine      I report mine      One egg     RAW   barley cooked     did eat it 2nd egg over cooked hard boiled side     English muffin     raw     because toaster broken      I didn't order potatoes    I fruit   that fresh     My husband potatoes    said Denny's would better     We don't Denny's way   Service??

I Omelet tomatoes bacon cheese topped avocado  good but missing something asked some sour cream side    perfect! also came side potatoes which reminded ones Cracked egg  just delicious!  My husband Denver Omelet side hash browns  Judging empty plate he liked ! only complaint coffee tasted funny   I tasted just check  did weird taste it    I liked place especially because offer crepes  think pretty good competition other breakfast houses town! <EOR> Two words slow gross    Our waitress did seem new since she knew regulars but she moved slowly wondered if first day  ordered simple biscuit gravy plate something Vegas seems very well  literally disgusting  Both biscuit gravy entirely sweet prompting put fork down only 2 bites  When dining companion tried food he same reaction    The fresh squeezed juice although overpriced very tasty  <EOR> I always spinach omelette house potatoes   portions generous way much food especially early morning   finish all potatoes though house potatoes bomb   I wish would offer some pancake combos because pancakes pretty good   Breakfast usually comes $15 per person some reason little high side  <EOR>
