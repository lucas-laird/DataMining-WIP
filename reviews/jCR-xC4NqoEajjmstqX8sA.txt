Great food great service   shockingly would say top 3 steakhouse Vegas! <EOR> Well nervous place because further away strip casino itself really depressing ones where just want there   However far only couple exits south freeway once parking easy   menu typical steakhouse choose your steak order sides separately but least steak comes salad appetizer     We large party struggled timing details right all dishes   Having said though dishes right good manager comped problematic dishes +1 that   variety steaks bone ribeye petite filets regular filets new york    rib eye thinner used but still plenty big   other hand new york immensely thick 1 5 inches so    sides cooked well only complaint food some things overly salty   better steak underseasoned could worse   also pushed butterfly filets those agreed seemed end dryer filets wouldn't recommend it   Overall decent steakhouse prices much cheaper equivalent food would strip   looks nice inside once past depression stale off strip casino  <EOR> This steakhouse retro feel modern twist  Service very good able without reservation hour  Luckily Mermaid Lounge right around corner Bass Pro shop open until 9pm plenty until seated  ordered pumpkin spice martini  okay little strong me  little dollop  whip cream might helped  lobster bisque wonderful though! wish would order martini glass full too! very rich decadent  dinner lamb shank over wild mushroom risotto  flavorful gravy great  boyfriend ordered new york steak medium cooked perfectly  sides loaded broccoli covered parmesean bacon garlic mashed potatoes mac cheese  much food just ate mac cheese breakfast haha  Overall meal good definitely above average  enjoyed service atmosphere casino  lovely date night boyfriend bit shopping Bass Pro Shop  wish room dessert    creme brule sounded divine! <EOR> Twin Creeks steakhouse tucked away casino cage Silverton Casino which outlying casinos south side town   see your way LA your left   Though review casino worth mentioning casino caters primarily locals which means does steakhouse   The interior decor nice fancy bit different rustic lodge look rest joint which isn't bad thing either   enter greeted single hostess which better 3 5 hostess thing lot fancy joints seem employ days   It fairly noisy place really two small areas booths edges tables larger groups middle   If dining three less might good request booth if want some amount privacy   Service general bit slow but necessarily bad way   Just should rush see show press your sports bets   Primarily bar service gets pretty backed up   suspect because happy hour   also host or manager? greeting each table   Pretty old school nice touch   Speaking happy hour pleasantly surprised would run happy hour Saturday night   Basically half off tapas menu specialty drinks   tapas menu just 10 items fairly simple   Since tapas focus just ordered bacon wrapped shrimp calamari $10 $8 non happy hour    shrimp good but just four pieces while calamari pretty good but probably smaller portion average   drink menu only 10 mixed drinks such mojito martini expresso mint julip sangrias   drinks fine good deal $5 $3 sangrias wouldn't recommend going tapas specialty drinks without happy hour pricing   Not happy hour oysters $11 Connecticut   pretty good though nothing special   also chop salad $8 pretty standard bleu cheese bacon sharable portion   You basket fancy bread your meal   Actually quite good   Side dishes brocollini $7 mac n cheese $7   former five stalks enough 2 would say   latter 5 inch skillet size   Pretty good but amazing   For main dishes ordered 28oz porterhouse x2 $36 scallops $22    Oddly enough didn't any porterhouse two available menu though would saved some dough   steaks decent made specs but again particularly great but bad either   odd consistency smooth couldn't taste muscle fibers    hard describe   five scallops your order while good lighter appetites   The dessert menu pretty weak passed   mostly consisted ice cream dishes tiramisu   If dessert big deal sure check ahead see may rotate around   Total bill pre tip = $181 18 9 cocktails 2 tapas oysters chop salad mac n cheese broccolini 2 28oz steaks scallops   I'd say pretty good deal   Happy hour saved $43 50   Overall place good place celebrate particular if local   If tourist want somewhere nice but pay fancy strip prices also good you   If want seen scene then definitely your scene   sure reservations   Despite recession place pretty busy  <EOR> I've always heard good things place always places try if near am hungry list  evening long ago found myself way part town fiending some red meat    I worried may casual since wasn't planning eating nice restaurant when set run errands day  sister rolled jeans Chucks without any strange looks hesitation friendly hostess    I ordered lobster bisque thought just okay  more tomato bisque some lobster pieces  lacked buttery richness good lobster bisque IMO    For dinner ordered cilantro marinated rib eye potatoes au gratin  OMG rib eye best steak ever tasted! Perfectly cooked medium rare much great flavor cilantro marinade  great steaks throughout years hard mess steak long its quality meat cooked your liking  But dude cilantro marinade took next level still dreams it! Don't even dare think putting any steak sauce masterpiece  Just leave alone take all yumminess way comes   Although fine dining restaurant definitely pretentious very glad didn't mind casual attire  Otherwise would able experience amazing steak  Next time I'd try some unique concoctions specialty drink menu  finding myself running errands working big appetite side town lot more often! <EOR> Rob bartender amazing!!! drinks amazing!!! dreamsicle chocolate ecstacy espresso martini grasshopper martini all fantastic! food prime rib sliders stuffed peppers those also great highly recommend everyone come see rob won't regret it! <EOR> Went happy hour July 7th 8PM  always love happy hour here  We ordered 3 appetizers 2 people because super hungry   ordered aioli potatotes awesome   half price only 2 dollars!! also ordered 2 glasses Pinot Noir only 4 dollars glass    We ordered meatballs 3 big ones very tasty ordered specials advertised prime rib sliders just meat cheese  These clearly winning 3  Plenty food  The atmosphere awesome well service think total bill 18 dollars screaming deal    also play some awesome old standards enjoy such great food  Cannot wait return  <EOR> Twin Creeks probably favorite local steakhouses  Why? Convenience free parking great customer service along reasonable prices keep coming back   The staff remembers every time come back always bring friends family here  Sometimes when busy service little bit slow but part ambience far am concerned   We enjoy sit down area along Beautiful light changing Rockwall  dimly lit beautiful tiny Steakhouse little gem! sure where Seafood but very fresh highly suggest seafood platter start   I am always partial petite filet mac cheese lobster wedge salad  last visit took friends tomahawk two along Alaskan king crab legs  did disappoint incredibly surprised huge bone Tomahawk Steak!

Scallops Ooohhh MAC CHEESE BURGER     YUMMMY     Worth going just that!!! <EOR> A few months ago husband decided try Twin Creeks dinner based Yelp recommendations fact did feel driving very far   review based dinner experience did any drinks except glass wine dinner     This first time ever stepped Silverton Casino let also Twin Creeks surprised nice was   restaurant itself pretty crowded found decor pleasant   As others said prices pretty cheap   But many other steakhouses town aren't much more expensive Twin Creeks insanely better food   Vic Anthony's Golden Nugget Mon Ami Gabi both good examples this   My husband New York strip while he thought cooked well flavor just okay him   agreed but am fan New York cuts steak   wanted try surf turf fillet lobster which really cheap price $50 sides salad   salad fairly basic side salad sides forgettable   ordered Mac Cheese husband which very dry   He didn't all   sauteed broccolini which found bit greasy  fillet itself probably worst tasting cuts meat town am normally huge fan fillets due tenderness   While adequately tender executed correctly just tasted such low quality found inedible   The star night however lobster would come again just this   believe maybe should sample some other seafood dishes eventually   many places town serving same thing am sure if anytime soon  <EOR> If missed Happy hours TC?
