Much larger expected good portion garlic fries side  taste expecting sandwich spot very fresh  All all fantastic experience hunt gather cafe  <EOR> Exceptional food  Frogs legs? Yum! corn chowder super tasty sangria  friend Cubano said awesome  carnitas torta  Also very good  think just missing tangy sauce accent meat  Maybe flavored aioli instead just mayo fresh made salsa  Garlic fries good would've liked bit more garlic  Overall really great hidden gem  Eclectic menu very high quality  Would try brunch sometime  <EOR> This first time eating here  Cuban sandwich best town  tried venison tacos absolutely amazing! If you're looking good food different everything else being served town come check place out  going regular stops now  <EOR> Places rare Vegas     Small restaurant delicious variety dishes    Cuban amazing    Cajun chicken Alfredo buttery creamy!!!  try spinach dip  <EOR> Nice new place dine  Friendly folk LOCAL business come support them  should finished review off couple months ago  hummus great food very good quality  <EOR> We saw all great reviews Yelp decided try since finding decent place close home would fantastic!  Well good   great but bad  Now breakdown Ambiance   really isn't any  Nothing walls but some color couple tvs showing same sports channel  No moose head despite someone else posted  single poster print etc  Seats comfy enough choice nobody else when arrived 8ish Monday night    Our server great   cheerful prompt friendly no issues there   Prices good ate appetizer two meals $40   Now main event food since  restaurant First ordered drinks   Sangria hubby Pepsi me  Hubby said Sangria fantastic  tell Pepsi just good Coke but do? Then appetizer shrimp cocktail  Only   wasn't shrimp cocktail more shrimp ceviche without any acidity barely watery taste cocktail sauce  kept trying doctor stuff hand limes salt pepper   best could meh edible   #1 reason lack points  If would increase cocktail sauce then perhaps could forgive chopped shrimp   but waste money calories   Then entrees     Hubby Guinness Pork Carnitas   amazingly juicy tender pork served mass quantities but only 3 small tortillas   ratios way off  tasted good   I shrimp tacos   came two those small tortillas covered monster amount same chopped shrimp appetizer only different seasonings small amount spiciness which thought just right small wedge avocado each  removing half shrimp could almost fit hand  good but needed something   Oh know   perhaps mango salsa listed menu but never served? knows might made difference   Overall okay  We'd willing eat again but won't rushing back  <EOR> Amazing sangria!! Homemade tortillas which remind grandma Mexico  shrimp tacos fresh spicy! <EOR> Ohhh K yes am little loose throwing 5 Star rating but when something good experience going everything deserve!!! Fast Friendly service equally amazing food taste presentation! Keep GOOD Work!!!! Bambi burger fantastic would thought Bambi Arnold Green Acres could such great combo! <EOR> This cool joint around year half would know for        yelp     Located complex cool part town thought familiar given name  I thought going into lodge style feel sort establishment   case!  almost lucha meets Alaska sort vibe   again   I confused   WTF PW talking about?!
