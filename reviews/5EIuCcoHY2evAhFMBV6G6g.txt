kind nicoisse very tasty   steak brought better filet mignon cuts delicious sauce   desert some sort pastry forget but recall eating all enjoyed lot   comfortable almost ended late show but seated plenty time    The place aeshetic dark wood panelling over top but nice enough casino   top line but worth wearing something better blue jeans over   All all I'd say great date night destination pricing good  <EOR> This might very well best restaurant ever to   I wedding party impressed service delicious food relatively affordable prices back next night   Our server woman named Kathy  She attentive without hovering explained favorite dishes well knowledgeable food  hardly ever impressed restaurant service   The prices steep compared usually am willing shell food but most reasonably priced steakhouses strip food better several more expensive places visited   We'd particularly bad experience night before came over Mario Battali's B B concerned all restaurants Venetian might operate similarly  very wrong surprise   I wish place closer could special occasion place visit regularly   You check least once while you're Vegas  though you'll probably least twice  <EOR> Here

special   Barramundi overcooked   Rabbit Duck off menu Saturday around 9pm Note bartender Kir Royale does require sugar   Champagne Cocktail   horrified taste sweetness end    Other dishes ok to pretty good   No wow dishes   Nice enough room   Server nice guy very casual probably very experienced but order several areas messed up   Don't afraid write things down      We sat bit Siberia but sense anywhere else wouldn't changed overall experience much   Probably wouldn't return  <EOR> I literally tried almost every restaurant Venetian Palazzo   because love it   but just hate walking another hotel when just conveniently downstairs me   feet thank too     Anyways sadly enough   weekend place isn't full doesn't really full   think jig up   people know place isn't great   There some things good here   but unfortunately steak them   steak seemed poor quality one    overcooked   sad since place supposed French steakhouse   Garlic fries weren't all either    okay   guess can't fries good   thought mussels delicious though   better ones Bouchon   Oh   did Pinot Grigio also ordered   But bad sign when main course isn't good   ribeye just blegh    very big dissapointment considering much was   top spinach mushrooms   those decent   But come on   good you're known for   The service good though   Waiter very accomodating   able take potatoes off sides instead just give more spinach mushrooms  <EOR> I fortunate good experience here   just walking stumbled upon lunch menu decided some french cuisine   most professed Escargot stellar   definitely favorite form preparation but also appetizer   Lobster Bisque start sopped bottom bowl bread very good   entree Striped Bass Prosciutto potato hash lemon beurre blanc   cooked perfectly   competes flavor texture favorite RM Seafood   Delicate flavor skin almost crunchy chip without being overcooked charred   excellent execution   loved Prosciutto Potato Hash much sad when gone   Thank multitasking bartender provided such excellent service   emotional  <EOR> Nice service pretty good food   didn't review wine list but very nice selection top shelf bourbons tickle even fancy Woodford Reserve Bookers Bakers Makers several more    heirloom tomato salad pretty good but certainly anywhere near AOC's Los Angeles   Most people enjoyed meal no exception   would say however braised pork belly dry side really surprising when consider cut meat fats should kept nice moist falling apart   didn't try chocolate souffle myself but chocolate lover group rated highly   Overall nice place prices weren't bad probably near $75pp tip including couple top shelf cocktails  <EOR> I took mom when she town fabulous dinner   only server excellent but food delicious! mom ordered surf turf ordered filet   lobster filet cooked perfection   Would highly recommend restaurant! <EOR> Momma always said if don't anything nice say say nothing all       Unfortunately wouldn't tell whole lot why rated this  Maybe place closed when just being kind but lot people there  server very unattentive didn't seem being bothered  wine piece cork floating it  caesar salad over done anchovies couldn't taste anything but it  Which real shame because jamon serrano looked AWESOME   but ruined sauce  black cod would great if little bit more flavor didn't taste swum relay race olive oil     This place also rediculously expensive get    <EOR> After hearing decent reviews Pinot Brasserie's involvement Restaurant Week decided check lunch menu past Sunday   As approached hostess she asked if Restaurant Week which were gave seat inside  In retrospect wish asked seat 'outside' area could access pedestrian area   front room seated reminded someone's dining room   taking orders getting beverages hot bread rolls cold butter arrived few minutes later   Starter * Onion Soup Gratinee Baguette Gruyere cheese Husband both chose dish start since other options both salads   cheesy goodness Gruyere cheese really dish   Otherwise just onions bread broth   Entree * Croque Monsieur Ham Gruyere cheese Creme Fraiche initially ordered   But neighboring table order Linguini Pasta could smell wonderful garlic scent rising dish   immediately enchanted wished change order  Thank goodness before soup arrived waitress able change  * Linguini Pasta Mussels Littleneck Clams white wine broth When waiter placed dish front waited steam bath garlic envelope me   didn't   took big whiff could hardly smell any garlic   also looked bit less neighboring party's dish   Hmmm   As started separate mussels clams shells took bite pasta   Pretty heavy white wine broth much else final thoughts were   found myself putting pats butter into dish give more flavor   just okay something would order again   * Roasted Chicken Tarragon sherry jus Pinot Garlic Fries generous portion size lunch surprised Husband route since we're fond dry chicken problem   He really thought would different here   chicken laid bed mushrooms which heavy wine sauce   end chicken dry especially breast section  He learned lesson  side fries good although ask dipping sauce   Dessert * Chocolate Croissant Pudding Wild Turkey Sauce Unfortunately already dessert 1 pm   * Creme Brulee Burnt custard Dessert took awhile least worth waiting for   creme brulee very nicely here   large service area burnt sugary top nice texture taste satisfying dessert overall   Service decent nothing exceptional though   Things took lot longer felt necessary sure if because purposely want leisurely meal if just run slower   did notice everyone offered Restaurant Week lunch menu option which does wonder why  <EOR> great bread  comes fresh warm  caesar salad lobster bisque  soup could served hotter but still tasty  <EOR> This favorite restaurants town  Everyone friendly service great  cheese platter never disappoints  Chef Eric Lhuillier came meet wonderful  recommend everyone! <EOR> Outstanding lunch spot   Dinner slightly underwhelming   Another find crawl through Venetian trying avoid food court food while grinding day away     The lunch menu offers very good soups salads sandwiches   Smaller portions but delicious   classically French lobster bisque rich velvety delicious   Topped creme fraiche bits lobster just comforting classic    Escargot also good eats   Prepared usual way but brought life some fresh frisee tossed truffle vinaigrette   Finally charcuterie   Nice selection cured meats pate   Add some bread glass wine  Oh yeah  So sometimes drink when play poker no law against that    Only fault Croque monsieur   first glance nears classic perfection then bite and    creme fraiche?   putting mayo hamburger   Sorry Canadian friends   Dinner adds some excellent dishes but looses cafe feel   Standouts include seared foie outstanding mandarin orange relish vanilla sauce fantastic poached pear salad salty pungent goat cheese outstanding bouillabaisse   Every piece seafood cooked perfectly deeply flavored seafood broth   The wine list almost entirely French  Very well chosen good emphasis lesser growths regions   Very good offerings glass   Pours small prices high   Bottle pricing much better lower most Vegas   Service OK   slow times if large groups come in   Sit bar its all good   Recommended  <EOR> Excellent menu   all three courses awesome   food hot tasty want come back again   can't say same bar staff   definitely foodie hidden gem!!! <EOR> Arriving early told could take seat inside while table prepared   Sitting down bar area instantly glad I'd made reservation possibly busiest restaurant saw during whole trip Vegas average wait party 2 30 minutes!  approximately 5 minutes led table small two top edge main dining room thankfully somewhat isolated intensely loud interior restaurant   Greeted seemingly overworked server asked if wanted wine when declined she simply disappeared approximately ten minutes theme absence would recur frequently during meal    Eventually returning take order fill water glass spent plenty time browsing unique Cali French cuisine Chef Eric Lhuillier when asked regarding foie gras dinner menu told chef would glad prepare placing orders left wait again excessive amount time  Thankfully server's absence another young man took onus attend water glass while another well dressed server brought couple fantastic dinner rolls   Served small chunks cold unsalted butter rolls served piping hot oven great ratio crusty salted exterior soft airy interior actually buttery sweet adding table butter entirely unnecessary   Being sure overfill prior day limited myself only two pieces bread plenty water while waited    Arriving literally table across myself ordered eaten paid departed first dish indeed special request dinner menu while nothing special service meal dish continued theme quite exceptional food started rolls   Described Chaud froid seared foie gras Pickled pineapple heirloom radishes dish actually presented large pile artisan greens shredded radishes great snap pieces duck confit intermixed over top two medium sized lobes warm seared foie atop chunk incredibly tart yet savory pineapple   While clearly following formula balancing unctuous foie sweet components fruit adding greens texture actually loved preparation pickled pineapple manner which acid mingled foie   foie itself while good notably did couple small veins clearly would made cut higher end restaurant regardless item regularly prepared lunch quite nice    Finishing foie plate left table some time the table across still sat uncleaned well before main course arrived even delivery dish empty plate remained   Service issues aside food once again impressed time classic Croque Monsieur served crispy garlic frites small salad oil vinegar   usually fan fries say superb best I'd since those Bouchon Croque actually   Served gruyere crème fraiche opposed more traditional Mornay Bechamel sauce admit liked tang creme combination buttery brioche savory cheese well prepared ham made excellent sandwich good some but vastly better others something different norm    Happy food thus far knew dessert must just matter deciding one   balsamic strawberries apple tart tatin souffle many options but clearly bread pudding stated Chef Splichal's signature obvious choice   Beginning buttery rich croissant dish bound thick vanilla custard studded rich chunks dark chocolate forming pockets within admixture   Delicious its own square cake like pudding topped sweet strawberry accompanied small vessel buttery bourbon creme only served enhance sweetness dish while accenting subtle notes chocolate vanilla expertly   While fancy souffle definitely worthy signature dessert    Finishing another glass water paid bill nearly $50 lunch left modest tip   While fully admit bit choosy when comes service nothing worse chef's vision being compromised front house   While food wasn't amazing many places Vegas service could certainly stand take some lessons Keller's team Bouchon I'd consider return visit future if Vegas didn't many other great options   Blog full review w pics  <EOR> service ok   food just average worth price   appetizers mussells entre steak two desserts souflou bread pudding all disappointing   certainly won't back again  <EOR> Great food but kidding music?  much better restaurant radio station though ate less week ago can't remember ordered  <EOR>

Finally he offered free dessert delay which never happened    took couple bites really didn't it worth finishing   love celery but sure was   wrap so so best part being shoe string sweet potato fries served it   Maybe just ordered wrong things but sure much better lunch spots area  <EOR> Before dinner popped into La Cave maybe taste buds high fresh food but when dinner disappointed   The decor very typical nothing write home about  waitress didn't seem game evening forgetting specials things prepared menu everyday  Food just ok steak much better prepared one  <EOR> Went dinner Friday night 8 pm  The restaurant wasn't crowded seated right away  I read all bad reviews Pinot Brasserie bit worried but received excellent service only server but also rest crew!  I ordered french onion soup appetizer best ever had! wasn't salty packed lots flavor!  For entree ordered scallops had them cooked medium perfect!  came side lentils cooked ham bacon good but big fan lentils left most it   Husband ordered rib eye also cooked perfection   For dessert split creme brulee lacking vanilla bean taste   tasted more just eggs   Overall good experience! <EOR> Phantom pre show dinner!  This place pretty intimate setting small tables big spaces  Nice decorations placed around room staff extremely helpful   I really liked lobster bisque   If you're looking you'll keep your eyes peeled because walked twice before noticing girl podium front   basically only sign shows enter into something careful  <EOR> I loved restaurant! local don't find myself strip often but restaurant recommended friend thought would give shot  very impressed food received  duck guest fantastic steak both which delectable  mashed potatoes best green beans perfect!
