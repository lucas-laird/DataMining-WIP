So GF stayed Arizona Charlies Boulder last fall when decided head Vegas little early check into timeshare   Anyway long story short lucky enough find Charlies Cheesesteak Deli during stay!  I'm gonna keep short sweet  ordered chicken cheesesteak regular cheesesteak mushrooms peppers   They took 15 minutes which fine cause couple orders ahead us  think 7 8 bucks per sandwich both came fries   The ToGo containers came HUGE thought waste space    That is   until handed them felt heavy were! Well least hooked fries thought    When  back room popped them open surprise each container contained HUGE sandwich TONS meat ample toppings   Plus HEAPS fries     Now known appetite small army but believe when say could shared would enough food all fries   Personally thought meat could used TOUCH more salt but included salt packets ToGo bag i'm guessing fries!    BooYa!   Anyway guess didn't keep short  place solid casino food Boulder Hwy   One thing though   it's sorta hard find know tucked corner many casino dives   But well worth looking for! <EOR> Located inside Arizona Charlie's Hotel Casino off Boulder Highway first floor couple times during lunch  lots good choices  Ended getting Kick Ass Cheesesteak Sandwich both times   The Kick Ass Cheesesteak $7 79 Grilled onions bell peppers jalapenos topped off spicy cheddar cheese sauce  added mushrooms complete it    Measuring 8 inches pleasantly surprised tasty sandwich was  think use spicy cheese wiz exactly tastes    You your choice fries chips your side  Come now why would ever pick chips over fries? No brainer there  fries actually pretty good  Crispy greasy other places    As bonus if fountain drink They Pepsi products free refill  Ketchup comes standard your fries but if ask any more extra hot sauce ranch 54 cents   Hours 12 am 6 am 7 am midnight minds through Friday  7 am midnight Saturday Sunday    The only negative things need bring sometimes only person doing everything taking your order your payment cooking your order then calling your order  happened second time went  first time person counter second person cooking  Also sometimes inhaling second hand smoke patrons nearby playing slots  Don't forget still inside smoky casino   Yelp 2018 review #27 696 overall <EOR> Love place!  Cons 1 one person runs cash register grill  2  Waiting food usally 10 15 mins  3  family friendly on casino floor Pros 1  Food cheap but good quality! 2  Usally portions big enough another meal later  3  Made oder everytime  <EOR> I Charlie's Cheesesteak Deli 5 19 2017   4 people ahead ordering   took over 15 minutes before order taken   ordered Classic Cheesesteak which came fries $6 80 AC Players Card   appeared cooking order time   another 20 minutes before order   lot people waiting orders   people working did seem happy so  nothing special sandwich   fries 1 2 done threw most them away   would return eat again   Normally try find something good places eat because could effect places future business but If way doing business continues     Does future   advise those thinking eating AC Cheesesteak Deli rethink decision elsewhere  <EOR> This review more service then food  phillys awesome great value considering casino  However service terrible times  those poor girls don't try but seem frequently understaffed volume often working themselves hours  Other then constant staffing issues place gem  <EOR> What great value! Charlie's cheesesteak deli serves pretty wide variety sandwiches but let's honest   the cheesesteaks real reason come here! $6 99 gets cheesesteak fries drink extra better hungry because portions really generous  If wasn't really hungry meal really could split between two people  Oh don't forget present your player's card 10% discount! locals casino may tad rough around edges but restaurant values good definitely coming back  <EOR> The food great  Sometimes service little slow but everything made order  Sometimes even 'off menu' if you're nice   Hidden inside casino probably destination unless you're already here  But if want try highly recommend it  <EOR> Best place eat entire casino! staff friendly especially swing shift  They're fast professional even though might slammed sometimes  philly steaks delicious fill up! desserts might expensive but they're worth cheese cake <EOR> Food great  Customer service really okay cashier look chicken head other good place eat  <EOR> This place great  If looking giant 12 inch over flowing meat peppers onion cheesesteak    then it the fries tasty plentiful  help great  Can't say enough food  draw back chairs haven't cleaned  since put them restaurant  <EOR>
