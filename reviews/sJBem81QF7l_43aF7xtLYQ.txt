Eh shoulder shrug ?  just paid that? come mind when think crepe other day   This impulse buy area doing other business  recently good crepe experience Bacchanal Buffet Caesars Palace hoping even better crepe dedicated crepe location  Riding wave nostalgia recreate past experiences leave regrettable purchases   I ordered standard crepe bananas nuts nutella whipped cream  Did all those ingredients end plate some form? Yes  But such plain basic uninspired crepe  best way describe if someone made crepe home following basic recipe trying cheap frugal ingredients bought grocery store   The bananas just peeled cut put into crepe  nuts came resealable bag   When say nuts employee working could tell which specific nut using since chopped medley nuts kind would find snack isle gas station grocery store  Nutella drizzled crepe nothing special at point write review am wondering if even nutella just some generic chocolate hazelnut sauce especially saw next   Then put whipped cream top  Straight aerosol non dairy whipped cream printed it    It tasted expected previous ingredients mention respective quality  very dull regrettable experience None ingredients innovative unique none them transformed original state some items weren't even real    When crepe station dessert bar buffet uses fresh better ingredients better crepe bananas foster caramel sauce covered bananas candied almond granola chunks real cream dolloped crepes since metal bowl having actually whipped some point standalone crepe restaurant doing something wrong  wont coming back would recommend dessert crepes anyone  <EOR> The Crepe Station recommended friend recently  treated wife superb Crepe business  wife ordered breakfast Crepe cream cheese fresh strawberry fresh blueberry Crepe  both very good  two locations Las Vegas  visited Charleston Decatur  business small clean six tables  <EOR> Finally crepe place drive park Strip  Delicious generous portions  Clean friendly staff!  Looking forward going back another fabulous crepe! <EOR> Breakfast crepe lovely sauce would buy jar if could staff kind informative  <EOR> It's 11 days since little restaurant opened up!  Fun fact place originated owner's home locals would drive down house just orders in!   This place offers variety batters whole wheat classic red velvet sugar free!   I tried both red velvet crêpe classic crêpe   two crêpes stuffed strawberries bananas   finish off topped lechera sweet condensed milk powdered sugar whipped cream   flavor both batters magnificent but crêpes slightly chewy comparison traditional French crêpes   portions rather large which fantastic!  Overall I'd give them 4 5   The Americano hot coffee ordered very bitter slightly burnt taste   sure if machine's fault just bad quality beans   definitely ordering again recommend passing when given choice   The Chicken Pesto Panini nothing special   chicken very tender juicy must compliment restaurant that!  bread nicely toasted too!  pesto sauce lacked little seasoning which resulted just strong taste plain basil   taste little strong ended overpowering panini instead complimenting ingredients     If rate restaurant alone its crêpes which specialty would definitely 4 stars   If you're area would definitely recommend trying if you're craving something sweet!  staff extremely friendly too! <EOR> Loved crepes service first time here   Second time didn't realize didn't open til 9  Really? thought breakfast would main Crepe time?
