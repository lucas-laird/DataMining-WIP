Would defiantly eat again  sure would bring date though   actually coming back  <EOR> Freshly made pasta good  Lobster bique good everything menu delicious <EOR> Ate big family meal last night thinking best compromise option  turned much better Zefferini fancy fine dining option evening before which also happened Italian good    Granted Zefferini interested providing more authentic Italian cuisine while Brio clearly catered un discerning American audience but cares! Why?  Part positive experience waitress which always appreciated any establishment  Given description above would think she wouldn't know wine list right? Wrong  only did she qualitative descriptions Tuscan Chiantis but when she brought samples glass range another plus suggestion spot on! Winning Chianti selection San Fabiano Her recommendation non meat plate Mediterranean penne? also great choice  fresh sourdough bread made Zefferinis paltry store bought sliced broad baguette weep    And always huge warm smile    One last point back room which intimate quiet though could imagine main salon would quiet extremely noisy    In sum if you're looking good food off strip aren't trying crap shoot fine dining without star give Brio try  <EOR> I'm new yelp contraption but bear me  husband stop Apple Store decided grab dinner  Thursday no trouble being seated promptly  Hostesses kind seemed eager help us  chicken Milanese husband some sort seafood pasta cannot remember  Absolutely no complaints  chicken moist tender  Pasta perfectly cooked sauce balanced perfectly  Looking forward returning trying more items off menu!

Through restaurant? arm gesture wasn't exact  asked trying subtly convey Could walk there? but nope  guy just kept arm gesturing said sit patio   Fine  walk through restaurant exit door patio  see empty table sit down wait waiter  Five minutes later harried waiter comes asks if seated front  said no happy hour guy front just told sit patio  Apparently real tables meant people during happy hour couches fire pit designated happy hour  Uh mentioned time flat asked if waiter could show area  He did say area happy hour sucked  tables made some flimsy material some kind flexible wood? don't know chairs couches terrible eating on   The waiter said he didn't know which waiter going serve but he would find out  thought strange but didn't think much it  Again another thing should made just walk sister try another restaurant Town Square instead  He came back said he waiter entire time he just twitchy he didn't want serve us  guess because doing happy hour default happy hour customers' bills won't high someone just having dinner? Which stupid reason but kept leaning towards longer stayed Brio   I ordered vodka martini which reads menu Sobieski Vodka your way Dirty Dry Olive Twist  When ordered however waiter never gave option wanted martini  When served took sip nearly spat out  tasted terrible  If wasn't fact paid alcohol would just set aside but finished because paid wasn't going waste but definitely wasn't happy drinking something didn't like    As happy hour food ordered tomato margherita flatbread brio burger crispy cheese ravioli share between us  order took awhile when arrived burger cold chips top stale  dish thought sister would enjoy most because burger but she refused eat bite  Instead she ate most ravioli  flatbread okay just okay but something I'd want pay for   After disappointing meal happy hour sad hour asked waiter he passed check  wanted leave wash away disappointment  took awhile hand bill then took even longer return credit card  point disappointment slipped into frustration  Why heck would restaurant happy hour if don't want happy hour? Because  felt like  seating happy hour terrible staff terrible customer service certainly terrible whether short staffed don't act don't want because going happy hour expensive dinner prices   Brio Tuscan Grille place never again frankly always anti recommend people whenever possible  If could give place negative stars would  <EOR> One best dining experiences ever!!!!

Per other Yelper reviews Bruschetta Quartro!  Totally recommend! tried lobster pasta husband pork   Both excellent  The only reason gave 4 starts because ordered salads never them   However Geoff awesome took salads off bill provided free dessert <EOR> 4 stars? Yes 4 stars   3 seems low   Ideally 3 5 would rate it   few notches above Olive Garden Macaroni Grill even Maggiano's  While don't usually eat chain restaurants saving grace informal lunch meetings dinners unadventurous eaters satisfying group people various dietary preferences low carb low fat gluten free vegetarian      I highly recommend making reservations evening when party 6 more but lunch usually wait 10 15 minutes   give pager freedom occupy your wait time shopping nearby stores   Once inside setting pleasing Tuscan style energy noise level bustling but usually sit outside because usually nicely behaved dogs me  require tie dogs outside restaurant fence sit nearby table but seen dogs sit laps owners   discrepancy kind bothers because dogs well behaved but sit feet   many don't notice them but if because cute well behaved   Usually order flatbread bruschetta table appetizer  usually order steak salad lunch which phenominal especially since most places end making meat well done using tender meat  pasta decent least never heard guests complain usually give raves    portions generous price usually lasting two meals   steak vegetables dinner which prepared cooked nicely  Service always polite but sometimes little slow when busy  Again food no culinary feat but solid unoffensive   While unique no going complain your guests definitely think solid food come satisfied full     Again great place where everyone find something enjoy themselves casual relaxed Italian style   One other comment think done great job wine menu  glass plenty unique affordable wines covering range varietals both whites reds but also many familiar easy drinking wines   Further many gem bottle well priced   about 175% markup rather 200%+ markups   that mean atleast $10 20 savings per bottle  <EOR> Our friends suggested Brio dinner night   bookmarked since started yelping course wanted go!  The dining area elegant   loved decor   dine outside but chose inside   Service impeccable   waitress outstanding   She gave great suggestions meal     We started off sharing spinach dip   Creamy full flavor   I'd definitely order again   entree ordered grilled salmon fresca  perfectly grilled asparagus sweet potatoes spinach red peppers topped grilled salmon   loved vegetables   salmon little over cooked but bad overall   Dessert? course! offer little dessert shooters   tried chocolate caramel cake shooter   Oh yeah     I'd again   friends ordered dessert sampler including creme brûlée bread pudding cheesecake   Absolutely delicious!   I believe Brio better choices Town Square area   hope back soon! <EOR> Went Brio lunch  very impressed meal especially seeing check  interior nice waiter great but food honestly subpar  <EOR> I love walking into place automatically feel better  aromas extra hungry dark lighting just right food always great   I haven't anything didn't enjoy whenever bring people over first timers become instant fans  also need mention fantastic happy hour even though didn't participate particular visit  Some favorite items are balsamic strawberry salad lobster bisque margherita flat bread   The service also great every visit highly recommend place  Outdoor dining also must nice days evenings  <EOR> What hidden gem Town Square!
