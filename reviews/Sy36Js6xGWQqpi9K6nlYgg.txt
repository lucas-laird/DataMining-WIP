Wierd  <EOR> STAY AWAY!! If your looking fun good tasting japanese place place  wasted much money here  expecting nice dinner family very dissapointed!  The place empty so hard find hotel waaayyyy over priced sushi gross fresh the chicken teriaki tasted thawed freezer the salmon over cooked hair food miso soup tempura ok  Dont waste your time money please!! <EOR> Overall disappointing   While huge umbrella drinks good edamame wilted use long grain rice rolls nigiri!  I'd never seen before but affected taste made hard handle   Selection rolls somewhat small too  <EOR> Was rolls crowd just fine  Good sized rolls price tasty   Leaves tea waitresses kimonos speak Japanese   Solid value Flamingo  <EOR> Located Flamingo hotel place does good sushi   only people sitting bar wife couple guys seemed Vegas business   Everyone else enjoying teppan   Maybe should first indicator     Mediocre sushi   But expensive   Yes everything Vegas expensive but its usually justifiable some reason   much   salmon sashimi good but tuna   caterpillar roll ok   just wasn't all fresh  <EOR> I've better less   am fan Teppan grills where chose eat   Good Service  The cook  The other 2 folks table   Not good salad limp dressing sweet  The piece gristle meat hard cut chop sticks  I thought tad pricey  Very hard find until understand map telling another level   Every thing else dinner just OK   $70 tip would more just OK  <EOR> It took 15 minutes find place Flaming O  Despite fact give 3 stars am forever grateful took effort find it  downstairs back near valet entrance nail salon something that  4 ate teppan grill roll two  Rolls good great  only people entire place  bit    odd  decor ok but felt eating basement I guess because were  Anyway food extraordinary  chef head chef Tsutomu Molde  He incredibly personable very skilled teppan  food some best ever teppan  Here's deal though Tsutomu since left opened own restaurant Musashi just off strip  All skill talent personality now gone Hamada  visit Musashi regularly now  He made sauces own recipes cooked master  Would ever revisit location? NO  would elsewhere  cannot believe even open still he left  bar losing liquor license  Prices way high even when good chef there  <EOR> So Vegas just night mon bro mom decided sushi  yelped couple spots walking distance picked food good spectacular  service lacking would nice if could new spot but its not  <EOR> I recently ate dinner Hamada Japan  food itself good but point average tab $25 per person Flamingo's website states  If order off teppan grill menu entrees cost more $80  Very deceiving!  Anyway now know feel free eat here  bad place eat  only ordered sushi which decent  best ever but OK   Another thing note place doesn't full bar beer wine only  Annoying! WTF!?!? thought Vegas! full bar?!?!  Service OK  little slow  hibachi guys really great entertaining    Honestly don't know if would again  feel many better restaurants Vegas  <EOR> Never again   Late night post show 10pm so  Fond memories of long ago yen some fresh lighter fare led Hamada mix sushi teppan grilling old standards a strong desire fried rice shared companion    Walk in  Reverie broken    The teppan grills turned off  asked quiet spot two instead tucked next large group another small group 3 4  No sushi no fried rice   What the   ?  Short bitter The broiled mackerel ordered wasn't broiled much destroyed some sort hot firey mass anti food matter  flavorless dry even suitable hockey season   The grilled teriyaki steak he ordered OK doused sauce but ultimately cooked OK if slightly overdone  sauce meant hide fact fact grilled  looked steamed if bit odd texture   No fried rice because grills turned off    can't cook some kitchen rest hot food? No sushi either  Because why    grills off?   Question If can't serve menu don't offer special late night menu if can't cook properly which offer    why stay open?  The sake low grade bitter  drank mask taste or lack thereof food  service nonexistent food horrendous atmosphere dingy left behind bit sad   My fish supposed appetizer  steak entree  shared sake  $50?! Seriously?  Much rest Flamingo experience http www yelp com biz flamingo las vegas las vegas 2#hrid Y3gKnYNn1lYCCR8FpSoT_w if could give 0 stars would  <EOR> Ehhh passable sushi Japanese food  watered down quality taste American tourist crowd   tastes previously frozen sushi found restaurant midwest sushi standards depressed because clientelle just doesn't know difference   ordered some sushi which dinner only donburi both tasted something would mall   just expected something better guess but they're located Flamingo Hotel should expected it   wouldn't come back there's many more better places area  <EOR> The fact could barely find FLAMINGO should set sensors  eh pretty much sums up  couple pieces wouldn't even try  browning ting   i swear! BF said good esp  fresh toro  but somethings convinced catch worms funky sushi high there    Standard rolls don't expect things wabo kaboom whatever  Its safe regular stuff  tofu appetizer worth skip  its deep fried floating broth dish  in  poke few times chopsticks watch oil float top  ew    Just LOT hot sake beer all good  <EOR>
