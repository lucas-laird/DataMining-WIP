Cold old French fries paid value meal receive half fries chicken sandwich hard cold  no line no wait army employees working no excuse take customers money give them old food  felt o relieve left overs whole day long purchase  <EOR> Worst Wendy's waiting 10mins mic 20 mins window only reason waiting because doing laundry next door <EOR> Visited location today accident messed face  Jayson graciously took order without bringing attention injuries  He such sweet demeanor made first outing comfortable experience   lunch peaceful one  Thanks Jayson!! 4 $4 great deal too  Decent amount food well worth money  <EOR> Their slow af everytime drive thru always wait 5 15 mins just burgers <EOR> They finally brought back Jalapeno Fresco Spicy Chicken sandwich   missing since last year glad enjoy again   chicken sandwich spicy cheese also spicy add jalapenos   love spicy food absolutely amazingly good    Service pretty fast friendly am always satisfied customer   Hope let sandwich stick around minute enjoy again  <EOR> I love Wendys   Food hot fresh staff nice no complaints   Hit spot happy  <EOR> This location okay but most time when come food sometimes fresh sometimes hit miss all though negative customer service good times ive come best your food fast possible  <EOR> The person cash register friendly he knew he doing but unfortunately only cash register store  wait line 15 minutes just place order though once ordered food came quickly  burger above average fast food places  <EOR> The manager nice but  only redeeming factor place  came family 7 relatively normal order  few sandwiches some fries some chili 2 salads  If small order they'll fine but didn't anything right order  sandwich which just cheeseburger came bun hard brick some black stuff wanted pass bacon  finally took care but only 15 minutes waiting  Feel free come if small order but otherwise stay away  <EOR> Not sure why even says clear day window they're open until 1am because third time brother pulled drive thru no answers  happened around 11p even 12a well  evening could see 2 employees just standing behind dining room cashiers counter phones same guy every time since same car parking lot  Evidently night time wrong time want Wendy's location  <EOR> The employees Wendy's magicians They magically take same order lunch dinner five days straight taco salad every order something missing  whether chips day  salsa same evening  doesn't matter day time never order correct magically something disappear      Is training lacking   people just care? <EOR> So Wendy's usually provides terrible customer service well quality food  Hence probably why haven't many reviews particular one  visited couple weeks ago order co workers well  When asked fries fresh attitude girl taking order all because requested fresh ones  chicken nuggets value menu joke even question if actually 100% chicken advertise  Generally stay away fast food avoid  all above reasons  <EOR> This possibly worst Wendy's ever to  ordered 4 jr bacon cheeseburgers fries 2 drinks    We roll window pay food checked bag sure everything there  noticed fries missing told them  cashier said didn't pay fries sat stared  then replied well please order some fries? which she replied pay  Which  obviously knew that    We then pull away decided check burgers realized gave some wack cheeseburgers no consistency  Some pickles some didn't thrown together   We looked receipt didn't even just no hope order  paid $15 those 4 sandwiches 2 drinks  <EOR> Do come if want acknowledged served any way unless drive through where theory must move along   I waiting line behind person took five minutes place order then person counter proceeded ignore another five minutes she fumbled behind counter dropping utinsils floor then cups floor never quite accomplishing anything completely ignoring until five minutes bumping into other employees dropping things she held finger said second   I said ten minutes waiting   She said know we're busy said there's no else besides   She said taking care drive through said ok   took good look she looked acted high  decided didn't want someone high taking order left   <EOR> I ordered Dave's Double  bit into patty crunchy  little specks ground bone patty  Absolutely worst  brought counter replaced it  won't going back  <EOR> Lizette nice    wasn't sure wanted she helpful    back first time here <EOR> The only reason particular Wendy's because close home  order wrong food bad  ordered two Frosties thinking  50 advertised  Nope charged full price  operate restaurant way want even if Wendy's advertising specials nationally ALL Wendy's Wendy's does offer all items menu  never apology Management poor service  don't care customers  <EOR> Food normal wendys  expect  sort of  Customer service absolute crap even repeating order 3 times drive then another two times first window where take your money would expect order would right  course wasn't  stayed pickup window hoping someone would open window noticed order correct  course not! Instead knock window several times finally manager came asked order said oh we're really sorry good day  No offer fix no offer check wrong park walk inside corrected  took another 15 minutes  <EOR> Chubby lady really rude drive thru when came back when missed order didn't give Frosty  She pretty much shoved Frosty onto hand fuck off look attitude  Food horrible cold very stale give dog  <EOR> I don't know why keep coming staff rude can't order right save lives  Food basically thrown window word said   <EOR> Go ANY other Wendy's   people care   Order wrong everything   Very young uncaring rude staff   many other options won't going again   also didn't tell total give receipt checking bank debit transaction   Use caution  <EOR> I'm fast food burger guy all   17 years since actually ate Big Mac least 4 years since dining Wendy's   But coupon mail new Hot 'N Juicy the jokes could start endless!! burger some pleading wife   I did read article Wendy's executives scoured country top burgers spent thousands dollars research considered best effort year trials   definitely curious   We did drive thru ate car since wife wearing Batgirl costume Yelp Justice League Pub Crawl Fremont    coupon free single patty Hot 'N Juicy purchase small drink small fries   bill appropriately 2 orders totaled $6 66!  The verdict bad but great either   If Wendy's menu most likely enjoy this   would prefer Whopper if am blowing massive amounts calories fat fast food joint  <EOR> Disgrace burger taste just looks! No tomato no lettuce nothing hardly tasted mushrooms cheese onion rings over saggy! If time would money back burger just inappropriate! <EOR> Stopped lunch today mistake!  because food bad wasn't   never seen case heard group employees constantly arguing among themselves   ridiculous! <EOR> Will going back location anytime soon  Would defiantly stop McDonald's Burger King Carl's Jr  before going there  through drive when busy all  only car behind lady handing food such rush  always ask 2 extra barbecue sauces when meal  only reason choose Wendy's over McDonald's because love barbecue sauce  lady told could only even offered pay extra sauce  She said sorry don't sell extra sauce  really serious stingy sauce  can't even pay sauce??? only when eat fry's nuggets when dip every single sauce  disappointed  <EOR> One star because fast service however Stephen very rude while taking order via drive thru tone inappropriate he lacks customer service skills he kept repeating all? every item ordered  asked jr bacon cheese burger combo instead saying don't offer combo but u order drink fries? He said combo ! didn't greet nor thank window when paid apparently don't appreciate theirs jobs lack customer service training  <EOR>
