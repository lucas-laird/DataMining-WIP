Warm Christmas chips table mild medium house made salsa  Pork adovada fall apart rich saucy  Guacamole bright green take its traditional cilantro salty laden mix  Posole thicker more stew but nevertheless tasty  Tamales enchiladas decent but everything standout sauces  green sauce hasn't blended chunks chile red sauce smooth developed spice without being burn mouth hot quite frankly   addicting!  Sopapillas airy fresh greasy   Best fried ice cream outside still warm extra crispy while ice cream *gasp* still cold!   I'm nor New Mexico  But enjoying Mexican cuisine 20 years consider myself motivated foodie different refreshing spin highly recommend! <EOR> Service great! Easy find 15 min  off strip  This food best New Mexican style food outside NM  Both owners grew Albuquerque share love cuisine shows  If spicy Love Green Chile place  They import Hatch Chile menu perfect  Sopapilla's perfect  Hot plenty honey sweeten deal  Not every body handle heat but if New Mexican food want place  We back!!!!! <EOR> Having grown New Mexico     expectation high reading yelp reviews  food extremely bland red chile entirely thick  consistency eating mouth full flour  enjoy Carlito's    ordered Carne Adovada    <EOR> Finally!!!!  restaurant Las Vegas serves wonderful Hatch chile true New Mexican food   talking bland stuff many Mexican eateries town   huge difference   first bite transformed back Santa Fe Taos Albuquerque etc     heat red green chile amazing fresh flavorful for faint heart option mild chile    stacked cheese enchiladas both red green chile topped fried egg so good refried beans rice      My husband stuffed chile rellenos which he always loved New Mexico   both heaven oh sopas just substantial yet fluffy   dessert shared fried ice cream which did disappoint   My husband Chile Addiction early dinner yesterday high hopes   food service surpassed expectations   owner servers most gracious wanting please   ambiance decor also nice surprise   couldn't believe actually found gem   am sure extended family become regulars   <EOR> Growing New Mexico skeptical place would authentically New Mexican   But pleasantly surprised!  food amazing here!  Highly recommend! <EOR> Was excited another option New Mexican style food   decor lovely server friendly but very attentive   Ticket times ran 25 minutes only guest table   food no flavor simply put unseasoned green chile over top food which cold   Sopas best part meal chile rellenos mostly breading   adobada good flavor but brought table cold   Margarita did seem tequilla think use wine instead  <EOR> I made second visit Chile Addiction last night drawn place visit due Hatch Green Chile Roast event Sept  9 11  Facebook event page stated quote food drink specials entertainment more  no food drink specials happy hour according server quoted owner no entertainment what's more when nothing else going but people roasting chiles outside could purchase! Green chile already listed part event couldn't more! server assisted times owner even 2 them service slow less desirable  Food simple looked thrown together plates  ground beef chimichanga just ok  pinto beans bland cooked all way  rice ok  nachos hot mess unwarmed chips nacho cheese sauce lumps refried beans  think more half plate left  If wasn't company experience would total disaster  event planner but certainly know when event poorly planned  If just 'hey we're roasting selling chiles' event then just say don't lie say there's food drink specials entertainment just try draw people your restaurant   gonna piss people off  only half issue  Then people and several others join occasion between disappointing service food lack truth event description then puts bad taste your mouth  think I'd rather take 8 hour drive Albuquerque just authentic dinner  sure if owner full charge event Facebook posting but when mentioned post server kind just blew off  just means don't care probably just trying attract business  first time restaurant maybe 1 table people also dining attention owner server  Indian Taco good amazing service better  Just sure between happened now versus months ago there's really any need back  Oh didn't want but person works reminded 'Magda' movie 'Something Mary!' necessarily tan referring but nervous fast moves all over place kind mannerisms  sure if Red Bull written all over it  Personally think need refocus before another restaurant becomes history  trying sound mean nasty nor want them away but without focus customers you're putting into media tables only going downhill all blood sweat tears going nothing  <EOR> Love eat Chile Addiction cheat days!!! Friendly staff clean environment tasty food!!!Thumbs up <EOR> Two stars because if you're going New Mexican cuisine better good  Southwest expect better this   I burger because LOVE green chile cheeseburgers    The Good meat flavorful good size  Cheese melts  Bread better regular bun when give order burger restaurant  Spicy    The Bad fries really sad looking flavorless undercooked  Guacamole meh  Salsa tastes stores bought salsa few chopped chiles thrown in  Beans definitely came can   I would enjoyed meal much better if only ate burger  pretty good  4 2 5  Everything else underwhelming dragged entire experience way down  <EOR> The enchiladas de carne asada amazing sopapillas just good  wife red chile pozole she loved it  All all place delicious can't prices such quality! <EOR> I am New Mexico food amazing  being back home  Excellent food different fire rated red green sauces something every pallate  can't find sopapillas very much any more most places if all  staff very friendly attentive   won't disappointed  <EOR> This place rocks! new favorite Mexican spot!

Needless say delivery took while when driver called tell where he explaining  where he abruptly hung me  outside saw ways down road    waved over he approached door he dropped bag    could hear smash     just stood disbelief  But hey    happens? food am anticipating damage sure enough    everything crushed into giant shapeless mash  chicken taco wasn't broken due food drop but because soggy mush   rolled enchilada also bit underwhelming  Bittersweet     food flavorful    but presentation general care product huge disappointment  would definitely enjoy food better if ate in house  <EOR> Food great! Started fresh guacamole needed little salt but once added table perfect  chile rellano green chile hubby chicken tamales stacked green chile both very good good portion size  Only downside service slow  because inept but because busy hadn't expected huge increase business   am sure hire more staff because don't see them slowing down  <EOR> Honest company ownership strives quality  Definitely taste home unique Las Vegas  <EOR> gonna hurt more gonna hurt you  Having grown Albuquerque Santa Fe having true love New Mexican cuisine well knowing cook New Mexican cuisine imagine absolute delight someone decided open New Mexican food restaurant Vegas apart Carlitos Burritos  Which way SMASH hit 5 STAR place   Nevada Governor's fave place visit when town know when he said himself but digress    1 star having huevos open such restaurant  2 stars beautiful Southwest décor complete RC Gorman print wall      Regretfully where leave it     Service miserable   crowded afternoon AARP toddler hour    Took FOREVER seat more enough open seats   Once seated counted 18 minutes until someone came table   husband flag someone down   basics people     Once did order eternity actually food     Carne Adovada super dry worth third bite   pork chile verde loaded large potatoes no hatch green chile spice all piece pork   Really?    My husband disappointed   seriously no words level gross     Too bad would huge hit family better  <EOR> My family originally New Mexico grew stacked enchiladas sopaipillas posole  When heard Chile Addiction opened southwest side town excited give them try    I thoroughly impressed food service  impressed ended coming back once but two more times   I tried stacked enchiladas pork verde posole stuffed enchiladas pork verde chile adovado huevos rancheros sopaipillas tamales breakfast burrito churros fried ice cream  Every single thing tried great definitely nostalgia factor going it   The service beyond wonderful  servers owners friendly welcoming sure refills plentiful  They've even offered free dessert apology food taking long  funny thing didn't even notice delay but insisted order dessert them   I plan making regular spot hope others take time experience regional cuisine holds special place heart  Just skip desserts good  <EOR> Born raised Colorado missed green chile!  restaurant first found Vegas uses Hatch green chiles New Mexico green chile  Takes back Colorado green chile grew on!  even hot xxx hot!
