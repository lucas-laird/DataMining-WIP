Fun place definitely sharing gem friends family  <EOR> I stopped ordered filet medium rare  steak cooked properly but almost no flavor  no pepper rub anything give steak any kick  realize filet very mild flavor but beyond mild more bland  small ramekin served along steak thought Oh maybe nice chimichurri add some tastiness steak   disappointed learn sauce served A1  Perhaps am bit discriminating steaks but think A1 nothing more overrated ketchup  Normally when server asks if need any steak sauce think myself If needs steak sauce then sending back  surprised see A1 served filet  service top notch all staff extremely friendly helpful  excellent service however could mediocre steak  Seriously Outback Steakhouse better filet same $30 price Outback least includes sides  Michael T's steaks served la carte traditional steak dinner cost $50 per person  price overly expensive but again quality food commensurate its cost  decor nice people friendly but won't dining Michael T's future  <EOR> This place good  But confusing    hopefully explain why  groupon decided check evening  groupon two steak dinners house salad share grilled veggies loaded baked potatoes bottle white red slice cheesecake share    Being foodies decided also try appetizer tapas  chose fried pickles bacon wrapped dates  fried pickles less satisfying  whole spears very pancake y batter little flavor seemed bit undercooked  way terrible   but would pass them next time  bacon wrapped dates however fantastic!  Absolutely give try!  Next came salad which very good    Spring mix wedge tomatoes beets house vinaigrette  vinaigrette could tossed salad little better majority lost bottom  However said   quite enjoyed it    The main course came let tell you   steaks perfect!  both ordered mid rare did disappoint bit  Great flavor great charring just honestly great overall  accompanying sides fantastic well   The slice cheesecake next  generous size very good  could done without cloying strawberry sauce however  But nice sliced strawberries light fresh whipped cream welcomed    Now ambiance  was    confusing  brand new place forgive know growing pains  Anyway just weren't sure place trying be  formal steakhouse nice upscale restaurant bar grill  service exceptional wine presented opened table side  waiter very attentive took care needs quickly efficiently  Now made confusing was    water glasses plastic coca cola glasses  Which perfectly fine but confusing service didn't really suggest casual dining experience  Also choice music restaurant again   didn't scream upscale more casual dining  guess possible waiter just took job VERY seriously wanted give best possible experience which he certainly did    Overall wouldn't first choice bite eat live clear across town  But would love try some other things menu I'd also love when dueling pianos playing   sure  fun time    We did stop into bar quick $10 keno poker   but didn't order any drinks  completely closed off restaurant smoking allowed there    I wish place best think recipe success if basing food service  Even if some minor identity problems  <EOR> was golden knights game blast  very busy place  found happy hour ordered quite bit food took most home  food took 20 minutes server apologizing but being business completely understood  food delicious everyone nice  back sure!!!
