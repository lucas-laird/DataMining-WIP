Cool atmosphere good scene   Food very good but off charts   server only fair didn't seem terribly interested serving right start   Wine list impressive but wine grossly overpriced  <EOR> I visited N9NE steakhouse 5 friends while Vegas friend's bachelorette party  Saturday night made 7pm reservations  little late restaurant nice accommodate us  Once arrived sat right away  server Adrianne she made experience exceed all expectations  She very attentive made feel number priority  She asked celebrating while Vegas once she found friend getting married she made sure dinner true celebration rounds delicious mixed shots complementary cupcakes all us   For dinner lobster filet mignon dish which exceptional  filet mignon best ever lobster delicious  cocktail server recommended which really good  Even cupcakes delicious  Overall pretty expensive but well worth price delicious food well made drinks excellent service   If visit N9NE steak house sure ask Adrianne  disappointed  <EOR> This second time N9ne steakhouse didn't disappoint  happy decided turn music down bit actually conversation people table  music good mix 80's current  atmosphere very modern lighting good   We started off prawn cocktail calamari  prawns delicious calamari 10  usually don't care calamari because tends rubbery but calamari soft cooked perfectly  appetizers bone in ribeye steak fantastic  Cooked perfection served side skinny fries  Robert waiter couldn't better  Very attentive very knowledgeable  also ordered bottle Jordan wine but 10 minutes couldn't find any  gave better bottle wine same price  going deduct star little mishap but since better bottle wine star stays   Robert also entrance Ghostbar props  All all great meal great service  <EOR> Look let's quick   steaks pretty good rest while sounding absolutely amazing menu wasn't really anything write home about   'bad' just nothing special   If those people really enjoys crazy busy hip chic scene if I'd few more drinks then perhaps would enjoyed meal more   much sitting nightclub having dinner vs  having great dinner place which also nice barscene   two simply intermingled taste    As all comments prices whatever  Vegas steakhouse spent fortune place   yeah expensive   But should surprise anyone   If you're wanting see seen then think worse ways spend your money if you're simply looking fantastic meal where hold conversation then better places be  <EOR> I'm serching best steakhouse Vegas try new each month   If you're trying decide steakhouse check other reviews comparisons   rate them all based same criteria    N9ne twice now past few months back   first experience just OK but last outstanding   average 4 stars overall each part experience Decor = 5 stars based preference contemporary spaces   Bar experience = 4 stars attentive service attractive bartenders   Strong drinks but bit pricey $14 Crowd = 5 stars   Its well dressed young crowd older high rollers mixed in   Most people stop off way town night dressed accordingly   Overall food = 4 stars   bread fresh nice assortment   Sides exactly expected   Don't order surf turf though becasue lobster tail small isn't fresh   try lobster mashed potatoes though   The steak = 4 stars   first Porterhouse average   Well cooked but bit light flavor   second bone in rib eye which outstanding   Wine = 4 stars solid wine list   Affordable bottles sprinkled among notable high end wines notable vinatage cellar wines   Markup 40 50% expected   Service = 5 stars taste prefer approachable over stuffy   Servers friendly funny knowledgable honest   don't feel trying upsell   Trust recommendations food wine  also brought complimentary pot sticker appetizer start   Little things long way   The check = $125 per person steak side desert wine  Recommended  <EOR> I give three stars only because such fan place past  fact last time came back bragging all friends found best steak world  time much    least wasn't $65 worth    First off when ordered drinks bar cocktail waitress really didn't know scotch rum then she took 30 minutes bring drinks     I already mentioned steak which big let down   Then requested waiter ask chef grill asparagus waiter said no problem cook however like  But when he brought them grilled he back more    When he came back he served them steamed al dente  He said apparently just difficult chef  don't mean picky but prices think right  pasta al dente asparagus char broiled  <EOR> I've Vegas many times but never tried any numerous $$$$ restaurants city offer   time around buddy planned grub N9NE Steakhouse dinner   This usual steakhouse where quiet wooden furniture interior   course doesn't because Vegas restaurant Palms Casino   restaurant's decor very trendy would expect based location   some music bumping background everyone's conversation dimly lit neon lights accenting ceiling   I really enjoyed food   Maybe enjoyed food much because first meal day 7pm   knows but good   Skinny fries Forget getting one   things skinny but extremely anorexic   size headphone string   Shrooms mushroom lovers   Nice sized mushrooms lots flavor both mushrooms crab stuffing   George's creamed corn anyone loves corn rich   Garlic green beans only greens ordered which wasn't lot but good enough   They're very small garlic flavor overpowering   Bone in rib eye 24 oz pure meat   Perfect carnivore appetite   am starting think charring meat thing which place did   don't prefer but still good   meat tender juicy   almost finished entire thing but left oz    good was   This great meal

Others table ordered lamb chops chicken pasta bone aged steak well  Which all looked delicious  don't think any complaints Enjoy! <EOR> This great place delicious meal  only food great but atmosphere service well  I'd recommend making reservations    Atmosphere lot restaurants don't have  almost mix fine dining club type environment  food impeccable but can't expecting same atmosphere would other steakhouses such Lawry's  Instead almost walking into club  Music blaring people having fun   Service also spot on  very attentive needs without being over bearing  Some restaurants tend over service bothering every five minutes so  N9NE never ask anything just seemed magically know would need without having check every five minutes   They very extensive wine list server very knowledgeable helpful picking wines would like  I'd recommend getting bone rib eye  don't think ever steak great  don't even know explain except effin delicious    So next time money spare want great steak definitely N9NE  <EOR> Went few years ago friend's birthday dinner  surf n turf forever changed  dreamed going back place good  big seafood person surf part meal wasn't fav tasted lobster little chewy but  why really don't lobster  comes bed lobster mashed potatoes fav   The next time came back ended having place two days row once when treated friend birthday then next night again family  must say cheap but special occasions worth it  comped dessert both times both birthdays donuts serious crack needing rehab for  recommend getting wine sauce your steaks perfect touch  Service impeccable people excellent job  <EOR> Food amazing only reason didn't give 5 stars because customer service  first time blown away guy named ray think second time terrible hostesses server just bad  Both times surf turf  food just melt your mouth never want experience end  desserts didn't impress far taste both visits but presentation always point  hostess past time misplaced reservation somehow wait forever celebrating special occasion like called ahead specified    never recognized neither hostess obviously nor server even mentioning it  <EOR> Well worth money if hit big slot machines   steaks amazing!  Very tender perfectly seasoned   offer 40oz steak two but split 22 oz steak more enough us   ordered mushrooms asparagus sides   Amazing! <EOR> I walked into place unaware expensive but decided thinking quality food would justify price  asked server if red meat organic free range he said wasn't  no reason pay $38 non free range non organic meat meat should best quality  food nothing ordinary totally overpriced top off gave indigestion  recommend <EOR> Nice restaurant good servers food above average if area going concert Pearl some nice wines good dishes   actually liked much better before remodeled   Probably 3 5 nice service gets 4 instead 3 D <EOR> I wish rich then could dine places N9NE all time friends $800 dinners would typical meal IHOP something  Sadly rich but EXPERIENCE well worth money    I ordered 16 oz  NY Sirloin because part Best N9NE collection also thought 16 oz ' wasn't big I knew should paid more attention math class!   probably should listened all friends split 16 oz  NY Sirloin two other girlfriends because caused myself some serious pain trying finish alone and without success!     By way take note steak only comes leaf two tiny mushrooms stuck its stem everything else must ordered separately  really irked which why am giving N9NE five stars  paying could LEAST given scoop mashed potatoes something!   Anyhow summarize food taste quality excellent no complaints  girl friends seemed really enjoy salad which pretty basic simply made but scarfed all down rather quickly must good  $235 Best N9NE collection seemed worthy its price well menu says serves four but boyfriend two other guy friends girl friend could barely finish it! last but least decor very cool trendy music AWESOME    All all fun would definitely back again! <EOR> Considering all good reviews guessing messed wrong night???   My friend Monday Night probably where wrong none good chefs there?   Place looks really nice however food mediocore best  spending over $400 2 steaks appetizer few drinks food completely tasteless steaks overcooked  <EOR> After Palms Place compensated issue room friends decided splurge nice dinner NYE   N9NE Steakhouse located Palms Hotel first floor next registration desk  Walking instantly underground vibe restaurant  know secluded upscale establishment where businessmen mobsters gather  would feel place wearing anything less business casual   The mood festive  DJ spinning music could heard and felt coming next door  fairly loud but point making conversation difficult    However thing didn't quite understand  Given upscale nature restaurant TV's showing college football didn't really fit in  But then again most upscale restaurants don't DJ either   As food     The French Onion Soup  Best ever hands down  Lots delicious melted cheese caramelized onions tasty bread broth  No cheap ingredients here  serving generous split Dawn M   Organic Fire Chicken  Cooked perfection  Juicy tender meat served spicy ish glaze topped assortment jalapenos  meat tender arrived ideal temperature   Asparagus  Since most entrees la carte needed side chicken  asparagus  Nothing extraordinary maybe little mushy if anything   Salmon  don't eat seafood lame know   Dawn M  another friends claimed best they've ever   Strong words!  Overall wonderful meal  service professional overbearing  While food delicious still think little overpriced perhaps due NYE   Without even ordering steak wine bill totaled over $300 5 people   also fan charging $30 chicken including any sides  Anyway cost complaints aside enjoyed experience N9NE would consider returning another special occasion  <EOR> One best Lobster Bisque ever had  ordered Surf n' Turf Maine Lobterl Filet Mignon white truffle aioli red wine sauce   Very tasty perfectly cooked  Creamed Spinach   I cant remember ordered desert  remember having banana chocolate  <EOR> Great place dine! waiter everything waiter knowledgable courteous funny attentive without being overbearing center attention    The surf turf exquisite light truffle paired very nicely both buttery lobster tender filet    The lamb cooked perfection! medium suggested anything more overdone chops deserve better that!  I also very much enjoyed lobster ravioli! <EOR> The environment very modern sleek feels more club restaurant  being said food found very average price tag  surf turf very bland very little flavours  wine list isn't bad however during meal ended finding bug towards end if glass    My whole dining experience establishment reasonable poor food wasn't bad just ate better less Las Vegas area  would recommend restaurant neither would back! <EOR> I love place! Consistently bomb everything tried great  jalapeño potatoes shizz  Highly recommend  <EOR> We hit N9NE steakhouse Vegas over Palms  food amazing ordered 40 oz yeah read right rib eye  buddy split sucker destroyed it  meat real tender juicy  au jus all right but preferred eating meat its own  also fried shrimp appetizer which pretty good   The atmosphere N9NE pretty cool well  Although did seem kind dark there  around 6pm but understand gets more lively night on  <EOR> I always remember place   as am walking down steps following waitress table   I stumble steps end falling a** down stairs   Boy embarrassing! X  Great thing food extraordinary otherwise would never gone back that   meat amazing desert die for   smores desert absolutely fun delicious   highly recommend place   Pricey but worth it  <EOR> The food great  Delmonico which excellent  wife surf turf which she said delicious  tried lobster mash potatoes  wife thought great didn't think flavor lobster great but bad dish  ambiance more seafood restaurant steak house but cool none less  service extremely slow very attentive but polite  Overall good meal great experience  <EOR> Nice enough restaurant but something off decor   prices being $50 above expecting perfect ribeye but tough chewy   bit disappointing $60 steak   scallops tasty but only 3 sea scallops entree plate   Service excellent!  Overall okay experience  <EOR> To steak paradise!

We booked place early dinner business meeting  six sat down high sense optimism due successful meeting all expectations fine dinner  bill near $600 without bottle CDP   could far better experience elsewhere half cost   VENUE N9NE Palms Hotel west side freeway  ugly restaurant reflects all Las Vegas gaudy  noisy low fi but LOUD music selected maniac no way turned down though party six comprised half customers  supposedly high end restaurant wouldn't expect tablecloths? Proper silverware various dishes salads? Cleanliness? All lacking     FOOD Good bread nice appetizers excellent salads ok steaks  However judge steaks Deuce Peter Luger or Wolfgang's NYC  ordered $59 sirloin tasted wife's Barry's end prime rib certainly would rate above average restaurant fare  Mine ordered 'medium rare' but kitchen delivered steak more 'medium well'   $12 baked potato obviously prepared day before heated me  am omnivore among business associates did send back food  end meal decided try any $12 15 desserts   SERVICE How hate thee? Let count ways  Miserable  Lacking  Ignorant  Poorly trained  N9NE presents itself superior steakhouse prices suggest excellent dining experience managed competent waitstaff supervised trained experts  Absolutely not!   CONCLUSION N9NE pretentious restaurant overpriced food served incompetent staff  <EOR> Was business meeting private dining room  Dinner prix fixe menu however could any better   Started off ceaser salad which dressed perfectly large crunchy parmesan crouton crisp  Exactly it   Main course filet  Cooked absolute perfection  tender could almost cut steak fork  Normally thick filets come tough touch dry one  mouthwateringly good polished off whole thing  Sides Cream corn win mushrooms caramelized onions awesome flavor  bland imagined sautéed mushrooms would taste like  Desserts tray mini samplings cheesecake bites carrot cupcake appeared peanut butter cup  Let's just say eat wish more plate   Overall great atmosphere  modern hip feel  would return try other dishes <EOR> Manager sucked!!! Bad skunky over priced wine  Food ok  Took way long come   Place cool set though  Off list  Wouldn't back wouldn't recommend  many other pricey but great steakhouses exist ever stop again  <EOR> I came N9NE didn't even steak! did Kobe burger which probably best burgers life since started eating meat again   friend salmon clams some type sauce she said excellent well   also gave complimentary chicken eggrolls bread served warm herb butter all delicious   N9NE hip very trendy ambiance definitely back try steak next time! <EOR> Me significant other decided try something new Valentine's Day  must say definitely best steakhouse vegas thusfar!! customer service AMAZING made experience very enjoyable  Chef Barry Dakake even took some time shake hands greet together rest guests! ambience nice hip vegas nightlife  Valentine Prefix Meal blew away  shrimp popcorn delicious bone in ribeye melted butter! dessert nice touch fulfill palette's  definitely coming back recommending others!!!! <EOR> Love place always surf turf perfect !!!!

We shared ginormous 20 oz bone Ribeye fantastic very essence true dry aged steak    I also enjoyed 2010 Graff Riesling   My only disappointment server Lisa  She never really bothered check us  flag sevdral other staff menbers down refills accompaniments etc  only attempt engage check delivered even then only inquire whether enjoyed Riesling only WAY beyond late because already finished drinks entree's  Unacceptable  She complete disappointment downer should easily 5 star experience  give somewhat pass given lathargic attitude lack enthusiasm she probably still hung over New Year's Eve night before   or should say earlier wee hours same morning?

Amazing service friendly staff  Fast efficient good upbeat atmosphere steak point  <EOR> Since last weekend before Christmas Vegas Friday night seemed dead   surprise walked into restaurant 10pmish HAPPENING   table approximately 11 people celebrate birthday     The bread basket finger sized pretzels no salt but marinara type sauce   basket also came sugar coated donut hole like bread  tasted brioche based dough   Loved bread!  I shared ribeye two $89 medium rare cooked exactly way medium rare should  nice bloody   peppercorn sauce good but wasn't great   Maybe next time substitute different sauce the restaurant several sauces add additional cost    meat came side dish sides usually additional cost ranging $11 $14 which server allowed substitute lobster mash   Let's just say could've ate mash itself because yummy really filling   it chunks lobster but hoards just enuff   We brought own cake birthday boy but restaurant DID let slice eat cake restaurant   said liability other food served premises   did offer free dessert b day boy either   Desserts don't cost much since ordered plenty food already would think server would comp dessert  He did take all into Ghostbar free yippee do da but honest almost threw bloody ribeye seeing some ppl bar   left half hour because wasn't happening Ghostbar nite    So 11 ppl bill came approximately $1100+ including tax tip   believe each drink few appetizers mostly individual entrees some ppl decided share entree which seemed workout well   Something consider next time         The place pretty pricey but if wanna try place maybe share entree side you'll come bill  around $70ish two ppl without drinks   <EOR> We locals Prix Fixe wine pairing   Absolutely perfect every way!

 noticed table adjacent ours fawned over same waiter  table happened very beautiful woman apeared model a real one seated it  here's low down waited 15 minutes before waiter materialized take drink dinner order same time   When ordered steak told bring order each four steak sauces knew would both enjoy  He looked if insane which prompted inquire if sauces extremely large servings  He told should maybe scale back two sauces because 4$ each  Hmmm  spending hundreds dollars dinner he thinks few $4 sauces going break bank?  scaled back only sauce   pretty good peppercorn sauce which would enjoyed more but waiter disappeared when food delivered never saw again   Actually saw but he busy fawning over other nearby table notice might some more bread completely gone another drink the sangria very good anything else matter    Once again very good food but absolutely WORST SERVICE ever received anywhere Las Vegas   quite few restaurants there   going back   way many excellent steakhouses LV suffer through kind lack service  <EOR> I Wedge salad 8oz filet   Steak rivaled Ruth's Chris   Food service excellent although sure just Las Vegas thing but music little loud taste   Other I'd recommend back myself  <EOR> My wife same taste food   However thing agree if both pick only favorite meal ever would Surf n' Turf N9NE   eaten every time Vegas over past five years which means surf n' turf probably 15 20 times   consistently excellent 100% time never complaint   Also bonus tip before getting into review if plan any Palms' night clubs ask your server cover charge comp VIP entry definitely former save some money server always able latter but sure if  restaurant sure if should expect happen not   Okay very good experience server first time visited N9NE 2008 name Jeremy he still works there   highly recommend asking seated when visit   haven't able see every time gone but more often then have he's want say ten years now   any case won't disappointed he's very attentive detail your needs   Back food give experiences few appetizers but regarding entrees unfortunately can't offer any opinions anything else serve because all ever surf n' turf good enough lost interest trying other items first time ate there     Apps first ahi tuna tartare rock shrimp sashimi n9ne   All three excellent very fresh very tasty   shrimp quite large no complaints there   ahi tuna does give *that* much tuna three I'd say app trends towards being bit over priced   sashimi excellent selection several different types fish well caviar shrimp great share well   presentation excellent long rectangular plate everything arranged neatly display types fish without encroaching another   also receive complimentary bread varying types regular butter horseradish based spicy mustard awesome   Now entree time   surf n' turf differs others' few ways first foremost claw tail Maine just bits pieces tail meat gulf some previously frozen crap   lobster sits top filet which sits top lobster mashed potatoes then drizzled surrounded white aioli sauce   course parts held off combined if don't any those bits   personally ask put aioli side give 'sauce tray' which assortment four additional sauces menu but your server should able happen   going upload picture know looks like   believe port wine reduction mustard based sauce trends towards spicy other two seem change time time may seasonal regularly changed can't remember may may get   filet portion meal also great   order mine medium rare want see some pink if medium happy   wife orders she calls rare plus which she picked excellent Berns Steakhouse Tampa FL means rare warm red center rare cold time gets table   She's also picky this   They've never messed up   Can't say enough place   Drinks?

When party 10 arrived taken table almost immediately   off good start!  decor pretty nice chic contemporary just would expect hipper steakhouse   menu bit overwhelming much choose but easier when ruled non beef entrees we steakhouse all    While half table paired split Bone in Ribeye Two stuck going solo   but really wanted same thing where gf would handy    instead ordered 24oz Bone in Ribeye medium rare while getting lobster mashed potatoes split buddy   The potatoes pretty awesome probably favorite part meal   only could taste lobster but chunks dish too   Impressive compared past   steak knew going hefty though part weight tied bone but still surpassed expected   looked fantastic when brought though surface nice char grillmark it   wasn't lot fat hanging off meat but still juicy when cut into it   wish more tender but taste great   Although steak good most part did hang it   worked way towards center bone meat looked less medium rare more rare   When glanced over friend's steak compare them saw same problem   both debated sending plates back which don't typically do could fire bit more but figured wouldn't worth it   wasn't much meat left bone anyways rest table just done   Still would think higher end steakhouse should least able cook steaks more evenly that   Being all pretty full meal none any room dessert despite couple sounded rather enticing   whole restaurant pretty noisy but really liked chill yet trendy vibe   different steakhouse   Sadly uneven cooking downer   don't huge problem spending money pricier meal and place pricey but $60 could least cook better   I'd open coming back again but would rather try new spot Craftsteak first   If when come back again sure check meat before start eating  <EOR> I enjoyed birthday dinner 18th July  decor first thing catches your eye soon enter restaurant  decorated beautifully   hostess welcomed party inviting smile pleasant attitude promptly seated table  dinner excellent  highly recommend try lamb chops surf n turf steak  best steakhouses eaten at  <EOR> Put your shiniest shirt spiffiest shoes ready shell bones if you're headed N9NE   think steakhouse quite good found fillet delicious   lobster well but more sliver lobster   better yet sliver memory lobster once existed during prehistoric era   Welcome fine dining!

Anyone dropping kind money meal clearly eaten sit down restaurant before knows pay fucking bill   possible standard instruction but based tone am quite sure not   Also all times could possibly offend your customers why would close possible when decide much tip? <EOR> my boyfriend ate n9ne anniversary dinner  we're young poor didn't all but still nice filling meal  ordered 8 oz filet mignon bearnaise sauce they gave each 4 oz lobster mashed potatoes macaroni cheese  ordered steak medium rare literally melted mouth  very good steak! keen sauce though   lobster mashed potatoes good but nothing special  mac n cheese incredible made glad chose eat n9ne  recommend dipping steak into mac n cheese  only wish money blow more steak    service alright  two servers good refilling water glasses but seemed kinda annoyed didn't order much ask them bring bread three kinds which weren't very good   nice ambiance good food  just sure if food worth price given student budget  <EOR> Stopped bite before Bonnie Raitt concert  Used promotion Palms $25 off $75  Its easy spend $75 lucky hit happy hour money little further  good selection beers cocktails  ordered Relyx delicious and dangerous! husband ordered dogfish 90 minute  decided some oysters sliders rock shrimp calamari  All tasty but nothing very special sure would've paid full price bar food  bar nice full sat lounge  <EOR> AMAZING! year ago still dreaming it!
