Excellent place good food fast service plenty screens watch game  Prices affordable service prompt courteous  <EOR> Food good  Service slow  Large salads sandwiches  plentiful sides  Burger cook ed ordered  special sauce killer good  Peppery spicy alone but burger fantastic   Cuban sandwich large filling delicious  Brownie Ala mode enough two maybe three  Order dessert only if pressed time  Took over 30 min dessert menu order stated eating   take 1 hour entree another dessert  Hard into lunch hour  <EOR> They advertise specials bar but there's no such thing available! decided fish chips which certainly something box though claim beer battered own kitchen  Kudos bartender Amanda  willingness correct problem highlight visit there  <EOR> Well    second LAST time place    looking place lunch Luxor where gambled shopped today  2 20 pm Sunday  long Veterans day weekend  offered Hangover brunch menu which fine  ordered steak eggs dish sandwich husband  also ordered some coffee which came PAPER cup   !!! supposed place least step above McDonald's right? stunned because everything else much fancier nice glasses water atmosphere all   didn't want sound difficult anything just wanted regular coffee cup but when Iasked told them put away    ???!! also no spoons other utensils table even paper coffee cup brought noone thought bringing spoon    ask another waiter it    even when he finally brought spoon never crossed mind bring forks knives eat with    Basically ask every little thing eat comfortably   The dish took half hour table course steak burnt    point just hungry tired waiting all wanted eat there  I am even mentioning fact when husband said he didn't eat pork waitress didn't offer substitute chicken something ended charging same price meatless version dish   Needless say 30 something dollar bill gave only $2 tip terrible service food got  hope read improve otherwise would lose all customers plenty places around eat Vegas! <EOR> I visited Public House early May  nice relaxing dinner  girlfriend little disappointed meatloaf but enjoyed meal although forgotten ordered   Service good  <EOR> How often two different restaurants open same name same city? guess stupid question because really don't care answer but surely creates some confusion  recently happened opening Public House Luxor  Somehow sharing same name expensive but superior Public House Venetian Luxor opened minimal fanfare couple weeks ago  Does hold well fancy Gastropub down street?  Public House Luxor decent but somewhat generic Stations feeling interior it very open clean but really stylized fun could be  features few pipes tied back beer kegs similar would find place Yardhouse even unrelated restaurant same name Venetian but they're quite impactful  There's darker more intimate inviting bar area well large open dining area  General Manager came table greet before food came mentioned official opening restaurant later night  early opportunity such exciting but kind leaves venue open revisit if meal less ideal early on   The menu isn't available yet website much else matter but Luxor page mentions 'upscale American Fare'  didn't really pay attention anything other burger half pound angus burger brioche choice cheese topping including mushrooms sautéed onions fried onions like  came didn't look impressive but meat great flavor upon first bite cooked more medium medium rare ordered  brioche bun buttery good mushrooms good flavor  cheese melted well coated entire patty  Speaking patty seemed hand formed wasn't close being perfect circle pretty weird shape it  Even if actually isn't hand formed illusion always welcome  Overall burger bit messy but somewhat negative connotation don't want apply burger formed standard looking burger every time gets dull irregular look bit refreshing   The fries sucked little flavor weren't really hot  very hard end kind odd unwelcome texture them  best part them definitely chipotle ketchup which wasn't option given waiter when asked if wanted ketchup but person brought food later no ketchup hand   The burger comes kettle chips salad $12 which isn't bad price restaurant directly casino but hate fact pay extra $3 fries instead  combined iced tea brought meal $18 75 very quickly which bit much get  suppose could start drinking water cutting easily $3 4 every meal but sure most visitors locations would probably order beer something more expensive doesn't matter much  additional money fries annoys but if you're looking burger don't want leave Luxor isn't bad  If you're willing walk couple minutes spend few dollars more Burger Bar far better choice  <EOR> Atmosphere cool staff great top but food left much desired  Crab salad pulled pork sandwhich needs seasoning  shrimp spinach dip app pretty tasty but ITS kinda hard all sauces componets  Its ok loud  Great TV'S drinks  Try fire ball  <EOR> When Vegas point come eat public house great wings beer bartender Amanda GREAT! <EOR> I should preface saying food waitress Erica we're both 5 stars  manager atmosphere watching sports 1 star fact TV  group friends myself well other Blackhawks fan asked staff several times put audio Stanley Cup Playoffs all fans follow game  Staff all replied cannot  manager said audio Cavs game  manager resturant whom am assuming also bartender he only person resturant watching Cavs game always right instead customer  Good luck Las Vegas getting NHL team if staff sports bar doesn't even support NHL fans  Spoiler alert LeBron wins  <EOR> The service quick friendly  great Sports Bar grab quick affordable good meal Vegas! <EOR> I recently dinner some co workers  able try some possibly new menu items  very picky eater bit nervous  absolutely loved honey BBQ wings  craving them since  also some Thai chicken wings boyfriend love he felt he could explain them well enough  He already told 5 people wings haha  He says he never anything them before  fan humus but humus bill served very tasty  could enough it  Pasta always menu item really enjoyed Mac n Cheese  perfect amount cheese love presentation small cast iron skillet  favorite dish meatloaf which am also usually fan of  flavors delicious mash potatoes die for  sure sauce gravy plate but perfect match meatloaf potatoes  Chef Bill explained each item made feel luxury guests  server Diana very friendly  definitely visiting place again hopefully meatloaf! <EOR> The food good service bad ordered large beer brought small wait staff does know listen words come people's mouths  Would recommend any one <EOR> Fun place grab bite eat! food good drinks even better  Check FourSquare half off specialty cocktails! <EOR> if  ur luxor sports bars spot  hit happy hour u miss strip prices clean which helps <EOR> Gonna short  Told waiter birthday  21st  bill over 400$ three people  price don't care about  But just because party 20 next does mean simply ignore us  asked lemons literally 4 times  Asked bread 3 times  He couldn't explain ANYTHING menu asked for  he charged extra drink accident   don't know if server thought idiot if just naive but work shitty little hole wall LA manager would livid if he knew ignored guest spent good amount  servers name Juan sure avoid place next time passing through Luxor  <EOR> Happy Hour Review daytime currently runs 2 6pm Monday through Friday includes several $5 small plates couple $3 beers half price specialty cocktails We happened upon Public House while checking what's new exciting South Strip  large happy hour signs beckoning hey hungry thirsty why not?   We sat two bar tops if recall correctly only offer happy hour bars adjacent tables   Service quick food drinks tasty good deal    So why 3 stars? Maybe off day but quite few people staff seemed unhappy particularly another pretty tangible enough affected experience  Hopefully typical because did enjoy food drink overall service fine but certainly didn't feel relaxed any way   We may give Public House another shot down road but many great places its likely lower list  <EOR> Happy Hour 4p 6p which rare town   2 1 drafts drinks   nice ! The mac n cheese bites chicken strips yummy   Amanda bar nice attentive <EOR> Extensive beer alcohol selection  appetizers great but public house nachos fantastic     Ask Stephanie she's great!

Chad told he work other part bar 10 minutes wasn't bartender   Meanwhile six guys sitting next friend's bachelor party previously divulged law enforcement yes saw badges mentioned tired waiting bill going just bounce tab  laughed told them Chad going right back but whatever   Then new bartender Aaron showed six cops paid bill  figured good time head over bathroom told everyone right back  Aaron bartender told STOP give TWO forms ID credit card before he'd allow bathroom  OK WHAT?!?  I'd sitting talking countless guests just basically stopped six guys bailing bill wasn't going allowed pee unless showed TWO forms ID credit card?!?!
