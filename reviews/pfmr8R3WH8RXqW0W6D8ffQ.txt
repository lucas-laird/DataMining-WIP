If your song miracle mile shops need bite before show great choice  Enjoy! <EOR> Tasted little kid food  fettucine alfredo rigatoni pomodor no flavor needed salt pasta more al dente  Ive better everywhere else  <EOR> Great atmosphere great drinks great food! I'd give them five stars but server wasn't quite ball  definitely again  best gnocchi ever had!!! <EOR> Is just lot restaurants Miracle Mile strip really mediocre overpriced? friends decided eat lunch when told where expectations dropped quite bit   Starting off sort flat bread cooked kind pizza  provided balsamic vinegar olive oil parmesan cheese dip in  Unfortunately found vest part meal   I ordered Paglia e Fieno which server said favorite pasta dishes here  $18 50 came pasta felt cooked past al dente point being soft drenched cream sauce  sauce itself lacked flavor depth felt just bunch watered down cream covering bowl soggy pasta   This place isn't price point feel could find better elsewhere strip  <EOR> Overpriced   mediocre    bad dry chewy bread  nice waiter   entree over cooked   Spagetti sauce bland over salted   chicken pasta chewy    4 mushrooms 4 peas vodka sauce  $10 Caesar 2 croutons   everything ala carte   Bruschetta mushy tasteless very disappointing! Didn't complain during meal  didn't want upset other guests  ice tea no ice! 1 glass house wine $10!!!! <EOR> The food delicious!! didn't think expensive  paid $40 frutti de mare spell check? Lol sangria  Considering Vegas  pretty good price  service good too  waiter very nice attentive   It located inside planet Hollywood theater  only thing thought weird service charge  5 charged $26 service charge top taxes  Apparently considered big group? Idk but whatever was paid lol   I would come again! calzone spaghetti amazing! only imagine rest food! <EOR> Went group twelve very good experience   service great food good   server suggested appetizer sampler plate group   plate great idea plenty food everyone   entrees good   menu good variety  <EOR> Pros Service very attentive waiter knowledgeable made good suggestions friendly talkative without being overbearing   issue chicken see below taken off bill immediately without second thought  Atmosphere Sure fake sky little cheesy but fun outdoor seating area cute even people passing wasn't loud  Roasted Tomato Soup Oh god   delicious!! sure if standard because soup day but possibly offer often?  HIGHLY recommend getting it  Price would expect much higher   $10 $15 pasta dishes also offered more expensive surft turf filet mignon etc higher price but definitely affordable non chain I think option when Vegas  Dipping oil bread Oh wow   I can't remember exactly but think olive oil balsalmic vinegar parmesean cheese chili pepper flakes pepper something else mixed together dip bread in   it definitely best standard olive oil vinegar type mix ever restaurant    Con Chicken friend each chicken pasta she added didn't come dish originally both thought tasted cleaning supplies   server talked chef suggested maybe rosemary maridnade used   sure because rosemary   suprisingly even though chicken disgusting am still giving Lombardi's 4 stars because chicken taken off bill waiter super nice service other food atmosphere made it  <EOR> Although food pretty tasty service very iffy  think might just enough staff but felt especially underserved compared those walked before us    When arrived no host stand wait couple minutes him  although he took drink order waited long time recieve them even longer take orders   We oil bread early but bread itself wasn't given until moments before finally received food  Everyone around even those arrived already received bread    The only complaint quality food alfredo nothing any other alfredo sauce before  almost transparent thin greenish  just okay but all expected    The decor very bland italian feel  Just whatever    I just felt overall could better service atmosphere same quality food less expensive italian joint  <EOR> I  actually two nights  row because first night good!
