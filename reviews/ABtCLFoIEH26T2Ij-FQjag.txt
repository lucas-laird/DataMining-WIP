Please note review need provide bit background  lived United States many years leaving Cuba  bulk years family lived El Paso Texas  thing El Paso pretty great Mexican food  However Cuban food mecca ready made Cuban pastries other foods readily available   By way internet husband found Roly's Bakery last Christmas  He wanted surprise Cuban pastries  He Cuban did quite know would but Vanessa Roly's manager truly helped those choices over phone   He told she only willing work order several Cuban bakeries throughout states he contacted  married time 13 years box Cuban pastries opened Christmas morning best if best present received during marriage  He taken back much meant receive these  darling husband am sure did imagine tears happiness he caused   Since then met Vanessa person visited bakery several times year  While enjoyed guava coconut pastries Cuban sandwiches croquetas more  addition always put order Vanessa bring back boxes pastries whether fly drive let just say lot Cuban pastries way El Paso  dad turning 86 December absolutely loves them  back month third Vegas trip year dad definitely looking forward new batch pastelitos coming way   Besides delicious offerings really sets them apart family service  simple phone call made over 700 miles away foundation loyalty customer service its best  Roly's small down earth bakery right across UNLV  Very much welcomed choice where delicious well priced food away strip  Certainly wonderful place offering much more those left behind flavors another place time  Roly's bring them back  <EOR> I love little place!   staff friendly    Atmosphere welcoming! stopped Cuban sandwich which pretty good size just split one    good but great    Cuban coffee delicious    Price little high end but pastries delicious!   met cute lil Cuban man told cafe over 30 years!  must doing something right!  chorizo empanadas MUST have!  Hope review helps! Adios now! <EOR> Went back yesterday way Vegas excited some good breakfast   raved place dad disappointed crummy service even worse food received   waited over 30 minutes breakfast when everyone came served quickly   ladies wouldn't even look way until dad finally stared down she asked if waiting breakfast   When said yes attitude miraculously breakfast came out  COLD!  All ordered two eggs over easy ham croquettes those things horrible Cuban bread hard more cracker   coffee weak place dirty staff just ignored us   NM won't back  <EOR> Ordered custom cake for my daughters birthday  cake itself decorated well  Unfortunately  cake itself super dense odd tasting vanilla cake  raspberry filling nothing more jelly  paying 60 bucks definitely worth it  <EOR> This place great!  Especially if good Cuban coffee pastry it   But also good breakfast offering   veggie omelet choritzo omelet   Both great fresh ingredients   But most impressive coffee   classic Cuban coffee sugar also great cafe con leche   Interestingly if search coffee houses Las Vegas almost all them some distance away strip   guess because coffee houses serve people living tourists   great find although take car there   Highly recommended   By way also run wedding cake business same bakery but many cakes slice nice! <EOR> Delicious sandwiches pastries surly staff  No greeting no thank you  girl behind counter seemed very irritated asking questions such does sandwich come mayo?  no pickles? STILL pickles   know working public unpleasant lot if most times but when customer smiling asking question nicely least could fake some niceness act if we're inconveniencing you  We'll back because food really good now know expect much politeness service wise but it'd nice able put order made feel jerk  <EOR> What disappointment!!!  excited visit Roly's Bakery am Cuban recently relocated Miami   Being Vegas few months now missing pastelitos Cuban bread sandwich   expected something bit more authentic   shame people Las Vegas equate Roly's Bakery Cuban pastries since probably don't know anything better   First all Cuban bread wasn't authentic chewy bread Wal Mart sells   those who've never wonderful authentic Cuban bread huge air pockets very very light texture crust flakes almost paper   pastelitos far away authentic bread  Again missed flakiness  taste mediocre   only thing nailed cod croquettes  <EOR> Cuban sandwiches coffee  Yummy! pasteries great if  flakey kind  biggest complaint take very very long time to go order ready  took over half hour freaking sandwich made  If aren't hurry love good Cuban bakery good one  would again  <EOR> Didnt explain menu 'pastry' meant them vs expectations plastic silverware styrofoam plates  Just ok <EOR> Never coming back unprofessional  Ordered cake day prior came pick wasn't ready substitute ingredients then said would put  waiting hour  Could just baked cake home probably  No sense compromise disatisfaction  cake work ended being late work  Disappointed much senor  <EOR> Ordered cake daughter's first birthday terrific!   Having recently ordered cake another event another bakery being pretty dissatisfied really stressed cake order  Roly's came highly recommended another Mommy friend mine gave shot    The place isn't much look wouldn't describe guy took cake order super friendly but he listened everything said  several photos cakes Pinterest u kind combining them all create perfect cake little's perfect party  guy patient took lots notes  Then flavors  tons choose lots fillings well  ordered two tier cake 30 servings chocolate raspberry filling top Cuban cake which he described very moist white cake Bavarian cream coconut filling    I braced myself cost $172! extremely reasonable  reasonable fact neurotic brain started worrying quality cake    When picked cake wasn't ready  15 min wait which normally would bothered but morning party tons little agitated    Any all agitation immediately dissipated upon seeing cake! PERFECT! Exactly asked for   Driving cake home nerve wracking next time definitely pay delivery    The most important thing also best cakes ever tasted  Moist cool perfect amount evenly sweet frosting  several compliments parents kids devoured it!  only regret didn't try chocolate tier  blinked gone!   I absolutely ordering again! <EOR> Just birthday 3leches cake     amazing flavor beautiful design    Loved !!! price fair according boss ! always ready made ready cakes emergency situations  <EOR> I LOVE place!

Well what's complain when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?  My husband ordered #3 scrambled eggs guava pastry  First clear eggs used real bagged  Second husband thrilled find they're seasoned lightly Sazon popular Latin seasoning blend use eggs home  Now most important part  husband loves croquettes but learned expect much any place sells them  Today changed  He bit into croquette expecting usual mediocrity instead eyes lit he looked toward kitchen said Oh god MOM? THERE?   took bite attest fact best croquettes eatery    http www yelp com biz_photos rolys bakery las vegas?select=XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g#XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g  All all breakfast came $13 before tip  plan come back Cuban pizza honestly more everything else  <EOR> Had Spanish Omelet coffee here  omelet very good liked flavor chorizo thin egg wrapper  coffee also great bold fresh  also came guava pastry which good but flaky airy hoped  Nonetheless paid less eight bucks could saved more if knew UNLV students faculty 20% discount  <EOR> We tried medianoche guava pastry cortadito empanadas     good good good very good respectively   Their selection pastry limited  still think Roly's worth trying because good service cleanliness decent taste food  going back try some more menu   My reason 3 stars frankly best Cuban pastry sandwich tried Cal Glendale Porto's bakery standard beat  some best Cuban  pastry sandwich at least places tried      Until find something better Roly's Las Vegas guess place do  <EOR> Cuban bread!  good    Cuban crackers home made   no more shipping Miami !

Sure sweeten myself but don't enjoy guilty feeling dumping loads sugar into coffee cup  could continue rant but instead note glad selected slice guava cake take home tasted fresh moist convinced Roly's deserved another visit   The selections tried second trip better  found slice guava strudel more pleasing turnover cream cheese first visit introduced masareal de coco two layers dense cookie like cake sandwiched sweet coconut filling  also love tocinillo de cielo dense yellow flan top layer sponge cake helps soak caramel syrup  addition desserts Roly's does menu savory options  husband tried traditional pressed sandwich said OK but he doesn't much Cuban sandwich experience comparison  Having never sampled Cuban pizza ordered veggie which came topped fresh spinach onions green bell peppers cheese sweet tomato sauce hint cumin  crust more thick round focaccia very bready pizza  glad tried once but probably would order again   Prices very fair Roly's many desserts under $1  Breakfast specials cheap worth checking out  Empanadas papa rellena those little fried mashed potato balls ground beef filling people seem obsessed also available  Plus place usually packed Cubans taking multiple boxes pastries go  may wait bit counter service but think  good sign  <EOR> Love place best pastries amazing cakes never anything didn't like!!!! <EOR> Love Cuban pastries Cuban coffee staff cake etc  used them parties Lechon asado arroz moro   Nice Las Vegas since nothing Miami!
