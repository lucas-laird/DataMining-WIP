Being local area Peng Zu hopes go to Asian Chinese restaurant frequent    ordered hot sour soup over done w corn starch lacked any hint sour nothing going neither could take more few spoonfuls! Next ordered chicken lettuce wraps which should called Chicken mush bad pieces lettuce!  Chicken clearly frozen mixed w mushrooms other fillers flavorless more stuffing consistency inedible !!
