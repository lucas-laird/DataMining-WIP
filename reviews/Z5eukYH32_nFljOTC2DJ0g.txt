But pizzas Grimaldi's well could prop bar keep feeding slices heaven until burst Mr Creosote Monty Python reference kids!! ordered large tomato sauce pizza mushrooms fresh chopped tomatoes roasted sweet red peppers garlic   no meat folks sorry!! Also caprasie also known tri colour salad appetizer small house salad pizza   The Caprasie salad $7 perfect share came dinkiest pieces bread top basil Roma tomatoes home made mozzarella  yummy! small house salad $5 again more enough share between two people really complimented pizza salad dressing flavorful but didn't over power dish    And now may favorite part pizza said love pizzas but topped charts! base beautifully cooked good thin crust hand tossed kinda base but still soft amazingly fresh tasting  amazingly managed completely uncracker which most wood coal fired pizza places seem bases  secret tomato sauce sweet just right amount herbs over powering your eyes water but damn good flavour! toppings   well mushrooms beautiful gritty small couldn't find them fresh tomatoes sweet juicy sweet red peppers   oh god amazing slight spicy flavour enhanced sweet roasted yumminess peppers! Lastly garlic wow wee good thing sitting myself wow still taste garlic loooooong time since ate it!

But last time  waitress wasn't take our Order more 20min   Even she don't bring any water   It disappoint us    But love still Pizza <EOR> This pizza restaurant plan B unsuccessful attempt eat Carson Kitchen downtown Las Vegas unfortunately closed private party event   Generally dislike going any restaurant located inside hotel strip because traffic parking combined walking distance inconvenient   Palazzo nice higher end hotel going made bit more tolerable   restaurant itself lets feel having dinner outside nice     We ordered antipasto spinach salad Don pizza pepperoni sausage meatballs    thin crust pizza cooked under intense heat short time brick oven tastes your standard Napoli style pizza they're okay but don't way crust always burnt   If you're fan Chicago style pan pizza then place may you   wife other hand just loved said best pizza she ever had   good tangy tomato sauce melted cheese slightly salted meat taste hit spot   also enjoyed spinach salad because came other healthy stuff crispy bacon Gorgonzola cheese    antipasto good well hard wrong cold cuts sliced cheese olives jarred red peppers plate   paired well bread olive oil vinegar dipping   later learned restaurant available 5 other locations we'll sure bookmark locations off strip next time Las Vegas  <EOR> Just thinking pizza salivate   crust crispy yet chewy toppings highest caliber cheese gooey good    wouldn't order pesto red pepper pizza wasn't favorite   close you're going NY style pizza Vegas  <EOR> I liked pizza    but really didn't care $2 $3 each topping!! Expensive pizza!! location Henderson wish gone Verrazanos  waitress forgot overpriced salad  But very extensive wine drink selection     guess help wash down $$$! Pizza  think more drink selections pizza selections  Next time somewhere else <EOR> Decided dinner far away strip thinking would way better overall  don't know if wrong right but place surely disappointed us  started first beer selection  Okay big deal food more important but they're beer chose didn't even offer suggestion  ordered large pizza two toppings sausage mushrooms   could literally count all sausage toppings mushrooms just sparse  place charges topping felt ripped off!  Service wasn't much better  table nearby more food drinks could tell better service entire time because it  Ridiculous party two!  By time almost half pizza became rubbery impossible cut fork knife bleh! slice left over decided go  When tried eating later evening disgusting! Needless say won't returning any other Grimaldi's locations  <EOR> Tiz yummy but bit pricey don't often fact some different toppings run mill stuff     I miss grimaldi' when move <EOR> Food excellent! Service friendly favorite places nice but fast lunch! <EOR> HOLY CRAP   pesto chicken die   son   doesn't eat anything but cheese but LOVES pesto chicken  last time kids husbands birthday when he town business waiter recommended add mushrooms made even much more great   service very friendly   love Grimaldis!   I can't rate any other kind pizza cause all chicken pesto    oh! caesar salad also very delish   1 order good 3 ppl    also! gets packed prepared if there's wait   sure if take reservations   but if do   one! <EOR> Pizza great! service so so  maybe because closing hour when walked but constantly ask waiter water because he 'forgot '  table sat outdoors very unstable felt if beer going fall off table wine glasses going fall crack well   But other pizza exceptional salad  <EOR> Prices gone since frozen section supermarket pizza half price <EOR> Well ok if area hungry  waiter nice! <EOR> Authentically gourmet pizza reasonable price for Strip doesn't break bank  Pizza tastes pretty much NYC version fresh tomato sauce good quality cheese thin chewy crust mission accomplished! <EOR> Went moms free birthday pizza 4pm wait longer pizza made because clean ovens every day time but pizza good wish would put cheese whole pizza     didn't much menu  Just pizza salads drinks deserts would love if added pasta chicken parmesan <EOR> Tried different location much better experience  Ordered mediterranean salad   so good  pepperoni fresh garlic pizza very delicious  coal fired pizza crisp  blackened crust crust great   I may ask left oven little longer crust few more black spots  But crust chewy overall great dining experience  wait staff terrific single complaint! YAY! Oh wait   I'm Italian Sicilian actually raised Sicilian grandma served every meal BREAD! Where bread? Every table should served bread! know high carbs but also high taste!  My previous less fabulous review location Henderson newly opened south west location  BTW still can't touch Metro!

Cheers! <EOR> Wow bf right hooked Grimaldi's!  dinner last night everything perfect food weather ambiance!  We ordered small caesar salad share yes share yes small $7    perfect portion two   dressing zesty ample quite addicting   croutons fresh large crispy but jaw breaking    lettuce fresh green   parmesan good but stuff factory shredded freshly shaved   sucker freshly shaved parm know stuff resembles potato chips   Regardless bf picking random caesar salad work chow down on   The pizza quite delightful!  crust thin flaky very good flavor   sauce gets two thumbs being overpowering chunky some pizza joints tend little over zealous about   cheese oh cheese   it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore when your pizza presented almost glows because mozzarella beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings if choose garnish your pie   Instead traditional size pepperonis use miniature sized ones   think pepperoni pie easier eat but  just opinion   The ambiance Eastern Ave  Grimaldi's quite charming even being strip mall   Las Vegas lucky such beautiful weather pretty much year round therefore open air bistros Grimaldi's gem such gorgeous days nights   layout restaurant well thought out   bar two sided   side being patio other side indoor bistro  kind ingenious!  Let known bar does draught beer tap Peroni Blue Moon Blue Moon Pumpkin few others    wine menu geared more towards everyday wines most bottles under $50    assortment reds whites blushes available glass bottle    Liquorwise limited basics Bombay Sapphire Three Olives Vodka 1800 J W  Black Label Jack etc   just remember when order your cocktail ultra lounge   don't snob just because may carry your favorite liquor suck try something different!  I blast Grimaldi's because bottle Riesling bottle Pinot Noir but because being surrounded good food good ambiance good service great company! <EOR> 4 5 stars  First time trying Grimaldis today WOW! left very impressed  service top notch attentive  waiter very patient explaining all different styles options choose pizzas  settled large chicken cheese top 3 us   pizza much flavor! All 3 tore pie apart no time! never stood chance! drinks never reached bottom before quickly being refilled  prices fair definately well worth product recieved!  Only negative all whole experience when finished server asked twice if wanted desert which politely declined  waited bill    and waited  wasn't Burger Dog ish time wait   but starting become bit frustrating until sweet lady swooped sped things bit  no means deal breaker certainly back near future especially when town relatives visiting!

Friends mine lived Vegas wanted take Grimaldi's while town last month  say impressed!! arrived around 6 30pm Friday night busy busy thought would least 20 30 minute wait but wrong table right away  table located right front kitchen guys making pizza's  When sat down saw brick oven pizza's coming oven knew treat!! thin crusted topped fresh ingredients brickoven coal bottom    We started off cold antipasti platter  Italian meats cheeses olives fresh foccacia bread  Your typical cold antipasti platter can't wrong    For dinner ordered Large pizza half pesto pepperoni onions other half tomato sauce sausage mushrooms artichokes olives  both great! would say tomato veggies sausage side favorite however really enjoyed mini peperoni's other size usually its large slices pepperoni    Grimaldi's also great wine selection  Since friends regulars server kind enough offer help selecting glass white wine even brought few samples!   The restaurant fun casual atmosphere bar half inside half outside outside seating  Perfect warm but cool Vegas night! would definitely recommend checking place out! <EOR> Having eaten easily 125 150 pizza places over past  20 years Grimaldi's hands down top 3   sharing other two spots Leftys San Diego Genos Chicago   Surprisingly thin crust blew mind   dough slightly above average but sauce visual magic thousands butterflies   Imagine joy put into sauce   dough could pavement all concerned sauce would made edible   Place jam packed still able under hour  <EOR> I Grimaldi's few times pizza never really disappointed yet never fully satisfied either    This place located Eastern Avenue very conveniently close 215 won't hard restaurant does offer few parking spaces unfortunately tend occupied most time  restaurant itself isn't large might wait seated depending time day   I several different types pizza pizzas always fresh decently but would definitely expected something better particularly given price pizza toppings   One good thing place atmosphere which pretty nice restaurant's decor participating quite greatly it   In conclusion would say place average but could still check if you're area craving pizza! Feel free message any additional details may need! <EOR> I am pizza snob  Pizza Hut Papa Johns Dominos etc  sufficient satisfy pie cravings  Thus am usually hesitant hit actual pizza restaurants  Unless place offers personal pizzas negotiate toppings whoever sharing with  am sure all friend thinks anchovies must have  top pizza restaurants comparably overpriced compared take out delivery siblings   With mind Grimaldi's serves some pretty good pizza but fails impress  ingredients most part better chain counter parts  pizzas aren't greasy heavy fact only seem thin crust pizzas no deep dish chi town peeps   bit overpriced considering don't offer any custom specialties pizzas left wondering just overpaid simple pepperoni pizza   I wish some more stand ingredients maybe signature combo  spot few times service pretty average  patio nice touch but restaurant itself pretty small  Call ahead weekends most pizza joints slower turn over time packed busier days  <EOR> Classic NY pizza place interior design modern twist   bit wood metal stone   lovely outdoor dining area no smoking allowed 10 tables think    Also bar where sit inside there's large rolling shutter opens    Oh absolutely no gaming   If ask  major plus!

Oh we'll discount your bill  She ended taking $10 bucks off which wasn't looking for but ended being slap face    This review intended reflect particular location  love food Grimaldi's but most likely drive across town different location future    Easily worst dining experience experienced year  <EOR> Hands down only places best quality pizza Las Vegas  pizza literally die for  kinda pricey but most definitely worth it  highly suggest trying it  going years  They're service amazing restaurant very nice style making enjoy atmosphere  <EOR> I live around corner Grimaldi's  never been  oldest daughter wanted take lunch birthday said Hey never Grimaldi's hear pretty good let's try large pizza    half cheese half without she's vegan 3 toppings also shared salad  Sangria excellent!! gal served we sat bar really attentive helpful! delicious enjoyable lunch  going back! <EOR> I hate leaving anything but five star reviews  fact seems only reviews ever post  But felt share experience    I heard many great things Grimaldis craving coal fired pizza while  anticipating pie quite some time planned pizza night good friends week prior finally ordering    I would disclose did take out  could very well why pie unsatisfactory   We ordered two large pizzas  pepperoni veggie pizza  total $50  seemed higher side two large pies but okay price due anticipating  picked two pizzas right estimated time brought directly home  live five minutes away  immediately served pizza hungry pizza loving group find pies rather soggy  outside crust where would hold pizza nice solid texture char but rest piece Almost raw moved towards middle slice  dough underneath felt wet If sense? couldn't even pick mine because no form  past experiences coal fired pizzas never soggy  really sad because hoping crispy charred yet chewy crust  kept mind could because boxed go but can't help but compare other pizzas ordered did same issue   Also pies did sit long    The pizzas beautiful size nice   It could off night but don't think ordering spot again  Sad such mediocre pizzas   Hope all better experiences! <EOR> We Saturday night super busy  But service bad amount people there  addition sit down patrons also bunch take orders do  waitress really cool extra pizza sent back kitchen because olives she gave free! olives   Didn't time try salad but loked good  <EOR> I've eaten few times now  When place packed eat service pretty terrible  pizza decent  ingredients good quality good pizza  If sauce wasn't bland then would given 5 despite service ordering pick works great though  sauce taste just scooped crushed tomatoes    BUT plain canned tomatoes sometimes better some pizza sauces there  still think Settebello's better pizza  <EOR> I opened restaurant opening crew three years ago   started bartender there   Grimaldi's more just another pizza joint     Grimaldi's true Italian cuisine all about   Stated simply ingredients   Use ingredients best season your region wonderful results   Unfortunately middle desert where nothing fun eat grows   Luckily everyone ships Vegas     When something simple dough cheese sauce ingredients best   Grimaldi's supplier Italy imports tomatoes them even use bottled water dough   would think pizza made Vegas water would subpar   worst water tasted states   toppings ranging pepperoni Ricotta cheeses all superior any tasted town      The artist sculpts pie also huge difference   dough hand tossed   loved watching head pizza maker time dance dough finger tips   pies far superior pies made some other pie makers   artist turns pie while oven moving closer further coals   helps ensure tasty crust   few times when eaten pie delicious flaky crusty crust   other times when pie undercooked liking crispy   But overall excellent pie gourmet ingredients   So Grimaldi's place nostalgia mixed feelings different time life   little pizzeria quintessential East Coast Italy   former where grew up latter dream going   still love Grimaldi's day  <EOR> One personal favorites Green Valley area although few locations around Nevada  prepared wait weekends busy nights  But always good pie Peroni tap   Be aware pay premium premium pizza  Nevertheless worth money  Perfect crust array toppings ricotta artichoke  Fun place quick bite casual date night    Oh antipasto great! <EOR> We ordered take extra sauce ricotta cheese  Really good pizza!

Naw me  secret pizza place Cosmo better NY style pizza joint vegas me  But did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza definitely come back again  Pesto try White garlic next time come here     only other real minor complaint never refill beverage  left glass end table could see empty waitress never noticed until already done eating  time didnt even want refill anymore because would waste soda  guess  biggest pet peeve when comes restaurants  don't need come every 5 mins but should come check guests every often see if need anything  Customer service just important if more important food restaurant serving  <EOR> Came Saturday afternoon friend  warmly greeted hostess she asked if whether would sit outside bar somewhere inside  first wanted sit outside patio but weren't any available tables moment  Rather waiting just sat inside two top table across bar   We split small pizza both ordered some peach iced tea  Half pizza pepperoni jalepenos other half sliced meatballs ricotta mushrooms  arrived nice hot  loved thin crust perfectly foldable  ricotta cheese very flavorful complemented meatballs quite well  would say pepperoni side just average though  server came once awhile check filled drinks   What liked best place noise level  often pizza place hardly hear anyone saying  we're sitting next bar TV on steady stream customers restaurant  Yet could still hear each other talk   My dining companion wanted some dessert cheesecakes pizza however upon finishing pizza server came over just plopped down check  Did even ask if wanted dessert   Overall would say nice place lunch meeting date  Don't expect anything fancy  <EOR> The only reason am giving them 5 stars due prices  love pizza gladly pay ask but believe little overpriced PIZZA! LOVE place though  Reminds pizza grew eating back home east coast  Perfectly controlled portions crust sauce meat basil garlic whatever else  Absolutly top 5 pizza spots country least far  also really flavors cheesecake especially seasonal specialty cheesecakes  YUMMM! <EOR> Service second time location service slow once again  soon arrived sat immediately but took 5 10 minutes before anyone could attend us  looking around waiting service when several employees passed without even acknowledging us  Clearly needed help  When server finally approached he didn't even tell name found name Jeff looking check   salad came quickly but only table without silverware  seemed everything asked took awhile  didn't bring drinks right away  halfway through plate salad when drinks finally came out  whole table done eating server didn't even come check us  wait longer check change  wasn't even busy all  If anything restaurant already clearing time  When left NONE employees bothered greet thank goodbye  Instead saw employees chatting each other    Food food great but should work quicker friendlier service  Oh tables little crammed  <EOR> Wow! place really great pizza some best ever honestly! really excited found great place area real New York style pizza  grandfather New York owned pizza shop years taught real NY pizza definitely it  wish could taken he would loved it  just cheese pizza absolutely delicious  peanut butter chocolate cheesecake insane well  great  Thank Grimaldi's keep good work! <EOR> Grimaldi's two favorite local pizza places  service always good never problem getting table despite being busy place  wait food never long  isn't something applies point but restaurant family friendly   They little different most pizza places because don't any suggested pizza combinations  All pizzas create your own  choose size base red sauce pesto garlic then toppings  Each topping additional charge may best place someone likes many toppings  red sauce because unique flavor doesn't overpower toppings  standard amount cheese minimal which but someone wants really cheesy pizza may want choose extra cheese    In addition good pizza also some tasty salads spinach salad  small definitely enough two people share if also getting pizza  <EOR> Nice little place excellent pizza nice selection draft beers   small cheese pizza plenty two   Unbelievably good perfectly cooked crust excellent sauce just right amount cheese sprinkling basil top   If know good pizza   you'll know very very good pizza! <EOR> small pizza medium other places  divided into 6 slices evenly    the pizza crust delicious thin lightly burnt just way it!!   got pepperoni mushroom toppings pepperoni different tasted really good    the pizza perfect amount sauce service good  atmosphere restaurant see two pizza guys tossing pizza dough amusing watch   next time ask extra basil! <EOR> Our favorite pizza joint!! pizza pepperoni sausage pesto red sauce  <EOR> Great pizza even better staff  Ate twice last week good  Pizzas incredible     I definitely going back next trip Vegas <EOR> Love when try something Vegas  off strip    Local Friends took lunch last visit   Great choice pizza perfect!!!  Definitely returning when back Vegas! <EOR> I only came because tried original Grimaldi's location Brooklyn NY  see review Since cannot afford fly NY whim Vegas little closer home  Although Grimaldi's isn't exactly Vegas but worth drive when visiting   The biggest advantage visiting Vegas location versus Brooklyn space   restaurant much larger therefore no wait time   downside slow service once seated   also 'authentic' down home feel Grimaldi's BK   ambiance any other pizza joint nothing special nothing unique   There's nothing original but white pie still pretty damn good   Don't forget add sun dried tomatoes   if room left try cannoli    Some people fast food 'cheap' deals if prefer stick dollar menus Domino's just save few bucks then keep moving   Grimaldi's isn't your cheap even average priced pizza   worth extra $ treat yourself sometime!  4 STARS location 5 STARS original location must try but beware long line! <EOR> I ordered large Margarita pizza picked up  only live 2 miles away here  When home pizza slightly warm  ingredients fresh but many pizza itself hardly any sauce cheese tomatoes  crust cracker dry when bit into broke apart  Weird  place looks nice although many people there  know great reviews maybe just hit wrong maybe eaten would better  Time find better pizzeria  Las Vegas    that won't difficult  <EOR> Vegetarian pizza amazing!

Honestly if just pizza I'd say Settebello edge but huge edge!!  As Grimaldi's here's see it Pros *Cool vibe nice patio! Feels much more fun dine Settebello  *Various sizes pizza! issues Settebello because only size serve just tad big me     then overeat because can't leave last piece plate etc   or then waste some    prefer order slighly larger pie Grimaldi's split it! Much more cost effective no wasted pizza overeating  *better drink menu *They spread cheese out! No huge globs cheese   yummy cheese spread perfectly   Cons *Crust slightly better Settebello's *Ummm salame    can't find here! general think toppings little better over Settebello but much    Honestly alternate between two places depending mood  both awesome  <EOR> BEST PIZZA LAS VEGAS! love authentic  Every single bite enjoyable  salads good pretty simple  usually order take out pig while watching Grey's Anatomy But also great place casual date family dinner  Affordable prices friendly people  Can't wrong Grimaldi's! <EOR> Best pizza Henderson   gets little pricey when want add additional toppings your pizza but usually worth especially meatballs    Always sprinkle some garlic powder oregano add essential flavors you're all set   free pizza your birthday!

Would obvious if accidentally lick it? did brig taser?? LATE!! your 3 friends already going sparta each other it  Yep  that good son  that good   First lets start flavor  Le awesome  Mia mamma   this pizza packed flavor  Delicious sauce toppings generous  but lacking tastyness all  Enough sauce let taste other ingredients making whole different experience  The size  well  well    if hungry use x large pizza blanket tent parachute cover small garden  thing massive  its perfect appetite  even small aint small  calzone may ask? yes size whole island  Holy impressive sizes batman!  Now if like tried grimaldins NY then 'll say well its same DUH course isnt because all other components food delicious water air bacteria etc present different enviroment city  However hands down best pizza tried desert    to top days 50 percent off bottles wine tuesdays believe   drunk full happy   man should writing slogan!   aware dont take reservations place packed  Hasta la pasta     see did there? <EOR> I've spoiled Brooklyn location  year ago made walk across Bridge Manhattan over Brooklyn found ourselves waiting line Grimaldi's  When finally started eating pizza properly seasoned crust actually charred burnt flavor made place famous   When heard Grimaldi chains all over place immediately intrigued  closest Las Vegas  next trip decided check lunch  10 minute drive Strip closer Henderson  found ourselves some strip mall which reminded Irvine   When settled stopped looking all black white faux Brooklyn framed photos all over walls decided sharing large pizza half sun dried tomatoes mushrooms other half pepperoni  also shared antipasto salad which pretty good  Fresh slices mozzarella salami salted olives along some toasted bread  nice way start off meal   Unfortunately pizza bit disappointment  Naturally high expectations having Brooklyn location  pizza overall tasted bit bland needed more seasoning crust  crust didn't burnt coal flavor either  But if think could it? comparing Brooklyn location which ovens burning since 1905  huge difference   I even asked waitress if true ship water NY  She flat said no but water filtration system using osmosis which replicates NY water  Interesting say least  wouldn't say made much difference anyway  Overall still good pizza would rather something Costco Dominos Pizza Hut  Prices pretty high however but good occasional splurge  3 5 stars  <EOR> Pizza good but service tonight great  Didn't even someone refill 30min until heard last slurp soda  First time even though food good won't come back due service  <EOR> Love place   Reminds lot ny pizza   easily favorite pizzerias town   other place usually Metro Pizza horizon ridge   offer usual salads cal zones pizzas   usually order specialty pies   pizzas itself little pricy but nothing ridiculous  <EOR> Best pizza!  own meatball spinach ricotta tomatoes!
