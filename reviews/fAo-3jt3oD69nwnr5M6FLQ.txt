The menu extensive but exactly would expect Chinese restaurant  absolute favorite peking duck  prepared lot food since comes 2 courses first duck pancakes then duck lettuce wraps  Both flavorful filling   The service excellent definitely felt having fine dining experience even though eating same type food would delivered rainy Sunday evening!  I'm sure if would return simply because Vegas filled incredible restaurants am dying try   but would certainly recommend if you're mood some great Chinese food  <EOR> It's getting much better recent years   Asian fusion works  <EOR> This place best service ambience any Chinese restaurant US  food authentic but wasn't any better something Chinatown  portion also very small  <EOR> From moment walk everything amazing  decor staff food all wonderful   We ordered duck salad AMAZING! much duck fan but salad alone wpuld reason back  also ordered Mongolian beef chow main both dishes also very good fresh flavorful  staff answered questions knew menu well recommend great cocktails  <EOR> Wing Lei first Michelin starred Chinese restaurant western United States   Michelin also give Wing Lei star but scale five    Wonderful setting great service but food plain awful based large number positive reviews peppered bad ones clearly case emperor no clothes   Open Table reviewer swooned particularly over General Tso's Chicken   better gloppy orange colored chicken buck a plate Chinese fast food steam table outlets South Central Los Angeles served Wing Lei   Given Wing Lei charges $29 same dish costs $2 50 hood  pretty strong indictment bad food Wing Lei     duck salad wasn't awful but neither particularly good    don't know if Wing Lei deserved star when Richard Chen chef but can't imagine any restaurant more overrated  <EOR> The food good Peking Duck Mandarin Crepes  service very good friendly staff always right time   Restaurant decor drab didn't seem reminiscent place Wynn  <EOR> Wing Lei high end Chinese restaurant many fine dining experiences offered Wynn Las Vegas hotel casino  would tastiest Peking Duck meals even came steep price which almost justified dining Wing Lei's lavish audacious dining room adorned jewels gold   There exists number large ornate Chinese restaurants country far removed strip mall take out brethren Wing Lei's regal unmistakable Chinese ornamentation restaurants aspire but can't quite achieve due budgetary constraints thus need settle substandard furnishings leave restaurant décor Western sensibilities feels looks dated just downright hokey moment open  Stunning results achieved when Chinese restaurant permitted access Steve Wynn's checking account proving not so thin line between gauche garish few million bucks   When seated presented Chinese welcome tea lychee honey which tantalizing light floral sweet way begin meal  Next came amuse bouche Compressed Melon Cucumber Carrots Ginger Vinaigrette another well prepared taste much sweeter tea tangy vinaigrette added unctuous mouth feel prevented bite being one note   Reviewing menu noted Wing Lei serves Imperial Duck Tasting $98 per person an extra $48 wine pairing which includes schmancy versions traditional stir fry soup courses but requires minimum two people both want tasting which more had  instead ordered regular Imperial Peking Duck entrée which consisted only single course skin meat separately carved tableside  oddly same price tasting   Even though didn't traditional second third courses entrée duck course presented tableside head still attached per Peking Duck ritual  sticky reddish brown skin glazed malt syrup soy magnificent luster it  Several wait staff then gathered around cart began carving duck wrapping duck skin meat scallions cucumbers hoisin sauce into ch?n bing referred Wing Lei's menu crepes assembly line manner symphony efficient effective blade work wrapping servers   At most Chinese restaurants serve Peking Duck process assembling duck garnitures into ch?n bing DIY but complaining  workmanship performed excellent each duck wrap having seemed perfect ratio duck skin duck meat vegetables sweet hoisin  removed pieces skin wraps gnaw all independently crackly ought be  didn't quite pass Heston Blumenthal's test skin shattering into pieces when thrown plate but close enough  told difficult find Peking Duck skin good America only level Peking Duck Decoy NYC   The meat itself good muscle to fat ratio intense flavor definitely ducky enough without being gamy taste spoiled  floor manager indicated source ducks farm Rhode Island they're slightly smaller ducks I'd typically see served Peking Duck  duck entrée feed two people also order appetizers  Once full took remaining wraps 40% remained all meat bones back hotel room later consumption   Because stuffed no need order dessert  Petit fours nonetheless provided which included Green Tea Macaron 5 Spice Chocolate Nugget Coconut Ball  Additionally Wing Lei sent away take home Yuzu Almond Cake which enjoyed breakfast next morning   Food Décor Service 4 6 4 5 4 7  NOTE Wing Lei's Yelp rating initially surprised Yelp rating being low but then started read reviews realized ridiculous people when come place this  Almost all one star reviews due dress code issues  much ask people put jacket wear proper shoes when visiting expensive fine dining restaurant? woman barely type coherent sentence recently one starred Wing Lei because gave jacket cover because didn't want dining restaurant dressed tramp she course blamed body shaming  if some man showed Michelin starred restaurant wife beater muscle shirt would treated any differently  Yelp such pit sometimes reviews restaurant testimony some worst  <EOR> It's interesting because place 2 michelin star Chinese restaurant  usually fan high end Chinese food but came bday dinner since serving really good special right now  peking duck tasting served 5 ways $69  normally $88 but $38 wine pairing ours included glass wine also  other dinner special which 3 course meal  started off shrimp toast which pretty good salmon dikon salad  came walnuts tasted ones honey walnut shrimp  first course duck table side duck carving prepare wrapped already hoisin sauce cucumbers  delicious    The meal served family style even though ordered seperate tasting menus surprised portions humongous upscale restaurant  I guess used french food where portions elf size   peking duck salad served something gigantic won ton shell  sauce salad very good  Next duck came noodles chinese brocolli then sauteed black bean sauce  thought flavoring pretty good  Chilean sea bass very light large portion  tasting menu also came cocktail lychee martini    I looked original menu impressed served lot seafood sashimi style then 3 different ways  lobster clam shrimp all done way  rare see restaurant does lobster sashimi although  where prices skyrocket $85 lb  Shibuya MGM serves $250    Dessert pineapple cake mango tapioca coconut ice cream  Both very chinese touch classiness  Hmm all all very impressed 2 michelin star place but chinese food fine dining enjoyed it  <EOR> I visited Wing Lei Super Bowl Sunday quite frankly because Michelin Star received 2009  called night before reservation hostess Wing Lei sure let know fantastic restaurant naming all restaurants accolades  Needless say expectations sky high   Before into meat review think important explain why only gave restaurant 3 stars  Given all restaurant's high level achievement rated restaurant against very best restaurants to  quite obvious if rate star Wing Lei against every other Chinese Restaurant United States would give 4 5 stars without hesitation    However said why impressed Wing Lei  Given prestige restaurant found appropriate order tasting menu offered Chef Ming Yu  true Michelin taste distinctly French flair menu left cuisine's Chinese authenticity question  instance first course cold sea food prawn salad served caviar soup dish truffle stuffed wonton soup subsequent dishes included duck wagyu beef short ribs sea bass which all plated presented distinctly Western style  Although tasting menu two people none dishes family style traditional Chinese sense different glass wine served each course  Wing Lei takes hit having French oriented tasting menu  food quite good sea bass especially cooked perfection  However serving French style meal restaurant clearly opened itself different standard service unfortunately falls short book    First foremost taken back Maitre d's lack knowledge even unwillingness explain being served  instance wagyu beef dish served without any explanation  until inquired dish when waiter explained eating beef vegetables  Likewise each wine served very little explanation  typical explanation literally red wine France 1999  desert wine Hungary   Given menu featured dessert white wine Hungary seems clear Chef Min Yu sommolier meticulously chose specific wines accompany dishes  wait staff's lack knowledge regarding both food wine does food justice especially because chef takes audacious uncharted approach serving French Chinese fusion cuisine  restaurant attempts serve food caliber must guide customer through whole culinary experience else customer left confused palate more questions rather pure satisfaction  Ultimately meal left wishing just opted traditional Chinese route which restaurant serves     If decide dine Wing Lei suggestions Forego tasting menu traditional route  Looking other reviews Yelp clear cannot wrong Wing Lei's Peking Duck  You should your way visit restaurant just because received Michelin Star once upon time    After all suspect Wing Lei far superior other high end Chinese restaurants town such Empress Court Caesars Pearl MGM  any case visit Wing Lei certainly mundane experience  If your primary experience Chinese food comes Panda Express expect wowed  If frequent authentic Chinese restaurants forego tasting menu think come away understanding paying generous premium better quality food special occasion  Just don't eat Wing Lei expect among world's best restaurants  <EOR> ok wouldn't necessarily say fan but ate pretty damn good food  authentic place above average if you're okay spending $$$$ chinese food    i'm chinese  paying more $40 chinese dinner really ridiculous  but vegas business since client loves chinese food were  all 16 us   we started off array appetizers  highlights? mu shu vegetable wraps  hoisin sauce came hoisin  maybe hoisin imitator but guess shouldnt surprised  vegetable egg rolls weren't bad but definitely nothing special   next all ordered own entrees  three cup black cod  HIGHLY recommend dish  fish good   think miso black cod but chinese style  also tried lobster sweet sour shrimp vegetable fried rice  everything pretty tasty   for dessert pineapple coconut ice cream concoction  OK    overall place fine  honestly don't think asian people would ever think come here  only tourists westerners would pay top money eat chinese food  wouldn't first choice dinner but hey wasn't paying!   if want find where asian people congregate check buffet lines! <EOR> Although nice decor attentive service food uninspired surprised awarded 1 Michelin star   gave complimentary sweets end meal wait staff attend without being fussy   say prices appropriate level service but wish meal lived level  <EOR> Finally chance try Wing Lei last night    Food very good overall  Highly recommend Imperial Peking Duck deep fried soft shell crab    Service great  somewhat timeline see show worked pace meal perfectly rushed but finished right time    Atmosphere Although recently renovated still felt dated  Almost big open dining room buffet    If set upscale Chinese definitely  worth trying just don't expect much terms ambiance cool factor  <EOR> My review Dim Sum buffet EXPERIENCE Wing Lei puts Chinese New Year!

Tender flavorful Lobster greens without overbearing Yuzu flavor   best things worthy seconds thirds!  Duck Prosciutto Asian Pear  delicious surprisingly good combination sweet savory   Much better initially expected The dim sum choices limited but excellent taste quality ingredients   Examples Shark Fin Dumplings AWESOME   only dim sum choices asked seconds thirds   Lobster Dumplings good but nearly yummy!  Crispy Pork Belly world! skin crisp creme brulee candy coating consistency   BEST far!    The BEST Baked BBQ Pork Bao   very good!  Slightly sweet crumbly top delicious pork goodness inside!  forever compare others example Tea Smoked Duck  Wonderful! much flavor each bite!  BBQ Pork also delicious!  Small portions but big flavor   And tons dessert options   my favorites Crispy Praline Nutella Chocolate Mousse   Couple complaints besides entry price course Wish served melted butter lobster   simply steamed could used bit more seasoning flavor butter   The raw oysters shell sand enjoyable     The scallops good but odd coloring them   sure if  cooked if poor quality   Overall would recommend splurge!
