Love drinks food merchandise etc  happy when Starbucks opened its right church school  building very pretty inside everything working available unlike Starbucks Eastern south location  alone gets three stars   But let now write gets ZERO stars  customer service  first month GREAT! Then ok  great but bad either  Fast forward last week  two vanilla frapachinos kids caramel  every time never issue  pull window waiting waiting then barista starts drinks  only car drive thru busy   As he's making them watching see he them both without caramel  stated caramel charged caramel but no biggie mistake! He eventually opens window starts take card  say sorry tried your attention tell but those should caramel  He looks slams card counter then rolls eyes sighs! REALLY??? He then slams window shut angrily fixes issue  Opens window back gives drinks card no straws  He then realizes he didn't give straws hands then closes window   No thank no sorry mix nothing  Terrible customer service   I tried name but wearing blank name tag  barista grating goatee thanks less stellar service! If happen helped again sure your name  <EOR>
