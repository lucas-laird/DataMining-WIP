Sushi delicious staff always friendly now know boyfriend when show up  Great place! <EOR> The man answers phone horrible attitude  If want Delivary shouldn't advertising so  <EOR> I see people complaining delivery which absolute shame because place great!!!  true gem NW side town NW side sucks big time   You've gotta try stuff tomato best ever!  All menu great!  All staff very kind truly appreciate stopping into shop    I recommend not deliver all you can eat option very well priced sushi place plow down   Cozy atmosphere quiet   Great place date     unless zero game  <EOR> We only ones 6 30 p m  Tuesday night although person did stop roll bar left quickly   My son ordered AYCE very disappointed   rice hard color fish off he experienced before   Except he did say octopus pretty good   I ordered vegetable tempura very good pretty small portion price   half mushroom potato onion ring wasn't even covered batter two other things decent squash something     I also ordered vegetable roll   screw right?  When came table looked great!  Very colorful   But rice thick pasty chef put seaweed into roll good all   Couldn't finish it   I felt bad people worked there   very nice   But food good service marginal being only ones there   Would back   need step sure  <EOR> My husband ordered delivery food arrived time which 1 hr  surprised little more $35 $50 tax delivery tip   Miso soup just good any other restaurant but serving very small  sushi rolls small way overpriced get  shrimp tempura roll nearly good grocery store sushi  also ordered tuna poki fresh  didn't even look red but cloudy dull color  only ate bite spit worried becoming ill  called restaurant tell them tuna bad man phone appeared know any English  helpful  If didn't live 15 min restaurant would taken sushi back show them feeding people inedible  <EOR> Food good staff super friendly plus only charged $5 per kid two four year olds also all eat which much better $16 per kid other places charge kids eat few bites food  Three adults two kids under $81 bad  definitely come again  D <EOR> If avoid sushi restaurant all possible   food just OK overpriced but service worse   dingy old interior rude staff   Friday night around 5 30pm almost empty exception couple seemed dissatisfied  shouldn't tell something??  understaffed unprofessional   Considering many sushi places Vegas stay away one   give them your money   owner also huge a hole   such negative experience place would encourage others eat elsewhere  <EOR> So place under new management pretty good love screaming O salad  first time gave place single star but people very kind last time totally improved mind  come back soon! <EOR> Great food! Great service! Additional $6 all drink draft beer no other AYCE know does that! also fresh wasabi which LOVEEE!!
