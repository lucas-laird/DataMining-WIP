No spices no salt ! Zero salt tasted terrible!   The second thing ordered salt pepper fried shrimp     now Asian decent always ordered plethora Asian Chinese dishes whole life    disappointed absolutely no SALT shrimp mention quality shrimp poor  tasted very old very very fishy tell tale sign old seafood  But honestly advertise dish salt actual name isn't any all??   The pork fried rice actually also no SALT?? Everything most blandest no flavor food ever entire life  Worst Chinese restaurant Vegas    I don't understand Chinese people grew eating Chinese home cooked food could serve kind quality food did grow themselves?!  If eat prepared load your food soy sauce siracha edible most  <EOR> Fast  Tasty  Nice  Exactly looking takeout  We'll going again  <EOR> China GoGo  don't think area needed another Chinese restaurant specially  same others   I hopeful unique experience amazing brew dishes  But same other Chinese restaurant centennial hills   They give big portion  Now don't know if did cause just opened but try them more often since Around corner house   Customer interaction needs improvement  <EOR> I never order place again delivery man extremely rude wanted meet end cul de sac would deliver door called phone twice extremely rude when called restaurant complain delivery driver basically ignored talking another employee while trying explain really bad customer service <EOR> My new favorite  Always hot always fresh  Friendly clean just great atmosphere 3rd trip no problems   <EOR>
