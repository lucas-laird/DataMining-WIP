If expecting noisy traditional dim sum restaurant full almost fights over dishes going disappointed  However lack hostility does take away food being fantastic  All servers very friendly eager explain all dishes carts  Also servers speak English very well also speak least dialect Chinese    I would recommend restaurant anyone curious learn more Chinese culture cuisine world dim sum  <EOR> Second best dim sum Vegas beef noodle second none  chicken stir fry well won ton soup da bestest! <EOR> Best dim sum place ever had    eat every time Vegas    <EOR> Food good used be  siew mai served cold rubbery  not fresh  the waitress told no more when feedback  waited 30mins porridge bean curd  after feedback counter arrived but no longer porridge   <EOR> I come every time Vegas its always treat  never actually ordered off menu just stick dim sum  wait usually pretty long hard flag down waiter for those want order off menu but steamed pork buns chow mein amazing!

Pineapple Beef absolutely NO FLAVOR  terrible actually  don't even think put salt tasteless  pineapple chunks straight can   and probably 99 Cent store  Just plain bad  Noodles average any Chinese restaurant    Towards end meal felt would only come back place Dim Sum but some dinner companions disagreed  did see dishes looked really savory tempting being served other tables  Walnut Glazed Shrimp looked amazing!    The overall consensus may just ordered couple dishes lackluster Ping Pang Pong worthy another dinner experience  Dim Sum first rate know know cook  <EOR> I determined give single star restaurant but wasn't option  Tried 5 dimsum dishes hate them all  <EOR> With many good reviews found prior visiting Ping Pang Pong severely disappointed   Upon arrival long wait approx 25 min led think some place good   All good places lines right?  also many other Chinese other Asian people which would also another indicator   When sat down started getting food bit disappointed   Some food should hot least warm rather cool   best sign   Some food good but having spent over decade San Francisco four years 10 miles east Los Angeles PPP could compare any except lower quality restaurants tried   If want view wrong place because casino right outside restaurant all see  <EOR> You know when most everyone restaurant speaking Chinese something authentic happening!

Ping Pang Pong voted best Chinese Restaurant according Vegas Magazine others alike  Nearly 3 years ago Ping Pang Pong started Dim Sum am wondering why only now just discovered this?

Almost everything very tasty but expect very heavy oily saucy  might thing place great    My only complaint servers always seem bad mood doing favor  <EOR> Wow probably best dim sum restaurants Vegas! restaurant located inside hotel  tried call reservations beforehand because some reviews talked having wait long time  However only accept reservations parties 10 more  group 3 only wait 10 minutes Sunday afternoon   The interior restaurant clean spacious looks new  Once seated immediately 3 carts came able food right away  carts consistently came table never chase anyone down food  Tea $1 per person  food great however dishes little bit more expensive dim sum  example plate egg tarts which cost $4 88 per plate  egg tarts 2 per plate instead 3  Overall highly recommend dim sum restaurant if don't mind spending little more! <EOR> Love!! Chinese favorite food place real treat  made trip strip restaurant glad did! servers some trouble understanding English but sweet didn't matter  potstickers favorite juicy when cut into them splattered all over shirt consider yourself warned  <EOR> The Jasmine tea perfect along side Dim Sum!!

Many other restaurants town fall short authenticity  great restaurant service very attentive!! also loved egg noodles really crisp  spring rolls nice orange beef superb  admit ordered much food take quite lot home couple boxes  Hey but  good thing!!!  <EOR> Have confess wasn't expecting much place its goofy name mention casino  But actually really good dinner food  relatives brought takeout place pretty amazing    Recommendations Chive shrimp cake  surprisingly crisp fresh plenty shrimp   Crispy shrimp stuffed chicken  amazing  While feels bit Americanized Chinese food meat tender light coating sweet garlic based sauce sesame seeds Night market Fried Rice  Strong basil flavor tomato based sauce  Unique definitely different any fried rice had  Yu Hong Yu xiang Eggplant  pretty typical rendition sweet sour eggplant dish nothing unusual     dish needs white rice side    Cons Based menu pricey side is    Can't say anything service dining experience since wasn't actually but food definitely excellent  <EOR> Avoid place   do yourself favor    run another establishment   now   seriously   7 11 17 Tuesday afternoon waiting line least 11minutes     Then team member states she notify front waiting place order   Well honestly don't think happened because took initiative front team members indicate I'd place order   She gives menu indicates dim sum associated letters   Then ask letters indicate?  she hands another menu pictures numbers   ask does work?  Then asked other lady front know much dim sum numbers cost?  She indicates menu dim sum letters invalid   menu pics numbers know much items cost?  She mentions oh just ask me     What?  other words could rip off no basis?    Total wait time + ordering + verifying menu prices etc  = 45min     With said highly recommend revised dim sum menu correct prices displayed customers' establishments' maximum efficiency time ease respect ethics food service management     Plus recommend more staff training accommodating those waiting dine pay bill because observing establishment while waiting service seemed lack communication between team members very obvious no team work lack organization     In conclusion highly recommend general manager staff anyone involved running establishment review training customer service food service management 101 menu development  <EOR> The food good but most Asian restaurants service horrible   twice ask carts over side restaurant   Seems cart pushers now rhyme reason where push carts   kept circling around other side where everyone food already  <EOR> This some great Dim Sum! Everything fresh hot delicious  Service gracious well polite  didn't bad dish  My biggest complaint? Because arrived early seemed only desserts ready those kept coming around quite readily beginning  didn't seem start bringing savory dishes til 15 20 minutes opened  My recommendations? If arrive early patient wait 20 minutes til dishes really start coming out  If then show 30 minutes open just prepared wait  The challenge?

The salt pepper pork chops nothing but fat bone  fried rice basic white rice boiled chicken  No seasonings when asked knife cut off fat waitress ignored 5 min while waiting tables already served many food items way before us  No refill soda until ready leave  Then leaving she decided stand table asking if everything ok?

Revolutionary     Dim sum ping pang pong better most town but best ever but definitely worth try!!! <EOR> Went dim sum today based recommendations friends  wasn't very impressed  good but nothing special am glad didn't when crowded   Food food good but nothing special  only thing thought really good steamed bbq pork buns which really moist  Only thing stuck paper fell apart bit  decent selection dim sum but many  shimp dumplings shrimp rice rolls very flavorful   Service best dim sum service had  carts took while come some carts came more times others  grab servers' attention drink order refills   Price  lot pricier other dim sum places been  paid $45 food would usually cost 26 35 elsewhere    Overall dim sum okay but don't think want back other places go   <EOR> I think should take soft turttle shells  am really ANGRY!!!! that  just wrong  really almost endangered  think food great but just take [ <EOR> Came because told good dim sum places Vegas   honest better   wait time dim sum such chicken feet tripe spare ribs etc took 30mins since seated   tripe spare ribs bland   Only good thing fried rice noodles  <EOR> I really don't know if name restaurant catchy annoying???  let decide that   If Gold Coast past couple years you'll find casino trying attract more more Chinese tourists   Ping Pang Pong able offer locals well visitors taste mother land   means place serves authentic Chinese food   thought amount food price paid equal however even Asians food quite tasty  <EOR> My family LOVE coming here  Hands down best dim sum all Vegas   Ping Pang Pong located inside Gold Coast Casino  restaurant extremely big accommodate large parties pretty easily  Depending day time line pretty long  family usually come weekdays avoid long lines   Food bomb  If only knew names even spell names dishes order  Most time just point want if don't know technically called  few remember would recommend Siu Mai Har Gow Shrimp Ball w Sugar Cane Chive Dumpling BBQ Steamed Bun Coconut Bun Egg Tarts!   The reason why only giving place 4 stars instead 5 because pretty pricy compared other dim sum places   service sometimes bad  <EOR> I harboring some nasty suspicions some time last night think worst fears confirmed  am just regular non ethnic white girl  cannot eat food actually eat Japan China  When am served chicken restaurant cold on purpose yellow still skin chopped bones don't even want take bite Fried pieces pork still fat them appeal me  soup served huge bone tiny scraps meat fat clinging does look appetizing  spirit adventure ate few bites everything wasn't disgusting anything just meh   In fairness Ping Pang Pong also some traditional American y dishes your local Chinese takeout but looking branch try some new things  upset restaurant sure excellent preparation Princess Chicken Salt Pepper Porkchops just aren't me   We also tried singapore noodles which kinda your standard Lo Mein some fried rice which thought really good  final order wrinkled green beans also good  Overall mostly stuck noodles rice    Our 6 dishes 2 drinks ran $80 higher your average takeout place but still reasonable  enough food easily feed 4 people   The atmosphere inside nice kind any casino restaurant between casual fine dining  drawback open extremely smoky Gold Coast casino floor  <EOR> Everything eaten absolutely wonderful! When family comes visit made sure try hit place every single time  food disappoint but service though attentive quite rude mean quite rude! <EOR> 3 5 STARS  Yay! hella Chinesey here!  Normally judge good Asian restaurant amount native diners  Vegas no exception   Ping Pang Pong came recommendation friend lives Vegas but he did warn nearly good dim sum SF     On Sunday 9 11 11 friends came PPP 1 PM  15 minute wait party 7  FIRST thing noticed overwhelming amount Mandarin Cantonese speaking patrons seemed promising   FOOD Ladies push around dim sum carts call dishes Cantonese  more happy show what's inside steamers if don't understand Cantonese   We ordered following some doubles *Hai Gow Steamed Shrimp Dumplings *Siu Mai Steamed Pork Dumplings *Hai Char Siu Cheung Fun Steamed Shrimp BBQ Pork Noodle Rolls *Fung Zhao Steamed Chicken Feet *Ngau Yuk Mai Steamed Beef Balls *Jiaozi Potstickers *Deep Fried Shrimp Balls *Paai Gwaat Steamed Spare Ribs *Ngau Toa Steamed Tripe *Fu Pei Guen Steamed Tofu Skin Roll *Lo Mai Gai Steamed Glutinous Rice w Chicken Lotus Leaf Wrap *Jin Deui Fried Sesame Balls *Char Siu Chow Fan BBQ Pork Fried Rice The only standout dishes steamed tripe which melt in your mouth soft fried rice which al dente which bits rich fatty pieces pork albeit bit greasy    rest dishes mediocre lacked quality ingredients tiny dumplings compared norm and or dry side  But when you're starving there's lack good dim sum options sufficed just fine   S E R V C E Perhaps use rude service Asian restaurants didn't find service PPP even slight bit rude  waiter brought things quickly when asked refilled waters promptly  itself already rarity most Chinese restaurants    A M B N C E D E C O R With name Ping Pang Pong no wonder excudes typical stereotypical dcor Chinese village roof shingles red paper lanterns waitstaff mandarin collared outfits  Most importantly CLEAN!  With plethora dim sum restaurants San Francisco PPP would probably rank 2 5 3 STARS SF  However considering Vegas scant amount decent Asian restaurants left stuffed only $15 person including tip deserve better average rating  <EOR> Some best Dim Sum Las Vegas   better average selection   fresh tastes good  ambiance little off walk through especially smoky casino but worth it   also kind loud when busy   Service bad but appeals usually within 30 minutes  <EOR> My mom took try place out  She said more dim sum selections not    I did place all  Seating sucked if you're right entrance Not lot dim sum selection all either  All carts came around same thing passed earlier  lot food normally eat don't have    Their portion smaller well  most places give 3 egg tarts place gives 2  Same other dishes rice wrapped leaves    Compared DJ Dim Sum Rio place major thumbs down food service sure  Don't think ever come back  <EOR> Coming 626 LA where dim sum places plentiful dim sum place pretty bomb except price  offer all typical dim sum dishes some special ones beef brisket    Pro tip come little before 10 avoid line!

Reservations  Needed!!! <EOR> I'm only giving place such high rating because food which good but service absolutely sucked  Waited line 10 mins before anyone acknowledged line  Another 10 mins before order taken  When did come came incomplete last dish came over 10 mins first dish came out  manageress then tried bullshit saying particular item takes longer cook because needed fry first  She shut when called owned Chinese restaurant before knew into making sweet sour pork  would've rather she just say sorry fucked coming right up  Never try lame excuses customer   guess she feels happens Ping Pang Pong stays Ping Pang Pong  <EOR> It's very decent   wanted check dim sum Las Vegas   came Saturday morning stroke 10 when open number tables already filled   standard dishes including two types jook   left probably hour later same carts rotated around several times   couple dishes brought around trays   variety isn't very large but liked better Five Star Seafood fka New Capital Monterey Park   It's good dim sum fix when Vegas  <EOR> Hands down best dim sum LV   used now Orchid's Garden when still named Chau's then moved Chang's dabbled Cathay House   All restaurants would hover around 3 stars dipped low being inedible depending change chefs perhaps even ownership   Then along came idea trying Ping Pang Pong inside Gold Coast casino   The litmus test dim sum cheong fun har gow oven baked char siu bao chicken feet anything shrimp   While sauce cheong fun very light noodles soft shrimp fresh  har gow skin soft shrimp again fresh   char siu bao right combination sweet salty   Chicken feet soft hard   Did mention shrimp fresh?!  Yes considerably pricier all other dim sum restaurants mentioned but worth it   yes also frigid cold another reviewer said because  casinos keep awake but nothing hot tea sweater can't fix   yes very crowded since actually fairly small dining room dim sum restaurant mention dim sum restaurant casino known its Asian clientel but before 11 30 am you'll fine since most gambling tables sleeping being gambling tables all night  <EOR> Whoa second day row picked place huge crowd wait   I think could've legitimately done without wait  sign pointing waiting area just outside restaurant but didn't seem dedicated host  stood least 5 minutes before even much said hi party front another 5 before seated us  very busy but least should've welcomed pretty sure least couple open tables   By way try park side Gold Coast farthest Rio if want shorter walk which healthier sounds due less secondhand smoke exposure   Anyway any good dim sum place able dive right since carts made rounds quickly  friend started off picks har gow 4 pieces shu mai 4 rather large unfamiliar bowl some sort tripe ginger daikon  later plate shrimp stuffed eggplant pieces 3 some deep fried shrimp balls sugar cane 2 some nice compact egg tarts 2   last item chicken feet friend pining whole time   Everything definitely high end good  All savory items sufficient flavor non mushiness egg tarts very flaky still noticeably warm end meal even though I'd ordered them start  didn't fall love any dish but quality solid overall  Prices probably bit more you'd expect since casino restaurant there's all many dim sum shops here  most likely $5 88 each tripe bowl chicken feet per friend $2 18 order four $2 88 items $3 88 dish  Couldn't tell which which since much dim sum connoisseur sorry!   Overall wasn't blown away any single item but solid dim sum definitely prefer East Ocean which seemed little lacking past couple trips some reason  also definitely appreciated tangerine candy instead fortune cookie looking East Ocean   KJ yet stay tuned case decide hit them up  <EOR> dim sum yay!

Okay yes name pretty ridiculous stereotypical Chinese people but don't let turn off! place pretty legit   A lot reviewers mention wait pretty crazy but came weekdays only never wait table maybe only crazy weekends?  All dishes good but only came dim sum sure but curious other food is   Service decent which used Chinese restaurants good enough me!

Haha  <EOR> My family visits often  love afternoon dim sum  those new dim sum style Cantonese cuisine prepared small bite sized portions food served steamer baskets small plates  nice wide variety selection able eat moment seated  Everything good tea foods desserts  would given Ping Pang Pong 5 stars but customer service below average but contributed language barrier speak Mandarin Cantonese  would still recommend place food experience!

Service pretty horrible too   thought because dumped corner table all time but just think sucks   last time ate last month didn't even all dishes serving utensils before dim sum arrived   took awhile wave down waiter some tea   ordered plate Singapore noodles took forever come well     And random when busy   Saturday no wait   then other times good half hour wait party four   just never know   However since requested back try other dim sum places Vegas again since PPP leaves less happy satisfied  The Big F claims when he without tons stuff coming out!  Maybe bad luck something! <EOR> I say if early near opening probably standing line 20mins so  But say food worth waiting for  number dishes all fairly priced restaurant hotel  four individuals costs each $25 also take account order two chef specials la Carter dish   Therefore food pricey  service say typical any dim sum restaurant  say some popular dishes shuimai running quickly  But say if don't cart send someone another cart retrieve wouldn't wait    Tea also important Dim Sum  Most restaurants tea complimentary  restaurant charged tea per person without giving choice whether wanted tea tea choice  addition tea slightly bland    As Asian American no issue communication  think important share because Vegas place where people come all around world  cart servers workers all spoke English able articulate dishes well enough non Chinese speaking friends understand    Lastly say would highlight shuimai egg tarts vegetarian chow mein BBQ pork buns delicious!  I would come back! <EOR> Very good dim sum prices bad vegas   come back each time visit sure   still craving place when back California tried couple dim sum places they're even comparable   may fly back fix! <EOR> Chinese restaurant inside casino  Food just mediocre  <EOR> Truly authentic Chinese food  tell fact 99% patrons Chinese   big negative ordered water tasted nasty city water  place getting sulch good reviews should filtered water  Large portions  Ordered pork belly stew  While tasty extremely fatty  meat would better if cooked more  <EOR> Finally tried place because friends rave it   and results Mehhhhhhhhhhhh    greasy  I know dim sum greasy its own but wow stuff really greasy   ordered typical dishes shumai hargow chicken feet spareribs shrimp rice noodles many more but nothing really stood outstanding spectacular   rather wait long place prob spend more money just drive down street Chinatown    it'll probably better  but hey say tried place now    <EOR> Authentic food but service mediocre     Dined two friends Saturday evening   Between three ordered 7 entrees 5 which showed promptly but final two  ma po tofu vegetable chow fun showed 25 minutes all other five sitting table even then only we'd flagged down waitress ask status   Another example waitress Ellie's inattentiveness she didn't seem overly busy iced tea glass would sit empty 5 minutes before she someone else would refill it   Chinese restaurants aren't exactly known great customer service   guess  part authenticity place   Another thing though nice unlike many Chinese restaurants place didn't overboard all Chinese artwork other nicnacks most Chinese restaurants feel obligated put up   Once food did show good but good enough want back  <EOR> Food decent but service absolutely worst  never eaten somewhere where 100% staff rude  <EOR> Came Saturday around 12pm family  called 30 minutes before arriving reservation party 11  When arrived seated almost immediately  dimsum delicious very authentic! ordered variety dishes ha gao shui mai BBQ pork bun chicken feet eggplant lotus wrapped rice rice noodle egg tart more!  My favorites Egg tart BBQ pork bun Shui mai  I'm going give place less star because pricier side dimsum  But guess paying better quality food Ping Pang Pong  recommended place all friends coming back soon!! <EOR> True Dim Sum highly recommend when visit Sin City  know authentic when place filled Asians  dishes menu excellent too! Can't wait 'til next visit! <EOR> They don't huge selection Dim Sum  also don't tell advertise menu family style   which would loved known before ordered  Also aren't descriptions menu items  example ordered Broccoli dried fish  expected chunk dried fish cooked broccoli florets rice  huge plate broccoli stems like   5 little pieces shaved dried fish  Also service pretty bad  weren't even busy but ask refills boxes check   maybe its cultural thing? don't know  But  wasn't impressed experience  <EOR> This place small often times requires wait   2nd dim sum place tried vegas disappointed all   Between two ordered bunch traditional dim sum dishes including chickens feet =    came 15 person believe both stuffed!  My favorite dish probably pork preserved egg congee   surprised good was!  Could eaten whole bowl myself   Siu Mai pork dumpling Ha Gow shrimp dumpling satisfies dim sum craving   banana leaf wrapped rice good   tofu skin roll spare ribs also tasted delicious   think Iiked everything except tofu pudding end   definitely tell made some processed powder box   freshly made   Service good   Since place small only many carts pushing around   Some servers nicer others but overall would definitely come back   better Orchid Garden chinatown    Although terrible terrible name its favorite place vegas far   Its located inside gold coast just walk around casino look it   Wait times long during weekend brunch but think its quite worth it   If you've many high quality dim sum places   it won't compare   definitely think SF LA way better spots but live Vegas now beggars can't choosers  <EOR> Surprising haven't tried more dim sum places Vegas but most ones considered some nasty reviews detered going   Ping Pang Pong Gold Coast casino use Boyd comps points which real plus   dim sum tried mostly picked Jane K  really good   sure if hot mustard standard Hawaii available but most diners using chili sauce instead  <EOR> Dim sum essentially Chinese tapas impossible find Dayton OH   such going dim sum Ping Pang Pong priority me   wife previously Ping Pang Pong before its recent renovations   renovated space seemed much larger brighter more open better allow carts move around dining room   definitely thought renovations worked well   arrived restaurant Sunday before 11AM which smart move because 11 30 place packed line formed people waiting in     The dim sum came kitchen fresh hot regular frequency wheeled around dining room small carts   While restaurant may expanded renovated food delicious remembered   Pro tip Larger parties 4 more more optimal dim sum dining party two   However think prices increased more bit since previous visit   Ping Pang Pong legit favorite place dim sum fill when town  <EOR> What's name?  Seems bit racist if ask me  kid  kid    Every person joint Asian   Everyone   may because Gold Coast place nicknamed Pan Pacific friend   literally Asian invasion     So when see all peeps Chinese restaurant Asian  gotta good sign right?    The food good great even   prices extremely reasonable large family style dishes   tried usual offerings including spicy fried rice some serious kick   Loved it   salt pepper pork chops delicious but didn't ton meat them     Minus star wait   Service wasn't great but remember saying   the worse service better food   always applies Chinese food if know it  <EOR> Do even give star? Australia call style dining yum cha     Firstly say kitchen closes 3pm arrived 2pm  dim sum cart came around once then told order menu if wanted more food  service SHOCKINGLY BAD would ask question then ignore answer only ask question again only caught conversation another server only ask question again   I can't even bothered telling all other issues because want clear head space people businesses this   NEXT! <EOR> Came again although little later opening time   Food still authentic really good   few unique dishes time   Kids love place even though actually don't anything else Gold Coast  <EOR> A great dim sum place still using old carts instead ordering off menu  traditional menu items hai gow Siu mai well other old favourites  Being tourist town great but great same value Canada  hope rice noodle dishes kinda hit miss  come again future  <EOR> The BF craving late night dim sum search find serves even small selection throughout day    It's dinner menu but told order dimsum kitchen late night $2 88 each  selection limited depends didn't sell morning  Hey better nothing    the only late night dimsum Kan's closed    We ended getting Shrimp Har Gao shrimp wrapper fine but think wrapper slightly thick  Shumai did version  Something taste just doesn't work just OK   Shrimp cake tasty  panfried crisp inside dense cake shrimp green onion    We also off menu Mapo Tofu $7 95 pretty good  meat sausage flavor which interesting since most just throw plain ground meat  Tofu always noms me   Salt Pepper Pork Chop $9 95 fry light texture nice  Funny salt part name but needed tad more that    I surprised prices  honestly thought would more casino but same pricing some nicer Chinese restaurant Spring Mountain Rd  think very fair priced quality good    The service friendly pretty drinks checking us    Will coming back daytime dimsum    one days we'll actually wake early enough it  <EOR> Not bad all   standard dishes chinese broccoli xiu mai ha cao chicken feet black bean pork ribs steamed bbq pork bun shrimp wrapped thick rice noodle chinese donut wrapped rice noodle all a ok   rice chicken served vertical bamboo cup tasty flavors similar Vietnamese 'com ga' ginger light soy chicken   xiu mai orange yellow 'eggs' which tasted crab innards tomal mustard rich super flavorful   All dumplings packed meat and or seafood lot fillers yay!    only downside offerings limited uninspired just basics   I'd come back if LV craving dim sum   Other important info small establishment push cart servers prices higher CA but definitely reasonable located inside Gold Coast Hotel off Strip next RIo across Palms  <EOR> I'll honest only came dim sum! friend ordered everything $3 menu  some pork bun shumai shrimp ball good  Others say just delightfully adequate! golden sand bun just no taste but before various chicken dishes which really good! recommend!  However service received really slow  must taken nearly 30 minutes dessert check being done dishes but would only setback visiting again! <EOR> By far best dim sum all Vegas  Grades above most SoCal dim sum restaurants  early packed  Everything tasty especially Hom Soi Gok Fried glutinous ground pork ball   sticky rice excellent but unfortunately didn't siu Mai bbq rolls   When chicken feet fresh feet walking into mouth  <EOR> This just became favorite Chinese restaurant Las Vegas  Sea Bass amazing salt pepper pork chop filled spices tasted good but yet oily   Can't wait come back  <EOR> One highlights during recent trip Vegas visiting Gold Coast where tried slot machines came ahead some change   then visiting Ping Pang Pong lunch dinner   PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum some unique items which don't see SCal maybe yet visit ones serve similar dim sum fare   Chill waitresses friendly service more happy show what's those little tins carts    The porridge century old eggs very satisfying half full eating it   Enough century old egg pieces qualify name if know mean   YAY! ? The slow cooked simmered snails $5 88 dim sum menu probably quite common Hong Kong but rare States   Definitely winner   easy taken shell nothing broke off process marvelous!  enjoy doing that!  very flavorful slightly spicy but spicy nice chewiness them   treat!  Good times  The shrimp ball sticky rice variation well known ?????but theirs more vegetable matter less shrimp matter expected   Still good though well egg white dipping sauce     After spotted snails fried shrimp balls sugar cane $5 88 put back burner ended taking them go   Those shrimp balls nothing them snails   didn't taste good when cold probably taste better when freshly made     The disc shaped sticky rice patty lotus seed paste kind mochi snack   sweet but sticky enough   should some go   Can't resist sight any pan fried dumplings I?  Just look pan fried bottoms   case bun perfect but filling needed bigger more substantial more meat   This restaurant shaped right circular floor plan well la rotunda breadbasket mine  decor very Chinese traditional way  ? Encouraged dim sum success thought would try dinner   wasn't particularly inspired porridge abalone $9 99 which didn't much flavor expected   better ones friend's house chucks abalone pieces   But most Cantonese restaurants thinly sliced abalone pieces porridge   Dried abalone some kind delicacy but quality various   Those definitely best had   don't put much there   If read knock off version Sun Tzu Art War take last strategy's number minus 2 dozens  number abalone slices porridge   When having dinner noticed the managers ppl register just let customers waiting door without acknowledging them telling them long wait would  rude  <EOR> While everyone raves dim sum yet try it  tell Night Market Fried rice! Fried rice beef tomatoes bean sprouts Thai chilies  some Vegas weekly magazines some best fried rice Vegas well haven't tried all them but pretty damn good  also love Moo Sho Chicken  didn't even want share  walnut prawns pretty good too  If you're noise sensitive definitely don't want come noise level pretty intense  come back try dim sum see all about  <EOR> Omg  people don't ever eat here    disappointed   If u want dim sum Rio hotel kj restaurant really good cheap     ping pang pong tried  compare  other place  disappointed      expensive taste  nasty  the dim sum suppose hot    But food really cold    don't mind expensive but worst dim sum ever ate     said best dim sum world    fool  you    Don't believe me? try  just item item  kj restaurant u know talking about     still  nasty taste mouth    <EOR> I freaking love place! restaurant located inside Gold Coast Casino     My auntie would always come lunch time  descent lunch menu  All entrees around 6 7$ includes soup rice entree itself    We usually order black bean chicken  Which die for  Really good seasoning sauce  Chinese broccoli really crunchy steamed perfecftion  salt pepper pork chops damn good!  PIang Pang Pong also offers Dim Sum tried couple entrees ok some stuff werent your typical dim sum menu guess added few things since many Chinese customers competitive   I would highly recommend coming during lunch time menu cheap your money's worth pretty good overall   Just expect crowded packed bunch Asians   If expecting business meeting would recommend place LOUD literally screaming aunt all conversations  <EOR> Overrated  Rated best chinese restaurant las vegas 2011? kidding me??

Another problem way bring food if forget something just kind assume still coming don't think ask it  waitress never ordered brisket didn't discover until late   As food itself sister happy duck but didn't try duck thing  orange chicken okay but much better   Obviously being server forgot order entrees going give service very high mark  Additionally atmosphere restaurant really bad  located casino very close all slot machines casino action result very loud  small space try cram many people possible its very cramped uncomfortable   So review food bland but okay service atmosphere sucks if Sunday night and would assume Saturday expect them everything  <EOR> Passable Dim Sum  Probably best Dim Sum Vegas but Western United States  know fair compare LA standards but compared some standard   A lot items cold such XO sauce rice noodles Chinese broccoli  roast pork tasted reheated  Har Gow Shrimp Cheung Fun good  If dying dim sum Vegas place go  <EOR> Good dim sum Vegas  open late  located inside casino which only 4 minutes condo  came around 11 afternoon already line forming   The wait wasn't bad if someone your group wait while gamble lol switch off whenever   The dim sum fresh hot delicious! egg custard dessert really good wasn't overly sweet  only downside ladies pushing carts because took them forever come around restaurant  Other everything fine service friendly  <EOR> Came friend dim sum lunch late Monday morning already packed short line customers waiting   wait 15 minutes before seated table   Service decent 4 5 carts dim sum items choose from   Selection good but quality dim sum both good bad   Good good great dishes enjoyed didn't wow tremendously   bad dishes unfortunately left lasting impression   included following Roast Pork Though skin rather crispy tell color texture meat reaheated   fresh despite fact cart lady chimed roast pork just came oven fire  Siu Mai steamed dumplings traditionally made seasoned ground pork shitake mushrooms shrimp   no shrimp some siu mais prepared way where couple them dense dry hard chew  Chinese Broccoli dish broccoli thick ones other dish   Chinese Broccoli grows older stalks thicker inside turns translucent tender white old    needed some greens balance meal tried this   Aside issue age broccoli used preparation fine   But older broccoli harder chew through awfully fibrous  XO Sauce Pan Fried Rice Noodle Rolls Seasoned well but could used more XO Sauce give spicy kick   problem dish last type cart uncovered must sat cart awhile   cold flavorful cold rice noodles dry harden   Best ask test temperature plate dish more exotic dim sum dishes served figure if relatively fresh if sitting around while   Prices higher expected since hotel restaurant   other dim sum palaces Vegas probably won't back   OK good but better  <EOR> Ping Pang Pong!!!
