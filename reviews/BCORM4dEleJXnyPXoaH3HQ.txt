Nothing great nothing special but bad either  <EOR> I Giovanni's first time because friend coupon Entertainment book  gotta say place real dive but staff friendly food cheap to moderately priced    We ordered garlic balls appetizer just because name funny pass them up   did them ALL  just balls bread possibly olive oil them tasted garlic powder fresh garlic   Even brownish sauce accumulated underneath balls didn't taste great  two companions thought ok although noticed wouldn't eat them without dousing each piece parmesan cheese   That should warned but ordered pizzas anyway happy   ordered 6 meat pizza Giovanni's Favorite garlic pizza minus spinach but extra garlic   meat pizza all right great but good enough come back   As garlic pizza come Ohio where Cap'n Tony's sells best garlic pizza ever know good garlic pizza  Theirs only bad example garlic pizza wasn't even good pizza bland tasteless blah  could see extra garlic it basically looked came jar minced garlic although doesn't mean was but pizza just wasn't flavorful   thought might forgotten put seasoning but no waitresses assured way always is  waitress tried convince pizza just dry because no spinach but hadn't even complained dry  complained no flavor     My friend gave waitress run money attempt salvage terrible garlic pizza but restaurant wouldn't replace waitress called friend aggressive process   She did add some ingredients help taste but since coupon free restaurant wasn't inclined help out   confrontational person just wanted actually felt bad waitress because hard middle something but sure did hate pizza    So place may its following staff actually friendly despite disagreement but liked neither decor nor pizza won't back   Only star me  <EOR> I ate previous Giovanni's couple times maybe 3 4 years ago ok but good enough order regularly   decided give them another try reading under new management food much improved   pretty much only place know delivers good pasta great sauces believe homemade unlike typical canned crap most pizza places   employees all very friendly   My only complaint pizza pretty average   I'd eat again but didn't feel lived same standard set other dishes  <EOR>
