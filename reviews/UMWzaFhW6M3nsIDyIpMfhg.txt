Okay let's stop Little Dumpling place   Pull into especially dingy looking shopping strip   Husband notices actually Peruvian Chinese fusion just regular Chinese   He takes gamble says place probably good   Wife sleep deprived hungry put fight   Looking back she ever glad she let herself talked into place   Apparently Chinese population ended Peru sometime WWII happens pretty much anywhere Chinese people immigrate created fusion cuisine   American Chinese Peruvians Peruvian Chinese  American Chinese isn't authentic Chinese but very very good open minded     We started order Yuca la Huancaina fried strips yucca cassava topped very slightly spicy bright yellow sauce   host waiter owner's son told sauce made peppers dairy based but pretty sure also egg yolks it   way absolutely heavenly     We also ordered Tallarin Chino Chinese noodles topped vegetables usually made meat but accommodated us    They're served gingery garlicky black bean sauce taste much mei fun lo mein those squiggly thin egg noodles sometimes Thai restaurants   also ordered Pescado lo Macho which supposed very spicy but which made mild us   crispy fried fillet bass served tomato pepper sauce thickened cornstarch   Also delicious   Loved place much back week half later just ready leave town   especially love desserts   best alfajores sandwiched butter cookies dulce de leche filling   Also Chicha Morada missed   traditional Peruvian style punch made blue corn pineapple juice lime juice few other ingredients delicious refreshing   believe traditional way drink alcoholic but version not  <EOR> It long ago far away when first tried Chifa read Chinese Peruvian food   Then prepared loving mother closest girls couldn't wait over house when knew mom making some famous food    Flash forward Peru where chance authentic Chifa restos enjoy culinary blend two otherwise different cultures  word Yum!   So when found Little Dumpling prided itself its Chifa Las Vegas couldn't wait try it! Aguado de Camarones a cilantro based soup loads goodies Papas la Huancaina potatoes egg cheese sauce smothered top add spicy kick try folks' homemade spicy cilantro sauce steamed fish excellent  great seafood fried rice the seafood rice deep fried dish tasted heavy very oily   All all excellent meal cozy no frills environment  yes serve Inka Cola  Love it  <EOR> This place could great really   Unfortunately place rather unattractive decor sparse forgettable only sounds people talking annoying television waitress shy very talkative wasn't great helping decide get   The menu rough looking nothing describe food all doesn't really appeal first timer Peruvian food   lacks polish good restaurant really     The food ask?  Decent   food menu just bunch names those names relate food all mystery uninformed ask your server   stated earlier server forthcoming explanations just pick whatever thought sounded nice   Chinese lackluster fact little more pricey other Chinese only places   Don't come that   Peruvian food more character but even hit or miss even worth time effort   Suggestions improvement?  need put bit more capital into decor take TV lower amount light indirect lighting   Drop Chinese completely change name exotic Peruvian sounding name   Play your uniqueness you'll much better attention   If feel must Chinese food due Chinese immigrant influence Peru's cuisine then add Asian Influenced something otherwise Peruvian menu   Add some photos dishes well description each every item   non Spanish speaker food menu might well gibberish   This could've great but stands kind dismal worth your time  <EOR> This place hole wall   but aren't all best ones??!?  When lived Vegas ONLY authentic Peruvian restaurant   lomo saltado delicious! jalea aji de gallina chaufa   almost all items portions generous  alfajores lucuma ice cream simply little piece heaven! <EOR> I never Peruvian food before going eat small joint  decorations pretty sparse but interesting  also interesting serve Chinese Peruvian food  don't know much Peruvian food but dish meat gravy French fries rice all plate  wife eaten twice enjoyed both times  <EOR> Small little hidden place but worth try    When visited Peru amazed many Chinese restaurants were  returning States really missed because different flavor Chinese food use to  Well Little Dumpling Chinese Peruvian really good Chinese food Peruvian Food awesome well  Definitely worth try  <EOR> One day crazy day work where worked 31 hours day  mom happens call ask if want food said tired move  She says well pick we'll Peruvian place  Off admittedly tired self tries small talk  end Little Dumpling  place mostly empty    party four leaving table another table clearly just left too  it   ?  So sit down wait menus drink orders  kid comes says he'll right heads into back restaurant into kitchen area  Great  wait  wait  wait some more  He emerges menus ten minutes later asks we'll drink  Inca Kola course  Then he takes orders plenty time decide wanted while waited    We finally food pretty good  Nothing amazing but wasn't poor mood  parents happy food though was  But all agreed portions generous pretty good deal  parents would rated place four stars value alone though give three yes value but $ 89 cheeseburger    but  why came here!  During hour other two tables never cleared  sat whole time while kid served food chilled kitchen  Another family walked walking seemed know kid worked there  asked sister mom something he seemed happy see them  bet didn't wait ten minutes menu    <EOR> We found place off LV local rag  interesting fact place served Peruvian Chinese food  real kick but truly Chinese    This only second experience Peruvian food first being Inka Grill Costa Mesa  ordered lomo saltado something thoroughly enjoyed before did disappoint time either  remembered being served potatoes but asked them omitted  Extremely flavorful onions tomatoes though cut beef used good IG but also 5 bucks cheaper   I very curious first time trying Peruvian food reminded Chinese food but now researching  realized HUGE Chinese presence Peru which reflected cuisine  famous Peruvian dishes chaufa which version fried rice  did order though   The other dish Aji Pollo which very mild chicken curry  miracle green sauce which everything taste great pretty good although texture bit weird  But lil guy said green sauce wasn't flavorful nor spicy Inka Grill   Run Peruvian family son takes order serves while mom other family members kitchen preparing  place small traces Peruvian Chinese decorations  hole wall but gem nevertheless  <EOR> The BF drove Little Dumpling pleasantly surprised see restaurant advertising Peruvian food   little jaunt Peru couple months ago wanted see Little Dumpling offer!  Little Dumpling serves two types food Chinese Peruvian   You'll find two separate menus really two restaurants one   you'll definitely notice Chinese influenced Peruvian food since there's decent amount Chinese immigrants Peru   Going staple BF ordered Lomo Saltado $9 95    decided bit adventurous Cau Cau de Pollo $9 00 which seemed chicken yellow curry   BF liked Lomo Saltado because french fries still crispy tasted pretty good   chicken dish pretty basic dumping lot green sauce there   Both generous orders bit pricey opinion   BF asked if served quinoa but waiter looked he didn't know talking about   Oh well   figure better ask if serve cuy alpaca then!  The cool thing serve Inca Cola!  comes cans though but bring straight back Peru when taste sweet yellow stuff   Service pretty slow   weekday around dinner time   customer finishing few people come orders   ask waiter couple times take box leftovers took awhile these  We rush 'cuz flight catch! Overall satisfied curiosity Little Dumpling serving up   Peruvian menu isn't English good luck that   Maybe ceviche might worth checking out? Pics beef chicken dishes posted business profile! <EOR>
