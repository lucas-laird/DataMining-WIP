The Wal Mart Pho establishments opinion  And  being generous  Came tonight Sunday around 8 30pm less half empty   Took over ten minutes just greeted   ordered Appetizer Egg Rolls   Which came extremely overcooked   asked server if soy sauce since most places already table she said yes just stared blankly   said well some please?    She left eventually came back 5 minutes later   Boyfriend Steak Pho which he said tasted pretty bland   Me Vegetable Pho extra veggies   Broth very sweet pretty gross   tried adding soy sauce jalepenos pepper anything everything edible which didn't help   only veggies soup baby corn cauliflower broccoli carrots mushrooms   Cauliflower? Really?  No bok choy no cabbage   Needless say VERY disappointed   Being vegetarian having eaten countless pho places sorry even ordered it   Daughter Kid's Meal chicken nuggets fries   She no complaints but then again she eats cooking   very easy mess up   Service Polite first   Gentleman took order delivered entrees nice   Orders correct   Then he disappeared no service whatsoever throughout entire meal   finished eating waiting ask container check over 15 minutes   young lady appeared asked table next that came us if needed anything just finishing up   asked container lady took soup box didn't even look way   sure she missed because basically sitting right top them   5 minutes later she brings them box check walks away   boyfriend literally yell excuse even acknowledge existence   asked container check which she brought relatively promptly   THEN    cashier she THEN informs cash only    thought boyfriend's head going spin around point   SERIOUSLY??!  day age doesn't accept cards any kind?? While boyfriend ATM least looked around any signs stating cash only   ONE  tiny single sign stuck bottom window kitchen    it   know just case kitchen workers forget can't use card    Fortunately boyfriend doesn't pay any ATM fees due military debit card   pay fee though would problem   rating part but just case enjoying rant below tell farm animals sitting all around us     Tables very close together couple seated table next table 4 server purposely put menus opposite end table give room   Nope   move over right next pretty much sitting laps   wait food chick next starts playing videos phone FULL VOLUME loud can't carry conversation   Didn't help music blaring restaurant also   Then group 5 adults child probably 4 years old seated behind us   all start hugging aisle they've seen each other decades just continue stand talking while kid runs all over place   Keep mind restaurant very small   finally sit down talking loud making much noise would thought home own dining room   All while completely ignoring kid she takes ALL chopsticks not wrapped plastic plays them before putting them back again   Gross   Table next gets food chick next slurping soup louder any CHILD EVER would   ridiculous   seriously began think hidden camera show Punk'd something   All around very painful visit beginning end  Rant over  <EOR> Really disappointed today   Everything started off great until when asked bill   some reason don't give bill here   finished meal father asked see bill waiters response don't trust huh?

Also kids chicken tender meal which suppose come soda didn't til ate because waiter forgot  Ended taking drinks home  waiters r friendly just forgetful  So guess we'll eating any other pho place because only didn't chicken based soups veggie based soups  <EOR> I ate two weeks ago last minute  ordered pho vegetables tofu only  came marginally hot  looked sketchy surprised didn't sick   turns off place cash only  reminded another pho place no sign debit card minimum  Since no cash pointed ATM onsite charged fee owned restaurant  convenient  all Pho places run this? <EOR> the good decent a ok book  however ambience hell lot nicer bathroom actual restaurant  minus star one  <EOR> It's nice they're neighborhood but pho just blah  need flavor soup noodles damn it  rice use bird seed couldn't eat finish meal  <EOR> Being service industry stickler when comes good service people Jenni Pho deliver   quick attentive friendly   never once ask refill water which pet peeves restaurant   Granted service isn't everything     The menu limited especially pho joint but did enjoyed The pho tai rice noodles rare steak    quantities huge wish would give portion choice small large      The place clean well lit parking issue   would definitely place again  <EOR> Good food  exactly u expect Pho place    Good potstickers eggrolls! <EOR> We ordered pho tai nam   Big bowl generous meat portions   lot fat meat  Flavor good but remarkable   Also boba  three price two  ordered two Thai tea milk tea  tasted both flavors   Also good but remarkable  drank brought other two home froze them later   glass window into kitchen watch  Would eat again if area but would drive across town again Jenni Pho  <EOR> Their food services bad but great  Just remember CASH ONLY restaurant  Unless some cash use ATM machine inside restaurant but fee!!!

Ladies working smiling came back refill waters often   The service made great impact pretty decent bowl pho  If live Southwest pho craving check Jenni Pho! <EOR> Very disappointed service  If employees don't want working until 10pm then suggest closing earlier finding different employees  approached front 9 30pm asking drink to go two employees chuckled rolled eyes bc she back up  Throughout dinner constantly waive attention since hadn't checked even asked order  only 3 tables seated time  <EOR> Very clean friendly staff great service food better most places to  Definitely come back recommend fit ends family  <EOR> Im sad didnt take pictures!!

Anyways broth flavor wasnt watered down anything great   pho came big plate veggies accompany your soup   sad no culantro which first time ever pho restaurant having it     Other service good food good! price also reasonable pleasent experience  <EOR> Food decent better  location receiving just 2 stars because CASH ONLY  small sign entrance where eye level realize accept credit card!   They should bigger sign customer service BEFORE ordered possibly let know CASH ONLY instead ate ready pay credit card!!!!!!!!!!!   But gave them second star just because let leave just copy dr lic pay next day  <EOR> I LOVE place!! located west side South Rainbow Robindale Windmill area  coming years   staff very friendly years  hoping means owner good staff members treating hard labor work respect appreciation  Keep excellent work Jenni Pho!!

Other times when people regulars service portions great  Playing favorites restaurant isnt me  <EOR> This place unsanitary! During last two times place encountered cockroaches around dining area DISGUSTED  am quite sure kitchen infested cockroaches if cockroaches dining area  unsanitary places because show clean food prep is  recommend going here  <EOR> Ok food great definitely best pho places southwest side town  atmosphere also really good very clean nicely decorated  server Kevin probably friendliest person world  He rubbed off made day! only reason don't 5 stars because cash only situation  2015 owner needs real unless something sketchy going on   Such inconvenience <EOR> Not bad pho  little slow kitchen kinda skimped basil but more happy bring more  2pm Thursday only 3 tables open  liked build your own pho  Very fresh  We'll back more   other reviews staff crew today very polite extremely attentive  soon realized drink LOT water before emptied glass  <EOR> Lately weather Las Vegas chilly If weather gets really cold always craving some good Pho  Well couldn't stop thinking all day work grab bowl Pho other day @Jenni Pho  am least picky eater all honesty although can't something salty particularly  only thing won't eat now black licorice haha   Anyways what's secret recipe good Pho?? broth beef bone sack magical herbs broth? once read Vietnamese food cook book mentioned beef bone its relations period temperature cook  guess takes good amount time good Pho am pretty sure only Vietnamese mom generations cook best Pho   I usually  'Pho Tai Nam steak Flank $6 25'  always give enough beef good temperature broth  broth nice deep flavor tastes very clean spite its cloudy appearance  usually put lot bean sprouts always very fresh Thai basil leaves little bit jalapeno pepper slices lime wedge  Just having simple Pho being able customize tastes fun moment all! P always kindly ask server bring small side dish sliced onions   As soon she puts sliced onion table lightly sprinkle red hot chilly paste top onions  way enjoy Pho can't bowl Pho kimchi right? P   very happy Pho accompanied plate heaped high instant onion pickle created At end always kill soup   leaving bowl empty     Overall Jenni Pho clean good size  parking lot no hassle good Vietnamese restaurant great addition southwest area  Perhaps complaints slow service often restaurant relatively busy night lot customers  <EOR> This another spot totally convenient minutes place  pho good bonus crab rangoon appetizer menu since won't find many Vietnamese joints    The pho only good amazing service lacking time time  Hence 4 star rating 5    Just today stopped finished eating just sitting playing iPhone she cleared everything off tables including drinks  Kind play your phone somewhere else white boy! Haha! thought funny though    Honestly though mostly top game service  serve turn tables quickly  place sit chat friends  <EOR> I'd give more stars because clean modern decor convenient location but when spoiled other pho places town just left unsatisfied!
