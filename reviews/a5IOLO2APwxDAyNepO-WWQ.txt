Brand over priced takeout Mexican food  tacos home next Tuesday  <EOR> Laurita's     place GROSS!! even 5 min wanted throw up  believe second things made fresh  Maybe days old food serving  don't know anyone else but would rather wait 10 minutes three tacos if meant great savory fresh cooked meat  boyfriend California Burrito he literally threw up  Yup don't stomach kind food  live Mexican hey Im Mexican but food no go  <EOR> It's now Laurita's Taco Shop  Roberto's well know sight Las Vegas  location fairly new usually clean  staff friendly food good prices affordable   I'm sure happened but name location now Laurita's Taco Shop but everything else still same  <EOR>
