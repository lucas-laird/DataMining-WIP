I dined because reviews about com other various sites   Boy let down   food wasn't nearly good reviews said   saying horrible   the food just wasn't worth price admission   If want Chinese food drive over Spring Mountain area eat real Chinese Restaurant  <EOR> Let preface review saying Vegas hasn't really made fan am extremely hard eateries especially when look much adequate meal costs!   However pleasantly surprised Chinois    We elected share multiple dishes exception pot stickers being greasy side enjoyed dishes which included good variety options such  chicken lettuce cups korean bbq ribs     I'm sucker desserts Chinois did dissapoint  shared fifteen layer red velvet cake passion fruit three ways  never dessert where each member party couldn't decide which dessert better  both delicious well prepared beautifully displayed    If want low key but satisfying dining experience midst craziness Strip very good option  <EOR> This place hit and miss whole way   Calamari well cooked but wasn't good value considering little got   other hand pork potstickers very plump delicious   Special fried rice general tso's chicken good but pretty standard   Desserts very tasty   Service better I'd expected reading other reviews   won't back but didn't hate place  <EOR> When little remember being told much salt bad you   don't remember why but think came FDA some other governmental agency   scientist always curious read reports myself least determine where funding came but tell truth lazy   Later told salt larger quantities fact bad originally determined when accompanied proper hydration   no evidence but think reports probably funded Wolfgang Puck conglomerate!  Jaysus!  still trying hydrate myself meal Chinois   Originally thought food OK but retrospect food actually only little better cafeteria food   better quality food Wolfgang Puck Express   sushi roll almost flavorless even unagi avocado special meaning oddest shade gray sauce top   Even pork spareribs lacking flavor   did taste hint Chinese flavors but only hint   degree stickiness ribs would expect abundance flavor but sadly case   sign front say Chinese Fusion but quite sure fused perhaps little bit crappy cuisine   With tax tip spent almost $50 appetizer sushi roll cocktail!  say bet big win big Vegas but just LOSE VERY BIG Chinois   two stars great service bar guy tasty cocktail  <EOR> My work hosted prix fixe dinner private room upstairs  Started off passed appetizers tiny poke tuna bits fried won tons veggie spring rolls tiny open burgers all very good  During dinner salad very good followed excellent crab risotto  Dinner choice between fillet mignon fish miso cold soba noodles  fish which far worst four courses fish salty which saying lot since food salty just didn't well cold noodles  Thankfully dessert form chocolate heaven think large decadent kit kat saved rest meal    Overall pleasant surprise wouldn't mind going back  However many good restaurants try Caesars don't know repeat visit without trying those other places first  <EOR> Much better sushi elsewhere   wary eateries try combine Japanese Chinese cuisine   Won ton soup sashimi?  horror  <EOR> We seated pretty quickly but then feeling forgot us   Eventually waiter came ordered    food good little better your normal fast food Chinese take but service price atmosphere didn't really meet expectations  <EOR> RIP  Closed thank god    Ate again July friends request once more food totally forgettable    Hope something much better! <EOR> PUKE! Times two   I agree Ellis below $30 Panda Express but least Panda your water doesn't taste dishwashing soap your food mush tofu     Drinks sucked wine menu medicore food   for price should just gotten fancy meal Del Taco    PUKE  <EOR> OK hate PF Chang's begin feeling place going down cuisine history no go   Boy right   started off Cosmo which more Nause mo   watered down funky tasting before dear waiter car salesman former life could take moment listen drink change he brings back another   Well alcohol alcohol needed lot moment indulged   I hard time deciding country Asia wanted dine decided hedge bets maki firecracker shrimp   wish would ordered more maki instead side edamame coworker did because spicy sauce firecracker shrimp tasted more maple syrup anything   Blech     maple syrup bok choy   Some people claim bees knees but next day ready fall knees in front porcelain god no less  <EOR> I think if ONLY order appetizer chicken salad plenty meal you'll leave fully satisfied!  cashews large pieces white chicken meat awesome greens rockin' dressing it? all only $10  did venture other entrees once only venture right back other entrees expensive small aren't especially special  appetizing     It bit PF Chang like  Service slow even when aren't lot customers  <EOR> Love take Chinese food!
