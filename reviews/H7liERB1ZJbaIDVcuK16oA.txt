Especially Las Vegas   This restaurants food geared towards certain region Mexico its food  fact your quesadilla flat because thats way its made region its some fast food restaurant  reason your tacos looked cat food because carne called carne desebrada shredded meat  mean presentation where looking for? Flat plain looking robertos taco shop neon colored dell taco food?   I feel lot Mexican American people born Las Vegas really need fine tuning Mexican heritage boot camp course Mexican region  Everyone born lacks lot own culture just intermingle turn everything into mush  am pretty sure if invited Mexican person Mexico visiting complain quality meat  But thats because meat fresh same day  Americas meat expected lot more put into storage supermarkets restaurants  Don't just come judge places previously ate called Mexican Restaurants   Las Vegas seriously needs better Mexican food  Most them suck      Anyway ordered myself burrito al pastor  meat damn good! think only other al pastor meat beats would Tacos Azteca Tropicana Nellis  oes down this    Al pastor meat 1 Tacos Azteca 2 Casa Tlaquepaque 3 El gordos tacos  meat great! wish could tastes beans rice separately but did not  am big rice fan all  But meat really took command burrito  burrito done quick! definitely enjoyed location because inside really reminded lot restaurants down there  Just simple color scheme design simple  name also grabs your attention  food looks exactly pictures  <EOR> Being Jalisco place comes pretty close!
