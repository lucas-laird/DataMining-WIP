I hosted birthday party friend here  staff very effiicent nice when getting all details ready party  food great    No any complaints hookahs ran bit quick but hookah man came around relit them  recommend sitting outside misters  food bit pricey   but extremely expensive   would again  <EOR> the place looks great  nice atmosphere chill relax in  HOWEVER service worst ive very very long time  hostess seated outdoor section took first drink order set hookah which awesome but end it  didnt waitress until approached hostess originally seated asked if would getting waitress  point drinks empty 20 minutes  waitress then came over took drink order took another 15 minutes them us  next round drinks bar myself because waitress busy sitting down talking some other staff  top horrid service drinks exceptionally watered down  All all nice atmosphere enough encourage back  <EOR> After reading all negative reviews am beginning wonder if good experience completely abnormal   Whether case actually very good time here  somewhat early around 5pm seated promptly  server very friendly helpful gave good recommendations knowledgeable  menu  drinks fantastic especially enjoyed Shiva delicious! bad spot process changing drinks menu didn't some ingredients drinks listed  However offered substitute very enjoyable    I little nervous being Hookah Lounge since can't stand smell smoke but thankfully all hookah kept outside until 11 allowing enjoy meal drinks relatively clean air   The only other complaint chairs  Kinda uncomfortable bit unwieldy sit in    We definitely back hope experience lives first time! <EOR> Alex mesmerized hypnotic lights compelled dance seat new age techno ambience relaxed strong well mixed drinks impressed themes peace acceptance   until last few visits   Now every time told several things want available  extremely over iced drinks  waiters bar tenders attitudes  just same any more  food still tastes phenomenal hookahs great mixes  But last time some friends town such horrible service call owner Z  Luckily he cool bought shots hookahs but   geez hard check your attitude door when your restaurant big paper mache tree centerpiece?  Tip Firewater Hookah  Try if go   Angel Good food well most nights is  Depending your server house bartender night your experience range ultra sub par pretty decent  menu seems change every night  unfortunately many substitute options certain meal ingredients  instance marinara used place alfredo if dish calls it  o When comes ordering drinks if certain ingredient missing your choice simply order drink  If drink calls blueberries but fruit available house simply allowed order drink  Even if fruit just garnish  only annoying think bartenders don't understand concepts customer service  may main reason Nu Sanctuary ghostownish even weekends  Eh   better  MUCH better  <EOR> Great chill place especially Wednesday night  Great vibe  <EOR> Another reviewer site said its worth repeating really WANTED place    hookah passable although think several better places smoke   food very good but portions minuscule!  every time service    While every server bright friendly just can't seem perform   Being understaffed irrelevant if still understaffed 4th visit then something wrong     possibly giving place 4 chances     To top off auto grat'ed 3 top tonight!  Fastest way loose tip entirely auto gratuity particularly when service poor   Folks want Nu!  really do!  But making easy!  While hope thru winter holding breath  <EOR> F'cking Sux!!!! If score 10 place top list! restaurant bar definitely Night  Club!!! Took them 20min tell 80% martini don't know over own martini menu    This opening NIGHT!!! Then    Finally 1 bartender made signature drinks Pear Asia but tasted puke    then asked change  Markers Rock she gave attitude said don't know want like!!!??? WTF    !? shame Called Hollywood Scene being said that  lived LA 26 years    never seen any place this!!! <EOR> My boyfriend Nu several times  always mediocre service best  last time against better judgement complete mistake  movie sold decided come smoke some hookah    First walk see hostess sitting down bra hanging texting  stood few minutes before she even acknowledged us  extremely disrespectful  work job where customer service everything start night made question even walking in  she asks if dining smoking hookah  say hookah but might want eat  She starts take outside without saying anything ask if sit inside instead  She tells can't smoke inside until ten  am confused now because all three times smoked inside before ten  decided rules might changed suck even though its cold  asked if could closer fires she seated across fire since another group sitting it    After ten minutes waitress finally shows asks want  tell several times wanted peach flavored hookah  ordered diet pepsi cheese pizza without tomatoes boyfriend water  She brings diet pepsi which disgusting  couldn't even drink more sip because tasted horrible  boyfriends water came tiny cup made plastic  felt heap dinner instead nice hookah restaurant paying for  $4 00 disgusting soda pretty ridiculous    After another 20 minutes waitress comes back ask if going hookah  obvious she forgot instead telling she forgot she said yeah theres lot other people waiting  She then hookah guy right front told him  laughed off pizza ten minutes before hookah  own own hookah thought quite sad because pizza should take longer hookah bowl make  hookah guy completely quiet  Never asked if needed anything if hookah okay  actually ask fix it  He didn't say anything completely rude  ignored thinking maybe he's having bad night  said thank he just walked away   We then ask if moved fire because group gone waitress tells its fine switch tables  waitress asks if pay bill because she needed close all tabs  thinking okay she wants tip before shift ends thats fine  say okay we'll take check ask more water  She never brought water saw later on  felt she rushed no reason she never came back ask if needed anything else  She then seated group four TABLE! ANGRY  felt intruded upon  could let employee seat two groups together? boyfriend sitting table smoking hookah four other people crowd around next sitting US  am disgustingly horrified  honestly cannot believe anyone would let happen business   I left hostess alone texting bra hanging completely unprofessional  ignored waitress couldn't order  also ignored rude hookah helper did service us  ended having 20% gratuity added bill hookah service which did receive  But absolute last straw disrespectful waitress closed tab fast possible then used table seat other guests  cannot believe horrible customer service received would compensated  did pay $45 dollars $7 automatic gratuity no reason  <EOR> Very slow service   don't eat   pO Yu <EOR> We ended early dinner default     We originally intended Caña but ended leaving since very unhappy hostesses inhability seat proper table    Anyhow  came Nu very happy did    The food very good service even better    We started tuna tartar chicken wings  Both very good    For second course filet mignon cooked using sous vide technic which gave most wonderful texture already tender piece meat  very impressive  also ordered lamb tagine served tzatziki best tzatiki is  lamb stewed 24 hours which course turned meat fork tender     I ordered bread pudding caramel sauce  Next time ask extra sauce  thought enough it  Probably because wished caramel running through veins love much   As wrote above food very good each traditional dish done bit twist  being cooking method complementary surprise ingredient would expect plate    Enjoy! <EOR> I would agree lot reviews service  Really sub standard  server actually very cocky  Really close annoying rude   The Food    Pierogis OK some caviar it    Flatbread pizza Truffle Oil decent thin crust had great crust  Scallops borderline BAD!!

Words cannot express appaled was!!! las t chance  excited Nu Sanctuary Lounge open but sad say definitely returning advise everyone pour your hard earned money into establishment does appreciate your business!!! Everything experienced boils down tell immediately VERY poorly managed  Someone great idea but completely failed running business  <EOR> First thought lounge all right UNTIL gave free shots   YES FREE!! OK each but shot free    It pricey but first time didn't know expect  food pricey but nephew said burger delish  girls group said hot wings good  can't tell if not  but ice cream sandwich yummie    Service off great  But most time good  But did seem come more  guess happens when your closest end table    Looks pretty cool inside  Music bumpin crowded 11pm <EOR> Now Town Square many times  Attending Blue Martini BM Cadillac Ranch mostly  never leave thinking won't back  Well left NU Sanctuary feeling would never back but decided just call management morning see if could take away bad feeling upon leaving   The night started well  NU website hookah $20 $10 refills thought great discount compared BM decided hit new place husband  came weren't greeted but decided just patio area seat  Once seated promptly greeted waitress brought menu also made great suggestions  first glance menu noticed hookah priced $30 $15 refills   Well said already really wanted hookah decided stay  Also menu states spend $50 if only 2 guest  never seen before menu life but figured hookah $30 drink $24 NU Confessional which great would spending $50 minimum  promptly brought drinks also hookah  When did hookah just dropped off  He didn't ask if knew use even tried sure worked like most hookah place do   agree other reviews hookah did burn very quickly but husband having great time decided refill  second refill better because Hookah guy keep coming changing coals making sure worked properly    At 2am asked server bill where great night turned bad  given bill 20% gratuity already placed bill  Now last checked  done parties 2! Also know suppose tip your waitress waiters but gets tell in recession none less much am suppose tip server  wasn't told would protocol waitress said automatically charged when order hookah sit table  thought myself suppose stand hookah?  if came only cash pay hookah drink then what?! am saying cheap but people please recession hard earned money should towards something want happen something business thinks should put end bill because want to    I paid bill called NU next day   only your prices website different then when but also nothing menu states parties 2 would pay 20% gratuity! Well again where bad worst  managers name off website called lounge  manager happen pick explained happen  explained good time lounge everything nice  said didn't complain when prices hookah different then site but 20% gratuity party 2 just little two much  He did first apologize getting correct information but then into telling Vegas nightlife suppose paid  Maybe he's aware Vegas night life but never husband and least 4 times month pay gratuity just two  tip well but 20% steep 2 us  explained weren't told he over talked basically opinion didn't want fix problem  See customer service over 15 years way he treated over phone shows why all bad reviews here  feeling into arguing match over phone asked if anyone higher then because felt he wasn't taking feeling into consideration  Your business advertises website totally different price then menu feel misleading  Also your servers don't let customers know 20% gratuity  good business understand new business you're just getting your feet wet but why should your customers pay it! When did ask someone over he said he manager it! said see there's director well  He said he didn't know director could he couldn't said return money  20% gratuity $10 more pay hookah  If getting bad customer service wanted compensated it! He did say he would return gratuity trying feel bad taking server  explain didn't feel bad because she worked company didn't practice good customer service thing weren't explained me  NU club just lounge  Clubs charge 20% but Lounges! <EOR> This place proves horrible service ruin your entire experience   time seated until time incorrect bill Nu Sanctuary let down over over again   I some friends during happy hour which lasts until 8 pm  seemed unbelievable happy hour could last long now know why  Service incredibly slow  don't know if workers lazy lack better word dumb   First husband first seated noticeably dirty table  When he asked if going clean hostess asked Oh want different table? Let emphasize SLOW service was  ordered  two beers some water took least 45 minutes it  Mind only two other occupied tables time no reason why everything took long   took two hours finish drinks appetizers asked seated outside hookah   Unfortunately all hookah flavors sounded good stock  Once again waitress let down  ordered some more drinks placed hookah order  realized almost hour still didn't hookah  asked waitress she looked wide eyed clearly forgot put order in    For some strange reason don't list any beers menu  When asked waitress desserts she said serve cotton candy just found it! Really?! could she know food serve?

This venue seems more local's spot hookah drink maybe dance little   not Strip venue bottle service thing almost seemed place   We didn't try any food hookah   Everything saw looked good smelled pretty good   flare bartending cool   outdoor seating firepits look fun place hang out   wouldn't opposed going again  <EOR> I've twice say both times horrible! Both times food huge disappointment  Taste very processed unappealing  drinks bland bartenders horrible attitudes  acted though end world when ordered mojito girlfriend because he'd actually mix drink  far ambiance owners tried very chic impressive interior but looks cheap unfinished  anyone taste style place pathetic   last time charity event which $50 head  fairly empty outside sitting another couple  waitress asked move different table owners wanted sit there  Four douches affliction shirts sat down pretty sure only reason asked move impress girls with  am positive all good reviews written them  EVERY LOCAL KNOW HATES PLACE!! No chance place lasts through winter    <EOR> Music night hooka lounge restaurant turns into ultra lounge club  music starts off hip hop top 40 Dubstep Electro which gives people best both worlds  Wednesday nights which best nights till promotion company held events moved but time being  Wednesday's best days yet anymore  place always packed 11 30PM music!!!! some fun times there   Food Never ate but don't think would  seen people throw corners during club hours just can't imagine being seated eat there  would just gross out    Drinks Decent price but still over priced  beers still $8 bucks bottle some drinks Crown coke $12 bucks  Its step down Las Vegas's major clubs but still price Nu Sanctuary should charging    Location tell truth place prime great potential location  South Las Vegas inside Town Square where also Blue Martini located  place no cover line never long  <EOR> Words cannot aptly describe absolute atrocity visit Nu  If prodigious writer Joyce Hemingway perhaps could properly flesh horror inflicted upon but alas am just lowly commenter must best  If take anything following account let cross threshold establishment any reason less saddled your own tale woe    My sister arrived Saturday evening around 10 20 seated immediately  indoor area halved bar taking half dining area other   Essentially just big room fancy LED tree sculpture center tables set up   some reason despite small space least 15 servers hostesses 5 managers 10 bus boys 5 10 men nice dress shirts walked through dining area every ten minutes then left front door  no idea purpose was  Yet all staff took 20 minutes time sat down two glasses water  Two managers spent majority time making girlfriends bar  server managed completely disappear even though due lack partitions could see end restaurant other    Our hookah came relatively quickly but cocktails took without exaggeration 25 minutes table  During time treated endless train employees moving tables chairs dining room through front door then changing mind moving them back into dining room then moving them again  wish joking this  Twice DJ miss fed sound system feedback filled room causing universal aural discomfort   finished drinks waited another 10 minutes check  Finally flagged down Lothario manager graciously pulled tongue girlfriend's throat long enough scowl mumble something finding server  10 more minutes pass which check arrived made server stand wait while cash  point pissed but nuclear because little buzzed Saturday night  However waiting five minutes change server returned table advise because few bartenders  another TWENTY minutes before she change us  choice did but wait?

Food good but overpriced  Decor fun  Drinks ok  lil pricey  Its town square guys    Wynn  Best part night hookah  Amazing!  Among staff few stand outs    But generally miserable looking heavily made overall snooty bitchy people  hostess bus boys  Everyone seemed annoyed serve you    10pm Friday night when weren't even busy! Seriously ruined experience  Would stayed dance    But dj less stellar  Wanted enjoy myself spend money    But All majority staff did want leave! <EOR> This place OK little lounge never during day cant say much food  BUT night when lights great place dance smoke some hookah  service spectacular difficult lt drink when reserve table takes forever everything set up  drinks disappointing all worth money spend them $12 $15   better off buying shot your buzz going   The only thing llike place MUSIC  play mainly hip hop dance tech which why good gettin yo grove on  PLUS many beautiful people definitely mini club  crowd however YOUNG  Probably suited under 25 crowd  None less still fun  D Reserving VIP booth bad your going spend nearly much would club since lounge but still    And crazy enough place stays cracking till FOUR MORNING  could probably check some other spots then come back more hella late  <EOR> The place looks really cool food pretty good but did few mistakes orders  where big group where capable accommodate which nice but music little loud  resto lounge but still should lower sound just notch  couldn't hear each others   twice far different group people all agree that!  Overall bad spot hang out  give 4 stars if day hear there  <EOR> This club joke   came Saturday night couldn't anywhere inside place without squeezing through sandwiches sweaty people   If place just busy I'd okay but really wasn't   layout just sucks   giant center bar wide booths all around around squeezing through three feet left open between furniture bar    To add element danger otherwise safe but unpleasant experience servers carrying uncovered baskets red hot hookah coals through narrow gaps around dozens drunk dancing people  I slipped hall way bathroom because huge puddle floor water dripping through ceiling   dress hair soaked   told server but never resolved   another large patch wet floor way dance floor remained wet entire time at least 4 hours    top off when someone dropped broke glass dance floor   they decided just ahead leave all night despite fact told 3 separate employees exactly where was   Awesome service right? I seriously can't imagine why anyone would want come here   Maybe Nu functions better restaurant   If  case should stop pumping loud hip hop selling overpriced bottles liquor stick frying calamari whatever do  <EOR> My experience good  glad checked prior reading reviews wouldn't gone  service great food pretty good  can't complain other odd decor inside  appreciate whole forest theme but did feel little cold  told renovating inside really soon bit more comfy  But hey look good service food over stellar decor  I'd back drink bar some mac n' cheese  yummy! <EOR> Stopped drink some hookah  love look place bartender helped super friendly but disappointed hookah experience  tobacco use made Cuzzins which middle of the line quality  flavor selection also wasn't great  positive side don't use crappy cheap coals  Definitely worth $20 though  <EOR> this place alright  first timer giving benefit doubt  place looks nice outside seating should say smoking are  inside doesn't offer much sitting which weird since place lounge  good thing offer hookah services too  service though bit slow  friend dished $$$ bottle service plus hookah but believed service tad bit slow  getting situated only bottle even cold  hookah well took forever coal changed  music only thing saved place  first DJ Bay Area i tell music he played   E 40 $hort second played more house electronic which kool don't mind little mix there  sure if ever gonna hit place crowd mostly Hispanic group only Asian people besides 4 5 Asian woman came quickly came = <EOR> I'm really sad write but hoping help     NU used absolute favorite places hang eat   would rave rave amazing food was   loved atmosphere service   couldn't enough     After leaving town 3 months come back only find management changed chef left replaced menu changed everything different except decor   other day eat dinner   no hostess stand  When asked seated bartender looked if 5 heads   finally approached seated given menu   Turns brewed tea light took them 10 minutes bring re brewing   new tea tasted fish   didn't even comp drink   Waitress bless heart very friendly but slow   She only waiting more group place empty   Food came less desirable mind am picky eater   didn't even finish food!  dealt though since hungry   finished staring into space waited 10 15 minutes before getting tell bartender need waitress bring bill   frustrating!  She kept apologizing but late   already wasted time money   Last but least couldn't even post restaurant because absolutely no cell phone service leave AT T      Again very very sad one  <EOR> My friend Tuesday night place probably only quarter way occupied   hostess door told $50 00 minimum per two people    seemed asking quite bit considering could use any business weekday night   figured between hookah drinks we'd spend big deal   seated promptly then promptly ignored   sat table 20 minutes acknowledged once   ended just walking hitting Paymon's happy hour 1 3 price would paid NU   Another weird thing door hostess tasked if 21    yes are    then she basically said she knew because before    hadn't    then she asked if IDs just case    she didn't want check them she just wanted know them   Weird  <EOR> Meh  sums opinion Nu Sanctuary    I've mistakenly given many chances over last year since grand opening each time essentially same experience   Exhibit A Excited try new venture managers formerly Almaza favorite place drunk back day when underage rebellious came Nu couple friends  being seated waited *twenty five* minutes without being greeted server before finally flagging down manager saying Hey WTF man?   Although server came service left lot desired server preferred sit table view couple spots away flirting male patrons rather check see if wanted order anything more  meal mediocre took forever drinks service left only disappointed but actually little upset   Exhibit B time service little bit better although still very sub par when compared only other hookah spots lounges but other bars same area Town Square  She actually checked once every twenty minutes maybe  However review really quality hookah raised prices since last time I'd visited anywhere Vegas charging $30 head hookah only lasts 15 minutes before getting tasteless harsh suck it  Apparently prices now $20 head $10 refills which moderate but unless they've changed hookah never last long enough worth $   From experience love hate  never met anyone say Nu okay but certainly heard sentiments echoed many friends own terrible experiences one friend making reservations week advance forced wait 45 minutes table  Wtf  well few friends love place visit frequently    Give shot if you're area many other bars lounges Town Square aren't your cup tea  But don't order hookah stick appetizers drinks don't expect stellar service  <EOR> Going Nu Sanctuary going bad first date know where headed pretty quickly which case trainwreck someone else put best  drinks which great same pricing scale Wynn but without frills ambiance world class resort  food looked atrocious just drink left  concept hybrid nightclub hookah lounge fine dining doesn't work anywhere especially shopping center amid all other dining entertainment options Las Vegas offer  Avoid place all costs  Probably time finish reading review space Nu Sanctuary occupying vacant  <EOR> Was area Blue Martini chef's going back France farewell party some including pretty wasted French chef stopped afterparty   am sure if day week if still during pre opening but didn't wait any line came right in   few other customers already scattered about   escorted corner lounge which soft comfy wide seats   Our waitress can't recall name super nice   She came took hoohak beverage orders   returned shortly drinks   just hang thinking going Spring Mountain some late night pho afterwards which didn't happened caulked miscommunication bunch drunk coworkers waitress didn't hassle which cool   BUT she did tease little trying hookah which didn't partake smoking smoking don't smoke     While waiting    checked decor lounge thought nice   Garden Eden type theme tree thing going   waitresses wearing black skintight outfit which thought okay   But Asian waitress sitting bar smoking hookah which checking lack other eye candy keep entertained between bouts micro power napping  think she cute   menu looks interesting but didn't order anything so food part review    Our waitress super nice mentioned before she kept coming asking if needed anything else chatting etc   think she just simply wasted French chef but gave hoomie number too   There also bartender doing bar flair tricks   He doing decent job dropped bottle few times while paying attention   But all better practice   Plus many customers drinks time am sure he bored needed something keep himself entertained   My coworkers all enjoyed time gone back several times   based observations am giving 3 stars   I think cool alternative other clubs Town Square complex  <EOR>
