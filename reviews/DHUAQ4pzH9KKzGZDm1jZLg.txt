If rated Krispy Kreme taste alone would give five stars   But going treat doughnut shops same way treat fast food burger joint   Because both types establishments limitations quality atmosphere service nutritional content highest rating four stars    favorite doughnut shop gets  <EOR> Beyond annoyed morning when drove 30 minutes across town specifically called told hot now hours 5 AM 10 AM every day then arriving 5 30 AM said no hot till 6 AM no apology  voice recording incorrect need change future customers don't experience same inconvenience experienced morning    When specifically called find time serve hot then told otherwise no apology when arrive shitty way run business <EOR> Never Krispy Kreme don't donuts site! does free warm donut fresh off conveyor always amazing! <EOR> I waited counter 6 minutes alone all alone  4   yes 4 workers looked said hi yet no asked if I'd helped  No bothered take order    Finally saying excuse twice drive thru lady came help  took 4 more minutes paying point because she overwhelmed myself drive thru car she couldn't even focus  ordered donut  hard    The two stars because love those damn glazed chocolate things  <EOR> I called place large order feeding around 400 500 people  Typically $11 per glazed dozen  needed 35 dozen donuts she quoted $580  Instantly thought math incorrect  would over $16 dozen  asked why much she gave attitude said bulk orders charge more    zero sense  definitely going elsewhere considering save $200  <EOR> I absolutely love getting blueberry cakes   ones today good soft moist just couldn't enough   Service drive thru always friendly prompt never leave waiting take order   only thing would see better when giving receipt say thank something   complaining but think customer service needs little touch up  <EOR> Right money!
