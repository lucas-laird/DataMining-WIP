Smoked BBQ Wings boneless chicken very soggy both times   Seasoned Fries pretty soggy some cooked very well    Sweet Tea usually love sweet tea but very bland  should just filled cup unsweetened tea!  Also thought weird when dine napkins provide community roll hard brown paper tear off located next drink machine Really?!?!  The only plus very friendly employees more happy explain menu any suggestions    Sorry Wing Stop going elsewhere chicken wing fix! <EOR> The wings usually favorite Wingstop but can't resist fries what's love Wing Tuesdays Wednesdays! always interested discount but unfortunately deal only applies boneless wings which don't really but deal's deal   This location good some takeout long shopping session  prefer spicy Hawaiian order fries  best thing Wingstop  just wish more variety flavors  <EOR> I mean WINGSTOP! prefer them over all wing places valley tried handful them  wings never greasy fries delish especially when paired honey mustard sauce  only thing wait  Yes bit impatient but knowing come fresh does now pre order online even better  <EOR>
