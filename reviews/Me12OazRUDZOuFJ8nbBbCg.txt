The service however undeniably great  wish give better review but dish great  <EOR> This place small seems family owned   good UNLV students prices pretty good staff friendly   food pretty good but can't really think anything stand out awesome here       I'd come back   small unassuming nice change corporate mass production  <EOR> 1st older gentleman runs place very hospitable he offers suggestions since large varied unique menu even customize based like  chicken baby corn instead rice extra veg mixed never charge extra  home thai sauce serve chicken baby corn  friends green curry the red curry real hot Kung pao which tingles but hot   The best part frieny esp older guy he always shows hold bag no sauce spills carton haha  Now  customer service    PS disagree price $$ all meals 7 9$   I'm Jewish cheap would say $   <EOR> Convenient UNLV Students    The lunch special way go  $6 95 soup spring roll entree rice   The place recently remolded food much better before  best    but hits spot   Best thing Menu curry orange chicken   Staff very friendly  <EOR> Red thai curry chicken spice level 7 lunch special   6 95 comes egg drop soup crispy wontons small eggroll    Delicious   worked across street 4 years never before   clean unpretentious    update spice level 7 red thai curry also double full body cleanse   probably cheaper    ouch  <EOR> If love your food can bathed sweet salty goop love outdated decor then you'll love place  Otherwise avoid place plague    Perhaps most disheartening thing used okay  owners now believe quantity equals better quality  used come lunch specials  choose list entrees pad thai mint chicken orange chicken comes soup egg hot n sour egg roll  ordered stir fried chicken vegetables  hot n sour soup came order slimy thick pungent odor  entree drenched overly sweet sauce overpowered chicken  veggies looked came can  Apparently give dessert plate canned mandarin oranges syrup  nice gesture but prefer fresh fruit    The only redeeming quality meal egg roll sweet sour sauce  Service fine prompt  better food though  piece advice?
