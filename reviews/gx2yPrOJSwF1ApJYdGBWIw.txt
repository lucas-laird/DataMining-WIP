No  there's many other things menu people might like    But ramen shop there's good list better places Monta Hiromaru Fukamimi Sora  recommend those first  <EOR> The food pretty good place actually son's favorite ramen Vegas  coming since they've opened unfortunately over past year staff become increasingly rude!

However bit pricy thought bit steep pay over $20 bowl ramen plate crispy chicken really wasn't all great  But know better next time  Stick authentic dishes! D Also side note  When reordered jinya didn't food until everyone party completely done eating  It sucks being last person still eating eating full bowl ramen! every other random guest place even ones came sat down ordered food before did  Literally every single guest served before was     HUGE let down  pester servers but unfortunately just sure knew waiting far past reasonable time  <EOR> I accidentally ran into place thought old Arby's strip club   sitting down having crazy great server named Alecia sic sure totally stoked eat meal  place truly hidden gem  <EOR> I love place  favorite ramen place Vegas!! takoyaki too! eggs ramen perfect! garlic ramen OMG!

Atmosphere modern hip  Really good happy hour if mistaken twice day ! rad  hard crispy shrimp balls before big bowl delish ramen but anyways  Channeling inner fatness every time here  eaten Cha Cha Cha which say garlic lovers  literally MUCH GARLIC insane garlic addict lol  figured ordering Tonkotsu Spicy if don't spice maybe just regular Tonkatsu cause does nice kick it adding fresh garlic provided wayyyyy better ! add much garlic want ensure you're main course isn't literally garlic dinner !! Lastly service always super efficient awesome check toilet won't disappointed ! Hahaha Enjoy ! <EOR> I see why place popular   ramen good ambiance pretty hip young don't deep into Chinatown your noodle fix   definitely seems cool place under 30 eat Vegas' latest food craze     But honestly wasn't quite worth hype got   10 minute wait when 9pm Sunday wait staff seemed run down overwhelmed many people    but hear they're always busy you'd think they'd down now   EVERY sake   just sake    every sake   ramen pretty good   lot choices tonkotsu black better chef special chicken had   don't think noodles home made but still taste good   chef chicken special hard eat   Chicken pieces big really wanted knife fork cut them up   Try getting bite semi tough piece chicken while holding chopsticks trying remain lady    impossible! Even bamboo shoots huge   bite down 5 times!   All all I'd back if lived west side  <EOR> Jinya always bf I's late night ramen  always order same thing tonkotsu black thick noodles  love takoyaki Chashu bowls! Also baby leaf salad garlic ginger dressing bomb  Jinya never fails  probably favorite ramen places comparison Monta Ramen Sora  <EOR> Waiting time quiet long   Atmosphere nice service good  little bit noisy music quiet loud but okay  veggie broth which looking for  starter some cold tofu seaweed top don't remember name  But really good  dressing little sour add some gyoza I guess soy sauce you're good go! did veggie ramen soup dried seaweed topping  yummy especially mushrooms asparagus! don't when put broccoli Asian soup like pho ramen soups because ruins taste it  tell them leave them next time  want try corn topping too  All all happy dinner  <EOR> My taste buds very surprised balanced flavors Ramen! expected very salty because saltiest ramen but just PERFECT  spicy miso ramen little sweet taste but most people would probably it  lot flavor definitely salty lot other ramen places  Although salty other places packs more flavor  pork gyoza cooked perfection  ramen #1 black very rich but balanced saltiness  black garlic oil made ramen soup rich but wasn't overpowering all  complimented thin noodles  Definitely ramen remember most  takoyaki pretty average because everything else phenomenal  Chashu bowl average because only little amount Chashu cut into pieces  would tasted better whole opinion  <EOR> It's 2nd time man place pack rim   waiting list waited less then 10 mins single person   order Sukiyaki Q Ramen add bean sprouts did combo plate Pork Gyoza salad plus ice tea too   bowl quite filling your stomach no room dessert! <EOR> OK ramen Las Vegas   Worth trying but good enough return  Ramen available thin thick noodles based broth   broth simple clean   noodles lacked flavor any character own   Gyoza good tempura brussel sprouts good   Those I'd recommend   The ramen came impressed  <EOR> I terribly upset lack strategy hostess  party 7 person works food industry myself understand stressful messy dinner rush all ready wait  But  no excuse atrocious treatment part  Party party let before us  Smaller parties 1 3 passable but parties 5? 6? If hostess waited few more minutes before letting those parties pass would enough room us  But seemed greater concern number people opposed first  Considering already waited hour point great things heard willing wait  But then hostess proceeds dismiss when attempt negotiate seating arrangement which would split   Although food honestly fantastic hence two stars servers incredibly nice sorry Jinya won't returning guest  better hostess plan seating  <EOR> My ramen place  broth amazing thick noodles cooked just right  always tonkotsu black thick noodles because big fan thin noodles  salad fantastic think dressing but always whenever dine here  Atmosphere nice dim lighting more seats other ramen places  customer service alright some reason always freezing cold music pumping loud yell order talk your friends    Oh yeah AMAZING TOILETS!!!

First impression dark bar fact if didn't see ramen other tables would easily thought place bar   music similar you'd find bar scene   Loud Really loud annoying   owners just happen young guy just happened originally Hawaii   thought I'd compliment ramen flavor same time ask turn down music could hear each talk conversation   also really cold restaurant perhaps time morning lack bodies place something that   After eyes adjusted dark atmosphere loud music focused ramen   Thin noodles rich tonkatsu broth that know took days pto produce wonderful garlic flavors perfectly cooked egg   atmosphere desirable but food amazingly delicious! It good if better authentic ramen Japan   menu perfect picky eaters order noodles thick thin customize dish number add ons    most incredible thing spicy sauce photo enclosed chefs creation   Stopped restroom prior leaving very clean toilets fancy Japanese high end ones find 5 star Tokyo hotels   restrooms good measure gauge much restaurant cares     If your ever Las Vegas looking very good bowl ramen visit try guarantee disappointed  <EOR> I'm much ramen person I prefer pho over ramen since lighter but JINYA really exceeded expectations  friend introduced place few weeks ago loved ! tonkatsu white ramen bomb  broth egg mushrooms chashu pork belly everything all really really good  Monta Ramen Sora Fukumimi feel JINYA best all them  Much better flavor selections  tonkatsu white bowl included egg unlike Fukumimi where only give half egg Monta even included pay extra one  ordered spicy chicken ramen to go dad he's ramen person he doesn't even Japanese food but he loved too  says lot food   I really enjoyed vibes dimly lit ambiance good loud music  Service spot on  Everything all just very good  never want cook packet instant noodles ever again LOL  definitely coming back although only crave ramen twice three times year  <EOR> Not enough soup tonkotsu yes tonkotsu all soup   point marketing tonkotsu when stingy soup   recommended!! <EOR> This only ramen place now  broth really flavorful doesn't feel really bloated heavy later  interior sort reminds Ichiza  choice between thick thin noodles types broth  really feel eating noodles Japan when here  <EOR> Always great place Ramen  garlic bowl amazing  Unfortunately sides all lacking  <EOR> Chef jerk  Bad manners  Insists noodles perfect when terribly underdone  bad  <EOR> After crazy night Vegas really needed bowl ramen  friends spoke highly Jinya  where decided go  waited 20 30 minutes table 2 Sunday around 1pm    I friends recommendation ordered Sprouting Ramen  However made mistake replacing pork chashu pork soboro  pork soboro really well seasoned would taste great rice because salty end  However adding soboro already salty ramen made broth extremely salty  brussel sprouts unique cooked well but think definitely more tradition ramen fan    We also ordered takoyaki which well worth $6  appetizer comes 6 octopus balls bed crushed hard boiled eggs covered japanese mayo sauce green onions bonito flakes  takoyaki delicious would come back Jinya just eat them again  <EOR> I spicy tonkotsu Ramen extra chashu added egg  While liked enough list top favorites authentic Monta  love variety different bowls course your own  downside why remove star price  several more dollars any other Ramen joint Town  back only when afford it <EOR> Awesome food awesome happy hour  kids menu nice allowed kids try little everything!

When asked see GM did even address directly but somebody else worked did  meal course comp'ed  piece metal told probably cleaning brush regularly use clean ramen bowls with  wish hadn't given piece metal promptly took picture first  completely unacceptable easily life threatening  If something does change someone could end dying  <EOR> I've many times always leave happy  fave Jinya tonkotsu black  takoyaki die shrimp ball great too What love restaurant chicken broth instead pork broth bring anyone place still eat ramen    Service good everyone paying attention customer   I definitely keep coming back  <EOR> Hands down go to ramen place any situation!

But stopped being good when found hair it! very upset lost appetite continue  also Pork Chashu bowl just continued eat which really good  Overall food service good but just upset hair  <EOR> Not big fan ramen but I'd definitely ramen  place nice food great! I'd definitely back Gyoza since d'lish    The atmosphere really cool  good thing opens late but also means very crowded night  Still highly recommended tho  Love motto no ramen no life LOL <EOR> Plenty seating hip mood setting restaurant  But don't fooled isn't some limited menu fancy ramen  ton recipes here  Even tonkotsu varies  interested trying other broths despite loving time around  think people also pleasantly surprised selection appetizers  eye takoyaki  Also enjoyed excellent service  must come rush because everyone pepped but many tables full  enjoyed Tonkotsu Black buttery oily broth thinner noodles al dente perfect chashu melty slippery fat uncut marinated boiled egg wish softer yolk but still good taste couple nori sheets just right amount garlic oil green onions crunchy onions so savory tiny dallop chili paste  great  Spicy crazed folks may enjoy adding chili paste which every table   Tokyo Tonkotsu Special chunky savory broth very good onion chunks but toward end tasted very salty same chashu egg nori green onions bonito flakes  tasted much better black but also insanely savory  No need any additional condiments   Overall very happy visit look forward trying everything menu  suggest making special trip try spot  <EOR> Best ramen ever had! Couldn't say enough things place! Authentic broth perfect chew cook noodles  Friendly staff crispy rice tuna great! <EOR> This current favorite ramen restaurant  employees friendly come remember each time come  fairly wide variety choices when comes ramen which great because tend enjoy thin noodles whereas fianc likes thick  sides also delicious  steamed buns light but meaty    I am sad lunch special gone  wonderful deal smaller portion ramen rice bowl gyoza dessert  lured hooked jonesing ramen fix  <EOR> First impression smelly uncomfortable  ordered two ramen bowls two salads California roll chashu bowl  salad dressing chashu bowl salty ramen bland tasted chicken broth straight box  side bowls all clean  Also eggs ramen still shell attached it  first California tasted fine but then middle roll which should best part avocado tasted strange  service nothing special  Overall don't understand rave place  nothing stands especially compared places such Sora Monta  Never again  waste money  restroom very nice though <EOR> Terrible customer service host  waiting 40 mins decided nearby bar  called them 30 mins later said another 20 25 wait came back 20min mark probably called name right before showed up  front desk hostess said she putting name bottom list  estimate better invest technology texts people when table close being ready hosts better customer service   Update decided wait two different customers walked within additional 20min wait host moved bottom line apparently host called names recommended  buttom line well  Seems recurring problem  <EOR> I Tokyo Tonkotsu Special Pork Gyoza crispy chicken Brussels Sprout tempura  The broth thicker more savory Monta which favorite place town  The pork wasn't flavorful good  The gyoza very well done very juicy but very vegetable heavy which good but some may prefer theirs more pork side  The sprouts tempura good but maybe little undercooked  The Crispy chicken good but nothing really stood me  All all wouldn't say the best but the best places Ramen town  also bigger some really tiny places hopefully wait won't bad   I frequent place <EOR> Igi best!

Both come thin noodles pick your range spiciness  prefer spicy but if hesitant start mild  Overall never left un satisfied best ramen town opinion!   The only downfall sometimes wait but definitely worth it! <EOR> Went tonight first time     two signature dishes plus chicken appetizer    chicken dark meat way greasy    appetizing all!!! sprouting ramen pork he spicy chicken ramen     funny thing two completely different dishes tasted same husband said    didn't eat more then two bites mine waitress did even ask why didn't eat it!!    hot wanted cold iced tea     ask 3 different people 3 different times ice     finally stop someone say please please    ice!! iced tea never ice!!!!!

Just me  typically advocate strong punch you in the face flavor but something broth Jinya kept sipping savoring quality ingredients comforting broth    I understand some may feel lighter broth Jinya unfavorable  However argue if feel inclined always add dashes or tablespoons delicious bottled ramen seasoning thick spicy sauce conveniently sitting each table order adjust boldness your ramen broth  control customizing flavor your ramen? down that! Honestly boyfriend didn't crazy table side ramen seasoning few dashes set off just right  Enjoy savoring broth close your eyes if need to  actually more wonderful even imagine when take all perfect bite some broth little bit noodles some seaweed some corn if added it some chashu etc  slurp away! just hugs your tastebuds your belly    Here's recommend Jinya Tonkotsu Black $10 55 2 slices pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles  Yeah  broth talking when wrote love story above  thin ramen noodles perfectly cooked al dente  soft boiled seasoned egg ultra luscious silky also cooked perfectly  All components ramen meant eaten together  truly enjoyed delicate nuances garlic broth all pungent artificial tasting  also feel toppings chose perfect ramen Toppings added Corn $1 love corn love corn ramen soups! adds lovely pop texture sweetness each slurp broth  Highly recommend  Fresh Garlic FREE bring small jar raw garlic cloves soaking water also provide metal hand garlic press  freshly press garlic yourself adjust much garlic want your soup  garlic flavor very smooth aggressive because soaking method removes lot pungent spicy bitterness plain raw garlic  really enhanced garlic flavor Tonkotsu black broth brought ramen whole notha' level  If you're garlic lover highly recommend! Extra Pork Chashu $2 2 pieces chashu indeed buttery but also good amount enjoyable tender meaty substance unlike flimsy fatty chashu just disintegrates into broth Monta    We also tried Jinya Bun $3 80 Daaaym! pork belly buu tter yyyy!!! pork belly bun unforgettable  toppings sauce simple weak side can't necessarily say need order every time come here  But would definitely recommend first timers enjoy expertly cooked buttery pork belly  Takoyaki $4 80 Philip T  didn't joke around when he said better versions if best takoyaki Vegas  came hot plump juicy even cooked egg white chunks egg salad? mayo! totally unexpected added such amazing texture unique flair beloved classic  Take your takoyaki ball just run along plate pick any and all takoyaki sauce chunky mayo sauce sounds weird but  meant eaten! octopus inside each ball also cooked perfectly moist extra tender    Not only all food tried satisfying also really diggin' ultra sexy vibe bossy decor here  Plus right when walked amazing song playlist completely captured attention  played back to back to back jams right alley  admit used SoundHound entire dinner figure exactly playing since needed add playlist  only recall 1 2 places entire life where music really set amazing mood dinner  happy report Jinya certainly added list those places    I am relieved open late until 3 am !!!

Also no free refills which caused spend 7 dollars alone just drinks    Other still would recommend place everyone  They're doing great  Keep Jinya  <EOR> What enjoyable ramen bar  always come just crispy shrimp balls but course ramen good too   The interior great since come night dim lighting  don't close until 3 AM which even better!

To start majority patrons 90% non Asian least lunch time thus guess reviews really Asian standards good bowl ramen should be   It great kids menu   $7 50 small bowl chicken ramen corn spinach 2 crispy chicken small bowl chicken rice slice orange lollipop small vanilla ice cream   would say highlight whole meal   For adults ordered Tokyo ramen special which just tonkatsu pork soup base skinny ramen noodles cha siu soft boiled egg   If authentic ramen place would boil broth each table just scooped broth big pot   place know just scooped broth assemble toppings bring table   Out ramen came quick before appetizers hint    broth hot which should be    Disappointed!!!  Now come food ordered Brussels sprouts tempura really good because put truffle oil tempura batter very fragrant   crispy chicken also tasty   Authentic Tonkatsu broth should white close brown assume add quiet bit soy sauce which made broth quiet salty   Oh way everyone kitchen non Asian   OH no Japanese restaurant at least authentic Japanese restaurant charge $1 tea   Tea water supposed complimentary   American restaurant asking cup tea coffee menu   Very disappointed considering purposely took uber come ramen place which supposedly such great review <EOR> Yummm! Can't blame having wait list all time  Location Damn small  Expand!!! <EOR> This place better ramen joints Las Vegas  broth noodles well made  tonkatsu spicy Jinya tonkatsu black ramens  tonkatsu spicy made thick noodles black made thin noodles  liked broth spicy but preferred thin noodles come tonkatsu black ramen  Next time order tonkatsu spicy thin noodles  Overall both good ramens   I highly recommend Pork Chashu kimchee tacos! pork nice tender combined great crunch fried taco shells  kimchee adds nice saltiness tacos  order comes 2 tacos perfect appetizer    Service very quick attentive  restaurant packed but food came quick easy  Good experience overall  <EOR> Wow  Came back HUGELY disappointed  JINYA stopped serving high quality traditional ramen instead catered masses non Japanese people pouring in   The food 3 4 stars  tapas all really good  tacos great  JINYA bun very special bun AMAZING  However switched special cucumber sauce ton lettuce beautiful delicious pork belly traded tough tiny pork belly  VERY disappointed  JINYA  black good solid 4 stars but multitude other ramen options nearby better    Service wait time VERY long  Crazy line  Luckily 5 people able sit bar  Come before 5 prepared wait anywhere 30 mins over hour  waiters staff fine pretty nice standard  Almost none them Japanese none cooks which bad sign  took 45 MINUTES RAMEN  Ramen bars supposed quick simple restaurants serving authentic food but instead much longer complicated menu takes forever  Also seemed only making to go orders!

All us Asians know shrimp chips! YUM = Truffle fries never wrong anything truffle but just couldn't enough truffle ketchup =       Tonkatsu black ramen new favorite thin noodles al dente just liking  Broth wasn't salty all which extra liking cuz into salty miso flavors  Broth also light heavy which made easier finish whole bowl  mushrooms garlic chips added extra crunch which always delicious  Sadly egg didn't add egg ramens but added extra charshu instead  ain't mad that  I really liked charshu ramen yet charchu bowl very whatever  Their Tokyo curry rice sweet don't sweet curry  hoping more spicier version      so aspect no touching Ramen Sora's curry charshu bowls!

Great environment music layout flavor  MUST GREAT RAMEN! <EOR> I've come Jinya several times last year 9 10 times excellent however brought birthday earlier month nephew 4 years old gotten stomach flu chicken kids meal  It really devastating cause sister family's first time son husband feeding breaking apart chicken pieces sick days struggling hold down food week after  came evening January 4th wasn't till just few days ago recovered it  All ask more caution cleanliness exercised especially kids meal because nephew couldn't understand wrong why happening  <EOR> Ramen Jinya love but C rating health inspection okay  Also should visit your studio city location quality control spicy chicken ramen watered down nearly flavorful  Server really nice decor looks great but step up! <EOR> My first ramen bar!I chose chefs special Tokyo tonkatsu Ramen  ok  very fishy flavor since does include fish powder  LOTS fish powder  being first ramen joint didn't really know good  Let's just say definitely won't getting again lol gyoza takoyaki yummy  Also prepared wait  place busy  such little space  people waiting outside because barely any waiting room inside  Hopefully move bigger location  <EOR> My husband always seem end eating ramen every time vacation  Considering we're Japan place awesome!  ramen tasty very well flavoured   appetizers side dishes also very delicious e g  pork bun crispy chicken gyoza    anniversary special loved it! <EOR> This place affordable big portion meals  gave 3 stars because place small amount clientele receives service better  server took long come back take order around 20 mins  Then towards end meal felt if trying rush when weren't done eating  <EOR> When walked into restaurant hostess jumped bit surprised  But good way  Yes! Visitors! Good signs already! She immediately seated table corner half booth half table really    I very pleased seating arrangement if say myself  floor plan open place big  walls lined booths tables center large wooden table seating group 20   The lighting low gives sense privacy despite open room  music mostly tasteful indie dance its just loud enough drown conversation others but loud can't hear your own     Our server young girl explained menu checked all appropriate times  ordered curry rice octopus balls which both AMAZING would come back more!   I tad hit stickler say ramen aesthetically pleasing Monta don't truly care thicker style ramen noodles but broth very good nice full flavor  service great server attentive friendly without being intrusive  Overall very nice experience  they're open late! <EOR> The hostess took name seating very inconsiderate  white girl gages told she called name but she crossed off list  very bad experience coming back when girl working  wish could give no stars hostess  <EOR> I enjoy tasty heavy broth but felt theirs lacked just that  noodles pretty good but best didn't taste fresh  whole everything JINYA Tonkotsu Black boyfriend's chicken pork ramen would say scale 6 10  12 30 sad didn't time Takoyaki keep seeing reviews best anyone Vegas  come back try that  potstickers okay wish crispier  tasted ones boil home same boring texture tasted hint soy sauce  ordered Brussels Sprouts Tempura boyfriend dislikes Brussels but really enjoyed because he could barely taste them  reading them thick  hostess kind it  table service okay he never came check didn't really explain couple choices well boyfriend his first time having ramen   flag someone else down bill  Great atmosphere liked he seating situations music   <EOR> Came recommendation coworker  broth very good  little different any before  creamy compared broth like  each different ramen tasted totally different which nice  started thick noodles ordered extra serving thin  Comparing two liked thick husband preferred thin noodles    The staff great  waitress spent time going over menu us  needed but definitely appreciated     Would recommend friends return  <EOR> I must say never thought would want ramen often until tried Jinya! used random craving would spring mtn  But literally find myself wanting Jinya crazy!! gone 2 times last week! First off love atmosphere very warm dark woods play awesome music  everyday radio    We started iced green tea which super refreshing free refills  Next Jinya buns  SKIP BUNS!! pork tender sauce yummy  tried premium white tonkotsu didn't disappoint  broth more flavor then ever expected  lighter texture even though appeared very creamy  noodles PERFECT texture  didn't use any condiments but chili sauce ramen seasoning table    One thing think SUPER cool kids meal  thing contains much food disbelief  When saw menu ask 8 choose item but mope! everything listed pictured! Chicken ramen corn spinach chashu rice bowl spinach chicken karrage fries orange slice lollipop tofu dessert!! All $7!!  Since 5 year old can't eat all try bunch stuff  karrage amazing kind heavy salt if you're sensitive pass up    Our service eh best  But food decent price point shown service  can't wait eat Jinya now thinking since started review  <EOR> They best ramen ever! all time since close t apartment area oh god! takoyaki die for <EOR> I've visiting Ramen Shop since opened location least 1x week   love Ramen   Over course time price gone couple times but dealt servers all friendly know order right when come happy when finish!    The last menu change price increase unfortunately crossed line me   no longer offer Tonkatsu Assari #3 all its glory   closest thing now something brussel sprouts extra pork   don't mind extra pork probably still good price but latest price increase brings regular order close 50% more when first opened   could just change order accommodate new menu but many other Ramen shops around offer lower price bowl Ramen everything want and nothing more pay for hard justify staying regular here   little bit sad since close office great lunch option   asked server if could just keep giving order   able some substitutions pretty much but price remains higher     Perhaps keep Tonkatsu Assari used off menu option regulars myself   You'll definitely win back regular business Yelp Stars!!!!  would rate lower menu change but food still quite good can't lower this  <EOR> All say Miso Ramen must have  Everytime 2am theres line  But fast well worth wait  <EOR> I liked Tonkotsu Assari   heavy good flavor   service great   servers very attentive nice little too     The only thing disappointed kid's meal   excited see presentation shown menu but came ship shaped plastic dish Nuri paint chipped point should just replace it    Also rice Japanese rice   am very picky rice   know kid's meal catering toward them but would still nice if could also apply same standard it  <EOR> I love chicken ramen! There's no other places serves chicken + ramen  why love place! Wish another location closer home! <EOR> The food amaizing! Love it! food came fast service great    definitely going back   The kids meal good loved chicken rice  <EOR> Went during peak lunch hours waited 10 15 minutes table  Overheard customers saying waiting long food arrive waiting seated   We seated bar  ordered spicy chicken ramen sprouted ramen  recommendations friend works Jinya San Diego   As waiting food noticed people seated getting food  server notified forgot place order said would food minute   Our food came shortly service said! gave extra protein ramen  finished eating gave green tea mochi ice cream house!  Over all food excellent handled mistake service very well! <EOR> Yes place open late  hip but really worth it? If asked question 3 years ago would say definitely yes but over past couple years   this place gone way down quality service  Yes customize your order but really customized your liking if wrong? ALL TIME!! Let's even talk wait time  never understand why even when there's plenty space available don't seat guests littering tiny area entrance hallway bathroom  blocking guests escaping should fire emergency type incident? even ok fire code wise??? Well suppose answer seating question watching kitchen staff flounder way around kitchen  OMG disorganized! No wonder filter people coming being served?! FAIL! order kid's meal comes 20 minutes adult's meal  Hmmm   who should serve first? Kids adults?! then kids order wrong?! Seriously?! those non parents reading might sound petty but parents reading understand why situation MAJOR SUCK!  AVOID!  good place worth aggravation   hard pick right noodles put bowl thick thin? They're spelled differently! If can't differentiate then don't option! Good Grief! literally visit over past 3 years where simply just orders right    and don't even customize orders much! All add toppings! LOL crying inside! Sad say but afraid final visit place   I am disappointed am actually writing first Yelp review  Congrats guys! <EOR> Amazing place   ambiance service food top notch!  My cousin recommended place moment entered time left well taken care of   Upon arrival seated immediately took notice lay restaurant very feng shui   flowed nicely decorated nicely   Very clean very modern traditional feel wooden tables   It dimly lit some low music playing   Seems great hang spot 20 somethings even place take date great intimate conversation with   As food aunt gracious host since coming town happy order test plenty menu   ordered vegan ramen edamame mochi ice cream   rest group ordered ramen different types meat also shrimp ball appetizers    Everyone blown away presentation well taste   Apparently ramen sauce also spectacular although didn't try felt bowl perfect way was   The service also fantastic waitress Kate   She very knowledgable friendly attentive all needs   didn't hurt she also easy eyes agreed upon group   In any case pricing extremely fair reasonable made great value money     highly recommend coming check place out! <EOR> Good food nice atmosphere  Service bit lacking  There line when just added names list clipboard  lot waiting space waited outside parking lot  When called name put five booth stool  worked well enough  seemed space available big table where could seating more people but often empty seats tables while people still waited  We ordered drinks two people order water beer  Beer came no water  Asked again  Nothing  Asked again  Nope  Asked fourth time water two asked for   time ordered dinner food  Also FYI soda but can  When ordered food made point reminding everyone ordered thick noodles would all thin  Fine handwritten sign door saying this  But ordered bowls ramen only told didn't that  Sucked because ramen reason wanted here  ordered something else fine  First bowl shows up  minute later two more  Another minute bowl four shows up  wait    wait  Probably five plus more minutes last bowl shows also when first glass water showed   don't know if vegetarian ramen takes longer but bowl last  Everyone said food really good  liked mine husband's tasty too  When check comes all throw down twenties  give waiter twenty two bucks over bill ask change  He comes back two ones two tens  wanted tip around fifteen but since  change put down twelve  Most waiters give assortment bills when change  Oh well  A good place would back but expect best service  sure much language barrier much just busy  <EOR> Simply best food  Love portians   pork belly mini sandwhich yum also curry lobster roll  Nice place try little bit everything  Great service friendly vibe killer music selection  Yep back    <EOR> Great atmosphere great Raman!

Vegas local love sum ramen! <EOR> Jinya usually go to ramen but last experience probably won't want back while  food great always but first time received bad service  server orders right however she very inattentive very blunt when talking table  friend finished drinks halfway through meal but server never came around ask if wanted refills and did   asked utensils well didn't receive them ten minutes afterwards  also waited half hour done meal attention check time she talked every table around without noticing  us  tried attention several times also made eye contact but nothing  never bad experience love jinya   I still love food but service very upsetting  <EOR> This place incredible food serves really quickly  Wonderful ambience restaurant if order delivery through postmates always travels really well  <EOR> Tonight pretty busy Jinya but server Rachel freakin awesome! never big fan ramen but she suggested spicy miso loved every spoonful  topped off happy hour too  Rachel always kept waters topped off made sure everything needed even though place super busy  definitely come back food great service she gave group! <EOR> Monta Ramen vs  Jinya Ramen? Monta hands down every time!   I really hate knock good thing but experience more hype Billboards reality  lived Japan eaten enough ramen and US experience good ramen is   Maybe just location b c Robata Jinya LA Ramen good   What Jinya does going menu variety but double edged sword execution inconsistent when try many things once  note execution lacking both front house seating service back house food quality   Seems restaurant run young kids just winging first job part time job  Service attention detail lacking  Dirty tables bussed batches rather individually thus people waiting looking each other confused looks  Nobody asked checked us  Restaurants thrive turnover but obviously metric employees aware of   Ordered Sprouting Ramen Cha Cha Cha both which Jinya Recommended items    know Jinya serves fusion ramen but shouldn't fat chunks floating your ramen    only fusion fat chunks fuses belly which can't good   Extra noodles which ordered never came ask 2 times them  Finally arrived fortunately portions large but soup already cold     Jinya should employees visit Japan understand attention detail pride service  better yet just visit Monta Ramen  <EOR> I finally decided stop driving past nearly everyday  interior looked much nicer expected before entered restaurant  small ramen bar front kitchen small Japanese themed dining area  staff all very friendly restaurant appeared very clean   The food service better average  would definitely recommend giving place go   Takoyaki excellent  If Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then dish  basically same ingredients then shaped bite size portions   Crispy Rice spicy tuna just says is  good   Crispy Chicken ponzu sauce would good choice if chicken would greasy  think oil fryer needed changed dropped chicken back fryer cooked   Spicy chicken ramen noodle ramen excellent  ordered Hot   lot heat but much heat could enjoy it  may just Spicy next time though  <EOR> Fantastic   Had spicy chicken medium couldn't stop myself finishing entire bowl  <EOR> Saw reviews place waited 30 minutes sit man disappointment! ordered gyoza takoyaki which both came slow cold    The server didnt apologize ramen came 30 minutes  She also forgot egg order no apology    Out 3 ramen places chose place service garbage no manager staff  would never recommend place anyone! <EOR> I wasn't expecting much did house dressing salad amazing  also portion matches price which something see often  all really tasty glad whim  <EOR> For longest time couldn't decide if Jinya more Monta but yeah  personally think better because more options   know some say Monta best broth which personally think Jinya Monta pretty close category but tie breaker fresh garlic theeeeeee best takoyaki Jinya   only service great every time visit too! But going back food noodles perfectly cooked  loaded takoyakis mountain flavor  Probably best Vegas  <EOR> Probably most hip ramen bar to  staff friendly  Ordered JINYA bun worth $4  However ramen pretty mediocre  better ramen Walmart 99cents  Would definitely come back JINYA bun though  <EOR> Okay wasn't worst  But wasn't Monta know?   Atmosphere cool  Hip ish  Servers nice  Just food eh? missing something  dunno  grew halfway through bowl but also starving  chicken ramen thick noodles  almost if under cooked? chewy  all perfect consistency usual ramen noodle    The chicken ramen tasted thin gravy!  was  Also kinda smelled thanksgiving? But honestly wasn't bad  didn't hate it  <EOR> This place great! great lunch special best takoyaki town! crazy thing drive thru window! <EOR> Definitely great ramen bar phenomenal experience vegan options  Outside vegan takoyaki  good  <EOR> I Jinya Bun Spicy chicken Ramen panna cotta dessert  delicious!  always drove place before first time here  think found  new spot   Service great too  definitely comeback <EOR> The service pretty average but food very good  usually big fan ramen but if ever grabbing some place  atmosphere decor awesome  good place come friends biiiig center table  food comes really fast pretty much come 30 minutes  tried Tokyo curry which amazing! does any meat but flavors there!

She did apologize just made excuse saying party all here! which lie all standing front her big deal but attitude ridiculous <EOR> JINYA perfectly alright but better lot other places town   think change pace kinda place   flavors bit unusual offer wide selection optional toppings   location more convenient most other ramen joints   customer service fine   They little expensive considering bowl leans small they look big but ceramic material just really thick tall toppings little stingy portion probably because bowl small    Ramen prices Vegas seem creeping general   also odd thick noodle ramen would call normal husband's bowl super small portion while thin noodles the thinnest ever seen ramen pretty generous   ordered tofu topping cold cooked cooled down ramen faster   But entire brick worth tofu   fried onions quite tasty enjoyed chicken char siu still kinda rare   The spicy really spicy like maybe 1 5 scale 5 did ramen more flavorful but also more salty think   JINYA ramen definitely saltier average   think try basic chicken ramen next time see if less salty   enough feel bit sick soon after  <EOR> This first restaurant ramen experience fantastic  Jimya looks very small outside but roomier looks once you're inside  group 7 work lunch right noon service quick correct! ordered spicy chicken added poached egg all disappointed  ask server Tokyo Negri listed ingredients learned new fact day Tokyo Negri Japanese onion  order ramen mild spicy HOT  Spicy pretty darn spicy only imagine hot high spicy scale   Our table 45 minutes tops all thought food delicious  definitely add restaurant into lunch rotation going forward  <EOR> This place unexpectedly really good!  would never guessed if tourist driving glanced over see Jinya   VERY non descript strip mall nothing else around look twice   But trust stop some Ramen   turned into quite Ramen addict last two years although hate admit acquired taste hipster Ramen vs traditional   Although won't catch kicking any Ramen bowls bed     back point taste Ramen   place San Diego LOVE called Underbelly   Some people haven't quite won over yet but does seem place use compare all others   Well except place Paris which ALL TIME favorite    There very good flavor broth choose thick thin noodles add toppings    All which very important me   price very reasonable serving size filling   also happy hour win win book! <EOR> Forever love ramen!!

I'm pretty new Ramen craze before dining Momofuku Cosmopolitan Las Vegas decided take friend girl offer ramen lunch introduction   I want Jinya honest but way many service failures count Sunday afternoon took away overall experience  Side Note majority friends rave place being phenomenal  Returning gamble time!!!  Main I ordered Vegetable Ramen $10 just okay  asked spicy but don't think communicated very well  No hint spice sight!  My friend ordered chef special chicken ramen $11 00 which comes half egg  short debate server ordering additional half egg order ramen arrived no eggs all! Awkward! Appetizers Caramelized Cauliflower $6 20 was far best item ordered  Bold flavor pine nuts great addition  The chickpeas loaded cumin  bit much honest but did enjoy them!  We ordered Spicy Creamy Shrimp $7 80 which literally arrived end meal  server came two additional times acknowledged she forgot remainder appetizer she continued forget! Flavorful delicious but late af! Dessert ordered Panna Cotta $3 50 which also blah! graham cracker topping ice cream taste uncovered fridge quite some time  friend ordered block pop $3 80 which arrived unwrapped little moist sat few minutes she shared dessert always wrapped     The icing cake server coughing directly into hands before setting small table next without washing hands  She touched napkins spoons  no sanitation police but totally unacceptable!  Not sure total because friend felt bad recommending place took care tab! <EOR> This place great service!

Taste wise nothing really special but interesting experience   I also Jinya Bun try which pretty much pork belly bun  gotta say   I've better  lot sauce bun most times covered flavors pork belly    didn't really that  sweet smokey type sauce wasn't exactly very appealing me    As ramen decided spicy chicken ramen spiciest level  normally tonkotsu but most ramen places Vegas tonkotsu broth really heavy salty didn't really want there  Instead thin noodles decided sub thick noodles  noodles al dente most places don't cook thin ramen noodles way took chance thick ones    Good choices part  broth light very good  heavy salty spicy even though take really spicy things  Best all didn't tired taste it  When normally eat tonkotsu tired flavor really fast  noodles perfectly al dente!   On side note bathroom very romantic  quite dim some lights around mirror lights around toilet  toilet's lid automatically comes up!

As ramen chef's Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen bf same but Tonkatsu Ramen Black soup base little different   Both tasted great good toppings soup base delish! finished whole thing! Definitely gonna hit place again  <EOR> The ramen LIT! used think Monta best ramen place Vegas but coming Jinya mind changed! Whenever Jinya tonkotsu black ramen which favorite ramen dish menu  broth right flavor egg point pork always hit! also ramen dish comes thin noodles since thin noodles  Also if ever come evenings Adam amazing server! Whenever he serves table he gives wonderful welcoming service never afraid give recommendations  definitely recommend place your ramen cravings! <EOR> Really good Ramen staff could use some help just little busy loud difficult good service  But great food friendly smiles  <EOR> This worst day Jinya ever    very Hyped try Pork Chashu Rice Bowl but wasted 10 mins life finally someone came tell microwave broken actually heat Pork  Other wise ramen EXCELENTE  <EOR> My first time place  more choices ramen other items menu other places tried  Came around 9pm wait 30min  Definitely back try different ramen  chefs special wasn't favorite  buns excellent! Must try! <EOR> Really good ramen but pretty heavy  enough vegetarian options  No gluten free noodles  <EOR> It's hip restaurant ambient lighting seats ramen bar communal seating center booths along edges  Seats around 50 max great big groups like 6 more     The ramen good very flavorful rich broth  jinya tonkotsu black pork chicken broth wasn't oily some ramen broths get  only complaint ton noodles but enough broth  Also char siu pork wasn't fatty I'd cut into thin flat strips I thicker cuts   did fall apart easily though showing slow cooked long time  whole egg perfectly cooked soft yolk inside but runny     My party fried shrimp balls which absolute best ever had!! fried crust just touch sweetness tasted cane sugar? nuts shrimp paste inside mix minced shrimp chopped shrimp larger pieces shrimp there  also some spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce shrimp ball making super moist delicious    We also tempura Brussels sprouts which miss  touch black truffle oil salt but didn't come typical tempura dipping sauce which like  didn't taste black truffle oil Brussels sprouts  truffle oil already almost bitter savory taste Brussels sprouts bit much me    Four stars mainly because music loud! bass pounding away semi shout chat others eating with  annoying 35 minutes didn't really sit savor everything    Service friendly  women's bathroom super high tech Japanese  flushing toilet takes some time because figure flush it  flush pressing tiny round button side bowl  don't touching toilets I usually flush pressing foot down flushing handle gross me  But appreciated super high tech toilet just bad home personally enjoy tmi! <EOR> Newly opened restaurant definitely few kinks work out  first problem shortage wait staff delayed seating patients  waited approximately 10 minutes table 4 even though empty table available whole time waited   party 2 walked since also waiting but several 2 seat options available whole time waited well     efficiency customer service definitely needs some work!  restaurant decor modern wood paneling   also large family dining style table center good large group   thing lacking lunch service   I think missing financially starting service 3pm       In regards appetizer options would say Jinya ranks #1 ramen restaurants even over Monta Chaya variety offerings   pork belly buns $3 80 each $3 during HH 3 5PM   pork belly extremely tender flavorful bun nice fluffy pretty much Peking duck but pork belly inside    also tried truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which tasty but better brussel sprouts i e  Yonaka    crispy chicken comes 5 10 15 piece orders extremely moist nice crispy exterior paired yuzu soy sauce  would definitely order chicken again   little disappointed when sat down waiter started listing off multiple items run i e takoyaki shrimp toast assari ramen etc    really good start half menu items missing unavailable = takoyaki fiend very sad hear ran out   waiter informed shrimp toast being removed menu    not sure why since he said delicious   In terms ramen following rankings Vegas 1  Kogashi ramen thick noodles Fukumimi 2  Tonkatsu black thick noodles Jinya 3  Tonkatsu thick noodles Monta The tonkatsu broth Jinya depth flavor broth very hearty   prefer broth over Monta since Monta often salty   ordered tonkatsu black which garlic oil chips chili paste whole seasoned egg nori kikurage fungus green onion nori flavor marriage items broth stand would say broth par Fukukimi's broth albeit different   pork belly quite fatty Monta's but flavorful tender similar Fukumimi's    thing leaves Jinya #2 rankings consistency noodles   noodles slightly overcooked some noodles clumped together ball      Hopefully work since think consistency noodles very important ramen experience   nice touch raw garlic free bring over garlic press fresh pressed garlic your hearts content    wait time ramen 15 20 minutes appetizers   they definitely lacking efficiency Monta   However if want sit chat place go   never feel rushing restaurant    definitely back try place another month guessing things even better then! <EOR> I LOVE place!!! few ramen places since just doesn't compare  Going again tonight fix    <EOR> I've twice  open late relatively affordable parking vegetarian vegan ramen option tasty   tried few vegetarian appetizers but wasn't into them much  <EOR> Everything want ramen place  menu includes variety styles satisfy most dietary preferences    Went weekend bit wait seated which reasonable  Service quick  4 instead 5 because much knowledge menu answered when asking questions appetizer whatever  But ramen place offended   Definitely worth shot if want nice hot bowl bad ass ramen <EOR> the food great service amazing major shout boy adam!!!
