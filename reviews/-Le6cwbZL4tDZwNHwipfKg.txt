Best Mediterranean food Vegas! <EOR> I think speak myself when say dining should only palatable experience but moral one  Now where taking 9 yr  old bride kosher neither middle aged man preying younger women social media especially women whose chastity bound oath God  Now does Marrakech's food? Absolutely nothing think   The chicken ordered sprinkled nuts some sort  Now fairly uneducated man frank ignorance quite uninhibited but think chicken's integrity compromised such gratuitous sprinkling cashews almonds walnuts  sauce curry think yellow sort man fishes women hijab artful keystrokes peacock exuberance wealth acquired young but earned few generations ago  Bootstraps come cheaper when your parents couldn't ever caught dead scraping bitumen barrel colonial pound week   Also most palatable spice food triple filtered tap water midriffs swishing around table tents    The food okay atmosphere loud talking melange Indian funk gut wrenching undertones pedophilia consorting babble PIE languages smell caterpillar smoke  <EOR> The atmosphere service great food awesome!! once am hooked  <EOR> Great restaurant   Husband visiting Las Vegas never Moroccan food decided give try   We NO idea expect seated sat around goons minute despite fact restaurant big placard right inside front door describing expect      As mentioned most reviews prix fixe menu $40 person serving six courses   No menu necessary     Everything very good   highlight 'salad' really more appetizer plate but described menu salad served third course beets carrots hummus tzatziki olives   Loved it   steak skewers also fabulous   chicken couscous pretty bland but time stuffed great food could forgive this   Also worth note dessert   Holy cow   big fan dessert but amazing   a huge plate something similar baklava   Lots phyllo dough walnuts honey some type fruit pear?  apple? baked   lots it!

Belly dancing nice extra  Good service  only dish issues chicken plate very bland only dish didn't seconds of  <EOR> We spent New Year's 2012 eve there  unique dining experience alright nevermore thank you  fun  tasty  Disappointing every respect    My husband Moroccan  Naturally high expectations place knowing taste Moroccan cuisine  Trust taste dishes could more disappointing  guys call yourself Moroccan restaurant when cook cous cous without basic ingredients?!?! cous cous cooked without pumpkin potato chickpeas!!

Worth every penny although 4 people only $45 per person which steal considering incredible environment ambiance entertainment available impeccable taste decor style flair  We now regular stop trek Las Vegas  disappointed unless don't good food fantastic entertainment  <EOR> One word AWESOME!!! =D  I Vegas last week best friend's bachelorette birthday weekend  While planning needed figure dinner location would fit occasion expensive prefix meal  came across Marraheck Moroccan bride be's approval made reservation  When arrived restaurant though transported fancy tent Morroca decorations beautiful lot drapery  little issue seating first because all side couches side table not very good conversation when asked switched another table more chairs other side table waiter accomedating grabbed chairs another table could 3 girls side table 4 girls other side  HOWEVER must say waiter made original rudeness because when ordered meal told vegan girl cannot eat cinammon he made sure meals fitted needs  two belly dancers performed during night super fun watch  Especially when pushed bride dance  6 course meal wow   everything absolutely delicious! going clubbing dinner didn't plan eating much since didn't want little belly but COULD stop eatting! Everything just good! When dessert came made small no cinnamon vegan accomedate diets allergic vegan  super nice them that  forgot mention yelp deal didn't 15% discount but happy meal don't care  great meal great ambiance great people =   <EOR> I made yelp account just write restaurant review  If could give them ZERO stars would! parents going Vegas first time celebrate 25th anniversary first time gone trip together just two them having 4 kids difficult them away! Well saw great reviews restaurant groupon deal bought gift them  showed restaurant RUDE lady front told them since didn't reservation can't eat if wanted eat would come back ANOTHER DAY other restaurants area should try something else  F WORD!??? poor parents used taking cabs we live suburbs asked if could help call them cab said yeah we'll call someone but you're going wait outside  WOULDN'T EVEN LET PARENTS WAIT INSIDE CAB!! December winter double checked website did see mandatory reservation required anywhere!!!! While waited outside 45 mins people walking looked stared no cab ever came  dad hail cab outside main streets them   They decided restaurant weds night 6 30 rudely turned away cabbing hotel cab back  mom said she never felt lowly degraded embarrassed before awful customer service horrible way end 25th anniversary  Really Marrakech    no room WEDNESDAY night fit 2 people?! asking them leave your restaurant? writing owner letter  DISAPPOINTED! <EOR> saw Philip's review month ago reminded eating firefly dragonfly several times need hit place    'm trying figure place $$  price very reasonable get  liked everything especially shrimp chicken ain't high end stuff but decent     my roomie convinced dancer trying pick all say DREAMS !!

Great ethnic Moroccan cuisine belly dancers beautiful atmosphere  Wish could eat everyday  price might seem high first but swear worth every penny! <EOR> food good definitely different culture  Everyone recieved six different dish <EOR> TL DR Overpriced underspiced   Cons worth $40 dinner  Maybe $30 but still pushing me The soup clearly tasted cheap Campbell's vegetable soup no flavor tin taste  Bread okay nothing special clearly purchased factory  Everything underspiced little bland which sucks because things love and expect! food region flavor  red wine good but $11 glass good  Maybe $6   Pros kebabs yummy put couple drops lemon juice them different flavor  Can't wrong hummus cucumbers  shrimp though bit tough nice sauce  Dessert yummy well coffee they give mint tea but ask coffee instead   Chicken pretty good  Large portions party 3 plenty food around  Decor lovely dancing girls crowd pleaser  Service spot on   I think once nice restaurant experience authentic food but management losing money wanted more money cut corners food  Typical but sad  Marrakesh fresh soup your own bread  Stop outsourcing  Add little love flavor into food  You're doing yourselves any favors Americanizing your menu  Sure advertise tourists    but locals myself would regular thing if better food? want someone spend money once many times?  Until kitchen order chef line won't back  <EOR> The husband took birthday both enjoyed entertainment food   loved everything place  restaurant very cozy intimate  even pour rose water over your hands wash them your table   experience itself hands down amazing!  Now gotta come HUNGRY cause offer 6 course meal yes 6 courses must say time main course FULL  Probably fault since loaded Morroccan bread But bread dipped shrimp scampi sauce   heaven!  especially loved hummus babaganoush plate  If you're love roasted eggplant you'll love babaganoush packed much flavor! beef kabobs yummy wished offered more especially since thought main course but wrong  main course came honestly already stuffed just couldn't eat anymore  Which okay since wasn't impressed chicken couscous  chicken dry side think only thing enjoyed veggies plate  But if love sweets you'll love dessert though   reminded huge baklava puffed up  yummy!  Now entertainment main reason husband took birthday belly dancers  first time both fun! two dancers night  did dance dancers  fun experience since she teaching both belly dance She made experience even better    All all would definitely recommend place  service received entertainment food  <EOR> Excellent food wine entertainment atmosphere dining experience! 50 times! <EOR> I would give 5 stars but nearly put hole pocket $40 person   bad since didn't look price menu before walking BUTI left SA TIS FIED!
