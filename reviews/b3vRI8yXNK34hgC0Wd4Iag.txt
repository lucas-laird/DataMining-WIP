BBQ Pork Always favorite mine   juicy tangy just it  Tsao Chicken always crowd pleaser   tanginess tartness dish just well any rice dish   Probably favorite dish bunch  Shrimp Fried Rice Talk abundance shrimp   literally 2 3 shrimps every spoonful!   So give place solid 3 stars   location convenience definitely something consider   price each dish ranges $8 $15 which reasonable given you're Las Vegas hotel   If portions only tad larger then would've 4 stars  <EOR> I Chin Chin New York New York hotel Casino Las Vegas evening service water Oscar incredible  He very personable polite  boyfriend said if ever come back Vegas because great service   Vegas roll course since Vegas seemed fitting did disappoint  celebrating birthday Oscar rest wait staff brought amazing complimentary cheesecake  Highly recommend  <EOR> Great service!

Wide variety food fresh delicious!! lettuce wraps delish!! <EOR> Chin Chin Café located New York New York Casino  staff extremely friendly  came two occasions  first time came assorted rolls specials  assorted rolls cucumber philly rolls spicy tuna rolls crab roll  could already tell biting into rolls fresh  However waiter very efficient attentive which made eating experience pleasurable  Then next morning breakfast buffet which also okay  selection buffet quite limited including traditional fare eggs bacon sausage hash browns  items okay  appearances breakfast appetizing  Also two choices cereal but only actually available  Also only whole milk  Again least waitress quite friendly attentive  <EOR> The service excellent  Really nice waiter staff  God okay  flavor decent dish where lacking other dish  Kinda pricey Chinese food  <EOR> This review more bar front  don't really care food  If feeling adventurous love fruity drinks much then place you  all sort exotic fruit drinks  favorite came mango  even some pomegranate  SUPER YUMMY! Also bartender super cool making new if didn't BUT LOVED THEM ALL!!! <EOR> It's decent its cold taste microwave but service excellent waitress excellent but quality not <EOR> After walking around New York New York  only seeing steak pizza pasta happy find Chin Chin  Pineapple rice delicious sushi roll fresh   exactly looking for  <EOR> Pedro best waiter! Understood time schedule offered replace sweet slightly sour soup  <EOR> Sunday Brunch = Runny eggs oddly seasoned breakfast potatoes slew underwhelming dishes however decent sausage bacon pot stickers above average table service kept dining experience above water  fair amount steam tray options cooks seemed top keeping everything fresh refilled   For worth $15  guess more convenience dining if you're staying NYNY walking Denny's elsewhere  <EOR> I disappointed last outing Chin Chin   large Hot Sour Soup shredded pork carrots green onions tofu jalapenos egg consumed myself very good slightly crisp Chicken Spring Roll wrappers good but insides just okay very flavorful   keep dipping deep fried morsels Sweet Sour Sauce enjoy some taste   now stick Vegetable Shrimp Spring Rolls     Shrimp Garlic Snow Peas featured good sized succulent shrimp tasty snow peas small mushroom pieces but could done without carrots would enjoyed delicate crystal White Sauce better dark Brown Sauce which dish immersed   Cashew Shrimp prepared much lighter Brown Sauce liked whole lot better   I only describe Orange Chicken weird   consisted large chunks chicken peppers onions glazed Orange Sauce but all typical breed Cantonese fare   Szechuan String Beans okay but unremarkable   Most disappointing all Small Egg Fried Rice scallions   rice richly bathed soy based Brown Sauce first sighting no visible egg it   pointed server he volunteered take back dish more egg added which let do   Although improved even upon its return rice did sport much egg   Hot Tea good pot lasted quite awhile   But end dinner even unusual Chocolate Dome consisting Dark Chocolate Ganache exposed Chocolate Mousse white cake inside possibly honey soaked being cracked open could save day rather ordinary meal   Our server very good accommodating   surroundings featured dark woods white linen tablecloths comfortable pleasant   But just many other better Chinese restaurants Las Vegas now experienced way return here  <EOR> This just breakfast buffet service   charged 7 year full price   Why would kid's price?  Service awful   girl somewhat nice but artificial?  word?  don't even know   Food 2 1 2 stars   All females trashy   Nice but trashy   Service slow   Didn't come when she did appeared major chore her   bad  <EOR> 3 0 Stars  I walking through New York New York noticed Chinese eatery option  Vegas conference figured I'd gives place try some variety typical conference food   To layout expectations grew San Francisco where actually spoiled Chinese food big portioned cheap tasty   I decided order Singapore Noodles $12 95   noticed noodle dish didn't Hot Spicy symbol decided ask them little more spicy me   dish consisted of *Shrimp *BBQ Pork *Bean Sprouts *Onions *Bell Peppers *Rice Noodles *Curry Sauce  When plate came noticed HUGE  saw giant mound noodles ready tackle it!    The noodles themselves done nicely where still little springiness   stir fried curry sauce but wasn't able taste much curry flavor   Even though asked them spicy actually just added some roasted chili peppers into dish  server nice enough though bring some extra chili sauce    I poked around noodles noticed really sparing ingredients  found myself actually eating lot noodles before any shrimp BBQ pork   Chin Chin does decent job providing traditional Chinese food casual café setting  server overall really nice attentive   price reasonable Las Vegas but terms flavor taste still made long some cooking back home  <EOR> We breakfast buffet   Wow place gets mixed reviews me   First he price reasonable $18 breakfast buffet bad   food actually pretty good problem buffet stocked very well all first time three quarters food empty   server funny nice but he very slow busy but place packed   But when food stocked pretty good left happy  <EOR> Food B Price B Location A Authenticity D Customer Service C  Chin Chin located New York New York Hotel any means authentic Chinese restaurant   serve Americanized Chinese food which isn't bad thing but when comes poor service experience just isn't great   We lucky enough wait table   Friday night restaurant wasn't busy should first inclination maybe should dined elsewhere   hostess pretty friendly welcoming   However server different story   She attitude apparent she hates job   She kind rushed while ordering basically threw something really didn't ask for   She took liberty ordering sampler appetizers us   Even though knew she did didn't decline unsure appetizers anyway     The food good great said definitely authentic Chinese food   fried rice very similar Panda Express Chinese fast food chain really nothing special there   Mongolian Beef pretty tasty but overloaded green onions   I'd say Sweet Sour Pork appetizer sampler winners meal   thought strange sushi menu   didn't care give try because don't Chinese restaurants Japanese food   some pretty good cocktails but prepared spend some money them   expect restaurant hotel Strip   Would dine again?  Probably not  <EOR> Great restaurant large portion sizes  salmon crunch roll amazing! Also ordered fried wontons senchuan dumplings great too! Loved koriander sauce dumplings  <EOR> I unfortunately ended Chin Chin breakfast buffet due group consensus  All regular breakfast items represented along some Asian items Fried Rice Egg Foo Young BBQ Pork etc    Coffee juice also included  Everything seemed OK nothing unusual until running washroom NYNY Casino barf everything I'd just eaten  could only handle orange juice when came back  personally think breakfast foods should eaten buffet style! Never again! <EOR> Always great dinner Chin Chin  Food great  Fresh  Tasty  Never disappoints  Oscar M gave great service well  Would highly recommend Godzilla roll!  always menu but ask it!! <EOR> The lunch time buffet absolutely amazing! food incredibly delicious buffet sushi actually really good buffet  plenty vegetarian options if vegetarian  favorite noodles  highly recommend place if hotel want cheap delicious buffet  <EOR> It first time Vegas friends dying sushi  sad say isn't best place that  rolls priced expected sushi but dinkiest saddest excuse rolls I'd ever seen    The noodles however exquisite  even tried bite friend's tangerine beef  I'm big meat eater but delicious  <EOR> Wow Chin Chin under rated  surprised nobody ever told hidden NYNY   My group stopped quick lunch opted buffet  thought good deal since most single entrees $15 buffet approx $19   The buffet isn't HUGE your exclusive hotel buffets but just right size    I expected food taste your typical greasy inauthentic Chinese food but wrong! food light salty just right amount everything   Ooooo dessert bar die for! liked everything here  service wonderful I'd eat again  <EOR> Great value money! Wonderful friendly staff  second visit come again! <EOR> The food expensive using professional chef   fried rice under cooked like steamed rice no flavor   Chow Mein no flavor extremely salty   returning again  The service good though  <EOR> Meh  Food decent enough nothing write home about  definitely better tasting Asian food  Portions decent  Service ok  Waitress kept forgetting bring wife's wine  finally flag down remind her  already half way through drink    no customer service recovery  admit pay Vegas prices!!! really isn't worth it  <EOR> First o know travel most time myself said most amazing times Chin Chin!!! three people bar awesome made feel family members  Never felt alone sitting Dana most attentive bartenders ever met!!!
