Basically call beef noodle soup  But certain things must consider before generalizing dish  broth example  Normally when beef broth must brown bones oven order brown color shine  soup unique because take raw ox leg bones boil hell them  very milky colored broth  But flavor definetely beef   Traditionally soup only served oxtail bones some brisket  E Jo expanded themselves offering myriad beef parts including tongue tendons tripe  because offal definetely something different am used soup but appreciate eitherway  Another great aspect dish clear sweet potato noodles located near bottom bowl give soup great texture  Also salt chili pepper located tables if feel if soup lacking bit seasoning  tend soup kinda bland but thats just me   On another visit able try hangover soup haejangguk  thought korean hangover soup well made well  bean paste soup  loaded bean sprouts cabbage beef brisket  thought seasoning point definetely cured hangover its intention  But thought thing missing really could taken over top  usually served pieces coagulated ox blood  E Jo does any  think if added would completed dish   Ban chan or side dishes usually kept minimum seolleongtang restaurant  case because want preserve simplicity flavor bowl soup  typically kimchi some raw chili peppers which spicy  But let record saying    E Jo best kimchi town  just don't mean really good awesome    talking BEST! know you're going Yea right Mike sure uh huh believe outta town pssshhh hold phone other stuff  Trust one  Just it  else  else nothing   The prices OK world great but just OK  service also pretty good well  place usually never crazy busy   even though should be   more likely service pretty good  enjoy getting kimchi fix place cure any hangover no matter large small  even if aren't hungover food believer  Just much believe you  <EOR> I've never Korean food breakfast before   first time yelped Korean breakfast really it!  OMG! Good stuff! <EOR> A very traditional Korean restaurant located east ish side down located little south SLS Sahara    This isn't first time restaurant but guess never wrote review  restaurant specializes soups where some may refer home cooking     Parking located back side restaurant street  restaurant quite number tables seats pictures various soups wall TV Korean channel on    Every time gotten same dish beef brisket soup Seolleongtang  ox bone soup made various beef bones meat  may seem very simple soup but time taken soup such nice milky white unimaginable    Unlike some other more popular Korean restaurants 10 banchan side dishes  Instead more traditional restaurants experienced Seoul where homemade kimchi homemade pickled daikon  Unlike Seoul bring two whereas Seoul virtually every table  sharing plate pick kimchi daikon scissors cut smaller sizes    When soup arrives given bowl rice eat soup side bowl chopped green onions chili paste  soup unseasoned but each table small thing salt where season your soup your liking    Very clean simple soup  Very good but light heavy meal'ed night those just through sickness shouldn't eating heavy yet  Should nice hangover soup *cough cough* hahaha ! Aside bowl rice soup place slices super tender brisket some rice noodles    This probably best place Seolleongtang vegas because aren't many places offer first place    Side note Theres also really good located near korea town LA called Han Bat Sul Lung Tang  If definitely that  two things serve restaurant  <EOR> As much travel around United States really hard find good Korean food outside of Los Angeles   Thank goodness Vegas some decent stuff   Saved life!  some suh lung tang morning warming stomach   If you're hungover craving some hot Korean soup spot   Great service! <EOR> Summary All soups delicious great treat when temperature cold outside  Often 3 times week dependent fact if hangover drinking if want something salty heart warming  more less chicken noodle soup Asians   Decor Very cute Korean inside love Korean TV playing background  chopsticks pots bowls even kimchi presented very cute   Service Great service since server found party Korean she explained eat soup properly adding salt onion meat dipping sauce cold dish peppers etc     Price Ox tail soup comes pleasant expensive 15 99 while best bang buck favorite would #2 which include all sorts meat intestine 12 99   basic Brisket Beef Soup 11 99  All soups very well priced high but no steal sure   Final Thoughts Delicious good cold days  if drinking sick soup die for  <EOR> The hubs came friends when LV bachelor party weekend said sullong tang very good  when LV parents he brought them some much needed Korean food for them us     The food all great parents very happy but winner actually kimchi served every table  bring two small clay pots cabbage kimchi other raddish kimchi  day visit cabbage kimchi bleh but raddish kimchi definitely winner  finished everything clay pot asked more!   The next time LV craving Korean food definitely back E Jo fix! <EOR> Extremely Authentic extremely fresh   I originally gave place 3 stars but really does deserve 4 higher can't punish establishment simply because Korean little outside comfort zone   The atmosphere simple homey  restaurant few miles strip looks questionable part town though no idea area REALLY like    The employees very sweet very kind  said place extremely authentic expect communication little difficult  However tell used having English speaking customers happy assist you    The food said little outside comfort zone  buckwheat noodles delicious but very difficult bowl even more difficult bite through  All beef tasted tender delicious absolutely no complaints    I would back heart would just little more research types Korean food I'd try first  <EOR> Came tonight bc such high ratings needed Korean restaurant Korean mom Korean Aunt need always eat Korean food  Anyway grabbed taxi Wynn where staying weekend over  hindsight should've just driven but lazy car parking structure  cost $11 cab fare there  Then paid $5 tip  know  Dumb  actually worse way back  owner restaurant called Korean cab back hotel  He charged $20!!! ripoff!!

Why would ask since some yelp reviews confirmed seolleongtang? Well menu didn't it   She pretty much told Yes no  Then she explained #1 menu beef brisket soup very closed seolleongtang however little different  couldn't really remember exactly she said but she mentioned ingredients being bit more expensive version but very close  both friend ordered beef brisket soup dinner    She gave extra green onions hot pepper paste peppers meat sauce bean paste I think   banchan only two kimchi spicy radish  thought quite interesting because never given actual peppers before also never given meat sauce hot pepper paste when ordered seolleongtang before  big kimchi fan but even find kimchi very good  looked tasted fresh  liked radishes well but typically radishes more vinegar haha    Then soup came  relatively quick might say  warning though  Those used flavors msg thick broths     isn't going that  beef brisket soup lack better word bland  Chinese call ching which clean  But okay! all sodium lovers those just want bit more flavor salt every table! adjust salt your liking which love most soup  oh she right beef brisket soup VERY close seolleongtang  differences noticed E Jo's noodles white versus clear glass noodles used to  Also E Jo's broth base seems bit thinner compared before  end everything dandy  craving D  Over all awesome service tonight  Attentive workers  Yummy food  Win me  definitely coming back next time try oxtail soup while friend wants try oxknee soup Come give place try experience Korean cuisine different light  <EOR> Amazing Sul Lung Tung! also many other soup options those partied way hard Vegas   GUILTY!
