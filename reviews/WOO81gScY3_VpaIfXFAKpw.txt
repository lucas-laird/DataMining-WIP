DESSERTS Bananas Foster Panna Cotta  The bananas foster amazing!  Served house made vanilla bean ice cream which beautifully tones down sweetness all carmelly goodness bottom dish    My Panna Cotta new experience found light flavorful  crazy gelatenous texture expecting something more custardy  Still satisfying finale terrific meal raspberry puree side die for! Unfortunately very little plate  I'd love if added menu dessert composed vanilla bean ice cream topped ridiculously yummy raspberry sauce!
