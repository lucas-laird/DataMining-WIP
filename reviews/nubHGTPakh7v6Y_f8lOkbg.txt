I CANNOT believe all positive review CRAPHOLE!  I based reviews worst experiences sushi place EVER   Went bit apprehensive given seating all abt 15 people max occupancy  Ordered some rolls lo behold first 4 rolls comes 30mins later! starved pissed  Oh but guess expected capacity     FIFTEEN PEOPLE! Each subsequent roll comes 10 15 mins apart FUCKing chinese water torture!  After over hour only 3 rolls asked check cause just couldn't bear waiting fopr 4th roll  Lady says want cancel last roll? Politely but curtly answered yes    Well AHOLE wayne behind sushi bars spouts waitress wife he's gonna charge fourth roll anyway! He said loudly enough GF heard it   I FUCK he is  pissed ready rumble  If check comes back last roll gonna start flipping tables over! Bad enough trickle fed mediokre lames ass rolls now contend shitbag wayne because he bad day can't handle volume business   Luckily bill came back without last roll it  Guess wife convinced he being D bag having bad day   To honest decor shoddy disheveled cases crap all over place small  don't feeling all eating aNyplace special    This place local crowd often could tell he wife knew everyone ther EXCEPT us!   Crowd also kind white trash evidenced POS cars parking lot t shirt jeans wearing  kept checking car window sure tires still hookers tapping windows   Sorry all those folks gave SHITHOLE great reviews but time Yelp system let down where based reviews   Look know y'all looking place gonna see review say hey only bad review all LETS GO!
