Prices cheap menu diverse setting very casual  Good nowhere decisions grab bite some place local   Some favorites include Hawaiian Spam Eggs plate no clue called menu Stack pancakes syrup  Only issue prevents giving five star rating no late night dining  Going late forces over TGI Friday which lot more over priced monotone franchise cookie cutter foods  <EOR> This dining experience didn't start off well  waited 5 minutes hostess arrive front  But redemption  entire staff's service top notch  courteous food came promptly party five people drinks frequently refilled  seems wanted customers more satisfied which were  service better expected par good fine dining service  cafe wasn't loud well    4 5 stars service perfect if wasn't little mishap beginning     Food 3 5 stars    The Monte Cristo sandwich sounded really good time  decided switch original choices Fillet Salmon Philly Cheesesteak  other members ordered those seemed enjoy them very much  However wasn't happy sandwich  seemed overcooked fried crispy outside  inside ok  Fries decent  vegetables other dishes greasy  chicken satay pieces little small bit salty  2 5 3 stars all those    On plus side bread above average  seemed everyone else enjoyed meal  tried some Porterhouse Steak baked potato both really nicely flavored  Delicious! considering getting next time around  Iced tea good well  5 stars all those items    Price 4 5 stars    The total $92 5 entrees 2 appetizers few drinks  Pretty good restaurant located inside casino  super cheap but quality service can't ask much more    Overall awesome experience  If area I'd definitely stop again  Thanks Cafe Siena! <EOR> Can't complain food service    I enjoyed porterhouse dinner which included baked potato veggies side salad    Came close closing time but still served wife smile    Thanks good food service past midnight!

This restaurant located just off casino next hotel tower elevators    A must if you're staying Suncoast   Not sure why few negative reviews    <EOR> My family decided come eat cafe Suncoast honestly worst service had  First off waited almost hour food  ordered club sandwich parents sister ordered porterhouse $16 each   all ordered medium well done  However when received them EACH steak wasn't properly cooked it well done extremely dry even burned some parts   The waitress took order back but decided just cancel order given already waited almost hour  also asked manager told he would take care situation took care check which now only consisted Pepsi club sandwich took home  What's worse customers all around complaining service food  family plan come back again  <EOR> So start off any casino cafe serves Chinese food well burgers breakfast seems bit fishy but anyway gave try bad decision first all having drawing casino over loud speaker loud waitress couldn't hear orders which very irritating secondly waitress very stubborn NO SUBSTITUTIONS no matter what! reason place even deserves 1 star ambiance restaurant interior well decorated ill give them however food which took 50 mins arrive actually ok nothing great but completely terrible omelette alright pretty much you'd expect cafe but hash browns white cooked properly all soggy only drenching them ketchup consumable  All all place bad choice didn't try Chinese food probably shouldn't because mean if couldn't basic cafe food right don't want imagine would ruin much more complex Chinese food  <EOR> After room service food debacle night before hoping breakfast Cafe Siena would much better experience  If food warm inviting staff place would firing all cylinders   Unfortunately wasn't anything write home about   My partner your basic two eggs bacon hash browns combo coffee he confirmed everything he came okay  Unfortunately couldn't say same all Breakfast Burrito home fries   Burrito itself barely warmed swear somebody thought waving match over fries cooked them because barely warmed through   waitress trade them some same delicious looking hash browns other half scarfed down  could tell Bite even though crust them perfect pretty much 'heat and serve' variety  Coffee kind 'strength' where suspect somebody reused grounds making first time fresh pot    I scratched Cafe Siena off dance card terms repeat performance   But terrific service give extra star  <EOR> I hope nowhere go  Ive waiting 45 minutes far all ordered cheeseburger  place isn't busy just slow <EOR> Cafe Siena decent restaurant  aren't crazy expensive but don't $2 99 steak eggs either  waiters great experienced  There's never usually long wait line but place hardly ever empty   There's nothing would really suggest menu b c nothing stands out  though think pretty good Chinese food being Chinese food restaurant   If feeling hungry don't feel paying TGI Fridays other semi fancy restaurants Suncoast would suggest going here  <EOR> The fact spam portuguese sausage eggs served King's Hawaiian bread rolls stick rice place decent coffee shop  Price just right server came ample time sure well taken care of  would definitely come again definitely recommend quick breakfast fix!
