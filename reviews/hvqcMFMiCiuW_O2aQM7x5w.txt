Good food overall  gone lunch number times best options area  Service great family owned price right    They started credit card fee which guess OK but think would better hide fee food price  never seen place charge $3 credit fee $60 order  fee nice option $20 less meals  Many places wont let use your card when cheap  <EOR> We ordered several times online alright but time decided stop by   quite surprised must say quaint comfort cafe   waitress extremely kind helpful   She gave great suggestions waited table promptness   Sometimes hesitate quality restaurant corner gas station plaza but am glad above expectations   Never judge book its cover     The hummus pita delicious   greek salad huge   chicken kabob bit salty taste buds  <EOR> Crunchy falafel sandwich   like hard dried out  happy all   will return  Also took quite while get my order  overpriced u get  <EOR> I usually thoroughly enjoy experience here    however last time ordered extremely disappointed several things  ordered food through 24 hour food delivery website use  ordered cheeseburger added fries philly everything which says includes fries 2 16 oz  Sprites    Every time ordered Ambrosia Cafe received food 20 min  less don't know if management owners changed but case time! didn't food 45 min  hour! boy delivered did receipt when asked one  Once food house opened dig fries cheeseburger cold sprites watered down because melted ice philly no fries it  then made phone call Ambrosia Cafe  girl answered phone told just received order missing order fries  She then told did come fries extra  quickly let know menu online states Philly Everything does come fries  She then tells she didn't even know website but fries only served particular sandwich lunch time  let know menu website says nothing then asked speak manager  She told no manager time but she would let know  Yeah right!!!! finally just off phone because she clearly no clue place work all! plan calling back again trying manager phone if person speak someone  am usually pretty easy going person but being lied most certainly expect pay for  Needless say probably ordering Ambrosia Cafe ever again! Hope review helps someone! Thanks listening! <EOR> Food good prices even better   Service slow but why rush?  Enjoy meal especially since don't music blaring over your head but very tranquil setting where focus flavors especially lamb rice soup <EOR> I agree another reviewer cafe changed hands since last visit   new wait staff obviously unfamiliar restaurant business  sandwiches may good but pizza all cheese no taste  <EOR> Located just down street home family returned place last 3 4 years whenever Mediterranean good craving hit  food nothing really special but convenient location coming back few times throughout year  gyros filled flavorful meat tzatziki very good  Greek fries die for  falafel dense heavily spiced cumin taste  Before today place would earned solid  3 stars  But today returned brother fam lunch served RAW chicken wings! Totally unacceptable! server very gracious when informed even offered fresh batch which declined  She came back table few minutes later asked undercooked pieces she could show cool  really annoyed because if cook didn't believe needed proof! Definitely coming back  <EOR> Great service food here   everything yummy  every pizza good  ordered appl platter gyro sandwiches margarita pizza  amazing  would highly recomend place anyone they also great lunch special delivery too    One thing! no credicard !! cash only unless u want pay extra 50 cent  <EOR> I ate lunch daughter while waited wife hair done   little cheese burger fries fresh juicy   ate Beef shish kabob meal   wasn't bad but could better   lady served nice friendly  <EOR> Ordered takeout Friday  Lady quick easy order phone  told 15 17 half minutes which made laugh    Pulled place noticed nice little patio setup table chairs front  Looked pretty cozy  Walked inside coziness continued  impressed inside even little fireplace going  Food already bagged ready go  Paid order quickly left    As food wasn't overly impressed but happy was  Falafel sandwich  falafel big meaty sandwich good $5 95  Also Ambrosia appetizer plate wife  Grapeleaves very good  Tzatziki good Hummus Tabbouleh OK    Was bit disappointed chicken parm sub though  sure if anyone told them but chicken chicken parm should breaded  strips chicken salad covered cheese sauce  tasted good but definitely missing breading great chick parm  <EOR> We love cafe   food always fresh something everyone   daughter thinks falafel pita best   lentil soup also very delicious  <EOR> I love place eat least once week  service always great delivery for when feel lazy quick  usually hummus served lot warm pita bread lamb sandwich pork chops all delicious  <EOR> Love place   Never crowded which shame free wifi   don't understand why every local business wants lunch crowd doesn't offer free wifi yet   Anywho really great tasty food reasonable prices falafel pizzas kabobs gyros amazing cheese steaks  ate 3 times week   true Greek lovers lamb lentil soups legit  <EOR> Let start saying Vegas   and three years lived always chuckle all places say pizza xxxxxx  delivery cool because order EAT24 online using card PayPal   everything yummy   every pizza good margarita pizza delivered perfectly cooked thin  we app platter hummus grape leaves EVERYTHING super yummy  Gryo sandwiches yummy if vegetarian Ambrosia sandwich avocado lettuce parsley tomato tzh sauce no Gryo meat it  we eaten restaurant also young guy waiter prompt very nice  on location hubby lamb beef skewers rice portion HUGE pics ones stack boxes ceiling BUT second time even though table eating sat down 20 minutes never waited period  hit miss try place pita yummy feta always fresh  we just can't help love food really need try Turkish coffee see if standards <EOR> We ONLY 2 restaurant should clue  But sat down ordered anyway since hungry   falafel came 10 minutes although th waitress didn't know if made breadcrumbs gluten free  took chance since she said mix only said spices  Very brown crrispy outside barely cooked inside good obviously oil hot   chicken wings came  when finished plate  But he send them back cook more since he asked them extra well done only golden non crispy fries  tried excuse well done but sauce them soft takes off browner  coloring cooked skin ?? Finally redid order he ate could leave satisfied but no longer starved  won't seeing again  <EOR> Ambrosia no longer business   food decent always extremely fresh tomatoes but those days gone   location being replaced new sushi restaurant  <EOR> Worst tasting gyro ever  gyro delivered didn't any flavor  put very little lamb it  more pita bread anything else  baklava tiny piece put weird red sauce drizzled it  Why would dessert should taste honey pistachio?  At least delivery guy prompt nice  Going back paymons  Oh well  <EOR> I wanting eat few months now never chance  Finally able sneak over during lunch hour  first impression when walking wow nice place  exterior assumed would order counter take type place which case all  reviewing wide range food menu decided lamb sandwich go    My order took maybe 5 7 minutes arrive door  Food very tasty $8 plan visit them more regular basis  <EOR> I've going Ambrosia since Winter  2009   sure if changed ownership but recently some menu items changed deleted  Plus wait staff seems younger dumber   few months back  kind experienced  woman waitress  seemed replace some kid probably previously  worked McDonalds   Not only did replace good waitress   When ask water bring cocktail glass two straws! Maybe ran tall cups night  lol  don't know    As food great!  But would recommend take oppose dine in  <EOR> I printer today drop off some files right lunch time  did quick yelp search came across place  wanting something fairly healthy greek mediterranean sounded fabulous  place right street headed over high hopes let say more hoping quickly lunch   I only other table but place really cute lady behind counter told find seat  found nice little two seater high top corner  She quickly brought menu perused offerings  really mood hummus but wanted something more substantial well  noticed gyro fries ordered hummus platter  Luckily she smart just ordered gyro because know wouldn't needed those fries    Hummus Pita YUM YUM YUM  only meant eat half pita but good grief good hummus smooth kept shoveling in  swear she probably thought coming off fast  boxed other half ordered more pita later  dreaming now   Gyro never fond gyros but all doubts squelched! More yummy soft warm pita topped fabulous meat  usually gyros dry but ONE  tatziki amazing too  took no time polish thing off    Tatziki love love love tatziki stuff above beyond good  was is tasty order platter enjoy home  thing love tatziki tends last good bit time put good tupperware slathering some grilled chicken dinner tonight   Service service good she quiet friendly  secretly loved she accent because tells place probably family owned  Also probably why good   This new favorite place luckily starting busy season going Creel regular basis  really can't wait try other things menu  If kabobs pizza anything close good then heaven  <EOR> Yay gyros! Ambrosia which really good definitely come back try hummus  TIP Bring cash!!! 3 4 2013 charge  50cent per card transaction no minimum <EOR> I highly advise stay away restaurant  ordered beef kabobs  instead having veggies stick meat sauteed veggies separately threw together kabobs  lazy meat extremely fatty  Almost no flavor food  <EOR> As detailed another review come area work once while we're always looking good lunch place   Ambrosia little everything soup sandwiches pizza lasagna   little Mediterranean little Italian etc   The lunch specials well priced service excellent food never disappointed   If you're area give them try place deserves succeed  <EOR> We never ordered before decided pretty standard Mediterranean things lamb kebab 2 kofta kebab house salad gyro cold cucumber dill soup I forget exact name  food delivered quickly but husband missing kofta kebab  try those picky people but $45 expect everything there  However everything tasted wonderful I'd definitely eat again next time restaurant  <EOR> When walked place empty usually  great sign  looked nice kind early sat down  ordered gyro Ambrosia salad based server's suggestion  Both great  gyro stuffed meat Ambrosia salad bite sized chopped veggies light mediterranean dressing  chopped apples walnuts whew  far job would def stop back try falafel  <EOR> Quick stop Ambrosia Cafe couple late night take items   Ambrosia Cafe blend Italian Mediterranean food which isn't far offer   Both cuisines happen 1 2 favorites list big fan     I ordered Gyro because figured safe bet pleased purchase   partner crime Ashley D Cheesesteak extra cheese let say she knows she doing   thing epic      cheese meat deli roll      mmmmm delish   Definitely satisfied Ambrosia would love dine in sometime soon try other menu items  <EOR> My buddy came craving gyros chicken fingers  restaurant large spacious but well ventilated  air inside warm humid  staff friendly though    We placed orders chicken fingers gyro  15 minutes later food served  figured chicken fingers would safe since pretty standard everywhere go  batter was    different  When stabbed chicken fork batter just kind disintegrated fell onto plate   like shell  When ate texture taste bit similar would Long John Silver's  didn't taste bad all just felt wrong mouth   The gyro looked awesome  like your typical gyro stuffed meet onions tomato cucumber lettuce tzaziki sauce  wasn't best wasn't worst  satisfies craving   Overall ok  would back only because close  <EOR> The food good ton variety but nothing mind stands menu    I've ate few times since close house kebabs probably best thing but seems try hard put ton things menu  Pizza average best  <EOR> unfortunately change star rating ambrosia     After first couple tries thought ambrosia very good find especially important bc right next house     We ordered pick tonight i ordered philly everything clearly stated included fries gf ordered same ambrosia gyro she's all 3 times     My philly meh did include fries   reason poignant actually put special instruction field online says philly comes fries please add if just typo  Wouldn't huge deal if felt philly alone worth 7 99   more 5 99 philly imo     I noticed since last time ordered online time changed company use place orders   Perhaps why experience sub par  <EOR> Coworker decided try place couple weeks back since store quite close   Always willing try new place good reviews    Upon walk liked decore gives quite homey feeling    The wait staff extremly nice    They alot decently priced lunch specials   I ordered Gyro Sandwhich w Fries extremly tasty   good amout food price    I liked much took another co worker week 2 later   She enjoyed well    I definitly look forward going back trying something new menu  <EOR> Enjoyed here!  On spontaneous trip Vegas past Memorial Day weekend honor meeting some down earth peeps DJ David Chrissy whom introduced friend some local Mediterranean food off strip   After long drive needed quick bite eat before hitting nightlife scene convenient place us  small casual restaurant accomodates nearly all kinds foodies  from health conscious hard core carnivores    Waitress attentive seated almost immediately  liked colorful bright menu! Being indecisive am really couldn't wrong menu selection  Everything sounded familiar simple straight forward    I ordered Vegetarian Gyro sandwich tabouleh fresh veggies tzatziki sauce friend ordered Simply Best sandwich Authentic gyro meat lettuce tomatoes onions tzatziki sauce  Both $6 7 decent portion size   KEY IMPORTANCE Freshness!!!  Upon arrival quick service btw visually impressed setup freshness ingredients  Presentation important mouth salivating already  camera phone didn't justice though see pics but let tell you  as simple ingredients were   nothing beats good gyro but FRESH TOP QUALITY ingredients! THAT!!! tabouleh flavored nicely  Simple Delish!  My friend devoured sandwich seemed 3 bites maybe 2 half  all happened fast time looked he smiling look sweet utter satisfaction! According simply best  HAHA! maybe he just hungry?! =p  As me   I'm pretty slow eater  made sure chew 13 times before swallowed  haha  Okay  maybe 13 times but did let all flavors dance around mouth but only text soon meet rest crew 20 minutes! EEk! eat half took rest doggy bag style     Only 4 stars since restroom could used bit makeover  know but anal that  Anywhoo definitely head back Ambrosia Cafe try other menu items  hear Falafel Sandwich  Eggplant Parmesan sub HITS!  A great quick stop your Mediterranean fix on! <EOR> Excellent gyro fries tzatziki sauce but baklava little cold fresh fridge though tasted very nice  Would definitely return again <EOR> I love kebabs place close house really wanted love it   Unfortunately wasn't case  best part entire meal two cucumber slices salad  kebabs tasted crappy meatloaf rice big pile flavorless mush  Horrible putting lightly  <EOR> Great service  wasn't something menu explained wanted waitress made happen she just said ill   EXCELLENT!! atmosphere very much American cool Mediterranean chairs  Cool music  Good TV  friend gyro burger smells amazing! He says Delicious! food good  chicken well cooked juicy  Major plus+ rice just regular white Asian style rice  Just definitely wasn't authentic  issue splitting bill just helped solidify 4 stars  Good stuff I'd back  <EOR> Ambrosia Cafe decent reasonable Mediterranean restaurant Southwest  don't live areaa but saw fairly new restaurant decided stop in  little weary place serves Philly cheese steaks ribs pizza falafel even more weary when latter spelled 'felafel' menu but hungry some reasonable lunch specials  Considering first impression actually quite pleased lunch  ordered 'felafel' sandwich plate $6 99 which came good version tabbouleh undressed salad  realized eating half sandwich should put little salad inside since weird or kind interesting combination falafel hummus pickle peperoncini needed little color touch more crunch  falafel itself beautifully browned flavorful but could used bit more kick  hummus fine yet fairly standard tabbouleh salad properly done lots lemon juice  hummus tabbouleh Sunnin Los Angeles however am finding difficult draw comparisons become slightly disappointed two items elsewhere  portion lentil soup $3 99 huge but sure supposed judging way waitress move pace snail avoid spilling any over onto plate  appreciated care but unfortunately time wasn't super hot anymore  pleasant hint curry enjoyed but needed salt probably more flavorful stock  definitely improved once doctored leftovers back home later day  wasn't terribly impressed lunch yet better I'd expected content  isn't place would your way but if lived neighborhood wouldn't mind its presence would most likely frequent occasion they also deliver   <EOR> I love cafe mix food because lot times husband can't decide place both like  Mediterranean food sandwiches    even Pizza him    I Falafel Special came Falafel Sandwich side Tabbouleh  haven't Falafel years forgot tasted like  pleased when took bite sandwich good  Tabbouleh tasted really fresh zesty  could tell just made because wasn't soggy    My husband Cheese Steak Sandwich Greek Fries  fries salty taste but husband seemed it  wanted try something new didn't mind it    The atmosphere relaxing calm which nice change especially work  also liked music played while there  most likely Beatles Greatest Hits    when thought no around would sing along some songs  couldn't help it! When getting ready leave waiter asked if liked Beatles  thinking Oh no    Did sing loud ? told did hoping he wasn't subjected singing  refreshing he personable because just place feel more welcoming    The Ambrosia Cafe diverse menu almost impossible find something like! <EOR> This place favorite  they amazing gyro salad low carb lovers its always empty when but mostly take out good affordable food ever your craving The only thing didn't Bulgarian combo plate cheeseburger <EOR> I've never place but Delivery 4 times now    long day work wanna come home pup more time eat     So far EVERYTHING DELICIOUS!  Big portions fresh food nice flavors     They BEST RICE ever had   moist cooked perfectly unique flavor   Chicken Kabobs awesome   I've ribs twice Mediteranian Style which means bathed bbq sauce   Tender Juicy naturally flavorful just grilled onions top     Other rice other sides Meh   Beans potoato salad seem pre made   Deserts also seem pre bought but bad   Entree's price deliveries for the mediocre side stuff   I'm fan easy yummy delivery!

order delivery  Salads joke  ordered lasagna chicken parmagan pasta  Both gross  Plus worst humus ever eaten  2 thumbs down  guess shouldve tried kabobs gyros  But now ill never know bc deffinetly don't EVER plan eating again  <EOR> Not happy chicken ceasar salad  Bland salad very dry tough chicken  <EOR> My husband call place Pizza Kabobs because oddly spaced window signage   When feeling lazy which often tend pull box menus order some delivery    4 months ago tried Pizza Kabobs aka Ambrosia Cafe disappointed   Their menus vast variety part pizzeria part Mediterranean fare  felt need try little bit everything  73 dollars 15 minutes later LOT food door   Their gyros pretty darn good  life changing but excellent delivery expectations  love good shish kabob sandwich love beef  hummus great but little stingy pita bread  pita bread probably most memorable big favorite but when give big order hummus 3 pitas ain't gonna cover it  knew next time order extra pita bread   The pizza actually pretty good again expectations low because seemed Mediterranean calling  sauce cheese ratio awesome  wish bigger selection pizzas but Meatlovers loved both   Their phillys weren't bad either!! ordered philly everything meat well flavored fixins fantastic   We ordered them least 1x month since then while delivery time isn't always consistent one time waited hour ordered much less food always finish meal saying can't wait till next time    I would definitely recommend Pizza Kabobs Ambrosia  whatever anyone neighborhood    man review made hungry  <EOR> I've since tried chicken noodle soup pizza calzone   The chicken noodle soup you'd expect traditional chicken noodle  lemony much more depth flavor  definitely notes cilantro there  couldn't put down  incredibly interesting yet still comforting way want chicken noodle be   Their pizza good  best pizza ever but crust sauce cheese  pepperoni pie good gyro meat  haven't yet tried Greek pizza because boyfriend doesn't feta olives but really can't wait so   If order calzone less two linebackers smaller size  large enormous  ordered large onions gyro meat  good but felt little much mozzarella cheese enough ricotta  ricotta seemed all piled around edges while inside all mozz  think could mix bit more    For update calzone gets three stars pizza gets four chicken noodle gets five  Averages four stars again  Next trying ribs wings  <EOR> So usually when find place seems style cuisine Ambrosia Cafe sounding Greek which    I think is become leery good food when see things falafel BBQ ribs gyro salad pizza like    With being said most recently dined bunch friends ordered slew items  Started off hummus Greek fries falafel which all point    Followed some popcorn shrimp placed orders few gyro salads order signature pork chops beef blue salad  All which amazing    Ended ordering gyro pizza see if pies carried any weight let tell did    All all would highly recommend place anyone  What's great deliver also some great lunch specials  server took care Hunter he cool too  Really nice didn't screw any orders which always important   <EOR> The Gyro amazing Taziki just way it   Try sampler its must get!
