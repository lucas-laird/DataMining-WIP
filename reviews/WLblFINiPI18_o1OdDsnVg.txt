Portions quite generous service pretty friendly   like sneaky upcharges   ordered pork barbacoa last night when asked if wanted hot sauce enchilada style said yes   mean more sauce better right?  Well apparently spooning extra sauce over burrito hard work equals dollar   Yup getting your burrito enchilada style cost buck   only learned upon reading receipt   Apparently other upcharges requesting sour cream guac etc   guessing any innocuous question posed staff member hides upcharge   Just say no kids   buyer beware     Also keep mind if you're hands on type eater may develop knife fork skills eat here   dealbreaker book but may shock some folks!  3* sneakiness  <EOR> I've eaten probably 10 different Cafe Rios chain across NV UT far worst location   friendly all always run things things wrong I tell them supposed made  If 10 extra minutes drive S  Eastern location  <EOR> Standard Mexican American joint  Lots college kids cops eating clientel kinda gross plus fuck las vegas metro  ugh  Food perfectly fine though would again  <EOR> Food very good!

Wow  Very overpriced  must killing bottom line except many worthless employees stand simply bag order give dirty looks entire time doing definitely won't back   Over priced  Can't order right  basically giant pile rice beans little side meat    Not friendly  clean trash overflowing   tasty  way overpriced dish   Oh! charged 'for here' when she gave bag go! adds tax it  Cheap!! <EOR> Did place  thought maybe would better then chipotle wrong   steak burrito put meat burrito started rolling before chose veggies  stopped them said wait didn't choose veggies yet   said sorrt burritos don't come veggies    told them first time didn't know    put veggies once but mad giving looks because reduce burrito   Uh food customer service?  here   don't eat rice put meat started rolling burrito   Did think wanted meat tortilla  it? ridiculous   coming back  <EOR> This over favorite fast food places   sweet pork amazing   burritos huge salads  never leave hungry   also love selection lemonades teas  <EOR> Pretty good Mexican food but don't expecting San Diego caliber Mexican food but rather more Tex Mex comparable Chipotle   Very fresh ingredients ample portions   Service little slow but only because they're usually pretty busy   put cilantro almost everything including rice if you're fan better speak beforehand  <EOR> One friends swore place decided check out   I ordered few steak burritos steak salads friends  personally ate steak salad pretty darn good  salad put top flour tortilla baked cheese  chose black beans mine  rice lettuce pico de gallo guac tortilla strips cilantro cheese  salads dressing selections creamy tomatillo dressing cilantro lime vinaigrette  opted creamy DELICIOUS  am really picky when comes quality ingredients  example if see wilted browning lettuce salad eat it  lettuce very fresh did issue produce  dressing though made salad!

Vegas town where locals love food tend eat we're practicing food competition  Take no shame fellow Vegas locals  Life's short enjoy food place tasty Cafe Rio  <EOR> This even based food but fact grown man behind counter said staff least 6 different times loud I'd appreciate if all would shut f#$ speaking everyone working behind him  all while myself another person ordered waited food  Disrespectful those he's working don't deserve that  <EOR> What place good homemade tortillas! am picky when comes tortillas but real deal! best salads ever had!

No gloves health hazard cross contamination  Just horrible general  <EOR> Excellent service busy location  eaten several times staff always outgoing  last visit male manager could stayed off line loud annoying  definitely prefer served employees  <EOR> Cafe Rio delicious Mexican style food  Each time come order Chicken Steak Quesadilla  However if you're looking bigger meat portioning would recommend Chicken Quesadilla because when Steak did cover least third tortilla wrap  Most quesadilla filled cheese personally think you'd your monies worth  basic toppings comes quesadilla lettuce pico de gallo sour cream avocado  If want any extras anything additional those toppings charge you  When came time paying cashier bit off he asked order girl did toppings already communicated order repeat it  He didn't even place drink cup nicely tray he just tossed outside cup felt sticky wet because he previously bussing tables cleaning counters before taking payment  disgusting he didn't even wash hands  drink bar filled coke product varieties usually horchata! When comes hot sauces if come during dinner time hot sauces non existent  empty Cholula Green Tabasco Tapatio bottle wasn't refilled thrown away  food good but frustrating each visit portions vary mostly gets smaller each time come in cashier isn't nice they're supposed be  Steak Quesadilla paid $11 31  without drink price  portions aren't big amount pay does equal quantity give  <EOR> This place CRAZY 1pm weekday since right across street UNLV campus  Overall bad terms food service  fact staff quick effective polite A+ them  food reasonable    stuff couple times now barbacoa pork anything pretty good you burrito salad etc    Really sweet side seems crowd favorite  Pricing middle road fast food service somewhat Subway where person starts your order others add stuff through line   $12 big buritto drink  If attend UNLV though need quick filling lunch good place head to  <EOR> Mexican food never cuisine  Working couple Mexican restaurants lead actively seek it  know once Asian working Mexican restaurant instead other way around  Every once while crave though  Today friends work wanted lunch before he airport    I barbacoa salad vinaigrette  option whole wheat tortillas welcomed addition  am sure why salad comes it  Just seems huge open face burrito now  load cilantro lettuce guacamole pico de gallo even give slice lime  listed only comprises half ingredients available  monterey jack cheddar cojita cheese tortilla strips    This perfect meal two broke college student  <EOR> This favorite Cafe Rio's especially since close school  staff always friendly accommodating  Once group friends sat restaurant 3+ hours collaborated project staff nothing but pleasant  food always fresh yet meal didn't enjoy! <EOR> Waited 20mins grill chicken friend finish meal chicken never ready told would take 10mins   10mins told another 5mins   waited nothin   left across street aloha kitchen   Friendlier people cleaner restaurant   Very disappointed looking forward chicken salad   <EOR> I've always liked place quick burrito quesadilla  shredded pork meat tortillas delicious fluffy typical tortillas  Service great but slow usually place online order which quick convenient  <EOR> The staff just doesn't care all  cut hand something sharp door handle  explained staff just could look wouldn't happen anyone else he told oh well things happen   didn't want anything just nobody else cut well  Food typical low level Mexican place nothing special  <EOR> Let just say love cafe rio  Order all time  Today into Maryland never seen more rudeness did today  watched workers ask Sonya help she basically said no ask someone else  While Sonya saying no help fellow employees watched she rolled silverware catering order  1  She no gloves 2  She coughing all over utensils  feel bad Evers catering order she taken care of  Once again Sonya asked help she yet again said no  felt horrible woman asking help  returning location  <EOR> Great location right UNLV  class looking change usual pho place stopped here  stopped place busy just small line cashier  noticed everyone getting everything made order ingredients really fresh  ambiance cool colorful very welcoming  Staff also friendly easy place spend hour hangout    I chicken quesadilla delicious  large filling made fresh tortillas cheeses   Chicken tender shredded generous it  need wait little more time since all meals order but think its worth it   Also lime mint drink homemade strawberry lemonade mixed together awesome! would come back just that! back more chicken quesadillas  <EOR> Minus three stars  because cold air instead delicious cheaper dive down road   staff downright disrespectful all way manager looked 18 years old  service very slow made tortillas over cooked NOO guacamole! Just keep going ahead McDonald's save yourself  <EOR> Cafe Rio siren South Maryland Parkway  lures only rip your head off through your wallet    I've tempted try place months but always end eating Yayo Taco instead  $5 student special just can't beat  Thinking meal would $8 thought would FINALLY try Cafe Rio 5 10 11 when some down time between classes    There's hardly anything pick super tiny menu everything least 20% overpriced  embarrassed just walk decided try pork salad cilantro dressing extra limes  also ordered small drink because really mood tea unsweetened only! The salad good  Actually very good but wasn't worth charging  don't see point flour tortilla bowl inside metal to go bowl thrown away rather eaten    The flavored teas good but lids cups don't stay very well  Unfortunately power doors school hit cup hand exploded all over white skirt white jacket  Yes tea does stain    If place cheaper would another star but didn't won't one  <EOR> The food Cafe Rio some very favorite  love Chipotle but reason why would say Cafe Rio more because green ranch YUM! ranch something else  smother burritos always choose salad dressing gift gods    Another thing entirely sure if Chipotle Daily Specials but if Cafe Rio does better job advertising them  love Cafe Rio's Daily Specials because come free drink! Good deal considering menu pretty pricy the reason withheld star    I am most particularly appreciative location because Cafe Rio right across street UNLV never far whenever crave food which ALWAYS  Haha  Big plus   ALSO! ice!  those love icy cold drinks sure also fond ice  All other food establishments need follow suit  <EOR> If want stale very dry hard rice you'd come right place! looking forward trying something new since usually Chipotle when am craving Americanized Mexican food  think sticking Chipotle awhile   The flour tortilla really greasy guacamole tasteless expensive 1 oz serving shade olive green rice hard wasn't cooked! Also black beans overcooked clumpy kinda dry    Overall think food just looks quiet unappetizing because presentation along tasted today good  Plus back house kinda messy along messy steam tables   if open kitchen I'd recommend keep presentable  <EOR> Where start??first excited try new Chile roast beef burrito ok ahead another meat asked mild sauce ok next ordered enchilada style just passed thru stove even long enough melt cheese waiting pay yes still willing eat young black woman made order poking finger meats trying taste which ones best herself plate lettuce cook brings bucket lettuce water puts order still dripping wet finally sit eat somewhat enjoy meal only bite into hard rice!!!when tell manager she says cafe Rios rice supposed hard    w   t   f mexican always cook rice think know if rice under cooked just asked refund way worth !!!this location fell off ur self favor somewhere else plz <EOR> I love some Cafe Rio! Tortillas always fresh cooked spot   cant wrong that! Love mint limeaid tortilla soup! Im only giving 4 stars because tables areas could cleaned more often   tables outside dirty most days  <EOR> The first time Cafe Rio didn't care much it  think grilled chicken burrito chunky me  giving second shot tried shredded chicken burrito enchilada style course   DELICIOUS! Cali where able delicious wet burritos practically anywhere  close close home gotten  Also say super Mexican standpoint horchata amazing! mama's but still delicious! <EOR> Great food!!! Extremely fresh  Tops chain far taco salad awesome tacos great  Fresh squeezed lime most dishes nice touch <EOR> My roommate would die Cafe Rio steak burrito when he pick where lunch no brainer him  Cafe Rio was!  I never location but super close house huge parking lot  win  venue huge lots colorful tables chairs  Seating wasn't issue Sunday afternoon but sure could say same thing weekday since right across street UNLV   The service food A OK book  tortillas scratch fantastic  grilled chicken burrito  add your fillings build you  Black beans rice meat veggies your choice salsa sauce selection point  tomatillo sauce inside top finished enchilada style hot red sauce before added cheese put through toasting warmer   The service friendly but bit confusing chaotic  wasn't offered any extras ask them back add guacamole house dressing  house dressing? almost ranch steroids  must all your dipping pleasures  <EOR> Service just isn't helpful friendly  Girl cashier needs learn smile  salad wasn't great didn't even toast tortilla looks picture    blehg  <EOR> Been few times  Consistently pretty good  Both chicken steak  Would see them offer red salsa chips n salsa rather only green one  <EOR> This place seems ALWAYS busy around lunch time usually isn't anywhere sit unless happen catch people leaving just grab table isn't dirty because never seen anyone come around wipe tables down between customers   The 4 stars come food alone   homemade tortillas amazeballs and don't even tortillas rice kinda girl    salad basically unwrapped burrito good huge   barely finish 1 2 salad   usually grilled chicken salad everything it   I'd recommend getting tortilla side though because it'll soggy bottom your salad   green house ranch dressing thing delicious well   I also drink tea selection encourage mix drinks into different combinations   Service location just okay nothing outstanding   Also if sensitive stomach GI tract would cautious   Some people end getting Cafe Rio stomach which fairly comparable Chipotle stomach if know mean   If don't then don't worry it! <EOR>
