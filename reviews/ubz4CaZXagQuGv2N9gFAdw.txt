Overpriced far management well them should act accordingly less arrogant  much pride mediocre food service  Thank you  <EOR> From moment seated everything perfect  Waiter attentive but annoying drinks food right pace everything only well presented but cooked perfectly  ordered two appetizers between two turns having 2 sides dishes much  could shared just appetizer would better off  Oh well leftovers always fun we live locally luxury being able take them home   think may wife's favorite 'special occasion' dinner spots  pricey but well worth it  excellent wine selection if love wine love place  <EOR> Wow! shocked!  wish would known portions match price! used being served such large portions food! pricier restaurant don't need order much!  food great ate much know why all fat people statues artwork around  sure botero mean large fat lol  Going into knew would heavily carnivorous meal needed some shellfish lighten bit  oysters great but knock prawns Bloody Mary marinade cilantro! Yummy!  salad arugula burrata salad   Some may question spending much salad consists mostly tomato but today's world tomatoes taste nothing once did supposed taste  tomato other hand pure perfection  reminded eating grandparents tomatoes would bring back Florida early 90's   red juicy non acidic almost sweet!  If could recommend anything would domestic lamb  cooked perfectly medium rare exactly ordered far most succulent lamb eaten while  side beans memorable well  duck would better if cooked further rare ordered medium but sauce also tangier overpowering prefer but still devoured it  Mac n cheese unbelievably great HUGE side feed many kings queens   left more plate anything else! <EOR> As Californian am regular LV   tried many other fancy steakhouses LV must say does right every way   I caesar salad foie gras carmalized apples dry aged ny steak foie gras  well sweet potatoes brussell sprouts nice bordeaux st  emillion wash all down    Everything excellent!    We Kobe tasted no other however $175 could awesome steak going dry aged ny steak $55   The chimichurri rub great peppery spicy  Don't forget add foie gras!

The Caesar salad pretty good! Hamachi tartare meh!   I Ordered rosemary veal chop medium came overcooked bit tasteless   Friend ordered most beautiful rack lamb ever seen BUT super salty inedible   Wife ordered salmon nothing write home about   others ordered filet did complain!  The dessert which looked promising small donuts banana nutella lousy   how screw up?  Yes setting absolutely beautiful round table superb great view pool bar area service ok great   but price part equation well   I Would recommend eat again Especially considering same installations similar price and or better installations view SW which infinitely better  Botero essentially steakhouse if look Menu   Mastros Ocean club STK probably Prime bellagio among others better options well! <EOR> Went boyfriends big 3 0 family friends  must say food amazing!  Ambience hip cool trendy  lots paintings fat people wall  Good big parties  Food delicious  Rib eye 20 oz my eyes big stomach shared bunch sides table  Chimchurri sauce best!!   Sides the ones stick out truffle mac cheese righteous! Corn very tasty Service super unimpressive fine dining  waiter took forever take order seemed etc  think asked water 3 times before ask another busboy water immediately    I called restaurant ahead time tell them bring birthday dessert  waiter forgot    surprise ruined    If service better would given place 5  <EOR> Love decor   Love friendly hostesses   Loved waiter Anthony   Most importantly loved food   Stared special appetizer short rib raviolis   even taste better sounds?  HELL YEAH   Three generous sized ravioli stuffed rich short rib meat   Does any better?  Well depends   Hubby wild mushroom tart gruyere cheese    amazingly delicious well   For entrees decided three meals meat salmon done two ways   Basically two pieces salmon grilled absolute perfection served over squash puree carmelized onions other served over mix quince potato wedges    Hubby bone in rib eye steak three sauces   jalapeno hollandaise red pepper sauce pepper herbs sauce    Everything fantastic but say stars side dishes ordered   Creamed spinach fried egg top mean literally fried into ball crispy coating   polenta mushrooms truffle oil   OMG   Just order these   Please!

Firstly say waiter sommelier did excellent job mediating situation  They're only reason giving restaurant two stars instead one      I'll right point starters 4 6 ordered steak returned 2 steaks because overcooked them dry  steaks brought afterwards undercooked  thick cut filet ordered medium rare fridge cold center rib eye ordered medium just seared  asked waiter but instead greeted arrogant manager named Josh  He really rude insisted steaks cooked properly but when asked he offered no explanation regards proper cooking steak! All he repeated borderline insulting tone steaks cooked correctly  Needless say attitude really upsetting two party still didn't entrees    One party upset he lost appetite didn't want steak back  manager's answer don't worry won't pay really rude arrogant tone   point all wanted pay check leave  sommelier offered complimentary deserts would stay but nobody accepted them    We nice family dinner preferred restaurants Vegas but ruined character along high opinion restaurant  only thing salvageable otherwise horrible experience poise attitude waiter sommelier appreciate invitation come back amends    I sent link review hotel manager he might know through  Needles say dining Botero again anytime soon  <EOR> What classic restaurant  The design concept really different you'll appreciate if you'll Artist    The food amazing The steak fish asked server something didn't menu even Kitchen buy different restaurant    WOWWWW  does it? Only people knows customer service is   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! <EOR> The ambiance amazing   party six everyone something different  All all half group loved meal   Mediterranean sea bass   generous portion   enjoyed until strongly flavored olives lent pickled flavor vegetable layer under fish   Which also gets question why did waiter keep asking if ordering vegetable side   appease ordered Brussel sprouts   barely touched   Probably because large portions nothing special them   BTW also nothing special calamari appetizer either   probably would given Botero 3 stars if wasn't delicious Kobe beef short ribs steak  <EOR> Among best steak options available   dining partners ordered fish dish   good but he kind deserved since he failed order steak restaurant known steak   bill table couple grand don't expect cheap   magnums wine didn't help keep things affordable but certainly made experience complete fine dining event   waitress decants wine tableside   If you're shopping vacation dining event where don't mind spending $100+ person reservation   place doesn't disappoint unless order blindly  <EOR> Amazing food friendly service though bit slow   I tasting menu EVERYTHING amazing  small eaters tasting menu would enough share  stuffed 3rd course  also complimentary bread start but would suggest skipping save tummy room! 2 kinds tuna tartare crab ravioli seared foie gras blueberry waffle branzino steak sides palate cleanser lemon sorbet then wonderful chocolate dessert probably favorite all dishes  But again all them great  thing food allergies which noted reservation  felt weren't happy accommodate food allergies but then again weren't rude either  However could feel when chef came discuss allergies he def wasn't happy  told food allergies aren't severe long food made allergens fine  did try work around but 100% tuna tartare definitely chili peppers which allergic accidentally served broccoli even though swapped asparagus  Still think great experience would highly recommend place people without food allergies maybe much those with  <EOR> I cannot recommend restuarant   food fabulous but service incredibly slow  we served hour 15 minutes sat down   When asked waiter scarce wait he responded condescending manner due thickness  steaks  am middle age guy eaten share fine cuisine don't appreciate being lectured steak 22 year old waiter   Worse long wait waiters absence long delay   He made no attempt rectify situation apologize any way  dissapointing coming hotel suppose pinnacle hospitality las vegas   Steve Wynn would happy botero's performance evening  <EOR> Beautiful setting beautiful food great service but steak only alright   all beauty why wasn't phenomenal   Sniff sniff why oh why did me?
