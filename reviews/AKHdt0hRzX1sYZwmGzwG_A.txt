I would recommend place anyone    Even if you're hurry need quick bite    elsewhere! <EOR> I looking mid afternoon pick thought I'd try white mocha coffee breakfast burrito  coffee ok substandard Starbucks mocha  pretty weak almost watered down compared Starbucks  knew burrito gamble but hungry  under seasoned took quite awhile given considering pre made nuked  unappetizing did finish it  Oh also cost $7 burrito way over priced quality  <EOR> I Vegas work Convention Center would early riser catch cab convention center sometimes Home Depot  didn't time full breakfast pick breakfast lunch potential dinner crew  Fuel range healthy satisfying options prices won't break bank   Try double sausage cheese sandwich  Yep hearty sounds  would perfect if hungover because bit greasy side  But did job me!  Given doing work when Convention Center fully open meaning food stalls closed grateful convenient spot opened early some fresh options crew  <EOR> I suspect place new still working bugs because much room improvement    There 4 people line when arrived took 15 minutes cup unremarkable drip coffee already made  would want when busy because simply take 15 minutes serve cup coffee  <EOR> I wasn't expecting much cafe since Hard Rock   pretty dead when came in   girl register wasn't bad   She took order straight making drinks   She herself   drinks pretty quickly   Took 5 10 minutes   ice black tea good sweet requested happy that   thing didn't visit she didn't wash hands she used register sneezed then drinks   gross   We coffee tea then friend texted coffee too   back order another drink time 3 other people front us   took while place order because only person working   Then see another girl walk some where else carrying bunch items sat those down counter behind bar   She straight into making drinks bar   Once again barista didn't wash hands before touching food beverage items   last visit took 15 20 minutes latte   Staffs need wash hands touching themselves doing anything else before serving customers!!!  place where germs spread crazy!! <EOR> I need coffee something snack before heading Rehab Pool Party  way pool stopped chef salad iced coffee friends ordered couple breakfast burritos latte    I'm surprised all 1 star reviews because when service great coffee tasted fine woke chef salad filling surprisingly good  Yes salad tad over priced but if you're coming Vegas looking deal might want pack your own food then  could gone somewhere else snack but because convenient location where headed Fuel Cafe hit spot  <EOR> Close Casino Tower   A variety coffees beverages choose from  Decent breakfast options  Long lines wait usually   Mediocre price range  <EOR> This places coffee terrible! Stayed hard rock place 2 separate days just give another shot avid coffee drinker mornings    I only 2 stars food selection decent comparable Starbucks  But coffee gross near undrinkable if GOOD coffee person if drink any old pot burnt coffee put front place you! <EOR> 4 stars chai    0 stars customer service    Chai surprisingly good  Huh  Thanks barista man made !

He tells barista folks no wipe mind its middle floor = safety hazard  guy wheelchair starts wiping floor d think would stop clean ? Nope  <EOR> It nice clean pretty good selection unfortunately think food pricey if those egg white burrito $9 no meat just egg white few slice chilies plus comes salsa  You better drive MC Donald's down street <EOR> Had coupon free coffee but needed buy sandwich dessert! looking menu girl tells only sausage mc muffin bacon egg! okay great choices!
