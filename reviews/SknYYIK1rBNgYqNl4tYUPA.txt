Then when remade enchiladas done just sat counter until happened look cook pointed counter cash register order taker no inclination let know food ready  Later when asked if desserts she just looked until repeated question motioned head towards freezer ice cream bars  Guess words required much effort   So advise going somewhere else unless whole rest city food  <EOR> This place great people work hard its small operation but food good prices great   always seem just busy enough wait little bit which very healthy sign   Breakfast burritos packed eggs beacon cheese photos   also love beef tacos cant price taste  <EOR> OMG if could give place half star would! place stayed open long puzzled! lot Mexican food life if last restaurant serving Mexican food I'd never back! food disgusting  Yelpers u lead astray again <EOR> This basically same Roberto's several other Mexican food places around   food would expect pretty good expensive comes quick   Since food rushed fast often meals where cheese isn't remotely melted   Generally just rely heat food melt cheese   Staff friendly place usually pretty clean   give place 3 stars because isn't anything special but still good  <EOR> Literally girlfriend eat least once week  Maybe twice!!!
