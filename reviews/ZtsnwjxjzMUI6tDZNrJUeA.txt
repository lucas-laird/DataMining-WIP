As much enjoy food service become less desirable  think time seek other dining options  <EOR> We usually come food bar  Tonight came actually sit bar service horrible  Bartender serves frequent customers first priority time she back little irritated then  Understand she pregnant but if cannot keep clientele then need less busy shift  other bartenders waitresses pregnant no issues helped all equal  Wife enjoys chicken fingers definitely coming back but sit bar dining area! <EOR> This place hidden gem    Stopped late Sunday afternoon  Food delicious  each ordered sandwich turkey roast beef   all kept trying each others' food because liked much  Steak fries great    $3 00 well drink specials during football games  Bonus!!  Customer service great!   We definitely back!! <EOR> Two half stars couple things bothered me   The steak sorta decent price but no Delmonicos na'mean? mean think would decent price  Read on   I 20 oz Montana Ribeye cowboy cut steak place  waitress gushing big told re focus steak stop staring lap  No but seriously she gushing big almost took home  Ok but seriously she wanted it   No but seriously    steak supposed huge? Maybe started 20oz but definitely shrank  Fine whatever still decent size but wasn't big T bone father got   I ordered steak medium came well done  well done steak  think if steak came cooked correctly might good  Since cooking steak well done basically renders flavorless legitimately surprised when moments actually tasted delicious rib eye charcoal    There some decent beers tap service good ambiance better expected  place block away house figure back  write follow review it  far though impressed  wasn't expecting five star steakhouse but if you're selling steaks should least chef time correctly   Oh raspberry chocolate cheesecake incredible   why 2 2 5 star rating 1 2 star <EOR> Montana Meat Co  greaaat bar food!  I came some late night eats friends place did disappoint  actually pretty big menu really pride themselves cuts meats  guess place could fall under steakhouse category because large selection cuts but stuck breakfast late night menu   The breakfast menu big cheap! many skillet combination plates pretty much find whatever want  prices pretty good $6 $8 everything late night menu  pretty good specials drinks when $3 all draft beer $4 well drinks can't really hate that  <EOR> Good burgers fast service all cops eat which means good cheap <EOR> I dig place when want some home cooking but hit miss hesitating writing review until visited six times  close house come reason alone  think other meals better steaks   It connected bar sometimes smoke waft over dining area   Customer service pretty good since each time only waiter waitress 2 bus persons bartender whole place  Emily sweetie she's gem place   The food 3 good meals 3 mediocre meals  Pleasant surprises included super great bar food wings appetizers  Salads really fresh! Soups yummy change frequently  Kids meals great!!! gotta honest steaks good could be  Cuts thin fatty ribeyes usually overcooked  noticed kids serloin better flavor ribeye special  Temperature off food too   Suggestions manager 1 hire more staff help weekends 2 please chef stop drenching veggies butter half amount should 3 please note chef kids don't usually tons pepper   don't put kids meals including steak burgers etc  table all  4 please throw away dried flowers collecting layers dust grody look flower arrangement made 90s looks hasn't dusted since 90s while eating  5 chef please use ice cream scooper serve mashed potatoes cafeteria tacky!  I hope few changes change three stars five  <EOR> I used come all time awesome  Then changed bartenders    Here's happened   Came few friends around 3AM Friday night  all little tipsy but wanted stay close home made choice bar  bartender took 15 minutes come over friend actually shout excuse attention  Normally would excuse bartender noticing someone sit bar but he literally buzz since midnight     When ordered drinks he then over group he chatting prior interrupting him  15 minutes later he brings over beers  No reason should taken long  But gaming other two friends didn't really notice   It then took several attempts getting another round  when finally succeeded decided would somewhere else  gamed total 280$ between 3 each 2 drinks  asked bill when received noticed single drink comped  complaining when don't received something comped but ridiculous  paid bill still left 10$ tip  friend also asked bartender pack cigarettes but noticed wasn't bill figured he just didn't charge her  When leaving walked door comes shouting bartender  Excuse me!!! guys didn't pay those cigarettes  friends laughed threw 20$ left   The only reason giving 2 stars instead because hope return bar see another bartender  But until then    review  <EOR> Love place! Cheap breakfast  actually good  sausage patty best sausage ever had  Bloody Mary's great too   4 stars cause service kinda slow only breakfast  <EOR> We decided try new place instead going Applebee's   called ahead order takeout told would ready 10 minutes   promptly greeted when arrived 10 minutes later food ready   fish tacos came beans cilantro lime rice enjoyed every bite   portion size just right me   guy kobe beef sliders onion rings he said good   We'll definitely back try lunch specials <EOR> Really disappointed last visit Montana's meat company they're usually pretty good food service don't know wrong time but order good into point made where going discovered chocolate chip cookies Burned called place order next day file complaint cookies told nothing totally offended considering frequent patriot sure check your food before hand <EOR> For place great  Breakfast excellent  Kobe burgers awesome  Open 24 7  <EOR> I'm place once week maybe twice bar side  bartenders great food good bar food music changes depending bartender <EOR> Great late night menu happy hour also great!
