As they're still pretty new cut them some slack but need work some kinks  I'd give them few weeks some tweaks then try them again   potential nice little off strip lounge eatery  <EOR> Went whim tried place family during lunch   busy but glad didn't deter us  Everything yummy! variety pastas each unique rich flavors portions generous  Eggplant Rollatini which recommended very nice waitress glad took advice  also chance try Baked Chicken Breast Dore would highly recommend it   Hope place gets more business evening  I'd see succeed  We'll definitely back  <EOR> Rude employees!

Coming over customers paying $300 service saying providing said service much hassle?! None going again  <EOR> I really excited visit Blind Pig  right outside Panorama condos see often way work  Today finally decided stop see all about  must say am very underwhelmed experience  First off food  reading previous reviews decided lobster  roll  Sadly when looked menu today no lobster roll  settled lobster ravioli which rich creamy sauce but rather dry filling  good enough finish  meal ordered Cafe Mocha dessert  Please don't waste your money  First off no steamed milk mocha which first sign something off  Actually take back  first sign something off very obvious chunks hot chocolate powder used lieu real hot chocolate chocolate syrup  far worst mocha ever had  disappointed  Based previous reviews appears things gone down Blind Pig  Now regards service  walk 2 30 pm acknowledged sat down until 2 50 pm  waitress never introduced herself scarce possible  actually seek order check  incredibly slow no reason lack service  never good  last thing stood lack professionalism  could actually see bartenders bright pink bra instead tending customers moving food quickly waitresses hanging bar talking  Overall bad enough featured Kitchen Nightmares but would recommend restaurant  <EOR> We addicted BP Burger! best burger's we live bi costal sweet potato fries phenomenal well    However feel extra $3 sweet potato fries overpriced well menu but food delicious worth cost  <EOR> Much everyone else said great ambiance but  petty much where ends   Sat bar ordered crispy pork nuggets inside spicy tuna pizza   Pork nuggets terrible crispy extremely dry   spicy tuna good basically deconstructed spicy tuna roll should soy marinade sauce though   Pizza ok nothing special least toppings seemed high quality   door tip two people 120 little bit pricey opinion  <EOR> WOW such amazing place!!!

Very cute ambience well  Cheers two thumbs up! <EOR> Horrible experience! waiting 15 min waitstaff approach still high hopes quaint eatery  Although experience worst Las Vegas period! many food choices horrible Customer service poor wait staff  family spent 1 hour waiting food hamburger salad 2 pizza's + never received drink refills  Waitstaff definitely working team sure what's going kitchen  manager? Won't return!! <EOR> I love ambiance vibe place  seems type place you'd find downtown Dean Martin sorta strange location  worth seeking though  James O  felt little rushed bartender but thought service just fine  sure check in Yelp free speciality cocktail or smoothie   little frustrating many things  Straight away bartender informed least 6 beers 3 cocktails he couldn't do  when ordered cocktail he let know he couldn't so over half cocktails out   settled Blind Pig cocktail which fancier cosmo good choice  menu several tasty items  But reason came poutine fries  little afraid being told couldn't because something  But thankfully able order it  sizable portion definitely more enough share  $6 50 seemed bargain  While tasty wasn't best had  But would certainly return order again  All all menu ambiance coming back  <EOR> Ordered through Postmates anything would better then received   salmon side alfredo    first off wasn't sure why didn't come vegetables just super fishy tasting piece afredo made spaghetti noodles   food just weird  I would returned restaurant  <EOR> We heard place awhile now finally made happen Valentines Day no less  few reservations around but wifey woke morning craving Carbonara Blind Pig nod   and did disappoint!! happened arrive during happy hour indulged few 1 2 price apps which delicious! house salad shared entree chicken Carbonara which devoured  Looking forward returning during game some sort  5 STARS! <EOR> We come when stay towers  really great place when want catch some  games big screen  food staff awesome  miscommunication server time Tom above way experience fantastic always  very grateful way situation handled  Very classy  family back sure  menu large there's lots choose from    Ps deliver too    convenient breakfast kids!

Aesthetically similar dope speakeasies NYC DTLA dimmed lighting leather booths taxidermies   Came quick drink say quite impressed   Bitter Sling which tasted toned down Manhattan sure opt ice cubes fuller flavor   Decided give poutine crunchy pork chunks try   Surprisingly both delicious   come back shrimp lobster Mac n' cheese later time though   Overall Blind Pig great addition quick lunch special occasions   bad place pricey can't much I'd to   Also market needs little more work   Nonetheless good start Las Vegas!! <EOR> My order pick but service still great very polite over phone when picking up! 24 7 burger great bacon nice crisp!

Cause felt certain corn would over powering clash lobster but any good scientist ran both experiments  right corn totally over took very good lobster taco   The BP salad also good but drowning red vinaigrette dressing time bottom force myself eat chopped bits cheese salami inevitably fallen off fork   All washed down single glass 'a brother another mother' whiskey which treated lime juice over large block ice garnished lime twist  Absolutely delicious cocktail  Best part meal  retrospect should two cocktails three lobster tacos flour tortillas  <EOR> i ordered take last night  ehhh  ordered salmon wine sauce  came potatoes asparagus  ordered small caesar salad     food blah  salmon no seasoning didn't any togo utensils  salad good  dressing tasty  but could've kept 50 something dollars <EOR> We stopped Sunday evening dinner  ambience nice  some very comfortable booths  service experienced average  good but exceptional   We ordered steak sandwich lobster roll  Both very delicious but definitely pay deliciousness   If decide give Blind Pig try probably won't regret it  <EOR> Next Panorama Towers place super way strip point where realized wouldn't even able catch taxi back oh my   We decided family style bunch dishes  Lobster mac cheese pork belly nuggets seared ahi tuna seared salmon bootlegger steak poutine  Everything crazy good  Dishes cooked perfectly seasoned well executed well  meats tasted fresh tender nicely done  large drink menu boasted more knew with!
