She certainly bought them certainly ate them  I say fresh version WC burger definitely better frozen  ordered two jalapeño cheese sliders fill intoxicated gut  certainly did trick!  Service good burgers pretty much expected but better because already tried frozen product  did see lot negative reviews taste burger  honestly think somewhat acquired taste  going everyone's thing   This no means gourmet burger  meant if expecting save yourself trouble elsewhere  Flippin' Burgers would better choice  burger easily compared regular McDonald's hamburger slider form but WC bun superior opinion but meat MD's better   Yes price high but you'd expect heart touristy DT Vegas  Isn't everything else exception occasional breakfast steak prime rib specials which purchased within specified timeframe???
