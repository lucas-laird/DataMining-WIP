It bit pricey only e but if place recommend going lamb chops should totally go!!  They poured Bacardi 151 over lamb chops then lit fire then drizzled amazing mint sauce over it  chops medium rare succulent juicy absolutely die for  Recommend!

Well guess what? ate again own dime good  I talked server both visits admitted consistency problem serving staff especially during busy hours but really working bringing caliber  say he solicitous each time very friendly intuitive when ask if needed anything well when leave alone  bar staff hostess bus boys do still call them that? all very friendly helpful too  Yes some prices steeper would spend your neighborhood Applebee's but remember all Vegas Strip pricey  take all those reviews grain salt some peoples reasonable another persons damn high! Yes 17 00 wings seems steep however never going them prepared best meat lolly pop succelent bite yummy  Well worth splurge hubby split order plenty appetizer  He Philly Cheese Steak dumplings raved them didn't bite those bummer! I agree Doritos mac cheese did even look appealing could take peoples word avoid which leads next piece advice Really carefully look menu read descriptions dishes well prices  care find something fun inventive but also sure bet please your palate pocketbook  As deals steak eggs shoestring fries 9 99  Awesome deal!

Food FIRST serves mainly comfort food think mac n' cheese pizza steak slightly refined  complimentary pretzels salty taste but everything else fairly point  The most memorable dish mojito lamb chops appetizer  dish finished off table chops doused mint sauce Barcadi 151 then lit match  wasn't fireworks but definitely made dining experience more interesting   Grilled swordfish came wasabi flavored sauce bit pungent nose but texture fish perfect   The Papardelle forest mushrooms    literally forest mushrooms! fantastic pasta mushroom ratio because mushroom fiend  truffle butter nice touch but gave dish much oil liking    Price Very reasonable considering FIRST Strip Palazzo   2 glasses wine + 1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 dessert came $95   $15 3 pieces lamb chops appetizer bit steep but delicious justify price    almost     Ambiance Modern clean lines pop color there  high ceiling ginormous windows overlooking Strip space appear industrial but still welcoming feeling  Definitely casual but fun place gathering friends low key dinner special someone   Besides mojito lamb chops dinner wasn't extraordinary  But Greg server made much more memorable enjoyable!

However Chopped Salad just plain strange  may assume you're getting typical chopped salad interesting twist falafal croutons when order salad but instead salad heavily loaded capers pepperoncini slivers  know hard pick capers pepperoncini slivers chopped salad? Answer impossible   Now all gettin' all California fusion salad ingredients but neither items mentioned menu only aforementioned falafal croutons   When server asked liked said Gee lot capers he said Yah don't capers  Then wonder why f didn't guy mention something when ordered damn salad? Perhaps he could said great salad if capers  surprisingly spicy salad because all those  slivered pepperoncinis SOMETHING!  Oh other bit bad news   five people dinner four entrees came 10 minutes before fifth which pizza which burnt pretty crispy   If they'd pulled oven served other entrees wouldn't burnt   Given 2 stars might generous  If you're Pallazo Venetian eat Sushi Samba   fantastic  <EOR> This really nicest place eat at  Very nice modern upscale atmosphere  That view strip stunning your table bar area  music perfect atmosphere The food delicious kind!!!  treated very nice served fast  food portions big Wife loved it! defenitley back!!!! <EOR> My friends around midnight because all other fancy schmancy restaurants closed place did disappoint!

Service sub par   waitress did bare minimum attentive needs   ask refills she didn't put much effort into table     The others group also mentioned food just OK would probably skip next time they're Vegas  <EOR> We came coworker's birthday lunch  think strip could use more places moderately priced fun atmosphere open lunch etc  seems many things uber high end and only open dinner uber low end food courts fast food cafes     The space great views strip killer! loved booth right window overlooking pirate disaster TI  Service just OK he forgot bring soup slow general but unfortunately found mediocre service becoming norm strip    I disappointed tiny lunch menu was  Maybe 10 choices so?
