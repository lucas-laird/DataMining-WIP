The Italian wedding soup also very tasty   Juicy meatballs spinach pasta beef broth   believe soup day Thursday   The food much better since last time when tried salad bar   Something keep mind when dining group end your meal server give list bought   No prices   pay front cashier gives total there   everyone should keep mind cost ordered ease splitting check calculating tip   pain  <EOR> Lucas great if work downtown you're having rough day requires working through your lunch break  Call place your order your food arrive within hour    It's only place downtown consistent delivery times quality food outside ordering pizza   GREATEST lunch spot downtown area especially emergence new fabulous lunch spots like Le Thai Eat    but definitely go to delivery spot    I almost always order salad greek caesar never any problems  Salads come dressing side bread roll  Really tasty opinion  only qualm tend over charge especially if want substitute anything add meat your salad    I've ordered Reuben BLT past bad! They've decent french fries co workers really loves empanadas    The menu huge shouldn't trouble finding something catches your eye  Although advise against ordering any soups because lack flavor   Also there's AYCE salad bar if chose sit eat rather delivered  never actually Luca's but hear around water cooler! <EOR> Luca's really odd space  restaurant housed old church  fact church according server very first church Vegas ever  believe based size shape design interior   Luca's serves breakfast Italian which another oddity place because those two things combination seems strange choice but it  only serve breakfast until 10 30 if you've lunch options   They offer really cheap salad pizza buffet but would say choice quality buffet match price tag  all you're going pay for  looking over decided Italian sandwich really enjoyed  basically mozzarella Italian meat tapenade spread delicious bread   The prices pretty low service nice would possibly trying again if lived area  However wasn't remarkable I'd conscious effort again just return visit Vegas  <EOR> El Gaucho  More el sucko  Being court house bunch while break jury duty  server took entire 1 5 hour break bring 1 burrito omelet   Terrible   would never again  <EOR> Terrible Rueben sandwich!!! worst $9 67 ever spent anything!!!  Called order online menu waited 15 minutes walked over less then 2 minute walk food cold despite being ready when arrived pick prices location different online menu $2 00   meat more fat actual meat bread soggy pick fries cold limp can't believe place business two bites rest into garbage would back free meal if homeless no other options  probably would better meal if dumped sauerkraut shoes some 1000 island dressing heated them Bic lighter!  don't even deserve star given! <EOR> I soft spot Luca's   may best food but always satisfying affordable     My favorite option usually lunch special two slices pizza salad two empanadas salad   Both those $5 95 you're dining under $10 downtown   empanadas crispy savory favorite being chicken corn   also beef empanadas which usually little potato green olive filling   All empanadas served super garlicky chimichurri sauce beware if you're returning work lunch   The pizza nothing write home but nostalgic part loves school cafeteria food really enjoys cheese pizza   Overall Luca's pretty quick always satisfying inexpensive lunch spot downtown I'd definitely recommend it! <EOR> Really neat old church converted restaurant  few blocks Fremont   Very clean food service excellent prices great  Everything fresh hot  husband ordered Chirizo Breakfast Wrap said best thing he's Vegas far  dad ordered Egg Salad Croissant he said the bread soft egg salad good flavor    couldn't decided between Argentine Lomito Milanesa sandwich   waitress said Argentine Lomita more popular but fav Milanesa  ended Milanesa disappointed   also ordered 1 beef empanada filling reminiscent Cuban Picadillo which love  <EOR> Great pastrami!
