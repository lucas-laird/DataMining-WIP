Great gym meal    Nope most authentic Chinese meal but good!  Fresh veggies meats key!  mushrooms weren't mushy broccoli still crunch meats hot even Orange Chicken still texture   Definitely best Panda Express meals had   still include fortune cookie every meal   nice touch but course very typical Chinese   Yes am part Chinese     This Panda Express bit hidden strip mall off Hualapai Charleston but worth find   much better overall Panda Express street Red Rock Hotel Casino food court   Hidden gem some Chinese American take out  <EOR> Panda Express great place eat nice alternative typical fast food  entree's consistently rated best healthy alternative eat publications such Men's Health magazine  use only fresh vegetables cut daily high quality meats  None meals served MSG    This very nice location  restaurant kept very clean  ladies behind counter friendly  move customers quickly efficiently through line    I only couple Panda Expresses town no means expert but based seen think portions very large  recommend asking the plate even if eating in  portion does appear little larger eating plate   I Black Pepper Chicken Mango Chicken Fried Rice  <EOR> I medical condition which basically means cannot eat meat  only Panda Express location found Las Vegas even offers Eggplant Tofu stop often few places go  wish more locations never found location Orange County San Diego County but  why upset  never issue until now   I visited location 17th only just few minutes 8 30  looked before saw closed 10pm knew time dine in  another dish place where usually Eggplant Tofu but no problem sometimes  okay never mind waiting  let lady know would dish she refused telling won't could only what's steam table  When explained don't mind waiting she told no longer did away it  asked when she told few weeks ago Which could town spring break   pointed still magnet steam table menu board  haven't removed them yet   While  possible upset because no other dishes don't meat  would left if other members party hadn't already ordered   So ordered half brown rice half steam veggies attempt work  wanted also two items steam veggies well since aren't any other choices but again she refused any more  attempted explain reasons asking just items veggies but she told kitchen closing wouldn't any more food  hour half before closing  if came closing but come on  did she seriously think table would last until closing? course while dining still serving food kitchen  point asked person charge because careless attitude didn't want even take far but she told no charge no speak to  Basically pick two more dishes didn't even want just eat few veggies The rest party enjoyed meat gave since most dishes anyway offered little veggies theirs but shouldn't way    This far worst experience ever Panda Express if true did away only dish could actually eat guess no point coming back anyway  While understand others limitations therefore wouldn't issues did service still horrible  I'd find another location where actually friendly  normally during day shift guess never issue staff being rude  if location guess earlier day best time go  just opinions mine alone  Take will   Update did reach offered pay meal which believe fair  also since gone back location found fact still offer Egg Plant Tofu which awesome  still haven't found another store offers contacting them couldn't advise any stores offer but store still offers cannot complain  Upon returning didn't see employee treating poorly but hope she just whatever going life worked out  still enjoy Panda Express just wish more stores offered least meatless dish  <EOR> Come lot  Usually better service  Didn't any teriyaki chicken wait them cook it   Same time line building up  Manager employee break couldn't bothered help break  Cash Machine jams other employee gets phone call making no helping anyone     Not having dish available only small part service problems listed above <EOR> We always come bc food fresh staff pretty friendly always clean   close soccer sports park great brunch finish off afternoon    <EOR> Paid $10 honey walnut shrimp entree   Opened box filled half way  notified option would cost $5 more entree would also receive half amount  <EOR> I eaten several Panda Express locations both Nevada California  Panda Express very limited selection food luke warm best  never tofu eggplant restaurant cluttered disorganized  service mediocre  High prices too  <EOR> When want something quick easy   Panda Express always favorite mine!! Food pretty much always tasty especially teriyaki chicken string bean chicken service always good <EOR> I am big fan Panda Express  food sweet greasy quality food let alone Chinese food overpriced  Since family likes though several around town  particular store always looks clean inviting staff friendly  <EOR> Appears changing over staff  Much friendlier before  recently replaced Mandarin Chicken better tasting Teriyaki Chicken  <EOR> Just disappointment   tried location three times just gets worse each time   Food prepared lines backed trying close clean early   See photos stack containers waiting food   See photo horrible looking food   yourself favor patronize Downtown Summerlin location better experience  <EOR>
