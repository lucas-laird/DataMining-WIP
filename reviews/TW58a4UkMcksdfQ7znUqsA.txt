Korean places such serve small portions salads kimchis but you're really excellent  marinated meats seafood Doh underwhelming! Oh added gratuity 18% party 4 don't surprised ! <EOR> Second time Doh won't last    Not only conveniently located near neck of the woods SW next two popular dessert spots Gelatology Serenade! don't travel all way Spring Mountain AYCE Korean BBQ yay     Customer service great  attentive needs really quick setting whatever else needed without having give waiting look  impressed efficient especially busy holiday    There two options Dinner Dinner II  difference?

I highly recommend Doh if you're looking AYCE KBBQ  multiple times never seems wait which surprised because good!   <EOR> I really excited ayce kbbq opening close house since dont driving chinatown all time kbbq  girlfriend came first time last night less satisfactory experience  took them while take order even bring anything  beef brisket dry other meats just ok  didn't brisket sauce couldnt give extra salad dressing because its already mixed in  guess  anyway probably continue trip chinatown Kbbq unless place steps bit  <EOR> We eat least ever other week!! quaint restaurant nice vibe music video wall  friendly staff  Foods great coarse!! <EOR> My boyfriend tried place last night 1 29 16 definitely its ups downs  Upon walking sat 5 minutes  only server working time Ryan  Ryan great very attentive explained menu everything worked since new particular kbbq spot  ordered brisket beef tongue beef bulgogi red wine pork belly steamed egg  only first round  Every thing ordered came timely tasted great good fat meat ratio  wish could said same second half order brisket orders 60% fat  trim down scissors  also noticed half way through meal server left home guess because another woman attended didn't catch name  Most places when server leaves say something introduce server taking over table but oh well  other server very nice but she alone lot fresh table take care own    Overall best but also worst experience kbbq place  <EOR> The food service amazing   Banchan selection great   Each distinct flavor very enjoyable    tongue pork Bulgogi amazing   Bulgogi perfect   definitely going back  <EOR> Service = 4 5 stars  Food = 4 5 stars Cleanliness = 3 5 stars  Price = 4 stars  Reasonable price wash area organized should observed no assign crew monitoring part  came around 9 10 pm  If want avoid long waiting should here  Overall recommend place friends family  <EOR> Recently dinner customer service lacking all areas  three girls working floor seemed more concerned talking each other leaning against corner work area rather attend guests  sure much waiting time allocated during but seemed more time took eat food  When looked around restaurant would see other guests looking attention well  When finished food waitress took order cleared off some plates  waited check assuming she'd bring since she asked if done replied yes  Nearly 10 min passed still nothing  made couple eye contact hem while corner talking but no came  walked said Excuse check  She brings check shortly return right away card  different waitress comes pick hand bill ask dessert since never offered it  She looks down table sees some meat  left says she would charge leftovers if wanted dessert  said ok  fine although eaten dozen times left little meat never charged still dessert   She register swipe card other lady originally gave bill before she swipes tells she going charge extra meat but soon realize over charged begin because bill stated ate rib eye but didn't it costs little more   She brought bill back didn't end charging extra meat since already over charged rib eye dinner price  probably worst customer service restaurant  normally gentlemen waiter they're usually pretty attentive  If those three girls spent half time did talking actually attending tables would happier guests happier guests mean better tips! all tipping 15% if service fairly reasonable but night unfortunately didn't deserve anymore 10% restaurant cameras right above work area hope ever watches recordings notices work ethic lack each night work together  <EOR> I am pretty much KBBQ neophyte certainly can't compare connoisseur   Easy find once know less mile 215 Rainbow south Rainbow  venue tastefully appointed sort industrial chic look   Two visits  best of times 2 30pm weekday worst of times 8 00pm Saturday no reservation right 100% capacity   Still most every aspect positive   The servers kind enough provide good bit GIY grill it yourself tutoring during initial weekday visit  return Saturday night final exam really busy provide much further guidance  think earned least B course  Then again know old academic saying Pay your fees your Bs  The deal basically $17 AYCE lunch $20 AYCE dinner    The banchan side dishes again am position judge but all pretty tasty  focused refill effort kimchi couple other items  Then mostly hugged rib eye bulgogi hey rib eye right?   But threw bit short ribs well  Servers attentive could obviously more during weekday visit  Still wee bit aggressive both visits accomplish more serious work more meat grill grill cover swap etc   all while keeping eye 90 minute AYCE countdown   Again everything basically pretty tasty  comped little ice cream cookie desert take door   Note branch rather popular KBBQ venue Chinatown named Tofu Hut take additional stamp of approval venue    This likely best better options KBBQ immediate area     at  myself am feeling turning into KBBQ kind gentleman but may hit again time time  <EOR> I don't write many reviews but fiance hoping Korean BBQ restaurant would open near house finally did  Honestly if decent would quite happy    That being said fantastic  $20 all eat dinner add $4 per person ribeye well  kimchi daikon both excellent  salad very good steamed egg also well done    The ribeye actually meat may worst but still quite good  overly seasoned but fresh piece meat quite good  brisket kalbi pork shoulder all fantastic    The modern vents use nice didn't deal smoke many other joins ChinaTown  service absolutely outstanding drinks constantly refused offered more meats regularly made sure if wanted any additional sides salads sauces taken care of   This type place see myself returning 40+ time per year if service quality remains anywhere near level first visit  <EOR> Super bomb place love all eat deal very cool neat place portions good meat marinated well   Drop check them ! <EOR> I've down Doh couple times now  KBBQ little small compared others but atmosphere comfortable choice decor music background    The service quick friendly hostesses attentive refilling water banchan making sure heat grill good temperature   The selection meats pretty good well  best meats tried would hands down beef bulgogi brisket  shrimp squid beef tongue all good well  also ordered mild chicken bulgogi unfortunately miss entire table would recommend ordering it  each finished off mochi ice cream they strawberry mango green tea which perfect ending meal    To honest if live nearby Doh worth going but live opposite side town would pick others over it  However if found myself area would encourage others give try  <EOR> Amazing price incredible close home food quality point service spot on  Location far cleanest nicest all places spring mountain  Must try! <EOR> I would come back again!
