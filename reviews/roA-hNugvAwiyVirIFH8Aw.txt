It's fast food high your expectations be?!    You know exactly getting when pull into drive thru     Every time happy   huge fast food eater but sometimes bacon burger some tater tots really hit spot    Sonic best ice   Did know buy bag??  good!  love love love Strawberry Slush   amazing ice crushed even more bits fresh strawberry sugary drink good   Yummy  <EOR> The standards location steady decline   usually favorite cookie dough flavored Master Blast made dried nuggets cookie dough    wants bite into pellets dried chalky dough??  Oreo Blasts properly mixed left hollow center regular basis   times find bits other flavors blast indicating obviously aren't completely cleaning equipment last customer order   C'mon Sonic keep your game tight   For Blasts done right 3431 N  Ranco Drive worth stop  <EOR> This place need better management   Whom ever managing now does know properly staff nor train staff   never back  AGM 400 seat restaurant much more standers then sonic would be  But least train your staff work smarter more efficient then staff is   every time come sit forever if two cars takes FOREVER!! Idk if manager doesn't proper staffing don't care if kids move not    Waiting 15 20 mins heat tend loss your appetite   Bottom line horribly managed!!  mention your profits would much higher!  watched 4 cars pull away time decided join them!  All while he original car sat ordering station!!! Super annoying!!! first time experiencing but last!!! <EOR> If other half wasn't love ice t weird little ice balls would never location  It's very convenient where live Service awful  something wrong messed every single time stop tea?!  No pretzel buns special pretzel hot dogs  going try one  Scratch that  Also charged twice order  even phone show girl she said only thru once  Hmmm okay    I'm just fan sonic  Over years feel gone downhill  <EOR> The happy hour Sonic Drive In Sonic standout over other fast food restaurants   just patient line cars during time   fortunate pull window 5pm  the last customer   Sonic relives past its rollerskating service yes slushes world  just sip slow otherwise once often brainfreeze  strawberry slush strawberries yes!  Sonic definitely must <EOR> I apologize previous comment made long ago  must bad day  However wonderful staff  <EOR> I sonic Decatur Craig 9 45pm recently left 10 10pm experience horrible  better experiences DMV post office  Yes half priced shakes which good but might well pay full price  large popcorn chicken $5 29 size medium fry also 4 piece mozzarella stick  Now if your selling mozzarella sticks should know customer would marinara them should come mind simple common sense notify customer marinara sauce when ordering give customer food them look see isn't any marinara now back into drive through line just ask marinara them say don't any  never location again I'd rather drive location cannery  reasons location getting 1 star because pricing quantity popcorn chicken lack knowledge work ethic common sense staff  <EOR> Yesterday ordered medium chocolate cream pie shake when ate top OK but when started eat bottom tastes sour cream sour milk disgusting now diarrhea <EOR> DO come location  am sure where quality food service used good Sonic location  last couple visits disappointing  food never prepared correctly  Tonight burger cold cheese want even melted  fries cold soggy sitting while  just threw whole meal out  Wasn't going waste gas back complain  Just won't come back location  hope Management takes notice reviews some changes  <EOR> Yeah forget much location sucks!!!

When cashier says price changed computer but menu  Rip off  <EOR> Unbelievably SLOW   fairly certain spent close 30 mins drive thru only three cars ahead us   ordered 2 slush's order onion rings    Plus felt uncomfortable using debit card immediately called bank card deactivated new card issued   never drive through where closed window run your card   Plus looked receipt card KEYED which according bank highly suspicious fraud   Lesson learned pay cash when ordering food   happy visit never return  <EOR> Food hot busy but still should spent 30minutes drivethru  also mad seeing chicken looked like  McDonald's nuggets bigger all peices too  Very disappointed <EOR> I no service issues location only shakes which fantastic only problem many choices! Never ate thier burgers I don't eat meat can't comment that  <EOR> I dined establishment 4 times hopes time getting experience always read solid combination old fashioned service delicious tater tots unique beverages fun niche being served young lad roller skates  Unfortunately reality Sonic far cry represented company both written visual advertising    Let's start service  quick serve drive thru lane consistently faulty speaker system extremely difficult place order without having repeat several times  When asked question concerning its expansive menu would often receive dead silent reply no answers forthcoming  Add consistently long wait time food leads extremely high expectations justify wait  Unfortunately justification also vain    The food quality extremely disappointing all visits  Though say pretzel dogs shining light tater tots consistently mushed together served well below would consider adequate temperature    The value just isn't either  no problem paying premium higher fast food like N example but Sonic just doesn't deliver aspect either    Overall am extremely disappointed  both food quality service local Sonic simply cannot recommend anyone  <EOR> It first time ever trying sonic drive in didn't know fast food could slow! waited almost 10 minutes more? guess making food fresh    We ordered Chicken club toaster sandwich good! tasted just ones good diner  tasted made order chicken crispy hot    The fries good liked dipping them into bbq sauce ranch sauce    I would definitely order chicken sandwich again!
