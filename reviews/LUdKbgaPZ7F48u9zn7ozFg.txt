Sourdough Burger Chicken Fajita Pita Curly Fries Jalapeño Poppers all good choices well  <EOR> This visit worse Jack in the Box visit EVER!!! waited line 10 minutes before anyone ever took order  No front me  Then no coke! Only Diet Coke!!!!  Then took FOREVER give order made order wrong  ordered buttery bacon Swiss burger dry  fries over cooked cold  service sassy lady    The worse thing whole visit weren't even busy  only waiting long order  people kept looking ignored me  finally took order 3 other people waited me  10 MINUTES!!! DRIVE THRU ONLY 2 CARS!!! <EOR> I just particular jack box which used favorite because great customer service  only did give wrong shake when home took drink water bug shell mouth  swirling straw could see entire bug mixed in  never again  am disgusted  <EOR> Definitely going back Jack Box again  only customers drive through  Two people kept trying answer speaker box confusing both themselves  When finally right screen pulled window  handed drink first  glad tasted right away because ordered Dr  Pepper but gave Coke  rest order sirloin burger onion rings jumbo jack curly fries  handed bag told nice day  looked bag before drove away only sirloin burger curly fries box fries only half full  told window guy missing onion rings another burger  asked wait  point cars getting backed drive through line  When he came back asked fill fries which thankfully he did  Eventually girl came window onion rings burger told wait another minute  Apparently she waiting sirloin burger guy already given us  Finally all sorted out  Food below par would expect Jack Box  <EOR> We came off work today  through drive thru when window told employee could only pay X amount card rest another card  employee said she would ask co worker help started conversing Spanish RUDE!   When original employee came back window she said only take card   Then other employee said something else first then tell oh wait yeah ring way want  wife then reiterated could only pay much card rest paid other card  employees said could but would better if more money first card Strike 2   asked them if military discount since USAF veteran hoping might reduce cost said discount which provided veteran ID  minute later other employee says No no more discount then charged FULL AMOUNT card told them could only set amount Strike 3   When asked them why charged full amount card both stated told only charge card when reminded them told could run payment way asked first employee walked away while second employee started talking over said wrong  When tried them refund employee sour look face then looked everywhere but she hoping would just leave In Baseball where they'd called but isn't baseball   second employee then demanded card receipt back she could refund    At point mad inside asked employee counter General Manager's name contact information  employee giving crap window came over said charge need talk lady refunded receipt  then repeated request GM's contact information told Call 1 800 number receipt GM's direct #  When asked so called manager's name she said can't name going give told can't charge two cards call police  thought going heart attack spot over stupidity only incident but staff supposed providing customer service instead failing de escalating situation    As type am still livid incident both called 1 800 # which just survey line could through real person voice concern sent email customer service team contact information requesting call back  whole experience left bad taste mouth pun intended funds hold weekend then some bad review fast food chain used enjoy  <EOR> One best jack box's Las Vegas area  jack's food awhile now but prepared fresh location it  Top service! Freshly made every time  really follow jacks motto don't till order also unlike other jacks don't park  employees also friendliest  think  sets them apart other jacks  would rather drive 5 mins near house just friendly people work here! <EOR>
