Let straight point you plenty good proteins unlike other places super greasy! prices super reasonable    I myself 2 chicken breast skewers which perfectly seasoned but oversalted juicy especially greasy came rice don't really care others said use seasoning    perfect way was  prefer salt dishes  Same salad dressing side but decided sprinkle ilt lemon  last but least    BREAD! Omg! Fluffy but yeasty heavy seasoned but super salted fattening     stayed pretty pretty soft hours being served    we took boxes go     best pita style bread ever whole life    In other words feels extremely authentic experience happy could eat complete fullness without having worry messing macros     I back again! <EOR> This first review because restaurant good  Food delicious   French fries better others  Also restroom really clean   think 10 10 ! <EOR> Kabobs bombdigity  Gyros bit simple usual but something pita bread worth simplicity gyro  Service always super!
