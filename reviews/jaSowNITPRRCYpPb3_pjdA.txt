The first main entrees finally table served kid's chicken fingers fries rest table wait another 5 10 minutes before food  course orders messed up  Cobb Salad which would assume lot easier steaks arrived LAST! personally ordered Flat Iron Steak béarnaise sauce cooked medium side mashed potatoes  BUT WELL DONE steak mashed potatoes NO sauce  Also typically when order steaks waiter brings steak knives but just ANOTHER thing diners ask for! Oh reason steak being OVERCOOKED?!? Apparently sitting under heat lamp long! SERIOUS?!?! KIND HEAT LAMPS USING!!!! said going re cook steak but point anger experience lost appetite completely   They served filet steak medium rare when asked cooked medium side mushrooms course didn't side right either! Instead mushrooms brought mashed potatoes! ELSE WRONG!!!!!  FINALLY find manager let know what's going on  He going fix problem offering free desserts but point all just really wanted leave!  We seated next family friends family waiters course attended without any problems    THE BEST all excuses!!!! waiter told all day short staffed excuse WORSE SERVICE EXPERIENCED! Mind family eat plenty different restaurants all over city FAR WORST!
