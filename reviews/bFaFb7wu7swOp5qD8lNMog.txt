Food taste excellent cooked high quality noodle   would back     Only small downside I would suggest set air conditioning temperature lower!  hot summer day    108!  Eating spicy food drinking hot soup doesn't help cool down  <EOR> Food quality 5 stars  Nice people working there  really atmosphere think could work that  Regardless back often  <EOR> Good food great service   Love those noodle bowls various appetizers   If sichuan food great place close Chinese Asian  restaurants <EOR> OMG place wonderful  loved everything tried spicy radishes pickled cabbage beef noodle soup mung bean soup iced jelly desert   partner tomato based noodle soup fried egg sliced fresh tomatoes it  He said excellent  thought service outstanding  offer various levels spiciness which good thing  think medium hot enough most people   first experience eating authentic Sichuan dishes   back   highly recommend Mian  <EOR> I love place! yelping eat while Vegas place popped up  ordered Chili Oil Chashou Spicy Wontons House Beef Noodles  spicy wontons better ones Ding Tai Fung  much flavor sauce! noodles plentiful delicious too  beef noodles tender    I would visit place again Vegas even drive location Los Angeles if ever crave Szechuan cuisine! <EOR> Must try! mung bean water something look forward when coming here  Definitely recommend if love spicy flavorful chinese noodles! <EOR> Really recommend store  dumpling appetizer beef! gift green bean soup pretty cool! <EOR> My wife ordered house beef noodle beef pickled noodle share each other   waiter quick point dishes  spicier side   lighter spice level house beef noodle which ended perfect me   dark beef broth saltier less sweet some other beef noodle soups had   Very flavorful   The beef pickled noodle distinctively different broth   Light color but heavily seasoned numbing spice peppercorn which waiter did warn about    he wasn't kidding! Both wife couldn't feel mouths few bites   broth flavor good but probably would've enjoyed more if less peppercorn   Overall food good appreciate waiter being upfront food   Would definitely come back again  <EOR> I think place best chinese noodle town  menu simple but enough choices  menu picture each dish which helps deciding order  prices also very reasonable  Less $10 noodle dish   For first visit tried chengdu style zhajiang noodle side order chicken gizzard  noodle cooked perfectly soft chewy  asked regular spicy level found slight amount heat which kept building ate more  However wasn't spicy where would hard eat  sichuan style food  way spicier where literally numbed your tongue made sweat crazy  noodle dish place didn't if super spicy food regular heat level might satisfy ask extra spicy  chicken gizzard tasty though chicken gizzard only but rather chicken giblet actually spicier noodle   They gave plenty food struggling finish bowl but if need more food ask extra noodle free  drinks gave sweet mung bean soup which helped cool off heat which would refill   The only downside restaurant located same small plaza where tea station ichiza parking challenge during busy time  However always park bigger chinatown plaza next door walk over  <EOR> I wanted more   really enjoyed thin noodles hot sour soup well wontons   Ther jia jia mien noodles disappointing   sauce great but noodles different story    noodles overcooked cooked pot much starch needed rinsed because noodles ended gummy consistency   If fixed would elevate 4 5 stars   Their mung bean soup tea quite good though   part itself worth trying  <EOR> I think Mian great! restaurant isn't big shopping plazas inadequate parking spots but food tasty affordable   The menu isn't big but offers several noodle dishes mian means noodle almost all which less $10  also served complimentary pickled cabbage complimentary refillable green bean soup I LOVE green bean soup   top off also provide FREE unlimited noodle refills   The noodle dishes all very authentic tasty  noodles themselves fresh chewy well  Service decent  Decor quaint especially all comment cards hung up   All all between taste freebies value price highly recommend Mian quick inexpensive yet delicious meal  <EOR> I craving really spicy food decided try place out  ordered Chengdu Zajiang am assuming similar Dan Dan noodles at Shang since no soup    I told spicy really spicy opted medium heat  disappointed order taken wrong when noodles came could taste no heat all  asked side chili peppers added good amount dish  flavors way better spice  Since noodles cooked spices spicy should been    We weren't given option mung bean soup but then again didn't ask it  sure if automatically comes your meal available upon request  still enjoyed meal even though wrong  am looking forward having place again dish made correctly lol  <EOR> Decided check place friend because feeling extra adventurous figured would awesome place explore! Y'all probably wondering why would person cannot eat spicy food come all gotta say #YOLO   I ordered chengdu zajiang dish which pretty tasty chef's choice! noodles good amount chew factor broth dish added plenty flavor  could given bit more meat veggies dish but overall good dish  Eating kind reminded spaghetti ground beef   just without marinara sauce   Another cool thing place mung bean drink really refreshing cool hint sweetness it  meant help cool down spicy dishes but pretty good even if don't eat spicy food me    Overall would recommend checking place if love spicy noodle dishes! Even able enjoy place would probably come back day just see if handle eating spicy dishes haha  <EOR> Definitely tasting Chinese cuisine  would recommend special gizzard noodle  steam egg really good  <EOR> Service great food delicious free cold mung bean soup   loved it!
