Great Food Great Service wonderful manager Jared U  came table frequently just check us    Tons choices all eat dinner menu which huge plus!  We enjoyed everything ordered  back! <EOR> I'm usually easy going person food but place first yelp review! This probably worst sushi place tried   and GRAND OPENING!!! waited more hour seated noticed waitress kept letting people skip front which rude! seated waited least another 30 mins before drinks  Then finally order   alot items menu ran available  Totally understandable having promotion BOGO!  Then half orders didn't came just waited couldn't find server couldn't even check  walk counter ask check  just couldn't stay any longer wait food forgot place prepare  entire meal took around 4 hours!!! definitely would recommend place any friends nor ever coming back visit even if offer BOGO  <EOR> People often say never judge book its cover place definitely those cases  pictures design mention Izakaya H20 seem likes something new exciting  fresh take AYCE sushi if will  Upon entering seems everything checks out  place nice clean interior design great  place reminded alot Gen design choices  service good being soft opening couple mixups food runners  But expected especially since did Bogo ayce sushi  order through checklist 3 rounds decided order lot first round getting whatever looked good  already warning signs menu when realized nothing really stood Izakyaka basic appetizers any ayce sushi place  When food came lowest expectations shattered     Every roll nigiri tasted liked nothing  basic hallmarks sushi One  fresh your fish Two  quality your sushi rice  When miss both does find audacity even serve something this? Salmon Yellowtail Tuna  all distinctive tastes yet all tasted dry meat while some chewy when no reason be  fish rice portion great big fish small rice  But when tasted rice realized means distract someone terrible rice is! tasted nothing rice choppy falling apart  sauce anything mind you  3 rolls 12 pieces nigiri all special Carpaccio  ask difference wouldn't able tell you  first time where still hungry mouth didn't want swallow food yet force myself finish wouldn't lost any more money place    The izakaya  know izakaya simply means small dishes stuff but when most Japanese spots around throw word Izakaya usually means something  takoyaki literally fried donut octopus smaller then dime   jalepeno poppers shrunken pieces jalepeno little spicy mayo top tuna crispy rice basically tempura batter   Places Kyara Hachi Raku Ichiza definitions real izakaya aspires fact even way add Izakaya name disgrace    This type place people bring first time sushi goers leave them never wanting ever try sushi again  blatant million dollar cash grab nice designs attempting trick into thinking food good maybe just you  Yet putrid mediocrity everything made quickly brings ones senses  Upon walking witnessed multiple tables hands over mouths holding food back couples looking horror table full trash somehow find way finish  course place ends everything off home run giving girlfriend food poisoning  Curled next toilet  way end lovely night  <EOR> Would rate no stars if could  Waited almost 2hrs when asked table wait time said couple tables ahead 20min wait  Fast forward 30 40mins later asked again table said never told them table skipped seated other groups us  Didn't try probably never try <EOR> Came party 4 tonight great time  server Romeo bomb! <EOR> My daughter lunch during grand opening week when bogo Ayce offer   Thought excellent deal    Food wise   broiled mussels good teriyaki chicken bland no sauce all sashimi great   Sushi also good    What didn't  service   asked fork took almost 20 minutes   ask 3 different waiters    For new restaurant   think should particular   understandable if place busy  But  time really busy    think just 7 occupied tables see waiters just keep running around but bringing any orders   I don't know   just can't understand took them long customer fork    Maybe just opening jitters   Hope they've passed   <EOR> Food alright but best  overall service bad  friends would order few items would left waiting 30 40 minutes  constantly kept checking waiter he would tell should bit  orders kept getting mixed other tables  last order didn't even receive until paid check which hour ordered it  Waiters waitresses treated friends disrespectfully giving rude attitude when speaking us  Only good thing place BOGO AYCE coupon  Still waste money opinion  Definitely won't back again  <EOR> No fish rice 6pm don't let put name down reservation waiting list even want wait try it  should prepare more food when did Ad buy free  funny  No good <EOR> This good place different traditional Japanese Izakaya  love decoration location bright glass really fashion   We came lunch  service good  servers nice too  Food really fresh  Especially fish  sauce fried chicken super awesome  Love it   Definitely come back  Strongly recommend one  Good place chill eat  Next time come try dinner  <EOR> I loved service super quick   fish also super fresh ! suggest getting albacore lover sumo roll  <EOR> Thanks very yummy  Will back soon  I love suchi  Fresh tasty  Sake warm delicious  Excellent service well  Very good value Fresh good  Rogertt <EOR> I visited place last month  told opened less 2 months ago  usually don't AYCE don't expect much all eat place  But place excellent w carpachio various choices izakaya stuffs   Accidentally visited place but outcome way better expected  little curious yelp rating   place awesome Good price Clean interior fresh food many choices  <EOR> Food ok service good !!! should take long serve order things multiple times    <EOR> The fish really fresh  decent selection rolls all eat menu  Good drink specials all day Sunday  service great all rolls came within 5 10 minutes  <EOR> H2O Sushi Izakaya probably most disappointing dining experiences ever Las Vegas native  found place due Instagram page which boasts photos ads high quality sushi other Japanese cuisine  But let clear food see Instagram page far when actually dine there  When friends first arrived location felt place extremely aesthetic modern looking  But aside looks food service very things define fine dining experience absolute garbage  don't know if because party 7 people all participated All Day AYCE $19 99 promotion but food received only late but also sub par just straight inedible  feel servers waiters establishment horrifically negative bias towards AYCE customers teenage customers waiter showed obvious signs sarcasm negativity  should also emphasize 3 different waiters still raise goddamn hands students attention  The place wasn't even busy time which around 8 30 pm almost no excuse why way attention 3 different waiters  food ordered mediocre can't even remember all dishes ordered  albacore carpaccio bland barely any taste albacore rolls lifeless smelt egg roe nigiri extremely salty takoyaki undercooked felt extremely doughy bones eel salmon nigiri even hair friend's macaron ice cream  Long story short food definitely worth unusually long wait times through  All food ordered could done other sushi restaurants under 10 minutes wait 25+ minutes some most simple dishes menu only disappointed food's execution taste end  friend August ordered chicken skewer which only took 25 minutes apparently bring but skewer laughable  Like literally all friends laughing disappointing chicken skewer was  literally skinnier stalk asparagus took kitchen 25 minutes bring us   like wtf? Maybe arrived off days maybe just downright unlucky but friends know never come back again establishment literally made Saturday night cruel disappointment  If decide eat wish best luck seems needing only decent service but also tasty food reasonable time  <EOR> I've never Sushi restaurant where if person does AYCE whole table must AYCE   All wanted order roll catch friends but allowed order anything since didn't want AYCE  won't back  <EOR> My friend came because grand opening BOGO    The interior nice comfortable  However food service great  came 10 30pm when place closes midnight  ordered first round which came pretty quickly considering restaurant wasn't full busy  sushi ok but most nigiri fresh especially squid  took bite spit because mushy smelled foul    Second round came apparently already last call 11 00pm rushed order everything once   second round most orders incorrect such yellowtail hand roll came albacore then suddenly edamame when didn't write paper  funny thing when turn paper sit front review ordered still wrong  No refills tea 3 different people when did refill busser brought cup tea leaving friends cup empty  When asked refill manager came back said shut off tea machine asked if water ok   what other options have? charged $2 per tea think because they're closing ok  didn't even remove tea charge bill that  worst part? friend pretty sick eating afterwards  Let's just say both dehydrated result this  would come back even if another BOGO  <EOR> This probably favorite sushi spot town  love rolls offer reasonable prices  say service great sushi chefs really top game  Ivest favorite chef he's cute love style!   Can't enough place amazing vibes especially relaxing day where just feel sushi other items offer  Definitely recommend  chill spot nice date night some friends catch up  If 4 arms I'd give place 4 thumbs up! Lol <EOR> Beautiful decor superb fish excellent service  Amazingly low  AYCE prices all day Sat Sun happy hour !!  This new !! <EOR> Two stars bit stretch  Ordered bit sushi roll  Chef gave Halibut instead Toro  Simple mistake he fixed  Roll appetizing only ate 2 pieces  Happy hour menu said Grey Goose $4 99 but apparently if shake put martini glass $6 99  just dumb  asked server why he explained shots only  orders shots Grey Goose? frat party   Decor clean looked cool  Place dead Friday happy hour  really looking sushi place off strip   I might give another chance but disappointed  <EOR> Came several days back H20's opening week  guys Southern California area branching Vegas first location state  would say did pretty good job considering circumstances   It really busy when there  Super busy  didn't mind because understood circumstances  time seated ready it  AYCE sushi thing quite popular Vegas but adding little twist it  put hipster vibe it  really liked décor   Service OK but could better  opening week sure accustomed numbers now  Hopefully   The food  liked pretty much everything ordered here  freshness across board really well done  only thing came little strange squid  came little bit fresh but edible  But everything else really great recommend carpaccio's phenomenal  only thing wished Uni AYCE menu but oh well boy dream can't he?  I would definitely recommend place anyone wants very good quality sushi place fun modern vibe  <EOR> My girlfriend came BOGO ayce experience   The service H2O definitely excellent  busser sounds bruno mars  He really friendly  initially over ordered server politely suggested amended order wouldnt over charged  ended ordering most specialty rolls  When complained management gracious enough deal shenanigans  Honestly very caring  waters refilled amazing rate well    Onto food  Most everything delicious  chicken sweet crunchy takoyaki soft enough chewy texture tako tempura warm crunchy yakitori perfect especially chicken   soft tender mussels well baked lightly sweet furikake fries honestly great crunchy outside soft inside while crispy rice wasn't favorite poppers delicious  appetizers great most nigiri good well  rice sweet bit sour  Most fish carpaccio nigiri fresh  exceptions ikura yellowtail  informed staff girlfriend eaten ikura  management informed ikura usually smells fishy tastes salty complained but time simply didn't smell fresh  When smelled tried some confirm  didn't taste fresh either  Later down line also yellowtail  Initially dove right but moments consuming something didn't feel right  ended stomach aches found ourselves finishing chicken takoyaki avoid charge  Even complaint though management took away ikura yellowtail bill  very nice them so  really appreciate them that    If yellowtail ikura food experience would really nice especially great service presented  leave tentative 3*  feel H2o deserves second chance  Earlier week problem running food when tried first time assume hectic week  update second around  Honestly great potential experience just few bad eggs  <EOR> The sitting area beautiful but food pure trash  many sushi places  But place far worst  Also waiters very rude judgmental  gave look every time decided order another dish off menu  did all eat sushi could definitely feel vibes annoyed because ordering lot food  But all eat expect  average amount food party four would order when going all eat sushi  Never coming back again!! suggests guys Sakana locates Maryland flamingo  won't disappointed promise that  sushi rolls amazing  give excellent customer service  Don't waste your money here!! <EOR> Came GALentine's day dinner girls amazing!

Highly recommend!  Best AYCE sushi ever definitely coming back next come Vegas  all eat CAROACCIOS <EOR> This place fantastic! Very upscale cozy inside  came lunch when say probably best sushi places ever been  all eat sushi rolls huge  good looked amazing when all came out  place only 3 months very very new  great job guys doing  Keep good work  Oh service superb! <EOR> I really liked atmosphere decor sushi quality really good  Why giving three stars restaurant 25% full significant time rolls come out  last roll took 15 minutes when ordered until it  roll  When ordered drinks came two plates sushi came weren't checked often would've liked seeing much business restaurant  probably give another try just because fish good but if service poor again last time  <EOR> My friends told horrible place but wanted try myself  Usually AYCE restaurant dinner more expensive because offer something bit more premium such uni sweet shrimp  But charge extra just bc its dinner nothing different   I think most people come because BOGO  don't know if because management just don't care customer service? bus girl literally warned first when she led table saying penalty left over food don't crazy  fucking serious? Then waiter came don't know if ever experience someone being politely rude   He using all nice words but just came off feeling he friendly he doesn't really care  waited over hour sushi come don't want even begin new restaurant quality meat good  eating 3pm Tuesday literally 3 other tables restaurant took them 1 hour finish 12 sushi?! mean WOW! raised glass waiter he knew need water  Half hour passed he did refill water  bring glass kitchen ask some water  best part comes getting check  told waiter ready check  15 mins passed he seems forgot request  walk cashier told waiting 15 mins check  She gave don't give shit look print check took credit card  sign credit card back said Thank she DID EVEN RESPOND am even there  ironic because general manager Mr  Ko sitting right next bar looking comments yelp  Well please read Mr  Ko  customer service ur restaurant sucks don't even care even though sitting right next them  opened 2 properties strip know customer service your restaurant none  If don't take some serious action training your newly expensive renovation would probably going waste  <EOR> Super good! ate all eat Lychee Blue drinks  four barely finished drink but AMAZING  Staff attentive nice! Def would recommend come back <EOR> I left H2O's BOGO grand opening mixed feelings  location nicely decorated modern prices reasonable plating nice service attentive personable  But AYCE menu limited some ways other similarly priced spots few nigiri options no dessert   balance they're only places offer carpaccio dishes  found myself preferring rolls because fish itself didn't seem much flavor own  took while notice because each round ordered took around 45 minutes hit table other appetizers which came quickly    They manage basics well the tako shrimp better average effort utilize garnishes both add flavor dishes visually appealing  But fish quality itself could bit better more consistent  timing issues experienced chalk kitchen kinks worked time though note dining room half empty when experienced delays  willing give place another try    First world problems sister poke spot poor lighting most tables  Ask spot back left corner under LED wall if matters you  <EOR> The salmon carpaccio bomb!  Definitely it!  server Neysha amazingly friendly!  just wished offered dessert AYCE menu  <EOR> The service place great! Such good food came fast  Definitely recommend probably best AYCE sushi places Ive to! <EOR> Avoid place!! order food over 20 min received nothing  Then when mention acted surprised hadn't received food  Everyone around getting food every direction  Then manager so called came table told everything ordered brought food didn't order basically here's leftovers  still paid meal tipped 30% because don't let incompetence change are  manager approached said know you're angry which cordial situation  actually more offensive  told next time would cover meal  called talk ask giving them another try told describe manager he looked when  gave all info then someone else phone asked all same questions  Then told come point   2 weeks since happened see other reviews clear wrong business  Las Vegas food center world  No need waste time terrible service food never get  <EOR> BOGO sushi? We're there! decor place really nice  slight ocean smell upon walking could tell still working getting place ready business  wasn't big deal maybe  why service    alright  sushi menu extensive all  No super white tuna nigiri which favorite but lots variations california rolls  very underwhelmed especially its nearly $26 price tag dinner  seems place draw novice sushi eaters course all tourist strip  nigiri cut very thick point where really annoying eat  sushi rolls poorly put together  honest opinion best thing pork belly french fries ordered year old  kept getting asked how's food  understand new business needs feedback but think getting asked three times throughout meal little overkill  ordering system sheet paper fill yourselves  happy tried but probably won't back  <EOR> We die hard fans Goyemon but place some solid fish very clean great staff price  AYCE sashimi which insane if feeling treating yourself but going all your caloric intake then could your spot   Only bad thing don't substitutions don't salmon skin AYCE  <EOR> I came 3 friends around 6 30pm Monday evening  restaurant located Hughes Center off Flamingo close Paradise  tucked away visible street  restaurant very modern elegant  pretty dead when walked probably because location seated immediately   We all AYCE priced $26 95 pp which comparable competitors  liked menu showed pictures rolls detailed descriptions  2 different menus ala carte other AYCE  Usually when AYCE everything menu but case here  Many ala carte items AYCE menu cucumber rolls roll scallops which friends favorite  also offer half rolls which disappointing because gives option try more things  last bummer dessert included AYCE additional $4 5 more    We ordered some appetizers variety rolls some nigiri  food came slowly which odd considering slow restaurant was  enjoyed garlic chili edamame Vegas roll salmon nigiri  fish rice ratio crazy in good way nigiri  only little rice huge piece fish which usually opposite other places  service good always someone coming check fill waters clear plates  But because million other AYCE sushi spots town exclusions place unfortunately done me  <EOR> *** Review 10 30 17  I quite surprised when checked into restaurant saw such low rating two stars!   interior extremely modern minimalist furniture design even crystals used throughout decor   Lots staff hand everything looked very clean though perhaps because still new? suppose time tell    I came lunch definitely enjoyed lunch special only $10 person! pretty unheard area being close strip   lunch itself also included much food note just call 'Combination Lunch' if ask '$10 lunch special' look though two heads   Combination Lunch choice 2 entrees you read right two! plus salad miso soup my co workers said good wouldn't know can't stand it dumpling California roll veggie tempura edamame  personally then shrimp tempura chicken teriyaki entrees  tempura items all VERY delicious as sauce along it   teriyaki also quite delicious  However everything else pretty mediocre   The service quite slow seemed staff wasn't really quite speed open yet  hoping just because still new  also waited quite some time checks meal  big no no lunch plaza because most people only hour need back work  Overall I'd probably return if only cheap filling lunch  far though favorite lunch spot  <EOR> The restaurant only open 6 months  staff knowledgeable skilled preparing sushi  chef Ryan prepared each course care  Very fresh imaginative  <EOR> I honestly don't understand all bad reviews here  experience nothing but pleasant! Servers fast helpful didn't mind explaining menu thoroughly  party seven quickly offered seats bar soon walked in  foods served fairly fast considering pretty packed restaurant  Everything satisfying however FAVORITE part dinner chef Ryan  He fun delightful very friendly  He served special dishes everything super fresh delicious!

Texture albacore quite firm feel should cut thick carpaccio  Dynamic California roll 3 5 upgraded California roll covered some teriyaki mayo mixture broiled onion scallops  bad first bite but gives greasy feeling afterwards  Vegas roll 3 5 eel tempura top but basically taste spicy tuna dominated whatever else roll  Takoyaki 2 5 5 freshly made which good  Apart hmm    Cheese pork cutlet 2 5 overdone no taste cheese all  Shrimp veggie tempura 1 5 5 well fried  Also sweet sauce did really fit tempura  Spicy tuna crispy rice 1 5 crispy rice just crispy hard chew   Service friendly responsive staff  Service gets noticeably slower ordered 2nd round probably because more customers  Overall experience pleasant   Environment clean modern  <EOR> Amazing food service  Food amazing usual  definitely back!

Typically should exceed expectations good way bad way  Aside long waits between each order kept forgetting bring food  example first round orders 5 orders salmon only them came keep asking when other 4 would come  happened again second round orders when ordered 2 furikake French fries  Only fries came once again ask couple times before check kitchen find where food was  Furthermore servers never checked ask food take orders  wave them down each time come  Let emphasize restaurant practically vacant except group  friends noticed some chefs just phone probably why food took long come out   Now just service   The food pitiful especially when compared sushi places such Jjanga Sushi Neko Goyemon Kabuto SOHO etc  simply wanted try place never before nearby boy mistake  rolls ordered albacore spicy tuna tasted dry flavorless  salmon eggs smelt eggs abnormally salty  only items enjoyed happened furikake french fries shiitake mushrooms    which both happen non fish items  Pretty ironic so called sushi place if ask me  friends kept finding bones rolls while may expected would avoidable chefs more careful attentive  Another friends found hair ice cream    yummy? hope establishment finds tasty  All around staff inattentive food poor quality guests come come again    Tl dr eat unless bad sushi bad service  <EOR> Vegas game day ritual!

If know trick bet restaurant does too   For specialty rolls ordered H20 Special Roll Rose Roll but also served Albacore Lover Roll mistake we ate without questioning if ordered it actually favorite item menu   garnish lightly fried crispy tempura battered onions best   even tried order its own appetizer but sadly request shutdown kitchen   if order just specialty roll highly recommend Albacore Lover   We also ordered Ultimate Salmon Roll second roll but tell restaurant must running low fantastic Salmon then amount Salmon served top roll anything but ultimate   still good just aesthetically pleasing pictured menu   What else add review?  Just more facts suppose   Premium AYCE price per person $19 95 weekday lunch excludes holidays until 3pm $25 95 dinner Kids under age 13 $13 95 They also items la carte menu available AYCE which does look worth try future visits   18% gratuity automatically charged party 6 more   2 hour limits better most <EOR>
