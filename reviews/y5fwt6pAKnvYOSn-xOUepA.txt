Fun friends! love environment food very yummy! Its great place dinner! <EOR> If you're weary high end expense account restaurants strip just crave something  fun flavorful recommended restaurant  Shop first mall inside fun stores Zara Diesel then enjoy tapas your stomach's content   This second trip two years experience both times good enough keep coming back    Recommended if you're looking something under $50 per person strip including drinks  <EOR> Excellent deal Happy Hour! Monday Fridays believe sit high tables around  bar   Most happy hour places town only until 6 pm found place until 7  All sangria half off $3 tapas 8 select happy hour menu We tried pitcher blackberry sangria it's 6 small glasses beacon wrapped dates calamari some other stuff forgot names of  But dates calamari must! good!  I didn't give 5 stars because lighting inside very dark    could barely see menu  sure more ambiance but could turn light little bit  Also parking Fashion Show  become pain  during mid week still spend while looking parking spaces garage  <EOR> A friend mine gave tip Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's Happy Hour husband looking place grab some dinner Friday night friends suggestion  Half Price Tapas Pitchers Sangria bar area    We ordered butt load apps two Sangria's less 25 bucks  steal  probably only tapas dish didn't particularly care but price   I would definitely recommend Happy Hour would definitely back    Cozy atmosphere great service  <EOR>
