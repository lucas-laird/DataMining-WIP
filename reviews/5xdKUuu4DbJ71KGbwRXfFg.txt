<EOR> Pretty good ramen   I wish left order all original give more equal comparison other Vegas ramen  Instead excited ordered tonkatsu black garlic oil spice level hot  ramen joint spice level bit adventurous your spice level  isn't spicy thought would but told level spicy pretty much lava  Next time spice level fire  Mind ask chili side if want cautious  chili use good kick hits back throat but does away fairly quickly  smokey way some dried chili oils are  Kobo's chili ground dried chili oil rather oil dried chili bits it  allows chili oil overpower sit top broth  Normally oil add extra fat heaviness already rich tonkatsu broth but doesn't  would recommend people add extra chashu  only slice regular order but extra comes 4 slices  noodles little thicker since homemade  good taste freshness BUT am thin ramen noodle kind girl   Let's compare Kobo two other ramen places Moko Monta  Kobo definitely way better Moko  plain simple Kobo's flavor just taste better  tried Moko many occasions bad  Kobo's broth surpasses Moko's broth  Now compared Monta Kobo just step behind  Yes Kobo product Monta but only reason opinion noodles  said before am thin noodle person  prefer snap thin noodles rather softer homemade noodles  Both broths fantastic  chashu fantastic  Service great  Just because prefer Monta's noodles does mean hate Kobo  first visit but last  Definitely new ramen place    Added note parking much better Monta's parking lot  changed dinner plans before when Monta didn't any parking parking lot side streets  <EOR> This place delicious  menu small simple but everything flavorful  2 dollar bottles beer not happy hour pricing ! But every day all time  see ramen maker when first walk which super enchanting  3rd visit gets 4 stars because service kinda slow such small space  Everything thing else place 5 stars! <EOR> Honestly FAVORITE ramen place Vegas! options heat your ramen love ramen even more along consistency broth noodles delicious meat! expect wait Friday nights since traditional setting ramen place being quite small  But PROMISE worth wait! can't help but give great tip since service phenomenal every time go  can't visit any other ramen place now <EOR> Convenient location ample parking space! Definitely plus when compared Monta Spring Mountain  I around lunch opening day no wait seated right away  place nice small lot ramen places town  greeted everyone once walk right see workers making fresh noodles! Since restaurant faces West I'd hate making noodles sun blazing eyes   We asked wanted drink shortly sitting down usual water lemon   waiter check if lemon slices  xD don't blame them since opening day still pretty early guessing still trying figure things out  didn't any But hopefully future   We party 4 original shoyu ramen no spicy nitamago  Each both ramen minus vege ramen comes chashu pork fried garlic kikurage black mushrooms bamboo shoots fresh green chives ground pork sesame oil shredded red pepper  broth fatty flavorful perfect five stars  fresh homemade ramen review 4 star  ramen bad just really liking  more fan thick noodles Monta which completely different texture  Also even soaking noodles broth while still tasted bit bland  other hand chashu pork great fat meat ratio actually whole clove fried garlic broth  Yum  =] Also nitamago cooked soft boiled perfection  Gotta love runny yolk! black mushrooms bamboo shoots fresh green chives ground pork etc expected  No complaints there   I also try broth Miso ramen Hot spicy level three spicy four   kick but faded quickly didn't linger lot other spicy foods  even if can't handle spicy should okay level two spicy   I'll back try other broths well rice  Keep up! <EOR> Wonderful staff delicious food!

Yummm  Must try!   Service service always good fast  always sure enough employees cover all tables  But see space challenge especially when super busy trying bus table then deliver soups small hallway    Price little higher compared Monta Chinatown  Portion bigger though  only mushroom bamboo shoot 2 slices pork green onion included  Everything else extras    RecommendAtion Tsukemen favorite! Love hpw adjust your spicy level add extra toppings  would recommend include some extras  Eggs should included price since bowl already $9 10    Overall am satisfied back  If include more extra items price then back more often  <EOR> Love place flavor  Very simple menu items which fine me  Very small dining area but wait isn't surprisingly long  Good staff but only concern wished would sanitize tables each party leaves  saw them just wipe down wet rag which probably used table prior table before that  Tons bacteria rag probably    Yuck   other food great  <EOR> yum ! medium spicy tonkatsu nori chashu pork soft boiled egg meat egg comes cold need wait while dip food broth all consummate even temp <EOR> As lover ramen place just yummy! right amount broth ingredients  bit salty side but otherwise great  Keep mind spice levels high side when ordering  <EOR> Ramen Kobo favorites if favorite place eat Ramen Las Vegas  Mainly due fact noodles made fresh house daily  generally sit bar where watch cooks whip Fresh batch me  serve beer too  No complaints ! <EOR> I ordered Shoyu Ramen chicken broth mild but surprised see soup reddish chili flakes Tasting just soup would say more medium mild which don't mind but intended share someone does spicy food  basic toppings consist chashu pork 1 whole clove fried garlic kikurage black mushrooms bamboo shoots green chives moyashi bean sprouts ground pork shredded red pepper thats where chili flakes came   Other choices Tonkatsu Ramen pork broth Miso Ramen pork chicken broth Vege Ramen vegetable broth toppings    The toppings ramen noodle reddish colored soup all tasted awesome  Full flavor but salty  noodle expected homemade noddle would be  would definitely come back try other toppings soup types    After looking photo menu more carefully looks 5 choices original mild medium hot fire 4 originally thought  should've ordered original  <EOR> My wife daughter came Tuesday night   two year old daughter asleep stroller but staff very accommodating making space place sit   wife chicken broth bowl she really enjoyed it   Only thing she would differently order extra pork add egg   pork broth super spicy delicious!  would probably add egg well next time   also shared pork belly bowl which highly recommend!!

Busy 20mins in  Always great sign greatness!!! yummy fresh noodles!!! <EOR> I've several times now feel time review it  love open little later other restaurants area honestly being down street helps  If place 10 minutes further away would gone often? Honestly no  noodles broth above average but amazing  love spicy food but fire varies each time go  example where would rate medium all way fire  thought just but another party asked same thing night  told depends peppers  All staff very friendly  love concentrated menu but serving gyoza odd me  Not ramen expert but seems standard most other places  My biggest concern right now don't seem balance orders house orders well  Today during rush waited 25 minutes soup  Most time around 10 15 minutes  guest said may time day but watched 13 soups row before ours made  heard orders asking if theirs done yet because past quoted time  working house orders catch up  Now much busier  am curious if keep demand  <EOR> Delicious ramen! hope theh just bigger space accommodate waiting long!

Jinya probably most popular ramen spot LV honestly overrated but better group outings  Whereas KoBo great authentic Japanese decor but unfortunately very small restaurant    I personally enjoy ordering takeout just good when enjoy comfort your own home but without wait cramped feelings    I love adjust heat your preference 'Hot' heart    PS don't forget add egg! <EOR> Oh tasty ramen because freshly made  regular customer sure  setting ambiance really just Japanese restaurant   very nice! <EOR> My friend starving didn't feel driving far food  Ramen kobo 1 mile away !!

As someone loves spicy food eat ramen level fire all time  If handle really spicy food then fire nothing you  also love flavorful fresh ramen is  Every time comes always super hot fresh never lukewarm anything that    Service also very nice  place busy but even then servers try best check refill your water etc   The only problem place substitute take your ramen more something else  only add extra which cost extra $2 each topping  don't bean sprouts ground beef ramen always sub egg more chashu since only piece  bowl ends being around $14    However since ramen delicious wait time never over 15 min always come back place  Especially winter! <EOR> I'd pressed say ramen even better ramen eat Japan  Seriously!  Ramen KoBo same makers Monta Ramen really see similarities dinky dining area limited but extremely well executed options menu  Fancy seeing noodles made person? kitchen area open alongside end which divided glass see chefs cooks spinning flour hands noodles   I love place two reasons first reason  EDM all day everyday  just talking generic big room stuff  No place blasting oldies but goodies Tritonal's Now Never new tunes as 12 7 Illenium Borgeous more  Whoever decided play edm GOOD edm kudos you   Ok second reason menu items mentioned limited but very good  miso ramen extra pork order boiled eggs  But little thing made WORLD difference here   you adjust spiciness here  If you're spicy food lover game changer  Seriously never knew miso ramen tasted good when spicy going hottest next time    Not only but broth fattening clearly see smooth once nearly done your bowl  When all your noodles veggies things eaten away your broth fat bubbles floating around it'll clear  All clear here   I absolutely love place best part literally three minutes away new office now  Win win win  <EOR> The service really nice food aesthetically pleasing look but taste did match up  food itself bit lack lustered taste  broth really light overpowered toppings  would rather Jinya Marugame Monzo Ramen Sora <EOR> I very excited Japanese Ramen restaurant opened southwest area  love Japanese ramen haven't kind ramen San Francisco Japan town  husband 3 kids ordered shoyu original tonkotchu hot pork belly bowl fried rice  little skeptical place because yelp review read before went  However surprisingly very tasty even fatty all unlike review said  portion good freshly made noodles cooked just right  broth plenty flavors clean taste   thought tasty even better ramen San Francisco Japan town  My kids loved noodles fried rice asked come every day    P <EOR> My fave ramen spot!

never tipped under 15% even if acceptable tip  leave changes bill adds full dollar  Looks servers gossips everyone there  Most Japanese people met seen extremely polite however all chefs ramen kobo Japanese all servers Japanese either  never kind uncomfortable experience life  wonder if any customers watched reactions WOW     would feel embarrassed them  All other Japanese restaurants service always consistent super friendly  surprised people  never ever again  BTW server's breath disgusting! When he's standing next could smell breath! I read three star review few comments below looks place's really real shitty people extremely rude  very uncommon Japanese restaurants jaw dropping me  Very shitty place most likely cheaper labor  What's your most expensive item? $10? LOL ramen kobo guys win every level  <EOR> My family came eat first time extremely crowded little no space inside very small restaurant recommend going during peak hours unless patience wait dining go   decided order process really simple submitting order iPad counter took 20 minutes receive food due busy were  Everything packaged very well   Be careful hot go  warned Grandma medium instead hot just safe but she insisted even though she really enjoyed little spicy her  super excited try place because good reviews crowded made think going love it  ordered shoyu chicken ramen unfortunately wasn't thrilled all  didn't enjoy flavor only reason think giving second chance because much family enjoyed it  <EOR> By far best Ramen  Hand made noodles great flavor    can't wrong  Just doctor ordered anyone under weather perfect meal rainy day  If you're area go!

If sensitive spicy would've sent back  Luckily spicy food lover Tip    If sensitive spicy food tell them want plain instead mild   mild spice level 3 10   Usually Tonkotsu ramen comes straight al dente noodles decent ramen shops but theirs come freshly made non straight noodles  could tell noodles very fresh  enjoyed it   Though soup little spicy tasty flavorful  expecting soup much thicker but probably over diluted soup hot water   some reason chicken chachu ice cold just took fridge  don't know if supposed cold?? but would've better if warm hot   Location convenient right off 215 but if want Tonkotsu ramen would Monta   Will come back  <EOR> Absolutely coming back friends again    there Ramen noodles super good!

Location located southwest part town next Cafe Rio  When entering able see workers making fresh batches noodles  However shop very small  Aside around 10 seats bar only around 5 other tables rest shop  very tight much room move around  only seat full parties wary if bringing big group  take while finally seated  almost always wait during peak hours but never waited more 20 minutes party 2 3 because fast everything is   Menu menu short sweet  just choose your broth spice level extra toppings may want add  All bowls ramen come Chashu pork Kikurage black mushrooms bamboo shoots green chives ground pork sesame oil shredded red pepper  also other dishes eat pork belly bowl kimchi fried rice   Food careful spice! mild spice already some kick wary spice level choose  Broth rich lot flavor but nauseatingly fatty  noodles very thick capture taste broth very well  also decent amount ground pork huge slab chashu  enough where some almost every bite but does overpower dish itself  portions very big price around $10 without any add ins  Thankfully adding additional ingredients reasonable price always leave shop feeling very satisfied full  dying try non ramen dishes but always end opting ramen last minute  Hopefully soon could break curse finally give them try!  Service Workers very nice prompt accommodating  Food comes fast don't think ever gotten order wrong many times visited  never felt rushed pressured leave though great job ensuring wait times horrendous   The quality ramen genuinely kind workers convince frequently 30 minute drive where live eat Ramen Kobo  establishment deserves more attention currently getting  truly believe best ramen shops town! <EOR> This probably favorite place ramen noodles  amazing every time long line  very small place limited seating but let tell won't disappointed! <EOR> My favorite ramen restaurant city  come Kobo least once week staff always friendly welcoming  really can't wrong whether miso veg tonkatsu  sure add egg cause  best part  pick your spice level leave plain  If you're unsure spice handle always ask side adjust spice your liking  isn't really long sit down spot more on the go lunch spot somewhere stop quick dinner  serve canned teas sodas well draft believe bottled beer  No happy hour but prices reasonable doesn't need be  <EOR> Best ramen city!!!!

Beware when order spicy level! If you're unsure whether handle spiciness always ask them spice side slowly add in  All all bf coming least once week past half year continue weekly fix authentic spicy ramen! <EOR> I found place quite disappointing considering sister Monta ramen  noodles same consistency Monta toppings all right  felt noodles frozen  only thing tasted good broth    If down street try Oh Jah noodles definitely better lol  <EOR> Oh wow  tears face red  Miso Ramen Fire heat lying  many ramen joints all town claim spicy noodles some even offer scale  But highest portion scale never actually spicy  don't even highest spice tolerance but most places just don't it  next time come probably just order hot  Unless hungover miserable course because fire place would perfect cure   The noodles pretty damn awesome  them house even watch them them machine  windowed off front  Sadly set noodles ramen overlooked but batch extra noodles al dente great spongy quality  going give them benefit doubt original set  Hopefully fluke   The broth fantastic  Along aforementioned spice packed flavor all around excellent   My partner even vegetable broth usually dislike those greatly  Jinya only place town decent vegetable broth  However wasn't just decent  actually excellent  would mind eating all   One small gripe besides first batch over cooked noodles Asahi mugs tiny  They're worth price but just feel tiny actually getting full beer  ounces might but seem feel small   Can't wait come back  <EOR> Great Ramen fresh made noodles made right house  pork fried rice   lets just say always order eat another take home yes Delicious! only thing disappointing don't gyoza potstickers Monta their sister restaurant other ramen places    I Miso Ramen medium heat level extra chashu pork added corn green onion  good  ramen comes standard sliced black mushrooms asked them put bowl  live across town but worth drive gone back 3x total now  <EOR> I love miso pork chicken broth combo ! order without spice because pure taste broth  noodles delicious **TIP** request extra noodle if you're extra hungry  only $1 50!

Reminder never true fan ramen until came here  now dined twice take once  2 3 times tried something different basic shoyu today consisted miso  spice level little more kick may use to  recommend sticking mild kicking yourself chili oil powder have  am fan ground meat standard ramen  definitely consistency thing but much better without it  noodles indescribable cooked al dente yet experience anything other    The only problem have   they deliver nor post mates uber eats! But then again ramen should enjoyed restaurant  same experience when home    For any newbies give yourself some time  Typically slight wait but turnover quick  Don't impatient  disappointed! <EOR> First time today  waiting perfect weather pair ramen waited long summer over  First impression nice clean modern new joint but smell off  smell overwhelmingly stale oily  culinary red flag right away point  Lunch fairly busy but luckily sat bar right away  Before sat tho bathroom wash hands  Both men women bathroom signs said bathroom closed some work something  WHAT?! brand new place practically  But saw women's bathroom open no nearby quickly washed hands of course door opened foot propping open  Didn't want scare any female patrons know! Anyway hallway floor sticky which good sign don't good sanitary protocols  C'mon just opened door 30 mins before there  shouldn't way  sat bar dirty hoods caught eyes  Once again place being new hoods shouldn't dirty oil filth  Another sign   lack proper sanitation maintenance protocols    Next thing noticed workers kitchen making food doesn't seem much culinary training I'm accustomed expect see people behind kitchen knows food appreciation food making  highly doubt any workers any prior training making ramen before start working there  lack professionalism respect food making truly showed body language filthy stuffs saying  Especially heavy set guy pretty vocal non stop talking fairly loud while making noodle wish he stopped talking minimize spitting into food  reason alone would return place again since felt food isn't being made proper sanitary standard    Our ramen took little longer expected but bad  ordered medium miso thought quite spicy  staffs agreed ordered hot she normally order 8 9 10 Thai restaurants other ordered medium miso too  Taste wise I'd give 3 stars  noodle which boast making in house own machine nothing more show  say Krispy Kreme??? really didn't deliver anything extra  Portion smaller size ordered side white rice  Sorry ordered white rice stale yellow rice  Another let down!  The waitress poorly trained just don't know serve properly  I'd accept unfriendly but older lady rude side!   Ramen something appreciate quite bit  While being rather simple dish those things  only filling but emotionally hitting spot type food  Kobo prime example where business person no culinary training no culinary appreciation food deliver turns into factory money food! name quite fitting   a FACTORY! Simply place where things  No thanks kobo look place where take pride food just $$$ make! <EOR> New favorite! place very tiny come early  party 6 offered table 4  hungry didn't mind squishing  different levels spiciness choose from  mild but opinion could labeled medium run spicy   The broth really good didn't lard taste  chasu pork really good well   I definitely coming back! <EOR> How people give place decent rating? craving some late night ramen since very cold outside  came across ramen joint yelp  very surprise noodles hand made restaurant  only ordered order fast simple through phone    The lady very nice took order very professionally  came 15 minutes already ready said  ordered Tonkatsu Miso ramen  Both broth very tasteful enjoyed much  really want come back dine next time  think new spot some mouth watering ramen every night  <EOR> I love ramen fried rice here!  yummy!

also screwed spice levels others table  husband ordered mild but he said pretty spicy  friend ordered hot but turned mild side    I am giving two stars because staff attentive refilled drinks quickly took empty plates away needed  understand new still getting act together but back  drive Chinatown worth good tasting ramen! <EOR> Miso ramen medium spicy real good better nyc ramen places   Mentaiko bowl also good but much rice vs mentaiko  <EOR> Mhm! place definitely great addition Monta family  decided check restaurant based off recommendation happy did!   I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen medium spicy soft boiled egg  appetizer menu fairly limited but did offer four different ramen broths huge variety toppings $$ standard pork belly chasu bowls   Advice If you're huge meat eater order additional chasu  If want egg it  Need extra carbs? it! Your ramen bowl even additional toppings still cost less Bay Area ramen restaurant Pros Spice! Mhm  If you're looking add kick your ramen place delivers  Ground Pork super flavorful  Noodles chewy! Clean restaurant  Cons Service slow non busy time  Broth little light me  If getting Tonkotsu sort expect super creamy rich soup  Only chasu slice offered but maybe good thing  delicious but super fatty!  Overall place decent I'd come again  still prefer Monta Chaya Monta Ramen over place  two people paid $25ish tip tax  <EOR> If love Monta then there's no way Ramen Kobo  place small just Monta prepared wait  only wait 15 minutes which bad  service little none  seat take your order don't come back until ready your check    I ordered favorite which tonkatsu soft boiled egg  soup noodles point always  broth super flavorful noodles yummy  don't know if becoming trend noodle places but soft boiled egg cold precooked before hand  Am only turned off this? dunno just used freshly made most places  red ginger garlic add ramen which more flavorful    Definitely come back since close home  Try ramen spicy! tastes great both ways depending you're feeling  <EOR> An authentic local ramen bar rely all ramen needs! Being 5th visit thought due time these  usually Tonkotsu mild medium spicy depending daring am day kimchi rice Asahi    Each time visit feel welcomed never rushed  Service prompt dishes come timely manner  Most ramen bars servers new can't handle stress very well    aren't new could care less hitting bare minimum service  feel spot hits all points making pleasant experience   I give 4 stars only because prefer having freshly boiled yolk y egg but always cold ramen each time go   Anyway try yourself! <EOR> I just moved southwest side town really enjoying food options over here  Okay probably blasted but can't stand pho  Yeah every time friends hears insist just haven't tried favorite spot  Ugh   five attempts later still don't it  hesitant try ramen thinking just another name pho  Besides when think ramen think messy $ 29 packets kids love  However wasn't feeling good day decided needed some soup  looked menu seemed chance wouldn't hate it  Well found only hate but actually LOVE love Ramen KoBo  tried chicken pork just prefer chicken  add egg mine love spicy  discovered place month ago known eat twice week more  small place busy might wait  However really worth it! Also they're open late which works when forget eat dinner suddenly find 9pm  <EOR>
