When young man gave back money sandwich made wrong we didn't feel waiting another 15 minutes he didn't even give money back drink since leaving   Classy   judging responses people getting comments assume Rachel just doesn't care customers anymore   Good know! <EOR> Food 4 stars  Service 2 stars  Management 1 star  The service awful but think only because they're extremely understaffed  Why haven't managers hired more cashiers? Why does management only cashier working mornings while line piling 6 parties deep 2 people hold take out?  The cashier seemed nice but stressed friendly sure she could if she help front her     Update come back few times ordered ahead  since know takes long time wait store even then issues food preparation  finally decided talk manager she very happy help fix issues  really appreciate good management response continue eat here  <EOR> Tried Trails location first time  visit Sunday breakfast  place crowded few people ahead line but moved quickly  ordering counter food delivered your table  refreshments self serve drink while waiting food  guess kitchen backed since wait longer then expected  nice background music good coffee helped pass time  Our food delivered smile followed check satifaction Breakfast Burrito large very tasty  breakfast potatoes cubed nice hot portion larger necessary  back try lunch menu  another great choice Summerlin Village look forward supporting local business seems growing  <EOR> I heard much place check out   The people counter super friendly patient especially since first time there   During whole visit must asked doing least FIVE times   people really care!
