Great place eat away strip early some good food quiet place chat friends stay later you'll all clubbing locals   Food good just wished didn't eat much buffet time could really order only two dishes   Very cute waitress there  <EOR> re open!!! love something very loveable reopen least tell where find head chef!!!  been months since decent pot military stew!!! <EOR> They removed all patio stuff replaced them inside   Now inside outside feel without cold hopefully hit vegas soon   Love it! <EOR> I decided much consideration Whale Island primarily people stay past 2am then experience cravings Korean food more alcohol primarily summer phenomena because ever since winter hit town place seemed bit dead  However gave try during winter month because am always searching good sundubu pleasant panchan   During summer outdoor scene but case temperature 40s  For all non LVers 40 10 NYC  inside bit frightening REALLY dark seating consists picnic tables  also freezing entire time despite fact sitting inside  also place specials small pieces paper wallpapering walls decor scheme freaks because am always concerned am missing tastiest dish piece paper some corner see! experiences same paranoia Ichiza   The menu largely Korean but also Japanese style grilled sticks  sundubu good taste but eating pitch dark enjoyable  PLUS only served three little panchan! Panchan important actual soup  can't tell many times prayed restaurant gods deliver panchan bar where pay flat rate just bottomless selection treats Korean tapas    They appear very full bar bring your own carafe barley tea if 2am craving Korean more drink might really love place  I think lot reviews perspective bar happens serve food where going food  <EOR> I think emotional attachment place because cousin treated here  may shock but first time experiencing Korean Soju drink w yogurt! drinker but tried tasted just those Asian yogurt drinks  Really good stuff!   I especially remember grilled corn w mozzarella cheese  When cousin first ordered didn't understand special it  But MUST TRY!! also tried rice cakes wrapped bacon  different but tasted mediocre    When back LV probably definitely stop by  Service decent but its more nostalgia wants bring back  <EOR>
