Everything fine but nothing special  bread good salads OK  prime rib good flavor but wasn't especially great cut meat  wife's salmon left little desired fact incredibly bland she wasn't very impressed    We did very good service plus Showstopper cocktail really really good  However merely average food price feel wouldn't return especially many other fantastic places eat Wynn Encore  <EOR> Very Disappointed!!

We ordered veggie flat bread pizza very good meatball appie sent back salad steak tough leather mile high chocolate cake only ate 2 bites   waiter never came back check least 20 minutes lunch served  I'd rather spend money somewhere else! <EOR> So husband earned free meal restaurant playing slot machine decided try out  Initally when first entered place no hostess no acknowledged waited 5 minutes  Once seated took waiter 10 minutes come table  ordered appetizer food same time took 20 minutes appetizer come food took additional 20 minutes come out  When first arrived close 3pm busy  waiter never refilled drinks checked if needed anything  asking dessert menu took 10 minutes receive once asked bill took additional 10 15 minutes  People came received food service faster did  may having free meal some other reason  food actually did enjoy but don't think returning restaurant  <EOR> Came late light lunch checking Encore yesterday   Atmosphere pleasant room tastefully decorated definitely nicer more stylish typical cafe coffee shop within hotel   shared 3 items Pancakes simply delightful some best had!

Maybe 2 3PM think waitress started shift little later  sure combine rating would unfair but everything minus waitress definitely 5 stars    Other food might worth half price  decent place redeem comps stop during happy hour  <EOR> Came lunch husband both really enjoyed it!

When called reservations mentioned would celebrating friends birthday engagement  asked if wanted 14 layer chocolate cake feeds 6 could put writing it  asked if could call back added told would problem  few days asked husband call back ask cake  first didn't know he talking but eventually said would include cake   When arrived dinner service started off great  servers attentive wait food reasonable  Soon ordering checked main server cake  told ran but would someone bakery bring back something special since celebrating birthday engagement  Throughout dinner main server kept checking cake  Unfortunately some disconnect finished dinner   A few people party ordered filet mignon dinner came dessert beignets   plates cleared took F O R E V E R desserts  even ask cake again main server told coming going some kind Snickers like ice cream cake  30 minutes waiting beignets cake served  definitely Snickers like ice cream sure did feed 6  normal individual sized chocolate dessert  server did even address friend's fiance when he brought out  mean all why should fiance take part celebrating engagement?  Despite decline service lies cake food pretty good liked ambiance  <EOR> A little late ! review January year! But backtracking some places haven't reviewed while Vegas  pretty average nothing special  vegan burger fries chocolate shake  burger okay fries  Presentation cool shake great  super super friendly waitress if remember rightly tipped well she made feel really welcome  Worth visit if you're vegan holiday looking somewhere without hassle! <EOR> They did such amazing job decor! think may love fabric all over walls more food but doesn't mean food isn't great  especially love breakfast there  Overpriced? Sure but welcome Las Vegas  <EOR> Ate while waiting inside Encore Beach Club  staying hotel honestly café kinda pricey side  dont mind pricey but mind bland food slow service  just remember fries needing ketchup treat fries steak  If need A1 Heinz then isn't good if need ketchup aren't good  Nothing really stood out  <EOR> I think Society aims please female population plus health food fanatics  Things overly seasoned add salt pepper taste  Well maybe taste buds overloaded all different foods ate throughout day!  My bachlorette weekend consisted eating drinking more eating! MOH made several reservations across town but decided come because decor vegan options  Now think decor reminds something Kardashians would dig! Very plush regal girly    The service great food wasn't terrible   Since ate bunch heavy stuff during day opted salad  friend split two different versions 1 Steak Kale  Steak cooked MR perfection  only prob protein very flavorful  mix butter lettuce kale made substantial salad though  only wish vinaigrette more oomph  2 Citrus Poached Shrimp Octopus Salad salad more components which made much more interesting  jicama fennel avocado puree carrots cucumber orange lightly tossed Fennel Pink Peppercorn Vinaigrette  Bam! favorite  I try couple friend's dish overall thought okay  filet mignon lobster potatoes meatball apps all again lacking some sort seasoning    Ending high note vegan pasta excellent! Pasta = al dente  Sauce veggies tasty without tasting healthy   All all would come again breakfast lunch  <EOR> Such amazing food! southwest burger simply divine!! think best part society cafe chic nature refreshing quite all once   I impressed paid very big stickler quality nice see encore keeping true Wynn name!

Well best thing ever ate although pretty good  Perhaps would unimpressed if told expect greatness   filet eggs creamed spinach really tasty just didn't blow socks off   My review mostly based cost quality ratio aka value  know don't Society Cafe if looking value heck don't off plane McCaran Airport if you're looking value but two small breakfast entrees side fruit coffee $87  no eggs worth price   The service wasn't great ordered smoothie never delivered rarely visited table   Aka Service = Un smooth  <EOR> Mmmm good! tomato chicken noodle soup blue cheese chicken salad  presentation excellent!  service fantastic   staff attentive accommodating   loved pretzel bread sticks mustard butter!  music right volume restaurant ambiance cool loved sitting rail watching people pass come restaurant! <EOR> My husband surprised dinner very eventful day   Upon entering restaurant decked call French boudoir meets contemporary flair seated lovely comfortable booth   Service really good all evening unobtrusively attentive if sense   first thing tried pretzel basket mustard butter apparently pretty hungry those suckers gone immediately   server asked if wanted more which said 'yes ' Hey birthday! shared berry salad which full strawberries pecans definitely large enough split   entrées chose Chilean sea bass roasted Scottish salmon both which cooked perfectly   particularly enjoyed brown butter sauce encircled sea bass  creamy buttery goodness     I normally select chocolate cake dessert but pie brain because 1 pi day 2 really pie   server actually dissuaded chocolate cake because already pretty full he didn't think could fit piece into already swollen selves   He pointed cake pretty impressed  scared  could see all 7 layers 30 feet away   Thus chose apple pie which warm fruity spicy all encased buttery flaky pastry     All all experience excellent dinner lovely   would check Society's brunch compare experiences! <EOR> Ok best part dining experience because James server! He seriously made dinner way more memorable  He passionate food heck pretty much ordered everything he suggested! wasn't really hungry ordered Truffled Baked Potato Tomato Bisque soup   MMmmmMMMM!!!! yummy! best friend ordered fried mac cheese bites sooo good course truffled cream came Can't tell love truffled cream? pretty much dipped everything into cream haha! other best friend ordered sweet potatoes which excellent 3 things salad which wasn't impressed she also ordered some kind pigs blanket dish didn't try  rest group ordered some kind meat dish loooked good  would definitely come back again but time order more food! PS dont' chocolate shot! There's no alcohol nor menu he made because he knew pooped wanted party all night   It made stomach worse! Nice try James <EOR> I waffled between three four stars Society  good most restaurants Wynn but oddly found meal somewhat forgettable  fact struggling remember exactly only short week later  me   The atmosphere lovely better half loved decor lot more she rest Wynn  Service prompt efficient came smile   And food  Now remembering     8 oz filet mignon  lot fillets life certainly worst but without sort flare shizzle expect $38 entree  probably should asked if béarnaise sauce bad     but something would really popped otherwise ho hum dish  <EOR> We last night $39 prix fixe Thanksgiving dinner  Made reservation 7pm but early wait bit   The prix fixe dinner Kabocha Squash Soup Slow Roasted Free Range Turkey pancetta sage stuffing mashed potato root vegetables cranberry compote  included dessert would pumpkin tart but ran out  Instead offered donut bites which felt oddly unequal promised pumpkin tart skipped it   The soup very creamy delicious  along soup given some pretzel bites some kind mustard butter tasted fantastic  turkey tasted good but wasn't enough gravy    To disappointment restaurant sits right next casino floor  pictures site atmosphere look much more secluded interesting  Unfortunately still hear all slot machines beeping dinging away isn't most pleasant dining experience   So food good but overall experience wasn't great  If want dinner special occasion elsewhere  <EOR> As soon sat server brought complimentary appetizers sliced carrots fresh herb dip warm mini pretzel bread mustard dip created relaxing but elegant vibe cafe looks onto luxe read 2 8 billion dollar casino setting   Society open just week but staff held own against full house   entrees  baked cod clam sauce wife braised short ribs  executed perfectly if slowly     Finally prices  again given red chandelier gilded backdrop  surprisingly modest  <EOR> ordered sliders    inside purple  Caesar salad nothing write home about  but pretzel sticks yummy  <EOR> How convenient ive craving some spaghetti meatballs  Unfortunately couldnt into pool party because tix sold encore  decided best! Eat! Eat!

Perfectly balanced rock shrimp incredible! try this!  Lobster Roll Club Quite good  Nothing write home but very satisfying lunch item tasty fresh    DINNER  Braised Pork Shank sauce somewhat tasty but wasn't best meal ever   Surf Turf Sadly uninteresting  filet dry  nearly inedible    DESSERT  Cheesecake Nearly best thing ever tasted life  Purely exquisite  saving grace entire restaurant   Chocolate Cake Delicious    enormous! Four people could comfortably share slice monstrosity!   CONCLUSION  Generally speaking worth price but lunch good enough recommend  Try tagliatelle lobster roll cheesecake truly wonderful meal  <EOR> The service great   food good 'tho portions per pricing tad lackluster bang buck quantity quality   I lunch special fixed price 3 course which tasty but approx $25 bit fulfilling terms appeasing appetite filled hunger satisfied full belly compared same money could gotten elsewhere like Wynn Buffet Lunch roughly same price  AYCE drinks appetizers soups salads entrees deserts It's reliable place pretzel bread sticks delicious   nice decor   I'd rank * * * Three Stars A OKAY which I'd recommend come back to   necessarily place I'd crave think must return place but also place where I'd revisit if others wanted timing opportunity right   There's lot great dining options Encore Wynn however too   I think if upped portion sized left pricing would lot more fulfilling satisfying desirable crave  <EOR> A group girls came dinner part package bachelorette celebration place best menu options 3 choices given  wasn't expecting much but place really surprised me! food very delicious service pretty good all great time dining would definitely want come back try regular menu again future  <EOR> This restaurant worst food ever eaten Vegas   Not sure if other reviewers place fake drunk properly assess food here   Sandwiches awful taste cardboard mixed garbage mayo it   Fresh fruit dessert only thing tasted normal   Fuck! <EOR> The food ok  won't find anything particularly remember fondly but quick casual relatively cheaper alternative everything else encore  Unlike food decor actually very interesting cook <EOR> They won over baked macaroni cheese bites   cool decoration   fact XS early stamp kill some time drinking snacking until really want sans hassle getting back club  <EOR> High Society  After reading all restaurants grace Encore property pretty much set stopping trendy cafe during next Vegas visit!

No but that  Definitely hidden winner  wouldn't visit Vegas without having meal here  <EOR> This place cheap shouldn't expect be  Once walk into Wynn Encore should expect pay some $$$ anything want    The warm pretzel sticks dijon mustard start amazing  even asked them pack some take home did smiling face    I Society number different times never disappoints  most memorable meal Kobe Beef Pastrami Sandwich  $20 but would gladly pay $22 it! yourself favor order decadent delicious heart clogging savory buttery treat when there  <EOR> Despite deceptively ordinary moniker Grilled Chicken Salad discovered surprising explosion flavors interesting combination fresh ingredients albeit PRICE! LEER Muy Caro Señor! Had few business meetings Wynn Encore afterward decided catch lunch rather fight cafeteria crowds back convention center   bit early waitress gave breakfast menus  but all wanted salads   and some time work through lunch   lucky gave table just big enough break laptops work while ate   Definitely most efficient although no free WiFi available time   We eventually lunch menus but shocked pricing   $18 grilled chicken salad?  kidding me?    Health conscious prevailed decided ahead chicken salad glad did   darn good grilled chicken salad   mix flavors textures quite entertaining   figs sesame seeds cranberries pears sea salt fresh crushed pepper perfectly seasoned pomegranate vinaigrette emulsion dressing   Oh grilled chicken tasted real farm fresh grilled chicken   finally getting chance eat see Padma Lakshmi peeps Top Chef tasting     Wrapped better average coffee   Paid bill   Laptop suspend mode   and then trek back convention center another meeting    <EOR> Eh bad  some reason never really remember anything eat Vegas very much detail and *think* actually sober during meal haha but sure if anything stuck would remembered it  burger wasn't bad nothing spectacular  thought little ketchup bottles give fries cute touch  favorite? mac n cheese bites  pretty much love mac n cheese any way shape form deep fried bite sized pieces heaven  truffle oil dipping sauce? Even better! <EOR> Your options pretty limited breakfast food if you're staying Encore  basically lobby bar grab breakfast sandwiches pastries coffee   night drinking group wanted little more substantial eat eggs heartier dishes looking something little healthy since bathing suit rest afternoon planned drink lunch alcohol   This place seemed bit overpriced but again Vegas  If you're going pay $18 drink you're likely going also pay $18 plate eggs salad especially if you're Encore   In true Vegas fashion wait line 10 15 min place plenty empty tables only half full  If there's line must off the charts right?  They brunch menu weekends but if want salads sandwiches 11 30 am request lunch menu they automatically bring you The warm pretzel breadsticks mustard butter highlight meal  could eaten 10 them fresh soft fluffy delicious alone would coming back just eat pretzel bread  server nice enough bring extra serving since first disappeared minute hit table comes 6 pieces I ordered Superfood Salad kale quinoa salad $17  probably cost them $3 salad  salad probably enough kale leaves could count 2 hands  more pile quinoa sweet potatoes cranberries almonds pomegranate seeds  healthy relatively filling but certainly worth $17  But wasn't expecting blown water salad but far better salads way more greens cheaper  even Vegas  If really want salad don't mind walking 5 10 min head Grand Lux Palazzo something half price more lettuce greens   My friend did steak eggs sliders which definitely gave food envy savory biscuit came looked delicious he did dish   Expect pay $18 20 brunch dish pre tax tip ton food  If you're looking something slightly cheaper more substantial head Grand Lux Cafe next door  But if you're okay spending little more money convenience not that inventive food delicious warm just out of the oven pretzel breadsticks place do  <EOR> 2nd restaurant tried Encore again much salt  specialty burger ceasar chicken wings  Why much salt? couldn't taste meat? Very limited beer selection  Only reason 3 stars service  <EOR> I came lunch prix fixe menu society chopped salad chicken club donuts  staff very attentive since don't cinnamon offered substitute regular doughnuts   The dishes very fresh although choices weren't crazy Society Cafe Encore provided simple food executed very well   I would definitely recommend place lunch Vegas  <EOR> 3 stars food but extra star exceptional service  Let's start food   Mix Trio Salad good  cesars which just ok fruit nut really good appetizing forgot third one   Overall good experience   My entree Pulled Pork Sandwich  Says comes slaw thought side but stacked top sandwich   So allergic carrots started pulling slaw think waiters overheard came over tell would happy another sandwich w slaw   That exceptional service!!! <EOR> After failing few places wandered Society Cafe pretty decent find  think bit overrated though   They pretzel bread sticks give your meal  pretty good nice deviation typical bread  But outrageous any means   I tomato bisque which near perfect  would give soup 5 stars   I Lobster roll which came old bay chips  lobster roll tasty addition avocado bacon pieces real nice  But $24 bit smallish  would liked more money   The old bay chips good but just chips  <EOR> This place great breakfast lunch dinner  actually chopped salad EVERY day good    I highly recommend blood orange mimosas breakfast them table side!

For meal American Kobe Beef Hamburger  never kobe beef before really wasn't quite sure big deal was  Maybe because hamburger bun little dry but just wasn't impressed  fries good though  Overall food decent but would try something different if back    Basically only thing really stood place awesome decor otherwise don't see rated best new restaurants America 2009  Must many opening recession! <EOR> 3 5 stars  Service good    They give mini pretzel bread good butter    My burger moist   The meatballs weren't bad    Corn soup delish   Overall good but nothing wow  <EOR> Sloppy Joes Sliders!!!!

All did extra push your chair fold your napkin when stepped away table  don't think everyone paying additional fee table justifies all! first restaurant charges fee top your gratuity  Another thing didn't when ordered Redbull vodka waiter suggested I'd just order vodka shot he'd bring Redbull side chaser since Redbull vodka cocktail didn't much vodka it  thought nice suggest he looking best interests little did know he suggested could charged more! Redbull $5 50 top vodka shot no thank you! felt he should told front ordering two separate drink items instead making sound he doing some kind favor  guess money back afford high over head costs fancy hotel! Boo 2 5 stars only please! <EOR> Great restaurant inside Encore casino   Reservations needed fairly quick service   dinner around 9pm Saturday night only waited few minutes table   also breakfast 9am Sunday morning reservation steady but insanely packed   decor bright trendy good vibe     Now onto food      On first visit vegan tomato bisque appetizer it fantastic!  shocked vegan but still creamy!  entree Wynn burger fries raspberry sorbet   burger good Gardein beef patty vegan cheese all typical burger toppings side fries   Very tasty easy wallet   Usually comes shake but don't chocolate server offered sorbet instead   it great!  burger fries shake meal only $11!  soup total little over $22 but  cheap Vegas meal!    Onto breakfast next day     I started green juice $10   big green juice fan $10 fresh juice didn't seem bad   Well where Society gets knocked down star   saw bartender pour glass big plastic jug under bar   $10 glass think should fresh pressed!!    For entree Florentine Tofu Benedict   really good healthy option well   great smokey flavor really enjoyed it   came cucumber salad side which okay but think side fresh fruit would better choice   juice Benedict total $28 before tip   little pricy due juice situation but still pleased  <EOR>
