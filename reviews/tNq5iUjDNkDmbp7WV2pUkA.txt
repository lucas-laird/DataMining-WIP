This first sushi burrito taste really good just bigger sushi roll fish fresh wrap sushi rice seaweed paper really new style sushi <EOR> Tried place first time impressed other sushi burrito places nearby  served less protein more money fresh  however better appetizers good price point! <EOR> Pretty disappointed originally way chipotle but saw sushi burrito stop by  ordered Tropicana sushi burrito very bland no flavor what's ever   little bit shrimp couple avocado slices some mango pieces  More rice then anything  paid 10 55 burrito satisfying ALL  <EOR> First time here  Came 30 minutes before closing  Friendly staff  Ordered create your own burrito chicken teriyaki bowl  Can't wait try more items menu  <EOR> If enjoy bowl  mush place there's no pieces fish just paste looks spread  happy  <EOR> Visited twice leaning toward meh  staff polite location clean  staff also awkwardly quiet location completely bare décor limited evening lighting  But restaurant those things aren't important   The food kind dicey too  Originally ordered Dynamite sushi burrito $12 belatedly realizing deep fried  mistake but held hope would good least interesting but there's reason why none other places town warms fish point half cooked which totally unappealing  wasted meal   Returned regular sushi burrito  Menu limited premade combos you'll probably DIY  Prices higher similar concepts around town  Fish freshness okay but underwhelmed  stick spot across street  <EOR> By far place gets concept Sushi Burrito   freshest ample amount choices   Feels set real sushi restaurant   Found actual well established sushi restaurant did open place   felt money way further place across street  Overall superior experience place right across street  <EOR> Don't waste your $  Skimpy protein scoops wasabi packages no flavor heat limited sauces hardly any veggies choose from  Staff OK  Prefer Sweet Poke hands down  <EOR> Fast super yum!  Dine orders free cup miso soup which adds nice touch experience    add pretty much all mix ins want no additional charge   Ive seen other sushi burito places pack burito much rice but here   use just right amount rice taste all other stuff your burito   Love place! <EOR> I'm sucker good poke bowl  Man  always hits spot  give four stars because QUALITY food could bit better  rice bit stale spicy mayo bit runny which made rice soggy so guess  good thing? lol   BUT  just something happen sometimes  don't take away deliciousness encountered here  especially create your own bowl prices proteins aren't bad  girl helped us   didn't catch name but some brunette girl seemed new   she really nice patient because indecisive need food just RIGHT  would definitely stop again another bowl  think next time try sushi burrito! <EOR> Tried place first time  Seemed pretty clean but never know  Definitely smelled better poke addiction across way  give miso soup eating but pretty sure tofu seaweed sitting soup  I'd rather them separate until ready serve tofu super hot  suggestions very creative but add whatever want  give mediocre review now  When back maybe update  <EOR> I love sushi burritos!! There's many sushi burrito places near but love Bonsai much happy finally opened  always Vegas sushi burrito deep fried dynamite burrito  protein use burritos fresh rice sticky  10 10 would recommend friend  <EOR> So place realize some fantastic poke places town  remain competitive  service great staff nice informative  Hence reason adding another star  really food  love poke sushi burritos but first time just couldn't eat it  can't pin point exactly sauce? lack fish? sure all know couldn't taste fish  staff really nice hope figure issue food because gonna undermine staffs work there  Also prices bit high amount fish quality  <EOR> First time here  Fast friendly service  BYO Bowl 2 portions protein 3 oz each 6 oz    Tuna white rice spicy chili sauce corn scallions mango edamame carrots sweet onions avocado all spice toppings  bowl very deep very reasonably priced 10 75  Dine receive free Miso soup  Prior customer sushi burrito looked really good  Store dining condiment area very clean prep area  Friendly staff  bowl tasty excellent! return very close house  <EOR> As Midwest guy really likes sushi daughter try sushi burrito   ordered Las Vegas burrito Ocean Poke bowl  Surprisingly burrito good even though deep fried  If any complaint maybe much cream cheese but overall good  Ocean Pole bowl outstanding  Generous amounts salmon tuna  Really good choice! <EOR> Amazing!!! Let pick ALL your toppings very good price! Salmon Spicy Sushirito  mouth happy   Mom Pop shop NEED keep business  Very clean very friendly a must try! <EOR> Very small portions yet prices higher all other sushi burrito places to  staff often hardly speaks  Taste alright but would much rather eat somewhere else more worth it  <EOR> It's no good yourself favor just across street   selection sub par combos don't really work well together price doesn't match quality much less quantity comparison other places and    Dey kant event spel masago correcsies   See annoying is?   Not 1 star because didn't sick give miso soup unlike most  places  made custom bowl tuna salmon  <EOR> I nothing bad say place  simple clean good  inside isn't fancy but food keeps coming back  staff usually same young man woman sometimes third guy cooks  They're very polite give good portion food  sushi burritos come free cup miso soup  someone can't eat gluten took lot time first visit see can't have  spicy mayo good would stay away other sauces if you're also avoiding gluten  miso good also  Overall really happy place exists  <EOR> For sushi burrito solid 4!  Lots choices good portion even some tasty miso side   Where place gets clipped vibe messiness    place no personality actually made feel pretty depressed bare walls basic white tables clumped together no feeling love passion food let alone fun    Also things seemed somewhat disorganized little messy but clean    When dealing raw fish want clean organized   wife scared order opted plain bowl rice   little TLC really help place move ahead  <EOR> This place could definitely use manager strong marketing skills  While food staff enjoyable nothing stands place demands multiple trips  could see myself craving food here  custom bowl sushi rice  4 proteins everything tastes great  owner even way bring extra sauces weren't even menu  hope correct lackluster atmosphere  <EOR> I work near excited give place try  resturant very clean staff friendly  burrito though pretty eh  very little flavor  fish little fishy  whole 30 min lunch burrito only person ahead me  want try again update review  now though am very unimpressed  <EOR> came ordered within 3 minutes food ready  awesome taste  great quick service  ordered #7 red dragon  back sure  <EOR> This first time come place amazed all factors great restaurant food service quality organized etc   I highly recommend spot  <EOR> I giant sushi rolls called sushi burritos   liked fried oysters too   However restaurant does stand any way cannot give 4    service ok menu ok ambiance ok   Prices decent make your own option   miso soup favorite part   need jazz place more  <EOR> Stopped check place other day gf waiting forever then finally open up  red dragon *huge* very yummy  place bit barren moment decor wise but you're going eat stare walls right?
