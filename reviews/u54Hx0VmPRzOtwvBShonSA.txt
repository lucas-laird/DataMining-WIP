Tropicana inside shell gas station  My lunch started 12 00pm arrived location 12 05pm sitting inside truck drive through 20 minutes now 12 25pm slowest most pathetic service ever encountered  then decided leave drive thru park truck inside find five people waiting line only person making sandwiches joke never again <EOR> We way hike Red Rock Canyon  figured would grab some sandwiches little picnic while there  intrigued drive thru option figured would give try  Big mistake! soon pulled menu girl's voice came over loudspeaker informed she would right us  5 minutes waiting guy's voice came said would helped shortly  5 more minutes sitting outside waiting order done  pulled left  down street different Subway 3 4 more immediate area quickly  returning one  <EOR> Had gift card 25 dollars freind subway he ordered steak sandwich ordered meatball footlong steak footlong ok but meatball awful look pics bread sandwich <EOR> This odd Subway gas station combo   two businesses run separately which confusing when want purchases both    The staff Subway counter probably friendliest most attentive seen any Subway I'm weekly customer locations all over country    Food spot fresh expected brand  I only wish could purchase convince store items Subway purchase  <EOR> They're open 24 hours  plus  neighborhood great would recommend coming wee hours morning  small subway regulation size generally only person working counter  course hassle when gets more person waiting line  Overall good can't wrong Subway  <EOR> One worst Subway locations ever to  every occasion they've ingredients also apparently hospitality  No worker come across friendly helpful  Take advice different location even different competitor! <EOR> Open til 2am totally don't hold back goods  nice even tho past 1am which awesome part since most people late aren't always best moods  But pretty happy served  doesn't take much keep girl satisfied! Lol <EOR> Long story short today final straw location even though closest work convenient drive thru  always place order online pick quickly once quick year coming location  example today took 20 minutes 2 times through drive thru just sandwich ready pick 10 minutes prior arrival  even tried going inside when more time service extremely slow  never packed even busy just disappear back try extreme kindness smiles EVERY TIME  Very frustrating when give them benefit doubt whole year nothing ever changes except gets worse  <EOR> This Subway drive thru which thought AWESOME until opened sandwich work  smashed poorly put together veggies everywhere soggy  disgusting  Subway streak almost week sandwich put dead stop  couldn't eat Subway another month  Bottom line watch person physically your sandwich because otherwise something completely inedible  <EOR> Once learned open until 7am then everything seemingly better  never found girl told hold never seen girl working there    However key success location going through drive thru but instead going inside gas station going counter   Service good steady fast last few visits  <EOR>
