Cheap drinks  Always dim  Video poker if your date boring  if boring  Spacious booths  Pool table upstairs  Framed photos Marilyn Monroe shit    Many friends mine spent full days here  probably guilty same crime but uh day drinking around corner apartment ok? Don't judge Yelp   When bar isn't bar always kind sad inside secretly  seriously consider moving back Las Vegas just Stakeout  would trade every last stone cold hot tall hipster idiot dude brooklyn ALL dress better btw Stakeout NY  Because although fine lads commute much more visually stimulating can't hold damn flame Nevada's hidden gems  <EOR> Good affordable food  Nice place enjoy some food play pool friends    Another restaurant would enjoy more if wasn't filled smoke  <EOR> My friends frequent place took drunk bus full co workers finally here  Damn it! missing out!
