I saw great review assumed nice cheap Mexican restaurant      But since knew restaurant connected wit strip club  knew restaurant kinda pricy Las Vegas style restaurant       I atmosphere !!  When see menu  kinda expensive     thought   But hungry      So order melt cheese appetizer    And 2 entree dinner plate       After ate big cheese oily appetizer    Our stomach almost full      taste good tho ! And 2 very huge dinner plate coming !!   We could finish nothing      !  We only lil bit     Almost took home   And bill over $100 including drinks We paid $100 plus tip but couldn't eat lot     Mexican food oily heavy       We learn still place      But next time mayb jus 1 appetizer 1 dinner plate     Mayb 1 drink each      enough     !   Too much wasting food wasting money     <EOR> Pretty difficult find if your first time aware attached Sapphire strip club  drive into strip club parking lot see it  drove around few times looking entrance no road signs any indicators restaurant visible street night    Overall think mediocre Mexican food you're really paying ambiance atmosphere which nice  If haven't really authentic Mexican might impressed but living San Diego just miles border abundance place doesn't hold candle many back home    I street tacos al pastor  3 small white corn tortillas  pork pretty bland sprinkled cilantro finely diced pineapples  okay but could find much better street vendor SoCal half price  also came side black pinto beans rice  rice joke  sure they're going but no influence Mexican flavoring whatsoever  Usually expect characteristic red orange tomatoey rice Mexican food  just plain bland white rice  Black beans also lacking any flavor if came straight can  also beef enchiladas  little better  shredded beef little dried if moist succulent would've made dish  Enchiladas expected pretty good kick spicy red sauce    As far service thought general manager seemed very nice but waitress seemed insincere if she wanted somewhere else  quiet night seated immediately but given few people think food shouldn't taken long come out    Anyway summary less impressed quality food such highly reviewed place Yelp  very few times Yelp gotten wrong me  ambiance atmosphere nice but food same standard  open minded enough consider maybe fact Sunday night hence best staff  maybe ordered  regular menu tacos enchiladas maybe specialities lot better? way place failed come close expectations   DISCLAIMER I'd probably give place 3 5 but feel overall rating misleadingly giving less star try even distribution  <EOR> This pleasant surprise  organic Mexican restaurant open 24 hours good!!!

Food delicious service 5 Star sure come back next time come Vegas!! <EOR> While wouldn't say common occurrence times when experience restaurant just complete opposite Yelp consensus but sure  ever case degree  El Dorado Cantina comes prestigious #28 year's Yelp Top 100 but experience during Saturday dinner  routinely eclipsed both contemporary traditional Mexican restaurants across country     Star 1 service atmosphere?  If you're already aware El Dorado Cantina shares building Sapphire world's largest strip club   all strike against restaurant but just something aware of    Once you're inside atmosphere service El Dorado both excellent attentive servers bring food quickly  Star Granted    Star 2 portions relative cost?  So things started bit off  downing some mediocre margaritas reviewed menu bit surprised find order three street tacos came $12 00 $4 00 each  any standard expensive street tacos which even sit down spots often run no more $2 50 Dallas Los Angeles elsewhere Las Vegas  think might better understand price point if El Dorado Strip but aren't end day still pretty basic normally portioned street tacos   simply expensive price point  No Star Granted     Stars 3 4 food?  I opted three street tacos carnitas pastor carne asada  All three good but none three great  meats clearly high quality peripheral onions cilantro well portioned but tortillas flour didn't taste fresh elsewhere lack salsa options accompany trio  cheaper larger think I'd different opinion but given neither only define tacos having 'okay'  Single Star Granted    Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  Maybe spending past four years Dallas permanently skewed view good tacos should taste cost but honestly just confused why dinner experience such contrast Yelp's consensus  now better Mexican options Vegas opinion  No Star Granted  <EOR> Came late night happy hour served 12 2am  All food great free chips salsa ordered beef empanadas street tacos wings  Service provided Kai also great friendly attentive quick  Would recommend others back  <EOR> TL DR Yum! Great Mexican food delicious free salsas chips start free flan checkin  loved big portions you'll laugh fact connected strip club   After eating mediocre hotel food lacking vegetarian options friends found spot Yelp made way over  told short staffed but did best give fair warning food fast could  hardly noticed delay   Food Chips salsa start delicious give two types salsa both very fresh house made  veggie bowl brown rice black beans checked flan  Another friend also veggie bowl but refried beans black beans loved it  thought very good but heavy rice therefore almost filling  If rice halved would still great bowl less food baby inducing  Guac extremely fresh but bowl skimps little veggies  full finish flan but  also great creamy smooth     Atmosphere Next sapphire strip club  can't tell once you're inside restaurant though  restaurant dark feels much more upscale other Mexican spots to  Servers friendly helpful pretty accommodating  <EOR> The best food Vegas! Enrique server best! Food great but service best part  cochinita pibil Mexican hamburger grilled pineapple everything great tasting highly recommend place  <EOR> As someone generally content most food Mexican food hardest things enjoy having high expectations  Coming into restaurant opens very soft lighting which very nice but only thought when comes food  all years alive best Mexican food ever aside mother's  presentation taste place exceeded all checklist  truly expresses spirit Latino cuisines every way possible  place whenever possible  <EOR> This place must Mexican food! service amazing food    so fresh delicious  top its non GMO organic  met executive chef he really sweetest man passionate serving great product  Check out! <EOR> Definitely enjoyed food here    little bit problem mixed plates some entrees taking much longer others but end made great service extra attention during dessert time   really liked Carne Asada plate which also came grilled cactus delicious  dessert great flan churros yummy   location little funny being next gentleman's club scary dude crying something parking lot but security guard there   24 hours   Also heard locals discounts mondays  plus book! <EOR> Check happy hour 4 6 midnight 2! $5 food specials margaritas! ordered tostaditas buffalo wings  bartenders name Tiffany she amazing! happy stumbled upon place  <EOR> Been happy hour 4 pm 6pm 25% off locals Monday    Enjoyed 2$ tacos 5$ margaritas   The bartenders Andrew Omar super nice  We definitely come back food great service excellent   <EOR> GO OFF STRIP!!

Tip Happy Hour daily street tacos $2 50 Margaritas $5 Non Flavored when sit bar only    We initially sat booth until noticed everything wanted eat significantly cheaper bar  Street Tacos way here! Especially carne asada!   My only gripe flavored Margaritas   while good adding additional $2 per serving pitcher margaritas bit absurd No matter many people drinking pitcher charged 4 servings  caused $32 pitcher ultimately $40  live NYC understand things but honestly $8 additional charge flavoring bogus best! Especially since flavoring done artificially fresh fruit purée  Also waaaaaaay much ice served pitcher  all said fix margarita issue you'll great find   off strip! <EOR> Kinda hard find because shares Gentlemans Club bldg but worth seeking out  shared platter tacos  enjoyed carnitas chicken best  Flavorful juicy pork cilantro avocado sauce!!

Erica fantastic server she very busy but still gave great service! <EOR> We came Tuesday July 19th early lunch  pleasantly surprised when entered posh decor  really liked feel place could imagine having even cooler vibe night  specifically came Tuesday taco specials  waited server let know Taco Tuesday specials when she didn't just asked drink order asked specials available server quoted incorrect price  When questioned she said she wasn't sure but she would check  Upon lengthy return she did correct herself but still never mentioned any drink specials  Later found did special margaritas known would ordered 2 loss chips trio salsa served free pretty good  red favorite  green tomatillo nothing special even borderline flavorless  pink way spicy  couldn't taste anything but heat which enjoyable me  tacos ordered smaller expected especially $3 50 but filled lots meat  ordered two carne asada cochinita  liked them both but thought cochinita better flavor fantastic  Although pretty full did take advantage free flan Yelp check in  Both huge fans flan but figured didn't anything lose  happy chance try because best flan ever had! Chef Paco delivered directly table himself  nice touch  think would much better experience service lacking  beg refills when could find her  don't know exactly issue because only tables first half meal  large party going back room don't know if she more concerned them what  definitely visit again when town since many things would try menu  just hope service much better  <EOR> This favorite place!!!!

Service OK  everyone friendly helpful but waitress did fudge friend's order twice  Minor stuff friend did even bring no harm no foul  I'm only docking star because chip situation  bring basket chips some salsa when seated but then waitress gives weird legal disclaimer type spiel first basket house but additional baskets $3 50 each something that  thought kinda miserly  $5 taco ya can't throw some friggin' tortilla chips? fact announce very beginning your experience kinda creates awkward vibe   Other GREAT place back sure!! <EOR> YUMSTERS!!!

Delicious though but lacking much sauce side salad tasteless thought seemed superfluous  Why bother?  After waiting seemed ages entree served husband's steak fajita platter  Gradually rest group served but husband point didn't bring corn tortilla option he'd selected  all sat waited those come because weren't going eat front him  Maybe five minutes later tortillas arrived started eating   I'm enchilada aficionado  Although espouse use fancy organic ingredients neither variety ordered any great shakes spicy taste I spice   didn't care refried beans nor cilantro rice both bland    For ten minutes waited server come back ask those enchiladas needed sour cream   Finally flagged server down    The worst part having plates cleared some while others finished eating done this?   felt took girlfriends plate away before she was!  After all plates cleared comes ghostly waitress again  Trying order dessert  didn't seem cared experience all things inconsistent spotty really very good all  Would recommend  C <EOR> Oh various Gods! place just Vegas needed Mexican restaurant authentic Mexican food while same time taking gastronomical risks!   I know place isn't going everybody  also know takes certain type person walk towards blue neon Sapphire 2 AM Mexican food  unassuming entrance gives way modern dining room bar  well lit yet there's abundance velvet mirrors knowledge going other side wall give El Dorado its distinct Vegas y vibe    isn't place children order quesadillas while parents drink margaritas!  There crickets menu    Delicious spicy crickets  should order them  You'll better person it    They also serve Ghost Pepper salsa  should only order if you're ready  flavor amazing but heat serious lasting! If you're sure just start off slow see much heat take if habanero salsa gave chips when first sat down scared then don't order ghost pepper salsa!    salsa most wonderful things ever if you're type enjoys flavor pain highly recommend salsa!  There course many traditional items menu you'll recognize love fresh guacamole tacos burritos enchiladas    But also selection mole`  place special  tried sampler plate found each them unique enjoyable own way  personal favorite being darker chocolate based mole`   El Dorado Cantina kind place beginning end night drinking refuge neon sanctuary boring Americanized Mexican food  <EOR> this place INCREDIBLE! ive plenty hispanic food restaurants ones far favorite! carnitas burrito fried ice cream burrito made fresh ingredients could taste top quality the pork juicy tortilla soft crispy came cilantro rice buttered perfectly along yellow blue tortilla chips red green salsa appetizer fried ice cream very sweet crunchy all nuts  best part? everythings fully organic theyre open 24 7! its little pricier normal but its definitely worth it! ill definitely back future reccomend them friends! <EOR> We almost missed place  little hidden behind trees next strip joint  But once service great  Food fantastic!

Probably didn't need more food but since birthday splurging  I ordered seafood enchiladas which Pacific wild shrimp bay scallops Mahi  sauce bit spicy side but know just wimp when comes spice!

Our waiter Joaquin I believe right spelling extremely friendly more happy answer any questions things Vegas  Found town EDC shared same interests good time chatting during dinner  Quick friendly service    I definitely return recommend place highly! <EOR> My last outing fine whole but some discordant notes     Tableside Guac very good but noticeably salty while Albondigas Soup excellent savory meatballs standing hot vegetable oriented broth   Although Imperial Shrimp wrapped bacon lightly fried good starter believe dish would taste better without fish stuffing     My main slow cooked Carnitas Rajas Burrito packed marinated pork Cilantro Rice roasted peppers Refried Beans fresh Guacamole Mexican blend three cheeses Avocado Salsa warm Flour Tortilla featured tender carnitas both filling satisfying   But would liked more Pico de Gallo saucier burrito   mound Cilantro Rice side outside burrito seemed superfluous     Seating comfortable but heavy server presence waiters attended table kept switching    meal's end ask two different servers check men's restroom messy   Nevertheless because food noticeably fresh clean composed high quality ingredients available 24 hours El Dorado Cantina asset Las Vegas Mexican cuisine dining scene worth another look   3 1 2 Stars overall visit  <EOR> Everyone mother told try spot out  Located next Sapphire strip club Mexican food place open 24 hours day probably accommodate strip club crowd  enjoyed interior place  However prices bit steep  understand use organic non GMO ingredients but geez those price hikes unreal  Anyways ended getting tacos  al pastor carnitas wasn't impressed  Coming California know good tacos definitely say those tacos shouldn't worth 13 bucks  terrible but weren't great either  However redeeming factor free flans through Yelp check in  Everyone agreed flan some best flan ever had  Overall unless you're looking epic flan then would suggest going Tacos El Gordo some delicious tacos won't burn whole your wallet  <EOR> Chef Paco offers authentic Mexican cuisine great atmosphere although loud sometimes   located right next sapphire may may see some extra eye candy   guacamole made table side outstanding  if could give 4 5 stars would whenever short staff always excuse server bartender come serve you  don't excuses hire more phuckin people don't wait  complimentary nachos salsa good touch habanero pretty good  bonus points location but would recommend heading next door ladies probably wont appreciate your heavenly bombs during lap dance  <EOR> The food good  am very disappointed service received  husband lunch yesterday 7 year old daughters ordered kids menu told come churro when bill bit high  Unfortunately husband given card but realized late he charged all adult plates  Then he asked if we'd town few days said be  Gave two free sodas if would it  bill little over $100 dollars two adults two children  girls tiny  Can't justify charge  feel taken advantage ripped off  <EOR> What place goodness other day just $1 tacos treat little beggeing f         food no silverware no salt no pepper very small glass water best best bartender drinks especially he made mojitos using  HOT SAUCE BOTTLE  to crush ice mints leaves     no even  pre bussing second plate table      Wow    Ps more employees  guess     Well taco  good cheap     lol <EOR> Not best Mexican food service  seated right away but then server took forever take drink order  People right next seated great server attentive unlike us  flan best  Food non gmo which great but authentic Mexican more Americanize <EOR> I mole enchiladas which traditional non sweetened slightly bitter taste  tacos al pastor husband ok  Meat slightly old overcooked  came off time during lunch  rice free flan Yelp good though!

Hopefully things gotten better place late night long day work just date but last couple experiences didn't justify high prices    Basically everything menu great but some best fajitas chorizo appetizer steak bowl forgot actual name cheese enchiladas corn any burrito green sauce top any tacos  If pick just I'd suggest steak bowl single person fajitas share someone else  sure order side corn well  <EOR> Great Food organic fresh tasty delish! <EOR> I could tell detail why only 3 stars but am mood blast them because could some damage  All say food point most point  always vouch pozole  pretty good fajitas steak bowls    Service other hand  Management needs step scheduling game  Having 2 servers handle restaurant during lunch rush hour really retarded  bartender serving tables well which led servers making own drinks  Having food show before drinks waiting over 10 mins chips salsa just awful  Server nice apologetic but only far   Please work I'd really love give another star    <EOR> Don't believe reviews   place terrible   don't know if great ratings because Vegas Organic sales pitch but even worth trying   food lacked taste totally overpriced salsa weak brought tiny bowl chips 1 3 full whole party told them needed more chips   When bill charged additional chips   overpriced but cheap give service wasn't any good tasteless   Pass! <EOR> Tacos cochinitos Flan amazing ! Customer service great  Definitely coming back  <EOR> The best thing place shares parking lot large Strip Club ask Siri directions she tell arrived Sapphire Gentlemen's Club    Anyway reviews seem pretty accurate so so service good food  service lacking wasn't even busy however waitress well meaning nice    The food pretty good  Aguachiles okay  served martini glass unfortunately flavors accumulate bottom instead shrimp  huevos rancheros very good too    A note authenticity food  rice just white rice some cilantro  salsa all very good  finally use queso fresco yellow cheese some Mexican restaurants use    Not worth cab ride strip  <EOR> Erika awesome server   All staff super friendly  torta de carnitas yummy huge   definitely come again try more menu  <EOR> Compliments chef! place amazing!
