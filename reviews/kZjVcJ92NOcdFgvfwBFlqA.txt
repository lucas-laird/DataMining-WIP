The only reason didn't give 5 stars  sound weak venue supposedly part owned Dave Navarro  would expect great sound  less impressive   soundboard behind stage  sure genius thought since  can't hear correctly  adjust sound if behind stage   only thing keeping 5 star review  am hoping fix sound update review 5 stars  <EOR> Definitely expecting every way possible  Usually don't bars but friend's cousin's band Otherwise playing night she invited friends come down watch them perform  band itself good but supposed reviewing Black Door right?   The Black Door your typical bar  Sure bar back complete drinks bar food but everything else place isn't any dive bars to  First off don't judge book its cover  While outside Black Door nothing special surprised nice inside  Comfy lounge chairs VIP tables mini chandeliers mirrors   I confused   is bar nightclub minus rude bouncers dress code ? While interior nice didn't appreciate some videos playing flat screens  think saw more body parts wanted to   it nice wish could changed channel something  those little conservative side don't watch videos  Anyways didn't drink eat anything can't comment prices    Will coming back again?
