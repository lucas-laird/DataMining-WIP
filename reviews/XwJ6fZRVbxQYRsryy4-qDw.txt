Then top poboys don't come fries catfish basket only comes 3 small pieces catfish    town sorry tell all but they're really jipping guys  where actually catch seafood town  the calamari great though  <EOR> I don't understand why people raving place  Came twice both times wasn't really impressed  came back sec time because giving them benefit doubt being grand opening first time  first time ordered lbs shrimp sauce watery  second time ordered combo meal  Snow crab clams crawfish  sauce waaaaay salty!!! felt more ate more tongue burning salt  flavor good but think If tone down salt notch maybe add lil sugar would've waaaay better  Cali when comes Cajun food Cali pro it  Don't think come again  Sorry guys but did give them second chance  Didn't me  <EOR> First most incredible waitress named Ashley absolutely incredible customer service  ordered fried shrimp basket cup etouffee Ice T combination sauce minus garlic cuz meetings didn't want blow everybody room   Great flavor generous portions very happy received definitely back great flavor profile clean restaurant very friendly new go to spot seafood Chinatown Las Vegas  <EOR> I want give them 2 stars but service great friendly  Unfortunately don't know people come claim better good Hot n Juicy thinking  must smoking something much restaurants namesake smokin'  oil refer HNJ butter  right oil but juice also just watered down pretty bland  rather use butter tasty boil some sort  Mainly come shrimp  ordered 3 types now  Honestly better shrimp home hardly call myself cook besides literal form as no longer raw when am done it   garlic big flavor shrimp  Maybe if cut into tiny pieces flavor would come out  Add some spices salt etc   I just don't feel shrimp any taste  flavor just there  Some people want drink juice HNJ soup but more water left over rinsing HNJ pot  If Cravin Cajun whatever District 1 called before switching bland oxtail pho making crawfish shrimp place shrimp  below shrimp  Yeah bad  least Raging bigger shrimps offset lack taste compared HNJ  Smokin lacks both size taste   good  tried fried oysters good  Nothing write mom if did  Uh say hi your mom  extra mild indeed extra mild mild indeed mild versus HNJ where extra mild more mild still little kick it  department hit nail head   The place clean bright  Service awesome  just feel bad them because cannot see them around year two  Maybe making shrimp crawfish making oxtail pho decorate themselves bow two call themselves District 2 Mocking Shrimp   So overall great people but very average taste  stick first only shrimp place across street down street   <EOR> Loved mussels corn! Urban Mix flavoring spice level medium some kick  think try garlic butter next time well soft shell crab  first time trying can't wait back more!!! <EOR> This local must try  few 5 star reviews    You obviously crawfish here  Road Special crawfish clam shrimp  Great food friendly service  also note place kept very clean which important any restaurant particularly restaurants serving seafood  <EOR> Loved place! Food better other more popular option  Excellent food service  freshest shrimp crawfish clams urban mix sauce  <EOR> Went week day afternoon  Service great  Friendly staff place clean food great  Shared urban mix street combo more plenty 2 us  <EOR> My husband along friend daughter love cajun style food seasoning frequented competitors thought we'd try Smokin' Crawfish   We very disappointed once food started arriving  seasoning didn't taste good competitors seafood pasta bland deep fried catfish mostly breading  mixed seasonings shrimp snow crab legs normally isn't big deal but issue if customer specifically orders something no extra spice! All waitress could say sorry boss would bite head off if boss heard mess up  She offered other sauces try tame down but absolutely unacceptable  Another woman may manager came check things when she heard happened she immediately offered new bag snow crab legs prepared initially ordered   As finishing meal pack pasta go  When requesting box waitress found opportunity joke spitting food!!   Bottom line never going back again nor would recommend place anyone  <EOR> Love place seafood coffee! amazing delicious!! Can't say enough place but gotta back grubbin' now  <EOR> visiting city first time  good vibes employees  very attentive    i won lobster lobster machine cooked enjoyed it!!! <EOR> Food very mediocre    Our waiter Miguel failed deliver 2 5 items ordered  asked 2 pounds shrimp but only 1 pound served    We also ordered wings + fries basket appetizer never arrived  finished meal asked last time pending appetizer Miguel told chef very busy could sit wait another 15 minutes cancel order bill   I would recommend restaurant  <EOR> GOODBYE HOT N JUICY CRAWFISH BOILING CRAB YOU'VE BOTH REPLACED!

Every time would people come visit I'd take them here! Decided order to go few nights ago 30 minutes before closed because just couldn't wait until next day  BAD IDEA!!!!! valued place over hot n juicy because customer service alone! loved great would treat every time visited urban crawfish station  When came pick food could tell ready home  arrived before closing didn't hold them up  made mistake checking bags before left because such rush back home  no utensils gloves even napkins!!! messy meal! should've given provide! shouldn't ask that  food itself gross! shrimp beyond mushy weren't edible! flavoring bag looked bottom barrel end day all gross! top made stomachs upset two days ate it! displeased service food returning! Granted right before close but amount money people spend should same service quality food no matter time ordered! disappointed! <EOR> This place more trendy feel hot juicy  friend each pound shrimp ordered corn well  prices relatively similar hot juicy  12 dollars pound shrimp believe  sauce think actually more flavor though  color deeper richer seasoning pops more compared other crawfish chain  However boiling crab still favorite because thick sauce  Though urban crawfish station does some good spicy salty earthy flavors still watery  prefer if more chunks where really shrimp  Corn delicious always!  sweetness balanced spicy salty shrimp really well    The service nice  doesn't crowded there's plenty parking  think would definitely come back again! <EOR> Great place food service! Nice clean definitely lot better hot n juicy crawfish across street  <EOR> Just meh? never thought I'd say creole cajun food just meh!   In California whenever anyone hears words boiling crab nuts excitement dying addiction  Everyone's pupils dilate hunger saliva produces drips mouth  Oh entire EVENT when Cajun food part daily plan    Here Vegas aren't many options locations  figured I'd try joint since enticing happy hour oyster deal    Mm   overall service Kevin GREAT  Food wise shrimps overcooked small  cocktail sauce oysters wayyy tooo thick consistency  Almost gelatinous mucous consistency  fan!! Somehow somewhere also decided shrimp po boy  plain sandwhich looked probably best thing table  Yum!

 tried many restaurants during 20 years visiting Las Vegas California place worst far   My family Christmas eve around 6 00pm  She told wait hour  when finally sat down table right next dirty restroom ordered some foods  realized why hour wait time even  wasn't much customers waiting  place  didn't know operate restaurant all   ordered seafood combo #2 medium spice house fried rice alligator fries steam corn steam rice  took forever receive foods totally forgot rice corn never brought them until finished all  foods  When remind them she said wait another 15min steam corns    seafood combo lack flavor   House fried rice salty fried alligator choppy little pieces trash  worst three I really upset poor service food quality  just cannot believe why place received good reviews  Did paid people write good reviews?  When complained service she gave discount but rather pay full price  good service good quality food  wasted valuable holiday time money family terrible restaurant  <EOR> Kim Raju awesome  Just flew into Vegas NYC bit tired   But definitely brought life table  awesome first experience   thank guys  <EOR>
