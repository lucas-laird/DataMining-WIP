Atmosphere Pier 215 did disappoint  atmosphere restaurant very relaxed welcoming  slight breeze air gives same chill youd if actually pier ocean  Depending where you're sitting also very decent strip view adds welcoming feeling restaurant  Theres open patio isn't utilized yet which gives restaurant great potential patio seating adds more substance    Food incredible  ordered traditional chicken teriyaki Roll flavor incredibly well balanced  meal didn't feel heavy youd other places use thick cooking materials  also ordered Hawaiian breeze roll salmon incredibly well cooked w pineapple topping added amazing flavor  green tea passion fruit teas very smooth even without sugar great flavor  menu also well organized  may picture menu available request those desire photo menus    Customer service definitely growing but very acceptable  Given they've only around 2 weeks now customer service going feel those natural jitters occasional growing points but Max other staff handled everything perfectly options drink refills light conversation  more time paases no doubt place great reputation great service    Price very fair! Some items may seem little overpriced first but given moderate portion sizes quality overall prices actually seem very very fair  Don't judge book its cover until order    Overall 5 5 sure  place amazing potential amazing stop SW Las Vegas area beyond  Furthermore writing review or any restaurant offers free Mochi dessert! anything come those because they're perfect flavor  <EOR> Great food atmosphere  place great Japanese food really fresh sushi   come least once month shrimp scallop tobanyaki spicy tuna hand roll   Must try!  The staff also very attentive friendly  = <EOR> The decor atmosphere service outstanding commendable  A+ those details  place all trappings exceptional but held back few strong factors regarding menu food  menu generally touch overpriced despite many attractive offerings  garlic chili edamame very very good but portion simply far small justify price  rock shrimp appetizer conceptually interesting but underwhelming because much batter hiding whether intended shrimp themselves  Further dish topped dried cherries clearly supermarket bag  suppose would need more trips informed opinion sashimi sushi but city chalk full exceptional wide ranging options arena would suspect should invest higher quality source ingredients because seemed par good quality AYCE establishments which place definitely not  Probably good place casual lunch sample roll two sashimi offering but you'd better served look elsewhere higher quality offerings same prices  <EOR> Best sushi place town  Thanks Adrian excellent service!

PANKO SOFT SHELL CRAB LOVE soft shell crab presentation fun one  But other actual crab didn't care dish  plated pureed sweet potato flavor failed elevate highlight delicate crab flavors  serving tartar sauce also bizarre choice didn't really work  Maybe would benefitted more honey mustard instead  GARLIC BUTTER SEARED TUNA Gorgeous light flavorful  Really liked dish BF compared version served another favorite izakaya style spots town  Fish fresh flavors bright harmonious  PAN ROASTED LITTLE NECK CLAMS conflicted! mussels huge meaty ones Canada  But broth! bland!  supposed highlight dish needs served crusty bread soak up  much potential!  CLAM MUSHROOM MISO SOUP more traditional menu items  miso muted clams nice additional tofu seaweed expected  But didn't come across single mushroom   SUSHI DINNER $25 10 pieces nigiri + tuna roll  BF agreement AYCE quality sushi  Fish cut paper thin several slices improperly  Half cut against grain which kills cell destroys flavor  pieces hard chew didn't highlight buttery texture fresh flavors fish  Very disappointing! Did just sub par remnants slammed holiday?  215 ROLL namesake roll $22 packed several ingredients lobster soft shell crab asparagus mango micro cilantro tuna salmon avocado den miso sauce   Again gorgeous dish  But just didn't work  Throwing all your best ingredients into single roll doesn't work if flavors aren't balanced  bits fruitiness mango crunch asparagus but fish highlighted roll overwhelmingly dry  guy refused eat more two pieces which unheard of   We disappointed meal  Maybe would fared better ordering pasta dishes grilled meats featured specialties section  quality does match expectation set price point  eat your eyes first maybe  where extra star two come some rave reviews     I plan back sashimi rice bowl lunch hope better experience  Maybe return tapa raw bar items oysters octopus carpaccio  But Rod U said fish quality closer AYCE upscale caliber expected unfortunately  <EOR> Stopped place early dinner impressed  Nice location modern classy decor great service good good  weren't very hungry just wanted share few items planning coming back try more items    We half dozen kumamoto oysters boy those good!
