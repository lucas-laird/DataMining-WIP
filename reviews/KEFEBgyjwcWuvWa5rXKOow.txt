Don't miss that!  real fruit D   place extra special groceries   Made spend more P  Yeah though bound come back  <EOR> I visited Kusina Ni Lorraine Thursday before Xmas weekend   last minute Xmas shopping started very early could Xmas rush   time done 10 15  Most restaurants open 11  mission lunch Kusina Ni Lorraine surprised open 7am!    When restaurant parking lot empty other employees restaurants   walked ambious mediocre  nice see small grocery store back left establishment   As made way lunch counter all dishes fresh untouched  few times happy first buffet line   giddy giddy   Because no else restaurant just yet took time look over items had  dishes thought father would love breadfruit coconut  But because all ambitious when comes dishes stuck mongo beans beef calderetta half rice half pancit   food really good   Another reason why meaning try Kusina Ni Lorraine because copy catering menu  option 5 small platters feed 20 $110  think  fabulous deal even more needed try place ensure would worth cater through them future   At end visit since beef calderetta somewhat similar chicken afritada ordered small platter Xmas day $30   scheduled pick dish 2pm would open 1 pm other catered orders all would open Xmas day   received call Xmas day 10am asking if could pick 1pm didn't many catered orders day  agreed so   My small platter chicken afritada packed  also included hot dogs  never seen before  But thing unsure oily looked  When home husband agreed  sure didn't taste oily did sample soup delicious  any case help soak looked film oil suggestion husband added rice noodles it   So next time nice little shinding home include between 15 20 visitors catering Kusina Ni Lorraine include beef calderetta instead chicken afritada  <EOR> Close home food pretty good  big tubs food but adequate  Most if u close by <EOR> I  having rough time giving neighborhood business such low rating but honest  seems though location opened quickly isn't quite ready business  first time came nothing labeled did know if enough money purchase  only accepting cash time because weren't set electronic purchases  next time came cashier did enough change register he ask another employee maybe owner money pocket  very last time hoping improvement did certain food items available order even though listed menu   think may want wait least few months before back  hoping work getting things together  <EOR> Ayce 9 bucks  Food just ok   Staff ok  Many meats dishes  tough  Spaghetti ok mussles  salty  Pancit wierd  Karekare ok  Bisek meats where cut thick salty   Mungo watery  Jello good  Bittermelon eggs good   Sinigan good  <EOR> So craving Filipino food co worker suggested kusina ni Lorraine  Finally check favorite thing which chicharon bulaklak best chicharon bulaklak ever had  buy 1 pound could left over  If want authentic Filipino food should won't burn hole your wallet either  <EOR> So glad opened another branch close friend's house  location though only offers combination meals unlike other location Maryland Pkwy which offers buffet style dining    It little challenging find place quick tip sort same shopping area Hobby Lobby but located different building  right beside Curry Leaf restaurant   Food much at least TODAY   food ordered nilaga monggo seemed lack taste saltiness   lengua funny smell it  But all other food good  <EOR> Being east don't usually filipino restaurants serve buffets only $9 pulled pretty quick  Kusina ni Lorraine wasn't bad place loved food  tasted homecoming  only thing didn't really fact boyfriend young filipinos guess didn't think understood language but often spoke filipino regards food getting amounts which thought bit rude even if wasn't anything negative  It store restaurant together store your common filipino foods even frozen ones  snacks drinks really because don't usually if pricey  Would again! <EOR> We patrons restaurant most part living Vegas  Its food great especially lumpia but don't see myself going back ever again because regular sees appropriate berate other customers most illogical reason  husband food while kids dog waited hot car  probably 100F around noon  planned eating quickly car before heading park because dog us  getting food husband came back told staff said fine dog inside restaurant  decided grab table  nearest exit dog even barely few feet inside  entire lunch pretty much uneventful because obedient well trained dog save lady asked few questions dog's breed cook coming kitchen say good looking dog  When finished eating decided grab few things grocery area but heard woman condescendingly speak husband knowing some city code states bringing dogs restaurants allowed threatened call police  husband told if she issue dog she should bring staff told bring in  When told she should stop making stink since pretty common restaurants allow dogs she pressed give examples restaurants did told take business there  Good! will  puzzled anyone restaurant stepped tell person said okay dog there  If someone did did good job making sure paying customer felt safe establishment  If plan going Kusina ni Lorainne service dog prepared person harass bringing your dog into restaurant no matter reasons have  She seems think she's right because she thinks she call shots over there  According efforts convincing dog should allowed any restaurant moot because did know talking to  think know  Cruella de Vil! <EOR> Was very disappointed upon entering restaurant  didn't know whether seat ourselves wait seated host  Instead woman all way back signaled shouted come here! family back found buffet  came 3 hours before closing food looked if sitting long time  didn't look bad  plates sat down  food alright best  Unlike other Filipino restaurants where food made fresh really sucked  wasn't hot just tasted bland  Many choices but all looked tasted they've long    The worst part meal decided buy some traditional Filipino desserts  took home  sweet rice wrapped banana leaf  opened immediately smelled rotten rice! green! threw trash right away !  I say best part place store within restaurant  filled Filipino snacks goods  Overall terrible experience hope step up  love Filipino food love see many more filipino businesses popping everywhere  <EOR> I pinakbet  Its very close grandmas cooking  come back tray pinakbet!! didn't try everything but sure its all good  <EOR> Nice location polite staff   but food okay  sisig rice pancit  Everything bland   and really pretty easy please  <EOR> I wanted Filipino food bad but didn't feel cooking  place offer AYCE $8 99 person  food okay didn't expect dishes fresh knowing buffet style  offer good amount variety dishes suffice your cravings  also offer fruits some dessert pretty delicious  even offer warm dessert! customer service meh   they only being nice tipped them  place super hot doesn't help when you're slurping Sinigang soup  think I'd come back again   but only if really lazy cook  <EOR> 3 stars following reason 1  Location easy access lots space park  2  Staff friendly staff members 3  Food okay not good bad 4  Price expensive  5  Experience okay bought marshmallow cookie grocery section when home hard rock taste awful  <EOR> Hesitant order Filipino food new places but pancit lumpia empanadas delish! Going now on! <EOR> This location proof end town tad lousy  food delicious helps workers friendly service  most ample amount tables unlike near me  accommodates party 6 easy  use high chair without being someone's way    There also mini grocery store all most your basic Filipino fare necessities then some  glad tried else Kusina Ni Lorainne opinion would forever tainted  Hopefully stay consistent don't change  loathe when happens    Definitely recommend if side town looking authentic 'pilipino poods'  =D You could way bringing stroller in  When wasn't busy all   but if end side restaurant where walkway slimmer other side   your stroller might way  But decipher yourself while there  know stroller folks know make it work   = Enjoy! <EOR> This place use good last year now stingy food gotten bad! some pancit fried rice yesterday pancit salty hell fried rice spoiled  Then kare kare all bones filled cup   Im done going place  <EOR> I came upon hidden gem accident  going pick some Indian Food same plaza noticed it  Initially looked just ethnic market outside but upon entering saw delicious looking huge selection Filipino food   I goat stew beef stew peanut sauce  Both dishes packed intense flavors! Really tasty!  I'll definitely back try more selection  <EOR>
