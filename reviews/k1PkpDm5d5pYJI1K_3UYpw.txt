We stopped Thursday July 11th Friday July 12th  Though gravitated towards familiar McDonald's sandwich Nathan's line shorter decided try them out   I Sausage egg cheese English muffin add bacon first morning  figured would just add bacon sandwich but gave good amount side  think 5 strips  believe extra $2 add bacon amount justified cost  second morning same sandwich without adding bacon  believe sandwich over $5 but less $6  can't really remember didn't document any meals  Both days sandwiches hit spot! liked cheese melted egg all over muffin could just eat inside sandwich if wasn't super hungry   Nathan's offered great alternative McDonald's sausage egg mcmuffin  Plus didn't wait ridiculously long line! <EOR> I don't know caused think reviewing place now   joined Yelp several months ago dined back must September 2007     I guess fact still remember experience vividly     Ever stay MGM spend entire night vomiting sitting toilet your hotel room?  Well have   only thing eat day?  hot dog cheese fries Nathan's MGM     All food poisoning aside food still tasted shit   don't see anyone ever eaten those hot dogs thought tastes good!    Those probably same people eating McDonald's every day ones build hype machine around Nathan's annual 4th July cattle call Coney Island     And employees worked FAR less enthused career path   group six people only eat Nathan's   rest group all five them food before me   think something cheese sauce put fries which unbeknownst time would likely cause food poisoning later   Anyway if worked would seriously contemplate self immolation starting promising career drug game Las Vegas great place drugs hear      I guess positive friends tell story running trash hotel room vomiting into hallway bathroom being occupied female time   didn't vomit flight back St  Louis next day  <EOR> This review breakfast only  ordered breakfast two days row because loved pancakes applewood smoked bacon  addition Alicia's friendly service   she absolutely courteous polite  She really made feel welcome  Other ladies great too! very friendly group! back possibly tomorrow!!! <EOR> I dont know which address Las Vegas Hilton off strip outside convention center thats am reviewing   One word pukey Cannot understand rave hot dogs the snap snap? your stomach tells stop putting toxic dump dog inside it?  First no matter item its cold lukewarm  dogs suck buy he blew internationals taste 1000 times better costcos  Hell costcos dogs good bad  I ordered crispy chicken sandwich change things bit goodness worse anything eaten tempurate quality taste appearance wise Sure small wavy cut thumb fries look cute somewhat edible but whole establishment sucks ass  When trade show can't decide mini food court crap move 10 spaces left sbarros pizza not getting michelin star anytime soon but compared gourmet P s  shit aint cheap yet gross!!!! <EOR> I read few reviews surprised hardly anyone JUST hotdog  literally nothing wrong hotdogs natural casing come most hotdog necessities sauerkraut relish onions   Don't come anything but advice you'll ok! <EOR> I ordered foot long chili cheese dog  Terrible  food normally bad but looked tasted made few days earlier  dont expect great food nathans but also dont expect food most places would thrown away hours earlier <EOR> Does anybody know fries taste like?!  place sucked ASS!!!  Before Weinershnietzel Hot dog Stick damn Costco dogs   I'm picky eater   But hot dog place SUCKED ASS!!! can't express enough   I ordered chili cheese dog w cheese fries bacon   plain hot dog bacon hot dog w cheese fries    ?? okay    fine probably long night them lady front sweared she handed them $20 cashier gave  $1 change knows customer seemed shady herself   ANYWAYS    they corrected order now we're good again     It tasted cooked fries month old oil 14 hours fries we're horrible!!  Let remind picky just bad!  hot dog runny cheese even bacon!  thought could just pick off bacon but apparently fried same vat  much quick bite eat   never able myself throw day WISHED bulimic  Gross  <EOR> Hot dogs breakfast??? HOT DOGS BREAKFAST!!!  I hadn't eaten Nathan's since Coney Island '06 understandably nostalgic  Grocery Nathan's grill taste delish especially sale but can't quite replicate yum factor getting real thing   Unfortunately Vegas version isn't close real thing especially since don't offer vaunted onion sauce New York dog NEW YORK DOG  Don't worry sauerkraut dijon mustard still available $5 single hot dog highway robbery 2 $10 gets fries side  Breakfast menu available but might well MDonald's next door  <EOR> Very slow rude service but food good   also pricey try different place food court  <EOR> Despite nothing wrong location don't really know why anyone would stop unless hit MGM pool want something quick fast   Why choose keep coming here?  Mainly because line long food comes fairly quick  Located busy MGM food court Nathan's Famous chains frequently found throughout Las Vegas strip   other viable options food simply snuff warrant high cost mediocre product comes out     Here ordered Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich Everytime ordered chicken lukewarm underseasoned   also found bun preparation inconsistent   Sometimes came little warm other times char bottom   say item if must something chicken but never fully satisfying   Sausage egg cheese sandwich okay breakfast sandwich   did enjoy English muffin toasted nice nice crunch cheese melted nice evenly egg   However size smaller side making very satisfying   Perhaps because actually ordered hot dogs which Nathan's well known am giving them fair assessment product   However believe if able produce similar quality product your other items better off serving item   Overall food Nathan's nothing excited definitely should your place MGM food court which already many other options  <EOR> I always wanted try Nathan's hot dogs watching them TV        Boy did regret wasting money here  Super salty ridiculously overpriced 1 hotdog   Would better off eating McDonalds next door if want something eat  <EOR> This review only philly cheese steak Nathan's MGM Grand Food Court   good meal sandwich fries soft drink $11     pretty darn hungry could barely finish meal   could probably split meal someone else still very satisfied paying $5 bucks half sandwich  <EOR> I drunk hungry dog sounded good   it alright    I honestly can't imagine eating 68 things Competitive eating contest  2 enough    *puke* <EOR> Mediocre food very bland  price quality cost way off  Footlong chili cheese dog onion rings run $20  <EOR> My wife off MGM Grand Monorail decided eat casino  didn't want spend much money decided check food court  reason felt Nathan's eaten Venetian location night before  ordered 2 Nathan Hot Dogs Fries $9 99  If know expensive place you'd understand actually great deal  some odd reason hot dogs did snap used to  also quite disappointed quality fries soggy  quality food supposed consistent all Nathan's chains  MGM Grand's location failed tremendously  Oh well  We'll see happens when Nathan's reopens New York New York  <EOR> Bacon wrapped hot dog  Yup  Why expensive though? $4 drink? I'd rather compile collect store saliva left cheek swallow every 10 minutes  <EOR> I gave extra star being open available drunken state  Youd think though drunken state food wouldve amazing  However super dry looked almost left over food used  only thing enjoyed fresh coconut   but even way give doesnt easy drink it   meh  mean   next time just eat some mcdonalds your better off some nuggets  <EOR> So disappointing     MGM Grand Las Vegas over weekend made trip food court   right between breakfast lunch switch   line breakfast waffle bar Nathan's Hotdogs   approached seemed shift leader manager white shirt   She told she cut breakfast line could start lunch line if wanted lunch   totally understood told no worries first lunch line   Several groups people behind me   happened next very frustrating   young woman walked she didn't ask move   waited sure she going served breakfast   Once she allowed order waffle walked manager said right   Myself along 3 4 other people refused breakfast but she let woman order   She then spoke other woman Spanish which understand   add injury insult tried tell she phoned order   Which lie all saw order waffle   2 other people also started complain she should turned away   gentleman asked speak supervisor   supervisor just stood wasting time   gentleman explained incident supervisor said Thank turned walked back    always Nathan's fan but myself customers witnessed behavior line  McDonald's next store vowed never again purchase Nathan's product if way value customers  <EOR> Got regular hot dog chili cheese fries hit spot  wasn't expecting much hot dog stand but delivered  Chili cheese fries bomb  <EOR> so decide grab bite before NYE craziness   I bacon cheese hotdog   it $6 95 just dog   OMG r u serious? Totally worth it   and bf philly cheese steak fries combo  it totally dry NG not good    we liked environment MGM food court but Nathan's total bust here  not worth $20+ spent here    <EOR> Stopped today Philly sandwich split 2 us  Real good sandwich just right portion split half which did  Busy today but did take long  would return  <EOR> Good taste    always trustworthy cleanliness    but DANG! Why gotta stingiest place meats  Philly places usually STACK sandwiches contents inside  could physically close sandwich into complete fold without seeing any contents inside   problem    I you  do  stop trying unlikable  ever ex enjoyed but just TRYING broken with?  feels like  people happy  Put little bit food inside bread  going break bank much giving maybe even single ounce more meat example  But  just opinion guy paying $13 fast food Philly  Just saying  <EOR> We coupon buy free hot dog  So boyfriend two chili dogs everything it  chili dog $11 45 plus tax  He's never Nathan's hot dogs before he quite enjoyed them  He talking hot dogs all vacation  Of course aren't good Pink's hot dogs on La Brea Los Angeles CA   If haven't those totally worth long wait line  <EOR> Over hyped over priced! $5 95+tax=$6 43 little teeny weeny chili dog?! Come its just hotdog! No wonder those hotdog eating contestants eat much these! <EOR> One favorite places food court MGM Grand   fast food Nothing fancy people behind counter don't give shit speak when order    really bottom line   sausage egg cheese muffin two mornings row along hashbrown   Other trying hustle drinks I'd say really good place eat   Your other choices McDonald's for price conscience pizza place   forgot other place left Nathan's   great place breakfast   However looking all other reviews probably want pass all other meals  <EOR> Fries over cooked burned Krispy Chicken sandwich $10 size McDonalds small Hamburger LOL definitely business far flavor OK nothing special though would never eat again honest  Oh Yeah LMAO medium soda $4  <EOR> So Nathan's foodcourt MGM which shares space Panda Express like Chinese food place McDonald's Pizza place   actually interesting place foodcourt considering Craftsteak SeaBlue Michael Mina practically right next door   I 2 hot dog fries combo $8 95   staff seemed friendly enough   didn't any problems   The hot dogs just   guess say people gaga over Pink's no good reason because let's face Pink's isn't even really good   really only experience eating Los Angeles institution   feel same way Nathan's   such historic New York tradition when someone says want try Nathan's because good but because cultural experience    two cents anyway   I would however say hotdog skin nice pop   know mean?  No?  Amateurs      I probably wouldn't come back though  <EOR> For some reason whenever good hot dogs worth every stinking dollar paid always want smoke two 2 cigarettes another while faux drunk calling ex girlfriend   Food court did ashtrays nearby   Cellphone signal blocked casino   Serendipity likes tie way sometimes  <EOR> Tasty? Yes  Over priced? WOW ton!!! Two ate hot dogs salads $40! Way much  <EOR> The Philly cheese steak good meat moist tasty bread warm soft cut into half     pricey food court $14 00 yes but hey inside casino Vegas  so expected  <EOR> I've Nathan's dogs Coney Island yonks ago  don't think going back anytime soon meantime dogs do   We've come back several times snacks whether early late snack always line location  guess if you're staying hotel then just sense place   I agree buns aren't great if dogs thicker would even better  However nothing comes close snap Nathan's hot dogs even though most time try resist dogs eat somewhere else end having bite two dog  fries seriously addictive but must say damn expensive get   3 5 stars <EOR> It barely ok  Staff nice  Food very little flavor  never add salt food today to  ranch dressing good  gave 3 stars because clean <EOR> The hotdog tastes pretty good  Love fried onion ring  <EOR> Nothing spectacular  think made better hot dogs home   <EOR> Coming MGM pool decided drop grab dog   place horrible   took almost 20 minutes three hot dogs fries no  all me       buzzer thingies didn't even match recipes!  While standing couple said waiting almost 30 minutes workers gave food someone else   If knew took long fast food woulda called ahead reservations  <EOR> I excited see when boyfriend walking through hotel  love Nathan's hot dogs! decided just normal hot dog onions hot dogs good but bun VERY strange taste mean really weird  <EOR> I Philly Cheese steak   pretty greasy   alright   Definitely good hangover food  <EOR> We wanted something light dinner   5 fast food restaurants food court wasn't large selection lighter meal   salads Nathan's   Given Nathan's hot dog joint salads surprisingly good hit spot   The process order then give buzzer when your food ready   guess comes handy if gets really crowded but wasn't seemed waste time   The bacon cheese fries also good OK didn't entirely light but bacon overly smokey tasting   Next time cheese only   Overall bad choice given selection restaurants food court  <EOR> Tried Nathan's leaving wet republic  tried Philly cheesesteak bacon  everything hoping specially hours partying hahah    It huge portion tons meat mixed sautéed onions green peppers mushrooms course plenty fatty bacon    The bread lightly toasted butter crispy outside nice fluffy inside    You nacho cheese included prefer side  $12 15 per person including drink  Next time trying famous hot dogs hopefully good too  <EOR> This place disgusting Sunday night may 27th 2018 ate chicken sandwich food poisoning   Non stop throwing up! never step foot again!!!! Also charged add tomatoes lettuce sandwich! <EOR> I Las Vegas personal business trip needed something quick easy fast  MGM Grand food court offered four five different places eat chose Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs   I ordered Combo two standard Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs fries drink   came almost $12    WOW    expensive simple hot dogs but decent filler food   actually thought prices actually reasonable due close proximity MGM Grand Convention Center course area tourist trap   Three stars decent rating needed restaurant for   maybe review more MGM Grand Food Court convenience convention attendees myself  <EOR> First off major props great Kobayashi reigning champion Joey Chestnut   Just thought eating many hot dogs Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest both crazy gag inducing kudos them literally being able hold all them down   However now tried Nathan's hot dogs myself?  Well let's just say impressed down right amazed     While never anticipated checking food court neighbor Pan Asian Express part long wanted try Nathan's   Though heard lot tepid things them I'd always curious made hot dogs famous    considering unlikely visit flagship spot Coney Island since needed back conference center seemed good time any check them out!  Despite menu includes other offerings cheesesteaks burgers salads ?! no question going get   However since basic seemed plain and expensive money opted BACON CHEESE DOG $7 98 side CRINKLE CUT FRIES $3 98      The short version?  Both awful  The longer version?  Both really really awful   For hot dog didn't look all appetizing   figured they'd use cheese sauce whiz but expecting bits crispy bacon two stripes greasy mealy bacon   Even still beyond whiz which kind gross hot dog itself wasn't very good neither juicy nor flavorful   fries?  tasted old oil fried very soggy     Like nearly all other spots MGM Grand's food court Nathan's cheaper places around find something eat   However you'd far better off spending bit more somewhere else   nice save few bucks especially Strip but there's difference between being cost conscious being cheap stupid   Pass  <EOR> Not place thought would find well known spot MGM Grand first lets just say food eatable cause half people eat drunk poor eat elsewhere  said price Nathan's cheap pars same price concession stand event center if higher  foot long chilli dog your mind gutter   chiili fries  drink over filled ice took 4 zips hello? Where soda? Chilli fries delicious foot long warm  other choices roughly same pricing move on  <EOR> i'd eat just anything late night drinking but 1 3 way through chicken cheesesteak realized kinda gross should prob cut losses  boyfriend regular cheesesteak felt similarly  the bread dry meat greasy just fresh tasting   wasn't enough ketchup mgm grand save this   i say however fries meet nathan's standard if need some salty fried crunchiness late night i'd hit them fries only  <EOR> Ate place over charged  when checked receipt see why paid $18 tenders fries noticed register calculated check incorrectly  <EOR> I refused give business establishment few years back when repeatedly received VERY poor customer service I know fast food but McDonald's next door 10x better    messed order completely FORGOTTEN order many times   Really disappointing   Well some reason tonight decided give another try   cashier semi friendly took order gave little vibrating number holder   ordered chicken finger platter    I know fresh but took looooong time   Other customers came food still stood waiting   Finally 15 minutes ready   ordered and paid for side cheese sauce along hot sauce ranch   None bag when she gave order   When asked them she made loud sigh proceeded items requested   The food itself good fresh   chicken fingers crispy light fries good well   I am borderline 3 stars place   Unfortunately prices enough bring back 2 stars   understand strip but McDonald's next door similar prices would find anywhere   $11 95 chicken caesar salad bit ridiculous   if nice could even look past that    But rudeness lack attention detail bump down every time   Sorry 'bout it! <EOR> Love Nathan's every time Vegas  French fries die for  Service good fast  gone Luxor MGM Bally's  We always Philly Cheese steak side fries  Just sure check hotels hours most hotels strip  And don't forget grab your coupon off your placemat before throwing away too  Never disappointed when go recommend everyone check them when Vegas <EOR> Too expensive here     $9 hot dog fries?! $12 philly cheesesteak fries   Everything tastes good but nothing over top great  <EOR> When first tried Nathan's New York New York Hotel Las Vegas midnight snack absolutely loved it!! Then following year tried MGM Grand huge disappointment  looked good but dog no snap it!! bread fell apart which pet peeves when comes hot dog  bun should never ever break!!!   One positive thing? ordered grilled onions it's menu ask best part meal   Maybe need back NY NY Hotel try theirs again  <EOR> woke late really want quick breakfast really bad service equally lousy food nathan's las vegas strip food court   say want 2 waffles 4 times before bilingual server order correctly  coffee didn't show tray bilingual cashier told she didn't coffee order  frustration  starbucks accross stall fix instead reordering nathan's coffee  food equally bad  waffle soggy bacon hard biscuit didn't come butter jam  should gone mcdonald's 2 stalls away half price  <EOR> compared nathan's palms bjork show dog tasted cooked days before maybe years still cheap vegas oh tasty beer  <EOR> I bit rush thought why grab dog Nathan's  ordered classic hot dog Grilled onions sauerkraut  very good hot dog  place most places MGM food court aren't always fastest but expected busy place  $6 bit pricey hot dog but again MGM food court  All all bad option   Check them out  <EOR> I think if pick between overpriced Nathan's overpriced Bonanno's Bonanno's wins  couldn't McDonald's next door principle but sorely tempted  <EOR>
