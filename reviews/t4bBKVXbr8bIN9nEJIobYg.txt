Raj definitely brought BEST India city never sleeps  If driving through any where within couple hundred miles Las Vegas Saffron Flavors India must stop dinner! <EOR> I devastated when Saffron close its doors several months moment read reopened back night ready some more five star Indian taste   Alas only thing five star Saffron now husband's old review which he plans downgrade soon   The staff still friendly  dining room still pretty  I'd give four stars both  menu offers shahi paneer know already happy   But did Saffron reopen same chef? Because taste? Eh    Look if live area then you're probably delighted  But nothing I'd drive across town which exactly used do  Now taste little acrid little bland seasoning nutty whatsoever shahi sauce although served little hotter before I always order 7 1 10 scale but don't mind hotter just taste heat taste complex spices   If rating strictly taste I'd struggle give 3 stars just because little shy A OK definitely experienced better the 2 star rating right building    As struggled give entire experience 3 stars even factoring good points described above  Why? Well asked remaining food go  want your rice packed separately mixed dishes? Odd question but okay  Separately please  We'd left least half meals untouched really being satisfied but we'd hoped most Indian food might taste better next day flavours settled   So imagine disappointed when opened puffed out to go bag when home  only two boxes  rice other three dishes all mixed together   It's Indian food  saucy  going obey 1 2 inch compartments single to go box  Huge mess    Now realize two vegetarian dishes slathered husband's chicken tikka masala see why disappointment turned disgust  cheap unprofessional  We'd clearly ordered separate dishes but even if hadn't wouldn't want own curries all mixed together single to go box   Saffron three star rating respects good times once had  Good times hope your other customers experience  know your heart right place  But you've going now *not* A OK  hope you'll return your prior glory but can't see driving past all sure thing Indian places take chance again  <EOR> Hubby last night recommendation friend   pretty quiet when only 3 tables 3 4 people   decor surprisingly pleasant mélange Tuscan Southwest Indian gold crimson sage being main colours   Server friendly attentive   ordered chickpea marsala lamb tikka both featured tasty spicy sauces   naan fresh oven lovely entrée sauces   Everything seemed really fresh nothing left bad aftertaste!

The food itself OK but amazing   Definitely overpriced   If hadn't gotten restaurant com GC would felt super ripped off   felt only little ripped off   guess spoiled remember getting 5 dishes $35 Indian restaurant closed Decatur Charleston   barely 2 dishes order naan   It closest Indian place know may back   But won't running back  <EOR> Great authentic Indian Cuisine!!! can't say enough place  food service great  If mood some Chicken Tikka some Chicken Biriyani then place go     Garlic Naan bread all way don't miss this    They offer dine take small full bar rooms rent larger gatherings    Conveniently located 95 NW valley off strip great locals tourists alike  <EOR> Food taste alright service great! add many colors Lamb Vindaloo Chicken chili don't know those colors FDA approved not  Look little scary when know spices  Inside decoration really beautiful  relaxing    <EOR> After hiking Mount Charleston four stopped try lunch buffet   group before recommended it   good recommendation!  The buffet small but size range others   $11 99 price OK   cheapest most expensive   restaurant attractive comfortable seating   separate section through which enter where bar located   buffet adjoining area view dining room   There selection salad yogurt chutney desserts beginning buffet   initial bar several chafing dishes various foods   tried chicken tikka masala curry chicken dal makhani onion pakora some fried chicken balls  the name which can't remember   Accompanying basmati rice     For most part dishes good flavorful   dal bland   could used some seasoning   chicken balls tasty different   should gotten some chutney onion pakora but failed so   Next time   group noted chicken tandoori dry   didn't try but noted future reference   made second trip buffet something sweet offset disposition   gulab jamun very good   quite soft overly sweet   very nice ending lunch   Service average   when restaurant opened soon busy but couple people working small room   When gulab dirty plate removed   Other things OK   If area I'd certainly stop again   middle tier Indian buffets tried   Since closest place where live back   wouldn't recommend coming other side town buffet when other places just good better UNLV area  <EOR> Our quest find best Indian lunch buffet Vegas continues!  Protip isn't it   My wife dinner before actually quite tasty  trucked all way Craig weekday afternoon try buffet sadly didn't live expectations based dinner service   The naan still amazing but buffet selection downright paltry  firang side pleased usual chicken tikka pakora but come lunch buffet try variety different things   If Saffron would devote more space effort lunch buffet instead cramming small selection into tiny alcove would worth return visit  food quality actually very good but limited selection just kills me  <EOR> First time trying indian food restarunt am huge fan curries but place lacking   Ordered chicken masala if remember right almost gritty because seasoning   Ordered Chicken tikka saffron sampler all meat cooked death really dry   Maybe dont know indian food should but meat seemed way over cooked   Also cheese naan great  <EOR> Round 2 Saffron Flavors India  Why taken long if good ask?
