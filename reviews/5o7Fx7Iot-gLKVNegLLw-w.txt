If your familiar Pupusas traditional Salvadorian dish consists handmade corn tortilla then stuffed more ingredients  llooks thick stuffed white corn tortilla  If you've never try they're great!  My usual order Complimentary Chips Black Bean sprinkled little queso Dip   love black beans aren't common  come warm creamy little salty    Revueltas Pupusa pork bean cheese pork grounded wasn't chunky  beans mashed cheese just melted all together thin spread  pork nice flavor just enough taste it  Beans creamy Cheese mild bite  favorite all Pupusa's tried here    Queso Y Frijol cheese beans love bean cheese burritos just made sense!   Queso cheese Plain ol' cheese Sometimes simple long way!  *Pupusa's always come 2 condiments Curtido Salsa Roja mandatory add every bite  Curtido thinly sliced cabbage carrots onions    pickled some sort  Salsa Roja orange red color sauce resembles chili but isn't spicy  more seasoned tomato sauce  method pour Curtido top whole Pupusa then pour Salsa Roja over that  GOOOD!!  The staff always seemed good mood polite kept smile =D  Prices very reasonable special monday's wednesdays 99 cent Pupusas  Super deal! Place always bumpin' jams reggaeton spanish dance   really loud sometimes! Never bothered but throw in! if want something other tacos quesadillas then say try bad boys! <EOR> Papusas great but overcooked tamale dark burnt overall pretty good <EOR> I met wife dinner other day  El Santaneco close work across school UNLV decided give El Santaneco try   I ordered chile relleno de carne de puerco  pretty decent   My wife pupusas chicken potatoes  She's big fan pupusas happy find convenient place serving them up  She said she's better but they're good enough satisfy craving  Unfortunately did flan which listed menu favorite craving unfulfilled   We given requisite chips salsa  chips kind seemed half them store bought half homemade  salsa orangish  good interesting  reminded cross between chicken broth tomato soup   The waitress barely spoke English speak minimal Spanish but along okay  <EOR> This amazing place eat love food yummy especially pupusas  I love family service nice    the place clean  I love because different food choose central American Mexican!!!! <EOR> Wow!
