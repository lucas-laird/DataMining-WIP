Shame management restaurant hotel <EOR> If you're Vegas looking buffet definitely stop Seasons Silverton Casino  place great! few miles away strip you'll drive taxi but certainly worth it  great selection items buffet traditional american asian mexican selections  food good quality fresh lacking flavor many buffets do  price also reasonable  $16 99 without coupon includes beverages soft drinks option purchase alcoholic beverages additional cost  absolutely no complaints food  wish could rate 4 5 stars instead 4  only critique kind hard locate spoons for soup ice cream etc    also waitress didn't come around much would've liked drink refills  track down once which wouldn't problem if place super busy but wasn't  Overall   very good! would definitely come back! <EOR> I Seasons lot over years  always pretty solid usually great local deals which usually draws in    On occasion friends town desperate need AYCE food  suggested Seasons off went  line which scarily long started wait  heard rumblings free buffet offer took turns Rewards Club  booth sign up  fella already cards but free buffets $5 slot play signing newbies score!  It took hour half through line everyone getting pretty antsy line  friends show each passing minute making them nervous leaving time  finally seated off scrounge around plate food before run off  food always pretty solid buffet food but deduct star slow service long line  did deal best could servers rest staff obviously overwhelmed large amount people filtering because promotion  definitely need account staff more people weekends   All all solid buffet usually suggest friends family when they're looking good food cheap  Bets all chocolate covered strawberries  know simple pleasures  <EOR>
