Some dishes worth checking out mochi bacon skewers cheesy tomato potato pork skewers   The food great but little over priced  $4 per skewer $8 larger dish easily drop $30 bucks still able eat more but then again don't think dishes anywhere else town   The service kinda slow but servers polite almost made it  Yes am being generous 4 stars but props offering yelp check in offer!

Everything irresistible honestly nothing beats tapas style menu  much fun try 3 5 different items everytime come never leave disappointed   My all time favorites Hamachi Kama Koro Koro steak Age Dashi Tofu  desserts great too    It also restaurant feel super authentic when customers all around speaking Japanese think even all waiters fluent take orders Japanese well!   I used Ichiza whenever wanted Izakaya adventure but Kyara beats way better menu design more often better tasting food just missing honey toast    You just try place! Also adding some menu pics since didn't see any pics yelp current menu 07 2017 <EOR> I've Kyara few times prior revisiting weekend   those places enjoyed quite bit but since exactly close falls off radar    until constantly see half Yelp friends list checking into every other weekend seemingly having time lives while sit home crying into sad lonely bowl chex mix   But digress      So found friend hang Saturday before ventured another friend's house convinced Kyara me   Once first thing noticed quiet when used being fairly crowded previous visits   possible early 7 pm Saturday? because did seem pick time on      I decided fairly quickly just throw caution wind really worry a much ordered b $much$ ordered   Boy dining does lot more enjoyable way even though particularly realistic way live   ordered quite bit going attempt rank them worst best because simply more dramatic way      1 Blue Cheese Potato Salad don't know all hope world thought bland    Maybe bad batch but could barely taste blue cheese NOR potato   possible?
