Fun bartender  kegs seen beers standing refrigerators pick too  <EOR> The only reason come amazing selection craft beer!!!!  Im giving place only 3 stars following reasons 1 seating really awkward  bar area weird bench seats seem meant fit few people but squishy  Additionally if there's someone table next awkward getting out  big person all 5'3 111lbs   other half room big open overly well lit bar   don't know but don't drink bright ass room  prefer sit dark bar area awkward setting but always full  2 food way overpriced portions quality opinion  <EOR> The food ok especially sweet potato fries but really 7 lousy chicken wings $9? No wonder place empty   The waitress however very nice still felt ripped off menu doesn't tell many wings price which again high little  <EOR> I decided stop late last night long day work  lot people bar but still able find machine play right away  bartender Brandie very quick serve greeted very enthusiastic welcome  Even though busy she never made wait fresh drink  All while she super friendly always finding time talk me  Overall service second none want definitely come back again  Great atmosphere great selection unique beers tremendous bartender top all!

Plus weekly trivia nights karaoke  more could want?! If end stopping say hi Nicole Kim Matt Krystal Steph! awesome <EOR> Fast friendly service phenomenal beer selection  Tons TV's every seat clear view   Solid fries meaty wings  <EOR> I came location holiday work party together  am really big beer drinker but did appreciate all dedication A A puts providing its customers wide variety beers  chose apple cider beer very good refreshing  liked bar separate dining area  made feel almost 2 different places  dark quiet bar side bright airy dining room other side  back room parties patio some fresh air  The menu provides wide variety choices chose salads pizza sandwiches appetizers main dishes  group loved pizza burgers wraps  offer mixed drinks wine if beer your friend  am huge sports fan but kept entertained numerous TVs mounted   The wait staff did seem bit frazzled skipped over some party  Food took while come drinks refilled often think should orders mixed when came but party almost 20 could factored confusion   I hope come back try some more menu items another cider beer  <EOR> My husband last night couple friends   it TERRIBLE!! Avoid all cost!! husband peanut allergy when ask food took 15mins response  When ordering beer didn't know everything #or didn't know was  friend ordered 2 beer girl came back 1 told ordered 2 beers missing she comes back 2 more!! Another friend food wrong late!! only + tv's!! food average nothing great  place potential but staffing needs retraining all all new staff  Very disappointing <EOR> So think Aces Ales needs decide kind bar wants be   I love food craft beers but everything else pretty much sucks  service usually geared towards regulars if one   good luck  mean rude anything just shrug off bit   When Tuesday evening mostly video poker players free Bud Miller Coors Lights  Maybe because can't comp'ed craft beers? craft beer bar just another creepy video poker bar?  Lastly realize am biased being non smoker but don't see enjoy great food great craft beers chain smokers all around you  Maybe missed less smokey area?  To summarize great food craft beer but environment very much distracts this  <EOR> My husband Tony performed wedding Aces Ales Saturday  manager Austin team flawless customer service professionalism  ceremony patio gorgeous fireplace  reception held private dining room  meatballs veggie tray cheese curds appetizers  delicious!

Let way    only reason why can't give Aces Ales 5 star review service very slow waitress wasn't knowledgeable beer  When places 8 + IPAs would help if she could distinguish between each brew    Food wise ordered pretzel Buffalo chicken Mac cheese  Both good typical pub food but nothing write home about  would recommend just getting something quick before coming save cash!   Just come beer  tap list good  <EOR> I've party back room come every Tuesday pub trivia  food really gone downhill over time  party catered wonderfully however every week new servers clueless overwhelmed forget everything order  Courtney probably best server but come night see unfortunately find she let go  Shame because she awesome  Last week ordered ahi tuna salad French dip bf sick all night  haven't sick before decided try again   Tonight ordered nachos extra cheese  nachos came sprinkle UNMELTED cheese  ordered extra sour cream barely anything tortilla chips server never came back it  person group ordered tacos never came  Beer selection good food awful service worse   EDIT tacos sour cream finally came   40 minutes later  <EOR> Don't just stand idiot if no hostess anyone greet when walk just claim seat bar stake claim any table yourself home   Just don't carried away take off your smelly shoes walking around your undies   Exceptions however granted case case basis but don't even bother unless playing rock paper scissor look sexy similar MMA ring girls just breathing   So think into craft beers?  Then buddy might place hit up  30+ selections craft beer list updated frequently   Just keep mind inventory does seem very deep therefore your first couple selections may unavailable   I don't drink but occasions when feel watch latest game getting something eat bars Aces Ales   Lucky burgers salads above average bar food category   If want good service then sit your ass bar   tables along wall other side bar larger parties but service level great which mentioned several previous reviews    So particular occasion ordered myself Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad   entre sized salad nicely cooked steak sliced served top mixed greens   If mode above average burger bar consider ordering this   probably send message thanking later   A friend mine being adventurous maybe just looking find decent Chicken Waffle spot Las Vegas he ordered   tried some but both agreed no bueno   Mucho disappointed friend he wishing he gone route entre salad   Well tiny voice experience did ignored time   We also split order Fried Cheese Curds dipping sauces decent appetizer   am sure hard finish engross yourself games shown TV video poker bar while snacking   Anyway great spot craft beer lovers hidden gem above average bar foods   Review #7 2014 <EOR> Food Beer good but service awful  Granted having private party but restaurant empty   Took 30 minutes sandwich kitchen <EOR>
