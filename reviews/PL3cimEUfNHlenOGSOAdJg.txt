Good Times hand roll classic spicy tuna  Both well made tasted delicious  <EOR> The best thing Kumi decor very pretty although really loud    experience well below average   food nothing more would very average Japanese restaurant   worst part however service!  food came really odd order such different  times 1 dish did show all entree 20 minutes behind daughters!?  experience might expect waiter least acknowledge things right try explain apologize did happen   He actually seemed annoyed getting annoyed!  would back nor would recommend anyone rather high prices really should much much better  <EOR> We decided eat hear since going shark reef  food decent staff great  portions very small such sashimi cuts  example 2 pieces Salmon would piece most LA restaurants   The price each item horribly high guess feel its necessary pay higher atmosphere even know other sushi restaurants prices seemed more reasonable    Menu also very limited  would suggest place unless find convenient just smaller party  <EOR> Very good fish price    Service started very well Paul waiter explaining approach fish menu us  He extremely knowledgeable articulate different types fish meats preparation  Very sharp guy  Realizing knowledge told liked let pick some dishes try  reccomendtions quite varied Hot mess Yellowtail Tuna Kumu Mari Kobe Beef Yuzu Mushrooms   All them fantastic!

Half way through meal found long hair shishito peppers but wasn't worst part   staff manager handled situation    When check came still tried charge peppers hair  asked manager  young lady came over said she would take peppers off bill  told bare minimum finding hair your food acceptable least free drink dessert would've made better little bit sympathy  But instead she reassured she only long hair restaurant wasn't sure could've even gotten peppers   another guy friend clearly hair  She extremely rude made sound placed hair food    When refused pay bill she threatened call security escort off property  avoid further ruining night paid bill but rest assured never return restaurant certainly disputing credit card     These situations happen could easily handled bit care  But fault she seemed relatively new poorly trained manager   attitude lack any professionalism made clear     A drink free dessert offer which costs them $3 $200 bill would've made everybody happy  <EOR> Las Vegas some great sushi restaurant's kumi them   service decent but sushi fresh over priced   If looking good sushi strip recommendation Japonais Mirage  <EOR> I wouldn't bother place when many other choices Vegas   Even though pricey steak good seemed more fat steak spicy tuna rolls extremely mediocre   Service started great then seemed disappear entirely end meal  usual wait staff turn charm when time bill paid! <EOR> This place holy grail sushi  most incredible dining experiences sushi restaurants ever to  service food both outstanding  If you're planning dining which should order crispy rice! <EOR> The decor atmosphere nice different plates share try    Food five stars must try's     Miso Cod miso cod before just good before Nobu  Nobus bit better but amazing well  eat now!!!

When arrived waited bar 10 minutes   opening night impressed restaurant didn't seem chaotic although main dining area completely sat sat us bar very busy     One thing observed bartenders spending lot time perfecting look drinks   don't drink alcohol can't say whether also perfected taste but drinks serving over bar very elegant beautiful!     When ready seat gave table middle main dining area near DJ booth front sushi bar   very impressed space decor atmosphere   Everything felt classy yet comfortable chic    I LOVE restaurants really pay attention detail energy room     The DJ great although admit no idea spinning   amazing company extremely entertaining entire night   remember enjoying music though noticing setting perfect tone members room     Chef provided tasting several pride dishes   15 different dishes fan all except one   did really care pork chops but maybe because least unique other dishes brought out     Meal highlights Lamb Chops Octopussy Sizzling Steak Plate my absolute favorite item night sashimi platter     It obvious staff training saw few bussers fill glasses pitcher water when bottled water sitting right table   However little things don't bother ruin experience especially when everything else flawless!

If your first time trying definitely must have!  The service little strange   very attentive but kept making mistakes   friend sparkling water flat water but kept trying fill glass sparkling water   Additionally twice during meal tried take dish away when yet finished   seems trying very hard efficient alert but ended backfiring them   The ambiance very high energy but also dimly lit   appeared trying create more formal environment but loud music made informal   Two seated booth seemed designed four strange   If trying impress date specific when your reservations ensure right table   looked well decorated area opposite end restaurant would love seated next time   All all food delicious but definitely overpriced especially consideration strange service ambiance   If someone very price sensitive then would definitely recommend because food scrumptious!  If price sensitive then could certainly find better value elsewhere  <EOR> So friend took restaurant birthday!!!

Top Notch Customer Service James  Thank James excellent night Cons Lack menu  eat once kind place  feel ate once won't come back since isn't many options  If particular sashimi  wanted would ask where rolls little different  ask if could rainbow roll because wasn't even listen menu  feel easiest most basic rolls EVERY sushi place menu <EOR> It bit pricy but hey Vegas! ordered Hot Mess roll based all Yelp reviews really good  spicy but still enjoyable person normally can't handle heat  also ordered Pork Belly Roll amazing  Portions aren't huge but felt satisfied  Staff attentive  <EOR> Fish wonderfully fresh  Offerings both creative others satisfy true sushi sashimi purist  server wonderful    However hostesses very unpleasant  most basic requests seemed serious inconvenience  Although did catch names both brunettes  very friendly easygoing customer never encountered such negative attitude someone service industry  I'd say tarnished experience greeting goodbye but never offered goodbye thanks stopping by  spent around 150 person late lunch early dinner 5pm never back  Shame because food good  said also never stay hotel doesn't great sushi restaurant  Unfortunately means entire National Limousine Association now looking elsewhere Las Vegas  next massive convention  miss Delano  <EOR> Awesome  Sit bar those comfy chairs grab Margherita order fried rice squares gyoza Toro rolls ribeye steak mushrooms can't imagine impressed me  great place!

Made visit Vegas even better!!! <EOR> While sushi great can't good conscience recommend place  sell bluefin tuna which highly endangered  <EOR> I wrote review months ago but seems disappeared   Well last time gave 5 stars!  Although last time perfection start end   sadly time wasn't   Our waiter didn't give name seemed very indifferent   attitude he rather anywhere but work   money pay pretend personality!!!  We ordered    Green Geisha good last time   Couldn't taste much drink mostly water Tuna Tataki okay Cucumber Salad Delicious! Kobe Beef Taco bland nothing want again  Hot Mess Delicious!! Spicy Tuna Delicious!  As much loved some foods ones weren't good pretty bad   drink disappointing last time perfect!    The guys deliver food pick dishes more professional waiter    sure if we'll again   Vegas many choices settle! <EOR> An outstanding Japanese anywhere  know ton sushi places LV but fav! Great mix flavors interesting combinations ingredients impeccable service trademarks  Start Yellowtail Serrano Calamari cold hot dish share  yellowtail amazing  Calamari always difficult stand but did  also Hot Mess Kumi Mari Spicy Tuna Yellowtail Unagi  Just fantastic  Drinks service all met expectations which pretty high  $100 per person including drinks cheap  If don't drink $50pp  <EOR> A hip yet relatively uninspired woefully overpriced sushi restaurant gorgeous Mandalay Bay    I specialty roll  the 007 Octopussy roll  no reason price I believe around $25   man friend California roll shrimp tempura roll both which also quite good but worth price  also some sort chocolate dessert fine but hard wrong chocolate dessert    This restaurant does stand sea restaurants Strip but satisfies expensive sushi craving if happen Mandalay Bay  <EOR> My friend Vegas recommended try kumi before going cirque show Mandalay bay  excited try new sushi restaurant visit  food exceptional!  Definitely egg plant appetizer  All rolls veggies fresh flavors unique  cocktails also awsome  Try lychee martini  only reason could rate 5 stars because ordered cocktails didn't receive them until already done eating entire meal  But did take them off bill  appreciated recognized service issue  Overall highly recommend if visiting Vegas  <EOR> My family decided try Kumi first night Las Vegas past month    Being sushi fanatics ordered borderline obnoxious amount spicy tuna rolls various maki sashimi say    BEST SUSHI EVER HAD!   The service received exceptional  only critique waiter coming off little salesy first trying push certain drinks dishes way  could very well due fact he new still trying find voice   I surprised fast dishes arrived table  allowed try more things off menu overall made evening more enjoyable  Kumi definitely place I'd recommend anyone staying Mandalay Bay! <EOR> The worst sushi ever! Run away shrimp tempura roll!!! Service mediocre environment extremely noisy <EOR> The evening started ok  reservation seated right away  Waiter initially pretty quick coming table taking drink orders   then food   Service downhill that  When he came back second time ordered sake  never came did see waiter again  Another waiter came introduced himself  he never mentioned leaving taking over blah blah blah  pick own drinks bar god's sake  BS price charge  husband talked manager waiter 2nd way out  Waiter least apologized but damn manager! puss face even she listening made  want hurl her  disgusting behavior  Despite all celebrating daughter's bday And told them that  No dessert Short rib great    everything else mediocre  better without all bells n whistles  <EOR> This beautiful restaurant excellent service  did chefs menu some items good while others much  felt cooked meats chicken dry lacked flavor rock shrimp tiny ones find cat food disappointing but sushi good  Skip dessert tried them all nothing really stood out  fact desserts all little weird unappealing   I wish didn't violently ill eating would able give better review but bummer being trapped bathroom whole night while friends off gamble  still sick morning  <EOR> This place way much fusion refined Japanese food eating palate   dishes all potential but drowned sauce   Sauce sauce sauce sauce   shishito peppers hot mess roll black cod eggplant  assortment apps roll   All dishes drenched sauce   plus side sauces decent but still just way much  actually order some waters prevent myself going into anaphylactic shock   is thing???

Don't wrong food service good but back again  You're paying more atmosphere cool aesthetics food essentially!  TLDR good food service but worth price  <EOR> I sushi often am afraid high end place dive   place decent atmosphere but cold brick ice   girl guy bartenders warm friendly pile rocks   sick analogies yet ok   Bottom line ordered sashimi yellowtail halibut tuna snow crab   2 pieces each And completely overpriced most strip sushi places   However good others   Miso soup martini those pretty decent   hour closing doing everything ready most would do   want home   number customers still stay focused serve customers maybe warm little feel appreciate business   Won't back  <EOR> On arrival pleasantly greated no wait time since made resevations earlier day  decor inside elegant but still modern    Through evening service excellant server herself very helpful walking through house favorites  personally enjoyed  rock shrimp tempura yellowtail serrano miso sauce pork chop amazing   Kumi well worth price spend whole evening sampling great food drink menu just pop couple small dishes kick start your night <EOR> Very unimpressed  eel tuna very fishy tasting  even forgot sauce rolls  hot mess roll meh  worth price quality sub par  Fake crab $21 roll  Really?

Their sushi extremely fresh and know Vegas isn't known having fresh fish fishy all! usually don't raw fish its own but sushi sashimi die for!  Service excellent top made sure everything needed  ordered bottle sake friend insisted getting bowl cucumbers it did no questions asked! My favorite roll all time pop rock roll  Yes pop rocks those candies pop your mouth  Mixed spicy tuna avocado  comes crab or shrimp forgot which but asked roll without it   Their dessert really good well  ordered mochi ice cream carrot cheese cake  Both must but if choose carrot cheese cake die for!!!  I always come back especially since stay Mandalay once year work most convenient best tasting restaurant entire hotel! <EOR> Sure more expensive more exclusive sushi places Las Vegas but thing going most recent visit location   long week working conference center way taxi stand Mandalay we'd good experience other nights during week stopped again    Backtrack few nights prior  another high end sushi place required taxi rides reservations mention credit check possible loan  hear those places seen at line waiting around corner noise level pretty high  Sure all but frankly service little lacking they're REALLY impressed food alcohol  Kumi different  Sure need reservation peak times if conference town  easy if you're working late last day everyone else already left town though!  As side note nice jar sake less price rest your meal    unlike some other places   I don't eat lot sushi but expectation never full eating sushi  more presentation nuances taste overall experience  expect pay fair bit more small amount food  While place pricey way ballpark especially Las Vegas Mandalay Bay    Both times came fish fresh service good pacing well done  didn't come peak time during visit since eating schedule dictated work travel schedules your mileage may vary    As food everything tried least good other places Las Vegas Miso Black Cod crispy pork belly rolls excellent group liked 007 Octopussy which crab salad spicy octopus crispy potatoes roll format  Hot Mess crab avocado sashimi poke screaming O sauce       From late night menu Bao Bun also nice combination flavors good those don't idea eating raw fish pork belly daikon kimchee pickled red onion   They kind enough store luggage didn't clutter dining area   Anyway would come back  <EOR> Tuna flatbread must try!  far best Sushi entire life   Great restaurant highly recommend it  <EOR> Ok highlight atmosphere prompt service!  sushi definitely above average cold hot plates very good   little pricey but guess vegas inside upscale casino bring win some greenbacks! <EOR> RIP OFF!!!!  My wife before 6pm while ordering told Eggplant really?? option substitute $38 Filet Mignon dish Tofu  sashimi quite good but overpriced  tofu just ok  real shocker price dish kept $38  really ok never experienced before  careful while ordering   The servers just don't care any corrections simply said policy  Whatever   I never back! <EOR> Yum! Ordered family style chef's special can't remember called it but basically dish dish delightful food party 6 8  dream Kobe tataki trying it  Yellowtail Serrano crispy rice plates also lovely  Kumi expensive? Yes Kumi's LV Strip resort hotel figure  Drink some sake enjoy unique delicious dining experience  <EOR> I decided eat wanted eat dinner before seeing Michael Jackson Mandalay Bay figured sushi would good meal wasn't heavy before show   Of course though weren't able limit ourselves just ordering sushi  tried pork gyozas which good great but good  pork belly buns which very good  shrimp tempura roll which also quite good but quite great  dessert chocolate lava cake once again very good borderline great   The biggest issue night getting check  whole dinner moved fast which perfect since needed show  However ask multiple different servers three times before someone finally able bring check  While made theater time past time said just adding minor aggravation experience  Nonetheless food ambiance good  Service okay  <EOR> Overall thought food little above mediocre prices somewhat reasonable overpriced  This place high end japanese restaurant don't expect order way might AYCE  example miso soup alone $6 small bottle sake $50  But definitely quality over quantity  start off fish super fresh obviously wouldn't expensive   give them points creativity some dishes delightfully surprising some plain wrong to course    For starter plates definitely try miso cod don't shocked size told considerably large   cooked perfectly! Melts your mouth butter  seared tuna top crispy rice good too  wasn't fan crispy rice part but tuna yummy  Their rolls really stars there  Rolls should order sure hot mess fireball hot! pork belly toro scallions  order pop rock roll! recommended although understand concept watermelon pop rocks compliment sushi did nothing but remind eating candy sushi! never liked pop rocks kid didn't dinner  Atmosphere nice elegant  Service impeccable  hostess really sweet helping high chair nephew putting good table  server helpful recommended best she could  Even food runners really polite presenting your dish   Tip said kid friendly place when called ahead but honest not  great girls night date  <EOR> We high expectations coming but quite disappointed  wasn't food much service  reservations but running few minutes late try getting 7 girls together time LOL  hostesses nice seated   We placed orders waited  food come before sake kinda weird  let waiter know reservations MJ time limit  Despite slow  held onto sake chilled  understand concept restuarant bring food ready but ask sake 4 times  tried order food waiter but he no where found  When found told wanted  When food never came leave he said ordered someone else lie   sucked because automatically charged tip   The food itself mediocre  meat eater friends said kobe tacos meh  ahi tuna starter main pretty good cute presentation  Overall wasn't great  <EOR> Wow totally surprised several recent 1 star reviews!  personally excellent visit Kumi   First all nice short walk hotel room Delano followed another short walk Michael Jackson show dinner?!
