Only 3 tables seated just now person waiting order  Perhaps need hire more kitchen staff  busy times?   Considering place just opened should overstaffed instead understaffed meet demands just opened restaurant! cut employees back few months see business goes  point no plans return location ever! Also sign door closed Mondays training? Seriously every Monday? <EOR> I know came right opening sure would some kinks work out  biggest complaint would inconsistencies spice level    We Thai beef jerky chicken pad Thai chicken fried rice chicken larb  Thai beef jerky good flavor but fattier Id like  Nothing special chicken pad Thai  larb ordered spicy level 4 10 way spicier pad Thai which 8 10  many options kids most everything spicy but liked chicken fried rice staff friendly even though made mess  <EOR> I lived Centennial Hills since 90's welcomed multiple small businesses only disappointed time time  Lemongrass Lime did disappoint  specially appreciated welcoming hostess server Ming  Everything ordered deliciously prepared everyone advised would substantial wait each plate well worth wait  New Business lot heart just needed NW  Thanks manager stopping  Try Lemongrass water Lemongrass Chicken! <EOR> I starters grilled lamb chops pad pak mixed vegetables whole red snapper chili sauce  Blue butterfly specialty drink  waited 30 minutes served well worth it  <EOR> So gross  horrible service  don't even limes!!!
