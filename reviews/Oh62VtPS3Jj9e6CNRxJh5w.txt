My friends 8 people total Banana Leaf since already Riviera   Big big mistake   never experienced such terrible service sentiment shared everyone group   Where begin     We seated right away which wasn't much accomplishment considering only ones there   Nearly 15 minutes sat down someone finally noticed flagging them down orders in   15 minutes later 1 2 guys group soup ordered appetizer the 2nd person never his but due odd choice ingredients complete lack flavor he couldn't eat it   told them wrong solution bring another order scooped same pot   Brilliant!  Eventually 45 minutes sitting down first person group meal   point all starving thirsty requested drink refills never came glad food finally showing up   Nope   again disappointed   food came over span 30 minutes plate time usually passed someone over someone else   guy plate plain rice front nearly 10 minutes while he waited curry chicken   Another guy wait over 10 minutes all side dishes arrive including plate steamed veggies which ended being just steamed lettuce   He complained eventually given plate cold broccoli   Two orders vaguely resembled menu described but only barely     The worst offenders caesar salad orange chicken   ceasar salad took over hour come it last item literally plate plain lettuce cold bits chicken top   Later brought small cup ranch dressing   When told them ceasar salad told all other ingredients come lettuce chicken all could give us   Wonderful!  orange chicken?  poor guy ordered restroom rest night   I mentioned complained food coming something don't normally but end service food terrible speak manager   No apology ever came but ton excuses  cook tickets time even group  huge backlog take orders  new cook etc   Avoid plague  <EOR> Went Saturday night  3 tables besides us  food ok but server????

Never again when Vegas    sad when everyone else Hotel awesome! <EOR> Stayed Riv stopped Banana Leaf breakfast    I stood podium waiting someone seat which realized good 5 minutes wasn't going happen  bartenders attention asked if should seat myself which she replied she would seat me    After being seated looking menu wasn't impressed  Prices somewhat high being offered  classic steak eggs listed 13 99 ordered waiter did seem prompt attentive    The steak grizzly eggs seemed watery potatoes good sure wish came some toast something soak egg yoke though    Here's where things interesting frustrating irritating  check when finished  Realizing left room without wallet being hurry housekeeping could thing figured big deal bill room  WOW mistaken!  I told waiter bill room he told can't system down  He woman whom assume manager told I'd bill room she responded absolutely! then back tracked saying also system down  told money room she just bill room system back she replied NO!  luckily another patron heard going stepped covering could back room  never life embarrassed felt humiliated!

Waited 30 min disgusting looking plate stir fry edible  Sent back because grosssss! Two other people place took over 30minutes order disgusting food   get together people  <EOR> The only reason giving joint 2 stars waitress waiters very good  prices tooooooo high sub mediocre food  Now cheap but $9 99 3 stack average size pancakes no sides ridiculous  $1 99 per egg means fork another $6 bucks 3 scrambled eggs pancakes now $16   Another $1 99 sprinkle cheese added top eggs $18 Cha ching   Add drink we'll round off $20 meal cost $5 lower Denny's  Tab 4 breakfast    $74 over did amount food bought  OK it    I'm Denny's Vegas higher prices expected  Bull shit other restaurants strip better prices better quality better choices better food all way round  hotel sub par other restaurant choices weren't really much better unless your typical neighborhood fast food restaurants did try Wicked Vickie's   hotel needs major over haul if wants continue compete other hotels  buffet closed years ought tell something bout place  Good Luck! <EOR> If could give god forsaken place half star would  But alas don't want ruin its self esteem   Now am kind guy eats somewhere once automatically writes review  understand restaurants good bad days eat place least twice  ate three times verdict fair    My first time eating around 4 a m  although wait staff extraordinary gracious think Monica served food left little desired  ordered chicken rice half chicken came ten minutes later some weird sauces  Now grew Asian family  If don't know sauce probably no good     wasn't  chicken bony made just want pick individual pieces just chomp down but some beautiful women sitting table next controlled myself    Verdict out 10 food 2 service 8  My second time breakfast few days later  late poker tournament but decided needed something stomach know discipline all  quick ordered balls shrimp nice little wonton soup  Ten minutes nothing Let's give another five minutes good food takes time  sat twiddling thumb wondering poker tournament getting along nothing came  Nearly half hour passed before food arrived along water tasted forgive piss    The manager came apologize saying boil water  hell? does take half hour boil water restaurant? wolfed down meal left    As food point didn't care  But just sentence bland boring    Verdict food 2 service 2   Third time's charm right? Nope! here  Drunk last nights Vegas decided give place another try  time ordered Pho Vietnamese noddle soup often comes various cuts beef but know only beef balls it  soup bland meatballs chewy top all no condiments  hell kind restaurants people running?  As wait staff while did nice experience Monica in restaurant only! rest time crap  woman took order slow intellectually couldn't tell which which menu  Don't wrong lot empathy understanding wait staffs understand work long hours properly compensated but Jesus Christ paying customer some goddamn competence?  Lastly waiter different woman took order some odd reason kept calling man  dude am paying customer  We're pals  don't expect 'sir ' but certainly don't want called 'man ' either  Verdict food 2 service 2   My point you're Vegas if you're going spend money elsewhere  If place can't better earn your business you've other choices  Walk down Wynn Red 8  More professional staffs most certainly better food  <EOR> Horrible experience here  friend came because staying riviera located downstairs  initially came coffee bagel cafe right outside restaurant  pastries bagels looked sitting quite some time opted against cafe food ordered restaurant  service incredibly slow  ordered BLT sandwich which mediocre lettuce wilted  tried use check offer free order spring rolls but didn't honor it! said don't allow people use yelp check coupons no explanation why!
