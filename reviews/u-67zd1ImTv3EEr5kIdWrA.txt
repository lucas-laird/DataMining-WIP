Minus eggshell day champagne aluminum other day  Those minor imperfections compared bartenders waiters gift shop staff  Everyone super nice hostesses use little pep when greeting but once inside totally forget even part seating you  <EOR> Good god sat down brunch HIGH expectations    But huge servings terrible food didn't fact still terrible food   Service terrible boot  <EOR> Food good place looks good too  live performance play blues all night long! However price kinda expensive <EOR> Oh god sorry athiest stop    I'm sure going but must all religious   only reason see all great reviews place  YIKES   The food most said just okay  wasn't anywhere near special price over top sad buffet  food just warm  wasn't hot bacon wasn't crispy mac 'n cheese lacked any sort distinct flavor drinks watered down  disappointed   BUT could dealt really music  raised Southern Baptist household the forced religion thing led stop believing anything hence atheist music while yes religious something deeply fond memories of  jubilation reverence all moves me  did until here    What heck? songs weren't traditionally gospel  made think  woman singing talked more she sang when she did sing voice scratchy lacked something  only song recognized Amazing Grace lasted far longer should have  just wasn't impressed think background gospel singing well established  hoping something less showy more reverent really whacked stage show didn't much any gospel ever heard just sad  hoping moved instead left early  seemed wanted convert people  understand 'gospel' show but came hear singing preaching  almost offensive expected them start passing plate any time  Did mention disappointed? disappointed   There lot better places spend your money music here  seemed put circus act  disappointed  expensive! Boo! <EOR> Food service really good  bbq bacon burger  Best burger while  I'd give 5 stars but think bit pricey  $14 cheapest burger seems bit much me  <EOR> The restaurant portion meh  Can't say fan much anything there  Meh drinks beer list  Meh food  Meh service  Meh ambiance    What does redeem restaurant area Rockstar Karaoke currently Friday nights 10 00pm   Live band karaoke best  host so so but moves along quickly lots folks chance sing  band pretty good   So sum skip food but come some karaoke  <EOR> Walked into restaurant sat great experience moment boyfriend sat down  Marissa saw weren't greeted server yet waters right away  Later boyfriend accidentally spilled some water Marissa top wipe down didn't even feel bad spilling it  best part all she wasn't even server during meal  Thanks awesome food service definitely back! <EOR> Mediocre time around   bacon avocado eggs Benedict side chorizo   Bacon bit tough avocado over ripe chorizo bland some grit   wife twisted side pancake she liked all   Service Jason waiter very good he great attitude  <EOR> Absolutely WORST service ever had  Well actually none!  ended leaving  only 10 customers whole restaurant other bar happy hour  All staff walking around nothing do!

Somebody mentioned speakers loud did find issue but much un enjoyable  <EOR> I fair share HOB venues teen years say Las Vegas really lives reputation city never sleeps! artwork design venue amazing really all location  slightly smaller others but better show experience plus second level those lucky enough seat tickets! Haha   You tell Pit Girl but doesn't over crowded venue  Unlike other HOB locations LV location smart capacity limits  pit whole time never felt suffocated violated without discression h ey  Marilyn  Manson concert OK? into guy since pre teen! Anyway crowd control amazing show amazing bar was eh    The bar  paid $14 sprite  supposed midori sour cocktail but just tasted sprite person DOESN'T drink very often didn't even affect whatsoever  Weak drinks  Pre game your hotel room before hand  Your little sister probably mix better drinks!  I would definitely see another show convenient comfortable relatively schedule  only thing HATED? only venue EVER did allow closed bottle water hydration issue!!! <EOR> 4 stars based solely venue set up   really liked balcony seats row could easily see stage without having stand floor all night long   decor quite interesting too  when you're looking something entertain because 2nd opening band rubbish  What did freaking cold there! wearing jeans t shirt jacket shivered throughout entire show   actually bought long sleeved t shirt merch table because couldn't handle being cold any longer!   Maybe evil plan?? The drinks super expensive but think all expect any venue  <EOR> 5 Stars??!! Vegas HOB??!!  Really?  Yeah     here's why        wife stay Vegas way much  love Mandalay Bay    Invariably check playing HOB downstairs plunk down money generally great deal see band which passing interest   I've blown away some bands Porcupine Tree pleasantly surprised others Joe Satriani Styx Flogging Molly Some drunkin mess  I'm looking Joe Rogan All entertaining  <EOR> We came Happy Hour half price appetizers drink specials  guy playing acoustic guitar pretty good opinion  girls worked said pretty much every weekday performing during Happy Hour  nice addition experience    We had margarita pizza just OK better spinach dip good but served sort potato chip thing didn't care for chicken wings bed coleslaw I guess wings small but flavorful coleslaw average reported since eat meat Voodoo Shrimp excellent  served cornbread yummy!

Getting place Because purchased tickets advance THANK GOD line shorter  Once doors opened pretty fast  given little tid bit offered where could find released thang food   lol  The food AMAZING  Fresh Fruit carved turkey ham baked chicken friend chicken made order omelette fresh waffles biscuits etc Any type eater find something liking   The performers AMAZING    interactive audience really felt church  song choice point everyone stage great voice   I can't wait return!!! <EOR> The food ok charged entry fee did eating there  sat bar charged felt much  didn't receive great service yet charged extra  <EOR> Other decor restaurant very average  Burgers sandwiches salads  Rueben sweet potato fries  could gone any other place spent half much just good food  If come many just want opt drink save your money food somewhere better  <EOR> Happen come Santana    venue seems small rock concert weird layout   Friends ours bought tickets can't complain but arrangement club seems vertical useful   top level only see top performers heads though sounds good given where sitting might well put CD comfort own home   The entrance doesn't seem well positioned security arrangements start right entrance restaurant rather then away would expect everyone haven't before would ask hostess whether Santana playing here   Overall think venue needs little bit rearranging but pretty functional bars everything  <EOR> Every time atmosphere great service consistent friendly food amazing! yet bad food shitty service  <EOR> I've venue several times kind shocks yet review it    but then remember every experience mediocre   The bands themselves fine better don't wrong   venue itself just miserable   pretty cramped pillars pretty obnoxious see anything if slightly off side another all   Drinks expensive but shouldn't shock anyone since Strip   The sound really disdain place   just so    awful   pay decent money ticket because House Blues plus Vegas plus usually rather known band   what?  Sub par barely better the local bar sound?  Tiny little TVs barely see what's happening on stage?  Pushy bathroom attendants?  All combined really hate going here   Ever   Even when favorite bands seen several times other venues   sound jarbled muddy   don't know if your sound system your sound crew but seriously fix it  <EOR> Not only great concerts but breakfast bomb  Fast service great food  Can't wait come back  <EOR> We stopped last day breakfast    All House Blues locations usually eclectic decor  great  just dark there!  I knew wanted french toast  But saw other things menu wanted without blowing budget come plan  3 egg omelet andouille sausage onion bacon  YUM  chock full ingredients weren't just hidden between folds eggs bursting seams  delicious filling side french toast kids' menu!   Our server bit scattered  He nice though  cousin didn't response though when she asked drink  Sometimes just want know if restaurant coke pepsi products  He asked she'd drink question have? He pointed bar  answer  Obviously there's bar but else there? Anyway coffee  good too  <EOR> I hadn't venue since 2009  great place concerts  Large enough great sound crow vibes small enough feel you're really part show   I saw Billy Idol's residency show chose upgrade VIP seating  disappointed  food amazing  service stellar   I don't frequent concerts but now when HoB! <EOR> the only times shows during punk rock bowling  every time blast  think best show saw first gimme gimmes    sound always point crowd seemed really chill    but then again would know chillin vip bands   hahaha   suckers!!!! <EOR> Had dinner family last night very impressed! food delicious server amazing   very busy but server wonderful! Live music really nice also  steak salad w balsamic vinegerette dressing choice came grilled asparagus potatoes die for! salad some cornbread croutons mouthwatering!! good drink prices highly recommend Watermelon Slammer fav!! regret coming here! <EOR> This where ribs vegas plus pulled pork sdwh very good if want civil tear off rib bones might mess clubbing gear   sauce good course ask more side actually warm boy does difference   drench it   don't forget rosemary just wandered time going back whenever im town   However ribs seem lil small prob kill 2 racks  but its vegas didn't expect good ribs here  <EOR> I ordered traditional eggs Benedict   Canadian bacon rubbery   English muffin difficult cut through  eggs almost cooked all way through providing very little yolk   hollandaise sauce hollandaise sauce   hash browns soggy watery bland   dish reminded sub par cafeteria food   lighter note did enjoy cheddar biscuits   service outstanding   $25 probably better off going buffet cafe  <EOR> Great place but pretty small venue  Walk Moon concert 16+ but no security walking around making sure kids weren't using drugs which were no dehydrating etc    Also HOT there! know concert but musty there  I'd definitely think twice before seeing show again  <EOR> Came around 6 20 maybe darn just missed happy hour! asked hostess opinion show catch 7 30 would enough time eat should somewhere else? She said we'd fine usually takes 45 minutes seated   We asked waitress Yelp deal gives free appetizer order entree she said she'd check manager first because might only accept printed coupons  C'mon hon deal checking Yelp your mobile phone if expect people print then going yell you  when she comes back she ends saying she thinks okay but another waiter taking over table when pay just bring deal him  ordered chicken quesadilla appetizer BF sandwiches I think chicken sweet potato fries upgrade  Then waited waited waited  waiter already refilled water glasses twice then continued wait think he just started avoid table altogether  maybe 7 10 finally just stopped asked much longer food would he said he would check  He came back food asked check ask Yelp deal all over again   BF's order did sweet potato fries no way did time exchange though  irritated when began eat kind okay well pretty yummy    pretty much only thing saving them review because still irritated communication between workers service overall  Yes friendly but geez  hostess knew rush but never bothered let servers know? when switch servers should updating server replacing anything regarding table don't tell customer re explain something new server  understand situation little different because rush begin but if going wait long just receive food would've appreciated being told door should consider eating somewhere faster    Most dishes overpriced but Yelp deal did worth eating thanks Yelp! Rather unpleasant experience but food blame <EOR> WU TANG!!!! Hell yes!! place smoky gross close sweaty just venue should be! Plus slip without tickets if grease nice pretty case your bodyguard it  close stage everyone could smell method man's blunt  <EOR> At Mandalay Bay breakfast options buffet Seabreeze Cafe HOB   I am fan MB Buffet service Seabreeze tends incredibly slow even when busy   During 3 night stay ate HOB each morning     No fuss standard weekday Breakfast special Two Eggs Hash Bacon Toast perfectly portioned fresh excellent value strip standards   Coffee good   Skip overpriced OJ       No wait   Quick Service     Occasionally also find 2 1 coupons Las Vegas Advisor MyVegas  <EOR> The food yummy but gospel portion wasn't expected   thought going able see some major choir action but turned small family singing group lead vocal kept looking watch see much more singing he needed do  think sang total 5 6 songs or  felt like   Kayla B  mentions set really short 30 minutes   wish seen Kayla's review before went   any case wanted echo thoughts  <EOR> Venue Review!

When some deep bass lines some songs literally feel bass pounding right through your body!    So overall would say ok experience both times here  Its just those negatives still didnt matter performing  <EOR> We came drinks  ordered Bloody Mary friend ordered Grey Goose tonic  Drinks STRONG  really liked interior bar tender super friendly  Drinks expensive  would come back check food  <EOR> The music nice but cost ridiculous  Two pastas CUP soup $81!! $20 entertainment fee attached bill top 2 other taxes  won't back  <EOR> Our group accidentally House Blues during 2 6 happy hour great great deal couple hits misses   The carribean jerk chicken wings big hit! wings themselves huge since both wing drumsticks  seasoning them delicious hits great balance spicy savory sweet  I beef street tacos those major miss  tiny dry lacking any flavor  The pulled pork sliders somewhere between other dishes bit dry flavorful but still satisfying   The best thing whole thing total came $25 4 dishes  great value opinion filled good   It also good note menu Las Vegas location abbreviated version other locations  <EOR> I give bar happy hour 4  bartenders super friendly dranks cheap $3 beers food menu good  margherita pizza delicious  Next door little club  wasn't very busy night I highly doubt happening place but great place if all want your dance on   The restaurant other hand hot ass mess  1 star  fam lunch pretty excited because menu created Aaron Sanchez foodnetwork chef   mom ordered fish day dad rib eye cousin te lobster Mac cheese bf Jamaican burger juicy lucy burger  First off waited forever food   But let slide because 5 us  Second food finally came cousins lobster Mac cheese sans lobster  lastly mom found piece plastic wrapper veggies  called manager over told lobster plastic  All he said  kitchen learning new menu he'd send some new veggies take care it  Then waiter gave wrong check mom never side veggies  But end day 50% off bill    The rib eye super tender yummy  juicy Lucy burger tasty fattie bf love burger  fish day swordfish but tiny ass serving size toddler's palm  lobster Mac cheese also yummy but sure don't forget lobster    All all definitely won't returning crossroads restaurant  food ok good but service WORST  part bothers most no apologetic anything  But probably bar cheap beer  <EOR> We came world famous Gospel lunch Mother's Day  very ok  table seating bit squished  food deserves 2  tasteless no attention detail  forgot put cream cheese lox cream cheese bagels example  no gravy carvery station meat dry  fruit pastry station very under catered   mac cheese which next scrambled eggs no where near omelette station cold    The show itself ok too  couldn't really hear singers all well  thought would more fun  <EOR> Like size place  ton shows here  Always good time  Used service night Sundays  All around cool place locals <EOR> Well    came late lunch trade show    probably best time experience place  While food bad far memorable  <EOR> I booked last minute trip Vegas when found cheap plane ticket realized second favorite band Steel Panther playing weekend  much love Steel Panther much ruin kick ass shows   I kinda hated venue    The night started off rough when forced remove belt check $3 or option bring back car    because   yeah right  Everyone cabs Vegas hotel mile half away   belt studded but studs flat definitely weren't going hurt anywhere  yet security didn't confiscate bracelet huge spikes which according sign saw upon arriving prohibited  Dumb    The actual space inside lot character but if front row stage awkwardly high a foot above eye level 6'0 which uncomfortable viewing experience  Drinks also outrageously expensive  even Vegas  If want tipsy show don't bother trying here  $11 shot cheapest rail whiskey and extra small shot glass just ridiculous  concert venue Vegas gonna pricey   but shocked    Of course Steel Panther always kicks ass  much energy freaking funny  fifth time seeing them I'd seen them 3 other states 4 other venues previously really sad see set cut short  changed set played all songs I'd never heard live before which super cool but then cut set short! don't know if House Blues policy something but show ended pretty early around 12 30    and no encore! First time seen them didn't return encore play Community Property Party All Day  pretty bummed  could've watched them play hours more  Also Steel Panther shows always wild inappropriate little nude but House Blues apparently stricter limits they'll allow compared other venues    If band love playing Vegas they're only playing suppose I'd return  But definitely first choice venue  <EOR> Had very good experience waiter named Anthony right top things great server   great food back <EOR> Went breakfast  Food great  Service great  Price great  heard place very lively night well  Would definitely recommend  <EOR> Not fan venue   Standing Room Only concept when empty tables doesn't lot sense   Also between bands guests wait toooooo long  bands took 40 minutes setup  <EOR> We saw Santana November 4 2017 House Blues Las Vegas  hands down best concert ever lives! He amazing crowd excited well behaved  probably 40 feet VIP seating well worth price  food great service excellent  special guest Quinn Sullivan extraordinarily talented young man  don't generally seeing same person frequently but would definitely back very soon House Blues Las Vegas see Santana live concert  <EOR> The first time male server gave poorest service ever life! far worst server seen! server self things he doing absolutely ridiculous! Took longer 10 mins greet ! Starving having short time frame eat game decided wanted order before he stopped greet us   Taking drink order told actually ready order food well  Shortly taking 3 6 orders he tells aunt Hold second walks away grabs utensils another tables drops off couple tables down  doing he returns continues taking order  does that? Right middle taking order? Something should ever done  girlfriend weren't hungry ordered salad asked come everyone else's food  Around 7 mins later he comes drops off salad without everyone else's food course  Knowing sharing he did give another plate any silverware all! Just simply dropped off salad walked away without saying word  He wouldn't stop check all still stop ask silverware    rest food took long time come salad well  food came he drops off never seen again  empty cups wanting refills again stop him  remembering mango ice tea he poured regular tea cup told mango  He leaves returns little cup syrup hand just pours into iced tea  Yes know flavored iced teas regular tea mixed flavored syrup but professional your server just fill your flavored iced tea pitcher regular just pour syrup top front you? would never don't think any server would ever think doing so  worst service ever      My gf loves buffalo crispy chicken salud another shot damn    Service just great all    Let alone being rude friendly anyway  first time busy but now really don't want spend dollar people flat rude  server rude? <EOR> This review strictly entertainment Santana   really looking forward seeing hearing legend music   He reason came Vegas long weekend   Here's warning if thinking doing same    Bring your earplugs!  Although change music little bit least save your hearing   music much loud smaller venue   House Blues holds under 2 000 people   something sound engineers need keep mind   large arena 20 000+ where Santana used perform   When first song started looked each other said fine   fourth song holding ears run because hurt   didn't even say anything older gentleman elevator why leaving he said if think  loud should hear band downstairs   wonder why loud?  enjoyable anyone  <EOR> My husband friends wanted eat someplace where could sit down relax long day long walks decided check blues  nice  expecting performance but wasn't anything going when came but oh well food still good  service great  nice place come dinner relax chat sober up  wouldn't mind coming back again  gave 4 because little dark there    its theme but still    I'd little more light  <EOR> Went House Blues twice 2 days  service pretty bad   Dinner 6 7 party 12  acted doing favor!

Then burgers came well   best  husband heat seeker cooked medium  came well done few jalapeños unbearably hot he loves spicy food  sweet potato fries cold some actually tasted raw sure frozen fries didn't cook all way   I BBQ burger again came well done dry  looking good juicy burgers but just didn't happen   Our server nice! think pass house blues next time food  would back drink entertainment! <EOR> Great happy hour beer prices!  seen show but eaten three times   came twice dinner once breakfast   QUICK TIP Eat dinner buy 1 free coupon breakfast next day!  fan! <EOR> Visiting RCPM concert  several times band well Santana  great venue small concerts  Beer ice ice cold but extremely expensive  During visit dropped $300 alcohol bottled water sure much friends spent but probably close same  We're even big drinkers  3 1 2 hours   Sound lights good service quick  continue attend events always great time  <EOR> I high hopes place called The House Blues especially since located inside such lavish casino but pretty let down   The acoustics terrible  could barely hear opening artists saying  Gary Allan meh concert but would great better venue  Plus people packed tiny bar sardines  No spot guaranteed  nearly into huge fight some very rude people left   Conclusion highly doubt would come back! Oh also tried drink bar showed ID bartender  He wouldn't serve because didn't wrist band  didn't catch memo but people next said didn't even show ID wristband  HMMMM!!! <EOR> The restaurant awesome food very good!!!

Nope 2 3 more songs concert ended early   The ticket prices ridiculous venue $60 fees general admission    even worse knowing concert still least 30 more minutes   only did feel unsafe because venue but also essentially stole $20 $30 me   EDIT employee contacted through yelp regarding review apologized bad experience   appreciate it   also sent some letters some managers directors well   try update further if anything happens   All said review remain 1 star experience venue   would take lot return re evaluate rating   would re evaluate without actually returning   EDIT2 House Blues responded letter sent gift card compensate bad experience   very happy responded complaints   Hopefully soon updated review much better experience share  <EOR> My mom came late night snack during recent trip Vegas impressed  Basically both food drinks pretty awful  mom ordered Mai Tai ordered BBQ Pineapple Mojito  First off love mojitos especially love pineapple  Unfortunately drink bad couldn't drink send back  watered down didn't taste pineapple didn't taste any sort mojito ever mint floating but didn't taste mint funky flavor unappealing  waitress very nice apologized offered different drink  politely declined since tasted Mai Tai just okay  feeling rest cocktails weren't going hit spot  only good thing mom liked drink because very strong    Additionally mom hungry she decided order Grilled Vegetable flatbread basil pesto goat cheese mozzarella cheese roasted artichoke hearts broccolini roasted red onion micro basil leaves  something wrong this  took bite could take another  off flavor couldn't tell was  Maybe bread? Maybe pesto? veggies? bitter sour     possibly fermented? sure  However since already sent drink back mom didn't want send food back she continued eat but without any gusto enthusiasm    Overall place extremely crowded waitstaff understaffed food drinks awful don't think back  If area try another place  <EOR> We stopped quick breakfast before flight service outstanding  Aune swooped took order perfectly top coffee refills all time catch flight    We ate some expensive restaurants far best service next time Vegas heading breakfast  <EOR> This review only restaurant itself music venue    I've restaurant twice now usual holiday meeting  take bigger conference room back restaurant since quite few us  both times coworkers amazing experience    Their service point here  waiters super patient serving big group ours  Some coworkers bit demanding but staff always whatever asked for  food always came within reasonable time  portions food ridiculous bit pricey but worth it    The food good  don't remember ordered first time but time ordered meatball sliders  meatball rich flavor marinara sauce wasn't tart  bread still some crunch toasting which like  also ordered House Blues salad which thought just blah  lettuce little wilted could used more dressing  know coworkers enjoyed food since everyone raving good everything was  did eat few sweet potato fries someone's plate  could cooked little soft when but into them    I enjoyed coming meeting  definitely beats having meetings stock rooms  definitely back next one  <EOR> Great venue see Billy Idol last night  Only reason why five stars couple issues ticket price bit high 200 bucks each 200 section  Sat directly under air conditioner vent freezing  bar slowest seen years  gave 10 min but luckily server came ordered her  location impossible see entire stage  Especially when people front stood up  would suggest seats directly facing stage but cost you! going 300 bucks!! severs great but wait line bars! Amateur bar tenders really slow!!! <EOR> Only sat bar area happy hour however very pleased service  Hosts all friendly bartenders extremely quick serve made excellent recommendations no wait all between apps drinks  most definitely Wil come again! <EOR> I came first time couple weeks back Blue October show  big fan!   First off House Blues little different  built into Mandalay Bay casino little disconcerting  Even more odd House Blues preserves House Blues theme middle gaudy casino floor  looks little off   All changes when inside  Inside your typical House Blues  Restaurant front concert theater back    We fortunate enough secret James Brown private room overlooks stage back  own cocktail waitress brought drinks all night also sampled menu    Of food remember Chipotle Chicken w Hominy Delicious! recommend ordering highly  good you'll want lick plate seriously!

<EOR> We decided since hitting concert HOB might well eat there  pleasantly surprised  food quite good service stellar  server Tyler exceptional  highly recommend HOB's meatloaf    <EOR> I bit disappointed presentation especially resting Mandalay Bay  looked just Friday's never house Blues before but sure supposed feel you're eating TGI Friday's  strangest decor ever seen painted crosses covered bottle caps paintings disfigured people walls   They decent happy hour going $5 well drinks $3 beers  ordered 3 appetizers came happy hour deal nachos cheese hot wings chicken tenders while sat ate bar drinking beers  grabbed Blue Moon stuffed purse  <EOR> Didn't try food review really bar happy hour specials     Came 30 minutes before end happy hour couple hours gambling casino happy did much cheaper spend $3 beers lose $100 free casino great selection beers bottles bartender VERY generous pours liquor     The bar filled cougars kept hitting friend very funny   Clientele seemed bit older usually see bars frequent around 40 60 years old average age  <EOR> VEGETARIAN REVIEW Happy find somewhat affordable place Mandalay Bay   really didn't want spend $30+pp gut busting meal long day travel being little before 10pm wanting decent veggie option tough find something fit bill   The breakdown *Ambiance cool decor good music 4 stars *Staff pleasant helpful 4 stars *Food   Fiancé Fried Chicken potatoes veggies said flavorful tender but greasy $17 99 3 stars   I'm vegetarian child's mac cheese plus side veggies mac yummy!

should swapped cole slaw Mac cheese  also ordered ribs  Don't order ribs  aren't soft rough  only ate rib  Wasted money  asked check waitress rush cleared plates guess didn't even notice ribs weren't touched  would think she'd ask offer something else but sitting long paid left  <EOR> First time HOB really liked place  came boyfriend concert really venue  would definitely come back other events great spot anywhere are  Prices tall boys reasonable  <EOR> Waaaaay overpriced pay few more bucks top notch restaurant MB  cheap elsewhere   The salmon special incredible but pasta bland noodles catsup  service amazing however thanks Lisa saved day  She them sauce into rose me    Overall fun place all HOB's but really steep budget traveler  <EOR> This favorite places see concert long orchestra level seats   much fan standing around packed general admission area getting shoved around stepped on   HOB pretty small though even if GA ticket its bad   drink prices reasonable considering concert venue strip   There private bar orchestra level stage scene any position huge hassle refill while show going on   really fact security strict people sneaking second level if don't tickets seat there   way never gets crowded even sold show    Another thing worth noting volume level never seems loud soft but just right   Unlike shows scene elsewhere never left show feeling I'd lost 90% hearing week after   Some shows attended HOB include Citizen Cope Charlie Murphy Everclear Third Eye Blind Dierks Bentley She Wants Revenge Bravery   all great! <EOR> The hostess Claudia awesome she explained everything works use coupons where different seating arrangements decided sit happy hour section where Booths awesome bartender manager duty very thorough informative use Vegas comps  food great <EOR> We seen many shows here  Steel Panther Dan Band just last week  love venue  mostly standing seats which first come first serve   sat upstairs several times  recently bought table  Any spot great  staff Call awesome hostess waitresses rock  Always clean venue  Restrooms always attendant  Drink prices bit pricey but bad strip  always feel very safe inside  security top notch! décor throughout crazy cool  love it  Highly recommend definitely come back again again  <EOR> Medium food high prices staff keeps change  <EOR> Now many show House Blues  venue amazing intimate shows always good dance party  Recently advertising local specials drinks  am guessing attract more local traffic am sure decreased opening Cosmo they're great line shows  see Panic! Disco whom all fans of  show great but when asked local drink specials told bartender he no idea talking about  Meanwhile television screen behind advertisements playing pointed told Everyone pays same price   Hey House Blues if want pay $10 tall boy PBR will  Just don't tell it'll cheaper  BOOOOOOOOOO! <EOR> Outstanding   Just very much fun   _loads_ great food throughout southern style buffet carving station salad dessert bars couple other areas can't put specific description but just stuffed edible goodness   There's free orange juice water bloody mary's mimosas $4 25 [and latter excellent]   time doors open 30 45 minutes eat talk before band singers come on   still eat during performance but hard pull away  musicians energized full life really crowd going   I think I'd give 4 5 if could   But pretty much only because gospel _choirs_ even better small gospel groups  just wanted hear place rock without speakers blaring  Not sound bad all  just greedy! definitely back! <EOR> The service slow shocked didn't serve any fish  fish day shirmp spinich  Now claim cajun serve any fried fish any crystals hot sauce? <EOR> One best venues see rock show!

Friends wanted see Fortunate Son CCR tribute band  16 bucks ticket tribute ok  Then tell would sit? MF'ers then charge 25 bucks sit table  Dishonest thieves! <EOR> If your foodie may place you!!! Nothing spectacular over top  No lasting memory food experience here  <EOR> I only comment House Blues concert venue   twice both times see Roger Clyne Peacemakers perform say venue itself awesome!  Very cool vibe open spacious although still gives feeling being small   decor lighting feel though transported different city  prefer standing room concerts move closer setting more intimate  almost seems private concert just band   crowd really gets into bands feel energy!  Although friends told HOB Las Vegas shoulder shoulder crowded events both times perfect     The bar area elevated stairs ramp leading down floor area   Even being 5 ft 2 never felt struggle see over person front me   sound quality also awesome!  The only complaint any concert venue bar beer selection   Although super easy beer no lines prices pretty ridiculous   $26 two Coronas okay king cans Corona but still little insane   But again  expected when you're see concert   A definite plus being Vegas venue band able play past midnight almost 3 half hours unlike lot places where cut off early!  House Blues Vegas favorite concert venues! <EOR> We Santana concert Sept 22     bought VIP seats lower level   information received little sketchy   was told concert started 7 really started 8pm   course completely interfered dinner reservations leave concert early    The seats amazing   about 30 40 feet stage  I would highly recommend springing more expensive seats!! <EOR> I corn bread  HOB corn bread best had    ever  honey maple butter thing it    sheeee man!

Huge lights saying House Blues  let's main part review   Venue venue actually quite small terms stages  upper floor seating other shows besides concerts but rating strictly concert venue  floor surrounded bar area drinks easily accessible any time  far concerts prefer smaller venues bigger ones because seem more intimate  Being able feel close band perform no matter where pretty neat  means won't miss beat! Haha music joke put guards front stage during concerts most places actually really good place lean between sets if lucky enough front don't plan moving anytime soon  also nicely decorated  love chandelier middle place tinted glass windows whole vibe place gives off  great rock band venue    Service people work times nice personable  mean come hard when see free shows right? Right  any case booze always easily accessible  cool part during concerts if those lucky people against guard rail right front stage waitress comes around between guard rail stage take drink orders don't move  BONUS! didn't anything drink though because drink prices venues scare me  rich blood  actual people charge watching event let little fun but appropriate thing when bad stuff down  also help crowd surfers    This great place see concert especially if rock fan  mood atmosphere small venue easy mosh drink and or enjoy yourself  If know somebody coming Vegas feel going show hopefully lucky House Blues  <EOR> We stopped quick bite evening  food ok  prices seem bit high but expected Vegas guess  But highlight visit server! waiter Kurt he friendly helpful  Ask seated section great experience  <EOR> Accessibility Parking Wait Time 1 1 Star no wait   _____  Service Waiter Cleanness Ambiance 1 1 Star normal service  Fun Ambiance lot things look at    _____  Taste 0=Not Edible 1=Edible 2=Good average 3=Must Try! 2 3 Stars steak good  Pasta good    _____  Overall Experience  4 5 Stars   _____  Last Words I didn't really music but food good  <EOR> The review bar area  food just ok  Service also just ok  Liked decorations bar  walked around whole place really nice cool features  also small retail store inside  <EOR> SOOO impressed!!!! posted review immediately contacted house blues staff Sahsha Brian Klein Tim J  impressed fast responded situation hand   very apologetic professional accommodating above beyond turn bad situation into AMAZING memory   told numerous friends family clients incredible  experience House Blues rocks   could disaster now made bigger fan can't wait back  Venue AWESOME very intimate service outstanding  HIGHLY recommend House Blues close personal music experience service unmatched any other   THANKS HOUSE BLUES  MAUREES <EOR> The drinks good pricey but really? threw coupons discount store deals once stepped Vegas strip  didn't band when just check see when bands playing site  artichoke dip bread pudding good can't enjoy those things much pre house blues Jessica did  standards raised  want try closer where live but place great food wise waiter distracted something seated dad leper section apparently everyone else entire restaurant all seated half football field distance away where told sit  bread pudding though try it! don't care your diet eat bread! <EOR> This first stop night  some drinks vibe casual relaxing  noise level wasn't loud able converse normally  certainly enjoyed time here! <EOR> This second favorite house blues to  staff incredible venue itself nice  multiple times see Steel Panther spent many birthdays stage them! HOB lot seating upstairs too!!! Love sure too! <EOR> Steel Panther!!!  Steel Panther does show every Friday   highly reccomend that   drinks overpriced but show free worth it   No seats unless pay VIP which REALLY expensive   But plenty room stand around rock out  <EOR> We bit worried food would mediocre below because similarities Hard Rock Cafe  happily surprised!! wife meatloaf loved every bite it  Cajun pasta while truly spicy sauce table made that  1 star constant self promotional commercials running every TV  Including big screen stage  Why couldn't play videos concert footage? <EOR> I stayed Mandalay Bay conference private event evening   The food pretty good   Sliders tasty pulled pork meatball best   angus just meh shrimp grits delicious jambalaya    Bartenders great drinks good music selection everyone dancing   place cool look vibe   So why only two stars?  HOB suffers same issue Chicago   music deafening!  standing beside someone trying conversation all social event connection conference shouting each other heard actually turned music up!  just looked each other laughed because even though three inches each other there's no way could continue conversation   Thankfully big cheeses conference able them turn down notch 10 minutes later but time left ears ringing voice hoarse shouting     If there's live band guess  thing but just cranking loud everyone stand no interaction because physically loud converse  terribly fun book   guess must corporate decision since loud music seems consistent but don't think I'd choose another HOB future because actually interact people with   Except maybe Houston because location okay   Side note If search word loud reviews 26 hits   Most them complain being loud  <EOR> Drinks took 20 minutes  Food decent very generic  service horrible  kids menu photo copied  crayons clearly 99cent store  spinach artichoke dip only spinach dip  sangria HORRIBLE  <EOR> Really awesome staff very welcoming atmosphere  Would recommend come great breakfast  <EOR> We did sunday brunch music good food good but great  enjoyable would mind going back again  Something spiritual Sunday morning  <EOR> I came dinner but dismay every other dining option Mandalay Bay ridiculous waits  menu hodge podge heart attack inducing foods random influences would expect all calories would taste good but instead completely bland gross  service poor food took forever come even night when place only half full  noise level obscene  half meal horrible crooner screaching into mic made impossible hear person sitting next you  second band half decent least made end meal bit more enjoyable fun  <EOR> 2 5 stars  The venue seemed nice thought decent seats since 3rd row back section 200 row C however upon sitting down found incline safety bars obstructed view degree almost never could see anything stage without bars way  sure why dont clear glass railings? Ticketmaster didnt mention obstructed view may want see if seat map showing if obstructions definitely would paid more $$$ seat could see!  Disappointing sound quality speakers always clear   Tall cans beer whooping $14 each   Heineken Corona Bud light paps   Billy Idol great though!!! <EOR> My wife going Thursday night dinner House Blues many years enjoy seeing some favorite local bands play during dinner  Last night first time couple months severely disappointed   To start night off poorly hostess placed essentially casino floor farthest table stage  asked if could empty tables closer stage being told no no server section  Before drink order taken people seated those empty tables   Then looking menu even more disappointed aggravated  expect pay more normal restaurant prices eat House Blues  However $3 99 ice cream scoop luke warm cold mashed potatoes same price equal amount snap peas asinine    Their entire menu drastically gone price down selection  None good items available anymore   The only reason two stars marked talking floor managers she apologized illogical reason permitted sit quality tables moved better section comp'd some drinks dessert  servers also pretty top things    After having first bad experience restaurant tilted night's mood  <EOR> Great breakfast!

PS bouncer right front huge   Don't dare think climbing stage     The main floor appeared mostly packed chose spot right behind railing upper bar   View good bit confused VIP maybe? area behind sound booth where few people hanging out   Sound quality bit muffled but maybe just hard time understanding lyrics banter onstage   Still wasn't most superb   I spotted two bars close behind where stood    plenty room purchasers bar crowd watching show higher level second bar left side room   Both bars extremely overpriced considering liquor prices Vegas opted out     *Shows upcoming band lineup looked great   I'd definitely consider  a late night concert Vegas easily     *Location Easy find Mandalay Bay  *Parking cinch   Vegas good parking   Free self parking all over place!    *Price Seemed reasonable $20    If local LV could into Steel Panther show saw HOB free   said there's no such thing free show?  exists here  <EOR> Took hour food did even silverware until food  busy    Two stars because manager compensated greatly inconvenience  Food good manager hooked afterwards  <EOR> I come House Blues concerts all time! time tried restaurant awesome  can't believe yet eat there  actually just tacos actually best tacos ever American bar  fish tacos steak tacos  highly recommend it! service great too! food came good timing too! sure stop some food before concert! <EOR> Wow! reminded why place much  Angel server today he always smiling kept coffee tipped off   I am only rarely Las Vegas but when am where eat breakfast   Wink <EOR> We group friends  food decent nothing special  service very slow took over 30 minutes just bill  Then waitress disappeared again  also charged entertainment tax  singer but seated different room where couldn't even see entertainment  think unfair charge tax when couldn't even enjoy live music  <EOR> First all if halves I'd give place 4 1 2 stars  Staff friendly maybe because myself felt sorry   started off Coors light half haha when brought steak salad  Steak pieces perfect  ordered medium well but medium  Delicious  Salad great!

Wow!  mortified!  She said needed reservations   was any given time 3 5 available tables   no time all full   Busy but never full     Any ordered food subpar   friends gumbo looked more dog food even edible   During time daughters performing stage   KNEW 2 other people table but moved together 2 tables party 8 close ours daughter could even sit down coming off stage     Then different waiter came over said shift change he check   Well a specifically asked separate checks b still planned ordering kid ready close bill!  He very nice definitely blame mixup     Anyhow leaving soon someone put reserved tag table   Again rushing!  Sad say unless daughter another event back   sad because actually liked venue but rudest thing ever experienced  <EOR> * used restaurant com gift certificate lunch   * steak salad just ok   * wished Gospel brunch instead just regular restaurant area   * think place better dinner lunch fare  think more lively   <EOR>
