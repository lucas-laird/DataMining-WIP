I would recommend any Vegas local worth trip Strip if tourist  <EOR> I've craving aren't many hot pot places Vegas  wish closer location since closer Silverado Ranch area almost 30 minute drive   The first thing noticed induction burners every seat set kind bar seating  really liked that  lot nicer carrying burner only having burner per table another place to   There's three broths choose shabu shabu sukiyaki spicy miso  only spicy miso comes 2 dipping sauces picked ponzu citrus soy sauce gomu sesame sauce   They're all very flavorful offer green onion garlic radish Japanese chili powder soy sauce spicy drops  spicy miso isn't spicy added bit more spice   I ordered combo plate lunch geisha size  comes 5oz Yojie's cut angus steak 5oz salmon sashimi bowl white brown rice bowl veggies some udon noodles  pretty good size portion even if just order Geisha size single item 5 thin sliced pieces meat  Last time couldn't finish everything able cook broth take home guess really hungry finished everything today  sure differences between lunch dinner sizes  Maybe dinner more veggies noodles?  Overall really place  food very flavorful fresh good variety menu  There's never wait when come lunch  bit tricky find since big plaza but right next Joy Yee's  <EOR> I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY wished service could better! Because food absolutely delicious    But coming every time always internal debate because takes long seated your order taken receive food eventually receive check pay  seems only staff service during peak hours doesn't adequately train staff importance sense urgency which turn turning service into vicious cycle eternal waiting   Last time when friend took them hour 60 minutes!! bring dessert ordered  fruit fondue four strawberries half banana 5 6 pieces cubes pre made cake  escaped could cutting such minimal food take entire hour?! asked progress 3 times during hour every time told server might just cancel dessert she assured would come within 2 minutes  promise never kept    All all good food  But frustrating dine unless least 2 hours spare sitting restaurant searching your waiter  <EOR> I'm California definitely miss Shabu there  Love opened yojie here! regular now going regular here!

This shabu place set bar didn't it  Maybe also family style hot pot? guess hip new modern shabu shabu    The customer service great attentive but little smothering  understand soft opening but being asked how's food every 10 minutes does much  really did waitress through whole entire menu since we're first timers Yojie    I ordered sukiyaki pasteurized egg Yojie cut geisha size  broth honestly way sweet taste  even diluted water  really did egg all condiments mixed it!  wish order spicy miso Jen Z  ! broth much more savory rich mine  switch meal  portions everything very small  pretty much ate everything mine finished off all Jen Z's veggies noodles feel full  quality meats superb fresh!

We tried desert fondue great!   Also bubblegum tasting Japanese soda small scoop ice cream  root beer float Japanese style  refreshing    Ok   The highlight nice clean set up  great service Chef O    incredibly delicious Sukiyaki   amazing Sushi restaurant same mall  Hanabi  would start Hanabi    some Sushi restaurant Sukiyaki  should Japanese progressive dinner event! Both places Excellent  <EOR> What nice relaxing experience  environment modern unique touch  only bar seating  Everyone nice super eager explain hotpot concept  small whole place still definitely spacious when eating  Doesn't feel crowded all  menu very easy read presentation food clean simple  3 different broths choose from  did spicy miso tonkotsu which we're both very flavorful  Bowl veggies good variety  U choose brown white rice  also serve different condiments extra toppings meat super flavorful  swisher goma sauces bomb  yellowish sweet savory option favorite  chose yojie cut meat fresh  Only bad thing could say experience ordered much  There's 3 sizes large each instead regular  Large came 15 prices regular comes 10 12  guess depends hungry are  Pricing isn't bad either  Oh only downside wish gave more noodles! loved udon noodles  Iced green tea bomb sweet  Oh must say play jams while eating  All slow jams 90s music know eating much more fun! Haha <EOR> The Skinny although quality product okay meager portions price  flavor broth sauce alright  3 service ambience modern service okay but easily overwhelmed 3 value all its nickel dime tactics value just isn't there  If must try place come lunch  charge extra dinner without adding any value 3    FYI Yojie located close Tropical Smoothie cafe Viva Mercado's    Walking into restaurant 2 guests eating lunch around 11 30 am  required sign even though no wait  weird because took few minutes anyone notice came in    Regardless seated promptly menu explained us  quite few options meat but pricing based size your protein portion  most things menu sizes only 5oz geisha 7oz samurai   Only Yojie cut 4 sizing options 3 oz 5 oz 7oz 10oz   comes white brown rice bowl vegetables noodles   Kombu broth water seaweed standard but charge extra sukiyaki spicy miso tonkotsu broth $2 $2 $3 respectively   Sukiyaki comes egg while other broths come 2 3 dipping sauces which ponzu goma sesame sweet savory apparently ginger teriyaki sauce   Extra sauce rice veggies cost extra    We ordered Yojie cut Sumo sized $20 99 lunch kurobuta pork Samurai sized $17 99 spicy miso tonkotsu broth    The Yojie cut medium marbling  unimpressed left really huge chunk fat end pieces meat I understand can't control huge chunk fat middle   If paying weight meat needs properly trimmed  kurobuta pork tasted good but really fatty well    The spicy miso broth tonkotsu broth made alkaline water!    Sorry bit sarcasm both okay but doesn't compare any half decent ramen joint terms flavor even all cooking done  worth premium    Tried goma ponzu impressed The goma sesame sauce bit earthy can't think another word tastes  ponzu lacked true citrus flavor acidity yuzu which made rather pedestrian    The side rice vegetables really disappointing portion size  vegetable bowl looks pretty but really isn't alot there  total half slice onion 2 small Napa cabbage leaves cut into 4 4 spinach leaves half small carrot 1 shitake mushroom 1 mouth sized amount enoki 2 small pieces broccoli 2 bite size pieces tofu 4 udon noodles 5 pieces rice noodles  Oh small bite pickled daikon seaweed thrown there    They also only give half bowl rice    Service very attentive beginning when only 2 people other joint  However once 6 people restaurant service became spotty water refills  when least 2 servers restaurant!   Ambience modern hipster ventilation good but difficult hear music background    Our total lunch 2 $48 tax no drinks dessert  food okay books definitely better  Considering portion sizing taste level service prices exorbitant  Given premium charge dinner for no reason! becomes even more insane  Pass place 3 starred review   <EOR> Second time here  Portions meats good prices add more solid value  lunch favorable pricing time son  He Japanese soda marble neck bottle   yojie cut angus pork belly sukiyaki style  Presentation point color marbling meats looking just good taste  Definitely recommend sukiyaki style raw egg dip your food adds richness    dessert ice cream  Server recommended purple ube yam ice cream   Actually pretty good  Vibrant purple color interesting flavor  sure back slot especially when winter hits  <EOR> Very chill atmosphere  First time ordered combo salmon beef  Everything excellent! plenty food staff very helpful guiding through cooking process  green tea fondue strawberries very tasty too  definitely back when town again  <EOR> My cousin town mentioned Jo Koys restaurant clearly curious  Aside being favorite comedians place really did earn 5 star    Its traditional shabu restaurant all seating being U shape everyone facing inward  really isn't lot seats but arrived just right time because soon seated line started form wait began  When walk all greet something sure said but did every customer really cool see all attention each person start    Our server incredibly friendly she explained way menu works helped some suggestions  spicy broth combination beef chicken  loved broth! say drank all ate all meat  son shared he wanted more lol  food brought quick off eating deliciousness!! food overall best shabu had  let pick 2 sauces ponzu another sweet forgot name   ponzu sons favorite while enjoyed sweet bit more    To end evening tried green tea chocolate fondue strawberries bananas  Omg! it! must! <EOR> Pretty good food fun place different type experience  service notch however little pricey side  <EOR> First time good!!!

Although heard term shabu shabu before not confused excellent INXS album Shabooh Shoobah no idea being mood something 'different' ventured in   Nice clean place great design counters side restaurant   If recall correctly name wait person helped Amanda and only remember because good friends Dallas also named Amanda she great talk well more little helpful assisting navigating intricacies shabu shabu cooking dining  until point fondue chafing dish filled melty cheese chocolate mixtures dipped various things into   Same principal except now savory sometimes sweet hot sauces broths douse paper thin sliced meats assorted veggies into    We found whole process strange but fun  Bear little trouble chopsticks first but don't leave hanging if can't seem it  while since first visit birthday coming thinking Why not?

This place really group friendly  understand concept being bar because individual cooker but cases where there's large group today you're only able converse those sitting next you  Also kinda keeps sharing food everyone your group which could good bad thing    Servers helpful especially when you're first timer    I'm still hoping see take picture owner Jo Koy  Hasn't happened yet but maybe if come more often  bound run into right? Haha <EOR> Honestly don't want explain why place good   MUST try it   only am saying because seen owner some things made instant gratification being part f b industry   food ambiance all top notch  <EOR> Fun experience family  Love individual stove  staff attentive without being over bearing  8 year old challenges reach but did well enough cook meal only 2 tiny  incident  Only down side don't liquor license yet  <EOR> RECOMMEND!!

When first time friend service amazing  But must say second time mom service horrible  waitress barely checked but when she did she didn't ask if needed anything else if okay  She just picked some plates back talk friend sitting register  Although service time sucked food delicious!! may hotpot restaurant <EOR> My husband eat almost every time great service food amazing   Unfortunately last time 3 star experience reason being because husband asked purple haired waitress something said No don't want to  Then laughed   I know she meant joke but    it seemed some truth it? didn't want work today? Or   ?  Anyways save came chef I'm assuming since she wore hat black coat   She reason experience saved  She nice talked bagged husband's food  her  <EOR> Me girlfriend come late dinner around 9  yojie before but time give review because everything point! server attended right away gave minute look over menu Mind haven't year so   recently alcohol license but server said they're only serving beer moment until take class serve sake  Upon ordering girlfriend yojie cut smallest portion  myself combo plate which consisted yojie cut your choice Chicken salmon pork pork belly  chose pork belly  offered vegetables such broccoli lettuce half white mushroom shitake mushrooms carrots onions while also offering tofu seaweed udon glass noodles  offer white brown rice  Then choose your pot  offer original shabu shabu broth very light miso flavor sukiyaki broth spicy miso pork broth  girlfriend both sukiyaki! sukiyaki offer pasteurized egg dipping sauce  REALLY well broth meat  always pace myself because eat lot rice whole meal    After dinner green tea white chocolate fondue desert plate fruits strawberries  girlfriends FAVORITE   Yojie never disappoints  all  <EOR> I came twice dinner thoroughly enjoyed place  tiny place modern decor  first time came TVs showing horse racing second time showing another sport  music choice bit odd play mixture 90s 2000s music doesn't feel fits matches aura place   The first time came ordered spicy miso broth vegetable medley I asked mushrooms replaced something else ponzu goma sauces side brown rice  also ordered cherry blossom tea because something very new unique sounding try it  cherry blossom tea tasted green tea  confused thinking maybe gave plain green tea but drank more could taste hint something else  However whatever became overpowered green tea flavor   Melanie I think  name server she awesome  She always smiling happy always checking making sure everything okay if needed anything else overall gave really good customer service    The second time came ordered exact same thing I don't other options vegetarian but Japanese iced coffee instead cherry blossom green tea  Japanese iced coffee tasted plain iced coffee but tasted brown sugar? subtly sweet flavor expected but didn't hate I'd order again    This time Azi server  She wasn't friendly bit attitude  She didn't care ask meal check us  She would walk without saying anything but would check other guests  Very different Melanie's customer service  However server guy named Shannon started check he extremely kind more willing help if needed anything  He checked number times always asked if needed more broth wanted more water he superb  He even offered take pots back put them to go containers wrap them us! shocked willingness such thing happy see level customer service  He even marked containers I'd know which mine    For food skeptical try miso broth because grew eating miso soup lot I come Asian family couldn't imagine eating spicy hot pot broth  however pleasantly surprised flavor enjoyed every bite it  also very happy portions given vegetable medley because vegetarian all could eat filled nicely   We only allowed pick two three different sauces which saddens because Hawaii we're used having 10 20 different sauce options pick freely even mix match sauces create own unique sauces    For dessert ordered milk chocolate fondue berries bananas strawberries bananas   some expectations fondue since name restaurant but wasn't anything special unique it  Yojie might benefit doing something unique special fondue because reality plain fondue it all called Yojie Japanese Fondue something unique it     I hope management acknowledges customer service skills Shannon Melanie because attentive us  Melanie even remembered second time came back! continue come back again but I'd hope Azi server again  <EOR> Everything AWESOME  start service  Every single person beyond welcoming made feel already regular which now!
