Now talking just gross human hair but potentially dangerous foreign OBJECTS food  almost Aj Jus sauce bin used trash can   yet try beef sandwich again  thought going back allow steel wool human hair beef broth beyond gross   assumption staff doesn't care which mentioned before    must no pride taken cleanliness    Here actual sad part food excellent tasting! Well before mental stigma gross objects being food happens  bothers because closest thing Chicago food within few miles house   saying mean Rosati's really want them address issues come back  just think need staff involved staff cares  Other place lot potential  <EOR> Ordered deep dish thin pizza hot wings all delicious  First time trying pizza place family likes lot  <EOR> Let start off saying phone lady nice great service aspect  pizza just good today  before wanted traditional crust actually thick crust which cannot stand! Reminds off papa johns! no  flavor pizza all! thinner crust which thought traditional because she explained over phone always good pizza pretty good past! also ordered chicken fingers mozzarella sticks forgot Mariana sauce fingers over cooked  But bad  most annoyed antipasto salad horrible! Never pieces parmesan cheese other cheese same cheese top pizza with  No rolled meat cheese just horrible pepperoni maybe smallest amount ham imagine  took picture below ate but did eat any ham pepperoni being don't even two ham isn't kind prefer! No roasted red peppers instead green bell peppers spinach! Such waste 10$ cold bland pizza  Still hungry! <EOR> BEWARE!!! ordered wings two pizzas Sunday ended FOOD POISONING 2 days thanks tainted food! never come again!!! <EOR> How posted review yet??? ordering takeout location years now  same woman takes order every time she always super polite  She always knows exactly special ordered salad  feel jerk because she knows name don't know hers  receipt says Zulema  Anyhow tonight ordered takeout again everything amazing  Thank always taking care well  back  <EOR> I Rosati's once 2 years ago when lived different area town  Honestly wasn't overly impressed  going wait try second time before reviewing but just never happened    Well since moving different neighborhood noticed Rosati's less mile where type this  took minute but tonight finally give them second chance           and am really glad did!  Located northeast corner Windmill Rainbow spot Rosati's Pizza Pub Smith's shopping center  much easier find off Windmill Road just east Smith's gas station   I haven't chance enjoy actual pub its self since just grabbed pie tonight  just wait updated review     That pie however tasty hell! Two things stood crust sauce  crust wasn't thin which can't stand doughy  but nice crispy! Just right! sauce lightly seasoned unique taste own right    The employees all very friendly engaging fun chat well  Definitely no complaints far service goes!  The only reasons can't give 5 stars is    bit pricey side  $20 pizza isn't most paid pie but certainly isn't cheapest either! Sometimes pay quality guess   am big fan square slices  huge deal but definitely prefer traditional slices    I live close Rosati's love taste pizza almost guaranteed certainty back  all still try garlic knots wings brew Pub!   4 stars  <EOR> The dough nuggets come such large portion almost full off them but good! honestly dough nuggets probably show stealer  pizza just wasn't cup tea  friend craving pizza decided closest place where live let down  ordered thin crust 12in pizza mushrooms olives banana peppers spinach  such okay pizza  Maybe try something else next time  <EOR> I'm New England  dad pizza maker 17 years  own dough prefer thin New York style pizza    If all Rosati's made deep dish Chicago Style pizza would give 5 stars don't usually give anyone 5 stars  reason because people yelp 5 star places all time ratings accurate   I love deep dish  pastry crust savory sauce high quality cheese toppings call lasagna bread  beautiful product think worthy being top pizza's ever tried    So why 3 stars?   I tried double dough thin crispy even same league wal mart sam's club take bake pizza    SO DISSAPOINTING!   I ordered veggie doubledough occasion tasteless soft watery all veggies  don't remember paid because also deep dish made forget all money wasted DD   Whats square cut round pizza? someone comment why would cut pizza way? all weird pieces don't any toppings them  Weird        Today ordered monster pizza thin crispy XL size 18'' asked wedge cut because square cut really annoyed took away quality product  supreme pizza meat veggies   It looked good but  far went  ate piece disappointed threw away  crust wasn't bad  crispy yes but enough salt dough  Kind breadstick    It evidence cornmeal which requirement style pizza    Thin watery tart sauce could taste topping other  literally tasteless    The sad part paid $33 failure   I no problem paying 40 bucks large deep dish because proven itself every time ordered it    I also tried lasagna antipasti salad both which really anything worth trying again    All all love Rosati's deep dish pizza Please try your favorite bottle wine let euphoria take over  <EOR> Went first week ordered cal zone  dough cooked all way beer taps inop  stayed away place until cousing ordered delivery  Thin crust pizza extra crispy well done wings!
