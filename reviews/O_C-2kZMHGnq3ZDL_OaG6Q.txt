voila Morels was   We ordered caesar salad which made table side   caesar salad nothing special although thought much acidity wouldn't minded some anchovies   Before salad came famished but bread nowhere seen   sure why ask them bring bread but did however warm soft butter olive tapenade came perfect combination   I did order steak bone rib eye but much bread couldn't finish all   steak though wasn't all great   well cooked asked medium rare medium rare but seasoning wasn't flavorful enough flavor did wasn't all good   We also ordered pomme frites which thin cut fries those even though truffle mayo came delicious good sauce steak     Service good attentive   would probably want try other steak houses next time here  <EOR> We dinner first looked very promising   but place definitely disappointed  ambience nice reservations seated right away   I'm giving 2 stars only because 18 hour braised short ribs pretty decent     would better COLD  When said 18 hour braised didn't think meant would feel 18 hours passed before your food   My entire party's food cold  ordered some drinks wine wait least half hour drinks  Some them wrong drink order some drinks given wrong people  supposed when takes long drink tend forget whose drink belongs whom __ still pretty sure doesn't take long wine  mean   1 open bottle 2 pour 3 serve   Service AWFUL  didn't seem waiters really knew doing  offered split checks end night said couldn't  Maybe because knew already going gratuity?? party 6+ knows  table next seated good before us  staff looked running around headless chickens really doing anything  place didn't even seem busy    Definitely coming back unless whole day wait mediocre food extra $100 lying around really NEED rid of  for plate food could easily Cheesecake Factory quarter price  <EOR> Really disappointed   came Morels great steak sadly disappointed   Although fondue appetizer excellent steak ordered a $67 filet minion came cold   Ice cold  refrigerator      cold   Weird  When reordered steak came rare instead medium ordered 20 minutes later  just don't understand it   two swings two misses decided call quits asked check rather wait another 20 minutes another steak   matters worse manager didn't come say anything he left waiter another table explaining apologizing my waiter disappeared   Then when specifically requested manager waited almost 15 minutes appear   think good idea where problem here   Great product great servers but really crappy management   sure say because really wanted Morels but two things must when charging almost $70 steak  must hot must right temperature  Also place if customer problem manager should immediately solving issue  Morels misses both points  clear manager interested customers team's performance  Very sadly give Morels 1 star advise them find new management   am sincerely disappointed  <EOR> Came private affair loved every minute it  started off room where windows completely open servers we're

Maybe normal French restaurant?  don't know   Morel doesn't sides your entree   order another side $9 $12   ordered fries yeah don't ask why paid $11 fries mac cheese we're fanciest people other potato dish   potato dish best   The steak itself worst cut ribeye steak ever tasted   only thing good steak medium rare which surprisingly many places manage screw up   steak bland sauce tasteless even fatty part steak which usually enjoy regardless rest steak tastes very disappointing   Worst   Steak   Ever   also includes ribeye Chili's   Yes   What else say restaurant?  waiter didn't seem happy see wanted move couple tables away immediate zone   would understandable except bill $240 tip easily exceeds 4 hours minimum wage labor     The toothpick came individual wrapper nice   Go Table 10 instead splurge CUT   Save yourself some time money  <EOR> Here's deal probably 10 times over last several years  service food hit miss  Its people management problem  becomes clearer know staff very friendly think doing best given leadership   Let's start negative principal issues food quality inconsistency  great steak week marginal steak next  could cooked way ordered week next its someone else's order  many people service table never know charge because guy gal appears your waiter again off again  think because when slow spread servers thin  good bad servers last night Eldifon he above average   On positive side expansive wine list covering California France  Italy values terms price but selection  October 16 sommelier great he recommended very good montrachet 3 5 times its retail little high '09    Though terribly inconsistent terms may time time management minding cheese list best cheese lists Vegas West when its order  boot 20 bottles 'by glass list' good pairings cheese  could probably better job helping people decisions but again     This diamond rough shape  would important meal but if willing through some bumps its bad spot try out  certainly worse! <EOR> We came breakfast morning since menu seemed fairly appealing  liked friendly service hostesses waiters also loved setting large windows opening strip  +2 stars   The food okay  +1 star   ordered Veggie Omlette while appreciate fact use free range eggs didn't see big difference taste when compared omlettes Grand Lux Cafe Bellagio etc  hashbrowns tasted bit old something I'd expect high end French restaurant  sure if I'd ever come back breakfast   Well maybe if sit stripside patio <EOR> We late reservation six sunday   Place fairly empty   Service excellent staff friendly   kansas city steak caramelized onions roasted tomatoes side   Steak best ever would honestly fly back vegas just eat another one   Aged perfectly cooked perfection    Their wine list comprehensively    French   being Vegas would naturally understand why would considered better = $$$$    Unfortunately its least anymore   Overall great experience yum yum nom nom red meat  <EOR> Not great experience here  friendly dietary restrictions  Gluten free difficult   asked options server treated pain  boyfriend steak he said equivalent sizzler  Wouldn't recommend  <EOR> Excellent food outstanding service!

Brandon tall one awesome!! <EOR> We Mother's Day brunch very disappointed experience   whole service staff very nice but atmosphere just wasn't there   couple groups whose children running around table next ours   When discretely asked moved restaurant seated outdoors even though asked inside seating saw other open tables inside restaurant     Sometimes food ambiance   case did not   bread used croque madame strange consistency lumpy quiche lorraine tasted bit custard like  Honduran coffee lobster mac cheese skirt steak eggs just okay but aiming bit higher Morel's achieved   It might off day them but take family back again especially special occasion   just many good restaurants Las Vegas settle less  <EOR> This slightly 'above average' steakhouse VENETIAN  wine collection nice seafood well  Steaks good according friends  liked shrimps lobster  did chicken breast alternative steak  Wasnt good all actually  asked advice same told because Steakhouse! Well rid item your menu if thats case! <EOR> Had great experience Easter Brunch   Lobster Mac Cheese didn't look lot lobster but actually loaded it!  mostly smaller chunks made almost every bite perfect balance   Chicken Waffles great dish greasy right crispness   management made sure all aspects seen start finish   Would recommend menu  <EOR> Will back  Ordered feature bone filet 1 2 pound king crab legs  Also ordered prawn cocktail  server forgot prawn  filet came single crab claw  asked server if supposed crab legs  He didn't reply but instead manager delivered two more claws  manager told run crab legs day two ago  tried claws  good! steak excellent  prawn finally showed up  good all  Very disappointed  <EOR> Omg What Awesome restaurant!

However food just alright price  boyfriend rib eye steak ordered medium very rare  When he asked steak recooked came back nearly burnt outside  other friend ordered same thing medium well  steakhouse would think should best dish  18 hour braised short rib  Actually wasn't bad all! sauce provide really well meat little bit side help take break all meat  only downside meat bit dry side if didn't pour sauce all over it  Luckily provide extra sauce side just case  <EOR> Terrible terrible mussels pommes frites weren't good either  mussels far worse mussels ever very disappointed since love mussels  service good bread good  comped mussels because didn't them giving two stars instead one  way much good food Vegas come again  Maybe steaks better     <EOR> I can't imagine anything would made experience Morels any better  Las Vegas weekend wanted French food but didn't time money really fine dinner opted brunch  debated between Bouchon Morels but finally decided Morels because Eggs Benedict Bouchon doesn't    There four plus little one  sat beautiful round table treated royalty minute friendly staff  complete professionals keeping table clean stocked  First brought fresh beignets light overly sweet  ordered French press coffee  which incredible least bit gritty kind home espresso virgin latte kid handmade Bloody Marys  Oh boy treat!

But oysters cheese wine service all rocked! <EOR> Whenever travel Vegas tend gravitate towards buffets cheap eats  Why? Because always afraid fancy restaurants all show no substance  might case some restaurants but Morels  wife ate dinner last night perfect way end vacation  Service impeccable you two servers food fantastic  started three cheese sampler told server he could choose they way many cheeses choose   He ended bringing four cheese sampler he his words fence if going them  nice! then asked if he could split $16 iceberg salad into two portions no problem  salad beautifully presented ordered two them  main dish 20oz bone in rib eye  Yes $64 but cooked perfectly absolutely delicious  Dessert? Nope full   I wished could eaten outside patio but little cool ate inside  No matter atmosphere nice play great selection music  sure we'll back  <EOR> Based price paid meal am tempted give star but would inedible happen     waiter very arrogant seemed put off needed 15 20 minutes order since socializing work instead    ordered $50+ filet very little taste somewhat dry topping paid $8 quarter size piece blue cheese   Weak!  No table happy meal co workers country overseas even refused tip waiter service meal below average   never done life still gave 15% normally 20%+     <EOR> The best steak restaurant period  ordered Grass Fed New York strip medium rare  Yes grass fed beef organic pastured chickens here    With great view strip outside balcony seating Morels French Steakhouse Vegas dinner must  <EOR> Came lunch because craving French food last day Vegas last time  wish gone during dinner could try more food!

Oh gosh think sauce made dish excellent and course fish perfectly cooked very tender     My sister steak frites which thought great too  She thought well done even though agree taste great because thin steak wasn't tough    Overall liked food definitely return just sole if craving fish  But must  would probably invest time another French restaurant Vegas  Honestly speaking   price food quality might equal  another 1 star there  <EOR> I started new December tradition year  having breakfast Christmas Day New Year's Day somewhere Las Vegas Strip preferably patio hopefully no wind   I've going try Morels during Restaurant Week but never it   called last week check patio open breakfast heated   woman spoke said Oh yes!  very nice  close opening time morning   When asked host if patio open   He said Yes but cold out  replied knew dressed warmly   shown table facing TI   During 45 minutes no company patio heaters nor any turned benefit   Having read Yelp reviews menu online think knew when would ordering mascarpone stuffed French toast   also Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee done French press   glass tomato juice some tabasco spicy breakfast drink   The French toast excellent   When ordered server Carlos asked if wanted syrup side which choice   French toast nice sized round tasty bread filled mascarpone topped fresh strawberries bananas few raspberries   cinnamon toast some crunchy sugar berries added fine flavor   syrup good but could use sparingly French toast good   Carlos brought second pot coffee enjoyed sitting watching workers some painting walls   hadn't seen any graffiti New Year's Eve partiers but maybe just cleaning some foot prints where people jumped wall closed Boulevard   I would given Morels four stars but heaters   When call ahead yes answer then true no offered light right behind service let down me   Carlos fine server talked where he parked NYE he could work back car street closures   He gave some tips put use next year when Boulevard close instead watching TV  <EOR> No just no   Where start?  Look every good restaurant Vegas overinflated prices fact chastised other reviewers commenting previous reviews other restaurants Vegas   But when experience bad then price just slaps much harder   First did reservation   But restaurant half empty   proceeded walk farthest back table if wearing escaped state pen prisoner garb   hard vibe atmosphere joint when miles away another diner   The next major issue service   think best word describe just clumsy   waiter seemed disinterested   wait staff themselves just mess at point trying take side mushrooms half full when done eating    When bringing bottle wine attempted just pour without even  courtesy taste   friend threw hand over glass before he could but good grief just common courtesy   The food   Bland under seasoned boring meh   Just meh   better steak better mushrooms great cook any means   I would never back way many other great options Vegas  <EOR> I staying palazzo needed breakfast before early flight came here   Sat bar solo   Immediately greeted most beautiful bartenders ever seen life   No lie love first sight   bloody Mary cart spectacular highlight meal   veggie omelet  Meh   memorable all  bloody hottie bartender beignets she brought saved experience but expensive such crappy omelet only back see bartender bloody  <EOR> Felicia made great drink while checked in!!!
