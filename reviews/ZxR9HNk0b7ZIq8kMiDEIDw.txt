Hard believe since Vegas but true  ask chicken nachos gave beef server didn't even came once check if everything ok  waited 15 minutes without drinks server offer bring more drinks stare 5 minutes she shouted bar if wanted anything else  right just lost it! just ask water  came only drinks appetizers but costumer service only round drinks  finish experience bathrooms dirty  Smell bad toilet paper everywhere  mean place cheap ok pay long worth it  place needs some love  <EOR> friendly staff good food  live music little bit loud  band ok  but  just opinion  <EOR> Hard Rock Cafe two blocks strip Paradise Rd  easily identifyable enormous topographically incorrect neon Les Paul bolted front    The place loud full tourists yet service friendly efficient  good avocado pepperjack burger however steak fries bit underfried very salty  Hard Rock some nice tunes rock memorabilia strewn across walls also gift shop where another Hard Rock shirt future painting days  <EOR> Cannot stress wonderful place is  Good excellent drinks delicious host fabulous  visited three times during stay didn't better service anywhere!

Great Location + Free Wi Fi+ Awesome Service + Delicious Food = Repeat Customer Mary <EOR> I find pathetic order small ice cream $6 95  two dollars less sundae only couple small baby scoops massive glass  Very sad   When asked why two small scoops smaller scooper used sundae he said small ice cream look bigger  WTH?  BTW cherry came wife's sundae  did come HRC flag though  cute   could purchased two gallons vanilla money spent two melon ball scoops ice cream   I am black HRC VIP Back Stage card holder fan HRC over 30 years  took Lifetime membership away now food turning garbage  problem? <EOR> Ich bin gerne den Hard Rock Cafés wurde hier aber leider enttäuscht  Die Preise für das Essen waren äquivalent zu denen die ich kannte Hamburg London Dubai nur nicht beim Bier! Da traff uns dann der Schlag  12 35 $ für das erste Bier inkl  Souvenir Glas  Das halte ich für Abzocke zumal der Preis nirgendwo zu lesen war und die Souvenir Gläser sonst optional sind   Da Restaurant sich war aber sehr schön viele Elvis Exponate und die Burger sehr gut <EOR> As location bit off Strip imagine wouldn't busy some other downtown locations  Cafe small comparison others store tiny!  The food course great always is  couple new items menus apparently added last week lucky us!   would recommend everything except Peanut Butter tiny dessert thing  love peanut butter don't wrong but lacking another flavor  tasted dipped spoon jar smooth peanut butter  should another layer chocolate sauce cookies graham crackers  would top notch then   All all great experience  <EOR> We eat when arived Las Vegas     should know if ever hard rock very loud music   server very nice manager came around each table asked servace was  bacon burger amazing couldnt finish though  servers great attitude but very pricy meal cource buy t shirt doant come cheap! but would back but wouldnt first choice  <EOR> Would 5 stars if burgers seasoned Mac n' cheese tasted better  server Ronitta amazing! I'd definitely suggest sitting section! <EOR> Aw man    hate writing bad reviews but food pretty bad   My husband dropped morning breakfast both agreed basically Denny's   That said server wonderful  think she's bartender too  drinks great!! lady fun outgoing just amazing  Wish we'd liked food could see again! <EOR> It's burger delicious expected  About its atmosphere believe Hard rick cafe time square more interesting  <EOR> Its Hard Rock Cafe can't wrong such good vibe  Spacious bar allows rest your elbows much needed if you're hungover am  Oh bartender chick singing freaking down earth    Great wings try mystery mojito! <EOR> I came several people  hadn't Hard Rock Cafe many years U S  last time disappointing  Since time some Japan excellent  hoping same experience  mean American restaurant should better here  Wrong! starters two waiters serve us  good but other clearly annoyed having deal large party  Then some orders wrong food just wasn't good  won't trying Hard Cafe U S  anymore  <EOR> Never deviated strip but trip worth it  Came Hard Rock infamous concert club Joint see Tiesto concert  3 levels party wowed me! pricey Labor Day Weekend costs $3000 table $2000 bottle patron sure much bottle Jack 2 Grey Goose costs but end fun night total $7900! Well worth enjoyment experience  <EOR> No complaints food  nachos side macaroni cheese yum! side ceaser salad   Ok  know Hard Rock Cafe more fun your average restaurant  But don't think waiters should hit unless solicited  Mr  Waiter even audacity pull chair sit down table say well bored its slow night going hang ladies  cute  dropped obvious boyfriend bomb try send hint across but no luck  he handed bill he proposed date  Hint clearly did point earlier  ATTENTION CUTE WAITERS customer must initiate hitting ok return it  <EOR> I several times breakfast great experience every time  staff super friendly  breakfast menu great  chicken waffles far fav  <EOR> Breakfast good   Service great!

He great suggestions food drinks talked music  He even brought over very nice music manager took requests played them  requested Simple Man Lynard Skynard which didn't but Shinedown version he played that  rest requested Doors Hendrix etc all played    I duo fajitas really good  seasoning amazing char chicken perfect  All all really great food atmosphere  continue Hard Rock Cafes! <EOR> Love Chop House Salad   Some entrees salty   Overall fun place! <EOR> If you've Hard Rock Cafe you've them all   But there's still novelty seeing Jimi Hendrix hot pants combined hi hat used Styx appealing choice once while   Las Vegas location situated near Hard Rock Hotel   You'd think there'd Hard Rock Cafe inside Hard Rock Hotel but you'd wrong   What's cool HRC massive guitar sign entrance   wish knew guy five years architect school one   recall getting macaroni cheese came some type toast garlic bread   tasty enough server kept coke filled which really pet peeve when doesn't happen   watched Stevie Ray Vaughn Aerosmith videos   t shirt way out  <EOR> Guys place needs refreshed!  Food just ok missing some great salads   The music great but missing mark food   And just small simple thing            clean front glass doors! <EOR> Toad bartender served great meal  Best server Vegas <EOR> To carry order bar  waited 35 minutes hamburger  No offer glass water anything  burger OK  well done asked  No napkins bag    Only pluses restaurant big paper bag easy walk Red Roof hotel no cigarette smell casino next door  <EOR> 2 7 stars average food good service zero atmosphere    Came large group work sadly empty Thurs  evening felt  family restaurant        Wings average nothing rave nachos slightly better  Smokehouse chopped salad fresh good break Vegas usual  Drink menu fruity cocktails sweet side  Service prompt efficient but other convenience service no compelling reason frequent cafe unless you're side town  <EOR> So 2 Hard Rock Cafes Las Vegas Strip corner Paradise Harmon   things more confusing Hard Rock Hard Rock Hotel Casino but separate structure front and surrounded Hotel's driveway    it?    Ok now know where let's in   decor typical every Hard Rock is rock memorabilia mostly guitars mounted walls plaques identifying musician once used many TV's featuring rock videos   felt fresh exciting New York 1980's now seems tame stale   Maybe  why only patron 1 elderly 2 dining small children     I greeted promptly cheerfully hosts offered seat bar which took   slept late missed bacon egg cheese croissant craving breakfast ends 11 AM    Instead decided safe order Legendary Burger     My bartender also tables he charge serving he gone lot   Watching work he tendency task saturated he would keep running back forth whatever table asked something last rather taking care multiple parties sweeps   finally just server station refill drink soda gun     The food fine   Nothing spectacular but bad either   price seemed little steep but 1 tourist trap 2 check Yelp yields 20% discount food non alcoholic drinks nice     Conclusions place fine neither great nor terrible  <EOR> Was breakfast other day  Food good service excellent quick!  Food 4 Service 5  Overall 4 5 rounds down <EOR> Been few Hard Rocks pretty much same  Mac Cheese  Still good Rock Bottom's Mac Cheese  Great service but walk around building into casino  <EOR> This restaurant become required stop whenever visit Vegas  service stellar quality taste food quite simply amazing and alcoholic beverages   couldn't say kinder words waiter seems though people working location true passion doing job hired do  also impressed environment general very clean decorated incredibly well there's always good although loud music playing sometimes non mainstream artists perform live well which treat catch  If you're visiting Vegas give restaurant try  <EOR> I stayed Hard Rock Hotel 2 separate trips Vegas last 4 months   both occasions found ourselves eating two nights row   wings amazing salad   Service always great nice atmosphere   Can't find bad thing say place  <EOR> what      a      dump!!!! friend drink  made terrible mistake  ordered cup coffee bar     6 BUCKS!!!! what're nuts? think gonna pay 6 buc   ok did  well might arrested if tried run it  but 6 bucks!!!   you know else? manager place world class dweeb  he stands behind stares then he half way stairs he glare there  LOOOO SERRRR!!!  surprisingly security guys cool i know because complained them idiot manager   ever frequent place again?     wow really think that    NOOOOOOO!!!!!!! <EOR> Mainly only 2 stars because food very overpriced even having all cool decor  Paid $21 nachos appetizer $12 + $6 adding meat another $3 guacamole which good but worth money  Also $15 burger fries which also good but exactly $15 good  server very friendly but did ask refill drink empty unnoticed  Overall food decent but hard justify paying $21 just good  super nachos Robertos  If your vacation budget then pretty cool place lots memorabilia  If budget then may want avoid one  <EOR> Came dinner husband ordered hot wings grilled OMFG    juicy tender  also ordered shrimp Caesar salad shrimp  great salad split everything  Highly recommend wings  bartender awesome  show pics but ate fast <EOR> Came lunch burger   Very empty service great   Drink never empty   Burger very nicely done   Music selection could bit better maybe off day   Decorations plus good experience   Place clean   Parking largely easy  <EOR> I hadnt chain years    came yelp check decent grub    but completely reminded chain consequently spectacular      So place 90s chit  mean t shirt any 10 cities show cool were  Fast forward today don't think sen anyone hardrock café t shirt least 10 years  Crazy stuff truth told  swag same every other hard rock café worldwide just says lost wages instead Albuquerque Sydney London    Pro Tip Yelp check 20% off your check including alcohol   I burger fairly average when here  didn't stand wow think anything specific  french fried potatoes topped them cheese BACON! Sadly cost extra $2 50 cheese bacon O_O   totally caught off guard that  Especially when strip bacon crumbled slice American cheese  exactly great bang your buck   One friends salad which purportedly decent  came number toppings bet total calorie count more burger fries =X other two friends split meal which seemed enjoy but weren't very excited cant remember ordered haha   Drinks decent pours but expected Vegas IMHO  Several hurricanes delivered table girls enjoyed them them souvenir glasses   Overall acceptable food but bit pricey received IMHO  brand worth extra cost point time average meal averagish service bygone swag    enjoy if but don't expect much    <EOR> Justin H calling out  Slow service? Rubbish! served fast actually meal ready four days before there!  Okay exaggerating but service fast smile  Brett Michaels well he looked served intelligently even though he did upsell Hurricane glass without saying optioning buy it  okay though he's working Hard Rock Cafe win moral victory   Anywho food okay though portions felt little drab small side  fries excellent but Mojito probably worst ever had  did use Domino tap water? Nevertheless guy took off bill made face I'd tasted bum   Overall place way way far strip worth price selection wise really isn't going blow anyone away  no ramble length memorabilia even Baltimore branch more impressive    Take family though great place children  Especially children run around outside restaurant your way  <EOR> A pocos metros del Hard Rock Hotel se encuentra el Café bajo el mismo nombre  El ambiente es igual al de todas sus sucursales lo largo del globo y la carta también creo que es común entre ellos    En el centro hay una barra las mesas están organizadas su alrededor  Se notaba que había mucha buena onda por parte de los que la atendían pero no podías sentarte ahí al menos que tuvieras +21 años #sad     Me es difícil reseñar la atención  Todos son súper simpáticos pero tardan muchísimo en acercarse tu mesa  Entiendo que es un lugar enorme y no hay tanta gente atendiéndolo pero la compañía debería preverlo    A la derecha de la entrada y rodeando toda esa ala del café está la tienda de regalos de la firma  Además de los artículos de ropa y vasos que hay en todos lados venden algunos accesorios alegóricos de la ciudad    Como salida es una re buena opción  Les tiro un par de datos sobre la comida  Acá animé probar el chicken waffles poco usual en Buenos Aires y encantó  No sé cómo pero el pollo queda bien con syrup  Los pancakes de arándanos también son muy buenos  Para comer de todo un poco salado lo mejor es el Jumbo Combo  El cheesecake de Oreo la verdad es que no gustó  El chocolate lava cake es muy rico  Hay tragos sin alcohol para los menores no bebedores  Las potato skins son lo más  <EOR> this review more aimed Gift Shop cafe did eat cafe   However when receive excellent customer service somewhere alert masses!   parents MA dad just Hard Rock Cafe Las Vegas Shirt   gift shop well set girl working counter AWESOME   Super friendly accommodating   She built solid rapport completed transaction smile   know doesnt sound ordinary however tad snobbish trendy younger crowd places   ran into many people places cool job   But she did wonderful job <EOR> I came last night see friend mine play show! second time seen them play both times great time!   The first time came some kind pulled pork sandwich which just alright but saw manager scream poor waitress which kinda left bad taste mouth    Last night friend appetizer sampler which came spinach artichoke dip chicken wings chicken tenders onion rings some kind brushetta flatbread  friend doesn't onion rings allowed sub french fries which nice  Everything just ok nothing special  only thing wholly awful chicken wings only cold rubbery just plain gross  bbq because friend can't eat spicy still spicy  just weird didn't even eat them  also brownie sundae which $10 which thought outrageous until saw size thing  HUGE  bigger head  need football team eat thing  Four still only ate third it  Wow big    Our server very nice don't remember name but she pretty fast attentive  Only thing she ever forgot twisted lemonade remind but once did she grabbed right away!  Overall ok place wouldn't recommend anyone way eat but definitely come drinks music! back whenever Fair Rosalie playing! <EOR> Ok     glitz    glamour    whatever     don't buy into fluff   My mom actually said she wanted here    something some gift cards she toting around    ok fine    I think really 10 years since Hard Rock Cafe     think New Orleans    wasn't memorable   This pretty good experience   I still doubts looking over menu     $15 10oz burger?  ouch     wasn't even going look menu $8 shake    thats just hte question   So ordered burger share wife    side Mac cheese read good   The wait long side    which turns out    noted but entertained enough matter   know show taste music but here's remember playing Billy Idol White wedding Rolling Stones Paint black Violent Femmes Blister Sun Live Lightning Crashes Green Day some song forgot name Paul Mcart some other song where when he sings he sticks neck chicken oh wait    all them some Billy joel song      the food came burger quite good    Mac cheese pretty durned guud too   I wandered into store while onesie little girl bit pricey side $14 button down casual shirt $40 wasn't bad    we'll see long lasts   Overall    won over again   still don't fact pay variable cost being amount food order but ok once in a long while place eat  <EOR> First time location review just based experience    The ambiance awesome   great see watch    The waitress ours maybe busy hard attention times    The food drink hit miss   mystery mojito don't it   way much cucumber flavor which ruins it    artichoke flatbread dip good but run flat bread before your done dip   hickory bbq budger great  <EOR> Is pool real? boobs pool real? anything floating pool real? someone please give skinny bitches sandwich??
