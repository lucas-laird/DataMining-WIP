I favor white sauce over red but both good base  toppings tasty ordered wide variety   If haven't tried brownies they're kind amazing  Smores especially! <EOR> Despite reviews willing give place shot Container Park 2 days week different hours both times doors locked during open hours no employee found  first day note door back soon waited 15 minutes no showed convinced two hungry kids should somewhere else  Same thing tonight around 8pm waited 30 minutes super annoying especially when see employee sitting enjoying pizza ironic right? nothing against employee taking break but poor management planning accommodate customer demand needs during peak hours around typical meal times  can't money if you're store closed when you're supposed advertised open  <EOR> Delicious pizza  Awesome customer service  Fantastic atmosphere  Prices can't beat  best meals Vegas  <EOR> For price pizza really good  favorite pizza ever but  also  $9 instead usual $15 20  would defiantly recommend place friends <EOR>
