I realize chinese fast food restaurant middle MGM hotel walkway caters foreigners truly authentic   it   But where does say just because authentic chinese food taste crap?  chow mein tasteless way much bean sprouts   mushroom chicken broccoli beef both missing flavor   Yes relatively cheap 1 item combo $4 99 compared other places Nathan's 2 hot dogs fries drink $8??? but really worth it?  My other gripe ordered gave HUGE container gave stingy amounts food   looked stingy portion because freakin container huge   Here's tip Studio Wok if you're going give less portions smaller containers looks you're giving more  <EOR> Decent tasting  Super cheap strip  Super duper cheap compared other offerings same food court  super authentic but expect Chinese take out place middle Las Vegas? <EOR> A little bit greasy oily taste here   Orange Chicken Beef Broccoli fried rice noodles   taste okay but really need tone down oil here   almost feel need extra white rice soak all oil your entree     However since located food court MGM Grand very convenient your Chinese fast food chow down before heading gamble drink party  <EOR>
