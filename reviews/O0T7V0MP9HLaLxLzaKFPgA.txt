Casual atmosphere    Family friendly    Attentive friendly wait staff    Nice menu selection    Perfect if big? hates good leftovers though portion sizes    Well done Good Fellas! My boy Fettuccini Alfredo which he devoured husband antipasto salad I jealous when came table eggplant parm   The bread used garlic toast awesome  eggplant nice light but crispy batter   like beer batter   sauce parmigiana heaping pile angel hair pasta really good  Nice amount tomato seasoning   Looking forward next visit calzone! <EOR> I used Italian Delights very disappointed when closed down  when restaurant reopened very excited    My two sons ordered calzone   When came them very small looked different others  only size but dough different color texture  waiter surprised also but told each calzone stretched differently     The bacon raw big chunks it  son ended scraping off food  waiter again offered side cooked bacon  almost done eating when realize wife still waiting food  When questioned waiter she said she forgotten put order computer   I never back  miss former owner Tony  <EOR> It nice clean restaurant quality food good value neighborhood  sure order garlic cheese bread antipasto salad chicken pesto pizza! Yummy <EOR> I trouble choosing between 1 2 stars but decided 2 because pricing very affordable    We came Saturday just before 6pm  seemed fairly busy didn't mind waiting little bit table  seated promptly unfortunately couple behind waiting list another couple walked seated themselves available booth  being cleared them  Staff didn't say anything took order while other couple left waiting  invited couple left waiting seated obliged   Although hot tea offered menu told didn't any available iced tea instead  ordered garlic fries appetizer which took almost half hour come out longer would liked  also asked dinner order held until couple joining received theirs served meal 20 minutes before pizza came  Drink refills hard come by  Waited half hour asked 3 4 times check before finally came  took 1 5 hours dinner here    Garlic Fries okay  Hot fresh but especially well seasoned   Mushroom Ravioli Doughy bland Alfredo sauce separating lukewarm temperature  Definitely frozen ravioli product   Calzone Completely burnt bottom pretty toasty top well  filling tasty but crust sauce served looked pretty bad    PROS Inexpensive think 16 pizzas rang under $15  10% discount LE Military CCW Open Carry guests   CONS Poorly cooked calzones  Uses frozen dry pastas  Wait staff incompetent   Long wait times food  <EOR> Goodfellas mediocre pizza   step large chains but far good mom pop pizza places around town   ordered Chicken Alfredo specialty pizza 16 inch $18   would say particular pizza isn't worth price   Stay non specialty pizzas   The pizza dough light soft but didn't much flavor   cheese also wasn't worst moz but definitely isn't best   diced chicken cooked pre prepared frozen diced chicken   alfredo sauce wasn't salty which good but also more less mediocre     I jumped star service   waitress friendly made some small talk when she checked me   Unfortunately can't see myself going back when best pizza places valley just couple blocks west  <EOR> Great place three times food always excellent  Only complaint did take seemed long time actually food  <EOR> Ive multiple times read some reviews cant help but laugh nicest places Ive side town    FAR!!!
