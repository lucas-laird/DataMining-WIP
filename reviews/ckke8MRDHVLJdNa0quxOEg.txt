Great news people keep kosher place used place great atmosphere fantastic open till late finally drink kosher meal just something small prices also great! back again sure  <EOR> I've three times while food good  primary appeal excellent atmosphere  No other kosher restaurant Las Vegas any where close nice Anise  service also phenomenal husband laughing slick servers magically filling water  would definitely recommend restaurant above all others dates meetings  <EOR> Way overpriced extraordinarily average food  mom mushroom pasta which $20 just noodles some mushrooms nothing special oily  sauce would nice addition  $20 chicken breasts meal which only very thin dry but supposed 2  Instead butterflied take more surface area plate  seasoning decent  side dishes Spanish rice which salty  Also Israeli salad which basically slaw tomato onions cucumber  sent back since others restaurants where gotten same dish free garnish  replaced side Caesar salad which also bland  decor nice staff friendly but basically boring food's attempt fancied upscale yuppie environment  spend money elsewhere  <EOR> This third time always food delicious!!! Shawarma best Las Vegas! Must! recommend place everyone! Great atmosphere too! <EOR> I received groupon here  food nothing brag about  Israel salad mousakka sliders  would eat again  <EOR> Las Vegas large Jewish community did some research kosher restaurants found place    The menu large decent amount both tapas entrees  Party two came VERY hungry ordered 5 tapas plates enjoyed each one   The pita soft fresh delicious   The service great friendly staff!!  This place now must visit each time visit Las Vegas  <EOR> If give place 0 stars would  prices pay you'd expect outstanding service respect  Yet  last thing here  party 8 walked last night because simply don't care if stay mention night before spent good amount money  You're whole party gets food all different times your sides come before meal  If eat your eyes you  those prices bland food least show respect  Respect something won't here  <EOR> The worst!  large group reserved tables well advance  Pitchers water but no glasses over 20 minutes  But hey meantime while blame customer having nerve ask here's some spicy peppers greasy avocado egg rolls etc   What?  want your wine asked 45 minutes ago?  Tasted ass glass no could drink it   full 90 minutes still no took entrée order walked out  <EOR> First time friends suggestion  Hummus paella absolutely superb  Pita bread best Vegas really enjoyed selection small plate salads which seriously enough tasting party four  Good see part town finally great restaurant sure come often to  <EOR> 4 stars Great Customer Service!

Sweet!  3 stars food So Sunday friend late lunch    ordered three tapas try Drunken Avocado not sure but felt something missing ordered someone said Avocado eggrolls Cheesecake Factory  we agreed did not  Atun Tartare Great combo won ton chips however once again missing something   maybe some kind sauce? Hummus Con Carne Meat very flavorful tasted great hummus hummus very plain bean flavor strong   Pita bread very good! Warm fresh! Bummer did any Baklava left    Be sure check free sangria! <EOR> Check your receipts   they charging 8 25% tax when fact should 8 1%  called asked owners name manager Jennifer refused provide it  When asked tax rate she said 8 25%  shame manager doesn't even know tax rate  She then blame bank since ones installed computer  Hopefully extra cash collecting gets turned into state rather owners pockets  <EOR> Our first trip Anise okay very mediocre service but food excellent   second outing horrific very poor service untrained server working alone   She did everything wrong which reflects poorly  management would allow that  Worse food awful!  Overcooked chicken breast badly seasoned looked tasted burnt rubber  served mashed potatoes clearly made box nasty onion rings server substituted salad without asking us matzo ball soup watery tasteless broth  matzo balled lump poorly made dumpling tasted raw dough  Be warned! Pricing very high  meal almost $50 Groupon discount  restaurant's inconsistent food quality guaranteed poor service should put your maybe not list  If decide try anyway good luck  <EOR> What gem place! food fresh generously portioned sadly ran stomach before could order more  But really liked 'take your time' attitude  meeting friends knew would linger which problem some places  staff Anise actually encouraged take easy just enjoy evening  refreshing! manager also mentioned live music Tuesdays looking forward checking soon  <EOR> Amazing Tapas! the drinks yummy   the atmosphere great   a hidden gem Las vegas! <EOR> Amazing food incredible service atmosphere! truffle mushroom pappardelle awesome!

He comes over soon started ordering he said wait moment just flew another table then took some food kitchen counter another table THEN came back table take order  started ordering also asking some items menu looked new but wanted try  guy no patience wasn't really interested answering much  Why waiter then??? When asked pasta marinara sauce he said forget   Being mood pasta marinara sauce asked why he said kid menu item not only regular menu but NO kids menu whole menu all!!!!! said well adult? Quickly he responded no  obviously took word ordered something else instead  10 15 minuets waiting see someone another table eating pasta marinara sauce  When called waiter over ask he said don't know he made something himself eat   Surprised answer asked wasn't cooked same restaurant wasn't cooked restaurant staff then why available order considering LISTED MENU     PASTA SECTION REGULAR MENU? He kept repeating he doesn't know other guy having something he made himself  Finally he ran answers felt caught finally asked question he should asking all along said would now? said would simply order pasta marinara sauce  He said let find out  10 more minuets he came back said can't   point mad left when told he needs pay more attention negative reviews he nerves say more welcome never come back !!! says restaurant industry?? horrible  Unfortunately failed see restaurant industry upper hand  People hungry voluntarily walking into restaurant turn everything into opportunity  He could added some more pasta dish adult size increase price would still ordered happy  matter fact asked if made adult mean difference anyways??? guess difference waiter probably owner aren't good business good customer service  Otherwise wouldn't many unhappy customers  all asking wasn't rocket science!!

As party four state ordered four tapas pasta dish which came last incorrect   However servers much more concerned other patrons large table waited all four servers despite having already gotten food time came in  Even though table middle restaurant did water refills check ins  wanted order more tapas but decided against being completely ignored while other tables regulars waited hand foot  Great food lovely place but unfamiliar tourists Anise Tapas may best choice  <EOR> I held business dinner Anise few months ago both food service great  Sarit helped come selection tapas good group met budget  Staff attentive food tasted great   all all winner! particular group loved hummus schwarma fajitas  grilled vegetables delicious flavorful  Vegas often definitely back soon  <EOR> I liked staff vibe restaurant but food prices worthy star    The place crazy expensive tapas portion sizes don't think anyone really loved food  Everything tasted came microwave fast food restaurant  egg rolls probably highlight dinner but salads entrees tapas small portion flavorless just very tasty unfortunately    Also charged more drink advertised  <EOR> Got over hour before closing Mr  ponytail man took while seat while restaurant barely 1 4 full  When he tried seat he tried seat table right next door  asked further away he said no worries  Look over menu while table ready you  Then 8 minutes later he clears next table over us  Literally just close door   When asked table being cleared off much further cold door he shot back rushed clear table off you! But ok fine  most rude manner    All while chit chatting casually another customer    He made feel completely unwelcome totally uncomfortable  Sorry may dressed tzuit spoke 100% Hebrew but paying customers no way treat paying customer    We walked right out  lost current future business  Would recommend due poor rude service    DO GO <EOR> Have past enjoyed it  Anise tonight bit disappointed  empty food quickly which great  But ordered appetizers mains mains came 2 3 minutes apps  wish would taken more time bring mains because still enjoying appetizers  ended going back forth between main apps because didn't want main cold which little uncomfortable because everything different plates lot arm stretches all food brought out   I ordered mushroom pappardelle which underwhelming  couldn't really taste truffle infusion oil   The empanadillas delicious  mushroom hummus great but little pricey  <EOR> Great neighborhood place Topas  Ordered variety nice plates menu  sliders drunken avocado mushroom poppers Buffalo tacos  Every thing nicely prepared  Live music loved too  Great place first date  <EOR> Came family  fryer working many things menu available  Ordered hummus which decent  Tomates Ajo Asado which bland much olive oil  only ourselves other couple service terrible  ask water which water some type oil it other couple kitchen ask waitress bill   know smell when into old Red Robin seats smell  smelled like  would recommend going there  <EOR> Honestly great place some Mediterranean Authentic food gipsy kings background great bar highly recommend <EOR> For original tapas Mediterranean tradition place go   combination Spanish Greek Jewish Moroccon foods which place unique   Although dishes seem small plenty eat   Great sangria too   Spices sauces herbs wonderful only need couple tapas fill up   Better share healthy food   Service gr8 ambiance relaxing  <EOR> We came ordered Shawerma Israeli salad wingS  Shawerma point great flavor  grilled veggies good!!
