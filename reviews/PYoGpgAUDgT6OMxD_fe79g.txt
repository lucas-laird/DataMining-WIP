'braised spicy angler' according Google but I'd describe spicy monkfish  If you've never monkfish before texture similar catfish  careful because commonly served bones intact but very easy eat around dispose properly   The dakbal literally chicken feet served spicy seasoning sauce  huge fan dakbal because meat pretty scarce  However pretty good considering flavorful seasoning is  first choice but entirely bad either!  The meatjun which similar Korean pancake pajun delicious  safe bet if other two dishes sound little crazy you  thin layer batter outside tasty meat inside  Can't recall type meat but want say beef   They didn't liquor license when but owner did mention carry all popular Korean alcohol such soju makgoeli rice based bokbunja berry based wine    The interior dark dimmly lit which perfect some late night drinking fun  certainly vibe go to hang spot once serve alcohol finish decorating  felt little empty there   Will definitely return around December follow meal  <EOR> First impression when walked place empty   Found owner they've only open 10 days  sense me  Checked menu bulgogi plate aloha chicken plate go  While waited Owner gave some Kona coffee tea  Really good stuff  Service excellent she offered extra kimchi  could turn down?
