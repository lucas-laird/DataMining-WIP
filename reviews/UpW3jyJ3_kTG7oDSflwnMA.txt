Well rephrase best if your familiar Authentic Thai food enjoy Americanized Thai Food  Brutal comment but truth   When arrived pick food single Asian sight restaurant except workers course!  bit worried but took first bite Thai Beef Salad pretty impressed flavors!  sweet savory hint spice   Pretty much type flavor expected Thai style salad   disappointed Phad Thai!  Now EVERYONE said Phad Thai best well must say better!  rice noodles cooked well but type ingredients used wasn't tasteful kind reminded Chinese Sa Tay sauce rice noodles which expecting     I asked friend family Thailand experience she basically said good if Americanized Thai Food  responded well sometimes crave but prefer traditional Authentic food closer home     I mean come kind Authentic Thai food serves egg roll crispy won ton skin Phad Thai?  unoriginal American that!?    Although did rate place 3 Star I'd still come back yummy Thai Beef Salad!  Yum! <EOR> Best Thai Vegas far   really good Thai ever had   But really need kick AC  <EOR> Our family huge fan Pin Kaow   going try Prommares but instead chose Archi's     Food Tofu Pad Thai spicy level 6 Vegetable Fried Rice   Pad Thai ok   wasn't blown away wasn't left wanting more   asked server fry Tofu crisp came soft   should fried little bit longer   spice level appropriate enjoyable   felt same way Fried Rice   just ok   Atmosphere restaurant small tables kind feel top each other   prefer more private dining experience   party 6 people probably most I'd try take here   enough room larger groups but wouldn't feel comfortable opinion   Service service good   servers friendly   Will return?  Probably not     unless invited friend family member  <EOR> Archi's charming rustic feel place  inside decor relies much objects placed room fancy decorations adorning walls  paint looked old some patches wall  Overall restaurant looked clean little busy when seated   Their food didn't really blow water  better Thai food Vegas  food just average  yellow curry which comes jasmine rice your choice meat I chose beef   asked spiciness scale 1 10 4 just right hot but just enough spiciness flavorful  filling meal but probably better places same price range Archi's  When came dessert mochi ice cream menu  Unfortunately waiter told didn't even serve anymore menu update?     I'd probably come back because close proximity where live but wouldn't say amazing all hype seems have  <EOR> The service absolutely disgraceful  stayed Thailand always enjoyed world famous Thai hospitality   but sadly restaurant  Good good but service brought everything down 1 Star rating  If half star rating   they probably deserved it <EOR> OMG must best Thai place too   Everything tried delicious  food could very spicy if don't know ranking  eat spicy but #4 10 way spicy me  1 2 safe  did soup since serve bowl hot pot thing  lard favorite dish  Thai tea highly recommended since did very sweet huge glass  Most people table togo half glass   I did waitress kept forgetting many people table always missed something   This place tiny would recommend big group Sat Sunday  <EOR> AHHHH! absolutely love place  cousin husband practically eat anywhere anything anytime want because afford told favorite restaurants  trying myself definitely agree!

Hum?  Go into Archi's law enforcement chilling table seemed enjoying plate Thai food  restaurant bright large reminds where would eat your breakfast Hoilday Inn Express  don't think  bad thing but very bright  Friendly server sits immediately gives iced water  order beer Chardonnay tradition  WHAT? NO BEER WINE? sob      clearly marked Yelp review but didn't notice  Dumb  Anyway food order Sesame Toast egg rolls start  toast deep fried greasy egg rolls fine  10 year old McDonalds aficionado wants plain chicken fry plain chicken great  Teen wants chicken fried rice Mongolian beef dish ordered 3 10 heat spice scale she thoroughly enjoyed it  Wifee ordered same but being spicy food bigshot she 7 10  Good choice wifee happy  take chicken cashew dish 5 10 pathetic know equally happy  many Thai clientele eating place charming  Great food $70 before tip back Archi's but believe other locations give beer quench thirst alleviate heat should crazy order food 6 10 spice meter  <EOR> Food Service very good   Ran into few dishes crazy but overall recommended  <EOR> This Archi's location just down street temporary housing arrangement pass regularly way doctor's appointment   located fairly old strip mall W  Flamingo timing perfect today drop quick lunch check Yelpers said reasonably priced lunch special Thai restaurant    When arrived around 11 30am already several tables occupied diners having lunch   But quickly greeted petite waitresses seated large table comfortably seat 4 6   felt little guilty since dining alone   But didn't end being issue since restaurant didn't packed thought based hectic place gets during mad rush lunch crowd   Anyway noticed selections lunch specials rather small compared entire menu offerings   But Red Curry Chicken also ordered Thai Iced Coffee   waitress soon returned really generous size glass Thai Iced Coffee definitely largest glass Iced Coffee ever served  Happy Surprise = +1 Yelp meter   The Red Curry Chicken alright   flavor curry 5 spiciness Thai spicy scale good  But chicken really tough didn't care all  egg roll served 99% box really taste prominent white pepper filling wrapper   Ambiance good dining area rather small but didn't bother me  during lunch good amount ambient lighting outside which believe good thing   Anyway am going come back try some more cooking Thai mothers grandmothers working back  Because seated table facing small window where kitchen passes prepared plates served all see bunch women other side working kitchen  <EOR> Archie's opened third location! located Village Square Sahra Ft  Apache  usual great food! owner cooked himself!  I can't believe kayla's comments  She's obviously isn't famaliar Thai food say Archie's food un Thai  matter fact curry made scratch paste  Thai maid when lived Asia KNOW REAL THAI FOOD tastes IT! <EOR> Great food  little Americanized but great nonetheless  Noodle dishes absolutely best pad thai junkie  sweet spicy Unless alter spice rating perfectly balanced  meat dishes perfectly seasoned well  haven't chance try curry but seen lot other diners eating heard lot great things it  appetizers stuffed chicken wings favorite  don't know but two over sized drumsticks stuffed noodles vegetables fried golden brown served tasty plum dipping sauce  try it  Also opinion Thai cuisine best fried rice amongst all Asian countries  Try Archi's pineapple fried rice tell don't agree   The location W  Flamingo original spot its extremely small accommodates 25 30 people max  But decor very homey full great people  service friendly attentive helpful  new location off S  Rainbow 215 whole lot bigger but food service consistent original location  If love Thai food try place out  <EOR> Ate Archi's few days ago   had lunch special spicy basil chicken  AMAZING! Ive eaten lots Thai food but ranks favorites Vegas  Highly recommend!! <EOR> My second favorite Archi's locations around town  all same great menu items  Some cosider favorite location because original but enjoy rainbow location's ambience service slighty better  Still great definitely worth trip though!   As all Archi's locations stick tofu pork beef vegetable most time  chicken always tends little dry overcooked  Just personal opinion  Pad Thai Papaya Salad Curries Tom Kha Veggies Thai Jerky favorites but really isn't bad thing menu except Thai Macaroni just stay away that!  Happy eating! <EOR> Went early lunch Saturday  fact party 4 5 min opening   Today's meal disappointing hence only three stars  usually enjoy Pai Tai ordered again today  Today taste off way off  gave feeling getting yesterday's left overs warmed up   taste bland really bland   Usually some very enjoyable tastes  New chef?? Hungover chef? Help always good meal until today   Our soup tasty always   My biggest complaint most times bring everything near same time spring roll soup entree  really would space bit especially when restaurant busy   Not sure when return  last visit left bad tast mouth literally   think time find another TAI place again open awhile  <EOR>
