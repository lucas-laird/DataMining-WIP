The staff very attentive guests needs cleaning needed tables guests  Thanks Wendy's Arville having fabulous staff  <EOR> I know know Wendy's? FOUR stars? Yes yes  rarely review places but such fantastic experience needed let Yelperverse know it  old school Wendy's meaning fancy pretty worn down worn not so nice part town  imagine surprise when came only spotlessly clean two employees constantly wiping down tables packed obvious regulars lots old timers chatty fellow line behind informed such     It's clear many employees lifers meaning always always work Wendy's  means super efficient true superstars fast food chain  older lady took order we lots substitutions zero issues 100% correct first time    When food arrived both shocked  hands down best Wendy's food we'd long long time  burgers hot fresh perfectly seasoned buns fluffy cheese melting gooey produce high quality if didn't know better you'd guess higher end burger restaurant  lettuce crisp brown nor wilted pickles perfect super red ripe tomatoes sliced uniformly  can't say enough great burger was    It's fine but several homeless people and mentally ill man hanging parking lot broad daylight at 1 30 pm Saturday afternoon   didn't intend harm anyone but them came inside started walking around talking random customers disappearing into restroom he never came back before left employees didn't ask leave   dock them star  People freaking feeling uncomfortable would recommend location some better security manager training better deal situations this    For obvious reasons I'd suggest use drive thru window instead choosing dine in  But dang good Wendy's! <EOR> I eat least once month against better judgement but always hoping finger chili  never try any new sandwiches anything stick chili  no means good but hell less $2 helps everything come easier morning  <EOR> Why lucky enough 2 stars? food usually ok  service HORRIBLE!!! Every time order any sort food item pull wait even if no behind line    why?!? Ill tell why! being timed  know FAST food but don't want your customers happy rather then worry timer? especially love when give food car behind asked pull forward first  pretty sure isn't rocket science junior bacon       Their wild berry lemonade die for! Don't late night else watered down    They didn't chocolate frosty hubby tried chocolate frosty shake  First gross  Second he found 2 pieces plastic while drinking it  tried caramel frosty once again GROSS love caramel but used way much  <EOR> My husband craving Wendy's long time because moved area where don't it  trip Vegas figured wanted eat because haven't long  Needless say food ok but service sucked  lady kept rushing order wasn't done ordering she kept telling total  won't back location but then again all other locations same sad reviews  <EOR> So just purchased some food service ok guess little better last time  Except time FOUND HAIR FROSTY! throw rest food out  Disgusting  <EOR> Rude cashier!!!! Some big girl  come all time but 1st    spanish lady before she nice good service    But big girl 2nite took order then outside smoking don't know if break she off right taking order but she needs talking management! <EOR> Welcome Wendy's rather no welcome all    I placed order drive thru most experienced consumers sure specific possible assure minimal confusion  She asked answered nothing ordinary  paid food while doing brief glance awkward waiting period before left  Assured everything left without thought head   About ten minutes into drive heading home feeling checked bad once more  no sauce which both specific when ordered well two cookies  just many different scenarios encountered Wendy's location  Upon second arrival made complaint drive thru where acknowledged told drive window  When pulled window asked again complaint even though just explained made feel acknowledged  I only granted sauce two missing cookies yet nothing else compensate inconvenience  This location lacks service awareness consideration  Yet worst part Wendy's location expected incompetence but simple theme caring  just care  but customer cycle hundred see single work period  enjoy Wendy's but enjoy employee's disregard others  <EOR> Just order food lady named Rosã taking orders just rude rushed  Didn't even greet just said What's Your Order didn't give min before pushing order again  Both chicken nuggets told sauce wanted she didn't bother put any sauce nuggets bag  did drive thru 3 years burger king she should working that     very displeased service! Also just home fund she didn't even give all food!!!! Thanks guys! <EOR> Haven't Wendy's long time given gift card thought I'd try improved burgers    I bacon cheese burger combo now choose many options instead fries add salad baked potato   fries     The burger really very good made fresh toasted bun couple thick apple smoked bacon strips pickles lettus tomato   enjoyed very much reminded home style mom made kids! <EOR> Rude nasty service drive thru! Whoever taking order very curt least bit friendly bordering contempt  ordered nuggets fries everything stone cold  When asked new food wasn't cold given terrible attitude employee   I NEVER return location  <EOR> The food served cold  only think almost burned mouth chicken nuggets  asked them remake food  time fries nuggets hit but burgers still cold  Asked refund burgers lady wants argue fresh! Fresh doesn't mean heated proper temperature  maybe 5 people whole store produce hot food  can't solely based name Wendy's deliver well  location did not  <EOR>
