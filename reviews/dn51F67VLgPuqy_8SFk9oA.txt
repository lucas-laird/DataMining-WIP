Service spotty times but food great matching price point! <EOR> Bestes Steak n Eggs zum Breakfast  Das Ellis Island ist gleich hinter dem Vegas Strip   Das Casino ist schon etwas älter und die Brauerei riecht man deutlich  Aber das Cafe ist ideal für ein Frühstück wenn man Jetlag hat Das Cafe ist von der Atmosphäre ein 0815 Lokal   Der Service ist durchschnittlich aber freundlich  Aber es gibt ein gutes Steak mit Rührei und Toast für $6 99 Für Vegas ein sehr guter Preis und das alleine ist es Wert anstelle der Frühstücks Buffets einmal ins Ellis Island zu gehen  <EOR> I'll admit having low expectations place just needed something vegetarian friendly near hotel goddamn Strip prices  But Alfredo surprisingly good steamed broccoli fresh green service fast friendly  <EOR> Cannot wrong steak special here  Better any other non steakhouse steak Las Vegas cheap  Now require $5 coin deal but still worth it! <EOR> We arrived around 12 15am no wait  Note sign place reads Village Pub  Service little slow server  Restaurant 60% full  She greeted drink order took 8 mins two waters  ordered around 12 30am two steak specials cup chicken noodle soup cause figured soup would come fast starving when here  Soup took while come but just happy little something me   When say cup soup half cup lol thing super small  watery side barely any noodles chicken  served hot though which appreciated   Onto steaks! finally 1am! 30 mins Steggs which longest ever wait ever    I agree other yelpers stegg late night special even though $2 more other places probably best Vegas  The cafe Arizona Charlie's boulder highway close second me  plus didn't need players card special ellis The quality steaks actually good cooked almost perfect  ordered medium bf wanted medium rare  medium well he medium    The steaks weren't grainy tough when cut into delicious juices actually retained steaks notice pic posted  also seasoned well   The potatoes o'brien luke warm hot sadness   poached eggs cooked half soft boiled half hard boiled  toasts didn't much butter them   sadness again    The karaoke did annoying but somewhat entertaining same time lol  Overall came steaks steaks actually satisfied  I'd  rather pay little more enjoy food rather rely solely price enjoy while eating   We did see table next order king cut prime rib must say looks darn good  thing HUGE! Definitely plenty two share 2 inches thick! good price boot $16   We'll back try prime rib next time sure well raved French onion soup <EOR> I overly impressed place honest  asking around some good places eat some fellow vacationers someone told Ellis Island  decided would give try due highly tourist talked it   This place couple good things but overall don't think going back    First all really loud because middle casino karaoke right next door if you're looking intimate place take someone your place  know Vegas casinos everywhere but feel place would more success if secluded restaurant    We ordered calamari appetizer then decided would spaghetti sausage  fancier name menu but  was  impressed all spaghetti all  noodles weren't cooked very well sauce tasted justo poured can  only thing through sausage even wasn't very good  would honestly give food 2 star  2 because saw some other meals looked decent  hand brewed Rootbeer amazing if stop though    What made give extra star place waiter  guy pretty awesome  He personal he did great job incredibly helpful when all ordering  really appreciate higher end restaurant    Overall won't find back because many places better right around town  place potential better just missing few elements really progress business  <EOR> Truly deserved 5 stars  Open 24 hours!

When food came everybody's plate came correct but mine  Want guess didn't done? Yep! omelet came full cholesterol yellow ever! clear simple request didn't put because he busy being damn condescending  brought attention right away he brought small plate scoop plate potatoes says well want them over DUH wtf? 20 minutes finished side order pancakes some friends plate because she felt bad still hadn't received order  Another person party didn't et wheat toast came meal asked 3 times it!

Issue service received   My girlfriend two friends Sunday night  Now wasn't horribly busy but wasn't empty either  table waiter gets drinks  all order appetizers soups salads meals  far good  few minutes later all could use refill drinks  waiter disappeared looks other waiters busy  brought soups salads but no appetizer  Given portion size actually didn't mind receiving appetizer  Asked waiter refill drinks he just nods heads  don't ever see refill  meals then shortly came once again asked refill drinks  Waiter nods head still no refills no sign waiter thereafter  getting ridiculous    The food amazing! Definitely made lack service receiving  finish meals where Ellis Islas cafe downhill  check notice charged appetizers never received  grab another waiter waiter  waiter reluctantly comes tell mistake check  He looks says sorry he correct it  also insist  speak manager supervisor  He agrees then says oh would guys refills?     we only asked refills few times already never received them   We wait 15 minutes manager doesn't show ask again  Another 15 minutes pass he finally shows but doesn't come table  He talks waiter looks then rolls eyes whispers something waiter walks away  now new tab shows $5 off appetizers never received still tab  once again ask waiter please manager talk straightened out  never talk manager but finally another 20 minutes problem fixed   I really did enjoy food especially prices  However service little less desired almost hesitant come back  <EOR> Love place   Best prime rib fish n chips drinks desserts   Service just terrific   highly recommend   Water  75  very reasonable compared rest Las Vegas  <EOR> Our experience started off little rocky lounge area  never acknowledged wait staff back hostess requested seated dinning area  Once experience improved drastically  food 15 minutes very good  However food wasn't really hot  Felt sitting while  Overall food good price even better!! husband only spent $18  <EOR> Heard place through father in law   all say WOW!!!! food amazing well customer service  strongly recommend chicken fried chicken eggs wheat toast!!! wife chicken waffles  it crazy good some! service tons food price great!!!!!
