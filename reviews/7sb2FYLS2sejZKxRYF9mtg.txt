Once entered restaurant waiter took order appetizers  He then brought paper where would fill write many pieces nigiri rolls other items  swear ordered fewer nigiri showed but never gave paper back service pretty fast  sushi just kept coming coming coming   point servers asked if still wanted yuzu yellowtail because much food table  servers kept coming asking if everything alright  gave check once ordered dessert but then took forever take payment  stopped checking then    They only allow 1 order per person specials which including screaming o salmon belly avocado bomb mango salmon  bit sad only offered 1 order salmon belly person  shrimp came huge fried shrimp side only came shrimp per order  also only order ocean trout    One things didn't different sauces put top  would rather just eat fish itself    Now some information yelp changed  green tea panna cotta black sesame dessert mochi fried bananas tempura ice cream mini honey toast could only pick which bummed because  favorite part  believe allow unlimited ice cream least didn't limit it  oysters seasonal didn't any  no longer serve soft shell crab   They offer 2 1 alcoholic  friends ordered yogurt soju  soju pretty good but drink size pretty small   probably why such deal! <EOR> My favorite Sushi place 702  Price great but most all food amazing! delicious top all off staff super friendly very attentive  great experience every time!

Anyways mainly ate nigiri Yellowtail Salmon Super White Tuna etc   all succulent quite fresh!  liked sauces some nigiri because each complimented fish   We tried order Uni Sea Urchin but sushi chef head chef maybe? came person apologize he couldn't shipped week because supplier told Uni weren't fresh due weather conditions   totally ok both thought thoughtful come over tell that     So all sushi lovers come over Sakana    food definitely worth trying! <EOR> I usually love Sakana but last experience made want again because just worth it  over year decided mom birthday   When entered no line plenty seating  bar empty all empty half booths left 1 empty booth right  mom asked booth any side she's late 50's back problems but allowed since only party two said anticipating party 4's 6's  weren't any reservation signs except big table middle  mom insisted but didn't want push because didn't want take chance bad service   When ordering mom questions some items  server did know some sushi items admitted he doesn't know much because he doesn't even eat sushi  Really?  Anyway meal good but great The salmon sushi did taste buttery delicious last times went  also really bummed ran plum ice cream   favorite main reason wanted Sakana  going order 5 scoops too  settled honey toast  okay   While eating noticed young couple being seated half booths left  the servers split 4 top table them even though empty 2 top table right behind me  kinda annoyed me  only told mom when she paying she pissed off  talked supervisor repeated anticipating party 4 6  didn't because booths now groups 4 but couple them extra empty half booth 2  more tables 2 trying bad excuses  didn't want big deal but annoyed because birthday mom really upset felt discriminated against the couple white we're filipino  rushed mom never look back  <EOR> Not only service fast but fish rice ratio amazing! quality fish also surprisingly fresh  new favorite sushi joint Vegas  <EOR> Worth re paying for  Liking decors great sushi chefs servers  husband finished 6 rounds but if would asked he still wants order but feel bad keep ordering told just etiquette purposes let's greedy all  doing experience come back next time  <EOR> This far best AYCE sushi buffet to   gone goyemon yama which great sushi buffets own rights    Where start   Lets begin location  Located right off strip its close towards MGM mandalay yet avoids busy n hectic traffic most hotel buffets  Ample amounts parking help goodness more quickly!!!

First time going could happier  food outstanding prices very reasonable we all eat service great  probably try eat more time before leave but definitely back next time come vegas  <EOR> We would always Goyemon when Vegas but anymore   now AYCE sushi place Vegas   would say food quality similar but lot more family friendly charging half price 6 year old charging 3 year old whereas Goyemon full price adults kids  sure if picked good night but no crazy lines other sushi places service also better lot more friendly!  Looking forward coming back    <EOR> CAUTION! location solicits reviews obviously affecting rating system  fliers each table offering free drink if show them completed posted Yelp review! wrong! said HUGE disappointment!   The bad besides HUGE offense already mentioned The cuts sushi thick but poorly sliced  Eel burned BBQ sauce WAY sweet! Wasabi paste which ok since real wasabi hard come but heavy horse radish terrible! California rolls mushy mayonnaise paste filling  understand some sushi places while don't generally inedible     The reason two stars instead 1 service wasn't terrible  While she did forget sake but staff generally friendly prompt  some interesting specials  all you can eat option both lunch dinner which well executed does leave dollars wallet   bonus  2 1 drinks nice touch  While sushi mediocre all you can eat drinks specials nice   BOTTOM LINE Sakana does deserve 5 star reviews continually gets  solicits reviews requires patron show POSTED review free drink  Naturally encourage guest give higher review since must shown while dining appalling! Even if specials enough entice back unethical Yelp abuse forces boycott location until remedied  <EOR> Great sushi funny names decent price  much more say  <EOR> Went back Sakana second visit group sushi lovers  Seems name no longer Sakana but changed Kabuki under new management  No lit signage tell where restaurant outside  downfall new people coming bit tricky find    We ordered many rolls which seemed over sauced actually taste any fish many them  Best Japanese Nachos Salmon Loves Lemon  Also seemed more 1 2 rolls menu spicy something another  lot baked deep fried rolls which am fan of  Ordered lots nigiri well  say portion fish rice fairly decent wasn't much rice nice thinner longer piece fish  Fish seemed ok most part but just good when visited original time    Service ok but seemed 1 waitresses taking orders table did want there  Felt she rushing few times when asked nigiri missing she triple questioned if gotten instead just going placing order  reassure received particular order missing item    I would given place solid 3 stars because food decent but good original time when when called Sakana so so service  But 1 star fact when used restroom huge cock roach crawling floor  Ugh  Felt sick stomach seeing just eaten raw fish  Bathroom also very dirty no toilet paper roll  going back  such shame such fan 1st visit  <EOR> Absolutely best sushi ever had!!! husband visit Vegas lease three times year tradition eat every time no matter what!!!! only wish place would open Cali SushiRox!!!!

Maybe if regulars would more sense  <EOR> Decided try AYCE sushi spot since friend told pretty good plus reviews shabby    Upon entering place pretty slow dead    couple people bar people couple tables  sure if because Monday not   But no worries only meant more attention us   We wrong     Service pretty terrible waiter waitress couldn't help maybe 7 people including us ? Wonder service when busy  We lots items missing never brought us  Wait times between items ordering tops 10 15 mins most dinner consists waiting sitting eventually food settling stomachs   Quality sushi best but still decent  did don't put much rice rolls  Also items choose appetizer menu little one  mainly liked 911 Roll I'm usually spicy roll type person but really tasty! other rolls appetizers ok all shrimp tempura shrimp tempura  ¯\_ ? _ ¯  This visit definitely last hopefully service alot better next time  <EOR> First off let say even Vegas   California going Sakana MUST when Vegas     I'm huge sushi lover sushi many different sushi restaurants   far best sushi had   normally scared try new sushi rolls because very picky usually end leaving fully satisfied flavor   However yet walk away Sakana unsatisfied   tried 7 different sushi's loved every single them   favorite would 911 sushi roll   spiciest sushi yet can't enough it   finish off your meal would recommend Monkey Brain sushi   Tastes dessert some sort banana filling middle   You'll keep coming back more The location where restaurant located little deceiving   Its pretty fancy outside but when walk completely different   very inviting dim lights music background very friendly staff   mention food served very quickly!!

Fast forward bit now visited Sakana thrice last month so  Why anywhere else sushi? Every visit opted AYCE option worth every penny  3 visits under belt opportunity try multitude offerings   Some standouts been Shit which regrettably skipped over first time but never visit without ordering again  dipping sauce paired really sets apart  swear sauce used basically anything menu any other menu matter much better  Try don't rookie mistake  Bulgogi Nachos struck counterintuitive amongst other items menu but finally tried them some best nachos had  served small bowl but could eat standard full size nacho servings worth things  beef tender delicious spicy sauce again sets apart   The Nigiri options pretty extensive cuts meat hefty taste fresh  Unagi octopus stand some favorites   The rolls offered vary style size just every tried pleased palette  deep fried rolls Golden California safe choice simply deep fried Philly roll but doesn't disappoint  Monkey Brains more unique deep fried option banana being focal point components  While wasn't bad least favorite rolls   The Something Wrong No Name Mexican Roll standout brain far specialty rolls go   Being such rookie sushi eatin status baked rolls somewhat new but such great discovery  lobster lasagna baked lobster roll Wet Dream just right size AYCE patrons  yes they're delicious   Service point majority 3 visits far  1 year old some peers he grumpy waitstaff multiple occasions done great job giving extra attention keep happy  huge because hate feeling we're bothering other diners definitely made feel welcome  Big PLUS book   Yes nothing compare why venture away greatness? perhaps review isn't worthy  BUT   I mouth  used eat lots food  taste buds work  through magic science beyond understanding am able distinguish between tastes good doesn't   Sakana tastes good  <EOR> Yum Yum Yum Yum!!!

There's much wanted try but full to  Next time!  The service quick even though place packed  short wait table but bad  Dinner $25 95 if eat least two rolls your own I mean can't? then AYCE option worth price   Awesome rice fish ratio  I know  important esp cheap asses want money's worth even though dining companion treated LOL   only allow order each certain items namely uni amaebi oyster salmon belly I think   uni hit miss  couple pieces really nice sweet  others much  Also fried heads amaebi thick batter head itself didn't taste fresh again good other not    The hamachikama collar tiny kinda fishy  used to  But plenty items great multiples of  unagi faves    The staff very attentive since want fast turn over rate  don't sit digest your food eat less  just let order ever much want clear plates quickly  soon your table starting bare come take another order   Are more authentic higher quality places town?

It came pretty fast    lightning fast  But rather struck lightning eat lightning fast food  gagging due terrible taste each roll  tasted rotten terrible  spicy rolls tasted salty sour bitter same time  did even expect possible  did taste spicy  took all strength continue chewing  took half cup water down each roll  harder harder along  first wondering rid rolls without paying eating them  But point where boyfriend just enough  willing pay EXTRA finish rolls  didn't want them anywhere near anymore    Cost? Pretty cheap but each roll fail eat they'll charge extra  Bail rice? Charged rice skipped over on  accept lost over torture   Service?

Any roll would generally taste sweet way sweet here  Left wondering if Japanese restaurant styled cater American sweet tooth  raw sushi also wasn't good fresh sushi joints frequent California @ fraction price   salmon LOOKED fatty but didn't   taste fatty   Weird experience me  <EOR> Was okay    didn't AYCE because am vegetarian but vegetable roll full lettuce rabbit???

Ew  My friend both AYCE dinner $22 95 appetizer labeled THE SHIT! must try which more shitty shit opinion  friend really liked though  also 2 for 1 sapporo deal which pretty awesome because 2 huge bottles enough fill 4 cups    The sashimi salad hooked sashimi which good because don't eating bunch rice AYCE places gets unnecessarily full  also ordered salmon yellowtail albacore sashimi which all tasted pretty fresh but definitely best fish  Really thin slices too  sashimi roll good stuffed assorted raw fish rapped cucumber no rice   friend ordered spicy crab roll basically california roll but spicy crab monster roll baked lobster roll baked scallop roll which all pretty good    This place kinda smelled clorox but wasn't anything overbearing  <EOR> My first time coming amazing  last visit sushi still amazing but couple things little annoying    First chairs crazy uncomfortable  basically just small box sit put little pillow it  wasn't even back rest it  put purse car because no room put anywhere    Second wow wait time your food drags  took forever rolls come even longer nigiri  Mind wasn't even busy  very end decided order dessert because just waiting waiting nigiri  Which took 5 seconds devour    Other those 2 complaints   freshness food still over powered complaints  rice fish ratio amazing  best seen   Still 1 favorite sushi joints town still probably return but hopefully fix seats before come back    <EOR> This place awesome!

Here's favorite favorite part Sakana  sure other nigiri lovers' favorite also  FISH RICE RATIO = BEAUTIFUL  Gorgeous amount fresh fish top small bed rice  THATS best    Like dessert? Choose ice cream features dessert menu  End fishy taste sweet tooth! <EOR> Yuck keep moving      All rice next no fish    AYCE really bad option  Unless want unlimited fried rice deep fried foods  fish selection poultry no pun intended     I guess maybe im spoiled cause something called standards  Ive eaten plenty AYCE sushi places doesnt even measure worst them  <EOR> This first time food great  quality fish good definitely your money's worth  Gotta love lil whole wall joints  <EOR> This $25 95 dinner AYCE sushi restaurant   certain items limit per dinner those items first   novices filled great signature rolls offered   NIGIRI first then fill rest other items take previous stomach space  !  Also dessert limited well need some allocation analysis fit all want try meal   only reason why lost star kept waiting nearly 15 minutes between meal before nigiri sushi came out   large party before but four sushi chefs working think lost order   waiter came back twice didn't see food table he back forth see delay   took hostess check food before something table   very strange but guess extra 15 minutes digest food could fit MORE!!  But people waiting table weren't finished meal wasn't such good deal them keep occupying table without eating since waiting things come out   definitely good again!! <EOR> Good AYCE sushi restaurant   Fish seemed fresh rice well seasoned   Enjoyed options hand rolls some which also available specialty rolls    Wanted sit bar but enough room   Service ok but bit hit miss order service staff seemed cover lot tables bussing staff spot hence preference sit bar when possible     Solid choice AYCE sushi very competitive other options LV but quite distinguishable best among very best without some menu service enhancements  <EOR> Eh Sakana lot just doesn't seem much consistency  food compared sister shop Neko just isn't same  When boyfriend lunch greeted bunch no's  asked bigger table said no because expecting lunch rush never came   wanted pay more dinner could order salmon belly no because don't prepare early two pieces sushi left busser hesitant take because he wanted check AYCE  Idk just never good experience last few times probably won't ever again  Sushi Neko way better  only came since remodeling  But food just so so  Fast services but still just underwhelming experience  <EOR> I tried place couple years ago service sucked  took 20 min each roll  swore I'd never come back but decided give another chance happy did  bf came Friday I know wasn't smartest idea but surprisingly service super fast time  rolls very good well nigiri  bf back sure  <EOR> Sakana main sushi spot over year now  Every time we're always treated nicely no bad things say food  sushi melts your mouth always flavorful!

Highlights salmon belly comes touch wasabi thought great unagi amaebi scallop free salmon sashimi thing beginning chefs thought friend cute heh    I ordered bunch saucy nigiri lot people seemed them yuzu yellowtail super white tuna w S O sauce smoked paprika salmon w yuzu   Personally didn't care any them  the sauces did add much aside oily sheen fish?  Do order Saba misoyaki lacking miso taste deboned  fish bones mouth every bite  know mackerel oily fish but excessively oily   I also gave mushroom skewer try equally disappointed  Literally 1 1 4 plain mushroom stick shriveled each quarter size thumb  Took note avoid ordering any appetizers future visits   Service friendly but kind awkward  main server refilled hardly touched water would asked several times if everything alright different people when told them just waiting something seemed surprised  really wish would system where mark down want yourself rather taking your order we repeat initial big order several times    So why 4 stars despite all complaints? fish rice ratio!! could literally wrap fish around entire rice ball more  most part enjoyed nigiri got  Worth calories potential mercury poisoning practically rolled out! <EOR> This time around service point! food just better better  recommend finishing off Lemon Salmon Roll    perfect! Everything delicious don't think thing just popping flavor  large selection Nigiri appetizers  <EOR> Hidden gem!!! favorite used Goyemon but really popular wait always super long increased prices think $26 99 dinner fish rice ratio horrible now compared before  Anyway     Lunch ends 3 only $20 95! came 2 30 only 5 other tables restaurant  Service great sushi came really really quick dirty dishes always taken away waters always refilled    Sushi tasted fresh give HUGE slices fish  think only complaint fish slices should little less thick because difficulty shove entire thing your mouth  Also sweet sauces use some rolls bit overwhelming  Other then good selection rolls limited appetizers mussels potbelly! AYCE dessert but end your meal you'll full care promise    The unagi good  tried white tuna didn't but bf loved saying rare AYCE place would offer it  course salmon lover ordered bunch salmon rolls  Yes order half rolls here!!

If you're willing risk having diarrhea vomiting while you're Vegas all means give place shot    That aside food actually pretty good especially flavoring but sure freshness sushi  enjoyed meal buffet good value  I'd rate place 4 5 stars if no sick  But when comes sushi freshness your health number priority    If really want maybe sit closer bar look fish quality watch handle your food first  Also always safer stick hot food  agedashi tofu good  order came 3 pieces 2 orders those    Service good too  really bad 3 sick  hoping would regular spot Vegas  Nope  chance  <EOR> So much sushi! really busy place specially weekends when everyone escaping Vegas weekend  tried pretty much everything menu  all eat $26 sure really big appetite cause party couldn't! <EOR> I never come back ever again  first time came loved it  Second time pushing it  last time came choice hated it  Right when walked did ever smell going on  Second waiter name did horrible  Super rude all pleasant  He bald asian guy bad personality  seated he took down some appetizers us  When asked sushi he gave attitude said don't take order bring piece paper yourself   incident when he came pick paper read order 8 rolls four us   He told really unprofessional way guys ordered 8 rolls  lot food   looked reals right now?   Anyways asked if please yellowtail bloodline the red part   Omg he fit!

My brother said best  Japanese Tapas place! <EOR> The service really bad  forgot half order told last minute salmon belly  least 3 servers but seemed avoiding table  servers actually walked fast he kicked back chair tripped  No apology no acknowledgment trying server's attention  When finally made eye contact server he put finger wait  took another 5 minutes come table  fish quality little off night  Hit miss place   Considering already low expectations ayce sushi still disappointed place   Good thing parking ample no wait during Sunday dinner time  <EOR> This best AYCE sushi places to! Mainly because nigiri fresh don't stuff rice  $25pp dinner thought pretty reasonable ate LOT  fish rice ratio other reviews says 3 1  definitely means eat more sashimi less rice which appreciate  ordered almost all nigiri list dinner favorite probably hamachi yuzu hamachi  seared salmon eel werepretty good too  lot rolls also pretty good but rice might fill bit  ordered double dragon roll someone else ordered spicy rolls which both delicious  uni actually pretty fresh when compared some other reviews friends liked mussels oysters  just big mussel oyster person general  ordered everything off list could only order once but thought just okay    What did lack probably organization skills  wait quite awhile seated little confused why table 3 came party 5 asked sit down first long bench area middle restaurant when clearly could seated there  Luckily didn't seated late them people leaving but little annoying  Also appetizers ordered way early evening never until end meal even though kept asking every time    All all would come back because thought pretty worth all fish rolls ate! <EOR> What Asian girl doesn't sushi? cute little place little knick knacks placed around restaurant everywhere looked something find  Service good drinks never empty  Sushi came quickly which can't complain about  Good very tasty everyone else mentioned rice fish ratio 1 1  thing notice good sushi rice compacted enough where stays together pick dipping soy soft enough when hits your mouth rice fall apart its own without first chew  know sounds weird but true  Lastly just mention black sesame panna cotta desert perfect sweet but still tastes roasted seeds excellent  boyfriend says tasted rubber tire but he does Asian deserts much go  <EOR> This such pleasant surprise!!! searching quick stop sushi came upon hole wall restaurant  green monster regular spicy tuna roll both great cheap! service also quick ambiance inviting love cute seat cushions   kind tucked away road but definitely worth stop  Can't wait tell more friends it! <EOR> Sakana bomb  Good service great AYCE menu cool dining atmosphere complete banging tunes  Although maki rolls ain't anything shake stick nigiri much more memorable  If you're visiting Vegas part world lacking strong sushi offering dedicate your precious gastric space nigiri  having visited Sakana past seem gotten even better over time terms both food service  <EOR> The first time best friend visited place outrageously good  overall quality fish rice fish ratio nigiri point  gone back more three times now together individually other friends dramatically declined quality just food but service  owners quite nice experienced but servers always always always forget two    three things order    I decided take few coworkers work other day because craving sushi long day last experience know personally would never back  only did forget three things ordered table but sent two rolls never even ordered  quality fish variable could tell yellowtail fresh because its distinct smell taste  disappointing miso soups came late room temperature best without tofu  Some baked rolls ordered came huge amount mayo overpowered taste content  rolls dragon came brown avocado slices    Completely lost appetite eating some yellowtail nigiri seeing that    place definitely gained some mad popularity first time visited maybe just don't care quality used to? but advice    consistent quality fish service friendly but extremely slow forgetful overall pay AYCE sushi place never come bring people back recommend visit vegas  <EOR> Tried dinner all eat  Great value great quality black sesame dessert something haven't seen LV area  back again  <EOR> Excellent sushi price   variety world many fish variants available more 70% restaurants to    The quality good most rolls but couple bit wet where tilt plate juices sauces would pool lower end right under sushi pieces    Nigiri fish portion astronomically larger rice portion   huge plus which greatly enhanced dining experience   rolls good amount fish well     Overall experience great enjoyed it   Ambiance nice wait time long   Service quick order being placed well  <EOR> BEST AYCE Sushi town!

This review base food alone service  If old Asian lady isn't serving most likely going okay service less  <EOR> Reasonable quality All eat   made experience much better great Jose's customer service     back sure if he Im leaving  thank you <EOR> This review AYCE option  If opted AYCE rating would perhaps higher since quantity often trumps quality case  But ordering regular rolls list price Sakana just worth it    The interior pretty typical Japanese restaurant although did notice freestanding tables towards middle interestingly arranged diamond formation rather square  Service fine tea refills plentiful although waiter failed inquire whether table ordering off menu doing AYCE  He just assumed doing AYCE option even though only ordered three rolls    Bam Bam roll The fish mushy top fish even mushier inside ingredients unevenly distributed throughout roll  appreciated roll wasn't made plethora rice just filler but paper thin pieces fish almost tasteless    Lemon salmon roll Again nice ratio other ingredients rice but imitation crab inside saturated mayonnaise hard time tasting anything else  salmon slices top little more generous roll but lemon wedges unevenly cut placed  may fine AYCE but paying $10+ lack attention detail disappointing  roll also served pictured  piece lying flat  because piece large irregularly sliced couldn't stand other pieces variably cut into larger smaller pieces well   Popcorn lobster roll worst meal  actually saying something  lobster balls top some minced seafood variety but honestly couldn't taste any seafood flavor  also overly breaded bordered being over fried goopy sauce top did nothing alleviate lack flavor  sushi pieces bottom again sloppily made cut into all different sizes which made whole dish even more unappetizing  wouldn't recommend even AYCE option   I'm confused high ratings here  Perhaps came off day perhaps endless nigiris ordered during AYCE could offset subpar sushi skills unappetizing ingredients   but probably won't back find out  <EOR> Hands down best places eat sushi Vegas  fish rice ratio definitely point everything mean everything tastes amazing  salmon belly favorite sure  <EOR> I would say best all eat sushi spot to  Great selection <EOR> I wanted eat big meal before going long night shift decided find AYCE sushi place near Sunrise Hospital  Sakana wasn't big restaurant but spacious enough crowded mid afternoon when visited  interior decoration felt very sea themed all sakana does mean fish Japanese    I opted AYCE dinner dinner anything 3PM   price reasonable $26 before tax includes everything menu  Some more premium items only available order part AYCE dinner limited order  also found when received bill drinks included had known would ordered both hot tea lemonade     Service efficient generally friendly  When orders arrived roll instead hand roll remedied situation without giving hard time  also very observant quick clear finished plates since all servers work team I may primary waiter waitress but placed orders multiple people sushi brought different people well    The food pretty decent AYCE sushi definitely some unique items menu too  particular some nigiri cuts quite big portions fish rice ball underneath relatively small  food came relatively quickly well    There some Korean dishes menu Kpop playing TVs would safely assume restaurant Korean owned  Several servers even few sushi chefs Latino very multicultural staff haha   I struggling very end finish last few pieces two rolls charge leftovers  able finish end though didn't ask if offer half sized portions rolls   Decent variety dishes + reasonable price + above average quality = solid AYCE sushi  also order a la carte if desire though if hungry AYCE definitely much better value  <EOR> The best AYCE sushi had  Service wasn't best most attentive even AYCE but FOOD omg  Amazing  visiting some friends live Vegas mentioned craving AYCE sushi suggestion  $25 dinner pricing definitely say money's worth  came around 5PM able seated right away but busy right leaving bit 6  would probably say if want full dinner menu come earlier evening otherwise you'll end crammed into doorway waiting table  also fairly small ish space probably easier if don't come super huge group    Sakana many options AYCE menu didn't even know where start  also order items la carte off menu but if eat more 2 rolls typically you're just better off doing AYCE price wise  Typically AYCE think nigiri usually better rolls because there's less filler but even rolls Sakana good perfect amount rice    I ordered chicken karaage Hawaiian roll spider roll copious amounts nigiri but favorite far cajun tuna  don't even know what's fried onion some spices but omg could ordered nothing but those all night happy  seared lemon salmon nigiri also good  Everything good am kidding? finished everything off some green tea ice cream which really hit spot    My advice eating just ham  really AYCE sushi if don't hate yourself end meal? definitely back plan hating myself even more next time  <EOR> Absolutely amazing    service top notch all sushi very fresh very large selection hand rolls <EOR> The only reason place gets more 1 star because quality fish ingredients good    The service server HORRIBLE  family took birthday   did AYCE   cuts fish nothing pictures other Yelpers  fish rice ratio Nigiri nothing pictures   change standards AYCE customers? My server immediately upon seating rude cold go   He beard black combover  He even forgot order point  When ordered 2nd round tried hand 3 empty platters clear table myself he just kept walking away   swear he disappeared 15 minutes while entire table just sat looking around restaurant him   I really really wanted place  requested birthday because recent posts pictures reviews  returning nor recommend place others   find same quality fish elsewhere better service more welcoming atmosphere  <EOR> Excellent first time experience! 1st off very busy but waiters sushi chefs still very attentive fast friendly courteous  Big thumbs that  2nd food  OMG! good everything just top notch all nigiri fresh tasting overwhelming fish rice ratio 2 1 fish  amazing  rolls great the heck roll something wrong roll=could eat rest life all could say every bite Oh God many complex flavors textures little bites charismatic heaven  given 2 chefs specials wow creativity taste awesome  The appetizers all very good Baked Mussels some best ever Pang missed Pork Belly where all life   Super awesome can't wait back <EOR> Not cheap but quality beats price  Fast service  Delicious generous sushi dishes  All food made ahead  Ordered wanted then would them sushi dried hard  love place!

The fish extremely fresh cut thick  rolls big weren't cheap skimpy amount fish shellfish built each dish    The 'Burning Your Ass' roll 'Lemon Salmon' roll 'Johnny' roll crowd favorite   The only thing I'd change sauce couple rolls  Some little soaked which made them difficult eat over powered dish    The restaurant clean decor modern fun! walls covered cool art big chalk boards colorful chalk plank wood tree climbing walls into ceiling  Did mention Hello Kitty decor women's restroom?

Came group friends coworkers lunch  told no longer offer dinner option lunch even if willing pay it! Wow talk being harsh creating new rules inconvenient    We stayed because already sat down  Ordered bunch sushi share fish rice ratio significantly diminished over time  fish slices very thin now unlike used be  orders messed several times re order  Also couple rolls overloaded mayonnaise sweet sauce tasted horrible just swimming sauce  pork belly stiff overcooked!   Lunch $21 95 dinner $25 95  many other AYCE joints within mile radius better quality food treats customers better  very disappointing place gone totally downhill  NEVER come back again!!!! <EOR> This location located right behind office building  start work 6am  time Sakana opens 1130 well ready lunch    The food very good however service lack regard when mentioned atrocious   If call business time open 1130am would expect someone take call  case location  phone answered asked hold then proceed wait 20 mins person never pick phone back up     If advise them multiple orders still pack everything together few boxes possible making hard separate orders    We call order due only having 30 mins eat   Pre ordered food blessing literally takes 4 mins pick up   Going ordering takes 25 mins just them prepare which means no time eat    So sad now find another sushi spot delivered because can't spend any more lunch hours hoping answer phone  <EOR> Convinced dad come today didn't let down!   dad satisfied come all eat 26$ pretty good deal ! try uni oysters some salmon Belly even though only order taste  but all recommended item must try item time only really good! Although pretty Americanized The salmon egg good well!?not everyone likes though ate lot those  Usually other all eat restaurants give lot rice trying fill      but little rice  only tried two rolls finished but most order nigiri we ordered lot   FYI Usually rolls fill faster  In conclusion   finished everything ordered didn't those don't dish feeling  <EOR> Very good food service recommend coming getting lemon salmon lobster king  <EOR> The AYCE sushi menu diverse haven't seen many appetizer options visiting Vegas CA looked Yelp wasn't first popped but saw few reviews called hidden gem HIGHLY accurate  service good food fast prices point  Menu very long AYCE quality exceptional found 'our place' when come back LV which usually twice year    Tip noon 2pm super slow locals apparently don't lunch <EOR> This first time being far service great environment looks amazing! give another review try food sure!

Living south summerlin area usually don't travel far food usually stay within 10 mins area but little gem all worth every bite  If your looking place similar Oyshi but east side strip place it  Actually place worth drive sure   We came around 6 30 line 20 mins wait  thankfully did because 7pm huge line door  really big restaurant maybe  why wait but try early always best   My fav things     Ahi poke chips 4 orders good Super white tuna garlic sauce delish  Monkey brain really yummy different   Bulgogi nachos good but chips kinda stale me   And usual platter unagi salmon white tuna ahi tuna yellowtail sweet shrimp   Quality freshness good   Only thing didn't only sold soda want buy more but might good thing cause didn't need more anyway   I'll trip again soon  <EOR> We just arrived into vegas lunch Thursday  sister HIGHLY recommended place me  think server Silvia probably wasn't having best day  She serving alright  She wasn't amazing but she wasn't horrible  5 adults 2 babies  5 adults did AYCE    We through lunch time dessert! mom ordered 2 tempura ice cream 1 honey toast 1 fried banana 1 panna cotta  received panna cotta super quick  guess ready refrigerated  mom loved asked different server another which she right away  When rest desserts arrived only 1 each  Silvia's attention notify short 1 tempura ice cream  response verbatim only 1 dessert person already your 5   bit confused then she mentioned mom ordered another panna cotta  Which completely fine but curious she decided edit original order  ordered second panna cotta ordered 2 tempura ice creams  waited pay check wanted speak delivery  understand policies but didn't appreciate way she spoke me  She took while come back around walked bill cashier  then informed cashier situation  she should informed kindly 1 dessert per person she would happy give another panna cotta additional charge if wanted swap another dessert  corner eye saw standing left me  turned speak then she tells attitude your mother only ordered 1 tempura ice cream   All sudden excuse changed? She even did neck snap when she spoke me  turned cashier said did see ? He then apologized said he'll speak her  SHOCKED! cannot believe someone chooses server job revolves around customer service rude!!!  The restaurant clean food good! Just try Silvia your server  <EOR> one word DELICIOUS! satisfied drinks desserts  would've posted pictures but friends devoured it  Sh!t roll sh!t    recommend everything anything  <EOR> I recommended friend eat first time  new place corner flamingo maryland  Good thing place its AYCE  place japanese characteristic setting anime seating cushions  Lol pretty nice  more fish nigiri here  Some downers charge separately appetizers lunch time ending before 3pm when they're suppose AYCE  if u want full menu eat 3pm dinner special  some dishes only time orders only served dinner time     satisfying u limited  admit service fast friendly  Still good place experience   My favorite tomato roll <EOR> I tried several sushi places Vegas however favorite far  Try 300 Albacore Lisa Lisa Bam Bam Baked Green Mussels Black Sesame Blanc Manger!

Love 2 for 1 special tall cold beers  great long day sightseeing  <EOR> This most value ever gotten AYCE Sushi place  price super reasonable fish all really fresh  mainly nigiri some favorites definitely salmon unagi couple spicy ones  actually don't think would place if didn't AYCE because regular special rolls nigiri prices pretty expensive rolls all great anyway   If you're looking just eat nigiri definitely recommend place especially AYCE option  But if you're more specialty roll typa person maybe best skip  <EOR> Nothing special  sure why many great reviews  anniversary dinner regretted it  2 1 Asahi good  it  <EOR> I'm pretty sure found go to AYCE sushi joint Vegas many choose from  Sakana always consistent service quality deliciousness!  Dinner AYCE right under $26 1 2017  dinner menu few things offered included lunch price including sashmi rolls ama ebi uni  Otherwise rest menu fair game lunch dinner  Some staple items Sakana include garlic tuna salmon nigiri well Hawaiian Happy rolls    The service really quick efficient which love  Once order your sushi blink already front you! probably more sake turning over customers because wait line quite extensive but still nice quick service   My favorite thing place fish to rice ratio yes  real thing case didn't know   huge slice decent quality fish rice  best ratios trust    There few dessert menus if manage keep pocket stomach your sushi  Only order allowed per customer though also advertise 2 1 special beers wines house sake all day every day!  Overall favorite if best AYCE sushi place Vegas wouldn't hesitate coming again recommending friends visitors  <EOR> First off food solid 4 5 stars  No complaints food spicy salmon roll best ever had  Only concern regarding food size appetizer dessert  $3 75 3 tiny pieces agedashi tofu mind pretty steep  Same green tea panna cotta which delicious but really tiny size soy sauce dish    The service lets down  didn't feel attended all even though quite few empty tables  probably more AYCE tables but much waiting trying flag someone down literally stretch arm stop someone orders taken  food also taken wrong table top off charged something didn't order  Maybe came off time but lowest point stay Vegas  <EOR> Oh man found best sushi place town! don't waste time going anywhere else!

To continued     <EOR> For AYCE sushi restaurant Las Vegas Sakana serving some exceedingly delicious fresh fish  think crafted right mix quality variety limitations allow them serve above average quality fare reasonable price    We stopped lunch $21 99 AYCE menu  started off few orders nigiri including salmon maguro unagi hamachi  Besides unagi which thought over cooked overly fatty nigiri all very good  thought salmon hamachi both very fresh  stood most actually prepared nigiri small portion rice which sized appropriately cut fish   On second round explored kushiyaki menu chicken beef tongue lobster available settled lobster bacon chicken yakitori  lobster bacon served tiny piece lobster wrapped bacon  tasted okay but bite much small especially lobster which such small piece overcooked  chicken better but next time would stick more sushi   After order tried some less common fish including salmon belly ocean trout well cajun tuna paprika smoked salmon  First off ocean trout amazing far favorite meal  extremely tender flavorful just right balance fattiness chile put top added nice complexity nigiri  cajun tuna also very good although don't typically sushi much added flavors Sakana did way didn't detract taste fish   Overall solid meal Sakana  thought did admirable job delivering good quality fish very reasonable price  While limit only serving some rarer more expensive items ocean trout salmon belly lobster bacon kushiyaki did detract all enjoyment meal    I am definitely looking forward next AYCE meal Sakana maybe next time dinner order uni! <EOR> This place just keeps pissing off   Yet find myself going don't understand why do   It's wait staff waiter absolutely HATE   HATE MUCH   Every time see wish he wasn't working there   Why?  Because know going shit service if he ends being server   Load behold   Shit   I thrown piles shit     The ONLY reason why ended tipping even little because hard busboys working   pretty much waiter actual waiter   If you're curious which waiter hate He slick black hair weird ass mustache freakin' black shirt stripes goddamn Hawaiian looking flowers them I hope read review because effin' hate you  <EOR> This favorite AYCE sushi place town  husband would come least every other month if once month past 2 years  last experience horrible husband's 30th birthday    We sat table rice huge clump rice under table  waiter nice however he barely present because he seemed only waiting entire restaurant which several girls part staff stood register laughing talking whole time besides seating people when came in  short Hispanic man came put water glasses but stopped because Sprite  asked if could please 2 more cans soda he never brought them  AYCE simple because always put order notes cell phone easily just read copy but first time orders consistently messed up  Wrong food being brought table least half orders never came    Everything tasted good except sushi donut fried rolls received  fried roll tasted straight dirty oil sushi donut difficult eat because rice super soggy stuck plate    We live close Sakana all but never mind making drive  disappointed last experience think we'll just stick sushi spots side town  <EOR> Sakana two favorite joints when comes AYCE sushi the other Sushi Koma  If wasn't attitude some waiters weird furniture arrangement would given Sakana 5 stars instead 4   Now let's talk price way  price very similar most AYCE sushi joints $20 95 lunch $24 95 dinner    What food? Luv it!!!! rice fish ratio awesome best seen far  fish fresh portion plentiful  highly suggest try Salmon Kama bomb   Like mentioned earlier don't place service furniture layout  Some staff nice but most them barely cracked smile including owner lady gave order time eat fast kinda look  term furniture setup created bottleneck wait time extra long  big dinning area long table seat probably 12 14 people middle dinning room rarely see table being occupied  also lot 4 people tables which don't seat party two therefore ended whole bunch 2 party groups waiting seated while empty tables  hope description sense Overall still Sakana most likely lunch since less busy don't wait long table  <EOR> Finally reason 5 stars    We outstanding dinner last night  Fresh Fish!!!!

Best AYCE vegas far   I most definitely back might even new sushi spot  <EOR> Ok gonna slightly nice review   My boyfriend actually LOVED place came often since live nearby    Then day came back very busy    might mention place small many waiting seats   forces stand however long takes! ANNOYING but thought worth wait  2 1 beers dope  Well end getting seated ate  didn't really order much but  good night   4 days later craving sushi again end going just see closed huge health violation sign door   very let down freaked out  remained week   actually ended going back eat once saw sign gone   But day came back circling around asking if food good booklet   assuming cause possibly new fish?? idk   violation must something all questions    Anyways boyfriend ended getting very very sick  day!!! seriously haven't eaten sushi since then    Sakana definitely left bad taste mouth  New fish old fish no thank you!! vendor whoever supply horrible! <EOR> All eat sushi middle Vegas sounds scary but place something else! burnin your ass roll favorite along oysters <EOR> 10 10 would recommend!

Amazing! food comes lighting fast! fresh also  food worth price  don't overload sushi rice other ayce sushi places  sure leave good time  deserve it! <EOR> when stopped lunch more employees then customers service issue  I little surprised restaurant chooses only offer no rice shush until dinner menu  The biggest issue eh place heavily sauce EVERYTHING just rolls but mackerel tuna also dripping sauce good quality fish doesn't need flavor hidden sauce <EOR> Ok second time evening around 9pm place rocking busy  But food came quick service top notch 3 waiters going around taking orders asking if everything ok refilling drinks    It pretty dam best all eat sushi bar far terms service food  Definitely going again  <EOR> My boyfriend large group friends total 12 believe  Everyone all eat except me  allergic lot fish rather chance just few things other sushi  staff friendly all didn't really say much weren't very helpful  dropped piece paper AYCE people fill which kind hard 12 people paper  took drink orders appetizer orders all really saw waiter  He refilled water only once having ask multiple times  Once food everything alright  ordered teriyaki chicken which wasn't very flavorful dry  also order bacon wrapped asparagus which also dry very chewy couldn't even eat ordered vegetable fried rice which pretty good nothing really wrong but nothing spectacular either  Everyone sushi didn't really many complaints  thing very uncomfortable all staff watched hawk sure all sushi eaten because whatever wasn't eaten would charged for  waiter came back took dessert orders  fried banana which probably best thing ate all night but still wasn't great  When waiter brought bill he charged boyfriend 2 AYCE even tho didn't AYCE brought he fixed although wasn't very nice it  Everyone paid still plate sushi someone group didn't finish when another staff member came over asked friend told already paid he mad said should've charged but he mad fault weren't charged  Very unprofessional awkward  place alright but nothing world everyone said  boyfriend thought sushi pretty good but better  Overall wouldn't return  <EOR> This place AMAZING  drawn reviews but figured would just typical place  food fantastic  off strip drive take cab  suggest Hulk Burrito  If want try lot things during lunch 11 30 3 00 PM $20 95           ENJOY <EOR> I place overall   However huge disappointment sashimi hamachi hand roll came sesame oil   Beauty sushi sashimi flavor fish soy sauce wasabi fancy sauce   agree fusion rolls good fancy sauce but sashimi nigiri   order tuna sashimi without sauce      We enjoyed two asahi draft beer back it  <EOR> I am really happy replaced Kabuki!

For starters place AYCE $22 95   cheapest AYCE Vegas know of   most important part AYCE freshness rice fish ratio sushi   swear more 20 kernels rice per piece fish!  would equate almost eating sashimi small amount rice per piece   salmon white tuna unagi seared tuna all extremely fresh well prepared   Okay best part sear off tuna unagi blow torch    it still piping hot when consumed pure heaven! specials day salmon belly toro steak    again more bites perfection!  tried few rolls dinner time only part AYCE menu well   towering sashimi poke wonton crisps   I could just sat eaten all night cripsy wonton shell fresh fish touch acidity    too bad limited order per person =    also tried Screaming O Sashimi Roll both which well prepared well   only thing honestly did like    the plum ice cream slightly atrocious since reminded pink amoxicillin antibiotic medication child tried disguise some unknown flavor   But minor flaw given plenty other options dessert   sure look updated menus counter well    the laminated hand missing few items   If love AYCE sushi    you try place out   say comparable Goyemon Sushi Mon lower price less rice = <EOR> I don't understand why place many excellent reviews  impressed food here    Some nigiri tried fishier liked  Others doused sauce simply limited  could only order portion per person  salmon belly good sweet raw shrimp really delicious  did love shrimp came fried head  best! But rest nigiri unimpressive  lot rice both nigiri rolls fills really quick  ordered premium roll spicy tuna but covered much sweet sauce threw off balance flavors complete  did order another same roll but asked less sauce which actually helped   To honest only reason tried place because Goyemon 2 hour wait starving! I'd much rather wait two hours Goyemon instead  <EOR> This more 3 5 star experience   met fellow Yelper Eric lunch   little difficult find didn't Sakana sign front   drove around thinking wrong place call ask directions   Anyhow drove back walked in   greeted very friendly helpful waitress   given lot attention only customers there   Now am still Sushi newbie   only other place am sure compare all other experiences place   price rolls cheap decided just 2 rolls   couldn't tell rolls nor Michele Eric had   But price right   2 rolls $10   Filling good   So am still going widening sushi walls hope find other places  <EOR> The fish to rice ratio really amazing just everyone says  must try appetizers aren't much must try claim but nigiri spot on compared other sushi houses  food served fast definitely best time  <EOR> When visiting Vegas Hawaii always try AYCE sushi fix Sakana excellent!

Best place eaten far  Now home happy!!  <EOR> I first heard place through friend's Snapchat post haha  He swore favorite local sushi spots being sushi fanatic try instantly became fan  I'd drive through dinner trip though live ways away haha  brought some coworkers become favorite lunch spot work near strip 20 95   Sakana almost ruined other sushi spots exception Neko which suspect under same ownership management overall very similar rolls  sauce combinations spiciness left bit unsatisfied if ingredients missing other places  wide variety fish options offer extended menu rice less options during dinner $25 95  This little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition best  usually wait but never waited long whether sit coworkers lunch sit bar chefs quick too  roll appetizer variety plentiful offer exclusive dinner menu specials which totally worth dinner price  offer good selection rice less rolls options  aren't thinly sliced fish which love nigiri sauces always just right amount complement flavor  <EOR> Great service however food did taste fresh couple months ago    <EOR> AYCE lunch until 3pm $20 95 dinner $24 95    I impressed fish rice ratio definitely small side able order bunch nigiri eat heart's content    Yuzu yellowtail garlic albabore salmon tuna yellowtail among favorites  Baked mussels good  probably first AYCE places serve yummy tuna! Often times tuna hard fresh but Sakana    Only downsides are seat quite uncomfortable unless sit booths wall plum ice cream tastes berry don't paper write your orders the serve comes take your order   <EOR> When first came place great fact its usually packed but Im right now havw dinner hubby just 2 us 4 clean empty tables waitking iver 15 minutes won't seat because empry tables 4 people 9 10 PM! no else waiting please use common sense!!!!!! <EOR> They raised prices lunch $21 dinner $25  We came during dinner time around 5pm only other party  Asian lady provided fairly slow service but picked when new waiter   Their nigri good deal cut fish long thin strips rice which good maximize amount raw fish received but slightly awkward dip sauce eat    I recommend skipping pork belly but definitely getting tower poke  <EOR> Been place few times although always wait best sushi places city  staff always friendly  menu highlights which ones menu best  <EOR> The service food point here  waiters really quick refill your waters take any empty plates away  Regarding previous them forgetting orders haven't any problems since last few visits  gotten everything ordered  think Sakana such great value  Delicious food awesome price  Thanks Carlos Sung all other staff Sakana  <EOR>
