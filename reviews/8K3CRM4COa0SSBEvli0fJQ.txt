DON'T THINK Paymon Raouf WOULD ACCEPT STYLE MANAGEMENT STAFF?  MAYBE HE SOLD?  They didn't charge Gyro platter didn't eat lamb Kebab took off bill   But biggest issue lack respect customer   long time client might give new competition down road try     Just disappointment   Long time patron  <EOR> I absolutely love Paymons  accident tried place out  made reservations another restaurant Valentines day hour nobody taking order    left  came across Paymons since vegan options found new local spot  only FRESH loose leaf tea which amazing   their service gone above beyond  great specials offers mailing list  never wait even when full house   they able seat us!   I am fond hookah lounge why gave 4 instead 5 stars because sometimes only table left right hookah door smell sick  think business great idea day night option    I also love NO TV's other hookah lounge I noticed great vibes customers since very interactive each other instead watching TV    Amazing vegan options too!

The place itself decorated very nicely  loads paintings wall beautiful curtains lit extravagant chandeliers  hookah itself fair  first night came tried skittles flavor which wasn't bad just didn't hit very hard where lot smoke would come out  second night tried thief flavor which personal favorite two which again didn't hit hard but did taste very good  some point night felt needed new coals hookah waitress told don't change coals buy new refill coals which little ridiculous and  understatement   music play combination reguaetton cumbia top 40's  actually enjoyed music lot  Also Friday nights dance floor availible  didn't trying food but if come back might just that   Overall place more bark bite very well decorated lounge fair hookah  customer service isn't terrible but see them doing more fir customer  <EOR> Came around 1 30pm sunday  weren't lot people eating time seated right away  Restrooms decent  Price range appropriate amount servings  taste food always consistent  However quality service  subpar  only server taking orders although busboys  took awhile orders taken delivered  Poor guy looked overwhelmed when all other guests arrived   YELP 100 CHALLENGE #5 <EOR> Paymon's good kids said fave restaurants!  kebobs great chicken pita fantastic salads too!  However 2 items menu mind blowing gyro fries!  fries league own french fry world almost don't order them because know eat way many but always them anyway!!! <EOR> I'm giving Paymon's 2 stars ambiance great prices nice waitress delicious Cosmo had  would given 1 star if weren't factors   We waited entrance good 5 minutes but no sign waitress hostess  Awkward  Once seated pretty pumped give place go  decor great obvious people having great time hookah lounge    The food probably worst area don't say lightly  ordered appetizer sampler which lackluster  I'd rather buy hummus store  fries pretty gross couldn't place spices used but definitely taste  falafel alright but better    My friend ordered kabob sampler  lamb OK nothing excited about  didn't care chicken much either  Something didn't sit right me    The deal breaker ground beef kabobs  only description them wouldn't appropriate let's just call them straight nasty  warm cooked outside but insides cold total mush  never sent back food life but only imagine sickness would result if didn't  When came back practically burnt outside as kabobs should guess? insides slightly more solid  kabobs plenty other places town travels but never experienced this  SUCH disappointment    really gross  rice ok but tasted really greasy stewed tomato thing side tasted slightly soap  waitress offered send back 2nd time but point over thought eating more turned guts  didn't ask removed bill but did anyway which nice   I'd back try hookah lounge drinks but avoiding food  hope just fluke but willing dump money down drain again  <EOR> If made meat more moist added side gyro then would reconsider  Gyro soda $14  much poor quality  <EOR> Had dinner Monday night  Started off appetizer sampler really good  fries little stale but soon mentioned came fresh batch  Let tell far best fries Nevada  dinner  Lamb Chicken Beef Kabobs  Huge portions ended boxing most up  def come back when come through neighborhood again  <EOR> Had lunch very good friend Donna  all lentil soup which absolutely delicious  waitress Heather  She friendly personable delight with  2 1 2 hours kill she made time fly  Heather recommended Kale salad added salmon  great salad fish cooked perfection  wife turkey pita pleasantly surprised mouthfuls flavor  friend special Mediterranean salad which she orders often disappointed   We coming back dinner!

Annoying!  BUT   this doesn't happen Paymon's!  Portions large enough don't recall having room dessert yet Paymon's   All all Paymon's handy restaurant close by   stay open 11 pm every night no rushing down 8 pm try it   Since family no interest Hookah Lounge don't even see area left entrance   atmosphere inside slightly cheesy cross between Istanbul Taj Mahal but overbearing kind grows you   Those tend always cold should bring sweater   unless you're going eating extra spiced version Chicken Curry! <EOR> Seriously good food good hookah decent music great service  more ask for?

The waitress nice everything but should really work having someone door sit people cause standing 20 minutes complete waste time  <EOR> Traditional Greek Mediterranean restaurant offers decent selection traditional veggie items  food very good very dependable service generally very friendly  <EOR> Love happy hour  But just little confused rules   Guys can't wear tank tops hats  But waitresses wear tank tops bra straps hanging out? Then waitress asked boyfriend remove hat  fine okay  But girl sitting across beanie on  sure sense makes  <EOR>
