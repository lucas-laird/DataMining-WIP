This take Chicago style pizza  close neighborhood Chicago pizza found Vegas  Service friendly consistently reminds Chitown  proud pizza snob highly recommend Amore! <EOR> Being Chicago pizza fan Amore first pizzeria checked Chicago pizza   For true Chicago Pizza Giodrano's Lou Malnati's Gino's East  difficult find true Chicago pizza outside Chicago  Amore does good job pizza though especially if can't travel all way Chicago!  The stuffed pizza huge heavy  outer crust 2 5 inches thick or should say tall nice crispy bottom crust relatively thin chewy but manages hold all ingredients  There's plenty cheese all other toppings tasted fresh  sausage particularly good having nice sweet taste fennel  sauce nice chunky texture balances sweetness tanginess pretty well  pizza greasy least if sausage due huge size amount toppings but also very satisfying believe if hungry think easily eat normal 14 pizza you'll probably only able eat half 14 Amore pie   Note if order stuffed pizza eat take pie takes 45 mins cook   The indoors sitting area decorated all sorts pictures memorabilia Chicago overall pretty clean good service   If want Chicago pizza Las Vegas Amore probably only real choice along Rosati's maybe I'd say Pietown but closed now   pizza big plenty toppings very satisfying  next best thing if can't travel all way Chicago  <EOR> Amore Taste Chicago far cry authentic Chicago pizza however hit spot absence better choice   restaurant doesnt much atmosphere i'd recommend getting your pie especially if dont want wait 45 mins takes bake    large menu pasta choices apps some salads   House salad decent creamy garlic dressing super good   pizza crust mediocre bit crispy   sauce slightly sweet flavorful enough   spinach pizza frozen kind extremely watery which threw off entire thing   would recommend getting cheese pizza when craving deep dish since arent many options area   isnt bad just best deep dish life  <EOR> So must say place best pizza town if  enough then try calamari just introduced menu!

Needless say everything delicious  really can't wrong  However some people table preferred thin crust deep dish  Things civil    until pepperoni thrown   As loved them both  Deep dish thin crust  don't care  Amore puts whole lotta love into all dishes                The family atmosphere believe experience even more wonderful  place packed families wearing Chicago sports team apparel   mention staff which feel going years!  Amore Taste Chicago far  favorite places dig suggest  same!   My Tips 1 When ordering deep dish know take 45 min               make  Trust its worth waits   2 walk into Amore's wearing other sports apparel besides Chicago teams  just polite     DA BEARS <EOR> Food very good im Chicago close gonna hometown fast food   Combination Italian Beef   love it!!! <EOR> Time some tough love   Okay now twice  Unless place blows away first time take average two experiences feeling famished future could expect  Usually experiences pretty similar but place all  friend coming years warned inconsistency  really wanted wrong but alas he not   LAST MONDAY We ordered fried ravioli appetizer medium deep dish pizza order two Vienna hot dogs fries    Really enjoyed fresh bruschetta brought complimentary while looked over menu first time  added nicely experience delicious   Pizza favorite  Such great taste buttery crust slightly sweet sauce course melty mess mozzarella  ravioli pretty standard gooey cheese inside warm marinara side  hot dogs surprisingly delicious  good snap crisp fresh veggies perfectly steamed bun crunchy fries along side  Couldn't really ask anything more    The service last week OKAY  young girls front nice but kind unhelpful  seemed preoccupied absolutely everything except customers  Also pretty sure hair needs pulled back falling forward if you're serving food according health district  Just kind seems unprofessional unappetizing  four five girls only hair up    THIS MONDAY Came around same time last week around 7pm  time ordered fried mozzarella start followed two orders double Chicago dogs order Italian Beef Sandwich   Let start off saying EVERYTHING completely inconsistent quality experienced last week  time food all tasted very bad chef temporarily lost use taste buds didn't even try food being sent out   As sad wouldn't eat beef sandwich again if paid me  honestly inedible disgusting  meat tasted old flavorless au jus barely lukewarm overspiced read overcompensated spices bread borderline stale   And don't even started hot dogs aka biggest disappointment life    Where did warm soft steamed bun last week go? Gone replaced bun probably same batch LAST WEEK  bun dry stale unappetizing  hot dog little much snap week which made seem cooked kept warm very long time wasn't fresh  taste old hot dog fallen through grill forgotten about  Except ALL FOUR hotdogs tasted that  Disgusting  Left them plate barely eaten   Even bruschetta beginning meal weird  None liked it  all  seemed mushy old wayyyyy salty   The ONLY GOOD THING second experience fantastic service  Bianca server  She extremely attentive very helpful answering questions accommodating requests  When brought concerns food she apologized offered complimentary dessert shortcomings  Two declined but fiancé opted chocolate chip cheesecake fill void subpar hot dogs she ordered  nice touch  really felt heard Bianca assured owner takes feedback heart sure next experience meet high expectations formed amazing first visit    First experience Four Stars  Five food minus service   Second experience Three stars  Literally zero food but plus three Bianca's professionalism   3 5 stars  Let's call 3 flat inconsistency   I am hesitant come back but probably tie breaker update when happens  <EOR> After reading Yelp reviews try hubby returned Chicago ranting amazing pizza experience!  The staff awesome really cater clients sincere service provide doesn't happen all time Vegas!  ordered deep dish 30 minute wait totally didn't mind since just two knew would fresh!    We tried fried mozzarella wow packed flavor could only piece but hubby cleaned plate!  Next bruschetta PERFECTO honestly best favored oil balsamic ever had!!  Last but least Stuffed Pizza little limp but flavors full intense really did matter!  Pricey pizza sure but when looking real pizza $5 cardboard    definitely Amore! <EOR> Pizza Pizza more Pizza! Course some nice pasta dishes along hear great dog! Just don't ask ketchup    Since place Chicago flare tried sausage pepper combo pie  Keep mind good things take time wait 35 45 mins  While wait long use time check big pizza oven back oven big small room!  As mentioned ordered special pie everything nicely done! crust doughy but rather almost crisp nice buttery flavor  sauce sweet but just enough acid it  cheese standard but set everything apart homemade sausages topped pie! Right amount spices fat seasonings! Very nice!   Next time going try some pasta dishes have  Looked pretty good coming kitchen!   Sante <EOR> GROSS!!! ordered rib dinner 06 09 2015   While delivery service smile timely all came crashing down before even took first bite  But  did bite  First ribs did looking appetizing Alsoo fries looked freezer burned baked beans definitely can  But gem corn bread    wonderfully delicious  <EOR> Best deep dish pizza Southwest  first stop LV when arriving San Diego  <EOR> Friendly comfortable food great  Would given 5 stars if wine beer but said working that  <EOR> By far best Chicago deep dish pizza ever Vegas!!  always take never dine in   Born raised Chicago lived 25 years share Chicago style pizza     good drive 17 miles each way just buy one! <EOR> I VERY close giving 4 but couldn't it    My friend just moved town December Chicago he dying try place since he moved  finally made date went!
