Ah cheap drive thru alright  food other hand kind crappy  find extremely salty probably masking fact food no flavor without it    I sampler combo comes twice baked lasagna spaghetti w meat sauce alfredo  lasagna probably favorite three alfredo being least favorite  alfredo lacks any flavor! Its just eating noodles some thick sauce slathered over no apparent taste  didn't detect any hint cheese anything  combo $7 99 comes drink breadsticks  used come salad pizza but now add $1 49 price  stupid enough add caesar salad combo  waste buck fifty!! just iceberg lettuce some cherry tomatoes shredded carrots The kind pre bagged stores didn't even romaine! Never again  If anything should gotten pizza own damn salad home!   My boyfriend chicken penne basil  tried it  kind sucked  didn't taste any basil  No flavor all   Sometimes if going through drive thru might wait 15 mins! last time food  fast but time before swear waiting least 20 mins!   Probably still return if really craving some crappy italian food cheap am lazy  But might well own food home! <EOR> I think food nice inexpensive fast food   baked lasagna pretty killer good   But really place awesome service   Seriously people work place totally kind   think management because super nice think employees treat customers really nicely   If sick rude customer service refreshing change! <EOR> CLOSED  This place pretty decent cheap Italian meal though hard eat any day but Sunday since Montesano's Italian Deli within same block   It missed! <EOR> I remember work joke Fazoli's being McDonald's Italian food xD  I really going place when sudden craving Italian food want fast  Hint fast  Which basically Fazoli's is fast food Italian restaurant eat through drive thru   I always order Fettucine alfredo because favorite ANYWHERE go  Haha because accompanied thick paste runny even though sometimes salty side  boyfriend always gets chicken parmigiana bite chicken  dry which plus but cheesy me! Getting entree only $6 less comes breadsticks  way salty though   There lot seating arrangements but most time place packed all  food inexpensive consider cannot authentic Italian food come high expectations  previously stated only when sudden craving fast Italian food  <EOR> Took while food  Picked baked spaghetti salads   Good value    Salad dressing bit off enough set aside toss   Otherwise 4 star     I'm rating fast food expectations <EOR> Usually decent meals price but time mediocre   Both pastas runny flavorless  <EOR> Let start saying going eat different Italian restaurant   However closed Memorial Day   second best option considering location fact hungry!    Prices Average considering fast food Italian  Service Average also considering fast food Italian  Food Salty!!!!!!!  But tasted good because really hungry   Will back?  hope not   because food horrible typical reasons would choose back restaurant   reasoning food incredibly salty!  over processed fast food Italian theme   home dinner literally couldn't drink enough water!  meal made thirsty! <EOR> I love place  introduced 5 years ago  always vacation once month  place eat at  ate yesteday ordered primo sampler yummy humongous  fiancee shared food  love breadsticks eat 10 them  can't complain price either  <EOR> I literally everything menu multiple times  great place mix things up  Breadsticks  fantastic   I would love just them  But cheap fast italian  qualifying four star four star those expectations set out  Service pretty good  mean usually high school kids stuff but decent job  <EOR> Wow serious? Just idea Italian fast food should warning alone   Very mediocre borderline nasty food  pizza rubber pasta cheap service SLOW  Anyone could  boiled own penne time service came through   rate emergency need some ravioli gotta back work type place   I'd never just eat pleasure  <EOR> It's fast  It's inexpensive  But tasty  However give them extra star breadsticks  The food isn't horribly but doesn't satisfy any Italian cravings might have  I tried Fettucine Alfredo very bland  Then Chicken Parmesan  put very dry breaded chicken top cheese which melted onto spaghetti underneath  Definitely strange  <EOR> Sooo know most wouldn't call *diet* food but surprisingly kids meal choices awesome dinners when few points left WW  Sometimes rush don't want cook pasta dinner yes easy know   kids ziti fresh low calorie delicious! also huge fan surprisingly good pizza  fiance both shocked good drive through  breadsticks also awesome but very diet friendly! some awesome salad options chicken fruit   etc etc wide varied menu  fiance adores sampler platters    Yes junk food    but lower fat burgers mexican satisfies craving italian  Oh crazy cheap  good sized pasta dinners right now $2 49  Service always friendly quick  <EOR> First let say Italian eateries appear dime dozen  Italian become watered down into bland mix spaghetti lasagna pizzas some bland salads iceberg lettuce   tired so called Italian restaurants eons ago   But someone suggested Fazoli's tried it  YUCK!  fits right bland pseudo Italian stuff talking about  Does mean food bad? necessarily but see review basis judging unsatisfying  just kinda nondescript nonspecial blah me    But type blandness could good choice group friends family kids want casual dinner familiar foods  <EOR>
