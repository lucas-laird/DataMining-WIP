later dish lettuce cups comes rest duck meat cooked water chest nuts mushrooms  problem charge TWO dishes when only wanted one  Future Reference ASK meat left skin! other shady part dinner large groups charge 17% automatic gratuity without telling you  <EOR> Being Hong Kong born restaurant sparked interested when first mentioned me  uncle took group restaurant lunch recommending specials e i  flaunder  1 lunch order $6 25 while exact same order dinner would $24 addition any entrees noodles fried rice every table's given free container plain white rice  exactly classy restaurant you'd take your friends visitors but cheap lunch fast service restaurant represented HK's traditional restaurants pretty well  <EOR> A place finally give 5 star review   The 2 bad things night took while refill teapot fried tofu pepper need additional sauce  really worst thing say all night place   Came back Friday night saw around 5 Asian families 2 families elders  Good sign since many Asian elders really hard impress mine least     Service just stellar  waiter very attentative shows he's passionate job  He recommended alternative fish give freshness instead frozen fish  waiter also kid own he along well coworker's twin babies  Lastly he showed pull last remaining meat tail lobster without destroying it  super tender just orgasmic    Lobster sea bass beef mushroom oyster sauce steamed cod all great  Only issue fried tofu needing sauce since just eating french fries  recommend sweet sour sauce    This place recommend going authentic Chinese Food  If want lobster without being ripped off place go  <EOR> As stated previous reviews enjoy Chinese food but die husband  reading rave yelps decided take husband main thing   the salt pepper cod  Ok   I enamored salt pepper pork  My husband extremely picky    I believe favorite meal entire Vegas trip  He joined sis in law shared cod pork some fried rice  sis in law Chinese Hawaiian while she liked loved fried items  she really enjoyed fried rice  think all thoroughly enjoyed whole meal   for both taste value lunch menu   and definite must next Vegas trip   Thanks much turning place!!! <EOR> We looking late night dinner remembered restaurant   settled sharing shrimp black bean sauce chicken chow fun which good but nothing exceptional  <EOR> Service very good   little confused menu but waiter explained me   quite pleased food   Much better expected location in strip center   <EOR> Great food services  Very busy yet very organized  Speedy services  Fresh oven roast duck yummy! <EOR> OMG WTF! long should take food made brought out?

For lunch entree Duck roommate Mongolian Beef   duck very large portion served thin yet flavorful sauce boiled peanuts   Very good dish especially only 5 95!  Mongolian Beef surprisingly very good too   don't usually americanized chinese dishes but just right amount spice even onions dish very good    I would highly suggest HK Star anyone looking great chinese restaurant Chinatown  <EOR> This become top Hong Kong style restaurant Las Vegas   once week parents   service very fast just serve Hong Kong   flavor qualify food better most Chinese restaurants Las Vegas   Price reasonable   lunch specials discounted dinner menu   I agree Tony T  review   If see mostly Asian people Asian restaurant then  good thing   Lastly compliments waitress waiters   going  HK Star such pleasant experience   back next Sunday! <EOR> One Las Vegas' best Chinese kitchen's  Hong Kong Taiwan music videos only add 'flavor'   Try frogs legs! <EOR> Yessiree! place pretty darn good!

<EOR> Went solo lunch today HK Star  impromptu decision lunch since originally planning dim sum some classmates afterclass  But being first week school things hectic things rarely according plan   Anyway figure since area taking care errands drive few more blocks try another new item HK Star lunch special menu  typically ordered more expensive items decided want try something $4 95 portion menu   Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting never ordered would find exactly HK Style Chow Fun   When waiter came told wanted Hong Kong Style Chow Fun #8 $49 5 lunch special menu okay didn't say #8 part it    He said theone gravy  never ordered said sure  He also wanted confirm wanted Chow Fun because menu Chow Mein option also available said yes   He looked little confused repeated order again Mandarin Hong Kong Style Chow Fun off he punch order POS   Minutes later generous plate chow fun gravy vegetables shrimp chicken fish arrived   hungy past 2 hours took quick picture dug in   food delicious thinking great deal $4 95  ate entire plate chow fun without being interrupted wait staff   wasn't until very end when ate everything waiter took table brought over check   When saw bill realized fantastic deal mistake because made House Pan Nood sub Chow Fun which interpretted House Pan Friend Noodles made Chow Fun asking $6 51 lunch  annoyed enough write comment bill asked Hong Kong Style Chow Fun left $7 lunch  figured besides taking order wrong delivering food provided no additional service such asking if everything okay if needed more tea water earned   So downgrading rating 4 stars solely poor listening skill knowing menu non existent service   feel called order ahead regular waiter took order would given ordered  experience today HKS due being stuck crappy waiter some other Yelper complained about     Hopefully next time ordering process better if sense any confusion waiter repeating back order just point menu sure all same wavelength  <EOR> While attending CES read reviews restaurant Yelp decided check out  first visit hooked ended eating 4 times five days  food cooked perfection each time  only critiques are 1 food bit much salt  If don't much salt ask your waiter hold off salt   2 waiters very attentive focused socializing among themselves  My favourite dishes included 1 Mongolian Beef a bit many onions liking  Ask your waiter hold off onions  2 Garlic Chicken dry salty taste  3 Filet minion beef string beans I substituted string beans bock choy 4 Fresh seafood fish tanks can become very expensive   <EOR>
