Look your bill carefully compare prices ones menu   I into restaurant whim lunch because area  gave menu fairly expensive items asked lunch specials told lunch menu!  Not wanting take 2nd mortgage just ordered some albondigas soup my favorite    menu said $5 95 bowl which actually few reasonably priced items menu  took some time brought even though only few customers place  honest gave 2 stars instead 1 because soup  fresh delicious  probably best had  when bill problem began  checked bill pay noticed price soup bill $6 95 dollar more menu stated  asked see menu again just sure  called hostess over pointed mistake  took almost 15 minutes come back new bill  bill computer generated which means price system wrong   Maybe anomaly item  can't sure  Again food great! <EOR> Had amazing dinner last night   Food drinks amazing service cannot beat! <EOR> We eaten Viva Mercado's several years ago previous location   Usually when return previously visited spots inevitably feel disappointed because expectations high and or memories experience inflated years!  am happy report visit definitely exceeded expectations   Everything exceptional homemade chips salsa frozen mango margaritas chorizo con queso carne asada quesadillas steak fajitas incredible fried ice cream   All exceptional   Even all restaurant options Vegas offer probably return trip! <EOR> Food atmosphere wonderful! would recommend place all!
