Explosively   Really  swear   My bud 2 1 coupon asked join talk biz being cheap fat hungry said sure'  knew where place hasn't bought street drugs some point lives? Don't judge me! made only enter 1981 Mexico  decor barely that  Some frescoes someone's idea Mexico could used Silkwood shower tables looked well nothing   The first bad sign? Stale tasteless chips some sort salsa juice  WTF? mean set bad even friend eat anything  only finished 1 4 them   The menu very typical White suburbia version Mexican Combinacciones Platos   actually mood that  know real Mexican food but love anyway    And then made mistake would cause waitress Surlyrella decide she going Freunden    Not  know what? cheese taco well Enchiladas gamely said looming rock hate  CHEESE TACO?' she hissed    We stared each other two mean Wildebeest all Wild Kingdom each other  Being Gay back down  TACO CHEESE looked gaze right back now beady steely eyes  Hmph she shot back way said screw your mother letting down birth canal! So   The food came   As did next twenty minutes choking down some blandest globs cheese rice beans endured since Swanson decided take Mexican TV tray market    It came but didn't fast enough me   Fast forward back work breaking cardinal rule No number 2 office!'   Explosively   Oh yeah  cheese taco? hard shell some cheese shoved nasty bag shredded lettuce clearance Food Less  Despicable   I hate place strongly suggest eat well anywhere other here  <EOR> Im very picky when comes Mexican food  Came yesterday first time because co workers suggested it  Never heard ever life  Walked Mexican feel okay maybe those hidden gems   Sat down took them while come ask drinks deliver some chips salsa  chips salsa 'ehhh' bring 2 types 1 mild 1 spicy  mild salsa fresh tastes exactly salsa buy store glass bottle  spicy salsa basically tomato sauce some spices wasn't even spicy  Good thing chips fresh!   I ordered steak fajita lunch meal which came sour cream guacamole beans corn tortillas  co worker chimichanga lunch meal other co worker taco bowl    My fajitas good guess since lunch menu didn't really come lot meat veggies  Meat tender flavorful beans delish   I looking around guess they've some time because extremely dusty  light above table seperators between very dusty kind turned off little  understand you've long time but doesn't hurt annual cleaning once while   Overall food 'OK' but don't think coming back  Since really dusty food just 'Ok'  Luckily wasn't paid lunch  <EOR> I'm really surprised see much hate main mexican place  Eating over decade long tradition family! location without doubt terrible sketchy but since both West Charleston Trop locations closed gotta gotta some delicious eats   sopapillas fantastic baja sauce absolute favorite! <EOR> It saddens only give Macayos 2 stars but other chunky salsa customer service just no point expecting decent Mexican food here   My last 2 experiences severely disappointed me   food comes pretty fast fast question when cooked   On most recent visit ordered enchilada sampler  comes green spicy chicken enchilada ranchero enchilada plain cheese classic one   I took bite each pretty much ready leave   There just no authenticity food all  use come kid but wouldn't even bring own kid days  wasn't worst but think all all place just needs makeover  days may numbered east side if don't figure soon  <EOR> Omg     eeew wish would seen dead mice review before ate today lunch !!!!   server great     food bland gave suppose shrimp tacos should called cabbage wrap 6 shrimps cut little pieces each tortilla paid $11 cabbage basically    Terrible !!!! Don't come waste money atmosphere very old restrooms trash all over   Only star service  Oh enchiladas gave friend CHORRO    they look good outside but    <EOR> Born raised Las Vegas     coming since 4     Albondigas soup Baja sauce!!!! save cheat days fat days macayos      <EOR> Great Mexican food old fashioned restaurant  Good lunch specials bottomless chips when sit down  never anything didn't enjoy here  <EOR> HORRIBLE?  This place super dam American really chicken tenders???? Wtf   They NO SEAFOOD   My meat tasteless uhh   The pizza Baja pizza amazing but other then place sucks   My grandma loves place but think terrible  Our service sucked he acted he hated life smh!!  I love Mexican food but place way below average <EOR> The best part restaurant Manager Carmen   coming location over 40+ years   definitely need remodel  <EOR> A Vegas tradition  remember going other locations Trop Maryland closed! sad! Don't let area inside restaurant drive away  seedy part town no doubt inside restaurant cheesy all but food good generally spending only $25 2 people   Chips served warm guacamole dip if want splurge at $8 79 pricey but served mini fried tortilla shell eaten if you're hungry enough finish all guac  salsa nothing write home but works  I think most popular thing TCT which essentially just quesadilla  add meat veggies beans little more filling but massive served huge pizza pan over lit candle keep warm  gotta try least once  Most people app but if you're hungry enough try your entree   My favorite thing menu Pollo con Espinaca which grilled chicken spicy cream cheese jack cheese mixture spinach  creamy spicy warm incredibly delicious  tried replicate home but just can't quite right  served flour tortillas typical sides beans rice  sure try if you're looking something little more adventurous chimichanga which way pretty amazing    The restaurant itself older greatest shape  lots seating both booths tables if they're busy enough even open back area which kind cool spot eat  The people friendly swear few ladies since kid  Service hit miss wait little long drink refills chip refill  server didn't come back check until actually done meal but wasn't big deal cause really didn't need anything  While service may worthy 5 star restaurant least friendly   If you've lived Vegas any substantial amount time you've definitely heard Macayo's  If you're looking good spot generally inexpensive good Mexican food give try  won't disappointed  <EOR> The food very delicious but unpleasantly put them 2 stars because Monday dinner wife friends everything started well since entered girl took sit she behaved very friendly but guy brings salsa chips before ordering came started throw things asked but really angry? He turns very red face sweating he answers no! Why ? said just asking time behaved patient felt uncomfortable incident very bad experience  <EOR> The food pretty good  servers pleasant but cashier BETTY awful  I dont know if its old age if she having bad day    attitude very bad when taking payment asked change items receipts   spoke manager hopefully helps customer service restaurant back nice place used be  <EOR> Not best but quick work lunch mex bowl awesome  black bean no meat side jalapenos! Yummy <EOR> When craving Mexican hits hits hard nothing else satisfy   stopping until some proper Mexican food!  Some co workers suggested Macayo pleased find location five minutes work    convenient!! friend famished course ordered close everything menu!  greeted warm chips salsa which amazing!  started appetizer sampler dip sampler   Both HUGE portions immediately regretted much ordered! appetizer sampler great!  offered pretty much two everything which perfect split   dips all amazing    After sufficiently stuffing faces rest ordered showed table   Now server definitely thought crazy much ordered but hadn't forewarned serving sizes! Consider yourselves warned!  They're HUGE! few things split since new Macayo wanted try much could   TCT juevos con chorizo   feel also something else escaping mind right now!  TCT giant open family style quesadilla   great way share friend put exactly wanted own quesadilla   Brilliant opinion!  example friend loves beans but don't    serving quesadilla way lets she loves without ruining quesadilla vice versa     Now spending few months Brazil am quite chorizo enthusiast   reason kind nervous when try chorizo restaurant because let's honest compare local Brazilian chorizo?  Macayo did disappoint! chorizo delicious ate every last bite!   Now only tasted very very briefly but told Margaritas amazing   looking menu definitely offer variety flavors types friend they're huge!  unfortunately don't drink tequila anymore let's just blame bad night college one couldn't enjoy refreshing drinks but should definitely next time stop Macayo! <EOR> Great food service! Very attentive hardly no wait all  burrito bowl shredded beef margarita  bf lunch special taco enchilada tostada  both happy full! <EOR> If could give zero stars would  horrible service horrible food  They served cold chhimichanga  wouldn't even right never again return don't mistake did stay clear <EOR> God love Macayo Vegas    since remember and  mighty long time   neighborhood around gone almost completely Mexican but Macayo not! still same old quasi mexican style bastion cuisine may entirely autentico but suits cravings gringos just fine    endless bowls hot fresh chips two kinds salsa the chunky newer seems more popular but smooth more garlicky still tastes 60's happy course crispy cheesy just little greasy TCT draws bring back again  Never did care much regular tacos fast food kind dog foody tasting but deep fried shredded beef ones tasty wonderful cheesy sour creamy enchiladas suizas    Now bringing third generation color exact same sombrero boy kid's menu    If want authentic trot across street Tacos El Gordo  If want cool dark place escape noon sun indulge big plate god knows drenched melted cheddar cheese shredded lettuce it! Viva Macayo! <EOR> If work downtown need escape office lunch hour good option     I am generally within hour's time   service predictable usually good though occasional hiccups     The food pretty standard your Americanized Mexican food   If you're looking authentic Mexican food someone's abuela's kitchen it     The parking sometimes problematic shared other business strip shops feels spaces sometimes narrow accommodate most SUVs which only really issue if drive said SUV do   <EOR> Dead Mouse Anyone??   Imagine taking your daughter 16th birthday dinner 24 people! Bill comes $500 ish find your kids playing dead mouse room your eating! Yep!  happened tonight! Disgusting! When tried talking supervisor she proceeded say $20 off bill?? $20 crazy? Free necessary but $20?? Then when leave follow take pictures cars report us? Well reporting yelp channel 5 13 8 oh health department! Thanks memorable 16th kid!  Ps     Ceaser amazing waiter! He good part experience guy walked us! <EOR> Worst service standards WOW don't come refills anything ordered appetizers didn't come til meal came Never again  Beware place <EOR> As transplant southeastern Arizona almost 30 years ago happy find good sonoran cuisine upon arrival here  frequenting Macayos all years despite some forays into other called Mexican restaurants Macayos constant purveyor excellent food friendly atmosphere  <EOR> The service terrible  constantly empty cup ask several times refills overcharged meal  Sad sad sad  food decent but expected  Alas is  <EOR> I first visited establishment back 2008 while vacation Las Vegas  family area know good local places eat outside strip    My first visit very good coming Texas where top line Tex Mex well authentically cooked Mexican dishes    My favvvvorite item menu Spicy Chilorio     words want use describe feeling when wrap creamy cheesy mixture into fresh flour tortilla suitable your general audience  When tell dream dish am telling lie! perfectly spicy very creamy but overpowering some similar dishes be    On last visit late November entire table 5 ordered Spicy Chilorio everyone agreed amazing flavor is!  The service always great  wish could remember name server assistant he white very tall very attentive  He NEVER let glasses even close halfway empty  chips salsa constant he definitely better waitress just fine no complaints!     The only draw back location! seemed sort shady somewhere wanted late night    Overall love place! <EOR> I am 'Vegas born raised eating since 60's  parents ate before me  Mother law eaten lunch every Saturday long remember  She also margarita special mug  wife join once twice month  chips choice salsa always ready ever order  food Mexican food would find spicy hot places actually taste  food  never disappointed  Occasionally run into local celebrity  Cops eat lunch all time  <EOR> I guess minority recommendation brother's friend try while Vegas  good  meat street tacos dry both pork chicken  Honestly better chicken tortilla soup  watered down tomato soup nasty chicken chunks it  day friend burrito biggest ever seen but if never back  Vegas lot great Mexican food pad one  <EOR> Do baja pizza its absolutely disgusting  Food general extremely heavy pretty low quality  same price just few streets downtown something actually delicious made better ingredients oil laden cheese product  <EOR> I LOVE location particular   play oldies music staff friendly   best items menu spinach queso baja pizza   OMG!  good   Portions huge prices average   once week  <EOR> I bday E Charleston location on 6 9 reading negative reviews little apprehensive haven't location many many years  must say area sitting looked very clean food just good remember growing service fast without making feel rushed   waitress great sense humor personable friendly seemed happy which probabley wasn't easy because table little needy  would definitely return  <EOR> A sit down Mexican place front El Gordo's  husband told he used come child brought Mom she said she doesn't think ever changed interior  looks exactly same  First impression whole restaurant small smells old but food good  Big servings give free nacho chips salsa we probably 4 bowls while waiting food arrive   servers super friendly made sure drinks refilled  Waiting time food probably around 20 minutes  <EOR> Came Saturday lunch immediately seated i haven't Macayos few years didn't know expect  Within minutes hot fresh chips came table homemade salsa  wait staff member friendly attentive  food very well prepared  large portions food quality low prices definitely come back  <EOR> Americanized Mexican Food   Served friendly but overworked wait staff location that  well seen better days   Pricing   slightly high side when look portion sizes overall quality especially compared against find many other places across valley   I want Macayo but just don't any real desire back  YMMV  <EOR> I don't know happened Macayo's  used best Mexican restaurant en Vegas now more   favorite chips salsa quality gone tasted canned salsa   portions smaller prices up  If keep lowering quality food keep closing more locations  <EOR> This place Mexican food people Ohio  chicken boiled seasoned  Enough said  <EOR> Difficult find first time their large lighted sign mostly need repair  Parking difficult crowded small strip center  service excellent even though understaffed  lot choices clean menu  Ordered tamales which equal something could buy frozen section walmart  Dessert average flan  Two people two drinks two desserts total tip $52 00  Over priced under quality  <EOR> 24 years+ Las Vegas Macayo still spot 'American style' Mexican food  tried nearly every sit down Mexican restaurant town Macayo never disappoints   always hits spot    Not best location but spot still works  Good prices great food decent margarita  usually pretty good service  fine dining but attentive    I'll back    <EOR> My friend decided Mexican food   He took since he's before he likes supporting locals    Our server interesting one    According receipt name Andrew   He likes see you're doing walking asking everything without stopping   hilarious watch every time he did that    As food friend carnitas tacos soup which he liked   wanted something fatty fulfilling Mex bowl looking pictures people posted Yelp   dish little big side   ate most stuffed   thought alright   don't think huge carnitas fan   just forgot tasted like  should've carne   remember next time    <EOR> Great service   great food    great atmosphere   place great new favorite   lot Mexican food restaurants but best  <EOR> Ok give them 4 stars cause everything service cleanliness presentation just fine    Thing though other Macayo locations very Americanized Mexican food  Being location smack Dab middle many other authentic Spanish speaking only Mexican eateries well made figure Macayo may fall authentic Mexican category   Well everything very America style salsas enchiladas taco salads  took few bites Togo boxes gave food homeless dude front  really looking Mexican Street taco corn vibe   style    Now negative review being full house customers all seemed throughly enjoying style Mexican food  still kick down 4 stars friendliness staff cleanliness overall kind service  <EOR> I've always enjoyed going home Texas eat Tex Mex   Macayo's  just taken away reasons visit Texas   Great service Linda   Some best Tex Mex ever eaten    <EOR> It's all nostalgia  first Macayo's 40 years ago then Shirley Temples TCT's regular staple  TCT's Shirley's eventually evolved into green chile cheese enchiladas diet pepsi  whenever back Vegas  visit just those places take kids  hasn't changed  kid menu EXACT menu 40 years ago minus sucker used punch through center  chips salsa TCT's enchiladas   all same  great food  borderline good  But nostalgic keep coming back  <EOR> My family going Macayo E  Charleston 50 years still love food atmosphere  15 when first started going now even though moved Henderson Macayo which wish did sure once awhile especially birthday  love shredded lettuce salad guacamole course enchiladas   great food  <EOR> Had first hopefully last visit   unimpressed food   thought prices high quality or lack thereof food   cleanliness bathroom bordering unacceptable   But close office nice time friend  <EOR> Good Mexican food hard find unless border lands San Diego Texas   Macayo quite although good job Vegas   This isn't cleanest establishment send back glass two due lettuce sauce rim glass   staff friendly enough replace glass right away   varied menu burritos tacos enchiladas chimichangas   chimi's very good   They great salsa dipping chips but chips sometimes stale tasting     I enjoy faitas great lunch specials   tortillas same problem chips sometimes taste stale   Still overall Macayo potential come close Southern California restaurant level   said lunch specials location favorite local attorneys businesspersons  <EOR> Mmm   Macayo    Me lots!   M elt your mouth incredibly delish  A ddicting   C heese world  A gain Addicting  Y ou only wish some  O nly Vegas    Oh Arizona  I don't eat Mexican food often though if places close where live would probably turn burrito   I'm talken lip smaken melt your mouth wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!!   We order cheese nachos which AMAZING!! nachos years major decadent explosion cheesy goodness feed deep rooted cheese addict me    also ordered some sort Cheese Chicken quesadilla though called something else Thick fluffy tortilla stuffed thick chunks chicken again most incredibly flavorful cheese literally ever all some superbly fantabulous guacamole side    needless say felt size super burrito when left   This place really addicting  don't know kind flavor add cheese though any cheese lover's idea heaven   The overall appearance restaurant nothing fancy just typical Mexican chain joint service probably hit miss though food     you just try  <EOR> Alright all know Macayo's but wonder many grew Macayo's??  right yours truly did  Most everyone knows incredible food  but really chips Macayo salsa can't tell many times downed bowls bowls chips salsa  many Macayo's restaurants come gone old old Paradise Road think when street two ways most recent closing W  Charleston Blvd couple years ago sniffle sniffle   leaves only three locations   My friend enjoy popping oldest locations E  Charleston  Yeah greatest part town but definitely locals place  history coming restaurant partying always open wee hours fix  stopped yesterday grab lunch enjoyed lunch specials  didn't anything fancy except your typical Mexican fare tacos burrito frijoles rice tortillas   nothing complain about  food good service exceptional! Oh course chips salsa warm tasty    Whenever need taste old Las Vegas know always Macayo's am filled warm memories days gone by! <EOR> Not sure happened Macayos but spot tradition ate here  service horrible  sat waited 10 minutes before waitress came table give water  Although 5pm Friday 3 waitresses working walking past making eye contacting wait time unacceptable  When finally did drink order waitress drinks wrong  Long story short    Macayos always Macayos but waitress even manager duty at time need change service staff probably closing off tropicana Maryland parkway  <EOR> Been going restaurant since little never disappoints me! staff food amazing! Love everyone works especially Linda Diana Carmen <EOR> Sat waited 45 minutes just table because server couldn't serve between 2 different rooms  Assistant manager Linda argued group because did reservation reservation party more important other customers  Linda argued would let speak cut off walked away me  worst customer service ever experienced cannot believe customer would treated way when asked apology she continued argue why she did need give group one  also two people walkers stand wait  come location especially if Linda working  <EOR>
