Price range usually $8 $11 per order! also poke bowl! sushi burrito premade options build your own bowl  Prices bowls cheaper range $6 50 $8  only reason why didn't rate 5 bowls tasted kinda bland lacked little more flavor  bad if you're looking something simple  Besides everything else good! bit small inside but usually clean employees friendly! take time explain options  <EOR> Great service food  your own  Options awesome <EOR> Went recent trip vegas far favorite spot  Very quick attentive service  food amazing prices very good  Sushi expensive but bit over $20 fiancé both burrito we're stuffed  price extra meat add ons  soft she'll crab tuna avocado seaweed salad masago along free toppings  amount if food would cost over $60 traditional sushi spot    probably much more vegas  loved much 2x 3 days vegas last stop before going airport  Seriously if sushi take time visit place less 10 minutes strip   you your stomach thank me! definitely returning every time visit Vegas future  <EOR> This place ridiculously close job eating lot  known sushi burritos but also poke bowls teriyaki bowls unique sides  burritos pretty small though usually own poke bowl  find much larger use more protein competitors  use small scoop but give three those per protein  if chose 3 proteins 9 scoops! Plus generous helping white brown sushi rice   lot food ya'll    They basic sides edamame miso soup but also delicious taro chips flavored furikake cheddar sour cream onion  chips tasty come nacho cheese sauce dipping  If add drink combo price which saves few $$$   This place does charge extra protein premium toppings though but since generous portions deal breaker me  <EOR> Holy bowly!!! place all! quality all ingredients bowl wrap Sunny Salmon top notch!

They don't skimp amount fish although cut into much smaller pieces which may may like  Personally bigger pieces since more fish flavor texture but smaller pieces also mean won't easily fall your sushi burrito   I definitely come back especially since couple blocks home  <EOR> This location feels isolated some reason but just off 215 jones  never complex maybe  why  multiple locations asked workers if difference between new location other ones them said place teriyaki bowls    I arrived around 5 something afternoon  place dead  3 workers point greeting us  girl took order delight  She big smile smile face entire time    I ordered twin dragon  She asked if wanted soy paper seaweed ordered soy  personally would more if asked if want white brown rice cos she started making burrito soon said felt bad she change soy paper cos she already put white rice it  Sorry!
