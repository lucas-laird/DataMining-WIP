For all service glitches burger surprisingly good   exactly worth $14 but roll nice fresh skinny fries crispy burger decent flavor   original server finally checked rest dinner fine   However way decided visit restrooms clean am sorry didn't into casino instead   pretty sad state reminded more facilities would find college bar   Several stalls unusable suspect while since staff checked it   Yuck! <EOR> Although restaurant only 1 4 full wait long time seated  Annoying but least watch large fish floor to ceiling aquarium    As might expect food drink just okay  food adequate but quite unmemorable  really really push buying souvenir glass but retrospect much good deal  drinks sound good menu but  weak tasting  bottle beer instead least know you're getting    But food drink much why Rain Forest Cafe it? fun atmosphere right?

Never life manager establishment sass while point product below mediocre  She deducted half price burger giving everyone table horrible attitude experience   No party ever wants visit another Rainforest Cafe based experience manager gave us   If want amazing food excellent service decent price Gordon Ramsey's BurGR Planet Hollywood  difference literally night day  <EOR> $20 plate unsatisfying borderline disgusting nachos? $16 pina colada even hint rum?   I came knowing expecting outrageous prices but also expecting food somewhat good much ask? don't understand why food drinks just      good  supposed paying atmosphere? Sure kind fun sit around stuffed animals fake waterfalls but thunderstorm comes every 20 minutes drives nuts  guess more kid place  So     if kids some reason took them Vegas suppose would take them here  Otherwise see no reason spend $40 dining plate nachos sugary drink  Better off going buffet price  <EOR> Even though Juliette spilled pitcher water table she awesome     Very friendly    food good pricey but f Vegas   Id give server 5 food 3plus  <EOR> As sitting Rainforest Cafe lightning storm sounds began turn around see small child terrified look face  thought myself Hey buddy know exactly feel   say sense terrified prices service food just had  restaurant probably worst while  only redeeming quality place kids might but worth paying obscene prices crappy food? Probably not    After night drinking few friends decided Rainforest Cafe because other Cafe MGM Casino some horrible reviews  Sadly didn't bother reading reviews rainforest cafe beforehand  burgers where overcooked dry turkey wrap dry no zero dressing  food took good 40 minutes arrive  waiters bringing food where rude seemed bother them if asked them missing items  disappointment  <EOR> I'm east coast north Rain Forest Cafe Atlantic City NJ always catches eye because rainforest theme however first time restaurant Vegas  first night Vegas did want far decided stay hotel MGM eat restaurant there    Even though restaurant looked half full wait 30 mins three  waiting 30 mins decided sit bar eat  information volunteered ask  hostesses very friendly nor informative    Once sat down bartender greeted immediately then started some drinks us  She took orders short time later food took very long served  Also ordered appetizers came main entrees  burger pretty good  mom fish chips awesome!

Unfortunately didn't even eat visit  friend attempted stop Friday afternoon  seated relatively quickly then forgotten about  sat good fifteen minutes never greeted waiter  No water no food no nothing! finally just left   Sorry Rainforest   but lost business!

So kitchen!  This bad because lot potential place where ppl enjoy fun   As long rating don't think eat again <EOR> The only reason husband dinner down Strip gambling drinking since 10 AM line Avenue Cafe long  didn't wait very long food least hot flavorful when came out  Husband pot roast some type pasta bit spicy  tomato basil bisque good  Prices ridiculous got  VERY loud yes waterfall little wet  thinking if I'd three less margaritas could stood line other cafe  short probably really great kids but then brings kids Sin City? Apparently plenty people saw week there  Whatever  <EOR> I tanks    thats mean its bad if wanna ur own opinion eat but once enough food big deal actually its kinda bad its pricey animal sounds every 10 minutes ? without   The only good thing its its inside fav hotels MGM  <EOR> Two words Mojo Bones!  First off decor amazing   Definitely lure attraction place   very fun touristy place all fake foliage fauna surrounding while eat   food itself secondary   Speaking food ribs nicknamed Mojo Bones great!

Very professional   Seriously people  live work Vegas  You'd think you'd used crap now  Try being little professional less Bevis Butthead fer cryin' loud  <EOR> Good food those gamblers wants take break giving casinos money   LOL <EOR> Ughhh  Feel bad suggesting place eat last day Vegas  waste time!! money seeing everything way overpriced mediocre tasting food  remember place kid idea awesome    But food price just no especially if you've rainforest buffet before then worth another trip  Besides insane prices wait insane amount time  took 15 minutes seated busy Monday afternoon took another 15 waitress took 25 30 minutes food then took 20 25 minutes flag down server ask check which walk over hand bill back run card spent way much time there  I feel bad ideas waste family's time leading place  Poor waitress running around but come hire more people cuz wait obnoxious  <EOR> Rainforest Cafe definitely everyone's cup tea or vodka matter Vegas but definitely good medium family reunion 17 people Las Vegas   Prices decent portions huge serve alchohol child friendly environment!  particularly easy since would take large reservation without any deposit even baby group could enjoy! Service prompt always very attentive   always drinks re filled quickly    The food definitely best nor worst find strip noise entertainment thunder rain gorillas birds made conversation difficult   Prices also very reasonable poorest college kid could afford well But again medium definitely good choice overall group    ordered Volcano Cake birthday boy enough share among all us! I wouldn't hesitate book group dinner again whole process easy peasy! <EOR> The place looks cool  kids enjoy   $10 bowl kids mac n cheese much  no fruit veggies side? My wife shared pizza  tasted cheap bake home frozen pizza  Food overpriced quality  Service good  <EOR> I Awesome Appetizer Adventure which neither awesome nor adventure  waiter seemed annoyed just having appetizers drinks eventhough 2 pm Friday afternoon place half empty he took order didn't check again until time pay  only person seemed actually care if food if needed anything else runner I don't know technical term   waiter's assistant? Juan very sweet  appetizers lukewarm calamari chewy vomit   retrospect shouldve just sent back instead just learned lesson next time  <EOR> Interesting place Vegas  animal sounds rain fog or whatever supposed be nice touch dining more fun  food average say least   I steak shrimp lunch good  did its job satisfying craving expensive lunch  food might find typical American cuisine restaurant nothing rave about  blue crab dip appetizer which surprisingly great  distinct crab flavor  did version mai tai which die for   not much alcohol which like very fruity  <EOR> I really excited visit restaurant lunch weekday during first trip Vegas  always wanted eat place   This very loud but major complaint time took receive main dish  appetizer arrived decent timing  main dish took forever! Over 20 25 minutes  ridiculous  starving considered climbing tree munch some leaves until order arrived  only thing  thatstopped thunder     gorillas   P  Aside decor thunder rainforest fun  just wish food would arrive faster  <EOR> It's basically above average place some food before night drinking clubbing   everyone said pricey getting your typical American type food but portions good all portions   animal noises faux lightning wasn't distracting    just part theme people!  expect RAINFOREST cafe? <EOR> On first day Vegas thought 4 year old daughter would really enjoy theme Rainforest Cafe   Instead she pretty freaked all sounds sights couldn't wait outta there     The food all right just felt everything little pricey   example Rasta Pasta which basically pesto penne grilled chicken $17 99   Fountain drinks $2 99 each   Service wasn't very good either     Bottom line worth your money unless your kids really enjoy setting  <EOR> The food tastes good but portions small plates expensive   The atmosphere cute   If kids hard guess if would hate it  seen some kids excited others become frightened  eaten Phoenix Las Vegas locations     honestly could take leave it  <EOR> In short Rainforest Cafe poor value money  menu pricing high end spectrum i e $10 00 Kids meal juice food run mill Sysco food service type nothing special   ambience excellent i e  Fancy Fish Tank rain thunder every 30 mins service pathetically below average   pasta served without spoon   Why would serve pasta without spoon?  Would serve steake without steak knife? Back college worked Darden General Mills restaurants 4 years  NEVER EVER serve pasta without spoon!  engraved every staff's brain top bottom   So tried flagged down staff  server busboy runner hostess ANYONE!  6 mins person looked way 2 arms raised waving back and forth  Until finally waitress walked literally GRAB she zips by   think service acceptable?  Finally when grabbed waitress asked spoon pasta asked fresh ground pepper mill told isn't whole restaurant fact later confirmed manager when asked forher    server grabbed told use pepper table   OH REALLY!!?? think am blind didn't notice salt pepper shaker front me?  To clear assigned waitress server VERY GOOD   asked extra saltine crackers clam chowder but when runner brought soup standard bag crackers she noticed asked runner bring another he appearently forgotten   also asked extra plate share once again runner forgotten it     I think some SERIOUS service issue reataurant  Particularly hospitality service TEAM work just individual effort   $90 bucks lunch think stick Nathan's hotdogs next time when staying MGM Grand   Edit I received call 2 days later returned home restaurant manager stating received comment survey filled out card   He said fresh peper mills baffled why staff didn't know it   Regardless he thanked comment complaint agreed some more staff training  <EOR> Of course food great   rainforest cafe you're food   It's BAD just know you're getting into   We recent Saturday evening   all times thought would acceptable being bit drunk bit rowdy rainforest   okay staff kudos them being uptight but couple patrons around us   portly couple sitting immediately adjacent table VERY serious food   No riffraff tolerated   Sorry folks can't help friend guy  Okay maybe could but don't want to!

Finally called down Concierge mentioned unsuccessful last 10 minutes I waited call twice more hoping accident know glutton punishment but those know know am huge pushover ALWAYS think such things 5th chances         After confirming reservation concierge called back say Cafe said would wait 2 hours reservation but if wanted head down now we'd able seated right away   ?????   So headed down 2 hours later just because girls we're just into Lazy River  When condescending hostess asked OVER enunciated every syllable AM SORRY KNOW IF ACTUALLY MADE RES ER VA TION TODAY? DIFFERENT DAY? UNDERSTAND? blinked back disbelief considering 2 pm half restaurant empty wasn't even line walk area    So fired back Yes Indeed understand saying  reservation 2 called your line OWNERS suite Signature hung on    interrupted oh we're very busy tends happen  acceptable but personal concierge call down reservation Signature does perhaps refresh your memory?

But digress    The food sucks  Nothing special overpriced  course decor novel sounds obnoxious maybe scary theme loudly announces itself if you're into that    Since don't to  Skip it  <EOR> We just split appetizer platter which reasonable   Most other food very over priced  <EOR> I wanted update review reason most reviews negative because price  want clarify if looking place where food just valuable price don't come here  expensive  other hand if looking place take kids special occasions don't mind spending little extra fun atmosphere then your place  <EOR> Definitely spot check if you're area  name speaks itself  being exactly right heart rainforest  Friendly staff provide excellent service  having drink right next elephant  Must see! <EOR> The most disappointing rainforest to  Service ok  Food awful   My meat stiff  chicke  ordered tasted frozen  <EOR> 3 5  This wasn't first choice came limb because restaurant needed reservation order good seat   willing splurge no view seating left   overextended ourselves strip no option but late last stop   The food surprisingly good but service very very spotty tomato basil soup no spoon lol   But good soup saved chagrin   cheese pizza good also big finish   chicken beef fajita decent burger fancy name must passable because all eaten   end chef saved day pls give overworked chef raise    The noise restaurant very high!  cute first half hour then bothersome then all wanted heck there   The fish tanks best part other food come back look fish maybe soup next time    <EOR> Just ate last night  When place took 10 15 min seated  Once seated waiter rushed through specials   When ordered food took over 20 min brought us  ordered Cobb salad shit ruined vacation! food poisoning!!!!

My gf came breakfast because thought looked cool   bandits breakfast  surprised tiny portions when plate  1 slice bacon 1 sausage 2 small eggs tiny amount hashbrowns only 1 slice toast  couldn't believe it   $12   The main reason writing review coffee prices  gf both ordered regular coffees shocked when bill came found charged $4 each cup coffee!   I would recommend checking place outside but coming in! <EOR> I lot Rainforest Cafes but worst them seen  food horrible did take forever arrive though  Prices quite outrageous but guess expect tourist area such this  biggest complaint staff  paid meal left very nice tip over 20% leave waiter took bill   walking several people came running yelling making scene  Some staff member looked cook bus boy gets face tells better pay bill before think leaving  course friends severely confused since already paid but even though try convey keep treating very rudely  standing least five minutes front whole restaurant people looking no find waiter verify paid  Finally staff member moves aside says without explaining apologizing  worst restaurant experiences had  would recommend it  <EOR> Salmon Dry overcooked  Servers pleasant   but service bit sloooow  used take kids years ago    but don't think return <EOR> I just recently Rainforest Cafe Saturday morning breakfast  Although seating right away took server 10 minutes table because he busy  watched running around restaurant chicken head cut off knew he way many tables  never complain server restaurant unless really bad because worked business myself know just sat being friendly  server arrived took order waited  took 30 minutes food come order breakfast Mexican style pizza eggs potatoes sausage  eggs horribly disgusting couldn't even eat them! mexican pizza ok good but ok  all costs around $40 bucks crappy food  Next time just Starbucks pastry coffee  <EOR> Be advised review based off first time experience  didn't well wife went   I give place 2 5 star overall rating    I say absolutely loved Rainforest Cafe theme  mean simulate tropical storm fictitious animals move believe talk noise A cool place keep kids entertain   felt place lot different other restaurants wife visited Vegas   The waitress ok    she wasn't bad but wasn't great either  times she would disappear duration time before would see again    So finally found flagged down put drink food orders  where things started downhill   After waiting 30 45 minutes only filling stomachs drinks began looking around other tables  Immediately realized people restaurant well before just starting receive meals  knew right kitchen backed going long night 1 star demotion    However sat waited patiently waiting another 45 minutes hour Could longer but hungry doing whatever could take mind off super late food time waitress finally brought food   I ordered Tastes Islands when meal presented immediately say waitress know ordered hour ago but pretty sure meal suppose come scallops fools fries plate   But done yet because only did mess but wife's food cold when finally took bite food cold well 2 star demotion   correction scallops which only hot item Should first time wasn't bad   Finally talked manager he tells he'll comp entire meal thus reason gave them half star increase overall rating   Hey saying place  Maybe wife just bad luck time around  Your luck might better kitchen might running behind   Hopefully your meal better ours when went  <EOR> I personally think Rainforest Cafe better located downtown Disney  little busier same set but portions much larger Anaheims opinion  <EOR> I ate  payed good tip  throwed evening ruined whole vegas plan  <EOR> We party  four adult 3 kids 1 baby 6 4 14  First all party helped right away no wait 9 PM  ask high hair four times finally arrived  also wait crackers which never arrived  server ok' but other help there  kids food came different times  adult food cooked all way through burger  birthday cupcake dried crunchy  paid 93 54 meal including tip  awful  wait boxes refills napkins spill  staff into conversations cleaning  few tables establishment ignored  pest part guests receipt list four hum?
