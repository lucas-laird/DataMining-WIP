Beautiful presentation friendly service!

Then he says umm  Well much it?? don't work dude! Just say yes no or even better let find you! Don't give pop quizzes YOUR menu   Honestly should taken all sign order anything because food MUCH worse    We ordered 2 pieces sake nigiri 2 pieces maguro nigiri 1 cup miso soup iced tea  maguro cloudy off color  tasted terrible old  sake better but only slightly  didn't velvety melt your mouth taste should  miso soup no tofu wakame wasn't even very hot    But say this  iced tea delicious server super nice  If review gets noticed please sure server working today we came around 1pm lunch Halloween gets pat back  If weren't would 1 star    Conclusion? recommend  <EOR> The excellent service tipped review 4 stars   $27 per person no lunch price pretty pricey AYCE but kids 3 under free definite plus young families     This sushi decent enough but stingy fish which made nigiri very disappointing   fish fresh though husband raved baked mussels because weren't covered mayonnaise different more flavorful sauce most place   also thought uni nigiri lot better expecting AYCE joint  <EOR> I really place lot  Every time they've great service family  prices great definitely coming back regular occasion <EOR> Not bad  First time trying place out  I 3 combo bento came w House salad good Miso soup tasty but barely any tofu seaweed Chicken breast part chicken dry but tasty Mixed Tempura good Steamed Rice I asked sushi rice instead Your choice basic roll I yellowtail+avocado good presentation wise   they just cut threw plate but tasty All all everything favorite word review Tasty  Well back again since close home    Oh love chairs table  <EOR> Tried first time all eat   Employees friendly food good   left satisfied <EOR> When place extreme sushi wasn't very great usually drive sushi mom sushi  But changed place aLOT service great especially sitting bar   Michael awesome sushi chef!
