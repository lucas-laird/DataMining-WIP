Suggestions 1 Employees wash hands longer 0 5 seconds when coming backc break stepping store  2 Employees wear gloves when serving samples orders  3 store look little more presentable  4 Keep ice cream scoops clean especially VERY slow nights    don't think didn't see filthy ice cream holder washer thing Mr  Thrifty's worker behind counter 5 Hire people more personality   anyone else knows speak actually converse customers   It very uncomfortable felt unsafe family when pan handlers would outside laying down floor asking money   Both going store   sure stopped but also don't know if ever trip again   <EOR> Worst location Vegas  numerous times dont milk shakes  see happening once but happened over 50% time ive gone there  No more chances sure people know wont waste time  <EOR> Place kinda small looks bit old but        THRIFTY Ice cream !!!     takes back kid days !!!   the kid glasses welcoming shy giving big scoops money's worth !!!! <EOR> I love Thrifty ice cream  favorite flavors black cherry mint chip circus animal cookies <EOR> I love ice cream here!
