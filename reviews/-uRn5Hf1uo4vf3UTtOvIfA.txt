I Carne Asada plate very mediocre  Carne Asade greasy lot pieces very gristly  try again but busy perhaps all scraps 0630 hours Monday  Y <EOR> Fast good enough worthwhile  gourmet then again prices reflect that  <EOR> This use Robertos Taco Shop Robertos favorite Mexican Food paces Las Vegas  very far house food great  Now Don Tortaco   Since change name service really gone down hill  made trip while back when first changed name two recent visits  last two times handed food bag if order  Don't hand food bag am welcome your restaurant?   Anyway ordered Carne Asada Chimichanga first trip  thing over cooked bit but passable  didn't much cheese Robertos item wasn't quite good  second trip order two beef taco combination plate taco shells way over cooked  wait drink while cashier decided take another order  top rice beans come combination plate just very bland   I'm going again  <EOR> Food fresh  hot  Exactly ordered  Taste great  really recommend place  <EOR> I came Don Tortaco expecting slightly better version Robertos  wrong  decor might better but food notch below  carne asada fries lacked flavor chunks fat it  never seen such large chunks fat any Robertos ever had   meat seemed lack flavor didn't remind carne asada fries love   The staff whole other story  Hard find anyone order from  Lady front desk extremely inattentive literally run away back she play phone play music  girlfriend walked ask cup water cook sees he runs off side starts chatting cashier  Most unacceptable behavior seen anywhere long time    There many Robertos nearby much better same price  No reason ever come place insultingly rude staff  <EOR> i did place  only thing think going red salsa salsa bar  ordered plate adobada shit BURNT  saying well done would fine  saying didn't bite didn't taste charred bullshit  drown shit salsa  did give tons onions cilantro if say know messed up  put all over your food better   rice flavorless mushy  beans tasted old hard spots them  bummed out  never trashed place review before doesn't feel good  <EOR> I found place looking Roberto's Taco Shop  Apparently some them changed Don Tortaco's   This place open 24hrs 365 days year! Christmas morning around 4am visit strip found only place open miles!  The food phenomenal cheap big servings! lengua burrito fairly big wife chicken enchilada plate beans rice  All food fresh super tasty   I highly recommend them even if middle night holiday chances open  <EOR> Every Don Tortaco seems slightly different next  advertises buffalo wings actually them  big Fiasco another Don tortaco where advertising wings but everytime ask them said them five different occasions  buffalo wings but did use traditional buffalo sauce your red sauce lady running register seem she hated job <EOR> After being stuck strip felt eternity  morning bringing new year all wanted some tacos  js moved wasn't sure where but place closest thing still open  Didn't expect greatest since 4 am   but he cooked Carne asada tacos right face  fresh delicious  all thinking since  believe found go to spot  <EOR> Great place food inexpensive good  Always fresh see cooks back preparing  Always greeted smile patient never know want right when come in  family all love food great job! <EOR> It looks Mexican food but very bland  asked if could plate just item told yes  Which why surprised expense  pricy because two item plate  don't know if try again  another review  <EOR> This place very tasty very inexpensive  can't wait back try chips cheese  2 hard shell beef tacos chicken burrito  <EOR> Food pretty good but cashier stole dollar change  total $8 91 something only given back $10 bill some pennies  Didn't realize untill finished food  sure your receipt before walk way  didn't feel fighting dollar but left bad impression restaurant being first time ate here  <EOR> Not bees knees best taco place stated other posts  Basically second rate Roberto's  talked friend going because she wanted PePes   big mistake!  Terrible customer service  Cashier reluctant take order let alone answer questions react comments  She yelled across room while holding tray staring direction food ready knew she speaking us  time realized she yelling she seemed thoroughly annoyed because walking food table convenient   food tasty tacos greasy chicken dry   Wouldn't recommend  chains least you'll consistency  <EOR> I gone other don tortaco other one  thought food far superior Robertos but service terrible location   My boyfriend likes burritos meat bean rice  No guac no pico  wanted charge more ingredients cost less  said can't him  just lost customer  Ended going Robertos  <EOR> Decent local Mexican food chain menu plates tacos burritos chimichangas  Menu isn't much different Roberto's but location little less casual shares space PT's next door   Fish tacos tasty though chunk fish little smaller other comparably priced tacos town  California Burrito just $6 which decent pricing massive portion  Three piece rolled tacos extra crispy bit fried actually  upcharge adding guac gets ton though  bad isn't fresh seemed premade mix which tragic Mexican restaurant   Service friendly  Outdated tube TV dining room  Lots seating including porch  Entrance weirdly placed all around patio Marie Callendar's entrance  <EOR> Its Robertos    basically     its ok   i usually when am weak      usually regret decision few minutes eating <EOR> Pretty chill   Dudes actually cooking Carne asada fries right front me   Nice     SALSA Bit MESSY   But price all well   Good shit don  tor  <EOR> First time coming here  Place wide open alot sitting manu very similar Roberto manu  ordered chicken tostadas  asked cashier came tostadas didnt quiet all real ingredients real Mexican tostada  being optimistic ahead ordered it  very plain much flavor asked if rice side beans instead    price reasonable bad service very good music playing truly mexican  Likes alot  Memory Lane childhood lol   had Ficente Fernandez back back  Overall Don't know if ill try again     probably won't come back  <EOR> Great food great selection very authentic   definitely frequent restaurant  <EOR> It good but great  chicken tacos carne asada torta  chicken dry but everything came taco made better  <EOR> Decent food mainly order carne asada nachos because tasty  place good place when your looking quick bite eat but there's really nothing fancy food place itself  <EOR> This place never busy which good thing when you're rush  staff also friendly   I usually carne asada fries which very good  huge portion everything cook properly  tried bean cheese which wasn't great  <EOR> I've only item menu but great  recommend grilled chicken special  comes rice beans lettuce tomato avocado  also comes tortillas but skip them  location smells smoke PTs next door  Otherwise I'd give more star  <EOR> It's nice 24 hours especially since they're connected Pts  staff very friendly shrimp Diablo always delicious!
