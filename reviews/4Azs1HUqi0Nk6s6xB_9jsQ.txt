Ok   imagine going Vegas you'll thinking going great   Hit Strip good meal but place   not   repeat AYCE sushi because F'ing takes forever   took hour before first order   Thinking being smart once received first order decided order second set sushi   Apparently wasn't smart   30 mins later still waiting   Hey!  Mister Mgr saying sorry other negative reviews promising better   Keep your empty promises hire better sushi chefs actually handle AYCE sushi orders  <EOR> All eat great deal $28 sushi good  Alaskan roll spring roll cucumber salad delicious however service slowest ever experienced  took 15 min greeted ask water repeatedly none dishes ever cleared waiter frequently absent when wanted order more ask water  Such shame <EOR> I happy found sushi restaurant inside hotel  today sit sushi bar friend  sushi chef very nice first  food good  service great  Venny server    Here dissapointed  end meal when ready leave shorter light skin sushi chef ask tip  He said because he already gave 2 free food but didn't ask it! couldn't believe it!!! J W  Marriott Hotel employee asking customer tip??!!! shame!! Isn't hotel train associates? My friends told before situation but just belive said  Now experience myself just wonder if he asked all customer bar tip   I would give restaurant 5 stars but cannot because chef ruin whole thing  Maybe next time just sit dining area enjoy dinner without somebody soliciting  <EOR> Poor choices during buffet nights  recently Monday only few diners seated restaurant  server friendly but difficult ahold of  <EOR> We excellent dinner sat tappanyaki grill food fabulous chef  Did experience any bad service food fresh served quickly  <EOR> The service sushi happy hour okay but unfortunately food habachi table horrible  dipping sauces bland well cooked items  Although prices slightly higher other Japanese restaurants quality food much worse  No seasoned butter oil used no care used chopping vegetables better taste better presentation  very disappointed  <EOR> The service just flawless     all say  server day Venny  She suggested some choices kids which turned taste amazing  She vividly described food told daily special  some sushi which pretty decent but steak son ordered even better! Thanks again Venny recommending it  <EOR> Would most likely 2 if didn't such nice servers   might more stars if some sort atmosphere here   Disclaimer staying hotel didn't want venture out   seemed good option   We reservations 8pm Friday night   Earlier day received call confirm reservation because get's very busy wanted sure would coming    When arrive found 1 2 couples entire place   Wha??  Friday night right?  Where everyone?  Apparently Frankie Avalon concert started 7pm just missed rush   So    it kind crowd here     While excited teppanyaki table ourselves prices little rich tastes   $48 steak shrimp meal seemed little steep   seen show many times excited didn't want pay experience   moved regular table   The other big thing None menus correct   give 3 when sit down   ordered Gyoza listed menu available chicken shrimp asked if pork ok  all had   While actually listed menu but Opentable and Yelp only serve Beer Wine   wine listed 2 different prices depending menu read   continued find little errors waitress just laughed apologized   She knew ridiculous becoming   Otherwise food good service good   no vibe no other people no attention detail menu   outside seating despite read   However would likely come back since definitely other places better atmosphere  <EOR> Tried Shizen first time tonight all say Wow! sat Sushi Bar Chef Paul only took care but amazed unique Sushi creations!

Very nice server  would recommend place if staying Marriott Resort Las Vegas looking Japanese meal  <EOR> They really need work level service because pretty awful   My wife did teppanyaki dining other night   reservation arrived right time   seated noticed reservation sheet other groups people table  perhaps many because when seated hostess said Oh probably end pulling another chair over fit them in  Why should feel cramped table because someone made mistake overbooked when taking reservations?  any case party didn't show didn't ever run into issues   After seated only minute before drink orders taken   drinks arrived couple minutes later made orders   Fully 20 minutes elapsed between when waiter dropped drinks off before he came again drop off miso salads even then ask he walking away refill very empty glasses     Eventually 35 minutes seated chef showed along yakitori chicken skewer appetizer   40 minutes being seated ramen finally showed up   40 minutes!    In any case chef good although food left bit desired price   yakitori overcooked dry ramen bit close packaged noodles store although broth chicken nice rice bit bland filet would much better traditional steakhouse preparation   bright spot meal teppanyaki chicken   all spent nearly 3x much time waiting food did actually eating   If meal hadn't comped didn't time kill before meeting someone probably would left without getting anything other first round drinks  <EOR> We stay JW Marriott whenever travel Las Vegas   facilities superb service proximity family perfect destination  tried Shizen 1st time June 6th mixed results  potstickers sushi first rate  $25 teriyaki beyond bad  chicken tasted rubber worse even you'd expect frozen cutlets  ice tea made concentrate tasted awful  restaurants credit weren't charged teriyaki brought lack quality attention   advice order sushi only if dine Shizen  <EOR> I read reviews place just before left   asked question when arrived before?  A while back pretty good  reservations 7 30pm Friday night   good call thought   table 5 all arrived time     Service pretty slow start   only 2 other tables although two small parties around hibachi    Additionally few people sushi bar but very quiet   Reservations definitely required           Finally drinks arrived all ordered couple sushi dishes each some edamame start     After nearly hour I'm kidding walked over find some food waiting side delivered table   5 plates 3 then 4 ready but just sitting there        drying up   We asked why food taking long guy I hope he's waiter! abruptly turned said We're VERY busy! only other table still waiting food WHOLE restaurant     It took over hour before all food arrived     The rolls small though tasty   food didn't taste terribly bad but lost lot fresh just made taste separates sushi supermarket sushi   One sushi chef type restaurant Friday night?   crazy   Maybe because few people come eat don't need many staff don't need many staff comes eat?  way dismal meal appalling overall service surprisingly restaurant sits inside JW Marriott Resort??  wonder if know bad is?  The manager did come over finally apologize us   offered free beer for those drinking beer 15% off   She did good job listening but feel isn't first time she's heard complaints looking other reviews sure not   One thing's sure TV shows failing restaurants this   Gordon Ramsey where you?  Would recommend restaurant sushi? Methinks not  <EOR> I met some friends JW Marriott teppanyaki dinner   seen Shizen but never restaurant     After server took drink orders chef arrived started fried rice grill   He did some fun stuff such flaming onion tower he did routine fork knife but wasn't whole lot showy cooking   He affable guy   The food well prepared ample portions   teppanyaki also miso soup salad   Prices comparable other teppanyaki places  <EOR> Great food fabulous atmosphere  great way spend Friday night  steak superb  back  <EOR> I high hopes place passed over years sure might nice place to   So roll without reservation lucky didn't reserve far busy Friday night   We we're waiting long seated  first impression business normal sushi place actually kinda thought decor little cheap  standard marriott would present   We grab few rolls nothing really special menu stood could really say would back again   Had some green tea ice cream which wasn't bad little sugar side which nice touch   All all just average  place id back because Same experience better somewhere else <EOR> Stayed JW Marriott didn't feel driving anywhere  Shizen located Rampart Casino actually owned operated JW Marriott   For being Monday dining room quite full possibly due heavy rain  incurred  receiving flash flood warnings every couple minutes cell phone  waitress Hawaii incredibly friendly gave some solid recommendations sushi rolls order  Service turnaround orders quick considering busy were   The seaweed salad calamari salad poki fried tofu shishito peppers solid starters  then enjoyed tuna eel salmon scallop uni clam sushi  Last round included baked mussels spicy tuna roll crunch roll Las Vegas roll  ended Japanese feast yummy hot bowl miso soup    Only con no room dessert! Overall satisfied service Quality mention convenience dining short walk hotel room   BTW Sunday Monday AYCE sushi only $28 00 head  <EOR> This second time such blast girlfriends!
