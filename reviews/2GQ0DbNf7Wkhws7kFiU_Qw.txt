I ordered spicy hot dog which decent but quite thin  bread chewy  hot dog wasn't very hot even eating right buying it  <EOR> Wurstle worst  groupon $5 $10 indicated gourmet sausages  stick hotdog type sausage little flavor hollowed baguette shaped roll and stick some coleslaw yellow mustard ketchup it   fries baked toaster oven pickle soft salty inedible  If actually paid full price $10 71 would returned it   Service painfully slow  <EOR> Sigh always willing try something new   seeing sign saying next evolution Hot Dog of course try it!    Yeah place unmentionable won't even bother writing ordered   OK well cheese filled jalapeno sausage   Sigh   Just skip whole booth  <EOR> $6 supposed gourmet sausage such rip off! bread okay but hot dog sub par  Unbelievable! Prices supposed inflated Town Square but geesh    think hot dog literally worth $1   The employee kind friendly did she could  She all herself but later evening sure if  normal thing   I would back fast food stand  <EOR> Wurstle interesting concept lot room grow but few kinks work out   Basically hot dog stand own unique bread sauces    many different kinds sausage cheddar spicy two remember along plain baguette wheat one   kind hollow inside baguette put sauces additions including mustard ketchup onions sauerkraut then put sausage hole     The product good but few things odd it   First all any toppings put invariably fall bottom baguette instead being evenly distributed   Also seems sausage thin compared bread sometimes flavor lost amongst flavor bread   Finally absolutely atrocious when cold I know because when giving samples tray kind cold cooled off pieces very quickly   Note owners point samples good presentation delicious product entice people try your product!  If sample's bad people think product's bad when really isn't! Anyway bad but best either   give them another shot week worth shot  <EOR> I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best hot dog ever had! Totally recommend jalapeño cheddar  Chicken good   <EOR> I thought hot dogs looked every bit interesting basically hotdog hallow piece french bread condiments also filled inside bread well So while walking through Town Square gave into temptation mini hot dogs Nutella filled puffs try here's verdict Yuck!!! Hot dogs itself no tasty juicy quality whatsoever bread wasn't liking either     The Nutella filled  puffs  hard rocks    We very disappointed maybe ordered wrong stuff but look way If basic hot dog didn't then don't think other ones don't care give place another try        <EOR> Nothing rave about  any other sausages polish sausages had  Nothing want jump one  <EOR> I loved hotdogs good tasty   full mayo ketup sourkaurt  hd veal dog  Yeah premium dog but sure good great would try again  <EOR> Uhhh   Wurstle Gourmet Hotdogs couldn't any Wurs!!  Good location good idea but bad execution   dogs bread entire product tastes generic store bought   Hillshire Farms tasting sausages week old grocery french bread couple strands saurkraut your traditional condiments all @ fat $5 bill some change!!??  worth net worth!  If opportunity give two cents would say Grill your dogs offer more unique sauces condiments flavors combinations keep fresh!    before chain Puka Dogs come take your place   look up! <EOR> I few weeks ago walking through Town Square  very similar place Hawaii does same thing except larger selection dogs sauces   dogs pretty plain limited selection sauces  think if larger selection sauces dipping method would better  just ketchup mustard all sank bottom don't any sauce flavor until end  <EOR> When first saw stand Premium Outlet Stores wanted give try but didn't because wasn't hungry time   something vaguely familiar having hot dog inserted vertically seen before figured later     version Puka Dog Hawaii!  http www yelp com biz_photos noLHDbJHyyHS8UJO4ONQTA?select=zK8gXmeVknX0anqDA06sgw  So wondering did Puka Dog rip off Wurstle did Wurstle rip off concept Puka Dog?  tend believe probably Wurstle most likely ripped off Puka Dog mainly because Puka Dog around quite few years judging Yelp reviews fact showcased Travel Channel few years ago   With said Living Social coupon came Town Square location   Although enjoy going Town Square much love getting pelvic exam due high amount trendy douche bags frequent decided embark quest quickly run over pick sandwiches try   To say hot dogs pretty bland understatement   While bread little better your average bun hot dog itself nothing special   sadly only offered yellow mustard ketchup sauce condiments   market yourself gourmet sausage company some sort gourmet high quality mustard seems cardinal sin me   really loves ketchup hot dogs other little kid?   Wurstle really needs step try use some better quality hot dogs condiments prices charge   While living social deal made cheap can't imagine ever going again pay full price especially when run down street most casinos like South Point offer better quality dog better toppings less dollar  <EOR> On paper Wurstle Gourmet Sausages interesting hot dog sausage concept but business called evolution hot dog poorly executed   idea novel other versions exactly mirrors offering Puka Dog mentioned few other reviewers sausage hot dog baked into freshly made bread dough the kind may see many Taiwanese bakeries    The location good very convenient shoppers especially if younglings toll when hunger strikes   Which main reason decided give them try   Uhh no don't kids babysitting time   Anyway    Getting back track menu pictures help customers ordering decision effective   If see order even if can't read speak English   totally appreciate picture menus   Just point magic pointed usually   So offer selection 6 sausages not counting Breakfast Minis 2 kid sizes flavors lower price choice 3 bread options 4 toppings crammed down hole made bread   Price tag $5 69 pre tax   Besides main attractions also desserts Nutella filled Puffs Mini Cupcakes fries chips some beverages   If vegetarian vegetarian option asparagus onions spicy ketchup relish mayo mustard    The sausages alone decent least flavors tried   But would call gourmet any means   called toppings very pedestrian well   Even Costco Food Courts offer same flavor enhancers self serve stations   only gourmet anything comes Vegetarian Dog if considered spicy ketchup mayo mustard gourmet   breads generic options Quiznos without toasting conveyer belt system   For charging don't really think going score high marks anybody's value price ratio  Without any more interesting unique sauces condiments arsenal urge return try something else yet try very low   Since Disneyland considering many better options superior values other venues within walking distance pretty much figure why no long lines here   On bright side only employee working time when very courteous friendly did best hold down fort singlehandedly   Review #8 2014 <EOR>
