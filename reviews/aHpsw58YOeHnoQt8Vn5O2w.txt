 suggested sign entrance would helpful especially if no podium   lady just gave sort irritated look didn't say anything     After straightened finally food   food just remember delicious!  wrap not Granny well seasoned flavorful   Everyone liked food but time ordered started eating over hour half   only starving but pressed time   While food good rushed eat back work   feel food sullied bad service     As Pyramid Room essentially giant cafeteria   nice but kind felt high school again   But there's also beautiful outdoor amphitheater center building benches grass   seems nice place lunch spring fall   My tip enter cafe Pyramid Room you'll hit cash registers first and therefore likely avert issue had    Espresso King really do   weekly lunch specials http bepnv com site php?ben_site=7 reasonably priced   probably try more time   it's just disappointed especially when recommended others   holding hope caught them bad day  <EOR> This inside government building far back wing    It's decent little deli premade salads premade pizza sold slice or order whole one sandwhiches stuff fridges    They also offer hot made order service here  odd confusing part which also creates some congestion and some general frustration those can't read signs enter see menu posted wall then walk past deli counter registers in narrow hallway leaving room place your order pay meal then backtrack through line wait your order   There posters indicating need place your order register but people don't read them can't see them through crowd people waiting lunch counter    There register next menu when walk would recommend using during lunch hours rushes streamline process people pay meals receive them ready leave order chicken tenders fries  Once order your order printed next prep station  bit chaos trying rush orders through keep line minimum but happening way  waited quite long time pretty simple order  point where saw order sitting baskets ready served but fries taken another order which placed minimum 5 minutes order I know because she people doesn't read signs     So aside chaos comes during lunch hour place pretty decent deli snack area  chicken fries large portions but chicken tenders weren't taste  little firm breaded  Maybe next time try hot sandwhiches something    Willing back just know expect wait time  <EOR> To start Espresso King Kafe Clark County Goverment Center exactly easy find   back outdoor ampitheatre pyramid building   con place   other set up   Painted above end cafe sign reads Enter  Yet precisely area order at   fact other side enter see menu at   confusing   least me   relative new comer establishment   I only couple times 2 ordered same thing both times   BLT   love thick cut bacon use   crispy   chewy   bacon   toasted sour dough bread as if another way    comes tomato lettuce as implied name    $7 99 your sandwich bag chips small drink   might some cheaper options lunch but guaranteed fresh something different   big mark pros column me   am tired same ol' fast food places around work   Espresso King welcome break every day norm   Another pro initial impression some good looking pizza including spaghetti pizza   only other place heard serving Frankenstine deliciosity Aces Ales   Sadly tried place   Yet  <EOR> As many note located Clark Count Government building way toward back   If middle building follow signs dining   I breakfast sausage cheddar egg toasted everything bagel breakfast potatoes   sandwich large egg least half it   sausage nice thick country sausage   But bagel lacked garlic onion flavor everything bagel typically has   just average maybe below given everything bagel supposed those flavors   The breakfast potatoes likewise disappointment   TON them filled large styrofoam container   But no seasoning them   served onions peppers but needed more   85% potato     Also meal small fountain drink $11    high opinion but understand probably pay good amount rent only place food center should expect pay more would same meal stand alone restaurant   The service very friendly probably eat again next time government center   But think order something else  <EOR>
