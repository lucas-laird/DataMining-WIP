I am very disappointed walked into dennys order multiple other orders wanted grits side! says right menu section sides  grits   False advertising  Everything supposed served all day if want stop serving certain time should labeled menu  Also instant none come any conclusion why couldn't very large side order INSTANT grits  midnight everyone standing around doing nothing can't thing instant grits  I just don't understand ?????they also forgot bacon!!! forgets bacon?!?!?! <EOR> Terrible service waited 45 minutes still served Called mgr  duty actually agreed me  <EOR> horrific customer service  mom seated dirty table then waiter ran off  then some other guy asked drinks he wasn't even uniform  also lady dressed sloppy casual lounging clothes serving people  took original server forever come back ask order  there's barely anyone working here  unprofessional customer service horrible  never back place  save your money but food good <EOR> Update server's name Leah   She's horrible employee still terrible human being  friends town wanted eat last night reluctantly did so  However gave shot  Mind when picked order another server gave me  specifically asked certain condiments bag  Once arriving bingo NONE bag  sent mother retrieve them angry irritated myself 20 minute she finally returned said claimed condiments bag  Smh no did Fast forward Saturday night seated miss attitude attitude near kitchen  NOW if you're going talk customer rest staff customer seat customer near kitchen moron  Once waitress came 15 minute wait time she proceeded argue friend she put condiments bag must lost way bingo finally she told she wrong she wasn't even speaking right person  All while having attitude herself toward friend never before she wanted argue  Finally told needed more time decide decided leave once heard waitress walk back kitchen say something friend Leah bot started screaming laughing HOOTIN HOLLERIN morons    When waitress came expressed distaste attitude treatment said would take business elsewhere  She graciously gave name Leah's name FINALLY managers name made clear would making formal complaint today which did    Stephanie amazing help look forward hearing Jennifer general manager when she reads report  am disgusted ignorant ridiculous behavior  When someone EMPLOYEE restaurant puts hand your face exclaims ain't no time yo ass  plain rude excuse but ghetto however there's no shocker her     I've attitude disrespect sure hope she's back place being if job still when manager gets wind guess corporate next move  far done people need learn respect others    Especially if you're employee establishment  If child still job then would send worse enemy restaurant     even if someone paid to  <EOR> It's Denny's low budget neighborhood    Service wasn't bad don't think would come back particular location but overall tmy waitress good  <EOR> It's located casino walk through wall smoke it     negative book   waiter good   wait time average food   Food warm temperature could hotter   environment very loud very busy   wouldn't again unless couldn't find anything else  <EOR> Slowest most terrible service received long time  almost walked out  Never coming again <EOR> Kind happy place but some things it    At first being greeted being seated okay  usual greet seat routine any other Denny's there  wasn't busy all but fact took them long things rolling kind boggles me  three other staff standing around doing nothing while poor waitress running around trying things done  Now really don't blame waitress cause least she nice  But others just standing around making all work kind rude  course  review poor review  But give credit where credit due    I know Denny's certain sections wait staff cover  applaud waitress taking busiest trying sure everyone happy  While see another section booth set family while waitress 6 other booth cover  Now would nice share responsibilities then see other waitress snooty stare waitress while she's all over place  Even though when waitress break other waitress wouldn't even check see doing  she's only allowed cover booth section where there's 6 other booth doesn't waitress  kind place does where no cover section when its some ones break time but three others uniform  manager ever lady just stand other snooty waitress talk behind waitress back she's doing  say if want job done right then yourself cause right now unhappy customers wait staff isn't backing any ones section  way run business    As far food did Zesty nachos did Super Bird sandwich  But didn't fact weren't cooking something menu cause tend it  Some should said something inform waitress instead making come back another order still didn't have  third time around she came back saying didn't wife wants second Super Bird  right tells there's lack communication between cook waitress  fact cook did inform waitress cannot cooks fault  Then talk head manager ever waitress look bad front everyone totally uncalled for  If staff complaint another staff take where no else could see your upset face hand gestures     Now again applaud waitress doing more then she did day covered she covered  blame other staff lack help lack support lack communication  Knowing other section only booth cover while waitress 6 unappropriate    With being said waitstaff being snooty cook having lack communication skills cannot do  wouldn't really come back eat again if treat staff way treated waitress   Very unprofessional part  <EOR> Marginal experience  Food very good  Wait time order slow appears understaffed front door man also seating people getting items back room taking orders bussing tables checking customers  Steak undercooked biscuits bland etc  Overall surprised because Denny's but still little disappointed  <EOR> I'm reviewing Denny's inside Fiesta only based $1 99 special advertised  Just ask the breakfast special you'll two eggs sausage bacon small stack two pancakes  special need order beverage but  only catch!  Food came fast  Service wasn't bad  overeasy eggs overeasy Cholula hot sauce  more ask for?  Their breakfast special available any time day specific Denny's  Now ignorance ridden no longer order side pancakes $2 when everything else comes decent hearty American breakfast! <EOR> This place most stupidest unprofessional Denny's ever been! son standing 20 minutes all workers just passing ignoring us! There's only few people inside eating employee just starring us  couple times same assuming things change  owned own business someone running business ridiculous  location!!! <EOR> This place pretty basic eating your casino cafe dining   prefer Coco's across street Texas Station only because least know won't ignored   staff usually friendly see try really hard most your meal even if order off 2 4 6 8 menu   never feel judge even when order real cheepo     The last time ordered something all fine until server said no longer item   Okay order something else heavily modified because lack ingredients   Again few minutes later she comes back says also that  It holiday themed meal holiday season now little miffed  order same thing husband ordered really knowing what's only knowing turkey  want     The food comes little spurts because now cook really confused says server   split first sandwich time second comes done   just greasy me   Later waiting while check just pay seeing if could print check front   able but wrong still having first ordered it   hostess begins fix time server comes proceed into argument because mix server doesn't want charge all hostess just going let fly     didn't  care way nice server try but wasn't completely void meal   Still eighteen dollars two sandwiches seems steep especially Denny's no less   okay trip little off but better before probably back  <EOR> I don't know give Denny's anything less four stars  un American so    It's really just Denny's inside Fiesta! take all pro's going Denny's low prices ok food no wait then add fact within walking distance place sells $1 margaritas recipe success  Epic win    My last visit quick stop grab some food epic craving greasy delicious hot food  Denny's right popped in  wait wasn't long food quickly happy  Plus only spent $9 happy too! <EOR> This Denny's inside Fiesta Casino   When 10 31 11 lunch wait long seated long server much long pay check   food nasty maybe just fit dog server gave wrong check   When mentioned issues Manager breath bad she agreed comment she understaffed asked complain office which did even answer phone     What find amazing when patronizing another Denny's year ago similar problems occurred   What else could gone wrong?  My question chain survive where find employees?  After two unpleasant experiences never again! <EOR> The food cold but discounted check 25% Kathy waitress adorable aa great server  <EOR> Oddly quite place! Best place good cup coffee 2am <EOR> This far worst Denny's life  Now should expect low quality just based off location which inside most ghetto casinos Las Vegas  But ghetto aside customer expect certain level quality even considering its Denny's  ordered chicken avocado Caesar salad cup bold coffee  Now she fresh pot bold instead serving waitress brought coffee wrong table said made special bold blend just you  She passed didn't think twice multiple times  no more 5 total tables place workers literally act just appeared air never spoke before  Everyone walks around new management needs train people attempt look customers needs while paying attention empty glasses basic things  Overall wouldn't give place second try all employees need lose jobs  <EOR> This Denny's service very slow busy  food mediocre did finish because full but wasting time   eat Denny's again but one  <EOR>
