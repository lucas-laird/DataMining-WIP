When saw waiter expressed situation   He apologized offered free dessert   Free dessert? really? ordered $70 steak ruined bad could eat want free dessert? I assumed when check came would charged item   But bill   call waiter back over ask why would charge item ruined couldn't didn't eat   He left manager   manager did take off bill but only repeat entire story   Didn't server explain situation?  Very unprofessional service   bill still $150 without prime rib   left hungry back hotel ordered room service  The saddest part whole time table next ordered prime rib   looked delicious gentleman enjoying much made feel even worse   even pointed waiter said ordered expected  He never even offered bring new meal   never want back place again  <EOR> The best steak years! potatoes gratin pretty good too  service very polite prompt  Moscow Mule perfect  Great place <EOR> Came during CES place great ambiance conveniently located Caesars Palace  Service fantastic server great  Seafood Tower though pricey think actually pretty good deal compared rest seafood menu  Presentation great  All very fresh very tasty  personal favorite king crab legs  Thick Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon would've never ordered own but said delicious  Big plate bite sized thick cut bacon  Ribeye 'Gotham' don't usually see ribeyes bone  came little more rare asked but still delicious and usually huge steak fan   Sides Mac four cheese great Brussels sprouts meh better roasted mushrooms great gnocchi truffle butter pretty good   Duck fat fries flavor pretty light hint duck fat  Desserts bread pudding amazing! almost banana foster sitting syrup cast iron cookie like pizookie ice cream fresh baked cookie okay creme brulee good standard no spin   <EOR> Sigh   sad wasted few precious Vegas dinners place    I don't even know say   just all around terrible  only came because everywhere else full needed stay around Caesars quick scurry Pure dinner    Lighting really dark guess if you're drunk enough your beer goggles already need somewhere take your date she looks better realized morning    place   Everything super super expensive   know Vegas but cmon no name no famous chef 3 yelp star place    worth $66 sirloin even $58 8oz Filet!
