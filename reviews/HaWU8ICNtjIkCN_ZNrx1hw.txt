Ever since heard uniquely themed café very excited visit wanted take tons pictures mural covers half coffee shop  We right when opened first ones there  Walking little taken away art super excited try signature coffees  extra excited hands huge macaroons $6 each   decaf salted caramel Frappuccino mom gotten decaf salted caramel iced uncle java chip Frappuccino   We decided sit back super comfy couches loved idea games could choose along tons books magazines suit your fancy  admired iridescent lights highlighted neat mural also added affect your mood made feel relaxed Got many times take pictures workers totally okay very friendly  So now onto coffee loving decoration coffee nice tall 24 Oz glass cool gold silver sugar balls top plus very generous whipped cream But pretty much coffee wise wasn't super duper impressed ok thought would wowed taste salted caramel    but wasn't neither mom  didn't taste distinctly SALTED CARAMEL but good strong coffee mine seemed little better flavor wise towards end   But just little disappointed no caramel drizzled top no salt topped anywhere drink  Although uncle did love java chip Frappuccino he couldn't enough   Needless say know good coffee drinks but happened mine ?   took while connect free Wi Fi  kind where all down hill    mom uncle connected Wi Fi while but then no longer connection only five other men coffee shop having business meeting   tried connecting Wi Fi phone laptop wouldn't work all  asked if anything wrong Wi Fi? worker told sometimes slows down kicks off if lot people internet  She also said probably because those 5 people having business meeting  biggest disappointment because coffee shop relax take atmosphere while embracing free Wi Fi ! Plus first people booted off Wi Fi     right   Also walking nice selection alternative music but then switched more mainstream pop which okay   but then cut entirely   don't know if because Wi Fi situation  But pretty much us  pretty discouraged point left   planning getting another coffee possibly getting little sandwich hanging lot longer  But now no Wi Fi music turned off only thing could hear loud business men  I gave place three stars because limited Wi Fi plus music situation disappointing coffee experience  Don't wrong love atmosphere could've spent all day but Wi Fi situation downer coffee could better experience  would definitely love come again give them place business but only if Wi Fi situation fixed PLEASE FIXED <EOR> It first time Illumilatte past Saturday friend because recommendation   friend looking late night place study productive   arrived around 8ish so  time place wasn't crowded   put stuff down round table front claim seats because seats back taken group people  Seemed place be   We counter look menu immediately tea service caught eye   telling Lotus barista working night thinking getting tea service asked flavor she suggested   She suggested employees called the Kelsey named barista combined Red Fruit Peach flavors   decided trust along it   BEST DECISION MADE ALL DAY! good amount refill perfect visit there   Lotus made sure well taken care during whole time there   really appreciated it  She knows sure she customers coming back Illumilatte!  A few side thoughts bathroom very creatively decorated  am sure if people care but interesting look while doing business there  long table back very useful group meetings but chairs seat really low but really comfy   sure if comfy ness outweighs super low chairs but its non issue me  guess Friday Saturday nights hookah lounge next door poppin'  Its really annoying when ambiance coffee shop supposed chill  clientele  hookah lounge brought some weird people   example two males reeked ganja   impressed  But hey that?  Honestly place itself probably 4 stars its own   But customer service experienced Lotus pushes 5 stars  Thank Lotus! We'll back  <EOR> I liked real chill played checkers but said ran Matcha  How? <EOR> Got cashew milk matcha latte delicious well priced but everything else sub par  couple scattered day old pastries display which microwaved when ordered  music low could hear everyone's conversations  wall art seating okay but hard comfortable when felt everyone listening you  service okay polite enough if disinterested but don't expect anything amazing coffee shop necessarily just accuracy  concept cool but name just feels bit gimmick since actual food wasn't very stellar  <EOR> Don't come if you're any sort hurry limited time any way  Just waited 20 minutes two iced coffees  Only employee ever working time don't seem hurry any sense urgency your food drinks any timely manner  Coffee good food okay  Good place study grab your morning coffee before work you'll definitely run late  <EOR> First time Conglomerate 4 berry blend smoothie flavorful! Very refreshing when dealing LV heat place really awesome decor great service ! <EOR> Illumilatte hipster version Friends cafe  cafe gives off very relaxed feel cozy couches back chess set ups spread across tables  bounty outlets which definitely plus when need good study spot  serve coffees tea frappes food snacks if need quick pick me place be! Music spot on  Wifi fast  Baristas friendly  Highly recommended!  The London Fog earl grey latte  latte tasted bit bland taste  did subtle hint earl grey tasted more creamy tea did latte  Maybe next time add extra shot espresso taste more coffee  <EOR> Loved ambiance cafe service great  Love love love grilled cheese sandwich must try anyone going  Also strawberry banana smoothie Java truffle frappe  <EOR> The atmosphere nice all but drink disgusting  CREAM frap way sweet  usually love sweets! But just gross super disappointed  service okay guess kind rude  think most people come aesthetics which admittedly pretty cool unique  huge fan drinks service though  <EOR> When illumilatte first opened absolutely loved it  would come 1 2 times week pretty consistently would post photos social media pages 10% 20% off whatever promotion forget since long   stopped going because would terrible headaches lights constantly changing don't really notice but mess your eyes  Headaches definitely way study stopped going  maybe year ago maybe less really cannot remember just know when still new establishment    Now let's just today 1 23 17 busy when sister in law came some studying  both ordered drink food item  food took while come really did notice until girl working apologized told next drink sweet! almost three hours  Some complaints wifi disconnected hour every hour which fine because understand bandwidth all jazz did bother much but when zone music stops little bothersome  But issue completely understand won't even take into consideration three star review   My main complaint customer service  staff overall friendly but just rubbed wrong way once twice but THREE times  First time when asked some water girl working just looked water thing right there? if knew water offered right think would asked? know she didn't mean come off rude but did come off rude instead she should've mentioned water self serve located next registers instead asking if empty because don't know if did would've said something being empty  next time used restroom no paper towels washed hands noticed no paper towels walked over registers asked paper towel let them know restroom instead offering paper towel she said sorry fix now ask paper towel twice dry hands  Again big deal just already asked she ignored wanted straight bathroom refill it  last weird encounter tonight big reason writing review  Please let start off saying used really place spent good chunk money when first open just stopped going because lights affected me  remember mentioned earlier getting drink house? Before leaving walked register ordered small drip coffee and note ordering SAME girl offered free drink she told owed $2 something  did mention anything free drink she offered two three hours ago just paid way  No reason complain over less $3 but still principle  Why offer free drink when redeem still end pay it?   Long story short came weird service multiple times offered free drink yet still pay said free drink   <EOR> I love coffee place much  staff very kind feel comfortable spending all day getting stuff done  prices decent but sandwiches bit better  only real complaint  art amazing person behind playlist definitely deserves some praise  never loud furniture set comfortable  Employees genuinely seem happy see regulars  Most importantly many outlets! <EOR> The chai latte tastes water service fake splash attitude  heck man? completely dissatisfied quality drinks level service here  waste since concept Illuminlatte Brew Society killer   We ordered large iced chai latte and asked if could made extra spicy cashier explained definitely spicy since use strong masala spice chai  When tried chai immediately confused since tasted water   After explained cashier barista owner chai watery owner said she would remake it  Shockingly second batch just watery first round  other 2 party said just forget cut losses leave drink head another coffee spot  conscience struggled told party think would fair give them last shot  know third times charm?  Man regret saying that!!! kindly explained barista owner second time chai probably thinking canceling chai all together try signature drinks Java Truffle Frappe  When owner told full price drink said would happy pay difference wrong step  She then said frustration know me  topped extra insincere tone impatient body language   Let's just say last signature drink ok  great but would suffice  even nudged friend buy drink since he hesitant  also way walk counter thank owner know she continued fed charades rolled eyes nodded head back towards us   Really!? don't think see your attitude coming through loud clear? Might well just kick slam door face while you're it  incredibly passive aggressive experience  disbelief someone trying build business carry them much attitude  very immature reaction constructive criticism product   While waiting outside our friend drink made drink started melt quickly all tasted sugar serious sugar bomb  5 sips into made feel sick  tastebuds coated sugar tossed it  balanced coffee drink cashier explained extremely sweet dessert drink no trace coffee   My friend took few sips blended drink tossed well  drink overwhelmed whipped cream filler did nothing him  He also noted barista lot learn deal adding extra shot expresso into cold blended drink techniques need work   After failed attempt give them fair last chance finally understood won't win way here  whole party burned else but owner  would never recommend anyone receive attitude mediocre drinks did today  Tread lightly   P S  cashier received nice tip friend she innocent bystander  <EOR> Loved ambiance  friends stayed awhile   My mac but frappe delish My chicken pesto panini bad  chicken little dry <EOR> This bear very little brain needed some local coffee came here   coffee good ambiance perfect hanging gang furry friends   + + + <EOR> I am writing review merely based experience morning two other times afternoon gentleman counter incredible very accommodating  mean cup coffee    So morning am suuuuper excited bring mom first time its SUPER dead woman counter Ive never seen before express excitement explain new favorite coffee place order two cold brews heavy whip   which of    okay thats okay   she seemed irritated bummed heavy whip which weird  also ordered two turkish double shots which excited before else where  Hence excitement So black cold brews come     along turkish coffee    turkish coffee smelled tasted rust tap water  way placed coffee couldnt drink counter when she asked if didnt kindly said no tasted odd   am never rude anyone unless provoked   instead demonstrating good customer service she told  other people annoyed even voicing opinion    if starbucks would made something else    jus saying  Very disappointed lack customer service skills      I only back see gentleman afternoon!!

When ordering take notice coffee selections offered most caffeinated beverages made stronger average corporate chain brew  Definitely ask brew master behind counter before carelessly ordering drinks could awake next couple days    I ordered iced vanilla latte espresso  Yowza drink strong glad vanilla option otherwise would very bitey cup joe  Beyond first initial sip coffee actually smoothed drank taste buds simply surrendered  espresso slightly bitter surprisingly smooth seeing trend here? eventually mixed two together lapped remaining liquid thirsty coffee feigning K 9   I ordered Turkey Pesto Panini Sriracha  took quite long time made fifteen minutes exact but chalk working new shop kinks   sandwich good bread lacked good panini crunch pesto flavor could more abundant but overall wasn't bad  might try something else next time    Oh next time!   I love name place  Freemasons Illuminati intrigue anything else triggers coffee fueled paranoia    Did land moon? Nope heard sound stage New Mexico  PRO TIP Check in Yelp discounted treats also ask secret menu items! <EOR> Lemon Illumilatte macaroons just ok  cinnamon  rolls more muffin worth it   Unfortunately coffee very bitter prepared ordered  decor bright spot  <EOR> Cappuccino iced single Origin pour over subpar  wouldn't recommend place coffee purists  If love Starbucks probably your kind joint  1 star ambience  it  <EOR> Such cool clever name must say!

There's lot plugs computers charging phone prepare comfortable  courtesy purchase drink!   The iced latte similar would Starbucks  delicious but memorable enough crave again  hot latte girlfriend also delicious but wasn't fan its presentation  foam bit lighter side which typical latte used seeing  could hardly see design incorporated it    The rep behind counter interesting employee  couldn't tell if she hated help she indifferent working there  though she gave recommendations because job or    she wanted help  demeanor rather confusing  <EOR>
