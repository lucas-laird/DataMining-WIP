Very attentive visit again! Live music great! <EOR> My friend came across Mickie Finnz Fish House searching down Fremont St  Italian eatery saw advertised night before   Since tired lot walking hungry say least decided hit up   Needless say experience flat out BAD   hostess lets decide where sit waitress would way 1 3 capacity full still took little over 10 minutes reach table table seated outside only 2 other cpls groups being waited on  If  your policy business damn sure better your shit service case   Usually 3 strike rule should apply but some reason ended giving more deserved   She finally gets asks drinks   STRIKE 1 wanted house margarita rather ask rocks blended she jotts down proceeds back bar   Fucker   She comes back another 10 minutes later drinks noted table 15 feet away outside walk bar but luckily drink wanted first place   Still all took way long happen which shoulda sign just drink eat somewhere else     bad choice   So order food split between Shrimp Bucket [sided fries] Mahi Mahi [sided w vegs] cpl minutes decide walk around little look map area   we're approaching back table waitress helping another family near entrance reinterates order more time making sure she didn't wrong   there's anything wrong getting right but isn't why write orders down?  STRIKE 2 food comes but yet given silverware nor plates any kind   First shrimp bucket clearly misleading approx  8 grilled er should say BURNED shrimp skewers bucket  10 high filled fries    yes more FRIES Bucket [sided w Burnt Shrimp]  shoulda said else would've never ordered it!  Mahi Mahi?
