Chicken teriyaki    dry liking   but I'd give place another try!   Btw matcha green tea boba must try! <EOR> I really change light spot   terms vegas pricing spot very affordable  Ramen puts $8 $9 versus $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!  Please negate previous reviewer commenting plastic cup  Any shops Grand Bazaar going inclined towards tourist someone else quickly passing through   no sense serve ramen big ceramic bowl  Why use reusables bother re cleaning when most people come pit stop continue on? Silverware more ideal if offered full dinner service someone truly meant sit dine hour  don't even think half shops connected water line sink   There eating area but offers very little seating only well suited 2's 4   But come on  wouldn't come dinner  group   healthier Asian on the go    But food pretty good! flavorful  hit spot  Well balanced  Noodles cooked well  pork cooked well  also seaweed salad which good melon soda  Altogether meal $18   Next time vegas I'd definitely hit place again if staying Paris Bally's  Ideal lunch quick bite  sushi looked pretty good too  priced $6 roll also pretty reasonable  <EOR> Food + price + service + location easy sell  rice dishes  only thibg lacking food could more spicy  <EOR> Came Saturday morning right opened  greeted friendly cashier took order yelled behind prepare  Its VERY small establishment only couple bar tables small side area if want eat there    4 stars fact spicy ramen delicious would expect vendor shopping mall decent price  Keep mind don't eat whole lot ramen am probably easily pleased if ramen connoisseur take review grain salt  thought noodles perfectly cooked watched them add fresh ingredients end little soggy time room but still delicious   Yes its served plastic container take but did offer bowl if wanted dine in    Overall pleased return during next adventure Vegas  <EOR> Excellent ramen !  Karaage honestly favorite part shoyu ramen disappointed don't level delicious ramen where live   Definitely affordable kind hidden little cramped inside   food well worth though! <EOR> This restaurant those little gems takes surprise!  located down alley area infront Paris   first sight really nothing special except lanterns outside   also nothing spectacular inside looked small restaurant very limited seating   decorated inside Japanese lanterns art small tables   The server hostess very nice took directly table back which little more private although tight   She took order drinks within couple minutes back ready take order   asked couple questions she made some ramen suggestions   wasn't long all enjoying ramen   The ramen absolutely delicious!  depth richness broth want keep eating non stop which did   Spicy normal Tonkotsu ramen both pork   admit pleasantly surprised very impressed!  didn't expect ramen good BRAVO!

Wasn't paid food advertise?  There another yelp page under ramen ya 1 2 stars  should correct help yelp because place suck!!   SAVE YOUR MONEY <EOR> I read reviews before tried place  Honestly we're pleasantly surprised  soup karaage overly salty many reviews stated  Prices very reasonable considering prices Vegas  Also karaage pretty good  gave 4 stars because think overall pretty good considering where is  Vegas strip is not where you go eat great ramen can't find anything  good strip and not $9 95   Also some reviewers complained the karaage crispy ask side simple fix   found batter just rigtand taste very good overly salty  Could good day but definitely worth 4 stars hit spot craving  give them try keep mind going eating ramen any major metropolitan area but tastes so good when tired Vegas food! <EOR> Amazing ramen place  Loved spicy ramen fried chicken thigh appetizer  Very satisfying  Quite inexpensive too  <EOR> Solid Ramen escpically Vegas  Great hangover food kinda werid location temp strip mall front Bally's casino  you would miss if look hard it  <EOR> The menu small prices lot higher expected when compared other places along Strip  food good but more less other places  location extremely small limited size  <EOR> We decided eat because hungry wait hour Walburgers  service quick staff really nice  ramen pretty good  broth flavorful mine fried chicken which nicely seasoned added good taste overall dish  size bowl ok price but Vegas expected pay more then if off strip  <EOR> We looking spot grab quick bite before going dayclub came across Ramen Ya Katana while walking through Grand Bazaar  Ramen didn't sound best option sweaty day Vegas but turns sushi burritos!   There many places sit down if wanted dine in  restaurant narrow fit two counters sit some small tables  course always take your order but don't know well would over ramen    I SAPPORO $9 77 which contains salmon shrimp tempura imitation crab avocado lettuce  came pretty quickly felt 10 minutes less  However all surprised when sushi burrito came wrapped tortilla instead nori  never seen sushi burrito made while tortilla thin didn't take away much sushi wish would known  asked later if sub nori instead tortilla said could but option made known while ordering!   Overall tasted alright but nothing special  definitely very full price good portion given   I think good choice some economical Japanese eats while Strip but nothing special  signs inside say Michelin recommendation I'd really know backstory behind that   Food 3 5 Service 4 Environment 2 Price 4 <EOR> The noodles good  liked miso soup broth but texture noodles all  couldn't eat because felt similar uncooked noodles  <EOR> Fantastic beef donburi   Tasted exactly beef bowl Japan   Definitely more expensive beef bowl Japan around $6 equivalent Japan   $12 but amazing price Vegas!  Great service friendly waiters   seemed surprised use Japanese return basic greetings thank you's   If could convince group eat every day trip would  <EOR> ?????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? <EOR> Good but great    Pros Dining atmosphere wonderful  Small spot truly feels ramen shop    Sake Mango selection delicious  Broth Flavorful delicious good amount spice  Cons The Chasu pork could lot more tender  Noodles tougher chewy side   Boiled egg really needs soft boiled egg  <EOR> So why does place charge 16% being seated served normal table normal restaurant?    why tell until bill?   Pros Ramen okay but atleast comes very fast here  Seaweed salad good Traditional Japanese greeting good bye sayings Nice staff   Cons Did read first sentence? No bathrooms Very small space Location bit hard find Price worth it Told being seated back protect pretty ladies     say what <EOR> Delicious thoroughly enjoyed  No sushi  Highly recommended  Looks run Japanese  <EOR> Excellent  Really surprised ramen noodles could good  Definitely worth checking out  <EOR> I'm rating star again just hoping give restaurant fair rate  When big family 11 people eating taking all tables which fine cuz actually leaving mins but woman mentioned told no table unless took Togo  confused thinking somebody else made reservation but fact NO  family left before placed orders  Bedsides bixth rolled eyes when told five us  Super disappointed unhappy meal   feel very bad when recall woman's face   <EOR> We surprised find Ramen shop strip while walking through Grand Bazaar shops outside Bally's  Normally if order ramen casino strip expect fork over 2x average amount   could sworn Monte Carlo place selling Monster Ramen $40!  commute local Chinatown look authentic flavors   The shop really tiny few counters stools back   wanted light snack ordered shared following Chicken Karaage basically fried chicken Japanese style   Four pieces $4 good crispiness good juicy tender meat decent seasoning     Miso Spicy Ramen $9 its bad chicken based broth spicy good way few pieces sliced pork juicy   added quite bit kakiage which tempura versions thinly sliced onions   Noodles chewy   Would good place quick cheap snack good if you're really craving ramen   Its pretty tiny limited seating but folks eat quickly leave   Sort In and Out Ramen! <EOR> I spicy miso noodles extra noodles  paid 17$ including 15% tip  drink included    now worth it?
