Indian restaurant no samosas?  Its peanut butter no jelly!   Turner no Hooch!   Ahh    let's move on   also ordered full dish Tandoori Chicken Chicken Tikka Masala curry    food comes relatively fast but same problem first reviewer curry no curry!  Normally complaint much sauce no meat   all meat onions peppers tiny bit curry   would OK but meat was    tough?    Tough over cooked meat?  can't even remember last time ever overcooked chicken restaurant   Maybe some backyard BBQ when forgot check 30 minutes but restaurant!  $15 dish!!  Dry tough chicken yuck   The full dish Tandoori Chicken $15 big   BIG barely fits serving plate    cool all but making mess just trying food off plate   Plus Tandoori DRY TOO!
