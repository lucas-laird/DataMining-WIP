It's second time restaurant great food very good service !! really Peking duck big shrimps lobsters crabs ! Usually Chinese food oily salty but ! back again !! <EOR> When Las Vegas restaurant must visit  Beautiful decor clean staffs friendly  menu offered many speciality dishes  fresh eel which didn't think would delicious  curry crab bomb  Just eating curry sauce steam rice already good  string bean fresh crunchy soggy most places   ordered wine meal   bill reasonable affordable  definitely come back again  <EOR> Excellent true Chinese food  Victor waiter paid great deal attention provided flawless service  <EOR> Great atmosphere way over priced! Poor quality meats ordered french filet mignon very fatty rough lack flavor black bean chicken although chicken breast full fat tendons lack flavor crispy chicken 1 2 best overall great flavor texture but very small portion especially $13  appears price worth cut meats more trimmings would discard but yet serve charge ridiculous amount it  <EOR> I excited when saw authentic Chinese restaurant opening sw side town close me  chance try Saturday aug 19th wasn't impressed   1 inside clean since building brand new  Nice decor  Typical Chinese stuff   2 food ok  order appetizer pig ears peanuts   Lacked flavor  Probably should've let marinated lot longer  Clams black bean sauce ok  Chinese broccoli salted fish  Broccoli over cooked  No crunch it  soft  Then fresh steam fish which good   Wish more scallions it   3 rice cost extra?? Since when charge bowl rice  Two order 4 dishes  usual Cantonese restaurant gives free house soup  place  No soup free rice = good  rather just drive Chinatown   4 wait staff your typical Cantonese restaurant  waitress took order didn't see again  Food came really spread apart  clams first  Then Marinade pig ears  15 min later fish  lastly when almost done dinner broccoli came out  <EOR> Very good restaurant  Peking duck awesome  2 rounds  salt pepper tofu also very good  Im still trying new dishes  far no disappointment! <EOR> Finally tasty Chinese restaurant local Las Vegas just eating Los Angeles  sell lots seafood which enjoy lot even lunch specials very affordable  definitely try next time  <EOR> Beautiful restaurant attentive customer service  seated pretty quickly during lunch time   liked fishball porridge beef stew noodle soup especially delicious  would recommend place friends family definitely come back  <EOR> Came lunch  It delicious!

Would liked rice little fat but  just personal preference  strangely enjoyed snacking crispy shallots lol  Two choice bbq combo roast duck bbq pork steamed celery plum sauce side  Roast duck seasoned just right salty all  Skin crispy meat moist! didn't any problem bone chips other restaurants good amount meat  thing bothered still some feathers skin definitely notice when contrasted darkness skin  pluck them off best could ate  But some people don't mind that  OMG bbq pork good! actually tender! None hard chewy crust tire your jaw  didn't expect much but blew mind lol much fat overly greasy either    Xiao long bao pork soup dumplings arrived steaming hot those cute ceramic ladle like soup spoons  Each dumpling rested slice carrot which assume help sticking spoon  tell handmade but skins thick  some soup inside but longer wait eat them more dough seemed suck soup especially because thickness skin  They're served julienned ginger black vinegar course YUM  still enjoyed them glad tried them  would probably still order them next time   Egg drop soup delicious! Ordered without veggies  Added touch white pepper perfect  Tons flowing silky egg consistency thick seasoned just right    Lunch specials come rice yet actually order rice during dinner time  Wish gave option small serving soup rather family size but I'd gladly take leftovers eat them home!  Price definitely right got  BF commented place par LA's authentic Chinese restaurants when comes quality taste food which he loves   Btw Fantastic service Asian restaurant kind thrown off lol  two servers female male attentive throughout meal  Waters refilled once ever empty finished dishes removed promptly he even packed leftovers to go personally  once did feel rushed ate  even checked back sure everything okay partway!

Try Peking duck lettuce wraps! <EOR> I Hainan chicken lunch special $10 delicious  only issue small order was  I'd back try other dishes   the Hainan chicken alone gave sense some quality Chinese food   I'd bump 5 stars if lunch special portions larger! <EOR> Walked Christmas party  place almost empty but lady said all other tables reserved  wanted usher private room but minimum order $500  There's no way party would ever order much food  asked if could just regular order declined patronage  coming back because lack understanding restaurant  <EOR> I French style filet mignon  don't specify but cooked medium rare end which am ok with  However some chunks basically inedible which $18 less satisfying sauce bit heavy such very little taste meat dish  similar but better incarnation dish Chicago  bad experience but particularly outstanding  positive enough two meals if you're particularly hungry  <EOR> We took chance place looking local Chinese glad did  Very delicious food! Legit Chinese ran place normal items would expect plus things didnt know were  orange chicken bomb dot com  Good quiet atmosphere too  <EOR> Wrong order third time take responsibility bad service rude never going back    Such Shame <EOR> For some reason thought fast food type Chinese restaurant when walked first time very surprised see full sit down restaurant! nicely decorated inside appreciate type Chinese restaurant opened side town saving drive Spring Mountain!   For food ordered Peking duck lettuce wraps beef chow fun egg drop soup fried tofu  When Peking duck came steam buns really cool see chef actually cutting crispy skin off duck  bf said he never eaten Peking duck where skin perfectly cut off meat    Everything else ordered really good I'd definitely want come back try other dishes such fried flounder fried rice maybe another noodle dish  However reason took off star because service pretty bad here  server took order never came back ask different server additional things  never came back check once even forget bring some things asked soy sauce  Then took forever boxes bill  <EOR> Ordered food Christmas Day 3lb lobster harbor style Peking pork chops Ribeye garlic sauce 1 2 roast duck Fu Zhou style fried rice Ong Choy sautéed w garlic  Food outstanding service fantastic  Man spoke phone very helpful food ready 20 min  also dined twice pleasant experience both times  Pricier rainbow kitchen but worth it! <EOR> Came try Taste new restaurant close by  Very clean well lit  food very authentic  Westlake Beef soup delicious  Xialong bao very good but very much juice inside  Seafood tofu also good  Service great water empty while before anyone thought refilling them  Saltfish hash little salty but still good  Also seafood noodle dish chinese broccoli which also very good  felt meal little over priced but overall very good  Especially since didn't drive Chinatown  try again  <EOR>
