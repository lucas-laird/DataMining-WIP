Hobak A18  Try out! owner super kind! <EOR> It's nice concept far being first AYCE seafood heard far Vegas  far execution food definitely give effort  atmosphere place pretty unique  far food when seafood deep flavor it  Different renditions type restaurant boiling crab hot n juicy I'd rather there  crawfish tasted extra fishy fresh  Coming probably good visit  better Cajun creole seafood  BOGO soju beer which plus! service decent beginning fell off   we only ones restaurant yet saw server sporadically during whole dining experience  Given only group restaurant took almost forever everything come out  heard same owners Hwaro girl served given also The Shit menu   with better expectations food service  <EOR> Okay place MULTIPLE TIMES!  point call regular bc all waitstaff recognize me   honest kind client want come regularly every time come bring new people never bc point talked highly place spread word place gospel anyone wants unique experience good seafood   point came 3 times 2 week period bc chose place bring town friends celebrate birthday just enjoy myself family   With said say organization attentiveness waitstaff WORST!  kept writing off maybe they're understaffed maybe they're super busy maybe just hired new people they're training but many times recognize all waiters point no new pass whole newbie still learning ropes pass     The problem isn't aren't nice problem ALWAYS disappear hide   AYCE sorry   but AYCE ESPECIALLY ones order table wait come staff needs find system involves constantly clearing dirty plates piles seafood shells off table filling drinks taking new orders efficiently swiftly   FAIL big time isn't first time REPEAT offenders   Seafood shells trash build fast no shows clear off your table mountain shit front you     The biggest MYSTERY all LOOOOONG takes rice  !!!!!!!!!!  literally EVERYTHING comes BEFORE fucking rice!!  perplexing    like long does take scoop rice into bowl??  Every  Single  Time rice takes exorbitant amount time ALWAYS ask twice sometimes staff!!???  ANNOYING! cook rice order? If  stupid!  would sense if American style restaurant generally known rice hand but ASIAN themed seafood joint mostly ASIAN clientele CHINATOWN God's sake!   In experience Asian guy waiters more accommodating female waiters don't know why   starting think asian guys work more invested owners? managers? Family owners?  don't know   they just seem little bit more apologetic when complain girls look don't give shit just trying pick side check could give shit review says tbh   also wondering if just bartenders asked wait   Bc girls especially love run back disappear behind empty bar phones all while unorganized mess happening around corner   But guys love hide when show complain something give whole oh God sorry let drink wait    way overly nice bit condescending and or secretly corrupting your food back  Trust know tone   I work customer service am VERY FAMILIAR tone first you're ok least apologized but then nothing fixed all same issues keeping coming up!  if think apologizing slightly annoying tone fixes all problems place     With all said ONLY thing keeps coming back value food get   food consistent but service strategy needs revamped   Maybe should restaurant similar food service style Umiya Sushi Flamingo   place well oiled machine   move fast water filled before glass even half way full   Whoever training them needs some consulting place   Final word   may may back   it really depends badly craving late night seafood binge  But past few time service lackluster leaving bad taste mouth when leave     BONUS TIP!!  If want prevent them ignoring hiding find sitting around bar upfront best place sit bc easily see them wave them down ask something sit right side restaurant windows bc cul de sac you're completely hidden view when retreat ordering window bar   think  Ive done wrong last few times sit somewhere doesn't clear view where love hide  <EOR> Great food great atmosphere  chicken wings best cheesy corn   so good! sure try yogurt soju perfect everything  only wish opened little bit earlier but open super late shouldn't complain  Can't wait again!! <EOR> I really want give place good review bc only place AYCE seafood but sadly experience unpleasant   Interior nicely designed very simple lots seating  little unorganized bc outside door doesn't say love Crab just says A18 karaoke thought entrance restaurant next door       Customer service servers really lacked customer service  once any them checked table see if okay  even past buy maybe 5 times still didn't ask  literally flag down while quickly walking passed table    restaurants wasn't busy all when came  Ive only seen three other tables seated  placed order scallop roll totally forgot it    order again    also wait good 10 15min receive rice already entree    then another 10min receive check  When employee passed table he did whole ohh    forgot check expression Food appetizers good  oysters little bland  But spicy cheese squid soy garlic chicken amazing!! 1 star each dishes!!! Let's down main entree  crawfish shrimp snow crab legs lobster Cajun garlic butter  sauce lacked much flavor  tasted watered down  crawfish rubbery    just didn't enjoy seafood all    If better service would food but didn't great service great food    whole concept ayce seafood great but lot flaws  price paid honestly better off hot juicy quality seafood  won't returning  <EOR> Went family dinner checking yelp reviews place  only did great reviews but owner supposed same owners Sushi Neko Sakana which both great food   soon opened only other table other us  server kind helpful explaining menu first  placed first order huge pot seafood came piping hot  honest taste very disappointing  mix wannabe hot n juicy boiling crab sauce mixed curry  sauces all fallen bottom pot all seafood bland  top off hair corn  Don't wrong  am food snob 3 5 work f b industry well understand things happen  still finished first pot wanted place another order  server never came by  tried waving down calling excuse she table right next but nope  Nothing   waiting waiting finally waved down took order  Took good 20 min second pot arrive but point we're pretty full waiting 30 min   fair 7 tables point two servers hostessing taking orders serving closing checks   need step game cooking time hire some more experienced friendlier staff knows smile staff find better sauce seafood   Def miss place being old Bazic served bomb chicken  <EOR> Holy cow!!!! experience! food amaaaaaaazing! wait staff also attentive informative generally wanted good time  DEFINITELY back! <EOR>
