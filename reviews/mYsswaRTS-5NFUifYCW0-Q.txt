I am glad friends convinced try new restaurant because always best experiences new establishments    outside building does give inside justice rather nice inside!  Give shot! <EOR> So original plan Thai Restaurant other night but closed Match where ended up   love tapas but place just didn't quite me   menu consisted many things unfamiliar  probably why   ordered Chow Mein which just okay opinion   to saucy taste   tried friends Mongolian Sliced Beef which tasty though     The Korean BBQ really cool concept   bring thinly sliced meet BBQ yourself right table   decor really nice   would good place date!    We around 10 30 Sunday night absolutely dead even though they're open til 2am started shutting down early   felt leave ya know?  I give 3 5 would give another try sometime  <EOR> We decided try Match day antiquing   we're tired hungry time surprised didn't order all menu items   any case let grade food first   Tuna Poke Salt Pepper Calamari   partner Pineapple Fried Rice   dishes seasoned well very filling   serve lot tuna poke   partner loved pineapple fried rice but lacked some saltiness it   Then came Malasadas   best ones even better ones Pure Aloha festival   definitely something different   If haven't tapas before might jar bit since most food meant tasting rather meal   2 other couples while server very attentive   All all would try them again   food great service top notch   Next time going try Korean BBQ offerings  <EOR> We decided try place friend recommended it   totally dead night Monday football on   only 2 other guys bar no diners restaurant   Service great course being only ones servers friendly   free shots when touchdown scored   ordered some small plates Jalapeno Puffs Dragon Balls Crab Wontons which all delicious  Then ordered $18 Large Plate Steak Frities VERY DISAPPOINTED   side steak well done other side totally rare inedible us   fries weren't totally done some them still hard   total bummer because really liked everything else  left plate ordered Sorbet u can't screw up    All all think nice little place nice atmosphere   We'll probably back but won't regular place go  <EOR> With newly purchased Groupon hand decided check Match last Friday night  located corner Maryland Pkwy Silverado Ranch strip mall  outside didn't look inviting Open sign lit no patio furniture  But inside different story  looks spent pretty penny interior design place or maybe previous tenants did?   way cool modern feel  top bar eyecatching because made look ship's hull   The owner Gregory incredibly nice  Apparently he's worked strip over decade operating restaurants Morels Palazzo  concept cosmopolitan tapas seemed little weird first  knowing would taste pair flavors different continents together  also skeptical restaurants large menus thinking many dishes more difficult chefs master all them  But based  seven dishes impressed  All but dishes ranged good great  Spicy sour fish $5 00 Red snapper ponzu jalapeño  spicy expected  Seared tuna $6 00 lightly seared garlic sauce  fresh good  Olepe mussels $4 00 least favorite dish  flavors decent but mussels tough Dragon balls $3 50 favorite dish night  ball spicey tuna chopped onions peppers deep fried  Garlic sausage $3 00 slices mild sausage topped chips garlic  very simple dish but tasted great  Croquetas $3 00 2 huge croquetas  They're 3 times size croquetas Firefly  Absolutely delicious  Frozen orange $5 50 orange sorbet presented inside hollowed orange fruit  pre made frozen  Although sorbet frozen chip away flavor nice refreshing   Their prices amazing! Most tapas range 3 6 bucks cheese plates $12 00 entrees $9 17 Korean BBQ $18 paella $25 pp  Beer prices around $4 7  wine list filled some gems all reasonably priced  Service excellent well  server gave some great recommendations did great job checking throughout meal  waitresses all wear schoolgirl outfits alter fit personalities  some punk rocker schoolgirls others look your typical sexy schoolgirl  don't really outfits fit global tapas concept but complaining   Their concept contains many different dishes but interesting thing try same main ingredient different cuisines  Want meal different styles pork? Chinese style dish Korean one  But would cool if more dishes same protein could create whole meal around ingredient  southern style pork dish Latin American pork dish European pork dish  picture   Overall Match amazing value  subtotal four drinks tax $54 59  Minus Groupon $19 59  tip just over $31  C'mon  unbelievable considering quality food  really hope guys succeed  needs more type restaurants suburban Las Vegas instead more chain places  Despite being bit drive place intend back often  <EOR> The most fun eating drinking singing your clothes on!  The people running Match owners servers bartenders kitchen staff some friendliest people town   always feel welcome fantastic meal end staying hours more I'd planned     The atmosphere modern clean inviting   different textures wood stone glass stainless steel boasts feeling opulence without stuffiness   music current played just right volume   They offer fabulous array sakes any questions raised cheerfully knowledgeably answered   wines the glass list diverse few lesser known wines which always appreciate   If don't come back sake service signature cocktails then you'll definitely back food   favorite dish far malasadas Hawaiian doughnuts coated sugar   They're made order warm cooked perfection each time   melt your mouth fine piece gourmet chocolate dare eat them without falling completely love   As savory dishes Dragon Balls Match's so called signature dish must try   Don't let funny name throw you   EVERYONE raves them   One personal favorites vivaneau red snapper sashimi ponzu jalapeno tobiko   dish fresh light just right amount spice   Seared ribeye green onion ginger apple sauce grilled chicken skewers calamari Korean BBQ chocolate fondue also highly recommend   Don't forget nightly specials   Last night pork sliders simply put DIE FOR    The prices can't beat  Most everything small plates meant shared   Match perfect restaurant bring date   serve full menu every evening 5 pm 'til 2 am closed Sunday   If karaoke your private room awaits but call ahead reserve because fill fast! <EOR> If  flavors Match matched restaurant's style would top restaurants Vegas   But food fell flat left disappointed   We tried Match based recommendation some Vegas' food critics raved cuisine   Maybe distracted waitresses' Japanese schoolgirl outfits   know until food arrived just couldn't believe lack flavor   We ordered cheese platter dragon balls appetizer Korean BBQ   cheese platter came interesting assortment cheeses excited until discovered cheeses flavorless hunk consistency wax two others merely bland     I'll admit dragon balls tasty but didn't blow away   Vegas food critics couldn't stop raving them but didn't it   subtle flavors but nothing rave worthy   Finally Korean BBQ ordered came simple cuts rib eye vegetables cook yourself   Now self preparation fun think your own pottery but meat wasn't particularly tasty provided very little way seasoning sauces   sauces did offer salty  tasting slightly diluted salt lick  barely used them   All all Match huge disappointment   decor very cool   waitresses' outfits entertaining   grills built into tables fun   But main point restaurant  Food  serious let down  <EOR> Most things ordered yummy! Pineapple fried rice good  Cool vibe clean good dates group friends   specials such as   Mondays girls drink $1! Tues $1 tapas! Other nights live music  Place still pretty new many people caught on  little hard see where but front smiths close McDonald's most helpful  <EOR> Well some good points some good   gave 2 because whole description felt like Meh   I heard some good things Match   Reviews actual food critics  whom am sure trust much right now    might kinda high expectations going in   Tues  night 9pm only diners   best sign   started cocktails   ordered Suspicious Minds a ginger version cosmopolitan drinkable although bit dry   husband ordered Aloha something which made pineapple flavored vodka   Think artificial pineapple candy flavored rubbing alcohol   very good   He could barely finish Kiwi Caipiroska  due actual muddled fruit sour but better previous drink   wouldn't even suggest cocktail menu any more if aren't going use real fruit real juice infused rather flavored alcohols   I each food item country origin printed next it   Kind feel eating around world   open until 2am great idea side town too   guess when drunk blandness food would good thing    The prices very reasonable not SOME places town felt comfortable quite variety small plates  started Sashimi Salad Salt Pepper Calamari Belgium Frites Dragon Balls Tuna Poke usually would order more   Well here's why didn't    The Sashimi Salad decent amount little pieces sashimi price think justifiable   way much vinegar ey dressing way little greens   greens weren't really green but horrible industrial iceberg lettuce mix Walmart shopper adores   Greens inexpensive could least given large portion absorb all vinegar   The Salt Pepper Calamari missing salt pepper   actually really tried find pepper  maybe white pepper? But couldn't see any taste either   dish many times usually actually taste Salt Pepper   panko style breading good crispyness calamari bit chewy it kept snapping back me! but NO flavor   The Belgium Frites could Ore Ida   San Francisco wouldn't surprised if frozen bag barely fried   No salt distract either   sauce Andolouse ? supposed spicy flavorful your basic mayo   Then Dragon Balls   types creations some sushi bars KNOW deep fry sushi still moist inside   not  fried much outside should called Dragon Cannon Balls  and spicy tuna inside cooked much didn't any more flavor   Last but least tried Tuna Poke  I guess considered authentic because Tuna sesame oil  but since tuna light flavor much sesame oil over powering   love sesame oil but really dish isn't appealing   Being food adventurers going try dessert anyway   comes best part meal   ordered Hawaiian dessert which biscuit dough deep fried rolled sugar   doughy balls lovely browned crispy outside tender light biscuit consistency inside   Served warm sugar covering dough moist perfect   We also ordered Frozen Coconut   great coconut sorbet sweet creamy not ice cream texture   Served inside halved coconut shell perfect ending less perfect meal  <EOR> My husband match tonight happy hour  misinformed another iPhone app which stated happy hr 5 7 $3 tapas $5 speciality cocktails  case  happy hr only $2 off speciality drinks  Regardless happy hr mishap don't think we'll b rushing back anytime soon  speciality dragon balls tough texture  Wouldn't suggest ordering them  shrimp angel phyllo dough good seared ribeye  However portions very small  fact still hungry! If you're mood tapas don't waste your time   go Firefly! <EOR> Too bad place other side town me   food excellent local joint   Tapas raw fish fresh sauce paired well   found Asian themed tapas more flavorful Spanish ones   Many dishes kimchi ingredient   little annoying when table next Korean BBQ turn overhead ventilation everyone   Suddenly talk over fan noise   best part most dish though small only cost between 3 7 dollars each   Quality food excellent price  <EOR> This restaurant offers Korean BBQ hot pot Cosmopolitan tapas e g  small plates    decided latter ordered potato croquettes very crisp outside soft inside 4 dragon balls deep fried spicy tuna peppers onion eel sauce 4 noodle wrapped shrimp 2 5    next ordered pork belly garlic chef's sauce fatty 1 5 pineapple fried rice bland 2    also shared order green tea strawberry mochi almost uneatable Japanese ice cream 0 5 Overall experience satisfactory but am inclined return  <EOR> Checked sunday night place DEAD  Six people including waitress  But didn't stop us  sat under hood all tables Korean BBQ setups  inner Decor nice modern but huge problem lighting chairs  People listen if restaurant put comfortable chairs Please!  Our waitress friendly dressed Japanese school girl up interesting  She suggested ordering few things then maybe ordering more if we're still hungry  first round fried shrimp ahi poke beef skewers sushi salad  fried shrimp wrapped shredded phyllo noodle then fried  Pretty tasty  Ahi piled top bunch shaved daikon which unremarkable  However Ahi spicy fresh firm  beef skewers finely cooked but just ok  wasn't anything wrong just plain  Simple good but boring  thought sushi salad could more inventive  quality fish great but mixed into appeared industrial restaurant salad know iceberg red cabbage carrots  finished four starters enjoyed drinks decided needed salty greasy finish off       We then dove into french fries spicy aioli dragon balls! dragon balls interesting say least  Two spicy tuna meatballs breaded fully cooked  flavor nice but breading really hard  border being able cut    The fries hot salty just wanted   overall liked place  hope word gets more people show up  If back would try korean bbq something different  <EOR> What say    food terrible but wasn't great either  Match those restaurants might come back just hell but really no good reason to    know???   We tried sliced beef ribeyes roast duck dragonballs deep fried jalapenos rolls poke seared tuna red snapper hong kong oysters baked mussels steak fries  all those really only enjoyed sliced beef seared tuna  Everything else much sauce enough taste overcooked    They guitarist singer he pretty enjoyable  Other I'd probably venture into Match six months just because cautiously optimistic it'd better if hungrier    <EOR> Been couple times group friends all agreed everything ordered delicious!  enjoyed using karaoke rooms free because order more $70 worth food   favorite dish oysters favorite drink Banzai tea! <EOR> Went back Match friend ranting cool much loved food   left little disappointed looked stupid hyping much    Noodle Wrapped Shrimp great start! Crispy saucy Compliments chef! little pricy $6 3 pieces shrimp?   Dragon Balls tasty little dry side time    Salt Pepper Calamari Normally favorite ALSO little dry time    Pinchito de Pollo chicken skewers Skinny flavorless very fatty  description says grilled chicken skewers thats exactly got    Needless say sent chicken skewers back account entirely flavorless  never sent food back before but time felt absolutely necessary  sending back food STILL charged skewers absolutely no manager presence ALL  Which really shocking considering only table seated time    There isn't real likelihood returning MATCH think just stick Firefly thanks! <EOR> I guess management does understand   I totally when large party your automatically charged gratuity may even pay more if service good   but when your 2 people waitress scams into paying saying she'll take care thats another thing if she would've warned beginning night couldn't seperate checks could've kept track all each party consumed  I sincerely apologize Match restaurant reviewing all your policies proceedures before eating there   I guess customer always right them  <EOR> Great food!
