She did really understand speak English except thank you  sure if she meant 2 each but when food came realized she meant could split one   Each plate massive flat soft bread bottom   Mine salad paste then she poured meat dish provided side bread   friend lamb same set but some mashed yellow lentils   The meat sauce itself good nice spice salad fresh chillies but paste killed me   dipped some bread all eat hand no utensils tasted toxic ground coffee    I thought poisoned   horrible   covered some extra bread just ate little more beef but then giant flying bug landed table lost appetite   Plus still eating dark dipping hands oily beef dish   Honestly think am turned off trying any Ethiopian restaurant now would never again   friend felt bad paid took leftovers   am fairly adventurous but prefer eat restaurants open business lights someone explain language food order correctly know am eating  <EOR> Decent Food  Bad Neighborhood  Star rating based restaurant location     The food decent especially friend's first time eating Ethiopian food  lentil dishes slightly under cooked but everything delicious    The service good  owner wasn't when arrived but finishing extremely hospitable welcoming   Rating dependent location but if visiting should know info  major issue location  taxi driver questioned why would ever want should inquired further  great difficulty getting Uber taxi back hotel  female Uber driver canceled pickup because she wouldn't drive into area  felt safe secure early evening but would later  <EOR> Prior going vegan never really tried other cuisines  afraid unknown but soon realized fear came own mind   As relatively new Vegan 7 months feels forever new resident Las Vegas all over city eating foods all cuisines provide vegan options  girlfriend found Axum say place blew minds    The veggie plate huge fulfilling lentils red green corns beans etc   Axum knows put all together  food didn't take long prepare environment family environment welcomed own    Although located part town isnt very aesthetically pleasing still manage awesome hosts provide excellent food  customer service made place only Ethiopian food home us    The ONLY reason place gets four stars area located in  wouldn't want girlfriend friends alone establishment itself nice but outside doors REAL world exists its unforgiving littered streets lost Las Vegas    Other that     we three times close where live but journey worth every mouthful  Enjoy! <EOR> Axum happened first real experience Ethiopian food previously while going school ethnic potluck dinner   group 8 10 people which loved place actually suggest go  When walked immediately noticed group am guessing Ethiopians sitting around bar no else  place did look very prepared serving restaurant patrons  menus come guess since he suggested restaurant he decided order everyone since he familiar cuisine  little miffed point but don't care enough big deal it  least ordered some vegetarian food   So when food comes huge platters injera traditional Ethiopian bread bottom food top  enjoyed experience eating hands sharing but food great atmosphere totally sucked   When finished meal waitress mentioned restaurant under new management handed some business cards  guessing change management could account discrepancy between Keith A's review mine  just picky asshole  probably later  <EOR>
