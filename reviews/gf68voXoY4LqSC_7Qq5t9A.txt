Lobster Cobb salad must have   very generous portion avocado bacon tomatoes   asked server Kelly without spicy dressing chose sweet honey mustard dressing then drawn butter lobster   portion lobster great very tasty   think sweet honey mustard dressing perfect well   husband fisherman's platter did wonderful job it   batter greasy very flavorful  Our water glasses never empty  We planning come back lunch heard chowder great  <EOR> Not impressed all  Both lobster freshly steamed lukewarm best  Fresh steamed veggies but again cold! Lobster okay but MUCH better $50 00 <EOR> Went behalf Groupon   Walking actual restaurant looks really small bar quite puzzled  But come find Host led into back where actual restaurant setting  really theme  walls tables chairs right down lobster like claw salt pepper shakers  actually really cute   I Mermaid Mojito start off which mojito strawberries it  drink pretty big but didn't even hint buzz tolerance because consumed more alcohol while Vegas bartender sheisty  option 2 just sayin'  Had Angel Hair Pasta No meat Lent which pasta tomatoes garlic basil olive tapenade  bad no complaints since finished whole thing  guess say serving sizes just right don't want roll eating The service awesome well guess only thing prevented giving 5 stars Host guess kept checking walking random times just stare  course oblivious but friend noticed right off bat pointed every time he passed by  Sorta creepy if ask me  Meh whatevers  <EOR> I came friend Jacky dinner only food beautifully presented but flavor amazing! staff really nice chef Ice came spoke also  already referred few people restaurant keep doing so! <EOR> Fantastic!!!! Bravo!! restaurant Gem! Preparation presentation fantastic!! would drive Over 300 miles just sit table enjoy marvelous meal! <EOR> I ate bar  Glass water  seen mixed reviews place figured would start appetizer if yummy move entree  chose crab spinach dip  nice size portion $12 bucks but taste bland all doors  plenty crab also  sent back lobster seafood stuffed mushrooms  much better yet still lacking flavor  didn't entree probably won't back <EOR> Frank nicest servers Vegas ! He great personality recommended try mermaid mojito when night 21st birthday man oh man did love drink  boyfriend back drink everyday staying treasure island before would night   He far made restaurant fun exciting stop   Whenever would stop would hope see again   <EOR> My apology servers because isn't reflection them very good service  food however below mediocre  Don't waste your time going here  many more restaurants Vegas enjoy more  worst food Vegas  Long John Silver better place  <EOR> I seen  lot positive reviews place maybe just hit them off night  When say off night literally many tables seated wait staff  Yet somehow service extremely slow! Granted did party 8 really wasn't huge crowd none orders anything required special request met  Dinner took almost 2 5 hours even though complained the manager slow service nothing done try it  usual sorry work which means don't care just pay high prices leave tourist   could deal slow inattentive service if actually took complaints seriously but place clearly does care needs customer  highlight evening when waitress came sad table don't worry surprise birthday cake still coming   Uh   so guess surprise ruined when announce surprise birthday gal  Wow    <EOR> During trip LV felt need only eat highest Yelp rated restaurants  only downside digging couple Benjamins cater that  Food LV definitely overpriced! But expect right? stayed treasure island passed seafood shack plenty times but didn't turn heads  late very cold night really hungry didn't want walking outside looking food where did go? seafood shack  From outside doesn't look actual restaurant because only see bar  Once walk actually pretty big very cutely decorated  The food great! Big portions dry stingy seafood  Our waiter also very very friendly accommodating even when dad asking 7th bottle beer  wish remembered waiters name but he definitely gave lot attention! We stayed long time just chit chatting never felt rushed    This last day trip wish could've gave them chance earlier! <EOR>
