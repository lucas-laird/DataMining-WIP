I used eat yummy  live close called them numerous times last 5 years try order but no would ever answer phone till last night  waiting 5 years order just 16 inch cheese pizza am told would ready pickup 15 minutes   20 minutes later pizza ready yet no big deal   pay leave home open box inside mushy gooshy mess call pizza  took 2 people just slice box plate because limp  crust undercooked where toppings overcooked edges completely tasteless unsalted saltine cracker   sauce disgusting believe any tomato garlic all tasted red wine sauce hadn't reduced alcohol cooked yet   cheese plentiful but stringy chewy hard cut   called let them know undercooked just said ok hung up    left still hungry opted throw horrid mess trash instead making myself sick consuming it  <EOR> Don't know its new management since reopened but turns way off dump  being regular owner started hitting every time referred women '' bitches''  Disgusting stay away now  <EOR> I fought decision down tooth nail   end lost because simply couldn't two blocks anywhere else Double Down  Random pizza shops always gamble which rarely pan out   We order large pepperoni pizza pizza man couldn't more excited  He gets work take seats dining area  no difference outside temperature inside which made twenty minute wait little bit more excruciating   pizza comes shimmering light reflecting off its greasy shores   attempted take first slice off slips easily off server upside down back into pan  lack rise bread grease made completely unwieldy  take bite slices didn't taste bad but annoying roll slice able hold it   what's wrong pizza?  The main problem crust needs thick thin   If thin then should crisp order maintain integrity slice   solution would pre bake crust rather sending into oven all toppings   Also leaner pepperoni could reduce grease     Really nice guy appreciated business but pizza simply missed mark  <EOR>
