Had poke little review here   If seen last JITB review just imagine complete opposite that   drive thru around 1230 today  lady asked day ordered 1 Jr bacon 1 Jr Bacon plain 1 breakfast jack  asked if still dollar drinks lady apologized promotion over  order read back pulled window  way decided add order mini cookies saw sign  No problemo  order woman gave 10% off next order no reason could tell asked if service good last visit  told first visit but awesome she wished happy thanksgiving   should drive through     PS  jr bacon plain cookies delicous    THANKS JACK  <EOR> I wasn't going post because wasn't sure last time but know now racist service  both occasions waited 15 20 minutes place order while staff more capable taking it restaurant business 4 years  Then someone finally takes order when relize leaving  Then white person walks time white female helped them right away looked screen which displayed same number drive thru  If your colored person don't come location unless white friend prepaired wait 1 4 1 3 hour! Your welcome  <EOR> I say being fast food joint salads really fresh!  ordered side salad full size salad grilled chicken haven't disappointed yet freshness!   I've tried salad nearby competitor mixed luck  Some days red hair girl gives decently fresh salad but most times see vegetables starting wilt   case Jack Box  When comparing side salads definitely more JITB prefer ranch dressing although competitor baked potatoes    I sometimes pair salad value menu item chicken sandwich Jr  Jack    This place salads when want fast  <EOR> Came drive through associate name Allen extremely rude  He took order attitude really did act he wanted all  Management should really evaluate workers customer service  <EOR> So annoyed  jack box 7 hours moving into new place  food ice cold  won't back location EVER  Tropicana always food fresh order late night staff way more professional  #thisplacesucks <EOR> Just tried 'Wakey Bakey' fan  way much oil which made unpleasant don't recommend product all  However service drive through employee great he super friendly milkshake tastes delicious  which why ranked review 4 stars  <EOR> Kayla terrible customer service  Extremely rude didn't help messed order  addition hung me  No wonder you're manager jack n box  <EOR> Went munchie meal though drive thru hard time ordering sign wasn't  showing asked person working she seemed annoyed answer question finally window payed  tried ask some simply sauces she just kept say if trying ask much more  she turned around thought she putting sauce bag but home realized she didn't  top burnt food didn't even eat food  waste time money  <EOR> Terrible store  Line forming all cared drive thru customers  Walked elsewhere  <EOR> I come least once day     I typically only drinks drive but known crush some croissant donuts!   Oops! Lol   The service typically good all seem rather friendly  <EOR> Grabbed late breakfast through drive thru today  Service fast food hot tasted should definitely fast food establishments choice  <EOR> It's happened everyone   pull away drive through confident Man Window filled your order successfully   plop down couch unpack your booty alas alack twas meant be   recent experience involved uninvited switcheroo seasoned curly fries ordered regular fries delivered at least still some type fry right?    But despite accident prepared give Jack Box benefit doubt all day breakfast options trump occasional drive through error seemingly unavoidable world fast food   In realm Vegas fast food Sonic Jack Box only two options 24 hour drive through breakfast   Sonic never leaves feeling all great afterward options seem greasier less satisfying   Jack Box barely beats Sonic grease factor but collection egg sandwiches bowls available anytime scores local locations win book battle bagged breakfasts     If options driving way Sonic Jack Box around corner Jack mind made up   Specifically since don't order fast food drinks the food bad enough really need sugar ade wash down? JitB more convenient tastier Sonic continue support them necessary satisfy junk food cravings despite occasional miscue  <EOR> Im late night customer only come midnight Jeff fun always positive person come hard days work he carries very positive attitude way making people smile <EOR> I work nights off work late  tired physically exhausted  All wanted hot meal bed  never Jack Box before given only fast food place really open drive home decided time give try    I used drive thru which three other cars it  ordered spicy chicken sandwich meal substituted curly fries  pleasantly surprised quickness drive thru window no time  quickly received food back road no time   When home dove into meal  sandwich made fresh chicken still steaming hot but extremely tasty  excited curly fries always fan Arby's curly fries  Well surprise same if better recommended   finishing meal pleased amount price well taste products  wish tried sooner  Really good place quick meal  <EOR> In grand scheme fast food all say bad bad all sure does crap McDonald's Burger King curly fries pretty darn decent <EOR> Stopped grab Value Size Fries limited time glad did   only time started wonder took long she called up  boy did them fresh hot crispy salt melting she upgraded small free!

But today cherry popper me   just want thank brother DAVE!! guys most professional polite gentleman encountered! just those damn wish moments happen first time! amazed very thankful  All gotta say guy needs raise promotion! dont encounter kind generously considerate people anymore  If girl id it! LOL <EOR> I am giving star because Cheyenne drive through worker helped us    Worst service ever manager  soda machine wasn't working properly  Scott let them know  cashier said nothing he could it  Scott asked manager  She said she would fix it  She came kitchen piddled around machine back into kitchen back grill area  Didn't say if she fixed broke nothing  then ask again  pointed she back into kitchen asked if machine fixed  She tells machine fixed  When asked why she didn't let know she stated she cook manager    She then returned back grill  When Scott asked speak again time long pony tail flapping around she refused come speak Scott    I'd point Cheyenne drive thru worker did manager should done she offered drink soda fountain  Easy peasy right there  hard that?!?  Needless say won't returning  Sad really close us  <EOR> Food usually pretty good  enjoy salads but best Southwest sometimes stock day  Burgers good when you're hungry long day work you've driven through rush hour  <EOR>
