Took forever order drinks waitress just simply bad attitude   Food mess sides tasteless fish fried way hard chicken ok but could seasoned lil better    most likely return <EOR> Located Las Vegas Boulevard just south Sahara second location M M Vegas  If hard time finding look Holiday House Motel East side road  same parking lot which features excellent views Aztec Inn which hear great buffet way Ihop   ok kidding views  But new location definitely much larger then first quite bit more seating lot more open feeling  Everything else remains just same including styling menu etc   While first visit new location original couple times  tried quite few different things other wasn't happy but save another review it  location ordered something never gotten before Smothered Pork Chops  $14 99 two pork chops 3 sides  pork chops themselves smaller side pretty tough also dry  Since smothered wasn't bad eating them but texture gravy bit weird way salty  Besides helping meat more edible didn't really anything plate  3 sides chose greens cornbread dressing fried okra  could just new opening issues but besides greens all sides lacking  dressing extremely grainy also covered overly salted gravy  Okra basically flavorless seemed barely fried making them greasy  Overall sides just weren't used getting other location   Unfortunately same could said service  waitress friendly most part but felt bit rushed having strange issues getting drinks  When first sat down completely skipped when taking drink orders then brought wrong drink couple people party  When came time refills almost no clue anyone drinking come back more then once ask  also bringing warm tea without refilling ice even just bringing extra glasses ice  Some could partially fault busser looked he first day but only 1 other table sat during most meal pretty frustrating  checked couple times but again service just wasn't original location   There few things however matched we're used too  Maybe most importantly but cornbread pancakes fried chicken  Those little fluffy cakes brought before your meal absolutely delicious if could I'd probably order half stack those things themselves  also seem executing fried chicken well  only small bite but no complaints  nice crispy salty skin cooked just right  Very juicy hint dryness  There's definitely reason they're known chicken   Now when employees Charleston location told new opening couple months ago told going open 24 hours  looks those plans changed they're only going open 24 hours during some portions summer  guess time thinking only weekends summer time  All other times they'll open 7am 9pm  Breakfast served until 10am 11am depending day week   Really still torn M M  many things other location didn't can't say certain I'd give any more 3 stars either  But having both service food just doesn't compare original I'd say solid 2 5 rounding 3 since they're new  may back if area but I'd much rather visit original location time being  <EOR> Really dig place  may back breakfast last morning town!

WTF?!!!!!!!! KNOW just came in  decided say anything because know some men don't give fcuk disrespecting women didn't want put myself position  SHAME MANAGEMENT ALLOWING HAPPEN    About 10 minutes later seated  kitchen  trying BEST look kitchen because if did sure would lost appetite  Waiters waitresses blatantly ignored 15 minutes  didn't feel special though because ignoring other customers seated also  Finally waiter brought water earlier took order  smothered chicken cabbage mac cheese friendgirl smothered pork chop mashed potatoes collards  Food pretty decent  Nothing write home though  When back Vegas couple months won't return simply because don't agree way run business  Doesn't matter if your food amazing if your service poor NO me  <EOR> This first time being Los Angeles excited see thinking gonna some good soul food  place wasn't super crowded but made wait outside called seated  waited maybe 10mins then when seated service SUPER SLOW horrible  When finally food cold nasty  fish mainly cornmeal  Hot sauce watered down hot  Welp NEVER come back waste money <EOR> Better then L A  Unbelievable but yes Jerria doll wonderful service great food <EOR> I never write reviews while sitting place because want give them fighting chance amaze but exception!!!!   We walked door no greet take name  few people left sat down waiting area some waitress walked over asked many party  She then sat ahead few other parties  then sat waited              I find own menus waitress looked crazy when reached one  excuse restaurant need menu know offer  Then waited some more                   15 min later someone walked handed silver wear   10 min waitress came said she would right back         Another 10 min someone else said would right us  Another 5 cornbread pancakes no butter still no drinks   Another 10 min placed drink order  Almost hour still haven't ordered food    There disclaimer menu another 20 min wait fried food most food menu fried 10 min later finally ordered food mentioned going leave IHOP waitress overheard It now over hour just ordered food  waitress felt bad she brought another cornbread pancake but point just want food  But since ordered fried food probably another 20 30 min that    Sigh just wanted some soul food before head home epic weekend all getting far epic fail service    Can't review food since haven't eaten yet      <EOR> Although mixed reviews when looked into figured find myself  Word mouth hyped guessed worth shot besides always soul food   Pros Fried Chicken very well seasoned well catfish  mac cheese good  service friendly very efficient refills  Order homemade lemonade! good  peach cobbler AMAZING! Wish served warm ice cream topped quality brand vanilla bean   Cons cabbage lacked seasoning any kind did find minced piece some unknown meat small determine  greens bland red beans rice well rice gravy mediocre but wish serving size larger accommodate 3 large oxtails  Now oxtails very VERY good! meat perspective but ratio fat meat losing battle fatty! Picture follow    Overall Id return But try other location better reviews order differently  <EOR> The food great but service terrible  seemed hurry close although arrived least hour before closing  initially seated side restaurant but moved other side because trying close down side  wasn't problem  moved other side restaurant drink order taken but didn't receive drinks  Cornbread arrived still no drinks No waitress take order  ask some water point since did bring something snack on  water never arrived  Finally waitress arrives takes drink orders again still no drinks point food order  food finally arrives but still drinks  Oh forgot mention waitress smells weed when she's taking orders  finally drinks most food arrived  son no food  daughter ordered last ribs he now order something else fly  still didn't any water but waitress brings bill asks if would take some drinks go  When she comes back drinks she now informs cannot use cards pay bill because machine down  Now would've useful information when first arrived already used most cash earlier day  reading few other reviews poor service seems little common over last few weeks but food still great  Improve service 5 stars would problem  Bad service people want come back  #mylittletwocents <EOR> Whenever Vegas place must! traditional home style menu welcomed change other restaurants offered strip  Food prepared just Grandma used make  corn cakes favorite!
