Really Sonic?   Super disappointed  <EOR> Horrible   Waited drive through 45 min window where additional 8 min Waite took place   If business known busy needs staff accordingly   <EOR> I frequent location most since closest house  There's always great text deals usually they're pretty fast   shakes really filling but hey if you're down  8pm they're half price!  The other great thing?

Avoid    Avoid   Avoid  The line literally take 30mins food! No joke! Could 1 car front take them forever! literally sat drive thru window 15mins before  asked employee taking long she just said sorry  <EOR> This location used great  sure happened   I placed order boneless wing combo plus two small drinks since happy hour  When finally window pay employee read order back wrong  Totally okay only off two items corrected he back correct it  happy hour busy time things happen  really big deal   What wasn't okay taking 20 minutes fix small error  All wrong fries instead tots combo adding small drink forgot add  Literally 20 minutes window that  When cashier finally made contact again he mistakenly read back medium drink instead small drink  just said fine because would another 10 minutes if would corrected again   The correction took long carhops delivered orders two people behind drive thru  employees knew taking long gives? also charged full price order while other Sonic locations given orders free waiting half time  trying anything free but location isn't normal Sonic Drive In   Avoid location all costs if value your time sanity  won't going back while  <EOR> Really tired getting wrong orders  really hard read receipt! Constantly getting tots when ask fries getting all wrong drinks? amount time takes even food orders should correct! <EOR> These guys suck messed order told refunded account almost month still haven't refunded $20   Everytime contact them always story banks called bank showed them receipt where shows refunded check bank advised never refund issued   Then they're come down see give cash but manager never always says let know schedule never does   Shady business practices  If refund file report BBB   would've gave them zero stars but 1 default <EOR> Sizes smaller but quality food still great  Little bit pricey but would recommend place fast food items  tatter tots m m sonic blast French toast sticks  Never disappointment when come place  <EOR> Don't ever order Supersonic breakfast burrito unless mouthful raw white onions first thing morning   place breakfast burrito without least heating veggies?
