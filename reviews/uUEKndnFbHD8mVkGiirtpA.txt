Taste good  <EOR> I decided swing Tommy Bahamas restaurant week because menu looked promising  picked 30 dollar option both crab bisque coconut shrimp then differed entree where ribs he fish chips  dessert added key lime pie    I surprised fast service each course soon brought over next waitress super attentive    happy see carried beer kona  brewing company    appreciate unique floral notes tends posses but unsure which wanted   She brought samples two contemplating could easily decide    So down food    crab bisque creamy flavorful nice pieces crab inside   great heavenly bread supply table   hot buttery mmmm  having moment just thinking it    The coconut shrimp perfectly cooked coated golden juicy mango dipping sauce savory jicima slaw  best coconut shrimp ever had     The ribs where lost bit    blackberry sauce which OK but ribs many dry hard areas   same great jicima slaw which seems common side many items cauliflower mash great   However since star dish ribs failed continue joyful momentum started feel former dishes    My boyfriend fish chips spin dish chips made yucca instead potatoes   fish battered well best fish chips ever but solid still   also jicima slaw which call island slaw actually    After all food exploding asked them switch pie which restaurant week only 5 dollar addition order  ended being delicious   Great tart sweet ratio solid crust lovely whipped topping    This first time besides happy hour dined establishment over all could definitely see myself coming back dinner again   especially those shrimp  <EOR> We came cool off heat happy great lunch treat  Doug waiter couldn't more pleasant  He gave excellent service far best service awhile  enjoy cool beer split appetizer which very thoughtful  sandwiches came timely manner when did didn't even pause chat because busy enjoying every bite   Doug came whole tray desserts available believe no way could say no!

They great variety happy hour drinks sangria glasses wine martinis  happy hour food good well  duo dips good snack beer cheese delicious!   As entrees haven't tried many but did try ahi tacos pho nominal!!! <EOR> I am glad Tommy Bahama brand diversified themselves having restaurants maybe clothing line came after?  Regardless    the clothing line all means individuals well into 40s+   Although clothing line am reviewing but felt necessary share     From Scottsdale Maui now experience Las Vegas say chain yet disappoint   service always top notch food fantastic prices edge being overpriced but price point works me     Portion sizes usually enough share getting couple apps entree which allows drinking during dessert end way usually it   think oversized because not   Each entree sized filling    I'm just saying appetizers good order more one   Which ones recommend?  All them    seriously     We patio night wasn't crazy ground spot lights kind blinding times    nice ambiance but wasn't fan table   bar looked good place come if looking spot attend regularly   right size right mix men women     <EOR> Went lunch must say place nothing more glorified Chilis specilaizes fusion American Hawaiian food  Mainly taste any other average American restaurant happens Ahi tuna large number dishes  Despite own inclination special lunch decided against gut Tuna Melt lunch  mean doesn't want beer battered avocado slices sandwich? Before any if saw menu you'd see yourself lack eye catching items minus fish tacos  Anyways food gets looks sandwich came Denny's  must payed attention because sandwich also came two slices thick bacon  Never real fan bacon noticed foodie experience places generally add bacon dishes lack any real flavor  Surprise surprise sandwich tasted nothing  tuna very fishy obviously freshest cut fish available  tasted very fishy chicken salad sandwich also looked one  If huge fan aforementioned you'd love  However if thought chicken salad sandwich ellicits emesis response your dopamine receptors mine then hate it  Fries   how mess up  Shockingly fries stale cold something resembled tasted Italian seasoning it  Service wish could say point but server looked pretty busy  No real rapport established besides taking order refilling waters  No recommendations  No small talk  dining  tropical themed McDonalds  only great part experience Creme Brûlée which housed pineapple  could eaten four those  summary would recommend place besides desserts willingly back again  heard happy hour great maybe try future  *Mic drop  <EOR> While heading Tommy Bahama perplexed talking friend over phone discovered offering happy hour Thursday night  What? mean place sells Hawaiian shirts? Well yes but restaurant bar attached it  very wonderful happy hour menu  started off Chardonnay $6 then moved Mai Tai $6   wish two Mai Tai's! delicious packed punch! feeling little tipsy  presentation nice too    I fish tacos off happy hour menu  tastes delectable even though tiny little tacos plenty grilled fish them  love grilled fish tacos hate fried fish tacos bleck  However bit cool side  think may sitting few moments long before being brought out  However didn't stop enjoying them   So those all good things  some not so good things  First off guy playing guitar  use quotations because half time he actually playing guitar but instead messing around Mac Book which playing music him? Eh lame  Next off when drinking wine bartender swooped little decanter she given along wine glass well still wine it! jaw literally dropped stared disbelief  She quickly deposited back front snatched poured rest wine glass quickly  don't know if accident but way incredibly awkward  Lastly bartender also dropped off incorrect check friend and then never saw again   new bartender arrived prodded into purchasing more drinks but then left never returned see if actually wanted more drinks   Luckily another bartender finally noticed displeasure because assuming radiating being given check #1 ours #2 WAY more expensive actual check  bartender very nice quick fix mix though   In conclusion Tommy Bahama's just ugly pineapple shirts anymore! <EOR> I really surprised find Tommy Bahamas actually restaurant   even more surprised food really good   Plus service outstanding   Cuban sandwich pretty good being made Cubans South Florida   think know judge Cuban sandwiches because used live South Florida well Caribbean   also crab bisque soup which really great too   servings large would appeal those hearty appetites   would definitely return here  <EOR> We took husband birthday dinners  We celebrate birthdays all month long! love ambiance because feels mini vacation while wait your order    I started Crab Bisque   little bits blue crab sherry cream crushed croutons  light sweet taste pinch saltiness  crabtastic! think slightly better taste then Texas De Brazil 's Lobster Bisque    I ordered Thai Shrimp Scallops main entree  hesitant first because some places under cook scallops where taste little chewy   cooked scallops perfect! expect scallop flaky gooey  curry taste mild which prefer  liked coconut curry taste  didn't over power each other    We ended meal Pina Colada cake  husband brother wanted something chocolaty but way much chocolate Valentine's day  ordered cake  Everyone table liked because nice moist frosting wasn't heavy overly sweet    The service also point very accommodating! <EOR> The service environment location private party room available great parties  dessert food excellent  <EOR> Had company party there  Service outstanding glass never empty  Great atmosphere!!! food good! <EOR> Very satisfied happy hour!

Very impressed <EOR> Decided try Town Square location Friday night  Surprisingly no trouble getting reservations 7 00 PM  When arrived restaurant virtually empty  all seemed very strange given location reviews  seated patio weather beautiful  Service somewhat slow but eventually arrived  Drinks OK  requested 1800 tequila but didn't it  shared salad excellent  wait bread being baked ran out  arrived meal almost over   wife ordered fillet OK but cold  side vegetable offerings limited  ordered almond crusted snapper  ordered came said snapper would substitute Barramundi  strange substitute  fish subsequently delivered tasteless cold  Service glacially slow  Ultimately did eat entrées left  offered coupon free appetizer but left table  Now know why restaurant empty Friday night  <EOR> Spectacular island style decor  Our entrees both delicious  <EOR> I love food here   always fun spot laidback yet upscale meal   never seems busy dinner which shame because cute restaurant food great!
