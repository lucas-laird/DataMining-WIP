There's nothing worse getting served salmonella plate    My tab came $27 those 2 items  seriously joke  such horrible gross experience! Never again!! *barf* <EOR> I am real food guy   good meal very happy   am very familiar love Japanese ramen   read restaurant lunch today but when left only small smile face   Tonkotsu ramen good basic ramen   The noodles very small all stuck together   does happen?  thick chewy noodles disappointed   Next broth   thin very flavorful rich   no depth single note flavor     The pork bacon pieces smoky flavorful but only two small pieces?  The motif Tokyo ramen shop long counter stools facing kitchen but within view chefs   few tables against opposite wall   quite attractive really   I hope stay around long enough find way  <EOR> Sorry Shoku but more disappointed trying Spicy Miso Ramen  Prior ordering asked server if Ramen comes bamboo if add order which he said does  first thing noticed when came didn't bamboo talked about  took almost hour wait them finally bring bowl Ramen  broth eh corn hard mushroom taste it  terrible service bad food definitely keep coming back  <EOR> Terrible ramen  Sashu pork just bacon  Quarter inch layer oil top  Ate bite left behind because oily tasted bacon  Can't comment anything else    Service somewhat poor  Ramen came friends 3 4 finished meals  Never came back check whether food acceptable  walk front check    Avoid place  <EOR> I'll keep simple wouldn't consider myself ramen connoisseur   simply enjoy great food Shoku it   twice past couple weeks definitely returning probably weekend!    flavors amazing prices very fair   Last night decided add Natto great well      Great job simple flavorful menu! <EOR> Their ramen real good offer other dishes other ramen natto rice bowl which also staff friendly  place Fukumimi best town ramen  <EOR> So came today lunch friends said enjoyed place previously   Came sat immediately then waited around 15 minutes order which seriously annoying especially almost everyone seated able order first   spicy miso ramen extra spicy weren't kidding spicy but  ok bit chili head   waitress told some people thought salty she recommended getting hot water side   didn't think really needed but used anyway full flavor still there   noodles cooked well but wish more them   finished them way before even halfway through broth   Overall meal fine but think better ramen restaurants around town   Food = 3 stars Service = 2 5 stars Ambiance = 3 stars <EOR> Ramen review!!!

Service attentive server took time educate everything  can't emphasize enough great service was  food top notch dessert made outstanding lunch  recommended anyone  <EOR> I high hopes noodle shop opened guys did Bachi burgers   Came try place compare against Fukumimi Monta  Shouldn't bothered     The broths salty wife 3 glasses water each with   Noodles ok cooked al dente but broth good bowl ramen theirs certainly lacking     Also yummy order chicken wings which served some sort aioli dip   Perhaps should consider fried chicken shop instead   because delicious     It's decent eatery but probably won't returning better options  <EOR> Hehe found new ramen restaurant Vegas   There couple ramen ya Vegas thought tried them all but Shoku ramen  Simply just it! Broth flavor pork porky good way  Noodles soft wavy mathes soups   Another good ramen spot Vegas yay  <EOR> Buta san bomb com! gotta try pork cheek!

Esp when some people only want food shoku only? 5 other parties also waiting long time table wait till The packed bachi burger open tables  no sense  <EOR> Still Monta better!!! <EOR> Food ok  Nothing rave about  Calamari tasteless ramen very generic very poor noodles pork portion  Server Dylan very good well educated service very attentive but just place no ambiance quality feel  Sorry better expectation brand place  <EOR> went eat noodle place  restaurant half empty but hostess says 10 minute wait   okay wait 25 minutes no luck  Call manager he says very busy wait until ready seat serve no thanks   Unbelievably rude poor service luckily Mikos 100 yards away better meal no muss no fuss   Really annoying when restaurants wait because look busy  Won't back dump <EOR> I'm writing review sit awaiting ramen while boyfriend's burger sits front growing cold  place busy even hectic enough justify 20 and counting wait soup forgotten drinks strawberry lemonade iced green tea server dropped off app plates no reason two sets chopsticks  No matter good food service sucks  someone worked food beverage 9 5 years NYC never seen something any type reputable place <EOR> So dunno if you've ever situation where you're really hungry you're thinkin 'Do want Burger feel hot bowl Noodles?'  typical      numerous occasions let tell could ponder fork road hours   if only place served both      Tadaaaa!  Well exactly place more two places adjacent each other chef owner Lorin Watada whose fusion burger fame 'Bachi Burger' propelled into Ramen game current 'it' food Vegas   enough Japanese fare opinion!Jaku Niku Kyo Shoku The Weak Meat Strong Eat Shoku Ramen ya   I say there's Ramen explosion going Vegas getting little over saturated  all Ramen joints popping up   not complaining   Some places taste better one's Japan! no kidding Well being right next door Bachi culinary Sophie's Choice am willing let go could possible eat Burger Fries right bowl Ramen Gyoza?  If only could deliver next door would best both worlds right sitting  mean many calories could be   4 000?  What's 7 hours Starimaster? No prob!  Shoku Ramenya relatively small just under thirty seats but feels pretty open spacious noodle shop   particularly enamored set condiments table well jug water provide you're seated refilled often throughout meal   iced Green tea also refill friendly all little plusses add end     Pork Gyoza  Always start off plate Gyoza cultural tradition Ramen Shops provide half dozen moon shaped crispy delights stuck together little piglets   always little game try pick them off without ripping skin retaining piping hot filling within its crackling confines   pork enjoyed strong hit Garlic but felt if meat slightly overcooked harder texture without juicy component would expect when bite into Gyoza    Lobster Miso Ramen  Somewhat offbeat item Lobster Miso Ramen Butter Sake poached Lobster pieces along usual Ramen suspects Chasu Pork Slices Buttered Corn Kikurage Wood Ear Mushrooms Menma Mabmboo Shoots Nori Seaweed Kaiware Daikon Sprouts    broth made gooey brown Crustacean brain sludge hence Lobster Miso delivers predominantly briny sea ocean soup if  your thing drive insanely happy!  I bouncing off walls tasted good! best both there's three Chasu pieces resting top although looked more thick cut Pork Belly slices me  Minor details     Usually portions overgenerous where hurting finish bowl case fact left wanting little more Ramen noodles all toppings   As dessert tempted something cold all hot broth Ice Cream seemed good idea  terrible fond Black Sesame seems reoccurring ingredient many Japanese desserts   Assured moderate portion came pint Ice Cream which could only considered scoop if its contents came ten gallon vat factory     should know better but slightly disappointed every time order Japanese dessert relatively mild lukewarm sweetness   underwhelming   But palate cleanser definitely needed all oils broth kinda worked     So now come down Battle won?  For Appetizers don't know both different!! For Main can't choose they're both good!!!

Being ignored inexcusable  Although Shoku conveniently close work home   I drive Flamingo Decatur impeccable greeting service noodles rice  suggest employee meetings retraining  <EOR> I'm huge Monta fan recently heard establishment  Being side town having heard generally good things place super excited try food    The seating good liked glassware dishes if interested sort thing   menu lot different things used seeing Monta happy try something new  boyfriend Kim chi pork bowl daughter bacon Takana fried rice  ordered buta san broth extra chashu poached egg   Their bacon rice absolutely amazing perfectly honest  tried some daughter's food therefore high hopes own dish  Unfortunately extremely disappointed choice    There hardly any broth while large portion noodles pork lack broth deterrent  mushrooms acquired taste enjoy because never disliked food much disliked meal   mushroom lover but stench emanating dish such deterrent  smelling eating old dirty sock    hadn't washed months  picked them but smell taste lingered making unpalatable push off boyfriend agreed bad but took home himself anyway    I liked atmosphere server extremely friendly but don't think going going back   Personally would picked star but bacon fried rice delicious bumped score bit  delicious enough return unfortunately but sure friend would stamp cards them  shame loved everything else place  <EOR> I use love place  am very disappointed service new food changes  use love pork ramen extra types pork pork belly favorite now gotten rid chicken karage  really wished didn't morph burger place  <EOR> Pretty good ramen   honestly wasn't quite good remembered last time they've changed menu lot   but pork belly still melts your mouth! <EOR> Another addition Japanese ramen houses Vegas Shoku falls just little short couple other ramen places really like   Located next door Bachi Burger place nice ambiance fresh upper class atmosphere   service top notch well   Don't afraid take date here!

Overall ramen good but great   didn't find myself unable stop eating   noodles slightly over cooked   chashu average tasting just filler   fillers general weren't bad corn seaweed etc  but something quite balance broth   may half spoon garlic added maybe salty   broth absorbed lobster flavor which liked first but ate something just didn't work me     Shoku Ramen ya nice place if live area but probably won't seeking myself  <EOR> When arrived two large parties two others front me  waited 10 minutes host even acknowledge walked door take down name  waited 45 minutes seated another 20 minutes order  Miso Ramen boyfriend ordered Spicy Miso  disappointed lack flavor small portions meat each meals  experience reinforces beliefs stick know good venture other options town  Don't waste your time coming anything Ramen related  <EOR> This perfect place defined HELL's KITCHEN!!

Yes  some unexplainable reason outside universal force told eat ramen  knew Shoku Ramen ya right around corner adventure began!  When arrived sat down presented large container water shot glass  first questioned whether serving sake  minor complaint but wasn't fan having refill water shot glass 27 times   THE RAMEN When order ramen new place first time keep simple  ordered Tonkotsu ramen  ramen arrived 10 15 minutes later kind long time considering restaurant only half full    The first thing immediately noticed only piece pork  pork tender delicious  However half piece pork entirely fat nearly inedible   Next dove straight into noodles  ramen cooked perfectly  then grabbed spoon proceeded taste some broth its own  broth very one dimensional  some pork flavor but wasn't EXPLODING pork flavor  wasn't good because noodles lacking pork flavor desperately needed  ramen also felt if lacking salt  You're probably laughing fact just said What? Ramen? Lacking Salt? You're crazy Alex! back said flavors being one dimensional  added excessive amount soy sauce saltiness ramen tasted 10x better   THE VERDICT inferior amount pork which also extremely fatty bland broth just wasn't good  Stick Monta  tastes better cheaper  <EOR> This ramen shop isn't bad   But portions bit small price   bacon fried rice tonkotsu ramen tori karaage   price fried rice reasonable $7 00 flavour quite nice bit spicy kick but didn't give much plate   Same ramen served big enough bowl but bowl only half full two slices thin chashu bowl would say 90% fat   type melts your mouth either  ramen portion also very small pay extra $2 extra ramen  flavour broth quite good though but don't think would coming back awhile since portions small      The tori karaage big disappointment $6 50 three drumsticks wing just average size   dipping sauce okay but karaage itself lacking flavour   Whatever marinated made texture chicken mushy like   didn't all   deep fried long   won't ordering dish again     All all flavour tonkotsu broth bacon fried rice good but need put little more plate attract big eater me  <EOR> This place WAAAY better Monta   decor seating nicely done   music played always enjoyable Hawaiian Reggae Came looking good ramen place   servers great knowledge menu quick service every time     The Gyoza delicious   Buta Sen Ramen Kimchii Special both delicious!  Only complaint Chasu could've thicker cut   noodles perfectly cooked both times here   broth salty always came very hot bowls soups  <EOR> The place good pinch   garlic Fried Rice ok   don't think would order again   Tonkatsu Ramen good but nothing write home about   I'd prefer Monta Fukumimi   think Shoku gets lot overfow Bachi Burger   would way come but I'd eat again if wait long Bachi burger next door  <EOR> I love all ramen spots popping across Las Vegas Valley  located right next Bachi Burger corner Windmill Bermuda  noticed lot people milling around outside waiting seated    Lucky tummy line Bachi Burger  around 5 pm Saturday party two half seated right away   The restaurant small much other ramen spots town  long narrow room few tables bar seating  high chairs which huge plus us   To dismay already Lobster Miso Ramen main reason why wanted try place  waitress suggested Bacon Takana Garlic Fried Rice appetizer  good even baby liked it!  I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen side extra noodles egg  husband ordered Buta San Ramen egg  sure if taste buds overloaded salt garlic flavors fried rice but found myself gulping down water few spoonfuls soup  enjoyed broth but little salty side taste  Baby loved side noodles which he ate happily   I can't recall prices other ramen places town but felt Shoku Ramen Ya little pricier  Service very good  always water jug full   full when waitress asked if wanted to go box refused  She talked into taking ramen to go advised heat noodles separately broth don't soft  When hunger monster reared its head later evening very happy listened waitress  enjoyed ramen much more leftovers some reason!  I would come back again but hopefully try Lobster Miso Ramen! <EOR> Recently made visit Shoku seeing Tetsuro's update review getting ROTD felt would justice give another go   On second visit DRASTIC improvement everything except service because good gets    Had try Buta san again definitely change depth broth savory pork flavor almost smokey finish  consistency broth still  bit thin but all personal preference! noodles bit downfall last time replaced thicker noodle gives satisfying bite mmm!

I'm much fan Ramen but favorite spots around know entails good bowl Ramen     What intrigued Shoku Ramen Ya broth but unique ingredients came bowl   Ni Tamago something don't think ever US   Most Ramen places serve hard boiled egg less time consuming much easier make   However Shoku Ramen ya know time care taken egg!  soft boiled egg meaning egg yolk still bit gooey jelly like which love takes slow controlled temperature sure egg turns that   A+!    Another thing unique Ramen chashu done any other Ramen shop does exception char grilled smokey grilled flavor it!  something never Ramen thought smart unique!  adds whole new flavor bowl!  very memorable! Another A+!    Most times grade ramen based broth soup base   find MOST important since basically gives its kick stamina each bite!  didn't really Shoku Ramen ya   Don't wrong broth good flavorful but just didn't quite meet expectations other broths tried other places LA Hawaii      Even broth meeting expectations unique ingredients itself did which far exceeded expectations    now if all put ALL those into bowl I'd PERFECT bowl ramen  =D    Another memorable dish bacon garlic fried rice!  Fried rice ramen place?  Hell yea!  Ramen shops especially japanese owned usually BEST fried rice dishes!  Usually charshu porked used ramen which Shoku ya does but also adds garlic bacon which even better!  would definitely come back more fried rice!   I ended dinner scoop black sesame ice cream   Meh   wish more black sesame flavor less milky   know picky but Asia amazing black sesame ice cream simply because every bite burst sweet black sesame flavor!    I'd definitely come back place again especially fried rice! =D  Maybe add few other Hawaii local favorite side dishes menu?

Chashu   OMG disappointment    no melting mouth action ever  If anything more tough side just business  egg perfectly soft boiled but more salty side  only thing liked ramen noodles  cooked aldente nice bite thin variety like      Service although very friendly very spotty  instance   When gyoza given soy sauce tray when ramen came only brought 1 spoon flag down ask more water      Something else weird no toilet seat covers women's restroom    HAHAHA yea weirdo wanted include review  but isn't health code violation? idk       Right now Shoku bottom ramen list  really want try lobster miso ramen which main reason came first place but don't know when again   feel bad giving them low review but just weren't impressed    HOT TIP sure check specials' board   forgot   They couple interesting items kimchi ramen tan tan men   Also don't forget stamp card  <EOR> Okay because place close house couldn't resist giving MORE TRY!  4 year old goddaughter LOVES noodles decided would give shot   stopped Saturday afternoon pretty slow   ordered bacon fried rice buta san tonkatsu nitamago extra noodles   wasn't expecting much based past experiences but REALLY pleasantly surprised   The bacon fried rice BOMB!  eat all day   goddaughter did because she spicy bite   didn't believe first because didn't taste ANY spiciness but then bite really spicy   spicy bites super random entire bowl maybe 3 4 spicy bites   Still good!
