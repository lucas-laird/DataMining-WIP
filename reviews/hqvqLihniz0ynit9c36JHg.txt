Can't anywhere else know lol  seated immediately waiter took orders   For kbbq started two orders brisket  couple behind seated received kbbq meats before different waiter   trying keep cool because getting hungry haha  5 mins pass still no meat  think waiter finally realized table still pretty empty aside kbbq sides he came back asked if wanted anything kbbq ____ told waiting brisket he acted just ordering now guess just completely forgot brisket begin Well when brisket finally came all good  would give 2 5 quality taste  very bland nothing briskets other kbbq restaurants  ended just drowning sweet dipping sauce waiter gave us  season black pepper which guess thing because noticed other meats ordered later also seasoned black pepper  Eh don't even know really describe other just tasted odd very disappointed because usually order 4 plates minimum!  Later ordered beef chuck bulgogi beef tongue pork belly  Again taste just me  Just very bland  bulgogi probably favorite all meats ordered  didn't really pepper all over pork belly because coarse    For sushi portion ordered bunch nigiri uni unagi garlic tuna sweet shrimp scallop salmon  Uni garlic tuna good give small piece roasted garlic tuna  Everything else ok best but terrible  also some oysters friends few rolls which also ok   I did dessert also included! tried melon bar delicious   Overall service 4 5  waiter attentive changed grill whenever burning  other tables waiter also came few times help cook some meat also gave scissors cut pork belly since waiter forgot  Food 3 5 which really hate leaving kind rating because service good but just didn't taste much  still think would come back though try other stuff menu knows maybe brisket better second time around <EOR> Excellent customer service  greeted every worker restaurant  Mostly everything ate good  Love home made ice creaM sandwich! defiantly back because menu item   Only bad things 1 noticed menu wouldn't state item spicy but eat all because didn't want no waste charge  2 could clean little bit more  place little dusty  Overall give 4 star  again  <EOR> This new only KBBQ place Las Vegas!  come least ONCE month alone friend s      After Hwaro rejected serving being solo diner few years back quest very serious quest find decent affordable less discriminating AYCE KBBQ   Biwon relatively new stumbling upon them Hwaro refused business fortunate stroke serendipity   Biwon offers AYCE sushi KBBQ but only come Korean BBQ as different favorite sushi place     appetizers banchans tops!

Overall recommended Biwon friends family  great time  Service good just don't when throttle food down  <EOR> When saw AYCE sushi AYCE KBBQ location knew try place right away  biggest fear going into sacrifice quality because imagined only two options being good typically happens when pair two AYCE giants  visit definitely say surprised    To start things off really thought both quality meats sushi pretty high there  wouldn't far say amazing but definitely good restaurant offers both AYCE setting  only but price both included more affordable $21 00 basic menu   say highlight KBBQ brisket while highlight sushi garlic tuna which featured garlic chip top tuna very unique comparison other AYCE sushi allocations   meal also give traditional small Korean dishes house salad would receive any other AYCE KBBQ location which nice touch    The only word critique would really offer more staff duty  sat separate room which seemed hold everyone else decided dine day the restaurant several different rooms seating   While all tables concentrated into room would imagined least few servers minimum 2 attending all tables  Instead only server attempting tend everyone's needs  Another word advice falls into same category lone server least carry notebook write orders on  actually point during meal where server forgot items twice third try she brought wrong item  Honestly point didn't feel need ask correct order because already full    All all place very nice if craving both KBBQ sushi  aware probably full though before truly enjoy everything want but also testament tasty everything was    We back! <EOR> Wow  live Southern California where krbbq spots all over absolutely blown away Biwon  Skip all buffets strip head best meal your trip    KRBBQ Best Galbi period  Beautiful bone uncut heavily marbled well marinated short rib  Other stand cuts marinated rib eye thick slabs pork belly    Sushi Woah! no rice rolls delicious only 1 per person but 4 different kinds Etc Along KRBBQ Sushi also appetizers poki tataki chicken wings yakatori fresh Oysters!

Yup! Biwon     <EOR> I honestly say tonight worst experiences ever restaurant  What's worse restaurant actually good reviews yelp  waiter never introduced himself  No cleared table once  When dropped off food instead clearing trash just moved over placed food table  actually grab trash ask where garbage because 6 empty cans soda front plus dirty napkins  brother ordered rice twice never received it  Every time asked server something seemed though bothering him  time asked waiter over table waiter looked right ignored me  top all overhead hood fan didn't even work brother sitting smokescreen whole night  definitely recommend coming group 6 more all  seemed though because add 18% auto gratuity big parties paid less attention because tip no matter what  self work service industry seen anything before  experience ruined brothers birthday  People may read say oh just busy but sad truth wasn't  every intention speak manager but upset didn't want scene say something would regret  hope management restaurant read train staff customer service cleanliness tables serving  <EOR> Brought pop kbbq cherry thanksgiving Really chill place loved it Waiter very good being slow     im rn tho    n seems waiter forgot bout gang gang gang     smh 30 min later come tell bitch clocked n left <EOR> I'm never write bad review but would pass find something better  Came dinner while wasn't busy service slow  Once more people started coming service down drain completely  keep reminding staff things ordered  Waited  Reminded  Waited  Reminded  Waited  Reminded  check table faster food    As far food just alright  Overall won't coming back <EOR> Fav spot dine!! love both favorite foods all eat!

Ok she said universal rules state need finish your food when order all eat style   Remember she commanding attitude teacher principal teenager's parent    thinking she actually waitress serving customers restaurant   Well replied peacefully ordered dishes prices listed committing pay all eat which never mentioned 1st server lady took orders   know what? She turned around no apology even word saying something ok see    bill came amount wish pay   paid full $1 tips star review  Hope she learns lesson realizes she working service industry   Sorry owners hired her   If she owner thinks she power attitude good her  <EOR> All eat BBQ  ASK KIM! customer service amazing  She checks often your water never empty she super nice friendly good recommendations  sides good  corn cheese creamy eel roll well garlic butter squid bulgogi  17 95 plus 5 00 sushi too  includes dessert! <EOR> I place  place spacious  Service fast  19 95$ all eat lunch till 3 dinner 10  Very good price D <EOR> The all eat sushi awesome  spicy  just right  bacon sushi really good ordered twice  But all sushi great  shrimp lover really good  think found new sushi place  staff really pleasant efficient  Plate cleared fast glasses refilled fast  found new sushi place  <EOR> I idea AYCE Sushi KBBQ but quality okay me  Nothing really stood enough want keep coming back  environment pretty spacious clean nicely decorated! staff helpful well!

Totally coming back again! If could rate review 1000000 stars would! <EOR> Pretty fun place grill table options  $25 unlimited stream meats sides brought your table  Most meat pretty tasty some just so so but staff friendly price right! <EOR> It's okay  location right next Palace Station Teddy St  Parking plenty fairly easy find spot however little tight   The first thing noticed when walked into restaurant space  place huge  felt some sort lobby  While waiting party arrive sat waiting area bench where nails sticking girlfriend scraped cut ankle nail  notified restaurant manager nice quickly provided aid apologized also note kind enough entire meal comp'd matter  Food wise All eat KBBQ some sushi KBBQ  KBBQ itself okay mean   nothing different any other KBBQ place  didnt try sushi but friend plenty assume really good  thing am big cleanliness  noticed some air ducts really sticky dusty some even webs them  made food less appetizing when look there's bunch filth  Overall below average experience  maybe time night came but restaurant should 100% open close  <EOR> My girlfriend came Death Valley   Love food here! Definitely try all eat barbecue  portion each dish little bit much though  Try order bunch all once  Take your time  <EOR> Worst experience ever! fitness expo friends eat after  Worst experience female waiters  She rude kept leaving table  She left table someone else handle missed most orders  waited long food  when asked never put it  also problem payment where table payed yet missing receipt waiter kept leaving said just pay go  Ummm No! fault guys can't your job correctly  while handling situation counter she kept leaving come back just Butt leave again  Wow! never seen such lack management customer handling skills  Definitely coming back again  Food great also  trying order own meat waitress guys share first    even though hungry food best  Horrible service waiter management  Busser other guys seem friendlier  <EOR> All eat Korean bbq sushi?! Yes please!  Lunch AYCE BBQ + AYCE sushi addition $23 99 Dinner AYCE BBQ + AYCE sushi $29 99 For combination Korean bbq sushi  super cheap meat quality great  some complications sever orders coming 15 20 minutes later but understood everything made order but man hangry  waited almost 30 minutes sushi roll come almost 15 minutes rice paper they fresh super soft Aside food taking long reason why keeping 4 star review because when friends walked kept waiting host stand almost 6 minutes before someone greeted us  greetings waited additional 5 6 before asked many party where we'd sat  Customer service overall could better night but food still bomb <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  use 1 star cleanliness restaurant other place sad sad mimic could really good Korean food  arrived late 2am didn't know any other Korean restaurants open until realized later trip   husband Korean South if any living under rock last 50 years wants know   enter presume Korean female host welcomes us  He automatically speaks Korean she replies oh don't speak Korean which fine because she probably Korean adoptee just learned English  asked if anyone spoke Korean she says no sorry  Ok cool   fine  chose bbq sit bbq side  greeted looked Hmong waiter no offense Hmong people most friends Hmong however know western side states most Hmong ppl call themselves Lao Thai don't realize Hmong   it's midwestern thing   Anyway waiter approaches order chadolbagi sseumgeupsal  Which essentially really expensive sliced beef pork belly  He serves some kind lettuce salad banchan fish cake potato salad think radish kimchi some kind strange tasting dipping sauce  He lights grill throws meat right way  flipping kidding me? Anybody grills knows let heat first before applying food  course meat which btw no more would your local grocery store sticks pan burns  guy everytime turned down fire he would come turn back high heat  Then husband asked sesame oil salt pepper  Because if real Korean BBQ sesame oil dipping sauce rice lettuce wrap your meat in  least some soybean paste  But nope  guy says oh don't speak Korean husband said no sesame oil  Again guy says don't speak Korean  Didn't even listen  husband speaking English! don't sesame oil?! then guy finally gets brings sesame oil   Um no  vegetable oil salt pepper  said look vegetable oil  guy argues nope 100% sesame oil  don't eat it  5 minutes later he comes browner dipping sauce says oh 2 kinds sesame oil  Yup no that basically tasted watered down hoisin sauce salt pepper  also ordered marinated spicy pork idk y since first two sucked but ok  husband said marinade no more some soy sauce msg brown sugar mixed together  wasted over $60 eating left guy tip even though he quite ignorant  sadly mistaken if think eating authentic Korean food here  Save your money Chinatown other Korean restaurants Vegas which also review  <EOR> The first time came place around 2 3 months opened  don't remember exact day but sushi + kbbq buffet around $27 99 person  nice many menu options did enjoy having both sushi kbbq same time  Service quite good night overall pleasant experience    Recently decided again  When came noticed some customers waiting door when restaurant practically empty  three servers standing own circle chatting far away us  around 5 minutes group front seated  While still waiting anyone notice existence decided check menu  soon found didn't seem combined sushi + kbbq option anymore  Remembering kbbq pretty mediocre place last time decided leave place since weren't seated anyways  Right when door servers now stopped chatting them ran 'How many?'  Yeah right little late now bye Later night highly rated Gangnam horrible experience  check review Gangnam if decide find more story  <EOR> This place ok  around 4pm wasn't busy yet took awhile them seat then take order  service though good  food tasted great  bulgogi spicy pork tempura cow tongue rib eye spicy squid other things all tasted great  food quality give five portions awesome  three stars just because took long seating getting orders <EOR> Where begin if big group don't even bother calling them reserve  say reservation accepted  should say reservation small parties only  group 11 service fee included  Therefore service window bull crap  waiter came just pick left over dishes but doesn't ask anything else  Ever time ask order he say know scurries away  ordered few dishes other waiters brought faster then assigned waiter  ordered beer waited 15 mins  He forgot  Once he finally came collect dishes he remembered ran back beer minute  any reading don't recommend coming big groups  might well just any other Korean bbq  Better service better experience  <EOR> mmm mmm bitch  Samuel Adams dave Chappelle would  say dis shit str8 fire fam come see yourself    all jokes aside  food great  service  even  better <EOR> I usually don't off strip when eat but glad did  place excellent  All meat order nicely marinated  salad very good well meat  would definitely recommend place anyone  <EOR>
