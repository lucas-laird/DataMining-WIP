But now think rolls boring simple   Nothing tasted super fresh delicious   Last few times dragged friends hated it  memory popping sushi cherry all keeps score lowering  <EOR> I soft spot Sushi Factory  first AYCE sushi place tried  used LOVE coming here   but ever since Oyshi opened and closer house frequent place more often now    My boyfriend decided come tonight since haven't awhile   couldn't believe dead place was! When came before used packed least 15 20 min  But tonight  don't know if maybe because Halloween weekend what   but times sure changed!   The AYCE sushi still same   good variety rolls we Bank roll Westwood roll Olli roll 3 10 roll many other ones forget names of nigiri side items course green tea ice cream mochi dessert! bad AYCE price $25 00 but Oyshi definitely place beat    It bad 2nd choice <EOR> The reason am giving Sushi Factory 5 stars      A group five dinner tonight ordered all you can eat sushi   seated waitress mentioned something being $10 95 per person   thought nothing because when come usually order all you can eat sushi price $25 per person   Even $25 per person price reasonable considering no time limit annnnd menu includes ALL specialty rolls sides etc     So ordered specialty roll specialty roll   all quite delicious!  staff very attentive did hesitate continue bring more rolls timely fashion   At end evening brought bill couple people party thought mistake because cheap    and waiter told having special tonight   all you can eat    $10 95 per person    really!  He said offering Henderson location tomorrow 11 29 11 those people came tonight tomorrow would sending another offer end December another AYCE special!  Needless say bargain bill real! P    This pleasant way them reward existing customers attract new ones   Hopefully offer deal again near future   lookout  P <EOR> Gets worse every time     Good prices but service food usually suck   I'm saying food absolutely terrible because they've days but I'd rather pay more somewhere else where more sure happy food before even step inside pray them good day here  <EOR> I absolutely LOVE here!!  quality sushi fabulous!!  servers super nice fast!!  ratio topping vs rice sushi perfect not much rice    MUST check vast selection cut rolls though!!  Ask Takashi most popular ones he may design name especially if you're lucky! <EOR> Unaware good Sushi places side town finally settled location am ver pleased did so  Took younger brother first real sushi experience both great time  service great much more friendly personnable then expected  food expected if better $25 AYCE loyalty card exactly expected pay  <EOR> 6 years ago first only sushi spot Vegas  Haven't back 3 4 years  trying many other places around town brought few people All Eat extravaganza  Very glad did!!

Such wide selection great sushi! <EOR> I enjoy sushi everything sushi good sushi freshness flavor texture even people serve you   can't give half star star rating  let tell why  take different approach list just case employee reads decides help restaurant out   1 Service smile only takes 1 bad seed ruin whole crop  few times because friends enjoy place ? but service just doesn't fit any other sushi restaurant EVER to  says 60 minute limit menu  really must stick T because 60 minutes just ignore forget ordered   2 Flava flaaaav! Hit miss when comes freshness fish   Sometimes sometimes off   Whenever ordered AYCE anywhere else half orders 4 pieces instead 8 just because want taste everything   recession but ain't worth giving someone stomach flu worst!  3 HGTV Watch it! Give place face lift some paint decorations  Some traditional Japanese lamps always decorative  When friends eat we're 20 deep  tables middle restaurant put together they're uneven we're display everyone see  charging pictures next time   Hope helps everyone  isn't review knock place but give some constructive criticism because face it  Las Vegas everyone deserves good food good service  live DESERT people! Happy eating! <EOR> My visit Vegas included stopping thank Kat where ordered Shrimp Veggie Tempura $6 Japanese Lasagna also $6 husband able something he enjoyed Chicken Teriyaki bowl  came soup salad ate soup but didn't touch salad    No particular reason  all eat $24 but very full got    The Japanese Lasagna Yum Yum sauce which later told spicy Mayo     VERY good but shouldn't put much there  scraped off rest halfway through  When back Vegas definetly dine again   Only bad thing service  wasn't terrible just didn't come very often ordered before rest group came  food right before walked waiter came back maybe 20 minutes later but already done  thought they're supposed come sure everything alright  extra guest said ok there's always fast food lol  Gotta love great company  <EOR> This place used places  just because very convenient location works late The food quality almost average  the fish fresh would find Sushi Mon   The good thing all eat $25 then give card each time all eat stamp 9 stamps 10 th time free  as boyfriend sushi lovers   it wasn't difficult few those cards stamped   The owner nice too  but he kind moody one time would really friendly then other he's smth against you  <EOR> My favorite place Vegas!!!!!!!! When iI lived neighborhood 2 3 times week  While better sushi CANNOT price  many rolls 8 $4 25 rolled well if two rolls give free miso soup salad   4 dishes $9 00 total  Plus come know staff name they're great   Trans Friendly Yea def  Thai chefs they're obv cool rest   probably ok  <EOR> I eating sushi 20 21 years living  father spent few years living overseas Japan before born ever since could remember incorporated Japanese cuisine into otherwise American family menu  myself experienced different sushi making techniques past 8 years frequented many sushi restaraunts friends Osaka Japan end slim credentials     My wife Las Vegas recently honeymoon driving through back Utah California  catching showing Phantom Opera Venetian having only few dollars spare looked relatively cheap sushi place willing sacrifice ambiance save money    We stepped into Sushi factory greeted server Toshi  menu did rather medium large variety more enough average sushi consumer  pleasantly surprised quality freshness fish well price amount  service? Yes rather laid back but fitting  Toshi excellent waiter really enjoyed sushi insight   In short If don't want spend money pomp Like laid back environment Like leave full And enjoy sushi  Go sushi factory  <EOR> Sushi Factory first all eat sushi spots since 1999  haven't back since early 2000's    Since started eating ocean flesh again pay them visit Living Social Deal Discount    I ordered few nigiri items yellowtail Salmon red snapper  Both yellowtail salmon cut very thick which made little perplexed if thickness made chewy lack freshness   I would say skip next AYCE Sushi joint    <EOR> fucking delicious!  this absolutely best sushi ever had   all eat deal includes practically entire menu   looks pretty blah outside but upon walking happy discovery interior much cuter more spacious entrance would believe   rolls creative [Lisa Lisa squeal happiness] value great   only possible complaint waitress rarely came around   but busy stuffing face mind   i must reiterate fucking delicious! <EOR> Wanting take night off The Las Vegas Strip hubby discovered Sushi Factory hotel phone book   $24 95 per person all u can eat sushi?  Why not!  order spider roll sam's volcano roll oysters salmon skin hand roll miso soup   just money's worth   quality good but service very very S L O W   think purpose full don't order more sushi   Tip Order much sushi think eat wait all arrive before starting eat   worked me!  hubby wasn't fortunate spent lot time waiting sushi arrive   kids just ordered regular menu finished food long before us   Thank GOD brought Ninendo DS' play while waited finish eating  <EOR> I only willing try because roommate wanted sushi Goyemon 1 hour wait  Honestly would walked soon stepped but roommate friend wanted sushi asap  When walk feels bought location Mexican restaurant never changed decor plating  menus dirty didnt see any asian customers inside  I judge good asian restaurant many asians dining location  saw every ethnicity but asian! knew trouble lol  All ordered California roll wasn't good all  Probably worst California roll ever had  Worse ones buy prepackaged grocery store  EPIC NOM NOM FAIL!!!!!!!!!! If sushi don't come here  <EOR> BEFORE Surprisingly rated place 4! Before food service I'd say customer years! started off favorite sushi joints town until noticed customer service level remembered be   food also great where piled rice cream cheese into each roll! if yelper back then would given place solid 2!  AFTER year decided back see if any change   When walked noticed place painted definitely much better looking remember   did AYCE much love sushi don't know  use chopsticks Yes sad story  haha   always ask fork =   server came running back fork he some sort knight in shining armor which good sign because everyone usually forgets darn fork =    So food came noticed definite change become even better remember! service also wonderful  servers much more observant customer's needs just adorable!   *NOTE Another thing remember Ladie's Night Special Wednesdays where AYCE dinner lunch price! Take advantage ladies! another good thing open late! think til 3am? update times specials soon back <EOR> I pretty much come once year August softball tournament team  always seem good time enjoy rolls  comes less $30 p p all said done taxes drink easy bring large group  Sushi tastes fresh sure why getting such bad reviews that   only thing if picky servers could little more personality  Also last time made big deal bill because forgot charge ice tea  paying frantic correct left bill without taking money when returned said new bill because forgotten iced tea  nice thing added gratuity bill since party larger 6 8 didn't expect more tip that  even extra line credit card slip tip  probably continue return if large party future  Seems hard seated Vegas lot restaurants if you're large party  But place  Always seems empty some reason  <EOR> Service decent  Never ask refill water tea  Food good  don't rolls cause traditional sushi  More tailored people cringe seeing raw fish slab rice  ranking rolls  Sushi fresh though  sushi chef very personable  other chefs seemed way less personable  unfriendly but kind stoic  doesn't bother though cause just eat    Interior pretty drab  Could updated but okay if they're making money  No sense things extravagant   One waiters seemed disinterested serving but later very cheerful waitress   I'm giving 4 stars because thought food fresh nicely prepared decent portions  Again just sushi counter  Also comparing high end Vegas strip sushi top notch Japan places to    Great value I'd return again  <EOR> This sushi DISGUSTING  service horrible everything tried  tasted charcoal burnt  Sushi isn't just deep fried full cream cheese  even overcharged card $10!!  NEVER coming again! IF could give them no stars would  <EOR> This place is   hmm   in strip mall   looks bit rustic inside out   sat sushi bar instead table   chef cool very quick   Behind wall business cards kept attention remainder dinner did manage eat   My boyfriend all you can eat sushi   beef chicken teriyaki as eat anything lives water except seaweed    meal came miso soup small salad   miso soup pretty tasty!  small salad very basic but excellent ginger dressing atop it   entree looked really good when waitress served but began eat full fat both chicken beef    guess would okay if liked gristle fat but hate chewy stuff  it want puke   probably ate 2% meal including rice   boyfriend ate most rolls but later commented he didn't think ingredients very fresh   Overall chef cool   waitress very sweet attended very well   think restaurant itself could use good cleaning remodeling whenever chance but hell know? <EOR> What happened place  Used come all time  sushi bar closed ac seems bc they're using floor fans  came try $12 50 special ayce  10 people waiting front us  guy second line said he waited 30 min but line didn't seem would move anytime soon  peeked dining room am 5 unbussed tables  <EOR> Their Marchello roll shiznit telling you!

Finally she took order slip back chefs  hour sat down rolls began coming but if waitresses holding grudge against table  would drop off rolls without telling kind roll lot time didn't know  cokes refilled more flat coke  Very very frustrating  later found another friends same night rolls didn't order being delivered table  rolls?? Maybe     scratch that     VERY LIKELY restaurant less half full night  said rolls so so always  fish rice ratio favors rice   After night doubt coming back again  shame because prices very reasonable I'd customer while  But $12 50 AYCE really did paid for  <EOR> I came today take advantage 9 11 week long special deal  $12 AYCE    Never because assumed place wouldn't great damn right!   The rolls okay BUT when ordered eel nigiri absolute WORSE eel ever had! Disgusting!!! First all took over 30 minutes even when did dark hell overcooked point where some parts CRUNCHY eel itself supposed soft flavorful but wasn't any either  SUCH disappointment    The service okay  bit slow but blame sushi chefs that  chefs' sushi making seemed very inexperienced  rice seemed all falling off  Ugh   Overall coming back   Their regular AYCE sushi price $20+   laughable  reg prices should stay $12 because  much food really worth    <EOR> I LOVE place   Its very chill atmosphere good customer service   I'd recommend sitting bar but tables still good  always stop Vegas trips don't see changing any time soon   never needed reservation you're sat quickly your food comes fast   I only come all eat sushi $25 person why would anything else?!  sushi fresh tastes good comes fast there's no limit     place well worth your money considering 3 rolls anywhere else would already cost $25+ cost all other buffet all you can eat places Vegas   going say its best sushi ever although first time definitely top list but well worth money time   coming back again <EOR> love place!

Good thing business trip able charge trip expenses   Being such tightwad didn't matter if mine company's dime   2   quality fish gone down bit also added more rice much fish   think probably some cost cutting moves here   3   specials good nothing worth mentioning   At least some good things now offer raw oysters dinner if that    new offering poke pretty darn good! <EOR> Once sift your way through all Smith's shopping carts find pretty good little place beats battling parking Spring Mountain noisiness Nobu   would come special no special though 2 1 Asahi nights enough reason right but always fresh plus oysters!  Decor could use update yes but find yourself busy stuffing your face notice   At least able order sushi directly counter we didn't see server often more help couldn't hurt did few special requests other places didn't    Don't forget your stamp card gone through two! <EOR> Pros HUGE selection all you can eat menu Many items AYCE menu non sushi items Delicious innovative sushi rolls Spacious restaurant Open til 2am weekends Generally attentive waitstaff  Cons HUGE selection all you can eat menu If they're busy your food take forever Some fish obviously frozen If you're ordering lot 1 item they'll suddenly run next time order it  Generally good experience  family ate twice when spent holidays Vegas  First night Christmas night waiter seemed very new  Took sushi order once then never returned see if wanted anything else  literally stop ask if could order again he seemed surprised  WTF? all eat sushi babe  we're Japanese  needs more food mmkay? He confused order screwed w chef ended receiving some food but some other waiters and think owner stepped everything wanted more  more satisfied meal really can't complain  PLUS Christmas night  We'll let slide    Second visit 12 29 lunch empty  waitress quick attentive  ordered 16 orders hamachi and ate all before told now unavailable  Then saw table near receive few orders hamachi thinking trying screw wanted  Ordered more hamachi another waiter available again  Interesting! But all all another good meal    Despite little weirdness service we'll definitely back terrorize joint  <EOR> This place first popped sushi cherry all those years ago coming eversince when town but sadly noticed getting progressively worse  looking pretty people getting less friendly food isn't once was  other words used 4+ stars now 3 book    Come guys bout deep cleaning come jesus meeting your employee's  <EOR> for lunch break came wednesday lunch special 7 wed teriyaki chicken tempura 7 5 vegetable + 2 shrimp miso soup salad orange slices dessert  fast friendly service  having less half hour eat service point  food fresh  water refilled huge cup check given promptly! good portion  worth able last rest work day  don't feel full hungry  just right average taste  don't expect superstar flavor  place puts sushi imagine henderson SHAME teriyaki chicken lunch special  5 stars bc i'd come back again lunch specials! <EOR> we did all u eat here   girls love here   its nicer restaurant then eastern    sushi chefs friendly    few hawaii   always fresh yummy sushi rolls    <EOR> After hearing really bad really good reviews place decided give try   and came rather unassuming average review instead!   Sushi Factory located plain slightly seedy looking strip mall  Being East Coast know most good restaurants best neighborhoods excited   Decor also run down but terrible inside  tacky bit dirty but definitely inviting homey type way   Service average  ask waitress quite few times refill water but she always obliged often walked never disappeared  attitude rather aloof but she blessed smile couple times average rating she gets   We ordered some nigiri sashimi fresh oysters  wasn't mood for once eat lot   Fresh oysters say this? pretty fresh  didn't expect good but were  best any means but definitely tasty  Sushi edible tasty well however fish freshest presentation rather poor  Miso soup salad best part meal very good flavor them  Prices incredibly cheap sushi place   Overall may come back Sushi Factory but only because best friend lives across street  special trip many better sushi places Vegas   However if neighborhood craving some sushi running low money $$$$ stop experience Sushi Factory again  <EOR> I agree Shoe K    Please don't waste your time patronizing place  All you can eat yeah right   More All eat long uni ikura hamachi ama ebi etc  spot buddies would hit while Vegas but last visit forget it   service horrible   can't stress enough   only received first order sushi which included aforementioned uni ikura hamachi etc  subsequent similar order did receive   Waiters continually asking if someone taken order kitchen being cleaned again if someone taken order on   Total BS  <EOR> I going Sushi Factory couple years now love all u can eat menu however last 6 mos lowered price excluded some items such Screaming Orgasm  Otherwise sushi chefs especially weekend ones skilled clean food delicious! don't wait each time sit bar  <EOR> Pros give generous portions  Quality freshness always excellent when there  Amazing deals all eat ladies' night main reason why keep coming back!   Menu full unique different plentiful meals! prices high points all get!  Cons Service slow sit down dining room sushi chef shogun attitude little over top or some chefs just don't things personalized customers? waitresses forgotten items twice before   I've going SF since 2006  couple years back when first started going service wasn't slow dining room now others said if come hungry wanting hit plates back back sitting bar your best bet quick service   SF would much potential if some chefs eased little shogun attitude if better service  waitresses forget appetizers twice before forgotten realized mistake which made wait even longer items    Takashi owner such great guy speak with! Takashi some chefs around SF awhile ones most likely speak casually customers but otherwise new people they've hired over years could use some work customer service   I really hate give SF three stars because quality pricing really great deal sushi joint Vegas and owner unbelievably nice guy but really hope guys realize needs little more work chefs waitresses when comes service! <EOR> Is even sushi? since friend work raved good sushi is  thought place probably worst sushi long time  prices pretty high food quality sub par best  all eat dinner special $24 95  paradise roll mountain roll daves roll  wasn't bad but definitely way better  If best rolls then say back ever again  only good thing sushi don't give ton rice nigiri however fish quality horrid compared other all eat places  tuna nigiri warm pink!? thought really weird  don't place  really need over design consultant revamp sad restaurant  waste time money  here  <EOR> Wanted try different sushi spot instead norm sushi spots hit decided here  Walked n decor cool n scenery look comfortable n inviting  lady greeted n asked if would table sit @ sushi bar decided bar  walked over n 2 chiefs busy sides n left older sushi chief nobody side sat down ordered  ladies served drinks n brought other dishes very good service n friendly  Long story short sushi took Forever sushi okay sushi chief really slow ladies service good  Wife sick later night n Going Back all  <EOR> I met some friends visiting Tucson used eat prior moving AZ  contemplating trying new place going old faithful sushi factory which familiar with  said sushi factory mood try new place run chance sucking just wanted knew fast!   We AYCE yes all eat sushi  good rolls nice generous selection options   I tend order half rolls try many problem    You food eat your fill sushi  service guys behind bar making your rolls attentive however friendly never smile talk other thank almost door    I friends shoot shit but could stop looking staring amazement permanent frowns sushi guys faces  just odd never seen anything before    We always sit bar freely order without having wait waiter waitress take orders dining area well    The best quality sushi?
