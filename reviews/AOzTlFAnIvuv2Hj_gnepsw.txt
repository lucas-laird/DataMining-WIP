They also no honey biscuit requested she replied never honey but order should couple days   It just worse second honestly should just said forget drove off   I inquired why little chicken prepared why no sweet tea   She replied late don't much chicken Hmmm 7 30 pm late???? Wow  She also informed sweet tea popular fast  I replied well wouldn't good idea check more often sure being made rather waiting until empty available customers   She just kept saying late said basically should visit around 7 30 late want?  She then asked team lead major attitude explain why everything wanted  She just said she ain't know why but call next day talk somebody if want? did call next day just issue complaint explain happened  met more attitude rushed off phone   I can't believe crew serving customers   This Popeye's location pathetic big disappointment  just don't care  <EOR> Just saw they've finally opened! place actually came pretty fast  located Decatur Flamingo  through drive thru morning service excellent  lady other side speaker super nice friendly  When approached window smile very contagious!
