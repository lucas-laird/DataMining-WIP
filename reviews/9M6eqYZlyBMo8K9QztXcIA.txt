All all ok  Probably won't return   Having just wanted home since way better!  Note crab legs frozen   Mine just plain old resulting rubbery texture meat filling shell  owner took them back complaint bit disappointing   shrimp good size 24 30U think  No tiger prawns but decent  <EOR> The place ok   nothing ordinary   many cajun crab place would think would awesome   Don't wrong food nice definitely applaud decor restaurant looked well kepy clean   staff friendly didn't bother much   menu extensive found bit ordinary   guess hoping find something outregeous meaning good but everything looked average     Not sure if would back   not because awful but just something experience wow me!  But encourage people try form own opinions believe establishment say    beauty eye beholder    think opinions going all over board based prefence   If looking wow menu perhaps may want try another venue but if youre looking decent good food nice clean environment place   = <EOR> Cravin' Cajun nice setup  food good but great! still prefer Hot n Juicy over Cravin' Cajun  food bit salty service bit sour  think owner he just needs new waiters  would again year give them time refine things  ordered crawfish snow crabs waitress only brought snow crabs   She failed confirm entire order  When she finally brought crawfish rushed cooked all way  bags come oversized wasn't enjoyable dig into hot juicy  layout resturant nice theme decoration nice  hope next time better job service hope ease off salty ingredients  <EOR> 3 1 2 stars   Some time ago when friend Angela moved took favorite places eat Vegas   Hot N Spicy Crawfish   She loved it   Well night driving around deciding where eat drive Cravin' Crajun's billboard   She mentions place opened prior's competition though she's never been   decide give try   Place pretty spacious clean   seated order fried calamari pound shrimp pound snow crab legs   mild spices lemon flavor shrimp specialty sauce crab legs   The calamari comes 1st honestly pretty terrible   1 2   Definitely would never order again   Seriously disappointing   Batter thick calamari overcooked   The main food comes big plastic bags share shrimp crab legs   They're pretty damn good   Both lemon house sauce really tasty   flavor less intense Hot N Spicy Angela actually liked sauce better because spicy    Lots garlic bits both actually tons garlic bits both found myself wishing some bread sop left over sauces     So overall definitely good experience would definitely come back here   There's no doubt mind given some more time experience place hopefully step really great eating experience definitely rival Hot N Spicy  <EOR> I'm allergic shellfish reviewing mom boyfriend's point view   They thoroughly enjoyed bags  Mild Cajun Shrimp Cajun Fries  very seasoned portions huge shrimp succulent mild spicy enough    I ordered Catfish while dove bags shrimp enjoyed mine  good Cajun flavor but tad bit salty   Service could better too  Dined twice already different servers both seemed stressed distracted serving us  Maybe need few more servers they're all going crazy? Both times waited extremely long food refills beverages check too  But rating food give 4  <EOR> Please even walk into restaurant  Once walk service horrible  don't even ask many just stare pretend busy    When family walked waited 30 minutes just waiting seated! never interacted just stared  left  seriously worst customer service ever! Trust want walk into restaurant  even worth it  <EOR> I cravin' over Cravin' Cajun sometime now   experience shallow water crustaceans limited only bad buffets   wanted experience real deal   GF drove across town give shot   It true atmosphere hints very fun place   When during witching hour between lunch dinner   Things pretty quiet   After having seated taking look menu GF Gumbo bag Procambarus clarkii Cravin' Cajun medium seasoning   When bag bottom feeders arrived dawned did truly know  devour little guys   Though CC kind enough give bib no provided knowledge eat   GF then pulled smart phone quick search tutorial found internet  then commenced pinching pulling sucking  after few minutes let GF started doing same crawfish   All all fun messy experience   probably could eaten three bags but hands would grown tired   bonus overpriced sliver pecan pie bought but spell yelp bodies those eaten  <EOR> This boyfriends new favorite seafood place! restaurant definitely much better looking Hot n' Juicy more spacious well  Besides food very tasty best all overpriced! server Maddie very attentive friendly  drinks always filled! She really made feel home  honestly no complaints throughout entire lunch  I'd definitely recommend place anyone looking some yummy affordable seafood Las Vegas  <EOR> Cravin' Cajun new place crawfish!  Place very spacey around 12 tvs throughout    awesome! I couldn't really help but compare place Hot n Juicy since frequent lot guess am kind biased  place kind Hot n Juicy    except fancier!   However place definitely larger selection foods Hot n Juicy  crawfish cravin' cajun both medium crazy hot  don't think mastered sauce yet since medium really no flavor except spicyness but crazy hot lot flavor it  also catfish po boy which tasted just filet o fish except   fresher  corn also isn't sweet hot n juicys  server also super duper nice very attentative  Anywhos if you're near area want try something new place!  Po Boys $9 11 Etouffe Jambalaya Gumbo lobster bisque $12 13 Dessert philly cheesecake peanut butter cream pie key lime pie red velvet cake $4 6 <EOR> Yup  there's no wait  and there's reason that   the food isn't all great   Seafood in a bag seasoning tasted salt lick   If cut back sodium would able better describe food but tastebuds numb all salt     My S O  really liked grilled fish plate  matter fact he ordered two plates     If try grilled plates pass rest  <EOR> The day craving hot n juicy crawfish but friend told new place town good gave try  restaurant big when pretty empty but lot staff   We seated booth look menu asked server give some samples sauce before order  just tried mild medium mild quite spicy  lot spicy oil sauce    We ordered few lbs shrimp 1lb crawfish 1lb clams  All lemon pepper sauce mild   sauce called lemon pepper but didn't really taste any lemon server told sauce garlic? butter base  garlic butter forgot   I sauce but shrimp overcooked   clams little because shell really heavy    Overall restaurant okay but Boiling crab opening Vegas Flamingo Decatur     Cant wait !! <EOR> Hot N' Juicy another contender look for   Where don't quite Hot N' Juicy flavor seafood really kick few notches terms friendly fast service attention detail decor expanded menu terms variety compared Hot N' Juicy   Service food came fast!  Drinks came quick!  Waters drinks refilled even when semi busy Friday night   Food There's lot variety choose but stuck usual    Cravin' Cajun style shrimp comparable Hot N' Juicy's Special Sauce but spicy   Somehow tasty tangy addicting but still very enjoyable  Lemon Pepper shrimp Corn Also comparable Hot N' Juicy but lacked some sort addictive ingredient   MSG?  Heh  Deep Fried Catfish Basket Now where at!  prefer catfish preparation because thin slice fish optimal crunchy breading per fish ratio   tartar sauce served along side perfect!  Extra tart creamy  Deep Fried Oyster Basket Little nuggets juicy deep fried oysters   Yum  Cajun Fries tasty crunchy   Equivalent tastiness when compared Hot N' Juicy but downside soggy sitting own steamy heat   easy solution that Just eat all quickly!  Problem solved soggy fries   Bonus! Extra seasoning shakers available BAM heck anything    Bonus 2! thoughtful addition sinks just outside restrooms gives patrons convenience being able quickly run over wash hands  Bonus 3! for man Big variety all kinds beer  Conclusion just opened week ago think LOT potential place   There's still MANY dishes try dessert jambalaya ettouffee crabcakes   might just bypass Hot N' Juicy's lines wait Cravin' Cajun  <EOR> Guuurl!
