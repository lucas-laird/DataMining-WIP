Service efficient course helpfully upselling   However double drink full double price dig it   Cost everything else Vegas bit pricey but place isn't going break bank   Overall A OK joint   Probably better place drink appetizers but still bad full meal if people your group prefer casual more bar like atmosphere  <EOR> We visited restaurant numerous times always happy it  usually order salmon always delicious  continue returning would recommend it  outside table always good see what's going outside  <EOR> While looks neat bar review based restaurant experience  other reviews accurate when say service leaves something desired  party three sat 15 20 minutes before server finally noticed us   Started baked Brie which tasty bourbon soaked cherries balsamic drizzle set off nicely    The herb grilled chicken looked promising but came dry glaze almost saved but quite  Couldn't bring myself try mushroom muffin but order mushrooms side helped    The lamb stew decent flavor but more soup very little substance shepherds pie overall unimpressive which saddened hype other customers   Creamed corn much heavy cream closer tapioca anything else lack any other spice including salt made texture strange overall inedible    Take home story come booze live music  many other options food tolerable but worth seeking out  <EOR> Sitting worst restaurants eaten long time  Made dinner reservation 4 seated table would seat 2 people nicely basically bar   Bar patrons talking st high bar table next us   Horrible service  started going bar own drinks  Beer cheese dip runny thin somewhat stale bread   Rustic tomato soup absolutely puréed tomatoes can  Afraid $47 entree bring  Definitely mistake eat here  planned nice evening friends   Disaster  <EOR> Fantastic Experience!  hostess Gaby nice set great table outside near band  server Celeste top everything made sure meal paced nicely weren't rushed  Everyone restaurant friendly dedicated ensuring great experience  Loved food!  We'll definitely visit again when traveling Vegas! <EOR> This place actually pretty awesome strip hotel bar   few weeks ago hoping some decent brew prices place chill fit bill completely   Bartenders friendly good service beers reasonably priced Vegas atmosphere very social   TVs watch various games comfortable atmosphere beer cheese dip appetizer surprisingly delicious   Wisconsin when you're know your cheese but stuff REALLY good   also just mood snack turned plenty filling   When you're down anyway spending gobs money all sorts entertainment place pretty good stop slowdown action   Good down earth feel highly recommend   normally reserve five star reviews something spectacular but between all bars clubs Vegas including other Irish bars restaurant actually made feel better most give some props  <EOR> I really enjoyed atmosphere able create very spacious 2 story Irish pub midst gaudy New York New York casino Las Vegas   Though does seem somewhat artificial corporate themed restaurant hired customer insight specialists put together mass consumer beer drinking target demographic would expect Irish themed bar doesn't mean doesn't appeal average party gastropub going fans   Besides you're Vegas places scrutinize every detail anyway?    I seated upstairs semi private table corner bar full local Irish 4 person band playing delight crowd   hostess took upstairs pointed 9 busts heads think owners restaurant   whole description them somewhere menu side but didn't bother read it   excellent selection beer cocktails which would seriously disappointing if didn't     For appetizers whole selection standard gastropub food then some   If lived could see myself coming trying meat pies sausages just meal itself accompaniments beer   But since wanted try something different opted beer cheese dip   interesting serve different types bread which gives variety textures   dip itself combination 4 cheeses which blended into cheesy salty range flavors   good but 3 4 bites enough   Something mixing many cheeses together didn't sit well opted munching breads sans cheese instead   For main dish shepherd's pie which favorite things eat   ok whipped potato top light fluffy ground beef which cottage pie actually underneath flavorful hearty   would definitely recommend dish stouts wash down   Looking other tables want come back try chicken pot pie   Service really good too  <EOR> The lack authenticity par rest Vegas  But Vegas authentic its own Vegas way  authentically Vegas    Located New York New York inside part restaurant supposed look Irish pub but looked Irish pub would look if Disneyland  sat patio which great night because pretty good view strip still pleasantly warm without sun burning your skin off    Was food good? pretty decent better then expected  overpriced was? Yes course was  But still enjoyed it The table enjoyed appetizer beer battered Irish sausage Guinness mustard dipping sauce  okay personally bangers little meatier less squishy    My boyfriend decided split Shepard's Pie which serve bake metal bucket thingy  enough food both $18  still think mom's Shepard's Pie tastes better but she's really British course home cooking always better  However some other members party steak which crusted Blue Cheese around $26 everyone raving it    People enjoyed Guinness Murphy's Harp more  definitely good place things tap Vegas  However serve wimpy half pints same price regular one  Kind sad   We fun only wait 30 minutes table party 7  live music real live Irish dancer tapping could heard filtering through bar onto patio where sitting   I would probably come back split Shepard's Pie again because enough food half price! <EOR> good made feel Dublin   Drunk now update soon  =D <EOR> First night Vegas very long flight really flight but delays San Jose  arrived Las Vegas    90 minutes later expected    already made reservations Nine Fine Irishmen but constantly push back due delays    Finally hotel just threw bags floor didn't even change wash anything because absolutely famished!
