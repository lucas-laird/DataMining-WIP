The server does bring food which nice but very capable picking counter if its gonna 4 bucks extra that  giving extra large drink when eating doesn't help either  Personally don't even lot drink when eating because uses space stomach saving substance  might've stayed longer finished eating but weird smell couldn't over  fact give big cup kind indicates know people feel robbed but   they anyways  Bad call opinion  just many other good places around  location isn't great  there's really no reason see through all other great places said surprised if place doesn't close soon   Also cashier asked if wanted give change donate  When said no almost she annoyed that  wonder where change actually goes    The only reason give 2 stars instead 1 because SUPPOSEDLY support first responders   if  great but maybe focus staying afloat before doing that  <EOR> The subs great  unlv student little time eat  employees friendly!!! <EOR> Excellent subs friendly staff good prices   Only knocked star because took little longer expected kid making sub looked he would rather anywhere else but work   Loved games TV  <EOR> I've told Firehouse subs delicious   Finally around trying meatball sub sub supposed known for  I'd say best ever had  loaded even looked delicious  <EOR> Firehouse subs always delivers excellent sub sandwiches but  why writing now  Jacob took order type person experience  He reason keep going Firehouse Subs  interacted maybe 30 seconds 30 seconds compelled come write this  eye contact genuine demeanor guy personifies incredible guest service  hope Firehouse helps climb corporate ladder before lose another company realises he's special  Keep being great thanks again Jacob! <EOR> Cool location takes while your order but they're always really busy   It's great place lunch some friends hang out  Food quality superb they've never once any ingredients staff nice friendly  <EOR> So calling order myself co workers convinced colognes best hot sandwiches   When called placed order gave them cologne order first then placing order because asking special instructions mine lady phone telling ordering turkey bacon ranch told understand order sandwich all time never problem she continue question preference way order food saying well am owner  turkey bacon ranch sandwich substituted turkey pastrami don't cheddar asked Swiss Cheese still being told  sandwich made gave trying place order just put order co worker        restaurant pick order she the owner didn't even put phone order she said because didn't give phone number but told name told way pick she ones but yet order put still try put order person again OWNER again kept giving hard time wanted eat going eat gave just said f*** lunch today since only 20 mins left before lunch over    The morale all never question much food going eat going pay own money didn't any better tone approach rude never again just continue going firehouse house where sandwich always done being questioned   <EOR> Must go!!!!!
