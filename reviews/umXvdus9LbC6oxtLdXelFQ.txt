Watching desserts being made best part!!! takes minute your dessert but worth  !! <EOR> One best dessert experiences had  Sit bar if possible watch chefs  wait 30 minutes before being seated but well worth it  attention detail extraordinary made vain  ordered desserts la carte rather course sorbet did regret decision  also extensive tea collection enjoyed oolong variety    I'd recommend coming couple small group larger groups may take while accommodate  <EOR> It's first time there    sat counter    Service good place clean but saw picture girl kept giving free stuffs eat if Japanese if talked Japanese    WHAT?

ordered two course dessert pairing chose blueberry champagne ice cream amuse Ringo main dessert  blueberry champagne pairing worked quite nicely Ringo reminded apple turn overs child  would recommend ordering apple green tea complemented dessert extremely well  edible embellishments Ringo both visually stunning quite tasty  Overall Sweets Raku definitely worth try! <EOR> The dessert shop where literally eat menu   What say place hasn't already said?  place gorgeous delectable desserts   literally dessert show   try come back often can   They've started selling Asian style cake rolls Swiss rolls different flavor each week so   Japanese cherry blossom flavor TDF   Even dessert expertly prepared order wrapped care   love place try bring everyone know here  <EOR> Sweets Raku located same plaza Kilroy's Monta Ramen other eateries  confuse Sweets Raku Raku  Sweets Raku specifically located right next door Trattoria Nakamura Ya large spoon right next front door    My husband arrived around 8 45 pm last Friday  2 seats available bar where wanted sit reading reviews wanted sit see chef assembling order   chef behind bar just stared but did bother acknowledge offer seat ask if would sit down    just odd moment us  Then female sever came asked if could just sit there  She hesitated first said could    sure why big deal sit there   But anyways sitting bar rather cramped  woman sitting right hand side undesirable odor rather off putting during time here  husband both some trouble getting seats well just because lack room    It took some time someone bring menu sat down first female employee eventually let sit bar did bring menus chef behind counter just kept ignoring great first impression   Eventually male server came brought menus told special $15 dessert set comes raspberry sorbet choice dessert  But if just want purchase dessert own then would $12  Then he left came back 2 plates edible menu  menu itself no taste but supposed dip sauce bring you  visit apricot sauce    After looked over menu ended ordering Dessert set $15 prior tax mentioned earlier came raspberry sorbet  sorbet refreshing  reminded sorbet tea rooms serve between courses cleanse palate  dessert picked Stella which  strawberry tiramisu  dessert artfully plated which tell someone right craft truly perfected display  dessert pretty good but am sure if worth $12 on own $15 part dessert set     Liver Pate $7 prior tax husband wanted something savory decided this  liver pate really good but 6 pieces bread enough  although bread warmed perhaps toasted as saw chef place oven front us didn't taste was  when asked male server if could more couple next also ordered liver pate extra bread instead us  didn't even bother ask more  soon chef gave them male server came right away said he told wanted bread  husband chef's attention some more bread which eventually got                          Total= $23 78 includes tax Although did food service nearly nonexistent  little place 12 seats available bar 4 small tables 3 servers floor two employees kitchen chef  Two female servers just chatting away among some restaurant patrons which assume must regulars   male server really only working serving others taking orders down removing plates  since he really only really doing job may reason why he wasn't very attentive us  But when asked check servers just quick move   Even beautifully plated good food can't save place good rating  Service HUGE part dining experience truly break your night  since celebrate birthday early truly disappointed treated  place overly hyped overly priced  overall rating place stands 2 stars    By way unisex restroom  Although other previous yelpers may mention cool felt bit confused when in  literally thought myself 'I'm confused just want pee' honestly really thought that   also did sink water just splashes all over floor must pain clean floor walls     And also ovens facing bar doesn't anything except heat things because everything already cooked  All chef really does place items ovens warm them but even then items don't come warm hot time you assemble your dish especially if order dessert   all more just show nothing else  <EOR> Sweets Raku destination dessert place  Want quick dessert fan dessert isn't place you  But those love creative fun sweet treats place delight   It's small space may wait especially if larger group  walk right seated 9 30 Thursday folks waiting most time there  all white space including kitchen bar  Seat bar if watch them desserts   There only 5 dessert choices best way them prix fixe  Each theme marvelous  angle cake round mound edible halo wings  designs simple but playful   the prix fixe consisted of edible menu dipped raspberry sauce amuse sorbet gelee choice dessert tiny chocolate molton cake tiny marshmellows rum raisins  apple pie shaped apple another dessert looked meatball covered spaghetti    We also caviar service which good but top notch  use farmed caviar didn't mention until served  weaker flavour real caviar  But delight layer egg onion caviar tiny bread puffs   They excellent cappuccinos  also wine pairing desserts   The space wheelchair accessible very good lighting  servers very sweet if rather soft spoken   Truly magical place worth trip off strip  <EOR> I am huge dessert person  fact would venture say could give desserts rest life okay  being said Sweets Raku made dream desserts trying them back November yes 5 months ago   set sitting sushi bar if sit counter full view everything pastry chef that's they're called right? doing  All

Well most everything least    So first off edible menu    it's basically rice paper which awesome itself but gave apricot dipping sauce when went  changes server told currently apricot which favorite fruits! Score!   I three course dessert prix fixe which isn't badly priced honestly  Although wouldn't spend $19 dessert normally all time but once while if any upscale restaurant then really honestly bad all    Started off raspberry sorbert which presented perfectly plate fun watch them plate everything techniques use  Typical Japanese sorbert least again grew Japan wasn't sweet basically perfect amount sweetness!   The Stella almost pretty eat  mean stunning look really just would satisfied staring but alas gotta eat some point!! creme use wasn't overpowering didn't take away fruits  tiramisu strawberries delicious  think might popular dishes well could tell why just presentation taste matching presentation just shows craftsmanship top line!  And finally creme puff alright nothing superb bread part hard tastes  when soft but creme inside pretty good wasn't super sweet  gelatin cubes cute!! Reminded candy always used called cube while growing Japan    The servers mostly Japanese speak your typical FOB English but isn't bad  sure wouldn't mind if wanted try practicing your Japanese them  <EOR> I haven't found place North America compares Sweets Raku  brightly lit dessert bar friendliest staff instagram worthy desserts only look good but taste AMAZING! dessert Disneyland me  happy support business this   Their menu changes seasonally which fun interesting  Throughout several times visited similar styles desserts but always different flavors  love seasonal panna cottas soufflés just everything  Sometimes when read description flavors desserts sounds much wonder flavors taste all together     but just all works   Try seat bar half fun watching them prepare all desserts!

Decor Structure Everything covered completely white white tables white counter top white work space  Okay guess it''s just safe say pretty much stepped into heaven    There's 2 4 top tables 1 2 top table available sit it may just 2 total rest sitting bar runs around working area where watch them magic  8 8 30PM ish Friday  guess came just time because soon leaving line looping around door    This may sound weird but if chance   check bathroom!! going tell why just it  Service Service exceptional would expect nothing less  When first sit down give hot towel course traditional Japanese custom  come back repeatedly your table always checking see if your glass full very accommodating anything may need  Menu They offer 3 different kinds specialty water shipped straight mountainous waters Japan  No joke  filled ions aid minerals aid just purest form  comes large bottle take straight 'refrigerator window display'  $4 bottle which really isn't bad when compare small tiny bottles Dasani buy casinos strip even Starbucks  started all 3 bottles tasted all same except purest but hey if you're water connoisseur might really enjoy selection   Now important part desserts  start probably already know place menu front because read other reviews edible already began tearing pieces off putting them mouth  Well tastes exactly think menu would taste    paper  coiled wrapped thin candy cane ring  delicious! pretty much hardened burnt sugar reminded lot creme brulee  Well server came back saw already began chomping away gave we're actually supposed dip waited  raspberry syrup honestly didn't taste much better but definitely very interesting!  They offer set menu $20 order la carte  Each dessert la carte $12  set menu didn't really sound appealing since figure first last course would probably more tasting experience  just interested main course which option order la carte  wish could into detail each dessert ordered total 3 but fancy feel menu changes often really experience yourself  thing say if there's strawberry shortcake menu ahead skip that  nothing spectacular  If still offer angel cheescake ? cheesy sounds tasted made heaven  Hehe see did there?

Very pleasant nice smiley staff  dessert spot you  Everything precut pre baked but build desserts demand  example your cake few layers they'll put together they're creating art piece  very cool watch  Kinda sitting sushi bar sushi chef putting building your omakase dinner but w desserts instead! menu made edible wafer later rip eat fruit sauce give you  sauce good but menu wafer wasn't really anything but just fun idea!   Drinks serve wine and maybe other alcoholic beverages didn't pay much attention tea! portions pretty small though  pot per person terms serving size  tried apple green tea peach black tea  sweetened  liked both!   Desserts decided 3 course dessert yes dinner already  just main dessert entree  prix fixe started off small dollop mango sorbet  just ok  huge fan sorbet begin with  main dessert entree tried he Strawberry Tiramisu Angel Cake some pear thing   5 choices think  Hard choose  Strawberry Tiramisu didn't really taste imagined Tiramisu experiences past BUT good!! little cake bottom amazing  don't any other descriptive words use  side drizzled w some mousse cream? good!! fruits  5 star dessert presentation! Angel Cake 6 star presentation! looks Angel! Halo White Chocolate wings  cream cake very light yummy  Strawberry Tiramisu probably 0 5 stars better Pear but still very worth good  third course cream puff your choice vanilla chocolate custard choice fruit filling  Pretty good  If came again though could without 3 course thing jump right main dessert entree!  Prices Main dessert entrees $12  Three course dessert $19  Tea $4 50  would say bit heftier price but terribly high totally worth it!  Overall think desserts very suitable Asian palette  see parents liking it  normally ok regular desserts but times does heavy rich  HERE!!

Can't wait that   The strip mall where Sweets Raku located now Asian culinary center universe Raku Monta Ramen Japanese Curry Zen Big Wong Nakamura Ya Kabuto   You idea eat those places then stroll over Sweets Raku finish off memorable evening  <EOR> When walked place thought wrong place  glass wall two rows various wines  Pretty but tiny       standing LONG time  wish seats least pillows sit on  normally prefer sit but stand 30 minutes       lady said she table ready but 20 minutes later she said time sit down  Being 5 people thought didn't order anything but every person tip automatically included   The desert exceptional presentation beautiful  Service great once seated  recommend people ready long wait  sure wear tennis shoes something comfy because you're long wait great dessert! <EOR> Sweets Raku very calm refined delicate atmosphere it  could turn off some looking casual place relax chat friends    The menu simple light did mention edible? Espresso ok but expecting something wow bit more seeing coexists nature business  Desert never big thing place just didn't quite excite palate  ordered baton which new experience pistachio cream chocolate fruit base all wrapped light delicate cookie  flavors subtle weren't overpowering but think leave place dessert lovers  service exceptional although communication could sometimes issue difficulties understanding waitress when she describing menu  <EOR> mind BLOWN  sweets raku totally shaped future dessert experiences   I know only when say quality taste experience beyONd point! simple bright welcoming atmosphere  selection menu enticing because want try all them  staff interactive just excited see your reaction your dessert activate whatever feature comes your choice   I wine glass choice where she put melting jelly top thin decorative chocolate melted inside glass  shame being able name all ingredients inside choice but honestly tell most delightful decadent blend raspberries mousse chocolate could remember  ready round 2    be adventurous satisfy sweet tooth  should here!! <EOR> Sweets raku very disappointing   place bookmarked over year finally chance try place two weekends ago  family came eating restaurant Chinatown decided dessert  came very odd hour place empty    The hostess only seats when entire party seated  wait until other half party show up  But some reason hostess seated another party when only two party there  sure why wait when didn't    Note $12 min per person    can't really share   The desserts look more delicious tastes  2 course dessert where seasonal dessert main dessert $15  seasonal dessert pineapple mango sorbet  pineapple sorbet favorite! mango sorbet little sour   ichigo rikyu mars  ichigo looked most normal dessert but best menu! mars very bitter taste because brandy  trouble eating let alone finishing this  favorite but very entertaining watch them pour hot brandy melt chocolate  rikyu basically green tea spaghetti! Very spongy if green tea then recommend this  green tea sesame seed little disappointing   desserts tastes all all very average  chefs great job presentation but taste could better    Overall $15 dessert overpriced me  time deal try   <EOR> Maybe expectations place just high because love Raku because all good reviews read here  However having twice now last few weeks forced recognize Sweets Raku mostly hype very little substance   Sweets Raku does some strengths absolute best feature layout décor ambiance  fun cute place open kitchen design dessert preparation fun show  aspect restaurant love  And don't forget check sink bathroom  Unfortunately disappointing first word comes mind when think food  Perhaps Mt  Fuji dessert epitomizes problem approach dish looks absolutely stunning when being prepared chestnut mousse being separated into strands layered over cream cake then topped chocolate powder accented crunchy wafers  But when eat just tastes any old chestnut mousse sponge cake  There's no depth flavors texture other sensations nothing interesting going on  when visit dessert specialist expect something amazing just any old dessert might average meal some average restaurant   And  problem Sweets Raku  If don't care open kitchen watching dessert being prepared right front then frankly you're much better off heading gourmet Strip restaurant getting dessert I know several Strip restaurants including Michelin starred spots seat even if you're only ordering dessert many more let order dessert only bar you'll pay same would Sweets Raku boot   The worst part all both times come party agreed Mt  Fuji best dish  If consensus best dish something think tastes mediocre      oh well  think Red Rock close second although maybe only because liked yuzu marshmellow   Service also very spotty  both visits courses paced particularly well also left waiting long time check  Also visits ask twice hot water refill tea still never it  Some staff lot difficulty speaking English which could contribute some interaction difficulties sure hard understand sometimes exactly we're being fed  <EOR> Its first time love it  desserts delicious  desserts front while wait  cocoa puff strawberry jam chocolate mousse  fricken good recommend dessert place 100% <EOR> Whenever looking dessert only place could recommend someone   highly recommend sitting bar because where all action is   You first hand experience chefs making amazingly beautiful taste dishes!  very interesting watching chefs work anticipation even hungrier    I also recommend going early because late line   early dinner live little dessert first before dinner   could cool place but just experience it! <EOR> The presentation bakery entertaining! plenty desserts choose all them served fashion  servers friendly made great recommendations fantastic customer service  Great place first date hang quick end night  very small great large groups  I'd say more intimate  <EOR> I LOVE LOVE LOVE! place  once something new     Loved it  Then back show friend  week took sister  Today took other sister birthday fell love all over again  service EXCEPTIONAL! Someone always attending to  very good job explaining everything step step  am thrilled show family friends unique place eat dessert  Also inexpensive even better! <EOR> A cute little restaurant only 10 bar seats limited seating specializing beautiful eloquent desserts made order     Sweet Raku unique dessert experience no other where sit right bar watch them your desserts! very entertaining interesting watch  great place take date some added quality time fun place take family kids fulfill sweet tooth!  Space limited prepared wait if come during peak hours like dinner   desserts take awhile prepare everything scratch   so if looking order quick dessert to go place it  sit down watch enjoy your dessert kind place  Expect least 30 45 minutes    The desserts pretty delicately made  bit pricey though prepared pay $14 20 per dessert person  paying whole experience just dessert! Personally tried 3 different desserts okay me  pretty but bit sweet nothing amazing taste wise  But if you've never cool place check least once  <EOR> I absolutely love Sweets Raku  moment walk tell place clean food looks delicious incredible culture restaurant no other    This isn't just dessert place  entire experience  Friday night around 9 pm  very lucky found table quickly but seated line started form near door  recommend coming bit earlier having someone visit restaurant first because restaurant pretty small    Price amount detail work quality food used reasonably priced  four people bill came $54  also wine pairing options special sorbet could add well  However wanted enjoy desserts just were  apple pie dessert 2 mars mount fuji  All delicious!!! would back again try apple pie    Ambiance decor clean sleek  Everything white tell restaurant takes health code standards seriously  watch pastry chef sometimes owner create dishes right front you  recommend grabbing seat bar see desserts being created  much love attention detail quality into each dish! understand why popular    Food apple pie came sugar apple mascarpone caramel it  Then side honey ice cream apple pie itself  careful biting into sugar apple pie! friend cut tongue leaf because sharp  Mars interesting presentation  covered soft chocolate looked Mars  When served server poured warm sauce over dish chocolate melted reveal delicious berries middle  Mount Fuji chocolate chestnut chocolate chestnut cream sponge cake middle  least favorite dish but still great  also serve non dessert foods which hope come back try again day    Drinks serve alcohol here  However came dinner already polished bottle wine before coming  didn't anything drink here  If enjoy pairing wine dessert then recommend trying wine pairing recommendations    Overall give place 5 star  experience impeccable can't wait back again! <EOR> When comes dessert really high expectations  Sweet Raku tasty but didn't leave mouth wanting more end  Prices just right  Reasonable opinion  $15 two course dessert meal  first course includes seasonal sorbet second any your choosing menu  boyfriend two different opposite dishes  green tea dish super subtle  traditional definition traditional Japanese dessert  sweet whatsoever vs ichigo which very sweet all fresh fruit syrup etc  both dishes good different opinion but honestly think you're just paying presentation itself  cool concept see everything put together front but soon lose interest fact seeing everything just coming Tupperware containers  everything premade course just storages away until assemble time    I've read crowded arrived Saturday evening no wait but surely when left crowd starting develop  Anyways  recommend trying least once since all over internet  judge yourself see if sweet raku worth it  prob won't ever come back unless someone within group suggest only because dessert menu rotates     Oh croissant tasty! Chewy soft crunchy all same time  <EOR> My friends Ubered 5pm rain Saturday no wait all  6 saw bar because weren't enough seats tables but hey see artists decorate each dessert which really fascinating  Plus wait food bit long entertained   Sadly minimum order $12 per person which cost each dessert everyone order something  wasn't really paying attention but think heard staff say we're limiting sharing too?   ***  MACARONS $9 Surprise! There's center filling each macaron!? Some centers chocolate but think saw red bean Matcha macaron strong flavor     ANGEL CREAM $12 gets Cutest Design Award  heavenly dome cream like cloud white chocolate wings silver halo  looked pure wish could keep forever    Anyways ate bit little disappointed taste  wasn't sweet thought maybe tasted little sour   MOUNT FUJI $12 favorite because huge fan chestnuts often eat chestnut cakes  dorayaki? soft cake chestnut pieces topped really fluffy chocolate cream thin chocolate bark thin cookies  really liked all except LOT cream  cookie part also very good crispy    ICHIGO $12 far prettiest cake menu yeah Mars pretty too      white chocolate cup filled strawberry sweets pastry bites imitation strawberry sugar shell filled cream   actually fan strawberry but good strong strawberry flavor  really liked pastry bites because lot layers buttery taste   ***  Overall really place! But high expectations all pictures desserts look better taste  kind bummed didn't edible menu Ringo deconstructed apple pie wasn't menu  would probably want come back when new interesting desserts! <EOR> For last review 2013 better review desserts only restaurant?

Because experience won't forget   From moment walk into stark white establishment cool decor watching pastry chefs prepare your 3 course dessert menu if don't la carte using funky bathroom place just very unique  can't compare any other place   I pre fixe menu $19 which comes EDIBLE MENU dip into raspberry sauce amuse petit fours just $7 more getting la carte  picked Mt  Fuji chestnut cream cake because mesmerized way chefs making it  looked ice cream spaghetti  But cream   which good but definitely would better if ice cream   My husband chose Baton which chocolate pistachio mousse over chocolate sponge cake red wine sauce  outside made thin chocolate layer  beautiful really hard eat toppled over attacked  Taste wise thought better Mt  Fuji   The Sorbet amuse good palate cleanser but cream puff petit four seriously amazing  cream puffs heaven  barely took pic before disappeared into mouth   Of course all things most impressive edible menu  soon present know you're nice treat rest dessert experience  Could all tasted better?

Really long does really take 1st course scoop some sorbet ass champagne garnish 3rd course heat premade cream puff?   They could really themselves favor adding another server adding host hostess something  off night just missing something   The girls tried sweet tried explain everything well but didn't work me  much inconsistency service    Example explaining edible menu before first course almost coming out?  The sauce serve rice paper menu awesome   I liked price prix fix 3 course dessert tasting  liked desserts  restaurant itself    I wouldn't return any time soon  whole experience disappointing me  <EOR> There two Rakus located parking lot  meals other primarily desserts  Both offer plates eat  stopped into offering desserts   Small bar area  some seating  Large wine storage way in  Staff friendly mostly consistent seating host execution    There minimum dining charge per patron  20 something  Staff provided before getting started    came solely dessert  Between five ordered two course main dessert some macaroon  don't really recall name some dishes  just didn't care much shaved grapefruit  bit tart    Another Berry sorbet mint  Jello  dish served palette cleanser  different mix  Little sweet little savory  Texture  Gets tongue think bit before getting entrees    Sunset entrees  mix fresh fruit cream chocolate  favorite  balance   Otherwise everything masterfully thought out  Presentation arrangement cakes pastries cream fruit  your typical desserts    The macaroons took home  All sweet  Held well four days  crust delicate crunchy  filling rightly stuffing Asian flavored  tasted matcha another red bean  Five flavors  Aromatically appealing    Overall good experience  Good flavors  Great place talking points taking date  <EOR> What fun experience! highly recommend anybody over age 8 so  First all ambiance super cool  Japan? sure but think so  small room decorated all white 10 seats 'bar' where watch few desserts being made 10 table seats  Warning no signage! located between Kabuto massage place  The food menu which edible! includes 3 course prix fixe option 1 course option  drink menu extensive selection champagne dessert wines but unfortunately all quite high priced very few glass selections  addition order wide variety teas several types bottled Japanese water various ph's  tried 'bicarbonate' which supposedly athletes  could taste slight difference tap water but sure if worth $4! On main thing desserts! all delicious  amuse white peach sorbet sparkling wine jelly good  Usually peach flavored things cloyingly sweet but light delicious! small beads sparkling wine jelly perfectly complemented it  could eaten 10 these  For 'main' dish 'angel' cookie pear gel top covered pear foam 'red rock' raspberry molten cake vanilla ice cream yuzu marshmallows some other stuff!   angel really good light just hint pear but red rock awesome! Seriously usually don't 'molten' cakes because they're goopy sweet cake part heavy but THIS     this good  all things yuzu marshmallows really stood out! disappointing only 2! last dish cream puff  good all but small nothing special  I would highly recommend everybody check Sweets Raku least once perfect date night! Add bottle dessert wine could even skip dinner! $19 prix fixe menu definitely more you'd spend typical dessert but perfect special occasion  So why may ask give 5 stars? Simply because waaayyyyy      toooooooo     slllllloooowwww  Seriously over hour! appreciate every dish made hand ordered but could maybe hire another cook back there? pace really even good kids  Ours held end but ended scarfing down cream puff 1 bite each since way past bedtime time  <EOR> Wow!

Would wait line this     Luckily must've hit off time because walked we're seated right away   Don't wrong almost full sat down line started build outaide   So know located very small shopping center limited parkimg just walking lucky someone just leaving pulling in   2 restaurants named Raku    no sweet listed above restaurant but look wine bottle wall you'll know right one   other Raku serves Japanese food scumptious desserts!  It small seating limited part reason line builds   wish sat bar watch them create beautiful desserts   Each made when ordered all sitting refrigerator   Yes ordered 3!  would've ordered 5 but need  reason come back girls     hubby dinner anniversary   he awhhh surprised great desserts tasted   Both light sweet      would describe them   didn't feel heavy slice cake pie   GO definitely try!

Delicate flavors attentive service amazing deserts!! return again again  <EOR> So girlfriend town holiday weekend wanted experience highly touted Raku  small place waited 25 minutes seats around 25 people which think brilliant  Creates demand shorter supply  both 2 full course meals differing Mars Primavera plus wine pairing      We sat tables raspberry sorbet awesome!  Then Mars Primavera came individually liked both   girlfriend so so Mars but loved loved loved Primavera   poor rating explanation why follows My complaint giving them 2 stars follows 1 piece plastic bag wrapping Primavera dessert! really ruined experience  tried think could surmised must piping transport cream sauces into wine glass   Anyways totally made disappointed ruined meal   mean gross prices expect quality   2 wait staffer bit quiet could hear explanation dessert were  Sure busy but still articulation projection voice would appreciated  <EOR> The desserts both artistically beautiful deliciously decadent  visibly see time care all chefs put into each pieces art understand price which much better anywhere downtown   themes each dish stand elegantly surprises Mars dish just wonderful   Now reason 4 stars revolves around 2 small problems party encountered   1 Even though cookies sitting baskets seem free taking especially since prices listed anywhere TAKE THEM  $1 each considering some just simple Italian wedding cookie 3 ingredients little no preparation required all very large sized extremely high price point punctuate end your evening like group did   Just feels kick gut receive check something thought free having paid your check   2 know space extremely limited seating premium first come first serve but rushed end evening shooed chefs having paid over $100 just your meal feels little insulting  could understand if continued remain long deserts but if party just finished hostess chef should never ask them immediately leave seats free up  rude certainly insensitive your customers   Again wonderful experience would love again but certainly cut back purchases hope better service next visit  <EOR> Was trying Carib Mars Ryku Of all three Carib most  Its sweet n sour very refreshing taste  The other two just okay  Easy park your car since parking lot <EOR> YELP back!

It's gotten busier over years prepared wait least 30 minutes depending time go due limited bar table seating   But glad see quality service still same first visit   usually give edible menus fruit dipping sauce because menu constantly changing   During last visit provided paper menu pictures short description each   personally menu pictures see dessert looks rather just envisioning words     We tried 4 5 desserts offered Carib My absolute favorite!  comes glass tastes tropical fruity very refreshing Vegas heat    Ringo deconstructed apple pie  Mars heat Brandy pour over melt chocolate   wasn't fan due heavy alcohol taste  Puffy Cup Like blueberry souffle mango puree side  I would recommend Carib Ringo but all desserts delicious worth try!  If your first time would try getting seating bar  really cool able see your desserts come life! <EOR> Lovely entrance  wine lover amazing first site  Very clean set very classy  beautiful marble counter tops everything  If sit bar see everything being made  All workers Asian VERY sweeeet!   I recommend ordering wine flights  Although places Jell O shot containers enough taste parings cheese  wish told cheese meant wine  But kind figured out  thought interesting Pinot noir placed over ice  But when sipped dessert wine  Chardonnay actually much less sweet red wine    I green tea dessert loved it  There's surprise chocolate very bottom  Reasonable pricing definitely instagtamy hahaha <EOR> This quite interesting little dessert spot   menu bit limited basically 5 6 things choose them   Also place absolutely TINY if place full you're kind SOL   group four place full   don't waiting area just stand entry way which uncomfortable   Luckily group left long didn't wait long   Sitting counter definitely way watch them hand craft each dessert order   I ordered Ringo which pretty much apple pie la mode but elevated into work art  apple place some sort edible candy filled cream caramel think   wife Mars   no idea candy dome made but when serve chef heats small tin brandy believe torch until flames   Then pour over dessert dome melts away reveal cream fruits underneath dome   Very cool   If you're looking unique cool place dessert off strip MUST stop Sweets Raku  <EOR> Be careful another Raku restaurant right next it!  Anyway lets down business   place minimum charges each person   Each person required order main dish which costs $12 individually   ordered Mt  Fuji combo which includes sobert dish called Mars   When walked received no greetings staffs actually ignored when tried talk which initially gave bad impression place     Highlights 1   Both dishes looked pretty   But taste just ok   2   staff look cold mean first but warm once seated  3   Tiny space waiting did provide any seats either    4   price bit expensive but  pretty much expected beginning    5   restaurant clean food other desserts!   6   Highlight review bathroom very clean decorated awesome designs!

With all four five stars feel bad throwing 3 them  drop more time redemption! Hopefully they'll help all waiting line setting chalkboard updating information such wait times when something menu sold out  <EOR> Located plaza full good restaurants sense walk over dessert right your dinner or could your dinner   gotten 3 course dessert $19 decorate bake some front if sit bar  Pretty fun watch  desserts themselves pretty damn good change menu occasionally  plus menu edible! <EOR> I am OBSESSED!! give Sweets Raku more 5 stars?!  So honest  definitely bigger fan savory sweet  exactly biggest sweet tooth    however appreciate delectable sweets every once while   The ambiance is    White  Bright white walls small size  There's bar seating few tables seating  imagine most Sweets Raku hold 20 people so    I sat bar friend ordered Caribe friend ordered Mt  Fuji shared some macaroons  also tried wine flight where few samples wine selected pastry chef to pair nicely desserts   All  Of  It  Was  Delicious    Presentations highly impressive servers into detail each dessert  Macaroons Order came 5 vanilla red bean lemon green tea coffee mocha  Macaroons usually sweet but superb  vanilla favorite! Caribe There lot going but enjoyed every last bite  dessert concoction mango coconut flavors presented large wine glass  Creamy coconut panna cotta goodness bananas along other fruits goodies  There's thin candy lid placed top glass pour mango syrup which melts right through! Mt  Fuji Mousse hazelnut hints chocolate  Very creamy  didn't many bites but very smooth sweet! Wine flights Flight came 3 small samples test tubes wine 2 white 1 red  Also came small assortment cheese marinated tomatoes  Yummy!  $12 dessert entree might sound pricey but taste experience well worth Sweets Raku! <EOR> Great date place especially younger couples would impress  food well crafted decadent types great conversation starter  amazing food looked pretty generic tasting good but great  Great staff   I'd definitely recommend take date but would likely come back    We ordered Ringo Mt fuji   FYI odd rule each person order main dessert keep mind  <EOR> Cool presentation all but tastes Todai dessert section reamed bill  $89 4 desserts couple teas  feel conned  Actually take back   everyone party feels conned  Service great all just place no sense its price point  <EOR> Ordered two course meal included tiramisu served shot glass Primavera  panna cotta itself delicious but then masked strange rose flavored jelly tart sorbet tons cream more cream  Beautiful presentation but flavors strangely paired  <EOR> 12 $ minimum rule sucks !

The first course earl grey creme brulee came super quick maybe 5 minutes put order  initial reaction hell this? extremely tiny could eat two bites  both usually love creme brulee but truly sad excuse creme brulee flavor wise some bites tasted little burnt well size wise  bf said could better creme brulees buffets lmao   Our second course took 30 minutes come out  Presentation wise looked quite nice  Instagram worthy if wanna put it   liked wasn't sweet lighter side    Would come back? No  need work customer service skills one  girl working bar looked miserable working  no smile anything just same monotonous facial expression  sad experience because biggest sweet tooth ever recommended spot few people  <EOR> Design looks good  Ordered desserts twenty minutes ago took 5 solid minutes coffee sugar   hope food worth wait    I've heard good things ordered quite bit test things out   Just hoping service doesn't reflect food  <EOR> Maybe overzealous over ordered but nothing really wow ed here  girlfriends ordered all five main dessert offerings couple seasonal sorbets  day's sorbet flavor mango  pretty good   The desserts tasted very sweet all border line bitter  Although beautifully crafted flavors didn't really jump me  favorite dessert probably strawberry called Ichigo which chunks strawberry shortcake strawberry inside white chocolate egg mold  least favorite Mt  Fuji bitter city!!
