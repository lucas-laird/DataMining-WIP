I bump review down 1 star because place ridiculous  last 2 times tried order food and or did delivery driver  When owner said didn't driver delivery last time said thank anyway  kid she practically begged order said she would deliver herself close said okay    We waited over hour half 2 medium pizza's some wings all cold  pizza's sloppily put together all meat pizza which supposed pepperoni sausage bacon no bacon no sausage but pepperoni chicken! WTF  let know certain toppings would changed order  clearly shit together going back  <EOR> This place good convenient me  Its same plaza where work always lunch there! tacos delicious all food always done se day  Fresh! Definitely gotta try them! mention pizza <EOR> Did really just best Stromboli ever ate? think so! seen place change owners several times  never ate when Mexican food but pizza two when Charleston Pizza  favorite long shot but actually bad  However ran other day before hitting climbing gym find new lady working kitchen  menus now say Charleston Pizza Mexican food and Mexican food written Sharpie  Place cleaner convenience store located lady nice  ordered Stromboli pepperoni mushrooms ham boy good!  told dough fresh frozen cooked perfection  mushrooms probably but good that  Plenty cheese toppings  huge! TWSS   actually ate daughter took show interesting people coming going   think nice lady assumed going take which reasonable assumption but once said going eat she brought set mis matched plastic plates which really neat brought everything together unique way   felt might some plates kids used growing across multiple ages somehow survived years now she sharing part family us    Based single order Stromboli rate 5 stars  does take into consideration location which sketchy fact only two rickety old tables if decide eat there  assume most take out  ate because adventure which trait highlight PoF profile  Speaking PoF place you'd take date early into relationship although might great place take steady see if she's really into you  place you'd experience real life real people treat your taste buds dining experience stand its own merits spite fact most people would probably pass nose air never giving more passing glance unassuming place  <EOR>
