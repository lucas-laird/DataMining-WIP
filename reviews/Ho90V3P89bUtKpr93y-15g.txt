Two Managers NO BUSINESS running business  Aside actual menu items complete waste your money  Most specialty items store bought taken package then heated put your plate  then your paying 12$ up  Literally freshly cut waffles fries  means frozen bag stuck oven served near room temp  small stand alone freezer over tea coffee bar find your tamales there  Frozen off shelf  What's really sad found way muck produce  salad bar isn't sanitary sitting juice bar could tell First First phrase Management heard practices  think your safe eating raw but fruits veggies bad but don't care  thats even worse! don't care customers want spend money quality VEGAN experience! Being talked down disrespected two supposed owners says all  Save your money ANY OTHER vegan spot town  Oh based fact hold employees checks 3 weeks due huge sign them being pooper financially  think nasty old man mean al customers lives there! <EOR> The food tastes great but portions many things bit small  liked food both times visited but others less impressed  Its nice vegan food gluten free options SW area town but havent back while  <EOR> The breakfast burrito classic style good! hope more people come enjoy thier cooking! staff always friendly very knowledgeable serve!

Mexi Vegan Burger not raw time thought beyond great! Great flavor sides katsup guac salsa needed dress burger but complemented well  She lentil loaf impressive  Very filling no left overs! <EOR> It's really convenient vegan cafe especially salad bar ! All vegetables always fresh organic!  Best babaganush ever !  So happy finding almost everyday meal place !! <EOR> In unlikely event reader read any previous reviews especially those commit smaller population a k a  vegans vegetarians etc    would notice give lot credit level passion commitment   Same Vegan Cafe found place search Yelp specifically looking Vegan option while LAS business  quite exciting when popped search  drove 5 miles great enthusiasm enjoy nice healthy lunch option  The place did disappoint  Warm prompt service many options select from  enjoyed salad washed down healthy juice  The only reason fall short 5 stars because most menu based vegan substitutions usual suspects Pizza Burgers Sandwiches Burritos Tostadas  IMHO no need try replicate those items already Vegan don't walk through door because want burger think already transitioned bright side quite frankly turn non vegan into began just because serve them Vegan alternative flesh eating ways   But then again    just opinion could wrong  <EOR> I tried place because healthy  biggest problem portion sizes price  read many reviews mention small portions management just doesn't seem care  side fries comes menu items ridiculously small  8 fries  buy organic sweet potatoes expensive  Most menu items just enough food  shouldn't leave restaurant hungry  Why don't care enough customers even address complaints? don't usually bother reviewing restaurants all but just irks me  <EOR> We dipping toes into Vegan food every now again decided check place out  whole bunch stuff share most good if little pricey  Highlight mexican bean burger which good another dinner evening!  <EOR> Trust when say going best vegan restaurants you've ever to  Actually don't take word it try yourself   I met sister weekend Vegas  decided brunch before flight truly left best last Vegan Cafe  location bit off beaten path but there's only much Strip take sitting    We arrived minutes opened covered patio all ourselves  I believe spotted air conditioning units which necessary Vegas heat server warm friendly answered questions? extensive menu provided great suggestions newbie experience  finalized choices to omelet raw collard greens wrap  also added breakfast sausage because server told house made    I've couple vegan omelets Boston area while both amazing resembled more crispy crepe than? omelet  case here  fluffy souffle like texture closest thing real deal ever had  oat based sausages equally amazing  Double check your server if you're gluten free bonus little muffin came accompaniment omelet  much bang your buck dish! absolute delight ended being seasonal strawberry rhubarb perfectly baked  vegan!? moment sure  collard wrap refreshing eat felt desert air start warm up  crisp wrap creamy filling satisfying combination   After meal walked over register front door saw workers stocking salad bar case need quick meal  Another FYI give stevia coffee  I'm? particular coffee think stevia leaves bit metallic taste but didn't affect since carry around travel size maple syrup purse  coffee itself cold brewed which means less acidic easier your tummy  Ever notice when milk looks curdled when pour into your coffee?  reaction acidic brew  <EOR> The food alright  service kind but unattentive forgetful uncommunicative  ordered coffee but didn't receive until end meal worth wait  many vegan restaurants Vegas excited try place but sadly huge disappointment  would come back again  <EOR> We arrived little over hour half before scheduled float next door intended getting light meal before float   When arrived restaurant empty   110+ degrees outside little warm but terrible inside cafe   all lights off ceiling fans running reminded little eating places outside where don't rely 24 7 AC     We sat down looked over menus few minutes ordered green juice raw pizza jackfruit tacos   juice arrived shortly maybe 10 min?  man took order made juice   middle aged woman also slowly pacing behind counter watching  but aside appeared only staff front house  both kind joyless all welcoming    Another table two arrived friend juice   chatting noticed table received food order before ours even though arrived 20 minutes did   continue chat anticipate food   checked clock noticed waiting over 45 min food only 15 min before scheduled float   inquired apparently man forgot put order   asked just cancel order pay juice go   He offered food prepared float declined point eat BEFORE float   He didn't seem want said well already started food should only 5 more min well then would time next door   insisted just then he still brought plates   asked check some boxes   Pretty unpleasant   food okay   enjoyed raw pizza hummus but otherwise wasn't anything special certainly worth waiting over hour for  it's hummus spread dehydrated nut crust sprinkled chopped tomato arugula should taken maybe 2 minutes assemble most   friends jackfruit taco rice beans tasted microwaved all elements prepared ahead time simply assembled no reason hour wait except man forgot    No apology acknowledgement inconvenience   raw pizza size 2 wasa crackers cost $16   total bill $45 tax     Not recommended  <EOR> We don't live Las Vegas didn't know expect  breakfast burritos tofu scrambles waffles coffee juice  All beautifully done! Clean tasty healthy perfect sized portions  ambiance also nice staff  loved it! <EOR> Had breakfast burrito spinach style  more breakfast taco burrito but very good  Very flavorful  space itself little weird really large awkward layout but least food good   Glad see more vegan places opening up  <EOR> Even if raw vegan lifestyle isn't food fresh fun great tasting good you! Plus best kind takeout ever since don't worry getting cold  raw just vegan items available raw burgers portabello nut patty! collard wraps mexican italian style! favorites though both served avocado fries   If want liquid lunch massive selection smoothies shakes well fresh young coconuts   Location bit odd cash hostess stand rather back bakery counter large ground counter where staff sit  There's huge salad bar $9 lb middle dining room small supplement shop area right small talk garden area back  There's just lot going much way decor  guess all focus energy busy kitchen! <EOR> These guys wide variety comfort food raw foods  wife daily special heaping plate nachos which completely vegan  tasted better real nachos  acai granola smootie bowl  very tasty  Worthy five stars pending going back trying other things  <EOR> I met friend lunch absolutely perfect  pleasantly surprised big menu appreciated fresh salad bar  If you're alone grab vegan treat maybe some homemade truffles browse little book store relax next beautiful calming fountain  ended having kale salad very pleased flavor portion size  Next time think try some banana pancakes!
