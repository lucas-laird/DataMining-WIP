No line waited 5 minutes before name taken down wait tables cleared didn't look busy all  seated two other parties arrived received service before getting walking out  <EOR> Charming little American restaurant serving few surprises staffed super nice people   Service Excellent  Forget other reviews first all  difference between slow bad  Easily overwhelmed? Yes are  Bad servers? No absolutely not  Paris server actually very quick take order quick refills brought food hot well exception fault   Hostess super slow sit cooks take bit but overall very happy  Actually adding star just Paris she great  Again witnessed other guests acting inappropriately shocked composure staff kept think lot   Food adequate prob should three star food  starters lobster Mac cheese bites  Sriracha sauce okay spicy all tho  bites huge took 4 bites eat one  Three per order unfortunately still cold middle oh well  Both ribeye fairly standard little overpriced but you're captive audience where else gonna go? Came side grilled veggies pretty good winter squash parsnip carrot seemed fresh  Baked potato standard   Drinks separate bar several cocktails fairly good list actually even two fairly respectable whiskey flights  Wife ordered sidecar ran cognac bartender asked if brandy okay turned alright  jalapeño margarita jalapeños pickled still sure if liked way but overall drink options nice touch more just blank coke gin tonic etc  Wine list very small  Didn't bar see beer selection but just few handles tap evil blue oval bud light only recognized distance   Ambience sitting windows watching snow fall made forget patron assaulted server police came arrest them  Over wait times  WTF wrong ppl? Can't fault restaurant shows up  aside there's few fireplaces give warmth glow but also look need deep scrub some new paint  country music playing all top hits 1995  view really excellent huge vaulted ceiling log cabin decor adds feeling Colorado Nevada  overall thought pleasant enjoyable  <EOR> Went dinner waited someone come seat guy walks told he right then 10min another guy said samthing 10min just bar ate tried next morning  SAME THING HAPPENED all care big group ppl  Waited more 15min again just seated just left came lodge  much nicer much faster more customers inside  <EOR> I've putting review off awhile now because needed certain element complete review   just obtained goes     My wife stayed Hotel wedding over weekend   hotel old dirty   rooms seemed 80's   room even slightly slanted which felt walking cruise ship when getting middle night bathroom   But review hotel but restaurant hotel   We party 7   All food arrived   started eating then wife gasps   look over ask problem is   She points down food says there's screw bacon   look over plate indeed metal screw cooked into bacon   couldn't believe immediately stopped eating   Lost appetite called waitress over manager   first no manager waitress said she sorry she going comp wife's meal   WHAT?
