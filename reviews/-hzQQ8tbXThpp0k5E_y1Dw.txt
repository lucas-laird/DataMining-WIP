Detoxifyer rescue! juice once day 3 days enough trick  4th day put swimsuit actually impressed  couldn't believe it   If need something more substantial eat I did try **The Fitness** crepe add Alfredo chicken mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness  split friend also Detoxifyer   The only thing I'd change place system indicate when orders ready  shout order number then people come take items without having show receipt  Maybe more automated system shows number patrons show proof purchase  order stolen twice! Granted MGM Grand overrun 15 000 people company's convention  But still such system would help even daily basis   Overall love Blizz introducing healthy juice options me  Thank clerks recommendation! special thanks Detoxifyer! You've really opened eyes   DATE TIP Detoxifyer definitely ready your next hot Vegas date    TIP [[[ T M I  Alert ]]] Remember put must also come out  may use restroom slightly more often before things may look same color when consumed them  Detoxifyer vivid pomegranate color  Haha told TMI  You've warned! <EOR> Got $40 credit staying Signature decided use 3 people  Environment Located right inside MGM near theatre open area yogurt dessert plenty seating  Cute little decor  Dessert Drinks We ordered two drinks Berry Acai Smoothie dad ordered Berry Blitz I don't remember names but all berries both delicious!

Food prepared pretty swiftly  <EOR> Overpriced!  whole buffet price two self serve yogurt cups     great location right next food courts just outside arena    Seating area only allows sit 30 minutes max  <EOR> If you're staying MGM don't want breakfast big deal but you're little hungover need something filling tell your friend pay breakfast if she downstairs gets guys crepes brings them back room  She probably flip off then bathroom throw ending having downstairs pay crepe but whatevs  Fresh Start crepe scrambled eggs spinach mushrooms tomato add cheese feel better she repay buying bloody mary pool  <EOR> Really hit spot something sweet great dinner lot walking about  Congo dessert crepe bananas Nutella  Don't forget lick plate  bad $13 bucks    Only real negatives there's only crepe batter option pretty doughy sugary  <EOR> This just those self serve places  Vanilla Frozen Yogurt and because non fat 3294873947 ounces   loaded toppings delicious  nice little late night snack me!!!  Just because non fat doesn't mean eat unlimited amounts  Open breakfast lunch dinner? WTF? Whatever if you'll all three meals deserve undernourished stupid   It's just frozen yogurt!

Why not!? vacation guess its okay splurge sometimes    but great way satisfy craving sweets hit spot! <EOR> Frozen fruit  Just nasty  Go IHOP   Is worth almost $12 First time ever  Come Dr       <EOR> The place serves small portions  New Yorker crepe $14 did fill bit   stuff did seem happy when interrupted gossip somebody being still love someone   looks clean but worth your time money   Small portions expensive <EOR> This review purely frozen yogurt   first 1 star review   I really feel bad people gave place 4+ stars yogurt because means don't know good froyo tastes like!!  breaks heart If you're southern California where froyo shops plentiful steer clear place   yogurt odd flavor   fruit wasn't ripe either   My friends $50 room credit use night since leaving next morning thought we'd shave some off getting little froyo using rest drinks food later   Well little froyo i e  3 yogurts cost whopping $25 91   shitting me?  Even highest priced yogurt shops Pinkberry Red Mango cost average $5 pop   yes close $9 per really shitty tasting yogurt outrage   The kicker?  Even though confirmed them accepted room credit weren't able pull system which meant pay said yogurt   Let tell right now when reached front desk raised uproar until woman would change room credit $75 since fault mess first place   Though Blizz's fault having such crappy yogurt   I yet try any other items   experience yogurt don't want to  <EOR> This place popped little over week first visit MGM year evening dinner craving something sweet came down grab crepe take back room  girl behind counter super helpful decided getting nutella crepe strawberries  certainly cheap crepe ran $11 but time worth every penny <EOR> Ok snack time Vegas  thing say MGM nice sized food court  If looking cheap meal snack then plenty places that  saw place Nutella crepes  all needed see Nutella crepes  sold  mean Nutella crepe curious see there's was  verdict ok  Mine much better am saying because mine  am saying because true  If there's better would gladly admit improve mine based there's but can't it  actual crepe itself tasted pretty plain  no real flavor all   also rubbery consistency plastic knife gave cut doing it  practically take apart hands! nice fluffy crepe cut through easily   If would known plain would opted whipped cream just little extra flavor because did put much Nutella it  Most bites mouthful crepe  it   also set back $11 95 even Vegas thought steep!  Nutella good lol  crepe itself decent size guess but regardless still overpriced The customer service really either  mean rang gave pager when order ready it  No greeting smiles anything really welcoming  am asking butt kissed but least act want serve your customers  don't want kind vibe  also took while crepe  wait little excessive   Also when ordered asked if said but when prepared eat there  When asked box guess problem because evil look  She rolled eyes box   Overall if snack again would opt frozen yogurt avoid crepes  But seeing  some other reviews may just avoid place all together    only overpriced but quality does match if did price would issue  <EOR> This closest place signature breakfast food easy choice since starving  Since crepe spot made order takes bit longer your average fast food restaurant  tried Nutella strawberries ham cheese pizza crepe  favorites nutella ham cheese  $10 per crepe  <EOR> Ha!
