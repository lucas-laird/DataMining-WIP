If people working place read advice your tomato sauce El paso flautas needs oregano! getting close but no cigar  <EOR> Maybe because came middle afternoon  Maybe because ambience lacked typical festive energy Mexican restaurant but didn't really enjoy place  walked without anyone line received no greeting whatsoever    little bit downer  fact despite inability choice first cashier those behind counter never bothered suggestion dish try     decided play safe ordered steak burrito  Evidently version said typical dish only includes beans choice meat  really disappointed learn any rice much anything else add dishes  steak somewhat crunchy a bit old beans lacked taste meal overall remarkable all    I must sadly say place visit good food  <EOR> ¡Delicioso!  I already few times coming hometown El Paso certainly say place WAY BETTER original Chicos Tacos original restaurant based off of  Everything tried delicious Flautas El Paso Juarez that should given Nachos Burritos have gotten both chile colorado best had Menudo only served weekends  bummer course favorite Elote en Vaso! every time  Paired una coca a mexican coca cola meal sure please your palette  <EOR> I curious see place about   am accustomed Juarez style Mexican let alone Mexican cuisine general   restaurant fairly new decided give shot     The outside inside conservatively decorated efficient its space   some really cool pics inside am guessing region   may silly say but intrigued see if place served dishes cool cartel names theme   But once entered realized idiot needs head checked   still would cool Jose Malverde combo something   know sensitive subject better quit before myself trouble   I ordered Juarez Style Flautas found nerve wrecking since familiar menu but reluctant ask questions since don't speak native tongue   just pointed nearest picture combo meal said those pro favor minus por favor part   wasn't half bad but don't know special let alone difference Juarez Style any other style matter   washed down horchata spent decent amount around $5   This place near job pretty location if ask if commuting Eastern exiting off US 95   Although don't think place getting much buzz may need consult marketing manager that   haven't seen any reviews come am probably less experienced Hispanic food critic since am even sure order unless help   With said rate place 3   usually rate Roberto's next house strong 3 well cleanest Roberto's ever saying something   Which only means would only fair give place 2 standard   Let's just say its 2 5 rounded up  <EOR> This off normal Beatin' path stopped street tacos flautas  glad did delicious   The cashier super friendly nice even helped explain some items pronounced them correctly us   The verde sauce best!!
