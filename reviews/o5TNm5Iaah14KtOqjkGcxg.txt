HOW!?!?? place still open?  Here's tip read carefully because expound shortly   Make   Sure  You  Like  Your  Food   Before  You  Eat  It     BEFORE  Yup   B E F O R E   My dining companion Costco membership then spying all wonderful wares Costco we decided activity made hungry  noticed Goldfinger across street convinced should TRY it  tried look menu online  Note if ain't menu online  ain't gonna wanna eat there  Guess what? No menu online but anyway  first glance almost tried little swanky then notice just kind dingy   We pick booth waitress hands menu didn't even menu opened all way she's asking want drink   whoa slow your roll Kristel  No introduction no greeting just right drink    The menu   talk underwhelming  little choose hard time making minds   almost left    I mayo sandwich something resembling sad chicken salad croissant chips  Salty crunchy chips   He some Buffalo wings which being near buffalo subsisting buffalo wings law   we KNOW buffalo wings taste like it   he fries cheese bacon it   Which he said he only ate because he hungry bacon them   case place needs put bacon everything  He ate 2 8 wings told  Kristel he didn't care them she said okay no empathy no apology no 3 R's if serving replace remake refund whisked them away took them kitchen   Kristel NO customer service skills whatsoever  She brings check wings still it   did mention still wings check she said but ate them   Yes tried them sure first actually really gross  ASK them taken off  She tells last night manager wouldn't take off food because someone ate food  telling Kristel if take bite food your d bag manager going pay if don't it? No  talk manager? She tells no manager duty she call am putting out? Let mention ONLY table place she time socialize kitchen could hear staff     Yes call manager  She did take wings off check  did leave fairly nice undeserved 15% tip  even told goodnight     This place needs someone charge premises   Kristel needs check attitude cook needs learn use appliances he isn't over cooking food   also invest lots lots bacon  <EOR> Decent beer selection menu  BLT    with peanut butter  died happiness  <EOR> Nice little spot great bar food   Also darn good breakfast menu! <EOR> Sadly place real disappointment  Bought GrouponNOW! lunch special over decent tuna melt then pay Groupon said decided honor because many people bought them    So expected pay lunch even while deal still Groupon selling more deals  Sleazy Business run mill bar food    Not worth effort     Typical Las Vegas scammers    <EOR> I came few times meet client food below average alot frozen food  service horrible day shift bartender rude disrespectful she would great dicks last resort  Credit Card over charged twice brought management but could care less  <EOR> This bar irritatingly upsetting  No happy hour  NO DRINK menu  cocktail drink cost $8  <EOR> Absolutely terrible place   My wife moving area closest restaurant  first breakfast which large sign outside advertising specials  Come find didnt apply Sundays despite fact menu said did said typo   Oh well big deal   few more bucks  Several other patrons complained manager threw fit front them he call police if dont pay full bill  food nothing special but nothing complain about    I wrote off back few weeks later  time service TERRIBLE no drink refills waited menus least 20 minutes etc  matters worse wife found medium size brown hair salad  told manager wouldnt paying meal wont back a promise kept   He basically shrugged off hardly apologized    There reason parking lot always empty  <EOR> Seriously folks place   It bar restaurant restaurant totally seperate   stopped breakfast Saturday around noon   interior pretty swanky vegas style tavern     I ordered chicken fried steak eggs   true mark quality breakfast if baste eggs correctly   eggs perfect white parts set yolks runny no brown spots bottom! The steak good tender   gravy amazing but decent   Here exctied YELP    try meatball omelette!!  friend tried bite   incredible   kinda eating pizza lasagne eggs all same time   am joking people DAmn GOOD!  If don't personally call bad yelper  am telling good     A swanky bar grille mazaing meatball omelette!!! <EOR> The only reason star because option zero stars   3 times first time ate breakfast restaurant side    food decent service price     The second visit thought twilight zone   bartender incredibly rude informed conversation should able heard over music playing   initially thought she joking   She wasn't   left chalked perhaps she having bad day     The next time she walks past least 4 times before asking order   should add around lunch time only two other people bar service wasn't slow due being busy she again very rude quite frankly should customer service position   speak manager he no better  Evidently father grandfather owns bar he does take customer complaints well  He became defensive essentially told wrong   So leave through casual conversations friends fact find same thing happened them someone know     Needless say return establishment  <EOR>
