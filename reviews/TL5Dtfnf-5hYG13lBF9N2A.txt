Benihana probably does 95% tourist business don't care 5% would probably visit again again if felt more welcome  <EOR> Over priced nickled dimed everything   No value anymore   drinking water arrived table looked murky guess expected buy bottle water addition alcohol ordered meal   Seeing triple digits hot outside think extremly poor judgment provide unpotable water   tasted funny everyone acted just fine when fact horrible   spend over 200 dollars meal treated herd cattle  <EOR> I enjoyed dining asked steak medium rare chef cooked nice ruby middle  am glad he cooked right way because many people mistake brown meat well cooked steak  If case then would need pay much steak  Everything delicious seated next nice couple other seating being slightly close other tables hibachis good time  <EOR> Horrible service host waitress barely spoke English  hibachi chef clean dishes table he cooking because waitress nowhere found  wait 15 minutes asking twice drink refills  Food good but overall very bad dining experience  Worst hibachi joint Vegas area  <EOR> This 6th time LV location say???  Food A+++ Service A++++ Drinks A++++   and using monorail worked way better Valet sucks LV Hilton       <EOR> The decor place old needs some serious updating  food ok much flavor chicken  If say would rather eaten another restaurant since experience worn off being exciting since same thing being done each table  <EOR> What great place if gluten free!! really hard time finding places eat safely more pleased experience there! staff very informed let know which options safe  chef even came speak me  grilled all food first used gluten free tamari instead soy sauce  Major thumbs entire staff!!!!! <EOR> I haven't Benihana since don't know seven years old when husband offered take jumped chance   made 6 30 pm reservation    The night off somewhat rocky start because 7 15 chef still table  worried because show Mirage couple hours advised waitress show time  manager came over confirm show time very kind accommodating however don't think chef actually showed until 7 20 so  take note probably best let them know if somewhere when call your reservation   The food really great if inauthentic  filet mignon which tender flavorful  husband Rocky's Choice chicken steak whichw also good but chicken nothing special if ever again think he'll probably stick steak    Our chef very friendly no com plaints service  restaurant itself beautiful too  <EOR> This place 100% trash  chicken feels takes rubber  When came wanted try place first time wait 2 hours seat even though empty spots  eat food dry quality terrible  <EOR> Sashimi plate delish! However would recommend Hibachi Tuna Steak it very bland no flavour kind of    inedible! served basic soup broth Benihana salad which very basic hibachi vegetables bell peppers onion sauteed plain steamed rice  somewhat reminded Japanese version Olive Garden? traditional Japanese food very underwhelming    However photographer employed restaurant took some very beautiful photos always treasure them! great reminder trip!  Cocktails must!  I very underwhelmed especially herd people rave place! <EOR> Unlike any other Bennihana location special   bigger typical location sushi imitation fireworks   head chef Toy he Bennihana 40 years   only he great tappanyaki chef he also great Elvis impersonator   great food even better show   highly recommend place if lucky ask Chef Toy   experience won't same after  <EOR> They great deal going when food sake $25! steal!

Long enough already water   Our waiter spoke broken English hard understand  Worked through ordered drink  Eventually ordered dinner   We great chef talked sharp knife long he worked let slip management wasn't having waiters tip chefs part payout anymore  If know anything tipping Japanese restaurant sushi place know customary tip higher because chef needs tipped  here  wait staff keeps tips yet all actually bring drinks appetizers back  chef does most work   Easy fix  Tip chef cash reduce tip wait staff accordingly  told chef two play game  Now am letting everyone know actually do  worse pooling tips dividing them everyone including lazy staff   As said chef great food excellent   Now waiter  Two people asked more water  7 some similar lemon lime soda instead  bubbles customer said sweet definitely wasn't water   Yes would back but won't because front desk wait staff  <EOR> While work related trip turned mini vacay Vegas tried Benihana first time   fan good hibachi superb! Why'd wait long try them slap please ?

Getting drink refill irritatingly difficult  Only halfway through meal did manage catch waitress  say catch she clearly pass right by  wouldn't say she unfriendly just sadly inattentive   Next time Vegas almost certainly drop again even if don't stay LVH  just extra vigilant getting second drink before halfway done  wish opportunity second try before giving review just case streak bad luck  hate hold back star something grand scheme dinner huge deal but just don't find nearly enough places serve proper Singapore Sling being deprived such long instills sense saudade woe   Seriously though  Tuan rocked grill  If think enjoy loquacious diatribes haven't seen love horrid puns  don't know if Benihana actually earned fifth star but Tuan did he works show off too  <EOR> This granddaddy Americanized hibachi joints!

It's inside Hilton but once through maze pass all casino areas you'll find Benihana   Walking beautiful   walkway twinkly lights tall waterfall zen garden   After getting seated people didn't know ordered chef came   jokes really cheesy but really fun because he interactive   I Habachi steak BF filet mignon   really should gotten he got   steak cooked perfectly chewy all unlike mine    All all great experience  <EOR> cocktails amazing love soup service sucks almost hour theyre still cooking <EOR> I've dined plenty times but before reviewing fine dining establishment slight correction needs made   The hotel where located no longer Las Vegas Hilton  Today letters LVH now stand Las Vegas Hotel  But elegant happy eating place still food still terrific   But every great place sometimes negative two     For example gets used seeing friendly smiling Japanese male coming your table bowing deeply speaking delightful broken English Japanese accent even if act    Those days gone unfortunately because Equal Employment Opportunity Laws USA mandate ANYONE cook your meal your table discovered when non Japanese person arrived food few years ago   Personally don't really care gender and or race person cooking food but having non Japanese performing task and he did FLAWLESSLY way akin having non Vulcan Science Officer aboard USS Enterprise   It's meeting TARZAN person discovering he's wearing loincloth   But aside urge patronize Benihana often because food really meticulously prepared staff most cordial professional   no hesitation recommending them enjoy cuisine whenever possible   All food preparers Black Belt Cooking regardless ethnicity  <EOR> Benihana pretty pricey  We spent 15o$ Lobster shrimp scallop 50$ Steak shrimp $ 30 something can't recall exactly  3 chicken fried rice 24$ 8$ each I feel Benihana scam when comes rice Your food suppose come rice  But charge extra $8 side chicken rice but wait WHERE YOUR ORIGINAL RICE YOUR ENTITLED ????? You must ask won't it   Also bought alcohol beverage $14   Honestly think Benihana food good experience CHEF GOOD BUT SITTING AWKWARD SILENCE AWKWARD PEOPLE STRANGE EVERYONE ACTS SCARED TALK    Ps  Make reservations <EOR> What?? Benihana where chef actually Japanese???  right!! totally authentic experience  Everything typical Benihana but particular restaurant large koi pond inside waterfall bridge walk over which very nice ambiance  also photographer works outside company taking souvenir photos  Overall nice experience probably back if staying hotel  <EOR> Super good  Fun area food amazing  Good service  Overall solid 4 5  group 11 great time  <EOR> If could give location 0 definitely would but don't  wrong but love Benihana but some reason location horrible  Upon arrival reservations once reservation wait additional 30 minutes seated which absurd because simple fact made reservation prior  finally seated party 2 started look menu  waitress no type etiquette didn't bother ask if wanted water even bring water  She very impatient knowledgeable dining in  girlfriends dinner party $30 coupon use if adult entree purchased but apparently read wrong since waitress manager came table saying needed order two adult entrees when coupon said fine bold print only entree needed use coupon  entire experience restaurant ridiculous wish would've better experience  <EOR> I Benihana many times over years  Beverly Hills San Diego etc     read bunch negative online reviews location Vegas  fact wife share very close birthdays brought Vegas Benihana  gave $30 credit EACH  $60 bucks! enjoyed experiences past figured bad could Benihana be? Especially $60 credit!   This location nicest seen  Gorgeous  Trees waterfalls elevators    When checked front desk took birthday photo us  thought oh comes want $20 picture  Nope! handed free birthday photo! cool that! also expected food pricing higher any other Benihana stated other reviews  not    This inexpensive place some would say being over charged but Benihana  paying MORE experience knives food flying dangerously close your face    I 2 drinks wife one  Teriyaki steak Filet Mignon  cost less spent most steakhouses  ESPECIALLY $60 credit! THANK BENIHANA birthday gift! More say buddy Bob  Wait did just say that? Sorry Bob am kidding Look place Benihana  No more no less  All negative reviews seem strange me  sure expecting  Every single cook actually Japanese! Felt very authentic  Super friendly staff very attentive  If fence don't be  Just friends good time  $8 95 drinks! most places lucky pay less $12!   The only real negative seating arrangement  Unless group friends fill seats seat strangers  Kinda Club Med Benihana experience  Cool Club Med cool dinner Vegas unless type wanna meet new people mood  not  <EOR> Sometimes craving teppanyaki  And first thing happened when Las Vegas  So asked dad if he could take Hilton some Benihanas    All performances same maybe cliche but food always great  But still dont think worth money expensive  I don't need see food cooked just want eat it  Especially if performances always same whether eat Benihanas Las Vegas San Francisco  <EOR> I coupon place decided give try   Seating family style sat next another family   order meat other ingredients then cook comes cooks food front us   process he puts little performance     The food very average   meat salty side but everything else lacked flavor  seems cook trained cook certain way look around they're all doing same thing  would probably come again food     Service decent  waitress came over few times check us   If haven't type place then I'd recommend just check out  <EOR> I would love give place great review unfortunately can't  reservations 10 took waitress least 30 min before she gave drinks  Then took hour half chef finally come cook us! 3 hours! photographer took pictures then end dinner when she came back around show pics see if wanted buy any she able sell pic  She walked away salty attitude told very short way thanks great day  Listen people dinner bothered some photographer trying sell something else  Menu says $35 entree $5 extra side fried rice  Rice came small rice bowl  Then quickly found if wanted split entree pay extra $10  place ridiculously expensive  food good but money better spent better food better service better prices  never back any benihanas  such rip off!! Money hungry restaurants only care making money off instead providing quality service come back! Ridiculous! <EOR> Customer service great  food really good including sushi   cool watch your food being cooked chef jokes!! inside beautiful  Pricey but worth experience!! <EOR> Located inside Westgate casino resort Benihana very family friendly atmosphere such breath fresh air compared smoky casino walk through there    We seated immediately since shortly opening  orders hibachi steak seafood Diablo mango shrimp Philadelphia rolls  waitress very attentive chef your typical hibachi chef same volcano choo choo train egg flying tricks    seems tricks food standard across US   add chef very accommodating when boys dumped whole bottle soy sauce rice  He back brought more fried rice them this       chicken    The reason why left star because while food excellent portion sizes way smaller your typical Japanese steak house prices lot higher    Overall great experience but still little hungry  may smallest group but sure eat husband  <EOR> I've many different Benihana locations Hawaii California Arizona but never extravagant location   When enter into restaurant you'll leave world behind enter into amazing Japanese themed environment   From water falls wooden walk ways bridges  Dragons skyline red lanterns everywhere   The waitstaff dressed modern kimonos lead your guests your table   We asked teppanyaki table where chefs cooks directly front you   Note request reservation but seat until your whole party arrived  Reason being may seated other people  Which kewl because always use opportunity new friends!  The chefs trained well cook amazing food entertaining showmanship performance keep smiling  While enjoying your food!  I would definitely choose place groups couples!  It's perfect venue If never would definitely recommend come try out! <EOR> Loved it!! Great place groups small families alike   in laws along 15 mth old son all enjoyed it!  son awe performance teppenyaki cook we!

Let's see why   For chef's entertainment I'd give 5 Star he great! However didn't enjoy fact while he's cooking your entire self now smelling kitchen just bad  prices very expensive think kinda money really enjoy something much better   For example bill 2 came $170!!!  We could've gone Fogo de Chão which amazing Brazilian steakhouse it'd cheaper   Just think prices bit outrageous what's offered   The entertainment great  Prolly won't going back restaurant first time ever  <EOR> This terrible! Worst hibachi experience ever had  chef worst paid 50+ dollars per person expecting nice show meal  received no show chef barely spoke word gave wrong order food well  Never seen hibachi restaurant charged extra fried rice! paying 50+ dollars piece cheap steak some onions four little pieces zucchini?!

I really extremely unhappy every part restaurant  <EOR> Terribly disappointed  several Benihana restaurants expecting least good any others  sushi entree no flavor no discern able taste whatsoever  only seated table didn't much show opportunity try variety dishes although looks others faces would venture say also left food plates because wasn't worth eating  plain white rice best part entire experience which pathetic  <EOR> After always walking location various trade shows LVCC finally decided give try  overall ambitious decorations outstanding  almost you're invited into little Japanese kitchen  downside place would overall food   For high price point expecting more spectacular food but just so  portion sizes very large which nice but felt meat vegetables could used bit more seasoning    The service also somewhat sub par  track down server few different times request drink menu dessert menu hibachi chefs seemed very rushed pulled table table  pushy photographer also give typical cheesy tourist touch    Overall most likely back but am glad finally tried it  <EOR> I love food Benihiana but location crap   Yes huge ton great visual architecture    We seated pretty fast   thinking wow going great! another 30 min before even allowed order food   good hour before chef came food   Really?!  They orders wrong end remind them ice cream   I love Benihana's Scottsdale AZ   one   much  <EOR> This location never disappoints special occasion group dining  Twice came parties over 15 always accommodate everyone great time delicious meal  need reservations advance since book fast large parties  chef Rollly rocked!  Although location located East side strip Westgate  ambience garden scenic area lovely perfect backdrop pics    I would recommend  those want big meal enjoy sushi choices  Always fresh better night town Las Vegas  <EOR> Birthdays anniversaries special occasions know where find us! love food atmosphere great  hope recent name change hotel doesn't scare people away only Benihana Vegas  would hate see place close  only complaint sometimes participate advertised chefs special sometimes don't  really depends waiter waitress    bad guy said no    tip way better chef's special then individual dinners  <EOR> Fantastic wonderful food good times met new people <EOR> Very convenient where live but clearly geared toward tourist  Very very expensive amount quality food get  very normal yummy leftovers most Japanese restaurants feel getting 2 meals  here! Very small portions  food good    great but also feel cheated having pay extra $5 fried rice which normally standard rice other Japanese places    pay extra charge just plain steamed rice   And let say this    BOTHER ORDERING COCKTAIL! Rip off! $12 exotic mojito    opinion no alcohol all!  far service    track down server twice order additional beverages     which switched bottled beer since knew would actual alcohol  Atmosphere fine    typical decor  Ft Lauderdale location much nicer  <EOR> Best Benihana restaurant food customer service beyond expectation really care decor inside authentic beautiful only problem didn't tip much next time it  left credit card mistake turn lost found department  recommend restaurant everyone!!! great place celebrate special occasion yes spend lot money but definitely worth once while <EOR> Last minute Vegas trip New Years Eve happy bunch drunken clams find ANY restaurant would big night   Nothing sense desperation really enhance dining experience eh? group 8 really just fuel keep going and boy did we   Benihani great groups because fun noisy atmosphere  chef great despite fact am sure he slammed  decor tiki polynesian served drinks little umbrellas which am total sucker for    To sum review chain restaurants usually consistent would say LV Hilton Benihana better average  Also theme novelty restaurants usually pinnacle fine dining  Lastly tourist traps usually expensive  Deal  <EOR> WORST meat ever tasted whole life    seafood okay   but meat   OMG Asked medium well tasted liver SUPER dry  Master Chef take piece he agreed but no sorry  Never going back never recommending location  <EOR> Amazing food great service  loved atmosphere chef very interactive  3 others nicest locations all  <EOR> I'm typically big fan chains but meal coupon burn choices limited Las Vegas Hilton restaurants dared suffer through expecting mediocre meal   This particular Benihana though surpisingly nice   decor extremely nice all nice Japanese touches   I'd recommend going just take look hang lounge areas   Teppanyaki done grill which sit 8 people around each grill   seats bit crowded together use restrooms before sit down   waitress take your order which usually beef chicken and or seafood combos   your typical soup salad which decent but nothing special show begins   chef twirls clashes cooking utensils crazed knife fighter   most common popular trick seems flaming volcano   cook reverse stacks some onion rings volcano shape which he pours some oil lights oil   flames shoot pretty high oil burned off continues smoke long time   Neat trick   Food usually cooked order Veggies Seafood Meats  So if rush order seafood only combos    quality food decent but nothing spectacular might expect   sauces nothing special didn't seem really enhance flavor meats seafood   So if looking entertaining dinner show while Vegas good any   If looking some really tasty food I'd look elsewhere   4 stars nice decor 3 stars food   Recommended groups 8 people people dining company dime  <EOR> I usually love Benihana really nice asthetically but entire party became ill eating here   The only thing all fried rice suspect chicken wasn't quite right     The service good but pay over $300 meal sick just wrong 5 us   <EOR> Birthdays always fun here!

Benihana few dozen times throughout life consistently great experience  favorite thing Benihana probably fact taste many different things! Soup salad rice fried rice grilled onions grilled zucchini grilled shrimp finally your entree  also love watching them prepare food  Sitting drooling over food while being prepared taste much better when finally ready  mention entertaining! Every time eaten chefs fun personable impressive  food always fantastic  Most dishes pretty standard nothing creative but they're well executed  give $30 off your birthday! could anyone take advantage that? <EOR> Benihana     think enjoyed place when younger but food drinks great  food very bland drinks tasted pure rubbing alcohol  bill definitely worth quality food service received  Very disappointed such fine restaurant  <EOR> I friend all time Benihana favorite place wanted know what's special  $30 GC your birthday if sign email BF decided go    When enter dark garden lead through just beautiful  lounge over looking seating areas sushi bars around but oddly none being used  perhaps weekdays?  lead elevator teppan room pretty ordinary comparatively ambiance downstairs ambiance bit wasted    They start off getting soup salad ginger miso dressing  hand 2 different sauces hot sauce request cook zucchini onions shrimp appetizer seafood items then fried rice extra  steam rice comes your food meat entrees guy did some mushrooms I scallops calamari shrimps BF shrimp chicken  food cooked nicely but wasn't particularly special  sauces just okay needed more punch just bit bland runny    They efficient little planned show then guy gone  barely getting into food guy just packed off left  glancing another table just started show almost same thing   Service server helping teppan guy very personable attentive though  Definitely top notch service he even gave some green tea ice cream chatted bit dinner  give them that excellent service  However bit sad server more memorable teppan show!   I can't help compare them Musashi local teppan place great experiences over over  much more offer really overshadowed experience Benihana  show lengthier bit more complex tricks jokes stories fantastic each teppan person own unique style bit cheaper price really awesome fried rice included soup salad veggies plenty different flavorful sauces freshly made front you    Glad tried but back  Even $30 birthday discount bill $70+ two plus tip  Musashi few months ago spent $70 two including hefty tip! way more fun better food    Um yeah  feels no brainer where going next time want teppan experience bring visiting friends family to  <EOR> Not biggest fan Benihana normally but cook particular location night awesome  He clever funny plenty tricks sleeve  Sadly stuck table bunch rude hungover complaining college kids  took everything reach over smack them haha  felt bad cook having deal them but he made best didn't let them faze him  wish could remember name! The location itself terrible  Inside LVH formerly Hilton place absolutely no reason anyone visit other possibly going Benihana  feel would much better if moved strip  pretty wild atmosphere when walk downstairs waterfall everything  excited until bring upstairs small boring room where actually eat  server friendly food typical Benihana quality  Only reason because $30 Birthday gift card send out  very cool that!! <EOR> Let's start good things first! ambience itself mesmerizing feel transported some Japanese ancient town! Interior precious! Now hostess seats your group table end watching chef's show least 30 minutes opposite side table! Finally while waitress brings drinks! Now menu itself confusing cause no clue getting enlisted price  let's say figured anything works finally place order! CAUTION hungry might tempted steal food across table cause waiting time long  ordered steak salad steamed rice salad comes first absolutely tasteless then another 15 minutes steamed rice then half century your steak overall besides little show chef puts paid for! All combined Panda Express would $10! returning sure! giving 5 star ambience skilled chef! Food half star! All combined 3 star generous! <EOR> From east coast wanted try Benihana while  know resort but against better judgement  1 Hostess front did offer await party inside restaurant  2 Chef painfully slow looked he ready home retire  3 pay extra $8 hibachi rice fried!!!  numerous hibachi grills life first  fried rice standard?! 4 Rice bland even fried rice Meat bland vegetables so  5 Even more overpriced expected portions small  Disappointed one  Gotta better  only good thing place decor which nice  <EOR> Probably coolest Benihana to  shame they're closer strip otherwise I'd eat every day while trip   ambiance atmosphere location far more extraordinary compared others  huge bar dining area feel you're seated outside underneath stars   Keep eye elevator inside it'll come handy stuff your face wash down some hot sake stairs might little risky   Awesome spot wish San Diego location one  <EOR> So love love love Benihana's great well   service good chef funny food ALWAYS point   Definitely return  <EOR> So thought going bad experience because took 15 minutes reservation seated   also looks dead outside because sushi restaurant isn't very busy   HOWEVER packed inside!  food very good chef Rolly made whole experience amazing   If wasn't fact making reservation seemed pointless would 5 star rating  <EOR> You're paying location show  food always bit meh portions always leaving wanting just bit more   For price strip definitely better food wise but if find yourself Westgate need some Asian food your life might just meander into good old Benihana   If you're larger group sense location definitely spacious leaves no stone unturned but otherwise know expect here  Check if must but really would most likely avoid  <EOR> Worst service Las Vegas! No attention cocktail waitress hour  Waited 45 minutes sushi  People came sushi before us  Rude hosts  Never going back  <EOR> Our awesome chef did amazing job entertaining cooking us   big group kids seated far side hibachi grill adults pretty distracted but he still kept attention food truly delicious!   sushi took bit longer but servers kept informed which appreciated     Kids loved expected  show never gets old no matter often similar type place   food done perfectly   What's like? <EOR> Delicious  Standard Benihana food but everything cooked PERFECTLY   I ordered Steak Shrimp Steak great shrimp ok appetizer shrimp better    Tasted friends Scallops YUM!   Can accommodate groups 10 12 putting two tables across each other  <EOR> **LAS VEGAS LOCALS!!  end your meal present your Nevada ID your LVH players card receive 25% off your meal!! doing YEARS  since Hilton Hometown Hotspot sticker **  Benihana favorite fancy restaurant   usually only once year birthday prices little high but   I love here   I've never bad service never bad food   My favorite filet lobster     I love ginger dipping sauce   I usually end 3 4 them   dump over your steamed white rice promise its orgasmic    My only complaint last few times haven't ginger ice cream anymore favorite   I recommend highly  D <EOR> It pointless even consider going place really accommodate anyone without reservation   really lost all sense customer service  Even most busy place Vegas works hard serve customer  sad unfortunate  personally feel management terrible impersonal  once great place eat now ruined poor management   very unfortunate  would really recommend spending your hard earned money somewhere else  <EOR> I am huge supporter locally owned restaurants! However something always wanted try Christmas night Las Vegas chance  Located inside Hilton likely largest Benihana ever built  atmosphere dining outdoors Japan!

The food remarkably blah   salad even dressing better your local sushi joint   onion soup yech  steamed rice pretty awful and art rice Benihana should learned finally if myself took some chicken sauteed butter poured sesame seeds over top would taste MUCH better cost WAY lest 49 50 client pay   PS If someone doesn't eat red meat please put chicken next bloody piece steak cooking grill?  Could perhaps use different knife?  whole thing gross   Stay away  bad just good  <EOR> By far FAVORITE restaurant! chef kept entertained food as always absolutely delicious!!! first place think when planning special dinner never dull moment  <EOR> We took daughter tonight 21st birthday  11 total best time! calling few restaurants surprised many eateries fully booked Tuesday night could accommodate reservation party size  But Benihana happily took reservation ended being best thing could happened because truly enjoyed incredible meal  grill chef Tommy funny entertaining truly enjoyed every portion meal  all 6 courses delicious! highly recommend hibachi chicken steak shrimp  simply can't wrong any those choices  grilled veggies chicken fried rice also excellent cooked perfection  While prices high end totally worth all courses including ice cream dessert plus you'll entertained great grill chefs! also sang happy birthday daughter gave cute porcelain buddha good luck  Although automatically charged tip because party size added extra $25 because such great time  server said wasn't necessary but insisted she expressed such gratitude  Benihana memorable experience entire group great spot any special occasion! <EOR> The place ambiance great     but   from tapanyaki standpoint    about close bottom possible  Benihana's originals     it sure hasn't kept rest them! <EOR> I LOVE Benihana  almost 10 yrs  STILL exciting!!! Nothing being seated bunch randoms  <EOR> For long remember Benihanas standard American teppanyaki experience  Sadly think experience lost translation sharp knife used slice would be competition slowly dulling pun intended   teppan cooks tonight ok   He did standard flair tricks jokes however quickly became flustered cooking food management  where entertainment portion ended  lucky group across seated chef came before ours done  could hear them arguing manger quality service taste missed order  don't know validity argument leave that  personal option think level expertise standard teppan chef entertainers gone down    Another area concern outing kimono dressed waitress she friendly nor very customer service oriented  She forgot 2 tables drinks initial order flagged down constantly refills  Each engagement felt inconveniencing versus being felt welcome guest   The last complaint staff thanked once paying bill walking dining area! Japanese way!    Other observations When couple next asked take box given Chinese take boxes?!? find odd same time insulting  supposed Japanese dining experience Chinese one  racist I am actually both Chinese Japanese but confuse cultures! Chinese take boxes play into authentic Japanese dining experience? doesn't! may seem trivial but tells view leftovers food  paying $30 60 meal giving cheap Chinese take box LVH gift shop bag restaurant look cheap takes away experience   Its little things people     Ending good note Compliments completed renovation place looks really good feel transported motherland  <EOR> This oldest Benihana US   Was staying LVH eat there   dinner ordered steak lobster   chef very entertaining    If Benihana town check out  <EOR> Excellent service chef entertaining food prepared quickly efficiently Cost little high compared other Benihana's to <EOR> Ok Benihana know expect  huge fan teppanyaki generally but fella happens love when mentioned Benihana offers $30 birthday coupon he told sign baby wants baby gets    We came evening before birthday took picture printed birthday present  seated quickly luckily place pretty busy Tuesday didn't wait long show road  fella steak shrimp opted spicy chicken hibachi  prices much higher most other teppanyaki places  can't find anything less $25 most around $40 if want anything including steak  Fried rice also extra    Our chef friendly but hard notice pretty much everything he said scripted  chef behind 15 minutes behind table heard everything chef said repeated other chef  still fun entertaining but seen better  food just ok well  steak little overcooked underseasoned but still tasty  chicken nice spicy which enjoyed quite bit    They brought ice cream everyone table well everyone but since forgot mine but since didn't really ice cream tasted fella's dish didn't bother asking myself  even included whipped cream chocolate sauce candle all people celebrating birthdays   Overall worth visit if your birthday coupon but plenty other teppanyaki places better cheaper town if don't  <EOR> We made reservations thinking we'll eat beautiful sushi restaurant  taken am elevator upstairs small horrible smoky room teppan  No warned us  trouble breathing room trying eat overpriced tasteless food  Service friendly but she kept forgetting sake brought wrong rice mix orders  Other ppl table also issues getting billed wrong  clothes hair smelled bad afterwards throat sore  Smokers may easier time but other ppl better sure eat restaurant see downstairs   <EOR>
