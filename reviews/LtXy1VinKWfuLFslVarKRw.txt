I'm N girl     <EOR> Don't bother place     Worst experience ever   The choice McDonald's Fat Burger wife decided try place more because McDonald's crowded also wanted sit down enjoy drink two We walked bar area told guys cleaning tables could sit any table order food drink there   Well waited waited waited bit more    lady servers kept ignoring few other people sitting other tables    waited around  30 minutes more  In end patience ran walked out    left two young ladies handing coupons people passing them in     Really why    could take care customers actually there       The good news did waste money dive found place served just wanted   sadly no drinks    but awesome customer service    Check review place give dump miss  <EOR> I review bar service food table service  Why bar table read on     Bar 2 30pm only 6 people spread around circular bar  Cut pie fourths took last remaining section  bartender waited stood section didn't move area 15min not exaggerating except drinks service bar talk couple near service bar check phone 3x never once looking acknowledging other customers  Granted gave PLENTY time study menu decide wanted search phone other options  But wanted burger   Table switched table top since looked getting waited on   Again many people service slow but least some showed take order  Service was take order run drop run ask if u need anything she's almost next table drop check  Sigh  Food sat across sign saying voted best burger Las Vegas  WOW WoW wow standard burgers must REALLY low Las Vegas  niece made mission search DFW area  best burger some idea  The pattie reminded bulk stack patties once last time bought Walmart  The rest burger reminded Burger King   Note self Burger King faster better! <EOR> My husband original Fat burger fat fries coke  all delicious  food almost $30 2 which pricey but seems everything Vegas expensive  service fast friendly  food good but little overrated  <EOR> This convenient because strip buried depths hotel  There's ample indoor outdoor seating    It's typical Fatburger which means juicy burgers fat fries nice steak cut fries must  location bit pricey now just could haven't Fatburger since moved away LA prices just higher since strip  I'd latter   The wait kinda ridiculous here  no front all ordered cheeseburger fries waited 30 minutes to go order  Also burger came way before fries even though taking pretty concerned food going cold  weird because loads others fries before ask fries burger came think just kinda forgot part order   Ultimately ok meal  town because boyfriend convention just wanted grab something quick take back room since solo time  just really wanted some fat fries though   In Vegas there's many places better probably quicker and maybe cheaper I'd prefer spend money elsewhere    This location convenient enough Tropicana Hotel MGM though if need snack  <EOR> Really? charging much burger drink?  Okay open 24 hours   that cool   Okay nice bar set outside   this cool also even person does drink such myself   Yet your prices crack head crazy!  I must admit burger already made already pressed meat filler substance most chain restaurants serves you   real beef your metal tray taste difference   strawberry banana shake chocolate banana shake both awesome   Fresh ingredients those most definitely which verified having all banana completely shaken your shake   Yet charge everything   want both buns another 50 cents  Cheese $1 straw your shake $1 use restroom $1 looking direction bathroom 50 cents     They made sure some decorum retro style diner set which nice nostalgia sake   All all think should try place least once just form your own opinions but know wallet rarely way place ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING buffets cost same price cheeseburger combo works! <EOR> Came impossible burger  Yet another place no vegan bun lettuce shredded wrap won't happen  tasty but still annoyed when say vegan don't know is  wife real meat burger looked good  <EOR> It midnight when arrived Las Vegas 3am technically since came NYC  friend starving right airport check hotel drove around grab something quick eat   We ended Fat Burgers just randomly in  fat burger medium meal friend tried turkey burger  choice add topping 1 dollar each however want it  chose cheese fried egg which nice  say burgers really juicy though healthiest late night meal satisfied once back hotel knocked slept well   Great late night food! <EOR> Came drinks but ended ordering burgers too  fast food joint alcohol?! COME ON! chicken burger didn't even taste fast food goooood! Almost gourmet   maybe ? enjoyed fat fries also   We two large drinks fat fry $42 Groupon  well worth it  I'd highly recommend strawberry margarita   The waitress recommended strawberry Miami vice honestly didn't all  felt though she rushing take order didn't seem genuinely interested giving suggestions   Also asked bill but stayed few mins brought us  Right away amount bill 20% tip placed into bill holder   20 mins getting bill gathered stuff leave  waitress passed saw near exit said did ladies leave bill?     clearly asked   why wouldn't leave it?  might overthinking but just weird since group females sitting bar up   left weren't asked if paid  Actually waitress never even asked if doing okay during time there  <EOR> Walking around strip late night drinking made hubby hungry  stumbled into Fatburger   They drink special buy drink other drink free special monopolized on  greeted fairly quickly seating ourselves waitress never seemed hear me  ordered turkey burger add egg hubby ordered traditional beef burger fries    There literally nothing special food   Did someone order extra ordinary two ? got   fries pretty good however everything else average!   We skip burger spot next time  <EOR> Waiting flight around midnight never Fatburger ever try out  ordered 3 meals which totalled  $60    food definitely overpriced got  Everything crappy know never going back  Glad tried cause now know  <EOR> Pros Open super late Friendly cashier offered complimentary taste small serving famous frozen custard Good flavorful burgers especially when them hot off grill   see below Cons Long unnecessary wait very frustrating!  I waited patiently burger find ready 15+  minutes server wrong number some reason  She standing right next even asked if order few times  Lame! Would great if she offered hot fresh one    It nice try custard but didn't think extraordinary   who considers famous anyway? <EOR> I Love Fatburger but very disappointed location  husband only ordered same burger overcharged them but also order wrong  manager didn't want give back money extra nor did offer remake burger ordered it  Bottom line lack customer service especially paying $35!! Never again  <EOR> Aye if you're looking good burger authentic topics flavor right strip your spot  Legitimate burger  medium fill just fine pretty expensive add aside basics  But totally worth if do! medium chili cheese  Real chili some weird Texas Pete type ish  good stuff  Stop quick bite! <EOR> The food ok good nothing extraordinary! If you've never recommend lest once those type restaurants  sat side FATBAR but wasn't ordering alcoholic beverages lazy waitress said order inside cause door sitting area restaurant whole different owner some non sense that  <EOR> One favorite guilty pleasure spots Vegas  those places truly love you've few dozen drinks   Honestly typical burger place but burger fries A+  opinion better in and burger know people would kill saying that   The portions huge  unfortunately service slow  expect though?  They offer skinny fries fat fries  Always fat fries always add cheese bacon egg burger  Oh yeah Diet Coke because watching eating  The best part place open 24 7 your fat any time want! <EOR> While looking place eat middle night just arrived airport ended here   bad be?

Abbiamo preso hotdog e patatine Erano buoni e abbiamo speso il giusto! Acqua ovviamente gratis e corona il lattina ci sono rimasta scioccata ma d'altra parte è un semplice fast food !! Abbiamo inoltre comprato la famosa bottiglia con cannuccia ma senza niente all'interno perché volevamo solo la bottiglia prezzi delle bottiglie sono esagerati confronto ad altre ripiene   Questa vuota è costata 19 99 dollari    Piena costava 29 99    Confrontate con altro prezzi che piene le davano 15 dollari    Quindi conveniente per il pranzo ma non per le bibite bicchieri particolari che si trovano al baracchino esterno    Tutto sommato il sevizio è veloce e le ragazze molto gentili e disponili riguardo le richieste! Se volete fare uno spuntino veloce questo è il posto adatto!!! Ovviamente non pensiate di mangiare gli hamburger gli hotdog le patatine o gli anelli di cipolla migliori di las vegas! <EOR> I only word say place GHETTO!
