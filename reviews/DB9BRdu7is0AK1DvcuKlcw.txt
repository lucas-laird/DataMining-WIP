Question audience    Does Five Guys deliberately throw Fries into Brown Bag? Seems it     Regular Fountain Drink $1 99 x 2  Kathy' order    Bacon Cheese Dog *** $4 99 No further comment Kathy      With all raving positive comments plastered all over wall expected more    lot more    At end meal    figured Five Guys Burger tastes like    McDonald's Big Mac! disappointing! <EOR> Been twice but still don't know why people raving place  Burgers taste any other burgers  Maybe there's special sauce don't know about? Overall can't differentiate burger Burger King  Waste money  <EOR> I really Five Guys Burgers  few friends underwhelmed burgers prices whatever but definitely fan  seems people constantly draw comparisons In N Out and why but burgers lot bigger many toppings choose from just isn't same thing   Pros Gigantic Burgers! bacon cheeseburger 2 patties which default size jalapenos onions lettuce tomato bunch other stuff can't remember  thing 5 inches tall weighed 20lbs*    Fresh Jalapenos!! big me  very very rare any place uses fresh jalapenos topping  always slices come jar soaking vinegar dark green spicy  Those good nachos  know what's better nachos? Fresh jalapenos! They're better everything Five Guys recognizes this  Well done chaps!   Peanuts while wait! don't really care peanut but option nice  just grab paper tray fill some peanuts while wait your monster burger cooked   Flavor! jalapenos other toppings all fresh delicious  bun nice flavor beef tastes great  burgers medium rare but patties nice charred exterior taste great    Bacon!! feel don't comment one  bacon   Cons The bun  While tastes great isn't really substantial enough mammoth sized burger duties  really soft which unfortunately leads bottom bun getting overwhelmed burger juices  halfway through burger messy hands essentially just holding patty bottom  top doesn't bad but still doesn't hold up  Toasting bun would likely help even putting lettuce bottom would prevent bottom getting soaked    The fries  don't usually fries but felt try these  lot people talk good fries name why not? didn't care them all  give lot though if fries might these    Five Guys quickly becoming favorite burger chain  gigantic flavorful burgers fairly reasonable prices I think bacon double cheeseburger 6 bucks  bad almost day's worth food can't really wrong     *That's definitely exaggeration but hefty! <EOR> Honestly don't it  place any reviews higher four stars beyond me  don't mean overtly critical way nor mean say place anything two star    no  solid three  Let tell why    I walked today getting eyes looked awesome eye doc above place  asked girl working counter cheeseburger everything plus fries drink  most places would constitute some sort combo meal  seemed charge everything piece meal  All together right north $12 which seemed kinda steep  Thinking might totally worth Smashburger cool it    While waiting burger fries cool looking future soda tron  essentially soda machine touch screen allows pick bunch different types soda  far good  few minutes later someone walked asked if could ketchup something while waited food  said yes thank that'd swell  Plus points that  Then few moments later food ready  ate few spicy fries minute headed home  Twenty minutes later home ready tear into burger  O opened and    put nicely    expectations met  found smallish burger topped all usual fixings  $12 worth food?
