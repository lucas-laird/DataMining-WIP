Because weren't zone area whatever  Turns weren't even assigned waiter no wonder  time clear situation they all kept telling someone else coming clearly  not able order  personally thing against soggy potatoes specifically asked hashbrowns extra crispy came pasty white okay maybe beige  gross! eggs no better whole meal huge letdown  Despite taking over 30 minutes take order check came speed light   Left money table definitely coming back  realize everyone's experience may bad but if its bad enough inconsistent bad  <EOR> I generally overly impressed Denny's    until now  friends Vegas first time came eat twice  alaskan salmon dish dinner side mac cheese side vegetables  salmon lacked sauce but prepared au naturel   no problem however  sides good  chocolate peanut butter milkshake New!   excellent server left metal milkshake container second full refill!  Next morning came back breakfast  Omelette french toast etc  great  Coffee substandard   The service first meal dinner extremely slow waited over 45 minutes meal  However kind waitress actually cared deeply customer service wrote off half meal price no complaints   The subtracted star unseasoned salmon mediocre coffee  However least half stars for good friendly service reasonable prices  might think place located South Strip Vegas might try overcharge under serve customers  case  discounted first meal showing dedication customer well decent healthy food reviewed them accordingly  <EOR> Terrible service  breakfast around 8 30 tuesday  Waited nearly 15 mins coffee  then waited another 5 mins bring creamers  group 7 waiter very slow everything  Forgot bring waters asked 5  Brought food long wait he no idea which person order  orders ordered without cheese eggs  arrived cheese!

Good size decent quality  Something definitely own  1 senior tilapia  ERRR    very small portion  Comes two sides choose from! But decent if want something healthy   But course 52 years old and above first     1 BYO Half Sampler  chose mozzarella sticks chicken tenders  actually liked these! Reminds frozen ones could bake Costco  1 Bourbon Bacon Burger  HUGE! Awesome portion  fries side churro looking fries stale cold but still yummy  1 Bourbon chicken skillet  Coldcoldcold  don't even know say   such disappointment even though picture first time judge photo! looked lot better  felt two pieces grainy chicken some sloppy sauce poured over it  Skillet wasn't even sizzling! 1 slow cook pot roast  dishes server recommended us  tasty! But expensive quantity surprisingly hot either  1 senior grilled chicken  ERRRRR  Sure  Just note senior menu  choose two other sides this    Pros Nice service  try really do  But kind difficult eat when your server spills hot water all over table     Great view? don't know if intentional but facing right across Mirage  Volcano shows 7 PM 8 PM 9 PM!
