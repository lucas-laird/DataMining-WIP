Thank you! <EOR> One favorite quick service spots area  stay relatively healthy still satisfying meal here    My usual order is hummus green spicy sauce chicken shawarma tatziki sauce spicy carrots salad blend diced red cabbage  Sometimes combo grape leaves bomb cucumber drink    Also see says they're open until 9pm but they're actually open until 10pm!! <EOR> Updated staff contacted review made things right  still staff members don't know salad but  okay  good great especially lentil soup    Super disappointed! am regular because food good  Today WORST experience ever made look new place grab quick lunch   The new employee made side salad full sized container no big deal right? WRONG! lady I'm assuming manager duty didn't 3 minutes telling ordered Greek salad because yogurt  Firstly no yogurt small soup secondly know ordered   Rather simply apologize employee error send way she literally remade whole salad smaller container wasting previous lunch time staff's time perfectly fine side salad   If manager familiar isn't when back I believe second chances then won't going back  <EOR> Down three stars  shawrma plate consistently lacks taste tzatziki sauce zero taste    add bit garlic into it? <EOR> Service excellent food great price outstanding  only thing keeping giving 4 stars fact beef wasn't cuts meat also bit salty preference didn't offer any lamb choices  <EOR> Amazing food   Semi healthy great choice healthy going individual  post workout meal great balance between protein carb fat <EOR> Ordered yelp      had ready     good service   fast nice people      good food      im always happy eating parsley place thank your great food service <EOR> Food ok! did give sauce which listed order  Portion huge but dry ordered chicken shawarma bowl  <EOR> A poor experience other location kept trying one luckily chain changed policies location just more laid back  way come regularly kicking myself waiting long   Menu confusing first timers mostly Chipotle style setup some featured dishes specials  Wish menu more clear ingredients come dish default know you're adding omitting but staff generally good walking through steps   The hummus bowl favorite chicken preferred especially if want high protein  Unfortunately doesn't seem keep well takeout reheating  wraps easily shareable enough multiple meals pack yours everything want staff miraculously always manage close! Don't forget feta tabouli  Salads decent but favorite falafel inconsistent at times dry inside and or oily outside    Staff encountered typically polite informative efficient  serving spoons feta tabouli etc regular full size spoons rather stingy measuring spoons encountered visit other location referenced above only charged additional toppings ie more serving     least  experience  Mixed info other reviews suggests may consistent  <EOR> Excellent food service  eat once week  Chicken curry outstanding  Wash down freshly made cucumber juice  <EOR> You tell upon initial arrival place great food aromas coming fresh kabobs being cooked going good  Would recommend kabobs curry  Can't wait try more establishment  Happy found hidden gem really appreciated kind service guidance menu  hard find great Mediterranean food Las Vegas now found spot  Cucumber water truly unique wouldn't mind recipe!

I've grown accustomed falafels normally sampler plate it's 5 items mini salad    only $5 6!! hummus eggplant grape leaves tabbouleh switch 5th item something different each time    Oh almost forgot  groupon!! Must 24hrs beforehand but worth it    If you're wondering if should try won't disappointed  1 star because some cooked items aren't great but thankfully let order side item only little  <EOR> I visit place lots time can't resist back once started   Food choice fast food restaurant but offer pretty healthy  Mediterranean restaurant only serving kebab but also curry!!  Curry beef curry chicken curry both taste awesome each order come huge portion eat twice   Meat kebab includes chicken beef choose combination them which way order meat taste tender even cut into small pieces   Drink cucumber drink plus must trust me!

Mediterranean version chipotle! But way yummier! Very generous portions couldn't even finish ours! Wife did baklava but  just cause cup tea however thought delicious! Definitely stop cheap filling meal! <EOR> I no idea why place many good reviews  only ordered Eat 24 haven't dining experience  But flavors just okay always forget side sauce you've extra ordered took hour half delivered  guess could worse but still sucked  <EOR> I thinking would more sit down restaurant where order table instead chipotleish style Mediterranean food   Thought would more room inside eating   only thing good cucumber chiller which would back for   much food service  <EOR> Went because groupon deal love Mediterrainian food  say food little more pricey options very strict   We ended getting 1 Falafel side order Falafel great kinda crunchy only good when hot good home being heated 4 come side order 2 Mixture Sample plate pita salad which asked substitute rice but then told pay another 1 50 substitution feta hummus olives babaganoosh hummus super garlicy just way it very cream quite large serving feta very salty olives olive oil very tasty 6 7 served Babaganoosh excellent wish more 3 Hummus Shawarma Bowl chicken grilled salad hummus pita whole wheat 4 Cucumber house drink highly recommended but couldnt stand taste wouldnt recommended unless love taste cucumber The food ok all together but reason why give them 5 stars because service supurb  if buy cucumber drink and love husband did unlimited refills George knew upset 1 50$ upcharge rice salad he brought some rice hubby sat down  Couldnt happier!! <EOR> I stopped store order two plates  asked worker separate salad rice meat five times  He didn't know if he could it  He asked another worker worker said okay so  He still didn't understand me  He gave salad no rice  Then gave rice meat no salad  Then tried combine both rice plates into when asked two separate  If you're confused now felt too  don't know else simply state wanted two plates meat rice separate salad  Please train your workers least more workers working  Placing order especially assembly line type restaurant should take 10 min especially being only person there!  Food mediocre  better Mediterranean food Las Vegas  chicken schwarma way better beef opinion  more moist  Top some cucumbers tomatoes onions garbanzo beans taziki sauce yourself meal  <EOR> Right next 24 hour fitness thought we'd give shot eat something little healthier burger    Tasty! very friendly staff! recommend would come back  <EOR> Amazing food!

Authentic?    not  Fusion?    hmm if done properly tastefully    but its not  So it?
