Then when said other family served before told that mistake  No kidding!!

Yes! $11 good single one? Nope!  I waffle appeal though  thicker denser waffle sweet outer layer crust  Paired your favorite fruit whip cream definitely delightful little breakfast  also appreciate waffle bar theme waffle menu wine champagne bar BUT     could just easily waffles cafe same love plate sans alcohol come feeling equivalent food joy without near guilt felt paying $32 TWO single waffles two drinks  No eggs bacon potatoes     nada  minor side note each time only same waitress alone  morning she completely overwhelmed although she did best friendly she could muster through chaos still waited 5 6 minutes seated restaurant wasn't packed then another 15 20 check  family waited longer another patron let know when she moment table ready order   I felt bad but didn't over well most folks vibe very frazzled  Sometimes running where she needed be   I can't say sure back  Even if TiVoli     would rather hit cafe leonè even give Canters go  Decent food nonetheless but worth me  <EOR> Small portions  Super slow service Average food  We waited forever food never visit again <EOR> This Cafe prime example food places throw random ideas together that most cases wouldn't work expect them work  service fine but taste some dishes disguisting  serving sizes also very small satisfying  prices bit higher feel should be  walked no present welcome us  probably won't returning until some positive improvements made  <EOR> Tried pizza waffle oh delicious!  Good size too! really filling  also crepe <EOR> I'm confused why place such low reviews  amazing! party 8 sit patio including 2 toddlers every dish including salads amazing! offer 15$ coupon 30$ worth food Yelp!
