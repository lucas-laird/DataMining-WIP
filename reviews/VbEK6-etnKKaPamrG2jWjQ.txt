don't know but wouldn't stop ordering again   The Indifferent At first little leery prices  5 50 plain dog?  bit steep  But when started looking more interesting offerings like Tijuana figured those prices worth unique hotdog experience unlikely stumble across elsewhere      did take them while food but fairly busy wait wasn't annoyingly long   My only regret didn't time come back try couple other offerings before left town  least four five other dogs menu I'd try future visits  <EOR> You would Think Business name Haute Doggery would Incredible delicious bun   DOES !   ordered Turkey Avocado Hot Dog  Turkey dog Tasteless cheap quality bun White Pastie Flour cheap quality tasting Stale Hard !!!

Conveniently located near front entrance LINQ diner looks pretty clean   Service prompt   Billionaire Dog must try!  $10 99 hot dog may seem little steep but put into mouth well worth price tag!  Seriously $10 99 more reasonable generous amount Foie Gras torchon port wine onion marmalade top grilled Kobe beef frank truffle mayo inside soft hot dog bun!  IT  IS  YUMMY!! <EOR> Haute Doggery good but even considering its location Strip found overpriced   lunch Haute Doggery Friday 1 30   small joint inside would guess seats 30 max   additional seating outside just your food eat somewhere Linq Promenade well   I All American Dog poutine side   water drink told no free water options   bought 16 ounce bottle water $3   absurd given Haute Doggery located middle desert yet no free water options   would rather charge more food which cheap considering give water cups customers   no fountain but certainly would way possible   Otherwise continue gouging customers water over 300% markup   suppose bought water rather going elsewhere Haute Doggery wins   The dog comes pulled pork coleslaw bbq sauce few fried onions   onions best thing dog crispy fried perfectly   No oil all   also flavorful should ordered side   dog super messy as most menu when put many ingredients hot dog but good   close best fancy hot dog eaten but certainly wasn't bad     The poutine weak link meal   crinkle cut fries fine but needed salt pepper   gravy little thinner prefer cheese curds distributed well   1 3 didn't curds all part cheese melted into glob pull apart eat   did finish poutine buyer's remorse over fried onions   The lunch nearly $20   realize captive audience strip am sure Haute Doggery's rent insanely high   But meal delivered good enough justify price   don't regret eating but probably return soon  <EOR> We waited 45 minutes ball park hot dog could made kitchen 2 minutes microwave  gone three bites  Unbelievable  Don't waste your time! <EOR> There little most people couldn't own home  price won't back  Everything tasted canned packaged  <EOR> Stopped high roller hmm isnt anything special here   That $1 shrimp cocktail deal def caught attention reason why walked in   We order hot dog + onion ring + shrimp cocktail The hot dog ok    nothing good bad I loved onion ring  think beer battered if remember correctly   Shrimp cocktail alright    mean pay really + teriyaki sauce TOOOO SWEET !! <EOR> Different hotdogs try longhorn great good crunchy fries good poutine fries!!
