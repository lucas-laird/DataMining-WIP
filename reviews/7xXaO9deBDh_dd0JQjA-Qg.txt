To say service establisment terrible would understatement   Management clearly fault  waiter shouldn't waiter  don't want someone's thumb drink  Appetizer plates would nice have  Food decent but service bad would never return even if food free  remind waiter multiple items never arrived table  restaurant packed why experience bad leaves baffled <EOR> Happy Birthday Dinner baby!!!

When realized long waiting asked much until food came very condescending voice she told always brought salads soups first  pretty sure all restaurants just asked simple question she should responded way   When received food everything cold! seemed sitting under heat lamp while bread burgers hard mashed potatoes green beans ice cold! top Widow maker burger meat raw point where pink pieces falling off cooked pieces The food good but service absolutely terrible! back location again    <EOR> Seems quality food down prices up!!! Ordered 2 bowls chowder chocolate chip calzone total 29$!! portion size crap charged 8 99 bowl soup doesn't even come bread anymore   Disappointed use favorite place chowder ! <EOR> The atmosphere really nice  Town Square great place night out  food so so  ordered steak kabobs  served without skewer but no evidence meat veggies seen grill  onions raw no chared flavor meat no seasoning   companions ordered shrimp ribs plate grilled chicken pasta  pasta looked tastiest choice  would come back again but would definitely order something else  <EOR> Ehhhhh   I just don't know  dined Claim Jumper twice month past 8 months resided Vegas probably ordered take another 5 10 times when working more frequently Town Square  Everything unbelievably inconsistent hard give place solid rating  When food good service good place definitely 4 5 stars  But when its bad   boy bad    Claim Jumper excellent menu dessert selection  strength weakness offer little everything everyone while specializing absolutely nothing  also offer full service bar  pretty handy grab Stoli Cranberry when you're waiting table Saturday night  drinks pretty darn good especially when blonde guy Chris bar  He mean martini kind shamelessly fall off bar stool when follow hostess awaiting table   The servers hit miss  few friendly talkative gave free dessert being sweetheart  also some outright hostile slamming plate cheese toast table rolling eyes groaning when meekly asked refill iced tea  Luckily found server polite friendly thorough just request when in  sure you're willing wait 40 minutes table ma'am?

No mention taking any them off bill point either   The delay addressing inability offer satisfactory solution indicated he inept handling kind situation   He wound taking couple meals off bill only told he needed someone else paying wasn't benefit only right could be he initially argued suggestions   Frankly time whole situation awful even comping whole bill would only vaguely satisfactory   In end guy eaten nothing but extra side salads ordered thank goodness wound being another hour steak meal completely re done person finished eating alone   In short stay away! <EOR> This place over years place family over twenty years  Every chance no matter which location state its always enjoyed service meals atmosphere    Happy Hour great but really even without enjoy beginning end  <EOR> We great time service excellent food great! only reason didn't give five stars sons steak kind bland! good cut nice size just almost taste forgot season it!
