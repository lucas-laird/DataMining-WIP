Never disappoints  Great spot grab lunch  really offer bowls salads burritos regular large! Love place! <EOR> I hype here    I came high expectation because high ratings yelp  walked store around 3 40pm only person line  Lieterally took them 10 minutes person's order  employees rolls burritos seemed just started working there  looking menu while making rolls burritos front customers    I stood line 5 minutes finally turn  ordered stupid good tuna burrito crabby bastard burrito  waited another 10 minutes orders  Again looking menu standing front them thinking would faster if one  just started business but come think lot more customers waiting line waiting order  wish speed orders  Finally try both burritos  Man! Those rice sticky hell  chinese sticky rice!!!! sushi rice sure  pey peeves when comes sushi  rice most important factor but nahhhh  very disappointed  Overall flavor okay but man rice just ruined everything    Another thing did portion  am big eater but when saw those burritos bummed  Jaburritos offer almost same price but portions twice more  paid freakin 23 bucks tiny sushi burritos even good  worth it!!! Totally worth <EOR> This closest poke bowl sushi burrito restaurant near me  3 times now thought I'd finally write review   I ordered poke bowl sushi rice spicy ahi tuna crab seaweed salad spicy mayo sauce! Everything tasted good except rice bit hard  last couple visits noticed rice always that    I've other poke bowl restaurants similar say nothing really sets them apart  noticed pay almost same price maybe even less? SOHO Sushi Burrito fill entire bowl money's worth  portions seem bit small price  <EOR> This probably least favorite sushi burrito place  lack customer service meal very plain  ordered burrito but lady ended making bowl  sure happened but question food prepped when lady can't even order correct   few bites tossed it  worth $11 50  Eat if you're really only craving fish otherwise opinion plenty other better options eat area  <EOR> Customer service really good review nothing workers  They're doing great job  Onto food   Pretty small portions  guess used Sushirrito SF  portion size wasn't even biggest concern me   it quality fish  salmon tasted fishy! burping later could still taste fishiness  just popped 4 fish oil pills  thing turns off sushi joint lack freshness! Quality raw salmon should fishy! gross! When worker scopping salmon he trying perfect little scoop  fine but he scraping against canister pretty much squishing salmon  He kept re scooping scraping try mound perfect little salmon ball might also why quality fish subpar  IMO worth mash fish just avoid giving customer little extra and talking 2 cubes extra lol   Raw salmon isn't beef Chipotle where just crush fine maybe even more tender lol   Texture raw fish important! even fault though he obviously just trying follow instructions given him  He really sweet   but raw salmon just plain ol' bad  But hey don't really see anyone else complaining maybe just bad batch  give them benefit doubt  Maybe next time it'll better   I also kind annoyed when opted pomegranate topping included the crabby bastard asked masago instead they both premium toppings costed $$ add in still wanted charge it  Even though asked no pomegrante already! feel if same price point $1 49 should equal substitute  <EOR> Originally west coast feel sushi standards pretty high compared most  stopped past weekend way town 'the crabby bastard' burrito did disappoint! crab fresh didn't cut corners portions as often happens most expensive ingredients combination ingredients flavors made perfect filling yet refreshing Sunday meal  would definitely regular go to quick dining options if Denver! <EOR> Talk another solid Poke bowl sushi burrito spot Vegas  am more Poke bowl guy then burrito style  second visit made own poke bowl style   tuna spicy tuna  portion size scoops two scoops  Ironic cause most part all Poke Bowls popping around Vegas scoop universal measuring tool  LOL!! toppings much different Poke Bowl spot another come notice  Some common items tomato cucumbers lettuce edamame avocado seaweed salad on  also some toppings place stand other but more sauce then toppings separates Poke Bowl spot another  Tail Fin Sushi Burrito Poke nice selection  many remember them all  spicy mayo sauce bowl  really liked it! tasted more sirachi aioli  perfect compliment  topping all refreshing fresh  Everything looked great when going down line making your selections  very clean  quality fish solid    The staff awesome  service nothing but five stars all around  first visit came second visit  Everyone staff member friendly positive vibes answered any questions first visit talking burrito second poke bowl welcoming   No doubt if am other side town  need Poke Bowl fix coming back try more sauces more Poke Bowl action  <EOR> I'm sure entirely knew expect Sushi burritos   guess conjured some idea sushi wrapped tortilla avocado hot sauce  arrived Tail Fin massive sushi roll   Gone dainty slices sushi roll come love nowhere sight anything truly resembled burrito   However when tasked eating enormous sushi roll must engage knowledge burrito consumption order take down without mess   experience different other sushi restaurants pleasant all flavors delivered each bite roll enough satisfy   Strong work  <EOR> I order large sushi burrito name LBO i guess forgot name    delicious fresh    come back again     but price just expensive $16 more      but come back sure    <EOR> Food great always but your employees Daren Garen came off very rude   He whatever attitude left family little uncomfortable asking each other serious? Anyways food still good off behavior made good conversational piece  <EOR> Big portions friendly staff clean well lit more ask for? fish always fresh same sides  tried many sushi burrito places none pack burrito full location  rice never problem which hard other places eaten at  Overall 5 5 keep returning unless something drastic changes  favorite thing order omega some added green onions jalapeños   delicious! <EOR> postmated IG poke bowl  Food really good!

The food fresh most part delicious but placement poor whole thing falls apart your hands    Not impressed  returning  <EOR> Yet another poke sushi burrito place Vegas built own bowl $10 choice picking 3 types meat  chose salmon ahi tuna shrimp tempura  wouldn't recommend shrimp though since only gave one! could've gotten way more poke instead  Then your choice veggie toppings sauce  tried yuzu miso sauce which pretty well poke!   The hype poke sushi burritos definitely died down over saturation market Vegas great success SoHo Tail Fin just average experience didn't thrill but wasn't horrible either  Also wish seating more comfortable! <EOR> Best poke place cold sure bring sweater but super clean great summer  sure    <EOR> I happy hear poke place finally opened area don't drive far whenever craving sushi burrito   The atmosphere pleasant  walk everyone immediately greets everything looked clean  menu board pretty straight forward easy understand  OG didn't add anything extra    I looked away few moments saw burrito drenched sauce  Oh well  While unwrapping burrito noticed wasn't tightly packed  seaweed didn't overlap big gap fish rice falling out  sauce bit overwhelming overpowered everything else  even leaked into wrapping paper making everything sticky big hassle eat  Everything also soggy wasn't much texture anything   The customer service great however food much  prices also bit high compared others  <EOR> The flaming tuna game changer seriously good! usually bowl portions really filling  combo wasabi peas order  much quicker easier way sushi  fish quality better all eat fish most sushi restaurants  obsessed  <EOR> As poke fanatic looked all over town find somewhere fresh reasonably priced  place all!
