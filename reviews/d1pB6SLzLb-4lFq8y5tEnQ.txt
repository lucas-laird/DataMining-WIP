Food is delicious  could give them 5 star but noticed dish portions small such bulgogi  tiny plate $16 95   Korean friend when dined today she said food authentic Korean food!! <EOR> I stumbled into Mr  Tofu whim disappointed  True might wait bit even side dishes but all tasty didn't mind  ordered grandma like chicken noddle soup  say because tasted very homemade few sprinkles love  other half ordered seafood tofu soup very pleased  If really strong taste seafood then would love seafood tofu soup  could taste shrimp heads  All all good restaurant but wouldn't suggest going if verge starvation you'd probably die time side dishes came  Nice service though  <EOR> Be careful double tip!!!!!  The first time came everything A OK  No problems  thinking come back again review place when multiple visits  Unfortunately second visit last visit me  waiter took upon himself give himself 18% tip automatically  just party 4 baby  saw same thing Korean couple three kids  cant believe he balls fellow Korean   Some Korean restaurants take care other Koreans preferentially  C'mon know true!  least waiter day equal opportunistic egotistical person endeavor shady business practices all people  He took 18%   above average tip typical 6 more party some lack luster service  He didn't even refill glasses water once   Maybe wouldn't pissed if he just took 15% tip if something stating gratuity automatically added bill   guess he thought highly level service though    Hell if he just refilled water would given 20% tip  F B industry know goes  Immaculate service earns 30% me   easy  Maybe he thought he bombdiggity server just tired foreigners visiting Vegas stiffing him  Heck sympathize  Europeans some Asians abroad don't tip diddly   In addition tipping escapade sister asked waiter bowl behind counter   He unnerved said he would bring table  5 7 minutes later bowl arrived   He busy calculating counting tips   No kidding! bowl right behind him  He could just turned around grabbed bowl behind handed sister  Unbelievable! guessed earned auto tip mind   Could new thing Vegas when 5 more gratuity included now  Would nice know If  case Nothing gratuity stated anywhere he failed mentioned he added tip already   bill just total  Almost double tipped him   Good thing fought over would pay   Wouldn't noticed otherwise   Anyways soondubu tofu soup pretty good despite only receiving handful banchan items   If come though check your bill first   don't check it   maybe you'll receive average service auto tip OK you   highly doubt though  guy just does basics delivers your food   I can't believe took another bad experience restaurant write review Yelp again   Geez! <EOR> Great food!! Very traditional Korean food reasonable price <EOR> Mr tofu tasted really bad  love eat soondubu jigae  but place killed it  All lot ppl told restaurant really good vegas  friends eat soondubu  asked waiter mix mild  waited  when soup came wasnt even boiling  Ive many restaurants soup boiling egg cook  looked soup felt watery  soup looked only water gochugaru base  would rather drive california eat soondubu then eat restaurant again  <EOR> Reviews right slow slow service!!! However very affordable $8 bucks Tofu soup Pretty good soup very simple menu far $7 bucks 2 small ass pieces Kalbi Galbi Short ribs    Kind rip off buy pound already marinated around $5 bucks per pound your local Korean market    <EOR> Perhaps living area heavily saturated Korean restaurants given high expectations but mouth must've literally dropped floor waiter said Vegas  Let explain     My family loves Korean food  Even when vacay Korean food menu  entrusted task selecting Korean restaurant dinner   Mr  Tofu first restaurant popped great reviews  Upon walking noticed only but few parties eating peak dinner time weekend  should've first red flag    Their menu very simple  offer soondubu handmade noodles bbq other various rice dishes    Banchan  guess super spoiled  super chintzy banchan here  only gave 5 different dishes which continuously ask refills on  pulling teeth  spicy cucumbers chilled tofu tasty par something I'd Ktown LA   Beef handmade noodles  Rather tasty noodles appear look plain bland  Think duk bokki but cut into strips  Super doughy noodles served clear broth only but couple pieces meat  add some thick kimchi suace just give some flavor    Kalbi  AKA galbi  meat super fatty very tender  when all mouths dropped  ordered few side orders kalbi which costs $7 00  Imagine shock when saw sizzling plate few pieces kalbi  literally strip kalbi cut into pieces  expecting two strips least! When asked side order he responded Vegas  rip off!   Service horrible  You'd think food would good amount charge  SKIP! <EOR> OK highs only 80s am supposed eat?  Mr  Tofu bowl some boiling hot sundubu   tonight recommendation several Yelp friends   disappointed   There only 2 tables occupied service quick   ordered beef sundubu spicy hot   found hot hot expected   Next time ask some extra spiciness   Before soup came he brought 5 banchan dishes   especially enjoyed kimchi pickled radish   When soup came he warned very hot bowl contents take care   soup excellent   Good slices beef wonderfully soft tofu hearty broth full flavor   I can't give 5 stars because first sundubu nothing compare to   Suffice say back   real comfort food Korean style! <EOR> BEST TOFU soup ever!!! Even Los Angeles can't find any tofu place thats good Mr Tofu  just something soup!!  Not much free appetizers especially when compare Socal tofu places but actual tofu soup 10 folds!  Service ALWAYS slow always understaffed  very friendly but rude if friendlier would give 5 star    Definitly come food!  If line place think should just across street Tofu Hut DON'T!!!!  Its WORST tofu place ever! find ironic best tofu worst tofu soup ever tasted just across street      I stop every time visit Vegas thats pretty often those knows me    If haven't tried simple MUST! <EOR> Wow great soon dubu!
