After long night walking tirelessly walking down strip EXHAUSTED  time returned hotel circus circus around 5am  extremely hungry frantically searched 24hr delivery services  harder thought  couldn't find single pizza delivery service open during time    Frustrated downstairs found small deli inside hotel  prices bit there   think turkey sandwich $9  But decently sized big portion meat it  Also sandwich did come condiments  put mustard mayonnaise yourself    The sandwich tasted heavenly   but might because ravenous! <EOR> My friends stayed circus circus during visit vegas  place place night clubbing  Everything big portion reasonably priced  recommend chicken salad beef sandwich  guy friend ended buying four beef sandwiches during three day stay  Also staff really friendly  Highly recommend if stay circus circus don't wanna drive anywhere some midnight snack  <EOR> Service pretty bad    workers slow just don't care  spotted female worker dipping finger customer's fountain drink drying runny nose same hand  Unfortunately she did finished eating footlong hotdog she served earlier  feel sniffle now wonder if coincidence  don't think 'll coming  back particular deli  <EOR> Everytime visit no matter where stayed strip vegas would come strawberry short cake hear no longer very disappointing im sure shortcake best menu      BRING BACK !!!!! <EOR> 3 1 2 stars!  Out all casual food offered Circus Circus think Westside Deli more decent places go   If find place through poof smoke engulfs entire casino give try   authentic AUTHENTIC deli but hunger pinch   Plus ever Circus Circus weekend?  damn busy!  Westside Deli shortest line   Sometimes seen bad thing but thankfully worked OK   Westside Deli offers deli sandwiches its main roster but does other mostly American fare   Seems decent enough place quick breakfast speedy lunch to go   nachos chili foot long hot dogs soups salads even tacos   I focused go to when visit new sandwich place Clubhouse $8 99    triple decker sandwich toasted bread your choice sourdough roast turkey crispy bacon lettuce tomato   sandwich comes dry if request to go because mustard mayo packets available side take along you   Nice touch because no likes soggy sandwich   If choose eat ask if want mustard mayo your sandwich   Sandwiches also come your choice chips coleslaw potato salad pickle spear   potato salad   Verdict!  shabby!  Sandwich actually HUGE barely fit take container!  Lots sliced turkey bacon actually crispy   Lettuce tomato fresh bright   liked could add mustard mayo separately because add much little like   Pile creamy mayo baby!  also packets salt pepper available adding fresh tomato gave some flavor   Plus potato salad without pepper!  Love potato salad ton pepper some reason always have   Overall good sandwich some pretty good store bought potato salad   portion large money ended taking half home snack later   Good lunch fare   I would back again sandwich maybe try something else menu   Only problem hardly ever Circus Circus I'd hard pressed drive just Westside Deli   If you're staying hotel good option more authentic deli experience should somewhere else   But pleasantly surprised  <EOR> Pancakes felt dry  When doused syrup tolerable  However due mystic properties batter soaking syrup into pancake expelling into pocket dimension didn't stay moist long when cut into pancake find interior bone dry  1 star taste  5 stars breakthrough realm material science  <EOR> I clubhouse which club sandwich turkey bacon lettuce tomato  Mayo side  more expensive thought would but portion HUGE  Came chips which surprisingly good  bought 20 ounce soda FOUR dollars!!!

Grouchy while taking order  When received food literally thrown plate burger even put together all over plate when complained food thrown plate she dismissed refused fix it  When came back around she talking customers rude her   And literally said Deli why expecting 'cafe' quality? next customers  Which doesn't sense but okay    I shouldn't tipped she doesn't deserve it   Jaunita have poor customer service a bad attitude no people skills over all very unpleasant person  <EOR> Pretty good   ordered chili dog even though read said foot long didn't registered properly mind  way big but chili just good only able eat half plate!
