Sadly because inconsistency service     I used come lunch group half dozen people work once week because genuinely loved food  But depending helping experience amazing complete dumpster fire    We only ever helped two people younger dark haired gentleman might owner? older gent baseball cap  If former helping great lunch  He welcoming engaging energetic usually even remembered favorite orders  Drinks refilled promptly food came fast appetizers hot perfect everything awesome No worries  But if latter guy working dining room? shoulders slumped soon walked door  Because knew disappointment    Now genuinely feel horrible criticizing second guy because feel culturally insensitive bully  don't want pick him  But sad truth always significant problems literally everything whenever he server    To begin significant language barrier there  feel worst white privilege jerk alive saying really do   Since guarantee English way better Vietnamese  Props even trying but still  quickly learned point things menu rather ask them order avoid look confusion we'd get  Which honestly restaurant authentic international food operated immigrant family usually no big deal  But quickly became when orders still wrong regardless  weren't guaranteed you'd asked for     But wasn't end it  Some liked specialty Pho bowls but wanted two meats left out  we'd special order bowl brisket flank steak meatballs tripe tendon just ask tripe held  guy always argued every time without fail saying bowl just flank meatballs essentially same thing  would try gently dissent saying left two meats mix  he'd eventually agree  Buy then when actual Pho showed Yep   Just flank meatballs  Except more case flank meatballs but tripe added even though wasn't even part bowl  But we'd grudgingly eat anyway because still hell bowl soup  But nonetheless left bad taste mouths other reasons   But more  lot more  Drinks water un refilled  Other meats would show bowl weren't wanted ordered  Appetizers ordered but wouldn't arrive  Sometimes took 45 minutes lunch  He almost always neglected bring basil limes bean sprouts other garnish even if asked it   you name it  just always festival ball dropping  always multiple things wrong whole trip every single time things other guy always right    Eventually just started making other plans lunch since always crapshoot would day just weren't willing risk anymore     Look obviously family owned business hate criticize them  doubly hate ding them because stones come foreign country open business go  Huge props that  man   When they're ON  said probably best Pho ever had  But when there's person holding down fort just lets standards order accuracy customer relations service completely right big mirrored window   ? just hard back no matter good food least half time   Point you'll overjoyed disappointed here  Five stars food service when guy in  Two order accuracy service when guy two  Average three  hope address service issues though   We'd start coming back  <EOR> Food OK   house special Banh Mi pretty good served pho broth which nice   dubbed French Southeast Asian Dip   bun noodles chilled prefer   They're some items  Service slow   nice see Vietnamese place part town give A OK rating   lot better but bad  <EOR> I say Pho much better expected   Great broth base soup perfectly done rice noodles  <EOR> The waiter did wait me   He took order disappeared   don't believe vegetarian soup actually vegetarian  Tasted good though  <EOR> So am bordering between 2 5 3 stars  really really really broth but portions little bit ridiculous cost  noodle portion smaller size palm seriously would probably fill 5 year old but 30 something year old woman hungry husband  would think large pho would pretty filling but think might ploy spend more money extra large especially when already charge more standard pho place Chinatown  Yes isn't Chinatown but when spend almost 30 bucks two pho tais egg roll expect fill up  egg rolls need more lettuce  2 tiny pieces lettuce does cover 4 egg rolls  going back only because broth pretty good but home more noodles  see if dine portions larger but if help don't because kid size portion  Oh yea beef pretty good but must more noodles! <EOR> Very fresh veggies  broth very flavorful  No boba only sad note   Easy plenty parking   Spring rolls good peanut sauce good  <EOR> Ordered chicken pho spring rolls  forgot spring rolls but gave noodle bowl chicken pho looked fridge long time  Probably won't going back <EOR> My friend ordered some spring rolls while she waited arrive  arrived sat down chatted bit noticed no came take order  waited few more minutes no one  kept looking over two ladies sprawled comfortable neighboring booth noses phones entire time  put bill table left  tried sushi place next door no came greet sit us  Third time charm ended going Indian place same plaza  Wonderful service  Skip pho place  <EOR> We love food EARLY delivery!  son friends swear sandwiches taste delicious! love pho   Fresh great tasting food <EOR> Lamb Eggrolls Meat rolls wrapped Betal Leaf Shrimp sugarcane Viet coffee comes already made no neat contraption served table    Loved unusual ethnic items menu order try  Located outside chinatown stopped dine day Red Rocks climbing  Normally delve into abyss options available Spring Mountain  Glad made stop because didn't miss authenticity factor    Our waitress looked recent transplant although she could understand English she still learning speak hers    The lamb egg rolls most memorable part meal  gamey lamb flavor really stood out  4 rolls $7  also able sample friends meat rolls wrapped Betal leaf  taste very different!
