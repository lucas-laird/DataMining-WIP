Hier wird Qualität über die Menge definiert  Riesige Portionen die sehr satt aber nicht wirklich zufrieden machen  Nicht wirklich schlecht aber halt auch das typische Mittelmass und amerikanische Austauschbarkeit  Abgesehen davon Sehr sehr typisch amerikanisch auch wenn das Lokal versucht sämtliche Italieneische Klischees zu bedienen  Manchmal mischen sich zwar spanische Sätze die Dekorationen der Wand aber ist ja alles Europa     Am Nachbartisch eine ganze Hochzeitsgesellschaft  Las Vegas  <EOR> This second time eaten there   first time great over year ago   Now family night was'nt very busy   start tried cram into small booth then everytime asked server anything i e  ex napkins condiments drinks   etc she would disappear twenty minutes   food which all supposed fresh dry unappatizing   Overall very bad experience  <EOR> One fav restaurant   banquet style serving casual ambiance  Others reviewed pricey but personally size serving think its priced very fair   always end leftover least next day's lunch Tiramisu DIE FOR!!

Today's lunch experience really final straw  arrived lunch party 2 empty hostess stand  nobody else waiting  stood around 10 15 minutes before cook peeked around corner kitchen let know someone would shortly  probably 5 minutes later when hostess showed seated but felt forever   Every single time taken way WAY long food arrive ordering it  includes today  didn't look long since ordered when finally food but probably around 30 mins  lunch  unacceptable considering 1 little people restaurant 2 party 2 seated received more complex dishes within 10 mins ordering   boyfriend's chicken also very obviously reheated  chicken telltale signs cold around edges extremely hot middle  Actually whole meal probably forgotten then stuck microwave  just sad looking  generally baked ziti Buca but mine wasn't really great tasting compared previous times it  don't expect chain restaurant fresh that day and super amazing ingredients but    lunch disappointment   I think unhappiness scared off waitress  She came only twice food served  First she asked lunch going almost immediately ran off before could say more okay   Then she dropped off check box ask some random plain clothes wearing guy the manager probably it  Then same guy picked check brought back card said goodbye  walked place right waitress didn't say anything  Sorry lady  I don't know  still genuinely Buca's tiramisu least until just ziti  think if ever really desperately crave dishes again just instead having sit through such awful service  <EOR> Bread cold tap room temperature water tasted unfiltered gross tomato mozzarella basal no olive oil vinagrette !  Vegas location smaller proportions regular restraunts   Vegas restaraunt does offer certain menu items such penne arriabata    Where consistency quality control  Buca company owners am disappointed your different locations vary far menu options    Maybe should talk Cheesecake Factory consistency menu options <EOR> The first far only time gone pretty good experience  unaware family style  date    But ended making date much more interesting since come agreement heck eat  Staff very friendly especially host!

Service great! sure if time date but good I note because according other reviews flaw Food great almost awesome classic big portions  Overall great experience definite come back would suggest outside expresses more inside is! <EOR> We recently held small wedding reception location 2 18 12 would absolutely recommend restaurant anyone ANY kind party  First off if want reservation celebration sign contract  damn well better sure EVERYTHING verbally promise put into contract  lady talked phone Jennifer said rooms semi private  partitioned meaning off side would own space mull little party  all showed wedding go bad experience  tables weren't ready everyone hang packed lobby 15 minutes it February quite chilly outside really only option besides sitting cars   When called back room would great party but sat 3 additional tables us! Instead letting spread sit comfortably amongst booths tables crammed many could into long booth table combinations anytime anyone booth area bathroom entire side table shuffle about  When asked manager he denied even offered private rooms though passed many walk through restaurant   Instead checking sales coordinator he made pull contract phone right he could point contract does specifically guarantee private room only reserve right changes only attempt honor seating requests  decided just sit down shut best it  servers nice food good but whole thing just felt rushed  still able little toast hang but could tell other 3 tables felt really awkward having share space party clearly intruding though no fault own   When came time pay bill jerk manager begrudgingly gave discount inconvenience  sister noticed included reduction servers' tip   When asked jerk manager he looked quite disgusted made snide comment everyone going suffer this  found absolutely unacceptable poor waitstaff $2 13 hour suffer mismanagement end left them rather large tip  couldn't clear fast enough while all trying coats say good bye having dodge busboys slinking through trying clean could seat another large party  ended going Buca because Maggiano's required much larger reservation fee actual private room  retrospect wish would gone them price would worth having put manager  <EOR> The service absolutely horrible  reservations 11 two weeks advance  management knew coming yet didn't prepare group  hardly drinks refilled ordered basic items off menu took them almost 2 hours food group    TWO HOURS   Twice hunt down staff ask refills water   Once bill came came roughly $35 person which included tip  Looking $35 would definitely recommend dining here  food taste mediocre best  $35 could other establishments 5 course five star meal  great hang friends  all agreed revisit Buca any future group needs <EOR> This restaurant going downhill  m guessing since other locations opened nearby hotels where sent all worst staff  recently waited front 20 minutes no staff nearby help end shift anything no excuse staff member least checking walk ins upfront  Once finally seated staff running around crazy trying take care few patrons braved dinner experience  It no means crowded bartender helping orders  kitchen messing orders then fighting staff over it  Took over hour food  Meatballs burnt everything else okay  many different locations CA WA NV never experience highly recommend trying different Las Vegas location shut down soon  <EOR> If LOTS time your hands then come give them try   But waiting over hour now just main dish bit ridiculous me   Waitress seems easily distracted especially since she confused order  bread super cold  sure if  norm  But took good 35 min just finally receive that!  don't think ever come back again  <EOR> I'm mad even saying food bad   just wasn't happy   The service decent food plentiful    seems going quantity over quality   I wasn't really impressed any food except pizza okay   best way describe food generic  wasn't blown away hoping be   I visiting Las Vegas 30th birthday local friend kept telling place   She hyping going orgasm each bite   hell yeah there! Well short sightedness smacked face normally does     I am fortunate enough grown Italian American family Italian Italian American neighborhood grandparents barely spoke English more Italian restaurants disposal count   I should thought through before saying yes  <EOR> Absolutely worst service ever had  booking 8pm Open Table found restaurant doesn't accept reservations 5pm  why does Open Table book reservations 5pm? Because clearly Buca di Beppo doesn't Open Table reservations based terrible experience restaurant    We seated bar area didn't see server 15 minutes  Finally someone working bar came over took mercy us  ordered drinks appetizer main dish  15 minutes later drinks appetizer thought things going okay    How wrong were  literally did see server rest visit  asked someone entree waiting another 30 minutes snapped restaurant busy  finally entree 90 minutes  could believe it  Servers kept walking past table completely ignored us  Obviously happened  never assigned server because bar person took order didn't follow up  waited waited check which course never came either  walk front ask hostess bill   Clearly Buca di Beppo does care customers especially those Open Table reservations safe say never return  <EOR> Heard place friend said food great pricey considering couple minutes away strip  Katy mentioned seafood linguini which amazing!!!

Anyway server took drink order   Then completely different server came over asked drinks wanted   explained already taken care before he asked if before   saying yes he started explaining sizes dishes again   kidding me?  Thankfully while he going through exact same speech drinks first server he left     Anyway won't bore details food   above average Italian chain food   Better Fazoli's good Olive Garden   Service average speed   wait bit long drink refill especially considering only couple other customers     Where experience horribly wrong end meal   visibly done placed all plates edge table nobody came over give check collect plates despite passing several times   OK   Eventually server came over cleaned asked if wanted remainder food boxes   said yes asked check well   He took two dishes back box came back put remainder mashed potatoes piece chicken asking if OK combine two same box   said sure he put them together saying would no way he could eat two foods touched   OK sure why felt need tell but whatever   Still no check   Eventually both friend standing waiting leave waiting another couple minutes bartender ask if could check   He ran off came back bit later said way   waiting another few minutes all way front where 3 staff members practically begged someone bring check could leave   Finally few minutes check but wrong   took another few minutes correct finally could leave     An absolute failure respect service every way   If mess badly party 2 when aren't busy only imagine bad would large group if busy both  <EOR> Buca di Beppo fairly affordable comfort food comes very generous portions  restaurant very nice  decor place gave off home cozy atmosphere    The service really good food came faster expected which always great! great place eat families because family styled dinner share plates each other   I wasn't fan sangria  tasted someone mixed orange juice threw some fruit chunks  <EOR> Buca's great place group family  plates large portions good share  If your group comfortable each other ours pass each dishes around table sample everything!
