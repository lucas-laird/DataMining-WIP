Anyways place job prices somewhat reasonable   6 bucks burritos Carne asada fries 8 bucks  Food good little much American Mexican food burrito sour cream cheeses beans guacamole pico de Gallo choice meat carnitas! Very good choice! Tender meat burrito smaller expects Mexican place but over all good taste!  My kids quesadillas meat now those big!!!!   But if anything guest service best! gentleman behind counter Victor pretty chill genuinely nice super nice kids!  Like said past service big deal me!   People come first food but return because service!  We coming back!! <EOR> The term Super definitely relative  definitely   large comparative MOST spots LA    but say VERY flavorful  good balance cheese vs meat vs beans vs guacamole etc  Loved all components available each bite well   No pics because fast    but would back    probably nachos  <EOR> Average Mexican food w good service   corn quesadillas chile relleno burrito tacos   really street food nor super except prices   during day next Olympic Gardens might distracted   Plates available   Good beans drinks  <EOR> The burrito bland ordered super burrito carne asada  Honestly felt burrito overpriced taste  balance ratios meat condiments weren't correct  Service good which why getting 3 stars  <EOR> So see new spot end strip called super burrito    Let's just say am SUPER disappointed!!!!!   Let's start time walked two people flirting each other then started ask prices which female didn't know   She began take order then all sudden interrupted  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while stood waited  complete order   So ended paying $9 04 top $0 45 debit card charge whatever no biggie   I excited because when Baja give full plate  But when look to go plate which even full size plate even full little over half full  reached cook asked all over $9  He said yes   asked little more he said no   informed disappointing would come back  He responded  fine Spanish   shocked response informed now leave review place  Again responding  fine     At time requested money back   usually takes lot write negative review but place horrible unprofessional portions small employees don't know own product busy horsing around flirting  never back sure spread word  <EOR> Sadly Super Burrito CLOSED  now some place called Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas  apparently specialize tortas  still Super Burrito menu but anything but  Quite awful unfortunately    Hopefully other location Eastern still open  <EOR>
