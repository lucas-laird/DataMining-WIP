First off would say seeing restaurant long excited try expectations set wonderful experience  Well everything except server crumbled all that  party four ordered many appetizers entrees drinks without cost being factor  crab which ordered dry 2 ribeye steaks dry well didnt resemble ribeye other main course entree shrimp shrimp surprisingly small few which didnt justify price  Overall very dissapointed only ok tasting thing dozen oyster which served 2 lemon slices ofcourse ask more which no shouldnt to  <EOR> Slow during Sunday lunch hostess sat immediately  Hostess chewing gum wearing white pink socks very visible  Upon sitting server Maria came over before completely sat down asked wanted drink before looked menu  She left dirty plates table  ordered bacon wrapped shrimp which great  Ordered crawfish bread gumbo both HORRIBLE  Talked Maria gumbo because supposed Shrimp sausage gumbo but no sausage dish server said doesn't come but menu says supposed to very important know your menu server   Talked manager Marcalla she accommodating  <EOR> I am California grew having great sea food   husband live Las Vegas now 10 years took Landrys dinner children  ordered shrimp fish crab oyster plate    food horrible   extremely fishy   Good quality seafood fishy all   fried oysters tasted bad thought going food poisoning   Everything mostly stuffed that  Almost no pure seafood   seemed bad seafood would just into patty stuffing crab other items cover lack off quality  also extremely salty   don't understand why business  Las Vegas   think all business tourists off strip   local let know  Vegas way better this         cannot  express enough bad     think worst food life    think good ratings restaurant may posted employees corporate office    please save your $120  Plus dollars choose another location    probably safe any upscale hotels seafood restaurants insured wonderful experience    Also service very slow watress switched   glasses when she brought  back drink refills wasn't  noticed until drank others cup grossed    If take cups refills don't bring back clean cups better sure going correct person  Oh gosh ask place settings even dinner brought  managers just stood around watching disatisfied customers bit did nothing help anyway  Over all shouldn't business  don't want give them even 1 star  <EOR> After having read such great reviews several years tried early Mother's Day lunch  disappointed! decor hasn't changed all time opened recall which made lighting tables difficult best for aging parents   Service standard nothing special  Food fair  thought tried lobster bisque before enjoyed it  time way much cream no lobster! saw lot fried seafood options lot shrimp  'stuffed' choices turned mostly stuffing very little seafood all  Definitely returning seafood again  I'd rather pay bit more enjoy meal  Nothing recommend anyone  <EOR> $70! 2 kid size portions! husband originally Louisiana excited Landry's some hone town favorites  However deeply disappointed  ordered fried seafood platter husband ordered beer battered fish chips  seafood platter extremely small unseasoned  never seen seafood platter small before  literally 5 French fries 4 oysters 4 shrimp 1 stuffed shrimp 1 small piece Basa stuffed crab few strings fried onions  $23 99  Now way platter worth amount  husband also very displeased amount price  visited Landry's New Orleans LA Lafayette La  size plates enormous well seasoned worth price  completely shocked Landry's Las Vegas  restaurant once knew  Something needs change because experience 4 star Landry's experienced restaurants Louisiana  chefs Las Vegas restaurant need take lessons chefs Louisiana Landry's  must season seafood! complete garbage otherwise  price portion size should size kiddie plate  Presentation also must! food looked thrown plate no neatness all  defiantly would recommend Las Vegas location visit again  Serious changes need made restaurants chefs cooks  need given instruction properly cook serve Landry's dishes  <EOR> Went dinner saw Landry's  Immediate seating 8 pm booth  Kyle server did excellent job explaining menu  Mahi wife crusted shrimp  both cocktail expertly made numerous refills water  Kyle former Marine young am ARMY vet along great  Stop Thank Kyle serving enjoy meal  People discredit restaurant need lesson good food tasting <EOR> My meal excellent service excellent staff all extremely friendly   I travel Vegas work few times year definitely retuning trips   I during middle day greeted big smile warm welcome hostess   My server Sparky he easily provided best experience restaurant Vegas   The food great  all things life pay for    The manager Hi Rich! even took some time drop table chat few minutes sure meal satisfaction  <EOR> Had dinner weekend   arrived few minutes late reservation but guests time seated already almost 15 minutes drinks hadn't arrived yet immediately concerned because restaurant maybe 25% occupied   waitress arrived she very nice took drink order which bottle white wine   particular wine expensive but under lock key manager took good 10 minutes   Concerned   waitress arrived bottle glasses apologized delay fine she seemed making effort   She took appetizer order ahead ordered entree's knowing expect   opted fried portion menu  why here   Fried something thought would fun allow kids try something new   Gumbo all around chicken sausage   generous small bowls  everyone did it   Salads good also   wedge blue cheese which something may once every couple years   good   fried shrimp entree's arrived everyone again seemed enjoy   gulf coast typically would order fresh fish blackened vegetables   all knew fried   lived Vegas twice totally 15 years only word heard Landry's locally Yelp prior making reservation    Which great but if don't hear some local chatter  usually sign maybe consider something else   table off slow start but into comfortable rhythm far food delivery  wasn't lot team work help clear table dishes completed   first beer glass still table when left if tells anything    I back sure   nice dining dining room   staff friendly kitchen did good job   may even attempt fresh fish next time something little more challenging kitchen    We all know ordering fried doesn't much merit but fun food did enjoy it   know restaurant years believe they're doing most things right   Would recommend?  Yah would based time experience but couldn't recommend anything outside own personal experience yet  <EOR> Food tasty good sized portions  Place nice atmosphere leaning more towards being casual place low key service well   server friendly let change fries grilled seafood plate   Bread good but ask says menu  <EOR> Does measure Joe's Crab Shack  Or red lobster cafe alto fish market  but waitress great <EOR> Excellent food even better service beautiful ambiance   definitely back! <EOR> This used favorite place seafood  would visit several times month  However last three visits subpar  Im sure if new management kitchen staff but food quality gone excellent fair  <EOR> Took friend celebrate birthday she loved lobster tail said great   tried specials included warm spinach salad which best had   I'll back try bisque reading reviews     Our meal leisurely place wasn't busy   wasn't expecting packed town where much cheap food available   But say waiter excellent food better many places been   parking lot easy access plentiful both plus  <EOR> Make sure ask Mariano   amazing service he knows he doing  He personal needs always made smart effort sure experience way above excellent   back more <EOR> Service wasn't issue server rest staff very polite  food just wasn't par considering price  Lack flavor didn't give fresh seafood taste either <EOR> Went BFextrodrinaire dinner compare contrast previous experience Joe's Crab Shack   Actually 2 places couldn't more different but intent sample lobster bisque both places see if could arrive consortium regarding its preparation   start ordered seafood stuffed jalapenos    with Landry's seafood stuffing inside jalapenos cream cheese jack cheese    word DELICIOUS!

Thus 5 star rating     My wife usually eat bar area just because things more casual more social staff obviously staff there   drinks great happy hour second none!  special trip often just take advantage it   also rewards card where rack points use them all over Valley   If haven't ever restaurant sincerely recommend know worth visit   may your cup tea but someone lives Sin City where some greatest restaurants world solid restaurant   isn't super high end anything but does meant provides great seafood fair price great service   really don't know more would want  <EOR> Mediocre  gave no spoons took way long bring viddles received tiny cup tartar sauce fish prices high  clean but glad boyfriend took because now know don't want back P <EOR> I order lunchbox special fried zucchini crawfish meal  Both delicious  recommend both dishes  <EOR> Seafood house   hmmmm? seafood chain that  Well well well surprise food really good  3 stars no reflection food slow service  Although server polite he seemed bit nervous he slow restaurant crowded all    I ordered seafood gumbo start which something rarely order because grew gumbo often homemade taste restaurant  Now saying tasted Mama's but very flavorful filled lots seafood  also oyster po boy  huge thus making really difficult eat but oysters seasoned well atop lettuce tomatoes spicy remoulade sauce  definitely stop next time see Landry's none California   <EOR> I came hubby 2 boys ages 5 6 friend  sat down menu amazing didn't even know where start  Las Vegas wanted eat somewhere nice    The atmosphere very welcoming laid back even though fancy factor  dressed very casual but also people dressed suits well  busy all even though prime time dinner  restaurant itself very clean menu items reasonably priced portion sizes  could definitely share ended ordering way much food    What ended ordering Crab Spinach Artichoke Dip tasted very much ocean? little salty  didn't taste really special? kind actually disappointed  If compare something would probably tuna salad    nothing special here    Fish Chips  serve lot dishes fried onion curls kids actually really enjoyed  dish however nothing special but Fish Chips didn't expect anything fancy anyways  Kids liked it    salty adults      Crispy Fish Sandwich  friend liked overall but again really salty    Enough share though!   Shrimp Jambalaya  use Jumbo shrimp really satisfying spicy yum but comparison Bubba Gump's Shrimp Jambalaya good  consistency more soupy sausage missing?   Fried Seafood Platter  ordered came assortment fried seafood  1  Fried oysters LOVE fried oysters good but overly SALTY    picked batter off just ate oysters  2  Stuffed Blue Shell Crab impressed stuffed some sort bread used cold water shrimp    would rather them use less medium size shrimp but also really salty me  3  assortment shrimp served fried onions fries  shrimp didn't wow    just battered shrimp  stuffed others just battered deep fried     All dishes came house salad your choice dressing complimentary garlic bread  garlic bread good but want seconds good    House Balsamic Dressing interesting unique taste    sure kind balsamic vinegar use but definitely am use being served  liked though   They serve your food courses  appetizer came first  Salads came second then your meal  feel going fine dining experience  waiter friendly but did refill hot water me  However he did refill everyone else's iced water    They also offer 10% Military Discount but did since asked card ran    It also birthday gave tiny Creme Brulee could probably finish bite  guess must spoiled cause RA gave giant deep fried tempura ice cream served raspberry chocolate sauce hahaha!   Overall    would recommend place friend don't think going back    cannot speak other dishes  Maybe just didn't pick right ones? sadly think much did order those items blew mind    <EOR> Exasperated long wait Oyster Bar boyfriend decided check Landry's  7 30pm Saturday no wait  restaurant 3 4 full  server nice welcoming  ambiance great date night    The oyster bar trash great small plate but warning indeed small portion  talking small pile crabmeat 5 shrimps small scoop rice! However lump blue crab blackened shrimp tasted fresh delicious  Both well lemon beurre blanc accompanied dish  broccoli side dish stir fried lot good flavors going on  could any defiant kid eat broccoli! clam chowder chunky fresh satisfying! complimentary garlic bread great clam chowder    My only gripe Coronita came food  server didn't exactly update drink either  follow she said new bartender didn't understand order  She assured drink soon its way  She genuine though wasn't huge deal    I don't know if I'd return many dining options Vegas  restaurant actually off strip too  Perhaps if wanted try Oyster Bar but gave again if wanted quiet dining experience away strip I'd consider coming back here  Overall solid dining experience definitely rescued hunger exhaustion waiting line Oyster Bar! <EOR> This place solid 3 stars  Definitely its pros cons  came Saturday night around 8 30 dinner  Sat bar happy hour which until 9pm Saturdays Sundays  ordered shrimp embrauchette some cocktails well full meal each    The embrouchette wonderful  Seafood stuffed shrimp wrapped bacon onion strings  $7 happy hour  Definitely highlight meal  ordered seafood pasta which pretty disappointing  mussels very overcooked just underwhelming $20  friends fish chips decent though   Service 3 stars too  lady herself bar area she seemed very nonchalant everything  think she just ready home    I don't know if I'd come back next time Vegas  high standard seafood restaurants Landry's just doesn't really measure up  <EOR> They all eat Alaskan snow crab Tuesday Thursday   Its served all day   crab meat taste good but shell difficult crack due seemed if sitting water shell become super soft   house salad good dressing <EOR> Good food overall  Service excellent  Nice atmosphere  3 steaks ordered table  all happy meals  mahi mahi entree decent  Customer Service important won over! <EOR> Sadly chose restaurant February dads birthday brunch somehow review evaded being posted hiding drafts   clearly understaffed front house poor server trying best but there's only much woman do  don't fault lack staffing all  food however horrible  husband dishes tasted very similar  Bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed shrimp  Ewwww  Most likely precooked loooong before served because both extremely mooshy  No texture all  dad liked crawfish etouffee but hes 71 year old smoker   he likes everything! Haha all liked stuffed mushrooms calamari average best  returning  <EOR> From walking into door being seated greeted staff feel home  Everyone helpful  tell real team quick dollar  bartenders know exactly doing busers done quick table ready next guest  kitchen staff phenomenal do  landrys place be! <EOR> Decided early Valentines dinner wife avoid crowd  pass Landry almost every day last 10 years lived Vegas decided give try  Between breakfast dinner eat least 5 times week  What TOTAL disappointing adventure  We started happy hour drinks which ok but then jus downhill quickly  We ordered two appetizers zucchini calamari  Zucchini ok but calamari sucked seafood restaurant!! Next shared seafood platter which came bread salad  On platter seafood stuffed crab shell which almost all breading shrimp bad sauce some kind fish bottom plate portion VERY bland white rice   My drink never refilled waitress sort disappeared  Manager came ask everything told she could see leftover food plates  She did take six dollars off $49 bill  After watching success Tillman Fertittas Show billionaire buyer very unhappy going back which shame because support local businesses  When home saw left wallet restaurant  Busboy found gave manager said safe waiting pick up  Must say when back restaurant all seemed order  coursed asked person turned tipped him  applaud honesty <EOR> Excellent happy hour every day lots deep discounts  drink eat very cheap bar plenty choices full size well  <EOR> $70 bucks poor service watered down pasta free loaf garlic bread search menu       inquire waiter        and then constantly remind because accidentally forget over over again        me thinks not  Also I'd peg them false advertising sign outside says ask $20 four course meal then inside realize 2 4 courses glass water mint end  high priced me   *UPDATE*  Tried conference off put treated group forfeited catered meal took business elsewhere    STRIKE 2 <EOR> Worse red lobster  kidding  Food came soggy disgusting  Probably frozen seafood fresh  Embarrassed took parents when visiting Asia craving some American style seafood  Ughhhhhhh! <EOR> Emeril nothing worry about   never tasted burnt water before but now have   bad husband ordered thinking he getting seafood gumbo   But wait!

Happy Hour starts 3 7pm daily bar  later come harder find seat since only 5 booths regular sized bar  really should take some dinning room turn into happy hour area!   pomegranate martini favs  spinach artichoke dip crab balls calamari usually always ordered when group friends  and when friends spend less 50 bucks group food drinks  we're usually pretty happy!  The bartenders servers pretty pleasant well  All all good happy hour spot  <EOR> The ONLY reason getting 2 stars instead because manager   really wanted seafood didn't want deal strip decided check Landry's out   loved New Orelans figured couldn't bad   right?
