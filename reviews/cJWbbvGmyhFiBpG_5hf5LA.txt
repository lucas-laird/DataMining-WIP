When manager believe name Mona told she said waitress would find way around it  told would wait again if didn't it  Yeah could again no thanks  Now just want your money stuff many just buck  <EOR> Went Hofbräuhaus around 7pm Sunday evening  dining hall loud would left right then but told could order food bar  bar area much quieter  food ok nothing spectacular  asked bread given slice rye bread plate  kind sliced bread buy grocery store sandwiches  When said only piece bread? bar tender Joey replied sarcastically only put order want another order put in?

I've traveled all over Germany place mimics fun beer halls Bavaria   say mimic because fairly authentic but still reproduction true festivals Deutschland   The food very similar found Germany but quite freshly prepared   flavors good most cater true meat eaters   Almost all sausages cutlets worth trying   But let's talk value   pint beer costs $8 terrible Ice Tea almost much Germans don't know Iced Tea    $20 entree $6 salad $1 50 slice swiss cheese schnitzel $2 bread whole host other charges   Basic food beverages 3 people $78 before tip   Then all tips   Tip waitress tip musicians they even come around begging horns tip bathroom attendant hands towell but can't keep bathroom clean   geez good thing didn't valet!  would never find kind pandering Germany! Well need tip bathroom attendants Germany but least keep bathrooms spotless during non festival times  So while good elements place don't recommend it   If interested authentic German meal quieter setting recommend Cafe Old Heidelberg very authentic food albeit slow service much better price   Tchuss! <EOR> Nach mehreren Monaten der USA muss ich sagen das dies eines der besten Restaurants war  Entlich wiedermal ein Koch der etwas von seinem Job versteht! Speziell für Vegas ist dies auch nicht überteuert und Musik vom feinsten errinert zurück die Heimat  <EOR> We Friday part Frozen Fury weekend  reservations ready time  server very polite all order right  atmosphere awesome especially since filled other Kings fans  Das Boot 2 liter filled Oktoberfest which delicious  ordered chicken sausage eat but total 3 liters beer can't give honest sober review food but loved it  ladies walking around $5 shots spanked paddle  She hits hard!

How ridiculous! The only reason giving 3 stars instead 2 because great dessert  Although skeptical ordered special which strawberry rhubarb strudel which pretty good taste texture   I'd give 5 stars Hope review helped! <EOR> Beer awesome   Environment very cool different other places   Lots music interaction musicians stuff   if feel adventurer try getting shot spank!   seems hurts   did try but bunch other people did     Very cool place  <EOR> Bayern Las Vegas    Klar das hat noch gefehlt  Ist aber verflixt gut gelungen  Leider leider ab vom Strip jedoch nicht ohne Shuttle Service natürlich  Eine riesen Halle im Bayernstyle  Die Amerikaner lieben uns dafür  Reisebusseweise werden sie angekarrt und vertilgen von Riesenbretzel über Schweinshaxe alles  Klar ein Foto mit Maas ist da gar keine Frage  Sie freuen sich über jedes ausgelutschte Volkslied das die Band anstimmt und man selbst eigentlich nur noch augenrollend ertragen kann  Aber nach gar nicht all zu langer Zeit macht es einfach nur noch Spaß   Schunkeln Singen u say Cheers German ohhh PROOOOST sehr lustig und lecker  Da kommt fast sowas wie zaghafter Nationalstolz auf denn als echter German ist man da drinn natürlich der Hit  Allerdings die Preise waren auch ordentlich gesalzen   aber macht das schon nach der 2 Maas  <EOR> Zum Glück gibt es das Hofbräuhaus LV  Jeder der aus Deutschland kommt hat nach 3 Tagen Bud Bud light Budweiser oder die ganze andere Plärre die man als Bier verkauft bekommt dermaßen Ransenblitzen dass ein Weg ins gelobte Hofbräuhaus unausweichlich ist  Das Bier ist lecker die Speisen durchweg schmackhaft die Bedienungen auf Zack und der Preis angemessen Wenn man aber bedenkt dass man den Hotels auf dem Strip zwischen 8 und 9 Bucks hinblättern muss um etwas zu bekommen auf dem Beer steht aber schmeckt wie geschwollene Füße dannist das Bier im Hofbräuhaus recht günstig  Auf jeden Fall ist es zu empfehlen!! <EOR> I came birthday friends recommended family friendly lunch spot little outside strip  informed Hofbrauhaus celebrates birthdays differently other restaurants  offered shot alcohol which initially declined but waiter persisted wouldn't let say no accepted take drink  He then told before could try pose next table over  thought picture   but instead waiter put hand back pressed table slapped hard wooden paddle three times echoed throughout restaurant visibly red welts ass because wearing shorts time several days later    Initially thought joke did family friends but shortly incident police medical help called because couldn't sit down incessant pain  x ray when hospital showed very deep contusion tailbone  several months since still can't sit down without tailbone pillow regular pain meds every single day   Any other restaurant would compensated food left mid way through meal when happened because much pain  But no police I'd called report incident told if didn't pay for food didn't eat beer didn't drink we'd arrested paying bill  only did pay everything drink caused COMPLIMENTARY but restaurant owner waiter said done all good fun  Hitting someone hard buckle knees can't stop crying isn't good fun    I never informed going hit  never consented being hit  never thought celebrating birthday could turned into such bad experience  completely ruined trip Vegas because much pain couldn't properly sit down several weeks after  would recommend sad excuse restaurant  service poor staff's behavior crass dangerous least strip clubs ask before touch woman much less try hit her   <EOR> I lived Germany 6 years love German food  know owners put lot effort into place but just can't dig it   Hofbrauhaus Vegas great place celebrate birthday raucously  Jaeger girls gladly spank birthday boys band usually bachelorettes birthday girls enjoy special Alpenhorn the things Ricola commercials concert close personal  If you're fun things supposed slightly embarrassing place  Just don't expect conversation place echoes dickens   The interior good replica original but without spurs years smoke habitation  walls warm color there's German style painting near ceiling  stage plays host German bands weekends  unusual see few German couples dancing Disco Fox Living Next Door Alice  Ein Bett im Kornfeld  band plays mix German English pop don't scared off few German titles   The beer garden area doesn't echo much much more relaxed atmosphere  actually outside though which slightly disappointing   Usually food excellent but most recent meal red cabbage favorite German food spicy if someone added Siracha  couldn't even eat it  Sad panda! potato pancakes salmon excellent salmon fresh sushi quality   There's valet parking but most folks usually park across street Walgreens  Between parking noise now spicy red cabbage I'd recommend other places  <EOR> This place big party house   loud music big plates food large beers  However if free beer coupon don't expect much still spend big money meal 10oz beer  Yep little tiny beer those large mugs   The food ok  extremely salty  beer was    well    beer  sure wasn't worth $20 liter   Oh if want drink das boot expect pay even more those boots extra  side note server mentioned gift shop told servers they're required sell retail fired  They spankings  full spanking wooden paddle behind   All buy shot  Crazy   But OMG s**t hurts!!  Those girls seem lot pent aggression  guys aren't nice either  Expect bruise souvenir   This wouldn't helpful review if didn't include employees The host s look pissy   very friendly sure hell didn't place feel welcoming  The server s sad   may smile speak all positively happy but ever just people watched server? servers place walk around looking miserable   don't look happy   The random man standing against wall  Seems important but looks jerk  Doesn't smile doesn't socialize looks he's looking something wrong  He phone  whole time except when he'd wander kitchen  The manager s usually easiest find  ones hold down fort  manager noticed guy seemed run around frantically whole night  He should calmest entire bunch   When see kind DEPRESSING CHAOS business wonder where coming from  doesn't just come customers     I don't think returning personal choice  would much rather somewhere better vibe doesn't empty wallet  <EOR> The beer hall style dining unique  host seated another party four which really livened atmosphere cheerful laughter conversation  service great food authentic expectations  serve beers large glass boots which fun drink of  also gentlemen stage playing instrument singing while lady would paddle patrons seats  love öctoberfest! <EOR> The schnitzel good average schnitzel  Probably some better schnitzel find US  potato salad different potato salad Germany but still good  burger very good quality tasty moist  would highly recommend burger  would normally expect  Black Forest cake very good moist  sauce die for  Hofbräu beer true German beer common most restaurants  would recommend restaurant anyone visit  good close authentic German meal  <EOR> I three times now overall views   I don't care acoustics building sound heard!  The band sounds good but whenever person speaks into microphone sounds muffled garbled its impossible understand  If correct atmosphere even more party like would much greater participation customers  only couple tables nearest stage understand because closest stage monitors which clear crisp   It would nice if everyone especially those answer phone hostesses informed going on   I planned compete Octoberfest competition even brought seven friends cheer on  dinner drinks but when came time contest management said didn't know why happened earlier time scheduled   I called checked first times checked website even looked newspaper put table! All three sources confirmed two contests per night Fridays Saturdays   My friends left very disappointed more management's total lack customer service anything else  did nothing even attempt right just made excuses blamed others   I guess just feel successful don't need even try  <EOR> Kitsch its finest wouldn't any other way  long standing tradition meeting group friends every fall we're never disappointed  music fun food German not everybody's cup tea but always giant pretzels beer deliciously large people watching spectacular  Prost! <EOR> I told try Hofbrauhaus before left Vegas some co workers  Man glad recommended place! atmosphere loud but expected when entertainment never ending  Going Monday night thought would smaller crowd but decided reservation  Glad made reservation because place packed!!!! started white wines pretzel appetizer cheese  Delicious!  point already feeling full but decided try some other things  ordered some German weiners but tasted kind over done Oscar Mayer hot dogs honestly    which why place did 5 stars me  potato salad came meal absolutely amazing! Never any potato salad taste great! Needless say great experience but would probably order schnitzle something more authentic next time  <EOR> Very good schnitzel good service but apple strudel very sweet place super duper loud   Its big German beer hall lots people laughing shouting   All noise bounces walls cannot hear any conversation   Good beer too  <EOR> I know place gets bum wrap prices  second time wouldn't change world  other side beauty experience never pay dime  Special events tattoo convention  Opening night party tattoo royalty  awsome then put free food booze into mix more guy ask for  sausage meatbals pretty darn good ad dunkel beer fantastic  So much fun many fishbowls full beer  Thanks Mario Barth <EOR> I must start review saying wait staff servers restaurant great  friendly appeared enjoying work    The reason only three stars found overall experience just experience  only few restaurants unique therefore experience provided people want try mainly because lack ability indulge solely German beers foods anywhere else  gimmick because own market gimmick food just ok  beers tasty but hard mess pilsner    I am glad once but now have? won't need return  <EOR> I love atmosphere food great sing dance if aren't shy  <EOR> This place much fun  Everybody drinking gigantic beers german food delicious  pay little extra but its worth because atmosphere great   Also if order shot jager paddle you   Seriously  hurts good <EOR> I am Las Vegas conference   Hofbrauhaus  Last night some friends   place loud Taxi service good back hotel     The food wonderful   Its party place   If want good time Las Vegas places go  <EOR> Do expect authentic German food there  Red cabbage could better better potato salad myself bratwurst should served mashed potatoes where did ever idea?   $3 soft pretzel  Really??

Maybe some but sure isn't even close  other hand admit even original Hofbräuhaus really decent place begin with  lives legend ain't place where locals anymore     First time group international guests all over world including some real Germans specifically Bavarians  German did find place very accurate but instead simply selection certain stero types most world thinks typical German qualities  starts music an Austrian band played evening beer which indeed same beer served finishes wannabe German food  Very few available dishes really German most seemed americanized variations which understandable since most Americans would probably dislike real German food begin with     waitress took care group simply overwhelmed place would expect staff least understand if order menu properly pronounced German  evening she placed several orders incorrectly troubles getting drinks right order     Would again? Unlikely  think most Americans would enjoy place? Sure no question that  <EOR> An adventure start finish!

No  But regularly ignore   So left two stars  high quality food all items imported Germany including fine beers tap Schnitzelmann never bad schnitzel wurst plate even salad here  two potato salads offer also quite good Kaiserschmarrn dessert made just Mad King Ludwig Bavaria's day   One star granted party hearty atmosphere  Schnitzelmann celebrated bachelor party long benches tables free flowing beer made easy new friends revel waitresses spanking customers request it  same atmosphere minus spankings during World Cup European Cup Fussball matches which televised live which many knowledgeable enthusiastic German fans come    But regularly Schnitzelmann comes always sense afterwards he could spent time money better elsewhere he such fan German culture other German places town he would Hofbräuhaus considerably less often  <EOR> Great food service place blast! must try it  <EOR> Hofbrauhaus far off strip good place group friends colleagues  If looking loud fun atmosphere different your typical night club scene big hotels venue meet your needs   I  especially traditional German folk band playing audience participation   The food mediocre but beer atmosphere that  <EOR> Excellent restaurant classic German beer food  meals fantastic prepared professionalism  Last time when family fast polite service  haven't attended well past just saying clear  <EOR> It's Hoffbrauhaus need more said?

made noobs feel welcome I hate when somewhere front desk folks just give vacant expression   445 Monday no wait   Waiter very helpful explaining beers food specials  decided share plate pretzel he graciously provided extra place setting us  Schnitzel heaven pretzel mustard cheese dipping sauces gorgeous  Couldn't happier even if prices bit high  Still worth it   Also family restroom changing little ones breeze  Always gonna give points that  <EOR> I dinner since never German restaurant before   food very good pretty reasonable   only compliant food delivered very fast 10 15 minutes

move beer garden   She very polite allowed move there   could still hear live music but least reasonable volume   So if drunk crazy hard hearing or combination thereof you'll enjoy main room   However if don't fit into any those categories then find beer garden much better environment   If don't hear lively music dinner don't Hofbrauhaus  <EOR> Visited May 29th 2011  My friend Kerri made

This place just lost 5 spots list Vegas restaurants try when am town trade shows  <EOR> This ONLY replica original Hofbrauhaus Munchen USA   German folk music singers dancers  authentic sometimes hey Munchen    Everyone very diversified clientele LEGALLY forbidden worried sad  All big smiles cheers course shouting Prost   Waitresses dirndl warm nice  Even petite waitress Hong Kong trying hard exhibit cleavage Wonderful place Vegas  BTW also buy collectible biersteins still made Germany <EOR> I staying Hyatt Place next door tried decided take HB  ordered dinner special pork cutlet Bratwurst Schnitzel creamy mixed vegetables  wait 30 minutes before getting take order  food tasted good but expensive $21 57 typical size meal  place live band diners dancing having fun  mood lively entertainment atmosphere beer drinking enjoy place  <EOR> Look no further  Great food excellent beer if time right show  Love jumbo pretzel sweet mustard  Don't miss red cabbage its hit cinnamon  good  <EOR> Just another tourist trap Vegas  Shame me  should figured if Hofbrauhaus considered tourist trap Munich else could expecting place   It looks classic beer hall atmosphere festive live Bavarian music  hefeweizen beer excellent if expensive  food just mediocre main basis rating everything Hofbräuhaus Platte which samples most classic Bavarian entrees oversalted  <EOR> Real German Food!  I live Sacramento CA usually come Vegas week once every year while attending CES convention   lot places sure visit eat them   Looking around don't really German restaurants Sacramento  mean restaurants Sacramento categorized German but German themed food your meats potatoes such   place actual authentic German dishes which look forward Sacramento sorely needs   When first walk into walk into small merchandise room where find assortment German themed items clothing some them course Hofbrauhaus's name into it  Beyond two rooms sure name first room but walking through room arrive beer garden portion room   first room slightly dark lit always come dinner always band playing there  very loud room   prefer eat beer garden where can't hear most music  those looking happy lucky fun time eating drinking singing first room you  When hostess asked if wanted seated close far music she took proceeding sit first room but further band   tell actually meant beer garden  looks specify beginning   Most patrons first room beer garden more empty although slowly fills well   ordered drinks shortly   food came surprisingly fast bow food good   did notice teh waitresses weren't busy even when more people started file into beer garden   spent lot time talking another  sure if good bad thing but did ways away whenever needed something right there  Very attentive? attentive?  didn't bother much     Also think root beer might house made   Drinking really couldn't distinguish between type root beer but pleasantly sweet   If love German food haven't tried German food before hit place up  <EOR> I am big fan Hofbrauhaus  Maybe beer maybe live music maybe atmosphere  knows? must all three right?  OK  ALWAYS Jumbo Complete  Don't pass up  basically large pretzel cheese mustard  Great appetizer but sometimes need more one   Have good time swing your glasses dance all like  <EOR> Went last night  sure expect   advertising really doesn't say replica Oktoberfest but think  aiming  Clearly beer highlight   Bf loved lager huge liter stein! which fyi doesn't list price menu We also dinner  Good flavor  Tasted other German food before albeit bit processed? Ok price strip based meal across hard rock hotel but treated if Strip price wise  Didn't 'get your ass paddled' thing all bf wanted shot fireball once he girl paddled behind hard may add ? Price reasonable shot $5 Total bill two liter beer I didn't drink two meals tip $80 <EOR> The food great service very good   atmosphere exactly expected having real Hofbrauhaus   sing along kinda hicken Dance very German   Definitely place drunken younger crowd   evening topped off guy puking guts Men's room! <EOR> When Oktoberfest done held October where fix genuine authentic german beer shnitzel live band? Well Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas answer yearning question  mention hot bavairan waitresses your service  live band performs Hofbrauhaus daily basis  haven't come lunch but always oktoberfest when come dinner  food ranges shnitzel sausages  If apetite eat Bavarian some side dishes such french fries pretzels  pretzel also symbol eating Bavarian  well beer well  If want something sweet also order biker beer biker beer consists beer mixed sierra mist  Back when started drinking beer age 26    wasn't into whole beer scene biker beer did me  Yet love grew taste lager    need straight 1 liter german lager  don't order food enjoy live entertainment  Some couples just order beer  But experience true Bavarian food won't able experience elsewhere should try shnitzel art  If shnitzel your thang try bavarian sausages sampler  Its good drink some soup too  would suggest goulash  appetizer would suggest bavarian pretzel  dessert    would definitely say strudel! never wrong ordering essentials recommended  it! Enjoy! <EOR> Simple German food great environment  Great service music entertainment  food being quite bland American palate should know going in  big downfall place ridiculous almost crazy prices  prices just bit over NUTS  Absolutely downright madness   even city where things expensive  I don't recall Hofbrauhaus outside Cincy being bloated price  19$ plate fried fish and gross super cheap Tilapia top that 16$ couple chicken sausages   The beer also pricey but off food  13 99 pretzel some side fixings  Yes giant pretzel but ridonkulous ridiculous  I'd say come beer share pretzel entree scoot if REALLY want come here  Otherwise spend boatload very simply flavored food!! <EOR> Things ordered 1 Jumbo pretzel Served spicy mustard sweet mustard some combo cheese spread   slightly crispy outside nice chewy inside   cheese spread delicious   pretzel good but would've better if warm   2 Hofbrauhaus hahnchen Grilled chicken mushroom sauce spatzle   chicken nice juicy mushroom sauce nice intensely mushroomy but spatzle annoying bland   first time having spatzle wasn't sure should expected but no amount sauce able help out   Our server's name Sam she awesome   She gave some great advice menu very funny   smacking butts shots truly entertaining   dinner show!

Number one place overpriced both Schweinshaxe Mass more twice expensive expect Munich even during high season high priced Oktoberfest weeks  whatever paid cut half subtract another 25% tax tip included Germany idea would paid any plenty Munich Bierkeller brew houses   number two just charge much more Schweinshaxe also just give half ! it  cut middle wife half other easy puzzle sat right next each other   happening any Bavarian places  pay ! Schweinshaxe Schweinshaxe  Anyways guess just adopted quickly U S  capitalism    Bottom line would back next time am Vegas but if living would every week dining place  <EOR> Came slow time no craziness going on  But ordered pork sandwhich fries  pork amazing!!! would definately reccommend this! husband likes beer liter hef beer  also signature pretzel which tasty well  <EOR> Great atmosphere place  Great Bavarian dishes choose from  food great service excellent giant beers help too   little pricey but paid for   highly recommend  <EOR> My review little biased because love German food Hofbrauhaus  Munich franchise locations northern Kentucky well    Loved food most importantly beer  great server made everything much more fun   Public style seating gets meeting new people too    If you're Vegas never German beer garden before recommend going even if just pretzel 1 litre beer  <EOR> One favorite places Vegas   Great food  Atmosphere much fun beer perfect!!!

I once before lunch parents when no band no crowds hardly any beer drinking    On Saturday night girlfriend came friend knowing expect  wandering gift shop waiting seated all could hear screams cheers loud music grown men screaming pain paddle spanked adult women  WILLINGLY spanked women large paddle  Hysterical    We seated table right front band where group four already sitting drinking having great time  Immediately upon entrance band asked everyone stand stand tables National Anthem  Drunk people swinging mugs around shouting American pride!

We immediately ordered beers pretzel  Hofbräu Original beer delicious! am huge beer drinker but beer smooth wonderful light taste it  must ordered least 8 them throughout night  When pretzel came huge salty soft delicious  dipping sauces two different mustard cheese tasted great especially cheese! may because feeling bit tipsy but really enjoyed pretzel three ate hurry    My girlfriend shared HB Riesenbratwurst which slightly small sausage roll sauerkraut onion mustard  tasted delicious! sausage bit smaller expected especially price but overall flavor combinations wonderful  Again may attributed buzzed taste buds knows?

Especially looks all guys faces  Only guys guts butt withstand guess  waitresses also all dressed German dresses which further adds ambiance  Would given more stars food better  <EOR> Very good atmosphere  High ceiling long wooden benches real German band playing appears traditional german music   Forgettable food  sausages did any distinct flavor  Taste almost ball park franks supermarket  Black forest cake more cream cake  Minus 1 star   I would come back beer join band singing dancing but eat elsewhere  <EOR> I can't believe place good reviews  served cold stale pretzel  bartender back bar almost entire time over hour   didn't even bother getting entree planned  managed only 1 beer stale pretzel 1 5 hours because bartender non existent  Pathetic  <EOR> Atmosphere Monday evening pretty quiet   would try weekend full effect   Only other couple seated table plenty room set large beers plates food   band playing however only played two German songs kind disappointed   Still larger groups getting pretty rowdy fun interacting them!

OMG   I started planning return because serve specialty 4PM   Alas stay LV only couple days say dance card filled    just keep tastebuds focused borrowed picture pork shank   return       Maybe oompah band playing   #495 <EOR> I really wanted love restaurant! Something new   fun  Good German food  Well miss miss both things  Starting off service sucked!! Worst service ever! blonde waitress alot black eye makeup can't remember name she ignored quite some time  She finally took drink order apologizing she very busy  Lol  OK tried understand but bill 102  Dollars think deserved good service   She never asked if wanted water food was  She didn't know menu all I won't even elaborate The large beers looks amazing   well!!! Nope!! served almost room temp  Mugs even chilled   There's few walk around shirts  Specifically saying quest services  he ignored 's well   Whoever manager !! Really needs more proactive start training servers !  The food below average opted vegan dishes dry over cooked no real flavor  Hubby sausages which ok  But still seemed sit long all juicy  band fun experience!! Although tip jar pushed face entire time   It funny experience  worth talking about   But stomach food  Nonway!! And horrible service really never want recommend place   If just want see people take shots spanked!! u want drink warm beer hear Oktoberfest Style music then definitely just but don't looking good customer service quality food all <EOR> BEWARE DAS BOOT and manager So HBH sells beers boots  Pretty awesome wanted one  Friends ordered them 5 minutes later slips paper saying acknowledge beer sold separately  Looked menu sure enough dumb plastic boots 20 bucks   Definitely did see menu nor interested squeezing plastic boot carry on  told waiter did want boot made mistake very sorry but wanted beer poured into glass steins did buy   FIRST fully acknowledge mistake mine  don't agree appreciate manager did afterwards    He came over anticipating apology confusion instead guilt trip fact can't reuse 2 boots he poured eat cost  THEY'RE MADE CHINA! much cost? 5 cents each? He even awkwardly paused going jump offer pay them   Haven't restaurant manager before but don't think customer feel guilty hopes pay wasted product part restaurant manual  <EOR> This might work large group German beer fest considering atmosphere decor   However aside free 10 oz beer would recommend authentic cuisine     Beware sell sides add ons    would pretzel while wait your entrees $14 00 Would your curry side $3 00    take picture your group? No thank you!    I wish could given better review    but four five stars reviews led try restaurant misleading   Buyer beware    atmosphere beer plus    food value strong negative <EOR> You need drunk enjoy place  servers should consider covering cleaveges average age above 40 doesn't look attractive  place dark loud band annoying subjective opinion    The food mediocre best definitely good value money Las Vegas  should twice cheaper somewhat competive    I am coming back won't recommend anyone  <EOR> Loud boisterous full drunken fun!   Hofbrauhaus ya sorry guys sure umlauts but  intended fyi    Hofbrauhaus quintessential rowdy restaurant where some tasty beers good eats   always find myself party type situation mostly birthday type   Honestly atmosphere fits doesn't disappoint!  They live band playing both American German folks songs while your drink grub keeps lively atmosphere going   beer 1 4 1 2 full liter mugs available depending your thirst level   IMO best time come funnel some beer into your gullet around Oktoberfest   Oktoberfest beer awesome highly recommended   But off season dunkel hefe just fine   I've only few dishes but usually gravitate toward veggie options   few veggie items available including veggie brautwurst comes complete sauerkraut mashed potatoes   also tried chicken braut they're similar enough really   side salad healthy sized plate well if you're looking something little smaller snack side good option   Also before forget soft pretzel really nice   especially nice when fresh pieced off dab cheese mustard sauce 'shmeared' on   yummyyy   Pro tip alternate sauces when going pretzel    trust good time   Good times good beers pretty good food Hof!  don't come often but definitely lookin' toward Oktoberfest more seasonal German beer goodness  <EOR> Beer good   Dessert just OK   apple strudel   Service worst part   visited place when first opened years ago   Back then hostesses bar maids your typical blonde tan pretty buxom beer girls   Now?  tatted 21 year old Mexican chicas just old enough carry beer   Don't wrong   love latinas but lost look going back when opened   Also hostesses don't care service just want seat table others sitting across you   Now understand concept communal eating beer gardens   plenty but when empty there's only 2 people table really sit right across them?  Apparently yes   tried sitting unobstructed view band told scoot down   Why?  Because hoards customers would eventually flock destination   Never happened  <EOR> This place brings back bad taste mouth literally point    Place loud barley conversation which okay if your wasted The seating very crowded more few times all party bumped tot he table behind wise   The drinks mixed drinks really weak tasted friends drinks worst off food ridiculously salty   The pretzel came needed glass water per bit dipped hotter mustard sauces mask saltiness   the food also extremely salty 4 8 guys ate us  many jager dish way salty I threw few bites pretzel two bites jager sausage plate much salt am sure its salt since didnt drink any alcohol whole day The only good came going decor fact see some people smacked hard moneymakers cry   I cant belive never back  Ill stick hotel eat across street should group friend ever want eat again  <EOR> Hofbrauhaus! event!

Throughout your meal live performance interactive very lively  Expect sit random people if small party  waitresses  fantastic really add some spunk your visit if you're bold enough paddle    Honestly think two people share plate dessert too! schnitzel fantastic fries extra crispy    By way if dessert try icecream warm raspberries  highlight evening   vanilla icecream  nicely paired tarty warm raspberries  almost resembled marmalade  sweetness soul! If mix between hot hold tarty fruit definitely check dessert out! <EOR> Forget Oktoberfest all SPANKfest  never spanked HARD before!

Well order shot watch happens  must see  <EOR> The atmosphere seems bit Disneyfied though reliable authority while much smaller more less approximates genuine beer hall Bavarian tradition      The food good  If sausages should quite happy even salad comes them   briny half chicken above average schnitzel enormous large pretzels unsurprisingly great liters German beer   They bar but beer obviously stick if want properly spirit place   dunkel gives more flavor your $14 L    fortify shots schnapps dirndl clad army waitresses tempt approximately four times hour     There two areas both indoor large where live music plays second somewhat smaller room decorated faux beer garden   where little luck comes into play if arrive good hour you'll only table main room but also you'll surrounded people know customs beer hall songs toasts   Without unpredictable element if you're bringing your own you your time Hofbrauhaus easily fall short mine     Expect pay indulgence prices you'll lucky under $85 per person beer dessert  <EOR> I've Germany original Haufbräuhaus   atmosphere location great but food horrible  first time lunch least 7 years ago mashed potatoes tasted box saurcraut fresh properly rinsed   Just Oktoberfest  celebration  excited hopeful food changed   Nope  Ordered large pretzel  share   Pretzel came cold bit hard  excited tho currywurst  since craving since left Germany  8 currywursts life most disgusting currywurst ever  mess street cart food currywurst?!

Place kind half ass Ikea beer house  Could great but isn't <EOR> Delicious German food friendly staff  big fan German food begin but friend back roots try taste Germany   The prices bit high but being strip expected  <EOR> Looking back realize trying impossible   hoping would genuine replica famous Bavarian brewery first introduced beer  visions pork shoulder giant soft pretzles course liters delicious beer   I guess three ain't bad   This Hofbrauhaus isn't much look outside but once step dining hall realize very quickly you're getting into  setup very true original high celings oompah band short skirted waitresses  Slowly however things started seeping in  closest thing band came genuine German song 'chicken dance'  looked all around those big pretzles compliment beer much only find pretzle comes your meal small hard variety   very dissapointed size portions too  girlfriend sausage entree came minimum sides pretzle  share plate 'Schweinebraten'   food good but really expected more  Aren't German dishes supposed fill up?  I very satisfied beer though  tasted did three years ago stick original dunkel  When comes beer don't come variety come quality   Also really loud don't come expecting nice quiet dinner your sweetheart   To recap food good but ripoff beer great atmosphere mediocre best  know set bar high but even factored wasn't great experience  Would come back? Only if someone else paying  <EOR> I really wanted love Hofbrauhaus just moved Germany Vegas craving German experience   won't back    authentic all nothing place Munich   I called first sure great alcoholfrei biers Munich since pregnant  said yes   When acted confused option bottle usual hefeweizen etc   waitress apologized not so smart hostesses answered phone   super aggravating!  ordered jäger schnitzel wasn't schnitzel all but dried pork chop Americanized   German food doesn't come many toppings garnishes pork pounded thin   also cold   and pricey!  reservation 4 but two running late   only gave space table two   The keg tapping Oktoberfest also lackluster   Maybe if haven't Munich you'd find mildly entertaining  If keep those memories skip vegas location  <EOR> Hofbrauhaus located off strip good beer decent food  Beer served ice cold giant frosty mug communal tables know your neighbor if place crowded  Overall wasn't impressed food but atmosphere beer good  would return next time am Vegas  <EOR> First time visit establishment hearing ton good things co workers   town trade show first place visited dinner drinks spot   When walked thought walked through time machine back few decades restaurant Germany   Once inside forget even Las Vegas   some might good others deal breaker   It loud   band playing sounded German folk songs   Oh wells when Rome say     Service good   friendly   fast   Beer sausages   else would want?  some plates pretzels deep fried item remind tonkatsu   The gal walking around paddle shot glasses cool   few group paddling which suppose popular within establishment   say each own  would come back but beer loving crowd   If need quieter place eat drink look elsewhere   say Germany gut essen !!  Enjoy! <EOR> A star each word describe place  Tourist Trap  Being Chicago many excellent choices German restaurants which gives little credit knowing talking about   addition ate drank Hoffbrau Munich   Based those qualifications wouldn't recommend spending your money here     Everything way overpriced aren't embarrassed it   pretzel appetizer good sausage platter wife good but jaeger schnitzel terrible   wasn't any thing schnitzel it   just breaded pork cutlet sauced jaeger style   schnitzel until pounded flat   cutlet didn't experience hammer blow one   The beer excellent   very fresh   fortunate enough tapping dunkel wheat which done Vegas performer 15 minutes later glass table   maibock which still very good late year June      The place didn't look anything Munich beer garden looked kind stupid being indoors   understand why hard outdoor beer garden Vegas but just looked ridiculous   No offense people did actual work just bad idea start   Our waitress very nice timely servers seemed busy bus boys also working hard   I would back beer expensive even beer if area but wouldn't pay cab ride there   Avoid food know going pay considerably more want to  <EOR> Great atmosphere! Super fun if you're looking little entertainment   food however just okay  ordered radishes weren't good unless drowned them salt which no no me    My entree steak fries which bordered awful but when you're full beer edible   fries just frozen potatoes but guess should expected German restaurant     My beer pretty good  selected original    Overall still really cool would probably return if just beer entertainment  <EOR> This place nothing expected  dark depressing atmosphere just lame general  beers expensive warm honestly worst beer ever had  would recommend anyone place    We party five everyone left disappointed  food okay but nothing write home about  <EOR> Truly unique experience  twice college friends more satisfied both times  beer fantastic schnitzels amazing sausages delicious but more anything entertainment  Definitely would recommend shot schnapps anyone <EOR> I disappointed  absolutely love German food awful  started huge pretzel which tasty served something suppose cheese  ZERO flavor  first time cheese tasted nothing  then ordered sausage plate  Kraut cooked long am assuming left day before no flavor well  service good either  hoping since moved Vegas would become favorite spots but case  2 meals appetizer kids meal spent 80 00  didn't even Beer! <EOR> Love fun festive atmosphere here!  I've tried good amount food couple occasions think just German cuisine don't palate for   Don't wrong food good enjoyable but nothing really stands me   Come drinks atmosphere!  I'd recommend trying Fresh Baked Pretzel start  Love it! All dipping sauces great too   and thing huge!  Very sharable     I've tried most Sausages Potatoes Spatzl Sauerkraut  favorites definitely sausages potatoes!  all unique tastes   but no extraordinary items touch base   And definitely try Hofbrauhaus Hefeweizen  outstanding!   To finish tried Hofbrauhaus Sweet Platter Kirschtort Tiramisu Cheesecake  all pretty good came melted creme cheese sauce dipping pouring Have fun! <EOR> Uhhh    My friends dragged lunch they both original restaurant Germany wanted revisit experience expense   Being city such amazing food options came am thrilled when reflect upon it    I don't drink enticed massive beers give  lemonade horrible  could taste syrup felt if drinking lemon flavored cough syrup  food heavy good any means  ordered chicken sandwich but tried more traditional meals friends ordered  happy either    The only upside man band occasional spankings when people would buy shots  buddy spanked really HARD some way believe universal paying back bringing here    Germans might some cool looking cars but impressed food  Maybe something better Deutschland but yet try it  <EOR> This super fun place take group family fun  only 2 but still great time!

Hofbrauhaus definitely delivers  menu classic German foods course beer! live music decor set tone year round Oktoberfest experience   Family style seating benches but still giving enough space aren't elbow elbow anyone  Service food both good  If you're feeling little wild receive public spanking fraulines  warned hit hard! sounded whip cracking every time  faint heart or sensitive cheek     It's pricey side really noisy but overall Bubs good time  Don't forget check Yelp claim free beer  Cheers! <EOR> I disappointed  place    think more tourist trap authentic German restaurant   had potato pancake salmon  13 99 4 jaegerschnitzel 19 99 $ pretzel 2 99 mustard 0 39 $ it didn't taste German food all very overpriced   <EOR> Honestly would never sought place out  just don't consider German food  Don't wrong don't just no opinion don't consider all when think I'd eat  walked very large building many times convinced myself should stop in   Impressive  Huge ceilings lots space exactly would picture drinking hall look like  gift shop seemed kind cheesy but put mind sat down   First off place really intended groups  Large tables bench seating simply screams party  party going performer  Overall experience pretty intimidating  Sat down ordered some beer spent maybe 20 minutes looking over incredibly large menu   So far 3 5 experience but food really good  Nice fresh pretzels homemade mustard  Good currywurst even better jagerschnitzel  beer well seems high scores but didn't find them particularly interesting  don't claim golden tongue but different strokes different folks  end even enjoying performer silliness   Must visit? Maybe but worth going to  trying find local German places see compares mission accomplished now consider style food  <EOR> I really enjoyed evening Hofbrauhaus   all food items order chicken definitely didn't disappoint!  Also ordering huge beer mugs deserves pass bicep curl day  <EOR> My husband travel Germany quite bit holidays quite picky when comes German food  love sauerkraut even close good one! don't know why place such high reviews  just drink entertainment worth 4 stars but food bland  why came eat German food 1 star food  <EOR> I first say year ago original Hofbrauhaus Munich Germany when heard Vegas come!

If close 10 15pm Pease let people know waste cab fare getting your establishment    Never coming back   btw lived Germany two years   this never would tolerated Deutschland  <EOR> This review based solely really good Vegan Frankfurters here  First off surprise see even Vegetarian section also Frankfurters! good come tangy curry side fries you sub salad if want     Spidey came try another German restaurant always comes thought why not?  The inside made look German hall complete long tables forced sit close strangers  very nice place very open bright but see when busy would very crowded  weekday afternoon weren't many people there    So radish dish start which work art  give mound spiral radish ones shaped flowers amongst slices buttered bread chives  Really good   Spidey some meat smothered gravy dumpling she really liked  dessert apple strudel black forest cake all very good   The food good but service lacked lot here  stated before many people less 20 but well over 2 hours waiting mostly things  dessert worst part because waitress came over asked if gotten yet  No  not  she which took very long time    I would back just vegan furters again but other wouldn't  <EOR> All Gabby if want shots   Ashley great server!

You would complete dummkopf lot fun here    This sort establishment atmosphere general wildness really only found during Oktoberfest most places  nightly Vegas Hofbrauhaus    something special    Then Das Boot!

Because really if even know little bit German you'd realize everything needs said very stern loud voice you're speaking language correctly  Though don't need speak anything but drunk here   Das Boot help    If you've seen film Beerfest place Das Boot glass chug down your booze in  Just remember twist end you'll full load beer coming you  little pricey if you're going glass but if just want Das Boot plastic one    As food   DELICIOUS! mention very large when comes portion sizes  Now much sauerkraut fan but ate whole damn plate when front me  Though perhaps also soak some copious amounts alcohol drank while listening band play    I'm sure house band cycles through songs every two hours  just really really German time felt knew songs heart  Those two semesters PCC couldn't taught much could they?  Now only two beers two beers only  But lack selection  made massive amount booze  really when trying polish off huge plate frankfurters kraut wouldn't want good pilsener? Just don't forget your Lederhosen  For those seeking even bigger kink order shots! fraulein comes them paddle couple friends swing them down  Then said Frau bends over gives whack wooden paddle Mit Vergnügen!!!! wouldn't want spanked same paddle your shots brought on?
