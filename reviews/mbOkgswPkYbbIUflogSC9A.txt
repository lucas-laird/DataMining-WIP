Friendly staff too! <EOR> This place might worst sushi ever tasted   rolls lacked flavor heavy handed rice  ingredients very low quality hard distinguish amongst all rice   accompanying sauces terrible well noticeably store bought made house  truly amazed place still business because just fowl  AYCE probably keeping them afloat but even isn't great deal because all eat shit! Albertsons seriously better sushi grandma doesn't know never sushi could better rolls  Understand point? rolls going McDonald's ordering 1 4lb cheese receiving 1 16lb cheese extra bun  thought Kaizen half assed but look Bar Masa compared Nagoya  review isn't entirely negative thought should mention Asahi beer quite tasty  only thing menu lived expectations  way give zero stars? <EOR> There's really only reason come all you can eat sushi  Even if just want roll some seaweed salad something AYCE price cheaper paying la carte  strip mall standard Vegas  small ish sushi bar seating then few tables around room   The menu lengthy  lot rolls choose which appreciated  order half sizes rolls try more types   Everything alright  Nothing bad  Nothing great  average mediocre  greatest quality but bad quality either  very middle road establishment  <EOR> 1 Star location price 1 because Kamikaze roll ok     There no door sneak back ask if could seat myself although didn't look inviting  called ask wifi available answer yes but unfortunately didn't exist  Salmon sashimi extremely thick cut  Miso soup came bowl very cold soup bowl  refrigerated something  Soup lasted 30 secs  <EOR> Honestly if love GOOD sushi don't All Eat here   first thought novel restaurant would everything order and is however getting whole rolls limits because really only eat much  rolls really just average best  no stand outs    But just example disappointment ordered roll sounded good soft shell crab think called Red Bull  eating sushi over 20 years softshell crabs over 35 years  know when see it  simply nothing more minced crab stick roll   When asked lady assured soft crab but chef chops roll  Huh? good all  4 rolls ordered only really any good  mention rules eat all order no wasting rice surcharged  sushi pieces way much rice which obviously goal fill rice    Honestly    don't it  If know good sushi soarly disappointed    In all honesty can't speak rest options AYCE menu why fill noodles when order sushi  <EOR> I Nagoya last night friend because friends highly recommend food here  however nice 25 % off during opening period but think food wasn't good still cannot believe charge $ 2 hot tea  wtf?? service okay  Shirmp tempura only two shirmps two pieces vegetables  guess sweet potato onion? restaurant owned Korean guess  I would rather BBQ here  <EOR> My intentions all eat but eating couple nigiris which disappointing because size rice big fist!  ended paying ala carte paid bill said sayonara! <EOR> When lived SW restaurant within walking distance me  loved eating there! Food always excellent good service moderate prices  worried might close soon because beautiful place practically always empty often only customer there  Well moved area while still open  Sorry hear closed now     Probably location very good business kind hidden view Rainbow  <EOR> My friends love place   food always good service isn't bad either   Some favorites include spicy garlic edamame I copied recipe home now good! sex beach grand canyon roll red red roll damn spicy but damn good boom boom roll lunch special teri beef chicken katsu fried bananas     Really good stuff   Fresh flavorful! <EOR> Never coming back! review   Ok say  sushi roll tasteless  say service excellent! But coming back    no vuelvo regresar este lugar ESA Es mi critica    MMM el sushi no tenia nada de sabor  Lo si  tengo q decir Es que el servicio fue bueno <EOR> yum! but assholes   every time come  the females just nasty!!  the sushi chefs   absolute dolls   they serve spicy garlic edemame worth trip   and attitude   the fish yummy  pretty fresh  keep mind vegas  there no oceans close by   order take avoid nasty female haters!! <EOR> By far best Sushi Las Vegas OK everyone says favorite sushi restaurant but only way convince try yourself   going since day opened yet catch them without freshest fish saying something being desert!  ya there's other places where sauces special rolls cover less perfect fish your eating but here   opt sashimi nagori must try! <EOR> I placed order Nagoya Japanese Restaurant once before  When last time told menus but menu website  Today website check menu  Called place 2 Dynamite  website price $6 95  But when charged $9 95  When asked them price told changed  asked them if menu  said only online  Do just come MYSTERY price every time into pay? <EOR> Been few times now far its pretty good lunch place    AYCE sushi first time which normal priced normal types offierings   Nothing stands WOW!    The last 2 times bento box lunches w\ Teryiaki Chicken Salad etc    price quikcly food good value    The miso soup very flavorful enjoy much    I continue co workers lunch   <EOR> I ordered some take out other night  tuna nigiri hamachi nigiri excellent  Really good flavor silky soft texture good color  Tiger roll also very good  shrimp tempura spicy tuna cucumber avocado  Kamikaze roll other hand wasn't great  eel tough chewy tastes  Service fast friendly everything ready within 15 minutes  biggest knock place price  tip everything came $50  seems little excessive take out dinner but quality food very good overall  <EOR> With all gazillion Japanese restaurants choose Vegas isn't cream crop   bento box shrimp tempura 2 pieces?! rubbery beef teriyaki   think only semi redeeming thing Volcano Roll which mediocre best   don't think come back anytime near future  <EOR> When sushi your favorite food world would expect trying find new favorite sushi bar because old broke your heart would exciting right? First all supposed hard find bad sushi  all if fish fresh only factor left should rice least perception until recently    As turns bad sushi little freshness fish  Bad sushi product bad management   Nagoya good example bad sushi simply due fact management decided several factors good sushi bar expensive offer  understand offering AYCE financial concern expect some types sushi going offered per visit  dinner price only basis many places around town do  But cannot forgive stocking those items all   During visit Nagoya several favorite sushi offerings simply available some even stocked regular basis  even though willing pay extra sea urchin none had    And add insult injury salmon roe fresh it actually very nasty carry quail eggs what?  chef said carry quail eggs which essential compliment salmon roe sea urchin because enough call it  Well 168 market know dozen quail eggs extremely cheap say  crappy excuse but expect crappy sushi bar   Just note sushi chef actually great  just bad he little work with  <EOR> Another good experience Nagoya   date night hubby     It bit disconcerting only table there      Nonetheless everything delicious   No complaints   still huge fan some AYCE offerings garlic edamame mushroom miso   nice few box options   Other apps such baked green mussels gyozas great well   Sushi rolls fresh flavorful rolled right     We pleased all choices   only bummer uni hubs   Boo!  They offer buy free hot sake only $3 50   Yay!  excellent service but said only table there     Top notch AYCE sushi book!  price did believe $24 95 time around  <EOR> This place no good now HUGE portions rice nigiri 3 group came down food poisoning eating here   The yakisoba other appetizers weren't good even if ignore issues nigiri getting sick   Would recommend ever  <EOR> I would prefer naked fish over nagoya   ordered hamachi look all burnt hard rock when eating it    Im much complaint but being sushi restaurant   Should more focused quality your dish care would attract more customers??  give 1 5 stars    Maybe improve? <EOR> Stay Away Food poisoning! group coworkers came eat 7 00pm Friday night  should've heeded warning sign virtually empty  Regardless decided give try  begin waiter came table ordered some drinks spilled hot tea leg  Then gave way much rice nigiri attempt fill faster all eat AYCE   Finally strict time limit which waiter came reminded us  top all off all food poisoning literally violent vomiting exploded bums   Stay away! You've warned  <EOR> I haven't back Nagoya VERY LONG while tonight's food very disappointing  nigri overstuffed rice crap rice that  rice mushy funny flavor when tried chew felt gagging  fish just fresh all bland weird taste  finally ended just ordering shrimp tempura udon  udon itself good but shrimp much breading wasn't fully cooked just felt sick eating all above we only ordered 4 different nigris   just sushi week ago some other place which dang delicious sushi taste buds off tonight  sorry Nagoya but husband said Grocery store sushi better ate today Nagoya  <EOR> This regular hang Sushi  Gfs used little GNO girls night out Sake Bombs work  staff awesome always making feel home next time return they'll remember least pretend to! moment walk through door owners always approach say hi even give all hug! sweet!  Food good! first place first Screaming Orgasm sushi literally  Shredded radish Tuna sitting top some kinda spicy sauce  favorite then moved onto spicy scallop roll yep heart it  having Spicy Scallop location now judge other places version lol  Another all time favorites Garlic Tuna which difficult mess theirs YUMMY  If order lot put them large sail boats real nice presentation!  If sushi raw cooked your thing full menu other non sushi items Chicken Teriyaki Udon Soup etc  Another option Teppanyaki  pretty good! MUCH MUCH better Bennihana isn't expensive!   Restaurant very cute  sit sushi bar tables if you're having Teppanyaki where also order sushi separate room   Ever since opened Nagoya2 usually over because favorite Sushi Chef moved location  Overall great experience every visit Nagoya location  <EOR> Love AYCE sushi! love anything cream cheese popcorn lobster very good too! there's great variety chef specials! <EOR> Even though closest AYCE sushi restaurant office really need stop coming here  Once every 6 months mistakenly forget bad rolls decide eat lunch Nagoya  did again today  Hopefully review remind next time  Never again   I begin shrimp tempura calamari tempura appetizers  much breading  Almost more breading seafood  next order salmon eel nigiri  bad  Next baked roll volcano roll deep fried roll can't remember   Both terrible  conclude tuna spicy tuna nigiri  Again bad  decent nigiri saves Nagoya dreaded star rating   Final verdict 2 stars <EOR> I eaten once fantastic! ordered couple kinds rolls some fish some without both excellent put some kind sweet sauce crab rolls exceptional! also some vegetarian tempura really really good  Beyond service excellent waitress even noticed inability use chopsticks she doctored them rubber band them fool proof worked! absolutely now when need sushi fix! <EOR> This place very close house often  staff super friendly sushi pretty dang good  When first started going didn't AYCE  But last couple years started doing that  never disappointed always very full happy  end    Order RED n RED if garlic ponzu The Baked Green Mussels  Volcano Roll  Those favorites! <EOR> Whenever eat Nagoya 3 items am sure order first Screaming Orgasm Seriously delish Tiger Roll which good almost everywhere Red Red roll which similar Tiger Roll except regular tuna top but spicy ponzu rather sweet eel sauce top 3  fix start explore menu other yummy things    Now although everything ordered Nagoya good few rolls am fan of most part know taste buds enjoy try stick range that  instance ordered Nato roll once  huge mistake really think Nagoya's fault should known would fermented beans  mistake  burrito roll not sure if  real name but found don't deep fried rolls much rice   Now anywhere visit sushi don't order things that    Over years noticed sushi becoming more popular more sushi places opening around town stepping game Nagoya less busy when first started going there   Sometimes would dinner only table place however always satisfying  price reasonable well   just recently am sure if because new sushi chef but little disappointed quality sushi especially screaming o just didn't me noticed difference past couple times ate here  <EOR> So want update review  3rd time here   1st time well over year ago AYCE then few weeks ago lunch take special which horrible But figured maybe mis judged them should try AYCE again    So     walked 8 other people not busy   Hell surprised even see many actually   2 chef's behind counter waiting patiently finally place order  typically stuff rolls FULL much rice first order small just case   surprise normal amount  beginning think may changed ways   sushi chefs bit slow caught pretty quickly going problem because saw party 4 walk then few other small parties few people also sat down sushi bar   most places great always glad see people coming but sushi chefs already slow now going do   Well took forever next few orders started see why  very detailed some orders don't mind but ONLY if quickly   Other orders skimpy   enjoyed sex beach roll but topped slices salmon   salmon slice didn't even cover top each piece sushi also incredibly thin part roll wasn't even cut into pieces    All all quality fairly good enjoyed handrolls very much but somehow knew gonna happen often happens mediocre places this   order uni sweet shrimp oh sorry we're PISSED!!!! and Wednesday TOO  I happen know Tuesday Wednesday best days sushi because fish markets asia NO reason it once again most likely didn't want serve part all eat   What's sad place GREAT potential easily see menu variety rolls even sushi chefs  point wanted stand shout easily making bad place doesn't be   All work faster MAYBE put 3rd sushi chef don't skimpy fish  understand cost over doing but don't skimpy  PLENTY other great AYCE sushi places don't skimp all   This place very very borderline  coming back return visit   typically eat 45 min approx 1 hr 20 min   just long just goin myself     Work your speed Nagoya  Guests comin door give chance you're blowing yet great potential  <EOR> No need long review place  Freshness fish used sushi questionable  fellow diner found cockroach food causing quick exodus clients  Never going back again   If only zero stars option  <EOR> I staying Vegas few months now business tried couple sushi restaurants but found best ones! rolls awesome service great! kind bad smell but think its because crank heater toooo much lol anyway recommend rainbow roll its good ! <EOR> Okay sushi   first choice   AYCE dinner  Ehhhh  fish wasn't fresh staff nice but inattentive  Looks teppanyaki area but didn't see anyone don't even know if still offer it  good food   Just okay  Gave them 2 stars quick seated nice sushi chefs were  <EOR> This strange little place   advertise teppanyaki but teppanyaki room never open   AYCE sushi   sushi very good fresh yet see crowd    also everything else menu   staff very friendly   only complaint lack variety sushi specials   Although three columns special rolls all very similar except few strange sauces   tried nearly everything only 1 3 1 2 items received repeat performances  usual rules sharing leftovers but don't appear strict here  AYCE because share try more items less money  half rolls request   try once month since 7 year old loves some sushi   search perfect sushi place continues but until find Nagoya keep fat happy  <EOR> Love place lunch specials green tea tempura ice cream  Good service too  Close work co workers frequent place least twice week  Try tempura green tea ice cream won't regret it! <EOR> Just done dinner box which consisted chicken teriyaki yakitori shrimp tempura  whole thing bland 15 bucks down drain  <EOR> Once again another bootleg Japanese restaurant    Being new spring valley area decided try some new local digs Boy disappointed stop      I am 0 2 Japanese joints Ft  Apache Geisha House now here      On surface looked good spot nice ambiance decor location however  where compliments stop   I ordered chicken katsu teriyaki dinner box  only few people joint maybe 3 4 figured food would come pretty quick  took them 20plus minutes them bring food out  Worst part wait  cold!  AND THEN!!! The katsu thin looked breaded luncheon meat  teri beef tasted sitting old meat rolled kikkoman teri glaze    The only thing worth eating few pieces California roll came box   only reason why didn't give 1* rating  Based off would think AYCE sushi might tolerable  BUT since Korean sushi joint would scrutinize cleaning your plate try charge any leftovers     The only thing came fast check didnt even come fast enough   With many choices Ft  Apache would suggest somewhere else    <EOR>
