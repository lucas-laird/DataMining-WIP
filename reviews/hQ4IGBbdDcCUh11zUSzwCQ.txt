Super soft moist full seasoning  Such big flavor def worth money <EOR> I've eaten lot bbq separate good worst Big Erns definitely bottom list   Before cons tell pros visit   I just enjoyed Brisket    Cons    First foremost let's review ribs    moist very chewy  only 4 pcs gave 3rd one  BBQ joint should always good ribs  Second pulled pork  pork dry chewy also even L L hawaiian bbq does better job even late hours!  sauce evenly spread out   A BBQ joint should good sauce yes sauce good considering only flavor  comparable ones buy albertsons   Next pork beans   i don't know why people next saying good when clearly taste ones use buy walmart  No special taste there  honest use buy dog food   Also did Potato salad    that horrible even kid pointed bad  also try cup water telling refreshing  He's reaction?? x[ that  lol last dinner roll  Smh     For price I'd recommend going Famous Daves  variety sauces quality always consistent   don't know if Big Erns late but 5 pm still lots people shouldn't excuse serve that   Also people should always believe over hyped places  Don't believe till try cause most often mind f***s u u start believe good  Believe your taste buds <EOR> Not great definitely nothing special  Husband's brisket mostly fat mac cheese looked tasted noodles w butter them  pulled pork sandwich barely any meat little did also lot fat it  Several people ordered food first probably would continued asked where food was  Overpriced blah  Don't waste your time  <EOR> Small place short walk Fremont Street but pretty good BBQ here  Look giant praying mantis head into Container Park  some tasty brisket pulled pork w ice cold beer when town recently  Maybe bit pricey but good stuff! <EOR> The ribs freaking good! good crave it  Meat fell off bone ugh good! <EOR> I love place! food flavor able without being salty  sides homemade which them tasty store bought heated  meats smoked daily  It's interesting many people understand difference between wet dry bbq  Barbecue preference largely dictated whether saucy seasoned meat  Dry barbecue smoked while wet variety usually cooked fire pit   As say secret sauce  rub  Big Ern uses both which also homemade  Rubs typically worked into meat night before cooked salt penetrate cut tenderize it  But rubs more flavor soften meat also enhance its texture caramelizing forming crispy crust when cooked  Because rub's ability penetrate meat fatty cuts brisket respond well type seasoning  Memphis BBQ typically dry barbecue sauce side Kansas City North Carolina people barbecue wet even more sauce side    The service great lucky sit inside all visits because temperatures but am sure heaters would turned if needed   The price some may steep however any fast food restaurant size meal see you'll pay heart attack box  I only negative remark Lonely D reviewed 12 23 understand holidays may lonely some but unemployed 3 meat combo really necessary if couldn't really afford it?  Ok another remark Lonely D  Sorry  French fries really? just googled Southern BBQ side dishes most common sides available Big Ern's  Only 10 sites even listed oven fried fries side dish  guess next time want take suicidal trip try McDonald's hear form rib sandwich now meant human consumption    Big Ern's BBQ small meaning store location but HUGE success!! <EOR> Food excellent layout really cool old shipping container  lot indoor space but good outside space  Ribs amazing! <EOR> Meh  brisket sandwich dry stale bun very little flavor  Sauce available put yourself but why just ask customer them? wasn't horrible just nothing special  plenty other bbq joints spectacular Las Vegas just none downtown know of  <EOR> Fantastic food fantastic price! Anyone Fremont needs check Container Park stop try bbq  <EOR> In land glitzy casinos big menu prices Big Erns down earth place excellent food owner wants see happy customers  BBQ expert but know good food when taste it  Big Erns lacks over top atmosphere more flavor  brisket two ribs baked potato along BBQ baked beans  food looked great tasted even better  sauce perfect   I could certainly taste vinegar but wasn't overly sweet  BBQ baked beans    good should illegal  Big Ern store very friendly all customers  If you're Vegas Big Erns right now! <EOR> I last 2 times Vegas back last time because BBQ good first time j visited but time something happened 5 months first visit  roll comes combo dry edible  husband literally spit out  ribs tough nothing falling off bone more hold meat your teeth pull hard just off  only good thing hot links because brisket chewy too   In other words if want good BBQ don't come here  <EOR> Not impressed  brisket over salted Mac cheese wasn't anything stands crowd  sure good days maybe just came day where off  <EOR> Buyer beware  employees rude disrespectful may steal your money accidentally giving wrong change refusing correct it   Besides food quality okay sometimes only two menu items  Why?  The whole place seems did functional  <EOR> Stay away Brisket sandwich unless chopped fat   Sandwich 80% fat  Yuck! <EOR> All say disgusting  Spent evening trying different food joints wine bar  First off other food joints decent product  wine bar some pretty nice wines  So reason am writing review Big Erns disgusting  First off during travels through park saw cooks getting drunk wine bar then taco shop  When saw big erns never saw wash hands   just disgusting  say least didn't order any food just beware when eat there  <EOR> Just Brisket side Mac n Cheese roll  $10 didn't feel ripped off but didn't feel great deal either   The Brisket Ok but kind disappointed  Nothing worth going way opinion but again Brisket world class TX BBQ joints where Brisket done right crack BBQ  When visiting relatives TX pretty much ordering every other day    LOL  The brisket served medium well done no smoke ring little no rub very lean dry  tender but just didn't much flavor it  Highly doubt being smoked over Hickory  sure if quality brisket using if taking short cuts  Probably combination both could tell  Wholesale good quality brisket going only $3 lb if going turn around sell $17 lb don't take short cuts preparing it  Luckily spicy BBQ sauce awesome gave some flavor  Spicy BBQ sauce made 3 stars instead 2  normally use little no BBQ sauce Brisket done right but going through container pretty much mandatory Brisket   Mac n Cheese  Pretty good  better much worse   Roll? Stale Old completely unacceptable served  rolls bought couple weeks ago sitting pantry saving ducks better shape   Unfortunately Vegas finding some good Brisket done right certainly challenge  <EOR> I want say ever thought good idea change cole slaw recipe just made huge mistake  wonder if called head chef tried taste test its customers? new cole slaw very bland no taste  Big Ern need stand bring back original recipe  rushed back Fiesta just because cole slaw  crushed find wasn't same  won't coming back  <EOR> What great service  Chef Rio awesome! rib tips succulent sides die Mac cheese tasted homemade green's good wanted more  now favorite place downtown eat  walked several restaurants due bad service last night happy find best kept secret Las Vegas  Chef Rio made dining experience much fun he made everyone feel right home  Next time downtown Freemont Experience sure stop Big Ern's Barbecue Container shop plaza  <EOR> Food mediocre but staff friendly helpful   food bland tasted reheated   Rib tips pretty good <EOR> Possibly worst BBQ ever had  Don't waste your time  Food expensive bland dry  <EOR> I vegas november getting married ate  Food great Holly cashier  sweet kind!

Hoping they'll tweak them little bit   Service ======== Note first official day container park take part review grain salt wouldn't consider indicative typical visit  **Service no bearing star rating **  Ordering took while  could've spike customers first time cashiers using Square but took really long time individual place order somewhere around 2 minutes which significant considering fast process should place where take your order counter    Service line fast but forgot sides   Overall everyone working really nice think probably some kinks work but main things I'd look next time back more enjoyable memorable sides ribs your mouth water whenever hear someone mention Big Ern's  <EOR> Great tasting BBQ amazing Sauces!!

We stopped quick bite ribs pulled pork beans n slaw  all amazing! beans werent sweet  ribs cooked perfection!! nothing over salted   The staff more then friendly felt very home  owner Ern immediately greeted smile  impressed all around!   a must go! <EOR> I area visiting decided try spot   love did area   Very creative   want something different bbq fit bill   place decorated nicely stopped in   greeted nice guy ambiance family like   ordered bbq brisket w fried okra    a celebration home   I also checked Yelp free side which asked collard greens w turkey meat    omg   reminded mom's   root beer tasty refreshing hot day   cook chef did fabulous job   must stop by   Delish food great service   definitely stop next time LV  <EOR> The reviews Big Ern's seem run literally hot cold  noted handy dandy Yelp app but also saw reviews previous pop location nearby much better decided give them try  glad did some pretty darn good BBQ   I three meat combo picked brisket pulled pork hot links which served 2 sides  Mac n Cheese baked beans sides  saw lot complaints price but $14 99 price tag platter par BBQ places am familiar DC area portion size ample  See photo Here's would breakdown meal Outstanding brisket hot links  beef brisket among best ever had  very juicy right level smoke flavor  smoky bland  hot links equally yummy     nice hint heat but overpowering great texture flavor link   Good sauce roll beans  only kind sauce sauce sweeter side but overly sweet KC style sauce  nice balance sweet tangy  roll very nice  Both much needed pulled pork  baked beans good     may canned beans noted another review but cooked nicely nice blend green pepper onion it  Nothing special but tasty   Meh pulled pork mac n cheese  pulled pork surprisingly bland  just wasn't much flavor all  positive note when placed bun house BBQ sauce down nicely  But good pulled pork should stand alone didn't  mac n cheese reminded mom used make   good thing because brother disliked much begged mom Kraft instead  homemade but basically taking block cheese melting macaroni     oil cheese separates bit mess   And don't worry your beer too  None local craft brews other places Container Park offer but stick hipster theme location offering Fat Tire PBR  Yes PBR become hipster common brew hadn't PBR while enjoyed BBQ    With more hits misses give Big Ern's solid 4 stars     I'd definitely come back again brisket hot links  <EOR> First all if you're Downtown Las Vegas area need head over Container Park just experience it  alone great reason visit Big Ern's   Just every other business park restaurant installed old shipping container which limits its size but increases its novelty   But probably want hear food  reasonably priced  Each meat plate $10 5oz meat 1 side bread  Pretty good  if want additional 5oz just pay extra $5  good deal if want try sides  Otherwise $17 pound brisket   The brisket itself extremely tender  little fat  increasing amount actual edible meat get  first curious why just gave fork no knife but soon realized knife wasn't needed  cut right through fish that if you're already eating your hands     In fact meat would top list if weren't lack distinct flavor  even if just little  But pre sauce meat basically none  hard giving more points   It's good thing sauce tasty enough  would've shame if wasn't  While best definitely did job making meat quality vain  sauce harder put finger on  cook back said California style but concluded more similar Texas  But little thicker normal higher amount sweetness  Almost Pepsi nuanced  Maybe could call peppery California sauce   The baked beans just okay but if add little or lot BBQ sauce turn into something pretty good  mac cheese favorite sides  made real cheese comforting homemade feel  weren't cheesy   I weird thing BBQ places don't cornbread but least give dinner roll each plate   I would definitely come back Big Ern's  If nothing else but excuse visit underappreciated Container Park  But reasonably priced  quality all  <EOR> Amazing BBQ! price excellent much food get  staff owner very nice helpful  environment around Big Ern's great adults kids  ate twice while town   The meat tender moist beans great flavor potato salad great yummy mac'n'cheese  <EOR> Smells great around Container Park eatery but food much different story  Since neither baked potato mashed potatoes included combos chose pork ribs combo platter coleslaw green salad while love chose brisket BBQ pork beans green salad  normally brisket lover brisket converted me which made much more sense trying eat pork ribs because tasted beef jerky stick  ribs undercooked grizzle perfectly intact only looked but chewed gum  realized reason brisket tasted delicious actually because hadn't cooked long normal even quite sure know accidental perfection  just wished accidentally left ribs barbie instead  best part place option pour own BBQ sauce side  Trying overlook ribs moved onto coleslaw  seasoned lightly served soupy consistency but half bad  think may forgot salt cabbage because water kept coming no matter many times drained it  couldn't say much green salad because more dead wilted slimey salad  tried hide limp black lettuce along rusted romain ends under fresh green pieces very shady if ask me  should taken counter girls bad customer service big hint run next place fast but smelled good gave them benefit doubt  would buy few sides BBQ baked beans Big Ern's because world loaded shredded meat could easily meal but never ever would order ribs green salad place again  many awesome eateries choices Las Vegas say try another one  place small any given day 2 5 inside tables taken management  <EOR> I ordered meat combo chose spare ribs Mac cheese  ribs fall off bone sauce pretty damn tastey!

Really ? sauce homemade but could tell let boil making horrible vinegary taste  bummed  But guess bbq good enough yuppies  <EOR> Great BBQ   Loaded potatoes w pulled pork Mac Cheese wonderful  Good sized Garden Salad $5   Looked fresh too  <EOR> After walking place well over year today day decided indulge   mid afternoon stroll through container park none other places salivating Big Ern's BBQ   quiet day Container Park rare desert  rain just stopped falling    looking over menu asking few questions looked pulled pork sandwich side pork beans winning choice     The food came quickly very decent portion meat bun   roll very soft fresh pork very juicy tender   Big chunks pork smothered sauce just right amount fat bark vegetarians mouth water   prefer BBQ sauce little more heat because made cater all tastes BBQ lovers   did even ask if other sauces available because hungry   pork beans very good come scolding hot pork sandwich which luke warm  beans big chunks meat little bit spice   would back sure working way around menu     The down fall experience service   understand lazy rainy day CP   All more reason operators time give WOW! service everyone looking for   When arrived both team members dining room phone other doing knows what   While trying conversation business response most given don't know am owner    little turned off this   Then ask rain several times no listening then answers directed tourist   Yeah turned off also     I decided sit outside enjoy meal solitude while watching rain fall   Very relaxing boy needed weekend had   am giving 4 stars food 3 stars mediocre service   back try Ribs Brisket  <EOR> Pulled pork decent briskets alright    lacked flavor spare ribs tasted lighter fluid needed lot bbq sauce    I also disliked only two bottles bbq everyone share  different tables because people would hogging it  Wouldn't hurt guys invest more sauce bottles least sauce dispenser customers don't end hogging sauce  <EOR> Located Downtown inside Container Park    I've twice now both times fairly pleasant  first time visited Big Ern's Valentine's Day  group friends hit downtown scene day Big Ern's pre game stop dinner night  around 7 8pm pretty busy  group 6 sat outside along playground  ordered combo platter Brisket mac n cheese potato salad PBR  prices very reasonable  service fast staff members humble  brisket tender sides tasty too  If you're going downtown restaurants would suggest eat at  <EOR> Not great  Just okay  hoping better but sure limited location  <EOR> Delicious!

Today 1st visit container park  husband 3 boys visited early afternoon  chose eat Big Ern's BBQ  If weren't HORRIBLE attitude some staff wouldn't even commenting  husband saw employee behind food line DOUBLE DIP EATING SPOON PUBLIC MAC CHEESE  husband said something removed macaroni question   employee taking order even suggested trash checked  another spoon  sounded reasonable  could've chance she double dipping into public food   No second spoon produced!  didn't expect eat free anything sort  just wanted feel patronage important issue would dealt swiftly properly  treatment followed affected rating them  few employees stood behind food line stealing glances family shaking heads    My husband doesnt confrontation say something incident really bad  Big Ern BBQ employee hadn't present incident asked if everything ok  husband walked over told exactly happened he watched employee dip plastic spoon into macaroni cheese being served public ate off spoon instead throwing spoon away getting another plastic spoon she dug SAME spoon just MOUTH into macaroni cheese took another bite  lady running cash register walked over husband started yelling situation over  took food off line that  employee did double dipping said husband lying    Never felt disrespected unappreciated! really shame   macaroni cheese delicious  rivaled mom's homemade macaroni  bad all overshadowed  blatant disregard proper customer service disgusting food service standards  <EOR> Just cuz love bbq pork much  would definitely recommend place eat late night friends  would love try some other items menu <EOR> Where even start __ I mean wanna laugh just thinking writing review   The BF weren't hungry but decided just try since already Container Park    Once entered place girl counter told all meats except sausage links   which funny because  meat didn't wanna try lol  Regardless sausage links sandwich baked beans for mac cheese for   girl nice enough give extra side free!  We sandwich first once opened plate lunch cut sausage links bread   Literally!  No sandwich sight  I looked BF then menu like thought sandwich?????! Let known sausage links tasty   Then side baked beans mac cheese cups  CUPS! kinda cups prolly use complimentary waters   The baked beans hot cup started melt bottom completely disfigured  couldn't stop laughing it! Baked beans weren't anything rave about   nothing sweet caramelized  Tasted honest   The mac cheese penne pasta soupy sauce   Overall disappointing experience  Only saving grace only reason didn't give 1 star great service personalities those behind counter   ****** place just opened sure ALOT glitches figure out  Most def lot potential     Local small businesses Container Park all all  <EOR> Excellent BBQ Nevada     Meats very good sides fantastic recommend potato salad fried okra beans  Good prices good food! <EOR> I concept  small menu southern BBQ quite possibly favorite food genre  However wasn't all great  ribs seemed start well but through became more more covered fat  know may appeal some but me   I coleslaw which wasn't bad but wasn't great either  fried okra though even though didn't sounded good reports others   You order number meats want then add your sides  Simple effective process   Very tiny place keep mind if you're looking dine in  <EOR> Great chicken ribs brisket beer always worth trip back great location also <EOR> Meh     We wings fries rib tips slaw beer lemonade $29 +tip    Tips ok   overcooked but moist   Bland   Nothing exciting   Wings old over seasoned   Tasted very much reheated BBQ   Slaw tasted bland   Maybe mass produced?  Fries bland blasts house seasoning    which isn't great   Overall made better BBQ   house seasoning really weak blend spices   so everything tastes same needs LOT sauce  <EOR> Bring your appetite!  good size portions good selection   Nothing fancy but  need BBQ joint   pulled pork beans great! <EOR> I loaded baked potato horrible! potato completely cooked hard  pulled pork top baked potato dry hard no flavor even horrible tasting bar b que sauce it  If baked potato bad only imagine rest food tastes like  never eat again once enough me! <EOR> OMG! BATMAN! place rocks! ribs outrageously amazing! don't care sides but crazy thing eats BBQ side dishes? meat people! Place tiny hello container   super clean staff friendly knowledgeable  great place bring friends hang people watch  beer yummy well  waiting for? <EOR> Would definitely recommend  Great food fast service  Love BBQ place  hit link sandwich fries both warm when arrived  bad price either  <EOR> Average BBQ smelled great walking but taste minimal smokiness  Brisket cut grain both plates fatty  Ribs chicken good  Tried all sides    Coleslaw best  Beans bland Mac cheese needed BBQ sauce flavor  Hot link good bun served meal pointless filler     park great feel transcended even being Vegas    Pork beans business next time over there  <EOR> Run mill BBQ joint Container Park  Staff friendly yet attention detail lacking  Prices high side  <EOR> It seems though most popular spot eat Container Park  usually line least 3 4 people long enough door  ordered brisket slaw beans  menu very minimal but  fine because more less right? sides okay but unfortunately good enough order same sides again next time come  brisket good but little dry needed more flavor  definitely added more sauce it  think food deserves 3 stars but ambiance service constitutes overall 4 star rating  Although inside seating area rather small still country vibe place   price also pretty reasonable eating meal Container Park seems thing when you're there  definitely give them another shot since other meat options menu sound look good  <EOR> Fantabulous beef brisket!!  Tender flavorful sauce perfect blend seasonings half pound $8!  Staff little short product knowledge but tried best    Honestly  all tried since girlfriend craving wanted try lobster grilled cheese next door   definitely return more  <EOR> Big Ern greeted person gave tour menu  ordered 3 kids meals 2 meat plate  Kids finished food which hard kids because super picky  chicken links side BBQ beans green salad  Meat tasty BBQ beans super good  ate inside when all finished Big Ern pulled bucket toys gave all kids toy  love supporting MA PA shops since own well  Keep great work Ern! <EOR> Just OK  Ribs weren't very good  Brisket tender pretty good maybe just little more fat reasonably expected  Potato salad wasn't very good but mac cheese decent   Friendly service reasonable prices  <EOR> Best BBQ restaurant long time  pulled pork some mac n cheese  classic but Big Ern's best  Customer service point Anthony D  being extremely friendly conversational  being family cookout coming back soon  <EOR> Very small place but cute quaint  surrounding area well container park  long wait food came fresh tasting hot  provide very friendly service  brisket sandwich amazing  nine party all though place pretty small able squeeze in  Everybody enjoyed food exception person but think she trying something she hadn't tried before might cup tea  Overall would love come back spot spend more time container park  <EOR> We strolled Fremont Street happily welcomed little oasis Container Park! all hungry came upon Big Erns BBQ  Small I mean come you're container! Quaint clean friendliest staff  bread brisket mac cheese pulled pork all four meals excellent  We'd definitely again if town  Prices also nice relief highway robbery Vegas pricing  <EOR> The bbq pretty good    Ribs great    Didn't care side dishes though    mac cheese bit tasteless slaw really different    More Italian dressing slaw    They could some more authentic recipes sides would better  <EOR> Granted came busy day but no need rude snappy attitude   container park race packet pick ordered brisket pork 6 rib bones beer wine   Hefty price but good eating   Really good rib bones might add!     But when ask missing rolls biggest attitude world sure plates can't anything it   wow okay   biggest loss wasn't going hold line stretched door   Good food but horrible under business pressure   I'd come again <EOR> An honest 3 1 2 stars   I really wanted Big Ern's BBQ more   good but only comes average when compared other BBQ   all biased when comes BBQ because all different tastes   Some love smoke some love spice some love sauce some love tomato based some love mustard based some love vinegar based   Hell some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just note people boiled meats BBQ   This meal when visited Downtown Container Park   looked interesting because when where place longest line   Figure food must best around right?  Well yes no   arguably best places eat within park   But BBQ favorite   But still good is   We two item combo platter pulled pork hot link   platter came roll two sides   Most popular items leaving kitchen day mac cheese baked beans   ended trying those   also picked extra hot link sandwich try   Verdict?  said before good but great   pulled pork bit dry side light flavor but good smoke   sides OK mac cheese yummy but needed bit more cheese   baked beans decent overly sweet think may bits pork it   The star show hot link   liked very much!  Spicy good flavor good texture   great chew when bit nice snap   Delicious hot link sandwich   BBQ sauce isn't bad tomato based appeals those sweeter sauce   Slather all over your hot link sandwich good eats   Reason why down 1 2 star darn pricing   Whoa everything Downtown Container Park pricey!  mean $12 two item combo platter expecting bit more food   good person bit difficult two share   sandwiches $7 each but don't come side   cost $2 more add on   Adding soft drink tack another $2   Don't Big Ern's BBQ expecting cheap meal!  But then again don't Downtown Container Park expect anything cheap  <EOR> Average BBQ spot located inside Downtown Container Park  twice   Brisket flavorful loaded salt sauces some other spots around town   The hot links little dried but chicken pulled pork pretty good   No complaints beans coleslaw but only potatular items available bagged chips    Be prepared spend little more money place cheap   Overall service excellent  <EOR> I've beef brisket couple times now tender delicious! Add Mac cheese side ordered dinner roll solid deal around $10  add different meats $5 more few options choose both meats sides    It's located right container park service pretty quick  Nice lunch spot outdoor seating few spots inside It's shipping container   Overall solid place few times now  <EOR> BBQ container!  Another cool restaurant located downtown Las Vegas Container Park  When walking into Park short stroll off right hand side main level   I've few times while visiting container park family friends  ribs Mac n cheese usual but told brisket isn't bad    The BBQ overall  bad isn't best town but bad location general access hearty meal  also offer few beers tap which nice touch wash down your BBQ  all container park restaurants use biodegradable silverware plates which nice touch   Usually found lot times coming painfully long line once your meal seating area quite limited actual container  Outside seating also offered but usually takin someone watching main jungle gym   Overall  Service 3 5 Cleanliness 4 5 Food 3 5 Back again Yup but because container park <EOR> Good pulled pork  bbq beans ok  wish more sides  prices fair   Small seating area inside  ate outside enjoyed nice weather  would again if we're area  <EOR> I dub Big Ern's first place grubbed Container Park  Pricing little steep but considering tastiness food accept it  place extremely small perhaps fitting around 10 less people seating area   seats patio but 40 degrees outside when went   The girl rang kept looking she annoyed ordering  glad wearing sunglasses because could've terrible stare down competition    Besides service being weird rude  or whatever would categorize as  I lovely BBQ chicken sandwich  chicken little dry side but looooved bbq sauce came it  am usually hater bbq sauces because usually over power taste buds  But sauce actually complimented chicken well     The only critique sandwich bun cold would TOTALLY awesome if warm toasted  But hey do?  My dude two meat combo sausage brisket  He said he liked it  snuck piece brisket indeed tasty but little dry    Overall experience underwhelming  won't come back because think sauce use fantastic  However don't see myself frequenter  <EOR> Let say first only try 1 2 lb brisket Big Ern's today but am looking foward next stop here  would ordered more but second BBQ stop hour expecting cross paths place    I ordered 1 2 lb brisket did ask  25 moist  25 lean  didn't but did best brisket Vegas  seemed only brisket moist cut  No lean found plate  well 1st plate came sauce  Yikes such no no  replaced there  1st taste really good  better else where but Vegas  say am sure trimming briskets correctly though  Even though taste smoke ring  lacking great bark lot fat should trimmed  knowlegde brisket am pretty sure trimmed down enough  smoker using rendering down fat enough  back look foward trying more things Big Ern's  Maybe even bump 4 rereview   Didn't want complete update  staying 3 lack bark much fat  Best brisket Vegas but hard do  ribs really good prob best Vegas well  side well just stay away them  mac dry lacks everything bbq beans well just wasn't fan    Just sure order without sauce cover it  <EOR> Well place lot potential but sadly doesn't come very close it  food looks delicious BBQ tasty but bun kind soggy Mac Cheese Baked Beans Potato salad looked great but really no taste pretty much just bland  little effort could lot better! pulled pork sandwich beef brisket shredded chicken great just BBQ sauce  some decent outdoor seating across kids play area   BTW great place kids!! but don't come 5k cause its crazy busy!! <EOR> This probably best bbq Las Vegas  staff very friendly  kid's side pork slider fries mac cheese  good lunch size meal  Mac cheese needed little salt but bbq point  <EOR> The briskets place absolutely perfect! first time Big Erm's BBQ boy id say die heaven  Briskets moist delicious hit BBQ sauce  big potato very good along side  definitely come back few more times  <EOR> Good good 2 meat  Brisket ribs sweet potato fries Mac n cheese  Everything really good  also beers tap bottle  hard roor beer really good bbq  <EOR> TERRIBLE FOOD changed quality poor great  New limited menu poor quality meats  fatty brisket burnt ribs   Was favorite bbq place before never back terrible quality pure fat   I 6 7 great meals until changed food completely  They business long   Good bye Erns BBQ  You killed yourself  shame You used amaze best smoked meats no fat   Now worst  SUCKED HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT <EOR> Showed 10pm when Open sign still personnel visible through windows supposed open until 11pm  Door locked personnel right next couldn't bothered even much acknowledgement hey sorry close early  <EOR> An update emailed business comments  Ernie owner emailed back directly apologized discrepancy disappointment said he would container park's website amended  He explained something did opening website hadn't revised since time but he taking care it  fact owner took time address concern awesome! kind customer service rare Vegas very much appreciated  <EOR> Meh  really wanted more since close work love BBQ general  also don't want drop 15 bucks lunch often opted brisket sandwich drink    which still came 12 13 dollars   For price? worth it  sandwich coleslaw mediocre  brisket just lumps meat little bit sauce nothing else sandwich  wasn't flavorful also wasn't much food  can't justify spending amount coin something doesn't taste amazing doesn't even fill up    I hoping 3 5 rating wrong better average suggested but experience not  <EOR> It okay  Food really good but price don't believe worth it   Boyfriend ordered pulled pork plate brisket  seemed portions would feed child adult especially almost $30  atmosphere nice considering Container Park super upset it  just won't habit going unless hungry extra money burn <EOR> Was excited try recommended Bar B Q  spot  But very disappointed ribs dried burnt very cheewy  When Container Park try different eatery  container also very warm provided no relief heat outside  <EOR> How does bbq place run food?

All years going Park Big Ern's always super packed dislike waiting food frequented other eateries park  past weekend Hubby bought tickets Wines Around World happening park past weekend  Heat alcohol tends provide faster buzz needed eat  early Big Ern's wasn't crowed yet decided try it  First music kind jams!

Super flavorful sweet salty pork   awesome!  meats chicken good   didn't smoky flavor hoping but seemed well BBQ sauce   brisket unfortunately dry   needed BBQ sauce it   hoping more marbleized flavor but didn't   roll served meal almost tasted cardboard  dry   wish took time least warm toast it     I'm definitely going back   support all downtown business certainly wish best Ernie business  hope next trip change mind overall ratings   now just ok   Good luck them future endeavors! <EOR> Went today first time friends  lady taking order EXTREMELY rude us! She should working front! all shocked way treated hard enjoy lunch  Pulled pork sandwich good but going back because horrible attitude lady had  <EOR> Some Vegas locals visiting wanted show around Fremont Street past Saturday night while town decided going Container Park very late dinner would best we'd choices all same thing   I love all things meat if read reviews know BBQ absolute favorite mine especially brisket   What more brisket?  Macaroni cheese!  So pretty darn excited over dinner  took little longer expected but maybe just felt waiting forever  friends able walk over hot dog place Container Park order dogs walk back over before we'd gotten ours hadn't other people line ordering before us  Luckily wasn't ravenous anything wait wasn't bad   At first glance because eyes often bigger stomach three slices brisket didn't look much but plenty didn't quite finish  If may needed carried car   The meat itself super tender melt your mouth  easily came apart no need even plastic knife  fat came off really easily which important someone really hates chewing fatty bits meat  meat itself unfortunately kind salty which really noticeable and friend well pulled pork ribs tried pulled pork DELISH    The BBQ sauce good if little bit strong both sweet tangy departments  hard find restaurant BBQ sauce really but hold hope  sauce reminded Phil's BBQ San Diego people gaga over stuff but sweet plus little hint sour bite means halfway through meal tongue starts little sore pounding sour candies   The macaroni cheese definitely favorite part  lot BBQ places serve rather dry mac cheese but mine drenched creamy oozy cheese sauce  wasn't super oozy but creamy cheesy rich comforting  little styrofoam cup's worth unassuming but plenty!  Overall perfectly fine late night meal Saturday walking around Fremont  If found myself back Container Park I'd probably eat again but pulled pork  maybe just ton macaroni cheese its own! <EOR> We stopped lunch  brisket fatty Mac cheese very bland  pork better but definitely better   Would back if pinch but much better bbq there  <EOR> Ate last night found hair cooked into bland pulled pork sandwich  When told staff said owner would talk before could refund  Also told Mac n' cheese proceeded serve people right behind us  sure why homeboy wouldn't just give Mac n' cheese    <EOR> Ive smelling W since began construction Container Park    Food truck   Well all time went    keep sort   Service awesome  Those two fellas should teach classes customer service   brisket beyond awesome   Hotlinks good   Sides maybe work progress    enjoy  <EOR> This first time absolutely return  pulled pork Mac N cheese delicious  Thank you! <EOR> Fabulous bbq  find  New Las Vegas terrific  <EOR> First time wrong impression  friends kids  I already ate home order kid pulled pork sandwich fries kids menu paid overheard waiter complaining order kids menu  coming back felt very rude  <EOR> I came once before didnt disappoint  Came cause friend visiting once again outstanding big portions  price only draw back size drinks but atleast theres refills     always tasty <EOR> Inside container park atmosphere seating Deck really nice order your food wait very short  food great barbeque sauce good meat dry  food smells great but tastes dry <EOR> I don't know why Big Ern's isn't feeling much love last night  ordered plate brisket pork cole slaw roll bag chips  PBR Fat Tire tap  more happy see Fat Tire  PBR must lost hipsters stumbled Fremont Experience  Someone please put barricade up   Now onto food! brisket fork tender because wasn't given knife but tender enough really didn't need knife  Saving environment tender brisket piece time   The pulled pork tender but star really brisket  nice smoke ring plenty smokiness  also liked didn't kill sauce let meat speak itself    The hubs finished off cole slaw  five year old stole chips  roll meh but happy quantity quality brisket    Immediately ordered noticed rib tips list next time  <EOR> Just tried Ern's second time again delicious!

animal did take from? even sure McDonald's would use rib meat McRib    I give places benefit doubt maybe some day give another shot   and probably couple shots  But hope pull together because good bbq spot Fremont would clutch  <EOR> This some best BBQ ever Brisket worth goin alone Prices reasonable space small but Food excellent! even if ya gotta wait take eat this!!! combo plate good just ordered meat ribs pound Service great Met owner really nice people amazing BBQ wait back <EOR> Was partner's I's first time Container Park found BBQ spot   very pleased food   Brisket BBQ ribs dinners BBQ sauce wonderful beans great tho mac cheese potato salad bit dry but tasty   definitely back tell people it  <EOR> Big Ern's great experience container park  ordered kid's size slider fries  perfect size me  fries crispy slider flavorful  customer service great too  If want add more sauce your slider condiment table  <EOR> I thought good BBQ price location  We shared three meat combo two sides two beers came 22 bucks    The ribs very good no complaints all  BBQ chicken wasn't bad either  pulled pork cause brisket   The coleslaw fantastic fresh  But mac n cheese sucked major ass  reminded box Kraft mac n cheese    I walk ordering portions good  But most importantly BBQs  good  don't eat much pork but when needs best!  I would try food again overall enjoyed it  <EOR> I Big Ern's family lunch  menu deceitful  combo meal doesn't tell many ribs 3 clerk didn't tell would 3 ribs side $10 6 larger price + paying $4 side  ribs sinewy small fries didn't come until 20 minutes ordering  time really didn't want fries all   I asked confusing sign  They're apparently middle updating it  If they're aware problems  sign clerk should've helped order   I wish Yelp advertising sign restaurant     way wouldn't pay fries 20 minutes late   We coming back  <EOR> I literally would even feed dog if one   How does place many positive reviews? Oh probably because you're all caught Tony Hseih has a golden dick bubble think because he endorsed place stupid looking outdoor mall any reputable quality   Meat dry hell sauces no flavor possible ask? don't waste your money finding out prices way higher should something I'd rather throw give meth addicts waiting outside park    I am very happy say date took didn't contribute anything establishment  say however date didn't know any better wasn't fault   We also during grand opening when would think food would best  Uhhh     really really sad  <EOR> Great food Ern greeted door made recommendations   All smiles nice employees beans sick good too  <EOR> Miserable Lady taking order insulting whole time tying order kids menu chicken fingers   She asked if wanted anything drink tiny little kids cup    Wtf   asked standard water she still refused give regular sized cup   Over all  chicken strips taste any others happy chicken fingers fix  sake business   Hire new staff  <EOR> Reasonably priced nice portions  brisket overdone but flavor good tender  chicken great  fries good  mac cheese good added salt pepper  service good  recommend order food without sauce 2 sauces default sauce wasn't good other option  wish could give more details sauces but weren't labeled  <EOR> Trying part support local businesses Container Park which today saturday more resembled chuck e cheese more strollers ever seen Vegas  can't think reason back especially Big Erns   Just back place say? Just wow   it AWFUL     First off service   Good thing tip before your food people behind counter could put simple plate together under 15 minutes  hoped would worth painfully long wait but hopes quickly dashed   We two sandwiches three sides all which less meh    Chicken sandwich=cold dry undersauced cold bun= D Pulled Pork Sandwich=cold dry huge chunk fat= F Macncheese= Cold cheesy no flavor whatsoever= D Beans= Best menu only thing came close finishing=B Coleslaw=Fresh crisp but flavorless=C  All all never return seek better BBQ Mall Food Courts Airports  <EOR> I work downtown neighboring restaurant frequent Big Ern's when break  gotta say      brisket AMAZING!

Space limited inside seats outside  originally gonna sit outside but then noticed above your head where people walking holes flooring above  If mind dirt other god awful things people's shoes SIT PATIO    Overall decent  <EOR> Trash!!! Cole slaw Wack beans horrible brisket dry    Chicken average    Sauce plain    If looking stone good ole fashioned bbq smh    over charge  <EOR> Warning restaurant Grade C December 2015!!
