If used any garlic probably used speck garlic  need consider renaming dish Peanut Noodle since whole noodle appeared drenched peanut sauce    Sashimi used Sashimi Salad old  did taste fresh all  worth $12   Blackened Ahi seared ahi black bean sauce thank goodness peanut sauce pineapple relish roasted garlic rice  Again should consider revising description Dry ahi uncooked tropical rice side disappointment   point don't know garlic talking because did taste hint garlic  Rice uncooked tasted tropical mango? pineapple?   Pineapple relish unnecessary touch  rather garlic side pineapple relish  worth $20   Even though appetizer main dish disappointing did enjoy Matcha Cheesecake Mango Cheesecake  Matcha Cheesecake came chocolate sauce top really good  Mango Cheesecake tiny pieces mango cheesecake topped mango sauce  Both delicious but worth $5 piece   CONCLUSION Unless peanut fanatic yourself favor don't come here  Market Street Cafe located few doors down much better  Third time's charm ?
