What's attitude??  Now understand many casinos want sell casino chips because made table play  that  understand that  Ever since moved late 90's buy 2 3 chips each casino part personal collection  am chip dealer  sell them  simply something modest little collection  could understand if wanted buy 20 30 50   or whatever    but 3??? Really?? All attitude short curt responses hardly necessary    In 15 years doing NEVER cage cashier treat way she did today  older lady working cage around 11 30 morning  Completely unnecessary totally uncalled for   I'm most annoyed didn't hit cage first because  spent money machines made some sports bets first  experienced first would left immediately   I tell thing though  11 year love affair Ellis Island over  back no longer bring friends family brews bbq slots etc  drive past many other casinos treat asking 3 $1 chips criminal offense   1 star   Welcome Hall Shame  <EOR> What hell yelpers! thought maybe power 4 stars over 700 reviews could compel love place  But couldn't past amazingly terrible place was! No matter heavily intoxicated hungover eating still mistake   Now don't wrong came positive attitude  wouldn't excited legit meal would cost less $10 especially Vegas! wait 45 minutes before we're finally seated  While walking through restaurant back portion to fit all 12 us noticed half place empty  unsure why waited 45 minutes table  Nevertheless brushed aside retaining hope ready 4 star meal  all ordered steak special  Simple right? Well no because waited hour half all food  starving point  when food finally came just wanted eat  Except knife could barely cut through steak  well done slab meat plate just hot rubber  managed eat half meal because needed something just keep stomach ease  But definitely satisfied  Come think don't think anyone table happy meal  Some friends even over gas station next door buy bag chips because emptiness Ellis Island left with   What's terrible here? service food wait food  Just disappointed all around  But hey another star Ellis Island being such affordable place people come eat gamble  Just don't expect come around again  <EOR> Went steak eggs 8 am couldn't any more pleased meal!

So all starving myself especially included since hadn't eaten all day  looked menu immediately drawn king cut prime rib  Underneath remark said ask your server double cut   hunger pain state figured would just more meat spread along plate wide steak me?  Oh wrong when waiter brought myself another coworker ordered same thing giant slabs meat stacked vertically slab meat vs horizontal   I said hell this?!  very nice tone waiter said double cut prime rib ordered    said shit   Lol also came buttery mashed potatoes some best green beans ever shady restaurant   But doesn't compare king cut prime rib guys  best prime rib ever life!

OK let's proceed     Review #13 the hotel joint next door Super 8 should tell lot right old school semi smoky very small walk around perimeter 5 minutes if you're walking slow! very little recommend place except 2 things eating drinking! Cafe specials legendary also Metro Pizza outlet which basically just counter some tables but hard quality vs  price ratio pizzas strombolis best all own beer $2 per pint yep typo give bartender $10 bill he gives full pint amber stout pale ale whatever plus $8 change crazy! best craft beer bet = well craft beer might slight stretch but only serve own homemade juice sure beats macro beer Bud Coors Miller swill did mention only $2 per pint? <EOR> You love Las Vegas  much find high end things equally find lower end  When say lower end don't mean cheap quality  am talking bargains  Lost lot money those rigged slot machines? Highly unlikely  Nobody 70?s reads blog  probably lost money Black Jack tables  maybe rough game Hold'em? way just because lost al your money doesn't mean eat won big  Ellis Island Casino Brewery small casino just barely off strip Koval Lane  casino isn't much but restaurant brewery inside another story  Filled cheap yet quality food beer Vegas er's must those tight budget   I king cut prime rib  side green beans baked potato dish great balance protein carb greens  prime rib bloody red fatty  made juicy cut beef made happy  fat running down middle side ajus definately juicy everything   Topping all off horseradish made everything perfect  name King Cut suggests uber thick cut  wasn't  mean no Diamond Jim Brady Cut Lawry's  Don't wrong still pretty thick  then end all large piece meat lot flavor  ridiculous price something $12  Considering price I'd say prime rib pretty dang thick  Just two your thicker thick prime rib right 24 bucks! Did mention prime rib comes beer? opted something light  Hefe Weiss ale perfect  more ask huge prime rib beer?  Ellis Island Casino Brewery also steak eggs cheap too  6 bucks 8oz new york strip steak eggs toast your side potato  home fries great eggs toast but steak star  course lot less juicy prime rib true steak nonetheless  Cooked perfect medium rare lean cut beef its purest  Did dare ask some A 1 sauce? don't care say stuff liquid gold  fancy shmancy place  But really 6 bucks all this? Only Vegas   I guess lose all your money Vegas still come top  Imagine if same establishment minus casino came Los Angeles would nut! same thing Denny's Sizzler would double price  just can't anywhere else but Las Vegas  Ellis Island Casino casino pretty run down  If don't want play bingo always play online  don't really play bingo  mother in law know but when mood find best bingo sites use ballsupbingo com  All all though food beer excellent  Just lose everything black but keep $20  Restaurants strip most likely worth anyways  <EOR> Old school Vegas still offers cigarette machines  Cafe clean reasonably priced  Unpretentious all means  <EOR> Bought gift certificate promote local business then bartender stole called security head officer said blind spot  blind spot your main bar low customer hours!  Watch Your Money  especially Manny <EOR> I many times  I Yelp it  First  I would give 5 stars but service SLOW!! seen servers break down fight generally act depressed  But cheap steak dinner killer root beer! I never bad reaction food its always tasty  even great brownie sundae if sort thing  Sometimes wait long  but sit down @ slot machine order drink  they call your # when its time  scored many free meal playing winning video poker!

If ever come back Las Vegas frequenting place more! upset found last day trip! <EOR> 4 stars people? Really?!?   I think lot time people into place really low expectations then when place better expected think better rate higher should  case restaurant Ellis Island    That's say place isn't good because is  past weekend when looking cheap steak someone recommended place  When arrived noticed big food truck festival front  would think everyone eating trucks restaurant would empty but much surprise still 30 minute wait table    Turned good cause gave time tetanus shot which should required upon entering building  checking food truck festival chatting people Yelp booth sat down video poker machine gamble little bit until table ready  True story girls Yelp table took break came over where playing video poker hit me! Awesome!! for record she cute hell but other plans night     Okay back review  When finally around seating looking menu decided fillet special  $7 99 steak vegetable choice potato soup salad homemade beers root beer    I chose salad which legally qualified salad because lettuce  Don't expect much though literally lettuce salad dressing 2 cherry tomatoes nothing else  fine but nothing special    When dinner came little disappointed vegetable offering  special came green beans but don't green beans asked if another vegetable offering waiter offered replace green beans mixed vegetable which turned more green beans some corn carrots mixed in  didn't try them  friend green beans initially said good but then didn't eat them take will    The baked potato perfectly fine  kinda hard mess baked potato didn't    The steak very pleasant surprise  honestly didn't expect much $7 99 steak kind place but very good  Tender no real gristle cooked exactly ordered it  ate every bite very satisfied it    Having major drinking plans later night just root beer drink  say homemade root beer damned tasty  highly recommend that!   The service okay but weren't offered any dessert    The atmosphere Coco's hasn't updated 30 years quite loud    So look place bad? Definitely not!   Is worthy 4 stars? Absolutely not!   Was best $7 99 steak ever had? YES!   I can't say would back can't say would recommend but wouldn't avoid going back wouldn't tell anyone else avoid either  <EOR> So place great hidden gem those people little excited now can't afford feed themselves  usually steak eggs but chicken waffles delicious very large portions  took family all full less $50  Also really good blood Mary while waited definitely try place deals without hangover  5 stars value food location  <EOR> Definitely gem  Great prices huge amounts food  Also drinks beer cheap great! <EOR> I actually kind love Ellis Island often but honest review 3 stars probably best place    We always steak special which 8 99 your players club coupons print machine includes huge beer steak potato green beans soup salad  Usually great but unfortunately fairly inconsistent  husband order exact same thing steaks look completely different medium well practically raw  80% time great dinner but 20% bums sometimes  Also daughter ordered fried chicken once while 3 pieces perfect raw inside   obviously fairly dangerous something shouldn't happened    I say brought all town family all love rave good deal beer always want every time come something old school place people especially old people drawn to    My favorite thing whole place beer  LOVE Hefe Weiss  LOVE IT! dirt cheap free if steak special  Also find more Hefe drink less care bad stuff place As everyone said extremely smoky  find restaurant bad smoke drifting but casino bar bad! watched karaoke bar throat hurt day afterward because all smoke  Also bathroom whole place while never wait line walk feels longer longer night and beer drinking! on    So would say if foodie super cheap meal deal some cigarette smoke probably enjoy place  many strip casinos gotten over priced pretentious nice place option when just want something cozy old school  <EOR> I recently discovered place  am glad did  say tourist town where locals well where locals go  told lot casino dealers limo drivers come shifts end  think says lot  no five star steakhouse but decent more that  main value proposition place course price mean $6 99 steak beer? Again no SW but steak costs less appetizer high end steakhouse    The casino newly formed party pit which quite entertaining  kill softly smile  doesn't mind losing Christina Aguilera? <EOR> Decent cheap steak eggs service little slow but busy ok  Atmosphere alright mostly locals few tourists keep wandering found place  would try again  <EOR> This hole wall casino restaurant  simple  food prices cheap help less moderate place out dated  If you're looking low key place grab cheap bite potential bubble guts your place  Just sure take some Pepcid AC   I gave them star because service awful  asked hostess if could use electric plug partially recharge phone  She tried convince none plugs restaurant work she could absolutely nothing me  wasn't asking much just quick 10 15 minute recharge    Secondly waiter forgetful  sat no utensils awhile    Thirdly ordered $9 99 steak beer meal   Yuck! steak ordered supposed medium but very dry well done   Lastly beer warm   I ended drinking ate some food paid heck there  Now am feeling sick  won't back Not worth hassle  <EOR> What else say? $4 99 steak egg breakfast specials! $7 99 steak dinner comes potato green brands salad own root beer specials!  5 times over 2 Vegas trips  Every time everything always cooked perfectly  Staff friendly  thing though today steak breakfast wasn't available  but because 11am during week prob because CES but usually anytime however gave chance try low carb fried chicken special! 4 pieces non battered fried greasy salad  $5 99!
