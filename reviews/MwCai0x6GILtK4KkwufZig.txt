Forget it  few available screen zones often times all 3 games they're showing commercial   Maybe because don't drop big coin into Martini's video poker most customers but request watch specific college basketball game during recent Broncos Steelers playoff game shut down surprisingly unempathetic attitude bartenders also never remembers we're regulars  didn't stay would something 60th+ visit Martini  Time find new neighborhood bar? maybe should always peek in first sure only favorite bartenders working? <EOR> Pretty delish!  used visit place lot but hadn't quite while   boyfriend insists keep coming back thing deep fried fluffernutter sandwhich chocolate dipping sauce   amazing worth sugar coma lapse into eating it   The new owners revamped menu haven't disappointed yet   staff friendly kind  <EOR> My review based solely happy hour  Stopped friend work martini only disappointed  am regular dirty martini drinker dirty martini honestly worst ones ever had  tasted purely olive juice shriveled olives served drink  friend apple martini which tasted pre mixed syrup  Truly disappointed because location great great ambience  big expectations great martini since called The Martini   returning happy hour  <EOR> Excellent food!
