Really?!  explain again raw chicken  She offered half order chicken compensate raw chicken served us  don't think so! raw chicken enough  asked if could discount off item denied couple dollars back into pocket   Business must slow wonder why? Needless say NEVER eat again recommend restaurant anyone!

Def need more chef tho  much cooking person felt rushed but he kept cool tried give best  bad wasn't enough time show off moves entertain kiddos   Also don't when they're close closing only time husband felt cold service  Other enjoyed food each every time   price fair too  <EOR> I Wednesday night whim finding discount coupon $12 $21 worth sushi  Sushi chef Michael believe very polite  obnoxious couple other side sushi counter being loud but Michael kept composure    The sushi fantastic  first time eat sushi counter obviously first experience quality fish because much better flavor color texture ever seen before  nigiri cuts very generous rolls good size well  definitely pay for  Food service very prompt but beverage service left lot desired  never offered soy sauce single bottle counter  Thankfully sushi delicious did need soy sauce  also took long time drink never offered refill until basically done then brought water instead soda drinking  observed couple across counter several refills before even offered one  waitresses hiding somewhere because never even walked ask refill    I am hoping poor beverage service because hour half before closing obviously starting clean norm  Thankfully sushi more made beverage service  definitely return! <EOR> Got Chance try sushi very impressed  chef very friendly  Only complain servers look need some training  never check us  sushi chef actually take orders provide whatever needed  <EOR> I absolutely hate place  2 weeks ago night just didn't happen any 50% off happy hour  order simple plain rolls menu  Still $5 $9 some basic rolls  actually good rolls $10 over    And honestly never life worse sushi this  Honest god some pieces rice still hard everything tasted very old fresh    I ordered extra eel sauce umagi sauce some may call extra spicy mayo  Dudes fucking charge $1 50 sauce! wanted charge $6 some fucking extra sauce!
