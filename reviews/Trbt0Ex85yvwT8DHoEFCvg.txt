Haha  <EOR> Been multiple times before  most important memory first time ever creme brûlée   This restaurant located Planet Hollywood Mile Shops formerly Aladdin hotel  strategically situated middle long streak overpriced shops  All walking gets buddies hungry  do? Eat Ocean   The restaurant actually doesn't many walls  Instead large window spaces restaurant feel more open spacious  nice touch   Environment open feeling restaurant very welcoming  place never really feels crowded although because location setup always loud  If doesn't bother then seat take look menu  decor fits personality restaurant which trying pull off casual but sophisticated look   Waiters waitresses waitress did above beyond call duty  She only came table take order drop off food drop off bill pick bill  probably worst part particular dining experience  Otherwise nothing really stands employee   Food half pound sirloin steak burger  patty cooked medium well no pink covered melted provolone cheese  addition topped normal staple lettuce tomato raw red onion slices  All together pretty tasty  distinct flavor home made hamburger prepared fresh beef  restaurant little stingy steak fries  didn't look if seasons but hint garlic evident    Drinks only water  Sorry   Recommendation EAT! <EOR> BEST PRICES TOWN!
