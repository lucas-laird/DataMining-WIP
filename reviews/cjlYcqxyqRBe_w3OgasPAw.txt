Love radio commercials which played major role getting through door first time  <EOR> I noticed new location few weeks ago today lunch drove over there    ordered lunch staff very friendly polite    couldn't help but notice clean restaurant also   sandwich lightning speed sat down eat it      While enjoying lunch noticed handicapped man trying front door   employee named   GEORGE ran front door held open come in    He then took man's order customer side counter    When man's order done George asked if he needed napkins things that    George then neatly packed mans order bag man asked put bag back pack attacked pack wheel chair scooter    George did man asked then walked front door held open asked man if he needed any additional help getting car anything    very impressed nice he man above beyond he him     Jimmy Johns great sandwiches love them    But call want its fast food    am use seeing people working fast food acting that      My uncle wheel chair saw many times people treated he wasnt even there    gave George big tip plan giving them all future business    Oh food great too!   Great Job! <EOR> I admit it  curious Jimmy John's because commercials  know ones where talk reeeeally fast  saw them delivering neighbors across street decided try ourselves   The first time ordered delivery caught then bad day sort of   Placed order online which great because website simple easy navigate through  Sometimes feel more convenient ordering person saying Italian Night Club French Bread no tomatoes onions mayo  Also would add extra Italian dressing Dijon mustard      Oh maybe some bacon well  also cut sandwich half? took 20 minutes show house which wasn't bad  employee even called let know driver running late  nice them  Yes add delivery charges but doesn't nowadays? ordered delivery several times already always delivered 10 minutes  guess really freaky fast delivery! All sandwiches tried pretty good  favorite #12 Beach Club  Italian subs good but could use more Italian dressing  thing really stood sandwiches clean hold very well  Don't just hate when eating sandwich all ingredients start falling other end? don't know must magical bread something! restaurant few times well  dining area clean service fast friendly  prefer Jimmy John's over Subway Quiznos sure! Its nice know option delivery since everything else usually pizza  most part live advertisements except don't talk fast  p <EOR> In rush need sandwich Jimmy John's usually good spot that  location even more convenient because only offers delivery walk service also drive thru  Fast efficient solid sandwiches  always pickle when go  should too  <EOR>
