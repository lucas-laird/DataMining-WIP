Nope  He gets even more rude he explains 25% off each pizza would actually 50% off entire order   sure where he learned way doing math but wrong comical  If you'd deal when placing orders all means  Luckily delivery drivers always pleasant  <EOR> Wow    difference couple months makes  caught them good day last time bad day time     HAPPENED?
