Going Happen watch walked 60 yards Zeffirino's   It almost empty? hell thought  Italian restaurant mobbed some 60 yards away almost empty  Well good sign  But seated very nice hostess showered very good bread water opening gratis appetizer  OK far  why place doing business? We all ordered food came right temperture fresh tasted good and         So gives? couldn't figure out  Maybe outdoor actually indoor seating Canaletto's? Maybe light airy atmosphere Canaletto's opposed darker more traditional look Zeffirino's? Could creepy stuffed mannequinn Luciano Pavarotti foray? Probably not  Well certainly wasn't service food  restaurant very good would back! fresh homemade pastas very fresh fish mediocre though caesar salad but very good aged parmigiano reggiano cheese   It nice dinner being second choice  finished dinner just same time would seated Canaletto's  did right coming here  <EOR> If could give place negative stars would   far worst dining experience ever food absolutely horrible   Here's recap My parents received two vouchers free lunch dinner Zefferino's part promotion attending timeshare presentation resort booth Venetian We ate Zefferino's lunch June 10 2013 My parents free meal choice several entrees included salad coffee tea   Grand Canal menu which $25 When sat down server took 3 minutes come over table upon seeing free meal coupons he did greet just said oh those he annoyed table The water brought table warm no ice We asked ice ask second server bring ice server didn't when ice brought he just brought bucket set table without saying anything  My dad doesn't drink coffee tea asked if he could diet soda instead server said no only what's card very stiff annoyed manner    like would difficult just give soft drink instead coffee tea  My mom salad grilled salmon dad salad chicken marsala calamari appetizer pan seared salmon filet dessert various pastries The calamari rubbery tasted previously frozen quality par something would grocery store frozen section The salads parents bland tasteless The chicken marsala dad ordered terrible   When say terrible mean absolutely horrendous almost inedible  Chicken rubbery overcooked tasted previously frozen microwaved definitely pan seared supposed marsala sauce tasted canned gravy both agreed worst chicken marsala ever tasted chicken marsala dad's favorite dish  The salmon caked breading no indication being pan seared no sear marks anywhere also tasted previously frozen no garlic white wine onions parsley black olives menu indicated The potatoes dry no seasoning The server never came back table ask anything before finished eating it When dessert came Grand Canal menu came three tiny bite sized pastries all them soggy soft touch left refrigerator overnight or longer moisture made them mushy   obviously freshly made  When server finally came back table asked food told honestly everything absolutely terrible gave reasons why he said something effect oh sorry hear    He walked away did offer bring anything else never told manager complaint  The server did bring coffee tea he just dropped check table never bothered ask if wanted order anything else asked coffee tea remind second time before brought out The tea Lipton tea bag hot water   fine dining restaurant should giving customers Lipton tea bag 100 bags grocery store $3  On way restaurant server walking towards immediately walked other way wanting say anything way out  Since parents' 30th anniversary vacation did want big deal experience front them decided voice complaints returned home   parents left Vegas 6 14  6 15 spoke Mr  Russo described all items above he said he would talk server back me   He asked send copy receipt email address which did 6 17   6 30 still received any response   sent follow email response follows Good evening Mr  ****** apologize delay spoke Manager chef server duty June 10th  manager said none customer complained asked talk day  chef said he didn't any complain calamari salmon  server said no leftover food during your lunch  I only apologize if food didn't meet your expectations  If aware your complain moment would able your experience better one  Best

happy  felt authentic italian everything tasted fresh  bit pricey all equals average because used restaurants Philadelphia  <EOR> I've found mark good Italian restaurant well spaghetti bolognese  seems simplest Italian dishes encompasses everything good Italian food  well done pasta tasty meat sauce spiced just right something basic mama teaches you I know stupid rule but worked nonetheless     My bolognese joint came lumpy absent taste  waitstaff take time and wasn't busy all unless bringing cheque  wife ordered veal overdone  third person party ordered eggplant parm which pretty much only vegetarian thing had done relatively well    I see charm wanting eat but just worth price humble estimation  eaten good Italian food Italy NYC Philadelphia L A  am yet find place matches definition Las Vegas  <EOR> One word Overrated   I definitely underwhelmed food  Ambiance nice if watch shopping mall where you're sitting we seated nice location overlooking toilet blue water gondolas Kenneth

baby shrimp definitely didn't skimp seafood  sauce pretty flavorful noodles cooked well  just wasn't orgasmically delicious  Oh serving size Buca esque which isn't good sign supposedly fine dining establishment  Also garnished random piece purple cabbage parsley  PARSLEY?? seriously?? thought classy joint!  2 Pan seared breaded veal loin topped tomato mozzarella parmigiano served sauted tomato pasta This bf's dish  He didn't veal which SMOTHERED cheese but he said pasta alright   Since neither wine lovers just ordered few cocktails much server's dismay  He visibly bothered decision skip
