Not good  some high points beverage area fried shrimp breakfast type casserole  Other many damn lines greasy bacon potatoes rubbery watery artificial eggs watered down o j  rubbery crepes mushy waffles off tasting pecan pie on   One worst things could say place Home Town Buffet step if you're familiar restaurant speak disagree then Circus Circus Buffet may place you   <EOR> Ruhig im Zimmer nicht weit vom Strip sehr günstig über Reisebüro 3 Nächte für zusammen unter 75 Euro! Ein Gratis Frühstück WLAN auf Zimmer usw   Innen ist es sauber und geräumig 2 Doppelbetten die auch noch bequem waren einem Zimmer dennoch sind die Zimmer mittlerweile älter und es abgewohnt bei dem Preis aber absolut Ok  Perfekt für Familien! Im Circus Circus befindet sich ein Steakhouse das seit 25 Jahren ständig zum Steakhouse der Stadt gewählt wird  Ich nie ein vergleichbares Steak gehabt! Die haben ihren eigenen Reifeaum fürs Fleisch und die Portionen der Steaks groß  Mein Porterhousesteak wog schätzungsweise 550 600 Gramm  Mit 2 Personnen sollte man aber 100 Dollar und mehr einplanen aber es lohnt sich!!! Freies Parken für Autos! <EOR> The food ok good but varies lot  Serving tables set hot heat lamps food  fresh kitchen better stuff  sitting  Salad table fine deserts   any case considerably better eating Beatty last two days  <EOR> A pretty basic buffet probably worst town but cheap enough decent breakfast   kids liked definitely family friendly  <EOR> OH MEIN GOTT   diese Lautstärke überall   es ist eng plüschig bunt schrill und laut! Das ist das Hotel Circus Circus! Dieses Hotel gehört mit seinen 3770 Zimmer eher zu den ganz alten Hotels am Strip  Eröffnet wurde es 1968 und befasst sich mit dem Thema Zirkus  Stündlich gibt es Zirkusaufführungen überall dudelt es Musik und es laufen verkleidete Menschen durch das Hotel  Ich frage mich wie man dort Arbeiten kann  Bekommen die Angestellten eine Geräuschzulage? Unzumutbar!    diesem Hotel gibt es auch den grössten Indoor Freizeitpark der Welt  Unter einer riesigen roten Kuppel befindet sich auf engstem Raum Fahrgeschäfte Schiessbuden Essensstände eine Looping Achterbahn eine Wildwasserbahn ein Karussel und und und   und man kann sich auch hier vorstellen welche Geräuschkulisse sich dieser Kugel entwickelt! Wahnsinn!

Seriously? Well whatever  only people eat hicks probably consider food gods who've saved entire lives vacay Circus Circus 30 bucks night fees  <EOR> I shocked price buffet   Vegas gone sky high good old days   buffet terrible oatmeal cold time through line   never again  <EOR> Die Bewertungen sagen die Wahrheit  Das Hotel ist schon recht alt die Zimmer besonders auf den Raucher Etagen  VORSICHT! riechen muffelig  Zu empfehlen ist eine der höheren Etagen da diese einfach viel leiser sind  Der Preis allerdings ist der Hammer  Ich habe im Sommer 2011 dort genächtigt und im Schnitt unter 40 Dollar pro Nacht bezahlt  Darin enthalten Das wirklich große Zimmer mit zwei großen Betten ein alter aber funktionstüchtiger und großer Fernseher einige gratis Fahrten im hoteleigenen Vergnügungspark und  und das ist leider nicht allen Hotels Vegas  GRATIS WLAN! Sogar recht schnell Skype etc  hat super geklappt  Also wer günstig übernachten ich brauche kein super Hotel bin eh meist unterwegs ist hier gut aufgehoben  Der deuce fährt direkt vor der Tür auch ein Fußmarsch bis runter die Mitte vom Strip ist leicht machbar  Schräg gegenüber ist ein walgreens hier habe ich mich immer gern für mein Frühstück eingedeckt Spätaufsteher nach langen Poker Nächten   Im August geht es wieder nach Vegas mal sehen wo es mich diesmal hin verschlägt  Have fun! <EOR> Take your hard earned dollars elsewhere  buffet very dissapointing  hotel continued fall short mediocre hoped buffet would good considering price  exactly paid LasVegas  other buffets maybe 5 10 dollars more per person but easily twice selection place  Trust spend money if eat you'll wishing didn't  <EOR> Totally disappointed! husband some comped cash playing slot machines really only reason since seen bad reviews place  paid $13 99 ea  breakfast buffet which consisted pan cakes mini waffles sausage eggs  guess would expect but price  no variety really lacked choices  15 minutes getting began switch lunch foods  probably 10 15 items choose which only tempted try fried shrimp best thing had maniccoti sp   would back even comped cash  <EOR> To honest place bad  dad told last time he food service horrid but improved much  really first place eat but still good  Some improvements still need made such labeling some foods obvious but some things pies desert area hard figure out Also shrimp little rubber side  All all Circus Buffet bad but could better  <EOR> My wife son lunch buffet mid week December 2016  We'd before several years ago enjoyed expecting same  long wait paid first surprise over $60 three no extras such beer   Ok thought price food must very special steaks prime rib etc    table noticed many other empty tables  Why long wait seated?   Anyway least food must good unnecessary wait  No wasn't  None could believe appalling selection  carvery only offered ham  steak roast beef prime rib sight  Apart basic breakfast food eggs greasy sausages bacon tacos cereals deep fried battered shrimp  desserts also poor   For over $20 each felt robbed  worst buffet experience ever  think could've decent buffet hotel Palace Station $7 each   Instead forked over $60 glorified greasy breakfast selection at 1 30 pm!     You may making money short term but word around long term lose many customers  Nobody likes ripped off  <EOR> It's old country buffet but nice  Better off eating McD's site fur better quality food <EOR> This hands down worst buffets Strip  only redeeming qualities buffet cheap price small miracle neither suffered food poisoning afterwards  Oftentimes pay but still abysmal value when food bad  Both wife agree wouldn't come back even if completely free  fact couldn't even pay eat again   The astute reader may ask LV locals should known better  Yes certainly did BUT cousin visiting insisted going least part because 18 month old picky eater  She certain buffet would kid friendly foods child would willing eat  Having read lousy reviews place but actually experienced ourselves great trepidation agreed meet them hoping wouldn't quite bad reported  Unfortunate hopeful optimism turned despair when reality unfolded before eyes tastebuds   For 45 minutes endured throngs adults screaming children waiting in  many people can't wrong right? Oh yes certainly very very wrong that  seated close three buffet lines but all downhill there  buffet caters families small children would believe near Herculean effort took obtain simple high chair! Finally first buffet line presented VERY limited selection unappetizing items  Please refer wife's Candace C others' reviews if really need gory details  am having PTSD just thinking it  Hey maybe we'll better luck other two buffet lines  collective jaws drop when realize all three lines serving same food! Maybe salad dessert lines half decent  No such luck  add insult injury used plates barely eaten food continued accumulate remain uncleared table  service good thing soft drinks self serve  But enough horror time wrap things up   Now typically when visit buffet self restraint takes back seat most customers money's worth  few buffets where actually left still hungry  nutshell take home message  Sorry coz love but if insist coming next time dining without us! <EOR> Horrible   many better choice down strip   food reminded lunch room food when kid  twice once breakfast once dinner both times all disappointed  Seems everything came frozen  Price cheap but food  <EOR> We planning eat here  husband pre diabetic suffered unexpected drop blood sugar figured best choice close hand  making mistake again  food choice extremely limited despite fact nearly 7 00 p m  food obviously sitting long time  Prime Rib dry over cooked Chicken Parmigiana rubber topped ketchup  Even desserts soggy sitting sauces long  also want call Beverage Oasis section  While must say far most options any part buffet glasses tiny constantly keep getting refills  just bad experience all around  <EOR> We ate last evening stayed Circus Circus   wasn't horrible    just walked no line   drink dessert lanes nice    Salad bar basic but fresh tasting     They several different set ups a fried chicken fixings turkey fixings kids foods pizza type stuff carving station roast beef turkey pork roast think fish seafood section nothing excited taco area     We ate night rather disappointing dinner Garden Grill  buffet actually improvement     If staying hotel tired long day walking if isn't long line ok   wouldn't great if wait line  definately wouldn't special trip visit  <EOR> I ate buffet twice while staying hotel   pay per meal option well all day option wristband where eat much want whole day   first time breakfast   breakfast bad line scrambled eggs ham sausage traditional breakfast favorites   beverage station diners own beverages   orange juice horrible   However good selection fresh fruit     The second time lunch Saturday disturbing experience   type buffet where people staggering around farm animals glazed eyes belly trough   quite crowded lines most stations food mediocre   lot chicken some fried shrimp other traditional offerings such barbeque enchiladas   However again salad bar fresh some healthy choices     The scariest item probably hot glutinous neon yellow cheese baked potato station     If you're staying hotel worthwhile quick breakfast but worth waiting any time if line  <EOR> This place awful  Food terrible tried breakfast but failed 15 minutes waffle cooked  Only 1 waffle iron wirth crowd people waiting only find iron stopped working  Coffee burnt whole place pretty dirty  recommend place again  <EOR> Das Hotel ist nicht zu EmpfehlenGibt es weit aus bessere möglichkeiten Die Buffets im Fransösischen Bereich sind KlasseDas Steakhouse im Ceasar iss der HammerDer Club Rio mit tollem Blick zwar unverschämt teuer aber eine Erfahrung wert  Mehr House music als Black music wären mir lieber gewesen  <EOR> Riesiges Hotel wie bei allen Hotels auf dem Strip 24 h Daueraction  Es war mein erster Besuch Vegas war hoffentlich auch mein letzter  Scheußliche Plastikwelt   Ich habe es gebucht weil es nicht weit vom ConventionCenter liegt  Einchecken am Fließband auschecken ebenso  Selbst Nachts um 3 Uhr reger Betrieb wie man es sich bei uns nur tagsüber vorstellen würde  Man bekommt einen Hoteplan mit um sich orientieren zu können und damit man die Aufzüge nicht verwechselt  Mein Zimmer war sauber geräumig ruhig   Das Hotel ist schön älter für Las Vegas eigentlich schon zu alt  Dennoch war es sauber und ruhig und das war für mich ausschlaggebend  Kommt natürlich darauf WO das Zimmer ist Frühstück einem der vielen Restaurants typisch amerikanisch üppig nicht mein Geschmack   KRASS Innerhalb vom Hotel befindet sich neben dem Casino ein kleiner Europapark mit Achterbahn etc  Völlig abgefahren wers mag Ich würde sagen für Las Vegas Fans ich bin definitiv keiner ein günstiges Hotel nicht weit vom Strip  Beim reservieren darauf achten daß man ein ruhiges Zimmer bucht     dann denke ich wird Vegas für die Familie ein tolles Erlebnis   Habe im Hotel nur einmal gegessen  Das Hilton war direkt neben dem Conventioncenter dort bekam ich leider kein Zimmer mehr und dort hatte es sehr gute Restaurants wovon ich echt begeistert war  <EOR> Nicht meine erste Wahl wenn ich Vegas bin  Das Hotel ist ziemlich veraltet die Zimmer riechen sehr eigenartig und wirken abgewohnt und etwas schmuddelig   Leider ist der Service auch nicht besonders freundlich der Réception und auch am Concierge Desk scheint man nur die allernötigsten Informationen zu geben und dies mit wenig Freundlichkeit und Begeisterung   Die Restaurants sind auch nicht der Brüller da geht man lieber ein anderes Vegas Hotel zum Essen   Alles allem ist das Hotel sehr renovierungsbedürftig danach würde das ganze warscheinlich wieder anders aussehen  Zudem ist es nicht ganz zentral gelegen   Dafür ist das Circus Circus auch preisgünstig und wenn man nicht zu hohe Ansprüche hat ist es unter den gegebenen Umständen okay  <EOR> Yes food average tending low  wife agrees most people best item buffet fried shrimp   As liked fried chicken  don't eat much but pieces pretty good though bit salty   Tried lunch buffet today heading tomorrow breakfast  really cheap all inclusive package buffet included   Can't agree lines dude place really empty today  Then again Wednesday  <EOR> Remove box frozen food items microwave place serving trays  TahDah!  I breakfast dinner multiple times only reason gets 2 because its all eat never made sick before   Staff unhappy some attitude rush bothering them  line amount open tables does sense   The food much flavor cardboard  reminds college dining hall  Thank god BBQ sauce Tabasco syrup wouldn't realize eating food   For $10 more flawless meal Bellagio  <EOR> One 2 strip hotels aimed towards children  cheap cheerful! Rooms modern updated whole place just looks tired worn     There's reason rooms cost £30 night  also boarding dodgy area downtown really safe walking night  <EOR> the worst buffet dinner ever las vegas last night  food very simple no flavor  desserts better  But rather somewhere else  <EOR> Went lunch  6 people  Price decent lunch still breakfast options good brunch  Service picking plates bit slow but its everywhere  Food wasn't bad place pretty clean elegant  <EOR> We ate breakfast quality very poor  would never recommend eating would rather Mc Donalds <EOR> Go during lunch buffet  breakfast lunch  eggs good bacon crispy IF wait until refill it  If don't wait  the bacon crispy  Just little tip   dessert bar worth sure  some yummy pies cakes   price  you really can't complain  Some food better others  that why buffet! Try few things until find   Then just some more like! hard!   For price really good deal  may search around find something really but hey  when eat all want  why complain? Thank Circus Circus  <EOR> Not bet long way  originally going stay but changed mind am glad did  Its more blackpool arcade vegas hotel  Tacky cheap looking its good indication vegas experience  just see muich better rest strip is! <EOR> Tastes eating school lunch   place deserves negative 10   all need quote 2 adolescent boys  <EOR> Cheap hotel towards top end strip     Many people talk badly hotel but think if want cheap clean hotel it  never found hotel dirty ill repair all times stayed there     Staff always polite food good  steakhouse restaurant voted best Las Vegas 15 times  eaten Sunday brunch amazing  Breakfast buffet good casino cafe good late night snack     rooms currently being refurbished only better books  <EOR> Not great choice if you're expecting luxury clean rooms prominent place strip  hotel Vegas accommodation Ryanair airline market  Although don't forget home 'America's Largest Indoor Theme Park' won't disappointed zipping through five loop spin rollacoaster  Watch cockroaches Manor House complex staff apparently don't possess bug spray guess bugs unusual sighting middle dessert  figure! <EOR> Das Circus Circus ist ein mittelklasse Mittelklasse Hotel  Wir waren den Seitengebäuden neben den eigentlichen Hotel untergebracht und es ging so  Die Zimmer waren Ordnung aber eben nicht 1a  Das Wlan sollte 12$ pro Tag kosten ich ganz schön happig fand und zur Zeit befinden sich rund um das Hotel Baustellen die den Strip dort doch sehr unansehnlich machen  Im Adventuredom finden sich viele Fahrgeschäfte und allerlei Buden mit Spielen die aber nur teilweise geld kosten und nur spärlich besetzt waren  Vielleicht war es auch nur zu spät  Die Kinder sind trotzden begeistert das sieht man  Aber das Kasino fand ich klasse  hier habe ich manchen Dollar gewonnen und dann wieder verloren  Alles Allem eine gute Übernachtungsmöglichkeit aber wer es etwas gediegener mag dem würde ich eine andere Hotelklasse empfehlen     Thilo W  Finger Video link http de youtube com watch?v=ebGDO8TCvQg <EOR> Was amazed see literally fully equipped circus middle hotel elephants all  <EOR> My hubby ate first day Vegas breakfast  two passes due MyVegas comp   few minutes breakfast officially over pay 2 16 cover extra would charged lunch rate   ate sustenance but literally everything terrible except soft drinks   Waitstaff pleasant but if coming back Vegas avoid plague   know happens cheaper buffet options strip but pay little extra actually enjoy eating   husband didn't even feel worth 2 16 paid meal   Said would've better off going McDonald's right next door  Kind agree  <EOR> We lunch there  Avoid all cost  Spend couple more bucks eat other hotels  worse Hometown buffet  <EOR> Wir waren dieses Jahr zum zweiten Mal Vegas Zwischenstopp auf RV Rundfahrten RV = Recreational Vehicle auf Hochdeutsch Wohnmobil   Dort bietet sich für RVers der KOA Circus Circus Kampground an     man von dort auf den Strip so wird landläufig der Las Vegas Boulevard genannt und wer das Las Vegas nicht muss man jedes mal durch das Hotel Circus Circus ziehen es gibt keinen anderen vernünftigen Weg     man dort zwangsläufig zu sehen bekommt fällt im Vergleich zu all den anderen Glamour Hotels am Strip völlig ab Ziemlich verplüscht angestaubt im Vergleich billig  Entsprechend wirkt auch das meiste Publikum low budget tourists  Aber sicherlich kann man zum Übernachten hier Geld sparen gegenüber den wirklichen Topp Strip Adressen  Der Casino Bereich ja auch durch den muss man gehen das ist überall gewollt ist schriller bunter und lauter als vergleichbare andere  Wenn schon gambeln dann empfehle ich wegen des Spaßfaktors den Besuch der Casinos den besseren Hotels  Gewinnchancen oder besser die Verlustchancen sind überall eh gleich     Circus Circus liegt zusätzlich leider am Ende des Strips also fast eine Meile vom Zentrum des Geschehens  Drum herum derzeit viele Baustellen die ziemlich stören aber möglicherweise besseres für die Zukunft versprechen  <EOR> Uno de los grandes tiene una carpa de circo donde hacen espectaculo hay tambien maquinas tragaperra que de premio dan peluches <EOR> It's ok families  hotel old fashoned but cheap  Also takes long time walk other hotels strip New York New York Bellagio etc  The swimming pool area beautiful but ok just swimming  <EOR> Well surprised fresh food was  cheese omlette delicious pancakes corn beef hash good   Hungover? spot be  Menudo fire!! However expect multiple servings because only provide 1 cup bowls  best menudo long time  <EOR> Le Circus Circus est des plus vieux hôtels du Strip  Le check in est très impressionnant se croirait dans une gare ! Il faut dire que l'hôtel compte plus de 3 000 chambres  Notre chambre était dans la West Tower rénovée récemment assez grande avec deux lits Queen size et une décoration très    américaine  En revanche l'insonorisation est médiocre     L'hôtel est situé au nord du strip mais l'arrêt du bus deuce qui circule sur le boulevard est juste en face  Sachant que de toute façon vous marcherez beaucoup à Las Vegas la localisation n'est pas un souci     Le buffet All eat coûte 15 $ mais il faut aimer manger gras     Le principal avantage de l'hôtel réside dans son faible prix car sinon il est beaucoup moins confortable que les grands hôtels récents  <EOR> Not best buffet ever  day arrived circus buffet  because staying circus Circus  thought would decent considering $30 person during dinner  aren't really any desserts other buffets much eat  kids only ate corn dogs because much else  staff pretty friendly but food greatest  Probably won't coming back eat anytime soon  <EOR> My girlfriend ate tuna sushi made sick literally while still eating   top off 24 hours later feel might caught flu   Didn't realize terrible ratings place otherwise would never went  <EOR> I tried buffet dinner day arrived Vegas  terrible price     and used Vegas points buy 1 1    Even still feel price much quality food  gave benefit doubt tried buffet breakfast  little better dinner IF ate eggs personalized omelet station would perfect my mom said best   also used Vegas points buy 1 1  tried breakfast dinner done  Nothing tasty really plain simple type girl  would recommend spend your money points buffet  Try somewhere else save yourself headache your money because McDonald's breakfast better cheaper     I gave 1 star if could would 0  <EOR> WORST buffet ever   Hopefully just visit something day but everything bad   Well soda good   actually tasted soda   Chinese style food cold  guy carving meat looked annoyed seem now want bothered   Mexican style food cold  Mashed potatoes cold   Green beans cold  picture   seriously should through McDonald's drive through family four   never come again  <EOR> Too many other buffets Vegas better food same price  Food horrible however left unsatisfied  staff very nice cordial but food  <EOR> Wir waren zur Hochzeitsreise im Circus Circus  Kleiner Tipp der Rezeption das Zauberwort honeymooners wispern    Für uns gabe es wohl daraufhin ein wirklich beeindruckendes Zimmer mit Kingsize Bett und Marmor Bad     Das Hauseigene 24 7 Cirus Show Dauerfernsehen ist ehrlich gesagt total krank Naja das Thema des Hotel soll eben ins TV transportiert werden     Wie auch immer beeindruckend war das Hotel allemal  Das Casino kam mir kleiner als anderen Casinos vor  Das fand ich garnicht schlecht  Am meisten Spass hatte ich mit den 2cent Automaten da rappelten die chips ohne ende und am abreisetag wurde ich die alle garnicht los    Die vielen kleinen Bars und Speiselokale bieten eine riesen Auswahl Food     Der Vergnügunspark unter der rosa Kuppel mit der schnellsten achterbahn unter einer Kuppel beeindruckte mich sehr     Rund um ein tolles Hotel das ich jedem empfehlen kann  Die Preise sprechen für sich und sind Las Vegas typisch günstig  <EOR> For price great experience family if around Las Vegas area  desert amazing clams good all around worth price  <EOR> It's several years since last visit Sin City last time remembered Buffet Circus Circus great deal good food decided try again   Man wrong   worst food EVER   couldn't believe serve kind food  felt bad spent $12 95 place good thing didn't $20 all day buffet   The fried chicken hard yesterday's left over  Even desserts does taste good   roast beef rubbery   My advice    avoid place all cost!! <EOR> I wish could give place negative stars   starving liking breakfast decided try $15 99 per person    thought buffet breakfast bad could be?

In den untersten Etagen befinden sich das Casino und ne Menge Automaten  Ebenso die versprochene Achterbahn und Co  für 26 Dollar p P  Für uns war es ausreichend da wir nur 3 Nächte da waren  Sicher ist das Bellagio besser aber der Preis war für uns entscheidend  <EOR> i stayed 2006 few nights wonderful! rooms clean well decorated  all staff met very friendly helpful  i love idea having mini theme park inside hotel which huge amount fun all family really cheap prices hard days shopping looking around casinos spent ages returning hotel just playing around arcade games  it very nice restaurants inside very good value     all all its fun hotel especially kids thats clean safe barrel fun! <EOR> Pretty horrible food  Dessert selection ok however but worth price paid  Lucky $20 food voucher would asked refund  <EOR> I wish could give review 2 5 stars but 2 best could do   think may better buffets strip same price   Breakfast $10 99 Lunch $15 99   But wasn't terrible go  <EOR> Never life something this!!!
