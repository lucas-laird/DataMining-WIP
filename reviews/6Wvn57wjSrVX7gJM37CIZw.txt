3 Food = WAY overpriced WAY underwhelming  and gotten much tastier fresher more interesting flavorful sandwich Subway  Yeah said it  worst sandwich ever mind but charging over $15 combo w chips drink highway f'n robbery  I'd gladly pay much amazing knock my panties off sandwich but crap they've shoved together  Some menu items sounded pretty tasty but all ended being letdown I 3 other people all something different able sample 4 sandwiches    In summary Don't waste your time your money your taste buds  If find yourself MGM need quick snack you're much better off ordering overpriced underwhelming sandwiches Starbucks which compared 'wichcraft's actually end being hell great bargain   <EOR> I've placed bookmarked while  Reviews seemed mixed wasn't factor  think great option something fast fresh MGM  little pricey? sure find more affordable eats but when don't feel venturing outside MGM your choices bit limited  picked grilled gruyere caramelized onion  Thought terrific wanted try other sandwiches but never chance back there  <EOR> Provided you're trying food during daytime hours wichcraft probably disappoint you  fast reasonably good huge amount money  <EOR> Yes place pricey  $15 sandwich drink chips  MGM Las Vegas price expected  Also drunk people probably don't care time much food is  just want food    I Ham Cheese apple panini Rye  course loved it! love cheese bread especially melted ooey gooey cheese w bread  Throw some meat am happy girl  bite friend's chicken pesto roasted tomato panini am quoting orgasm mouth    Just because am tempted buy own panini press  afraid because may overboard w cheesyness everyday but am thinking it    I give 4 stars because loved panini hope too! = <EOR> since staying mgm signature weekend really didnt many options food close hotel    so long walk mgm hotel since 'witchcraft first restaurant saw opted just eat here  other food court fast food options looking quick affordable dinner  breakfast steak egg sandwich served all day probably most expensive sandwich ever life haha   2 sandwiches + $5 side salad  + $3 dasani water close $30  just glad since order counter pick your food kind place didnt tip extra haha  sandwiches good but great price  didnt think food anything spectacular although did think balsamic vinaigrette dressing salad pretty tasty  <EOR> Went weekend  most boring over priced panini ever Life  subway  better of       <EOR> Been twice roast beef both times  vegetarian fiancee goat cheese cucumber sandwich loved them both  Add great chips designer sodas business  little bit pricey but when consider gourmet sandwiches bad    We love all things top chef added bonus  <EOR> Everything menu group ordered delicious    Fried eggs Whoever thought sandwich flavor ingredient combo genius  Definitely favorite but love blue cheese because very generous this  5 stars  Only bad thing portion small price  know Vegas but  reason excuse  know much $10 sandwich should like  <EOR>
