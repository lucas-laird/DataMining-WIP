Very happy <EOR> Basic touristy italian food here  thought maybe would better figuring price restaurant looked nice  Vegas ton know expect but threw loop   For appetizer fried zucchini onion rings  liked that  Interesting gave tartar sauce   My entree vodka sauce which bland  asked crushed red pepper gave black pepper   The diet coke bandaid taste it  odd   A plus people watching  <EOR> Stopped some breakfast go   ham egg cheese croissant   Really good!  Ladies behind counter weren't friendliest but quick service <EOR> Is used anymore  sit bar even though only couple more people service slow  taste region so  soup small thick  pasta OK chicken    I better without it  Overall good  <EOR> Took wife appetizers  Carpaccio thought really good  Thinly sliced raw beef shaved grana cheese capers and wild arugula drizzled lemon olive oil <EOR> Went family lunch 2 year old 2 teenagers wife myself    lunch salad   chicken tender salad prepared well   Two teenagers each pasta dish sauces quite good   Both fine portions small side   bread excellent   bakery abilities quite good   Olive oil fresh well   salmon bit over cooked   would consider uber fresh just okay   would expect bit more fresh   The toddler's pizza 20 bucks   guess since removed cheese became specialty pizza    service suited 15% tip but more   price over 100 bucks no alcohol no drinks   would think better value found elsewhere   Nothing bad but would back just meal when others excel? Nope   Overall     meh    <EOR> Decided eat because outdoor seating next New York New York's indoor stream  seated immediately around 9 00pm     Waiter warned bread basket would addictive but he wrong  olive bread tasted much olive guess don't olives  sesame roll kinda dry  Sourdough OK interior wasn't soft chewy hoping    I ordered promising sounding special pesto penne pasta sun dried tomatoes roasted pistachios  OK but amazingly so  $16 hoping something more pesto flavor    SO Cannelloni Con Pollo Large pasta tubes filled roasted chicken swiss chard ricotta pecorino parmesan cheese onions applewood smoked bacon baked wood fired oven bechamel topped sauteed champignon mushrooms marinara sauce  Sounds fancy doesn't it? Well just thin sheets pasta stuff wrapped it  egg roll but steamed rather fried  Maybe but couldn't really taste all swiss chard pecorino etc  wouldn't order again  <EOR> The food good  bread delicious but service opinion seriously lacked big time why they're getting 3 stars    Where begin    1  waiter seemed he rush  2  Took forever come back take orders  3  He just did seemed interested table  4  received bread olive oil but no balsamic vinegar  Hmmm  maybe confused  supposed ask vinegar?  5  Asked someone else if he could please grate some fresh parmesan he looked he wanted die    Besides thought food good  liked Minestrone soup vegetables delicious  ordered super good pizza prosciutto arugula freshly shaved pieces parmesan yum     Next time Vegas  going somewhere else  <EOR> There definitely better Italian restaurants strip cheaper prices  Also service good day just OK  should tell something  would advise  try somewhere else  Don't waste your time  Especially since can't remember food tasted  Yeah those places  <EOR> When walked hostess phone looked while starring her  2 minutes later she looked asked if want seated  being seated she back phone  She phone 30 minutes until manager walked up  Also while eating drunk citizen walked table waiter walked didn't tell leave alone hostess saw did nothing  Food terrible  could've made better Vegas hotel room  <EOR> Service great   bit time crunch wanted delicious meal before Cirque show   accommodated easily food arrived quickly   We split Conchiglie al Pollo which shell pasta served chicken   chicken fall off the bone tender far best part dish   skimped bit sun dried tomatoes broccoli if ask me     The cannoli great   dessert actually comes 2 cannoli perfect sharing <EOR> Service sucks ! Waited 10 min just order water   Waiter rude rushed us  <EOR> If three stars average give them only two  middle afternoon myself  30 minutes between sitting down bread then another 30 minutes until subpart appetizer arrived then another 30 until dinner came  Very limited beer choices cheesecake dessert insult true New York cheesecake  All waiters showed no urgency checked if things okay only once generally aloof  price HUNDREDS better choices Vegas  Even large chain better service better eats  <EOR> Amazing pasta friendly stuff nice relaxing atmosphere even though place really crowded  best best manager super extra ordinary host Giuliano reason visit place again  restaurant owner know better  Giorgos <EOR> Excellent food service!

Would hear again? Good question  Probably but if T Mobile arena concert again    worth consideration try another dish  <EOR> My mom didn't know chain when she sat down she would've selected someone else join others    overall 2 star experience  took forever coffee then refills  acceptable book when Vegas 3 hours sleep   The french toast fine nothing more nothing less  breakfast place     enjoyed lunch Denver location  <EOR> My first dinner Vegas pretty good   friends picked Italian place ended here   ordered Pennoni alla Vodka which delicious vodka cream sauce bits bacon! yum   entree $16 99 which rather expensive such dish   Though blame being Vegas where everything's marked up    suffered sticker shock entire time there   The bread did come balsamic vinegar olive oil dip however bread would much much better if remotely fresh baked even warm     Next time Vegas prob try different place Italian food  <EOR> I really wanted place  but meant be   My husband picky Italian eaters unfortunately Fettuccine Alla Friulana just almost forgettable redundant  Fradiavola pizza which ok However mixed drinks ordered saved experience nothing else   Oue waiter took order but hardly there  He brought mixed drinks quickly but husband asked water and if walked strip thirsty! did water until 15 minutes seated food came much later  <EOR> Our waiter Eric best  appreciate much!

Impressive! Other pasta dishes good well  <EOR> This Vegas plenty places spend your dollar fact should them    Not because food bad wasn't    Not because service bad also wasn't    It crowded loud  food slow wrong temperature    They did nothing wrong but also did nothing particularly well especially city where well earns three stars four requires excellent    Specifics The caprese salad without oil vinegar pizza completely lacking character  pink sauce tasted shame regret diavolo pizza?  Does no kitchen ask why doing taste recipes before added menu sure served matches intended flavor? <EOR> Nothing special here  Came breakfast menu options basically limited your standard items would find IHOP  Compared other food options available area Il Fornaio pricey breakfast considering only $5 away getting same food buffet  guess only good thing if sit outside restaurant overlook casino floor while eat  would hard justify eating unless getting dining credit NY NY  Even don't know  = many choices good food there  <EOR> If could give place less star would  never life sent food back until now food only worse that! ordered garlic stuffed leg lamb arrived looked old microwaved school lunch leftovers! meat flavorless boiled  beef  only hint lamb flavor but didn't taste garlic  dry rubbery well  served spinach obviously tossed plate right very small handful old fries  sent back called lasagna  dish even less edible  frozen foods cons more flavorful  Airline food food nursing home would preferable  Don't waste your time money shit hole! wouldn't feed trash hobo! <EOR> I tried place while visiting Las Vegas  most delicious pasta wine dessert ever  glass sangria Pennoni Alla Vodka added shrimp   personal pizzas hot fresh but $20 mine well try actual dish but  daughter wanted  definitely would recommend atmosphere  liked could enjoy passers enjoyed your meal  fun experience  Also when download app free dessert! tiramisu nice way end meal  <EOR> We most amazing server!!

Maybe just because crazy potatoes but few little bites plate wouldn't satisfied me   On plus side waiter pleasant complimentary bread olive oil vinegar nice touch  <EOR> I wasnt pumped having dress night trip Vegas but thats girls wanted order laid night agreed  end eating because only place food chicks eat  opted spaghetti meat sauce angel hair  chili type which surprised but absolutely delicious  price $40 2 people which think way under priced  wife super picky almost point obnoxious she raving it  wish hadnt washed hands while bread came rest party ate most it  delicious only ate plain  dont need dressed eat seen people look just came County fair same great service  If absolutely nit pick place find something wrong I'd say cigarette smoke casino if you're sitting outside restaurant  literally outside its just way its built its main part  wasnt even bad  recommend place entirely  followed show across street called Ka  next review  <EOR> The soup bland   Salmon prepared well but sides broccoli potatoes came plate looking old wilted   service very slow well  <EOR> We Wynn concierge recommended close restaurant Monte Carlo hotel where seeing show  huge disappointment! ambience Denny's attempt nice decor  Soup really bland  better Olive Garden!

I'll continue eat because food great waiters very nice ambiance fun   Unlike other Italian places Las Vegas dress casually comfortably fit right in     Note typically choose 'regular' menu items specials two reasons 1 Specials usually meat based  2 They're usually experimental which why they're main menu   Two trips ago did try special some angel hair pasta eggplant   pleased vegetarian option Vegas gamble anyway so    why not?  It truly delicious  They offer breakfast but really breakfast food   Vegas down eating pasta 8am but breakfast menu really breakfast   <EOR> I going see Zumantiy again Monday night decided give Il Fornaio try   glad did   I seated 5 PM reservation immediately   place almost empty should been   asked choice eating casino facing patio inside   chose inside   My server Carol soon came table bread EVOO balsamic vinegar   She poured some EVOO onto dish then asked if wanted any balsamic   Thank you!

Rome   Tip ask your sandwich pressed  If sure  ask them extra hot  noticed if don't outside very hot but inside still cold  serve really thick sandwiches   Both little shop restaurant service Italian  doesn't bother us  Real American's might do   Because prices Italian service coffee able give five stars  two sandwiches hot tea fresh orange juice paid almost $32  Even Vegas stiff   And excuse any grammar spelling mistakes  English fist language  if isn't bad enough Apple device keeps changing words into 'proper Dutch'  Yes you've guessed right first language  <EOR> Some things better others if choose right dish won't disappointed  American Italian food if Olive Garden place isn't you   Two appetizers knock your socks off Carpaccio Polipo Con Patate!

NEVER C rated restaurant  what's worse even tried hide menu board  Wow felt scammed    Il Fornaio once again disappointed me  never dragged any your other chains again even if means standing outside waiting friends finish food while stomach grumbles hunger  <EOR> This decent choice would consider middle road average restaurant  headed NYNY hotel search dinner  no clue where would end but knew would plenty choices  first place saw decided it    The bread delicious could tell olive oil decent quality  best ever but price point certainly worst  did ask cheese but brought over right away  every single restaurant Vegas slow water service  guess want people pass out?  The pollo al peperoncino sounded amazing all 3 ordered it  chicken marinated rosemary sage thyme crushed red pepper white wine Dijon mustard lemon  really good! chicken tender cooked perfectly    I'm sure pasta better just preference but knew needed protein lay off carbs! sauted spinach potatoes served dish bit let down    I felt prices better meals Vegas around  entrees $18 26 range  sub sandwiches food courts Vegas cost more that   The staff friendly seemed accommodate pretty quickly  just wish would step game water all hotels! know desert but dehydrated drunks running around! <EOR> My experience lunch Saturday  overall experience disappointing    For starters oil vinegar dip bread wasn't even good  love good olive oil balsamic but quality cheap tasted cheap  Maybe just chose less exciting meals but ravioli vodka pastas bland  just didn't taste good all  always order dessert decided break tradition time because disappointment great point  plenty restaurants town great wouldn't come again  <EOR> Went lark few days convention center looking some decent Italian maybe nice pizza   Ordered eggplant parmesan pizza split between two people   portions fine eggplant bad   pizza though nothing special all   fact slightly tricky eat since crust [a term use loosely here] neither foldable nor particularly firm   The table itself small waiter very slow forgetful   When pizza came guy sliced he knocked into glass spilled bit  combination tiny table clumsiness though factoring things happen impression   At end day place little bit more expensive really should atmosphere somewhat lacking but wasn't horrible perhaps might better experience larger table some different menu choices  <EOR> I'm usually fan Italian mega chains but tend exception Il Fornaio  don't completely mock Italian food Olive Garden example  fact food quite good  bread die for  But place whose name translates into the baker literally should good bread!
