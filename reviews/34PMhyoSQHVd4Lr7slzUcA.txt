Also being new location why does smell bad when walk smells bad chicken Very let down restaurant won't coming back  <EOR> Zaba's food generally good love little potatoes but Zaba's location poorly staffed people just plain unpleasant   Unfortunately location close office come occasion lunch   never ceases hassle deal ignorant staff   if you're going eat location prepared   rude food taste bad  <EOR> First time  shredded beef tacos salty could hardly eat them  clean fast service plus  Probably won't back  <EOR> Place dump   staff members rude discourteous always run meats potatoes what's point all options if never them?

Greeted big smile happy courteous staff made everything wanted order  The only thing ever fish tacos BEST VEGAS! they're great in house chipotle ranch sauce  Wife chicken tacos she rated them excellent  While didn't order beer because early appreciate offer future later in the day meal  Bonus those soda machines where any all varieties soft drink  Vanilla Diet Coke satisfies every time  The atmosphere cool modern most importantly clean  <EOR> BETTER CHIPOTLE EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY!   I used dedicated Chipotle addict  once ate Chipotle over 80 times single year yes kept track   But day decided try Zabas  never back Chipotle again   For those unfamiliar Zabas essentially does everything Chipotle does but better  your standard choices bowl burrito tacos usual  Where Zabas starts impress protein selection  Just Chipotle chicken steak barbacoa all prepared essentially same way Chipotle  But brace yourself because Zabas SHRIMP FISH! means shrimp tacos fish tacos specialty advertise surf turf steak shrimp burrito  phenomenal!  Another thing puts Zabas over top offer POTATOES! Both regular sweet potatoes added any dish  doesn't cost extra! may seem big deal but added starch texture really takes burrito bowl another level  If you're lucky enough them fresh fryer orgasmic    THE BEST THING ZABAS OFFER CILANTRO PESTO  OH F***ING GOD! greatest sauce ever anything ever  over exaggerating  would drink s**t gallon  If love cilantro lime you're doing yourself massive disservice ordering it  always ask extra zero regrets    Overall considering prices almost identical Chipotle once try Zabas see light become devout follower myself  would give them 10 starts Yelp if could  F***ING GOOD! yourself favor meal worth remembering today  Eat Zabas! <EOR> This place rarely busy   employees pleasant pretty fast bit fast feel kinda rushed   new chain need time deciding   Chipotle lover but since live closer spot stopping in   close comparison however vinaigrette dressing better very zesty!  only chicken bowl salad    need try other options   give them 4 stars enjoy food choice every time  <EOR> I came last week came highly recommended  ordered fish tacos only because says voted best Las Vegas terrible  fish described lightly breaded but fact fish stick  amazing fish stick but something generic pulled freezer   tasted anyway  order 3 barely ate one  also made stomach pretty upset rest day  won't  going back   The 2 stars instead 1 because costumer service good nothing exceptional but far terrible  friend weekly enjoys salad there's that  <EOR> Bowls smaller portions smaller  last bowl even 1 3 filled  Cheap  Original owners must sold out  <EOR> I excited try new location hearing good reviews chain overall but unfortunately staff's demeanor distracts any positives food may offer  2 ladies behind counter seemed irritated miserable life general  only practically mute unhelpful when said first time trying decide should neither smiled once said thank barely even looked whatever doing  First last time guess better off sticking Chipotle where appreciate customers  <EOR> Great food high protein low fat perfect flavor gym meal food good enough deal fake customer service employees look just don't want if u ask something added look uh no didn't <EOR> I always regret giving them business  staff rude impatient customers  feel want hurry quickly talking over also giving smallest portions  don't want there  so just never back! Dealing sarcastic condescending tones just worth it  <EOR> Tonight third time Zabas long night working craving steak burrito 3 times Ive walked because steak  Wtf  does even happen   McDonald's running burgers  should never matter  8pm  <EOR> This right across street where live basically just convenience   vegetarian offer decent tasting fajita veggies  However all generous portions  boyfriend big meat eater he always gets double steak chicken burrito which happy charge for  He always ask them add more which always seem super annoyed  queso which very yummy burrito which also happy charge for  last time ordered barely put any asked little more which granted scowl barely added more   end she charged  twice barely queso  All together veggie burrito double meat burrito large drink chips queso bill nearly $40  Ridiculously overpriced   Q'doba much better give better portion sizes  <EOR> Ive location time two before food good most time  However today only 2 person line placing order lunch slow service Martha extremely mean rude plain disrespectful definitely think really hard before ever returning location  Plus did f few different items wanted time  Think really hard before going location  <EOR> I'm huge Zaba's fan eat least once week  star doesn't reflect rate Zaba's whole  However location garbage!
