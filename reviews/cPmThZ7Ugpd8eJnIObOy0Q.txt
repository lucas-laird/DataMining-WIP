Quick pay back way    The food packed very well everything nice fresh hot course bread scrumptious dipped dressing! Truly great experience! <EOR> I arrived today realized customer service ultimately horrid  When first came told would only take 20 minutes    watched every party arrived served before us  briefly considered defenestration solution  ended waiting hour  daughter brought two friends along  informed waiter ordered kids meals kiosk but waiter kept asking if sent when clearly did  time when salad bread arrived waiter promised bring plates never did  bread doused oil much couldn't bear eat bread  When food arrived switched sides  daughter ordered broccoli but served grapes instead  Overall customer service made family sans husband livid  shall never torture myself coming back here  <EOR> Ok food tasted good   impressed lunch portion size   tiny $12 95 rip off   service ok   Felt server just wanted there   ordered extra salad she made feel putting out   She brought check while still eating she sat down she offered dessert   Don't plan going back worth pay  <EOR> Went Olive Garden yesterday celebrate birthday family  servers great especially party 15 people   The food good but only thing found odd salad bowls brought table only half full  salad bowl placed middle long table only half full compared other two bowls ends filled quite generously  Maybe need work consistency when filling bowls  didn't bother asking different bowl because rest table offered theirs when ran out   Other great birthday brunch Olive Garden Summerlin  <EOR> This pretty good Olive Garden but still Olive Garden  People don't ahead yourselves    This review Valentine's Day 2010  Olive Garden doesn't take reservations most Olive Gardens waited hour table rest Summerlin  took excuse some alcohol system   There three bartenders staff which enough when consider also mixing house  am understanding felt bartender gave service above beyond considering  did much care pom margarita but job done   Which basically say food  good but price could non chain Italian place better food better service   I've Olive Garden dozens times  We'll back because where parents eat good service food despite being mega church Olive Garden  But better choices neighborhood price  <EOR> Olive Garden used most favorite restaurant  Wednesday night wait two people 30 minutes   chose sit bar seated right away   nice part sitting bar two TVs mounted which playing NBA game  bad thing sit next strangers    Service started pretty well drinks salad breadsticks soup rather quickly  didn't meals until much later though  even tasted pasta reheated some parts fettuccine Alfredo already stiff soft  Additionally never received appetizer  ask if working receiving entrees  waiter stated he thought already received appetizer  decided cancel but he said since kitchen already started he would just take if off bill give go   While very nice gesture still didn't appreciate wait reheated pasta  Olive Garden just isn't good used especially regards food  don't know if because am more choosy eater now if food gotten worse  But didn't food poisoning service wasn't worst give three stars  <EOR> This favorite restaurant  Staff always polite  Food delicious  prices reasonable  wrong? <EOR> My friend came dinner kinda late 30 min before closing sat bar Kyle welcomed us! soup salad glass wine highly entertained  over hour never felt rushed!

Thanks god Haimanot sweet Happy because Co workers looked annoyed sing Happy Birthday Experience alright service excellent but food wasn't remembered If choose between Olive Garden Roma Deli that place real Italian pick heart Roma Deli  An entree average $18 Olive Garden!!! Not sure would come again unless am invited lol <EOR> Use online reservation helps cut wait time!   I am sad say final try Olive Garden  gone down hill slowly but surely  tried Centennial twice March 9 2018 Summerlin final goodbye   The customer service front 50 50  young asian girl just looked acted she did want there  nice young black man asked seat first  She rolled eyes didnt say word kept walking    should follow doing? Lol    The server came he alright rest night  He nice but tricked order all kinds sides  trick saying side alfredo sauce your breadsticks delicious come find later he charged $3 79 every time he brought out  Smh  Never again   The food great  excited neverending pasta special  Yup only did 1 bowl enough  didnt even finish pasta  pasta old mostly clumped turned color like old   barely any sauce each bowls  think short sauce just stingy  fill ourselves breadstick salad only thing well worth eat  Smh  Never again   So am very disappointed Olive Garden childhood favorites  But giving them chance 3 times  time try something else  <EOR> Went last night around 10 15 pm late dinner husband wanted take advantage free Veterans Day meal every year  First all felt rushed into ordering when told waiter need few more minutes he just walked away without saying word looking very annoyed  Once ordered Everytime would ask something feeling he annoyed such uncomfortable experience  did enjoy ourselves bit  Positive note food great! <EOR> Worst service ever encountered   Passive waiters terrible manager   2 kids tote would think could faster service!

Either way couple times seemed everyone way great dining experience   Food ehhh     same stuff but more more expensive over years   But location?  huge difference   Also noted Beard Knowledge Pawn Stars sighted extra bonus! <EOR> I'm such sucker certain chain restaurants because know consistently food   Olive Garden them   Especially when advertise new pasta dishes sauces never ending pasta bowl   never wrong going lunch all eat soup salad breadsticks $7 95   OG favorites salad breadsticks alfredo dipping sauce for breadsticks zuppa toscana chianti braised short ribs!  The only reason give four stars because location always clean consistent professional sketchy area   also believe location outdoor seating   Other bonus points location nestled other restaurants such BJ's Brewhouse Agave Islands Fine Burgers L L Hawaiian BBQ     The only downside location while servers staff always friendly helpful sometimes seem overworked sense servicing many tables can't keep up   really nothing complain because see staff definitely busy attending other tables all Olive Garden Ferraro's     Low behold Olive Garden great chain restaurant good food cheap prices! <EOR> I've come quite few times each time pretty good experience    I guess only complaint don't give anything complimentary your birthday  little surprised since chain restaurant  came brother's birthday told them birthday waitress said oh happy birthday!'  I'm glad learned dipping sauce trick elsewhere never location    The service always fast wait never long food usually good atmosphere peaceful  <EOR> Soup salad deal awesome but overall am big fan  Its cheap acceptable every level   Mediocre best me  I don't know don't but its food its fake job feels sterile fake Italian food      always enjoy food but feeling leaves with   sorry maybe its just me    Give try know people swear it    I swear always somewhere else  Its Mcdonald's its last stop under duress choose its just ok its food!

He looked annoyed frustrated confused   might being foreign but really don't think so   think all he cared high he could check     See problem ordering just little bit restaurant lot servers pissed if know  you're going do   Forget fact probably give EVEN BIGGER TIP if just help want   First he entered app order screen then started taking rest table's order pad   When tried clarify going having some boyfriend's salad he just looked blank eyes Well order endless soup salad  COME just told wanted appetizer just some salad side!  Why would order additional $7+ own salad just comes big bowl whole table anyway?!   rip off!
