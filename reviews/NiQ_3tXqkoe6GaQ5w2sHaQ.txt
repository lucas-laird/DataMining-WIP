If order cherry soda needs least real cherry it  shouldn't ask  When asked charge items happy hour manager states always charge but aren't supposed charge morning REALLY??? charge don't    whenever feel it  Then provided multiple receipts showing same exact items purchased days before happy hour no charges manager states well if its big deal ill take off     SERIOUS??? If its BIG deal? WOW    then saw survey receipt inside window  However when drinks reprinted receipt no survey attached  back request survey receipt  When asked manager if he specifically didn't give survey because situation he didn't answer  Just walked inside correct receipt    Once again    ANGIE only reason continue come every single morning  <EOR> Very quick friendly  Great happy hour prices  Try cherry limeade  Grill cheese little dry  <EOR> I ordered Master BLAST which ice cream gave shake time dug partially melted!
