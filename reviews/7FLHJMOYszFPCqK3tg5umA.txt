I normally don't leave review but just very very very unpleasant    so bad didn't even tip all   left big $0 left few comments back  receipt hoping change   seems lot high stars previous reviews which why gave place chance   but definitely recommend anyone come unless start having better service less sodium   Also any racial comments but time 95% customers non Asians maybe  why might know difference between authentic even good Thai food compared bad high sodium Thai food hope everyone BETTER experience friends had   way price actually more lesser portions other Thai restaurants!!!!!! Shaking head left!!! <EOR> My personal favorite Thai place Thai Style Noodle House Spring Mountain Fort Apache but thought since place close work Id come lunchtime    I definitely recommend place lunch specials go to place your hour breaks to go  usually same ladies working usually only 2 working time during lunch time really packed almost every table filled   give women thumbs service quick turnaround getting food order  coming many times waiters remember plates want order which plus shows care customers! sure which waiters other reviews speaking but never issue service    Their food good but best Thai food ever tasted  usually order Pad Thai Chicken Yellow Curry Spicy Basil Leaf Beef   However nice would continue come lunch breaks    If spicy sure ask chilies stock  Some more spicy others 10 won't same every time order careful! <EOR> Another Elite Emily Excursion usually weekly lunch date  time hankerin' Thai which course means favorite Thai meal whole entire universe    sweet pineapple fried rice!
