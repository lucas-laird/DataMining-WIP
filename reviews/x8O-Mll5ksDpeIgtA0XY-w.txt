Buffet @ Asia but different location way better place  would think food consistent within chain    Our waitress quite rude talking never smile  snow crab leg salted crab smaller other place   The place closed 10pm but start mop floor 9ish if asking leave place already  <EOR> This place absolutely disgusting! nothing good say would give negative 5 stars if could  don't know why Health Department doesn't shut them down  entrance outside enter building filthy  Magazines newspapers etc thrown all over ground  Cashier ONLY interested taking money answering none questions  She em em attitude  Around food bar areas filthy countertops floor spilled food  Most food even hot! Variety very minimal  heard Asian buffet NO Kung Pao Chicken? Then made mistake using restroom! mistake was! never ever seen many graffiti ridden walls mirrors door frames  mean tell owner cannot afford coat paint cover graffiti? Last thing server guys absolutely no people skills seemed bothered when asked refill  would never ever never ever never ever eat place AGAIN! Yuck! <EOR> We decided try place other day  actually located Eastern Avenue bit south Silverado Ranch Road  actually far Freddy's Steakburgers    The place fairly packed Sunday night  usually good sign   I don't know  just wasn't all impressed  quite selection food there  much more variety expecting  quality food just so so best   The skewers far favorite item here  meat nice juicy almost falling off stick  tore thru share those things! Mongolian Beef station unmanned really didn't try out    They planty your standard Asian staples liek fried rice chow mein orange chicken forth  also fresh fruits available  grabbed bunch strawberries grapes some honey dew boot     The tom yum sweet though  couldn't finish that   Tried frog legs first time  Tatsed very similar chicken really! just bit chewier lol sure put that!  The inside little dingy side some odd decor like disco ball   guess rent part space parties  lol don't know why someone would want rent space     but okay   whatever floats your boat   For price paid just wasn't overly impressed  Much food seemed rather bland  may back day because friend seemed but don't see myself going way come back    3 stars <EOR> When you're budget looking buffet please some picky Vietnamese women place made all pretty happy!
