I  restaurant withing 5 minutes 10 past 12 pretty busy glad placed order over phone  drove back office opened box goodness  pupusas looked perfect tasted heavenly! did include curtido cabbage carrots oregano vinegar salsa  lot places tend curtido bit overpowering salsa watery but here  Both equally perfect! back try platanos yuca frita  <EOR> My opinion nice place where enjoy food authentic Salvadoran pupusas rich family atmosphere  affordable <EOR> I sure hope speak Spanish when place!

Luckily fat kid know spanish words food able pork n cheese pupusas   pretty good   want try some other stuff menu   I guess it'll russian roulette    er salvadorean roulette? since isnt actual menu   just pics 6 things no explanation what's it! <EOR> Everybody should try pupusa least once life!  best describe one?  Well think fat tortilla filled stuffing?  should give mental image your head   Generally order them Las Pupusas north side town but when heard Amanecer to wake ongoing quest try every restaurant lunch downtown figured no brainer I'd come pupusas boy did right choice!  This rather small place atmosphere doesn't really stand out   asked type pupusas standards cheese beans chicharron pork revuelto mixed your choice    cheese cheese chicharron mix   also ordered horchata drink although completely different Mexican horchata would typically find say Cardenas   some may better since rich     The pupusas themselves delicious just sure put cabbage tomato sauce top definitely add flavor like taco!    Also two pupusas good enough size meal   place feels tastes authentic  always huge plus   talked staff Spanish but seem fine regards English well   future may try other menu items but really when pupusa available why would you?  Oh yeah $0 99 pupusas Tuesdays! <EOR> For win! wondering aimlessly might say general direction downtown strip when hungry something other $5 99 prime rib special found Amanecer Salvadoreno   I never Salvadorian food  Clearly mistake part because everything Amanecer Salvadoreno amazing   Salty pulled pork eggs fried plantains pupusa fried corn things all washed down tasty Salvadorian soda?
