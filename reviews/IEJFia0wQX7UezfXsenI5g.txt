She said because other servers just serve much! she said attitude    Well guess never coming back ever again cause if going serve little portion its worth it  it's more worth cook yourself   and nobody give nasty attitude     I recommend anymore! <EOR> I waited 2 3 minutes napkins line  absurd because couple people cut still condiments  other hand waiting respectfully still weren't able comply requests  pompano good but really didn't barbecue  squid ball less average compared ones tasted past  <EOR> You find Grill City Pinoy Street Food inside Seafood City Supermarket  near check few selection self serve Filipino skewered items Banana Cue Turon Pork Isaw Butchi Squid Balls Fish Balls Lobster Balls Fish Kikiam Qwek Qwek Sweet Corn Balut  If you're time crunch need quick bite area surely something available    I chose few tasty favorites Banana Cue Turon Butchi  Banana Cue more popular Filipino snack skewered deep fried plantain caramalize brown sugar  taste best when eaten fresh hot  Turon fried banana lumpia jackfruit coated brown sugar giving crispy sweetness  amaze turon long challenging fit inside small take box    Butchi actually favorite fun treat eat  made sweet rice flour filled sweetened red beans shape into ball  coated sesame seeds then deep fried  only downside butchi taste sitting awhile  Next time ask if fresh batch    Overall think Pinoy Street Food nice addition Grill City  self serve option but am hoping add little more variety fresh hot grill items station  <EOR> Grill City looks amazing! Most items grilled instead deep fried ranging meat seafood  extensive selection value meals value packs family meals  Prices value meals bit higher normal    I ordered selection value meal menu  BBQ chicken value meal which comes 1 BBQ chicken skewer rice side salad $7 99  personally did BBQ chicken  wasn't fan marination used didn't care much salad  also prefer smaller cut meat when stick  BBQ meat should also cut equally same size eaten easily    Overall shabby place dine quick meal  would come back try other items  can't wait try bibingka  told best sellers sells quickly  <EOR> We ate pretty much whole weekend vegas   Reasonable prices example $11 4 sticks pork bbq   And delicious food sure  fave pork bbq liempo chicken bbq stick  bopis weird tho   maybe  why called grill city bopis city   So happy place now   honestly better Jollibee    I cannot wait come back  Idk new place but definitely busy whole time there   everyone loves place    It order food court type place there's much wait other when ordering   One nights grill broke   but handled pretty well opinion   btw   if live nearby  they some sort loyalty program called Suki card Can't wait come back! <EOR> I know common Filipino restaurants cafeteria style setting but sometimes cause disaster  particular restaurant total disaster  place new popular everyone going there  whole families waiting line employees unsure serve next entire experience disorganized  food expensive is could probably same thing home half price  nothing special menu  ordered chicken BBQ sticks throw them bag very messy  mom ordered mussels stingy only serving three while served other customers double amount  There's just no consistency said really nothing special just another mediocre Filipino fast food joint  won't going back  <EOR> Been Multiple times hasn't changed since last year much Customer Service concern   FOOD GREAT!  The reason am giving 2 Stars It's because SERVICE TERRIBLY AWFUL  All Staff rude but SOUR FACE people misconstrued Sour Face RUDENESS which healthy image new tourist when check Yelp review   The Manager wearing Black shirt very Friendly!

D sya nahihiyang mag smile ng mag smile nakaka hawa ung pag smile kahit imbyerna ka napapangiti ka sknya  Kabaligtaran sa dalawang empleyadong nabaggit ko   My review based upon service given period nothing personal but would see changes knowing Paying Customer    Note NEED STOP SIMANGOT FACE SOUR FACE nangangasim lang?

Saw earlier reviews Grill City when 1st opened thought would give few months before trying out   Hard say but still feel pain many past reviews!  Just smell passing Grill City intoxicating   smoke dead carcass flames!  All takes your olfactory senses going!  Grill City no joke when comes grilling!  grills filled MAX all kinds stuff skewers!    So into line go   boy line!  Biggest gripe   something single line control!  gets long tiresome wait quite while helped   Seems only 1 person taking orders day made line real real slow   Luckily wifey speaks Tagalog orders actually placed quickly once reached front line   If don't speak any Fiiipino prepared talk slowly!  most part ladies understand but just patient   believe time front line order your patience thin   Besides horrible lining especially busy weekend especially Catholic church   the food some charred goodness!  ordered Grill City 'Value Meals' 'Value Packs' section menu *Pork BBQ naked salad $6 99 *Chicken BBQ naked salad $6 99 *Grilled Golden Pompano 2 $13 00 Each meal comes generous super generous portion steamed white rice grilled meats came 'naked' salad which basically sautéed stir fry veggies   could also side soup additional entrée bit more money   Grill City damn delicious!  Meats lovely char them flame marinated well sticky sweet sauce Filipinos love   grilled pompano surprised would because being weirdo don't really eating whole fish   Ai sos!  kind sad Filipino am I?  Saying don't fish Filipino akin saying don't da lamb Greek   Damn near sacrilege!  But grilled pompano good!  stuffed some tomatoes lemon pepper seasoning when grilled gave nice smoky flavor  rather liked especially dipped suko vinegar !  white Jasmine rice!  Thankfully Grill City right need those carbs cut back fatty meat   Another tiny gripe seating arrangement   Good luck getting table busy Sunday!  hope sitting next Filipinos don't know!  But friendly anyway   Most tables seated close together might well communal eating   really don't mind just smile business   But private eaters beware!  Filipino old lady all your bizness asking if you're single she niece Philippines just right you  9 10 times don't believe her   Ha Ha Ha  Next time we'll probably try come time when less busy likely lunch rush but way before dinner   Maybe lines calmer then wait much shorter   #masarap <EOR> Nope looks amazing cause cooked front but family left unimpressed   We chicken kabobs pork lempo chicken wings palabok     All sub par    #shouldofwenttojolliebee <EOR> I never write reviews but people trippin all 1 star bs  tried many Filipino restaurants Vegas  Quality wise top notch me  Way better overrated Cafe De Cebu  Maybe enter line  Fug idk  confusion true  But all gotta catch attention  wouldn't hurt if ticket number system  Bruh food all point  example if come close closing hours no duh gon eat left overs  pricey   true too  careless breakfast  But lunch good  think people thinking entitled  thinking would Philippines  PI <EOR> This new restaurant Seafood City   line incredibly long seating over crowded but food good   really concept   Being new restaurant lot kinks still need work out   demand BBQ crazy   Long lines people complain long line but only grill certain speed   could order three more grills would still packed     Give them some time hopefully all dialed in   NEED good Filipino BBQ joint Las Vegas   Please  <EOR> Delicious food!

Chowking something eat eight them across them break    They more concerned breaks giving any level service  While standing line workers asked another help other blew off take break    There no organization  no teamwork  no passion job giving service  definitely passion ignoring customers breaks though    On top wife's lechon burnt rice mushy  Any Filipino sense pride work ethic would ashamed work even associated Grill City  Never again  <EOR> Horrible service horrible food!! Waited over 20 minutes order when there's only 3 people front me  Then when food expected wrap up  food tasted old chewy just plain gross!!
