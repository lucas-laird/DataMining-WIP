Totally going back!! <EOR> Wow  haven't years but back  very impressed selection quality price food  pepper steak grains prepared perfectly delicious  portion size just right but did starter salad  also recommend mango tea unsweetened  Enjoyed lunch return  <EOR> Very bad customer service server named Maria very uninvolved food selection process  She very bad persona herself when asked different selections varieties food she very nonchalant responses which she gave  would recommend particular location anyone  <EOR> My family came around 9 30 pm  very slow no reason waitress unattentive  happy hour asked margarita which $3  She said $3 50 agreed  When bill charged $4  asked price she basically said Oh price wrong bad   No offer fix adjust price just oh well! Horrible customer service!   Also back drink menu says if your waitress doesn't mention perfect margarita free s'more alcoholic beverage  asked different waitress she said she going ask waitress neither came back offered free drink  Smh!  I gave 2 stars because food good  <EOR> Well would give hole no stars  am trying figure why would item menu if don't know cook it  mean seriously screw fish chips  Oil running off batter peeled off batter only find wet uncooked fish  gross! Thankfully didn't pay it  never return another Applebee's again! <EOR> Extremely dissapointed  come location several occasions most part always good  However server Yiniva  U  needs some serious time management training  Seriously food shouldn't take hour arrive  Instead appetizers 40 minutes arrive ! Now work restaurant understand delays come arise but come its even busy all wait  She never once checked call through tablets aevery freaking time  only but she nerve ask if paid! If she would top she would realized paid long time before she even dropped check  Overall don't recommend instead salad bar inside Smiths   worth more unforgettable meal   didn't eat dinners  Thanks  <EOR> I've never Applebee's always saw them around  try avoid chain restaurants whole but meet group night  Surprisingly food good  quesadilla burger which different  but tasty  also tried artichoke dip deep fried batter coated green bans which loved! others also enjoyed food  Also waitress very friendly  <EOR> I'm disappointed place  family restaurant since opened  waiting order 18 mins tried waiters attention every time he passed  Finally came table 6 08 mother said would order happy hour menu  waiter older gentleman aged  50 60 turned mother blatantly told No  passed 6 o clock if don't speak manager  kidding me!?? terrible customer service!!! sorry you're past time even if waiting 18 mins! manager came over basically calling liar haven't long   I even showed time texted mother she right around corner 5 45!! Disgusted!!! Manager told no first said maybe manually it   worked Applebee's before coming decades treated could give shit customers beyond me    worry no problem driving 20 mins way treated respect  fact saving money happy hour what's big deal just pay full price?? fact your customers pay your bills  notice when server  having bad day but still try give them benefit doubt but treat mother disgusting  Chao Applebee's Nellie Stewart! don't deserve any stars point but yelp least pick one   <EOR> My steak came bit over cooked but never complaint    server Sarah seen wasn't really touching meat she knew wasn't happy she addressed manager named harry    fixed it!!!
