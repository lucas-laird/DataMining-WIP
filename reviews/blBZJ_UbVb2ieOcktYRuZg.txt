<EOR> I've several locations can't fault taste burgers  number 1 favorite burger place Vegas unless want more gourmet uniqueness which case recommend bachi   eat regular basis portions generous if think overpriced reason it  Just love it  Can't fault them  now want burger <EOR> My College Instructor took classmates eat clinicals suggested eat since we're big group   rarely eat Smashburger but glad chose eat here  service fast friendly  Staff always consistent checking see if needed anything table   I Triple Double Burger 3 cheese 2 beef patties equipped typical lettuce tomato pickle ketchup egg made bun  special only $4 which why because felt pretty conservative since instructor bought me  regret going all signature burgers smash fries shake    What menu option choose beef patty turkey patty crispy chicken patty even vegetarian bean patty  also build own burger additional toppings    I gave place 4 5 stars because burger super greasy kept running down arm  cover napkins drain oils bite into burger  only salad much spinach enough toppings order  <EOR> The service wonderful came checked often  food very good fried pickles appetizer buffalo ranch chicken sandwich burger  new payment system which really convenient easy use! <EOR> First time Smashburger  Liked variety menu  veggie frites very good  Something different  bbq cheddar burger nothing special particularly meat patty  much better  higher price point would expect Smashburger better  not  Front counter service good  Watching cook take off hat run hand through hair other cook wiped mouth hand  use gloves pretty disgusting  <EOR> Great burger n fries!
