Waiter Chan very kindness handsome! He  told don't know food which food favorite food! <EOR> 2 stars because liked remodeling   Stereotypically Korean restaurants don't best rep but incident bit unique post   Walking Saturday evening busy seated center community table  When party 4 came separate tables   which confusing because thought community table? could just anticipated another table coming moved table before sat down just using common sense    Also instead communicating soups delay wary ordering it   just never came out  only reason dine Korean restaurants really soup why else? but rather leave without sit minute longer underwhelming payoff  Reminding kitchen thing but communicate guests promptly    For Korean food just hobak hwaro magal djk e jo  If you're hanging plaza just skip Korean altogether district 1 oxtail soup chada Thai curry hachi Japanese tapas sashimi   <EOR> Great wings great service awesome atmosphere!    The parking bit packed but thats expected since such great restaurants plaza  Tried original supreme soy garlic wings  All flavors great  <EOR> THIS REVIEW CUSTOMER SERVICE   Honestly hurts write this  coming Q Bistro 3 years love food   This review purely staff customer service which normally good   My boyfriend came busy  fine  offered middle table but huge table didn't feel right taking big enough 8 people  said would wait smaller table booth  So waited 20 min waitresses asked if wanted booth table  said preferably want booth but if small table all  fine too   A party leaves booth started cleaning it  boyfriend started getting ready move over booth but instead giant group people ALREADY SEATED moved into booth  wtf?? waited 30 min already food but move them booth?? Another 10 min waiter says another booth being cleaned ready 2 min  Cool  waited AGAIN   Finally come seat start trying walk back now clean booth said no we're going seated small corner table   Again wtf? asked booth if available small table if wasn't already told getting booth  said same waiter thought getting booth? Only completely ignored  And when say completely ignored took another 10 min even take order    The food only reason give 2 stars most  food 5 star but customer service 1  disappointed idk if coming back awhile  <EOR> Their ttokbokki kimbop amazing!
