  The first time cigar lounge   good very comfortable great place few drinks cigars    several tvs plenty comfy chairs sofas there   four exhaust fans clear smoke very well   However cigar selection great   problem cigar shop same area shopping center     On second visit cigar room again but also spent some time patio   service great!  some appetizers tasty fresh   Misting system fresh guac great patio set up   Also date really liked sangria  June 2011 review while still called Hotel California  I back number times admittedly spend most time cigar lounge   say staff very friendly each time there    Grab drink light stick enjoy  <EOR> I would love able give Baja California better rating three stars but can't     What's like?  lot turns out   site former Hannah's followed seafood joint brief moment time place spacious beautiful   patio fabulous though way cold use now   cigar lounge comfy chairs sofas tv powerful ventilation system all addicts don't freeze asses off aforementioned patio   best all restaurant turns into Latin nightclub Friday Saturday nights live band large dance floor   Unfortunately Friday night Latin band would play 20 minutes then take hour break   We seated immediately attended server trainee but regular waiter him   menu touted house made Sangria secret ingredients decided that   Even though waiter affirmed yes did liquor added turned taste perfectly ordinary no better what's Yago bottle   also ordered without ice half glass   Much worse though menu combined food drink PRINTED regular menu bold letters proclaimed Two Drinks anytime   card table special promo   chalkboard special   Just regular everyday policy   restaurant com certificate when bill dismayed see charged four drinks instead two   manager adamant unyielding reading certificate valid any other promos   BUT PROMO!!  she wouldn't budge   But she did offer bring Tres Leches dessert which didn't really want need   More later   Some things really strange foodwise   First Queso Fundido appetizer   spent lot time Mexico hallmark dish spicy chorizo blended melted cheese   restaurant chorizo listed $2 50 upcharge   Queso Fundido without chorizo why just default raise price?  There choice soup salad main courses   We're both nuts Tortilla Soup opted that   very thin broth but tasted very good except chicken pieces which swear came same Costco chicken I'd put salads home night before   chef passing  swore fresh chicken   You'll judge   I ordered Shrimp Fajitas  when really turned Planet Jupiter   sizzling shrimp came standard platter surprisingly large amount shrimp surrounded usual pepper onion suspects   But where pico de gallo sour cream any other accompaniments always come fajitas bit guacamole Oh don't serve fajitas way but bring those things  Most incredibly tortillas 4 babies   shrimp no peppers onions anything couldn't even fold over!  exclamations waiter bringing burrito sized monster tortillas way big   just don't it   shrimp though plentiful tasted bit weird overcooked   Hubby ordered Pollo Red Mole which unfamiliar given taste   just usual brown mole but much thinner   He some rice along but no beans no garnish   He did chicken though   Meanwhile restaurant gotten significantly more crowded trainee nowhere found   When last able flag down waiter who'd training he explained guy's first day he sent home because he exhausted   But made service very slow because waiter all over place doing all   He sure did stay cheerful though props that   Finally Tres Leches okay but nothing special   wasn't soaked enough found little bitter   Again hubby liked but he's lot easier please!
