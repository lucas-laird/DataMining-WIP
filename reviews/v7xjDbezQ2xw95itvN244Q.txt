Xk las meseras andavan muy ocupadas de coquetas   depues de 10 mins nos atendieron! LA comida estava mas oh menos no creo regresar <EOR> Good food but ridiculous charge chips if im expending $90 dollars check table 2 order 2 ceviches caseros 5 beers 6 oisters preparados charge chips!!! Jezzz ever again just feels unfair cause chips come ceviches right well people careful read your check before pay cause try charge seat too  <EOR> We wanted some real food bar food local Vegas friend recommended place let tell delicious! Excellent service Quick Clean Delicious   We enjoyed El diamante  make sure try Michelada's Tostadas Mixta <EOR> Mexican seafood but very authentic   tried variety places probably lowest ranked mixed cocktail all seafood goodies lacked lot lime salt flavor ask extra  brought chips start also apps meals some kinda stale   gobernador shrimp tacos terrible double tortilla fried just made outer tortilla crispy while inside soggy rice good though   good portion sizes both overly expensive   Waitress came only grab order didn't see till needed check   <EOR> I search high low good mariscos seafood people aren't Spanish savvy   Competition tough side town but El Diamante very popular spot   3 stars because don't offer anything them stand out   in oopinion    FOOD app started off some ceviche best tasting but seafood tasted okay   langostines boy delicious could taste garlic citrus flavors each bite  Also some asada tacos meat dry only ate one  Loved mangochelada!  CUSTOMER SERVICE Staff very friendly prompt  Great service    ATMOSPHERE Very nice tropical ambiance love live music singer customers singing along him  Parking shouldn't issue but tough during busy hours    Would back?

Dayana awesome waitress  Burritos de camaron good also ceviche casero!! <EOR> One weekend ago celebrated dad's birthday with all family wore 18 everyone enjoy food my brother came Cali he impressed food la Banda   great job everyone restaurant keep great job  <EOR> Worst service ever! Let clarify something am Mexican know Mexican food  Having said came dinner ordered Mix Seafood Tostadas  did get? Tostadas no seafood full fake imitation crab  brought attention manager stated its tostadas here  Really? Maybe having bad day but even deserve bad review  <EOR> Que porqueria de comida  No tiene nada de savor toda desabrida  Y los precios ni digamos  La verdad no bale la pena  mi no importatia pagar 25 00 por un plato de comida pero que balga la pena  Una desepcion total!!!! Y claro que no recomendaria este lugar  <EOR> Went lunch   No lunch specials   Device so so    shrimp cocktail horrible   No flavor   Shrimp deveined tasted old   music blasting liking servers customers   lemon fish good   would fire cook focus customers   much better around area  <EOR> I came family 32 us ! Despite amount people service great  point attentive  weren't able split check but nice enough allow pay each family's portion individually  <EOR> Delicious food   friend actually waiting Las Islitas but because fight weekend Mexican Independance Day couldn't hold appetite any longer   Someone mentioned El Diamante figured would try place out   called see if busy which said but said would set table two   place busy Las Islitas but good us   mariachi bands well   Now if used mariachi bands playing while eat might want bring earplugs   saying bad but REALLY loud   place intimate conversations setting eat drink enjoy mariachi band s      Food wise appetizer oyster topped ceviche omg tasty   seafood dishes cannot wrong   actually beef dish mix little main dish but can't recall exactly called   Its really long name started Z   haha hope helps but yum   serve 4 tortillas   2 Cheese other beans   delicious spicy emphasize SPICY   highly recommend     My friend spoke fluent Spanish did help lot   conversation staff easier     Their food yummy definitely return more   just would feel comfortable bringing Spanish speaking person LOL <EOR> Mal servicio y al pagar se quedaron con mi tarjeta y al reclamarla las personas se molestan la comida fría y sin sabor <EOR> Their ceviche Micheladas best Vegas   portion size huge could easily shared amongst 4 people   usually live band playing every time come here   guacamole different others because add cotija cheese     The only complaint place horrible service   take forever your order never follow food is   You're basically your own once order until ask them check  <EOR> They some really good drinks only purpose see going here  Otherwise food esta toda desabrida tasteless customer service sucks! Maybe just waitress but keep getting manager's attention anything needed which also hassle  really disappointed such high expectations having Mangochelada  <EOR> No se merecen ni una estrella  Lastima que tienen puras viejas vale madre trabajando como meseras  Lo primero que se hace antes de sentar alguien en una mesa es LIMPIAR la mesa luego cuando se entregan los menus se le pregunta al cliente que gustan tomar? De cuando aca este pinche lugar se volvio Las Palmas? No estoy en contra de chirrines pero se pasan la verdad al dejar musiquillos traer bocinas  <EOR> Came Sunday evening pleasantly surprised live music really created fun atmosphere  server very nice patient he did forget 2 drinks but very respectful that  food hit miss  order octopus shrimp tostada plain tasteless dry  prepared oyster good great  friend did shrimp tacos liked micheladas  Overall ok experience  <EOR> I thought place pretty legit  give limes everything which love  portions really big but some most expensive Mexican food ever had  Instead typical tortilla chips served salsa give big tortilla rounds tostadas  didn't beans all but rest food amazing  Most menu Spanish but brief translations some items  received great service don't any complaints except prices insane  pretty sure nothing under $10 could find Mexican food anywhere else better price  Vegas don't know 100% but everywhere else ever traveled could find better prices  <EOR> UPDATED REVIEW 2018 El Diamante location since kid  Before el Diamante McDonald's 9 when changed  located Charleston boulder god sakes  I'd rather see local business before corporation  If you're looking elevated experience  Kick rocks head strip  place isn't faint heart  If hipsters looking service gtfoh  family owned restaurant staple neighborhood  Filipino always waiters speak little no English  stepped into world experience never let down  El Diamante keep up!!
