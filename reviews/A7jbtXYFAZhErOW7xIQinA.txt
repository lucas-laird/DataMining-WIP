This place strip mall but interior decoration nice would appropriate nice occasion   parking lot huge but very busy since shares many other businesses    I light lunch did Korean BBQ which may completely different story   yukkejang bibimbap sundubu    collectively ordered   I thought all above acceptable    if little bit standard   place called Mother's expected little better   panjan side dishes though plentiful decent nothing rave over either   This may little cheap say but think $12 95 much Yukkejang    unless mind blowing   Ditto sundubu bibimpap I think around $11 95    Maybe ingredients just cost more ship LV   In case interested BBQ know runs $25 $30 per meat order am sure meat would snuff   So far king Korean mind Kimichi Las Vegas Blvd    but then again much competition eh? <EOR> By far worst Korean food ever had The environment felt dirty meat smelt spoiled just good all  Very sketchy just horrible  <EOR> Our group found Korean BBQ place eating Pho Kim Long one best pho places Vegas      For party 4 group each paid $20 all eat menu     Pros Everything clean! Water served glasses plates all ceramic  Bathrooms also super clean  Meats looked really fresh   marinated beef delicious! Location good parking easy find   Cons Service SLOWWWWWWW   unbelievably slow    why deducting star   only couple tables filled restaurant when waitresses reminded SEVERAL times bill  waitresses little bit trouble English   little difficult communicating them   All all loved place super clean!  vegetables fresh meats fresh platings super nice!  Nothing served plastic bowls containers most Korean BBQ restaurants   Everything ceramic glass made feel eating more upscale Korean BBQ restaurant   Great place!  may come back again next time Vegas! <EOR> I don't want start review thinking bad thing but say food good Taste decent but service non existent  ordered soup took minute which ate all bunch did see server whatsoever all see dedicating herself table other just showing pictures puppy other customers  Never did stop check see doing  also asked chili powder chili sauce add soup which never came  Very disappointed service because food good <EOR> Super duper pricey Korean food isn't even good! Only because Vegas charge much  mean    common pancake $20 bucks? part free appetizer back LA!  The soup whatever too  No flavor wasn't good  If going pay much food might well nice buffet Vegas  <EOR> This best Las Vegas   IMHO   usually galbi bulgogi always marinate just right not salty just enough flavor   think best cook your table because then cook want   If haven't tried Sundubu must!  really soup person but hits spot  little spicy tofu order your choice meat I always beef seafood   throw egg cook its own when eat rice its perfect combination!  Oh man   I'm hungry now  <EOR> If chased outside because feel didn't give them enough tip then perfect place you  3$ tip 25$ total price food ate bad  Plus service horrible  playing hide seek food server  wouldn't recommend place anyone  <EOR> My favorite Korean place Vegas   Nice surroundings   Very clean   Excellent Pul Kogi Kalbi   back  <EOR> Wanted try new place thought place looked good  My boyfriend only ones 2 30pm   We never asked doing waters never filled   The service awkward bad   We awkward eye contact server give check    The food pretty good  spicy beef soup boyfriend kimchi stone bowl  kimchi bowl SUPER delicious   The prices seemed steep well over all food decent  Service sucks bit over priced  Try yourself guess  <EOR> Came mom because she raving place  usually don't mother's choice restaurants many reasons explain just proves another point  Walked saw there's sign health department shut down imminent health hazard Cockroach infestation  Two horrible reasons shut down place  never ate nor ever step foot establishment even if re opened  Don't lazy don't f*** other people's health expense making buck two  <EOR> This place terrible  dish low value but overprice service bad  won't recommend  it  What's more put 20% tips bill forced pay which fine because thought last time visited there  paid off bill which include 20% tips forced paid said haven't pay tips asked pay tips  omg never even restaurant this  THERE! <EOR> Is option give place 0 stars? ate kbbq part ordered 3 dishes  EXTREMELY expensive  dishes refillable side dishes tastes crap  don't even rice paper  only turned fans FIVE seconds every TEN minutes  service spotty charge 20% tip automatically regardless party size we 3 but forced tip removed when complained it   only good thing say place clean  AVOID place somewhere else your kbbq fill  <EOR> The food seems good but service wasn't expectations  ordered teriyaki Chicken soon walked Order old lady gave attitude  turned around walk away another waitress approached kindly asking if needed anything  asked chicken teriyaki expensive sorry $28 00  walked away  <EOR> I Las Vegas visit friend mine  Did want eat strip  wanted experience local flavor Las Vegas  friend recommended Korean food  Considering Korean food while sounded good    First thing notice restaurant empty  lunch crowd but before dinner crowd  Staff really friendly attentive  sat down right away  sitting down friend recommended cooking own food grill  thought would fun moved table grill    I am familiar Korean food let friend ordering us  Ended ordering some beef dish bunch sides never heard of  open trying anything day delicious  Kim Chi dish cucumbers liked it  Also potato dish thought good well  Also some bean sprouts  fresh crisp    Meat pretty big threw grill  Think grill only setting meat seemed take forever cook  Frustrated setting being hungry friend decides cut beef smaller could cook faster  Once beef cooked delicious  Nice tender great flavor    Best part friend thought use chopsticks correctly  Now feel fool when use them  Thought price little steep but live guess    I good time would definitely come back  Good food good atmosphere remember place place learned use chopsticks  <EOR> This second time eating restaurant  solid place Korean BBQ  Nice decor decent service good food    If you're looking best deal Korean BBQ   I would say Tofu Hut   If your looking best meat selection   I would say Honey Pig! honeycomb pork belly ridiculously good!   But solid experience   Mothers nice spot eat! <EOR> Went today mom friend  Thought food only delish but service excellent   brought extra order pancakes when noticed out   attentive asked everything thanked coming  noticed negative reviews but could only speak experience   ordered mackerel salmon bento boxes  which included Japche bean sprouts rice Kim chee fish cake pot stickers $15 ea  $11 before 3pm    plan return long food service remains point  <EOR> soondubu dol sot bap cant wrong  <EOR> We $22 AYCE decent  server problems understanding orders though tell few times  $22 only order first 2 items once  say Tofu Hut  <EOR> A really good place bit pricy but worth it  staff very friendly restaurant very clean  would definitely recommend place BBQ delicious along beef hot pot  <EOR> This probably favorite Korean Restaurant Las Vegas  Its very nice inside Friendly staff food always very good  careful wear however because leave smelling BBQ  Its fun cook tables but often leaves smelling possibly stained  But its worth it  <EOR> The food good    but service just abysmal  know through good bit water meal but hard fill water glass?  Just over all disapointment  <EOR> I don't even want give star   worst place planet   food absolutely garbage   Folks don't dine  Seriously! <EOR> This place located China Town Las Vegas  food taste no different regular Korean restaurant  paid $20 Korean Beef least expecting would full but dish small would order two more dish full   I also tried cooking ribs myself cost $30 only give two ribs size small candy bar   They force pay 20% tip poor services too  Overall place horrible only lure tourist in   If back own city San Francisco lunch would cost less $10 per person  family 4 spent $120 lunch would spent $30 home  price difference amount food give fair  Horrible mistake eat here  <EOR> The food ok service horrible    server walked away table mid sentence fiance placing order seat party walked in   She came back few minutes later oblivious just happened took order 2nd time   decided cook meat table pork chicken BBQ   whole mess cross contamination occurred using only 1 tongs both raw chicken pork then using same tongs transfer cooked food onto plates   should said something but didn't   Luckily neither fiance sick   eating waited longest time check    wanted see long took server notice long done eating come table   whole time she chatting co workers   finally flagged down asked check   think she sensed frustration because she came back gift hand cream  A present happy new year! she said   Nice gesture but definitely won't coming back    ever  <EOR> I lunch week ago  think food good but portions tiny  don't serve lunch weekends  four ordered three entrees  bill $80 lunch! service just sucked! scared ask something  Anyways don't think ever again  <EOR> Got off 12 hour shift    starving  Tofu Hut $14 deal 10 way pack decided Mothers korean BBQ $20  First time five years    Wow did service change  Sat down ordered 4 things menu    decided wanted more type meat said excuse please also beef brisket      She glares says only three meat choices time! Ok      thought all eat guess all choose  also skeptical then service plus being hungraaaay no joke  Couple minutes later half way through meal realized didn't even water    ask  Honestly never felt uncomfortable asking water more meat even though all eat  However asked pork ribs she brings big chunk pork  wtf thing  wait until she appeared finish other customers kindly tell sorry didn't want she walks back coworker she started talking korean attitude  finished water no refills nor everything ok    nada! Even end she asked finished!? didn't bring bill while she did other Korean customers  Even though AYCE never felt uncomfortable ask more nor while sitting there  Terrible service  going back  <EOR> Sadly Mother's gone downhill   First all raised prices significantly   you know those really subtle price change strips down side menu no doubt your mind paying more  all extra money they're now making you'd think could spring newly printed menu  mention raising prices bad pychological move economy    They no wine list could see only 2 Korean beers  ordered beer but waitress forgot   dove Kimchee sides tongues felt fire eaters chase down bring beer mitigate mouth heat  Lots apologies followed  late girls  My group ordered 4 beef combination plate 3 people $75  beef kinda gray measly  tasted fine once barbecued but high quality meat  Here's another tip if bringing raw meat table part dining experience sure meat looks really good cuz people going look it! The place open 24 hours ever craving beef 5 morning but all all think time explore some Korean restaurants elsewhere town  Perhaps some those mysterious places Commercial Center Sahara Maryland Parkway  <EOR> 3 place lunch  didn't know DAMN EXPENSIVE $35 person lunch  total came   $130 diffently worth it  didn't even meats served which mostly fatty meats   Try another Korean BBQ place place best Las Vegas anymore should worst Las Vegas    would decent if price $20 person   But $35 lunch $40 dinner buissnes soon <EOR> They limit menu eat all can  Which BULL SHIT!!

Probably since likely dozens other Korean restaurants worry 'what ifs'  food Chicago level though trust still factor restaurant need work bring back customers <EOR> So ate mediocre meal $41 charged $7 53 tip already applied bill  Yes service good but tip should voluntary forced  No where menu outside did mention pre applied tip your bill  <EOR> Pros All eat menu Clean great environment  Clean bathrooms Great service Seated right away  A variety small dishes  Cons One meats I don't remember which one personally thought bit salty  <EOR> So twice good food   We all eat BBQ lunch day dinner another I think dolsot bibimbap some soup while ago    Traditional Korean foods very yummy   Maybe little pricey side  no difference between lunch prices dinner prices     Service ok nothing glaringly wrong but nothing spectacular either     I wish could give half star ratings because I'd put 3 5 but rounded because food tasty  <EOR> Don't here   Even 50% off Yelp deal     My friends lunch because Yelp deal received $40 credit $20 charge   ordered three la carte items food bill totaling $35   tastiness food simply okay   Nothing spectacular   But where gets whack   friend ordered coke meal   settled food bill cashier waitress comes states drinks part deal   Instead just adding cost coke food bill friend dish extra $3 cash   only did gall charge coke separately but soda pop three bucks   Whaaat?

We came purchasing Yelp Deal weren't quite phased pricing  However think $29 kalbi tad expensive BBQ serving more generous usual  price would probably prevent coming back regularly  flavor good meat quality but didn't think reflected price    We excited see brown rice menu but didn't any  am sure if would normally it?  My husband did order eel he thought good value! Given smile face could imagine going back just that    As true highlight Korean meal did fall love banchan  didn't empty any bowls  happy see green salad though  Overall felt if banchan sweetened artificially Splenda perhaps  probably case but best way describe flavor  vegetables definitely fresh  simply didn't prefer overall taste tasty little sides    It worth try especially if purchase Yelp Deal but might recommend eel lovers if you're looking nice spot provide someone first taste Korean BBQ  <EOR> I called ask if still All eat just sure  lady answered phone said yes ahead made reservation 8 adults 3 kids   When ladies told didn't AYCE day because some convention she talking about  Then she added because told doing ahead let us  gave seclude d room because apparently them party big! she repeated twice before seated   5 adults wanted AYCE 2 didn't  When told them when really gave hard time  would any chance let wanted  said AYCE mind needed Premium selection which $35 person  Accdg  them can't pick deluxe 20+ person because      they started spiel convention again   and opened huge room just us   By time really getting irked  did want ruin evening just asked them give few minutes decide  wanted just another korean bbq place where know sure does AYCE o muss no fuss but others didn't want leave  just decided would all order la carte  did servers happy all  tool orders gurdgingly  came back said ordered many bowls soup should order some meat grill again because opened room tables grillers      When food arrived other lady telling eat food even when he didn't ask she started mixing him! I'm asian  don't come place because expect excellent customer service  But expect them feel appreciate business  inconvenience them us  doing huge favor because going let AYCE when really shouldn't have   I say food tasted good  Maybe even better but disappointed service could appreciate anything dinner all   I picked place because sister said good  sure hell am going back    Oh top all off screwed when charged credit cared  fixed yes but still much hassle  <EOR> Okay right now its Sunday morning good hour Ive driving around town trying find something decent eat lunch  craving Korean food going usual places realized Koreans don't open business Sunday  = Out last resort decided Mothers Grill located right heart main Chinatown plaza  Ive known place over 3 years now but never bothered trying because many people told very expensive  made decide dine big banner front saying tofu soup special  figured lunch time therefore price little bit more decent  know wrong   again   always   Upon walking needless say restaurant gorgeous  very spacious 3 different dining sections  clean paintings along walls fake plants throughout tables even candles against glass windows  also played old school hits such Rhythm Rain Fever  place almost looked aristocratic home late 50s where your grandma 10 helpers 4 butlers would cook serve dinner ball something  cozy elegant even fire place sections where dining  However right off bat could tell main goal attract more American customers tourist visiting Chinatown local Asians    As far menu food very expensive  talking cheapest thing around $15 ordered Korean BBQ  Even lunch specials typical tofu soup $10 95 bolgogi $15 combo $24   And supposed specials   I ordered seafood tofu soup  When came very disappointed  no mussels soup picture  came filled brim all seafood 1 shrimp 2 clams  dead serious  only good thing meal 4 side dishes gave which pretty decent amount  However still kimchi seaweed cabbage sweeten potatoes  price could easily gotten more different Korean restaurant  soup very bland did taste rich deep flavors all  opinion put way much tofu enough broth  couldn't even finish rice because much tofu rice would've made literally mushed  spicy level 1 even though told waitress extra spicy    I only assume because Mother's Grill located Chinatown which why store pricey  would recommend place eat even if special occasion  Unless want impress your guests looks more quality money problem   could ideal special occasions  But  really all you  Otherwise other Korean restaurants off Chinatown plaza would more ideal if eat regular basis  <EOR> First time here!!! Love it!! most fun!!! food amazing service impeccable!!! happy chose Mother's first Korean BBQ experience!!! <EOR> I tried Mother's first time eventhough spot Vegas Korean Garden BBQ House    I don't think ever paid much plate kalbi before $32 we probably would've better off going somewhere else doing all eat $17 person  meat super oily fatty  bf ordered rice cake dumpling soup luke warm broth tasted murky rice water   This place nothing excited about  Next time never cheat Korean bbq spot    lesson learned!

The menu pretty extensive most typical Korean dishes  ordered dolsot bibimbap $16   wasn't used agar perched top dish  weird avoided it  bibimbap served flat stone plate rather your typical stone bowl  good satisfied craving  soup I believe daikon it perfect rainy night   only thing disappointed lack banchan offered  kimchi bean sprouts cucumbers fish cakes but wish they'd offer more  Overall scrumptious meal bibimbap bomb   I just saw hours Friday Saturday 8am 5am! Yikes! sure know cater drunk masses! <EOR> Bibimbap awesome server amazing she even stirred bibimbap very attentive would eat more but portions reasonably big  Ambience quiet warm  <EOR> My ex coworker NorCal came visit wife decided meet grab some lunch   Since used Palace BBQ Buffet Sunnyvale CA at least once every two weeks 3 4 years before Santa Clara office moved San Mateo decided drive around Spring Mountain look another Kroean BBQ joint   first found course Mother's Korean BBQ since really hungry decided try account serves Korean BBQ looks nice   We ended order most expensive BBQ combo platter grill table   didn't all you can eat which major draw Palace Korean BBQ Buffet back home plus marinated various meats perfection only attained years if generations practice refinement but platter beef seafood looks decent except none marinated   thinking WTH!?  $100 something meats even marinated could done home 25% cost   Anyway initial expectation perceived value meal aside shrimps fresh beef nice marbling tasted good being seared grill   side dishes good selections when asked refills ones finished friendly Korean lady quick give more   Not sure if Korean Mother instincts kicking but also tried help cook food   mildly offended because am used doing all grilling whenever Korean BBQ friends coworkers didn't need wait staff unconsciously rush cooking all food ordered quickly possible   Plus started meal weren't rush restaurant being semi empty didn't feel table turnover issue   Anyway definitely better Korean BBQ Korean of course Taiwan course NorCal Korea Town Los Angeles   Price wise thought served really expensive   quality food good beef sliced thin expected   service friendly but also inadvertently rushed   place clean prime spot ChinaTown Plaza   Would come back?  Probably expensive BBQ although Kalbi supposedly best town   But also home quick stop Greenland Supermarket when don't feel making scratch   only 2 stars review since definitely way better food experience other Korean BBQ restaurants  <EOR> Make simple restaurant try rip customers off   $17 99 big banner hang outside restaurant but when no give any water anything beside REGULAR menu until ask guy brought All menu   Price? course different $22 95 $27 95 all eat   Me wife starving but serve everything slow grill never hot just dumped raw meat there   keep turn high heat grill but all servers when approached table turn down no reason   Third round ordered some pork belly pork ribs end served huge pork chop least 1 1 2 thick cut piece cook myself which always want cook myself but servers keep come bother said cooked us    next moment totally piss off old Korean waitress came said people waiting tables actually no one were cook whole piece can't cook little little mentioned time limit all    asked when started she didn't answer walk away moments later she came back said another 1 2 hr told tell all waitress stop approaching table let finish dinner     I asked least 5 times check but no give probably want wait until finish everything table if charged left over   bad ate all   groups other customers came before but even left behind us   My conclusion want pay full price eat half maximize profit   turned down fire customers spend more time cooking   If order more 2 rounds find excuses kick off   NEVER RESTAURANT AGAIN NEVER RECOMMAND ANYONE  <EOR> Decent local locale food so so service   came week binging Strip touristy restaurants definitely hit comfort food spot tummy   admit food best Korean food but would Las Vegas   None dishes bad but also none really stood mind being great either   dishes tried bul gi yuk ge jang kim chi jige   All just so so   Did taste better week eating Strip?
