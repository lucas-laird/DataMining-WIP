D <EOR> Food decent service extremely slow  sat table front kitchen watched food sit window   stop someone drink refills because original server only came once  I appreciate quick response management but may 5 tables total restaurant already food  <EOR> This Vegas weather good miss on  instead staying home dinner asked husband if could out  He said sure but where?  little bit scrolling through Yelp Bookmarks settled Venezuelan  driving down Rainbow Warm Springs opened big mouth said oh Crab Corner right there! which husband said oh could use crab pot! U turn   We right before dinner rush   sat down ordered water Pepsi started looking over menu when husband realized wasn't Creole crab pot style restaurant  Hence Maryland Crab signs all over restaurant  Although little bummed already seated decided give try glad did   #1 thing loved place 80s music  really brought back time  #2 lobster bisque amazing #3 soft shell crab pretty good #4 super large portion pasta under large grilled salmon  much don't think ate half it   The service great but little slow   As watched dishes come kitchen because seated right outside husband noticed some platters coming only rows crabs   check husband asked waitress since he didn't see menu  waitress pointed chalkboard behind where list crab sizes prices female versus male crabs  She explained those tables only ordered crabs  least expensive $4 small female crab while most expensive jumbo size male $12  Per waitress jumbo male size measures 7 inches  price crab size crab reasonably priced   Note If you're accustomed having just crab legs measurement referring body crab legs  dinner girlfriends where they've never shellfish its natural shell surprised when came out   Looking forward next visit  <EOR> The service incredible! cod basket which pretty standard but really don't fish  don't know if own sauces but cocktail sauce good  Seriously though EVERY time someone walked table would ask wasn't even table!

When finally table served  bartender she great! She checked several times during meal gave good service   The food good totally recommend crab cakes lobster bisque  boyfriend ordered Maryland grab soup which flavorless! truly place good bad same time! cannot mind!! <EOR> My wife wanting try restaurant some time  came Saturday early dinner 3 45p   Aside bar only two tables occupied  took couple minutes seated hostess trouble finding clean table  server quick take drink order however he told he check sure stuff mix drink  Which fine but he disappeared 10 minutes never confirmed whether choose different drink  watched flirt socialize different employees before he returned table drinks hand   After wait additional 10 minutes order taken  food came pretty quickly that  bacon wrapped scallops really tasty but only 4 scallops small side $14 bit overpriced  lobster bisque very well done    would preferred more lobster chunks instead slivers but grateful compared crab soup spouse got  wasn't any discernable piece crab found otherwise tasty veggie soup  Maybe just portions given    sure   We ordered garlic blue crab peel eat shrimp homemade potato salad onion rings  potato salad excellent! onion rings battered nicely but would much better if paired some kind cheese dipping sauce  When asked told only sauces available salad dressings which disappointing  shrimp tasty decently sized portioned price  rather disappointed crab  given 3 blue crabs smothered garlic sauce  Maybe blue crab small nature but actual meat inside crab mushy difficult extract shell  used eating snow dungeness king crab didn't really consider crab accurate reflection restaurant's abilities    As live North Las Vegas stopped place because area don't believe returning anytime soon  However if location opens closer would consider returning try other items menu  <EOR> Not sure why only 3 1 2 stars but place great  catfish po boy homemade chips  hard find good crabcake excellent here  friends also enjoyed meal  However service could much better more attentive  When seated Monday evening female host only brought two menues three people   kept having ask server refill drinks order more beer plus extra napkins etc     Hence server should asking us     They need good manager pays attention front much back solve problem  <EOR> Worst experience ever     little weary when showed see empty place but lured some great reviews Happy Hour oysters $1 each why not  Huge mistake  ordered couple other fried items tasteless    The guy Richard took orders brought food probably having bad day?  When he dropped off food he just left didn't check back until he brought check clear plates  Oh couldn't flag down he chatting someone other end room he would head buried phone front desk     So when finally chance catch attention way bathroom he carrying empty plates back kitchen asked why oysters shriveled dry no brine ALL    response? Oh fly fresh dry  pulled pics took horrible oysters he then somewhat looked he would say something fix issue BUT shock he blurred out why did tell before? Ugh!  Really?  fault didn't YOUR job served old lame dry oysters still blame saying something hope would fix scathing review?  Richard chance remedy bad situation  Instead he chose blame customer    STAY AWAY avoid place all cost! <EOR> Major letdown! When advertise crabs flown daily should them flown daily   Spent money cab ride strip ended having grilled cheese  Do trip Crab Corner happy choice all  Website VERY misleading! Poor choice  <EOR> I thought doing business favor waiting till restaurant mention saw groupon deal brunch  Instead buying through groupon having them 50% cut end   mentioned waiter  He told buy first through groupon wait 4 hours before use it  asked why because doesn't any sense  thats when he told Groupon just doesn't allow vouchers used right away       okay but thats true  whoever thinks its brilliant idea lie customers idiot  business myself am groupon merchant  know exactly works does require 4 hour wait use  doesn't even take person merchant know that  obviously setup force customer pay full price  Which really issue but way business shady lying people good way customers  wanted use groupon try food see regardless bad reviews if ill come back ill happy pay full price  understand business trying would prefer full paying customers but heres thing What's better? $30 bucks plus good tip especially compensate groupon $0 ? Because thats just lying  just probably won't give them another chance  could've chance customer made unreasonable now   didn't even chance try food  but looks reviews looks didn't miss out  Heres tip crab corner if just want full paying customers then suggest take down  campaign quit bull shitting   <EOR> The customer service terrible   mine daughter order all wrong when mentioned he attitude asked if wanted extra fried oysters told No ordered shrimp then he told since daughter ordered fried oysters just give mine he'll bring extra shrimp         WTF ????? mention waited 20min empty restaurant!!!   Let add still left young man $2 00 tip only bcz they're quick say never tip well but if your hospitality rude insulting then why should ANYONE TIP WELL?
