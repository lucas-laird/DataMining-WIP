Wicked Awesome Rice perhaps? Both chicken plates gobbled before anyone could discuss  they'd divided Fork Wars! beef which perfectly seasoned not OVERseasoned alllll common Mediterranean places    Everything tender perfectly cooked seriously can't say enough getting seasoning right   Finally place doesn't think Brian needs another cup salt him! late day going light lamb    Yes Lamb gamey but done right perfectly fresh gamey ate I eat most garbage disposal       After fulfilling disposal duties the lamb wasn't bad    just full lamb y flavor! came dessert Baklava $1 99    How good it?  bought phyllo dough butter pistachios honey before home being reminded just much Baklava DRIP DELICIOUSNESS!!!

Might best Baklava had    Everything always fresh no microwaves no freezers great new place highly recommend! <EOR> This restaurant set fast food style paper plates plastic cups  known would visited lunch instead date night  food pretty good we'll start 4 stars but shocked differently treated using restuarant com certificate  food expensive wouldn't let order advertised special because using gift certificate  order same type thing spent $15 per plate Mediterranean meat rice  Then guy register seemed owner proudly announced he charging 18% gratuity   REALLY   over $5 server would never meet?  Instead handed 2 plastic cups expected own water fountain clear paper plates table  Clearly wouldn't expect tip other customers but due clause certificate designed help people owner saw opportunity some extra cash  Even sauce sign said only cup allowed per order  The cups didn't hold more tablespoon  whole thing just gave creepy feeling  wouldn't pay 18% gratuity eat burger joint just because coupon but could spent $5 extra per person gotten rack ribs sit down dining experience  <EOR> I just ate parents while driving trough Las Vegas   Being Persian ourselves hoping some Persian fare didn't quite meet expectations   ordered number 10 beef combo one skewer kubideh tenderloin weren't impressed taste especially considering price point  $15!! My parents' first reaction place isn't Persian but rather Arab referring combination spices use   Arab recipes tend use spices cumin while Persian recipes lean heavily onion   We did really fresh baked bread two yogurts  maast o khiar maast o moosir  yogurt creamy flavorful   Service good   food fairly quickly staff helpful kind   Overall give 3 stars   Decent food superb   If you're Persian looking Persian food probably won't satiate you   But if you're looking just decent meal then you'll ok  <EOR> What's when mix flames kababs? dined twice  first time demanded second visit but second visit left little saddened reminiscing first glorious visit  Dreaded inconsistency!  When Flame look forward fresh tender meats sticks piping hot fresh taftoon made special oven assume tomatillo chutney seriously kicks butt most tomatillo salsas experienced  Oh Persian iced tea! hummus thick tasty  tabbouleh nice  baba ghanoush little smoky tad oily    When Flame off bread loses magic  served piping hot under salad which soggy  Definitely request bread side  second visit lamb lost its tenderness  BBQ chicken good but rice little bland  Plus Persian iced tea replaced Gold Peak! NOOOOOOOOO! Okay maybe Persian tea somewhere but did see it    The workers gracious definitely concerned your culinary happiness  space fancy but clean bright   Conclusion probably won't trek back location but experience tasty enough warrant visit new right down street! <EOR> This chain right? why does each place different special  read some good reviews Eastern decided try location  Unlike former latter does $3 99 lunch special  ok because $5 99 gyro still good deal   While ordering felt cashier trying pressure into ordering more food needed  might everything often but know gyro more enough  Luckily stuck mindset because gyro gigantic  gentleman working grill generous amount meat he shaved off  sliced meat then thrown into frying pan  unable identify if oil broth finish cooking process  feeling first because meat came darker bit crisp  finished thrown top pita liberal amount tzatziki sauce lettuce tomatoes side onions  meat salty but yogurt sauce lemon green sauce helped even flavors  other location if looking variety lunch specials  <EOR> The food great but some prices little high   location itself pretty nice   really comfortable little couches coffee tables patio there's fantastic view strip airport  My boyfriend ordered shawarma   delicious right around $9 which just fair   came some hummus small dolma   ordered koobideh lamb kebab combo came bread rice roasted tomato $17ish   kebabs awesome but price seemed little high me   Looking over menu ate saw mix match any 2 koobideh kebab ground beef ground chicken ground lamb $9 deal   try next time stop by  <EOR> I usually support Persian restaurant any city visit  Flame descent restaurant  concept restaurant more fast food joint lunch dinner place  some reasons hard time assimilating fast food Persian food  food fresh bread homemade  Atmosphere 3 5 built restaurant way feel fast food joint  windows kitchen see preparation your order  meat prepared advanced left fridge  atmosphere isn't bad just favorite place eat Persian food premise  Food 3 5 Food fresh good  wouldn't give them price Best restaurant town though  great concept if you're looking eat something cheap fast  quick turn around meat halal  Service 3 5 give them 3 5 because nice people  restaurant sort self service difficult judge service end   Overall good place eat cheap Persian food  Sikh Koubideh example $6 99 two Sikh $9 99  favorite restaurant Vegas but support them sometimes  <EOR> I into Flame Kabob first time today  ordered Beef Shish Kabob soda $12 two  right bit steep lunch opinion hoped meal would price  disappointment took FOREVER food! wasted half hour lunch just ordering waiting food done note work next door practically!   meat wasn't cooked throughout rice just meh  only thing saved meal freshly prepared taffoon bread  delish  why gave 2 stars instead just one   All things considered   I definitely return restaurant  worth shot but rather take $12 somewhere else  <EOR> Came lunch today coworker  perused menu didn't see lot options prices aren't best seen  Service standard efficient  ordered beef lamb shawarma coworker chicken shawarma    They cook everything order which take little longer prepare most places but worth wait freshness  food pretty good  best but definitely hit spot  serve generous portions both stuffed meals  <EOR>
