Curry House restaurants Orange County Torrance previous favorites but place just kicks notch  While getting foot massage next door looked yelp find something good dinner reviews convinced try it    After going back forth try saw food delivered table next just ask exactly same thing  gentleman said double chicken katsu curry sausage corn damned if wasn't every bit awesome he said but more later  started edamame which perfectly steamed topped large sea salt crystals great flavor addition without being salty  also gyoza which good but particularly remarkable any way  hind sight should ordered appetizers because would soon stuffed beyond capacity feeling overfilled water balloon!   When meal came chicken super moist tender super flakey crispy breading blew away expectations  rice perfectly done sticky should mixing nicely curry  corn served beside rice little pile just begging mixed sausage looked hotdogs but certainly didn't taste way more Polska Kielbasa great flavor  guy next sliced everything mixed together when Rome   well know  Anyway long review even longer add curry excellent flavor really brought whole thing together nicely   good think only thing could made better getting free actually am town business guess means free all!  Guess should buy lottery ticket now cause feel hit jackpot Curry House Zen tonight! <EOR> I group 10 called restaurant reservations  When called Zen answered said restaurant only holds 18 people time  answer? 8 more needed At first menu glance all see deep fried  Unfortunate   Low behold see beef sausage dish speaking server found made grilled chicken too  Recommended    Funny note  Picture beef showed 4 pieces  asked server if picture accurate he said actually 6 pieces  server 5   Um ya  server came back later two more pieces     The chicken katsu good  Lots rice each dish  Don't order side corn its 2 tablespoons most really?

Curry bread tastes crack but curry whatever magic salivate  Think pastry without sugar all savory goodness   Prices okay  see runs pretty quickly per person  charge quite bit toppings  $2 50 three tiny sausages? Base curry just rice sauce little bit meat all $8 $10ish you're still expected toppings? It'd pretty plain curry otherwise  cheap pho but still pretty savory nice change pace  all add ons between boyfriend bill came $35ish   Not exactly cheap but hits spot!

Strawberry Nigori Sake bomb!! <EOR> First off LOVE Japanese Curry usually Rainbow but coming location worst decisions made  came party 9 everything seemed smoothly  Most ordered then those came 10 minutes later ordered after  Cool we're waiting plates begin come slowly  But sister noticed two curry udons ordered weren't coming but waited patiently  EVERYONE else plates waiter waitress mentioned nothing udon  asked them just said oh two udon bowls come they're watery? Apparently sister likes but everytime gone other location nice THICK curry  addition ordered spicy level 6 spicy ALL  Maybe forgot rushed it? knows   But whatever just hungry wanted eat then home  ask bill mind previously mentioned going pay separately   wait 10 minutes bring check then she tells write numbers tell split it  did handed back  wait 20 more minutes bill come she separated entree saying she no time split way wrote said just combine paper checks she'll ring that  she brings back cards 5 minutes later card no where found then mentions $8 minimum fact most party paid  Luckily sister whose bill only around $12 able combine checks because complication  bring check back register area because waiter waitress didn't bother check us  ask card server Yuki told she didn't know where card was  whatever stacked bottom trays  She told sit table because she didn't time ring right there  waited longer  she brought check back along sister's   bill fine but sister's she charged more she supposed pay for  bill only supposed around $18 but charged almost double amount  Wtf? fed place  Yuki told supposed say splitting which did they're busy she couldn't take care must wait  another person comes later named Yuta he clarifies resolves issue  But apparently still unpaid entrees check did she change other people? put exact checks form payment separate trays she couldn't mixed up? other waiter didn't even bother help us  Should've eaten Hwaro Monta Ramen instead   All all WORST EXPERIENCE EVER  Would recommend location  Rainbow if want charged right amount want good service  <EOR> Food came quick  Service great  Food though just ok  Felt eating Asian Texan food  almost country fried steak eggs potatoes spicy twist  3 spicy level which regular eater cayenne peppers pretty mild but because mixed gravy errr curry sticks awhile eat it  <EOR> What unique simple yet elegant place is!
