But service management needs attitude check    I am former customer would carry them once every 2 weeks several months  few bad experiences    few times told 20 minutes until order would ready I'd arrive 20 30 minutes later still wasn't ready  Which fine! Company's busy! it  another time order taken over phone but didn't actually pizza until arrived tried pick up  Again while no offer given loss service still said nothing  Mistakes happen! We're all human!  Which brings today  placed order over phone usual  20 minutes till ready  Standard until emergency prevented going pizza  already felt bad calling cancel order especially when told pizza already made  But no way could pie  1 employee non sympathetic tone before placing hold without telling another came line whose voice recognized manager say am going pizza?! When didn't answer he told he would put list no longer take orders phone number   said sorry several times but apparently wasn't enough    Bottom line angry rant  But more effort leave feedback company room growth! lost repeat customer tonight cost medium meat lovers pizza roughly $20   really worth it?!  If you're fan New York style pizza definitely check guys out! But consider dining <EOR> Had change revew 1 star!!! unfortunately tried give them 3rd chance  Shame me  still cant figure take order over phone  cut off when try give them number let alone order continuously repeat myself  worth it  NEVER AGAIN!!!
