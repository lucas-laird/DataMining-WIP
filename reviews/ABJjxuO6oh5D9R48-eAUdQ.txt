It second worst Casino Buffet ever life !  luck 2 worst buffets single weekend !  Disgusting ! It hard crest especially Italian section   Why good variety pastas ?! easy everybody likes    I am picky ! Good food simple delicious  If very desperate hungry eat t buffet if RUN your life ! <EOR> Currently writing review buffet  starters buffet person usually food very bland but thought I'd give shot  surprised find all meat very flavorful  pizza ok  Presentation revealed bar very beautiful  enjoyed being able own drinks  breakfast food edible but nothing write home about  Sitting next cleaning area kind annoying constant clunking dishes  All all I'd come back again brunch  $20 99 adults $13 99 children  <EOR> Old country buffet way better   Price ridiculous food   somewhere else  <EOR> While Luxor works well hotel casino fails miserably place eat   buffet should avoided all together unless unlimited champagne really means much you     The food selection extensively American extensively bland   Reflecting back no memorable dishes all   clear inferior ingredients used where possible keep overall cost minimum   Even omelet station offered wounded omelets   Any Embassy Suites America place breakfast   Alas champagne   Bottomless but quality champagne hardly worth effort   would much happier buying bottle two Veuve staying hotel room girlfriend     Probably worst buffet Vegas  avoid  <EOR> Let start off this YES did eat many other top buffets course better   but pay for! But $22 99 can't wrong place either     We ate 1st night Vegas staying Luxor just convenient us  price both thought pretty decent  also serve Crab legs! also note way LESS Saltier then crab legs Cravings Buffet @ Mirage which hated food all warm even arrived only 1 hour left open still constantly changing food Tuesday night also wasn't very busy  impressed selection food wasn't obviously large other buffets but satisfying  Even deserts good  as see face photos lol actually ate again last day before going air port  didn't leave feeling shitty tired afterwords   If trying non super expensive meal pretty hungry lazy leave hotel would defiantly eat again  <EOR> Lol overall buffet only gets 2 stars 300+ reviews! give more credit that  say better Hometown Buffet but better most buffets areas Vegas  Other juices watered down prices high eggs soft cooked everything else good  different things choose desserts  few cooks deck them omelette you  California rolls well  Bar too  Huge restaurant kept pretty clean  Nice employees  <EOR> For buffet place awesome meatballs dumplings everything  dessert table site see  Many variations choose disappointed   Price $19 99 per adult lunch bad all most places start $25 also package whole day eating $40  Considering chips aids $9 gift shop $40 whole day good food doesn't sound bad all  Make sure your Mlife card discount  <EOR> I come Vegas least once every two months  love buffets convenience city   However quality os important buffet  course pay for  buffet Luxur MORE lower end scale  food consists mainly pasta salads  Very few meet items  being hotdog! Waffles eggs soggy  No waitresses if cream your coffee better snatch your neighbors   The price $15 99 lunch low enough full without complaining but don't look dining experience  far top two buffets Mirage Planet hollywood  semi pricy but worth every penny   Viva Las Vegas <EOR> I don't see anyone could possibly think Buffett good  little variety food mostly tasteless undercooked  Really bad $25  <EOR> Had breakfast couple days ago using free rewards MyVegas  Lots choose everything tasted okay  terrible amazing just average quality breakfast food  <EOR> We came vegas trip last weekend pleasantly surprised! huge yelper check reviews everything little nervous but say food way better expected   crab legs small but juicy cooked perfect carnitas good nachos great especially when put carnitas them   flan creme brulee awesome cream puffs fresh raspberries  came right brunch ending dinner starting everything fresh   Avoid lasagna prime rib though both no good  <EOR> A few days later back More but wish hadn't  time around Saturday just before dinner rush    We added all drink 4 99 beverage package 4 6  sounded good idea time however only included beer wine champagne      You bartender first drink such huge line only ended getting more hardly all drink They should serve yourself wine champagne if all drink !   Also no frozen cocktails despite them being sign menu when asked double White Russian told 20$ !   The food also wasn't nearly good  Steak night husbands even cooked inside    The seafood came cracker but tiny seafood forks meat inside  Imagine much crap wasted because !   The salad bar again best part meal wasn't good first time    The desert bar filthy self serve ice cream dirty dishes piled up   There many items missing  carrot cake The creme brûlée just custard  Let down!  no hard candied shell top    The most appealing thing  bubble gum behind glass couldn't access     Wow wished never returned  Sorry More time More more time much <EOR> Not impressed  paid 50 two people wasn't bad but food wasn't very good selection wasn't very big  Most food shellfish which couldn't eat only enjoy ham mashed potatoes  dessert bar best part large variety lots cheesecake! service very poor  When walked woman seated decided tell don't need high chair instead ask did fact need high chair  when dessert husband workers hovering over rudely asked if he should just bigger plate  two pieces cheesecake cookie    <EOR> This place reminiscent Home Town Buffet slightly wider variety twice price  full disclosure Monday evening hour before closing  any standout dishes just more of  surprising number dishes hot slightly coagulated  free passes time share presentation otherwise definitely would eaten there  Also name   More   really? Should stuck Pharaoh's Feast  <EOR> For $19 99 might well swinged over Rio Wynn bit more money better quality food  Don't wrong  food pretty decent but nothing top grade when comparing different buffets choose LV Strip    The Cinnamon Monkey Bread something different nature gave place some uniqueness  unlimited mimosas can't wrong  waitress served drinks funny hell but could taken wrong way when joking champagne costing only $3 bottle    Anyways bad place overall but better choices if other places raved about  buffet M hotel hear place lately! <EOR> This place actually go to buffet Vegas  saying best ever but price quality convenience there's reason keep coming back    Convenience big plus me  normally stay Mandalay Bay Delano Luxor buffet really short walk away  don't even leave building since casinos attached  If stayed elsewhere strip would admittedly change go to spot though   Quality stay Mandalay Bay I'd still rather walk over eat Mandalay's own Bayside Buffet  Yes Luxor isn't extravagant  If you're looking king crab legs lobster best cuts steak you're definitely going disappointed  Walk knowing place offers basic international fare you'll satisfied    Pricing place expensive your hometown standards but bad Vegas standards  Plus always $40 45 all day wristband lets back in  If time right  least three full meals!  steal Vegas! wristband also lets into buffet Excalibur but believe Luxor better choice   Service usually alright too  Even when there's long line wait doesn't feel bad usually seated within reasonable amount time group size  Everything including drinks self service don't really interact staff  They're usually quick picking empty plates table  There's nothing really complain about  <EOR> The buffet LUXOR very mediocre   big variety dishes but unfortunately aren't properly cooked   The meat dried many other dishes very poor flavor      I won't come back rather invest more money more enjoyable experience    Cheers! <EOR> This isn't expensive buffet find other casinos but good good food  Plenty seating enough room around without tripping over other diners  <EOR> The decor big part experience   colors gray white going light green   think decor bland nauseating  Food really tasty overcooked   Nothing taste good   Salty foods salty   Sweet foods sweet   lot fruit veggies   No seafood all   But lunchtime   hope Luxor changes color lighting   hope hire good cook   hope food good turnover   hope change price   Eating elsewhere definitely more preferable  <EOR> Let preface saying all day buffet free normally runs $38  free food always tastes anywhere 2 2 5x better food pay for    Our first day Vegas hit Studio B Buffet M Resort needless say More Luxor step down   literally because place located basement Luxor  said easily best food ever eaten inside basement    If stick normal food hard find much complain about  First breakfast buffet sausage eggs bacon omelette bar solid great filling start day    only two things breakfast buffet bad couldn't swallow bite biscuits gravy sausage egg burrito  don't know inside so called burrito but damn sure wasn't anything would ever use home  biscuits gravy more bland disgusting night downing straight shots tequila no problem should say lot didn't courage take more bite hard biscuit nasty gravy    For dinner pretty much standard Hometown Buffet Golden Corrall food  Nothing going blow away would find Wicked Spoon Studio B but  few tasty items tried  First Buffalo Shrimp pretty amazing  never Buffalo Shrimp but eaten 2 plates shrimp alone  Second carved turkey very good paired mashed potatoes gravy say surprisingly Thanksgiving like  definitely some decent food dinner but more few duds    The pizza Imagine if Digiorno came new pizza called Flavorless   More's pizza nutshell  crust texture Digiorno but sauce everything else tasted moist paper towels    The Chicken don't know fuck chicken because scrambled eggs list The Most Impossible Foods Ruin but More manages great job doing poor job preparing chicken  Tons fat no flavor gooey texture etc  tasted way would imagine chewing human kidney would be    So all all More great if discount stick basic foods offered order recharge your batteries something your stomach  However if you're spending full $26 int he buffet would suggest extra $14 Wicked Spoon heading down road Flamingo's Paradise Buffet same price  <EOR> I myVegas comp buffet used last night   surprised your own drinks but  OK me   didn't wait anyone other myself   I started doing walk through entire area see had   ended starting salads   macaroni salad pretty standard OK   western salad shredded lettuce red bell pepper fresh jalapeño rounds   salad nice kick quite good   also some couscous which also good   did find some bread sticks salad station   regular roll area standard large rolls   butter packets only small margarine containers available   breadstick didn't need it   I then carving area he new piece beef   prime rib   looked rectangle beef looked well done   When asked gentleman where all nice rare meat gone when did walk through he cut beef half gave nice slice less done inside   piece bok choy some hush puppies macadamia crusted chicken breast apricot   no  macadamia nut flavor all   apricot gave chicken some taste rather being plain chicken   I then desserts   fairly nice selection small plastic cups appearing buffets everywhere   first plate panna cotta lemon top filling fresh raspberry flan fresh blackberry some chopped nuts small container chocolate trifle   panna cotta chocolate trifle great  the flan less so   Second dessert plate macadamia nut cookie small pastry filled vanilla cream another fresh raspberry star desserts Oreo cookie cheesecake   The buffet OK   $22 charge you're getting kind fare you'd Bellagio other property but also charge $10 more   wouldn't drive Strip pay buffet   lot better choices locals casinos Strip   But comp nice dinner   really did fact more iced tea anytime wanted without waiting   Finally every time left table bussed before back    something happens all buffets   saw several people leaving last night without leaving even dollar bus person   know did most work but he cleaned table before during dinner last night   He other wait staff deserve tip! <EOR> Wow    this buffet horrible  worth price all  Egyptian theme nice very spacious but only thing worth noting here  ONLY reason gave buffet star because omelette station  station create your own omelette   which pretty good  Everything else good all  large selection  fruit warm no watermelon strawberries?! silverware dirty server very standoff called multiple times assistance  Please   go elsewhere your meals! plenty great buffets Vegas  worth extra penny! <EOR> The MORE buffet Luxor definitely good  price around $30 person which cheap but expensive other buffets  less way better food anywhere near strip   Let start environment bit outdated seats very comfortable  appeared clean however ample seating wasn't busy all which should told something peak dinner time   There really anything write regards staff  pay seated your own drinks isn't much interaction there   Getting food    More food? selection HORRIBLE  disappointing  small carving section turkey sausage beef chicken noting elaborate  Literally plate assorted sushi which SAMs could probably better platter  sides seemed consist squash cooked Asian Mediterranean Mexican whatever else influence think love squash but love variety different sides choose even better  think also saw mashed potatoes rice  menudo which bowl couldn't eat much salt think may cooked sea water  Disgusting   Just bad bad all around   If you're going hit buffet Vegas don't come Luxor  Spend your money elsewhere worth here  Minimal selection tastes badly  <EOR> Don't waste your money   so worth it!  food no tastes dry! Treasure Island much better! <EOR> Reading some reviews people crack up  course price ridiculously inflated buffet but difficult all find BOGO coupons even earn free meals eaten twice during stay didn't pay dime   Secondly if you're looking gourmet creations world class chef you're going here  casino buffet people!  find nice selection salad bar good choices main dishes plentiful desert counter   all eat sure ate lot wasn't disappointed whatsoever  <EOR> This only buffet while Vegas disappointment! Luckily wife some coupons three deal  If pay three full meal tickets then would really pissed! Although buffet bar huge food mediocre  ham fatty ribs over cooked fish freezer burnt rest very bland  give mad props dessert bar  selection good flavor presentation excellent  <EOR> Its bad if aren't expecting much  leave full belly but its best buffet money  buffet Excalibur much better money  <EOR> The food while bland wasn't bad  end result however 1 star o matic this    I'll grant buffet cheap especially compared LVH's but honestly didn't feel many decent food selections    The ice tea sucked but whatever  just going write off another 2 star but then came gas    So  Much  Gas  all hit when casino floor thank God able bathroom lest need drop air freshening bombs result  more gas Chevron station!   Part thought could something else but reading another review complaining gas know More guilty party    To think Luxor Which itself nice place bucket list  Still shall venture anywhere buffet causes nuclear digestive explosions neither should you  <EOR> I love place Paul amazing  He kept coming check taking all plates done  just really appreciate great customer service  He extremely sweet such hard working person  hard come across people that  food great steak good thanks back  <EOR> Our service poor  service dogs son brain trauma issues  serve staff would serve unless over wall sat far away people could  server come over hand napkins over wall yelling hey miss me  dishes cleared even once no even once asked if needed anything  six service dogs laid quiet entire time  very sad this  also felt food very poor compared past experiences   Overall am sad treatment received hope resolved others future  son felt awful though he caused damage control result  <EOR> As cheap $29 99 entire day eating buffet   think anything good except watermelon   Grilled tilapia somehow breaded   Dessert looks pulled box placed stand   Sushi still frozen   Put way did any item buffet line more once   messed steamed rice   wtf?  case wondering many hard uncooked rice morsels plate   Save your money eat elsewhere     If you're wondering why would even eat buffet experiencing places bellagio wynn buffet because forced purchase all inclusive package group with   Which worth if actually want participate all stuff offer but really does while vegas? <EOR> I BOGO mlife buffet reading reviews thought disaster    Nope!

<EOR> We during Independence Day long weekend   place pretty good dinner  Asian Mediterranean Mexican Italian addition others  Steak corner little small but am biggest fan steaks okay me  sushi bar enjoyed most  Also desserts great here  Dinner costs 31$ per person  interior good stuffs friendly  recommend place friends  <EOR> As said review hotel itself buffet again some very hard working kind people provide great service but food quality worth cost   fed group hungry people but just going old country buffet <EOR> Dinner Mar 3    opinion Golden Corral better why because big yeast rolls fried chicken other much difference   hate harsh but starved flying all day really wanted good solid meal      Price wise MORE Buffet much better value paying $23 Johnny Rockets burger fries shake  So if looking mass consumption low price your buffet   But if looking anything substance great quality Rio Buffet  <EOR> The juices coffee decent food OK but nothing great  did enjoy egg white omelette muffins near desert looked excellent but already full point = I found grits watery overall just standard buffet  prefer Pyramid Cafe upstairs  <EOR> We ended Titanic Bodies  pretty good lunch   Lots selection but nothing write home about   Much better circus circus but good Treasure Island   did enjoy privacy overall quite nature when around 2 00pm <EOR> More definitely less  find better buffer Bakersfield  selection small food taste little better prepare high school cafeteria  cocktail shrimp half size those other buffets prime rib overcooked perfection  If wasn't $5 off coupon reasonable price definitely star  <EOR> I coming buffet Luxor many years now expectations consistently met   affordable but selection varied find other Vegas buffets   staff friendly décor cool food stations clean organized   Nice see still some salad options seems trend Vegas buffets eliminate salad options  <EOR> Great place brunch little pricey side $50 total 2 guests but included all drink mimosas which made really good orange juice unlike most places  All food great omelets they omelet bar made order wife waffles which she loved French toast  Everything excellent best breakfasts town  <EOR> wouldn't come back unless another discount coupon  only plus mimosas included price  <EOR> More really should called Less because less thrilled experience here    I spent $19 breakfast honest thought getting deal  sign says $35 all eat all day which sounded good deal well   I paid meal seated  noticed wait staff only took your plates  didn't your drinks  drinks self serve which plus but minus terms tip  When pay ask tip front now see why  Fortunately wanted tip cash   Anyway buffet seemed huge but guessing because breakfast lot items empty  did see food items wasn't actually much food take  surprised being Vegas city excess   The food reminded hospital food  very flavorful very hot  Honestly everything tastes made home  If ever ate house you'd know mean  good thing  no seasoning anything  just bland   There many many options choose strip definitely find buffet price less much better  would steer clear More definitely wouldn't recommend anyone anytime soon  <EOR> Do love having your time wasted? Enjoy spending your day Vegas waiting line?   You've found perfect place!  To preface let explain many buffets Vegas over years price place wasn't shocking  expensive? Kind but can't surprised given location    Located downstairs LUXOR hotel casino place hardly ever crowded except dinner time    However doesn't keep place having line!   I would've given place four stars if incredibly rude inconsiderate woman register! If you're going charge Strip prices sure your service par  place just lucky great advertising    She completely ignored family chatting people BEHIND line! Wtf! Then rolled eyes when asked seated  Unbelievable  <EOR> The lunch buffet made everyone party sick food only okay  However did amazing steam pork buns that's all matters right?   also your own drinks buffet which alright idea because usual slow service buffets  draw backs though because more work really think until try it  <EOR> I never quite trust low rating buffet Vegas because people super picky  However case low rating pretty accurate  problems     1  selection so so  Nothing special    2  quality really does place in  only did just everything little no flavor but EVERYTHING super dry sitting long    3  women's restroom closed entire two hours there  ????  4  Atmosphere  place basement feels it  feels tomb  fun place eat right?  The only saving grace S'mores Dump Cake  don't know something almost magical came place  pretty basic chocolate cake absolutely smothered hot fudge very think layer toasted mini marshmallows huge Graham crackers  Unfortunately dessert good isn't worth price $18 99 risk might day  <EOR> This place great!!

I don't know buffet really mediocre  Hometown Buffet better selection do  However did catch champagne brunch down unlimited mimosas  sucks those really don't want alcohol but compelled order because you're paying already  ended eating much cocktail shrimp since wasn't any more seafood  mood something crab lobster but neither   I must say  Mimosa does well everything <EOR> Better expected reviews  Vegas quasi family reunion  older generation mostly loves place   found good deal MyVegas coupons would questionable value without   aunt thinks Chinese food great but found cheapest cheap   Mexican food hit miss   limb tried Hawaiian pasta salad which turned mayonnaise based macaroni salad cut grapes mixed in   Desserts carried widely quality creme brûlée being favorite many tried   Soft serve notable chose regular not low non fat found cut above many other soft serves which attributed fat actual dairy content   second round however stopped tasting good   Of note small Mediterranean mezze section hummus tabbouleh baba ganouj couscous caprese more   all fantastic not situ fantastic but definitely stateside fantastic far favorite part if both meals   Would again?  Only if relatives dragged kicking screaming   thrive variety would try something different  Most food same lunch dinner   Dinner just shrimp mediocre sushi crab legs big hunk meat    One final note never tried tomato soup because lid fallen into sideways no ever cleaned up   looked pretty gross  <EOR> No MGM Mandalay Bay  good buffet money  lunch buffet lot good options  Middle Eastern Asian Mexican Italian American standards  $35 three buffets day  wouldn't suggest but could! <EOR> Formerly Pharoah's Pheast   Definately spacious dining area   But food just OK  <EOR> Got chance visit buffet morning boyfriend before heading back home  Eating passion ours try different places see offer  1 10 scale give place 5  Everything mediocre best pretty tasteless cold  other reviews mentioned lot dishes listed but weren't physically there  boyfriend figured if add crap load ketchup though really adds some flavor  dessert however pretty good  sure would recommend place others impressed pink chicken served  ended going back buffet tables 4 times just because only liked 4 bites worth each plate  Maybe first timers luck?

Lunch $16+tax dinner $20+tax  There ton different options choose from   Mexican Chinese Japanese rolls Italian Greek salad bar carving station mention variety drinks juices soft drinks   list on   long line last time register opened but opened 2 more line moved little faster   clean dirty plates taken away quite fast good experience  <EOR> I came twice while staying Luxor   mostly roped because only $12 99 Friday $18 99 Saturday  Which isn't bad compared most breakfast places   that seems isn't really abundance breakfast places because most people still hungover dead then     I impressed food selection   but impressed quality  breakfast food all pretty decent  lard fest potatoes chorizo scrambled eggs spanish omelet eggs benedict bacon occasion  bad   but could because FAMISHED  highest quality food said but price bearable   The brunch mimosas champagne little more sub par  mimosas surprisingly good even though probably used sparkling apple juice something equally weak  little early AM me   but figured if paying might well it   The food BLEH  some weird kind fried rice lo mein covered grease very bland  mac cheese looked sitting while  pasta salads only thing happy eat   but guess hard mess pasta salad   Not worst food ever had   but very far best  Service good though  drinks very quickly plates cleared when necessary  <EOR> Sometimes just can't convenience  buffet Luxor offered  Everyone want only wait line seated    My recommendation during breakfast buffet since doesn't love all eat French toast bacon? also bottomless mimosas    It's hard buffet amazing food but pretty good  <EOR> So buffet want when Vegas TAXI!!! quick! take buffet RIo! waiting seemed forever line morning brunch finally seated   Then thru buffet so   nothing spectacular food nothing interesting unusual would stand nothing would ever want come back     Vegas trying new foods experiencing things something would consider new experience   just blah  <EOR> Had two comps MyVegas lunch food pretty good   gourmet any standard but filling didn't bathroom afterwards unlike previous years   If you're really into buffets just want something no frills just enough tide over until dinner it'll do   just couldn't imagine paying $17 lunch here   plus beverage selection desserts  <EOR> This buffet exceeded expectations generic buffets Las Vegas Strip! access buffet you'll downstairs obscure entrance casino  decided come redeeming reward MyVegas BOGO free lunch buffet  cost lunch $18 99 but redemption gave $22 credit cost only $17 27! Such great deal    The decor fits theme hotel found absolutely adorable  buffet called More expected just but found weren't many food options begin with  set very easy navigate large signs above each group foods which made easier select food  wide variety cold salads Latin Asian other International foods    From food offerings favorites include bratwurst BBQ pork sliders vegetable spring rolls beef taquitos beef stroganoff creamed spinach Spanish rice    There also bar buffet but free didn't bother purchasing there  desserts look good but taste relatively subpar  guess can't expect much when advertise creme brûlée buffet!  All all price buffet definitely worth your money especially since open during very convenient times  would highly recommend coming cheap alternative on Strip dining  step food courts! <EOR> I guess just geared toward buffet experience  always find 80% food bland uninventive  mass produced just going amaze  because many tourists many places play VERY safe  Nothing spicy  Nothing flavorful  Nothing unique   I always leave wishing I'd spent half money regular meal elsewhere   I mean if buffets your thing probably pretty middle of the road  Good if you're staying Luxor you're lazy  But don't know I'd special trip back  fact if didn't credits use don't think we'd even bothered  <EOR> Buffett good price    I prefer Bellagio! <EOR> If want good buffet     Unless you're insanely tight budget just craving buffet fun variety skip this  You'll pay double dinner elsewhere but million times better   On other hand if you're just going fast four course meal salad soup entree dessert find yummy option each genre satisfied   Most meats over cooked tough flavorless both  Fried chicken good chicken Marsala too  Roast beef just okay horseradish sauce weak sadly   Mashed potatoes kind lumpy  Gravy minimal taste  only vegetable side saw corn onions???   Pasta dishes blah but shockingly *awesome breadsticks* decent pizza   Mexican station nice  Nachos pretty good all fixings  Well  all  no guacamole   One major gripe something insane happened guacamole like maybe kid put something weird it refused put any more even though buffet going open two more hours  lady pointed few other people nearby obviously disappointed  wasn't worth saving $ putting more piss 5 people off    I skipped most cold salad options food born illness usually found uncooked food  fiancé tried ambrosia salad liked wasn't ill anything   The tomato bisque jazzed version Campbell's but liked it  Chicken soup fairly pleasant Mexican meatball soup   Desserts  ran only thing interested in pistachio Creme brûlée left sign torture me  Running early night seems lame  Leaving sign prove fail    Some cakes dry I'm looking carrot cake others plushly moist yes hot smores lava cake    They good drinks those included buffet Mt dew really fizzy plenty syrup soda water ratio  Hot chocolate coffee available well milk Pepsi products   Overall wouldn't visit again because didn't enough well prepared meats variety side dishes  However don't regret going because did plenty food nosh smores lava cake saved utter dessert disappointment  <EOR> Heard good things 7 continent variety buffet Luxor  price sure better places eat  food just ok  No real service speak since buffet minimal contact other being taken table    No welcome no explanation different areas food represented  Vegas but everyone return visitor  people visiting all over world asking if you've before if say no then give quick run down  truly feel if greeters engage more quests give brief run down food variety available   Again food isn't bad but little pricey bland food no customer service   It clean lots seating  <EOR> Food pretty awful  Bad texture tasted pretty bad   I didn't try omelet bar food might better    Even trying wait line while cashier argued some customers whether meal going comped  <EOR> Came Christmas Day  line expected  Everything buffet self served even drinks  vast selection cuisines  Greek American Italian Asian Mexican sea food but more importantly everything tasty  Usually buffets desserts don't taste good despite looks but tried 2 desserts tiramisu cheesecake both delicious  price 29 dollars includes alcoholic drink  <EOR> Great seafood options buffet 4pm! Service friendly!!! bought all day pass    totally worth it! <EOR> First off want know kind royal buffets some people going to  MORE far best buffets to   My husband Friday lunch  hour half opened thought going busy already  walked right paid seated  love layout buffet all side dining areas mentioned husband lot people but quiet  spaced really reduces noise level don't yell person sitting across you   The place clean didn't see anything ground food counters  employees making sure food didn't sit walking around stirring changing spoons  Usually when buffet pick couple plates still dirty put them side once us   Our only complaint gentleman meat counter husband said 4 times pork sausage guy repeated then cut piece turkey trying hand him  ended taking wanted anyways but he attitude when husband told No thank asked pork sausage  Then when came back another piece turkey he standing chit chatting woman he watched walk he stayed 45 seconds finish conversation  He never greeted said he would right over just stared when walked up  Very rude  he said he would right over wouldn't taken point away them   Other all food cooked properly everything presentable everything clean most part employees all nice greeted us  <EOR> So fairly average buffet  Just under $20 breakfast  I'd say overpriced but buffet strip so    There's salad fruit bar where could standard salad fruit yogurt smoked salmon cream cheese bagels bread station hummus etc  actual buffet most your standard stuff    Only ironically didn't see any pancakes  French toast waffles tho  french toast pretty good  There's to order egg omelet station plus few varieties line  Bacon sausage hash your meat options line  small healthy section chicken breast  Overall nothing blew mind except maybe quiche but also nothing bad everything correct temperature  Drinks self serve include sodas couple different juices coffee milk chocolate milk teas    Oh dessert bar kinda set off main area but banana bread worth trip  <EOR> Went dinner Monday evening  $24 99  buffet self serve only your food but your drinks also  lot options options available poor quality  fried chicken which tasted shake bake  roast beef fatty chewy  fill salad fruit  honey dew melon cut properly leaving lot rind salad mediocre  place pretty empty now know why  wouldn't recommend going  Only bright spot dessert where decent piece cheesecake  <EOR> Food good  could better  Just some steak dry  Corn cob over cooked  Just few minor stuff  Need new flooring  <EOR> Brought family 5 10 17    Bleh! 25$ each subpar Golden Corral !

Much gross So waste Such disappoint  Wow <EOR> Hmm guess most people rating Luxor Buffet scale against all other amazing buffets Vegas Strip    see where they're coming from    But all honesty food selection bad service really courteous much complain about  However choice eat mere convenience no more that  If weren't staying Luxor highly doubt would chosen buffet eat at  would seriously need game compete against other buffets along strip but considering still survives means must offer something people still come for  <EOR> Well say   you pay for  Starving wanting walk far stumbled upon MORE Buffet   and quickly regretted it   For around $20 came early dinner  seafood   in terms some crab legs cold mussels peel eat shrimp  No melted butter crab!? Sad  However could walk your open crab legs other side buffet them warmed boiling pot water   oooook   Overall buffet  food tasted bland things could better home  most array international foods   but good  Extremely chewy short ribs bland pastas over cooked prime rib dried breads soggy salads just name few  Some items didn't look very fresh replenished   If wanted alcohol   luckily somewhat inexpensive but needed walk bar pay yourself   The cleaning crew kept taking away all silverware drink cup   then leaving dirty trays towels table every time walked away more food  Maybe because myself? Still annoying   If really want true Vegas buffet experience pay extra money elsewhere  food worth it  <EOR> The food decent all  But review CHEESECAKE!  Best cheesecake ever tasted  dreams long eat deliciousness fluffiness once more!   Came 'cause touring friends LA back Sep 2011 why Vegas  After checked Luxor hungry original plan Buffet Buffets purchase 24 hr pass  Unfortunately tired anywhere settled closest us  Unlike 24 hr buffet Buffet Buffets if buy day pass Luxor Excalibur time does following day  Which pretty lame  But being tired ahead purchased dinner   So four ate hearts content   With little no space left headed over desserts section  Picked some fancy looking cakes sat down where magic begins  I know begin describe wonders cheesecake  Even though stuffed cheesecake just amazing   So fluffy creamy full awesomeness taste   I've italian french mexican chinese japanese american etc style cheesecakes top them all!
