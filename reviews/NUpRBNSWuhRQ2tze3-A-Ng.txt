Yeah lot food greasy side but then again mood some greasy food she  Plus buffet making greasy food helps them keep prices down  buffet enough variety the fish nice surprise and some healthier options  stayed good 2 hours total each time tummies could rest before getting some dessert   The staff nice actually loved whole medieval theme Excalibur made feel kid playfully fighting on guard!   thought whole thing where staff person waiting your table waved flag could find your table awesome little unique things made experience even better   Oh when wait over hour 2 1 ain't complaining slightest bit  own fault didn't earlier  Come expect no line buffet when 2 1?

Self serve drinks which think brilliant don't wait waiters waitresses walk off your meal bit bit   Oh I'd also add buffet really wastes food when breakfast over toss everything trash    =[ but guess ok feeds all pigs eventually become bacon      Breakfast GO! Lunch Dinner sleep! Happy eatings! <EOR> WOW buffet really gone downhill ever since last time which couple years ago  first time everything flawless  But now lot dishes mostly bland mediocre  only thing good desserts  <EOR> If considering coming buffet DON'T!!!  place 2 stars reason   I came breakfast using $3 off coupon but came right before lunch both breakfast lunch served   left quite hungry because nothing very appetizing tasty   First all salad selection quite lacking unappetizing   pasta salads also pretty gross looking   tried few least bit interested second bit   You tell most food minus omelet bar came freezer   There's fried chicken corn dogs meat loaf mashed potatoes etc   All just reheated   section eggs chorizo waffles none which looked very freshly made   section hot dogs hamburgers well knock off Mexican Chinese food   didn't bother because all gross looking     For dessert large selection cakes soft serve machine   don't think any house made either     Lastly hate getting own drinks   Yes sounds lazy but buffet poorly laid out   direction food   Then another direction drinks   definitely burn some calories getting together full meal   Overall food definitely worth eating unless less 10 years old don't care   staff super friendly but many tables plates take while cleared     Bottomline EAT HERE!

The food looked disgusting tasted just ok  boyfriend cracked tooth ribs supposed boneless but wasn't   My friend picked two ice cream cones looked flies baked into bottom  When brought attention attendants said cast iron forms cooked yeah right!  Needless say returning here  <EOR> The Excalibur fine resort but pales comparison its counterparts down Las Vegas Blvd where other places feature finer amenities  could more true when considering buffet which C caliber food best   Just rooms food admission price inexpensive   But hindsight really you're paying selection finest nor really abundant   Bonus points fact serve horchata Mexican drink during breakfast lunch!  decor reminiscent Knight's table coinciding theme King's Knights Excalibur  Service always good but doesn't blandness food  If you're coming college don't much money spend then good place cure your hangover  Other stick other buffets higher quality food quantity  <EOR> So think 7 days Vegas finally managed find biggest buffet there     My rating 4 stars based being cheesy buffet   if you're looking classy restaurant give your head shake stopping here   The food good tasted buffet restaurant but really place stand much it!
