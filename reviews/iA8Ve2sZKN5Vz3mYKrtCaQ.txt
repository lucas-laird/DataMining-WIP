J k     sort of  I digress  Soup think Tom Kha vegetarian   asked spiciest have   really good except root type thing un chewable branch   friend said soup great too  At point already super full but then vegetarian curry came   looked great but hot pretty much inedible   When took rest home looked looked he just dumped jar chile peppers there     It did taste good though    So guess moral story cocky your rating spice although defense always order hottest level Lotus always hot enough sweat cry   mouth fire then sneezing fits hot  I reallize review glowing but funny thing really enjoyed can't wait back  waiter did GREEAT job handling Sunday crowd solo  probably opt medium spicy arrive 12 pour tea caution! <EOR> Best Thai Food ever Staff friendly! first bit weary location but once walk you'll forget location because inside nothing appears outside! definitely keep going back  <EOR> Finding place little tricky but once did experience good  After four days nothing but strip eating welcome change pace      As much love vegan food really excited find place where could choices without omnivore man feeling left out    The service super friendly but annoyingly cheerful chirpy kind way when inquired let know chicken eggs but all other soy meat vegan   It busy weekend ran soy beef asked seitan Pad See Ew instead  gave choice regular Chinese broccoli did half half  When tasted wished just gone yummy Chinese broccoli  wasn't fan seitan used but overall dish ok   My favorite part meal Tofu Satay  Yum!!!

Should flavorful spicy Thai food need MSG?  labels itself healthy vegetarian friendly place   service poor takes forever your food when invariably disappointed     Last time ordered Vegetarian Pad Si Ew normally favorite Thai dish   love Chinese broccoli yummy sauce    Figured since vegetarian dish would probably tofu protein right?  Wrong!  no protein except few small beans   also made American broccoli sauce tasted weird   tasted MSG even though requested none   The atmosphere restaurant also quite weird   located Commercial Center within walking distance Lotus Siam    just instead! <EOR> Fantastic experience here  Very friendly waiter  No MSG food which huge me  does need anyway  green curry great  Also ordered Herbal Salad which recommended several yelp'ers  very lemongrass y which good few bites but could eat whole plate it  husband no problem eating good deal though  coconut milk curry great  also ordered mango sticky rice dessert well fried banana homemade coconut ice cream  ice cream die for  best while  homemade!

Perhaps ordered bad shipment meat? way dining experience Komol most unpleasant lunches ever had   The meat  Dear God Almighty meat  Perhaps accidentally gave food garbage? ordered Red Beef Curry disgusting absolutely disgusting    My co workers ordered chicken seemed fair fine but made then sample beef agreed awful  bad beef alone might gotten them three stars but complete disregard fact serving inedible food gets them star    I did eat even 1 5 food brought  When waiter asked if wanted take   rest home said no  asked other people if wanted food all said no  even said meat awful while waiter there    The server's response? Ok  word concern offer bring new dish  Nope  Komol serve garbage does care if hate food just long pay   Most restaurants notice care if someone doesn't eat dish doesn't take home either   generally universal sign bad  Most restaurants try something else ask if there's anything fix it  Komol  Komol wants pay out   Given great reviews others assuming other more edible foods menu  But take advice stay AWAY beef  stay away Komol if want place good customer service   For delicious Red Beef Curry try Le Thai  beef tender high quality juicy does taste garbage  <EOR> I am really excited place!

Super friendly server food all good  ordered tom yam shrimp pad thai duck curry pineapple fried rice  3 very satisfied food! <EOR> I surprised find place commercial center since only place ever eaten Lotus Siam right across way completely same league    I first say huge fan spicy food but came vegetarian UYE leery I'd without all spice   first item spring rolls which suprising plentiful meant sharing sauce great flavor but rolls themselves fresh rolled tight   main dish chicken tofu noodles amazing first full foray into vegetarian eating left far more full satisfied ever imagined     I certainly coming back bring more town guests  <EOR> After hearing much hype place eventually made way Sahara Commercial finally give try   first visit ordered drunken noodles pad kee mao chicken go  She told 15 minutes but closer 30 restaurant empty  chicken minced ground which bit unusual am used to  flavor fine ingredients quality but amazing nor did warrant rushing back there   I decided would try place again before wrote review  week ago back because field nearby area  met another friend lunch gave lunch special try  panang curry lunch special came eggroll rice soup day $7 95  soup pretty bland vegetable tofu  curry fine but unlike Panang curry tried plenty other Thai joints  spicy 7 10 I'd say more realistically 5 10   service very spotty inconsistent  tell wait staff started overwhelmed when lunch rush hour began  But fair pretty slow when just two tables joint   restaurant appears clean interesting traditional Thai decor  menu's wooden covers which cool touch  would probably try place again if area craving Thai but wouldn't drive home  perfect example place being hyped up  <EOR> This Best Thai Restaurant town!!   We started herbal salad followed Penang Curry Pad kee Moa   Medium spicy perfect  Yummy yummy ! Do missed homemade coconut ice cream  end  Sooooooo good    !  Thank Komol Great food great service   back Komol    <EOR> So stopped lunch volunteer work morning   knew place because lunch before   However wasn't anything special back then     only ordered Pad Thai   Although tasty didn't find very special written review it   But today today different story  D  The entree ordered Chicken Chili Mint   pretty good   Ground chicken variety spices included mint fresh red chili hence name    ordered mild BOY mild   would recommend medium heat  waitress said mild 4 10 heat scale   However didn't taste spicy all   Wasn't bad portion either   left enough room two desserts   We ordered banana steeped hot sweet coconut milk   Oh reminded Vietnamese desserts child   It made feel kid again   Warm soothing rich coconut milk drowned chunks firm bananas   texture bananas spot on   still held shape all mushy texture   dessert packed much flavor!  recommend sipping coconut milk little little   REALLY sweet feel  best way eat it   Slow   to SAVOR wonderful flavors I ordered coconut ice cream sticky rice   and absolutely amazing!  sticky rice very warm cold ice cream sitting top resembled thai version warm brownies ice cream   Anyways here's kicker   the coconut ice cream HOUSE made!  Technically ice cream   base simply coconut milk fresh coconut water consistency more icey kinda reminds sorbet but refined    happened those larger icicles because cut through decadent sticky rice pretty well very refreshing   coconut milk sorbet thinly sliced fresh coconut jackfruit   would come back just dessert alone   Minus star because upon entering restaurant board specials day written which included Mango Sticky Rice   However when ordered said weren't serving any because mangoes sweet ripe enough yet   would suggest putting something specials board when available order   But can't complain much   lack ripe mangoes only reason why decided try something new ordered coconut ice cream sticky rice   haha     Chicken Chili Mint + Diet Coke + 2 Desserts = $23 <EOR> Everything far Komol outstanding  even though over half hour away where family lives West side going request trip every time come visit    So far tried panang curry once chicken once vegetarian pad thai eggplant black bean sauce house special duck soft shell crab garlic sauce combination appetizer plate  dish better next  They've spot spice level both times asked little spicy perfect me which really appreciate  staff also helpful suggesting dishes less adventurous eaters group    My complaint menu  giant wood binder  heavy unwieldy  But other can't wait come back again try more menu! <EOR> This place hidden gem near lotus Siam  Absolutely great place vegetarians! green curry chowmein fried rice  Everything delicious much much better lotus Siam which overhyped opinion  5 stars gem place  <EOR> The food great but service absolutely terrible  think took nearly 90 minutes dinner 2 people  great choice when Lotus Siam long wait but prepared spotty service  <EOR> Great food especially vegetarian selections which extensive   place dated almost gave 4 starts that    but since food good just rolled iwth 5    Service pretty darn good too  Red Panang Curry awesome    gotta it  <EOR> Never bad thing menu   Great food great prices   Definitely hidden treasure   always large party never issue   Always great service friendly staff   must try restaurant! <EOR> Now place best world  can't live without should 5 stars forever  Can't live without panang chili mint! <EOR> We dinner 4th July  around 5 tables  took 1 5 hour food served time seated 2 hours overall  missed fireworks hunt down waitress take orders bring check  check never came front desk pay  Perhaps did regular folks working night   The food which took long prepare came extreme spiciness while all requested medium  did patience anymore left    Location restaurant creepy well    We seeing 5 star reviews yelp horribly disappointing  bad day restaurant reviews all fake  Never going back seen better  <EOR> Just ok  Herbal salad packed flavor but became cloyingly sweet ate it   Way much tamarind sugar?

Komol center parking area entire strip mall easy miss if looking it    Having walked down near visit another location Sunday already knew LoS closed lunch yet wanted more Thai   Yelp came rescue delivered another outstanding Thai restaurant!  could hardly believe two best Thai establishments eaten same location!  Hmm   maybe its location looks 40 year old barely maintained strip mall terribly far off far end Las Vegas strip    I agree another reviewer its hard believe both LoS Komol within eye shot each other  Karma anyone?   As mentioned LoS review far walk 99 9% Strip crowd prepared take bus cab   bus w single transfer then only walk short distance across mostly parking lot reach Komol     The interior nicely decorated many awards won clearly posted near entrance   glad afternoon Vegas heat plenty cool inside   immediately ordered Thai Iced Tea water water water     wait staff very attentive 3 Thai Iced Teas before left but lost count water refills dry Vegas air tough    After scanning huge varied menu must say overwhelmed choices options took while decide   However Chief's special looked right honed in   blend spicy herbal curry sauteed string beans carrots bell peppers basil leavers   omitted bell peppers asked 8 10 heat scale    The dish arrived promptly took first bite wonderful but then heat kicked well another reviewer said beware pepper scale    Normally eat all but extreme 10 10 Thai hot levels but 8 much dish    NO WAY could eaten without cream Thai Iced tea calm heat!  asked waitress 8 rating she said dish normally hot b c chili peppers already she recommended milder most customers     It good but damn hot!   highly recommend scaling back your normal heat rating scale prepared hot but delicious ride here!   always turn heat dish arrives!

Worth try Thai beef salad lettuce tomatoes onions cuts beef spicy sweet sour dressing plays around your mouth    Chicken pad thai noodles bean sprouts more enough chicken! Usually when finish all noodles before chicken   when know lot! don't use weird oily orange sauce seen other restaurants  favorite dish get!    Panang curry never fan curry until tried this  coconut curry taste isn't overpowering add just enough spice compliment other flavors  I love taking panang curry sauce putting over pad thai noodles little unorthodox but tastes amazing! Thai tea also pretty legit  doesn't taste powder comes tall slender glass cream layered top  tasty treat before your food    *lunch 11 2 30 comes soup salad egg rolls  amount food definitely lunch sized plenty food left take home   *if you're ever trying cut carbs try papaya pad thai! almost real thing! Papaya used place noodles great! could barely tell difference!   *their spice level isn't really Thai standards    usually dishes around 7 9 don't even break sweat and spice tolerance isn't high   if take heat 10! <EOR> Was craving Thai Vegas found place through Yelp  Reviews seemed decent decided give try!  Not having before restaurant bit hard find located inside large empty strip mall plaza  types surrounding stores sort random circling awhile until restaurant finally spotted yay!  It mid afternoon time place wasn't crowded  few ordered green papaya salad chicken green curry fried combination noodles    Everything extremely flavorful absolutely delicious! return more next time when am town! <EOR> Second Lotus Siam    great food great service  known vegetarian dishes    <EOR> Herbal salad soft shell crab tasty  pad thai very   wet?! such basic dish surprised could mess up  Service slow wanted leave  try again  <EOR> We drove we're wary location but inside anyway  glad did! vegetarian biggest vegetarian menus ever seen  meat eating friends ended eating vegetarian dishes too! food delicious large portions  service also really good  wait staff very friendly  Overall great experience  <EOR> As promised came back yesterday dinner   tried Herbal salad mixed feeling dish   good bad   just much coconut red onion but barely any tofu balance taste vegetarian dish   non dairy ice coffee good   server recognized very friendly   place did crowded  6 p m   Perharps come back third time order right dish? <EOR> Honestly would expect more such highly rated restaurant Zagat restaurant well  think night came jinxed something because experience friend's birthday terribly good   For starters party 6 which increased 7 unexpectedly but fine all just squished bit closer each other  restaurant did table set reservation when arrived good start  ambiance restaurant relaxing noise level while perfect  fact think probably loudest whole place   Service all over place  two people taking orders think where things weird  friend came but needed leave early she ordered food before rest part even arrived she ordered go  Somehow between two servers turned into She wants order shrimp chow mein order shrimp chow mein   Luckily able nip mistake before actually happened  although servers attentive service S L O W  plates food came two time big chunks wait time between people's food arriving  biggest pet peeves when restaurant cannot whole party's food decent amount time  Members party sat without food good 7 8 minutes while others almost halfway through own plates    Food Kang Ped Delight Beef err actually 5 pieces beef   Although really good did enjoy missing beef! curry spot rice sticky yummy  always also Thai iced tea theirs spot on  Creamy milky yet refreshing served very cute glass  also sampled Combo Appetizer Plate group got  BBQ pork very good egg roll also good especially dipped spicy mustard! all also shared fried eggplant which felt okay nothing special  ice cream served friend's birthday kind funky felt though freezer burned  Meh    Overall Honest goodness don't think coming back  lackadaisical service friend's birthday party pretty off putting  Maybe they're just good big groups? no idea  BUT Thai food lot places Vegas closer house  unless *invited* Komol again doubt return  <EOR> My friend ended lunch because wait Lotus Siam ridiculously long   walked into humble looking place feeling bit bitter settle joint  Then waiter brought menus whose front back cover made actual wood  Never seen before  other Thai restaurants Komol provided lunch menu  ordered chicken panang off lunch menu which came soup egg roll  Then told waiter give level 5 heat rating   While soup didn't really impress thought overall   not bad  chicken panang awesome perfectly balanced steamed rice  heat rating also right point  Bravo!  Would chose Komol over Lotus any day? really but place also really good itself  But must admit nice away popularity hubbub Lotus enjoy good meal  <EOR> i wish could put ZERO stars  some WORST service here   Looks deceiving  place looks nice inside     Made reso party 12 waited 10 minutes arriving while tables ready which should've already ready us  _ It's understandable took awhile orders come since such large group but it Took servers 10 minutes before asking orders  One order didn't come until everyone else party FINISHED EATING   This bugged servers every chance ask if friend's food would coming soon  The rest felt bad starting eat before he food but no choice tight schedule already running late  Good thing he's fast eater Weird thing another person group ordered exact same thing only slightly lower level spiciness      The food okay  stay vigilant when servers would pass order attention more water lemon etc  Poor guys but think should tended little more often actually did     To top off check came total $170!!!!!!!!!!! including 18% gratuity which calculated total+tax which WRONG   doesn't sense ALL because 4 12 party own plates while other 8 shared partner   They obviously don't know simple arithmetic somehow stapled some other bill top ours added together    we knew those weren't ordered So calculated correct bill ourselves talked manager it  actual bill only $109 total    NEVER again eat here   Last note food didn't sit well friends  He really sick rough night fever threw quite bit throughout remainder next day until home San Diego <EOR> Komol review Komol nice hole wall could more live its 4 star reputation  hard find big parking lot but once found promptly politely greeted  everyone mentioned menus work art! ordered soft shell crab delicious but portion size smaller fist price just worth it  curry ok but wouldn't order again  actually came vegetarian menu ordered spring rolls pad Thai  vegetarian spring rolls great just bit much basil serving size huge! vegetarian pad Thai also great filled veggies tofu!
