I cannot believe restaurant actually good reviews perhaps incredible unlucky everything wrong kitchen  Anyway lousy experience We staying Stratosphere where lazy eat some other location  agreed check Italian restaurant inside hotel  place cute lots people figured good  service good water really nice  asked he recommended he suggested Mediterranean Linguine since love seafood it  party four also ordered appetizer stuffed mushroom garlic cheese bread  appetizer came mushroom alright  Nothing world all covered tick layer cheese course going taste good  only thing tasted good entire meal  garlic bread terrible  literally old bread melted cheese no garlic flavor  pasta discusting! All seafood chewy over cooked  tried eat just pasta alone tasted horrible too! Everyone party ordered something different no finished meals  two gusys ordered steak guess ok they both said buffet better but sides potatoes pasta tasted horrible  other girl ordered veal parmesane she barely touched it  Then $120 dollar tab gratuity included add  painfly pay  EVERYTHING TASTED TERRIBLE! First time happens anythwhere  Anyway never EVER coming back <EOR> Stayed Stratosphere weekend ended eating twice  food delicious  prices great pasta dishes reasonable meat dishes wine glass prices excellent too   We received excellent friendly service both nights  also appreciated many healthier options menu which pleasant change usual Las Vegas buffet  LOVED pasta primavera highly recommend if vegetarian just looking fresh light tasting meal  <EOR> So boyfriend valentine's day dinner being former waiter he always biggest critic throughout entire meal  Well good things bad things all new restaurant experiences but say more good bad  Loved Ambaince Lighting Music Mozzarella fritte  Rib eye  Ravioli Chicken marsala  No love Waiters didn't really pay attention believe he thought weren't going tip properly but being partnered former Waiter always tip 18 20%  He didnt bring any bread everytime tried ask because saw other tables he simply ignored us  actually brought back same shrimp sent back  Which takes other thing didn't love shrimp overcooked hard much send back redo   Although good bad really liked definitely return  Hopefully Waiter more respect next time because regardless fact didn't service still tipped appropriately  <EOR> Wow! Saw place yesterday but already dinner plans  saw Eggplant Parmesan menu made plans dinner following night  Service fantastic  seats another brings water another brings bread  Let's start bread your normal sourdough loaf BUT BUTTER 2 little scoops sitting olive oil Italian spices  Dang  good! usually don't eat bread why risk carbs? Smart but ate ALL BREAD  Now onto Shrimp Scampi Venezia  good  ordered more bread soak garlic white wine sauce  Eggplant Parmesan  started sauce always start just sauce  More salty side rather sweet side  overly salty just pointing difference  Personally prefer Prego brand over Ragu brand sweet vs salty   eggplant thiiiick way should be  want know eating vegetable deep fried vegetable skin  spot on  Comes side pasta potato  I back  Very enjoyable experience  <EOR> Absolutely amazing food service  stuffed shrimp fantastic chocolate mousse die for  back over over again! <EOR> Fellini's great little restaurant Stratosphere  Granted Stratosphere Four Season's but Fellini's definitely worth visit  did expect much when friend sat down dinner but pleasantly surprised    The cheese ravioli absolutely delicious  Even bread olive oil butter spread amazing  pizza chicken Alfredo Caesar salad also yummy dishes  portions large prices fair    The atmosphere dark very intimate  staff very friendly very attentive  <EOR> During recent vacation returned favorite restaurant Las Vegas  Fellini's  food amazing always  everyone nice  host server boys refilled drinks brought food  Everyone took such good care us  No disappointed us  far best dining experience while Las Vegas   I can't wait back  <EOR> SUCH HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE  Valentine's night last night boyfriend calling Italian restaurants last minute reservation  came fellinis called said could take right away all other restaurants booked   seated quickly restaurant quiet small very elegant looking yet simple  food very quickly everything good until came time pay  When bill brought boyfriend took bank card waiter took came back said didn't through  boyfriend told swipe again because he sure money waiter came back once again said wasn't  bf left table while he atm later found he already charged!!!

One ritual Italian restaurants order inexpensive house wine because if good show attention respect restaurant customers it easy order good Cabernet $100 but requires knowledge sommelier find great Merlot $10   Thus chose half liter house Merlot lo behold good  Kudos staff!  To start brought complimentary warm Italian bread dish olive oil vinegar very good and traditional combination start sipping Merlot   As main dish ordered Mediterranean Seafood pasta    excellent  Fairly large dish tons scallops shrimps mussels calamaris light red sauce  impressed I just wish bit more pasta because AL dente perfect   see picture To finish memorable evening ordered cannoli dessert  ok didn't feel fresh better but maybe just me  Try Tiramisu instead   So it excellent Italian food much better 90% celebrity Italian restaurants fancy strip hotels less expensive and service A+ alas good service lacking most fancy places Vegas waiters conceited!       I would give 5 stars if wasn't bad table so so cannoli but past solid 5 star   If craving Mediterranean Italian food head Fellini's pleased   Ciao! <EOR> Came dinner Valentine's Day boyfriend really disappointed  waiter really awkward treated badly think because look young  21 way treated horrible  Everyone around getting bread pictures taken weren't offered either  top pasta wasn't even good  VERY disappointed going back  <EOR> My partner each salmon exceptional  She potatoes side said surprisingly tasty white potatoes whatever seasoning used really good bc tried them agreed   We each salad house dressing tasty but bit heavy pour slightly overpowered salad  <EOR> I wish same restaurant people before because did great experience everyone else did    First start some numbers Overall Experience 1 10 Ambience 8 10 Service 1 10 Food 6 10  We large party seating fast but wasn't much anything    We ordered drinks took 15 minutes just them despite face some servers just hanging outside kitchen in front where seated Once drinks severs attentive all  wait grab servers attention 20 minutes just water  Once orders taken took 45 minutes food out    The reason giving 1 star isn't just fact food cold took really long time but when food being served server spilled drink table just put plate over spill  All he say oops then he walked away  use own napkin absorb water wait 5 minutes next available server just clean silverware  previous server didn't even bother refilling drink until asked if could please more  <EOR> Good value groupon coupon  Attentive waiters good steaks <EOR> Incredibly delicious Italian cuisine!
