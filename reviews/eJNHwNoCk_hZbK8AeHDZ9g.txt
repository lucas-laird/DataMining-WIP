Then going order lunch over phone work another day co worker asked wrap guy told she look online see  What! busy during lunch but place dead year ago lunch  If want dead again then keep horrible customer service  <EOR> Service workers great but maybe thats because never busy    Food good  much better option chili's sammy's chipotle anything else shopping center but wow omg kind place bit pricey get    I think rollin smokes better but applaud clean dining area nice employees food tell hasn't near microwave except baked beans mashed potatoes which sadly unimpressive sides  Bush's beans kfc powder potatoes  Would 4 if lackluster options your protein choice   accurate name though chicken definitely hero place tender perfectly cooked right amount char but grew soul food sucker seasoning which why despite nicely done chicken ribs probably wouldn't return  Even bbq sauce boring  Nothing kick flavor it  <EOR> Maybe most surprising 4 5 stars review ever given place   But when good good!   And simple that 1  Delicious chicken!  2  Food table extremely quick   3  Service good   4  Prices decent   5  Portions big!   What else ask for?   Bottom line Great place!  Trust me  know food! <EOR> I cannot comment service much because only done take out  But food pretty good  Especially chicken but name chicken better good  fond Mac Cheese though  more macaroni elbows Alfredo sauce  Very disappointing  rice orange but actually fairly good  Overall pretty decent  back but Mac cheese  <EOR> Cheap BBQ  its something great job but sides could use some work  i reccomend potato salad mac n cheese corn cob all other sides whatever <EOR> Hands down best grilled smoke chicken town  favor daily special salads all salads costumer service fast point  Clean friendly place lunch dinner  <EOR> Do yourself favor Mozzarella Chicken Wrap   best tasting wrap encountered   Add some garlic ranch give umph  <EOR> My family loves chicken ribs excited check place out  But did know healthy place   I guess if  you're into then great  But if gonna eat some ribs want them fat juicy  just didn't hit spot  spent $50 three LUNCH  Crazy    I did see other customers some salads wraps looked pretty good  If back opt those  least then healthy part sense  <EOR> Tried place 1st time today Highly Disappointed!  I ordered 1 4 Rib Leg Thigh Combo Mac Cheese  Although Chicken cooked all way through Lacked Flavor  Just Salt Pepper  No Mesquite any other type BBQ smoke expecting  Heck BBQ cooked last night plain ole Kingsford briquettes gave More Flavor place   Ribs Tough anywhere close Fall Off Bone lacked Flavor too   BBQ sauce don't know where hid saw bottles Hot Sauce Labeled way weird watery Salsa Ranch Dressing Whatever diced salad but No BBQ sauce   Mac Cheese think someone Forgot Add Cheese just Mac Some Creamy salted substance   After hearing Sahara location excited New Location neck woods but spending almost $13 don't think coming back any time soon  Maybe try Sahara location knows   2 Stars Cleanliness Nice staff but Restaurant Food Needs Flavorful Needs Taste good! <EOR> Chicken decent best  Mashed potatoes fine  Fruit salad best part used canned pineapple  diet pepsi soda machine syrup no fixed mentioned it  aims fast casual dining experience akin panera California Chicken Cafe but comes pretty short  <EOR> Excellent chicken superb service   know doing when comes grilling   Great side  dishes too   Must  visit  <EOR> Delish Chicken Ribs ! Without doubt best BBQ Vegas! Super fresh everyday all sides yummy too! family eaten weekly since opened! <EOR> This place always delicious! smell hungry   daily special try  forces new things  Waldorf Salad favorite  <EOR> Recently decided try place  high hopes walked loved smell  menu easy navigate  walked order family meal waited while order taker talked kitchen staff two minutes  Then she took order fairly rude while doing it  asked few questions first time  She very snippy very clear  She asked if wanted baby back ribs  St  Louis ribs? said we'll let ask family she said 'oh we'll you'll St  Louis because ain't anything else ' finished ordering highly disappointed first experience restaurant    Our food came lady set down walked away huff puff  Very strange no ok your food need anything else enjoy your meal  Just huff puff  started eating realized gave half tortillas only side  correct food thinking just misunderstanding   lady same ordering said oh brought all your food  Then she checked kitchen people realized she wrong food without apologizing  Oh claim tortillas 'homemade' aren't  next door walmart buy 'uncooked' tortillas refrigerated section  same    Finally sat down eat delicious  food great! would love eat fairly often  sauce bar two sauces bunch empty spaces  bathroom clean  eating area clean  music horrendous  loud was  imagine  club music be  some language great family small children    I back but only food probably forget terrible service!
