This bad trip Fear Loathing Las Vegas  <EOR> First off place remodeled changed its food changed its name Riv Buffet several months ago   Given all terrible reviews little nervous coming but friend said fine breakfast now agree   regular breakfast buffet morning   weekends special brunch buffet but doesn't start until 10am   buffet way more used hotel breakfast   made to order omelets two potato dishes three meats lots fresh fruit cereal coffee juices donuts pastries I really tempted try chocolate croissant but didn't biscuits and gravy chicken fried steak grits oatmeal waffles probably other American breakfast items didn't notice   addition few Asian items including rice congee two types without thousand year egg kimchi   I fruit tator tots coffee donut piece ham bowl congee scallions cilantro    tempted try again tomorrow just more congee since liked much  <EOR> We first night week Vegas say second worst place ate   Many foods held proper temperature most hot items below 100 degrees top would say   Salad actually good however   hot items sometimes skin them showed long there   Prime rib very good would eat again sure   little much fat but buffet cut away doesn't look good toss it   beer which $3 additional   Beer glass came bottle free stains water spots   Overall afraid getting sick food here   always tried taking food bottom containers reduce odds something warm   Still actually some decent food some other stuff sitting way long  <EOR> Ever watched national lampoon vacation las vegas? scene where they're buffet food bright yellow  blue all watery? Well place just that  Who knew soupy eggs wouldn't  taste good!  Gross food much selection nothing looked appealing   Wanted try shrimp but scared I'd infected some unknown virus   The only reason gave place 1 star because good mood!  For 15 bucks could gone across street Circus Circus ate hot dogs  <EOR> Ate buffet before watching Crazy Girls show  Super cheap only $18 person dinner buffet  tacos pretty good  Spaghetti meatballs tasty  gonna blow away but being able feed two people $36 pretty awesome  <EOR> 3 5 stars    $15 Champagne Brunch  Deal deal deal    It's hit miss but food really isn't bad  Some entrees may seem bit retro just ordinary but tasty does job full chance try different foods fill drinks!
