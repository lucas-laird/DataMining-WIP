Outstanding food bunnies logos! gastro pub concept exactly new but worried  Things started off badly when wait almost twenty minutes table even though reservation  But retrospect more sign place's popularity its lack preparedness  food service made more  suggest ordering multiple small plates share  shrimp scallops flat bread cauliflower agnolotti pasta wonderful dessert ice cream pistachios  Check menu online better descriptions ordered  Everything absolutely delicious interesting too  only critique muster flat bread quite cooked enough taste  spouse thought perfect though  Drinks spot would hope gastro pub  overall easy five stars  The manager stopped several times apologize wait  <EOR> Sat bar Friday night before hitting show down hall House Blues great start evening  toss between Stripsteak picked Libertine expecting little more variety little less sticker shock not sure variety part came through but overall think reasonably priced meal STRIP $160 two people having 4 drinks appy mains    What had Scotch Olives favorite overall lamb sausage brought robust NOT gamey flavor paired perfectly acidity green olives Libertine burger excellent cheese tomato carmelized onions sauce each stand quality own bringing together incredible flavor profile  asked medium rare came medium++ scallops cooked properly tender juicy all overdone but missed element nice pan carmelization  Sauce non descript posting two days later can't remember anything sauce except white sauce roasted cauliflower heirloom tri colored cauliflower nut based crunchy topping very satisfying well scallops Beverages some ways cocktail menu really robust but moment hubby struggled identify anything wanted drink pitcher drinks quite impressive looking ordered Paloma bottled site very kitchy cute good but probably would try something else next time Manhattan hubby liked it needed pick drink before going concert 'off menu' ordered two Irish Coffees terrific whipped cream made fresh order true mixologist performance putting drinks together couldn't tasted better!!    Pros atmosphere great cool lighting wall decorations slightly retro'd feel furnishings bar stools really comfy service I only speak bar service well orchestrated across team well cared without being intrusive nailed service Irish Coffee   Cons Yes steep price tag overall $160 gastropub dinner two but don't think much better pricing strip when you're getting type quality food + atmosphere burger over cooked per order we didn't ask them fix juicy toppings compensated enough over done meat <EOR> So tried place other night  Charles server he great  starting food because  why restaurants    We ordered ahi tuna cones Parmesan churros foie gras pate green kale salad  45 days dry age rib eye bone charcoal corn whiskey bread pudding  Ahi tuna bomb! Parmesan churros look nice but tasted bland enough cheese salt  Foie gras pate would good but tasted watered down much cream which no Bueno because love foie gras barely tasted it   Kale salad bomb don't ordering kale salads  you guess made ordered that rib eye point! menu ask  Charcoal corn also tasted bomb! bread pudding though dry bland  need work that    They're still new would give them another shot  Charles server great  atmosphere ambiance whatever want call ok but music way loud felt yell girl sometimes hear me  lol <EOR> Ordered beer snack during happy hour The fingerling potatoes sous vie egg featured undercooked crunchy potatoes never good some soggy ham all enhanced wet egg  Overall happy happy hour  which btw did any discounted prices  I'd skip if looking haute cuisine Mandalay Bay <EOR> After reading mainly five star reviews decided give relatively new restaurant try  atmosphere great food phenomenal  Libertine Burger probably best burgers ever had  food came relatively quick service awesome especially server Karen   Definitely deserves all great reviews currently has  <EOR> Not impressed  Typical don't very good attitude because few repeat costumers  Menu looked great but!

But bunnies looked cute! Maybe Stay Wild sign? But rest seemed tame! lighting nice but tables plain   We also group six sat table meant 4 restaurant bustling  just little confusing  All place mats touched each other's zero spacing between anyone  didn't think through? You're seating 6 people birthday dinner squish little table! Luckily fast clearing courses table because could only fit 1 2 dishes time even then tight fit  drinks also perched precariously edge table because lack space  only 2 people drinking! rest space taken water   Luckily most food tasty nicely presented  wouldn't recommend any vegetable dishes though  Those salty  ahi cones oxtail crostini tastiest dishes albeit pricey  very awesome adding extra cone ahi dish 6 person dish instead 5  very nice them no extra charge  cute delicious!  Service great fast! brought birthday dish friend even though charged I find charging birthday dessert tacky since most give free least priced discount   P  S  bathroom freaking gigantic!  Oh yeah sure take picture bunny angel outside!  Maybe few kinks fixed place could better! <EOR> During six night stay Mandalay Bay wife three dinners bar Libertine Social  bartenders friendly very knowledgeable menu  shared small plates each dinners  hamachi cones Thai spare ribs favorites but gnudi also terrific   The restaurant's energy feel really nice somewhat energetic but loud  conversation bar at least week nights anyway looked DJ Friday    The beer selection very good some really nice draft cocktails  Did mention hamachi cones? Mmmm  <EOR> Food quality good  Wait staff failed order party member entrée side dish  Excuse first table evening  Very slow service failure staff deliver completed dishes  <EOR> Fiancé appetizers celebrate engagement  spicy tuna cones braised oxtail crostini beef tartare porchetta  beef tartare tasted mustard wasn't crazy one  weren't crazy cocktail menu just dirty martinis  Mine tasted added sweet vermouth something orange flavored  Kinda weird but hey complain martini  ordered second asked did add vermouth server said don't add vermouth  Idk tasted weird first one  Service started kinda slow but once going everything great wait staff didn't leave dirty plate table more 2 seconds  very attentive  Would definitely come back try other items  three other apps besides tartare all must orders  still salivating over tuna cones  <EOR> I town business customer mine vegan yelped vegan yelp place sowed delight served variety dishes some meat enjoyed meal customer lived town never heard place said new place go  <EOR> I wanted give place 5 stars but James Beard award winner came short  told server show 1 5 hours time sat yet saw delays every step way  Overall food point hamachi beef tartare hummus branzino chicken filet well prepared  Skip kale salad  send back because wilted yellowing leaves over compensated much dressing  Excellent atmosphere  <EOR> I looking place some quick bites drinks while Mandalay Libertine looked perfect spot   wasn't looking long sit down dinner just sat bar ordered   The mixologists very friendly fast   extensive mixed drink menu drinks nice strong   passed time waiting food playing funny card game bartender before knew food there    We started tuna cones which awesome   perfect little savory bites good sharing   house baked pretzel also surprisingly good very addictive cheddar fondue    The grilled octopus looked absolutely amazing but some freak accident water ended spiling plate!  Without hesitation server took plate away brought back new dish awesome service   worth wait octopus delicious   Overall food drinks great very reasonably priced relative other restaurants Mandalay   If looking good casual meal drinks then definitely stop Libertine  <EOR> I would say 4 stars little generous  Everything sounded great but lamb shank severely under seasoned celery root puree also bland as might expect combo poor  Pomegranate seeds added little did sauce  recommended server hope just mistake other dishes better  <EOR> What amazing find here! Libertine offers many varieties liquor cocktails creative fresh seasonal salads incredibly delicious entrees  pea prosciutto salad goat cheese ravioli BBQ carrots truffle mashed potatoes must bone in short rib wagyu flat iron  Everything delicious service impeccable attentive without being pretentious    The table next ordered 3 desserts made heart tummy swoon but ordered way much delicious food couldn't spare another square inch tummies  Highly recommend restaurant libation good hearty eats   Reservations recommended but walk hours just before 7pm seemed just fine busy weekend multiple large events Vegas  restaurant also Open Table friendly  those points!! <EOR> I comment food only drinks   say drinks pricey but strong   margarita signature bottled cocktails   also local beer tap   good spot sit people watch  <EOR> Excellent service!
