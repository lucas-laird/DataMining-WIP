Think wee bit pricier cousin McCormick Schmick's   shade before 7pm able take advantage happy hour which included any 2 beers $7 $7 appetizers popcorn shrimp fried calamari sushi plate which consisted 5 pieces nigiri   exactly big bang buck but still less regular price       They wide selection fish prepared numerous ways   actually took while finally pick entrees   blackened pacific mahi mahi side mac cheese roasted ratatouille   wife wasabi crusted ahi tuna   Both entrees awesome friends enjoyed few minutes spent theirs before inhaling them   buddies actually mixed rice pilaf mac cheese said great   Weirdo    It's true past reviews portions fish could definitely bigger price   wife's ahi tuna suitable filet portion but felt should've more more mahi mahi plate plate   But 25% off total bill locals players card certainly softens financial blow wallet     The service fine overall staff great knowledge menu able narrow down choices us   Lots guests seafood pasta dishes all looked great   funny thing end meal servers accidentally threw leftover food boxed up   chef decided cook all again pack whole new entree go   Also check chalkboard open kitchen entree drink specials   noticed afterwards serving barracuda cue music orange glaze   would've given shot known  <EOR> My boyfriend treated all 6 winning luckily slots  dungeness crab legs which dry didn't taste fresh   expected since Vegas desert  $30+ though    pretty pricey meat dry  bf enjoyed sushi plate  Everybody something different sides good  But ordered garlic fries side regular fries  Sigh  Nothing great restaurant great enough would come back  <EOR> Just walked roaming through Rio actually looking buffet but much much happier fud place! don't enough promotion  food absolutely delicious drinks too!

Second good seafood restaurant should menu  printed daily list whatever fish fresh   On food   bouillabaisse which wasn't bad   However hoping cioppino which no longer menu was fantastic    Overall food ok but definitely better seafood available Vegas  <EOR> this favorite restaurants   every year husband's birthday order surf turf   both shrimp lobster well done watery fabulous! best cooked steaks ever  it's huge restaurant but seating enough space cramped atmosphere waiters very pleasant   watch activities pool while eating   reservations suggested  <EOR> This place lot room improve  nice location but service food good  Sunday evening group 5 busy plenty open seating choose where wanted sit  would expect waited promptly! waited long time before even being greeted server  friend ordered coffees never refilled nor offered refills appetizer crab cakes very small but very tasty  finished bread appetizers coffee we're still waiting entrees! When finally arrived mine even very hot  macadamia crusted halibut delicious even if luke warm  Once meals never saw server again till he came clear plates  He rude unprofessional friend thought meal said came glass wine server threw fit quickly grabbed menu prove only said suggested pairing instead tactfully just explaining mistake  He also acted irritated when asked split checks  He should asked party 5 sitting couples beforehand anyway   would recommend wasting time many other great places choose area  disappointed wasted time eating here  <EOR>
