Earl Sandwich Palms casino way cheaper same damn restaurant! being inside casino no excuse  sure why more expensive here  could ordered nice dinner Cheesecake Factory instead mediocre fast food  Only reason ate cause nearby starving   Also outrageous prices would think could hire more employees give better faster service  only two people working  Just person making food working register  poor workers looked overwhelmed amount orders coming in  10 people behind when ordering  took 25 minutes food first line! Everyone ordered even wondered hell going on  here's freaking tipoff  paying $45 some basic bland sandwiches waiting long course order wrong! made wrong sandwiches    offered remake food but point pissed off waiting long said forget just took gave because going wait another 25 minutes  No apology compensation them either   Do yourself favor save your time money don't eat here  don't even see hype is  Capriotti's way better  eat if want good sandwiches take your money eat nicer restaurant instead paying such high price FAST FOOD place  Never eating again  <EOR> My husband ate absolutely LOVED it  Earl's Club wheat bread  nice size sandwich hot even  walking back room  staff extremely nice friendly  would definitely recommend trying place when if come back absolutely eat again <EOR> Came Monday night around 9 ordered turkey sandwich sauce side Cobb salad without cucumber dressing side  tomato bisque  order came quick    And order came exactly ordered    I used tomato bisque dip sandwich tasted pretty good way better burrito place across way    Cobb salad tasted surprisingly fresh    And tomato bisque good too <EOR> SO SLOW!!!  Very cheap meat  thought place would  wonderful extremely hungry   roast beef came very raw  good  Ended going La Gloria instead  <EOR> A friend said Earls tasty sandwich   Stayed Caesars 5 days found them Food Court   pricey but think Caesars doing jacking rent just review food    I ordered sandwich potato salad   eh okay   Nothing memorable made want back   thought meat also rather light   more bread anything   absolutely LOVE onions shocked learn any all put your sandwich if wanted it   friend deal breaker   cannot live without onions especially sandwich! <EOR> Not good had   Located Caesars Palace food court right around corner when off parking structure elevator you'll find sandwich joint  second to  main although far Downtown Disney  haven't chance try Planet Hollywood which heard much compare Disney   It's part food court just walk through window sit wherever want  fountain drinks communal but luckily locations right next restaurant window  Bottled drinks salads pastries near counter if want order them well   I pretty much only know love Chicken Chipotle Avocado tried that  sub sandwich strips chicken bacon avocado slices chipotle sauce  love Disney location but some reason just didn't taste good  also Montague didn't much either    Maybe try if haven't before but if Planet Hollywood Downtown Disney try those instead  <EOR> It's good but something can't LA! When you're Vegas eat something only Vegas! pass now on  two most popular subs  good but great! If quality meat fresh ingredients dont think you'll it  If you're into overload condiments your sub guess you'll actually it  <EOR> This review particular location inside Caesar's Palace   preferred location Planet Hollywood even long lines which move quickly sometimes hard find seating   The PH location gets five stars stop least once every Vegas trip sometimes twice   Caesar's location whatever reason more expensive $10 per sandwich vs  $7 doesn't many options   find different sauces mustards PH location Tabasco A1 Dijon mustard but don't any Caesar's spot   If happen hungry while area fine but would much rather PH Earl   The PH location also electronic buzzers let know when your food ready   Caesar's just shout your name thanks crowded food court noisiness  <EOR> I ordered 4 sandwiches  2 Tuna Melt 1 Original 1 Montague  All sandwiches bread meh worst   not toasted  Both Tuna Melt sandwiches no cheese basically just bread tuna  QC here???  I looking forward eating Earl's because still reminisce Orlando Florida next Disney World  smell fresh baked bread brownies  Ahhhhh     The star nice lady cash register  <EOR> I ordered veggie sandwich honestly say worst sandwich ever had  just mush inside bread  None ingredients seemed each other  Service impersonal  NEVER AGAIN  Complete waste money  <EOR> Go planet Hollywood Earl's  Its much cheaper wait isn't long  Still next forums which nice but small sandwich isn't worth $10 16 here   Full montagu sandwich which very good choice sandwich  <EOR> We love eating place  chicken sandwich avocado favourite sandwich  tried all sandwiches  menu all good  very filling  <EOR> I recommend ordering hot sandwich over cold sandwich   Cold sandwiches premade sitting waiting purchased therefore taste soggy  Hot sandwiches seem made order bread sogy <EOR> First time eating place general  $9 99 sandwich extra almost $6 little bag chips soft drink   not worth! sandwich itself pretty good Earl's club little but packed sandwich! If know another location cheaper prices wouldn't gone here  <EOR> I meant try 24hr ion Miracle Mike alas time away me  end Ceasar's food court ton people  line rather long  Kim traveling companion did grab salad smart move  waited order sandwich combo 14 99 fountain drink chips  good but better cheaper! <EOR> DO COME HERE!  If want eat earl sandwich other location inside planet Hollywood  Something place just sucks definitely doesn't taste same  overcharge sandwiches  Scammmmm  other location!!!!!! <EOR> I've heard lots hype place decided visit location closest Caesar Palace food court only person ahead line 9pm server counter courteous  sandwiches however only decently good but good fix late dinner    My biggest complaint sandwiches Caesar Palace location uniformly priced $9 50 which priciest sandwich ever had! <EOR> Way way way overrated overpriced! Chipotle Chicken Avocado okay  Nothing special  no wow factor  Just ordinary sandwich any other sandwich chains  Totally worth $15 soft drink chips included   even gourmet  Next  <EOR> Very disappointing! Pricey very little meat   Subway puts more meat sandwiches! <EOR> This Earl same original Planet Hollywood just    no lines!  Came Mariah Carey's show surprisingly found Earl ate no hesitant    I always original sandwich  tried some other ones none them made want order twice   One negative point only give tiny water cone water if want drink lot water buy water bottle water dispenser multiple times fill your water cone  <EOR> Hawaiian BBQ really good   But honestly line long all other sandwiches tasted better version subway  Sure quality taste decent but $8 each Id rather somewhere else   Overall barely recommend  <EOR> This Earl Sandwich Caesar's Food Court  I gone Earl Sandwich Planet Hollywood many times decided give try since staying right across street   BAD IDEA   Seems menu selection less food definitely more expensive all sandwiches $10+ just flat didnt taste good   Earl's club which always but bread slightly overdone which threw off whole sandwich   more expensive price probably left bad taste mouth well =P  One pro location no line 11am Saturday     Unfortunately if eating Earl Sandwich Vegas again going Planet Hollywood   Its worth walk wait   Don't wrong sandwich still good but comparing PH just same  <EOR> Pretty good sandwiches  really liked turkey holiday sandwich  Feels eating thanksgiving  Love reminder   never bad sandwich although awhile boring  But crisp bread pretty anything taste good   sides other hand really needs improvement  <EOR> Typical Earl Sandwich Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich which really good  pleasantly surprised quick service ordered 10 sandwiches think only waited little over 5 minutes them! <EOR> It's reasonably priced sandwich 9 49 but your total quickly adds if want chips $2 49 drink $4 49! 3 came around $50  sandwich good  ordered Hawaiian Chicken Bbq but anything more special another sandwich chain  sandwich also seemed bit small side $9 49  <EOR> The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich only sandwich order yummers! only gripe location service seems super slow! weren't nearly many people located Planet Hollywood but seemed take just long food come out! think PH location tastes better lol if all possible  But I'd definitely coming back PH location cheap quick bite eat while strip! <EOR> Don't here  nothing against people very friendly nice  bought chicken wrap knowing wouldn't cheap because vegas ok that  wasn't ok fact only 3 small pieces chicken  don't mean full chicken chopped chicken 3 small pieces  Really wtf really aren't making enough money where rip people off that  aware plenty other places eat vegas where don't shorted happen me   might well call veggie wrap  <EOR> I always liked Earl Sandwich very tasty sandwiches fresh ingredients quality meats   hot Montague favorite  leave off mustard add mayo delish! But lose star because location Caesar's Palace expensive  <EOR> First time ever going Earl Sandwich  Saw Holiday Sandwich which sounded kind Capriotti's Bobby sandwich  ITS AWFUL! Couldn't even finish it  stuffing mush  turkey no taste  Don't even bother  Oh price three times size Capriotti's  Disgusted  <EOR> Honestly ordinary sandwich nothing crazy Hawaiian BBQ sandwich pineapple made sweet good sandwich size half subway sandwich ranged $9 alright don't see myself going back  <EOR> Good stuff!  After watching Celine Dion dream come true hungry food court nearby  Enter Earl Sandwich  cashier very sweet order ready no time  sandwiches pricier side but well prepared quality ingredients definitely used  bread fresh perfectly toasty outside while being soft within  Everyone enjoyed sandwiches flavors point  Since located food court more enough seating available  <EOR> Same Earl Sandwich Planet Hollywood any other Earl but without line   It's inside Caesars casino right when come forum shops   quite walk inside casino may inconvenient if just coming location eat   For some reason Earl no line many workers tons place sit food court   Since food court if your friends don't want eat Earl there's plenty other choices too   If first time recommend Earl's Sandwich   haven't disappointed other items offer packed pasta salad  <EOR> Best Earl's location !!   Reasonably priced sandwiches they're good around $7 9 My favorite Full Montague Chipotle Chicken Sandwich also good  Eat Tabasco if wanna add little more flavor  Sometimes sandwich could taste little dry  <EOR> When order food pay $10 sandwich then wrong don't rude it  your fault mine if don't working food service should sure quit something actually enjoy    Having eaten Earl Sandwich many times just location expected same quality service received other locations  case  extremely disappointed would rude talk customers another way did today when messed order  location returning to  <EOR> $10 80 sandwich?!

I decided order soup Broccoli cheddar 1492 sandy brown bread  soup very think cheesy very small bits broccoli  average side okay but nothing stellar 2 75 5  sandwich not huge actually decently good healthy serving roast beef creamy horseradish sauce  Expectations lowered I'd say adequately content but wouldn't consider memorable meal  Overall solid 3 5   Personally prefer Jimmy Johns Firehouse subs  Earl Sandwich more Earl Ordinary me! <EOR> This place alright because wait long  Sandwiches good but gonna say worlds greatest haha  basically $10 sandwich $3 extra add drink chips  Everything expensive Vegas just buy if you're debating  <EOR> Paid $10 overpriced bland salad  could least grilled damn chicken  Tastes right fridge <EOR> So earl sandwich touted some high mighty sub shop but gotta say walking into express version Quiznos less options super duper slow disorganized The bread crap ingredients crap sandwich more hurl earl   Lammmmme! <EOR> Good chipotle chicken avocado sandwich  Unfortunately place whole wall version limited choices  Still tasty!
