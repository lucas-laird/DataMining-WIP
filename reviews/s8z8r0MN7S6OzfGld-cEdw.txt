Overall wouldn't mind coming back  <EOR> Twenty bleached blonde surgically enhanced 'exotic dancers' parading past table wasn't menu but did waiting food slightly less painful     We first allured into place since way restroom between watching Greg lose more money Let Ride Luxor   Minh spotted sign indicated $4 menu showed labeled crispy mashed potato sticks something nature   Basically twinkie sized tator tots chives bacon spiral sour cream outside them $4 YESH PREAZE   After few more trips lot more free beers decided check place appetizers prior waiting rest group arrive Vegas     First ordered cucumber salad can't resist some cucumber which $6 disappointment   Probably half cucumber sliced very thin almost thin crunch sesame seed oil top    all   would fine $3 but $6     Minh ordered mashed potato sticks ordered kobe sliders B ordered dirty fries recommendation hostess   Mashed potato sticks basically billed although none recalled tasting any bacon     kobe sliders actually very nice definitely use Hawaiian bread next time cook sliders butter lettuce nice touch too!   But best all dirty fries cajun spiced fries drizzled muenster cheese thick chunks bacon extremely tasty   Was enough hit place back dinner larger group     The only thing really ordinary experience line must two dozen we ASSUME strippers dbag escorts tables behind us   significantly slowed down service table but most didn't mind watching sorry Ann      In end slightly overpriced some slightly over salted food but lot nice flavors presentation excellent   come think never did see $4 menu    <EOR> This place everything you'd want restaurant except good food service   Wife organic chicken breast all accounts skin still provide soft rubbery joy every bite she made only two bites called quits I ordered fish chips debacle  didn't think would possible mess such simple dish but managed exceed wildest dreams   The fish turned into long half inch half inch sticks sorts strong fishy smell   This accompanied called waffle fries  only which receiving them did understand quotes waffle fries literally pieces waffle breakfast waffle made assume potato puree something  fail   So food bad service? Nothing being served sub par food being left waiting server come back end nightmare check  Server bus folk finally come only ask finished?  you'd think place staff would know ask things food if both people full plates barely touched   the answer no finish  we're very glad came  because now know better  <EOR> I turned off immediately when hostess tried steer crowded smokey bar eat   Sat near vacant dining section eat flavorless pulled pork sandwich $14    Washed down eight dollar draft beer! <EOR> The only reason Luxor see Criss Angel show which total waste money   Company actually served really good food hostess hooked free entrance entire group 10 club LAX   say hookup really nice considering 9 guys   No ever wants let guys free   especially little Asian guys since can't really drink much before turning red throwing up   club must really hurting   but back Company food service both excellent highly recommend Kobe sliders came sweet Hawaiian bread spiced fries pork sandwich YUM YUM YUM <EOR>
