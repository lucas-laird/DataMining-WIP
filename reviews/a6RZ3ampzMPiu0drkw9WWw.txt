However would recommend place if you're just looking quiet decent quick meal  <EOR> Cozymel's ok place terms food  great yet awful merely decent  beef burrito say least mediocre  reviewer said best if Vegas skip Cozymel's find another place found Cozymel's both expensive underwhelming  positive note Cozymel's very nice atmosphere  Also next Hamada Japan  <EOR> Had good dinner Cozymels   Loved fact reasonably priced since off strip   Also loved fact Diet Coke   Everywhere else Vegas serves Pepsi icky!!!  salsa great but chips left funny aftertaste  think oil using past its prime   Anyway starving really didn't matter   ordered chicken fajitas portion perfect   much little   Everyone else enjoyed meals well   Service little slow but would back   sure grab mint your way lime flavored  <EOR> Ok call picky bitch but because born raised Los Angeles am very discriminating when comes Mexican food  know Mexican food damn it  son half Mexican  ex Mexican in laws  watch Mexican soccer yell goooooolazo golazo! azo! azo! azo! too  know what's up  place type place take people scurrred try REAL Mexican food tongue your plate?!    place doesn't even serve tripa lengua cabeza   you won't find Mexicans here!  authentic me  Authentic place serves aforementioned body parts yum bottomless horchata   when came place didn't even horchata  WTF  <EOR> I tried Cozymel's recommendation parents   Living San Diego never chain Mexican places just many other places try   expecting Cozymel's okay nothing great   We lunch happy see whole page lunch specials $8   Usually enchilada combo plate could set back close $15 Mexican chain   during lunch least      I ordered taco salad black beans instead meat   came enormous flour tortilla shell tostada style   excellent   ingredients very fresh just right amount everything  chips salsa also fresh delicious no gigantic pieces cilantro salsa yay!    Others ordered seared chicken burrito tortilla soup enchilada plate   Everyone thought everything surprisingly good   service fine   Sign email list $10 off   Cozymel's great if you're looking something reasonably priced healthy ish depending order instead stuffing yourself Vegas buffet!  I'd return  <EOR> Cozymel's great restaurant but food mediocre menu selection isn't great however Cozymel's few 3 star ratings I'd recommend visit because fun restaurant great service food comfortable   If you're Vegas few days need new place eat drop Cozymel's   If you're short trip take advantage world class dining Las Vegas skip place  <EOR> I'll raise Cozymel's 3 star 3 1 2 star rating because dessert   More later    It's probably over 10 years since ate once tourist   driving heading familiar place decided give try something different   glad did   standard Tex Mex   food could use little more spice but assume directing seasoning toward people want Tex Mex flavor without any zing   Chips salsa completely average   salsa tasted came bottle Pace salsa nothing special there   entree Pork Rostistado spicy verde sauce menu says   meal came rice black beans some cheese sprinkled beans some great sauteed vegetables zucchini carrots standard container tortillas  spicy verde sauce well wasn't spicy   plain black beans more zing verde sauce   asked server some Cholula dish took spicier flavor more way it   pork very tasty all good meal   Of course going different place means try dessert just see if place up   Banana Napoleon highly recommended server   layers banana pudding sweetened fried tortilla squares fresh bananas whipped cream  She right   superb but way big!  OK made sacrifice finished no waste food me   Service excellent   server delightful young woman very attentive she brought refills iced tea promptly without having request it   I'll returning   OK place Tex Mex nice atmosphere different selection some menu items  <EOR> Delish carnitas soft tacos lunch  definitely recommend deck nice day  <EOR> Decent prices medicore food  scallop shrimp enchilada black beans rice which wasn't bad any means but know full feeling sticks around even hours your meal?? Yep this  took leftovers back hotel but couldn't bring myself eat them because didn't want feel way again   The mojito while essentially flavorless I kinda taste mint supposed muddled into drink still pretty strong    The atmosphere warm odd but seemed almost southern  in its decor whittled wooden chairs tables coupled tropical leaved plants adobe esque colors  Hunh  place would run but wouldn't run either  <EOR> Mmmmmmmmmmmmm yummy! Having lived Vegas almost 4 years best Mexican restaurants  loved atmosphere decor   Service slacked little toward end but overall good time   salsa rocked world!  Black beans bomb!!! <EOR> I've restaurant many times over years  eaten wide variety dishes seven   really restaurant Restaurant Row  husband loves cancun sauce cheesy creamy seafood sauce he could happily drink straw  never any problems but then again rarely adjustments selection  frequently restaurant when participated www restaurant com certificate program  Sad no longer participate program  manager Tony come recognize us  also really ambiance  staff very good    My favorite dish Fajitas Grandes tortillas guacamole sour cream pico de gallo beans rice roast pork shrimp beef chicken  good  roast pork best ever tasted Hawaii many times many luaus  saying lot since normally eat pork regular basis  delicious portion generous I usually ask to go box   order dish two people  husband's favorite dish seafood burrito yummy aforementioned cancun sauce does come beans rice  before very good but keep ordering fajitas  other dishes don't wrong but favorites   This restaurant Happy Hour does catering too  looked catering menu online looked reasonable  would definitely consider restaurant catering service  <EOR> Good mexican food not great but place away tourists which when going business      Service good margs quite tasty well  <EOR> Yeah rock solid 3 stars  Nothing great nothing horrible just middling place   I take clients sometimes since close office relatively inexpensive take group 12+ most people enjoy generic Mexican food  usually win win part   They lots standard dishes nothing which tried stands out  Happy hour means 1 2 price beers even dining area which always helpful expense report budget    They actually serve 32oz at least believe 32oz Blanca Carta bottle  felt embarrassed when ordered it  Felt needed little paper bag  But luckily everyone else enjoying themselves didn't feel self conscious    Service 2 stars  don't above beyond but don't necessarily ignore most time   But yes take while someone's attention  <EOR> First time guest  Great food tacos tamales  favorite salsa but chips fantastic  Order churros carmel strawberry dip! Very impressed  return again  <EOR> I highly recommend margarita sampler   disappointed     If you're going Happy Hour  best since every time HH frustrated waiting waitress sit bar just leave   entrees similar Chili's Chevy other Mex Tex Mex Fare   Nothing particularly special unique but bad either  <EOR> Meh   only  hours border  Find real deal while Vegas  plenty spots  Don't waste your taste buds here  You're missing anything special other friendly staff  <EOR> I finally tried Cancun Enchiladas which cheese scallops shrimp pico de gallo Cancun sauce   thought died hangover heaven   Wow   absolutely delish   Simple but tasty     The banana crisp dessert NO joke   servers always recommended finally tried it   almost cheesecake meets banana pudding nilla wafers   Very gooooood  <EOR> Yeah yeah yeah    I hear you     the food best ever but gotta admit guacamole order your table downright heavenly  am sure why other reviewers felt drinks sub par   maybe am just lightweight when comes alcohol but thought margaritas yummy    Bottom line Cozymel's getting 4 stars patience exhibited when myself group girlfriends held impromptu bachelorette pre party party bar  Take 6 drunk LOUD obnoxious girls add naughty bachelorette cake assorted naughty party gifts could potentially 4 alarm fire your hands  bartender waitress good sports he even came behind bar bit wish bride to be well  Awwwww        PS Plus gave some free appetizers too!!!! Ummmm maybe help soak some alcohol     ? <EOR> Fair food fair price   Unless you're drinking alcohol you'd hard pressed spend over $50 2 if you're fuller 80 lb zit faced kid Wynn buffet  <EOR> I late lunch Cozymel's today very disappointing experience   The service extremely slow eventhough only 3 other tables occupied   waitress seemed very disinterested moved very slow didn't watch over floor   She never came around asked food nor check drinks which most table finished waited long finished meals ready pay check   Speaking which still left waiting long someone look around restaurant bill she never did see wave her    The food very mediocre Americanized Mexican food   meat over cooked very little seasoning sauces strangely bland would expect Mexican restaurant   side beans salty barely edible  side 'famous' Mex slaw merely garnish which good thing because also lacking flavor except overwhelming amount raw onions   very disappointed love coleslaw   I left restaurant unsatisfied feeling bit sick   felt bad because took coworkers me   only good thing found nice outdoor dining patio      I would rather Baja Fresh Chipotle better tasting lunch half price  <EOR>
