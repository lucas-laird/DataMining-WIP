Pretty good service Even though waitress Ashley didn't show food delivered flagged down another waitress busboy more coffee water quick!  Huge portions but food good hit miss?    Hash Browns ordered crispy awesome!  Corned Beef Hash LOOKED really good thick chunks shredded beef but absolutely NO taste!  disappointed   Denver Omelette pretty tasty but came done vs  soft as ordered    Coffee good vs  watered down stuff other places   Saw Taco Salad must've size soccer ball!!! <EOR> Pleasantly surprised better expected first time Black Bear Diner  Coffee strong smooth  Orange juice freshly squeezed definitely taste good!  Everything tasted made fresh order no complaints here! <EOR> So    say all glitters gold  tried diner again breakfast indicated earlier review unfortunately did live previous visit  expectations definitely met   To start wait L O N G time table  Then when seated gave table six when only needed room four  assume  took long  Before ordered observed two individuals arrived paying check yet order  long wait mean   Then specifically asked waitress waffles crispy? She says yes  ordered crispy waffle  Now when waffles arrives think crispy? already know wasn't  PROBLEM principle she knows NO way crispy waffle restaurant  Why ask? Because personalized waffle maker which bear paw imprint into center waffle  however prevents waffle ever becoming crispy because insufficient ridges which generate crispiness during cooking process thereby rendering product waffle shaped pancake generally flat middle  Thus waitress mislead don't another item selected already event she would truthful said no restaurant serves waffle shaped pancakes  mad  really wanted Crispy Waffle  order waffles if think they're going crispy because disappointed was   Now daughter ordered pineapple upside down pancakes  also misrepresented  description menu indicated would brown sugar marinated pineapple chunks inside fluffy waffles maraschino cherry  no brown sugar marination pancakes  fluffy but taste pineapple did penetrate normal pancake batter no sugar should just called pineapple topped pancakes   My other daughter ordered crispy chicken sandwich  Now crispy chicken sandwich actually very delicious  Hence reason giving them two stars   So ask would come again? Yes  However would only eat lunch sandwiches burgers good breakfast much dinner's seemed really heavy which kind food  <EOR> First time because heard lot good things restaurant decided give try  food just okay asked if turkey bacon sausage but didn't any other substituon people cant bacon pork sausage religion reason  Then come worst service Barbara beginning wasn't very attentive  Literally she just take order drop check  Hello where service? She never came take away empty plates refill drink  Then when asked water refill she brought new WITHOUT STRAW but yet biggest attitude  end she comes drop check nowhere found  She gut rush husband trying take plates away still food it  when asked another server togo box food since server nowhere found again server wasnt happy asked maybe because she thought wasnt table  All all servers need improve customer service skill maybe common sense  People come good meal good service experience look angry n mad faces your servers  If dont your job stay home please people dont deserve experience your unhappiness  <EOR> We LOVE Black Bear Diner!!! food great  especially love Chicken Pot Pie Chicken Waffles  pies good  good value service always good   I'm only taking star because 3 6 visits given dirty silverware  pretty unappetizing pick your unused fork see somebody else's dinner still stuck it  <EOR> Management location off charts positive   someone else remarked really Las Vegas experience but solid breakfast dishes no bargains   Wish would fix dress outside front entrance   Staff clearly trained under thumb management   return but many other great breakfast options Vegas     Pik attached plain omelette big portion   tax $12+tip  <EOR> My family restaurant food high quality delicious portions big but food Heaven actually served real hand squeezed orange juice ordered Grizz food much could feed least two more people end all all best restaurant ever give 5 stars <EOR> Always good food Tropicana location   same location  count Black Bear deliver great food no matter eat  location clean   Staff professional egar please  back <EOR> Mike server     best server Vegas some time  First time visitor now new regular  Tried Denver omelette  Won't ordering anyone else's again  Great service  Great music <EOR> I work restaurant business most important thing customer service first impression    let tell place it  far food your typical breakfast food nothing ordinary definitely bad either!!! staff super nice made sure helped!
