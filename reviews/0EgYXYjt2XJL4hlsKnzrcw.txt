<EOR> We stopped twice Saturday Sunday both times around Noon brunch   The location tiny bit hard find  literally corner Fremont Maryland Parkway but signage very difficult spot  Parking abundant close by  space feels great  felt fun clean casual    The service very friendly prompt  feel servers might need little more exposure drinks food serve provide better feedback customers when asked something is  But whole servers great really considerate your experience sure things improve   We Corned Beef Hash Hot Cross Bun Salmon Egg Toast omelette panko crusted egg salad thingie  All food very good delicious   The menus could use little work  If servers can't provide detailed descriptions all your items then menu needs little more self explanatory    But all all super good place hang drink some coffee concoctions chill  You'll good time  <EOR> Really enjoyed experience  Delicious 3 beet salad cappuccino    also need soup which delicious   Service friendly quick  Loved it <EOR> Such hidden treasure love food atmosphere  Super friendly EXCELLENT food coffee  <EOR> I've heard cafe little while decided finally check boyfriend  walked view incredibly refreshing  When look center could see baristas making coffee cashier grabbing pastries ringing guests few other staff members handling food stocking having light conversations each other   My boyfriend greeted friendly cashier  When he found first time he happily jumped side explained food beverage menus us  iced macadamia nut paste latte almond milk boyfriend shaken almond latte  sat down table number took moment look around   The tables windows each tree center them  bunch other tables scattered throughout place without looking clustered messy  drinks came out however boyfriend wanted add syrup cashier gave free rather charging most places yay!   Both drinks delicious would recommend macadamia nut paste latte way shaken almond latte vanilla syrup definitely beautiful peaceful place anyone come just unwind stress  <EOR> Starbucks would open location downtown neighborhood clearly attempt duplicate experience  However prices much higher Starbucks  just paid $7 00 including tip very small cup tea  asked cashier why tea expensive he told high prices deter neighborhood residents low incomes  Apparently only want cater wealthy hipster community  <EOR> My first visit just okay second way better write review! husband gone coworkers said best breakfasts he's long time he take back he breakfast sandwich side pork belly   I macadamia nut latte which yummy  tiny bits nuts expect that  liked always love coffee art fancy spoon  eat avocado brûlée little caramelized but still delicious  Potatoes good sweet didn't ketchup salt pepper normally do  greens served also tasty   Husband Forbidden Rice pork belly which very good  ordering next time!

Potatoes plate skimpy less 2 ounces? small scattering mixed greens place to fill empty space? breakfast plate homemade toast nothing write home about  Bacon decent average thickness but only 2 small pieces it  $12 breakfast plate pretty bad value  should pass test serve breakfast professionally  Wow those eggs bad!  Same sides protein lunch dinner menu don't expect whole even half breast chicken show if order side  4 5 small slices sushi roll price  fell oops!  WiFi pretty fast  great  here's Easter egg any lone beer order comes complimentary side homemade paprika'd potato chips because particular liquor license possess   Unfortunately customers work only *one* single public power outlet entire restaurant *and* main picnic table style community tables disturbingly vibration prone  If anybody else seated your table feel absolutely every hand movement fork to plate elbow bump etc  other end table  know sounds totally crazy but exaggeration  I'd returning those picnic tables maker additional stability supports   BTW Makers Finders' wooden coffee bar also vibration issues don't sit either  <EOR> Great atmosphere friendly staff  sat bar window watched downtowners walk including random batman  delicious iced tea chocolate croissant  <EOR> Customer service excellent  Food excellent  Tried pork belly sandwich some sort green iced tea concoction amazing!!! Going back sure!! Oh brookie delish!!! <EOR> Very lively spacious coffee shop  Perfect groups because lots seating! Upon entering place see pastries being baked prepared windows once you're inside you're greeted lots artsy fartsy decor! guess say hipster looking really enjoyed atmosphere  clean bathrooms all decorated cute too! actually embarrassed myself bit cuz wasn't sure where inside they're SLIDING DOORS behind decorated bookshelf  Fun fact see baristas staff openly preparing everything which thought kinda cool  popular specialty iced coffees great! Forgot name but remember next time check place out  Staff friendly accommodating  ***Negative aspect place would probably aren't much outlets your computers  You'd seated corners during non busy hour prepared come full battery! But back again <EOR> What say PublicUs already stated PublicUs? paid $20 glorified Chipotle bowl small glass tea  feel charge cruise ship prices without cruise  being said everything pretty great  Freekeh Bowl spicier expected but tolerable felt healthy! Also everything scratch house  factors mind didn't take away any stars because price  Maybe doesn't blow mind when consider am getting money but knows much overhead cover such hipster paradise  Also hard truth quality ingredients cost more money    I am fan community tables but highly impressed restrooms  weird? giant sliding barn doors adore  love large windows let natural light  decor  die much parking have! would pick location over another simply because convenience knowing find spot close by  Also newbs just register order  way set looks kind order line but isn't  see huge lines standing right hand side counter sometimes unsure where start    All all 4 5 star average rating reason  Keep PublicUs! Feel free hit those discounts though <EOR> Amazing place eat chat even simply quietly read while listening background noise  <EOR> Every item ordered 7 plus mimosas incredible   Crisp tastes great blend if textures super friendly staff  could honestly live here     great upcoming location! <EOR> I found place via yelp when downtown old Vegas wanted some food wasn't completely greasy bad expensive  short drive away downtown mile area looked completely abandoned shady  weren't sure first bf kind sketchy place taking me?

I ordered vegan toast which roasted asparagus artichoke tomatoes pesto spread  only reason didn't enjoy because burnt   like edges all black extremely hard bite into but middle part good  I also brussel sprouts salad! little spicier side but loved it  Can't forget almond milk latte  lived hype!  Parking right next restaurant large lot won't problem finding parking paying! It's free! Only reason why giving them 4 stars because took awhile friends meal come out  Three different staff came check which nice but still took longer expected  burnt toast    But other everything good <EOR> Recently Vegas work stayed just few blocks adorable coffee house  decor awesome  lay nice  Seems place mostly locals nice away tourist traps  Reasonable prices  Huge servings  Would definitely back! <EOR> Cool hipster vibe cafe  Great coffee delicious food  Breakfast lunch plus great desserts pastries  Great staff  <EOR> I atmosphere coffee food  However three times already each time mixed feelings staff  ordered cappuccino first time didn't ask sugar  super picky usually pretty adaptable coffee  usually don't sugar coffee however coffee bit strong decided add some sugar   My diet isn't restricted  did ask cashier if she any sugar she blatantly replied  why asked first place if wanted sugar  She rolled eyes appeared agitated  she might bad day just demeanor comes off very snobbish  She curt did come off approachable after  continued going because did food atmosphere  second third time interactions staff fairly mixed  barista appeared unaccommodating when asked if he could pour some coffee due spilling no room place lid on  He appeared annoyed asking ruin foam decor  Service somewhat okay hopefully won't cross any more people such people encountered far  <EOR> This place literally definition aesthetic hipster loved every part it!!!
