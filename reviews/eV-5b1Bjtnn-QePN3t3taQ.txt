The place itself tucked away plaza doesn't much going on  No wonder passed without realizing existence  Anyway place SUPER clean  tell really care appearances which great    The people working also really nice fast service even during dinner rush  telling them never before waiter told proceeded take care husband quickness hospitality  man working grill also nice fast efficient    I've never fan AYCE honest since usually second plate stomach decides wants kill coming dinner mistake  All dinner AYCA lunch bowl  Lunch good enough me!  As far food see people saying wasn't lot variety but seemed plenty Mongolian BBQ noob myself  main meats turkey pork chicken beef  Chicken all way baby!    As far food quality hard rate considering charge making your own food  If suck making food choices sucks  User error  magically come across killer combo mouth explosion flavors then great    All all okay  feel wee bit expensive come dinner if aren't going scarf down lot if food but lunch price typical  Won't way eat again but worth trying least once  <EOR> After hearing Stir Krazy reopening closing Paradise location couldn't wait see new location open    It's pretty much exactly same restaurant before just new location  ambiance does benefit new location though bright inside but blinding last location could get    They great selection meats veggies everything always seemed very fresh  If aren't familiar style restaurant your server gives bowl take buffet choose your meat veggies noodle sauce whatever want  Then hand wok attendants cook up  pretty much can't wrong I'd say half fun trying stack your bowl high although $14 all you can eat there's really no need to  But when comes $9 lunch bowl challenge accepted    It's fun place we'll probably regulars here  <EOR> I absolutely love place!!!! Everyone always super nice  dine bowl  If dine dinner all eat  great variety fresh vegetables choose from  Also give option different meats choose which includes chicken beef turkey pork  few different sauces choose flavoring well ton noodles  also choice white brown rice no rice all  Everything always cooked perfection different hot sauces sweet chili sauces put top well!
