When check dropped  server left 10 minutes no where found  server coming into shift checked also looked miserable job  Never thank anything just sad! Honestly could gotten better food Olive Garden better service too  All all would waste time money place ! <EOR> I love eating Chicago Joe's when Vegas   food very good authentic Italian American cuisine   portions large very tasty!    stuffed pasta lasagna fetticine all fantastic   prices reasonable italian several other places Vegas but think food best price     The atmosphere quirky very 'old Vegas'   Everytime feel stepping into past  always imagine Frank Sinatra some old Gangsters eating there   seems 'local Italian restaurant' some pretentious place where waiter puts napkin your lap you    I think would appropriate date spot even though never date  dark there!  giggling last February because still Christmas decorations but Vegas couldn't sure if intentional   waiters casual overly friendly though last time waiter singing Strangers Night while he busing tables really enjoyed playfulness      I recommend Chicago Joe's if hungry  good italian food don't want fancy overpriced place    <EOR> Recently dinner all time favorite Italian restaurants Las Vegas  old Las Vegas sure  tiny little Mom Pop classic Italian joint old cottage downtown  Only dozen tables whole place  going years  little pricey but well worth atmosphere quality food  Very intimate great date night anniversaries romance etc  <EOR> We place recommended local referred hole wall visit   way any all tourist attractions but within walking distance Fremont Experience downtown opted try when there    We almost turned around half way walk through neighborhood appeared somewhat shady dark  small place didn't see until almost missed it  very glad didn't though   The place very small dark as all lights dimmed point hard read menu yet very cozy inviting  place wasn't exactly full but people inside which good sign decided try it   The service impeccable waiter knew menu heart could recommend specialties explain difference sauces pastas etc  opted Lasagna pasta sausage pasta clams  All dishes came warm freshly baked? bread salad own in house dressing  salad wasn't anything ordinary except very fresh but dressing awesome  When food came glad hungry!

Why did splitting check take long? Why did taking orders take long? Why bathroom L shape?  something Chicago Joe could solve but just worth asking general   Overall great experience  much better Italian places if wanted mediocre food could just OG  least cheaper breadsticks    Skip place  <EOR> Excellent food service warm environment chicken parm  piccata bottle chianti very good must try <EOR> I eaten Chicago Joes many times over years always nice meal reasonable price  howver noticed regulars bump table  called Joes tonight table 4 pm call few people confirm  Because didnt considered firm reservation thay bumped me Too bad because back ever neither friends  <EOR> I very disappointed Chicago Joe's tonight  used favorite lunch spot downtown Las Vegas me  wife Came early dinner being only second guests seated dinner service thought would some nice fresh food good service    I wrong both accounts  started off Cold stale bread dropped off table mentioning server without saying word he took away brought back some nice fresh warm bread   He never apologized just set new bread table walked away    I ordered linguine white clam sauce entrée included hunk clear plastic wrap obviously covering meal refrigerator    When showed plastic he gasped apologized wisked dish back kitchen  He did offer replace meal different choice he minimizing fact only plastic saran wrap food but mood linguine white clam sauce  remade dish just satisfactory    The silver lining whole evening wife's lasagna pretty good served hot    all said done very disappointing  <EOR> We gone years ago decent experience  decided charge things other day  Probably some worst food ever had  shrimp Parmesan just awful  cheese rubber couldn't even swallow chew it  husband literally eat anything he wouldn't even touch meat meatball spaghetti  Nothing fresh  couldn't wait place  Low behold woke night throwing shrimp eaten  if want disgusting food chance sick    eat your own risk  <EOR> I only need say few things restaurant FOOD GREAT !!!! never such good chicken Parmesan salads great also bread great   Every thing great <EOR> This great intimate place great food well used be  August 28th left feeling very very disappointed embarrassed we'd recommended friends  server terrible he only other table time  salad wilted old eggplant full loose breadcrumbs oil pasta dish dry  served 1 2 carafe wine giant beer stein  note bread delicious should've just bread wine  Fra Diavlo very very good well  6 enjoyed meal  math  Hopefully correct issues  <EOR> While west Downtown continues big implode terms hotels high end LA retail stores equally pricey 5 star restaurants now become chains Beso Koi Craft etc  place Chicago Joes hidden gem no reason change thing keep corporate beast dining   blink you'll miss location 4th Street says all Old School where all started where remain   gotta love that   My mom decided celebrate return ol' hometown mine first many Mommy dining experiences   both pride ourselves own respective culinary skills quest find worthy good eats around Valley treat   then some Chicago Joes   On advice other reviewers made reservations 6 30   entered backdoor where parking lot located only other couple seated one time living room small house   greeter joked when mentioned reservation saying gee we're going some room here   love affable equally sarcastic server    perused menu debated two appetizers try stuffed artichoke escargot cap mushrooms   asked server which he preferred   He said escargot cap mushrooms hands down but added artichoke good just lot work   Yeah agreed   wanted relax since just came work started ordering glass chianti served sweet Italian wine glass tumbler        He brought basket piping hot bread table appetizer which certainly did disappoint   sopped delicious sauce mushrooms pieces bread   salad house dressing which creamy garlic   If criticism dressing needs more garlic   mom soup which delicious creamy tomato based white navy bean pasta soup name which escapes me   nice start entrees which both ordered shrimp parmigiana   ordered mine first mom wanted ordered same but kicked herself ordering something different could try each other's dishes because  roll   Maybe during next visit we'll order same but different dish   shrimps huge prawns baked layers meat sauce cheese exactly way any parmigiana supposed served   respective dinners delicious decided save half them move toward dessert   Oh yeah all because turned around read little Dry Erase Board desserts were Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake   Stick fork done!
