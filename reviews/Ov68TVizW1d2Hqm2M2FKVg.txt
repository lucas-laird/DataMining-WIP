A decent dining experience Hard Rock based restaurant did have   weren't many eating seating without reservation fine party   ordered several appetizers which average above average including antipasti 'cutting board' some really fresh parmigiana assorted meats   eggplant dish quite good well tender tasty but mushy   I ordered Risotto con Funghi entree which served al dente which dig   balance ingredients great dish size decent   companions similar experiences dishes well spinach ravioli fettuccini penne ala vodka etc    wine list good some definite choice reds   If area hungry give shot  <EOR> Yum!  This place very pretty sleek modern looking  service pretty attentive  meal starts off nice selection bread accompanied sun dried tomato olive tampanades which tasty change plain butter  shared fried calamari appetizer  huge platter enough 3 share  Nice crispy accompanied lemon slightly spicy red sauce  husband rigatoni sausage really enjoyed it  tagliatelle seafood shrimp scallops calamari   calamari pasta bit chewy but te rest good  simple olive oil sauce green peas  waiter little annoying he seemed almost teasing ordering soda instead wine we both recently sick finishing meds but regardless reason no should made feel funny ordering alcohol   great food pretty surroundings more made though  would loved try desserts but full big portions  Recommended  <EOR> We certificate $25 00  only restriction buy 2 entrees  husband pizza spaghetti  end said did count toward entree's   considered appetizer's?  waiter nice food good but little frustrating  <EOR> dined sunday around 5pm  food okay but memorable service alright well   we started off some margherita pizza appetizer which way much just two us! pizza really good sadly probably best thing ate there  risotto special risotto filet roasted onions bf some egg noodles hand cut meat never found kind meat was  didn't say menu!   he said he though kind reminded beef stroganoff which i'd agree mine just alright  risotto nice creamy but when waiter asked if wanted any parmesan he literally covered dish parmesan  wish would just leave little dish table yourself but guess  part whole 'service' aspect dinner   out waiter nice if little cold  sometimes english bit hard understand but doesn't bother me  didn't stay dessert but overall felt alright meal  but unfortunately probably enough ever trip over eat again  <EOR> My wife Ago because Hard Rock Hotel club card promotion comp    The atmosphere nice but bit dark taste  prefer see clearly am eating    For appetizer crispy calamari  first few bites great  But bit oily  Unless really love deep fried foods would great sharing among 4 people   My wife filet mignon ribeye  filet mignon deeelicous  stuffed mushroom cheese wine sauce perfectly steak  ribeye other hand bit bland  <EOR> Just all around very good  food step Olive Garden without all you can eat salad but pricing outrageous  Totally short staffed waiter having cover half dining area himself  bussers left door patio open numerous times while sitting which let heavy bass club next door  The only reason first place because bought $50 coupon $4 which helped experience bearable  <EOR> Service bad   While walking saw hostess chewing gum which pet peeve mine 1 star instantly that   Server completely rude minus 1 star that   sat table when he asked if wanted drinks said no downhill Food good nicely portion   would 4 star if wasn't service especially Nobu just few steps away  <EOR> My brother Hard Rock see MMA fight wanted grab bite eat first  pressed time Saturday night seated booth without wait    When told waiter bit rush he made sure everything moved quickly  ordered everything once drinks appetizer entrees   The bread came drinks immediately  calamari came little soon bit undercooked  When ready entrees brought exquisite presentation   My brother chicken which looked chicken  salmon which didn't realize going red sauce over it  Ago's Italian restaurant however don't think sauce paired well fish   The overall ambiance Ago's upscale sheek  Everything drinks entrees reasonably priced  would definitely back again  <EOR> I came couple weeks ago since company place booked private dinner 300 people   think place now closed opened private parties because when Vegas June remember seeing sign where place but signs no longer there   Anyways appetizers some pasta mushrooms then raviolis which good but since don't know much Italian food can't say best ever just average   main course ordered filet mignon medium rare but seemed come more medium medium rare   filet okay but ribeye fan less taste would since filets pretty lean   can't complain since steak option dinner along other choices roast chicken breast salmon filet   think everyone table ordered filet everyone seemed pleased   Dessert came afterward excellent   provided assortment hand crafted chocolates designs them really good heck even dangerous because everyone kept going back more   If place reopen might give shot again but don't know prices like   If price reasonable would try again but if prices high would pass high end steakhouse instead  <EOR> A good selection food   Had the Prosciutto Pizza Tuna Tartare Seafood Risotto Pork Chop Halibut  Quick service  Good food   Good times  <EOR> So     my friend offered comped meal promoter   course jumped it! offered limited menu but choices offered regular menu   friend chose different items both just sub par   loungey atmosphere cool nice free but those prices would somewhere else   many dining options LV why waste your time somewhere isn't great? <EOR> Restaurant 80% empty Xmas Eve Dinner   Bad food outrageous price   However waiter hostess very good accommodating   Pretty much agree Monique M food   Hard imagine bad fuck Italian food but Ago's kitchen did just that  <EOR> I twice first time being soft opening second couple months being open   boyfriend Mervin works Pink Taco management team able try food   Lobster Spaghetti Special delicious re fired   took back because spaghetti noodles AL dente taste   Mervin Free Range Organic Chicken really good   seafood soup fabulous well strawberries almonds pastry cappuccino     second time friends all ordered different dishes rack lamb radicchio beef medallions mashed potato seafood pasta porterhouse   Everything cooked perfection great server great sense humor      average price such upscale restaurant nice decor ambiance   highly recommend anyone loves good Italian food  <EOR> In city many thousands options within 12 blocks just amazes restaurant sooooo      wrong   pretentious being tucked back Hard Rock Hotel serving less adequate fare highly inflated prices?    Our experience food just average but price value ratio waaaaaayyy disproportionate   just wasn't good   most part party stopped eating appetizers came round   If can't simple pizza Caesar salad right would think main course would better?  Oh attitude   Wow   Simple questions met snobby responses   Fine don't serve ranch dressing your fine establishment   Don't dick it   Oh if want meat sauce which had spaghetti which didn't come it then give them ef'ing sauce spare table attitude   Probably should give star but did move horrible table middle restaurant where table legs intimate your private bits         <EOR> 3 75 stars  On Friday night place lets staff home early especially when hotel concert b c place wasn't busy earlier night!? 1 server place which half full   most people left because wait  But food pretty good  course judge place its meatball meatball good best but good    If stayed HR would eat again  <EOR> Ago offers fairly good dining experience  located Hard Rock Casino Las Vegas  restaurant quiet nice decor contrast insane pool party just outside although over time restaurant gets busy    We started off several appetizers most notable which figs filled goat cheese wrapped prosciutto fantastic blend flavors  waiter whose name unfortunately escapes very helpful provided good service  restaurant manager also very helpful checking sure everything ok   We small portions pasta well including rigatoni ragu I forget meat believe buffalo which well flavored gnocchi truffle mushrooms little bit duck  latter dish may popular many people but found bit rich fond eating duck other Asian restaurants   We ended meal lamb chops which good but great grilled ribeye covered Italian herbs drizzled olive oil  steak very good    Overall solid flavorful meal nice atmosphere  <EOR> Such better options Vegas! Let just tell that   Decided try Ago since found certificate Restaurant com right before trip   Very disappointed find won't accept them sure them off site then   saving grace most FANTASTIC waiter   He seriously gave best service offered some great deals instead   Unfortunately food just meh  biggest disappointment? asked side Italian Sausage pasta he said don't Italian sausage there  WHA?? Italian restaurant doesn't Italian sausage? Just another place Vegas over priced smaller portions don't taste all great  Find yourself somewhere else   Oh try time right  right when Rehab closed day found ourselves bunch loud drunk hungry college kids  supposed nicer restaurant just killed mood  <EOR> Here I loved place because fancy yet casual  waiters hostess managers ALL wonderful  atmosphere romantic   I also liked place because $42 Filet Mignon which amazing $11 pizza  Good portion sizes too   In response review 2 below mine table ordered Seafood Risotto excited taste all three thought amazing   If staying Hard Rock earn 100 player points give $50 food voucher place  <EOR> My friend figured would convenient eat somewhere within Hard Rock before Friday night show Joint  She actually paid eat before when first opened she's model Vegas sense enjoyed food  made reservations then separately received email Joint informing could receive free bottle wine purchase 2 entrees front line passes seemed even better!   Thanks some ridiculous Friday traffic hotel Hard Rock arrived 12 minutes late reservation but took seat lobby ordered couple cocktails anyway  french martini delicious Blue Hawaiian just way she likes them    Despite presence entire Foo Fighters entourage a party 25 being exact same time service friendly knowledgeable attentive  comped bottle Spanish red blend better expected second bottle La Crema chardonnay ordered good more white drinking friend  calamari good but disappointing considering heard used prepared artichoke scattered throughout well  good though just nothing special  seafood risotto delicious friend's penne la vodka caused practically lick plate clean    It pretty early when pre show 6pm 8pm but still even more empty expected  food good though although would way would definitely eat Ago again  <EOR> BLAND BLAND pasta   Sadness   hoping great food   I aghast when server spooned pasta left sauce bowl   Argh   Pet peeve     Filet stuffed w goat cheese signature dishes   always think any meat stuffed wrong   Why ruin fantastic cut meat?  Maybe disguise lack quality?    Caesar Cioppino very good excellent dressing soup bucketload shellfish   scallops very low quality though teeny tiny chewy pre frozen sort     We took cab beautiful Encore just check DeNiro's joint Rock worth time calories  <EOR> We also took advantage Hard Rock's players club promotion  Despite having Hard Rock many times before never heard Ago  restaurant nice bright perhaps little plain Las Vegas standards  hostess really nice sat promptly  reservations but even though 6PM would needed them  only two other groups only three more would come before left  comparison Nobu next door looked busy while Pink Taco line door   We ordered lot since 3 $100 comps  started beef carpaccio tuna tartare flat bread  carpaccio delicious  friends very apprehensive raw meats but ended letting finish carpaccio because he much  carpaccio lighter taste good those might used raw meats  Speaking raw tartare made larger chunks tuna usually used tartare  served avocado grapefruit slices  pretty good although simpler cleaner preparation some might used to  flat bread also good although overshadowed other two appetizers  Between 3 friend the freaks raw food preferred carpaccio other friend liked tartare best  also given selection bread tapenades although barely ate any since many appetizers   For entrees flat noodles wild boar stew seafood paella spaghetti meatballs  wild boar delicious  friend let taste some wish ordered it  He only finished meal  because bad meal but because he liked boar much he forced himself finish  would back even without comp try dish  friend's paella also good  came very generous portion lots different kinds seafood  sauce very creamy  good old spaghetti meatball  hindsight wish ordered something more unique but really craving spaghetti thanks all spaghetti specials encounter Las Vegas although all those specials $5 spaghetti coffee shops $20 spaghetti nice Italian restaurant   very good  never really thought spaghetti spinach would good but well sauce used  fact favorite part dish probably spinach  huge serving probably only ate half it  hearty eater too  tried eat just meat balls but left two unfinished plate  Pasta dishes cooked al dente those prefer less firm noodle might want specify order  surprisingly no room dessert  Service amazing during whole meal  never ask anything   When writing review website tried proper names each dish menu  menu posted website different current menu  also learned Robert De Niro co owner  changing menus generous promotions lack customers usually bad signs restaurants  shame since decent place really deserves more business  think problem slightly overpriced  point insanity but if dropped prices 10% 20% think they'd very well  lounge which think lower priced appetizer only menu looked somewhat busy  Hard Rock lacks options between casual fine dining  Outside Pink Taco everything else very high end Rare 120 Nobu casual Mr Lucky's   guess might some issue owners wanting own nice Italian place but sure they'd better off getting some business having restaurant 3 4 empty during dinner time while they're giving $50 comps  way if valet park your parking receipt $10 off coupon it  <EOR> Staying Hard Rock longstanding tradition me  Maybe its because most people under age 50 there's lots attractive guys age boot?
