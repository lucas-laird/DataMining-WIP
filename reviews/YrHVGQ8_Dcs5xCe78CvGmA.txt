Don't fooled   address isn't McDonald's photo   McDonalds actually located Wal*Mart across street   They used workers really unprofessional but shaped workers recently think   food pretty good can't complain   Being Wal*Mart bring food pretty fast because gets pretty busy certain hours   McDonald's good because they're pretty much 24 hours   Except hour close 1am   ^_^ <EOR> It McDonald's     no just McDonald's but McDonald's Walmart don't better this!   very good service  Food made fresh but people ignored counter   McDonald's think bad just expect feel good later  <EOR> I normally wouldn't even review McDonald's because would never think check reviews one   McDonald's right? Everyone knows mcdonalds   but dude place awful  Walmart some groceries stopped pancakes kids  menu clearly states all day breakfast but only options hot cakes sausage burritos   fine because kids asking pancakes anyway  order told don't any breakfast even though see hash browns sitting warmer getting old  kid register attitude just looked he hated life  ended ordering two happy meals chicken nuggets  bit wait order two everything except only box chicken nuggets  back other one  notice you're putting two juice boxes two toys two packs apples don't think should more order nuggets? lol cool though   never fan McDonald's because think just gross general just solidifies fact won't return  <EOR> Inside Walmart no drive thru  Gets crowded easily especially carts way  Sticky counters  don't wanna bump into trashcans cause they're covered ketchup  Never wait long though employees usually pretty nice  Same stuff you'd any McD's  <EOR> I won't coming back location   wife wanted take daughter play kid's area just wanted coffee   cashier wearing name tag don't know name was   Very unprofessional   Didn't acknowledge when walked in   She looked annoyed she job all wanted coffee   pants sagging didn't seem she wanted there   understand McDonalds don't expect top level service but expect professional attitude basic customer service   She took order wrong annoyed she correct it   didn't let ruin night but won't going back location anytime soon  <EOR> This place getting better  finally order right when only short wait once order  trash over flowing actually saw maintenance man cleaning walls spill cleaned promptly   I appreciate guy front counter drive thru  name Anthony he always smiling friendly where ever wether inside thru drive thru  He even started remembering order kids which helps because kids love coming play often since hot here   One thing would see more motivation all managers see  see them work work but none seem happy willing concerned problems customers may small large  Once man spilled child's chocolate milk play land counter ask help  Standing front counter saw female manager tell young boy bagging food turn around help me  want thank Mcdonalds having very attentive crew members front counters help me  Because them help no matter managers though  training young crew people great exceptional  <EOR> Whatever stay McDonalds   rudest managers   through drive thru 10 00 p m  8 18 15 ordered ice cream cone   only did person preparing hands all over cone that eat thank you he made super small   Smaller ever then told standard size   requested refund  He ornery rather put more ice cream cone he would rather just throw cone away give refund   ridiculous he just petty rude!  Never again!  down street Blue Diamond Rainbow   Hopefully owned same people  <EOR> I strongly location   Very clean well taken care of  notice people constantly sweeping mopping emptying trashes  watch them wash hands   Some staff know exactly order burger  Great customer service  General Manager really nice  Always served hot food because inside Walmart Supercenter  NO wifi drive thru Playground location    The playground WiFi location street Badura AVE  Yelp link below  http www yelp com biz mcdonalds las vegas 53 <EOR> Food fresh but took while  noticed younger gentleman cleaning floors when tables needed attention booths dirty! Id say management fault needs give better direction  Customer service wasn't friendliest even manager herself  Wouldn't all excited dine again  <EOR> Went drive thru surprised someone taking orders   totally new since In n Out does that  Never seen McDonald's   He friendly took order fast correct  drive thru lady friendly     This location playground kids  <EOR> This McDonalds worst customer service   asked cup coffee no lids cup open   didn't even bother look lids back   <EOR> Messed order charged large fries when didn't order them then didn't even put fries meal  mcnuggets cold crusty  never coming back  <EOR> This location exclusively 8pm 4am midnight snack 6 piece nugget + small fries $1 99!   This location inside Walmart Arroyo Crossing  probably very convenient always fall fact Walmart when shop here  staff very nice quick taking customer's orders food always pretty quick  usually line 1 2 when visit but could probably just time there   I never any 'problems' food 'served' me  I think unique thing midnight snack advertisement have  If between 8PM 4AM special 6 piece chicken nugget + small fry 1 99 which something never seen advertised other McDonald places  <EOR> This McDonald's located inside Walmart Arroyo Crossing shopping center   Since local Walmart pass Mickey D's all time   More often Husband convinces he's hungry wants grab snack while we're there   Usually something easy Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich but other times sat down full meal   My most recent find discovery during Halloween   selling Halloween Treat books $1 each!  Inside coupons free apple dippers free small cones free apple juice milk jugs   total 12 coupons $1!  deal!  location cooler others even offered it! I tried purchasing more another location didn't offer it! Overall pretty efficient professional some other McDonald's Vegas  <EOR> People wonder why service bad now  super clear why  stopped into location while getting oil changed munchkin getting hangry  Two corporate employees lady blonde hair business casual attire man receding dark hairline sports jacket where there  woman behind counter helping orders man booth laptop  Once rush died down woman sits booth man begin speaking each other other employees  begin talking employee cleaning apparently missed table some dead flowers vase  Tables full customers instead getting booth speak employee dead flowers lady decided raise voice begin telling flowers table needed wiped down  off your ass your job professionally  No else needs hear barking employees  seems normal because none workers even flinched  just McDonalds but can't expect your workers act professional if your own corporate employees can't act appropriately  mention blonde woman began speaking poorly other team members man even far call team member liar     Poor poor representation corporate employees  <EOR> Why rate fast food restaurants first place? no consistency fast food  depends when order  Your experience today differ your next trip restaurant  silly waste time reviewing f f outlets  Peace out  <EOR> Quarter Pounder Sirloin Microwave HEATED ! But they're coffee good other drinks <EOR>
