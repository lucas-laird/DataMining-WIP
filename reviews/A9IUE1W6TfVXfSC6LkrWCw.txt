Cole slaw good but little vinegary  Food fresh fresh gooooood!!!!   Its somewhat fast food done food truck style but still good service  person register always friendly call your name when foods ready  forgot drinks sides but still friendly brought them over right away  While waiting line promoters came around handed t shirts  Very nice touch!   Price ok its 8 bucks 3 taco combo choice 3 meats 1 side drink  Its bit o'greasy everyday lunch meal   but if park truck outside campus i'd def  change last statement <EOR> Went other day opinion place   Maybe because soft opening kinda all over place but The place small but nice easy ready menu lots options Soft opening all available The Sisig which normally am big fan hard  crispy before but HARD  pleasant eat but did alot flavor   Adobo good but missing little flavor honest  tacos form bowl   We charged extra some reason  garlic rice  50  extra fine but didn't explain extra $3 charge  receipt order cut off where showed items  Didn't want wait line back argue since already waited 10 min   The kitchen staff front completely all over place no really focused customer  Waited line 10 min before even ordering  yelling each other back forth guy kept yelling cashier though she seemed if she just started but instead yelling he could explained calm way     Received food missing some tacos  did quickly give them but seemed everyone back since missing item CHECK YOUR ORDER!!  I try again maybe having issues barely being open but far unimpressed     super excited having great food service food truck  <EOR> After hearing numerous reviews recommendations White Rabbit decided give try late Saturday night  ordered sisig burrito which extremely impressed also ordered side lumpia which complimented burrito nicely  service quick workers friendly would come back food again again! <EOR> Overpriced food soaked salt  Need say more?
