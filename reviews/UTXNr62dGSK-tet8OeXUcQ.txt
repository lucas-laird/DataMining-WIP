Frying things same oil unacceptable people allergies dietary restrictions   My options vegan side according Adrian steamed vegetables veggie sticks  Lame  Disappointing  steamed vegetables literally cold pool water clearly frozen then microwaved pretty nasty  friend also ordered them equally disappointed  vegan burger tasted pretty iffy    I asked speak manager relayed all happened he shocked waiter said those things vegetarian because are  designated fryer fries other vegetarian items  HOWEVER he said sometimes cooks lazy fryers mixed sometimes fry animal products vegetarian oil  Again    What??? Isn't your responsibility manager  MANAGE your cooks teach them cross contaminate oil? Unacceptable excuse opinion  whole group frustrated just felt defeated uncomfortable expecting pleasant restaurant experience since vegan options thought   AND top all off guess food poisoning throwing all night meal?  right did  rest group also stomach aches rest evening   Truly  Disgusted   Don't here  Lame excuses terrible service food took forever sick vegan burger which pretty hard since aren't any animal products spoil   I would give zero stars if could  never return another yard house again experience  <EOR> Spend week Vegas only restaurant actually wanted review oh goodness please beats most all casino restaurants price range  Happy hour awesome drinks great  Service really good  Started eating all food then thought taking pictures sorry  Pleated very well  <EOR> Service very friendly   time happy hour drink discounts   Vodka shrimp pasta very good! <EOR> Service reception well coordinated conflicting messages when table  steak ordered did any taste fresh all  Overall food very bland  <EOR> Here group work before 6 30 PM Monday night   LINQ area if familiar area area off Flamingo Blvd right where High Roller Google it    chance away slot machines gambling bit because pedestrian walkway area mostly shops restaurants would see any outdoor mall area    Positive able seat 20 long high top table virtually no wait   Some adult beverages those may know walk around alcohol streets LV   food good service awesome craft beer +1 some best   Negative When came require dump drink before would seat us   LV NEVER that   20 + guess management buying another round am sure   HATE Nitpicky stuff NEVER problem any other establishment   I give 3+ <EOR> You food before your next birthday  guarantee it! Yard House usually pretty timely but location dead took almost hour immediately seated   In addition paid bill I requested early because knows when arrived noticed buddies entree mushrooms even specifically requesting none  important mainly because food allergy them   The managers offer  few drinks road?

Instead just politely saying ok told that Other service fine food fine everyone else seemed happy food service  <EOR> We dined friends children   large dark see would loud  given large screen TVs likely used during sports events  more families while were   server attentive   friends' child did receive apple juice instead orange juice the waitress did repeat orange juice when ordered know she took order correctly but kiddo good sport drank because taking forever flag server down we never did    menu itself way many choices overwhelming when first look it   I'd recommend opening if indecisive because only give full blown panic attack  husband ecstatic beer selection enjoyed mac n' cheese because bacon   He wasn't overly excited French Onion Soup  which favorite dishes he frequently gets other restaurants too   asked server street tacos   wasn't really interested entire meal asked if ala carte designation meant tacos plural quantity meal 2 tacos just beans rice which she agreed was  conversation when asked clarification she recommended ala carte way mix n match tacos since wasn't sure which wanted ala carte taco portion without rice beans?  Exactly! She didn't tell really priced PER taco menu isn't exactly clear   carnitas fish tacos asking recommendation she listed all them but two   Unexpectedly two tacos came one each $8 40ish BOTH   Street tacos should never EVER expensive   server never returned could ask clarification  just wrote off figured I'd Yelp hopefully warn others ala carte price $4 $6 PER taco   Still ridiculous   fair say OK tacos but certainly worth $4 each   all honesty can't review other food  <EOR> I've several Yard House locations Temecula San Diego chain awesome if love draft beer selections wide range food options  Girlfriend stopped Vegas location trip 50th bday  village location can't several other venues live music casino entrances off courtyard area   Prices same non Vegas locations service fast  Definitely go to delicious meal without Vegas price pumping  <EOR> I only dined Yard House Waikiki    when first exposed massive beer selection  great time when saw Yard House locations Linq Red Rock maybe somewhere else well? beer enthusiast within excited!  Their beer list ridiculously extensive organized pretty much every way organize them  server seemed pretty knowledgeable beers really helpful when searching particular beer  didn't beer but she willing bring sample another beer search comparable beer  Keep mind when visiting Yard House don't afraid ask sample    Their food list also extensive if could describe would say fusion many foods  ended going burger because headed show    but burger GOOD huge very good price! strip I'd say probably some lowest pricing types food offered  no fancy place but plenty TVs seating windows views Linq Promenade High Roller friendly servers service enjoy yourself fill your belly  <EOR> We afternoon group 7  Ordered appetizers drinks total $8 each  Food great enjoyed being near high roller sports bar atmosphere friendly service  <EOR> Descriptive phrase hip cool sports pub poor service   Yard House chain Linq just cool clean any other  When big group came watch Final Four basketball games obvious gonna while drop chunk change  did considering each half yard beer least $14 own Chicken Nachos $11 45 good way    But overwhelming impression left horrendous service was  wasn't even busy first took 20 minutes between visits server  each time she came she'd only take 1 2 people's orders of 10ish us then leave again    The place many TVs games yet refuse turn game sounds even though night especially most patrons watch Final Four  Annoying   When bill finally came would split it  understand some places refuse which think stupid but whatever  However when through bill ton things didn't order  brought attention changed it   to more wrong things  took legitimately 30 minutes figure did wrong explain them before could change correctly  said they'd comp beer trouble but those never came    The only reason isn't 1 star because food beer atmosphere still good  crowd even opposing fans all friendly jovial  But wouldn't come back solely because service  <EOR> I hate give chain restaurant 4 stars maybe sleep deprivation driving Cali Vegas but dammit enjoyed meal!

Yard House still offers solid selection beer strip   bring beer go  itself awesome place worthy visit    The menu same all other Yard Houses across country  food wasn't overpriced being strip but certainly isn't worth trek either  would come beer but nothing more  <EOR> The service great food definately above average but two Kale salads ordered literally no Kale them server 2 bowls Kale add  Lots good beers tap fun atmosphere  <EOR> Like many other locations Yard House amazing beer selection international domestic even local brews   Roseville San Jose locations CA well Waikiki     They consistent always seem deliver great service pretty decent food though usually having appetizers beer   favorite food items tacos which Korean favorite  <EOR> Big shout manager wait staff seating family 21 people all didn't wait forever!
