What!? realize airport but come on!  Also because 8 15 am decided bacon egg fried rice  Huge mistake! Tasted cook added 3 tablespoons black pepper dish  Tasted mostly soy sauce infused rice scrambled eggs onion undercooked bacon TON black pepper  $8 50! Sorry Pei Wei Asian Diner   I'll remember steer clear future! <EOR> Isn't Vegas those places never sleeps? Well airport most shops closed 9pm   on Friday? Ok fine    Japanese teriyaki chicken ate  bad  kinda liked it  veggies seemed good  white rice good  chicken good too  sauce pretty good too  Maybe starving 5 hour flight but thought pretty good  wasn't fast though rather made order semi prepared ingredients    Based options saw when I'd probably eat meal again  <EOR> For Airport meal else could ask fresh food  burger sure why people hate place lunch very good  <EOR> SLOW!!!!  Only cook register    Couldn't through line wait 20 minutes <EOR> Pros I'd come again music  Daft Punk Zero 7 Ellie Goulding Kings Leon etc   The staff courteous food good    Cons Limited menu  Prices 30% higher non airport PW   Seating cramped   No ice water  <EOR> This nice Pei Wei airport   Food good  Wait time wasn't bad   They fastest if flight catch isn't place go! <EOR> Okay restaurant review last Milwaukee Las Vegas flight   two hour layover before flew Las Vegas SFO  wandered around awhile airport lot restaurants  Well place actually good  only complaint first two selections  Mongolian Beef meat tender ridiculous  sauce much flavor  Pretty good review airport food right? <EOR> I certainly miss having good local food PDX but given options Pei Wei alright  Kung Pao chicken came piping hot less 10 minutes  American airport Chinese food decent four five big chunks lightly breaded fried chicken  wasn't much breading all meat fat grizzle some places give you  sauce sweet but much drowned rice  Overall healthy food but okay if didn't time eat before your 5 hour flight arrive Vegas famished still another flight go  <EOR> Avoid all cost unless ready wait long time  Food good all Pei Wei's  Customer service wait time horrible  <EOR> we layover las vegas coming back cruise starving!  use eating 24 7 cruise body use wanted food all hours   since still another flight didn't want risk eating other places didn't gluten free menu ended here   the line moved quickly let cashier know allergy   allergy didn't show receipt double checked she assured meal would made gluten free   finding table sucks almost impossible if busy   shares dining room bar pretty noisy     i ordered gluten free pei wei spicy chicken   normally don't chicken unless know organic free range but didn't shrimp option which disappointing   also ordered mild since don't spicy food   food came quickly good all   very soggy sweet   almost thought sweet sour instead but no spicy chicken   kind forced myself eat made mental note myself pack more granola bars snacks when traveling  <EOR> More 2 5 rounded 3 only because airport food lack options  Otherwise would never eat choice  really bothers when menu descriptions inaccurate  If your chicken teriyaki breaded please state that! Especially when chicken teriyaki general breaded even if light layer breading  Decent flavoring   Otherwise place sufficient when you're airport tire same old fast food Italian Mexican options   Plus points veggies come chicken teriyaki brown rice comes complimentary option  Also seems your food order  Warning only couple bites food far breath reeking! <EOR> Always bit skeptical food joints inside airports but place pretty good! Ordered low mein before flight above beyond expected  Would order again  <EOR> I some pieces chicken fully cooked  rest meal average best honest  Im sure other locations better but would recommend one <EOR> This rare places airport good food   Service 4 5 I recommend steak fried rice  prepared wait however  waited least 15 minutes luckily able board flight time   Food 4 5 Surprisingly steak tender dry tough  brown fried rice just right flavor salt content  Avoid honey seared chicken  no way seared fried  batter chicken sadness every bite <EOR> Pei Wei best fast food places   Quality food consistently good usually taste same any thier shops   Friendly service alwasy tasyt food  <EOR> This review warm friendly service provided Cindy   She greeted plenty options food offered double drink additional $4  seemed pretty basic airport restaurant smelled old grease   way sat conversed some cool people mostly traveling business could really expect more airport restaurant <EOR> Gotta love those lettuce wraps  line moved quickly employee register looked seriously sick job but still helpful    Food came quickly everything ever wanted Pei Wei  don't Portland excited easily  back next time  Although hopefully Vegas while  over Vegas right now  Can't believe day come  <EOR> One only decent options terminal  First time eater  Caramel Chicken white rice  Good portions pretty flavorful  spring roll other hand fan of  If you're airport it  <EOR> Not very much seating  food made order relatively fast  Service prompt but friendly  Pretty good place terminal c food  Full bar next store television  <EOR> It may best Asian food ever but Pei Wei nice convenient welcome alternative burgers fries hotdogs offered rest airport   Is little greasy bit salty? Sure but $15 total you're gonna Gordon Ramsay entree sustainably raised free range chicken organic farm fresh greens airport  Fine is <EOR> I'd give them 2 5  cracks menu calls its food inspired Asian cooking  True  obviously isn't authentic but sometimes you're just craving some soup noodles  traveling all day already 3 meals just wanted something light  Thai Wonton Soup  wasn't hearty any means but liked taste wontons  <EOR> Having leave Vegas only two short nights bad enough but being terminal lot food choices when you're getting ready plane five hours even worse         But just when thought last Vegas meal going some boring traditional egg thing spotted Pei Wei could BE?  Yes non traditional breakfast!  Even regular menu if wanted it   Score!       plopped down bar some nice hydrating iced tea along breakfast choices breakfast sandwich Husband Breakfast Fried Rice me   Oddly enough rice dish came couple chunks fried hash brown type things which gladly tossed Husband   enough carbs contend with     tell ya loved fried rice!  full all kinds delicious morsels bacon sausage veggies including bean sprouts   seriously good never ever want know many calories it!    Now proper breakfast time proper pre flight dessert   Glass chardonnay Makers neat Husband         All topped off excellent service friendly Bartender  <EOR> I few times food always good   Service mediocre best  good morning nothing just stand stoic  early? late? Deliver food table toss bowl table middle table front picky?  don't think so  thank nice day  Nothing   Maybe location staffed mutes would sense  <EOR> Ugh?! understand why airport food bad reputation but Pei Wei McDonald's sound gourmet  hour layover wanted some lunch  huge line outside Pei Wei thought could wrong? Mongolian beef brown rice while friend kung pao chicken brown rice  also shared order pork egg rolls     The food beyond disappointment  Everything extremely over salted literally felt though eating spoonfuls salt  seriously could myself eat more several bites because incredibly thirsty  really wonder why many people waiting line yuck! <EOR> Crap service extent when tried pay bill told clocked yet you'll wait    15 min later sign check  <EOR> The bar super crowded  whoa  I'd prefer stand pushed around sit high top table feel stuck   That being said to go menu appealing  $11 honey chicken brown rice  tasted healthier General Tso's  But probably wasn't  Good quantity high airport price  waited 10 minutes to go dish  <EOR>
