Perhaps    There's also mini hot cold foods bar cafe atmosphere also pastry case fresh baked bread well  trendy looking mini market  worth look around  <EOR> I came Virgin Cheese! all way back freezer section  rest shelves almost bare unexpected creepy  best selection  Upon checking person manually input cards via square swiper iPhone  Womp womp  come back cheese but  it  <EOR> The service slowest all time  always multiple people working no registers open front just checkout counter where order food  Ive twice never back   buffalo chicken wrap terrible  bagels also terrible  Avoid it  <EOR> I've going Market since opened hopeful would better stocked more reasonable prices new ownership took place  however case   The establishment itself neat tidy  staff generally pretty friendly today proved very helpful  partner cafe see if bacon jam scones  usual but clerk offered call other Bronze Cafe location see if any  Unfortunately well    I continued bit light shopping while he asking scones  only half gallons whole 2% milk quite few them most which would expire less week but no gallon sizes  only cartons 18 eggs no dozens  produce fairly stocked least fruit side  Asian pears which looked good but no price marked    And everything definitely pricy side  seem capitalize fact isn't real grocery store close downtown area charge convenience    When bread noticed three different types Texas toast several loafs artesian bread Sara Lee loaf sourdough  partner excited sourdough until saw several moldy spots it    It definitely turned off put all items back where found them walked out  last time ever going Market Fremont  <EOR> Save Stumptown Coffee unless stranded downtown no other means obtain food cannot fathom reason shop Market   its overly precious feel frankly unappealing selection baked goods prepped foods did see item made think wow I'd eat that  Obviously target audience don't need craft beer car carry few miles away larger selection lower price guess Downtown Project cohort until someone coax CityTarget something similar into area   though shopping would probably beneath folks manicured facial hair latest Thriftshop chic want spend extra box Lucky Charms cookies looked stale 10am  <EOR> Went market JUST BUY VIRGIN CHEESE  if  why you're going don't bother!!!! Literally mini wedge cheese 2 inches diameter $12 00!!!!! Seriously?! outraged  Vegan am proud show people eating diary free isn't more expensive Virgin cheese spits concept  would bought if $5 maybe $7 most  BUT 12 00$?!?! joking? never buy Virgin cheese just because rape call environmentally friendly cheese    economically friendly?!? <EOR> I having lunch neighboring restaurant need grocery shopping meal prep  Market pretty small store more common produce items cereals frozen vegetarian treats teas coffee non dairy milk chocolates snacks dried spices mixes O Face doughnuts cookies pies etc  full on grocery store items won't find here  looking fresh cilantro which didn't but nice enough small bunch kitchen  Talk going above beyond customer service!
