Amazing! <EOR> Stopped because area  drinks ended being pretty good however little turned off employee's lack knowledge    Took while order because wanted drinks unsweetened which seemed confuse cashier  He told first none drinks could unsweetened  When asked if he sure he turned random girl standing next asked her  I'd imagine she probably just gotten off work but whole process just weird   We finally asked which drinks could made unsweetened since drinks named weren't possible made without sugar   because sure use some kind powder most drinks   We ended getting just plain milk tea jasmine milk tea  end drinks tasted good but whole process just off putting pain  <EOR> The drinks food good but service sucks big time  Especially girl thats working counter rudest bitch ever! She literally looks u down when u walk she owns place  <EOR> First thing's first    customer service needs little working on  Sometimes greeted other times just awkward stare    only thing keeps coming back Matcha Green tea Snow Bubble accumulating stamps stamp card!

Hands down WORST TapEx to!! <EOR> The food great but service poor  customer greeted upon entry  understand if theyre busy but only people just talking  cashier very slow orders  ordered boba overfilled drink much couldnt move without spilling  food took 30 mins come confused because didnt know if food ready someone elses keep going back forth  only sense relief when food  <EOR> Good boba yummy fusion food   I came bf friends couple days ago  pleasant experience although order took little bit more expected  friends before really inclined try it  bf ordered longanisa fries taro milk tea boba coffee boba the coffee wasn't good   Everything tasted really flavorful boba fresh  atmosphere clean modern  can't wait come back try something new  <EOR> There's lot improvement since last time came here  Very impressed changes loved short stop here  <EOR> If your need quick boba fix good place check out    I would recommend trying avocado snow bubble small tapioca egg pudding  deliciously sweet creamy shake packed fresh avocado  egg pudding reminds Filipino desert called leche flan which favorite desert growing small tapioca compliments drink well   The cafe located more central Las Vegas near university which great students professors  <EOR> After last experience probably never come  again staff rude drinks water down  definitely boba else where <EOR> Took while back place because last time came given horrible service  lady behind register having when simply asking questions things menu  Also last time ordered slushies liquid came cup huge mess because over filled cup didn't close securely    I glad nice lady time  longanisa fries comes black green tea  upgraded milk tea she made pretty quickly  Both milk tea fries good  Next time would call early if wanted longanisa fries again cause takes while make    It also really weird playing two different songs same time kind bothered me  <EOR> I stumbled onto place while waiting friend class UNLV down street couldn't any more glad curiosity better walk through door    Service semi quick + super friendly  Yula cashier super nice welcoming  She recommended some favorites menu convinced try longanisa fries filipino sausage sweet savory taste even prior disclaimer all warm foods take 15 20 minutes served which sense considering primarily boba place  Anyways felt adventurous also ordered green tea kit kat boba tie over getting meal    Food Quality Crave worthy !  It show good things came those wait because legit could marry longanisa fries green tea kit kat boba  fact place isn't more busy mystery but feels great know found another hidden gem Vegas    Atmosphere Calm + Quiet  Aside music playing dining room mostly empty quiet  ideal studying apparently use wifi Jason's Deli next door free    Pricing Decent + Worth   It's consider university zone meaning close proximity upcoming but broke college students pricing pretty cheap accommodate them majority people come through here  spent $15 stuffed  <EOR> My siblings stumbled upon place while roaming around Vegas  110 degrees outside wanted refreshment  Oh boy glad here  place quiet spacious boba place  ordered regular boba milk tea siblings  refreshing but overpriced  nothing special memorable but did its job cool down heat  offer stamp card if 10 orders drink then 1 free  samplers try before ordering drink  Overall OK place  <EOR> This place conveniently close UNLV if don't want drive far boba quick simple meal next Seafood City  ordered Sisig fries under Chief's combos  egg top little bit overcooked but think if you're lucky remember  remind chef yolk runny  would've really good    They'll ask if would water green tea black tea your order part combo  ordered green tea flavor pretty strong sweet  Also since order combo stamp unless order drink separately  Other feel very fulfilling  If bored carne asada fries Roberto's would come they're Sisig fries again  <EOR> Just moved San Diego Vegas happy tapioca express here!! haven't tried all places Vegas yet but wish more just 1 tapioca express love place!!!

Powder? Ice? Something  happened customer always right? LOL mean many other boba spots they've messed few times would ask new made would  Obviously if paying almost $5 drink wouldn't think I'd want made right way? DUH  Whatever other guess  crispy chicken it  <EOR> It might first check but three times already  time brought boyfriend me   They wide range flavors when comes milktea tea snow bubble my personal favorite   Lychee usually flavor but also tried passion fruit which delicious  also mix flavors caramel thai tea snow bubble boyfriend asked for    The staff super friendly easy talk to  price very reasonable  drink under $5!   Overall spot definitely satisfies boba cravings <EOR> I've only other time but don't really remember experience other all food tastes same because use same spice seasoning LOL    I craving some boba shop type greasy food excited come here  visit time ordered crispy chicken rice extra spicy   comes green tea black tea water  shareable portion depending hungry are  also ordered taro milk tea which surprising good  expecting some meh whatever powdery type drink  But actually really creamy sweet  <EOR> I write review former employee fan original Tapioca Express franchises back Cali    Sure place logo menu but unfortunately falls far short expectations Tapioca Express quality customer service wise    Customer service atrocious standards  felt more nuisance welcome few times here  Also when ordering take check straws because they've never put straws me   Drink quality notice blended drinks always bubble caps rather sealed lid  Big no no drink quality based measurements used blended drinks  If much extra product blending drink guarantee added way much ice your drink taste watered down    2 stars boba consistency food nostalgia but Tapioca Express used to    If still want check try squid balls anything fries though ready oil   Everything else pretty average better other boba shops Vegas Valley  <EOR> I am still jumping joy tap ex Vegas!   Walked greeted immediately unlike location Cali since already knew menu order quickly    I ordered Xxtra spicy chicken snack order wish really spicy am use burning lips spicy but just dash yes dash spice  gave decent portion too   Mango Icy w Boba Mango Jelly didn't taste mango much sweet side  ton tapioca but enough jelly plus boba chewy soft   **Buy Large Drink free Taro Milk Tea first time having DELISH  thought would taste rubbery plant but hey something didn't pay came delicious Three stars quick friendly service  Also Taro drink! <EOR> I love Tap Ex! special place heart since used work California  always whatever flavor milk tea feeling day yummy crispy chicken but     $ 55 extra sauce  Those cups only filled halfway  Maybe if actually gave full cups wouldn't need extra one?  Other all good  <EOR> Great finally Tapioca Express outside California  few times happy opened location Las Vegas  add good boba place east side town! came Monday night few patrons usually don't adventurous but risky considering boba place? must add though hate when try something norm am satisfied  ahead order hazelnut snow because wanted ice blended  Mmm mmm! sure delicious  glad able execute good taste drink just California locations do  notice when something popular California then comes Vegas just good  Thankfully Tapioca Express did disappoint! POS card system working night only card left them no choice but give drink house  certainly thankful reason am writing them review  Since POS card system wasn't working service tad bit slow but could tell employees doing could through processes faster  inside course new which nice clean somewhat modern touches  Tapioca Express definitely new boba spot town! <EOR> Great spot studying some work done   outlets very spacious   favorite spots crispy chicken snack    There self serve water pot which big plus  don't bothering busy workers water     The parking lot only 30 60 min parking  If wanna stay longer use unlimited underground parking  <EOR> This place disappointment didn't really care boba  also took long time fried calamari  Won't back even though near UNLV  <EOR> Being full time college student always hunt study spot good drinks food  Tapioca Express conveniently located UNLV its ample parking wide selection food drinks along lots tables study ideal study spot  Unfortunately quality drinks customer service seems going downhill disappointed lately    SERVICE First off some girls major attitude  am huge fan milk teas tried many milk teas here  most favorite and sadly only drink oolong milk tea  problem is   they've oolong tea feels eternity  Probably ever since dinosaurs existed  long!  Back May kindly asked girl if oolong tea back she Ooohhh probably getting back loooong loooooooong time rude snarky attitude  made want choke boba walk here  She could've apologized shortage least little bit more professional   I also overheard servers talking smack customers  Unprofessionalism its finest   DRINKS As stated above only oolong milk tea here  only milk teas actually taste tea  black milk tea extremely sweet taste very artificial  even slightest taste tea  Jasmine milk tea ok really distinct weird taste am fan of  Other milk teas taste artificial well made powder syrups   I enjoy boba here  perfect texture every visit  also try mini boba very first time  Personally fan but lot people seems enjoy it    CONCLUSION Oolong milk tea seems only thing worth coming place but they've while   I can't speak other drinks such slushes flavored teas since yet try them but am sure if want deal servers here  <EOR> I don't mind boba bubble tea but since often laden sugar tend stay away it   Tapioca Express isn't bad all different boba norm   What Tapioca Express only drinks but selective menu finger foods too!  Almost little bistro type atmosphere   But honestly stopped HUGE meal Seafood City consisting goodies Grill City Crispy Town   already stuffed!  But kid wanted sweet drink wash all down   Nothing spending $5 copious amounts sugar water!  Oh tapioca balls   I'll give them boba smaller size just all other places making much easier drink through smaller straw   But dunno just all into boba anymore!  done enough tapioca ball chewin' gain myself 5 pounds back then   drop all sugar starch   I drop weight   Plus sugar high!  just back sugar free Red Bull Monster when ha ha ha!  I don't remember flavor boba smoothie but pretty sure flavors ube   halved another flavor   took few sips   Smoothie good consistency almost Slurpee boba chewy but chewy   Kid liked thought OK   Nothing gonna drive all way across town for   spending money some hipster drinks?  Tapioca Express!  Yes   at time also hipsters hanging out   But may back try some food menu looks tasty!  Boy hard time resisting them croquettes     #bobalife <EOR> I'm pretty familiar TapEx back hometown excited see place open close me!   But franchise most people mentioned isn't quite similar its Californian counterparts  offer similar drinks but cater more Filipino food aficionados compared Taiwanese snacks found elsewhere  longanisa fries sisig complaining    The drinks bad but great  being able taste tea milk tea but unfortunately drinks tried they're milky watered down  HOWEVER recommend asking your milk tea blended  Basically where ice blend your milk tea into sort smoothie  tastes great easiest way cool down hot day!   Overall OooOoookay  Would probably come back just because space offer work  <EOR> I'm fan place service isn't good the cashier terrible attitude boba itself terrible  couldn't even finish small because overwhelming taste was  ordered passion fruit boba if just dumped whole container passion fruit flavoring into drink  no balance drink  first option drink kind  think many other places better this  <EOR> Probably better boba drinks Las Vegas   Good flavor blended ice   boba itself little soft side however still acceptable   I did feel nickeled dimed little   ordered snow bubble which assumed included boba because word bubble included name instead pay more boba  <EOR> I love place! convenient if you're student because close campus  drinks taste great variety flavors! fries offer very tasty  longanisa sisig fries personal favorites  jasmine green tea also great drink  would give five stars if wasn't workers Steffany though  She's exactly nice welcoming customers such friends I  She acted rude if didn't exactly know your order if asked many questions  But other place great! <EOR> The gospel small tapioca pearls according Chris V   In beginning bubble tea  masses tried sweet drink chewed thoughtfully tapioca pearls  saw good   The drink spread throughout Taiwan then across ocean America  came pass beverage would build devoted following   Most establishments served beverage utilized large tapioca pearls  Giant straws could convey pearls necessary  Many would enjoy novelty tools   But some people would feel unwieldy instruments forced them consume drink far quickly  did nor did entirely appreciate alternative simply ordering chewy boba   Some practitioners art turned small tapioca pearls rumored original form used creation bubble tea  found similar chewy texture could enjoyed through regular smaller straw  straw would finally able sip drink slowly   Unfortunately all vendors would embrace small tapioca  Even such locations San Jose Orange County providers appeared few far between   Lo behold small tapioca pearls finally brought great desert oasis known Las Vegas  Whereas other businesses ignored allure mini boba franchise chain called Tapioca Express not known universally particular add on finally unveiled option   On 11th day 5th month year Lord [that's literally A D ] 2015 arrived first Tapioca Express Las Vegas found small tapioca only previously witnessed land California   Although TapEx's standard milk tea $2 98 +$0 50 large size prepared product markedly sweet employee did indicate adjust sugar levels certain flavored teas  brings significant hope future   Regardless if burden overly sweet milk tea must weighed against beauty small pearls +$0 50 per topping cheerfully choose small pearls because properly chewy clump   So come all ye boba lovers try small tapioca! See you've missing all along  <EOR> I wish could leave zeros stars  girl working terrible service wouldn't allow add $0 50 boba because only credit card spending limit  <EOR> I'm Bay area having Tapex Vegas best things ever happen! not really but point My cousin came check already high standards things should be  located right next Jason's Deli Wingstop Seafood City Asian central basically   Service par  quick girl took orders very friendly helpful  ended ordering Halo Halo Avocado snow bubble  sure why people weren't able taste avocado theirs  tasted ours saw lady use real avocados them! also decided order Matcha fried Oreos  served 4 Oreos scoop vanilla ice cream middle  good but nothing special especially since didn't taste matcha much  However didn't meet standards while food drinks good wasn't anything spectacular   Seating plenty very spacious clean here  glad isn't cramped dirty some other boba places Tea Station Volcano Tea Chinatown   Overall fan would return  better boba places Vegas happy finally Tapex town! <EOR> I'm happy finally Tapioca Express Vegas! now ordered Iced Milk Tea w boba love it! milk tea's sweet plain either  boba's perfect cheap!

Then adding insult injury sugared hot jasmine tea!   All all closer yucky yummy <EOR> First time TERRIBLE! lists 120 item menu but only 7% available  LOL SHUT DOWN! Reason renovation?

Friendly staff clean place! <EOR> This least favorite boba spot tried  located very busy plaza Seafood City quite spacious  decided give place try friend need boba tea  Upon entering greeted right away friendly cheerful employee  She explained them stand two sizes bobas  smaller size pearls which regular straw would accomadate bigger more common pearls which fat straws needed    I decided bigger size boba since smaller ones availble time   guessing because came right when opened maybe didn't yet? Nonetheless taro flavor larger two sizes offer    Order came fast way eager see if found new spot boba friend  flavor taro very artificial powdery  drink cloyingly sweet even would Mayor Sugar City if election  Texture boba ok but zero flavor  All all giving stars friendly service place being clean but did become fan boba drink here  However check yourself course  <EOR> Nice place hang chill out  drinks amazingly good  Almond snow bubble! Yum! Good! <EOR> I absolutely love place! Sometimes wait little long but drinks worth it  Tried longanisa fries enjoyed those well mango black tea taro snow bubble coconut snow bubble far  Also love fact offer soy milk option  Would recommend place sure! <EOR> Great selection tea coffee  Very friendly staff  Love green tea kit kat boba  Ask drinks secret menu  <EOR> Who loves bubble tea?! If answered then you're awesome! If answered you're right! do  knew place opening since bobaholic why heck not?!  I busy day work last week decided bubble tea might day little better stopped lunch  Bad Idea  Short ribs took while prepare  guess  good thing piping hot succulent  Could slightly more tender but bubble tea place bad all  garlic rice wasn't very garlicky  Which funny because manager asked if wanted garlic rice said ok!
