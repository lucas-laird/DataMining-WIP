Te service great friendly staff  Definitely must try again! <EOR> You're going find Nihari Biryani spot  American food made desi twist    Stepping into place enigma wrapped enigma  Sholay isn't heavily advertised your face don't know expect    The restaurant name brings memories legendary movie elite characters  Come on  Don't tell can't hear Amjad Khan's voice Enough being Basanti   place has large poster Shah Rukh Khan pic Dalai Lama generic scenery pics  walk promptly greeted two American white people  instinct desi run away but please resist urge    You find staff owners chefs love desi food  white dude head chef couldn't more desi when comes spices food    Loved chicken wings chicken kabob here    Only con only open till 7pm  <EOR> I usually come Afandi lot would never noticed Sholay restaurant sign if wasn't boyfriend  heard through yelp but didn't expect try anytime soon    I taken back fact owner place Indian! He VERY friendly though give place 5 customer service! having asked if meat halal owner told everything halal except beef pepperoni  very grateful he only verbally stated but written down menu well    We weren't really starving placed order halal wings fries well pizza naan chicken cheese pizza sauce   He asked if wanted spicy most Indians Pakistanis COURSE said yes  he made added chillies well    Fast forward food halal wings GREAT  Spicy but little breaded  bf noticed well first point out  fries came extremely salty but finished majority them anyways  pizza naan good! Especially if chicken keema! chillies owner added made spicy quite scrumptious    The best part trip place definitely MANGO LASSI  owner gave each sample which led ordering one  lassi thick unlike many other places order lassi could taste yogurt  YUM    The owner also gave sample rice pudding but wasn't big fan  biggest sugar addict but just wasn't feeling it    I hope come back lamb burger lassi next time!   Overall isn't entirely Sholay   If looking Indian as desi khana food elsewhere  If looking American styled Indian food your place  <EOR> The friendliest worker ever works here  think he owner just very friendly man  Every time boyfriend come free stuff  Last time dessert other time mango lassi  food good decent pricing  Sure most glamorous presentations but good someone very hungry   This place just opened 3 months ago pretty eager customers in  <EOR>
