I only gave review 1 because wasn't ZERO option  party 4 restaurant  3 ordered steaks 1 ordered salmon  ordered steaks medium all came medium well well done unfortunately send two three steaks back which took almost 15 minutes because server took long come back check us  Once steaks re made came back table temperature great however once started eating them just didn't taste right something way off them  barely touched steaks salmon also ordered bad cut fish which also barely touched  Once somebody finally came table might bus boy take away plates asked if done which clearly see full pieces meat plate still didn't ask if everything okay just quickly picked plates then server dropped off check didn't say word  Thankfully two steaks taken off check but being charged salmon asked speak manager  told issue everyone's food he all he could say really bad attitude all he take care steaks nobody complained salmon earlier then explained tried tell somebody salmon but server never came around except drop off check    We very nice everything just didn't want pay food tastes bad barely touched  bothers most customer service given steakhouse customer service terrible server also manager  sure anybody into steakhouse would expect great service everybody working there  mention when you're middle conversation manager don't expect bad confrontational attitude turning back walking away   Now thru all did explain person party happy meal  Drinks okay appetizer okay side dishes  just 3 main courses  tried contacting food beverage director Harrahs properties via email phone no response back 10 days! <EOR> This steakhouse selected group it  took short notice reservation very busy weekend plus  majority table's steaks cooked right  Took forever drink different rest table when server appeared only two three tables  Way bright lighting lets turn down notch steakhouse  coconut shrimp steak worst coconut shrimp anyone could make  surrounded pound breading  Couldnt even fit shrimp accompanying sauce container  give myself star ordering seafood vegas me  <EOR> Good Bad reviews here  wonderful filet huge cooked perfection along bacon wrapped scallops which large tasty well  bacon slightly undercooked but cares when scallops perfect  A little pricey but Vegas  Would return sure      <EOR> Food poor price   Service slow   waiter Edward rude acted though everything asked imposition him   return  <EOR> We gone restaurant repeatedly over past few years  Those visits now stop   food gotten steadily worse service done same   last meal took almost 75 minutes table some cold some wrongly prepared made just miserable long meal   Maybe race bottom here?  We even provided feedback just try help last meal better but speaking foreign language   price food definitely better options Vegas  <EOR> I 28th December 2014  Everything Okay except STEAK  good steak expected  love steak many steakhouses but place clearly overpriced  liked oysters though  <EOR> I dinner recent trip Las Vegas enjoyed quite bit  atmosphere terrific nice quiet sanctuary inside noisy smoky casino  restaurant TV's all around room display slide show Vegas throughout early years through current day very fun watch  dining wife's uncle 30 year resident he enjoyed quite bit  old photos helped recall lot memories share some great stories  I started Caesar salad which nicely done good flavor perfect amount dressing  For entree ordered 10 ounce wagyu rib steak which delicious  first time trying wagyu found very tasty  wonderful sear but cooked little closer rare medium rare ordered  sides shared steak fries which sort blah creamed corn bacon which absolutely amazing lobster Mac n cheese which great but lacked little lobster opinion  While sides pretty good very small much smaller would typical steakhouse  For dessert brought piece cheesecake all shared  very nice presentation wonderful too  Overall good experience price paid dine here  If present your players card discount off prices keep mind if you're staying any Harrah's properties  <EOR> Went reverse happy hour drinks good but food terrible! ready happy hour lounge all tables cleaned  sliders hard dry crabby patties  husband steak bites sesame seeds dumped all over them dry hard  did complain since waiter nice felt bad him  <EOR> I'll begin saying food great   The problem lied used car salesman sleaze staff carried swagger   At price expect sort high end experience  it  never blatantly upsold life   After completion ordering your waiter say Oh wanted start off those great fresh crab legs? No? Wow  Okay  Again enjoyed food  Hard enjoy experience when feel you're being hustled   I won't back  <EOR> Terrible just terrible   Ordered $50 Bone in Ribeye most grisly steak imaginable  Something you'd expect Sizzler  many Vegas steakhouses they've all top notch until now  Absolutely shocking bad quality was    The lobster mac 'n cheese almost no lobster rock hard all across top ridiculously small portion given  Seriously least third container breadcrumbs  $12 portion size teacup  Oh unless count breadcrumbs then two thirds teacup   A very nice waiter but other horrible experience  never written Yelp review before angry experience made me  would perhaps excuse incredibly poor food if couldn't better literally every other steakhouse strip but can  HERE  <EOR> Great steaks! Great price great service need nothing else   I shared ribeye lobster Mac cheese grill asparagus couple drinks late night meal wowed beginning end    I consider myself modest foodie place disappointed some very good steakhouses around country  best Vegas! <EOR> The service received terrible   waiter didn't come back check ask water multiple times various people   basically took order dropped food walked away   He acted taken back any requests table condiments etc   If he waited long enough order all way could made those request advance   The food over priced unimpressive   worst burgers had   steak fries terrible cooked well no flavor etc   only thing really enjoyed salads which very good   server asked if would soup salad meals mentioning additional surprise end check   wine recommended again overpriced great   There many great food location Vegas recommend skip one! <EOR> I horribly sick food poisoning Halibut   only table fish only violently ill   Cross contamination! <EOR> Desserts yum!
