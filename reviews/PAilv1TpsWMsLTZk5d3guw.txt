My coworkers kept raving place check out  Maybe tastes just different but all impressed  Apparently place won awards Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich which but found sandwich passable nothing spectacular    Food decent service so so think everything tad overpriced   I mean if you're tired normal chains Subway Quizno's etc    going mom pop shop may break monotony but actually chain too    <EOR> I visited Capriotti's location Fort Apache Tropicana July 21 around 1pm   chose dine in   restaurant very hot don't think a c working turned on   workers sweating   kept opening large refrigerator fan herself   time receive meal took way long   Looked may short staffed   really blew mind though fact when finished meal needed use restroom wash hands having messy sandwich   told location does offer restrooms would walk over KFC use restroom   said What?!!!!  am paying customer just ate your restaurant cannot offer restroom?  worker said no way is   asked manager told same thing   restrooms customers   never heard such thing!  watched another customer walk over KFC use restroom placing order   appalled!  absolutely no excuse offer restroom facilities paying customers very least wash hands since eating meal there!  could understand little if restroom order particular reason but case   Needless say back location obviously value customers   Bit advice if visit sure restroom somewhere else beforehand bring some sanitary hand wipes able wash your hands unless walk over KFC which customer should do  <EOR> Less enthusiastic employees here  Sandwich decent but service off putting won't returning  <EOR> Standards great when comes franchises   expect certain product long happens younger satisfied place no brainer   always expecting   only issue spot causes average rating think prices high  Lower prices would come more often give more stars but price does play into ratings  <EOR> Friendly people    Great service    Sandwich bit dry but still awesome     Thanks guys!!! <EOR> My 4 friends disappointed today when drove over 10 miles your sandwich shop Fort Apache  arrived @ 7 25pm shop closed! store hours say open until 8 00pm least 2 employees inside but no would let in  ended going across street  Arby's  Major bummer! <EOR> I barely give store 2 stars but service good it   ordered cole turkey best sandwiches earth mistakenly asked no cheese extra cole slaw  gave cole slaw sandwich hint turkey   really disappointed   never again   If ever order no cheese say extra meat instead or nothing all      We use restroom but don't one    Argh   wonder if staff hold all day  <EOR> My wife really craving place since into town  She dissapointed  Capstrami great!!! turkey ham cranberry sauce WOW!!!!

Excuse me??? Um shouldn't everyday thing if your establishment offers it?  I guess he fairly OK attitude but seemed inconvenienced stand offish whole time   I'm all some companies wanting deliver but if advertise employees should little more accepting fact they're going it   Furthermore if its $50 minimum shouldn't mention your ad? would figure you'd fielding alot unnecessary phone calls such vague listing  don't know if just but believe there's alot miscommunication maybe some retraining needs done establishment   On slight note delivery guy pretty nice friendly guy  co worker needs take notes  <EOR> I ordered sandwich first time evening  go  delicious! ham cheese  definitely back   Location clean nice  sure some other reviews talking when say dirty  very clean when there    My only recommendation would nice if they'd label sandwiches  always weird when open food dig around determine whose is  <EOR> One favorite sandwich places   recommend Bobbie turkey cranberry sauce stuffing Capastrami hot pastrami special sauce    sandwiches huge very reasonably priced  <EOR> Great service best sandwiches ever had  Bobbie all best things day thanksgiving  reason voted Best sandwich America   <EOR> CAPRIOTTI'S!!!

Unfortunately individually owned sure decent location strongly suggest try'n signature sammy Bobby turkey dinner sammich steak cheese recently tried turkey Cole which Russian dressing Cole slaw  Knocked Socks off! YUM! <EOR> Got food least six times half time order wrong  sandwiches but getting tired lack attention location places orders  always leave off ingredients sometimes those ingredients cost extra which beyond frustrating because pricey enough sandwich  <EOR> Unless want order directly off menu don't bother  Any special orders just difficult  <EOR> First time trying location  Pretty much standard all other locations Capriottis to  ordered cheesesteak Capastrami delicious  Although next time remember order extra side russian dressing because since bread rolls tend thicker side its nice little extra      Since actually branched ordered something other Bobbie Slaw B Jo let down  Definitely continue having returning customer! <EOR> I come cheese steak quite frankly there's plenty bread!   Oh boy would love some now! <EOR> Started sneezing when walked then spent $36 only something fall husband's eye    looked ceiling caked dirt dust  asked guy working if ever clean he said sometimes   Started looking around everything whole store disgusting!!! need dirty dining sure  contact health department <EOR> I love Capriotti's! always order Bobbie but recent visit ordered Bobbie usual ended finding small bone sandwich  wasn't very happy it  hoping does happen again  <EOR> First off normally love Capriotti's but location sucks  Every single employee completely lost head asses  mistakenly ordered online pick twice now left waiting both times because couldn't find order  Both times told would done less 2 minuets  10 minuets later finally walking 5 minuets spent watching employees argue going sandwich trying find order walking around zombies  reason order online don't want wait  let down last time never back location  <EOR> This first time trying capriottis  Every time asked local where good sandwich directed here  walked greeted employee  He knows customers because he could tell hadn't look giving menu  He helped decide sandwich sent order through  carried casual conversation while meal being prepared  no else restaurant made waiting food enjoyable experience  Soon enough freshly made sandwich handed equally nice employee  thanked them wished great rest day    The sandwich definitely put subway shame  If want another sub sandwich may just back visit guys  Overall great experience  <EOR> This place rocks!! hard find service great  time walked door time left treated open arms! place extremely clean  Nothing bad say!  I 20 Bobbie  Yes finished sandwich self perfect  <EOR> This first visit Capriotti's  Both Cole Turkey Capastrami unexciting lacked flavor however Italian bread tasty staff friendly  No military discount  <EOR> I love sandwiches but VERY over priced AND     whole wheat bread   definitely behind times having whole wheat bread instead WHITE bread   Every other sandwich place know whole wheat    Fire House Subs subway port subs quiznos  etc    Come Capriotti's some damm whole wheat french bread  <EOR> This travesty! does fine establishment 5 stars?  I'm also happy whole Bobbie obsession  Yes Bobbie amazing  dispute this  However unsung hero menu Cole Turkey  disagree but you'd wrong since review    Turkey Provolone Thousand Island Coleslaw = Delicious!  What? going Subway? place smells actual Subway  Quizno's? Pshhh    bread may well cement  guys formula down  bread awesome hand pull roasted turkey seen them doing back everything moves quick nice fresh   All those oppose gem sandwich shop only dishonoring yourselves your entire family  <EOR> The Bobbie new favorite sandwich   usually chicken cheese steak Slaw Jo  Even cold really good!  definitely back more! ordered small huge! <EOR> Didn't try Bobbie but couple other sandwiches good but nothing world  guy checkout doesn't seem people person sounds annoyed calling your name when your order ready  Would eat again if really hungry weren't other convenient options  <EOR> Bobbie wasn't good other locations  Bobbie slaw gross    Sloppy wet soggy gross  <EOR> The food good all locations service consistently 3 4 star however location stuff!  Very enthusiastic staff polite fast best service any Capriotti's! Thank fast pick great food! Cheers <EOR> There very few vegetarian friendly sandwich shops but Capriotti's them  handful sandwiches made faux meats  sandwiches also quite filling  small 9 inch sub 12 inch 20 inch sub rounding options   Edit recently informed faux meats Capriotti's vegan  Sorry if previous review led anyone astray  <EOR> This place more Miss Hit  Unfortunately because closest house only other where old jobs E Warm Springs location first time ever tried Capriotti's Bobbie wife brought home work luncheon Sold ever since! when location built excited course tried but very disappointed  thought maybe because new tried several times said Hit Miss more misses though  But now newer location Rainbow near Arroyo work area frequent location quite often bad food experience point  when craving Capriott's actually drive side town Rainbow location Because just don't Ft Apache location Staff seem friendly nice  Some may tentative but really judge place food first then  staff then store  noticed last trip which week ago Remodeled looks great but let's work food please please more tentative  Since living SW area 14 years now having so so experiences finally going write review just give place 2 stars  <EOR> Bobbie great sandwich Meatball hero tremendous  Cap strami wins awards! <EOR> I've bunch different Capriotti's Sandwich Shop locations just okay  service slow veggie cheesesteak which love just okay  think bread bit old side  Also no restrooms really hate that!  don't want walk another restaurant use facilities   don't understand zoning laws Las Vegas allow restaurant function without rest room  <EOR> My family love Capriotti's  visit specific location least twice month  Tim always very upbeat friendly  However every time visit seems some sort discrepancy whether order accuracy change price    If wasn't delicious menu probably really wouldn't keep coming putting those little things  definitely need work double checking orders  Especially busy location doing online orders over phone orders coming person  <EOR> I ordered phone order ready  when there  Bobbie mushroom cheese steak sandwiches great! Very nice remodeled place  Very clean  Extremely nice workers  <EOR> This particular location fired  fan customer Capriotti's 22 years happy see business expand wildfire over time  service quality food location gone downhill see no improvement sight however  husband given location numerous opportunities prove otherwise but no change  last several cheesesteaks ordered contained meat fatty grisly let alone any meat all  Seems they've cut portions half they've previously served  think they've changed type turkey serve well  Tastes different  careful don't bite into piece bone   happened more once simple time oops  don't bother ordering any jalapeño chips  never them stock  think they'd stock appropriately knowing sells faster other flavored chips  <EOR> Fairly average sandwiches  mean meat bread  onions whatever else  If you're into you'll enjoy it  <EOR> This location closest house  Never any issues  Service always quick friendly opinion best cheesesteak find town  Haven't tried other sandwiches  <EOR> I'm regular Capriotti's but less impressed particular location  seemed little grimy dirty side guys working seemed confused pick process order placed online    The sandwich overly salted when home can't say I'd come back location  <EOR>
