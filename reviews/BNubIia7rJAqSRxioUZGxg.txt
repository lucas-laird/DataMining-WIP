It's always busy during week between 11am 1pm restaurant quite small there's lot seating  lot military personnel frequent place lunch because far Nellis AFB prices very reasonable whether you're getting buffet ordering menu  order any food To Go including buffet but costs $1 more if just sit down eat buffet  If order anything menu To Go only takes few minutes food comes fresh   They also offer delivery but only within 3 mile radius $3 delivery charge    I'm always greeted soon walk even when restaurant packed  servers cashiers always same which think place must family owned they're all super friendly    The menu easy read understand even if don't know anything Thai food easily by! isn't those restaurants menu solely foreign language  Each item description underneath know you're ordering   I've eaten lunch buffet once decent probably only worth 3 stars  But every other time just order menu definitely worth 5 stars because usually only takes few extra minutes food come out    The prices House Specials same buffet unless you're ordering dish shrimp then dollar more  food always comes freshly prepared piping hot all House Specials come large pot rice    The Thai Iced Tea addicting  don't usually even tea but every time come Thai tea cream always want more   Oh just side note love request any dish spicy actually SPICY! usually asked spicy scale 1 10? tell them 8 9 comes exactly want every time    This place never let down  definitely favorite lunch spots  <EOR> So Yelp!
