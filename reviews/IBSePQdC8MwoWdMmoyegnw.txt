Horrible spent $100 playing still gave bill $20 gave bartender $30 tip dont know if took points off card <EOR> I've going location over year now usually same bartenders Kaleb and or Patty  some reason tonight completely different story bar tab  big player any means but play ENTIRE time there  usually come 2 3 friends all order gamble HOURS! Tonight ordered 3 beers $3 order tator tots   gambled over 2 hours bar WASN'T EVEN COMPED BEER! COOL!! No warning just F*#K tab when ready go  excuse the manager controls things now there's nothing   WOW! Really? can't even comp beer time money put into place?!?   Me friends won't coming back EVER! simple warning would nice but just keep serving always then bring ridiculous tab without real explanation OK!   I cut player's card coming back!   Apparently shouldn't waste your time gambling since going comp any drinks guest service priority! When $20 can't even FREE beer definitely time move on!
