This place best breakfast strip   am sad see closing   missed  <EOR> Reliably sub par mediocre 24 hour jobbie otherwise food friendly MGM Grand Hotel   Had waffle once 3 a m  pretty stoked find decent eats hotel would considered most off hours  Although Vegas think 9am 11am more readily qualifies  Regardless     waffle good   Coffee good   Subsequent breakfast visits less adequate   Bacon doesn't taste bacon ey   Ham doesn't taste ham ey   Syrup doesn't taste maple ey      getting drift here?  grasp collective upshot grievances?  At least over medium part eggs over medium thing right   Beyond place pretty much blows   crowded   noisy   Many tables high traffic areas single diners don't rate booth feel dining pit row Daytona  expensive   Overall horrible nothing flat out vile    but if you're Vegas should doing things right breakfast Studio Cafe just  not  right   In short     don't same mistake made   Don't suffering all vain   Heed warning beseech you   your faithful correspondent signing off  <EOR> I think upscale Denny's accurately describes decor restaurant  Lucky them would say food little bit better  actually came twice while Vegas due convenience when don't want eating way gambling    During first stop ordered club sandwich  If ever order sure going split someone sandwich huge  far taste decent but hard really judge when eat pieces because physically impossible eat whole thing bite  second trip wised split pizza  four cheese pizza added Italian sausage onions peppers  actually surprisingly good diner pizza   Our service decent both times  would say food little pricey but guess adjust your price scale when eating Las Vegas  If happen MGM want casual quick meal decent option  <EOR> service okay  But food horrible  chicken club sandwich absolutely bad  Chicken cold  Ordered mushroom burger very bad too  Ordered almond granola yogurt eh   Ordered spinach dip okay  Overall place must skip  <EOR> On recent trip Vegas girlfriend decided stop quick lunch  food actually quite good prices reasonable  Well exception soda  Two SMALL Cokes which obviously fountain pop cost grand total $8 00  know doesn't sound much but two small drinks packed ice?
