Maybe should asked more generous chef prepare food?   As avid weight lifter used come workout still unable finish meal no matter hard tried  happened? much love kind food can't justify paying $14 dollars again because small child no disrespect  <EOR> I never poke before life  Then decided check since love raw fish  tried first time delieved Uber Eats OMG  It amazing! tried aloha bowl 2 times already  third time created own bowl all aloha ingredients but added extra fish side seaweed salad  say am now addicted  Please don't stop making delicious food  guys best  am going order again tonight  <EOR> Rise fall Yoshi's Burritos I excited when first opened since close house  tonight's visit last time coming here  ordered Yoshi burrito keep reminding them wanted add replace sauce  Even though wrote down didn't matter considering messed twice  Service gone downhill which sad since just opened up  Oh well time find new spot sushi burrito cravings <EOR> So fresh love build your Bowl  Awesome prices  Bowls sizes good portion  Great customer service! could addicted <EOR> Awesome place try something other then typical burger pizza  Plenty stuff try menu  Friendly staff great vibe amazing food  come least once week fix! yourself favor stop if you're southwest side town  <EOR> Been handful times STILL good! other places w similar set but don't give generous scoops your protein choice place  Great healthy options!

Past price increase which rather substantial menu change even smaller portions along reduction rewards program  food service quality all otherwise good stayed same  bit shame since favorite places close too    The owner responded stating would business otherwise but now can't really say much distinguish them other comparable poke places  just wish reviewed promoted them more before wouldn't raise prices! see location isn't very visible streets thus might affect business well without word mouth promotions  <EOR> Food great fresh tasty reasonably priced! your own way salmon spicy tuna bowl very satisfying    However few times service consistently slow know new but hopefully bowl faster experienced  Watching person behind counter making bowl just painful sometimes way slow  <EOR> I am glad place opened far place   foods tasty good value back!  <EOR> Place awesome!
