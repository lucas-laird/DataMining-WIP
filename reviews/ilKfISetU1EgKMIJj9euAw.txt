Our friends ate told horrible  boyfriend wanted try heck let's biased try right? Well am greatly regretting it   We ordered korokke start which tasted just took flour cooked then served us  Worst korokke life which sad because love korokke  Next boyfriend ordered Miso Ramen while ordered Shoyu Ramen  Miso Ramen smelled funny thought maybe okay taste first  he tried said tasted sour weird then tried afterward  He correct tasted nothing Miso Ramen tasted weird smelled  boyfriend hate complain restaurants but food even edible let them know he switched Shoyu  When Shoyu came he tried told soup spoon smelled funny  He handed knew smell being former server another restaurant  reeked bleach amount should use sanitizing greater that  if poured entire cup bleach just gave us  gave boyfriend soup spoon instead since didn't really need it   My Shoyu Ramen other hand tasted OK   something tasted weird but couldn't figure out  best Shoyu usually favorite  noodles aldente inside but gooey slimy outside  two three bites really sick some reason   stopped eating took to go then tossed when home  My boyfriend also really sick friends right place  don't want anyone else getting sick friends wants try well even warning  Something done figure you're doing wrong fix just close place down  <EOR> It's good see ramen popular ramen houses them   Koraku many places Spring Mountain Road should tried   noodles among best had   However Monta Ramen soup stock better   If could only combine best each   only tried once should give other soups try well   return  <EOR> With all new and old great ramen places town would hold rest?  Unfortunately friends answer big fat meh    Koraku mediocrity its finest     I ordered spicy house ramen extra chashu $12 95   broth tasted first   bland chicken based broth some sort bit spice added it   good thing ramen packed full stuff little pieces pork bok choy few pieces squid couple small shrimp etc   Overall ramen wasn't offensive any way but also pretty much average tasting   lot flavor complexity stuff   would say stay away squid rather rubbery   chashu also worth paying extra dry plain tasting     Overall am sure place going fare against two really good ramen places area   even little more expensive those better places service considerably slower   definitely won't returning when those other guys right down street   Seeing existing chain can't see food changing any time   is  <EOR> I liked food   service good   atmosphere nice   didn't feel well afterward  why gave them 2 stars   other complaints yelp reviews say became ill ignored them try place myself   hope give place another shot 12 months' time  <EOR> cant remember already but curry good shoyu ramen good gyoza fried side rest soft   crowded busy other saimin place forgot name street lol <EOR> Friends mine myself bad experience   1st person ate Mabo Tofu bowl took 3 bites threw away   2nd person ate Beef bowl salty meat didn't taste fresh sure enough diarrhea stomache whole night   3rd person ate Yakisoba he said no taste he diarrhea whole night   I wasn't going write review but two days later friends come tell Koraku he ate Miso ramen soon arrived he told waitress taste smells funny  changed another ramen    His spoon reeked bleach soaked then given without rinsing  He told girlfriend stomache he leave class threw several times  <EOR> I can't believe reviews place   twice now both times impressed   ordered shoyu ramen first time very disappointed broth   flavourless all expected since reviews place good   chalked ordering right thing cook having bad day   gave place more try time miso ramen equally disappointing just hint miso it   Needless say won't coming back anymore   service okay but both times came busy inside   location kind hard find its' restaurant tucked away behind other business buildings   1 star <EOR> 3 stars because just dont many options me  Zero vegetarian options ramen only couple pescetarian options  veggie fried rice  Ok definitely better  place itself neat clean  service very good  friends ordered some dishes supposed include shrimp dish didn't ALL other dish tiny shrimp  Very disappointing  When she asked waiter if dish supposed shrimp he said yes didn't offer any explanation why ONE!

Ummm   BOTH! <EOR> Another Ramen house Vegas sorry say wasn't impressed ramen   didn't ramen main meal but tried some Terri R's   Maybe don't know good bowl ramen is   Maybe just loyal Sora Monta   But thing disappointed Koraku's ramen lacking silky creamy taste   Actually lacking flavor all together  just opinion   Other people may ramen almost no taste   But all wasn't lost visit here   main meal Ground Beef Steak side Mini Menchi Katsu   felt both pretty good     Ground Beef Steak served Hayashi sauce  pretty much Loco Moco minus eggs but eggs this   sauce made way suppose i e  thick somewhat tangy all over place   huge fan end brushing lot sauce side  Other thought meal filling flavorful   more Salisbury steak taste ground beef taste opinion    Mini Menchi Katsu basically two mini hamburger patties  breaded deep fried   Think texture initial taste chicken katsu but ground beef taste to   Wasn't bad all just bad you     The restaurant wasn't busy service great   lot food but again wasn't impressed ramen   But could still see myself coming back other food menu  <EOR> I came because pass street saw new ramen place decided give try   The service really good when server just give ice water without asking mean why did she expect all people want drink ice water? She should ask first  dont drink ice water bcause cold time  order spicy shio spicy miso im ok but bf just cant take it   spicy mean server should ask spicy take  While eating she just come gave check didnt ask check why she gave check while im eating?  I gave three stars just because food  noodle pretty similar sora broth good but good sora   I wont come back <EOR> First time here  work nearby thought would give try   ordered Katsu bowl   very tasty filling   also came miso soup   am coming back sure try curry   new goto place  <EOR> I lunch Sunday afternoon  located W Spring Mountain Rd S Valley View Blvd Las Vegas Chinatown   open since April   2 other locations Southern California   I ordered Wonton Ramen $7 45 which served chicken pork broth   5 small bland wonton   ramen noodles little chewy just way it  topped spinach bamboo shoots green onions   added some chashu $1 50 3 slices   broth flavorless   server brought small bottle Nanami Togarashi Chili Pepper but still didn't help   I probably won't back  <EOR> This place just middle road  curry ramen individually MEDIOCRE but fact together best part  colder days being able both great Japanese comfort food  <EOR> The broth lacks character flavor especially compared Ramen Sora Monta  wasn't impressed any dishes table neither friends  sorry Koraku Ramen qualifying competitor list Ramen yas which shocking when establishment based L A    Enough said  <EOR> Anyone Japan probably eaten Department stores where variety eateries usually top floors   quite good specialty restaurants days but back days remember seeing something okonomi shokudo where served all kinds food big restaurant all kinds wax displays accurately resembled food served which don't see quite much anymore      Koraku reminds those okonomi shokudo quite style Japan   serve all kinds food curry tempura tonkatsu ramen none them well specialty restaurant sticks genre food    As family eat curry tonkatsu ramen can't say impressed any them     I think place may done well 10 years ago but days where compete Cafe de Japon Sora Monta within 2 mile radius may hard time keeping up     The service great place comfy showa retro thing going want place but quality food just didn't me     I'm still waiting authentic tonkatsu place Vegas    please   someone bring over  <EOR> Finally around Koraku! new Ramen house Spring Mtn course! does fair?  I thought all ingredients fresh tasty but chashu more thick less tender most  broth little mellow full flavor depth but still good  would recommend trying since every place town does little different    the reasons wasn't blown away might reason it   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=oD10Sx3yR8wQtoJTp9CVxA#oD10Sx3yR8wQtoJTp9CVxA  I also tried Shrimp Tempura which good!  Large shrimps flavorful batter    overall yummy   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw#NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw  And quick pic Miso Soup included rice dish   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos koraku ramen las vegas?select=NPjSLZu0H3VexEzoEdDFNw#M3PXRlpbbnuXJSt02OKqZg  Service fast friendly   restaurant little quiet but clean   Bathroom probably cleanest walked into while lol   and incense nice touch   Overall happy try it! Just sure when back truthfully  <EOR> my family going years! used love stateline inside outlets primm valley but still come even though moved  love gyoza curry ramen! still same great taste always favorite whenever visit vegas! give try! <EOR> I've never actually bad ramen before but ramen pretty bad  first place where broth some sort pork broth  Instead basically just water spicy flavoring it  Super bland   The prices cheap compared average ramen place but guess there's reason why cheap here  <EOR> Miso ramen mini hamburger katsu great! would back but when first walked workers talking amongst themselves sat ourselves then waitress came bring menus only other person dining restaurant  <EOR> Very good ramen reasonably priced  curry well excellent  back sure  <EOR> The tofu appetizer pretty plain but still delicious if fact tofu dress cucumber various little toppings green onion  Tofu pack cheap appetizer which believe half pack quite worth price   If order Volcano Ramen would probably give Koraku 3 5  haphazardly thrown vegetables just seemed unappealing  guess gotten used eating ramen only basics nori chashu  However best friend middle school Japanese mom would ramen same haphazardly thrown vegetables nostalgic twist    It wasn't vegetables did though  broth  spicy level Volcano Ramen okay but just type spice weirded out  tasted didn't belong ramen but would rather some type curry dish    Why 4 5 stars then? miso ramen! Whenever try new ramen place always miso first time there  Now am die hard Monta fan but think Koraku's miso ramen suits taste just well  might decadent rich Monta's but also where shines  chashu isn't fatty but still maintains its richness texture  broth very yummy heavy noodles cooked just okay maybe tad soft but always preferred firm noodles anyway    Our waiter seemed somewhat shy reluctant serving though if he forced into job  Maybe he's just new?   On another note ice water tasted really good cheap tap  +1 Koraku  I'd definitely come again miso  <EOR> I've bookmarked location knowing serve Tenshin Mabo Tofu  way home decided stop give try since wanting try different ramen location usuals   I ordered Moyashi bean sprout Itame Ramen without pork due being pesceterian won't consume meat  Also ordered half Chahan fried rice side  seemed quite busy when walked even hour open despite negative reviews read pretty excited   To start felt mountain Moyashi bit over seasoned which ended making soup taste same didn't really taste soup itself  However noodles wavy chewy type which definitely enjoyed   The fried rice which also without pork wasn't bad but wasn't impressed either  bit oily where couldn't finish neither bowls   I desperately craving ramen place definitely filled but sure if having Moyashi ramen next time  definitely need try Tenshin Mabo next time!!!
