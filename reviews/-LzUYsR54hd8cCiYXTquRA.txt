Gone festive colorful feel old buffet  Welcome dreary somber feel corporate gloom  grey walls all over seating area separate food other diners  literally nothing look at  miss whimsical signs directing various types food serve  Still no restroom buffet   I lunch today found even though raised entry price didn't see any roast beef turkey shrimp craw fish old buffet  Perhaps missed them because food area more spread no signs   They also eliminated any dedicated line disabled people which shows don't realize much older customer base most casinos  Maybe just don't care  Remember said whoever charge foolish inconsiderate customer needs!  Whoever made new pricing also foolish post website door breakfast 8am 10am lunch 11am 3 pm  happens between 10am 11am? called asked told if come 10am charged lunch price $3 more BUT won't any lunch items until 11am when start putting out! made ripoff deal up? Maybe rushed come new ridiculous pricing  only 4 long months before reopened  READ UPDATE BELOW     To sum cold dreary atmosphere raised prices but fewer pricey foods no accommodations  handicapped people unnecessary walls all around still no restrooms buffet unreasonable high pricing etc  definite step wrong direction me  much preferred way used be!  UPDATE back today new buffet take another look found given incorrect information yesterday  reason lack pricing between 10am 11am actually close stop admitting customers hour! same thing 3pm 4pm  retired don't keep track time anymore  Orleans gamble soon run money hungry head buffet  Now worry if it'll open since close twice two hours day during daytime  guess find somewhere else gamble eat  <EOR> While working talking bus driver call JOE because THATS NAME!! talking Buffets he said try one  show truly nice people encountered thus far Las Vegas Joe only recommendation place BUT gives $4 off coupon meets Tropicana Ave give drives wife daughter way run errands  COOL THAT?? Answer VERY!! ended paying $5 change AWESOME Buffet using coupon  let tell now PLACE HUGE!! entire dining area big basketball court if bigger  size crowd hand very nice orderly atmosphere well lit pleasantly quiet no crying babies no standing Peekers looking over back booth sitting in  I feed them string beans!! I asked seated booth gladly told sit wherever wanted  several stations = BBQ American Mongolian Chinese Mexican Italian HUGE island deserts   I made good attempt try many items many stations could ended liking Chinese station best spring noodles mixed wt vegetables Beef  really fresh good   Joe really pushed BBQ Beef ribs saying best but selection day ALOT fat them pick them take off  while complaining might add onion rings fried fish chicken fried steak ALOT breading them picking well  Other though really cant complain give place 2 thumbs up   The Mexican station extremely good beef tacos all toppings spicy shredded chicken made nice tacos well  other selections such enchaladas etc all looked very good   The Italian station speghetti lasagna pizza all looked really good too  sliver slice very good crispy tried couple pcs eggplant parmesean off hook good    There also peel n eat shrimp wt tartar cocktail sauce well crawfish which looked good still cannot see draw things its alot work very little pay off way meat  chose stick wt shrimp mixed them wt Chinese noodles mix sliced open couple spring rolls put them inside  always shrimp spring rolls!!  The aforementioned Desert Island little everything = soft serve ice cream strawberry whipped cream toppings scooped Ice Cream Gellato Pies Cakes Cheesecake cobblers  tried Coconut Cream Pie filling off hook I 2 pcs stop myself getting more!! but crust soft mushy like liking all didnt eat it  also tried some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream  wt whipped cream taste shortening whipped cream came through more cream sugar needed   The waitstaff seemed nice enough but Ice Water was'nt refilled nor asked if needed refill  didn t wasnt really big deal  girl taking plates off table seemed working hardest felt bad took plates myself several times  also hid dollar under dish within dish she would find waiter she deserved more waiters did   Overall recommend buffet only wide variety selection but quality good food offered  only paid $5 but paid full price would still worth it  <EOR> Brunch gives all breakfast staples Corned beef hash = reminds dog food but maybe  just corned beef hash Eggs Benedict  Waffles pancakes French toast = really dry Omelets = dry extras didn't taste fresh  Bacon sausage Scrambled eggs = Really runny could actually slurp up Chicken fried steak = super dry gravy mediocre  Sweet potato pancake = thing actually ok best thing buffet Hash browns = ok can't screw those up! Syrup = super thin runny <EOR> Let's honest here  Caesars Palace but doesn't mean good buffet venue you're eating at   To start understand actually owned corporation owns several different casinos town most them called Coast  example Gold Coast Suncoast   Which means you're going simular quality all buffets but Orleans actually slightly above cut others   I'm only going talking seafood night because if pay few dollars more only night sense go   So Friday nights Seafood night  Typically Las Vegas night most hotels put Seafood   It sense doesn't it? People paid Fridays Seafood consumed when people paid extra money unlike strip hotels which jack prices put food every day week local hotels casinos operate seafood   Okay getting here?  Well addition regular fare you're also getting snow crap period Orleans snow crab pretty decent  skinny small actually quite large compared other hotels town   It comes served cold but also take over Mongolian cooking station heated different spices which something no else offers   Word warning though if you're can't eat seafood then should probably avoid Mongolian station all together  literally cross contaminate crazy which only reason can't give early true 5 star review   Everything else buffet actually quite good  food fresh turned over regular basis   The dessert bar actually great gelato lots different desserts anybody's tastes  room dessert when one   I only assume rest week just Friday nights but just without Seafood exception shrimp  highly recommend Orleans versus other local hotels Las Vegas because quality pretty darn good wait times low service great  <EOR> Great selection! Sunday brunch lox bagels which favorite things eat  also great omlet station  love fruits vegetables which fresh be  love Asian section great food there  normally lemon chicken sesame chicken chicken dish  great selection mexican food part well italian part  If your hotel i'd recommend it  cannot food price    Go hungry because great amount food serve  meat great whenever out    Dessert awesome! everything there  <EOR> Disgusting food! Nice new remodeling though   worth eating price   $14 99 brunch per adult   Flies cookies desserts section   Stale bread  Just gross! <EOR> Go lunch if want crawfish beef ribs you'll enjoy buffet  Desserts hit miss worth money dinner    Staff very friendly but food huge disappointment meal intro Orleans hotel dining   will stick old time fav Spice Market PH  <EOR> Mold pie told chef he told just burn marks  Never seen burn marks green  where leaving he yelling dessert lady pulling all pie eating  Only thing good place drinks  Even prime rib over cooked dry   Gross shrimp scampi people rave slimy  <EOR> I loved price buffet Italian Mexican American  Chinese BBQ Mongolian seafood dessert gelato few others missed  place little run down torn booths sunk in  Took while drink but waitress extremely attentive afterwards she explained she large party upstairs   The Mexican food meh taco shells weren't crunchy fell apart take bite  Ribs excellent BBQ stand Mac n cheese yummy  Seafood good except hated fact peel shrimp    Dessert station good recommend gelato cream puffs    I give four stars because cleanliness dessert station mess seen lot different foods mixed others    I encountered group tourists strong body odor not hotels fault but made lose appetite  <EOR> Pros good price buffet even better if rewards card nice selection foods delicious desserts   Cons most food subpar due possibly being reused many times and or over cooked sushi horrible cold hard rice We bit disappointed visit  heard Medley better old buffet finally chance try it  Honestly if you're absolutely starving then somewhere else  decided unless someone willing pay then most likely won't coming back  <EOR> Went breakfast buffet  3 people clearly told lady 3 people apparently charged 2 staff getting angry only having charged 2  Finally told lady charge other person gave money  Could handled better  Picked eggs Benedict     tasted windex made ladies sick food poisoning but thinking it  Sausage overdone almost burnt  Cake tasted stale  good all  Very dissappointed  <EOR> First off   I'm just going say buffet pretty great dessert section off strip property  definitely save room dessert  endless flavors gelato different kinds cakes pastries some sugar free well    Second   they good variety food items available small salad bar Mexican Italian Chinese BBQ station  simple kind girl when comes buffets  really don't care seafood all fancy smancy stuff  Just give basics  spaghetti meatballs eggrolls enchiladas dumplings BBQ meats sausages etc etc   you idea  $8 99 per person weekday lunch   you can't that  <EOR> Hands down best Thanksgiving buffet outside Las Vegas Strip  server Morgan gave extraordinary table service!  We line around 12pm inspite busy Medley led table around 12 30 The kitchen staff spot! wasn't any cold dish anywhere unless course meant cold  meat dishes tender juicy  veggies crisp  salad fruit dessert bars equally good   I thanked supervising managers noting two them helped clear set tables keep incoming guests seated   teamwork!  It's no wonder Medley fave buffet  Highly recommended   Now line before run ham Turkey steak! Not! LOL! <EOR> Don't often write bad reviews but unfortunately happens   Buffet remodeled prices average $5 00 but quality suffers  Let's start dessert station most items fairly bland custard tasted more flour egg ice cream sorbet gelato did basic chocolate coffee flavors mention mint chip did very good   main entrees over cooked fried items crunchy hard onion rings fried chicken  redeeming item chicken gumbo soup  I won't giving place another try while needless say  <EOR> This second time coming buffet food pretty okay however asked time buffet supposed close   buffet closed 0900pm little bit time wanted some dessert before left   over dessert place worker hollerin' out   we're closed!! Then he proceeds turn light walked away very disappointed   spending $159   really?  sure if worth come back  <EOR> I French Market Buffet Orleans Saturday brunch  $15 person totally worth it  should gone TGIF which also located Orleans   The food sub par  only two items tasty ribs gelato + both which ask server for  different food stations but themed dishes worthy  Customer service great but still nothing memorable location    Please save your $$$ try another buffet  <EOR> I honestly gave 2 stars because $21  if your short cash want edible food your place  warmest food tacos made fresh those room temperature  Pork ribs bloody when brought cooks attention he told smoke yep cause now smoke runs meat sure!!! prime rib cold tough new piece meat he cutting  Manapua bomb!!! Best thing buffet  <EOR> Major disappointment   Lunch December 2017 $12 95 without players club card food completely forgettable can't recall single item only utilized half serving stations not lot choice    did money's worth   Now back early 2000's very good value buffet which feaured decent food modest prices  No more   still Orleans rooms clean spacious well appointed   But newly renovated buffet huge disappointment insult once French Market Buffet <EOR> Worth every cent!

The beef ribs prime rib carvers station pretty good probably favorite things day  mostly took chances huge variety seafood offer  salmon king crab snow crab shrimp craw fish mussels clams all very good  craw fish sort complicated eat crab legs which crazy long line haha  Fine maybe just dumb don't know eat but still getting impatient craw fish crab legs  much work much meat haha    They omelet station where omelets made picking want it  whatever impressed takes long isn't best omelet ever  whole USA section buffet pretty bland very typical breakfast foods but boring flavorless  love breakfast foods but fail  deserts looked awesome but just little bit ice cream didn't want into food coma after   Too bad driving home otherwise would've taken advantage unlimited Champagne made them fill Viva boot haha  really wanted eat usual Sunday night dinner which rib night but since Easter Seafood Brunch special oh well maybe next year  <EOR> Sometimes just need office gang some fun! fine   and close    place it! Field Trip Friday lunch spot  load ourselves into couple cars drive over $8 99 bond over mediocre A Y C E Buffet  No harm that!  OK food kinda mediocre but LOT it! And deserts favorite! Next time maybe just eat sugary treats? <EOR> Decent clean fair qaulity! Large variety options   Not most buffets place more sides then main staple items  <EOR> My husband tagged along mom's high school reunion   invited dinner French Market Orleans   buffet ok   hard time getting something liked   only thing remembered crab legs soup   Other then that   everything else bleh    <EOR> Cheap!
