I'm loving all new food treasures Downtown lately!  joint walking distance dad's office stopped other day   fitting old courtroom decor movie posters Inherit Wind!  I immediately decided brown rice bowl Limonata dad ordered wrap   only ones enjoying late lunch but staff made feel welcome without close 30 minutes vibe quite enjoyable   I'm looking foward next meeting Downtown   hopefully around lunchtime stop again   Also could perfect spot Saturday brunch! <EOR> A good find location limited dining options   usually rice bowls very nice balanced flavors some interesting seasonings sauces   Try Bench Warrant Thai peanut curry chicken Bounty Hunter roasted pork black beans    Healthy ingredients too!  Decor pleasant also staff   Wasn't huge fan salad tried once  chop dice everything including lettuce which banged lettuce much opinion   If try salad again ask them just dice add ins leave lettuce leaves alone   Still check if you're area easily best option neighborhood  <EOR> Generally speaking downtown lunch scene limited kind all over place   Enter Verdict's Inn   great solid place lunch downtown   My favorite thing salad there's create your own salad option where $7 all ingredients little heart desires   There's charge some extras avocado extra protein   But never paid $7 flat salad 10 toppings own choosing boot  stuff others would likely find repulsive   Hello cranberries salami mandarin oranges olives!  love that   They chop salad toppings seems different   But salad any other chop still salad just good   Also portions big satisfying    I've also Old Man hot dog which delicious   All hot dogs named Pawn Stars stars which dig     At times take long time but grand scheme things okay a when take into account awesome salad option b consider comparable lunch options downtown Vegas   Getting early lunch rush also seems help           As tip there's parking lot customers directly across street Gass   Initially parking seemed limited meters Gass or walking    remedied!  Overall Verdict's Inn good take any day over Quizno's  <EOR> ok  ridiculously addicted chopped salads  great pick your own toppings its impossible mess up   Friendly staff great service great location  cake pops? Diet Coke? WINNING! <EOR> Yummy! Amazing chopped salads prepared uniquely you  Cute atmosphere clean friendly  Nice stop good lunch  <EOR> The salads tasty but bit pricey  Lunch two small drinks $23!  expected cheaper Jason's Deli's salad bar because fewer standard choices i e  pudding humus cottage cheese    menu doesn't offer many non salad lunch options either   bright side ambiance nice vintage movie photos great touch  <EOR> Sigh       another could lunch spot downtown   Since downtown's main industry appears law herds lawyers running around suits all day designing lunch restaurant around law clever idea   walked into place ready its cheerleader ready excited finally solid lunch spot downtown   But       service awful feel bad saying because looks they're trying but slow   Frighteningly slow   should just know you're gonna wait long time if lunch    just unacceptable downtown lunch spot   good lunch spot business law clientele needs turn burn   few times however wait just hasn't improved   As menu ambitious   sure they've final menu items nailed down but they've some good options salads sandwiches   few sandwiches salads they're good   great   huge plus ingredients fresh   Sadly  rare compliment downtown Vegas   But other negative Verdict staff gets confused easily   given wrong order least twice   If service starts executing orders faster correctly some tasty options would love cheer about   All average price $9 salad $8 50 sandwich    hefty price many problems service food  only good enough   And said still want place succeed   downtown workers need succeed   There's few options outside Fremont casinos downtown workers   back periodically hope Verdict's Inn improves  <EOR> I'm no expert but would assume its good idea open restaurant until you're able provide best service your full product   I read review Las Vegas Seven magazine place sounded great  Walking place looked charming described magazine but menu definitely limited  Just sandwiches hot dogs smoothies veggie bowls smoothies   I made mistake ordering turkey sandwich which just regular sandwich bread plan deli meat cheese gross white part lettuce soggy tomatoes  worth price all  order chips literally I counted them 7 chips   Their chopped salads looked something you'd clean lawn mower but nearly everyone int he restaurant eating one   My dining partner hotdog offensively long only served small thimble sized servings mustard ketchup relish onions   Again price location you'd expect least *some* effort into dishes   I've tried Verdict's Inn recently because close office because smoothies aren't bad but seriously mess smoothie? but doors locked  sure if they've already gone business they've decided wait open when they're able serve good food   I hoped best because location but if you're downtown you're hungry until Verdicts Inn act together you're better off 6th Fremont  <EOR> Cool find downtown Las Vegas!  took over old Potato Valley Café which awesome but just good if better   This restaurant specializes make your own chopped salad   fill form http www theverdictsinn com images VI_Chopped_Salad_Form pdf let magic happen   Unlimited ingredients   Whatever dream up   Then chop serve you   Very tasty only $7 unless add meat avocado artichoke which cost extra   comes pretzel bread which isn't best but passable     I also tried chicken burrito $6 which special occasionally   made brown rice ton vegetables   yummy!  comes salsa sour cream tortilla chips   tortilla chips weren't great kind stale   But burrito excellent   Really fresh ingredients all difference     They serve wraps soups smoothies hot dogs addition daily specials   legal theme cute   offer repeat offender card where free wrap smoothie hot dog 9 meals   Good lunch places sparse downtown definitely repeat offender  <EOR> I am completely biased due fact live above restaurant but say Italian sandwich live for! almost religiously fact enjoy amazingly healthy smoothie experience all better    Though only open few months where heading food selections    The Verdicts Inn great place nice lunch people watch especially since 100ft world famous Pawn Stars! <EOR> I really wanted place good  day afternoon felt employees disappointed walked in  tables all dirty buy some rags folks food very pricey get  sandwiches nothing better you'd home some cold cuts cheap loaf bread  money you'll spend could buy ingredients weeks worth sandwiches just good  <EOR> They offer wide variety options but some work do  great your own salad option which nice  staff isn't friendly seem tad over priced standard items offer  seating crammed during lunch often little messy  still good place downtown but wouldn't way  <EOR> Well gave shot   twice    before writing review   co worker mentioned seeing place while back when saw Groupon decided I'd give try   cobb salad first time eh   second time made own chopped salad forgot artichoke hearts totally skimped turkey which pay extra for    salad super overdressed pretty soggy time back office which 2 blocks away    service slow seems lot confusion behind counter   understand hasn't more couple months but really   get your shit together    $10 salad isn't worth nonsense! <EOR> The food good but price brought down three stars  just can't spend $8 $9 sandwich   If want spend type money sitdown place  <EOR> I've tried place twice   first time ate ordered Bench Warrant rice bowl   totally disgusting few bites me   impressed   second time ordered egg sandwich   messes egg sandwich??
