Topped arugula salad balanced meaty cheesiness enchiladas  Cumin Grilled Skirt Steak SUPER tender very flavorful! Would honestly prefer steak alone over steaks some your average steakhouses certain extent  Spicy Shrimp Tacos My family agreed slightly underwhelming breading shrimp mushy didn't offer much flavor other dishes  can't recall if special menu not  Yucatan Pork Some places pork chewy and or dry but definitely neither super tender moist  lacked little flavor which would've made complete but still enjoyable!  Overall think restaurant lives its Yelp rating  came full satisfied tastebuds while spending excessively common Vegas especially since Yelp offers 15% off! more could ask <EOR> Really good food pricy but Las Vegas nothing new  waiters check regularly  good even manager came asked everything  hot sauce isn't hot but habanero sauce just perfect hot mild  wouldn't call authentic but really good  good Mexican restaurant try Vegas  <EOR> I ordered creamy potato tacos best tacos ever had! don't know anything else menu but potato tacos very different amazing <EOR> Love brunch   Small plates made order unlimited Mimosas flavor day   Plantain empanadas spicy chicken tamale tres leches french toast Yucatan eggs benedict all delicious  Waiting Churro  Tots abs Bbq  brisket sliders finish off  Good service decent place if small group  Also take reservations if you're worried  <EOR> OMG!!!!!!

The ambiance leaves bit desired inside large shopping center but food it  wish brunch offered daily! <EOR> I thoroughly enjoyed experience Border Grill forum shops  server Matthew Boston awesome  going short Rib enchiladas saw everyone raving Yelp but he steered Chicken Poblano Enchiladas instead green sauce shitake mushrooms  Awesome! Definitely sleeper pick here    He also recommended try fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade boy treat coming Vegas heat  also tried carnitas which moist tasty but didn't wow chicken Poblano enchiladas    The place probably more expensive your local mexican place but considering where expensive everything else worth it  <EOR> Aside Frontera Grill can't imagine fancy Mexican being successful venture  However if place open restaurant where rich blow some cash expensive tacos Vegas city it  While Border Grill pretty well known weekend brunch ceviche bar also big draw    While sure all waiters trained push border guacamole tableside show appetizer felt little Chili's me  three ceviches choose figured closest being local Baja would freshest  Unfortunately metallic aftertaste  Hopefully wasn't taste mercury poisoning won't Jeremy Pivened    For entrees tried quesadillas tacos  first look may seem overpriced still very well could be  But admit most ingredients quesadillas tacos types restaurants haphazardly thrown together  hope overcooked meat covered melted cheese guacamole sour cream  But found citrus grilled chicken juicy tender  grilled fish tacos great well loved substitution grapefruit acidic component    The portions pretty large service excellent  drinks refreshing great meal  If still coconut mojito must try  <EOR> Amazing food cool casual setting! 4 5 stars   Went hangover cure lunch BG definitely delivered   seated right away nice attentive server   Started sparkling blood orange lemonade which super tasty!

This same going buffet but completely different! dishes only prepared fresh when ordered not sitting around buffet but executive chef come some amazing renditions taste ridiculous  all 10 10 may settle 9 10 8 10 but most simply amazing   I really felt ripping place off  Anywhere LV else would easily cost 3 4 times quality presentation overall experience   Unfortunately mentioned above am foodie knowing may back try lot dishes leaving feeling way stuffed but super happy I write review 4 weeks later still remember Benedict steak eggs Chile relleno tamale not traditional one shrimp grits we ordered twice super fresh ceviche  Crazy good   WHAT FIND! Anyone coming LV would nuts come great meal believe don't sing restaurant's praises very often    Thank guys making place is  <EOR> I liked place! food pretty good! only thing lot big party's felt kind ignored  girl came took plate waited 20 minutes before she came back check  But understanding  But other great would definitely come back next time we're here! <EOR> Given reviews may just bad experience  love Mexican food less impressed place  sat bar three different bartenders involved service which seemed service worse rather better seemed unclear to all taking care me  margarita solid but excellent  guacamole decent chips above average but presentation guacamole lacking slapped onto side plate  All three salsas excellent  chicken poblano enchiladas disappointing  biggest issue temperature barely luke warm  flavor ok but enough near absence cheese apparently favorite part enchilada   side plantains excellent  overall definitely mixed bag given price ultimately worth visit  <EOR>
