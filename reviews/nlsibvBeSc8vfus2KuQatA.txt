Love ice cream!  different store bought   When hot Vegas great place cold down indulge delicious sweet creations   line when but did good system people jump line   need work otherwise could people offended   price bit high but quality top notch  <EOR> Omg! best ice cream ever! four scoop sampler because hard decide just flavor!

Spouse House Buckeye best two flavors  <EOR> Being Youngstown thrilled when heard Handel's opening Las Vegas   and mere two blocks house   new location reminds ones Y'town    walk windows no seating    great ice cream   Some little richer sweeter I'd choc   peanut butter chocolate raspberry truffle stick chocolate malt w caramel banana creme pie chocolate pecan chocolate marshmallow   The only two downsides walk wait  said  Youngstown why expect different here? <EOR> I give Handel's 5 stars because always search blueberry cheesecake never want  Handel's Blueberry Cobbler ice cream hits spot  delicious   Blueberry swirls rich creamy sweet ice cream cookie pie pieces mixed in   happy camper <EOR> I would rate them lower if ice cream wasn't good  always Oreo ice cream simply because board overwhelming don't know what's any funny nicknames flavors but reluctant come back because customer service always less desirable  First isn't anywhere sit because always people sitting bench outside time home comfortable eat ice cream melted  Second just stupid window which feel completely isolated person making your ice cream when literally shut window while you're talking  last people always take forever  doing back there? All scoop ice cream    just talking something don't know about    work coldstone actually know long takes ACTUALLY mix ice cream  Theirs pre made no sense why takes long    ice cream good but worth waiting forever getting window shut you <EOR> Lots lots fun flavors good prices   tried 4 flavor sampler loved all four ones tried   Looking forward going back trying more   only wish air conditioned seating area! <EOR> Tried place several times several different flavors ice cream   Each time came away thinking ice cream average   pretty soft   almost hybrid hard pack soft serve melts pretty fast   would say high cream content higher end ice creams   Just does special creamy goodness  <EOR> Coconut cream new favorite flavor!  creamy plenty coconut flavor    several times ice cream never disappoints   banana splits best   traditional!   only reason dinging 1 star wait    sometimes takes awhile your ice cream especially if line  <EOR> Cannot seem figure best flavor  am Chocolate flavor person heart  banana split waaàaaaaa6yyyyyyyyyytyty big  But ice cream itself nice creamy full flavor  joint but gets busy when kids just hanging all over while wait almost much wait for  Anyhow ice cream worth once your turn  <EOR> Solid ice cream creations   Very friendly staff and accommodating fast service   Will back <EOR> Who doesn't love ice cream boiling hot day? many choices worst thing trying decide which flavor order! banana cream pie which fantastic  Super creamy really tasted homemade    I'd recommend doing four scoop sampler though simply because taste more delicious flavors! <EOR> Wonderful ice cream seasonal flavors experience even better!

Now waiting for? off your bottom head west your 1st lick sure won't last! <EOR> I hate giving place perfect review but management team owners need know some workers cheats!   I 2 year old loves ice cream but he's ready regular cones yet baby come offer perfect  He loves vanilla right amount  Every time family order no problem but today helped teenager maybe early 20s kid refused give any  He explained the baby cones babies! He wants ice cream he needs regular size! sorry but rule now only infant baby size cone? wasn't even matter price because know offer baby cones free but if big deal would paid because just right size him  But guys literally refused! don't know if he trying money thought taking advantage but put bad taste mouth!  My family loves place  ice cream always good perfect any hot Las Vegas Sumer day! store itself deserves 5stars most workers met past genuinely pleasant seem love jobs unlike guy unfortunately helped today! <EOR> Most amazing ice cream planet! happy hometown ice cream finally came vegas!!! Yum! <EOR> This place seems busy usually but can't understand why  dead tonight Sunday 7 30 pm  three times seems employees never know doing  What's strange leave dippers freezer which impossible scoop ice cream  Each time watch them struggle trying scoop ice cream dipper  never heard dip well leave dippers trickles water scoops always rinsed?  Tonight banana split which supposed split banana hence banana split laid along side three scoops container but only few slices dropped beside ice cream  Then he put whipped cream first before toppings  Common sense should tell wrong anyone ever seen picture banana split but he's untrained teen can't blame him  toppings only very awful tasting over portioned crushed pineapple crushed maraschino cherries  Absolutely awful  then no chocolate syrup no nuts  Then he hands open container pineapple crushed cherries spilling all down side where he ineptly tried put toppings along side ice cream whipped cream  Can't put top whip cream came first    The last time hot fudge sundae also no nuts smidgen fudge  way looks always unappealing  happens when turn your store over run teenagers attitude  really don't care serving when you're looking sweet treat lift its quite frustrating served crap   They opened store nice neighborhood families probably little more average families expendable income  If provided better customer experience better product presentation could away charging more  Serving poor quality product giving poor service just because price low mixture success    I doubt back there  <EOR> This place delicious   only reason didn't give 5 Stars seating situation   If indoor seating would easy 5 Stars   staff friendly patient took while read through all flavors   look forward going back  <EOR> Yum!

Absolutely love it! <EOR> I'll start off saying completely biased toward Handel's  Youngstown Ohio where ice cream chain originated 10 20 years ago but 70 years ago  Because eating ice cream since 80s ice cream standard use compare everything else   As far service procedure person window he she takes your order cashes out  Everything made when ordered including hand packing pints quarts  no seating  areas aside few benches  way done original Handel's Market Midlothian which wait least 15 20 minutes line eat ice cream inside outside your car  Should continue procedure 1945? Absolutely hopefully they'll some changes  now just prepared wait enjoy your ice cream somewhere else beside table bench   We shared banana split last visit same delicious ice cream always is  Some may think sweetness creaminess factors high but just right me  70 years worth satisfied customers also agree me  <EOR> Love selections ice cream variety sizes enjoy benches when walking take home friends enjoy  <EOR> Yum!!!
