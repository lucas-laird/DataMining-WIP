Worst organization skills here!   Ughhhhh why did pay $120 place  should've gone McDonald's  <EOR> My friend decided stop quiet dinner before leaving vegas  thought would great because way creperie also must  Awkwardly enough italian restaurant Paris but food ended being pretty great  sea bass friend open faced lobster ravioli  both very impressed seabass which came gnocci olives  Also bread serve before dinner DELISH   Service could better but overall good meal  <EOR> This place started off shakey when waiting line when clearly many open tables  ain't no club Le Provencal! No need long lines bouncers front    Alas Dad dead set going bc grumbling tummy dislike walking anymore  Finally seated   scarf down bread which pretty yummy nice soft chewy   special set menu which 2 people appetizer soup salad entree fish pasta chicken desert sorbet cookies   just ordered Nicoise salad bc wasn't hungry someone else tuscan white bean soup salad  food wasn't mindblowing but key think exactly paid hence A OK  wasn't expensive food tasty I actually really enjoyed salad wished tad bigger soup bit salty but pasta yummy salmon cooked well pretty good sized portions service line great  waitress sweet lady midway through meal turned into singing waitress   a little odd admit but hey more power getting spot fame even if little restaurant  <EOR> I 3 course meal love also coupon use it  Food good best remember then but still good  <EOR> We used groupon figured would excuse hang strip  quite sure why described french restaurant yelp because its certainly Italian  offer selection antipasti pizza napoletano   so think error   Anyway seated immediately near corner fountain  interior somewhat nice waitress friendly  decided share three course meals because figured would enough food two moderate appetites indeed correct    started mussels simmered marinara flavored sauce  chewy well flavored  really no complaints them other sauce seemed bit runny time us  gobbled them no time soon treated new york strip steak    We chosen garlic potatoes fettucine alfredo sides  Both adequate  liked potatoes just hint garlic flavor them weren't overpowering  fettucine cooked just right  soggy  sauce bit light but welcome   steak itself cooked perfectly even medium rare red strip throughout body  typical new york steaks course because consistency meat does vary appreciably throughout cut  seasoning similar when ordering steak other italian restaurants   The dessert however really impressed me  chose Tiramisu honestly can't remember last time some good this  assuming bake house but if I'd sure find where from   Bottom line favorable experience groupon very satisfied value recieved  would rate them 3 5  they fall just short 4 because ultimately didn't feel standout quality would return pay full price here  No complaints service food cooked well dessert highlight  But just many good italian restaurants spot stick out  <EOR> Stay away place  very overpriced food thought edible but tastes very blah  6 people table today  Hoped nice dinner  I think Olive garden would better then that  <EOR> We last week because line Le Village Buffet  big mistake  Honestly expected more because location but WORST experience entire trip  When arrived restaurant two waitresses paying attention customer all  First told wait line but many empty tables still waited 10 min  For record people behind also complaining ordered dishes Mashroom risotto calamari escargo took over HOUR I am exaggerating bring just apetizer   I hoped risotto taste better but tasted horrible    actually worst risotto ever tasted  tasted bad only 3 bites left remaining  Calamari very oily crunchy  happy escargo appetizer well  I am never going back place      <EOR> This French restaurant confused thinks Italian  Food worth money   or any money matter    Service wasn't good either  <EOR> It located inside Paris Hotel Casino lively old European setting   Le Provencal's walls covered murals French countryside   The restaurant little pricey   glad gave place try   pleasant experience fairly good meal  sure bring your Total Rewards card because almost all items menu discounted $1  <EOR> Good food  am still laughing other reviews place saying italian food horrible   I split chicken dish very good  don't remember called though just specialties    I ask breadbasket  1 star My

it  dessert assortment sweets  macaroons chocolate mousse cakes jello type dessert  only comment mousse cake which delicious  just amount sweet  macaroon jello person didn't eat them all pretty full    After eating felt pretty ripped off  meal should worth price  Most likely coming back  <EOR> the only star delicious bread nice water server   we probably should've just made bread water dinner

Salty?  Intense?  Rich?  sure   But could only eat half where goat cheese concerned totally unlike me  The mamacita's minestrone also featured undercooked beans which meant she only ate half meal well  The good news leaves room dessert!  ordered creme brulee sufficiently underwhelmed   Now remember why never really liked stuff  A wholehearted meh   Plus star singing suppose  <EOR> The pre dinner bread good but great lacking sea salt herbs oil vinegar caprezi fresh flavorful though little sea salt would give more punch flavors  Ribeye perfectly cooked though could bit warmer sauce great  wife Parmesean encrusted chicken needed lemon even though chicken well cooked good sauce  waiter Kassim quick attentive even though he seemed couple difficult tables addition ours  food portions generous but price range could better quality cuts meat  overall experience good however three stars  <EOR> We intrigued carbonara menu outside door  travelled lot year carbonara husbands favorites  Italy except restaurant disappointing even point having return scrambled eggs pasta back kitchen  Shame Rome! reasonable New York but then waiter came over powdered parmesan  Sad  invited sit charming manager AJ really charming watch  He epitomy front house checking tables being very attentive  waitress Florence great  even tested bit she rose challenge  We both worked restaurants years recognize really good service  WIne refilled perfect time attentive without being cloying friendly but efficient  crab cakes full sweet perfectly spiced well just tad salt maybe but almost perfect  clams Arriabatta perfectly seasoned clams still lovely fresh ocean saltiness tender  carbonara exactly looking al dente noodles lightly swathed perfect carbonara lovely applewood bacon  veal nicely seasoned saucy nicely dressed whipped potato  seemed many satisfied customers night because some strange reason laughter all over place  Infectious happiness all around  Wish place home where service properly cooked carbonara rare    You know hard give perfect five restaurant but couldn't find thing wrong place least night there! loved I'd feel guilty dropping four  deserves five! <EOR> Came enjoy nice dinner while las Vegas  really wasn't much selection beverages wine menu atrocious!
