<EOR> Typical crappy tourist town service only slightly above average tourist town quality   I came late Monday lunch hoping grab patio table some people watching sidewalk  cafe tables near door didn't waitress service right under some needlessly loud speakers  handfull tables enclosed patio area just needed cleared  waited good 10 minutes tables cleared day wasn't busy    The only person cleaning tables super skinny waitress clearly loathed idea clearing tables  Watching apathy only highlights afternoon    The hostess unapologetic  Eventually asked if restaurant busboys today  answer  apathetic too   So took only open seats bar back street ordered  food only slightly better food you'll average ethnic restaurant tourist town  rice surprisingly confusingly garlic ey  beef burrito meh tasted little bit freezer burn  shredded beef steak menu says  Cadalic margarita average  $18 burrito  $15 margarita  Why put on strip wallet abuse?  The pretty pierced bartender friendly helpful but feeling due own good personality training expectations restaurant    Overall feeling Pay and save $10 cab use Yelp find Mexican restaurant elsewhere cares quality service  hope bartender finds place deserves her  <EOR> Whilst walking along strip handed some flyers $3 margaritas Diablo's    well would rude say no wouldn't it?

However atmosphere doesn't mean thing when bar worst customer service ever experienced strip  am local lived valley over 15yrs all experiences strip else where far worst  respect paying premium prices cocktails strip but expect great customer service quality  bartenders rudest ever encountered never return bar  Experience yourself regret paying extreme prices horrible rude service  <EOR> Service blew harder cat 5 hurricane old bald guy behind margarita bar grumpier George Costanza's dad   gave two stars since free beer waiting 45 minutes carne asada!  Seriously now    <EOR> Insanely good fajitas   mom wanted because she read latest rage movie stars   admit quite skeptical   menu did look authentic seemed super loud   quite loud but say dreaming fajitas ever since went   FIRST stop next time back Vegas  <EOR> This place isn't bad any means    it's just nothing write home about  If want Tex Mex Vegas place might but Texas food wouldn't stand chance Lone Star State   ordered chips salsa $4 pretty good   also chicken fajitas came all right things pico de gallo sour cream cheese guacomole everything cooked well but just wasn't awesome  definitely good attempt though  <EOR> So let sit your bar but refuse let your upstairs area where live music expired DL even showed DOD ID?  doesn't sense shouldn't asked ID when served alcohol?  Will never come again even if stay your hotel! <EOR> OK ok     2 stars décor everything else thumbs down  food awful Sorry    I order 3 fish tacos  fish dry flavorless bit cabbage some sort Pico de Gallo side bean rice  real hungry eat it  Anyways worst part all Mexican Restaurant NO SALSA   eat tacos hot sauce bottle which disgusting   EWWWWWWW know say any bad taco fix GOOD SALSA case lacked both  Anyway place nicely decorated seem nice bar  Definably going back there    <EOR> Worst service entire time Vegas   St  Paddy's Day night because some bagpipers going upstairs   just finishing set band complaining lack people watching them   Well would more people perhaps let people sit   tried sitting few times immediately accosted security move  reserved  yet no signs them no people   eventually sit counter runs along sides     It point everything hell   waitress came three different groups two which kept skipping part   gave moved another place   took 30 mins altogether  worst service years  <EOR> Please note purely review Latin Night anything else  before huge line started 11 top floor bar where overlook strip  nice view live band  However seemed weren't very long midnight stopped playing told everyone we'd down first floor close top floor    made no sense  okay while lasted but sure why that  <EOR> Decided come because employees outside handing 2 for 1 drink coupons  boyfriend sat bar couple drinks bartender awesome  believe name Kim  She great personality! Even added snapchat lol  drinks good but 5 stars definitely because her! see her! <EOR> We chose chicken steak nachos good! $20 able split them between THREE starving people! huge! rest group chose some other things menu definitely over priced small but thoroughly impressed nacho plate cannot complain!! people handing 2 1 drink cards take them because drinks pricey if you're during happy hour  heard they're happy hour amazing too!!! <EOR> Literally can't visit vegas without eating LEAST once  Seriously wish more restaurants  Ate last night tenth time food within 8 minutes couldn't stop eating bomb  Gotta try ultimate quesedilla nachos ridiculous jalepeno tacos  love <EOR> Went grab some lunch food service fantastic! Definitely hit spot bartenders game <EOR> If want filler food eat here   If want good Mexican food somewhere else   bland   margarita sweet   sweet   sent back beer   Don't bother many great restaurants Las Vegas  <EOR> This place great happy hour $5 Mexican beers wheel fortune liquor   The food good easily good any Tex Mex style restaurant but damn rip off! WAY expensive portion sizes quality food  Super Nachos good value  But when consider they're just tortilla chips guac sour cream cheese tabasco damn rip off too!  I doubt back except drinks happy hour  <EOR> This place looks cool outside decided give shot  Don't think back  food really Mexican food more American food  Bloody Mary good missing everything would say ! But bartender really efficient  <EOR> This place okay  Came Saturday night drinks music  large party since came pretty early able large table together 2nd floor which very nice open ceiling decor  decor pretty cool very Loteria inspired  all ordered variety specialty drinks individual margaritas pitcher sized margaritas Sancho margarita  Everyone seemed enjoy drinks  bit disappointed large drink but looking forward keeping cup as advertised but server away  did buzz drink but mostly ice which sucked  next time I'd skip large drink top shelf margarita    Secondly music okay  liked lounge y 70's classic rock music but DJ came later good  Anyway pretty net place hang out  No charge if early mellow crowd cool view strip  <EOR> Decent but nothing totally blew water   gets stars solely reason opens strip prime people watching!! There's upstairs deck but didn't check out     Party atmosphere cool vibe fun theme   If you're coming directly Monte Carlo trek down huge ramp you're going into hell!!  Prices reasonable Vegas standards   Food wasn't bad I chicken enchiladas but almost tempted take away star because chips salsa weren't free! Sacrilegious! <EOR> The T shirt bought yes bought shirt says all  only binge drinking if stop  concur when Vegas  LOVE Diablo's Chupacabra drink much go  Loved it! Totally worth price tag  Just right amount jalapeno spice back ground along rim mix spice when want little extra kick  Sweet sour spicy just delightful  highly recommend drink  bartender great too  No free drinks anything but great just same  watch charm pants off girl while taking pack female dogs obviously Jersey girls big hair bright lips small clothes stride while busted balls beer prices  All while keeping 2 bachelors shots beers coming  Just fun experience even if just enjoy people watching  Didn't try food but everything looked ok but chain lots cheese sauce etc  cup  salsa Mexican food  entrance going through Monte Carlo entrance fun def worth peep but entrance off strip very convenient  <EOR> Came casual afternoon lunch wasn't crowded   sat further inside but nice restaurant open Strip best access people watching   BBQ ranch chicken salad pretty good   prices decent   Would come back again?

I should just Mcdonalds something     well then again right next monte carlo which crappy place stay anyways  I should figured    =_= <EOR> Went especially Nachos margaritas  two no way could nor should finished Nachos  huge helping no shortage cheese steak    Staff very pleasant efficient   Music mostly 70's era which suited fine  Loud enough but loud  general however room fairly noisy making conversation across table bit challenge    Overall good experience we'd back especially larger group  <EOR> Was really looking forward margaritas tacos  Boy disappointed!  I el Diablo margarita  love spicy margaritas really excited  Then arrived took first sip  Yuck!!! sweet fake  Seemed very heavy mix nothing natural any way shape form  But still drank whole thing because $14 which actually Vegas guess  horrible    We tacos share added extra taco could each two  think made $20 22 4 tacos  unfortunately $5 piece taco's  beans rice kinda crappy too    All in all way wanted start trip off <EOR> Went watch world cup game during stay Vegas   Through friends told fun place least once    well yeah visit only time go   Walked boyfriend hostess takes table near back corner obstructed view soccer game tv   so ask if sit other empty tables closer tv   Waitress ignores request other hostess said would table cleaned could sit    10 mins later table clear   We ordered pitcher mangorita   it tasted watered down mango juice!! grossed it   switch over beer since didn't want risk getting another watered down overpriced drink   Didn't order any food but if anything drinks then sure didn't miss anything   <EOR> We happened strip try different place dining   Every time walked smells good why try it     We greeted seated immediately   great service friendly waitress quick food delivery   dining area much seating Vegas visitors bar located near front   plenty tv screens around entire place big game just can't miss     We decided split Combo Nachos which steak chicken cheese   actually going order something else when informed large nachos were   She right   could easily split between two three people   Just because huge portion doesn't mean great   very bland me   tried adding hot sauce but only hot sauce available burn your stomach hot   Pretty disappointed    If need drink you'll safe ordering but if food looking I'd keep searching  <EOR> Atmosphere fun! change drink specials every 30 minutes using Spinning Wheel! Chips guac delicious! Burrito very yummy half plenty fill up  group 5 others friends did enjoy pork carnitas didn't eat it waitress manager nice enough deduct $23 receipt without problem! <EOR> Basic cuisine  chicken fajitas which HUGE!

Overall your average Mexican restaurant  <EOR> Drinks overpowering alcohol without any hint flavors ordered   boyfriend brother wife   wife ordered fajitas hot tasted good   brother steak burrito wasn't fantastic but horrible little colder side time it   grilled salmon which hot really good asparagus completely under cooked but meal great   boyfriends steak tacos ice cold we're beans rice    eating leftovers straight fridge bummed brother can't give them good review    <EOR> The food mediocre staff nightmare   waitress rude offering seat two couples came behind before third couple told waiting lot longer   She grudgingly seated then took almost hour come back take order   food nothing could somewhere else strip much better price drinks poorly mixed   If looking unique atmosphere only thing Diablo's Cantina offer  <EOR> Pros server Shelley great!

Unfortunately not  seemed more microwaved food actual fresh food tacos disappointing honestly taco bell better  price charge quality taste food worth it! chips salsa only tasty food night! <EOR> Came Monday afternoon wasn't impressed all  restaurant wasn't busy but getting food took long time service okay  Food okay tasting nothing great  Would definitely check somewhere else good Mexican meal  <EOR> Being Houston Tex Mex girl gotta some A game impress me  ordered chicken enchiladas good but Pappasito's could shut em down night if tried Houston   place known its drinks crazy bar antics though since noon day missed all but hear legendary   thing pass that   BUT if ever again wanted 'fix' Tex Mex place would list  <EOR> This place just O K   wait when seated high bar stool chairs hour feet fell asleep     The service TERRIBLE   waitress difficult find   boyfriend never drink refilled   food below average but prices NOT   super huge Margarita great though only redeeming thing place   Still good location strip   but if looking quality food   keep walking  <EOR> It ok   Served its purpose food drink    Used check coupon easy worth it  <EOR> Took 1 hour Sat table      another hour still haven't seen waitress  writing review because can't order anything unless beg bartender serve me  joke  Margaritas waterty too  <EOR> Kind expensive Mexican Cantina thought   But service great tequila BBQ ribs!  Awesome  <EOR> Went mix family members all above 21   environment fun food plentiful wasn't expensive   Everyone enjoyed meals drinks especially happy hour specials   upstairs patio open until Thursdays which little disappointing  <EOR> Close strip work few friends stopped work sunday grab some nachos drinks watch else but football  Pretty decent mixed drinks enjoyed time hot damn them nachos certainly force reckoned with  Its probably enough feed 3 people hungry  didn't try any entrees but hey if nachos good enough 2 mexicans rolled then its good enough me  bad stop mexican food strip  <EOR> Loud obnoxious spring break strip 12 year olds half naked greeting door  over it  <EOR> Walking down Las Vegas Blvd sweltering summer afternoon passing all more less rock bottom priced beer drink places made Mistake Massive Proportions into Diablo's  Why? looked good outside  those two magic words Happy Hour   We ordered two margaritas chips salsa  Vegas  Where drinks more less free  Diablo margaritas more watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas chips came three tiny wasabi sized bowls non spicy salty green sauces    The bill $32! asked Isn't Happy Hour? But real question should Happy who? Oh $32 included $4 CHARGE chips salsa!!! WTF!!! When last time paid chips salsa? Uh    never!   Moral Don't judge book its cover  Especially when called Diablo's  Better sell your soul somewhere else  <EOR> Ok but great nacho look good but way much cheese just making soggy pile  Drinks ok pitcher best deal Vegas high anywhere else  Good service waitress Veronica   Hostess would off phone service  <EOR> The place any place Vegas very fun   drink margaritas ginormous super good  If want cheap way drunk fat your place  also doing spinning wheel full different deals some them steals!

Even though busy all friendly  personable which rare busy nights  really chance see personality interacted customers often grooved themselves music really good   These elements alone want come back check Diablo's another night just see normally roll more likely back  ! <EOR> I appreciate name    I appreciate location    I find food just alright    I appreciate loudness  If partially deaf neither you bad news may partially deaf patronising establishment  I appreciate being nickled dimed every little thing  does? worse      I appreciate being outright bilked entrance fees UFC® screening supposed complimentary    Start 3* default plus two appreciates = 5* food being just okay equivalent plus 0 = 5* minus three no muy appreciados = 2*    Diablo's Cantina Meh  experienced better  E <EOR> We live Southern California which effectively Mexico know mexican food   Diablo's chips Tostitos out bag salsa tastes looks jar beans definately canned   can't rice margaritas lack tequilla   Service good    food bad   All say Taco Bell some competition  <EOR> Sat myself drinks great time!  Can't rate food but wish something eat     Would back again   Laid back atmosphere! <EOR> Brand spankin' new restaurant bar strip   Lots innovative but not so great cocktails menu  they mojito jalepeno it      guacamole delicious!  Although $8 you'd expect more couple spoonfuls it!  food decent bar ambiance fun   definitely still room improvement but I'd return here  <EOR> My inclination recommend avoiding all costs  Draft beers including swills such Bud Light not so affectionately refer headache Tecate $8 !!! unless actually take advantage happy hour wheel offering drink specials those $3 draft free margarita entree cards not confused hooker trading cards handed sidewalks along Strip don't expect drink cheap   I can't however speak food which took pass no other reason don't think tacos should cost $12  But maybe  just me     <EOR> ok let tell story reservation 20 30h right time many open tables but still wait 15 minutes seated  finaly table give table outside restaurant side where only table which located right wall Hell NO!!  Ok back inside wait another table still many open tables available another 10 minutes booth ok fine  wait 15 minutes waiter comes tell somebody else responsible table OK more waiting!!!  Than waiter comes actually very nice order drinks food same time  all drinks quick except Margarita took another 20 minutes more waiting  waiter nerve joke ask want another only takes 20 minutes point almost ready turn into El Diablo     Overall just overpriced Mexican food  If back only drinks but Margarita  <EOR> I love place 2 reasons    4 cheese nachos 2 for 1 drink special  can't quite comment anything else because everytime same thing  did recently wings those very good  4 cheese nachos though just amazing $14 seems bit overpriced but easily share still full  Everytime am Vegas try stop just nachos!! Everything else menu very overpriced though  Stick basics here  <EOR> On last day Vegas more few hours kill before flight back home discovered place mostly due chick passing BOGO free drinks pass up?! bartender really chill totally cool group 6 coming free BOGO passes saved bit money using them bar  Happy hour actually pretty cool spinning wheel score discounted free drinks entire bar area   now  cool! <EOR> Very fresh tasty steak tacos   which bit more eat cuz bit pricey   Service good  <EOR> Ambiance little else    Food mediocre best  Going server's recommendation barbacoa tacos  Good but microscopic  already eaten 2 3 tacos before topping sides apparently supposed accompany tacos came out    Andy great energetic engaging game  Best thing place    Hostess less so  When saw Yelp could free drink coupon hostess stand talk she said Didn't already give one? She hadn't  it lot people come through doors  But free drink coupon worth risk scolding customer unwarrentedly?  There's better places there  Don't waste your vacation place  <EOR> Food expensive even good  carne asada taco dry no flavor  friend ordered drink never it  When brought food don't bring fajitas out  two other friends wait additional 10 15 minutes just food  Worst experience ever  never come again  only good thing manager helped once told horrible experience was  <EOR> My bf grab bite eat right Las Vegas   both kind disappointed because food overpriced just average   chicken tacos which definitely ate because starving though!  place reminded Border Yelper said movie Dusk til Dawn  also margarita which thought good especially because drink lot those but hefty price $13     This kind place should give free nachos salsa when but nope pay extra that   entered hotel entrance Monte Carlo almost slipped because shiny slippery floor ramp if someone drunk would definitely slip fall heels!      The waitress okay service personality asked any specials i previously saw ones advertised Monte Carlo website she told weren't any   False advertisement   place big outside rooftop but chilly day LV everyone inside   Friday 1 00pm   Sat down right away plenty open tables     If want grab quick bite eat right middle strip good that   definitely other restaurants better food quality service Las Vegas   People wrote some harsh reviews place   I really think general though all prices food LV just over priced NYC in fact maybe even more!    I would back though drinks night could different atmosphere always give places 2nd chance if wasn't horrible experience first time! <EOR> This place just fine   nachos pricey but pretty big least   service ok setting cool right strip   fine probably won't special but eat drink fine  <EOR> Good food little pricey but atmosphere pretty cool almost every time we're Vegas <EOR> Horrible horrible    our waiter friendly food way overpriced chips salsa free   rice undercooked no seasoning beans didn't touch enchiladas chicken ok but when waiter brought food fruit fly came food im guessing kitchen followed food didn't away table complained didn't pay but horrible experience sure <EOR> I love anything FREE but stds!! came Friday night around 10ish walked right top no cover then live band play couple new popular songs some classics  freaking great!! good change upscale snobby club scene Vegas offer  coming back joint!! <EOR> Where'd come from?  Reminds brothel model town Beatlejuice   tourist trap cookie cutter authentic Mexican Cantina located strip   Margarita bar slushy machines spinning some allegedly hot wings   Unfortunately dive bar  polished shoved into tourist locale  <EOR> While friends bday stopped place dinner    I enormous nachos which great! Others burritos quesdillas etc  food pretty good always pricey strip  reason why gave place 2 star service!   Horrible customer service  mean but server trashy  Why does need breast face while eating mexican food  did know strip club  don't think she even smiled once  waited forever check although friends stated clearly did want quesdilla order previously she still brought made big fuss    Oh well <EOR> $14 95 beer mid day?  Rip off even Strip standards   Many other better options pursue them  <EOR> I town convention decided stop dinner  before drinks when 21 good time then its big difference guess when actually sit down dinner opposed hanging around drinking  came sat down upstairs bar 3 female bartenders working taking thought customer but turned employee waiting shift start two other girls training other but completely ignoring talking girl stuff each other  sat patiently 5 10 minutes finally spoke asked food menu  planned ordering bowl tortilla soup platter steak tacos  made decision pretty quickly again waiting another 10 minutes someone come back take order not mention around 6pm place pretty empty  time someone came take order annoyed just ordered tortilla soup corona  looked watch see time ordered soup taken 25 minutes them bring soup which mediocre best finished beer well before even brought soup empty bottle sitting front no asking if wanted another  Needless say finished soup left  service absolutely awful soup average would never come back again recommend place  Vegas all service industry million other places strip striving business  <EOR> What originally drew fact could eat people watch strip same time  DING DING DING!  all took rope in! bucket beer mahi tacos some chips queso ourselves great time here  ended accosting some cute guys strip sharing food them ended all doing shots tequila  Definitely best dining experiences vegas as far fun goes   atmosphere laid back great  servers attentive adorable everything tasted good  definitely stop next time around!

It started 30min wait seated when told would only 15   boyfriend doing Vegas budget but still wanted hit few more interesting places strip   didn't any 5 star dining experience mind but 2 hour meal consisted flour tortilla chips bland salsa $9 drinks neither good nor bad burger?  Definitely worth it   pretty much ignored waiter head clouds took another 30min bill   only good thing going place theme even burger came own little plastic pitchfork guess even hellishly long wait anything wanted place fit theme!

The bar became ongoing joke every time Vegas nicknamed 'Feces'   I tried again year later still wreaked    The happy ending just Vegas charging $65 watch Pacman fight across road watched free Hard Rock!  Sorry cant give any more review place couldn't past smell  Feces OUT <EOR> Went boss's birthday   fun but purely company  started off bar  Bartender great attentive even though pretty busy  downhill there  waitress flat rude friendly all  She never came see were  ordered fish tacos  Fish dried almost leathery  friend  felt bad dinner sucked offered some quesadilla asked if good she said meh passed   Although say bite someone's green pork enchilada rocked  Chocolate cake came birthday boy flavorless  bit sweet tooth didn't bother second bite  place busy just because its location strip  However local going back  many great places both off strip deal crappy overpriced food even worse service  <EOR> Most expensive enchilada ever but far best great people watching location!

Also Cinco de Mayo don't say sure want margarita because mix right now   do want order something else?    Just damn margarita mix since would much ask actually real ingredients    The place looks cool but sourpuss working I'd keep walking  <EOR> A few girlfriends received $3 house margarita coupon person handing them strip   little apprehensive but opted check anyway   did lose    $3?

Lol  <EOR> Long wait rude manager party the most sweetest person group lol overpriced just great food  Serving sizes pretty decent    There many choices Vegas why here? I'd suggest not  <EOR> I dislike having bash place but place just    lacking    Lacking many departments    enjoying great day looking good place some grub    Mexican sounded phenominal     We walked in    weren't really greeted    just stood waited someone acknowledge us     A few minutes later    heyyyy    greeted escorted seats   sitting while gave some time look over menu    bunch things sounded pretty tasty      Our waitress finally came around took drink order      And   20 minutes later    served glasses water!    We finally drinks placed order food     The highlight night simply this   Chicken Tortilla Soup   bowl soup   fantastic flavor delightful really thinking great treat dinner     Until dinner     A stuffed steak burrito    Steak little flavor barely any sides rice beans    well    finished maybe half burrito    then just stopped     I done place    drink empty water empty food sub par     We bill threw some money table sure covered just walked out    dismal  <EOR> Very disappointed  come Vegas least 4 times year  always stopped because food great Margaritas good   This weekend came Diablos even knowing would fight traffic new TMobil Stadium  Garth Brooks town    The menu changed page lack better terms microwaveable food  Chicken Fajitas tasteless guacamole just smashed avocados  worse all pitcher Sour no tequila margaritas $45   We disappointed  favorite places Vegas ruined  <EOR> It third day Vegas on family vacation still hadn't gotten around having drink  large part cause trying spend time parents big drinkers part because still feel little weird going into place sitting down bar alone especially when filled old men which seemed common    I ended coming into Diablo's sitting down bar ordering strawberry daiquiri  little sad see came plastic cup wasn't delicious before but     booze staff great  considering ordering another but     call leave  left happy  <EOR> We walked told going 25 minute wait bar asked cup ice water which bartender nicely gave then filled 3 more times before seated  NICE     We table window people watching pretty cool wait waited food  Its loud though times barely could hear each other  But its Vegas expect that   Chips Salsa start $4  Really?!? Kinda funny  Drinks decent fresh raspberrys won't lie nice fresh  ordered Steak Tacos $17 bucks but least give all fixing side    All all decent lunch little over priced but service food good  <EOR> Diablos  Oh man  wheel though!    I arrived Friday night just time happy hour 4pm   didn't really know getting myself into other decent drink special  course upon arrival wheel $5 patron shots  Okay!  work wives decided just needed loosen post conference  Apparently happy hour wheel gets spun every 30 minutes each time highlighting different drink special  began   $5 patron shots quickly followed $6 margaritas $3 fireball shots $4 domestic beers    eventually lost count cannot remember rest happy hour specials indulged in  Ouch!   One thing remember nachos!  Those HUGE amazing!  same price choose chicken steak combo both  Lots tasty meat fresh guac sour cream pico olives jalapeños house HOT sauce!  Yumm  Between 4 gals didn't even through gargantuan!    Anyway if find yourself strip search cheap happy hour really fun atmosphere wander into diablos sit bar wait wheel spin order some nachos won't disappointed    Pro tip check yelp see hostess your 2 1 tap beer wells drink add just another layer diablos deal! <EOR> I'll honest am sure am very knowledgeable type Mexican food serve Diablo's   Baja style?  dunno definitely wasn't Mexican definitely wasn't Tex Mex   But alright nonetheless   First off love offer pitchers all margaritas specialty drinks   Pitchers running $30 $40 but pitcher made some fancy tequila $270   PITCHER   FUCK!  pitcher agave margarita which $270 one pretty decent sweet glasses rimmed salt also chili pepper flakes   Spicy!  server informed more liquor would equivalent amount margaritas ordered separately less money   guess without saying server awesome!  also noted could try tequila flights if really ready party   Chips salsa did come meal extra   chips pretty decent thin thick   Three salsas came tomatillo I think couple very roasted smoky flavor   None spicy tend salsa but feeling really wasn't supposed spicy   way decent   I fish tacos came cabbage pico baja type sauce them   skeptical white creamy looking sauce but wasn't bad added liberal dose hot sauce   ok   also choices burritos fajitas taquitos then also BBQ pork burgers etc?  Very random menu   guess please everyone when serving masses   The price well Vegas pay even average food   already know though aren't shocked   Stick appetizer menu if want save $$   just drink your dinner  <EOR> Went Sunday night girlfriend awesome time  food super tasty HUGE!! Combo Nachos bomb side jalapeños salsa Started off michelada server John's recommendation which really good tequila list biggest but very good    Cliche know but churro must have   sure perfect place watch football  <EOR> NO!  DO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES zer0 stars place reinforces simulacrum las vegas does mexican food vegas strip does reality presents fabricated approximation should actually be       by far worst Mexican food ever definitely most expensive  even margarita terrible   mainly shocked appalled veggie burrito   menu described including black beans rice corn cheese peppers   sounded pretty good    but when showed black beans side cheese top   hungry hangry irritated this   its whoever designed burrito never actually ate authentic mexican food which given context would surprise slightest  <EOR> My family coming years until today  giant nachos we're cold disappointing  know billion times better much meat cheese can't finish them! However time no meat no cheese soggy cold  asked manager new ones take look happened  manager didn't seem care kind okay whatever new food  He never apologized food  love place but sucks say never coming back  <EOR> This first stop checking into hotel landing  starved Mexican food sounded great   The music loud even tho wife only 1 foot apart could still barely hear each other   The server really good over menu us  pitcher mangoritas stellar both quesadillas  Those yummy too  bill over $100  know Vegas but still sticker shock lunch cheesy Mexican restaurant  <EOR> We staying Monte Carlo place very convenient starving selves enjoy dinner   Just short walk through hotel ta da being sat table   issue visit sat right next loud group bar mostly empty restaurant plenty open tables   realize Vegas upset group bar looked really enjoying time   other end food ok but waitress sweet nice   wish could remember name but she took very good care us  <EOR> Don't waste your time money here  30 dollars Chupacabra margarita rocks  Both highly disappointing  expected more Chupacabra especially since featured tv upstairs hotel room  took margarita back upgraded Cadillac  Better but still great  Another member group ordered blended margarita equally disappointed  Food disappointing pay chips salsa  Employees nice but try elsewhere your money  <EOR> Attached Monte Carlo place awesome drinks amazing fajitas! Stopped happy hour endless walking shopping left very satisfied! staff super friendly atmosphere good vibe! <EOR> My mom staying Monte Carlo hotel Diablo's closest restaurant they're located strip but access through Monte Carlo also     We during afternoon time Thursday or maybe Friday seated immediately  wasn't busy  However let note though did pass during night time extremely long line trying in  different events going night would assume  why    During happy hour times someone spin wheel reveal special be  surprise bartender chose up  stood counter top spun wheel! fun   We food delicious! Good sized portions  both tacos  Very friendly atmosphere  real authentic Mexican food in opinion but bad if you're lookin type food Las Vegas area  <EOR> Good chili relleno really good! best side boarder    Bad chips salsa wasn't free  <EOR> Took friends town happy hour  Cadillac margarita pitcher amazing! Decide invited rest family come dinner grilled fish tacos perfect  Can't wait back! <EOR> I visited Saturday night very unimpressed overall   First all loud DJ started getting ready Latin dance night could literally hear speakers blowing could hear person next you   Second waitress very unenthusiastic if rude   frozen margarita high sugar low tequila   expected better paid   tried Yelp check in free drink BUT hostess sent bartender sent waitress sent back hostess would honor coupon   Last but least felt very rude but fitting interrupted middle regrettable meal entire table's IDs checked two pairs security  place turning into club but seems could done more efficiently when walk door order table full drinks   Food okay   steak nachos which bad but nothing special   Chips salsa complimentary which disappointing   positive people looking Latin dance night   Music good although loud scenery nice   worth try but expected much more paid  <EOR> If you're looking real Mexican food place  food didn't taste inedible just wasn't true traditional Latin flavors   at all  rice green red enchilada sauce tastes mixture ketchup bbq sauce peppers Veggie Burrito undercooked  wouldn't even classify burrito more wrap  Everything incredibly underwhelming  would literally choose Taco Bell over place knowing know now   that's sad   We served Jose  charged items he offered refills without informing additional charge   When brought attention he combative defensive claiming he's never heard custimer complain  reaction unprofessional should gotten manager if he felt uncomfortable discussing check     I strongly advise don't waste your time  spent $106 2 burritos 3 tacos elote chips guac coke  much better experience better food nearby buffets   or Taco Bell  <EOR> Just happened walk into place amazing Saturday night  DJ awesome drinks well poured  Came back Sunday night even though more chill environment great time  Tony Seth bartenders awesome company  Would definitely visit place again when come back Vegas  <EOR> Years ago    Wheel full great specials now     nothing excited over  usually still stop few rounds appetizer  Service always good appetizers decent bar food  Chicken Nachos favorite  enough 3 4 people share  Prices little high receive but hey Vegas strip  <EOR> Th food mediocre  bad but nothing fantastic  gave everyone wrong food table some swapping  server friendly  <EOR> Surprisingly good! given BOGO drink coupon street stopped bar take break expecting tourist trap  Margarita's large good also taquitos really good well <EOR> casual  loud  ghetto  creeps cheap half naked Butter faces everything good but face!!     ew never again  <EOR> This review night life experience only Continuing bachelorette conquest literally stumbled upon place wee hours morning  sweet no cover ladies locals which entire group free  entered super hot lingerie wearing bartenders dancing swinging top bar  bartenders immediately grabbed group tilted heads back then began pour shots mouths  kind service immediately tipped her  crowd ranged people 20's 30's  totally feeling music because good selection EDM hip hop  Great being girls Vegas because whole night's worth drinks paid you  Overall great atmosphere good company epic times  <EOR> Had late lunch today steak nachos delicious  niece shared them barely put dent them  Service sucked   but I'd back nachos  <EOR> We came party 3 around 1030 pm  hostess friendly  she barely acknowledged us  Once sat waited 10 minutes server never came  walked out  Disappointed  <EOR> Talk branding!   Even if short term memory loss you'd know place called Diablo's because everything says it   This great mexican restaurant white folk can't stand heat  must look hard jalapenos no bite poppers  salsa? tastes great but gets bland bit since there's no heat it    I ordered pulled chicken burrito which very good but start half way where gets really good  Again bland though asked hot sauce started liberally pouring it  downside really really flavors mexican food hot sauce just covers flavor want spice cooked dernit!  As always Las Vegas staff showing fair amount skin which slightly compensates food no spice  <EOR> Ordered guacamole chips + salsa   Chicken fajita lettuce wrap which healthy drinks   hips freshly made claimed but tasted little stale however fajita light tasty   service ok considering Monday evening   if around    <EOR> They did really great job making cheap hastily thrown together food become very expensive  example is$17 street tacos below average even chain restaurants    There many other restaurants immediate area provide better food better service better experience much less money <EOR> So maybe its because live Texas but place just doesn't work me  mixed drinks pathetically weak if you're going margarita right  queso chorizo almost unbearably salty  Chorizo already salty people don't add extra! spinning happy hour wheel good idea but prices high  Happy hour should cheaper norm exactly same $3 XX nothing new maybe Vegas thats bargain The bathroom attendants?! Why? place? whole damn pharmacy laid counter    Anyway impressed crazy expensive weak drinks small salty queso $9 piece margarita $12 queso but atmosphere decent let slide 2 stars <EOR> Would 5 but damn door being open DECEMBER made everything cold er 2 minutes hit table  order rocks but frozen due them leaving door open  some common sense management  Other back summer try again <EOR> While walking down Strip around 1am alcohol fueled Sunday Monday felt music bumping hips started moving along made way into Diablos Cantina    given buy free drink coupon door headed stairs bar top restaurant   think took advantage seeing doubles charged full price both beers however didn't care long nobody cut off kept serving me    2 beers made way stool side bar watched band  place all latin flavor pretty damn packed sunday  loved band very energetic music upbeat hard keep hips moving around truth is    hips don't lie ahhhh see did there      hung another 30 min decided keep walking gotta say though sunday regret leaving there  really only spot hopping  time made way back bar around 3am music still goin but body saying its food bed time    Some best latin music friendly vibes bar strip  <EOR> I stopped into Diablos dinner last week cant remember having better server restaurant   sat right front La Vegas Boulevard enjoyed people watching throughout meal  am almost positive servers name Katie  She friendly right point everything   impressed she wasn't using pen paper write any order down she didn't skip beat   would recommend guacamole nachos!  But bring some friends share because nachos huge! <EOR> We presently surprised  atmosphere great adults leave kidos home  Food excellent portions huge! Small tip share appetizers entrees just split entree  Wait staff awesome constantly making sure everything good but point where annoying  defiantly back soon! <EOR> Well don't know everyone else but love place   friends came twice during weekend getaway Vegas MDW blast both times   staff super friendly food good   didn't big meals but appetizers great food came relatively quick   pitcher Sinful Vixen which made stoli raspberry cassis muddled fresh raspberries lemon sour well just die for   came back next day all drink draft beer live rock band   awesome definitely stop next time Sin City! DIABLO    lol <EOR> I'm giving three stars because nachos overpriced  20 bucks much  Now should listened server when she said feed 4  really feeds 4! should ordered two    Drinks good  Mine needed little more Stoli    It's less crowded lunch 7 when folks looking drink party!  Cool spot overall  <EOR> El Diablo El Nutso busy!  Right middle strip tourist trap kickin'   Just watch NFL game cool place parked far Monte Carlo valet walked over   If didn't when opened don't think would able sit down   place really filled crazy   menu small limited but drinks aplenty   I ordered steak nachos huge but expensive $18    male bartender great really responsive even though busy super deluxe beautiful waitresses nice friendly think those sexy girls Tarantino's Dusk Till Dawn but hotties clothed which always welcomed distraction watching Rams game even if they've playing better late    The place really cool   night didn't back inside but walked hell like flames looks fun even more overflowing El Nutso  <EOR> Scott great bought dad shot bday  Ladonna attentive delight  Another great patio great music vibe overall great experience  even better hotel wasn't long hike  <EOR> i came friday night mediocre experience LAX  line kind irritated because took long over but girl door immediately approached friend let free   score!   i found boyfriend rest drunk crew pleased find dance floor enough space move around  DJ pretty good unfortunately didn't buy any drinks because broke flight leaving few hours absolutely could miss  did however shot poured down throat hot gogo dancer!   let's talk this  dancer thus watch gogo dancers  girls actually hot [seeing ones SF are     most time  haha] all own style dancing but bottom line they're workin' environment fun  <EOR> Food ok bad but amazing  Enchiladas dry  Portions small price  Salsa ok  Kinda bland  <EOR> Tried when first opened drinks ok nachos good   Personally am huge fan frozen drinks strip suspect more sugar alcohol   Great people watching venue tho! <EOR> 2 Stars meh experienced better   Located right Vegas Strip Monte Carlo! A+ location but thats it  marinated steak came small portion mexican rice black beans flour tortillas  expecting soft juicy steak but instead received tough chewy piece steak  wasn't impressed dish but Diablo Wings much better  definitely spicy side  am stranger spicy food but definitely hot firey side hence name restaurant diablo     On bright side things highlight Mexican corn $5   boyfriend ordered extra to go  Would come back? Unfortunately no  Price point pretty high well mediocre chain Mexican food   In short if big fan Mexican corn elote then place Skip steak  Order diablo wings if your'e challenge  If finish 20 diablo wings you'll Wall Fame if then Wall Shame  <EOR> Well first time Vegas    having many drinks suite friend stumbled down strip essentially closest busy place near hotel 10pm  We love Mexican thought why hell not?    Service alright but wasn't really busy    both Pacifico entree reasonably priced considering everyone talked said Vegas wayyy overpriced    I steak burrito although steak overcooked doused enough sauce enjoyable    The location pretty cool people watch table Vegas must do  <EOR> Wow wish would looked reviews before coming  others said service TERRIBLE  sat down few other people took waitress 45 minutes before she even came ask drinks food  waited line thirty minutes  parched  Everyone around getting food drinks even people came way us    Anyways told 3 different people would notify waitress would order  She still didn't show till 45 minutes sitting there  Then worker guy came said condescending tone like bothering order food drinks bar  KIDDING me? reason table watch UFC fight which TV walk across room miss half fight because waitress sucks order bar   Anyways finally she came she gave attitude she super busy many tables when some first people sit down  She barely refilled drinks checked that   The cherry top she gave bills 18% gratuity automatically included party 3   basically she allowed give crappy service 18% tip no matter what    The food decent but overpriced it's Vegas though   3 5 stars  <EOR> We Sunday football watch game seeing them advertise show all games  would experience again    Food good ordered nachos quesadillas share each other  Nachos would enough! Drinks food expensive though filled can't say 100% worth it  <EOR> We just stopped Diablo's enjoy couple margaritas hot hot day  margaritas good sized but found them mediocre frozen mango margarita overly sweet  husbands agave margarita sweet but still just ok  <EOR> Cool atmosphere! Great 2 1 happy hour  second floor place be  drinks good heavy pours live band doing good background but staff try more attentive smily  views second floor rad  <EOR> Just stopping through found place  Gilbert made best drinks! He super friendly  come back next time visit vegas! <EOR> My review based service food   We walk three ladies front none them bothered look greet when walked in   even said hi no looked up   stood another minute finally girl asked many party   should red flag because first impressions business right impression    We sit down server comes table   She looks she damn attitude she work   Whatever problem just hungry   order drinks then food  really hungry wondering if chips salsa complimentary  NOPE! wanted $12 simple ass chips salsa   Instead being nice server acted couldn't afford just said forget whatever   food comes mine fine   friend asked side salsa she said extra because already bowl salsa cousin ordered she said no point ordering any salsa   sorry didn't come restaurant food advice came eat   finish she comes sets bill CHIPS ORDERED  REALLY????? disgusting that?! girl worst attitude noticeable   coulda because different race because noticed she nicer table next Caucasian descent   Don't noticeable you're complete racist unhappy service people  We let manager know afterwards service he extremely apologetic wished told sooner but matter being able pay food she thought couldn't afford   probably never going come back service  <EOR> One pricier spots strip  But really nice inside staff great  Well drinks run $10  <EOR> Wer Lust auf mexikanisches Essen durchschnittlicher Güte hat wird hier fündig  Wir waren zu einem Gruppenanlass hier und hatten zwei Hauptgänge zur Auswahl ich habe mich für den Steak Burrito entschieden  Dieser hatte für meinen Geschmack allerdings etwas gar viel Käse und stiess mir wohl deshalb die ganze Nacht irgendwie immer wieder auf  Der Service war gut aber für meinen Gusto war's hier auch einfach zu laut  Mit dem Gegenüber konnte man nur mit viel Geschrei kommunizieren  War aber ja eigentlich nicht anders zu erwarten am Las Vegas Boulevard <EOR> Diablos atmosphere fun! eaten couple times! Food good! Drinks good! Definitely must try! <EOR> we didn't eat any food but drinks great  start handing wristbands but saying discount cover $10 1 drink free  ambiance so  much hip hop playing taste  <EOR> Horrible customer service food ok  Lemonade disgusting enjoyed atmosphere ambiance  definitely back  Room improvement  waiter Jose  <EOR> I working event Vegas staying Monte Carlo needed food late night still open  looked decent thought would try out    I fajitas pretty good but definitely worth price paid    I understand why cost much since right strip but would expect more bang your buck if paying around $30 tax tip  <EOR>
