Sorry say came empty handed Quick background LOVE Thai food   eaten Thai food all across town when find nicely reviewed something recommended put test   LOVE spicy   I ask Thai spicy  phet phet very hot   10 10   even reconfirm actually want hot tell them love spicy Thai   also usually order dishes Thai name server should know mean business!  With being said Pad Ka Pao spicy mint chicken hot all   wasn't even slightly hot    I don't think even sniffle outta me   am also used them mincing meat but large chunks chicken one only places town meat doesn't absorb much sauce heat   But still 10 10 no where near number 3 5 more authentic places town   Also portion size small   I served lunch special size would expect other restaurants but full dinner price off dinner menu   Ordered Pad Kee Mao had request spicy baby good lot better pad ka pao    Only weird thing put bean sprouts it!  bean sprouts   but thai rice noodles   consistency thing here   weird biting into them hidden inside soft yummy noodles   Still bad dish though but never way before but won't let affect review   And small vent paying rice per person   all expect all know why more money obviously but wish threw scoop side dishes need it   won't ding them since everyone does just kind annoying  all   Other food prices little cheaper most but portion size smaller you pay for location hole wall insides nice homey but very small here   maybe enough 20 people tops   Service good actual high chairs babies instead your traditional wood plank ones   There many better Thai food restaurants town   Just drive little more central town  <EOR> 4 stars place? kidding? place bad  super small poor service food isn't anything special all  better pad thai side road Bangkok   place doesn't even compare Archi's   If really Thai food then don't waste your time eating place because won't come back  <EOR> Looking yelp seen peoples rate places believe 4 star  Guess don't trust rate   First time last time   If could rate place rate no star all  Order all dish supposed good awful  can't believe first time said awful THAI food   recommend anyone come here  Thumbs down  many Thai restaurant far worst place   Sorry but whoever rate place no taste all   Believe  taste Thai food  waitress nice but food   suggest need real Thai chief really cook   way order all dish very spicy 1 10 order 10 guess came even spicy all   thought thai dish supposed very spicy when u ask them   All dish order don't even chills dish  But really don't recommend anyone come   Really food just simple nasty no tasty all   People wanted eat real Thai food really know cook real Thai mean really know cook   <EOR> Great little gem strip mall never disappoints  Each meal lunch comes delicious bowl soup service very nice professional  Little place recommended groups over 4  <EOR> My simple advice best time visit Prommares when party 5 more because  40 rice while unexpected terrible but when pay $2 00 white rice might peeved  Now think don't think ever ordered curry dish served some portion rice  eats curry without rice? However last night paid $2 white rice wasn't even brown  hub ordered Pad Thai he didn't need extra crab accompaniment  result $7 change curry effectively $9 change   Sadly prevent returning know hop Thai Noodle delicious brown rice free some superb curry  Rice charges pet peeve  sad because Prommares does pretty tasty Thai  little hesitant first because dish entitled Baby Corn menu  never restaurant bold enough dedicate entire dish mini ears  proceeded caution making sure order vegetable curry without baby corn  yellow curry dish balance savory sweet great  little thin side preference but vegetables which ranged Chinese broccoli American stuff fresh generous  Then again didn't love super firm tofu served   The interior character including bathroom painted resemble French garden  Plus crooks crannies clean  Service friendly enough despite delivery $2 rice pot  Man can't over that  guess could also visit  if you're craving noodles  occasion don't need rice     Ultimately am torn between 2 3 stars  think better more reasonable Thai choices town but generous three  Consider bonus star cleanliness creative bathroom  <EOR> Best authentic thai restaurant LV  spice level perfect  ingredients super fresh service great great atmosphere prices cheap!
