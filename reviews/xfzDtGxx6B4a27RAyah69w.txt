Fast fresh   Definitely recommend restaurant  only 5 minutes west Strip if you're town visiting quick cab drive over  <EOR> This place AMAZING! may even new favourite terms AYCE West Side I live Green Valley area because quality phenomenal without overdoing rice side   I always started seaweed salad edamame  salad small side terms portion but very sweet delectable flavour did compensate  leaves room much more anyway! edamame came steaming which great because nothing worse cold edamame tends drop temperature rapidly anyway   Their menu very unique items compared most AYCE places  tried Screaming O Salad which three pieces seared tuna sauce slathered over cabbage lettuce  first expected taste bland due lack colour but actually very similar sauce compared Ohjah's which more expensive la carte bistro Summerlin only point reference really  very close quite enjoyable trying something new   Their nigiri just comparable quality favourite Henderson spot Sushiwa  fish itself little smaller but least coupled snowball rice leaving order more  salmon tuna both moist flavour enjoyed Pepper Seared Super White both hit va va voom melting effect   BUT if want melting then WANT ordered baked rolls  suggest half roll don't wheeled joint works if you're sharing try more  two rolls blew mind Baked Salmon Baked Lobster  Absolutely delectable especially Lobster me    At point if you're still open another order before getting dessert suggest another half roll something fresh Philadelphia per friend's suggestion perhaps another simple roll    Despite bikini season approaching quite quickly knew needed experience Deep Fried Oreo  first I'd seen desserts section AYCE before came beautiful dollop whipped cream rainbow sprinkles deep fried chocolate  waistline happy only size 2 oreo cookies but stomach little sad more because rich chocolate complemented entire meal  Don't expect creamy cookie though no complaint because slight allergic reaction anything thick frosty hitting throat no innuendo pun intended    WILL DEFINITELY AGAIN! <EOR> Love place!

If  weren't e coli infested beef tips drenched soggy rolls mediocre tempura ice cream southwestern over kill onions top sushi imitation ramen I'd given whole wall higher rating! <EOR> Mmm sushi  favorite thing eat  past weekend introduced friend co worker world sushi she already hooked    decided some take out Sushi 21 lunch   Since friend still new world sushi decided stick rolls mainly ones she tried already  called ordered Philly roll Spicy Tuna roll Las Vegas roll  told would ready 10 15 minutes    The rolls weren't ready when arrived waited good 5 10 minutes them  Service friendly though rolls fairly inexpensive total $22 change   The rolls tasty although Philly little loose kept falling apart us     Generous amount tuna Spicy Tuna roll appreciated gave eel sauce side Las Vegas roll    Was best sushi ever?
