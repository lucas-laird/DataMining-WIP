Zabas fast food joint leaning towards more American Mexican food  am never disappointed when because quick making your food more variety choose from  instance tacos just chicken steak but shrimp fish  only but into Zaba bowl  Zaba bowl your choice meat white brown rice beans pinto black salsa mild medium hot sour cream cheese lettuce  Sounds lot bowl Chipotle which yes very similar but Zaba's more choose which plus   The prices cheap ranging $1 something $7 something   I highly recommend bowls fish tacos nachos  Might add nachos white cheese sauce really different any queso tried your choice meat  <EOR> Was really good  Prefer spot over Chipotle  Staff really nice really crammed much into burrito  <EOR> Love place   fresh food kids eat free Sunday its local! <EOR> Zaba's awesome    love huge burritos those fish tacos yummy !!! children loves quesadillas black bean burritos     little pricey though Sundays where kiddos eat free    Oh yeah!!! Also Gary Waddell news 8 think lol fan well   seen eating here    Cool   <EOR> Love Zabas  But why keep closing locations? Don't bother going one  closed  <EOR> If taco salads place  Wicked good taco shell salads   fresh good  Pretty good variety ingredients tasty  Plus serve beer  Definitely attempting authentic Mexican if  want somewhere else  But they're really good specialize in  Also lots options being gf vegan all vegetable burrito add potatoes even sweet potatoes  also option fish tacos fish burrito which great  usually chipotle but great second option esp if your looking fish potato tacos   Atmosphere relaxing clean place decorated brightly   I've never bad experience here  knock wood <EOR> The food tasty but pricey huge portions  Service just okay even though no other customers despite fact did state first visit girl helping seemed annoyed think millisecond wanted  <EOR> This place should called Zabas Mexican't Grill   just paid $20 three flavorless tacos some gross nachos   whole time making food hoping would some magic taste because looked really sad   think ate 10% nachos before give up   gave son wrong kind tacos  He ate 50% food before giving up  won't back  <EOR> In style Chipotle's Cafe Rio but think preferred Zaba's smidge  burrito whole wheat tortilla which much better expected  usual ratio fillings wish all places heavier meat but guess  way goes  also very messy which why guess people order bowl instead! Very tasty overall would liked hot sauce actually hot! <EOR> I am big fan Zaba's  especially quesadillas  love comes huge cup guacamole  say location E  Flamingo better though  some reason location tends smell sewer  <EOR> Everything fresh! lettuce shredded does come bag   love all choices     The staff very friendly Zaba's clean   Support local business! <EOR> Great flavors fresh food!  Better all other same concept restaurants  <EOR> Not best chipotle definitely much better  Compared chipotle quantity less salsas taste rather bland seriously load lettuce   Every Time    I used place high school 4 years ago   But gets worse worse each time back like 3 times since hs   <EOR> So stingy portioned bland tasting $12 burrito mind first LAST experience Zaba's   wouldn't call customer service bad but very impersonal   also repeat myself several times burrito somewhat similar attempting order aloof employee   cool   glad everyone else likes but guess strolled into Zaba's wrong day  <EOR> I stumbled across joint day while looking something different eat  lunch break   service mediocre prices steep but food good  service bad but staff seem dull unexcited blame them  last trip feel took sweet time assisting customers though  think prices little steep but lot food   only ever ordered salad but feeds twice  salad because still everything burrito offers minus tortilla  dont come lot because price but when food always good  <EOR> I love place  know order else seems nickel dimed extras  eaten many four times week  Four! highly recommend shredded beef salad hot salsa fajita vegetables guacamole  paleo friendly delicious   raised prices few months ago but still great meal reasonable price  don't tortillas Cafe Rio but don't eat tortillas anyway  don't care chicken all because includes leg thigh meat prefer white meat only  little thing but just can't stand it   days am going coaster sized double chocolate brownies  <EOR> The steak juicy butI honestly prefer strips steak fill taco   few years but place still fresh delicious! <EOR> Was going afternoon study session Starbucks next door stopped joint lunch   If close your eyes walk door couldn't tell if you're Zaba's Chipotle Q'doba   hell chains doing?
