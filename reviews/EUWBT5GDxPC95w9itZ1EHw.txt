Really? WTF? <EOR> We nine adults six kids 10 under   actually planning Spice Market Friday Thanksgiving but charging $35 pp decided come since love crab legs   price seafood buffet well worth just crab legs alone!  didn't disappoint!  Being petite person smallish appetite still three times just crab legs    warm easy open tasty drawn butter!  did try couple other items which didn't really leave impression because crab legs crack me     Oh since enjoy clams few them well   Yuck!  tasted lemon gross    I did manage some dessert   only soft serve swirl hot fudge nuts   Yum!

Service excellent <EOR> I've over dozen times over years lunch dinner just realized never put review place!  Probably because distracted beer over Triple 7 next door   Garden Court Buffet located Main Street Station Casino Downtown LV   many Yelpers say probably best Downtown offer far buffets   Case point Hawaiian food offerings!  I'll start off best   Being Hawaii often miss simple Hawaiian dishes   Would kill buffets cook white Calrose rice properly??  None Uncle Ben's long grain rice pilaf junk   Sticky   white   rice!  Buffets would killing if just made white rice sauted SPAM scrambled eggs laid big bottle furikake   Feed dozens people little off your bottom line!  Garden Court Buffet little corner section far side buffet hides Hawaiian goodies   basic terms Hawaiian cuisine always made way locals would but very least there   many days buffet you'll see Sticky white rice Kalua pig cabbage Oxtail stew mainly dinner but YES! As soon pay off little corner treasured eats!  days lucky treated oxtail stew   OMG   OMG!  favorite comfort eats all time!  see sucking cartilage divine oxtail?

Yes just wasted entire paragraph oxtail stew   But no other buffet Las Vegas right now   Garden Court Buffet does other sections course gluttony Asian Mexican Italian American Salad Bar very meh Dessert  They also theme nights all you can eat prime rib seafood but really only pay attention areas when no oxtail stew   when no oxtail stew grumpy boy!  Really because majority other food just OK   bad but nothing write Bon Appetit about   average find your local Station Casinos buffet     I into oxtail totally forgot take picture anything review   Sorry!

Seriously if 50 years older no shame I'd probably stash some purse later    Overall your standard casino buffet  cater bit Hawaiian clientele you'll find few Hawaiian dishes  wouldn't way come but good option if you're looking buffet downtown  <EOR> Though place bit away main Vegas strip area if you're looking decent buffet without crazy long line you'll typically run into main casinos then worth visit!  Food isn't best but $14 99 during dinner time shabby  best thing probably prime rib ask thick rare slice don't forget horseradish way! Service little slow drinks table cleaning but hey $14 99!   Don't expect top notch food desserts! But if you're starving craving AYCE without typical 1 hour more wait elsewhere spot hit up  <EOR> this place would 4 stars except Salad Bar Nazi sister encountered   anyway sister salad bar she overheard Salad Bar Nazi complaining in front everyone having clean everyone dropped stuff little salad bar bowls   helped   whatever   anyway actual waitress super cool attentive   right when opened 11am lunch   always stay Suncoast which another Boyd property buffet almost identical food scope   hubby sis insisted buffet better Suncoast's buffet but life could tell difference   same food quality   anyway place easy eyes   cool interior very light bright fun   would once    just check out   free parking garage next door  <EOR> Price good Clean efficient Comfortable seating Food variety good Food tasty Deserts good Service great! <EOR> Okay guess take into consideration only 4pm busy but hungry still dissatisfied  seafood carving station items left long over cooked heating lamp  oysters looked diseased felt uncomfortable even having one  drinks filled brim spilled over which says server trying minimize traveling despite being busy  Disappointed really thought saving grace buffets downtown LV  <EOR> I preface noting only $10 lunch Garden Court Buffet tempting  Selection food decent although nothing indulgent any standard  decided start Vegas dinning experience namely because first stop area downtown Vegas  ambience spacious relaxed  server very nice  Dishes served include many daily favorites fried chicken pizza etc  Again don't expect wowed dishes struggle pronounce correctly ie  cerviche just your everyday average Joe favorites  <EOR> I'm buffet girl yet always let friends drag one   Came some hungry boys Tuesday night bbq night  wished wasn't bbq night because charge  tried dollar off signing players club but line damn long  Old people take long time old person working also took long time  decided just forgo discount    supposedly best buffet downtown vegas  bbq night 2 types ribs two types wings prime rib  sure if  bbq items but worth me  ribs dry side wings weirdly favored   honey Dijon but just tasted sour  prime rib good  only well done but still juicy tender  Other think liked egg rolls Talipia corn sweet potato    think  it  salmon very dry    spit broccoli cause pure butter    wasn't impressed other items    For dessert mainly cake pie  No fancy macaroons chocolate covered strawberries  banana cream pie good snagged last one  don't think ever come again hope strong willed enough let people convince otherwise  <EOR> Very nice setting good selection even regular buffet nights   Always some sort carved beef usually brisket but Prime Rib Fridays smoked sausage small Hawaii Local Chinese sections pizza really good when fresh Mexican section fried chicken other rotating items along huge dessert selection including sugar free items small salad bar   Discount buffet when showing free player's club card   Big 40% discount when using points pay your meal  <EOR> My family lunch Thursday  less $10 person buffet steal  sure try brisket!

Just short walk Fremont Street Experience  <EOR> One favorite buffet places eat breakfast            Garden Court Buffet Mainstreet Hotel offers  ton items!  It's hard describe but place probably everything under sun you're looking for!  For eat breakfast Chicken Fried Steak! meaty breaded fried meat patty which add white mushroom gravy throw into biscuit!  Yeah maybe little unhealthy            but long don't eat everyday           it's all moderation right? Add little scrambled egg cut fried potatoes good go!  This buffet big offer basic breakfast meats bacon ham sausages egg Portuguese sausages   There also many types fruit if you're looking something healthy           and offer oatmeal waffles pastries too     Too many items eat sitting must say but least try little time when place          Breakfast very inexpensive           even cheaper if Boyd Beconnected Card     Service pretty good          no bad considering waiter waitress also bus own tables besides serving drinks  <EOR> Main Street Station architectural beauty inside out     The setting Garden Court Sunday Brunch elegant Buffet selection very good   Mimosa Server really busy but she caught while     The Omelet Chef Master!

Servers fast always toes    food awesomely cooked never felt empty!! <EOR> I've only Saturday Sunday buffets   I think reason why place popular because few buffets kalua pork sticky rice if you're lucky some Portuguese sausage  don't think eat though but local friends Hawaii all love going here  Plus can't value simple may sound favorite item country fried steak bacon  popped country fried steak cherry location damn good but also don't know any better    Unlimited mimosas  orange juice without aka straight champagne  huge morning drinker didn't capitalize deal    A good place stop if you're mood some greasy food next morning  Lots Chinese food options well Mexican American foods  <EOR> I used love place    But don't know now   some really bad dessert   just disappointing don't know if back   Sam Boyd's resorts known food   It used sweet spot but buffets Strip improved off Strip places lowered prices raised quality   Great decor probably best buffet still Downtown  <EOR> Pretty good place being near Fremont Street  Old Vegas Food decent better paradise buffet Fremont Street  sure  Then again when Paradise breakfast time  When buffet dinner time  Very good prices though very nice decorations  Coming once worth it  Remember don't paradise buffet down street if you're part neighborhood  much better  <EOR> I ate two separate trips last year year both times food very high quality especially such low price   Both times eaten lunch both times everything very fresh everything ate tasted good though some dietary restrictions could eat desserts cannot vouch those   Probably favorite thing beet salad really good love beets could honestly eat 3 plates alone   cannot Caesar dressing but fresh homemade husband said hands down best he ever saying  lot he eats every Caesar salad he can!

<EOR> Best buffet Vegas   Carving station prime rib delicious all food set high bar local refer everyone here    way better then $20 plate golden nugget  <EOR> I ate main street station casino while back dinner deserts just OK standard buffet stuff ribs decent brisket good BBQ sauce salad bar little above average pink lemonade yummy sweet sour chicken slightly above average yams yummy chili sucked 2 different pork dishes weren't good green beans artichoke salad yummy  all remember did pizza didn't any didn't look good  <EOR> For price 8 dollars per person easily best value your money if you're looking meal Vegas   While place may strip free convenient parking  actual buffet area pretty look reminds lobby Venetian Hotel   great variety foods most high quality     Don't expect high end foods lobster crab   Expect good comfort food fried chicken corn cobb great fried rice good eggrolls etc   definitely feel full your money's worth   waitresses friendly food fresh   definite winner when tired paying 100 dollars steak escargot strip  <EOR> It's fancy probably the best buffet Vegas but price fit bill  think paid $12 99 each dinner  kind late 8 00 p m  but food plentiful fresh  dying just big salad wish along some excellent red snapper  Dessert fairly typical along soft serve ice cream    You pay more upscale places Strip more interesting food but just good meal highly recommend Garden Court  <EOR> Always bring family because crab legs  Flavorful salty soggy  Great price opposed paying market value seafood restaurants  other food extraordinary but quality better some other buffets valley  Sometimes missing buffet staples pulled pork mac cheese but understand change food time time   There always line when come but wait times long  Recommend getting players card if you're local visit often discounts   Service table for drinks other dining items down  Sometimes don't visit table very often  However once ask them something usually come right away  <EOR> Ok travel vegas favorite places stop only come 4 two items ox  tail soup fresh pasta shrimp Italian sausage   herb Italian sauce delicious  both  price 13 dollars wow u can't price       its buffet but just 2 item plus dessert course   sent friends always thank  best  place  quality  price <EOR> This real value $8   most items want breakfast more including some Mexican Asian fare   Unlike many buffets visited server vey timely removing used plates serving beverages   long time since back  <EOR> After year Vegas finally tried famous Vegas champagne brunch buffet spending 2 hours gym course lol amazing  place big variety breakfast not only food  Everything very tasty still eat healthy if want to  brisket wonderful  service very fast friendly  place nicely decorated slightly looks train station 19th century  If wasn't table little Mexican kids yelling screaming all over place without parents stuff saying something them would amazing experience  5 stars! <EOR> When come Garden Court Buffet you're getting Wicked Spoon Bacchanal you're getting pay for  case paid $8 breakfast would $9 without players card expectations particularly high   While staff encountered friendly enough unfortunately underwhelmed actual food    The biggest disappointment Portuguese Sausage  eyes brightened when saw fond memories being introduced style Stardust RIP back 2006 since found Vegas anywhere else  However unlike initial starlit experience Garden Court's version lacked spice overall flavor  read raves omelet guy but sadly egg person  highlight donut selection which isn't necessarily saying much unless made in house   If you're already guest Main Street Station wants refuel quickly use food credit then Garden Court Buffet may suffice  Otherwise would special trip many other options near Fremont  Perhaps mileage varies lunch dinner but I'd sooner Triple 7 Brewpub  See review  <EOR> Hmm  don't really know review place  came morning champagne brunch pretty large party  line pretty long but quickly able seat relatively fast considering size party    There many pros buffet  Once seated server quickly took drink orders able food  pretty good variety options organized well  seemed something everything  food ok well    Now onto con heck con  unfortunately caught sight roach line right waffle biscuit corned beef hash station obviously stopped appetite tracks   unforgivable book won't back  <EOR> This buffet strong 3 possible 4 if quality more consistent  Some food items good others just okay  salad bar does offer fresh veggies dressings all fresh homemade  favorite ranch bleu cheese no bottled vinegary taste just real creaminess!
