Very refreshing all way around  <EOR> Excellent bowls freshness good  Owner friendly cool  Must frequent place  <EOR> Whenever 5 star King enters Bowlology feels lost boy finding refuge warm cottage weeks wandering through cold dark forest  amazing staff greets guest welcome only compared sound thousand angels blowing trumpets heavens    I recommend Acaí PB Lover    P S  Whatever do if girl behind register recommends pitaya STAND YOUR GROUND   and stick Acaí <EOR> Place clean food good  definitely visiting establishment more often  didn't realize offered stamp rewards card  would nice young man took order mention it  <EOR> I really enjoy place but wish nutritional information  know putting body! Calorie intake fat protein etc  <EOR> I love bowls!! refreshing!!  use fresh ingredients   just wish larger money   But they're good treat awhile <EOR> I've craving Acai bowl since left home couldn't really find good place near location  just luck when pool red rock found maps bowlology  satisfying acai bowl day spent hot sun  Good price !we hula PB lover added protein <EOR> I love acai bowls  Bowlology delicious options but biggest pet peeve place lack nutritional information  If grabbing something labels itself healthy nutritious option I'd know only vitamin content but also calories  Often acai bowls nutritious but high sugar calorie content    Bowlology PLEASE add nutrition information your menus store least your website ! <EOR> Great food  However waited 2 bowls today 55 minutes   ridiculous   sure if short staff but don't think should ever take long  prob won't again  <EOR> The hula bowl acai fire!!!!!!!!!! could eat everyday multiple times day! <EOR> Love place  Açaí pitaya bowls delicious chicken teriyaki bowl  come almost every day <EOR> I use love employee rude kept giving stars when asked no bananas smoothie bowl am highly allergic response really upset me  Also pretty sure charged large but small  <EOR> Ive meaning try place very long time  Bear Bowl yummy! Although fee other Acai bowls past came tons gronola enough fine layer topping  doesn't lower rating still amazing just wasn't grainy ones San Diego <EOR> It's awesome poke place close home  place pretty good but bowls could little bigger price  understand fish isn't cheap but should add little extra rice something help fill up  starving hour dinner!  They should take cue Poke Time San Francisco which more create your own set which allows pick your own rice toppings sauce fish all same cost  <EOR> Acai bowls go to summer foods when hot outside heated food sounds straight unappealing  bonus chain now also offers poke bowls too  However consistency lacking prices high   POKE won't order any more due poor value  Barely any fish many toppings ingredients stock overpriced get  poke bowls available but unless they're going them well there's no point   ACAI Some days there's ton fruit topping other times there's barely any  Sometimes acai flavor strong fresh other times mix pale bland  don't know if product issue training issue but can't order same thing twice receive same product  Same issues pricing above overpriced get    Overall variety menu ability grab healthy lunch when working nearby but really only stop convenience due consistency pricing issues  <EOR> I love store  Used when Bowl Heaven kinda sad when heard changing Bowlology  Then discovered owner now same owner Acai T discovery restored sanity world cuz among finest acai bars found yet    Anyway Bowlology same menu its sister store young ladies work truly delightful dealt every them   Ingredients couldn't fresher   Restaurant always clean sparkles  As stated crew working personable knowledgable quick work hard see customers satisfied  only place where somebody come behind counter ask if Pitaya Berry Good bowl good if wanted if needed anything else   found other restaurant little bit more but other place Maui which getting weekly pretty tough  live Anthem yet drive Bowlology Acai T least once week   Worth effort time money  <EOR> I love spot! green machine pitaya bowl  delicious! could seriously eat everyday  am cautious sugar intake least sugar compared other bowls  really wish making your own personalized bowl option just switch but other can't complain  say love fact put granola top bottom  Aside menu bowls juices smoothies nut milks also sell gluten free snacks wall near checkout which definitely appreciate  best part right near place <EOR> Thai place would perfect but don't give easy access nutrition facts store online if you're tracking your macros place difficult <EOR> Good acai bowls   I always try ordering acais bowls mixed other things but just good pure Acai!

The poke bowl great  edamame should cooked bit longer maybe rice too  rice hard wasn't traditional sushi rice  wasn't really spicy either  tuna poke okay  wouldn't item again though probably just stick açaí pittaya bowls    The store clean workers alright  told lady first time there  She just asked if needed time just said yes she ran off orders  She looked she ready walk off  okay wasn't hard look read into items  <EOR> While bowls yummy give 4 due pricing WAY much time always wait long  <EOR> So place good açaí bowls but don't think worth price  Also where nutritional information? poke bowls definitely over priced   small amount fish enough sauce nickel dime every additional topping when many other poke places pay flat fee endless options put your bowls  jalapeños added poke bowl chopped into large chunks bigger fish  Why would want bite into giant piece jalapeño ruin flavor bowl way  can't say anything tasted bad but don't think worth back  <EOR> I'm açaí lover! Originally Hawaii know good açaí bowl taste like  very disappointed açaí bowls previously frozen sorbet scooped icecream  Real açaí should made order should thick consistency  flavor wasn't great well almost no taste it  2 stars workers very friendly cleanliness place  <EOR> 2nd time both purchases great  1st time juices time lunch  Green Machine wasn't quite sure expect but delicious  also great alternative ice cream frozen yogurt way healthier  fantastic selection gluten free vegan options well if you're picky place perfect  They're bowls gluten free vegan snacks well! Dbl bonus    Also if order your bowls without granola offer substitutes  <EOR> I'm visiting Toronto healthy bowl shops just starting become popular over there  Came lunch ordered upstream poke bowl salmon  salmon but wasnt fully defrosted yet because busy morning  didn't mind because taking would thaw time eat anyways but owner store nice apologetic inconvenience he gave complimentary hula bowl card told if don't he poke bowl come back later they'll another house   When he saw looking cold pressed juices he said take house    Toronto needs service this  I'd come back just because it  <EOR> This place best  Very clean  staff always friendly  Best Acai place west side  <EOR> This worst experiences because customer service  find myself sitting waiting bowl usually takes five ten minutes wait over 30 minutes  inquired employees long wait times he said just gave cold shoulder  ample amount room more employees work least notification busy times  felt under appreciated customer would come back specific location again  <EOR> Clean facilities  Friendly staff  Low value unfortunately   $11 poke bowl offered 6 slices cucumbers handful edamame small serving salmon splash ponzu whole lot brown rice  personal opinion arguably fair amount salmon but certainly poor veggie rice ratio  Thus low value opinion   Honestly wanted establishment walking distance healthier alternative when eating out  Unfortunately unable find value  <EOR> I always wondered place like  Finally decided try thought just okay  guy working front friendly also helpful  first time looking recommendation    We placed order tofu bowl poke bowl  thought prices really high  really don't many things choose from  asked water cup gave tiniest cup world  literally swallow  Uhm why? desert people drink water here  would happy pay cup where could gotten least full mouthful water    The girl back making food seemed stressed wait really long food  only place time  am sure return  really worth it  <EOR> I've coming since before switched over bowlology  Since switch gone down hill sure area today decided why stop in  Upon entering guy working counter believe he gauged ears backwards hat didn't great ya instead looked away bothering him  guys probably worst quality locations take business vitality bowls which far better! <EOR> Love place! always regular size acai bowl! Chocolate dream favorite! only location staff very friendly  They're also very clean establishment! appreciate when walk around bar bring your items! Awesome customer service! <EOR> Very clean friendly efficient establishment  However feel should only focus juices acai bowls  know trend now pokè bowls but think would just fine without it  Stream bowl plain no flavoring  kinda thrown off guard when received bc salmon warm expecting cool refreshing flavor   I'll update review next time wide selection acai bowls  <EOR> When 1st opened addicted place  literally Hula Acai bowl least once week  But months less came    Facility always clean staff always nice  Reason 3 stars     I realized time take Acai Hula changed lot  used 1 3 fruits 2 3 acai  Which great  Then fruits came less less lot less  Today decided again because awhile even worse would say 1 8 fruit!! no longer feel spend $10 luckily extra fruits home bunch acai left    In regards Poke bowls  done thing  Very little poke $11  Compared other poke bowls Vegas quite terrible look at  <EOR> The facilities clean nice  believe serve great acia bowls smoothie  If coming poke sadly disappointed  shouldn't surprise coming smoothie shop attempting cash booming poke popularity  <EOR> This used favorite acai poke bowl spot but really disappointed late    We lunch given half hearted greeting guy behind counter  ordered 2 poke bowls the og wicked tuna PB Lover bowl  When ordered bowl asked if wanted acai pitaya    It took FOREVER bowls at least 15 minutes   only person line behind she bowl first  Maybe need hire more staff? knows    anyway if food perfect wait would mattered    The wicked tuna really good but some larger pieces tuna frozen solid! No flavor almost inedible  OG bowl much sauce  Way salty again tuna frozen  Complete disappointment    The acai bowl good but wish more it  bowl half base half toppings  If wanted bowl fruit granola I'd order that    Not sure what's going place but sadly gone down hill quickly  <EOR> Came yesterday second time    give another try  Came year half didn't acai bowl    Had regular hula bowl won't back  acai bowls own home over 10 years  bowl lacks acai  Acai dark purple bowl very light purple didn't taste acai  feel bowl blended mostly banana other frozen fruit acai  If acai much    I won't back  <EOR> What perfect quick stop healthy delicious lunch!  drive restaurant almost every day silly me!  Fresh food quick friendly service!  back again bring friends! <EOR> I first time last weekend craving ever since  super refreshing hot day  wish came different kind container smaller choice size since cut fruit doesn't stay fresh overnight smallest size bit much me  ended tossing leftovers next day which bummed out  Otherwise really enjoyed bowl  <EOR> The poke bowl ordered great portions good but think price little bit more compared other places poke bowls Vegas  ordered wicked tuna poke bowl which $11 00 added salmon $3 00 seaweed $0 75 green onions $0 50  came $16 51 tax  several places around town poke bowls let add all kinds toppings set price allow half salmon half tuna which wanted without charging $3 00 more salmon  Having said poke bowl itself yum everything tasted fresh good  Probably freshest tasting poke bowls Vegas but somehow inspiring creative flavors toppings  Kind generic poke bowl but still good  would back <EOR> Bowlology differentiates itself amongst other super foods juice bars here  plenty visited tons establishments same concept but something company brand just blows away every time visit! its purity flavors definitely taste freshness heart place offers!   The first time Bowlology early 2016 wasn't fan checking yelp but if It'd probably more 20  offer variety fusion goodies just compliments each other way addictive  mean addiction bad however I'd give place exception   Reasonably priced quality comes modern simplistic spacious shop cater hungry customers welcoming friendly workforce  mean that?  Huge shoutout Dillon Josh crafting such amazing concept! met gentlemen shop crazed when found creators awesome business being said even offered free Acai! But  another topic!   Keep fantastic job guys! <EOR> First time Bowlology  ordered Spicy Shoyu  ok  Maybe just wasn't expected  tuna ok could fresher wasn't spicy opinion  might try again  Next time try smoothie maybe fruit bowl  <EOR>
