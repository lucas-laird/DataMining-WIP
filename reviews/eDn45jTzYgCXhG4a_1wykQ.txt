Didnt single thing explain bill    That left bad taste mouth never again  <EOR> Well really wanted place   but just ok   would give three stars but fact valet driver almost killed way really just added disappointment place two stars is   Service sat bar booths   waitress came right away take drink order wanted take food order but barely looked menu   told needed few minutes decide then she didn't come back almost 15 minutes!  Food very much enjoyed veggie burger order Baltimore Fries read fries smothered brown gravy    husband however did enjoy bacon bleu burger   He ordered medium rare came well done   No pink all   bacon burnt crispy burger   could tell bacon just sitting back kitchen   burgers $9 came small serving potato chips which thought fair price   fries however $5 such small serving!  Disappointing   Also disappointing drinks   ordered take Old Fashioned which didn't resemble Old Fashioned all   really basically just bourbon ginger   $10!!  Man down Strip better drink price   burger place!  shopping mall!  $10 drink?  Oh sliders $8 TWO them   kidding me?  place flat expensive   Setting If sit bar booths very careful because bottom booths extremely raw sharp!  wearing skinny jeans flat ankles exposed   point ankle grazed bottom booth hurt!  thought Geez need sand down edges something  When home realized ankle still stinging   looked down dried blood ankle!!  booth freaking cut me!!  Valet When walk restaurant located right next valet parking lot   husband crossing street valet driver came screaming lot bat hell literally drove straight toward slamming brakes stopping just inches me   am exaggerating   looked cursed him   He didn't respond just slammed gas soon stepped way then he cut off another car   horribe valet driver!  No remorse almost hitting cutting off another vehicle   Lackluster food drink near death experience left bad taste mouth   sure if I'd back  <EOR> We originally Tivoli some pizza but walked place said hell let's try it  Good decision  It 7 Saturday night honestly place little empty  Kinda strange thought but whatever seated right away  Good selection beers draft bottle tons wine options full half bottles  nice house Double Helix Chardonnay well good light house Double Helix lager draft   The burger selection good plus build your own  Would nice more topping choices BYO but basics covered   I sweet bleu bacon burger nicely cooked great toasted brioche bun  Fries server those conical stand faux newspaper wrapper keeps those bad boys hot through entire meal  no time every consider 1 2 pound burger small  cooked perfectly definitely big enough   We side salad annoying thing plate served small rectangle shape every time forked bite stuff flying all over place bit annoying  Guys serve larger plate put bowl!  When left around 8pm may 4 people entire place   the guy bar looked he cry sorry man gonna long night ya! bad hopefully picks them I'd back sure  <EOR> Disappointed  Portions small prices high  started pomegranate gimlet which very good taste don't flavored liqueur gin pom juice lime juice but basically paid $10 juice same second cocktail   lightweight tell when alcohol no alcohol drinks  meal pluck university stuffed which ground chicken stuffed mozzarella red chili chutney slaw taro bun  Sounds good paper right? fell apart immediately eat knife fork chutney strong burger   sweet potato fries burnt edible  entire table different order fries could all try them gravy fries probably best    Our server needed some extra training table 7 girls he acted very scared approach he would drop stuff run if he nervous ask if needed anything else  sure if he new but needs some people skills  overall con census table place isn't worth it  If want burger stick bachi burger burger bar  <EOR> I finally chance try happy hour Bottles Burgers last week   friend ordered 3 appetizers 2 beers bill $20 before tip    pretty strong!  arancini which essentially fried rice balls $4   good but very filling   Then Irish sliders which disappointed only 2 of   some reason expecting 3 $4   Very good though   Then still bit hungry tried Mexican dog $6 which super delicious though don't know why wasn't $4   hot dog Irish sliders brisket   Oh well can't complain much Double Helix draft beers only $2   Definitely happy hour spot back to   Oh yeah bit disappointed Blazin' Sliders weren't menu $4 listed web site   Oh well  <EOR> Bottles Burgers its perfect marriage! amazing beer selection Innis Gunn Delirium Chimay Blue   etc half bottles wine!
