Two words Rip off  <EOR> No problem problem because apparently replacing welcome! service forgettable food forgettable    price stomach ache isn't   This beautifully designed restaurant housing macaroni containers beautiful scenic artwork walls  restaurant very clean  However empty when walked cashier acted though he did favor taking order  cashier Patrick no personality but robotically said sure  no problem several times little nothing more say    This to go order  Overall Pepper Jack dish $8 65 added sausage 6 small slices additional $1 95 nothing special  sausage flavorless  honestly wondered if colored tofu    The Spinach Artichoke Mac reportedly good teenage standpoint but he just braces thankful something he could eat! thought $9 50 small bowl cheesy macaroni ludicrous  could huge pot goulash macaroni sausage less wouldn't hear no problem process   Afterwards both stomach aches  <EOR> I've heard such great things place excited try myself  ordered Philly Mac just okay  Nothing special I'd remember crave visit  Service great dining area very clean!

Service ok well  <EOR> The place looks clean well organized  fast food mac cheese see them creating dish  some really exciting choices menu but unfortunately execution poor  Let's just say three ate food down easily came easily less 2 hours later curled little ball until next morning  won't going back Mac Shack ever  <EOR> I come several times each week    love it  Always consistently good  <EOR> I'm sure why back  Laziness? Still being attracted concept? But glad did  guess shows every place off day    restaurants respond well criticism worthy second chance   We've back few times Mac Shack since underwhelming first try each time treated extreme courtesy each time food delicious    The protein other chunky add ons like mushrooms now plentiful easy find bowl unlike first trip  bread hot soft delicious which only know because free Yelp app check in along soda  respect savvy Mac Shack offer presumably more opinionated customers  And now smartphone less husband ordering own future visits trying some mine  Way hooked! I also appreciate company offers discount if order meatless dish Monday  vegetarian living 2011 as opposed less enlightened days endless baked potatoes cheese pizza boggles mind people still ask But but but EAT? Mac Shack challenging its value minded meat eating customers creative while saving some money  bonus rewarding vegetarians plus getting more people save some resources but shhh no preaching  return visits satisfying tempted give Mac Shack five stars  Only thing okay two things prevents this  First total nitpick issue expect any sensible person ignore they've started selling really expensive and particularly impressive cupcakes certain popular local bakery  Didn't just mention 2011? Why trying jump Hipster Cupcake Wagon *now*? And why subpar overhyped product? The second thing real reason docking star can't half n half sauces Mac Shack  If want say alfredo spicy red mixed together pay full price EACH sauce even though you're only getting half each  place  all designing your own pasta dish seems strange rule  And don't encounter live pasta stations buffets which work under similar philosophy choosing your own ingredients  I'd understand if just trying prevent bad mix but *can* mix sauces just pay twice much  creativity tax could say  Something wouldn't expect place selling cupcakes topped emperor's new icing  But overall really pleased gave Mac Shack another go  Solid fare plenty variety pleasant casual atmosphere  <EOR> Just eh  heard great things other people   and wasn't horrible but also wasn't amazing Mac n cheese  base Mac n cheese chicken bacon broccoli  good sure really stir but wanted bit more something special! first garlic stick great  tasted made real garlic  second stale signs shouldn't second suppose!   <EOR> Such shame apparent lead cook acts such dick  He complaining Spanish cashier a added original order b used Groupon then called fat cow her  Let's see if food worth it  <EOR> Good idea poor execution  Everything menu sounded great but smile turned into frown soon dish came out  Portion waaaaay smaller thought it'd considering paid $9 noodles vegetables only  Then thought fine maybe they'd tasty goodness  much  angel hair super greasy good way I italian roommate  understand yummy grease   Furthermore ingredient flavors did mesh well own recommended creation didn't pick ingredients   ate less half home still hungry  really tried place but disappointed overall  food wasn't horrible but very much doubt back  <EOR> I usually create your own because control freak! usually rigatoni roasted pepper sauce some veggies  portion size perfect if you're really hungry enough take some next day if you're not  Kids eat free Sundays wine half off Wednesdays  need put those two together perfect family dinner! <EOR> I love Nora's wasn't sure expect  liked feel place  crazy Alfredo crazy alright but good food would try again  still love Nora's more but fast food pasta its good change pace  <EOR> Wow  place awesome!i love and  don't even Mac n Cheese lol  The restaurant half fast food half normal restaurant   They modern music playing back ground very chill very relaxing  really good vibe it   It's super clean staffs very friendly everything very organized   The portion gave enormous order order two normal size people  ordered each didn't finish but hey love left overs lol  We buffalo chicken Mac which AMAZING! delicious tastes you're eating actually buffalo chicken wing even carrots celery!

Needless say excited give place shot  said very difficult keep hunger pangs bay soon entered establishment! met aroma only call   HEAVENLY   Based pleasant experience dashing unusually handsome staff place served boy know quantity those well proportioned bowls! ^_^ Portions placed side however Mac Shack's  scrumptious menu selection offerings does fall little more bland side  Maybe making sauces cheesier flavorful might help because based Philly mac cheese often found myself wishing stowed away some cheese slices home before walking into mac shack adding inconspicuously bowl more cheesy goodness  No plans things could've easily asked more sauce but epiphany  AHA!!! don't know if health reasons but perhaps adding less sauce gives option having your cake eating   Overall Mac Shack manages fulfill pasta cravings then some  If look past bland tastes less cheesier iterations your comfort food certainly keep coming back more guilty pleasure  But then again keep mind maybe skimp over cheesing offer comfort food way doesn't legendary lake mead beached walrus! <EOR> This concept wet dream almost every girl ever known  restaurant based around mac n cheese pasta  Plus serve wine beer  It's solid gold simple dinner date picky eater   Basically idea numerous varieties pastas including several alternative diet choices such farro wheat gluten free pastas variety styles linguine angel hair bow tie wagon wheel  You choose your pasta type then choose 8 10 different sauces then add items such meats veggies cheese   Then there's Mac choices  several types gourmet mac n cheese  favorite pepper jack mac which macaroni topped monterey jack pepper jack asiago cheeses jalapenos  The macs run $6 95 $7 95 then add Sausage $1 50 fresh tomatoes  50c fresh spinach  50c    My date ordered fettuccine noodles alfredo sauce $7 then added double order shrimp $1 75 x 2     yea   so everybody else said say too  order shrimp 2 shrimp! no means small but if feel 3 would little more substantial   The portions both pastas mac's filling big appetite  She could only finish half pasta  Our total roughly $23 without drinks   So main problem being 2 olive garden something comparable above mentioned also salad breadsticks same price feel just satisfied during lunch Maggiano's pasta but lunch portion far better filling less    I inside but basically screams yuppy!
