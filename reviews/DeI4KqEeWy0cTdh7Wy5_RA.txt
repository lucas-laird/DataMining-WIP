Found bit pricey offers  <EOR> So figured would check place since Indian craving while yet any city   The location strip mall  When first enter basically walk right into main dining area  If others sitting down kind end standing right over them seems little uncomfortable aspect  place pretty compact feel more dive joint versus restaurant atmosphere   When entered no greet kind standing couple minutes before decided help ourselves table  point servers came said needed cleaning would few  Which cleaned right away no biggy  Just awkward standing another table least 4 individuals whom sort interrupting dining experience being right behind chairs  much done expect expansion but don't see happening near future   Walls painted bright orange modern art pieces adorning wall  built wall separate kitchen restaurant glass decor piece etched art elephants which behind lies indian prints  Above tapestries traditional style indian sewing pieces   We seated soon enough upon entering  ordered Chicken Jalfrezi Veggie Kofta Curry the veggie meatball looking things very yummy curry sauce Garlic Naan Kashmiri Naan lamb type dumpling appetizer   I would give place 3 75 service but can't separate ratings 4 food itself    Appetizer came really fast  Wasn't expecting lamb ground when bit into actually pretty dry  Ya sauce order past dryness  Then seemed wait wait wait wait food come out  ding them service  Getting past wait time once food came yumminess! Veggie Kofta very tender melted your mouth creaminess curry sublime!
