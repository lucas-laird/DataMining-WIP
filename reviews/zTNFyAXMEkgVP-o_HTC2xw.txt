Anyhow dining credit meal on   decided share 16oz prime rib since read good Yelp reviews it chopped salad   very accomodating allowing split entree *no split plate charge* fact overheard waiter telling another table well give them kudos that   never did understand lame split plate charge     So yeah chopped salad  good came two plates us   good mix just right amount dressing enough avocado both smile     The prime rib decent   large piece plenty share cooked order medium rare   However definitely needed couple hits salt shaker both opinions   would nice seasoned little kitchen   think really no seasoning all   being said Au Jus sauce came tasty fresh horseradish requested spicy enough waiter put glow dark   seriously spiciest horseradish think ever had   gave wasabi kick if used much   Why find horseradish sauce stores??  Also worth mentioning served bread before meal   white sourdough believe some brown bread sesame fruit it   brown bread really good sourdough Meh   When asked if wanted more bread both agreed only brown bread please!    butter still super hard cold presumably because right 5 when opened maybe hadn't thawed  Would preferred soft butter oh well no biggie   All all wouldn't eat again see paragraph #2      other things spend money besides prime rib   It also weird instructed present dining coupon beginning meal   When asked waiter he said yeah need right away     then he just proceeded prop front table leaning against candle holder if label cheapskates rest restaurant duration meal                 Thanks that   Maybe signal chef bother seasoning prime rib   Guess we'll never know  <EOR> Best steak ever had     not many places  service top notch  relaxed never wait before checked see if needed something else  am Outback Steakhouse fan but eating Camelot Outback seems eating steak Denny's <EOR> Came group friends Friday night total disappointment  would recommend coming here  ordered porterhouse gf ribeye two others filets  made all feast soup salad sides dessert all  Apps came timely manner however entrees delayed large party  place wasn't even half full kitchen backed party 8  When food did arrive porterhouse undercoooked much knife wouldn't even cut through meat  Told bartender very nice throughout whole thing  When steak back burnt most parts rare medium all wanted medium rare steak  manager came offered half assed apology offered take $18 off but did say sorry undercooked steak doorstop excuse re fire  If choice spending your $$ steak house recommend wasting your time money one    only gleaming light whole experience bartender tried right  <EOR> Keeping to the point style going list pros cons pros very relaxing atmosphere maybe because weren't many people but place seemed very clean perfectly lit service waiter very courteous made sure food okay value $30 person deal good value  Although steak wasn't huge definitely appropriate size  french onion soup also delicious The bread serve start meal pretty darn good especially because variety slices  DESERT  Oh god chocolate mouse AMAZING    cons Inside Excalibur guess only customers stay hotel  am biggest fan Excalibur because smoky Casino but Vegas wasn't expecting anything cleaner The presentation food bit sloppy <EOR> On pricier side but if stayed Excalibur 20$ dollars off! Angus burger cost $1 + left 4 dollar tip!  I ordered Black Angus Burger shrimp it  burger cooked medium well but shrimp gave odd texture truth told    Also bun could better  Given texture might recommend pretzel bun next time!  Fries mediocre  If care some outstanding fries truffle fries BURGER  <EOR> Coupon foursquare 10 off valid fri sat but coupon doesn't say that   Food good but ok steakhouse  Meat load good but sides good  <EOR> Hostess= super nice  Waiter= horrible!!

But new york steak underseasoned overdone served garnish but no side   sad   chocolate mousse dessert okay but think desserts should always amazing that's why restaurants separate pastry chefs    Drinks bar usual $10 drink    bubble gum martini tastes just grape bubble gum just overbearingly sweet   Good port list   Strong drinks   The normal menu just seems far pricey place   tries nice restaurant but cmon you're Excalibur outside use restroom   Thunder Down Under 100 ft door   good experience because service music but won't coming back  <EOR> The only thing bad Las Vegas properties 35 dollar per day resort fee making simple room 100 more night  Steakhouse fabulous  Italian place something midwest  better  stuffed shells 15 dollar bread should free   Stick TheSteakhouse  old Italian place quite nice then MGM bought property quickly gave AM PM boot put  them across street buy 7 dollar Excalibur coffee  still love place mainly because clientele arent pretentious snobs  <EOR> I slightly hesitant eating again because last time ate threw up  time around tomato basil soup chopped salad  food pretty good service okay  probably wont back primarily because lot dishes damn expensive  <EOR> Pros dessert great    Cons food season poorly  seasoned all  staff friendly  attentive all  took forever even drinks ordered    Never eating again  <EOR> This place pretty bad  reservations waiter worst attitude!

Mein mitteleuropäischer Magen war jedenfalls nicht mehr der Lage sich noch Gedanken über eine zusätzliches Desert zu machen  Das Ambiente des Restaurants könnte etwas gemütlicher sein aber unser Sitzplatz war schon ganz Ordnung für ein Steakhaus  <EOR> $36 99 prix fixe menu includes choice app entree dessert  French Onion soup steak creme brûlée    The French Onion great but steak flavorless bit tough  came no sides baked potato $6 no toppings but butter sour creme  creme brûlée pre made frozen no scorched top even separating bottom  More buffet food here   Wine beer list super limited  TV bar doesn't even broadcast HD  service hit miss   3 stars because used $20 credit  would pretty disappointed pay full price place    <EOR> Note management if accept 8 30 pm dinner reservation allow two hours dinner service inform potential guests close 10 00 pm   Although food great service rushed poor   Here's experienced Jose server * Only took drink orders three four table   *Plopped $72 bottle  pino grigio wine table pouring *When asked wine ice bucket ten minutes later he said Yeah yeah open three other tables wine then you   *Asked if done salad five minutes served   *Called honey    * When asked dessert menu he said closing   lounge only open dinner *Hovered over husband while he filling room info check *Grabbed check once completed   Food great reasonably priced  Won't going back  Better service Perkins  <EOR> I am thoroughly impressed  came down some co workers mine one being husband   decided nice steak dinner last night group  seated Jose pleasant could be   He consistently made sure water full everything   server Mauro  fun guy   He joked really made sure wonderful time    I ended getting 12 oz prim rib  Let just tell Jack chef knows cook  OMG  Absolutely amazing   Usually eat steaks ketchup to give some flavor   prime rib juicy tender didn't even use steak sauce provided   amazing     The only real downfall even though few couples eating took little while food out   ok though   would rather time take time cooked right rather rushed wrong   Definitely worth wait     I don't come Vegas alot but would definitely come back here  <EOR> Every time visit Vegas dinner here  food consistently good!   The best appetizer portabella stuffed mushroom huge! highly recommend trying it  always seem filet never disappointed  also ask well done cooked perfectly never dried out      The service good although last couple visits timing kitchen seemed off  obvious some side items cooked earlier then others left sit while rest order finished  <EOR> My wife's birthday 21March2017  She never prime rib   first now she's going expect all good was  filet mignon  Asked medium well but came more well  Still good seasoned beautifully   Only complaint when made reservations before departed Vegas placed note section birthday  matre'd even said Happy Birthday wife when walked state reservation  expected least Happy Birthday cupcake slice cake candle dessert house her  price paid  least could happened  only thing cause umbrage me  <EOR> Pro 1 Service great 2 Drink just perfect 3 food fantastic salmon salad lobster bisque Ahi Tuna all well prepared served hot plate lots beautiful smiles  Con 1  Steak over priced particularly hotel which built over 40 years ago 2  Terrible location  31 2 stars <EOR> The salmon steak good  Don't under stand paying extra sides your meal  fries receive brick hard  Also way over <EOR> Amazing food great service  asked manager via Instagram husband would visiting Excalibur during anniversary stay  said would definitely love try steak house  am happy did  greeted name congratulated sat down  server brought over complementary glass champagne  husband ordered rib eye chicken pasta  Both delicious  given cheese cake dessert  definitely making steak house place lovely dinner whenever come Vegas  Thank making anniversary dinner memorable  <EOR> Extremely slow start finish despite restaurant being less half full  nearly enough flavor steak  identical cut steak Outback night before delicious   $35 NY Strip $7 side $5 non alcoholic beverage? Crazy without delicious food snappy service   On positive note gentleman refilled drinks point  Super nice always time early  <EOR> While staying Excalibur Hotel Casino heard restaurant   Locals told great well     After reviewing Yelp opted three course meal   had NY Strip EXCELLENT Filet EXCELLENT  We also found coupon hotel and online $10 off if $75 more which worked well   NOTE David Espin duty night Restaurant Manager   say he TOP 5 Managers ever encountered!! <EOR> I rule Vegas follow buffet steakhouse  steakhouse always fancy dinner  stayed Excalibur naturally ate here  place pricy but knew going being vacation did care  start food then onto service   The food I ordered Filet Mignon baked potato  just ok  definitely better filets time  nothing special could use some seasoning if ask me!!!! Thank lord A1 because without would no flavor  did cook medium rare requested did melt your mouth filet supposed to  baked potato excellent enjoyed very much    My husband ordered prime rib he liked his  He let try some loved it  Au Jus dipping sauce bursting flavor steak cooked just right! wished would ordered instead  He ordered stuffed baked potato he loved that    The service Ok where place lacking severely  When paying price paying eat think service should reflect that  water did refilled very often once waiter took orders he disappeared  Once food brought everyone disappeared seemed like  When finally did find someone inconvenience refills drinks  When finally time leave busboy named Jose came asked husband if he wanted box food  He brought box quickly put food him  He brought more horseradish sauce some plastic ware eat later  He only provided good service thought should get    The 3 stars prime rib potatoes Jose  honestly say would come again  many other steakhouses Vegas try waste time  <EOR> Exceeded expectations!!  reading many positive negative Yelp reviews took chance decided use some Vegas Slots gold coins purchase $100 off $200 minimum definitely great buy!  Our waiter Shawn very professional very kind   other wait staff also top things   cleared empty plates promptly constantly kept glasses full   ambiance very spacious dark other steakhouses   Very comfortable environment   High class quality steakhouse  quiet but quiet without stuffy arrogance other competing steakhouses   dress code very relaxed casual which great Vegas   Now food   steaks we rib eyes filet mignon cooked perfectly well seasoned   Perfect char grilled right heat tender!  If going start appetizer would bacon wrapped shrimp!  Mashed potatoes light fluffy   only disappointment bread basket good assortment just wish hot   herbed butter though its saving grace   Hopefully lower star reviewers come back experience family tonight  <EOR> Camelot steakhouse located inside Excalibur  now pay parking but if your local just need scan your drivers license  attendants assist if your confused work it    Our friends invited dinner special menu prix fixe   choices mixed green onion soup entree salmon steak chicken dessert fried Oreo  onion soup which bad friend says salty her  entry flat iron steak which bad but could better  dessert server gave another option which think very nice creme brulee  all tried everything prix fixe   The service very good found server working 26 years  just don't remember name  manager came also table checked us  <EOR> $36 3 course dinner [per person]  + amazingly perfectly cooked steak  + delicious twice baked potatoes fresh salad incredible creme burl + decent staff service + uptight atmosphere laid back guests                                                                   100 % hit spot before gambling night away!  MMMM! <EOR> I only decided try place because $20 off coupon no minimum purchase necessary  think steakhouse primarily gets few customers offer hotel guests   Going lot steakhouses consider myself pretty knowledgeable steaks  While service minimally decent could better    Their bread served cold hard cold butter cubes  serve cold bread cold butter? Especially steakhouse! wheat bread cranberry dried fruits inside but hot crispy would more appetizing   Their steaks cooked iron grill press served cold warmish   huge no no me! Props them over cooking steak which common mistake many steakhouses accidentally but serving steak almost cold unacceptable  Also barely any flavor steak all  felt extreme raw animal carnivore tearing flavorless raw piece red meat =x  Pros very fast service both waiters cooks work fast hence probably why cold food $20 off just flat iron steak 10oz $25 yourself $5 steak hahahaha cooked medium rare rare way should didn't over cook Cons cold bread cold steak poor seasoning  2 stars just $20 off <EOR> I nostalgic every time walk into Excalibur   Probably because am child 80's remember when Excalibur first opened   love themed hotels Las Vegas am sad actually trying remove themes some hotels   really miss boat ride Luxor theme park Lions MGM Grand   Now Lions gone area turned into Arcade Ping Pong Tables   theme park MGM demolished turned into Signature Condos   boats many Egyptian features now gone Luxor LAX being turned into E Sports arena   But least now still Camelot Steakhouse Fun Dungeon Tournament Kings   heard rumors though Tournament Kings closing end year calendar seems show much   Camelot Steakhouse throwback old school Vegas!  feel stepping back time 25 years when walk through doors trust good thing   old school Vegas white table cloths leather booths   service fantastic food also classic Vegas Steakhouse fare   Back day would play all night earn comp Steakhouse   Even Circus Circus Stardust always great Steakhouse could comp high end players   walked your comp would order same thing every time!

Waitress very attentive much food couldn't eat all! <EOR> Over priced quailty food!  Good service very nice staff but felt quailty steak could gotten Chillies <EOR> Food acceptable  3 course meal 36 99 person  portions large but both steaks overcooked   service very disappointing  felt ignored restaurant even half full   finally placed both finished plates end table napkins still waited 15 minutes before anyone would bring check despite many staff passing table  sat patiently did complain but going back  <EOR> I really enjoyed visit place   The room elegant high class steakhouse look offers usual steak house pricing model expensive steaks separate charges salads sides sauces     I started spinach salad bacon vinaigrette  thing big enough share or eat meal delicious  followed filet which casem perfectly cooked tender tasty  ordered bordelaise sauce side good sopping bread  Oh when first sat down brought basket bread which included solid french bread interesting fruit nut bread    My only criticisms place are 1 need list spirits better server knowledge bar offerings more completely stocked bar don't play guess scotch server then run bar then back then back bar    2 steak could used more seasoning nothing exotic just little salt pepper man    But overall day cheap drinks snacks Starbucks place provided solid meal drink well worth cost  <EOR> Drinks great  But New York steak all fat  3 stars because resolved issue but also atmosphere inside made feel sickly want eat anything  <EOR> All four agree  food great  Two lobster declared much better while S  F   pre fixed meal $39 95 declared fantastic deal  prime rib which large cooked perfection  The service fantastic  never experienced such polite efficient service any restaurant  <EOR> First good appetizer artichoke cheese dip fantastic   french onion soup really good   side dish blue cheese au gratin potatoes favorite everything   Lastly waiter incredibly attentive   Now bad steaks horrendous   realize some fat cut meat necessary   but much difficult chew any piece meat stinks   Unfortunately since steakhouse main dish looked forward to     Will returning many other steakhouse options  <EOR> I'm sorry but food all expected  Service terrible management made attempt address disappointment trying steaks correct  Apparently chief does know Medium Well ??
