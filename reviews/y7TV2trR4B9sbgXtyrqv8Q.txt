Great place!!! <EOR> A casual restaurant back end Palms casino   Food ok lots calories glutton meals portions big food taste just ok nothing write home pricey no station casino meal deals since now own Palms  Example pricey lobster roll $25 I twice menu big selection garbage food practical maybe impress non locals visiting   only use food credit does even cover most meals once gone might return    Parking free readily available take dessert no prices must ask ? Service slight slower when busy even though many servers servers also drinks therefore might delays back getting drinks other tables serving? Usually new place mgmt would ask doing just quick hello never saw any managers both times visited  Would expressed service slow waited bit check boxes leftovers FYI boxes use sucks leak close well granted paper products    <EOR> Breakfast food desserts awesome here! love baked pastries Lucky Penny provides them all  favorite pancakes  Better average IHOP's pancakes lit dance floor taste buds! <EOR> DO EAT HERE  Cross contamination SAD service  came because staying palms offered breakfast 24 7  seeing no wait very few people decided perfect place grab bite before flight  sat down 730 waited 10 mins until someone finally saw came take order  ordered vegan gf PB J pancakes acai berry syrup side berries  figured simple quick food  tried getting waiter 20 mins order drink no luck  food FOURTY FIVE mins later  no service waiter despite being only couple tables restaurant people already gotten food   and DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE RIGHT FOOD  brought bacon said sorry didn't order also vegan mentioned before  then brought lukewarm plain pancakes 3 bananas some jiff peanut butter top  Just dry pancakes incredibly artificial tasting peanut butter  felt neglected waiter just rolled eyes consistently  tried getting waiter another 15 mins during time tried asking different staff even bring order menu half items left off  Then recieved tiny cup maple syrup not all real maple syrup definitely aunt jemima male staff looked incredible run down but atleast incredibly nice explained would love rest order acai syrup berries because eating dry cold pancakes peanut butter just deeply unpleasant  asked another time syrup  told just another minute cant find acai syrup its part dish ordered definitely anywhere near special request finally brought acai puree syrup  proceeded try eat worst pancakes ever life  then finally bring teeny cup berries filled water no idea why then notice theres bits salad inbetween pancakes  Yes green strings pancakes  even sure why because wasnt berries  done point now running late flight asked them if could rush check  check says bacon vegetables pancakes  then say never ordered bacon vegetables   that took another 15 minutes finally allowed leave worst meal ever had  cant recommend place all  feel sad having leave but unacceptable being 2 hours  <EOR> My server super duper nice! needed outlet could work eat bfast he moved booth near outlet right away   I ordered fresh fruit platter bagel cream cheese  Along ice black coffee   The fresh fruit good amount really liked berries mixed mint leaves  banana bit discoloration but wasn't bad anything  bit surprised bagel toasted little close being burnt  its fine but others might not  coffee alright when wanted take rest back room server willing pack fresh ice coffee me!
