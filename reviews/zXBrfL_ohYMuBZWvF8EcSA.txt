Yeah guess could sexy    Unless think fruit bugs leaves sexy  Not judging if are! The first issue strawberries leaves MELTED CHOCOLATE  Honestly could miss that?  expect your customers notice it? Luckily time brought switched out  Easy  Done  didn't even ask them switch out  Tonight another story  sister ate strawberries she started freaking because bug crawled bag  tiny bug  kinds find berries didn't wash yet  First brought bag cashier  asked if wash berries if even inspect them whatever  She's Yeah wash them  Sorry that  most omg late just want here  fault issues  attitude ever   Didn't offer if want talk manager anything  problem me  okay thanks guess  waited bit waited until busser came by  told happened she brought Joe manager  Joe explained corporate policy berries come pre washed  He said chocolate wouldn't stick otherwise  He then said would keep extra eye when inspect morning  He offered another dessert another strawberry which nice  didn't take bit grossed bug    Yeah say lot confidence won't returning there  Ever  even if paid meal  If wanted soup anything Panera Bread down street Sweet Tomatoes isn't far either   If just watch bugs! <EOR> The sandwiches really good soups but plates look little dated     could atleast new ones only plastic <EOR> Great food price decent quality  quicker version Sweet Tomatoes without having serve yourself  step below Panera terms quality but still valid cheaper option! Great customer service expansive menu options  <EOR> Food just ok  mango berry salad best  There's combo sandwich half salad half soup  pick two  But combo does come drink chips  service there's many employees they're all yelling different things same time making very confusing overwhelming experience while ordering  panera bread better food better experience  <EOR> So reading Yelp reviews expectations set Nordstrom's Cafe quite although cheaper but better Panera  liked selection sandwiches soups offered but food mediocre  lobster bisque crab avocado melt  lobster bisque 'meh'    thick flour roux base reminiscent would expect clam chowder street vendor San Franscisco  huge lobster flavor refined any means     The crab avacado melt potential very good mean crab avacado wrong but bacon overpowered delicate flavor crab  love bacon but time nor place bacon bully way in  Other sandwich good price    This place packed lunch crowd line door  restaurant very cafeteria feel very loud again acoustics left something desired  <EOR> This perfect place cold winter night  1st time restaurant surly last one!

Very friendly service young man named Chris very helpful hard working! <EOR> Not worth price if getting salad  only fill half bowl lettuce  If ask more lettuce which cheapest ingredient tell only allowed five prepositions amount  If watch them place lettuce your bowl find pre portioned all just whatever amount lettuce server decided put your bowl  Prepare dissatisfied paying $5 salad looks ration  great experiences all Zupas until visit  Please decrease price your salads if going ration ingredients  if going ration claim give pre prepared amounts consider actually using measuring utensil consistent rather claiming giving allowed amour when previous visits quite different  suggest getting quality assurance rep  <EOR> First off start positive   staff very friendly   However when asked getting extra scoop lettuce informed I'd buy additional salad because 'this portion size '  Now understand if asking protein but wasn't   lettuce base probably cheapest items   Adding extra scoop would satisfied customer me   This second bad experience Cafe Zupas  reason never back   better options same price point  <EOR> My biggest addiction  create your own salad every day spinach almonds pistachios amazing poppysead  dressing  <EOR> Went again lunch before work ordered glazed chicken chipotle salad    work 20 mins later find forgot chicken!

Especially frustrating if group more three   Nuff said <EOR> First just way before rant  food 6 10  ok but nothing crazy about   Here's where crazy  hate place! only reason maybe 6 7 times because 11 yr old daughter loves it  Why? no clue  Maybe because she doesn't deal complete cluster f**k mess when try order painful process walking line all way register   So order sandwiches first stop then stop 2 salads order salads keep moving down line soups  Then stop give them soup order then getting asked ordered! Why? would think maybe hook correct soup correct sandwich  Nope! sure why ask because they're just putting soup bowls tray   After arrive register ask 3rd time did order? which point lose freak all them  unorganized when someone orders entire family remember all 6 sandwiches soups sandwiches then repeat total 3 times? mention rush doesn't help when you're trying through process just sit down eat   You people need your act together! understand happening first couple days grand opening but point would think place would streamlined process! Nope! gotten worse time on   At point willing bribe daughter just anything including car 16th birthday prevent having place again!
