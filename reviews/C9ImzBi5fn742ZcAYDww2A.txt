Regardless wanted potatoes cooked oil  no go  ordered juice    sucked down   and return  <EOR> What find! Thank Yelper's  Before left Strip hotel wanted find local place way home  Just couple miles off freeway gem    Whimsical decor fun waitstaff  ordered pot bread recommended disappointed  Just right serving size its little teacup    Someone else suggested corned beef hash eggs  breakfast but haven't long time gave try  good   Our waitress Cary delightful attentive always filling glasses even half full    We definitely back <EOR> 1st timer busy breakfast place southern highlands everything delicious  Full coffee juice bar  Chilequiles chicken waffles delicious  <EOR> Great breakfast place  wide selection food everything cooked order   Highly recommended <EOR> Pretty Good palace   plate $15   Only down fall charge $1 cheese both eggs hash browns     But everything meal really good   <EOR> Crunchy French toast amazing  also green juice  eat every trip Vegas  <EOR> Being huge fan breakfast food wish could say loved place excited back especially since locally owned  But unfortunately isn't case    he service great  greeted right away seated  Soon someone took drink orders [they serve illy coffee!]  Soon waitress came see if any questions    I'm mission find best chicken fried steak Las Vegas easy choice when saw menu  admit once food came saw order wanted drool little bit  nice big portion chicken scrambled eggs gravy hash browns    The eggs cooked well enough but lacked any taste whatsoever  little salt would've gone long way  hash browns seemed little undercooked  Potato still kind starchy missing nice golden brown color top  gravy actually quite good probably highlight dish  Moving main item steak  liked fact thick steak thin batter it  Unlike eggs did lack flavor whatsoever  Unfortunately ONLY flavor black pepper  Apparently lacked salt eggs made excessive amount black pepper coating steak steak    One fellow diners ordered chicken waffles  chicken same exact problem steak  All could taste black pepper  unfortunate really because both chicken steak tender cooked well    The pot bread came order sub par  eggs lacked taste  don't usually but butter rolls but bread definitely needed some flavor    So all all great service but lacked bit food department  food cooked well but needed better execution opinion  Hopefully just off day  Maybe next time if happen side town during breakfast hours might give another chance  But definitely worth another 20 minute drive sole purpose eating there  <EOR> This place AWESOME! Great food great service prices very reasonable  pretty cool all waitresses wear pajamas  <EOR> When put cold dinner roll microwave know happens? becomes warm hard rock  very obvious few orders cup bread received reheated microwave  super dry minute two hard rocks completely inedible  Wouldn't such big deal but $3 pop expect something edible  Very disappointing  Everything else fine  just aggravating when restaurants poor choices hopes save few cents cuz end they're losing lot more inspiring find different breakfast spot  <EOR> Some friends said place really good decided give go also good Yelp reviews being Yelper am try put faith fellow Yelpians is we're called?  dunno    Unfortunately little less hoping for   We arrived seated immediately   restaurant maybe half full looked most people eating already finished enjoying cups coffee talking amongst parties   expected pretty quick efficient service due did receive it   Everything slow ordering getting things table check really disappointing since obvious missed big rush  The hash browns definitely nothing write home tasted starchy tried some fiancé's   coffee watery mud oil   ordered signature dish because really try those places   blueberry cream cheese stuffed french toast I believe name    came HUGE!  definitely don't skimp portions hence extra star   When tried though way processed sugary   picked blueberries french toast awhile but full super fast ended sharing rest table   French toast doesn't really good leftovers   Pretty sure should gotten heart attack but overall taste decent   Another downer didn't low fat cream cheese alternative which probably why felt full fast well   Overall definitely impressed   Perhaps everyone else just lucky better food service did   Considering above plus prices I'd rather just IHOP  <EOR> I think going drive back LA just come eat here!!! chilaquiles rib eye steak plate AMAZING!

Price very good worth every penny  <EOR> Food amazing!  The staff also wears PJs which feel you're right home getting home cooked breakfast! <EOR> They serve while pajamas!!!  One little quirk found endearing fact servers run around pajamas while taking your order serving you  Nice little gesture feel ease don't take things seriously   We arrived told omelets great Pot'o'Bread BEST steak n eggs pretty bomb    Well told pretty much truth  pretty hefty filling omelet wife steak n eggs all Pots o Bread   Now say PoBs little underwhelming  Really cool concept fun little quirk staple your establishment    but wasn't enough cinnamon wasn't quite enough flavor  But still! texture great really fun enjoy   The servings all pretty big both lady take food [and pretty hefty eater]  steak she more fatty we'd prefer but still substantial enough amount meat enjoy   The service great everyone friendly feel very welcomed enjoy good time Rise Shine  bad guys bad all   Come if want something off strip nearly noisy good time  <EOR> Very cute atmosphere especially strip mall establishment  really impressed decor attention detail all styling   flower umbrellas hanging ceiling tile framed windows made setting more whimsical industrial  waitresses all pajama style uniforms which nice added touch  Though also mention owner working cash register but didn't much effort impression customers     The food very good ordered chiliquilas steak along Belgium waffles  also French press coffee which served table timer perfect cup    So why only 3 stars?  place good but little expensive charge extra everything! fact whole column menu run down charges    But items arent really sides  unless usually eat avocado itself?  Also $4 bacon?  breakfast steak only $3 more chiliquilas themselves sure math one  Bottom line place little way nestled neighborhood strip mall could better pricing is    conclude saying place probably best left locals  <EOR> What fun place!
