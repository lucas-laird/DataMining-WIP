If opportunity came but keep memories super fun successful Saturday afternoon here  <EOR> I fun here   really did   But staff annoying   We yelled three times row having belongings pool   understand don't want liability issues but need sunscreen going devastated if someone steals it   Plus expect pay drinks if expected tip incredibly rude bag guy every time money?  He actually said know expected tip $10    Umm   no   he wants every time it?  Basically everyone needs chill out   On other hand did great time much more laid back other pools but still party vibe   pool small but decent size comparison some others everyone gets inside splash just fun  <EOR> A good sized pool lounge yes lounge small pool middle few cabana areas around some tiny plunge pools cabana areas well looked more tanks actually    We skipped long line little past noon Saturday cause friends throwing small event there  bag check very strict much more strict regular pools Aria  Absolutely NO any type medications even over counter ones tums band aids eye drops Advil even hand sanitizers! course no outside water beverage food alcohol allowed put everything away before going just take everything throw them away!   We ordered bottle Grey Goose pineapple mixer exceptionally good! drank much goose vodka! Also some appetizers later lobster tacos shrimp cocktail fresh delicious  servers very attentive friendly took really good care entire afternoon  Funny thing bartender bar asked ID when tried order drink charge room but other waitress didn't ask hubby's ID when he ordered bottle Grey Goose? What's that? needed ID 30 bucks Mai Tai but bottle 500 bucks Goose vodka? didn't sense!   I am really into pool parties don't well heat wasn't even hot day but still really dehydrated afterwards  fun time good music good crowd all single guys left gf alone once told them husband just over there  But no dancing tables having gf dancing allowed all thought sin city! Whatever! <EOR> I think best times ever had!  Liquid feels spa very relaxing atmosphere   nine large cabana private wading pool wonderful waitress named Dani another attendant named TJ sure ask them both next time am there   started bottles Patron Silver Grey Goose Stoli Orange managed polish off several more throughout day help dozen fine young ladies   place if you're looking great service relaxing atmoshere not pickup joint    Well worth price! <EOR> This place unorganized such pain ass deal with  Nick claims manager rude bachelor party wasn't helpful all when offered some suggestions  definitely back nor suggest place anyone  <EOR> This place gets hella crazy! Everybody drinking having great time but might also see people puking around  Staff recommended use lockers because there's constant theft phones wallets  Plus they're around $40   cool first 3 hours but OVER IT  Music good! Super crowded though sardine status  Drinks $35 <EOR> Where even begin     first off confiscate throw all outside food beverages including gum drinks bought other pool hotel! Then absolutely no where put any belongings towels besides edge pool where soaked point being worse no towel then security came through told would check bag $30 unless PHYSICALLY wearing pool all times  music good but crazy pool day party weren't allowed jump around anything fun besides hit some inflatable beach balls back forth  Probably most surprising tiny whole area less 20 beds around pool but reserve them before hand substantial fee ONLY place sit besides water  staff wasn't attentive unless paid beds  last but least nice resort Aria should better view least some scenery instead feels small walled off corner  <EOR> Being cute any perks place! People front door really rude pool much small  only gets 2 stars because drinks sippy cups delicious    I comped day bed which very grateful but showed late reservation due trying locate some loved ones deployed hearing recent accident Afghanistan  completely understood getting free day bed expected pay since showed late but promoter hooking yelled he father  When tried explain happened he said Your story no bearing decision  Power trip especially because 14 girl friends all extremely polite  pay day bed but walking check place decided way crowded sweaty  literally no room move pool    Instead hung regular Aria pool blast  If you're looking Pool Party I'd recommend Encore Beach instead! awesome  Liquid step your game  <EOR> They first time ever came amazing experience!

Overall great spot hang if you're Aria  <EOR> Worst place ever!  First practically strip searched   took case vitamins showed least three different security guards before decided ok   BUT couldn't use any them while pool area   sure didn't take them out   F'ing dumb   They're vitamins   then confiscated tangerines   three them   always sure stash few snacks case blood sugar gets low but felt security issue three tangerines   seriously easier enter pentagon White House Liquid   Oh did mention spent over $1200 day?!?  Seriously?  going spend $1200 but can't keep couple tangerines?!?!  pool small food gross atmosphere stupid DJ sucked   only thing could compliment staff once entered   always made sure refill drinks $600 bottle Kettle purchased    place joke save your time money   F Liquid! <EOR> Liquid Aria's answer Wet Republic Bare Moorea Beach Club Encore Beach Club just every other day time pool party strip offer  managed Light Group which also manages Bare  mind its being nightclub day time DJ's spinning music alcohol being overpriced girls skimpy attire    What does going it? Aria which nice property  facilities top notch but still think Encore Beach Club better bet your daytime partying needs  <EOR> The pool clean really nice kind of Small comparison other day clubs  But enjoyed myself  bday great time     Slightly high prices but  expected when visiting day clubs  Service GREAT  table waitress friendly attentive incredibly beautiful   We live def back <EOR> I can't compare any other exclusive pool scene only wife to  just planned going regular pools Aria when spied place became curious  podium passed guys handing VIP passes young ladies walking by  When wife stopped did best ignore us   it actually quite comical    let's ignore paying guests! LOL  strange business model  Finally gents asked wife if he could help her    she asked club fees  He said she could definitely free but would normally need pay  But then he said fairly slow he gave pass well  didn't ID's ran back room ours  club staff actually fairly pleasant helpful  shared lounge chair given $100 minimum  3pm weren't going splurge two lounges  4pm staff came over said could take another adjacent lounge free  majority customers 20 30 year olds we're quite friendly very amusing watch  wife likened final bill being same show bill      except customers show! two pitchers margaritas two bottled waters  grand total somewhere around $170 00 tip  venue cigar friendly quite content sitting back smoking stogies sipping margarita watching madness unfold  Actually couple people came remarked good cigars smelled wanted know where gotten them  staff seemed having much fun crowd  waitresses thrown pool few coworkers  music bass pounding hip hop    not exactly thing but great soundtrack spectacle  Overall good time  staff very attentive    coming refill your glass empty your ash tray sure didn't need anything else  club closes 6pm when left could very clearly see lack any vibe basic pools  nice   but very laid back  all looking for  people watching value Liquid pretty priceless! <EOR> We just missed Jamie Foxx!

Drinks expensive  BUT luckily made friends boys w bottle service good times kept rolling   This pool big unless super early reserve cabanas probably place sit  However plenty fun party people pool tossing beach balls enjoying each other's company    You check your things upon arrival complimentary don't worry leaving your purse wallet unattended blast   I would recommend party younger crowd 20 30's  loud fun people looking lay back relax!
