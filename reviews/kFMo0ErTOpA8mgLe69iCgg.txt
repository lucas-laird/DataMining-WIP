What better attend convention able Nathan's hot dog fries  look forward convention knowing Nathan's lunch  hands down best fries cheese sauce doesn't any better  think need spend more time training staff familiarizing them menu <EOR> Smallest most expensive corn dog life  laughable  French fries even longer corn dogs     You're better off spending your money hot dogs here  Those actually pretty good   <EOR> You see location Nathan's Famous street   located inside Las Vegas Convention Center   We visited Las Vegas Convention Center 3 days row watch nephew's basketball tournament   During time Nathan's only place open inside there   Suffice say very busy those 3 days   Their hot dogs french fries lemonade okay   Prices bit steep but expected inside Convention center   Overall bad place eat when here  <EOR>
