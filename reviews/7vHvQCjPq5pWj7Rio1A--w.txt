Service okay except constantly forget orders did really forget over over over? flag them down many times remind them over over again  Still three stars because A OK despite fact don't think place like many other AYCE sushi places run real Japanese people  <EOR> More fusion style sushi  The dishes look good but used over sauce covered other flavor sushi itself    Like another Yelper wrote quality fish itself great  <EOR> Another gem close work  think favorite because food phenomenal size great list sushi also seasonal treats does busy but wait  see kids parties bar area always happy  advice? stay away casinos resorts say all eat list short  place great date place  <EOR> My mother decided try lunch gal CVS told it  close where she lives  staff very friendly attentive  mother Sweet Heart roll which she very happy with  all eat boy did eat! started Red Dragon Roll   very good whatever special house sauce perfect combination   Then Veggie Royal ? cooked tempura batter cucumber avacado carrots beets cream cheese eel sauce  OMG best veggie roll ever tried many! roll alone coming back often  then Spivey garlic tuna yellowtail halibut  both enjoyed vanilla tempura ice cream dessert  Yum large portion neither thought could possibly finish   but savored every last bite  enjoy  very glad did <EOR> I wish could give half stars because would give 4 1 2  royal veggie cucumber which both fantastic!

Going any restaurant first month since being open always little worriesome because there's many kinks work out  However hearing many friends coworkers sushi absolutely great trip out  dining room isn't terribly large maybe seats 30 inside but there's large outdoor patio which could see myself sitting during cooler months vegas  However sushi bar itself seats 12 when arrived lunch being open only few weeks surprised but happy see half sushi bar already taken few tables dispersed throughout    Looking over menu prices weren't bad all good lunch roll specials  hot foods menu very limited but roll list more it  chef recommended Blue Fin Roll' die for! tried couple other rolls well some sushi tuna poke salad yum!    All fish extremely fresh well cut  Most importantly flavors clean well balanced  Something appreciated most  Service ok waitress's first day work nothing I'd hold them against  sushi chefs extremely friendly quick   Now here's thing    land all u can eat sushi bar town don't it  But probably ended being cheaper all u can eat because rolls big even cancel couple more wanted try knowing no way bf could finish them and we're big eaters begin with! quality fish greatly surpassed most sushi restaurants town    If appreciated great fish flavors highly recommend place!

We did AYCE don't recall everything tried but some highlights Ahi Tuna Salad first thing tried surprised delicate texture tuna combined crisp cucumber  Off good start    Rock n Roll favorite roll probably because some sort mayo rice which both cheat list usually  all wrapped cucumber  If wasn't dieting would ordered more  roll fantasize most    Spider Roll Crunchy goodness  Nuff said    Teriyaki Chicken Hands down best had  moist overwhelmingly sweet greasy  perfect option those non sushi eaters FYI wrong team! Lastly sashimi     OMG  chef sent over special because eats often  yellowtail simply drizzled truffle oil melted butter tongue  when Blue Fin moment      until then everyone table watching nonfish girl eat fish trying graceful chewing etc    now  wanted eat hands Animal Muppets  Animal sushi!!!!

We always lookout great AYCE sushi we're bigger fans fish itself rolls   Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed quality fish   First off Blue Fin small restaurant more mom pop's place   almost better keep place down low because would hate wait seat here   Our party three plus toddler AYCE dinner option $25 95 pp     First off uni limit order per person dinner only   Because weather California did shipment   Oh   Would willing give extra order amaebi then?  Yes   Sweet!  when arrived looked just fabulous tasted good too!  We work ordering bunch nigiri pleasantly surprised came out   More often AYCE sushi places just shove many pieces plate can   But actually presented quite nicely which appreciated   especially impressed super white tuna which am certain escolar  Super white tuna usually means albacore escolar definitely highlight! Their version ikura bit different actually seemed made themselves since eggs didn't separate still within sac if any sense   Another highlight spicy rolls fan Sriracha based kind mayo based   Yum!  We also really enjoyed Soft Shell Crab Tempura limit order per person dinner only    nice batter definitely tasty!  The Husband ordered Grilled Yellowtail Collar limit order per person dinner only but hoped forgotten since he getting full   When did arrive huge piece!  looked equivalent two collars usually served other restaurants!  Another highlight unlimited dessert! Green tea red bean ice cream mochi ice cream tempura ice cream available   tempura ice cream huge scoop surprised generous was   Service did take bit long good while more hour time limit   But only only waitress restaurant definitely filled max while there   case didn't mind but if just two might gotten bit anxious   Overall Blue Fin Sushi place would recommend good quality sushi   can't comment fancy rolls but liked ate would definitely back!  There outdoor tables but sure open them when weather gets better not   Lunch 11 00 am 3 00 pm $21 95 pp Dinner 3 00 pm 11 00 pm $25 95 pp 60 minute limit  Update! 05 12 10 back return visit both pleased experience there   Only handful customers sitting sushi bar  where chose sit well   Ordered bunch nigiri uni time well   soft shell crab served nice bed salad greens sauce time which wasn't problem since asked no sauce next time   Overall took time within hour   didn't disappoint quality all  <EOR> Waited 2 hours didn't into sushi mon called place right away  ordered big order great service first but turn services started wane longer busy  sushi pretty good Ayce decently priced around 25 bucks  would back again  <EOR> There lot all you can eat sushi choices Las Vegas but best if best!

But shock horrible food was   From remembered ordered baked mussels  ok cool little plates rather shell  chewing mussels vomit  NO joke exaggeration  starters mussels hot enough  baked long enough chewing cold mussels   We decided ignore try other dishes   We ordered Ahi poke salad must admit really good spicy different all ahi poke salads tasted  friend enjoyed well   Then ordered Shumai Ehhh ok nothing good   Shumai shumai all taste same all sushi places    I decided order crab cakes since seen crab cakes menu sushi place  disappointed  crab cakes cold tasted old sitting back awhile   no joke   Decided ignore well came ultimate test  Nigiri Sushi   So remember ordered salmon nigiri  just ok  temperature right cold rice weird old  give them props least texture good no veins all Nigiri   Same tuna nigiri all other nigiri had   The sushi rolls ok kinda sucks didnt half rolls usually order half rolls sure sushi   Also during lunch time didn't Uni sea urchin lunch 22$ dinner 26$ something that   difference 4$ does difference 4$ just add sea urchin all other stuff included lunch  dinner menu   Overall wasn't fond place  wouldn't mind giving try during dinner time maybe dinner much better lunch   Service great waitress top everything cooks greet when come thank when leave   I would give try again since total shock ratings place maybe just caught place bad day  <EOR> Love place! bestfriend regulars  always AYCE  Haven't come across anything menu didn't like  half rolls throughout desserts also AYCE  only gave 4 stars because service isn't consistent  prefer dinner shift because servers bussers more friendly  Ask Bernie! He's awesome  <EOR> I don't writing bad reviews but far worst experiences out  lunch kids impressed all unfortunately  sat table no settings ask every little thing because server didn't feel need own without asking  Made feel bother which definitely don't doing  she brought few plates keep asking chopsticks napkins soy sauce ginger wasabi bc she kept forgetting  Smh   The quality fish ok but Uni Ikura tasted funny  weird sweet taste which didn't like  Udon salty too   So midway into meal realized some orders didn't come actually ask 2 3 times if still coming  Apparently she forgot put in  end still never some orders son's spider roll said forget it  She horrible server  She later disappeared nowhere found  If wasn't other guy very nice attentive bringing needed taking over would've made complaint which NEVER do  feel bad because can't remember name think maybe Omar Carlos? He only guy maybe mexican  Credit great service hers  <EOR> Gotta love AYCE sushi   Sure its super fresh air flown fish   Dare say its seen inside freezer but offering lot creativity big taste bargain   around $25 Blue Fin exceptional value   Multiple visits   Sometimes ordering just single roll other times AYCE really put place test   Since everyone favorites Ill simply generalizations Shrimp tempura rolls shrimp would expect   little oily overcooked chewy shrimp works really well roll  Unagi Decent quality perfectly broiled very tasty sauce   Usually served outside roll its sauce adds entire sushi  Soft shell crab Previously frozen but deep fried oily but crispy goodness   Just shrimp little oil sushi good thing  Spicy mayo for scallop tuna Spicy sure really good  All rolls beautifully made look incredible plate   Best all taste great!

Sunshine Coffee where number hungry Yelpers decided AYCE sushi kickoff ended   didn't know expect but heard sushi best city   did disappoint!  I love Miso Soup even though filling ordered bowl pleased hear considered part AYCE here   fact unlike some savvy tablemates did realize until read Holly C 's review event unlimited desserts included well   But stomach hardly room anyway finished refreshing Mango Mochi meal's end     I didn't count them but table likely consumed close 20 rolls before split plus few other odds ends Raw Tuna Poki Salad Calamari Tempura   positioned myself next Tony T  someone translate offerings describe ingredients each foreign batch arrived   Miso Soup good but overly salty   Ahi Tuna smooth cool richly flavored   Rainbow Roll excellent Tokyo Express contained mixture tuna salmon each large cut roll piece   Italian Special good creamy   even liked Crazy Yum Yum time but awhile very mayonnaisey Holly's word sauce became cloying   Tubiko found just taste okay but red green fish eggs certainly pretty helped usher Christmas holiday spirit first day December   many avocado lovers know avocado vary consistency color taste depending ripe is   every roll included slice avocado offered non stop delicious bites  perfectly ripe green avocado entwined raw fish   Cool tasty every time!    I didn't love but found Salmon Roe better tasting Flying Fish Eggs   Calamari Tempura different Calamari Fritti but good more subdued way   tried stretch beyond sushi safe mild California Roll which no ordered succeeded degree but found still limits would put mouth   regarded Amaebi sweet shrimp fried heads quite skeptically although shrimp part dish glistened beckoned developed slight interest it   being coaxed Tony T  Lisa L  try weird looking dish finally acquiesced halfway chewed raw shrimp   Surprisingly found tasty somewhat creamy texture   But stopped there   yet ready fried shrimp heads     My stomach also turned faced dish featured quail egg nestled next looked brown brains   continued only look let fellow diners enjoy whatever sushi beast was   When almost full realized forgotten order favorite sushi Spicy Tuna Roll   piggishly over order leave anything behind asked received half order Spicy Tuna Roll   spicy recall previously experiencing Spicy Tuna Roll point nostrils felt smoking modulate spice bite much milder Caterpillar Roll before launched again more bites super spicy roll   did finish all eventually   I believe everyone present good time   did converse but almost exclusively wonderful sushi spread before kept coming coming until called off   all principally eat did! <EOR> Tried AYCE first time last week friend  Trying new sushi place always scary but Blue Fin didn't disappoint!
