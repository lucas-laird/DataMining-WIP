smoky flavor Kobe steak skewer wasabi delicious tender Chicken stuffed mushroom flavorful yum Agedashi tofu amazingly savory broth salmon eggs   Warning skewers add quickly before know you've eaten 20 skewers   Your wallet's empty but your belly's full happy  <EOR> We waited hour table  Then waited waited dishes come  told 2 hours handful skewers four dishes  excellent food would back sure   It's kind izakaya but really since more upscale service painfully slow serve dish wouldn't Japanese izakaya   We 9 30 without reservation  host said he could seat 30 minutes told would Sweets Raku next door dessert first  seemed good plan but then he called 10 minutes started eating first dessert course say table really missed opportunity since could abandon food Sweet Raku   We back Raku 10 30 waited table waited waited once past 30 minutes should left but became game see just when would table  11 30 when seated 1 45am when finished  service incredibly slow  first 45 minutes only three dishes one every 15 minutes  Izakayas Japan North America know ones North America very different far more upscale slow common ones Japan  Usually if spend much time Japan because lots drinking lots food  But food food good enough would back would recommend diner time spare  foie gras chawanmushi awesome  special grilled langoustines wasn't over cooked served whole  yellowtail carpaccio well grilled yellowtail good  don't know if tofu freshest ever but really excellent terms texture  cost pretty reasonable 100 dollars two people without alcohol  mixed orders twice  Towards end table regulars came served immediately 6 dishes less 30 minutes meanwhile two tables reservations wait waited quite bit  don't expect fair quick service  wouldn't recommend Raku vegetarian many vegetable dishes fish stock other animal products prep  wheelchair accessible but well designed it  wasn't noisy lighting decent  <EOR> Small plates but really really good   Homemade tofu simply amazing   Truly based tofu ever had    Other plates would also highly recommend  <EOR> Definitely best Vegas offer  Never anything less delicious here  always some foie gras when come  <EOR> I thought long hard but still could come right words Raku justice  kaiseki best meals had  Everything meticulously flawless beginning till end  single dish beyond impressive  more just food  art    Among  limited exposure Japanese kaiseki other haute cuisine Raku offered most humble yet most exquisite experience  presentation formal but atmosphere quite casual  dined two back rooms small restaurant  Exclusive but totally isolated lively robata gill ambiance  three hour dinner feast sensory mind truly memorable affair    Advanced reservation kaiseki must  reservation process almost ridiculous  need provide your credit card number time your phone call  then email terms conditions which must accept your reservation canceled  call day before your reservation sure still planning keep your reservation then remind again same day  don't think confirm many times even famous Michelin starred restaurants  Oh yes don't late because won't hesitate give away your table  also best place enjoy good conversation dinner because reservations lined reminded politely overstay  bit pain but totally worth it  <EOR> For ultimate Japanese fancy izakaya experience me  aware if dontt deep pocket doesnt delectable taste Japanese food but even bother    tried most food menu while here  stand most Wagyu fresh wasabi Foe gras uni some kind very sticky grated vegetable ikura  Honestly must place if Vegas dont wanna spend expensive trashy food stripe Vegas  def try omakase next time when am   <EOR> Terrible service party five did reservation but when walk table four open waitress would only let three sit table  She wouldn't let add chair all five could fit  Also five seats row bar again waitress still only let two sit asked multiple times table open unreserved  no other way but leave place  attitude waitress extremely arrogant rude  looking forward food disappointed service  What's wrong restaurant? <EOR> Yellowtail carpaccio amazing  Waygu beef done quite rare bit chewy  <EOR> The chefs today may well Van Goghs time  care precision modern food presentation made some creations plates incredible edible works art   The Japanese art food presentation imbued food culture really put heart soul into making food feast eyes well stomach   On visit Las Vegas last September starting feel bit jaded eating big corporate named restaurants strip sought dinner spot more keeping being locals' favourite  Yelp search threw Raku quick check local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed favourite spots town   I especially drawn kaiseki menu where create unique menu based best ingredients available day  quick phone call secured  dinner reservation requested website pre ordered kaiseki menu   My taxi dropped outside Raku which located non descipt small off Strip mall  Any initial fears unprepossessing surroundings soon dispelled warm welcome received entering restaurant  general hubbub conviviality restaurant all evening many customers obviously being happy regulars   I bagged seat favourite place sit restaurant counter watching chefs work  able chat main chef all evening very happy engage explain things unfolding gastronomic adventure   Every dish work art quite few new flavours palate savour   1  Mountain potato croquettes dashi broth  2  Eight mini treasures including creations such tofu skin wasabi egg sashimi  3  house signature homemade silken tofu salmon roe homemade green tea salt soya sauce  4  Fluke sashimi liver spring radish grated onion dipped ponzu sauce  5  Japanese Spanish mackarel marinated yuzu  6  Foie gras egg custard summer truffle served egg shell  7  Eel shisho pepper  8  Uni egg  9  Kobe beef hot rock flamed Hennessy XO sauce  10  Mixed tuna over rice  11  Panna cota  As see list ingredients best ingredients pass one's lips  Everything delight eat    love way Japanese cookery given exquisite food presentation west but return given them ingredients foie gras cook with   Service always smile all evening   The final touch class came end meal when chef confessed normally don't kaiseki menu only person due large amount prep time involved but visiting London made exception   Arigato Aburiya Raku! <EOR> Sorry Kaiseki dinner great experience   The service excruciatingly slow   served course which bite some cases then we'd wait 10 15 minutes    not good 15 course dinner   some point asked them pick pace which didn't really help    It ridiculous   That said many dishes fantastic   Two tofu dishes great   soups great   panko encrusted asparagus great   My wife 3 months prior great dinner just ordering off menu   I also WOULD CALL KAISEKI   More chef's selection   3 stars because protracted length dinner indifferent service  <EOR> One best Yakitori places recent years   The Lamb chops kobe beef filet wasabi foie gras steam custard chawamushi beef tendon must items  best thing dishes weren't overcooked most other places charcoal wood definitely imparts nice char smell  most items ordered came medium rare moist just melting your mouth  Aside yakatori dishes daily specials grilled fried served sashimi  house made tofu also very silky unique  some sashimi dishes also excellent  Definitely can't wait come back try other dishes  <EOR> Raku delicious beautiful food  best tofu ever  can't wait back <EOR> Service excellent  Food good but impressive  Price overpriced  We wandered into Sweet Raku last night   We great experience decided give restaurant try   Server suggest premium omakase   Nothing really stand throughout course   Feel just any regular established Japanese restaurant   Don't think omakase worth $100 per person  <EOR> We enjoyed dining Raku   food delicious service great   ordered 2 specials Wagyu beef sukiyaki grilled flounder   beef tender juicy probably best sukiyaki ever had   flounder grilled just right lots flavor   already some grilled items including chicken wings beef liver   both really good very authentic     The only thing strange order which food came out   grilled chicken wing came first main course grilled flounder right then miso soup   Sukiyaki came long long time beef liver agedashi tofu very end     The wait food super long but quality food authenticity food excellent  <EOR> A short taxi ride off strip worth trip   We seated private room which nice made evening feel special  strange service first end slow but once food ordered kept coming   We needed servers help walk through menu descriptions sparse  probably ordered over 10 items cold hot dishes  Take look all pictures night  few highlights cold tofu bacon wrapped tomatoes salad chicken peanut sauce name few  only item didn't care pork cheek  expecting tender meat but square fat  When you're ready check need them call cab don't drive around strip  But again worth short ride  <EOR> MY FAVORITE PLACE EAT VEGAS!!!  everything wonderful but stand dishes can't find and or good elsewhere * 1 2 order raku's tofu + 1 2 order agedashi tofu * Poached Egg Sea Urchin Salmon Roe * Kobe Beef Outside Skirt Garlic * Kurobuta Pork Cheek * Iberico Pork  * Duck Balsamic Soy Sauce  * Foie Gras Glazed Soy base Sauce * Udon Noodle Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup * sake kamameshi salmon ikura iron pot rice   tips * don't turn away

restaurant  matter fact didn't any sushi menu but extremely pleasant surprise   We started Age Dashi Tofu which told made home made tofu  broth sweet flavorful roe added complimentary saltiness  am normally huge fan Tofu but never prepared quite this  then moved lamb chops which smokey delicious  little chewy but lamb tends be   We then sashimi plate special menu life remember name looked through all pictures did see it  extremely thin sliced sashimi presented large plate somewhat Fugu  paired tasted tomato wasabi paste when mixed special ponzu sauce combined flavor experience f world   We also serving Raw Beef Tatake which topped dollop ginger garlic small amount cavier  YUMO  may least favorite dish but still awesome    Then came Kalkimachi Asparagus  Oh god hot crispy hint bacon flavor AMAZING   Our last dish ground chicken portobello which also delicious  But then pretty full taste buds overload except desert   My Buddy decided sample two deserts Green Tea Brule Brown Sugar Bubbly Pudding  say  two deserts capped culinary experience only unexpected but completely unforgettable    My understanding cant reservation weekend should plan ahead    I recommend place enough  <EOR> I three sake samplers   end meal feeling quite contented   wish able choose which sakes each grouping still interesting sample different flavors nuances each one     The skewered chicken thigh delicious green tea salt   LOVED aga dashi tofu!  don't even tofu but totally downed half   skewered duck flavorful though little tough   white fish sashimi fabulous some tuna sashimi very nice   enoki mushrooms wrapped bacon awesome texture combination   think also ordered some kind skewered beef but neither thought anything much it     For dessert green tea creme brulee   interesting but tasted mostly regular creme brulee green tea ice cream top   would most definitely return try more things menu  <EOR> I came family dinner because heard great things place  wait promptly 45 minutes which wasn't bad since plenty places explore while waiting  ordered many different dishes wasn't disappointed all quality food  prices also very reasonable taste quality  Sadly give star less because

Basically still hungry leaving place  wish chef asked interested eating would've told him    food flavor! hear place great dinner though come back date give try! If first don't succeed! <EOR> I only statement The tofu puts even pork belly shame  Cream cheese cowers front tofu  Foie gras respects bows tofu   And  all gotta say that! <EOR> Everything Raku spectacular   Tried sample lot different things executed every single one   started sashimi salad which really fresh delicious fish nice spicy miso could mix perfect level spice   Next Yellowtail carpaccio also fantastic   Next butter scallop cooked shell which might favorite scallop ever had   Cooked perfectly great flavor texture   Next gizzard yakitori which amazing charcoal flavor as did all yakitori    still good but probably least favorite dish night   Then crispy chicken like roulade delicious    Perfectly fried outside juicy inside   Next kurobuta pork cheek yakitori which great blend charcoal savory fat flavor   Then duck yakitori which favorite dishes night   Cooked perfectly nice soy based glaze packed ton flavor   Then agedashi tofu which even though huge tofu fan pretty spectacular   would definitely order again   last but least pork belly which while amazing every sense word finished off because rich    japanese mustard top nice tough though helped cut richness just bit     So yeah     food     amazing   Just go     The service also very nice inside small intimate but crowded   place deserves rave reviews gets sure call early reservation  <EOR> Was Vegas SEMA week well let's face nice stay strip sometimes nicer away it   tucked away Chinatown strip malls Spring Mountain   Unassuming best nestled corner across smoke shop   Definitely call ahead reservations   called fully booked but said could come down try   don't turn away Walk ins long you're willing wait hour seated   I really came foie gras mind   missed rich indulgent fatty little bastard   off robata grill no less   Everything came off wonderful charcoal taste you'll burping later remind awesome your meal was   My favorites enjoyed few bottles Ginga Kogen Foie Gras Glazed Soy base Sauce Foie Gras Don Kobe Beef Tendon Poached Egg Sea Urchin Salmon Roe Kobe Beef Fillet Wasabi Scallops served sashimi style daily special I only really disappointed Yellowtail came bit dry overcooked   All all favorite places now Vegas   Although if feenin foie gras would definitely hit another favorite spot down street Ichiza some more traditional izakaya   Might bad idea come when hungry total damage tax tip drinks came $115 per  <EOR> I usually don't write any reviews however Raku really disappointed time  biggest promoter Raku ever since its opening  family usually family functions restaurant when friend living Japan many years recently moved UK came visit decided take friends most authentic Japanese restaurant Vegas   I never disappointed customer service guy manager  He never smiled only gave yes resounding no only nodding answers even when asked recommendations special menu  Working customer service understand people bad day seeing friend already frowning service getting tried lighten mood trying some small talks your restaurant looked busy tonight  manager only rolled eyes fixed attention back floor    Having lived Japan loyal customer Raku past many years admit higher expectations Raku any regular restaurants  However time Raku really let down  Even friend first time restaurant commenting customer service even par any Japanese restaurants he would expect   Another example when asked special menu he disappeared whole ten minutes when he came back he slammed blackboard table very impatiently listed items menu  without explaining were  When asked fork knife he did even acknowledge remind twice before he came back them  time dish already cold under AC    I felt such inconvenience manager instead enjoying meal friend haven't seen years  things even worse saw manager laughing proactively introducing menu Specials taking care drinks refills another table customers  only felt being appreciated customer but also discriminated nothing   I don't think Raku dined tonight same restaurant Endo San envisioned  Both friends appalled gentleman put charge manager spot  While he expected teach other servers deliver amazing meal customers he did completely opposite ruined night  sincerely recommend look job outside customer service hospitality  <EOR> Really good food but terrible service  first portion within 5 minutes order  But next dish didn't come until another 45 min  Thinking party next door may gotten rest order  Amazing food though which overtakes terrible service  <EOR> Raku those Vegas exclusive dining experiences every local least once  lived nearly year half finally found occasion worthy family dinner Raku    Appetizers Raku's Tofu worth least trying great silky texture Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi there's no getting around strong liver taste everyone  roasted garlic chips add flavor texture  Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard great dish minimal foie but still very enjoyable  also some roe hadn't expected  Poached Egg Sea Urchin Salmon Roe dish wasn't all  poached eggs urchin roe but didn't come together egg closer raw poached  Juicy Deep Fried Chicken incredible introduction wonderful chicken dishes Raku's kitchen puts even spinach garnish delicious  Rice Noodle Grilled Rice Ball Broth Salmon Great pick  Light broth tasted more tea due steeped seaweed dish  Rice retains grilled texture despite being soaked broth  Salmon surcharge $3 but piece fish size thumb nail didn't contribute anything flavor   Robata Chicken Thigh Chicken Breast Wrapped Chicken Skin chicken robata dishes favorites smoky grilled taste juicy beyond belief Kobe Beef Filet Wasabi beef good but fan wasabi kind ruined me Kobe Beef Tendon nope  happening  adventurous me  Pork Ear Tasty lots texture  Server recommends spicy table sauce which basically punch straight pepper  I'd recommend without  Duck Balsamic Soy Sauce Ordered two knowing I'd love did  Lacked gamey taste turns lot people off duck  Good choice  Tomato Bacon Mushroom Bacon generally bacon fan but adding veggie into mix somehow does me    Dessert Fluffy Cheesecake dessert fan found bit cheesy but when raspberry filling? Oh man all bets off    Above meal under $200 carafe Ashahi $30 tip enough three share happily  Service just okay polite professional but detached didn't connection any recommendations even when mentioned first visit  sure take least trip bathroom beautiful   We made reservations few days advance staff awesome calling back when unable pick up  Reservations secure your table 15 minutes show time! table 2 hours  Toward end night 11PM? people able walk in bar seats  <EOR> They dirty rate c demerts services good food good price high  <EOR> I already can't wait come back next time try full omakase!

Low behold  tonight    made reservation 8 30pm networking event   booked but gave counter over phone     We arrived 30 minutes early hoping could work way in   sent bar first   bar just  walnut natural wood bar   But no bartender booze there   just wait until time while propping your elbow walnut   Luckily didn't wait long otherwise non bar bar would made mad!    Plus seated REAL table not counter    Usually would prefer counter a la sushi bar but just counter without action watch   think only main advantage counter socialize other diners which might add all seem really cool smart people  rare find many location Vegas!    We didn't know order but took few recommendations other YELP reviews   can't remember intricate names each  but here's layman's descriptions highlights hot asparagus crunchy coating my favorite thing EVER   Economical AWESOME   Blue Fin sashimi pricey special $25 but some best sashimi ever had Agedashi Tofu it really amazing almost dessert like treat savory broth Yellowtail skewers   usually think shame cook yellowtail but didn't feel way time around  Butter scallop okay but special other items  Green tea creme brulee   BOMB   great finish evening   I thought all reviews hype happy say wrong   Every moment spent dining Raku made better person   talk experience nonstop peers   If Japanese food NEED yourself better person  <EOR> Make sure time eat takes while food come out  could eat Kobe beef fresh wasabi all day  agedashi tofu excellent even fiancé doesn't really tofu really enjoyed it  back next time Vegas! <EOR> Where start? Should begin atmosphere warm service delicious food?    Because  all here  such good combination   The meal started agedashi tofu which then split into two halves  the original agedashi tofu hot cold tofu traditionally served green tea salt homemade soy sauce ginger per waitress' recommendation  loved agedashi tofu the warm sweet sauce sits in  yum! but thought cold tofu tasted better much more enjoyable eat being able sprinkle green tea sea salt garnish seaweed stuff  Nonetheless solid appetizer way definitely recommend!  Our list other selects Iberico pork enoki mushroom wrapped bacon asparagus wrapped bacon kobe beef outside skirt garlic duck balsamic soy sauce butter sautéed scallop soy sauce tsukune grilled ground chicken   Everything tasted delicious but ones stood were Iberico pork HOLY COW ask yourself really think hard pork belly any better? Right? Pork belly anything anywhere delicious    but Spain organic pork belly    don't know man wondrous  Juicy tender just right amount fat meat  Careful though $10 skewer ordered four without knowing! Enoki mushroom bacon again another solid dish find anywhere but bacon such smokey flavor brings best enoki better ones you've tried anywhere else  must order  Butter sautéed scallop FAVORITE!! Ugh die  Sauteed PERFECTION just enough raw ness center    doused double doused probably insanely mouthwatering but not overwhelming garlic butter sauce  order two pieces scallop = $7  Pricey but worth think    Duck balsamic soy sauce really good dish even non duck lovers  Tender juicy flavorful  Balsamic soy sauce adds nice dimension it  Recommended! <EOR> OMG    hate myself    lived 8 years! tonight first time   place definitely places wanted when first moved here  well jumping bandwagon saying boooooomb  definitely must try when Vegas local  some things poached egg uni salmon roe kurabota pork belly kurabota pork cheek my fave all buttery scallop skirt steak garlic filet  omg everything amazing  gonna come back every chance try other  servers nice clean interior  back soon! <EOR> Traditional Izakaya style  Great sake selection  Japanese chefs staff  guys know doing  Truly outstanding! agedashi tofu best ever had  Shima aji inada also fantastic  <EOR> They own tofu  doesnt any better that    This Vegas sushi no where compare! food innovative fun atmosphere service excellent  first many experiences raku sake tasting which extremely affordable under $100 two people drinks all  Food delicious very filling    Came next Vegas adventure voila another tasting! good timing guess   Third visit lucky but ordering la carte where fun at! grilled food best ever find anywhere tender perfectly executed  Desserts good except better places especially strip but come food    Relatively innexpensive food good sake VEGAS! <EOR> Unexpectedly impressed!  come back tomorrow heartbeat!

We did 10 course tasting menu while added couple items myself  Everything good but top items night     House Tofu Don't even compare your grocery store bought tofu  light fresh served green onions bonito flakes soy sauce  Also house specialty feel waste try it!  Blue Fin Tuna Okay confess  didn't actually this  everything else sashimi platter but boys would shut mouths blue fin tuna next few days  if available order it  other fish very fresh   Pork Iberico juicy flavorful! If fatty pork definitely order this  also ordered pork cheek but Iberico far better   Kobe Beef Skirt Steak yummy    served tiny garlic crisps top  Some best skirt steak life  very tender thick sweet sauce    Foie Gras stuff melts your mouth  rich could just feel arteries tightening  But still deliciously worth it  small medallion but should probably share others though won't want to     Everyone served kind knowledgeable very patient while debated heatedly over order most experience  Expect spend more $50 per person satisfied most dishes small  highly recommend tasting menus first timer   The decor nice but just case wondering restroom those high tech Japanese multi function toilets  knew any buttons but wouldn't surprised if could use print something  Plus there's AQUARIUM!

Service excellent although REALLY wish spoke clearer English if maybe pictures menu something better communicate actually eating  food excellent across board but cant really tell ate  ordered $100 tasting menu just kept coming even telling 3x serving could understand saying menu wasn't helpful either  knows ate chef's tasting menu but all delicious certainly memorable  Would MORE memorable if knew ate all    So restaurant great ambience great food memorable selection  Three three scale  only two problems dessert price  having such amazing food throughout tasting menu which takes 2 hours way     another small gripe served looked tasted orange popsicle dessert? Really? $200+ meal crushed popsicle orange? seemed surprised did     if everyone wants popsicle dessert  Bizarre  Maybe desserts good but tasting menu did give much choice  may seem small thing but when spend kind money off strip your standards way high just real sour note whole meal    Secondly price  actually end day think tasting menu worth money  problem off strip Chinatown  hard feel good shelling much money again  Maybe way back order la carte cheaper don't know  But overall think just tad bit expensive massively expensive if consider Chinatown most affordable places eat all Las Vegas  <EOR> LOVE PLACE    I going years unfortunately become Huge success  book reservations weeks !!

AMAZEBALLS   On service! hell raku! made 4 separate reservations 4 separate parties all under different names  3 parties seated time scheduled  Ours only problem  Apparently manager took reservations heard reservations 4 tables but only capacity write down 3 reservations  Walking into restaurant night reservation all excited because greatness Raku  walked hostess podium said reservation name many  hostess then tell no reservation under name  other three tables already seated     reservation written down when all 4 reservations given during same telephone conversation     ? Uh Duh  course tension quickly grew  hostess continued look paper saying no such reservation  Obviously someone forgot write down  Ever think that? manager came said he took down reservation  All going through mind you're dumbass couldn't write down four reservations he kept telling no reservation looking paper  Seriously does no raku understand situation now what?! Eventually guy redeems himself gives table  However he ends separating table half end sitting bar where guests wait      Overall If wasn't misunderstanding would love raku bits  food amazing but people need learn some people skills take multiple reservations within call two  coming back  Don't fuck time raku  Thanks  <EOR> This review 4 5 stars    I heard Raku place all local chefs cooking enjoy quality meal exceptional chef reasonable prices  also heard specials board which usually must order off of    We sample 7 dishes try many different creations possible  standouts agedashe tofu chicken skewers tuna special  Each dish came another overwhelm give chance experience each its own  When delivered waiter would explain dish offer insight into properly eat meal which sauces use    Overall greatly enjoyed meal  would always recommend off strip quality food Las Vegas just because cheaper but because local flavor comfort  Raku great recommendation truly quality meal Chinatown shopping center where enjoy your meal good price  <EOR> What more said place holds 4 5 stars 900+ reviews at moment posting ?

The staff greet chorus when enter when leave which nice touch  <EOR> The omakase quality good some top restaurants  If want some authentic Japanese place go  Still can't believe Vegas  <EOR> What honestly say Raku probably hasn't already said? food elegant well executed though some dishes less outstanding flavor overall  service pleasant though pacing night difficult  couldn't reservation night but showed opening seated bar really bad deal because watch chefs motion   While sampled many dishes main hits misses     By far most unique pleasant flavor evening Udon Noodle Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup Extremely rich flavorful unique style it  Thin cold udon noodles weren't exactly favorite idea actually felt warm noodle soup would fine  But still amazing depth flavor dish unique presentation top it   The Hamachi Kama huge piece fish collar ton flavor very tender  also great value being priced under 20 dollars amount fish actual plate   The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi something really tried whim really kind unique slimy but incredibly smooth texture wasn't sure loved flavor but special salt table side really helped enhance already there  unique but doubt I'd try again   While Kobe Beef Outside Skirt Garlic really good didn't really enjoy fillet wasabi lean wasabi overwhelmed flavor  Tsukune Grilled Ground Chicken bit disappointment well similar Kyara no better nor any different  duck lamb each average duck good texture but didn't care presentation overall flavor  lamb marinated which really covers flavor lamb because apple marinade came rather sweet   One highlights evening dessert fluffy cheese cake which texture closer cloud rather heavy cheese cake typical  sweetness muted well but still absolutely delicious   Unfortunately felt service little less stellar because pacing dishes rather iffy  appetizers waited 20 minutes Hamachi Kama then suddenly all grilled items coming faster could eat   Still some very memorable bites food think back upon while  pricey but definitely astronomical any means  <EOR> Disappointed  such high hopes Raku  service staff super nice but food boring frankly kind bland  way expensive  $24 langoustine  Enough said  many great restaurants Las Vegas really don't know why place gets such high praise  Trendy guess  <EOR> Long overdue update iits well over year since dined here  This time instead sit down dining full menu more cocktail reception with signature bites bottomless sake asahi 4 hours straight!

Overall flavor almost didn't think greatest  <EOR> Was Raku Las Vegas last night  did appreciate restaurant could merit accolades received but then again its opinion   Overall good service prompt courteous   great selection off menu but nothing moved doubtful return   If want try Japanese Grill experience worth going   party three no said would return nothing memorable   last thing if order off Chef's special menu surprised bill prices listed  some sashimi which ok but $20 00 better  <EOR> This location further away LV strip  Based Chinatown  pretty empty when arrived 11pm Monday  Customer service excellent  man serving very accommodating explaining dishes very detailed  Each dish small portion some people expensive  think portion size great because able try different types dishes have  Taste really good but eventually tiring eat  flavoring almost similar each other because creaminess    Must try tofu poached egg uni fish roe  Those two dishes left big impact taste buds  other dishes ordered don't really remember much    P S restroom fucking nice <EOR> My love affair Agedashi Tofu began here  Now order delicious soupy tofu dish almost every time eat Japanese but never good Raku's  Raku known its homemade tofu if sure order form another  There's cold tofu appetizer plate comes tomatoes really small shrimp I know! but can't remember name it  while   I eaten several times over years last time three best girlfriends visitors Vegas loved atmosphere food  great place eat talk drink  hear each other  Raku small intimate completely focused quality    Order anything amazed! <EOR> What great place! off strip location but highly recommend place if looking nice Izakaya type place reasonable price  Sashimi salad Sea food chawanmushi enoki mushrooms home made tofu incredibly good  <EOR> Love food ambience! wait hour seated but totally worth it! <EOR> This place hard find since Raku Sweets place only Raku sign instead Raku Sweets  decor seems outdated lackluster ambiance  tried most expensive omakase  Most dishes good but tofu steamed foie gras custard delicious  poached egg sea urchin mountain yam salmon roe tasted ok big fan mountain yam  sashimi course only very common selections offered nothing interesting fish quality good top sushi sashimi places NYC  meatball course kind heavy did taste very good  fluffy cheesecake bit disappointing kind bland  probably better idea just order la carte instead trying omakase  <EOR> Raku fantastic restaurant tucked away average looking stripmall    We started off fried asparagus fried ice fish which pretty standard  brother pork ribs which tasted marinated soy sauce tender  duck skewers which also delicious    There two items really blew away rice broth plum green tea crème brûlée  Highly recommend these    Whether want ball chef's table simply some amazing Japanese food Raku worth going off strip for  <EOR> Raku far exceeded expectations definitely added list favorite restaurants Vegas area!  My friend Christina T  recommended Raku years because she known frequented Vegas quite often   Unfortunately Raku off strip super convenient if transportation but far off depending where staying   Sure place may match glitz glamor places strip Raku definitely hides some great foodie gems   I would highly recommend getting reservations if want sure seat   tried reservations week before but told only available seats 10 30!  sure friend could seats wait restaurant open thirty minutes before opening   When first arrived just group ahead but soon growing line people     Instead poring over menu friend ordered premium omakase which ended being eleven plates chosen best sampling restaurant offer   If money spare hungry would highly recommend this!  HIGHLIGHTS Raku's tofu silky smooth fresh tofu few embellishments lightly flavor  Butter Sautéed scallop rarely scallop but good!  natural butteriness scallop cooked nice consistency  Fried whole fish dashi nice sized fish fried nestled warm soy sauce broth  Kobe beef filet skewer wasabi meaty beef skewer signature fattiness Kobe beef matches well heat wasabi  Green tea creme brûlée far favorite desserts long time!  am fan green tea execution creme brûlée superb   just wished could continue scooping forever   MEH Foie gras don Overhyped because laid thick sweet syrupy sauce   good amount foie but couldn't past sauce   Nice concept though   Parking little difficult find very packed plaza!  Luckily found parking spot but may find parking elsewhere walk over   Service pretty spot on   Overall Raku provides great high quality Japanese cuisine definitely worth leaving Vegas strip  <EOR> I am able comment food because husband rudely turned away hour before restaurant due close   If hours operation until 3 00 am expect able eat restaurant 2 05   The waiters bringing hot food kitchen front us could seated said please order fairly quickly because closing kitchen soon   We very disappointed  never restaurant would refuse sit customer hour before closing time  <EOR> Wonderful!  wrong eating location    Sometimes wait seem take forever seated busy location Las Vegas  <EOR> I love both place LA Vegas  Nice Japanese restaurant  <EOR> I coming raku almost 10 years Truly love raku EVERY single time dine    always consistently delicious! far favorite restaurants LV even United States    My husband both love raku both very different loves   My must orders pouched egg w uni salmon roe raku agedashi tofu foie gras   His must orders pig ear Teba wings chicken breast w chicken skin Ours loves tendon juicy fried chicken miso soup fluffy cheesecake !

Agedashi tofu pretty good Foie Gras custard good stuff  Very rich! Yellowtail carpaccio good They all pretty good  exceptional!    BUT   if u want side hotsauce its $2 dab!! WHAT?!! If hotsauce lover don't mad! Lol Fyi agedashi tofu came dab hot sauce side part dish didn't just ask ruin dish palate  simply wanted little more!   Service ok busy don't expect 5 star service!! <EOR> Not impressed  sure everyone raving about  ordered number dishes menu really wanted place but am sad report even worth trying me  great sake selection though  <EOR> Nice atmosphere looks hole wall but pretty nice decor  Really great place escape strip enjoy some good Japanese food  <EOR> I dined Raku 10pm Tuesday night really enjoyed meal     The pitcher beer came chilled glasses  always plus   The aji sashimi special good but really liked house made wasbi soy sauce   Very yummy!  Next came fried ebi balls also special deep fried har gau dumplings   Light tasty   Then came items ordered robata grill chicken wings enoki mushrooms wrapped bacon kurobota pork cheeks   big robata fan loved all 3 choices   wing particular very meaty tender flavorful   The best dish night probably agedashi tofu   even drank all broth came in!  The juicy fried chicken also winning dish   But deduct 1 star service   older ladies wasn't friendliest then also forgot grilled musubi order   When reminded them came way late  <EOR> Totally would come back Omakase next time!  The yellowtail carpaccio nicely presented micro shiso chrysanthemum flower petals fresh wasabi   sprinkled some Raku's Green Tea Salt onto fish which added more umami   We tried Asajime Chicken Thigh Kobe Beef Outside Skirt Garlic Apple Marinated Colorado Lamb Chop Foie Gras Glazed Soy based sauce Robata Grill menu  execution each grilled items pretty close perfect  whether because quality proteins cooking over charcoal just right amount time because items grilled over imported oak binchotan charcoal!

Service great but sometimes food little slow coming consider planning least 2 hours your time enjoy meal here  <EOR> We did $65 tasting 15 course meal!  Only thing didn't grilled ground chicken    Only reason knocked 2 stars off because made reservation made clear would cost if late didn't show but early seated 15 minutes past reservation  least food made it  <EOR> Came Monday night wait   didn't reservations but if come reservation  waited hour half sit bar didn't mind sitting there  hostess whatever taking names list wasn't very personable  she said wait they'll call when  seats ready took lady 3 times phone number correct it's very loud inside restaurant   She didn't tell estimate anything long wait be    Food Miso soup best miso restaurant  definitely don't skimp tofu it  soup thick pieces tofu mushrooms well which different but good! Must try! Yellowtail carpaccio very light refreshing  tasted fresh worked well sauce came but good without sauce   A5 waygu skewer must even though pricey piece worth it  meat just melted butter when ate it   Tsukune grilled chicken pretty big pieces seasoned really well   Kobe beef w garlic beef very tender love garlic good me   Duck w balsamic soy glaze duck little dry but okay nothing special   Enoki wrapped w bacon anything bacon tastes good!  Portabello w stuffed chicken loved well  Chicken cooked well seasoned well  same chicken used tsukune grilled chicken    Our server however really nice attentive chefs nice well  hostess could friendlier  Overall enjoyed meal nice place try if small plates sharing variety  Definetly reservations though if don't want wait long  <EOR> Excellent highly skilled preparations small grilled Japanese foods  Food preparation presentation also excellent  Very few tables getting reservation difficult but well worth extra planning  Table waiters give great recommendations  Fantastic sake list  special place  <EOR> We usually come Vegas least twice year   wanted try someplace new long day Hoover Dam Grand Canyon stumbled across Raku based reviews fellow yelpers     Don't let outside fool inside nicely decorated   restroom good conversation piece just see yourself     We ordered following Tofu Salad Reminds Japanese version caprese salad   Made handmade tofu which specialty   Hands down best tofu salad ever tasted close best tofu country   Especially good green tea salt   Aji prepared sashimi fried Both ways exceptional   only complaint sashimi pieces small but then quality quantity   prepared spend $30 dish   Agedashi Tofu Good dish well   special homemade tofu ikura topping highlights dish   Kurobota Pork Cheek but boyfriend wasn't fan   Tsukune Average best   recommend try something else   Hamburg Steak Great dish   Somewhat large size two hamburg steaks top each other   serve sizzling hotpot egg mushrooms onions   When waitress poured sauce over top didn't quite sizzle liking she kind enough bring back could heat pot   To drink sake trio sampler $18   able substitute two drinks something else wanted try   favorite Hananomai ended ordering few glasses $15 each   In end experienced nothing but excellent service along excellent food   top everything open until 3am   place highly recommended if mood great Japanese food  <EOR> I such high expectations all five star reviews but left disappointed  reservation Friday night 10 pm but didn't need one  only 7 tables place very intimate    PROS service excellent   Very friendly    some plum sake rather expensive $16 very small glass but very good    CONS place very expensive don't come starving   Don't fooled small price tags   portions equally small   instance $3 asparagus wrapped bacon equivalent maybe whole asparagus spear  $7 scallop scallop     The food all good  But nothing amazing nothing rave about   flavor good but nothing unique  had Agedashi tofu Just ok   didn't finish it    Grilled snapper  Very very expensive $28 very little fish while cooked well grilled fish no sauce any special seasoning stand out  Just plain grilled fish   Rather boring    Enoki mushrooms wrapped bacon   favorite dish very good    Pork cheek other favorite dish   Very tender and  flavorful    Chicken wrapped chicken skin   Good but just tasted regular grilled chicken cook home  No special seasoning     Nothing special    Scallop soy sauce    Good but boring     7 bucks scallop expected wow     And few more dishes again good but plain nothing special    I won't back  If prices better would but charge expect wowed unfortunately wasnt  <EOR> The food impressive uncompromising  everything open but fundamentally Western taste but everything interesting  Best self sliced tofu plate bites including custard foie gras sea bass grilled chicken grilled onion minced hot pepper flaming stone steak whipped cheese cream raspberry sauce sweet sake cream   We sat little alcove kaiseki but

We tried Raku's Tofu Housemade tofu super silky served fresh grated ginger green onions Katsuoboshi  Then topped some Raku's Soy Sauce Japanese Daijingo soy sauce blended Japanese plum   Simple tasty  Also Agedashi Tofu housemade tofu lightly fried presented bowl warm dashi broth topped green onions Ikura nori  extra kick some hot chili paste placed rim your bowl  Really really great  big fan tofu could happy eating Raku's Tofu all night but Agedashi Tofu party flavors your mouth   We also tried Tempura Asparagus Kanpachi sashimi special Blue Fin Tuna sashimi special Salmon Ikura Oroshi Enoki Mushroom Wrapped Bacon Direct Flamed Eggplant served Katsuoboshi Duck Balsamic Soy Sauce Kobe Beef Filet Wasabi Apple Marinated Lamb Chop Grilled Rice Balls Yellowtail Glazed Soy based Sauce Juicy Deep Fried Chicken  Yuzu Sake really delicious   My favorites tofu dishes sashimi specials Enoki Mushroom Bacon good ordered twice Apple Marinated Lamp Chop we ordered two well    Our meal spectacular  much fun all dishes service wonderful  many selections everything least exciting best amazing  would compare experience enjoying tapas great friends  Same idea sharing small plates  just always blast book  food wonderful seriously can't wait back try some other amazing concoctions! <EOR> One best Japanese restaurants to    We no reservations lucky enough score table 10minute wait   From menu ordered variety items  can't recall whole list things but definitely remember Kobe Beef Bacon wrapped Enoki mushroom   For 2 people bill came close $300  including warm sake beers variety bite sized meals    I really idea having smaller bite sized portions allows play flavors mouth  Rather engulfing large portions food savor moment flavor truly appreciate work put into meal  People derive satisfaction food place them into two categories  full flavor experience food  If we're talking inverted U shape curve would sitting right top curve  full feel disgusted myself but hungry where didn't feel food undervalued     That being said think still quite pricey  If only price little bit cheaper would come far more often  <EOR> Raku restaurant way off beaten path strip  located area known Chinatown small strip mall  Parking looked tight since strip mall many other eating restaurants  impressed sake menu choices quality selection  started chefs selection pickled veggies then homemade agadashi tofu  smooth tasty  Next course scallop cooked perfection  friend several fish dishes sashimi all done perfectly  If looking sushi rolls probably isn't place you  more traditional Japanese many cooked entrees sashimi  finished off some green tea which perfect end great Japanese dinner  <EOR> I very high expectations Raku based stellar yelp reviews   place met exceeded those expectations fantastic meal   am highly recommending anybody know visiting Vegas   Those live Las Vegas visit place regularly am highly jealous   The restaurant does huge dining area would highly recommend reservations most nights we could only late reservation Thursday night called couple days advance    I would second description read before place Japanese Tapas bar   tried 8 9 dishes shared them between two us   left satisfied but over stuffed   This best meal Vegas bill came just over $100 drinks   My wife things each liked more others but largely due personal preferences   item most highly recommend trying grilled Foie Gras Glazed Soy base Sauce   They extensive sake menu little intimidating someone doesn't much sake knowledge   However explained server she helped pick something out   The restaurant located China Town if staying strip your best bet getting take cab unless car course    little worried find cab end meal   However asked server if she could recommend cab company she instead offered call one   cab arrived less 10 minutes called  <EOR> Um wow  We typically don't off strip eat when town but given boys all rolled into town late night spot able accommodate big group 1am   In small strip mall off main road location subtle hidden but treasures await inside worth discovery   We good sampling off all items including appetizers crunchy shrimp sashimi salad robata items just mad yummy   If you're ever Vegas want head off strip some good food great prices feel just robbed head Raku  <EOR> 3 5 stars  think place overhyped coming eating places LA  did reservations far advance  They're very attentive  surprised called back even when didn't leave message  Table service also quick attentive but also hurried same time  Prices bit more compared places similar LA   Enjoyed Duck w Balsamic Soy Sauce Pork cheek Foie gras w soy glaze Enoki w bacon Green tea creme brulee though favorite still lavender creme brulee Just ok Salmon w Ikura Oroshi it cooked well but just unique taste Asajime Chicken Thigh it tender more affordable skewers Raku's Tofu toppings offered nice but prefer tofu served other forms i e lightly fried <EOR> I am pissed two reasons  #1 last night Vegas if known amazing place would earlier would came least three times during week stayed  #2 place New York   This Japanese experience waiting whole life  Food humans feel good no doubt  But then food feel sedated  also type food but anyway goes     Let's start sake sampler serve  Three different cups filled sake  sweet smooth strong  All high quality tasting sakes  came Sapporo fresh tap  Oh Baby   I thoroughly read through all yelp reviews restaurant before SURE tried best things menu  brought list items raved about  Thank Lord Yelp  would recommend ordering bunch things if your first time but if want know dishes stood most                  Blue Fin Sashimi really much say other best tuna hands down  texture clean taste just beautiful  waitress instructed flavor certain dishes when all   Raku's Tofu Agedashi Tofu allow order half each which strongly recommend  Raku's tofu slab cream pie most delicate flavor  liked Agedashi bit more because came bowl broth more soaked flavors  Both home made unlike any other tofu ever tried  dad hates tofu he really enjoyed both tofu dishes   **Poached Egg Sea Urchin Salmon Roe far ranked most unique delicious dish ever eaten  serve bowl where each item placed its own group  then instructed stir all together soup  If issues slimy food texture may you  flavors pure put together angel light  saltiness roe odd sweet flavor sea urchin egginess egg crunchy earthiness vegetables  many emotions during eating dish  never forget one   Pork Cheek Remember Gushers? bacon gusher  Heavens betsy amazing  If fan fatty things may however $3 peice worth trying  Salty sweet flavor burst  Mm    Kobe Beef Tendon am tendon person begin if still give try but ready because very uniquely textured  ultimate tendon crispy outside congealed gelly inside  waitress sure tell good tendon your skin   Salmon Belly Think most tender butter salmon ever had  Well sucks compared dish  don't know else describe it  outside grilled crispiness salty flavor flesh naturally oil laden tasted Salmon Butter if ever such thing  *Sigh*    Enoki Mushroom wrapped Bacon dish very simple but combination flavors!! simply must try this  first thing hits your tongue wonderful grilled bacon salty sweet flavor then CRUNCH bite into cluster mushrooms your mouth filled soft earthy flavors   Ikura Don eat Ikura least two times week because love super good you  dish bowl freshest Ikura seriously gave LOT Ikura served white rice  adament telling does need any seasoning  beautiful simple flavors here    Grilled Baby Corn Spicy Mayo dayyum way grilled corn should taste  serve corn still wrapped greens peel open fresh smokey grilled baby corn  Dip spicy mayo then crunchy delcious treat    Some other things tried Kobe Beef Filet Wasabi Kobe Liver Soy Glazed Foie Gras Green Tea Creme Brulee Lamb Chops Chicken Thigh Japanese Shishito Pepper   think  it? only thing know would order again Pork Ear  hard cartiledge inside kind threw off even though all tasted good   All food little over $200 really bad when take into consideration quality specialty getting   The inside small cozy service great sure reservations would smart order mostly everything once if can  BATHROOM AMAZING  MOST HIGH TECH TOILET EVER   I never written long review Yelp excited reviewing place Raku  If really want experience some best food HERE  <EOR> Came family again wife's town relatives   10 all together Raku advised would prefix menu party size $50 per person some food prepared food would flow better each person instead waiting each individual order cook   did request some things included prefix menu kobe beef skirt steak duck crunchy asparagus   gotta say trip better last   over 10 dishes each   pork cheeks skirt steak awesome though recommend dipping sauce comes extra flavor   All all every dish came good   Still wish quail eggs wrapped bacon   = <EOR> I came across Raku Andrew Zimmern  watching random Youtube video Las Vegas eats Mr  Zimmern swears Raku anti Vegas destination some best Japanese food around  immediately dropped everything headed off strip  Raku located dismal looking strip mall Las Vegas' very own Chinatown concentrates

Sweet!  But yes reservations way advance especially if larger party weekend   The thing look Specials Board   usually list 5 6 items range raw cooked items   weirdest part board change during your visit there   During 2 3 hour dinner saw some things sell replaced something else   waitstaff doesn't mention newer items something just look for  For example oysters listed specials board but party sitting next ended ordering last giant oyster   seated only knew because oyster sitting ice right front them!  squid ice but wasn't listed specials board! only keeping your eyes changing Specials Board but see what's fresh ice day!  few cooked items although good raw fish choices always best!  These days skip Robata Grill items because aren't tasty but focus more unique items     One most favorite items Crispy Asparagus Okaki $5    simple asparagus  dredged rice crackers deep fried   don't know why good but just is   when add little matcha salt oh gawd!  just love it   Another item last visit include Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard $10    There's piece duck lays top dish actually duck liver use goose   foie gras already mixed egg gives whole dish rich egg taste     Poached Egg Sea Urchin Salmon Roe $9 another unusual pairing mostly because mountain yam gives dish slimy texture   break egg mix all together but can't help but notice slimy effect mountain yam   tasty nonetheless     The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi $9 50 something everyone would enjoy   Husband isn't usually fan liver except served foie gras style but he game   did still lend livery taste but something try once   I always enjoy homemade tofu Raku's Tofu Whole $5 50 does disappoint   server theirs bonito shavings ginger scallions   The four condiments placed every table should ignored especially green tea salt own soy sauce   Yum!  Since expanded bathrooms indeed something look at   First off clean pristine holds cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see Spring Mountain!   Service last few visits much better compared first visit   waitress took care counter never let water glass empty she always letting know when food coming weren't waiting long giving clean plates too   My only real gripe Although usually love sitting counter watch chefs work also can't overlook things probably shouldn't seen dining guests   prep guys counter sneezed into hands continued prepping food   totally turned off especially because sink right behind him   wasn't long when Husband said weren't going ordering anymore cold foods   When inquired why he said he noticed same prep guy just cough into hands continue working   Yes sneeze cough into very bare hands prepping food   Yuck   Nonetheless still love Raku would continue recommending it   But alas those basic hygiene issues need addressed!    4 5 stars  <EOR> I don't know why taken long write review place  Raku deserves nothing short five stars   I've coming since beginning days prove show consistency quality no matter much success they've experienced  Everything menu day same beginning let reassure you'll glad eating here  Don't skip any specials presented chalkboard well since they're never shown disappoint    My favorite items?

price way high need cut ittt   cut cut cut it   Although pricey Raku worth experience   Just don't all cray did ordering foie gras uni only dishes   Next thing know you're looking baby whale tight dress Omnia   cute Friyay fun date bae Baegas   I definitely recommend seared foie gras rice   sounded basic but rice actually balanced richness foie perfectly   topped just simple sweet soy sauce worked   definitely favorite dish night   kobe beef skewer forgettable   guess selling point garlic top but I'd pass one   Same pork cheek   ordered few skewers but none really stood nothing special   did however enjoy fresh tofu   ordered both agedashi version fresh plain version   Both good although wish also offered some sort sauce plain version   dry condiments accompanied rather large chunk fresh tofu didn't much just felt something missing   dish needed some type soup sauce help wash down all tofu     The poached egg uni fish roe another dish enjoyed   warm egg yolk mixed uni yaaas give me    However if you're going order dish agedashi tofu then don't order miso soup vice versa because contain exact same mushrooms condiments which made all three dishes taste same   disappointed lack creativity there   buttered scallops mean scallop just one good   liked beautiful presentation shell   just taddd bit overcooked but flavor wise very tasty   grilled salmon belly good again chose serve fish plain no sauce just some grated radish but would've preferred some ponzu     Their selection sake most extensive ever seen   Definitely order few different glasses try   finally thought server bit introverted wasn't very engaging   When he going over specials just felt he trying through them fast possible   think service could better given people off strip come looking enjoy both

There's no words describe great menu genius offerings potato INSIDE grilled corn    favorites grilled rice ball sashimi salad potato w corn portabella mushroom desserts! <EOR> Raku Japanese restaurant eat every time when visit Las Vegas   I still remember very first time exhausting 4 hour drive Phoenix having serious headache cold winter night ready hit bed  Didn't know why but female friend insisted should down Chinatown eat restaurant called Raku which recommended some friends instead somewhere nearer Strip  Although Chinatown far Strip all only less 10 minute drive still felt reluctant go   Since Vegas time restaurant opens bit different other regular ones   6PM 3AM  When arrived still hour earlier default opening time wait entire hour until place  already extremely hungry tired impatient then   As girl friend entering restaurant all waiters waitresses turned heads toward shouted welcome eat Raku!! Japanese I learned few Japanese words some animation watch   little bit overwhelmed time but used acted way all customers same friendly attitude  waitress asked if first time said yes she then began introduce menu special dishes very popular  The restaurant small but nice warm 6PM soon became crowded  overall lightings dark romantic jazz playing background would certainly good place those date  some regular seats tables chairs but also food bar choose sit which chance watch chief making some special dishes  We then started read menu very many options could made four categories Appetizers Robata Grill Rice Noodle Soup Dessert  friend each picked 6 7 dishes told friendly waitress portion dishes relatively smaller compare other regular American restaurants  only waited less five minutes first dish special tofu come really quick special enough satisfied Asian stomach  During entire meal waitresses would bring dish time bring another dish only finished previous believe food should eaten such orders customers would better tastes it  We've stayed hour half told waitresses actually just drove all way Phoenix she soon managed give free dessert  nice was!  Finally checking place price food totally reasonable worth its delicious taste mentioned above friend ordered over 12 dishes price still something under $100  leaving saw long line people waiting outside eat  I think clear enough why love restaurant much  If ever Vegas try Raku definitely worth your time money! <EOR> My boyfriend discovered Raku while researching top restaurants Las Vegas  able score late reservation 6 Saturday night 12am  told groups more 5 required select omakase menu $75 per person    I expecting blown away food reading numerous reviews restaurant  verdict? food definitely over hyped  good meal but nothing really stood out    We started tofu appetizer where star dish green tea salt which purchase   Other courses included whole fried fish broth various charcoal bbq skewers soup assorted sashimi  All ingredients high quality but nothing really blew away    When came time dessert all some fruit sorbet  sorry but $75 per person would expected something better green tea creme brulee anyone?   Overall might consider coming back ordering la carte items menu saw some interesting offerings  advice  steer clear omakase menu  <EOR> Have never experienced such bad service before bad attitude took 20 mins seaweed salad <EOR> No question 5 star establishment  seriously hated tofu most life but Agedashi Tofu probably best thing ate city Las Vegas over 3 day stay  amazing  I'd suggest coming friends sampling menu did gives opportunity try more amazing menu items    I'll likely back second visit less week live 5 hours away its good <EOR> My husband looks any excuse leave town recently visited Las Vegas   main focus venture away relax seek some good eats   found Raku Yelp decided reservation   reservation made 2 weeks advance while booked but going squeeze in   highly recommend making reservations   night hostess turn away several people    I did Raku expectations because husband picks restaurant tag along   atmosphere nice but nothing ordinary   service prompt attentive   hard choose menu because everything sounded good   ended ordering lot    Everything very good but few things more memorable then others   dishes stood most garlic skirt steak house made tofu apple marinated lamb chop foie steamed egg duck broth udon green tea soba poached egg   flavors preparation items fantastic   personally appreciated tofu soba noodles most because taste skillfully made scratch   tofu much depth richness   provide green tea salt some house made soy sauce sprinkle dip tofu in   simple yet flavorful   part wanted order  tofu pour some honey over it   imagine would also good dessert tofu   soba very nice texture green tea flavor worked well   think best soba noodles outside Japan     We both very satisfied experience felt if eating food Japan  definitely return future  <EOR> Raku lives its reputation   service excellent ! made reservations ahead time we're seated immediately food came quickly enjoyed every moment   tried all highlights mentioned none disappointed  <EOR> Came cousins Friday night Omakase menu   definitely best Japanese dining experiences had   10 course meal included amazing sashimi salad kobe beef Bacon wrapped mushrooms octopus much more ending green tea creme brulee puffed raspberry cheesecake  Every course excellent definitely walk away full  <EOR> If any negative place location   Situated older strip mall really best location does look much outside   Once inside while extremely small restaurant exudes character charm   felt some quaint Japanese restaurant right movie   The food        Well did tasting menu $75 must say best tasting experiences lot   Each course simply fabulous   While some courses enjoyed more others liked them all nothing would ordered ala carte   chatted several other guests tables close all food looked spectacular well everyone seemed love everything     Our server could better   He touch slow but kind added charm he did quite few tables   He took time each table appreciated explaining all dishes great detail     I would highly recommend anyone foodie looking foodie experience experience Raku  <EOR> Three words live uni udon   Say whaaat??

If live Vegas if visit Vegas Raku dining experience must check off your epicurean culinary list! <EOR> The food fantastic  creative delicious  only reason am giving 5 stars because service  server a male just unpleasant  He didn't say hello nor introduce menu even though told first visit never checked during meal never even thanked upon payment  He certainly didn't say good bye either  if he didn't want work there  couldn't understand cold unfriendly demeanor  swear he never smiled once bit friendly  ask questions ladies brought dishes  would definitely eat again but if he serves again decline  bad such beautiful dining experience ruined such unpleasantness  <EOR> We came back having visited year previous   time came party eight 8    staff responded well challenge having 2 diners arriving slightly tardy   75$ level omakase   afforded stunning parade 10 dishes including but exact order house made tofu raved over even noisy meatatarian sashimi very fresh very thin very cleansing palate ankimo the only dish passed over dining entourage    if server referred monk fish liver well ankimo he never would known would enjoyed it Popeye salad requested item when making reservations    best applications spinach bacon y goodness bottom really wanted reprise last year's visit  scallop served shell   Delicate perfectly prepared Yakitori cherry tomatoes Kobe beef Yakitori stripe wasabi  yes proudly showed Kobe beef importation license at least did last year wasn't American Kobe a k a Wagyu miniature negitoro don Betty's favorite    She kept saying simple dish but think amount work dicing seasoning preparation perfectly much more simple   Simple concept expert complex execution Yakitori pork cheek Fried ice fish I think part notes smudged all followed pear sorbet w condensed milk bottom bowl   We show off main rest room folks dragged along never before  complete fish tank   only clean but visually stunning     As Charlie the noisy meatatarian erstwhile foodie says and all agree respect star product doing just enough enhance your enjoyment never overpowering it  Thanks Raku folks  another wonderful visit  <EOR> The food good  fancy  liked all cooked meat sticks slices fish fresh good texture  abalone amazing  pork belly very tender We all specials corn potato That favorite  The food came relitively fast but end took 30 min last course 163$ two people all specials  <EOR> This good really gets Japanese cooked food   You sashimi many restaurants give some wow factors all over place   But rare find Japanese restaurant serves omakase really tailor you've ordered doesn't give duplicates   Reservation required reserve early don't eat your dinner 10 30  <EOR> It's fair Raku come California   exposure experience izakaya restaurants varied enough know 5 star fare when eat Raku close  so very close  but lost points service price   The kobe beef tendon grilled duck balsamic soy sauce sold out   7 30PM Monday night place open until 3AM   Since severely disappointed waitress pushed specials evening us   We ordered bluefin tuna toro unagi cooked two styles grilled salt pepper grilled salmon cheek kama    regular menu also homemade tofu served two different ways cold green onions ginger hiyayakko sitting hot broth being fried agedashi    also grilled pork cheek kurobuta couple chicken wings chicken egg served over bowl rice oyakodon    dessert green tea creme brulee   The toro amazing should #1 reason why come here   soft smooth slightly sweet perfectly fresh toro supposed taste   $25 6 huge slabs?!  Yes please!  The homemade tofu reason #2 why I'd come back   prefer agedashi style just because prefer hot tofu over cold but both styles enjoyable   particularly liked flavorful broth was   The unagi total rip off   $30 6 small bony pieces   Grilled better S P but neither things I'd order again strongly suggest don't either   The salmon kama okay but something I'd order ever again because almost every good Japanese restaurant California better cheaper price   isn't say terrible though   If you've NEVER salmon kama ever can't where you're doesn't hurt try here   The kurobuta chicken wings salty greasy fatty expected   Would great beer which unfortunately lacked   sure would better experience meat ordered something foie gras kobe beef item   The oyako which means 'parent' 'child' referring chicken egg respectively classic Japanese comfort food loved it   Tender chicken pieces nestled bowl warm soft rice  gooey egg yolk made reason #3 why I'd come back   some dish special fried rice but if love both much I'd recommend getting it!  Lastly green tea creme brulee mediocre but come don't place fabulous dessert   Try Nobu French Italian restaurant if want dessert knock your socks off   Now let talk sub par service   ordered tea which surprise surprise cost $ but waitresses rarely refilled tea no matter many times asked   when did they'd refill 1 4th way   tea way roasted green tea amazing suggest ordering even if end getting sake beer   But know your rights  don't afraid ask more demand refill it!   you're paying all!  Another waitress also charged extra $50 sheer stupidity   When discovered discrepancy between amount listed bill amount charged she tried defend herself saying restaurant dark   Try going lighted area then?  bill isn't something 'guess'   if question written ask us   Sigh   With all said Raku good non sushi Japanese restaurant find Sin City eye opening experience people think Japanese cuisine all sushi sashimi   Bottom line if you're Vegas must try  <EOR> Stumbled upon gem when attempted drop into Kabuto without reservation   Incredibly fresh sushi great specials which presented chalk board explained one  Robata great too  Must yellow tail collar lamb chops asparagus bacon    Everything ordered presented beautifully explained detail  But best part sitting bar watching sushi chef prepare dishes others Omakase  He's true artist even made couple treats hadn't ordered    I wait again Omakase suggest making reservation 3 days ahead time this    Open 6PM 3AM!!!!

I first heard place two years through former coworker wife fellow Yelper Eric B   He told place its own tofu its Agedashi Tofu absolute must   Since then arranging trips Vegas just try place out   Unfortunately last two attempts failed because kept getting sick just few days before trip   time determined whether sick not   Strangely enough still sick but didn't stop enjoying most enjoyable meals life   Everything place unique well put together   intimate setting clean modern decor   upscale look even though more izakaya style establishment   sort Asian version Animal in LA    Most items appetizer portions few full size options   Most items wife tried didn't look complicated but its choice quality ingredients perfect cooking technique made each item stand out   Raku even its own condiments each table detailed description each   Raku's Green Tea Salt Soy Sauce Yagenbori Shichimi Koregusu all very unique   Fuefuki Dai type snapper fish prepared two ways   specials day   sashimi other portion grilled   fish extremely fresh  think still alive when cooked because bent when served us   looked fish fighting its dear life being cooked   Poor thing   Sad but delicious   Even without adding any seasoning fish flavored perfectly both versions   Pork Ear   great Raku's Green Tea Salt Koregusu  spicy pepper sake Koregusu helped balance fat pork ear   flavor quite good three different textures keep interesting   Foie Gras Glazed Soy Based Sauce   fan foie gras general but still ordered since saw several people rave dish   great dish if taste texture foie gras  just wasn't thing   However better foie gras past other places   Agedashi Tofu  Now dish came definitely lived expectation   Excellent texture taste sauce accompanied tofu great well   always thought tofu tasted bland boring but proved wrong   much more depth flavor     Butter Sauteed Scallop Soy Sauce   cooked perfection even soy sauce incredible  drank some leftover soy sauce afterward because good   Kobe Beef Filet Wasabi   perfect combination   beef cooked perfection because super tender tasty wasabi added just enough heat balance fat  Kobe beef before but none quite this   others taste impostors comparison ones served here     Juicy Deep Fried Chicken   basically chicken karage but less batter more chicken   called juicy reason JUICY   most tender juicy chicken ever had   flavor good just way was   seemed soaked chicken sake rice wine vinegar   actually looked full order because portion much bigger other items tried   Wagyu Sukiyaki   another special items day   full size meal appetizer portion   Wagyu beef absolute heaven   tender soft even when cooked completely   sukiyaki broth sweet salty added flavors onion fragrant green leaves which know name of    The menu extensive but learned first visit stick any dishes made house tofu anything Kobe Wagyu beef     The service seemed inflexible when called reservation   person took call said finish meal within two hours only hold reservation no more 15 minutes past reservation time  However actual service during dinner friendly attentive   Someone constantly came refill tea everyone helpful explaining menu   My wife such positive experience want tradition return every year around time celebrate birthdays  <EOR> If could negative stars  WOULD   place sucks   Don't waste your money    STAY AWAY    All reviews must family friends because even signature tofu dish SUCKED SERVICE BAD   PLACE SMALL   ohh   did mentioned FOOD SUCKED!! <EOR> Wow must best place ever eaten at    omakase goood!!  much food couldn't finish all   end meal rice dish couldn't finish chef mad rice balls take home    great idea btw   till good next day     We also tried kobe beef liver which sounds very scary but good     This new must spot every time we're vegas! <EOR> It's while since last review but write visiting restaurant main reason very end review   Stay tuned because most likely amazed was   First off don't mixed Raku sweets because Raku Grill Uber driver dropped off Raku Sweets which wrong spot but grill hidden back corner   restaurant very small dark but very authentic clean because folks working Japanese but speak English fluently unlike wannabe non Japanese pretenders     Second food   the poached egg uni ikura extremely unique   If don't gooey slimy texture your mouth then may but if handle gooeyness sliminess texture must try delicious!  trying unique delicious dishes   Raku tofu wagyu sashimi good but phenomenal   Now onto fois gras   the bowl seared phenomenal but custard meh   Fois gras bowl rice lettuce seared fois gras   If don't want rice just more fois gras just seared fois gras   Third price   dishes cheaper San Francisco!  example chicken skewers thigh skin etc  $3 50 less   Seared fois gras $18 50 vs  San Francisco's Isa restaurant $21+ but guess difference cost brioche   Total including tip $130 two which good normal sushi San Francisco usually costs $130 $150 without fois gras   Lastly main reason review   drum roll please!
