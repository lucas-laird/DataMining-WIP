Seriously   it's terrible!   GO fun drinks dessert  Don't waste your time money food  can't even say food average which pretty sad when group 6 average drink per person 1 bill over $300  Such disappointment!!!! <EOR> The outside decor restaurant definitely caught attention when driving walking around strip  lunch Sunday afternoon  party two ordered Onion Soup white pizza meal share  Both delicious large portions  dessert red velvet sundae  only critique raspberry sauce overpowers taste both ice cream red velvet cake otherwise delicious  sundaes big enough share here  <EOR> My disclaimer before review Wednesday 11 00 am   If want pay atmosphere rather food then place you  Overall everything place trendy chic except staff's attitude which bit casual  bus boy came over place set some glasses he actually told glasses  Thank you    Breakfast served eleven  crepes listed menu sounded delicious but turn lunch menu  Sandwiches salads some hamburgers  patty melt eatable but bread meat ratio size quarter sitting saucer  extras added onto listed menu's description    I did delight desserts specialty drinks much meal themselves however think where should spend your money if decided walk into place  <EOR> After 4 star worthy dinner restaurant Bellagio hotel party four looking forward delicious dessert some prime people watching across street Sugar Factory located Paris hotel  asked hostess long we'd wait table large patio overlooking Las Vegas Strip musical fountains Bellagio  told 30 minutes provided cell phone number proceeded explore Paris until name called  Within 10 minutes called headed back restaurant taken great table fantastic people watching potential  When asked if could dessert menus told patio dinner dining only  When explained asked told when submitted name lead hostess summoned informed since mistake informing would granted exception allowed stay table  promised order lots dessert!   Unfortunately when all downhill  staff handled seating situation appropriately but dessert ordered fell woefully short expectations appeared best place town late night sugar fix  Indeed dessert bad each took couple bites couldn't further    Two party ordered coffee decaf which  impressively arrived warmed half and half side  classy touch indicative good things come  other two party ordered cocktails enjoyed them  Much cocktail menu comprised huge sugar laden drinks which although taste seemed appropriately Vegas well suited restaurant claiming showcase sugar    We thought would fun share outrageous dessert rather order four smaller ones dark chocolate fondue fit bill  came brownie bites cake pops strawberries bananas rice crispy treats two kinds cookies oddly pretzel bread bites dipping  platter arrived most unappetizing display  chocolate particularly high quality served fondue pot other warming bowl   fondue forks provided actually short wooden skewers   Whipped cream provided would expect dessert fondue  Moreover rice crispy treats pretzel bread stale brownies cookies cloyingly sweet but otherwise tasteless cake bites looked horrible tasted worse raw sugar dough balls covered smashed sprinkles  entire platter looked tasted leftovers day old scrapes never sold and clearly should discarded   pondered whether being singled taking prime table dessert only order but consistently bad taste every item plate hideous way which food platter displayed led conclude Sugar Factory likely shockingly! cannot deliver high quality dessert items   impression places great location super view feels skimp quality charge lot inferior food just because can  paid nearly 30 dollars plate dessert left bad taste mouthes     Fortunately pink faced street performers endless Vegas tourists provided just enough distraction sweeten otherwise disappointing experience  There's absolutely no way sugar coat it Sugar Factory place high quality dessert  <EOR> This place pricey but isn't Vegas?  boyfriend strolling drunkenly lurching around strip decided stop bite eat   shared fried mac cheese amazing greasy all club sandwich fresh veggies high end bacon yummy cranberry bread    perfect meal fuel evening heavy drinking foolishness depraved shenanigans! <EOR> I used place now HATE place! would rather starved instead going back!  I came year ago experience good  year came again totally worse last year  service lacking  First all made reservation through Open Table very sure made because first hostess able see able say husband's name correctly  seated down notice points weren't added open table account yet husband asked hostess see if checked in  But then point hostess said he didn't any reservation guess deleted seated couldn't even see record open table account either  record before seated then disappeared seated  didn't points open table definitely fault ours  At end when check forgot show them Total Reward card 10% discount credit card swiped but haven't signed yet  asked if redo bill us  said no because credit card swiped  upset didn't argue them just paid them decided going back  know final long don't sign receipt could voided haven't signed redo bill total reward discount  know other restaurants would happened past  just needed void charge card especially haven't signed  still give them 15% tip end though am totally dissatisfied laziness wrong doing including messing open table reservation   don't deserve tip but gave 15% anyway last time would see setting foot particular restaurant   I want note service Town Square way way way better Paris Hotel  Town Square doesn't offer Total Reward discount of course casino but price lower paris hotel  Unless really really really want look Bellagio Fountain while eating otherwise no point eat Paris Hotel  don't really see much Bellagio Fountain anyway if sitting outside patio   I am going back Sugar Factory Paris Hotel ever again  think employees lacking training management particular doing job well training staff maybe management didn't treat employees well making them staff doing job well    If want ask food food better Town Square well  always red velvet sundae but time changed something tasted nasty SF Paris Hotel  While red velvet sundae Town Square still good  visited both within same week comparison fair one  yes red velvet sundae twice within same week but different location  Town Square much better paris hotel!!!!!! Town Square server hostess way better didn't mess open table reservation greeted nicely always smiley face  staff including management just staff floor SF Sugar Factory requires lot improvement  <EOR> Sugar Factory official dinner place bachelorette party good choice well    I loved candy shop felt Japanese version toy store but sweet overtly sexual even if weren't toys kind definitely vibe if looked close enough    The restaurant itself   the first 17 pages yes 17 drinks remaining couple food stuffs  split club sandwich salad Mrs  Jacobovitz while drank then nursed then drank more goblets  Because  seriously woman loves sweet things should've prepared better given name drink itself sweet    The food good expensive definitely place would return and did only bar   server might slightly overwhelmed amount cleavage masks yes masks but he absolute wonder always great smile face  <EOR> Love drinks here!!!

Never Again understand low rating <EOR> I high expectations upon arrival Sugar Factory  new dessert place Strip    wrong?!  While only ordered cupcakes cannot speak other dishes offered experience sub par say least I ordered recommended lemon cupcake only find out   boyfriend ordered cookies creak settled molten lava something along those lines   dessert arrives delightfully presented masterpiece   stuck fork into cake    frosting mound just fell off cupcake dessert crumbled before eyes   dry enough sitting least day hot Vegas sun   waitress polite brought slightly more moist replacement  ate third $4 50 cupcakes left restaurant wishing chocolate gelato shake Jean Phillippe frozen hot chocolate Serendipity    both located within walking distance across Vegas blvd disappointing experience  <EOR> Quick review craphole   you'll notice won't even talk food because never any   Started warm sunny Vegas Tuesday around 3 pm   walking around awhile decided some coffee outdoor patio would hit spot   came upon Sugar Factory saw coffee open tables patio   perfect or thought    hostess station table   tell 10 15 minute wait   that's weird considering numerous open tables but whatever   wait eventually buzz take table outside   waitress comes asks drink order ask water while decide   Well don't just regular tap water but $6 95 bottled water   annoying but again whatever   pass water just coffee   minute later waitress back telling if only want drinks then sit bar   REALLY??  said sure no problem then walked right front door guarantee never back   could understood if lunch dinner rush even weekend when wouldn't want table used just drinks when could people dropping way more cash whole meal   But half full patio off hour weekday   they should fellating bringing business there   Instead busy enforcing arbitrary rules   Use some common sense morons  <EOR> My husband took family sister's bday    Lets just say doesn't disappoint  Exactly where want celebrate everything  Definitely hot spot when visiting Vegas Cheers!!!!! <EOR> The food disappointing but guess really known Signature Goblets   We ordered appetizers looking forward fried mac cheese   let down!  ever cheese use gave weird flavor   couldn't even finish them    bad are!  fries onion rings average   We did New Special Goblet   Fuzzy Peach   Presentation cool tasted pretty good!  Watermelon Peach   Yummy!  would recommendation   husband also ordered Chocoberry   Tasted exactly chocolate covered strawberry   Stick drinks Sugar Factory! <EOR> A group 7 girls ice cream sundaes   ordered 3 share no way going finish those even given best effort!  really sad because die for   Red velvet     I dream you   No charge tap water but did convenience fee but cares   Vegas nickel dime over it  Price fair which sh** ton delicious ice cream twelve thirteen bucks depending order    another red velvet sundae count that  <EOR> By far coolest menus seen awhile! Love place love crapes love atmosphere love presentation! <EOR> I really liked Sugar Factory   twice during last week long stay Vegas   food amazing   ordered signature burger made white chocolate bun amazingly yummie sweetness bun complemented burger perfectly   second time ordered BBQ chicken pizza which big only ate half it   also 2 goblet drinks which just good food   Both visits made during late night hours ambience restaurant nightclub   in house DJ pumps really good music although noise level hard nice conversation   During night place very dark dim lights candles provide only light  only reason can't give them 5 stars they're pricey   goblet drinks ordered cost $36 each occasion drink alone more friend's entire dinner   Also serve tap water buy heard charge $3 5 person if want water   But Vegas if you're looking decadent treat trendy place then Sugar Factory your place  <EOR> I friday last week place alright mean really fun atmosphere agree others well   customized own pizza pretty alright reason why giving 3 stars bit soggy mushrooms small alomst look them microfine glass  But overall fun place drinks good probably only reason ill but other then food ehh nothing exciting  <EOR> This third fourth time going say lot    menu good prices fair staff always great location location location    This place easy right strip love don't walk 5 miles through casino it     Wife ribs she loved them French dip good also     Drinks good ice tea great      Overall stop each Vegas trip   LOVE place <EOR> Poor hostess reception  Very slow seating when place nearly empty  Breakfast ok but no offer refill coffee cup  <EOR> This place awesome! Located strip right under Eiffel tower cool atmosphere great food great service food arrived very fast very good  I really enjoyed experience  <EOR> While writing review still sugar factory waiting table  waiting hour hostess even bothered telling much longer  girlfriend just sat looking bellhop hoping called  <EOR> Came friend eating Grand Lux Cafe  late night wanted some desserts alcohol    We Banana Split Waffles each glass wine  going complain price because live Vegas know when you're strip    should expect higher price  Overall would say liked Banana Split Waffles  lot chocolate waffles though  If ever decide back ask no chocolate syrup waffles  Bananas caramelized strawberries sweet  dessert perfect wine    I probably 45 mins 1 hour  saw waiter twice would say  service ok overall  don't really give much attention unless call them    The environment really nice  sat near outside area  see Bellagio show across street  Since around midnight January weather perfect  would say overall great experience least  remember the alcohol helped! D     There parking garage most casinos  <EOR> The upside place only place open 24 hours Paris Casino there's large enough menu everyone find something generally fit needs   Outside prices high service slow meh mainstream food   so so burgers fries bland pizzas salad   There's better options Paris if open  <EOR> I smores cocktail  okay if really sweet drinks which do but best drink ever way expensive quality ingredients since $16  garnish 3 marshmellows look Kraft Jet Puffed gourmet marshmellows  don't know brand liquor used but smooth tasting  Service also slow even though only two other people bar  Then person took credit card lost look long time  felt candid camera show MTV where things people angry see long takes them something rude  <EOR> All tell ate hubby red velvet pancakes white chocolate sauce candied orange zest fruit jam side signature waffles topped blueberries raspberries strawberries blackberries drizzled your choice white milk dark chocolate sauce we spinach cheese pepper omelet  we couldn't resist finishing fresh hot donuts served plain simply dusted powder sugar your choice milk chocolate white chocolate dipping sauce and or sprinkles go sugar factory party your mouth! <EOR> Expensive glorified bar food crappy server  view great though right across Bellagio fountains  fair warned food mediocre  need really fix place up  disappointing  <EOR> I really excited trying place out  heard great things highly disappointed  drink ordered really watered down  tasted drinking melted Popsicles  ordered some chicken fingers chicken pink  Waste time money spent here  <EOR> 3 5 probably more accurate but no real complaints here    We looking place eat around 11pm Sunday  place open 24 7 offers decent variety reasonable prices  burger sandwich something more fancy crepe filet mignon  food decent service timely efficient    I would say downside drinks bit expensive side  didn't drink but couple friends did  basically stuck drink each since drinks cost more entrees! Granted fancy cocktails  <EOR> I stayed away awhile because food service sub par   Well bad news its little worst   menu once again shrunk selection limited   My meal bland tasteless waitress could give crap over priced   if place off strip would closed months ago locals would avoid it  I really don't understand still high unemployment rate why establishment can't good help including managers  I wonder if owners ever did secret customer see what's going on  obvious absent don't know care <EOR> My advice just drinks food  drinks desserts highlights place food mediocre  <EOR> I excited try Sugar Factory friend's bachelorette party but ended being really disappointed  Maybe because last day barely functioning  But ordered Lollipop Passion drink which obsessing over since looked amazing  did look amazing but tasted weird  Almost Red Bull vodka which hate  expecting fruity deliciousness  should've gambled $36 cost instead  Between 5 hardly put dent it  food wasn't good french dip took two bites all set   Waitress busy big party even notice weren't happy   bad last place good way end otherwise amazing trip  <EOR> The food good portions small but service horrible  First time came full menu available because no cook  time held card hostage cause friends Wells Fargo card working since Wells Fargo system down  refused take hard copy charge them later held entire group over 30 minutes!! demanded manager he she could found  am done place terrible customer service  <EOR> I completely take back original 5 star review apologize anyone wound eating recently due it    As see previous review really loved place  come Vegas probably every two months least made point eat least half trips always recommend friends ask places try    So fast forward weekend haven't Vegas since summer due lot going lives felt little loop some new stuff happening strip between time  guess thing missed place getting new owners chefs  happened browse yelp before headed breakfast today noticed terrible recent reviews but shrugged off because many times thought knew expect     wrong was!  I really hope new owners read take all recent negative feedback seriously cannot believe much shunning insulting fans! First being seated told new water policy $2 person basically tap water bottle apparently save environment bla bla but screams desperate much money take customers cheap     That kinda pissed off boyfriend but whatever tried order boyfriend asks if he order $20 steak eggs but substitute home fries something else told sorry new chef no substitutions allowed      Even if pay extra?      No sorry   final straw   We told waitress we already served coffee would finish coffee somewhere else eat  She wasn't surprised pretty honest upset many customers due new policies completely understood feelings 1 star credited nice service honesty    I eaten restaurants don't offer substitutions but extremely cheap high end quality ingredients creative menu dishes chefs don't want ingredients compromised on  fact place which basically Cheesecake Factory more flare  nerve act pretentious Denny's quality over priced steak eggs dish good substituted side dish ridiculous insulting customer wants something healthier entree    So never again definitely won't recommending place anymore anyone which disappointing because really did coming here  However MANY food options area unnecessary frequent if enjoyable  paid $18 tip two coffees water ha Mon Ami Gabi experience much better classier accommodating     cheaper a few similar things menu $5 less Sugar Factory asking guarantee better quality food !   Get over yourselves new owners cater puts $ your wallet your customers!!! <EOR> I love candy fun drinks  why gave three stars  food wasn't great I don't think anyone amazed it   goblet drinks really fun main reason there  decor service average  think if stepped food game place would awesome! <EOR> Terrible breakfast    Under no circumstances should come breakfast  ordered farm eggs  When arrived cold bland   whole thing tasted taken packet microwaved  country sausages particularly unpalatable    Unless interested eating airplane food give place miss    Service good  <EOR> Hamburgers Onion Rings bomb   good   Service can't say much that   First time service good all   Second visit service better but messed orders   Tortillas soup 10 00 very brothy much else it   Perfect place burgers onion rings  <EOR> Still inattentive maître d's       I came first time girl friend unprofessional server       I came 2nd time boyfriend give another try maître d's inattentive       Their chicken waffle awful linguine tasteless  Although did free sample dessert which end getting sugar factory    Overall need more professional maître d's    just those dress impress! <EOR> Okay only reason why 2 stars because server nice  food overly salty mediocre best  plenty better restaurants  decided order white gummi drink  Basically paying $40 candy smoke  Didn't even buzzed massive sized drink  don't think ounce liquor it  Totally worth it  place super loud  feel night club  <EOR> They no longer monte cristo sandwich menu  ham Brie really good though  <EOR> Horrible  Service slow drinks don't come close pic food takes long time  <EOR> When visited Vegas read couture pop want stop ok which chicken fingers drinks  Now drinks good but pricey yes going back  <EOR> I can't speak food but desserts delicious!

He kept accountable when she wouldn't check us   We crepes dinner crepe which name can't recall two dessert crepes berry banana split  dinner crepe said come greens part dish but garnish featured ingredient  salty masked subtler tastes many ingredients  berry crepe single one excellent but small serving price larger banana okay but don't expect crepe tasting treat because more generous filling overwhelmed single crepe  whole single crepe thing mystifying  If going generous filling provide more crepe  cheap part remember? serving Fajitas getting tortilla    Wouldn't again $66 bill small not great meal gamble elsewhere    Don't miss real Sugar Factory candy shop next door!! <EOR> Delish!

Waste money  If would known would just ordere order considering big breakfast 3 hours before  The milkshake good blow pop but noticed cut down alcohol rim decorations well  drink came 10 mins later  They also seemed bit pushy asking several times if would order anything else all us  etc   Even manager came ask everything commented if all ordered  Sorry unless read better reviews before next trip Vegas which soon think pass  I think case celebrity endorsement serve good food service while novelty worn off back mediocre cost cutting measures  <EOR> Horrible   food small portion high price service uninviting   Would never back again  <EOR> The food typical Cheesecake Factory stuff tasted ok but more expensive   burger overdone long shot but ok  drinks where really you  VERY expensive $18 mixed drinks $10 Coronas etc    If happen seat patio then eating justified because nice view Bellagio fountains great action strip but otherwise you're just eating more expensive more crowded Cheesecake Factory  <EOR> I sat bar dinner since restaurant packed which didn't matter since I'd chosen bar anyway  The bartender fast take drink order then just speedy food order  Service great! The atmosphere nice classy but very dark  Our drinks world  sexual chocolate drink which strawberries chocolate   amazing  boyfriend ordered peanut butter cup martini which just amazing  Although $14 little pricy drinks delicious absolutely worth it! I ordered Mac Cheese Lollipops   pretty good maybe bit dry but definitely edible ate every bite  boyfriend's burger the best he's ever had  and says lot!

Salad included arugula feta lots dressing options  Highly recommend sharing shake come huge skinny steins  friend some kind entree omelet believe  Great late night eats! <EOR> Food great! always crepes there's favorite  also tried appetizers such Creamy Artichoke Spinach Dip Crispy Chicken Bites Bruschetta but came small portion  Pretty cheap appetizers mostly 9 bucks  food came decent time considering place usually busy but calling waiter very easy because always getting new customers  can't wait come back dessert again though! <EOR> Always fun time sitting bar Sugar Factory  last Friday night another couple  ordered blow pop martini hubby ordered blue ocean goblet  dry ice goblet which bubbling keeping entertained  bartenders easy talk fun watch while made drinks  atmosphere hip mid 20's mid 30 crowd  second time both times didn't disappoint  back again next time  <EOR> Absolutely love food here! always must when coming Vegas  favorite dish Salmon  <EOR> Was really looking forward trying place out  Heard lot good things except service wise but still wanted try it  Lived standards crappy service   Our waiter never once checked food served except drop check off took forever cash out  brought check cus just wanted asap   I ordered French toast friend ordered steak sandwich mid rare  Half mid rare other half mid well  friend enjoyed plain French toast more sandwich  Although could made same French toast wonder bread  best part meal French fries   The food mediocre best  Typical over priced under portioned strip food  <EOR> I Sugar Factory bachelorette party  place busy enough service suffered bit due high volume  waitress though great good personality holding things down through busy atmosphere    Food The food decent pizza good  However $15 good  $15 pizzas does hold water when comes quality ingredients personal touch chef  price jacked food should cost $7 $11 starting $9 10 $15 $20 more  know Vegas since nothing real prices high  Because people good time burn holes wallets    Service Outside service waitress terrible experience rude hostess General manager Earl believe name major difficulties properly dealing incidents occur  called rude host asked name reservation party number  He asked 12? corrected only 9 maybe 10 originally  then directed tables given menus ordered drinks  Good times! Then 25 minutes Rude Hostess comes asks your table? party 12? course since seated host affirmed table  She then asked name your reservation under? friend bride told name  Then she walked away  First all handle situation  She obviously did know going on  Maybe host sat gave other party's table wrongly  she deal among fellow co workers attack just walked ourselves stole table served without prior incident interrogation  Maybe she trying impress other customers supposed table because she couldn't admit mix up? way she approached all wrong very offended    When bride then asked manager explained situation  She J D  mind sharp mind most accurate memories anyone know she repeated verbatim Rude Hostess said  manager replied saying he sorry he would talk hostess see happened  Which course made friend ask if he didn't think incident any concern happened  He repeated he going ask hostess see happened  communicate resolve problems  Sure those customers come lie things  He course came back gave excuse she customer just wanted find why sitting when she thought saw reservation other party  wtf?? never questioned she doing said rude disrespectful  He just apologized  friend directly asked he could experience better since mistreated  He responds already said sorry four times  Wow! all he had  mean he should comped something  because want fish freebies but because don't come business establishment pay staff rude us  he practices kind rude behavior trains staff way he just poor manager difficulty managing    So gave star waitress 1 2 star good decent food but full star over pricing  another 1 2 star service again since host rude other was  rest stars missing because General Manager does know deal accountability create safe fun experience customers when things don't smoothly  <EOR> I hope place gets better age   serves food 24 hours which need late nights work   However service AWFUL   hostesses cranky   wait staff seems first time and yes more few times    food comes weird orders co workers ice cream sundae coming before appetizers   waited good 10 minutes water when she finally brought water she brought try full glasses slowly placing full glass down then picking empty never filled glass off table   took entirely long   Where water pitcher?   I cheese pizza   Hard wrong there   wasn't great but late night food did job   also ordered caesar salad which over dressed couldn't eat it   husband liked jolly rancher cocktail   hear all candy type cocktails great but wasn't mood     Oh Kim Kardashian seated just leaving if care sort thing  <EOR> I think would enjoyed visit Sugar Factory much more if A  able order off breakfast menu WHY places stop serving breakfast 11am Vegas?! no sense B  Grabbed some confections way out    I tired hungover desperate need some carbs when girl friend hit SF way town wasn't pleased wait 20 minutes table only see many open tables immediate vicinity  But whatever moving on    Service fine nothing horrible but nothing write home about    I ordered signature burger $17 which came scrumptious white chocolate bun  burger itself good but arrived tomatoes requested them left off cooked well done when kindly asked medium rare  friend ordered French dip which she seemed enjoy spinach artichoke dip starter good enough chunky runny all lost Sugar Factory kitchen    Lunch girls including alcoholic beverage each appetizer two sandwiches came little over $70  wouldn't say no return visit if someone suggested but no hurry rush back  <EOR> I'll start veggie burger   BEST IVE HANDS DOWN!

The sliders fries worth all $4 dollars  Bread spread Angus burger burnt cheese bread  No tomatoes pickes even lettuce  whole thing dry hell! OMG why kitchens insist upc harging Angus slider burgers? fries didn't come side but same basket sliders if  always arrive   My friend burger which looked good costs same flavorless sad sliders   With 24 hour cafe every hotel Strip wouldn't back Sugar Factory  if paid me  <EOR> Came whim while walking strip because heard goblet drinks  night still young maybe 10p wasn't horribly crowded    We sat high table bar already idea going order  sat while waitresses pass fair amount times but no service  actually stop them say needed order something  ordering maybe another 10 minutes before drinks  think only bartender making everything let wait time slide bit   There 3 decided share drink  alright  pour your table watch fog but wasn't extraordinary  Taste wise sweet taste but expect place sells candy haha  However price didn't quite fit experience  $40 drink it's size 2 5 normal drinks mind you but still bit steep opinion   Overall probably wouldn't again but might worth experience if you've never try  <EOR> Loved it!!!!!! 21st bday June 12th 12am  ocean blue goblet plus Reese's strawberry blonde martini! all die for! must try if you're Vegas  only reason giving 4 stars cause made reservations ahead time patio seat first legal drink strip view n when said couldn't unless ordered entrees   dumb think spent enough money drinks alone where added multiple entrees but owell! <EOR> Go fun drinks fun atmosphere  Food mediocre  won't top Vegas cuisine here  just mediocre decent priced food  come cool smokey drinks fun atmosphere  <EOR> My friend ended Friday afternoon because didn't want wait table Serendipity   I guess service hit miss   hostesses looked 4 them welcomed smiles sat outside right away   sat few minutes before someone came poured water handed menus walked away   10 15 minutes no coming table pulled guy aside asked where server was   He ask someone else maybe another 5 10 minutes later she showed up   say booklike menu sitting along sidewalk some people watching helped pass waiting time    just bit   After she finally came table service great   I chicken club sandwich enormous   break down layers eat them separately   friend kept insisting going buffet couldn't finish burger he ordered think he only through half it   But both good   We saw another table order Goblet decided confirmation alcohol it   lollipop servers recommendation plus wanted big lollipop candy necklace came it   drink actually came before friend came back bathroom she actually waited pour drink table til he came back give little show    bc we're tourists that   That thing delicious but felt teeth rotting all sugar y ness   pretty full actual food didn't drink much   gung ho friend did best probably gulp two left   Food sugar coma ensued afterwards   I satisfied Plan B  <EOR> The menu much smaller expected which food choices fun whimsical limited drink dessert menu  would well served expand menu across board entrees drinks desserts  Great service okay food atmosphere  just feel place could much better few improvements  <EOR> Sub par service sub par food above par prices wife both felt going vomit hour eating here  more could ask for? <EOR> Goblets 5 5  totally expensive but can't argue cool factor  very dramatic sweet delicious goblets   Food 2 5 food's disappointing  par say   TGIF chili's  Definitely worth money  even pizza disappointing  just hair better cafeteria pizza  would strongly advise against going sugar factory food  dessert drinks  ok just kidding  just drinks  desserts very good either  <EOR> One best steak ever had   I didn't even order it   just stole few bites BF!!! beautifully cooked just melted mouth   I house burger which delicious well  Tons toppings fries well seasoned  cocktails pretty strong too!

Thanks Mike! Would definitely come back <EOR> Came dinner night long trip Grand Canyons   husband staying Paris hotel since only 24 hour restaurant hotel thought why not     We really bad service bad food   took long time food come then when finally did wrong dish   took another 20 minutes them bring right dish when came pasta undercooked hard!!!  point livid   manager did come apologize assured meal would ready within minutes was   finally right   The only pleasant thing say dessert amazing   some sort red velvet cake ice cream monster   humongous delicious   also cut bill half happy that   Hence two stars   Overall restaurant loud dim lighting   opens right Sugar Factory store candy sweets galore!  yummy candy apples adorable little gift boxes   planned buying some dinner but forgot since upset   Bummer! <EOR> Bad service started hostess   No smile no enthusiasm felt she against will  Server seemed annoyed when asked questions menu    Walk 20ft Mon am Gabi better food service  <EOR> Always wanted try place because well advertised all celebrities always talking place  did see three famous people however didn't know famous  Eek   but pictures taken  star struck person really care celebrities  just us   normal people! = Anyways ordered restaurant 1  Spinach artichoke dip pita chips The spinach artichoke dip bit salty but artichoke very refreshing cheese overwhelming  pita chips definitely accentuated dip! Crispy light without any salt added them!  2  BBQ chicken pizza Thin crust pizza which love much! pizza even anywhere near oily! plus! loved but bit rough tear apart  chicken bit dry sauce bad  cheese fresh good   3  Smore's crepe The crepe made perfectly because nice crisy however bad thing drenched chocolate syrup which made crepe soggy afterwards  should put more graham crackers though because then would balanced out  marshmallows chocolate chunks just mouth watering! Yes did add vanilla ice cream top $3 more best decision!   The service terrific would deserve five stars!  Overall think place ok best though  plus side restaurant always open! = FYI careful ordering water   tastes tap  Also didn't table made marble course whatever place table everything would slip slide  every five ten minutes hear utensils falling left right back front  floor made mini tiles chairs move much every time try adjust yourself  ladies please careful especially heels because almost fell twisted ankle due slippery tiles  think need change because very scary  However decor very chic cute though! <EOR> I don't know thinking when decided eat here  should asked myself question before entering could candy store possibly skilled making food? even failed making good dessert which surprising since called Sugar Factory American Brasserie  SUGAR name restaurant could mess that?  I frozen hot chocolate  Powdery exciting all drink worth ordering  appetizers table ordered just ehh   spinach artichoke dip served pita chips  dip itself sour only finished because starving   Service whatever  waitress lagged giving dessert  She came over table when asked dessert she surprised look face admitted forgetting putting order  Dessert most disappointing part  don't know if because wait long time but chocolate fondue? just tiny pot melted chocolate kept warm little tea candle the candle surely wasn't hot enough keep chocolate liquid state   toppings accompanied interesting    gummy bears? future think Melting Pot chocolate fondue   This place oddly reminds Cheesecake Factory but little pricier less appetizing food  <EOR> So because Britney Spears licked lollipops place tax hell people? Everything menu overpriced  ordered couple drinks both $16 each tiny  fondue dessert came very few things price most dry no flavor stale tasting  worth $60 purchasing groupon  OH saw pretty Christmas lights blue red while here  Cops pulled right along LV Blvd lights suddenly turned inside Sugar Factory into night club  long episode COPS good  wanted start playing bad boys phone  Once po's took off place turned back into supposed be  Overpriced boring  plus side seated window where could see water show Bellagio  <EOR> Came lunch possibly brunch table next having pancakes which looked perfect am coming back breakfast soon  steak salad which delightful steak perfect charred taste just top bed baby greens caramelized onions other goodies coworker Monte Cristo sandwich which didn't taste but looked delicious  did try fries those some awesome tasting fries  portions huge prices LV strip standards salad $18  dessert strawberry shake which came recommendation server just okay little sweet but decorated nicely gummy strawberry whip cream strawberry syrup but definitely order in your moneys worth shake to go half size when order tall beer looking glass place packed good ambiance seating perfect people watching  <EOR> My husband ate dinner tonight 9 pm  little disappointed most breakfast items weren't available until 11 pm but we'll just try again another day  sat immediately chose eat patio  dining room very noisy outside much more peaceful faced Bellagio fountains  enjoyed people watching a c dining room seemed come outside bit temperature perfect    Our server Ruth she said first day but she great wouldn't know otherwise  started bruschetta appetizer which delicious but tomato mixture piled way high taste ended least half still plate  chicken waffles awesome  fried chicken cooked perfectly maple butter I think top waffles also chicken  definitely order again  husband steak frites said good although he isn't fan skinny fries  full dessert but definitely another trip try future  <EOR> Headed Sugar Factory famous drinks celebrate 30tg birthday  Decided Lollipop Goblet couldn't even tell alcohol but strong delicious  dry ice candy made even cooler  Quite pricey though $36 but when Rome    <EOR> This those instances wish half stars available don't know Sugar Factory quite deserves four stars but think better three stars   I've twice now separate Vegas trips  first visit brunch year half ago but seem skipped review time  recall meal good   I returned Sugar Factory dinner Friday night  boyfriend Vegas weekend friend's birthday began trip meal here  finding 30 minute wait table decided keep seats bar order there    The menu quite extensive but baked mac cheese caught eye  love homemade mac cheese not Kraft hopeful dish would satisfy carb craving  Plus just driven six hours rain San Diego nothing sounds better rainy day something hot oven  Thankfully dish's flavor did disappoint  dug into edge bowl everything hot delicious  But boyfriend took bite middle found just lukewarm  He bartender's attention she quickly took back kitchen brought fresh piping hot mac cheese within minutes    My only complaint $17 seems little ridiculous pasta cheese even Vegas  also upgraded include two slices garlic bread $3 extra but didn't think bread good very garlicky    We also couple drinks beer pink moscato which both $8  moscato perfectly sweet bubbly! <EOR> 1 star friendly attentive service   2 star large portions decent price  3 star all food tasted great  4 star really excellent time enjoying meal even 2am   I steak frittes damnnn best tasting steak ever had!!! <EOR> Im doing rating solely based drink cinnamon toast crunch   It actually tastes it!!!

Even though he offered take care next time don't think there's going next time   Although food superb many other options Vegas offer great food great service  <EOR> The hostess Sugar Factory very friendly welcoming  service hit miss usually miss  Today sat close 25 minutes before offered water  Then 15 mins water  guess when sitting long more observative server 3 tables close proximity table 3 woman served faster table older couple  only thing brings back food service  <EOR> The Sugar Factory candy shop closed when late dinner but fortunately able sit main dining area Brasserie which connected candy shop! wanted some desserts but only saw cocktails drinks breakfast menu  You'd ask dessert menu  S'mores crêpe  super chocolatey topped mini marshmallows best part drizzled caramel! crêpe itself slightly drier Sawtelle but only VERY SLIGHTLY whole ensemble perfect medley sweet fruity  Add fresh berries vanilla ice cream additional 3 bucks because they're worth it  crêpe pretty decent sized definitely share another person   I also ordered French onion soup dessert strange choice dessert know xD   soup itself smaller side like side soup but tries full off soup anyway? thick layer yummy white cheese looked mozzarella but could wrong cheese expert  don't much soup small amount soup bowl beyond salty!! kind expected because French onion soup before different restaurant salty but kind much actually glad soup wasn't big lol  It Monday night midnight place still packed dining drinking customers  might little hard flag down your server when place busy try order ask things all once  service pretty good though  Also known bigass goblets candied gummy candied cocktails  Most tables around those  look mighty awesome! would probably stop goblets next time  <EOR> I've never Vegas visited Sugar Factory dinner  tried mac cheese pops which pretty good but best fried mac cheese ever had    steak sandwich however world  Truly top 5 meals life good  also chicken fingers appetizer those delicious too    The real reason however steak sandwich withstanding goblet drinks They simply outstanding  lollipop white gummi ones favorites such fan shark bowl but just VERY candy flavored  personal preference thing  any case least 8 shots each goblet they'll messed jiffy even if share and really should they're HUGE     It's definitely really fun option if you're Vegas group girlfriends want reasonably priced for Vegas anyway nice dinner before going out  also great romantic dinner boyfriend before going show Absinthe wonderful time  <EOR> Love place! atmosphere awesome server really nice  She came checked table throughout night even stayed chatted which really nice  She felt old friend  Drinks delicious food really good  love location Town Square fact didn't deal lot tourists congestion strip  can't wait back again! <EOR> Okay know Vegas its party town yadda yadda however seriously loudest place ever eaten life  loud waitress yelling all night just could hear her  decor swanky romantic but romance last thing your mind when you're almost sitting your neighbors lap  Its unfortunate many tables crammed into place because could actually enjoyable space  Now bitched lack any kind enjoyable ambiance lets food  Five Stars ! Really food top notch pretty large variety choose from  Sugar Factory open 24 hours course find lots Breakfast Lunch Dinner items  Simone choose savory crepe stuffed full fresh grilled chicken sauteed mushrooms artichokes topped off creamy Bechemel Sauce spinach  other ingredients overshadowed taste mushrooms If love them then you'll love this  spinach oddly piled top crepe making rather messy unusual presentation didn't add anything dish  meal ordered Mediterranean Parpadelle Chicken Pasta extra two dollars side garlic bread frigging Vegas charges dish much better then expected probably best pasta dish past few years   pasta tasted fresh cooked perfectly el Dante  Red Pepper infused Olive Oil Grilled Chicken Artichokes Tomatoes Olives Feta cheese all married together perfect hot salty food orgy  dish nice bite oil left wanting more  finished off rather large portion ease  Unfortunately did try any dessert yes know its called Sugar Factory don't care headache starting best tired being yelled waitress away went   food gets 5 star's ambiance gets 2 stars Overall its three  <EOR> Yummy!

The service decent   felt server hurry out   He didn't even ask if wanted dessert   restaurant empty don't know why he gave bill early shift just started   I'd come back drinks snack some appetizers enjoy water show Bellagio across way  <EOR> Very good service great food baby back salmon great flour less brownie fresh raspberry banana shake great desserts portions large portions split items can't eat all anyway <EOR> Expensive food sucks? business friends  ambiance nice fun but food didn't deliver  bland nothing expected plus paying arm leg it  No thanks but those giant cocktails they're pretty neat  <EOR> Had breakfast Sugar Factory Brasserie morning   wanted sweets but thought breakfast more prudent maybe would room crepe afterwards   checking large menu open faced fried egg sandwich   pretty good but really expected exactly   did say skinny fries menu but didn't realize would smothered them   little dry until ordered extra gravy   But overall good flavor   probably would pick something else next time     The husband ordered BLT he said great friend ordered chicken waffles HUGE   give LOT fired chicken both she husband helped big portion said very tasty     For those three items iced tea bill $56 before tip   I found portions large flavors good   service okay but restaurant pretty busy some serious gaps time between sitting ordering receiving food   definitely back but next time going start sweets!!! <EOR> I actually really liked place     My friend shared 36 Oz white gummy fishbowl drink   really liked it   lot previous reviews say waste much time money but if think $1=1 oz   lot martinis Vegas $7 6 8 ounces alcohol plus ice good deal   also read can't taste alcohol   Which bull  definitely tasted alcohol first sip    rambled alcohol because    well    Vegas   But foods good too!   Club sandwich 3 slices bread which bit excessive opinion but once removed liked sandwich   The service nothing brag but BAD  <EOR> This place just ok me    Cute environment sweet idea but food looked sounded bit funky taste  Shared breakfast pizza containing bacon cheese  good but great  wish weren't stingy added all meat groups rather sausage bacon ham  don't really OR  <EOR>   Accidentally reviewed restaurant candy section yelp copy pasted   ate few times would possibly give place 3 stars if weren't service   last check in worst experience ever!   So 12 hr nightshift few nurse co workers decided breakfast    decided try Sugar Factory @ Paris Hotel due recommendation friend   arrive last already see rest group party 6 waiting lounge area seated table    couldn't help but notice other groups getting greeted then seated promptly   We take look menu awhile we're hungry we're already talking we're going order much here   Seconds turn minutes into half hour    No table   Host front right next does check see doing nor update us   People dressed business suits come receive warm greeting seated   We eventually and good us decide leave Bacchanal breakfast buffet instead   Good  move part   give menu back hostess don't even ask wrong try stay apologize anything    Unfortunately because lack service attention Sugar Factory lost 6 customers probably more no longer recommending place anyone  <EOR> Terrible service     ever somewhere just want end all while sit table waiting??  Quite unfortunate however really nothing else say experience   did eventually order food however no drinks which quite bizarre till worked out     We also eventually saw some food     3 4's given service issues may mentioned but few bites there   Needless say didn't actually eat food time take business elsewhere     Good luck place if choice waste your money here   many other better options within crawl don't understand place stays open    boo     <EOR> I going give place 3 stars but when sat down write review Meh first came mind gets 2 stars since literal description Yelp give 2 star rating   Anyway    came 3 time during trip Vegas   Once just shakes candy kids   shakes prety good but definitely worth $10 each   Then came brunch groupon   Again nothing special   Food mediocre priced high   Service ok teriffic  crowded place could affect attentiveness staff  underwhelmed but forgot use groupon back again before heading home   Once again nothing special nothing delicious nothing terrible   Still $10 shake $30 coctail albeit huge $25 chicken waffles obviously homemade isn't worth it   many more quality places eat Vegas those prices  <EOR> Had Sunday brunch yesterday birthday celebration   worst experiences while   know say If good time tell person but if bad time tell 10 those instances   The main reason came bottomless Mimosas   service slow any given time half table did any drinks  Unacceptable   serve Mimosas very tiny 3 oz  glasses  mean come on    thats three gulps     The server could sense semi annoyed then gave little attitude   defense she serving 5 7 other tables   But still   3rd round Mimosa 90% orange juice 10% Champagne   busboy take drinks away hopes next round would stronger   10 minutes still drink less   asking three more times three different people busboy walks says alcohol those drinks  What?

Well here's do charge advertised 5 bucks gelato then tack mandatory 8 1% sales tax then take total tack 3 5% more call CNF  Yes tax food now 11 6%!?!?!  Such B S  just increase your prices 3 5% everyone knows paying instead tacking mystery charges   Breakdown your 1 star rating 1 star substandard gelato 1 star bad service 1 star overpriced rubbish 1 star mystery fees  Overall Sugar Factory FAIL  The quest continues    <EOR> This really cool looking restaurant sweet shop killer location right strip view Bellagio fountain show But some issues   1 incredibly slow  Even if come time isn't packed which most time takes seems long your food order  most recent visit alone ordered sandwich look 30 minutes   2 Price  place wicked expensive is  food good but amazing  But apparently paying atmosphere location because simple sandwich $16    Drinks control if stray away anything other iced tea sodas  milkshake run $8 10 more depending put it  cocktails ridiculous  Most $15 more if order goblets you're looking $40!  As food quality fine  sandwich little dry but tasty  milkshake expensive but awesome bug chucks peanut better chocolate chucks   But kind expect desserts better food name Sugar Factory right?  They massive dessert menu incredible options  all crazy expensive well $5 small basic cake pop $10 fancy decorated one but say each items far really good even though some slightly sweet rich taste buds   Bottom line If want great food elsewhere  If want fun place desserts drinks don't mind paying extra atmosphere great option  <EOR> I friends brunch Saturday   arrived around noon wait over hour table   completely packed   would recommend reservation calling ahead if interested eating timely fashion     Their menu pretty small traditional treats   find basic eggs plate along burgers sandwiches   service slow side   realize packed but would think packed regularly timeliness should little better   I would skip restaurant just enjoy treats bar  <EOR> I given place two attempts  first time should just learned lesson  pretty fruity drinks taste candy but half filled martini cost $16  paid less EVERYWHERE ELSE  Also goblets deceitful    $40 logo glass but cant keep glass  BUT if sugar factory bar Planet Hollywood keep goblet  Hmmm! Eating dessert ONLY reason come here  looks really alluring outside but pretty 20 something girls hire typically into having job    mostly just talking front    The food overall pretty flavorless service absolutely awful if any sort time crunch elsewhere  view patio Ballagio water show Froot Loop Pannacotta earned place its 3rd star  pannacotta legendairy    see did there? use froot loop infused milk it! Yum!  But seriously  If looking place breakfast lunch dinner    elsewhere   If its 3am just left Bank? Come here! wont taste anyway  <EOR> If you're going movie just tired shopping passable nice drink although expensive drinks but eaten food twice neither time very impressive  Most recently wife patty melt frankly better most other places  bread only toasted piece sandwich  only warm  barely saw any grilled onions meat dry  came french fries while crispy only lukewarm  really worth effort  left another restaurant dessert coffee  wouldn't likely bother again even though Town Center quite frequently   I give credit very nice looking server  She very sweet attentive great behind  <EOR> we ordered chicken fingers club Caesar salad everything good   chicken fingers really well made nothing pre made freezing bag usually get   Service great  Reason why getting 5 stars? Appetizers menu limited  <EOR> Came shortly before blackout stage some food few drinks   Forgot credit card due said blackout bartender helped himself giant tip   Didn't receipt when back card early next morning   Gotta love Vegas  <EOR> Came lunch past weekend during random Vegas trip   place looked really cute menu made food sound pretty yummy but kind pricy was   What ordered french dip sandwich pizza burger steak frites salmon don't remember exact name but came asparagus waffle came fruits chocolate whipped cream ice cream Chinese chicken salad     Out 6 people sat table only 2 somewhat satisfied orders both them ordered dishes sweet taste   waffle chicken salad     Fortunately ordered salad although good wasn't bombdiggity   salads other places less trendy expensive tasted same better   did try french fries came french dip although into fries those some salty ass fries     Would come back?  Maybe dessert but actual food    pass  <EOR> The atmosphere food ok   companion's pasta little undercooked but club sandwich delicious several other items menu looked tempting   They variety drinks centered around candy which thought cute   only cute but two people thought very good   think only thing wasn't pleased overall price but expected high demand location strip   I back bring town guests me  <EOR> Drinks nostalgic fun  But expensive   But charged cmf fee irritated me  If want charge more drink put price menu  <EOR> We wandered around Sugar Factory's candy store first day  wasn't until next day realized restaurant too  Three shared Lollipop Passion fishbowl size cocktail 3 giant lollipops couple candy necklaces   also shared some tasty chicken bites somewhat deconstructed cobb salad  <EOR> They open SUPER late which PLUS Vegas  eat around 3 4 morning ordered BBQ chicken pizza Caesar salad  pizza tasty would eat again simply due fact open into wee hours morning night whatever! salad less mediocre waitress forgot half order maybe why she working nocturnal shift instead during busy hours   say give try  <EOR> The food definitely tasty but tasty fine dining high quality sense   reason food great opinion because sugar main ingredient EVERYTHING!  ordered Signature Burger which white chocolate bun   When bit into burger could taste sugar bun   said delicious   But when actually took look burger eating could tell low quality   would compare cheap frozen hamburger patties grocery store     The alcoholic beverages menu really interesting unique but extremely expensive   couldn't bring myself indulge can't comment further   I really looking forward dessert because love sweets   ordered Chocolate Torte complete surprise did love it  Flourless chocolate cake absolute favorite but extremely thick sticky sweet fault   actually felt teeth started hurt couldn't finish it   other diners party Milk Chocolate Mousse Bar hot fudge sundae   bite Mousse Bar seemed less sickly sweet Chocolate Torte but much   All all definitely place healthy meal    but could probably figure name restaurant   Decent but obstructed view Bellagio fountain mist keep cool while eating outside upbeat youthful music played throughout inventive unique if expensive alcoholic drinks    feel establishment pricey quality food serves but away prices due unique experience offers customers   If looking better quality alternative Paris would recommend Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis   same price range but higher quality food  <EOR> this place cure any woman's PMS  would lie fellas?

I've separate occasions grub  last time steak eggs  delish rib eye beautifully cooked order!  I banana split while back very large delish!   Overall prices steep paid $70 steak eggs place omelet bloody Mary two mimosas menu variety keep coming back portions just right  staff friendly yet see crowded centrally located spot strip    Can't wait come back! <EOR> I mixed feelings place   Food decent but definitely over priced  Didn't any drinks which seems main appeal here  Dessert however impressive mean panna cotta    The restaurant itself very nice looking pretty spacious spread fancy black chandeliers such look very scale  Yet same time seems attract very   different type clientele! People looking drink entire punch bowls alcohol exact  mean Vegas everyone wants wasted that  But don't understand place charge $40 drink don't even keep those gigantic goblets? seems ridiculous me   Anyway food average but nothing special  group ladies came right around brunch time couple breakfast others lunch  Another girl ordered carbonara two girls ordered pretty basic looking $13 omlettes another classic $15 burger decent fries   Everything alright but strange thing two carbonara dishes received looked totally different  seemed bigger portion other top covered green peas while other dish didn't much green all  definitely stickler consistency when friend mentioned discrepancy waitress she just brushed off Oh well yours just tossed   didn't really explain size difference but clearly she didn't want deal us  Customer service obviously forte   While dish did look better needed more salt pepper since pretty bland  ended doctoring myself more palatable  $17 pasta dish though should better was  never understand people charge much probably cheapest foods is  C'est Las Vegas though guess!   The fruit loop panna cotta redeeming dish great flavor consistency but still don't think would return future  just many other worthy restaurants Vegas even Mon Ami Gabi right next door would better choice opinion  And if just really want those drinks into Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile  There's counter serves Sugar Factory goblet drinks keep glass!!!  Why would ever come restaurant beyond me   maybe people just want sit same seats where celebrity asses been? Meh  <EOR> went daughter husband birthday dinner   we 2 special goblet drinks   they good but pricey   son law beer $10  yikes!

Sugar Factory constantly changing menu its starting annoying  ordered crispy buffalo which horrible hoping buffalo wings use have  also ordered bbq chicken pizza which dry drench ranch  server didnt come over time check while constantly keep asking busser extra things needed  server finally stopped table when flagged down even then took 10 minutes check  She didnt offer ANYTHING until time pay give tip  Ha  <EOR> This review only Lollipop Passionfruit Gobblet   After recommendation co worker decided must try gobblet drinks when drop Vegas   husband ordered Lollipop Passionfruit Gobblet share   drink huge but wasn't cold all even much ice glass    flavors nice but something would keep ordering future   waitress ok but she forgot water asked for   ask couple times before water   Overall decent place drinks but would prefer drink cold since hot desert  <EOR> A kid candy store    literally    such cute store!! modern day contemporary chic mini Willy Wonka factory  space itself humongous but selection items unique    Anything could ever imagine here    Marshmallow shooter? Check   80's style lunchbox 80's candies? Check  Sea Salt Caramel Gelato? Check  Tutu's little girls? Check  Lip tattoo's? Check  Mugs lunchboxes other souvenirs? Check  Snazzy swanky cute clean contemporary decor? Check  <EOR> Yay!  opened Sugar Factory!  super excited visit place   Sugar Factory located along strip outside Paris Hotel     Memorial weekend crazy Vegas sugar factory PACKED!  Although sugar factory glitz glamour gelato station feel better candy stores more variety     I store within 5 minutes b c just wasn't surprised amused any items sold except $25+ blinged lollipop geez pricey!    If sweet tooth try visiting Serendipity's outside Caesar's Palace Max Brenner inside Caesar's   leave feeling much happier <EOR> Looks nice outside but food amazing all   Water free I believe charged $2 $3 filtered water    fetuccini alfredo which tasted premade canned sauce grocery store   quality food worth price  <EOR> I several times because awesome groupon deals just say place! ambiance great  always sit porch love seeing bellagio water show all different people walking strip  drinks always yummy food although best ever kinda pricey good  really hit miss food  burger which fantastic! bbq pizza good ribeye tasty perfectly cooked salmon however dry Lacking flavor  fried macaroni appetizer very yummy!!

You're paying overpriced ok tasting waffles chicken strips sit top   maple syrup side   $23 expect much more this   know paying convenience location but pretty unacceptable     The bite pasta tried completely undercooked   If mine then would gone straight back kitchen   Nothing special French dip   Overpriced crappy food non existent service  <EOR> To begin first gave place bad rating due bad service way food served    But came back today given best service when mean best service mean Vegas life would see movies billboards  made reservation seated immediately giving name  Usually takes while seated even if made reservations  Other beverages served immediately well  Goblets greatest drinks tasted  way served pretty colorful full sweets! Other serving beverages food served quickly! didn't take 15 nor 30 minutes  took 5 10 minutes  Also host kept checking back which very kind    Next thing would comment food  steak amazing  chewy tender  side mashed potatoes greatest mashed potatoes ever tasted  dry mouth watering  also comment fondue  love milk chocolate sweets provide side    Third chose sit outside  say scenery beautiful  Which gave more Vegas life feeling  few people amazed Goblet drinks asked if able take picture  Eating outside made more relaxing enjoyable  ended staying good 2 hours    Overall now suggest give place shot  changed whole perspective  Come check place out! Thanks General Manager Errol Taylor btw Tom spectacular service! <EOR> I'm shocked celebrities find hot spot unless Sugar Factory uses celebrities order promote name which most likely case    Out whole experience best thing atmosphere  obvious large parties accommodate seating nice view water fountains Bellagio across street   I would suggest even smartest trendy tourists avoid place  Everything candy sweet theme which unique itself interesting a twinkle flavored alcoholic drink? What? but obviously classic tourist trap overpriced food and beyond overpriced! didn't see single thing under $10 food even drinks $7 up  good variety menu almost every category think salads soups chicken pasta pizza burgers etc  server told drinks half off happy hour  Apparently drinks half off *bar* area restaurant area  whole time under impression all drinks menu half off ordered root beer cocktail $14 might add wasn't bad   When think you're getting $7 because someone assured half off see your bill $20 including gratuity large group night you're definitely going issue it!  The manager very nice making adjustments  Apparently buy free even if wasn't half off restaurant never second drink  Food nothing special better elsewhere over half cost  fries ordinary friend said pasta wasn't anything exciting price he paid    One high selling points goblet drinks but they're $35! Personally didn't see hype all about  guess if money burn place seems another fast food restaurant rich  <EOR> i love its open 24 7!   Great atmosphere food amazing desserts!! <EOR> Made reservations 11 people Friday night   place very cute fun atmosphere   sat right away   drink menu extensive lot fun   ordered 3 cauldrons drinks all which sweet but delicious   lollipop favorite   Also tasted Swedish fish very very good!  appetizer spinach artichoke dip really good   ended ordering another because finished first fast     The food came fairly fast every ones looked really delicious   prices all reasonable ended leaving $50 person including tax tip   pretty good deal   turkey brie crepe perfect glad portions big drinks!  also tried pasta surprisingly delicious    I would def recommend place large groups if your looking reasonable prices  <EOR> Great place high energy  Walked bar taken car right away  Only French dip eat but really good  quality meet cheese bread spot on  decor dining room beautiful would def bring date here  Over great experience! <EOR> Horrible service!!! If u child stroller give u hard time  dot accommodate ppl strollers  Staff ignorant bec arent parents themselves dont understand  Last time heard ppl w kids send lot money candy places shouldn't underestimate ppl  order coffee wait minutes sugar!!! careless  prices location service should definitely better  waits 10 mins seated when appz 11 tables empty??!

Last time we'll going there   looking walmart prices strip but don't feel getting hosed lousy overpriced poor products services   We thought going groupon but wouldn't made difference   We'll passing Sugar Factory <EOR> I think Sugar Factory fairly recent addition Paris casino because don't remember seeing last visit 2 years ago   front corner casino near fake Arc de Triomphe split into two parts three if count outdoor seating    walked through candy shop part but didn't spend any time goal find if chance fulfilling long term Vegas goals Strip side dining   Usually visit winter when even Vegas cold eat outside dark   warmer times crowded table   But 11pm warm Saturday evening May found success!

Twenty five other tables choose even over already seated would nice   She just seemed care   waiter came exact same attitude hostess   If paying $16 burger expect excellent service  Long story short he sucked couldn't less apathetic managers need read reviews talk staff  seems running theme   food pretty good but good enough overshadow service  lack of  going back  <EOR> One worst service ever experienced  standing seated even when busy  hostess didn't greet anything when talked seat she told wait  just stood there  When seated didn't any menus  Took over 30 minutes them come order told them ready  When food no silverware  also asked hot sauce didn't it  ask check 3 times before it  didn't give pen sign credit card  asked several times too  Food mediocre  Never coming back  <EOR> I love drinks but food little pricey quality quantity   Although dessert absolutely delectable huge   banana split!  outta world   I highly recommend Jolly Rancher martini if your Midori Sour kinda girl  Gummi Goblet fun!  table 6 shared huge thing   Awesome drink presentation staff very nice accomodating   would come recommend pregame spot before club  <EOR> Made 6 30pm reservation arrived 6 15  seated bus persons attention served water that costs $2 00 btw   waiting full 45 min without any sign server spoke manager  Once spoke manger service did full 180 impeccable  only manager informed he would give party complementary dessert  impressed managers ability could terrible dining experience into very nice dinner out  food good worth priced at dessert we chocolate fondue amazing  atmosphere seems fine dinning feel without fine dinning menu  Over all nice place eat strip  <EOR> This review going short guessed sweet   If you're walking Las Vegas strip morning basking afterglow night fun partying come non traditional breakfast   Located right next Paris hotel Sugar Factory candy shop bakery little restaurant café all one   Julius walked curiosity when huge Reese's Peanut Butter Cupcake stopped dead tracks   headed bar where enjoyed breakfast consisting selections 2 major food groups alcohol dessert lol  Pommery Pop Mimosa a cute split bottle top line champagne OJ Reese's cupcake coveting   Unfortunately despite little chunk Reese's crushed Reese's Pieces adorning huge swirl frosting cupcake little bland dry did taste Reese's all   Julius just beer liked subtleness flavor though  if you're called Sugar Factory give bouncing off walls sugar!  think just ordered mediocre cupcake while woman next devoured Red Velvet   based dish alone dock Sugar Factory couple stars    Pop champagne biz though! <EOR> Not sure where everyone else eating but very under whelmed   price  just right   Food best average certainly edible but nothing worth going back for   Unfortunately VERY expensive $10 milkshakes?  $18 hamburgers? those prices should serving REALLY good food    Clearly expensive since right strip   But place many other restaurants serving GREAT food just isn't right   Service acceptable place clean etc   But again lot better within easy walking distance   wish we'd just done Hard Rock something instead meal   If eating may well eat outside least checkout people strip same price  <EOR> We ended because outdoor Parisian cafe packed line onto street wait  place right next it   We told would 20+ minute wait table outside  sat bar drink coffee while waited took 15 minutes table   The Bloody Mary fantastic  they own spicy infused vodka but then used generic BM mix?? while tasted fantastic super stingey alcohol  Zero buzz achieved and lightweight    Their coffee AMAZING  amazing asked brand use because wanted buy some  No knew  bummer   The food decent middle road cost  expensive other places but cheap either  If try sit outside patio  <EOR> Don't eat drink here! don't believe bartenders cooks taste anything!

Still okay  Also might because Kardashians supposedly coming later preoccupied  Whatever   Anyway pizza burger french onion soup while husband plain burger  surprised soup best but definitely pretty good kind place  having odd craving glad see it  never order burgers restaurants but pizza burger intrigued me  sauce pepperoni cheese surprisingly good    Some drinks looked good but didn't try any   strawberries chocolate cocktail sounded interesting  Maybe try next time around   Those said simliar Cheesecake Factory pretty on par  stellar but shabby  <EOR> This place feels upscale soda fountain ice cream shoppe Cheesecake Factory like menu   Service bit slow initially   took awhile someone come over take drink orders but fine because menu pages pages long took awhile decide wanted   Service good initial lag  Btw came Friday night 1 a m  75% full when arrived most tables taken soon there  I ended ordering Pasta Carbonara absolutely loved it!  drink cocktail called Grape Crush   Though bit watered down very sweet tasted just candy enjoyed it   tried dining companion's fluffer nutter milkshake sweet rich thick creamy strong fluffer nutter taste other words delicious!!  table inside right patio great spot taking view Strip people watching   Overall really satisfied experience would definitely come back again!

Wait stop rejoicing   Where fries ordered? Didn't ask salad dressing side? Chicken N Waffles? Note use chicken tenders Chicken N Waffles    finally getting everything corrected dug right in  ham brie sandwich very tasty   husband's burger OK chicken tenders little dry bland   Because wait sub par service just opposite previous visits     I won't come back actual meal   But if return fun expensive drinks dessert remember ear plugs   *Yelp 100 Challenge Review 27 100* <EOR>
