This restaurant highly recommended me   tried combination plate but impressed  liked beef tender flavorful  chicken katsu dry   roll macaroni salad bland   But biggest complaint teryaki sauce   watery bitter   Maybe am used Aloha Specialities  California Hotel but impressed  <EOR> For some reason doesn't take same anymore   doesn't matter if chicken teriyaki beef   meat tastes if microwaved cooked boiled cook then thrown grill little grille taste   really need cook them fresh when customers order them   hope change way cook meats otherwise lose customer  <EOR> This best Hawaiian place town  agree other reviewers Kalbi best dry side   however plenty choices more 35 entrees menu choose more delicious options   I myself love affordability place really lot your meal   any numbered meat meal comes Miso soup macaroni salad white rice regular salad steamed veggies  especially love Maui chicken special tofu salad mango avacoado salad  all world!!! Salmon meat dumplings noodles also above average   This far best lunch spots town  would recommend dinner unless quick affair  the place fast food type atmosphere  However if looking dine style just want some authentic tasting Hawaiian food restaurant highly recommended native Hawaiian co worker Maui Rose excellent choice   P S  variety Hawaiian juices drinks snacks etc offered sale more difficult find elsewhere  <EOR> I really wish could give restaurant more stars but unfortunately nothing really sticks mind   The Katsu average even slightly dry side   The Kalbi average maybe slightly over sweet  All rolls remind rolls pick grocery Vegas Express Shushi  In fact only thing slightly peeks above average Mango Salad  Typical garden salad but mango chunks but nice zesty vinaigrette contrasts well sweetness mango There's nothing bad service always fast friendly just nothing really pushes over top into higher ranking  Recommended if just need Hawaiian food fix can't bothered Aloha Island  <EOR>
