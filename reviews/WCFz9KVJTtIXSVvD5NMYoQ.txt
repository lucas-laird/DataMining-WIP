Some appetizers entrees elsewhere but best restaurant were Crab Avocado Mango Stack Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail Coconut Crunchy Shrimp Prime Rib Fish Chips Hot Lava Cake Warm Bread  am sure all loved! <EOR> I really liked ambiance Chart House   comfortable contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled before eyes large tall tube type aquarium while dined   place sleek modern beginning two 6 foot hostesses black miniskirts appearing much human bookends confirmed reservation gave friendly greeting when arrived   aqua floor upon entry looked water which added sea mystique   Our first dish dramatic nice presentation true meaty jumbo shrimp shooting off steam dry ice   complimentary bread basket small but ample 2 diners contained good brown white bread well tasty rolls   New England Clam Chowder good but unusually crunchy celery while Diane dealt Lobster Bisque rather heavy brandy   Sauteed Mushrooms juicy side very large lasted all way dessert but sauce sizzling skillet tasty   However lovely chopped Spinach Salad egg mushrooms red onion was   particularly liked dish various parts presented side side fields color column yellow egg placed next column green lettuce forth   Then left diner toss all ingredients fine dressing together desired which found fun rather annoyance   I then enjoyed good pan fried pink Salmon enhanced blanket crisp prosciutto while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder   know because tried too!  But Flounder originally brought table sent back because first batch spicy spouse's delicate palate   appreciated request less spicy breaded Flounder cheerfully accommodated although took awhile new entree cooked manager personally brought replacement made just requested   also shared side great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes fine Green Beans presented plate   Our dessert Chocolate Souffle properly risen good but expected receive   real airy  more tasty meringue sumptuous souffle   Service impeccable!  attentive service error very competent female server   fact worst thing occurred happened days meal when all photos food but lost failed effort store them backup drive   Hence single photo appears review   But least photo taken just slew dishes placed table   first only time photos Yelp review totally lost before loaded restaurant's site   May last! <EOR> Soooooo disappointed!!! Supposed 5 * restaurant service sucked!!  even large group didn't appreciate business believe me!! manager didn't even care felt   He made excuse having white tablecloth because nice wood table  Bullshit! table looked leftover Bingo hall!  didn't even enjoy any bread water dessert!!  Poor poor service!! worth time place eat!! Check Vic n Anthony's now 10 ***** well worth time money!  Some say Charthouse discriminatory beware   !!! Wouldn't send worst enemy there!! <EOR> Lovingly atmosphere 75000 gallon tank over thousand fish romantic atmosphere wonderful service tonight coconut shrimp clam chowder beet salad little change Italian Eats lately eaten over 100 restaurants Las Vegas then every Hotel really need some more reviews <EOR> Best waiter ever had! Ask Harris!!!   We little late half hour before closed  very hungry wanted nice meal  hostess said fine sat across beautiful fish tank   Harris came introduced himself thanked coming in  He also made polite conversation he gave specials  Excellent suggestions couple appetizers two entrees  BTW try mango mojito!!!   Long story short Food great! Service excellent! Atmosphere wonderful! <EOR> Go figure    an outstanding restaurant hotel! think hell just froze over   Great food  Excellent service      great stop! <EOR> The 75 000 gallon aquarium over bar main draw visit Chart House recently since higher end Landry's property thought food would exceptional  Unfortunately case visit  I started soup sampler while clam chowder good gazpacho lobster bisque underwhelming  waiting around 40 minutes pan seared scallops entree questioned bartender he admitted he forgot tell kitchen  appeared 10 minutes later seemed fresh but scallops slightly undercooked browned enough me    Overall decent dish price paid but memorable  Possibly fresh fish options better some dishes standard menu  I'll come back try again soon also enjoy fantastic view fish tank <EOR> Went lunch Gwen visit Vegas  place really nice!  Located inside Golden Nugget but gorgeous fish tank right center   Food nice!  fish chips Gwen coconut shrimp   Really good shoe string fries   You also soup side salad but passed that   I would definitely return eat place next time town    <EOR> My wife came Christmas eve 930 amazed awesome attentive service Paul crew  made night just much more special  All food cocktails dessert came timely manner Paul very personal us  would recommend calamari which tossed kimchee sauce why decided craving months now  also ordered prime rib wife seafood dish  ended night chocolate lava cake which good  also tried house made peanut butter ice cream which its self good rich lava cake though  defiantly back would definitely recommend place all celebrating occasions  <EOR> Service awesome   sat front Aquarium great view   Drinks good along appetizers which oysters mango crab tower   seafood variety dishfor entree just alright but still give place 5 star  <EOR> Eating fish while watching fish swim by? Sure why not!  We started crab mango avocado stack  ridic  Very good  Just watch those hidden jalapeños! seared chilean sea bass stuffed crab lobster because duh  orzo came delicious fish good  definitely 30 pounds butter but hey vacation! date cousin macadamia crusted mahi damn good too    There many things menu wanted eat but neither stomach nor pocketbook big enough fit them all in    The prices definitely little steep but wanting treat ourselves when Rome or well Golden Nugget !  Watch giant green eel  He eyeing dish  <EOR> Was served very helpful enthusiastic Harris   He suggested some very good dishes specifically mahi mahi shrimp scallops   Both delicious   chocolate lava cake great  <EOR>
