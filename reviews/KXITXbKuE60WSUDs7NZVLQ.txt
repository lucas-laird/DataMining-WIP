Great   Stunning!  visual presentation spot on   With mouth watering smile face picked half sandwich leaned first bite     The result?  Simply put texture bread wonderful   pillowy ciabatta   then caught taste chicken continued bite   perfectly seasoned just right amount salt spices   split second heaven     Then hit chicken   should say teeth hit chicken   Initially thought bitten into toothpick some other hard object   stunned learn not   texture chicken!  Tough leathery  almost jerky like  I grind through each bite chicken pieces until finished sandwich     Should gone no further bite just simply sent back? suppose could done but job demand served quality sandwich   Rather kitchen's job nail first try     The kitchen served sandwich got   ate it   truly disappointing admired your work culinary giant many years   almost great sandwich but chicken     Regards Tom D  <EOR> Table 10  Hmm     Three yelp stars  expected more guy face hot sauce bottle pantry  six sunday evening  basically place ourselves  service impeccable but having worked years server expect nothing less slow night  started wine appetizers  hard wrong wine when stepdad picks and buying matter   Calamari escargot nothing write home about  calamari weird texture almost wasn't quite done aioli bland  even more disappointed escargot  Hardly any flavor all  filet other hand cooked perfection  Although long don't overcook filet good without any help  smashed potatoes best ever had  No dessert  Didn't see stood which shouldn't hard do  ambiance great except way bar set up  Every time bartender set bar down behind loud made jump  also loved all open kitchen spice shelves emeril needs more rack apparently although thought Costco size tub Zatarains seasoning weird yes know he's New Orleans   things other     would back but would top list  just felt little let down famous food network guy  <EOR> on Feb 12 2014 going Sushi Samba    but very noisy saw Table 10 next door decided forgo Sushi Emeril's place  short review Food 10 10 Service 10 10 Value 10 10  Note ended doing 4 course 45 thought everything delicious Fresh atmosphere perfect     not loud boring just nice place back  <EOR> We most terrible meal service Table 10 past weekend   wanted take parents somewhere nice 36th wedding anniversary   should known trouble when only 5 other tables guests 7 30 PM   quite sad learn wonderful creole menu attracted completely changed day however notified change when confirmed reservations   Our server completely unprofessional   When questions new menu repeated told he sure menu new   all confused why he could pass questions chef but he did not   The final straw when asked type nuts dessert special am allergic SOME nuts he indicated chef busy answer any questions kind nuts dessert should just order it   Oh really   thanks   At end meal spoke manager also totally unprofessional he just gave excuses why service poor then gave examples accommodations made others food allergies which made feel terrible since  same courtesy extend me   I returning suggest skip Emeril restaurant none Emeril's flavors left  menu except some mediocre gumbo  <EOR> R I P O F F  The service excellent very major pro   However expect when pay $100 person   Better comparables include Morton's Ruth's Chris Mastro's Fleming's   heck maybe Lone Star   Seriously still can't figure theme goal place other great hotel pictures Emeril's food everywhere   Pass  <EOR> Dined solo low key sports bar joint Palazzo   friendly bartender made hostess' arrogance   Fair wine selection but limited menu options especially if vegetarian   design nice fun able watch chefs preparing your food appears very clean kitchen   burger 3 bean salad nice glass white wine everything tasty but wouldn't bother dining again unless happened hungry standing outside  <EOR> We tasting menu  great deal if want variety food  barbecued shrimp lobster bisque mushroom gnocchi sensational  <EOR> did 4 course dinner well some problems Chicken Andouille Sausage Gumbo BAD simply bad   poor flavor luke warm  junk   its good when your first course sucks    a few people Roasted Pumpkin Soup thought decent Candied North Country Bacon avoid nothing special   sugar oven   simple   waiter said top seller HA sad Smokey Mushroom Pasta great sauce but pasta way under   know emeril likes pasta bit under but just gross son chewy heck    if again id Emeril's New Orleans BBQ Shrimp over pasta great huge shrimp  plump great seasoning    Emeril's Pork Chop pretty darn good   bad server sucked didn't ask everyone's preference   med well done   sauce great   bad issues serving sizes MUCH LARGE SMALLER    Braised Beef Shortribs pretty underwhelming   again sauce pretty good but could braise short ribs home   avoid Filet Mignon $5 additional charge damn good  tasty small well worth +5 dollars Desserts fine   overly sugary   pretty good  i issues service pacing   Service fair best place pacing SUCKED   Also stupid able bring correct desserts party 8     what really bothered saw chef chilling bar   just staring into entrance   back kitchen your job   if meal good great then fine lurk around   NOPE  for 50 head would somewhere else   honestly just upgrade your standard higher end chains   nothing blew away except maybe shrimp filet   better places dine <EOR> After disastrous unwelcome experience SushiSamba over Table 10  world difference  Great ambience fantastic food absolutely delightful server Rafael  <EOR> Omg shrimp bisque want learn this   Fantastic!  maple candied bacon ok very good bacon just didn't fit rest meal choice fault   filet perfect just perfect   Price wife including cocktails actually better then would expect   Can't comment desert since full eat took us   highly recommend Emeril Lagasse gem <EOR> Wife each 4 course $45 special  Serving sizes apps slightly reduced but still couldn't finish everything still plenty food  variety great especially price    Gumbo BBQ shrimp bacon Cesar salad good any dishes anywhere  Dining bar great service pace  peach chicken juicy flavorful dark meat but meaty breast  never order chicken nice dinner but really good would recommend    Did mention roasted bacon appetizer? use thick lean cuts apply brown sugar cayenne pepper then roast  Served maple dipping sauce really unique good  tad spicy side but worked me    If anything wasn't '10' I'd say skirt steak  very good lean flavorful but elsewhere  Since 'only' 8 really underscored great rest dishes were    Finished chocolate mousse which also very good wife lemon bar which she said top notch    We may stay Venetian next visit Las Vegas but absolutely come dinner Table 10  great  Emeril came New Orleans roots passion style cooking come though 1000% Table 10  <EOR> I came pretty low expectations being Vegas few days quite mix good bad meals well lot overpriced meals    As famous chef owned restaurant Emeril kind expected overpriced gimmicky but pleasantly surprised    The restaurant itself nice server very knowledgeable menu  He also only said BAM! time  I four course meal best meals while  highly recommend option price very reasonable $48   espresso martinis also great gave little kick stay awake rest evening   If you're looking somewhere eat Vegas don't hesitate come here! <EOR> Solid food solid service solid wine list  yourself favor order king crab legs rib eye steak  11 12 ordered all glad did     They accommodated group 12 semi private indoor patio giant round table believe when tell large round table hard find Vegas  yet another great restaurant Vegas must experienced  Cheers <EOR> Creole cooking familiar found Lagasse's Table 10 perfect introduction  flavors robust but overwhelming  Mahi Mahi other Yelpers agree definitely home run  also able try Pork Loin which executed nicely   Tip Many reviewers noting entree portions huge  can't say agree  While definitely small they're southern cooking portion congured mind when read that  little stomach might able enjoy shared appetizer dessert   and did first Banana Cream Pie nice finish tasty meal  <EOR> Reasonably priced average cuisine good service  bit underwhelming being Emeril restaurant but accessible option easily accommodate large groups   Friend really enjoyed Colorado filet mignon which came beautifully paired spinach potato puree served red wine sauce    Wasn't impressed kobe beef shortrib beef semi grade surprisingly tough  Served sauteed spring vegetables potato puree    Service friendly enough attentive  Restaurant surprisingly empty Thursday evening  <EOR> This probably worst restaurant ever Emeril  The service attentive but food just doesnt match other Emeril's dishes   pasta which dry sauce wasn't exciting special   Angus beef burger simply boring Very disappointed  <EOR> This Emerill Lagasse's restaurant know its going great!  bartender mixologist award winning featured national magazines   mojito world   UNBELIEVEABLE!    waiter recommend dishes dead on   outstanding food experience   combinations different but crazy   server guide all best   literally brought husband tears  Two exactly   mojito marispalla dessert  <EOR> This place actually quite amazing   server Frankie really made 4 star food atmosphere 5 star experience   He top everything even sent someone buy rice cripsy treat give buddy birthday cake     The bone in filet delectable   I visit again when am Vegas   price reasonable service quality food received  <EOR> 3 5 stars Table 10 located Palazzo Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas restaurants   restaurant sits little shopping restaurant area Palazzo good distance away casino   The decor eclectic but over top   dark space mostly dark browns hardwood floor high bar stools half booths walls etc     splashes color though well prominent but ghastly decoration   overhead light fixtures modern alternate color blues yellows    Lots design throughout room patterns bar seat cushions backs booths   Also table tops decorated multi colored tiles   Some metal decoration including wrought iron spiral staircase center bar which think heads nowhere   The complimentary bread brioche roll which pretty good   crust much crust  kind crust normal dinner roll   pretty good soft flavorful brioche center well butter   I started Seared Maine Sea Scallops Crispy Fried Leeks Lobster Tail Salsa Provencal   Las Vegas restaurants tend very overpriced but felt actually could charged more dish   price generous portion seafood scallops lobster    quality great too   scallops nice caramelized sear tender moist inside though scallops little gritty    lobster tender sweet    The fried leeks great seafood   very crisp but oily greasy   Good onion flavor   sauce base plate consisted oil tomato olives the olive flavor very strong    sauce little bit spice it   sauce bad though best flavor did think complimented dish the seafood stood fine itself    My entree seared tuna crispy corn cake over tomato confit base   tuna portion small though lunch dish    tuna good   Nice sear outside rare center   crispy corn cake crunchy outside sweet corn center   tomato confit base kind warmed salsa big fan the sauce really reminded tomato sauce Xiomara Melrose maybe cuisine style just    While tuna good everything cooked properly resulting flavors did really together well   I think disappointment both sauces flavors lot due each dish flavor ingredient stood much  olive starter tomato entree and necessarily best flavor representation those ingredients    could just matter preference   did use very good quality seafood ingredients could see dishes might appeal more others   Service good   waiter soft spoken polite attentive   Food came good pace   I never Emeril Lagasse restaurant before know stacks other locations   lunch ingredients use better some other Vegas restaurants serving lunch same price range   definitely some positives might worth trying if fan Emeril Lagasse or curious food    I walked but imagine Palazzo complimentary valet self parking other major Las Vegas hotels casinos  <EOR> What colossal disappointment   inflexibility tasting menu utter inedible quality some food place most uninspired underwhelming Vegas   Sure expectations high but no doubt Emeril would appalled quality food had   won't ramble but bright lighting bad radio music playing room clashing mall music playing mall Treasure Island place needs away start again  <EOR> Nothing worse spending much money food regretting before leave your seat $40 lunch app lunch plate  don't mind spending forty bucks but never regretted much there     Overdressed salad dry chicken  hungry hour later  better room service food 3 star hotel   Normally would complain everything expensive Vegas  But lackluster enough prompt return home write review 2 days later   Not good  <EOR> In opinion better lunch place dinner  being said Mac n cheese gumbo amazing  Most every dish tasty free bread quite fantastic! <EOR> A friend lives Vegas know all restaurants strip and elsewhere suggested meet lunch Emeril's newer spots Table 10 opened December 2013 since Sands Expo business close by   She raving Banana Cream Pie   Hmmm exactly favorite but sure let's give try   We both ordered quiche wow huge portion could should have shared        Drumroll Banana Cream Pie absolutely delicious!  fresh cold frozen graham cracker crust whipped cream flavorful very little if any sugar!  highly recommend going your way try slice share slice did! <EOR> Actually lunch prices very decent  gumbo awesome ribs  tried friends plate he ribeye sandwich portebello mushrooms  Yummy he wasn't fan homemade Worcesterchire sauce but really liked it  <EOR> So disappointed service  16 people dinner two separate tables entrees served 20 minutes apart between two tables pork dish dry dessert wss late  <EOR> We visited Table 10 only because Palazzo lunchtime there  dining room empty apart other table  servers very nice despite fact busy  ordered lunch special which vegetarian pasta dish prosciutto pizza  food arrived quickly tasted great   Not sure going Table 10 dinner much menu fancied but lunch fine  <EOR> I excited try place when Vegas  difficult find some reason under impression MGM    I ordered Lobster Mac Cheese Jambalaya  surprised see Jambalaya noodles instead rice even though server raved filing looked watery  But he right really filling really good! Lobster Mac Cheese okay worth trying  But wouldnt again   The boyfriend ended getting Roast Chicken believe  side kind rice but tasted pancit filipino noodles   chicken really juicy really really good    For dessert shared Creme Brulee believe  good but wasnt worth finishing   The waiter very friendly helpful attentive  enjoyed experience here  <EOR> great experience other night food excellent  but server seemed little off when asked specials no life excitement descriptions whole ordering process seemed way them  want thank other server however she very attentive actually asked if needed anything more just once  think name tiara tiana great job! <EOR> Love Yelp! free Sangria food conversation drinks great ended Vegas trip  <EOR> We Yelped Table 10 steakhouse Palazzo full   place half empty early evening Friday never completely filled up   Possibly because service excellent attentive refilling water second offering warm fluffy rolls  refolding napkins during bathroom breaks   little things nice when unexpected   My friends filet mignons $40 which delicious carnivore delights   opted double appetizers same price $15 each    half rack Kuronuta baby back ribs very tender right amount slightly spicy sauce pickled corn top actually pair welled ribs   mushroom fettuccine I think fettuccine? delicious cream sauce light although some might think many mushrooms which like    The Frangelico crème brulee AMAZING   custard filling just right consistency sweet   balanced rich caramel burnt crust goodness   surprised find layer baked hazelnut chocolate bottom which unnecessary bit dark chocolately taste   birthday girl also free coconut ice cream which good but merely understudy spectacular crème brulee   As evidenced young couple came just dessert Table 10 definitely place impress date good service delicious food amazing desserts     merely impress your stomach  <EOR> Rating based food 4 Stars Rating based speediness service 2 Stars  It's shame give only 3 stars  Food great!  Service wasn't bad but painfully slow   comped drinks slow service which nice them  <EOR> Love trying new restaurants when visiting Las Vegas first time Table 10 thought great!

We party 6 only 2 dishes memorable    Amongst multiple starters 6 entrees side veggies     says lot ones eating experience   Our server recommended seafood stew pasta dish me   terrible    Overly seasoned salt pepper very heavy sauce nothing special creole style dish   Others variation fish chicken porkchop risotto dish       The pork chop probably only edible dish thick cut moist   think risotto other decent dish    But disappointed seafood stew basically left thirsting gulps water    tame acid eroding palate couldn't bother sampling it    Thankfully bite pork chop before diving mine   calamari salad starter best    Watch chili peppers!

ready go  staff split all items which nice surprise  enjoyed Smelts butternut squash appetizer continued onto awsome mushroom soup truffel cream  Wow! rest meal just plain great topping off House Special Bannana Cream pie pineapple gelato which complementary Anniversary  gladly recommend! <EOR> Quite disappointed especially Vegas standards even moreso being Palazzo  Made 8 30 reservations weren't seated until 8 50  Reservations made reason especially Saturday night table soon there When asked seating hostess table she just looked annoyed told would ready soon  When finally did sit down table all way corner when plenty other open ones  waitress very sweet first immediately took order no problems  friend both opted Piri Piri seafood pasta one Emiril's CLASSICS but then decided since both wanted we'd just share it  asked waitress if she could split said wouldn't problem  bread appitizer salads came very quickly but nobody came clear plates away when refill water likely because table all way corner    When food finally came 30 mintues later waitress put down pasta front side dish sharing  pasta dish seafood  can't just hand side bread plate then say split pasta yourself  proceeded ask waitress if perhaps chefs kitchen could split 2 seperate bowls like I'd originally asked especially since friend opposite ends table  She looked I'd asked something unheard took plate back kitchen  She returned 2 seperate bowls 5 minutes later angrily dropped them front walked away  When thanked she just walked away  really disappointed service  then told manager happened she offered free dessert which did want agreed comp pasta dish  While very nice manager still very disappointed service ended being late next engagement evening    Despite terrible service couldn't help but impressed good food was! <EOR> When come escalator approach host stand don't know but incredible smell comes table 10 insane   Excellent service prompt thorough courteous without being cheesy all  Very professional   I scallops  Perfect  4 plump scallops paired Spanish almonds grapes capers  very small plate $40 but best scallops ever had  enjoy every bite   Hush puppies guilty pleasure  2 3 chewy  1 3 over salted  Disappointing   Tiramisu excellent  Fresh balanced salty pistachio brittle   Open kitchen concept which always entertaining  Very Vegas   Overall excellent service mostly tasty

Notes Inside Seating Parking Garage <EOR> Flipping amazing  Everything tried menu absolutely fantastic  service great atmosphere relaxing  highly recommend visit reservations  <EOR> So going Las Vegas could eat some higher quality food   chose Emeril restaurant specifically other three restaurants Vegas because only listed Bananas Foster's dessert menu   love Cajun recipes Food Network figure should good   also read offshoot original restaurant New Orleans which really want try came high expectations      To start husband ordered bone marrow brioche also braised veal cheeks   three bone marrow bones but 1 3 barely filled   He said bone marrow good    but very very rich he said he couldn't eat lot because heavy    salty but edible    but funny enough gave additional container sea salt?  braised veal cheeks some carrots mushrooms   good still salty but liked probably enjoyed sauce mushrooms more actual meat     For main entrees husband ordered suckling pig side truffle mac cheese   ordered seasonal monkfish tartar sauce fried vegetables   monkfish just sautéed but incredibly salty inedible   Even tried mellow tartar sauce but still salty numbed tounge   vegetables coated tempura but over fried just tasted salty popcorn   Any taste nutrients fried vegetables   Husband said pork good    mildly salty but anything write home about   He send back truffle mac cheese   macaroni overcooked mush grease   no cheese flavorless macaroni just tossed truffle oil alone   breadcrumbs just sprinkled end baked     Finally long awaited bananas foster which waiting for   brought plate scoop ice cream 2 fried bananas split lengthwise   server poured sauce top tableside   sauce completely separated   liquid dark soy sauce sank bottom   clear liquid sitting top presumably straight liquor least  1 2 inch deep   took scoop incredibly bitter   fluid watery  if liquid hadn't flambéed all   should caramel color should thickened slightly because combined sugar   guess could just eaten ice cream alone but point?  wanted bananas sauce   give waiter some credit he did waive items did but expected more   summary high expectations Emeril but really disappointed let down   Everything excessively salty   guess down actual chef executing night but Emeril really needs spend some time QA'ing dishes name it   P S  would given 2 because service alright but following days husband's stomach right he sick days excessive amounts grease bone marrow  <EOR> We ate last day Vegas wished I'd gone favourites instead! kept seeing advertisements starter entree $20 some named chef though we'd try but really disappointed  I gumbo although salty lacked any real depth flavour despite sausage couldn't even finish it  Followed roast chicken which also ok  best part little gnocchi accompaniments even then only ok   My partner salad burger both bland sweet bread gave starter really strange   Service minimum standard would expect Vegas  <EOR> My husband ended Table 10 chance while wondering around Palazzo trying find place dinner   good news most people eat dinner super late strip no trouble getting table normal dinner hour around 6 00 P M     Service bit slow first but then better   busy sure problem was   I'd say waited good ten minutes order drinks   dramatic improvement   I mixed reviews offer food   expected better cocktail sauce served oysters   fact much better oysters more reasonable price next day Palace right off strip    husband's salmon world excellent  the best ever tasted   other hand gumbo nothing special   disappointed because Emeri'ls BAM thing   gumbo definitely lacked BAM factor   Thankfully saved dessert   ordered scarfed down White Chocolate Malassadas which little donuts white chocolate inside cinnamon sprinkled outside   Oh            God!!!!  Yes good  <EOR> I believe something good happens places when famous chef takes over because then reputation line turn quality excellent  Table 10 excellent every sense  service obviously very friendly professional  Very nice bar great selection drinks  food great course even more surprising amazing creative appetizers were  some varieties cold crab small dish great aioli sauce  But presentation amazing wanted take picture  fillet steaks cooked perfection beautifully prepared large clean kinda open aired kitchen where watch chefs magic  Definitely worth try if your Vegas  <EOR> The food wonderful!  salmon great!  seabass ribeye steak jambalaya pasta also wonderful   wait staff friendly even give taste something menu courtesy chef     I guess someone told them bday gave birthday strawberry sorbet thing GOOD     WONDERFUL   EAT   Totally worth your money! <EOR> All all pretty disappointed  Service started off very slow place 1 2 empty  Took 20 minutes nail down drink piece bread  candied bacon great novelty would recommend it  Beet salad light fresh     off hook but good  Loved pistachios  Butternut squash lacked flavor rather doughy  Short Ribs very good nice sauce appeared sweet potato purée  salmon couscous bland undercooked  Trust love sashimi sushi  entire dish lacked any flavor  wife ate fourth it  Believing restaurant only improve if honest when ask food let server know when she asked  She offered bring something else declined  Taking off bill would right move  puff pastry filled white chocolate wonderful dipping sauce great  All all come bacon desert  think celebrity chefs open many restaurants lose control over quality  BAM! Once enough  <EOR> My wife decided nice dinner before Blue Man Group show   going dine Sushi Samba but wanted check place across way   thought items menu prices reasonable decided give try   each ordered Cactus Rose Martini off drink menu when took first sips surprised good was   Very fruity light refreshing   Could barely taste alcohol but knew because could feel few sips in      For main course she Cordon Blue pasta which surprisingly good   Special which petit filet mignon small lobster tail included mashed potates light wine sauce pieces chorizo sausage   Though filet lobster bit undersized still tasted great wasn't overly stuffed end   chorizo sausages mashed potatoes plus added different change flavors plowing through spuds   Service exceptional waiter very attentive busser refilling waters every chance     Would return Yes Would recommend others Yes <EOR> An Emeril restaurant   and good others Las Vegas San Francisco New Orleans   The highlights barbequed shrimp red fish   Decor very interesting   Enjoy! <EOR> Beyond amazing staff service bus boys  four course meal starting chicken andouille gumbo followed candy bacon filet mignon flourless cake  Everything splendid  waiter great attention detail awesome  3 times already never disappointment  <EOR> Good service  Good menu value  Great food  gumbo fantastic  Mushroom pasta pretty darned good  candied bacon must  short rib very well executed  bread pudding also very good  Highly recommend place if your area  only wishes butter hadn't ice cold impossible spread would liked seen some more Cajun dishes  <EOR> We 5 pm reservations because 7 pm show Wynn  let waitress know she really good keeping track made show time  Also way many people waiting necessary  said really worried food might crappy because rushed schedule  wrong!   Appetizers ordered crab cakes calamari  calamari good but wondering where sauce till waitress noticed brought it  then ready main course 2 min away  crab cakes good but avoid cream sauce surrounding it  sauce just made crab cake heavy    Main course Everyone loved food  table 11 little everything  try rehash remember    When food came thought looked little small but didn't even finish food!

When you're Vegas prepared fork couple extra bucks good food   Table 10 unique style   supposed somewhat fine dining place hence location Palazzo Hotel shoppes but same time supposed casual dining well     The prices aren't high Emril's other fine dining places such Delmonico's but course low fast food n out  *chuckles*  After friends see Jersey Boys met them dinner around 9 45   close 10 but gladly welcomed in     First bread came rolls warm soft!
