She really rude said order menu  understand don't special orders but there's nice way saying it    After food brought no came check even once  chase down bill chase down credit card pay bill  very unpleasant experience!!! <EOR> Although airport food great   menu super generic pizza way much crust very basic ingredients   Would expect more place specializes pizza  <EOR> I disappointed find location doesn't bring bring bread first other locations  ordered bbq chicken pizza which usually order other locations $15 for personal pizza least bit impressed  Service also slow  Wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> Terrible  Horrible management  Dirty  Menus old dirty  garbage left inside them when handed us  Food horrendous  pea soup consistency inedible  chicken dumplings made outside vender  Wife's Caesar salad good  Service ok   All all food way below chain's reputation   Add dirty worn menus know  terrible management behind all  <EOR> Le matin du retour pour Vegas je cherchais un endroit pour déjeuner  Ce restaurant de pizza servait le demeurer  Dès pizza déjeuner  J'ai bien aimé mais le Cafe n'étais pas assez fort pour moi  Trop dispendieux pour ce que c'était  Excellent service  <EOR> Ill give three stars warm edible food place sit down   pizzas highly forgettable but mostly edible overly expensive   service lousy everything bit dated but its better Pizza Hut Sbarros! <EOR> My husband stopped breakfast   son girlfriend ended same concourse joined us   staff happily rearranged tables nice window side view    ordered omelettes breakfast pizzas without meat   Substituted fruit potatoes    Food good  Only complaint only single toast slice but relatively thick slice big deal    highlight visit interaction server Guillermo   He just right amount taking care without bothering us   Joking us    Even last set refills go    I'd happy back next time LAS  <EOR> Ate California Pizza Kitchen Las Vegas airport  Surprised establishment such low rating Yelp because very pleasant experience here  margarita good better even some bars to  Hawaiian pizza  Very good! Nice crispy crust  Plenty ham pineapple  wouldn't mind eating again  <EOR> I would strongly avoid LAS airport CPK even if you're CPK fan! First off restaurant normal CPKs  menu different food different  Hawaiian pizza pretty sure only smaller but used different ingredients and or different preparation well  just didn't taste same CPK before   Second service awful concerned hygiene food safety issues  coworker avoids dairy products due allergies asked salads minus mayo  salad came mayo anyway which coworker found poking salad fork  When notified waiter he first acted wasn't mayo it coworker again poked salad fork show waiter mayo waiter huge attitude let exasperated sigh before taking dish away   The waiter checked something system no more 30 seconds he'd removed salad table delivered another table! couldn't believe it  bad enough restaurant would redeliver dish waiter already put another table but actually redeliver he seen friend use fork in! friend hadn't actually eaten any salad ever put fork mouth but waiter sure didn't know that!  I flagged down another waiter complain manager but none came before leave catch delayed flight  don't know if waiter just ignored management just doesn't care  Based experience though I'd wager latter  <EOR> Probably most disfunctionable places ever eaten  Bartender nice seemed try best but literally over poured every beer point overflowed base under tap overflowed bar into lap  NICE  Other man behind bar could only assume manager also could pour beer  Bar top half full although frantic if place packed although not    Everyone seemed bit mad each other  Everyone bar top also very thrilled service attitude employees terrible   Pizza ok  Similar small microwave oven pizza freezer    I would come again  <EOR> What pleasant surprise see CPK airport serving breakfast      I early morning flight back east coastand time breakfast stopped omelette   omelette potatoes delicious   Totally hit spot through long flight   waitress really nice well     The downside     totally unexpected   newish Salt Pepper shaker combined salt shaker pepper grinder   coworker totally drowned egges salt accident   careful those especially if low sodium diet!  I can't speak lunch dinner service   great service but early busy   server checks early could head when finished she kept water glass full    I'd again breakfast heartbeat  <EOR> Oh dreadful    Eaten many CPKs don't know let bear name    review service poor attitude because left 20 mins without any acknowledgement waiter   did twice ask 2 other waitresses gossiping service area if could order but told wasn't table waiter must busy    Meanwhile only half tables occupied rest being piled high dirty dishes 10am breakfast time way   left decent food good attitude  Starbucks go  <EOR> Stopped early lunch airport location Terminal 3 noticed many signature dishes missing menu  used California Pizza Kitchen regular when lived Texas am pretty familiar menu  Many regular CPK dishes pesto pizza weren't learn't franchise location finally settled Veggie Pizza which looked oddly familiar  When pizza arrived much smaller size which didn't mind however didn't look taste any signature CPK pizzas  pretty sure came straight box frozen section  crust tasteless underdone over all texture taste left much desired  veggies wilted clearly fresh  Could barely finish it    The service rushed understaffed equipped deal convention crowds  server working patio section he running around doing best    Stop drinks if need place chill charge your devices wouldn't recommend meal  <EOR> Got way delayed vacay trip San Francisco ended catchin' meal CPK McCarran Airport!  For chain usually don't mind CPK well known food should fairly consistent   though lacking food department   Perhaps airport environment messes quality bit?  dunno   The food overall wasn't bad but definitely lackluster   Just quality expecting CPK   only portions smaller used them salad pizzas barely OK meter   fresh could being CPK!  We ended having *California Cobb Salad applewood smoked bacon avocado chicken tomatoes chopped egg basil Gorgonzola house herb ranch dressing  *Thai Chicken Pizza grilled chicken breast peanut sauce topped crisp bean sprouts carrots scallions  *Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza cremini mushrooms pepperoni spicy Italian sausage fresh basil Mozzarella Greek oregano  Did already say serving sizes small side?  wondering why pricing particular CPK smidge cheaper full sized CPK restaurant   did answer!  salad definitely came smaller bowl pizzas definitely looked near inch smaller diameter normal CPK   hungry!  Our California Cobb Salad barely shareable 3 us   OK but lettuce just wasn't crisp cool could be   guess sit under heat lamp bit?  soggy few parts   bacon wasn't crispy well   The pizzas just OK serving size just normally expect   akin more personal pan pizza size least opinion   toppings sparse Thai Chicken Pizza well very little chicken much crust   Crust good but give more toppings please!  Not bad lunch McCarran's CPK but sure see its shortcomings restaurant   Service pretty good waiter did leave hanging though while when looking drink refills   Other par course   Not sure if would eat CPK again might better options money   your airport pizza game CPK! <EOR> Service good food came quick  glad few places such CPK stayed open later til 10 PM   Otherwise I'd starving plane no food service    The garlic chicken pizza yummy came 4 slices 11 99  asian chicken salad bit salty due sauce however  <EOR> Quality shouldn't sacrificed because airport location   CPK generally relied tasty food but location just sucks  you'll find limited menu unorganized waitstaff running around its hair fire no real reason  find better food airport don't let reliability associated brand name fool you  <EOR> The food good but service great! bbq chicken salad didnt know expect    But did fear would sweet bbq  Guess wrong thumbs up  Oh yeah also super fast  <EOR> It's airport location never expect much airport food but thought maybe chain restaurant things might different    First little round table small two remove all condiments etc room eat      Their breakfast menu small mainly egg dishes   egg over easy bacon potatoes wheat toast   husband two scrambled eggs sausage potatoes white toast   food came rather quickly but everything barely luke warm   butter wouldn't melt toast cold breakfast food just kinda gross   Should gotten pizza  <EOR> pretty good airport food  thia pizza super taste  <EOR> $13+ turkey bacon avacado     undercooked bacon reconstituted turkey bologna stuff micro thin avacado dry old chibatta bread similar   Why decent meal LAS airport?  free     Iced tea icky cloudy   Where toppings Pizza? See photo BTW only reason cheese pizza because paid extra seeing neighbors plate crust     Save your money grab pretzel    <EOR> I didn't expect much but  still surprised bad $17 salad was  bowl iceberg lettuce 2 oz cold chicken 3 pieces wilted romain tiny bit corn beans tomatoes missing corn chips  terrible! <EOR> I'd give CPK location 3 stars but service just awful down grade 2      I arrived early morning flight time kill  weren't lot food options settled CPK    being seated half empty restaurant probably waited 10 15 minutes anyone even acknowledge presence take order   Thankfully hostess gave menu really would annoyed     I ordered breakfast pizza decent size pretty decent   Overall happy food pricing considering any airport but service horrendous! <EOR> Overpriced food airport terminal?  live that   Crappy pizza horrible toppings?  Example Buffalo chicken pizza covered onions buffalo sauce      Give Pizza Hut Express over anyday   pizza terrible  <EOR> Pizza salty  Menu airport branch inclusive California branches  Expensive  wish arugula pizza  Sigh <EOR> Terrible   hoping place would beacon light very average airport  However does opposite  coffee undrinkable prep pizza  poor best food came cold   going send pizza back but didn't want wait another 30 minutes it  glad lot time before flight would missed slow service  somewhere else next time  <EOR> Service slow server attentive grumpy angry face delivered dinner literally threw front turned away immediately   Really?  Food ok don't expect good service however did notice other tables server pleasant could happen  <EOR> Save your money Rubys   omelette terrible  breakfast potatoes soaked grease soggy  did serve water service slow manager needs replaced  Rude! <EOR> This place sucks  4 items breakfast menu Denver omelette OK potatoes toast bad but service miserable  <EOR> We time before flight took off wandered into CPK airport  Unfortunately experience left much desired  took seat waited over ten minutes anyone show up  almost walked wish had  Once did decided place order case waitress never came back  very long wait drinks food order finally arrived  ice cold  Now maybe ice cold pizza thing Cali right now  But doubt it  More likely sitting kitchen long    It also took repeated drawn efforts refills drinks  being ignored quite some time managed wave waitress over  response rather terse rude  then managed nearby manager but didn't help  general seem care less customers  Perhaps all transients way somewhere else? seemed three ladies working front podium just waitress working all tables  general all around bad attitudes    We always leave generous tip but time left none  California Pizza Kitchen now removed list dining choices  Why? Because when wife tried express frustration waitress just argued instead  management should realize based majority reviews location perhaps change staff order  should start waitress  made call CPK headquarters gave them all pertinent information  those LV CPK location if can't serve your customers professional timely manner please job Federal Government you'd fit right in  <EOR> Always great place stop preflight cocktails food great service  favorite things flying Delta long haul D Gates  Sitting bar islands charge phone indulge favorite ice tea    FYI Long Island  Price aren't jacked normal California Pizza Kitchen prices great place Turn Up! <EOR> Breakfast bad  Coffee bitter  Omelette so  Potatoes Warner long hard crust hard could bite through it  Breakfast better somewhere else  <EOR> This California Pizza kitchen airport most likely worst service ever chain  ordered three eggs over easy WELL done potatoes sausage wheat toast  Specifically ordered no bacon  Waitress brought two eggs soft wad bacon  returned  Second attempt three eggs runny WAD bacon  Now ticked off! What's hard order  seemed lot tensions among personnel  Tables bussed employees running around chickens no head screaming yelling kitchen  mess  Clearly poorly managed establishment <EOR> I am tempted give place 4 stars service but food closer 3 stars  If could give 3 5 stars   Heather waiter night CPK location  two hour layover Washington DC she very friendly courteous  Service fast she checked multiple times   Food ordered Thai Chicken Pizza Red Velvet Cake dessert  CPK location limited menu but nevertheless soothe cravings  would also argue aren't many great eateries Las Vegas airport  CPK decent its food deserves 3 star  velvet cake actually pretty good  wasn't super sweet icing just perfect  pizza could improved felt could felt fresher time it  Total came $19 76 before tip including tax    Service give waitress Heather id #4020 four star rating  She very friendly helpful  She recommended velvet cake too  Service unrushed she took order relatively fast    Overall no problem CPK never felt rushed even though sat ate slowly killed time while waiting next flight  waitress great food all right especially considering airport   bad place kill some time instead sitting uncomfortable seats terminal gate  <EOR> Yes am reviewing chain restaurant world did stop spinning   credit though airport which only reason am reviewing it   If travel lot little thing sure    airport food typically sucks service even worse   last thing want before long flight bad food   figure help fellow Yelpers hung over Vegas   We heading morning flight wanted sit down quick breakfast   Looking around options figured would roll dice once more while grab something CPK   Well damn    actually decent!  First off service great   know all waiter but ours great   trust airport few far between!  food breakfast type pizza actually good   Holy crap!  hung over caring?  Maybe so    but expect 95% others looking breakfast same   Good eggs good crust coffee decent too   That all    unusual chain restaurant review me   But hell giving just rated $100 per person place 2 stars 3 mean something! <EOR> I love CPK but worst CPK experience ever had   must use different recipes something because BBQ chicken pizza which every time disgusting   chicken seemed undercooked something actually spit few pieces out   also split chopped salad which looked though sitting week   dirty dishes sitting several tables entire time there   No bothered clean anything up    weren't even all busy    Save your money sandwich Port Sub somewhere instead    very close CPK airport  <EOR> What expect Airport food? service very good though  <EOR> Worse customer service ever  fly lot also own store airport    I ordered pizza emergency call last almost 40 min  came  back restaurant pick pizza asked them heat never opened never picked said no  allowed  Why don't offer new then?

You've kidding me    You'd think service would faster considering people places but no  sat around another 10 minutes waiting pay bill brought check finally just brought them because hit boarding time    I would normally recommend another restaurant nearby but really aren't any decent options around  If eat just don't high expectations  <EOR> For love God would please close disaster restaurant open something Chick fil A even McDonalds  Waffle House would upgrade!
