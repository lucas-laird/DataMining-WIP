For first excursion shared 12 inch Steak Bomb grilled onions peppers mushrooms tomatos bacon mayo provolone large fry mom  ordered food upon emptying bag discovered rather large order fries think large McDonald's size cup yes bad Yelper should taken picture filled over brim   Our sandwich wasn't soggy bread still soft till last bite! never bacon cheesesteak before loved it! tried bite just meat found tad under seasoned perhaps ask extra seasoning next time?  I'm excited return try Cuban Maple Chicken sandwich's work way through menu <EOR> So really want place  sure if just because they're still working training staff what   I Cajun chicken sandwich  chicken itself tasted nothing remotely Cajun ever eaten  honestly tasted bland except enormous amount liquid smoke flavoring  agree other review cheese point but lack seasoning just made sad   The girlfriend ordered chicken bomb similar experience  She said just tastes bland oh also she requested addition sandwich wasn't put on   no doubt could've gotten something worked if we'd eaten instead getting go  The ingredients all fresh staff very polite accommodating  going back try something else menu though  <EOR> I absolutely love place! All hot subs made scratch right front you  delicious eat sub EVERYDAY  favorite Cuban but also love chicken bomb  Highly recommend!!!   That staff friendly nice  If don't know help find best choice    I love location because head healthy sub gym grab lunch getting coffee starbs <EOR> Came during test run! Interior clean looks just any normal sub place  Super friendly staff even handed complementary cookies! Quite attentive even while just sitting without ordering waiting rest party join me  definitely need invest some tinted windows some shades cover sun during sunset though ready blinded when crowded can't sit tables sides  Fries hot good! Mushroom steak sub alright tastes mushroom sub  <EOR> Super friendly attentive staff  Apparently friends family event but super nice honor free sub offer us  asked if wanted combo comped too  didn't tip jar instead asked come back next week during grand opening   ordered Italian steak should paid more attention menu totally missed marinara part   little saucy couldn't really taste all flavors ingredients which little disappointing  could probably little heavier salt perfect sub since boyfriend ordered steak bomb also agreed bit more salt would ok   Good thing condiments tweak your sub!  fries actually pretty darn good    YUM! Perfect golden color  great crunch them   Did forget mention subs served piping hot fresh soft bread!!  lot sub places dreaded dry roof scraping bread but place! <EOR> The sandwiches bomb employees kind!!! love new places Vegas this!!! <EOR> I found place today friend  Had Tuna made Hellman's mayo wheat freshly baked sub roll  Great portions You must give try neighborhood back soon   also fries salads  Give try won't disappointed  <EOR>
