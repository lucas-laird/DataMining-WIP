I started Classic Smash original cheese onion tomato pickles lettuce Smash sauce ketchup egg bun  onion pickles flavorful enough didn't taste special sauce  Overall burger seemed average really appreciated toasted bun   Next Signature Sin City burger fried egg special sauce grilled onions haystack onions cheese Applewood smoked bacon   good sounds bit rich wasn't able finish it   Many people may wondering why called smash burger    it's because patty smashed grill when being cooked sear outside seal juices in  apparently works because patty moist!   I good experience wouldn't mind returning having Avocado Club burger Truffle Mushroom Swiss   Create your own burger another option        should shopping?  Hahaha! <EOR> I only Smashburger 3 times   first two times meh but most recent visit disgusting   ordered Sin City Chicken no bun   supposedly 'grilled chicken breast' gray color tasted paste   disgusting could eat it   Luckily friend ordered veggie frites carrots green beans flash fried snagged few those   When employee came take plates she asked if wanted box   advised chicken did look taste right   She said she heard couple times today but offered nothing   knows if bad batch chicken if always that   pictures really don't really depict true grayness chicken  <EOR> Nothing near best  still would take In n Out burger over any day  Created own BLT burger w smash sauce smash fries   first bite burger good maybe really hungry   Anyhow towards end meal felt shovelling mounds salt into mouth between burger patty fries just way much salt   sure if taste going preference   good try but probably won't back when need burger fix   Two burgers two fries w drink totaled little over $20 hubby   price worth price red robin quality what's more par fit bill   To things more worse home see friend also tried spot way more worse outcome heavy salt     YUCK   Dear Smashburger Employees lighten your hand salt pouring please please PLEASE wear your g damn hairnets!!      makes appreciate cleanliness consistency In n Out much more  <EOR> Two Words = Fresh Quality   One freshest high quality burgers ever tasted   1 star = Great menu  menu variety options  thought would simple menu but fact more options your average fast food burger joint  even 2 kinds potatoes fries!

Yay happy! Smashburger some pretty high quality burgers far fast casual restaurants go  excited finally over try place    First off space way small Smashburger  don't know why thought could cram into teeny tiny space  would avoid coming during popular meal times because would nowhere sit  severely lacking seating space tables  Another problem huge windows mean more half seating made unusable when sun hitting them just right  blinded roasting solar rays  pull down shades but poor job blocking sun  layout place funky well fountain drink machine located weird corner causing big bottlenecks when customers trying fill drinks  Bonus points having Coke Zero though     The girl taking orders very slow confused but guessing just because place recently opened  always back few weeks see if they've ironed some kinks  kitchen FAST much faster any other Smashburger ever to  sort worried expected burger taste crappy order incorrect  but wasn't!  My burger exactly ordered good! didn't look tasty but tasted great  very happy  Most know low carb eater love when place doesn't blink twice when ask no bread bun  Sometimes difficult people understand burger comes bun anyway  SUPER EASY  fact kitchen even served burger two slices lettuce could them into bun if wished see photo   LOVED THIS!
