MGM Grand's food court nearest solution curb growling your starving belly?  You may step into food court Pan Asian Express may catch your eye  Wow could really some Chinese food think yourself  name might even remind something similar say   Panda Express?  Well if you've gotten far then S T O P  Take step back  McDonald's instead   This establishment worth your time stomach space nor money  paying tiny portions poor quality food  while wouldn't expect food court quality greatest nor Vegas prices cheapest   just disappointing whole new level   A single entree single side bowl nearly $10 TINY maybe barely enough child  bowl mixed vegetables broccoli beef while edible satisfying least  double entree single side plate much more worth price $11 but still definitely worth purchase all    In short short walk somewhere else Strip else you'll very likely regret it! <EOR> Grabbed quick bite before show Copperfield  food tasted good show     very mediocre also pricey    Basically knock off Panda Express but less quality many selections way more expensive one  Beverages expensive too  might better options MGM food court  <EOR> Love food here! service super awesome too  came long night some friends visiting town  plate fried rice orange chicken worth better Panama express lol <EOR> Went PanAsian express leaving fancy Chinese restaurant NYNY  Ordered normal plate noodles orange chicken employee nice enough fresh orange chicken which tasted great better Panda!   noodles nice hot tasty  employee also refilled sodas free  Overall great experience don't expect gourmet food just solid Chinese fast food    I very satisfied! <EOR> I don't care drunk are  Avoid place all cost  gross expensive    Don't eat here  Don't eat here  Don't eat here  <EOR> Had cashew shrimp chow mein noodles  noodles plain greasy  shrimp tiny cocktail breaded tasteless  maybe three cashews  threw away hotdog  <EOR> Came grab quick bite sorely disgusted   Pan Asian Express no Panda Express  food quality WAY OFF   We orange chicken mushroom chicken  both couldnt tell if meat eating fish chicken pork flour  Yes bland bad   The fried rice tasteless hard    Also service terribe  overcharged $10 $30 bill not mention overpriced thankfully checked receipt requested refund   Did finish food  Definitely coming back  <EOR> Not bad lunch option 1 2 3 entrees side fried rice LoMein Think Panda Express  straight  Panda Express type establishment   grabbed quick lunch while conference MGM Grand   bad option food court   If you're hungry should least two items   beef broccoli Tso Chicken   also fried rice Low Mein noodle if want taste two sides   serve beers if want treat yourself   did job lot less formal restaurants  <EOR> The food flavorless portions average best  knock off Panda Express  <EOR> You guys should disappointed yourselves  Pan Asian express should named bland Asian express  <EOR> Hot ciao plenty reasonable price  food court pay fast they're friendly  <EOR> If you're staying MGM want real breakfast food place! $10 omelet any additions it  offer broccoli spinach onions sun dried tomatoes regular tomatoes cheese bacon etc   added water bottle all came $11  Can't Vegas! <EOR> One grossest food court items ever anywhere  Even husband wouldn't eat he doesn't refuse food often  Service good  But Beef Broccoli  Orange Chicken eating balls deep fried paste dipped most bland sauce find  tried force down because hadn't eaten while but impossible  $10  2 item combo garbage  Even egg roll tossed bite both us  <EOR> I love they're costumer service! They're really amazing lady serves melody she's really friendly  Love orange chicken better Panda Express  <EOR> Considering much time set spend conference given I'd end trying few eateries restaurants MGM Grand offer   However can't say figured would include two food courts offerings review Nathan's come    no blame but myself though thinking bracketing lunch break sessions?  Hard wander off when there's much time very far   ugh   Located inside MGM Grand's food court Pan Asian Express nothing special entirely honest   Essentially nicer looking Panda Express but more generic without wide variety choose from   being said including Orange Chicken! doesn't look shabby   What's more prices aren't egregious which nice since didn't ton alternatives     After choosing Vegetable Chow Mein base TWO ITEM COMBO they also plain rice well fried rice opted Ginger Chicken Vegetables Orange Chicken of course to! over options Vegetable Stir Fry Chicken Mushrooms Sweet Sour Pork Egg Rolls Crab Rangoon   All all while food clearly didn't impress actually wasn't bad feared which isn't saying much    hand Orange Chicken meaty nice citric flavor Ginger Chicken fried though repetitive surprise   Yet more minuses pluses chow mein gummy bland Orange Chicken's batter thick soggy Ginger Chicken bit salty   Considering comparably priced regular mall food court in SF anyways Pan Asian Express isn't awful if want save few bucks without leaving hotel   However I'd rather use $16 paid meal $10 98 bottle water $3 48 something more unique Shake Shack across street   Unless you're virtually tethered conference center was   ugh   TWO HALF STARS but rounded down  <EOR> Getting quick bite eat before KA show MGM  expecting anything great  Palatable it  bad some reviews be  <EOR> The food served hot very little flavor  might worst Chinese food ever had  There's nothing else say  <EOR> 11 95 omelet anything yet still charge same plain scrambled eggs! terrible! ordered bacon 2 $3  wouldn't picky pricing if tasted half decent! <EOR> Decent Chinese fast food similar Panda Express   would expect food court     The prices food entrees bit high   price bottle beer way expensive   Just your alcohol casino while playing   Good place quick meal   would stop again   just would buy beer  <EOR>
