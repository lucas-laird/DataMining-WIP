When milkshake came delicious say  return milkshake takeout window but no need ever eat again  <EOR> I've chain Pennsylvania Arlington enjoyed burgers shakes  time tried chili spaghetti   Great flavor consistency pasta  However came only barely warm  time waitress' attention cold  asked if could reheat it  told never take any food back kitchen but she would check  She came back bit later cup hot chili told cook said just pour top! made little upset manager came over  She refused reheat dish when asked simply take off bill she basically said eaten much entree wouldn't possible  Honestly ate 3 forkfuls! Eventually she agreed remove item bill apologetic but still left hungry  So   1 star no soup You! <EOR> Well chili MAC means would macaroni noodles  Nope worst spaghetti ever had  Don't name dish serve something else  if should least good well far fetched  <EOR> I grew eating Steak n Shakes all over midwest 5 star review much nostalgia food service   Chili mac absolute favorite   Though may everyone spaghetti topped spicy beef ketchup  LOVE it!  Also shoestring fries crisp hot   cant prices   believe few meals under $4    now thats bargain! <EOR> Best part shakes  Burgers average pretty dry  Shoestring fries okay but great  Seasoning salt table definitely helped  Don't think back again  Left disappointed meal hearing good things place  <EOR> For those East Coast South should very aware Steak Shake  But everyone else let tell it  First off Steak Shake feel 50's diner  right off bat fun place hang out  No servers roller skates though darn  menu primarily Burgers Dogs Chili Shakes  more but most menu is  burgers made Sirloin Steak  patties 2oz each  thin bit crunch outer edge  burgers served medium well  very good burger  fries part way between shoestring regular sized fry  nice flavor good crunch because thickness   The shakes hand scooped  combinations shake flavors almost limitless  thing shakes most twice large would expect them be  taste great very creamy texture  also chilled nicely hit spot   The service fast  your table quickly  bring food quickly  tables cleared quickly  only issue did see many smiles workers faces  few but most did not  assumptions want yourself  <EOR> Frisco Melt must try together thin n crispy fries finish off any milkshake <EOR> It's while since steak n shake popped last night  very impressed   Food order table five minutes  Everything great prices even better  <EOR> Visited 2011 04 16 late dinner   line outside but moved reasonably quickly   ordered spicy chipotle burger while other half ordered mushroom burger good but didn't blow away   skipped milkshakes time but won't next time   Place very clean   Overall good but great probably because didn't milkshakes  <EOR> The food pretty decent though  Ordered 2 orders chicken strips alright really special  But front counter really messy receipts trashy menus <EOR> Two two burgers ordered made wrong but aside food fast cheap easy  Decent burger  double cheese pile fries $3 99! Tip ask grilled onions  There's no charge! Good service too  <EOR> We always come Steak N Shake when we're craving burgers literally live other side town NW Centennial area usually everything great but recent visit terrible  least end  When divide orders cashier really rude  She questioned orders fault put them together  friend accidentally milkshake put order when told wasn't supposed she said DONT milkshakes? gave attitude  Then when paid she kept sighing she annoyed  When she saw grabbed your experience number she looked down name tag took off!! Then when other set friends paid she instantly turned frown around  Usually takes lot complain but terrible cashier  Couldn't take name down but picture  <EOR> Let say dining Steak n' Shake since kid Florida  restaurant often since opened few years ago  taken friends happy share place those never heard it  But franchisee violating contract late   I friend Friday lunch tell nothing but horrible  First brought shakes styrofoam to go cups uh   we're dining in here  When complained mostly said tough run glassware  people around getting shakes glassware  top milkshakes horrendous  tasted frozen fast food product very icy texture Wendy's Frosty  definitely hand dipped ice cream milk shakes enjoyed all life Steak N Shake   Then when burgers came took bite could tell didn't taste proper plus couldn't see any cheese  told waitress she stuck fingers between patties showed cheese 3 4 little melted specks  said doesn't taste right sent back  She said she would another since she stuck fingers gracious but which responded appetite lost just take off bill  tried complain manager Indian lady named Naryet something she basically blew off    My friend hungry eat later paid dearly it  He called evening complaining severe stomach pains vomiting   This franchise cutting corners am sure violation contract  no understanding ambiance mystique classic American burger diner Steak N Shake exemplifies  happens when irresponsible franchisees run businesses franchiser doesn't pay attention just counts money  really hated see since living Vegas far different experience south where grew up  nice restaurant feel little bit nostalgia existed but gone  <EOR> Always hits spot! Amazing burgers mention fantastic shakes  Onion rings best tasted  Clean location located inside South Point Hotel Casino  Till meet again! <EOR> Great quality steak burgers   Love thin cut crispy fries   Cheap prices   tried shakes yet but next time sure  <EOR> I absolutely LOVE place!!

Can't wrong  <EOR> We used going Steak 'n Shake back Missouri when vacation  it's favorite places back food prices  rather excited find Las Vegas  But while food expecting prices bit higher staff all them  hostess server cashier could more welcoming friendly  imagine surprise when said don't participate paying Steak 'n Shake app which means didn't credit meal purchased supposed $5 reward every $50 spent   prices 25% higher Missouri well  say 25% extra amount fries seemed bit more generous wife's taco salad seemed larger well  if crave Steak 'n Shake food your fix  But should aware shortcomings particular location  <EOR> Crazy long wait Midwestern staple  glad found some yummy comfort food way Vegas but wait long don't think I'd back location    Steak n shake burgers fries shake joint retro goodness  every burger dream some delicious side side shakes  If aren't into burgers chili 5 way way go  <EOR> I travel it?

Between standing line getting food almost 1 hour! many Steak n Shake locations midwest St  Louis never experienced anything experience location   I ordered usual Frisco Burger brother double stack cheese  also ordered Carmel Turtle Shake soda down it  If never before need know burger patties extremely thin  Half size N 1 4 size Carl's Jr  If want burger resemble amount food Double Double n Out then need least order triple stack burger! fries come burger also extremely skinny which because extra crispy!   The carmel turtle shake came large shake glass usual but time no excess silver blending cup! When did change?? Budget Cuts??? shake when come here  called Steak n Shake reason!

Frisco Melt delicious just remembered it! side Thousand Island which 25 cents dunk sandwich only made all more enjoyable! fries okay  personally thought skinny did much flavor  cup chili rather disappointing  When opened thin visible layer oil top  somewhat bland no toppings diced onions tomatoes cilantro sour cream     Nonetheless would definitely back Frisco Melt  might just stay South Point again major reasons being Steak 'n Shake! wish closer but until then visit location despite wait! <EOR> The staffs really friendly here  They're nice always coming check you  line bit ridiculous but guess came busy day  Once inside takes them while bring water order takes 20 25 mins your food start eating  speed restaurant really really slow  idk back but they're really slow lol   On other hand food very delicious  loved it  shake great burger greesy but greesy good  Greasy?

Honestly going back just chili! burgers ok really expected wish meat patty thicker  dessert strawberry milkshake almost put right sleep lol  Overall  favorite thing chili dessert! <EOR> So feeling when enter Steak 'n Shake old school 50s kind diner  If Johnny Rockets same kind feel it  isn't something particularly use since don't places often  don't know variety foods served those old school diners but would expect wide range foods but pretty much burgers sandwiches   When party party big sit table larger table taken break into two booths which adjacent which wasn't bad but ideal social interaction  When sat down took while before server came waters while before orders taken which just bit annoying  ordered second table ordered same time table somehow food milkshakes around 10 minutes before table which quite baffling me  When food came pretty much ordered which composed some burgers sandwiches  server didn't come very often fill water come check which would nice least once throughout meal just very end but alright least didn't ask anything major   The food selection nothing special  isn't type Denny's style diner where wide array food choose just some burgers sandwiches chili milkshakes can't remember anything else really  isn't type food eat very often but friends wanted pay place visit decently cheap menu which bonus  If wish pay place visit would say just but don't expect anything special  <EOR> Five stars Wisconsin butter burger  Except pickles instead onions good  thin cut crispy fries also amazing    Today tried bacon cheddar burger only pickles anddd its pretty darn good  good butter burger though    Im going stick out  <EOR> We love taking kids here! prices great shakes OUTSTANDING!!! Wish closer west side but worth drive  <EOR> This total disappointment other prices  food just OK best shakes terrible not real ice cream   basically same thing going McDonald's would say McDonald's fries better  just another lame tourist trap restaurant  <EOR> I first time yesterday  husband ate all time Illinois kept saying wonderful excited try it  waiter took order then never saw again  Another waiter brought drinks but did bring kids shakes  Several minutes later shakes came must say worst vanilla shakes ever tasted  Something wrong! Then notice glass only dirty but sticky  point trying find waiter but he never comes near us  finally another guy's attention when explain nasty shakes dirty glass he asks want change them? Duh!! course do  He brings new soda clean glass says shakes coming  Then food comes  fries tasted under warmer forever sandwich wrong  didn't special order just forgot guess  Still no shakes  Someone tells working it  talk manager tells only person shakes    seriously?! She tells no charge told forget shakes left   Horrible experience  never back!! <EOR> Good food price  try eat relatively healthy well       not  But surprised great prices  Shakes very good  <EOR> Our food delivered fast  Prices bomb  food desert under 25 00 3 people  waitress very attentive  coming back food great!!!!! <EOR> This place sucked beginning end  Long wait door ok  Solid 10 minutes before order taken wait it    45 minutes some burgers fries  Double cheeseburger chipotle burger both totally overbooked dried out  tiny drop chipotle sauce lurking under lettuce barely noticeable dry bun   This might easily crappiest  burger ever eaten  Avoid place plague ! <EOR> Steak N Shake favorite places eat when tour South when find coming Vegas absolutely thrilled  decided wait few days til opening crowds died down but when friend arrived 10pm last night place still very busy    My friend Steak Frank fries while ordered mint cookies n cream milkshake  David loved dog said best he'd ever had  minute set down just smell told REAL all beef dog    My shake took while come like said place busy but when arrived didn't disappoint  Perfectly mixed not runny but thick wait drink it     Everything menu reasonably priced 4 bucks HUGE triple burger fries shooters 89 cents apiece spend little LESS would spend eating McDonald's food 100x good  mention during week Happy Hour 2 4pm where shakes half price   My only complaint location isnt 24 hours  Im hoping changed soon because know fact would slammed any hour day now word out   So glad SnS Vegas! <EOR> Nice spot Southpoint some cheap comfort food whenever craving burger fries even hot cup bowl chili   milkshakes also great too!

Maybe price point which credit  Prices fair reasonable here   I wanted oooh ahhhh over place many do  but burger middle road  shakes looked incredible! might inclined try days   The service friendly but nothing special single bacon cheeseburger grilled onions had  flavor very bland   The wait lots hype surrounds restaurant just didn't justify quality food received  don't eat fries anymore but husband said good  He ate mine his  The burger automatically comes fries think would fair compare Steak Shake Sonic which fan food either     I see why families come drones though   it's kid friendly low priced food  while vacation   can't blame them   C'est la vie   Another boring burger bites dust  <EOR> Honestly Steak 'n Shake isn't amazing  Sometimes fall love idea  memory  SnS perfect example this  Some people grew Midwest miss it  only SnS couple times  But first time late little drunk never heard SnS before thought greatest sandwich ever eaten   Fast forward today  Based memory anticipating SnS's opening several months  opening day based press release anyway endured 30 minute line  Did live hype? Yes no  mean could it? still think best items SnS pretty damn good  also items pretty meh I experienced blahness second time ate SnS    On visit ordered A 1 Peppercorn Melt w Fries  heck decided add Steakburger shooters w Chipotle sauce  course shake  Banocolate combination banana chocolate   The melt very good  kind sandwich reminded first mythical time eating SnS  shooter example meh  ordering those again  shake just its flavors little mixed it  novelty half half shake worn off  banana strangely overpowered neighboring chocolate  Next time think straight malt  Speaking which cousin Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt  tried it  good  But little disappointed its lack maltiness  way server Luciane attentive very friendly  expected opening day  She perhaps little attentive  She kept asking everything before even tried   If you're die hard SnS fan might want wait couple weeks lines die down  Bottom line still fan glad they're here  <EOR> We just cruising 93N when BAM sign said Steak n Shake South Point    started screaming car nearly landed ditch     Why may ask?

Great restaurant! <EOR> First time stopped way back into town gotta say its pretty good  don't know why waited long try out  Prices unreal  Definitely Budget friendly  <EOR> Ever those moments where experience doesn't exactly live hype? Unfortunately Steak 'n Shake  Which sad since enjoyed many late night meal Steak 'n Shake across IL MO  since Las Vegas far west diner chain reaches VERY excited taste over holidays    Maybe because actually dined vs  pickup drive thru ? maybe because Steak 'n Shake inside casino? maybe because bright hell inside? Something just didn't feel right  I blame clientele but let's face it Steak 'n Shake tends attract same type customer no matter part U S  they're located  Overweight loud eating mouth open kind people  Hey cool Midwest! Was double steakburger good remembered? Pretty much  say tastes WAY better comfort your own home  night bar hopping course  did appreciate two sides melted cheese dipping fries  only asked given second    Yay gluttony squared!  This particular location extremely clean well lit no complaints here  just didn't feel slice real deal  But hey  why Vegas!   Next time getting to go  <EOR> The food tastes great best thing would truly prices  lowest priced burger place seen far yet quality stays good  only downside only Vegas packed sometimes causing very long wait but all all worth it  <EOR> Steak 'n shake always quick bite right before movie    which typically running late love great meal under 25 bucks under 30 45 minutes  tried and true staple Southpoint date night! <EOR> Very cool burger shake diner  Burgers way smaller then pictures but fries shake don't need any more then single  cooked flat top tasty  <EOR> Great well priced food good service South Point hotel casino   Fast service   Food tasty good price   little above would expect burger joint   bad all  <EOR> If never SnS before like would explain cross between N Smashburger   bad doesn't outshine IMO The patties flattened super thin charred edges   Even though ordered doubles looks and fills single elsewhere   I tried Western BBQ Bacon $4 99 Double Steakburger American Cheese Applewood Smoked Bacon Fried Onions BBQ Sauce  burger patties super thin cripsy delicious   just filling! Good price though    Also tried Cookies Cream Milkshake $3 49 Chunky Cookie Pieces Whipped Cream  Good shake good price  Don't expect extraordinary enjoy it!   It's probably better cheaper most other choices Southpoint but wouldn't drive come eat specifically again   just kind burger!  But if find myself again I'd willing spend $10 bill happily <EOR> What's burger shake diner?    The prices very reasonable food good   only downside most likely wait long line table   But luckily casino gamble while unlucky person hold your place line   Place doesn't really accommodate larger parties   few tables fit around 7 8 people but any more split up     Favorites Very Berry Strawberry Smoothie Spicy Chipotle Burger <EOR> The line always long may suggest getting to go finding seat outside restaurant! Food delicious super cheap  Ordered Royale Burger which cheeseburger fried egg side fries whopping price $5 95! Amazing! Tasted 100x better McDonalds less cost! Also tried Vanilla Strawberry side side milkshake  BOMB! Tons flavors shakes try can't wait back try rest  <EOR> The line pretty long even lunch hours couldn't wait try food  Steak 'n Shake many years ago but forgot everything tasted  first Vegas people responding!  They two different lines  dining takeout  shorter line takeout line lol  wait food wasn't long all quite impressed since busy    Everyone almost restaurant signature hats while dining    The burger wasn't really good all  sad because looked foward burger fries really thin    The shake best part! side side Strawberry Banana shake! really really good!

Anyways shakes good ice cream good fries okay but wayyy small dinky! love some french fries but definitely here  burgers okay  kind small but juicy but juicy where starts dripping everywhere   I am definitely fan place but small burgers tiny ass french fries! <EOR> We love steak shake especially Wisconsin burger all butter   MMMMmmmmmmmMM   fact when moved Oregon made number meal come back enjoy   However     While food yummy good which even better  never when service good   fact left zero tip last time which person spent 25 years Vegas unheard of!    The shakes never come until your meal some time   leaves nothing drink start eat   shakes should easy quick require no cooking!  Then waitress leaves  but never comes back   top she won't take your credit card STAND LINE  because really all love restaurant right?  So if could improve service would five star   wish Oregon <EOR> Food good amazing  Shake alright did come way later expected  would've gave 3 stars however worker sight smile personality  probably return all  <EOR> Not bad   didn't try famous chili burger  plain single burger ultimate banana shake Meh  Nothing spectacular but did appreciate real ice cream milk shake  line seemed forever but wait 15min  Service good  Good place family together  <EOR> I don't eat meat but took kids quick lunch  give them 5 stars attention received when allergy mentioned  Even manager came discuss it  very impressed that  Good job steak shake caring  <EOR> First sweetest waitress place madhouse really appreciated her  Steak Shake south its standard fare but did best chicken sandwich there!!  Fries rings good too  great place eat casino cheap under $4 menu  Hit rush hours decent burger  Lets face pretty much stuck South Pointe most it  <EOR> They would accept gift cards because won't use app  menu short doesn't usual items other Steak shakes do  Everything more expensive regular S S  no discounts emailed coupons company  food shakes weren't good  crowded smokey smelling casino  NEVER location again  <EOR> Steak burgers amazing  steak perfectly seasoned  Patties flavorful  Burger combo $6  Shakes great <EOR> Our family while staying across street Grandview  group 13 took foreverrr seated then while seated into 2 separate booths because put tables together there  Burger good but small  mushroom swiss burger mushrooms hardly there  But still tasty  wasn't fan fries kind thin bland  ordered Banana shake think Ultimate Banana its called delish!! good  TON choices shakes  highlight  <EOR> Perhaps think diner Happy Days  Don't know google please! Jukebox music bright clean always friendly attentive service   far better service some better restaurants town  Clean cut staff wear hairnets   Shakes ohhhh those gladly split them if ask!

When sandwiches 15 minutes later sliders ice cold fries old hot patty melt luke warm best  MilkShake damn good though  <EOR> One favorite burger spots wish could LA burgers freaking tasty first tried steak n shake Atlanta Georgia but during last trip Vegas found location Just good remembered  <EOR>     well   the service great  but   the french fries worst EVER had   brutal   and shakes tasted made ice milk   when all national hamburger chains stepped game shakes brutal misake SNS   so why long lines   the food cheap big hotel    and yes others said food served cold    <EOR> What say Steak 'n Shake     I use love coming burger fix  haven't 2 years honestly disappointed first time  Surprisingly weren't busy use them being  ordered usually Frisco Patty Melt  Sadly poorly assembled lacked flavor  When buttered toast think did bit overpowered whole sandwich  also very soggy  Very disappointing overall sandwich  Husband ordered some bacon burger which looked delicious Son ordered small sliders  also ordered strawberry shake which arrived towards end meal  Super late! wasn't good remember  Seemed made strawberry syrup vs real strawberry  Staff also best  server came table even hello  hostess couldn't break smile  cashier ditz    I don't know happened past two years but whatever no good  Steak 'n Shake declined big time! <EOR> I count hand times Steak n Shake  Everything just super salty greasy blah  I'd wake next day huge zit face all nasty grease   I've tried burger spicy chicken sandwich fries Parmesan herb fries = salty greasy blah  worth calories even cheat meal    The only saving grace milkshake  But hard good milkshake? Flush away all bad food system! $15 bad burger sandwich bad fries milkshake? might want somewhere else better quality burger fries less pay extra better quality burger fries  <EOR> Located inside South Point Hotel Casino much famed Steak Shake  best value foodwise Las Vegas  burgers very inexpensive very delicious  overall atmosphere 1950s soda burger shoppe  Delicious juicy burgers thin crispy fries  Service prompted courteous well  didn't shake malt time but when places locally see chocolate malt future  if want good burger but don't want spend ton money then check Steak Shake! glad did! <EOR> Absolutely delicious! service always its best but generally very quick getting orders out  fact order separately resteraunt major plus well  <EOR> I previously enjoyed Steak 'N' Shake while Midwest happy when opened Vegas location   finally around trying it   Luckily around 11pm Monday night pretty empty did wait seated service very fast   ordered Original Double Cheeseburger fries which surprisingly still only $3 99   truly bargain especially considering full service restaurant   burger decent signature crispy edges   fries however seemed almost stale even though served hot   Overall good option super cheap eats when South Point but would way there  <EOR> The burger something really simple two burger patties grilled onions Wisconsin butter  butter totally melted through bottom bun sickening over bit   The Straw nilla shake super yummy though  sure if something spectacular but somehow first sip definitely wanting more  think use Blue Bunny ice cream sure if difference    I'll take friends if don't hometown because appears list 20 chains should every state but if sure back while  <EOR> I serious misconception Steak Shake  thought scale Johnny Rockets which kinda pricey  But its not  Meals 4 dollars  meal shake under 10  Burger came Juicy fresh  Fast Service friendly employees  only thing regret ordering dessert but next time  <EOR> Paper thin burgers horrendous service lackluster everything else  stayed SouthPoint several times all restaurants good notable exception Steak Shake  guess some kind chain but don't see where off using word 'steak' describe anything food  service equally bad  sum things just stay away!  Let's start service  Hostess rude took table requested booth instead 2 open response should've told before! no sign she should asked least tried accommodate us    sat table finally service it took good while honestly didn't count clock it   being asked repeat ourselves server off place order  whole staff seemed downtrodden exception register attendant asked if everything liking but couldn't break her      Food    Paper thin overdone patty decent veggies bun soggy    Just gross eat  Fries also soggy underdone but ok eat  also milkshake almost passed decent except strange whip cream cherry job  cherry flattened whip cream strangely distributed  Looked 5 year old made it  better fast food chains  partner chicken salad which looked good I'd if forced back   Atmosphere    Lots screaming children  If Johnny rockets might decor  Mostly clean  Downtrodden staff   The food relatively cheap but just bad  If want something cheap there's hot dog cart casino floor sells 75 cent hit dogs  Coronado cafe also better option spend little extra much more! If you're feeling nostalgic hot dog anyway because food gross staff rude downtrodden tons screaming children  Just 'NO!' <EOR> I wanted add tip review shakes half off between 2 4 Monday through Friday    The shakes look good while machines   didn't realize happy hour   Someone told four shakes 7 50  <EOR> I come shakes love double chocolate fudge shake!

I tried double cheddar burger found portion size right fast food restaurant where everything somewhat small   fully satisfied just two patties found them way more flavorful imagined blows away pretty much every other fast food burger town   three patties you're most likely going coronary   main reason loving burgers though use real cheddar cheese imitation gunk cheese normally used   really put over top combination meat real cheddar made wish another burger drive home   I'm really happy casino normal drive through fast food local restaurant would eat often   gain all weight lost 2010  <EOR> So major goodie but place sucks   worth line all!   The steak burgers if ground beef skirt steak baby then pan fried just little long topped different things then stuffed between some buns  thin come double stacked else there's no meat   This knock off version Johnny Rockets if you've ever there  <EOR> What's hype???

Eventually business phased out   So off Steak n Shake see Biglari's plan coming along   Then saw ridiculous lines wait times   am pretty certain probably continue good cash generating business   Once hype dies down wait much less but definitely far better run business Krispy Kreme   Remember lines there? Nowadays Krispy what?
