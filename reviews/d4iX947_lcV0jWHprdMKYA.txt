When meal wondered wrong   basically came small half pound looking container it    suppose picture page right but KNOW zoomed way screw your sense scale   small thing beans few scant slices sausage enough fill worth $12   That said taste good going for   Maybe would try something else menu if ever coupons    worked downtown over decade know better options discriminating consumer  <EOR> I didn't order much cause already dinner but did stop some beers some chocolate covered bacon   They sparkling wine Stella  sad face believe some Leinenkugel's Summer Shady   could wrong but really good way tap good price   The chocolate covered bacon REALLY good! 2 pieces 4 bucks  Chocolate bit overwhelming but bacon cut pretty thick    Interesting  <EOR> the overriding theme review be LIVE??  this would second visit establishment because really enjoyed chili $7  loved putting pickles first time ever ate ONLY time ever ate there  last night's encounter made lose appetite literally    I craving said chili said pickles  walked over since downtown already  came stupid fucking container park specifically reason chili pickles  but soon walk harassed embarrassed two dudes standing patron side counter  left seemed normal probably embarrassed seen other friend right total douche   I know Tony Hseih built city could all collide friends but sometimes just want order some dinner home  no don't want stop and chat  no don't want talk camera pictures take it  glad think jacket really cool  lovely but please stop talking me  LIVE?   Clearly coolest female walking around downtown dress well 'New Yorker vibe' apparently? ride bicycle but doesn't mean right accost especially when someone running establishment asks politely multiple times leave customer alone   how many times ask stop speaking me? why answer your questions protector counter? if already ordered move aside order? guess guy left assumed incorrectly all hitting me  he actually said just know we're all gay  which replied okay? cool? assume care  why does matter? all want dinner  body language overall demeanor says please  stop  don't want any attention all just hungry  forgive 'looking cool ' but doesn't mean don't deserve respect being left alone when asked   I actually said but no matter  sigh  fair guy behind counter trying stop but no luck either  even though he told them if he lost customer because them he'd kick ass douche didn't stop  actually lost appetite entirely because guy left    pork 'n beans your food good though slightly overpriced  know your fault paying astronomical rent shipping container Tony Hseih probably free somewhere coast Cali  because he touched once meth ridden land golden dick now stupid amounts money anyone collide each other  however willing pay again eat returning customer  know don't choose your clientele know isn't your fault but man LIVE?? <EOR> The classic  knockwurst did mushy texture Campbell's Frank's Beans beans still firm all all fantastic  I back three four times yet try anything else  Love it  <EOR>
