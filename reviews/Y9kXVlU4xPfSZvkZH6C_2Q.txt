<EOR> I wanted believe hype but underwhelmed meal's end   Naked City Tavern outpost local favorite and Diners Drive Ins Dives featured restaurant Naked City Pizza  Some notable differences 24 7 provide more menu items just namesake pizza which hadn't tried before really looking forward to   I met several Yelpers dinner which notably didn't include brunch items perhaps refer other reviews more those look eventual brunch visit   able share multiple items standard menu well separate Enchantment Under Sea menu   We started off some specialty fries $5 50 small size $7 50 large   TV featured Suicide Fries destroyed palate during first final bite wrote off  Poutine Fries disappointing several ways starting lack sufficient salt continuing overall blandness mozzarella gravy ending relatively boring soft texture fried potato  couldn't write off   The Braised Short Rib Stroganoff $14 95 large shareable plate also suffered lack salt  better located salt shaker but initial impression hard shake  Even given proper seasoning disliked recipe because overly shredded minced preparation does give proper respect short rib purportedly used   I finally impressed Lobster Pot Pie $18 95 which consisted delicious puff pastry creamy tomato filling essential solid chunks lobster hard to find at place proper level seasoning  also tried Pizza Logs $7 95 think crispy egg roll like pepperoni pizza cold red sauce dip proper seasoning second consecutive menu item   I excited try specialty pizzas $14 95 1 4 sheet which 6 solid rectangular pieces both pizzas which divided great  Naked City sans olive per person's request akin would combination  supreme takeout delivery pizza menus Guinea Pig another TV featured dish white sauce pizza slices huge meatballs  Toppings all delicious crust style little thicker hence less crispy but loved eating every bit anyway   At end able sample bit Strawberry Short Cake $7 95 which eats same sounds but feels fairly light texture  sweet either  said little boring didn't seem enough punch post pizza dessert likely wouldn't order myself next time   I really wanted give them higher rating strength pizzas but service lacking  server seemed stretched busy floor couldn't help but wonder when pizzas coming among other concerns  Perhaps bar seating would resulted better service table? would've given points some music playing sports filled TVs around room but  exactly why came tonight   As alluded earlier likely back Naked City Tavern pizza look brunchy items but let down tonight  Despite enjoying pizza much need little bit more before feel comfortable calling myself fan offerings overall  <EOR> Ordered pizza last night  only shocked half sheet only 6 slices wasn't even good  greasy flavorless pepperoni burned  Very disappointed because expectations based ratings  stop won't making ever again  <EOR> I beef sandwich au jus  Kaiser roll which different lot salt top tasted little bland but bad  fries soggy great  think should gone pizza  give anther shot see goes  <EOR> Great food amazing atmosphere!! bills if love football amazing good place be!! <EOR> The food VERY good!
