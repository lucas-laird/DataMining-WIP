But service sub par super friendly but SLOW bit more pricey worth their prices gone last year   going back tonight  chimichanga supposed come sour cream  less tablespoon's worth plate whereas probably 3 4 times much guacamole plate  I'd expect relatively equal amount sour cream  pointed both server server assistant asked little bit more and took far long actually more sour cream    I charged sour cream $1 50 asked removed when pay counter  manager asked wrong sour cream repeated complaint said didn't ask nor need 1 2 cup sour cream brought me  just wanted ought come dinner   The manager ended taking off 1 2 cost  still paid  75 cents  Now know much money wasn't point asking taken off  principle thing  paid $15 99 chimichanga supposed come beans rice guacamole sour cream  don't think much ask more micro dollop sour cream  meal come sour cream would ordered happily paid $1 50   I expecting attitude manager over $1 50 especially when $95 bill  If going complain lie something would complained something worth more money  What's more when server came counter not server she asked Spanish if he'd served girl sour cream  lying something? And white girl can't possibly understand Spanish  rarely ask bill adjustment having server many years but never gotten rude pushback before over measly buck fifty  says lot business don't appreciate it  won't back  <EOR> Place cracking  Thanks lord knew gabby ask her! behind bar  She walked straight chips guac salsa more  Place money! <EOR> In experience Mexican fare Las Vegas pretty much same   restaurant recipes more those Albuquerque  <EOR> We always stop when Vegas authentic Mexican food  Service mediocre waiters always seem same   not very happy  pretty large menu options vegetarians including vegetarian beans  give chips salsa warm bean dip free charge but if want hot salsa charge  hand made tortillas flour corn    a lady making them corner see if want   they yummy!

Lo considero IRRESPETUOSO e insultante para la cultura mexicana  sentí muy triste cuando vi la imagen de Frida maltrata y sucia por los desechos de comida en ese mantel  Trataré de hacerles llegar este mensaje personalmente porque encantó el lugar sin embargo no puedo regresar y apreciar ese escenario  <EOR> Great Mexican food affordable prices close strip  Located Art District great spot eat outside view Stratosphere  recommend fajitas! <EOR> WARNING THE GUACAMOLE DIP GIVE U UR CHIPS FREE  YOU'L CHARGED EVEN WHEN U DIDN'T ORDER IT   Was Vegas found good reviews friend thought would gr8 way end trip b4 left   WRONG BECAUSE The manager rudest person ever encountered    life   He all smiles when first arrived he seated table  Then waiter brought chips salsa guacamole dip table left  Complimentary RIGHT?

Honest opinion food    below average however nice atmosphere    Don't buy Groupon don't honor them  give lame excuse misprint  did reluctantly honor ours $10 99 apparently means anything over $10 99  Explain logic! Groupon states 2 lunch items $10 99 $13  said really means spend over $10 99 each item honor groipon      thus making $9 coupon  If spend over $22        Rude rude rude <EOR> Cute little Mexican restaurant near downtown super speedy friendly service  little pricey   $20 chilaquiles?! fresh corn flour tortillas corner dining room  pretty busy times but Sunday lunch hour good time crowd  <EOR> I Vegas week end group friends    After few disappointments other restaurants friend recommended restaurant place nice bright service fast food oh food just right on     What great experience place  First Monday morning most hungover really hungover group 12 resevations no problem seating few mins  thank them that   I puerco en salsa verde pork green sauce meat tender sauce spicy but overwhelming rice beans good   Other people group different dishes try couple them  carnitas really good  camarones la diabla just good  Guacamole really good too    The drinks great    I wish known place beginning maybe would come everyday    Casa Don Juan good service nice place excellent food  <EOR> 1st time coming casa don juan service great fast seating same drinks food came quickly love chip salsa fried beans  husband order choriqueso appetizer really good comes tortilla your choice flour corn only down side comes only 2 pieces tortilla big portion choriqueso order more tortilla  ordered chicken enchilada son came rice beans very good flavor bad part rice very dry  ordered mix cocktail octopus shrimp impressed order needed more flavor avocado black  husband ordered carne asada plate think portion right por price  he order 2 shrimp tacos  <EOR> The fajitas great! ordered steak shrimp combo trust don't skimp meat here  Next time could easily share entree  boyfriend 2 4 year old kids day swimming golden nugget pool  kids totally wiped wanted something simple  luckily american options chicken nuggets fries favorite! margarita delicious gigantic topped gran marnier! perfect  boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas loved sauce it  next time back ordered taco tamale but sticking fajitas now best  <EOR> Casa Don Juan offers pretty standard Tex Mex menu  burritos enchiladas tacos etc   good job standards they're starting 3 stars   Why 3 stars already?

NO Thanks! definitely authentic ceviche which should disclose but even am complaining about  even chunks fish scraps frozen bits find bottom bag frozen fish   Why would serve your customers?  If something menu your customers prefer tell them you're all being served scraps frozen bits fish   maybe always looks way   making $8 dollars sale worth it?  Needless say highly recommend order ceviche fish shrimp Casa Don Juan    haven't much else said before but those things unforgivable when comes food   If could rate zero stars would   Also paid bill 100% because still charged food   niece nephew ordered burritos charged extra $1 50 sour cream another $1 50 cheese per burrito    just ridiculous  waiter said would come check if did pay when started complaining just paid cause scene   joke! <EOR> Wow   Definitely place known locals   far strip worth trip    When u eat chips u r already pulled n   When u taste Frijoles come chips u ' re thinking okay really this    order guacamole fall love   it's creamy immensely flavorful   lunch ordered shredded beef taco cheese enchilada    I don't know describe but every morsel taco tantalizing!

Don Juan always very welcoming just felt always family whenever I'd dine here! ****TODAY**** I Brought friend lunch celebrate birthday first time Casa Don Juan  She liked decore atmosphere   bit disappointed first time ever  It felt rushed friend ordered tostada de ceviche but didn't chance tell waiter Alfredo kind she wanted he brought fish  She wanted shrimp she didn't want complain  asked Vuelve la Vida which very expensive mostly juice much shrimp octopus salty  didn't want send back never before  I didn't recognize any workers seems everyone new?!?! I little disappointed food but staff nice friendly just need sure customer wants  visiting new location near future won't let bad experience ruin opinion restaurant still love place forever loyal customer  <EOR> My five stars them having best hard shelled tacos Vegas! Aside food good service great  boyfriend ordered michilada  He absolutely did he complained  Juan came apologize said he would take back attempt way boyfriend liked spicy full flavor  When Juan came new michilada he did disappoint  boyfriend says BEST michilada he's city  GREAT SERVICE! definitely back michiladas tacos! <EOR> I feeling eating Mexican food way back long trail run Lake Las Vegas Summerlin since going pass all those Mexican neighborhods called Mexican friend recommend good Mexican place part town   As usual she replies none them home but she did mention few places since Don Juan pretty closed off 515 decided come here     It reassuring when half parking lot filled Nissans   Mexican folks seem love Nissans   interior strangely filled Frida Kahlo stuff   somewhat uncomfortable being surrounded unibrow paintings but used it     Chips salsa bean dip tostadas ceviche carne asada burrito plate     The burrito FULL carne asada unlike stuff typical chain places where find few pieces meat among LOT rice beans   opposite VERY filling   Ceviche good but more used central American type ceviche where big chunks fish but all fish ceviches Mexican places seem small flaky sort fish but good different way     Depsite running 8+ miles having enormous appetite did space left tamales ordered take them home     All all liked food would definitely back there  <EOR> This those hidden gems off Las Vegas Strip should known everyone loves authentic Mexican food  If travel Vegas car wouldn't really recommend taxi ride but hey each own need come Casa Don Juan!  Since isn't single place strip offers authentic mexican decent price family always head over least once during Vegas stay  Although slightly overpriced it still Vegas very decent sized meal $15 $20    I always judge mexican restaurants' credibility off FACTOR RICE!
