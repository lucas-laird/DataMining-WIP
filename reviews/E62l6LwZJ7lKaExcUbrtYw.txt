Once touch rice fall down    My story I around 10 00pm since yelped discount girl 10 00pm  restaurant small old They no table  sit bar face face chef   only two other parties restaurant  gf seat quickly started order  food menu a piece paper very limited  filled order sheet  passed waitress  She asked order chef directly  Okay gave order sheet chef a true Japanese man tell why   He first refused sheet because he want order verbally  But don't want read every order idiot  explained  much read  I don't think he could memorize everything tought  He finally sheet  He asked if want sashimi nigiri  said nigiri  asked if Toro  He asked somewhere cross street  Japanese chef said difficult serve Japanese  he making fun other customers they all speak Japanese  gf spoke English all time think chef must thought don't understand Japanese  acted don't understand Japanese  He kept speaking Japanese joking around others speak Japanese  He complaining front us! Okay keep silence because hungry don't want another place  waited 15 mins  During time others kept ordering food Japanese  Yes ordered late food came first! nothing eat even piece sushi! Then ordered some sashimi oysters because think kind raw food might come faster  right  Japanese chef didn't want nigiri  If order sashimi he serve very fast  quickly finished some can eat item  left  Two hour both restroom hotel  Which part did spend most time hotel? Restroom!  PS highly recommend restaurant Japanese  Or speak good Japanese <EOR> Hands down best All you can eat sushi bar Vegas  5 10 minutes away Strip located quiet plaza  Don't let exterior fool you  place serves fresh seafood price reasonable  might look sushi bar when walk because sushi bar hidden behind teppanyaki section  sushi bar only sit 15 people perhaps? might need wait bit  Good thing open till 2 am!  We loved everything served can't wait back again! <EOR> I lived across street Hikari over year OMG place amazing much fun  friend mine discovered beginning Sept least 6 times brought group friends work  Its favorite place work some Sushi Sake   Looks going weekend when am off  <EOR> WOW  Why people come here? definitely place sushi  came bunch co workers food disgusting    We all did AYCE started off ordering sashimi try each fish some definitely fresh    Failed #1    Next excited Uni since 4 orders  people didn't realize Uni supposed bright orange brown place   Failed #2    I decided give cooked foods try ordered calamari gyoza  calamari super chewy gyoza obviously prepackaged but somehow managed butcher that    Failed #3  Finally dessert isn't included dump came $35 person  wife didn't single thing place  If want all eat GOOD sashimi Kaze $20    I don't know if mental but felt little sick eating here  <EOR> Steak house side great!

Best deal ever happy found place  Thank Hikari changing life  bringing everyone know! <EOR> I don't know why even bother AYCE sushi  picky am even top notch buffets hardly satisfying  curiosity supposed?   Hikari isn't bad if factor price but sub par comparing regular sushi joints  AYCE rules simple almost no restrictions  Basically everything menu all eat  would offer or encourage sashimi instead nigiri  Sounds good right?   The Pros Fresh uni ame ebi ikura acceptable quality  No limit them sashimi style  Fresh oysters  Small but sweet  Made order nigiri directly sushi chef  Ran Japanese chefs waitstaff  No wait time all  Very affordable price   The Cons Fish choice rather limited  No higher end items only very basic selection  Some sashimi cold just barely defrosted  Fish quality very mediocre  Don't expect better cuts  Sushi preparation seemed rushed  Understandable since chefs super busy but completely excusable  Some sashimi slices weren't even totally cut through  Some sushi drenched sauce  Ask chef hold sauce if more delicate tastebuds  chef bit personalities friendliness service received might vary depending much he likes you  Dessert included AYCE price only grocery quality mochi ice cream   If tight budget but craving sushi Hikari might your answer  still better places Todai sushi counters Wynn Bellagio  Skip if real sushi lover  <EOR> Terrible sushi chef  seated sushi bar then started order food  Everything fine until he didn't agree wants order quantity wise he became little bit aggressive  family noticed aggressive behavior immediately became uncomfortable  told tone voice regular customer should spoken asked speak manager  No manager very moment sushi chef became more aggressive saying don't need customers just out! Stupid  Stupid  then waited manager arrive told entire situation yet manager didn't want rude sushi chef apologize behavior   With being said experience no customer should talked manner deal rude sushi chef  Come own risk  <EOR> Very delicious  Speedy  Friendly acception  Especially Uni soft shell crabs  The price reasonable  <EOR> Not good used be  sushi chefs last visit engaging seemed hassle them even rolls    shame! <EOR> **** ABSOLUTELY WORST AYCE SUSHI RESTAURANT VEGAS******  I know restaurant 4 stars rating   lot AYCE sushi restaurants absolutely worst one   Sushi Sashimi option   But guys please try avoid sushi option if want ridiculous amount rice charge extra after     First few fishes day sea urchin reason but available which disappointed  Service ridiculous  Manager fought because complained food fresh could eat it   salmon pure orange zero fat scallop extremely unfresh just think anything fresh there     We group 13 night ordered 5 order sushi most order which 10 pieces   when sushi came surprised fishy unfresh sushi were   tried eat whatever fresh leftover fresh told manager afterward cannot eat unfresh sushi she gave attitude right away told should order many food beginning told should just order order sushi try before placing more order   HEY BxTCH understand  want waste food but seriously expect group 13 order order per sushi ?

Fish tasted decent but menu limited  Desert isnt even included  Service fast several hibachi stations but theres several other sushi places nearby much better  <EOR> I ate first time December 2010 far best meal AYCE not during 7 days LV vacation   Although wait pretty long already ran few items day waitress didn't walk very often experience unforgettable   sushi chefs entertaining attentive   There's also TV mounted wall which someone pretty much gets bored impatient just eating during meals happy clam   I tried everything wanted try menu liked everything   portions good size waiting time orders few far between seating arrangement wasn't stuffy cramped   I'm heading back LV March am looking forward revisiting Hikari = <EOR> Great AYCE sushi sashimi place vegas   interesting set teppan set right next sushi bar   Food great made order   speed which bring items quite impressive   Also attitude sushi chefs great   don't try skimp quite funny say least   Great value people looking sushi reasonable price  <EOR> Great late night food stop  frallops must!

Oh if good looking lady midnight discount  Can't remember much but still kind funny  <EOR> This place pretty bad service food  quite disappointed  Hair wasabi first course  When showed waitress reaction what   She inspected first before bring another serving wasabi if crazy  Gross  Sashimi cut very poorly Some pieces shreds more blood line meat  Bone sashimi? wife spit scallop almost burst into tears cause she chose spot  Everything covered siracha  Sushi rice very plain excessive  rolls loose  Fish quality barely edible  menu small all eat sushi  Which left searching something palatable  ordered tempura dish waitress dropped piece shrimp did'nt even bring another piece  turned off bite tongue though whole meal cause embarrassed brought guess here  Now when apologize your company bringing them poor establishment pretty bad  desperately searching something good say place but im loss words  green tea good  But everything else try hard show poor sushi if done properly  First time ever left sushi restaurant still hungry  top off add 18% gratuity parties four WTF  No wonder service poor  Just reflecting back this  can't believe actually paid such poor experience  should just left HAIR wasabi  <EOR> Came labor day weekend happy visit last year  Customer services way better last time when came here  sashimi all eat best  Uni fresh last time fried oyster anymore  overall good experience but came 3 things sashimi uni fried oyster uni no more fried oyster really disappointed me  <EOR> Whenever want good fresh sushi always head over Hikari  always great service variety different sushi sashimi great all tastes  We're least once month  <EOR> No matter always end back Hikari  lot other sushi places but end day can't sushi sashimi hikari  <EOR> We arrived around 7 00 p m  Tuesday night no wait   seated sushi table but plenty other tables inside   aware sitting table other people though   Imagine being sushi table teppanyaki restaurant   Your conversations overheard   We sat down stated doing AYCE $26 99 each   Beverages desserts included   AYCE means AYCE except fresh oysters uni   Everyone gets 12 fresh oysters 4 orders uni 2 per order    two TOTAL 2 oysters 4 orders uni D  know people complain limit but think  still lot!  young lady next ordered uni raw quail egg but scared try it already trying uni first time!  yes liked it   Here's two ate 6 orders sashimi salmon 5 slices each order but more first time yummy except last plate salmon sashimi didn't taste fatty all other pieces don't think because freshness but more which part salmon was 4 orders uni 2 pieces each order mentioned earlier first time enjoyed except last piece tasted slightly bitter wished came without seaweed rice though  1 order oysters 2 each order came spicy sauce 1 salmon skin salad lettuce cucumber very fresh skin little mushy crispy imagined 1 spicy poke very spicy came several different fish lots seaweed salad 1 combo sashimi tai tuna Hamachi salmon good but salmon still best 1 dynamite came flaming mix seafood veggies topped w cheesy sauce slightly sweet while expecting savory addictingly yummy although burnt broccoli little bitter possible carcinogenic D 3 orders unagi 2 pieces order unagi rice yummy 1 order salmon roe 2 pieces each order average salmon roe can't say anything more 1 order soft shell crab 1 order tempura combo 2 each shrimp carrot broccoli 1 onion 1 mushroom 1 order tempura seafood 2 each shrimp fish squid 1 order tempura shrimp 4 1 order gyoza 3 came sauce disappointed fried oil pan fried steam 1 shumai 3 came w creamy sauce pretty good  Ordered individually would cost $200 95   Even if retail cost exaggerated if cut down 50% off would still $100 going say money's worth! We greeted right away hostess when arrived all doing something but bus boy managed someone's attention led table   sushi chef greeted took order entire night  beginning little difficult attention when he looking down food others but later he'd look periodically we'd give orders him   He even sense humor   water refilled ladies serving other tables food plates taken away periodically but never look them   When finally admitted defeat asked server check which promptly came     This great deal price   service pretty good don't know everyone else restaurant but sushi chefs Japanese   would return seems only restaurant AYCE sashimi! <EOR> This place delicious  salmon green mussels  all need life! eating bar ayce way go <EOR> Pretty good all eat sushi place  decent selection food  service very good friendly staff  <EOR> Every time Vegas AYCE sushi must! place Goyemon but time fam dad come ages ago some locals left impression     Being creature habit skeptical BUT ended being pleasantly surprised! quality par other AYCE places but really liked could almost all fish sashimi!   The only negative rice bit vinegary mushy but needs rice filling anyways! Kept going back hamachi garlic tuna salmon  **make sure sit sushi bar amazing service!! <EOR> To honest bit inebriated while getting joint because pre partying during car ride LA LV    however didn't stop eating  10pm sexy ladies eat discounted price but really just girls general  know would rather rolled hot outfit but guess better embarrass myself t shirt jeans instead something would regretted spilling something on   However! still enjoyed myself most dishes alright  Fresh oysters pretty good little spicy but still satisfying  Sampled few different sushi don't remember kinds    but ok! would expect AYCE but tad better    no premium sushi but bad all   But yes Vegas known buffets AYCE your belly's worth sushi well! D <EOR> I came family AYCE sushi $27 per person   seen cheaper places Chicago interested seeing quality was  thing special Hikari you're allowed order sashimi AYCE which something haven't seen  Typically feed rice fill up  no wait when came dinner but seating pretty awkward  You're seated line your group but you're facing other people hear conversations   Orders scribbled down notepad instead checking off sheet paper which I'd prefer  Some mistakes made due hearing  Sushi does take while prepare understood when plates brought over ten minutes ordering  Sashimi pieces also little bit small should order more round AYCE    Baked Mussels Really flavorful  Highly recommend! Takoyaki Octopus Dumpling Wasn't fan mushy texture  Kama yellow tail  really big but honestly just cooked fish nothing special  Cajun Albacore Sushi Passable  spices didn't well raw fish  Sweet Shrimp Sushi first time raw shrimp! pretty good but really freakin' small   Ika Sushi Definitely favorite  texture just chewy no bad taste  Scallop Sushi I also love rolls come half sizes AYCE  full order caterpillar roll 8 pieces   noticed rice roll mushy kind Trader Joe's Sushi   rice other nigiri rolls completely fine  also half spider roll definitely enjoyed flavors crunchiness    I'm usually fan $27 AYCE sushi but totally understand if you're allowed order unlimited sashimi! some restrictions many items order specialty items uni  Also mochi ice cream when went <EOR> The food isn't bad but don't if you're visiting vegas  find your own backyard   Pros oysters kama tempura  OK Sashimi quality udon edamame miso soup staff  Cons Uni dark brown fresh Salmon skin soggy crisp Sashimi cuts untastefully big     Fried Soft Shell Crab flavorless <EOR> The food good chef very kind hospitable only 4 stars because servers weren't very attentive but kind! <EOR> This place AMAZING!

Sorry Hikari don't know if return since there's such abundance Japanese restaurants but certainly try convince me  <EOR> Went Hikari last night food really dropped last time there    Had ayce option  Sashimi good but apps par udon store bought just add hot water kind thing  Fried tofu tasteless add soy sauce even little flavor    Please charge people $30 something buy store $ 99  <EOR> Came Thurs late night wasn't crowded  Awesome quality nigiri sushi sashimi rolls other goodies all eat less $30 bucks? I'd eatting all time if local  little bit off strip but no biggie if rental car  <EOR> Came group 18 seated us! Great 17 99 all eat sushi!

Thank thank thank you!!  Saturday night Vegas trying decide whether buffet all you can eat sushi   sure buffet would good but glad decided sushi   Hikari actually Japanese steak house sushi bar sit table steak seafood etc sit sushi bar some great AYCE sushi sashimi rolls appetizers     I'm big fan Midori LA but say Hikari better   more Hikari some key things AYCE menu Midori doesn't namely sashimi   your choice nigiri sashimi different types sushi offer   big fan raw oysters half shell but also offer part AYCE which know isn't normally cheap   don't remember everything but remember includes shrimp tempura miso soup edamame fried scallops they call Frallops soft shell crab plate mixed sashimi tuna yellowtail super white tuna salmon shrimp nigiri   know more but dishes coming fast furious couldn't keep up   favorites crab scallops super white tuna sashimi   put some spicy garlic jalapeno sauce which added nice kick   also ended getting some red bean green tea mango strawberry mochi ice cream dessert which wasn't part AYCE pay extra it      Overall everything very good quality very tasty   see some complaints service other reviews but thought excellent   sat sushi bar chefs right but super quick attentive only sushi made right bar but cooks back making appetizers cooked dishes putting them record time well   don't think waited more 2 3 minutes anything ordered   sushi chefs great attitudes very friendly     Note open until 2am 11pm 2am good looking ladies special where good looking ladies eat AYCE $22 50 instead normal price $26 95   sure judges whether ladies good looking but guess long lady you'll special   Drag queens Vegas sorry but you're probably luck  <EOR> We regular Hikari but worst experience ever week ago  older sushi chef must appreciate restaurant being busy because sat down usual section simply asked if he any hamachi belly immediately snapped saying NO really loud voice  then asked if he cud check other chef's section he started throwing things making loud noises if scare me  sashimi he prepared wife but no condiments wasabi ginger wife asked condiments he yells wife loud tone Don't yell   time wanted give piece mind then leave but wife decided just move away into teppanyaki section wouldn't see him  did but did care eat more wanted just wanted hell there  Hikari lost business any other business influence there  <EOR> My first time restaurant different kind sashimi sushi which really good especially salmon sushi eel  Banzai roll best taste little bit sweet but yummy   But worst Miso soup salty  can't even finish it  <EOR> I'm big fan AYCE sushi joints but taking mom dinner most good Asian moms   she loves Asian AYCE buffets!  We actually found service really good   However layout restaurant weird   Apparently used teppan steakhouse all seats set around teppan griddles U shape which doesn't lend itself conversation small group   most meal we're looking folks eating U shaped table directly across us   Kinda awkward   Note include 18% grat parties 4 more   seen lot 6 8   but auto grat party 4?  I should've known trouble beginning   server recommended starting dozen fresh oysters   Wow   fresh oysters AYCE joint?  asked which type oysters Kumamotos favorites being Japanese restaurant thought perhaps served   He blank look face answered uhh  just order you'll see  came quickly huge   Really huge flavorless   Two bite oysters obscene gross   especially when no flavor    I prefer Japanese owned sushi joints bcuz rice real sushi rice   the nigiri sashimi cut precision taught 1000's years   sashimi came odd shapes   cubed rectangular trapezoidal   sushi times inedible   Some cut grain   some against grain   Uni shade dark brown   Shrimp temp gummy   probably frozen tempura   tofu salad made Chinese tofu   not soft Japanese tofu   I see why people here however yelpers rating restaurant 5 stars rating wallets   Even mom said she'd never come back  <EOR> are kidding me? $30 all eat japanese food?! dont see any other awesome places LA!! order anything want its all eat!! chef nice friendly no matter much order give them just dont waste food there! lol <EOR> Four stars because all eat sashimi first place found Vegas   Good quality fish couple decent innovative rolls  give 2 atmosphere 3 presentation 4 food  I'd still prefer Naked Fish over Hikari    dollar dollar just better   This place cool though discount good looking girls certain hour  chefs seem good time work service quick efficient overall great meal   Will definitely dining again though next time hope more sashimi selections available  <EOR> I really excited try place when friend told going somewhere AYCE included sashimi     skeptical seemed good true should trusted gut but prospect endless sashimi won over off went   First thing only 4 asked if wanted sit sushi bar table opted table would easier share AYCE family style  walked over teppanyaki table sat down directly next couple already squeezed into corner  must drawn short straw because ended basically rubbing elbows woman    They sensed discomfort ended telling server leaving they hadn't ordered anything yet left $1 table tea  second time should've taken hint but persisted   Then ordered  some items can't ordered sashimi but pretty much everything else sashimi style  limit number oysters orders Uni ordered per person initially said bring maximum # uni  never tried before suspect wasn't best opportunity try it  re thinking much would decided just half much start 8 pieces  Well must mis communication because ended bringing 16 pieces    At first didn't complain because figured we'd eat all anyway  Then realized Nori rice uni ratio way off  TON nori rice little bit uni ontop  tried couldn't stomach it  can't say sure whether matter taste but something just tasted OFF me  red flag #3   dismissed thinking maybe just don't uni trudged on  friends ate all pieces but left good amount rice  When took away plates scolding eat rice charged  seemed warning diligent rest time eating all rice  turns warning charged additional $3 per person leaving rice shouldn't worried trying follow rule that  $3 per person seems lot seems should related price roll rice came but dunno   The other pieces fish just OK  Nothing really awesome but nothing horrible either  salmon soft shelled crab probably best items  takoyaki also pretty good    The cajun albacore gross hard seasoning tasted off  oysters poorly opened little pieces shell most them  super white tuna bad texture really tough    For worst part end when trying finish ordered probably little much but AYCE without overeating?? each muscling down last few pieces worst items    last couple pieces spicy poki  when happened    Maybe because lower quality pieces fish used chop into poki maybe its because sitting 30 minutes things ordered earlier night  way put piece tuna mouth almost threw tasted rotten spit out   When wasn't bad enough bill    $27 person AYCE $3 person leaving rice plus tax plus mandatory 18% gratuity party FOUR more    ended being $152 change ie  $38 per person   put credit cards willingly but then told waitress future reference more clear orders because felt ordered much Uni brought reason left rice  Instead apologizing offering take any all rice charge even saying 'thanks letting know' she defensive  rude  called over manager continued scold bad children telling follow rules hadn't made mistake needed understand 8 orders = 16 pieces  we feel ordered 8 PIECES 8 ORDERS but ever said customer always right anyway?? even stated disputing charge just wanted know misunderstanding future could avoided double checking order  Sorry long rant probably should've stuck if something seems good true probably is  <EOR> Very excellent food especially enjoyed fried rice  just recommendation anyone wants come future order less rice when nigiri would able more value all eat package  come back again! <EOR> Hikari perfectly fine option teppanyaki city   your typical China Town location which gives edge local sushi steakhouse destination   teppanyaki ranges $12 option $35 if combination   meal comes onion miso soup salad rice noodle couple shrimp entree   Portion wise guaranteed full   Quality wise shrimp steak very good but chicken tofu little bland underwhelming   noodles yakisoba which great offers healthier alternative full fried noodle   veggies seemed little raw coming but once chef did magic turned very good although very oily   Hikari does couple really good chili teriyaki sauces which must add   Another option AYCE sushi little less $30   But considering offer some solid quality sashimi oysters sweet shrimp scallops roe menu easily your money's worth   Beer limited Japanese brands half dozen affordable sakes well house $6 50     Hikari definitely good option steakhouse experience side town   chefs might same showmanship other restaurants but food good cooked your liking you'll walk full content  <EOR> This first time AYCE sushi bar   first time place well   Once again highly recommended loyal customer Hikari   My cousin never but she said address seemed familiar   wasn't difficult locate   We walked last night almost 11ish right away greeted irashimasen     always good start= I think slow night since said only sushi bar open open grill table   sat down sushi bar   We ordered AYCE   Basically order anything want list appetizers which included soup side dishes well nigiri rolls   Once again expectations high since AYCE sushi?

Well AYCE place REALLY good selection   already mentioned oysters but also scallop sashimi uni baby sweet shrimp menu   First place seen high price items it     The scallops where lady friend nuts   She probably ate 15 total chef realized this   third time she asked scallops he said Let see your plate! plopped down 6 scallops plate   Then asking enough?    could see eyes light all good chuckle playfulness chef     About 80% way through meal asked whim salmon belly? did!!! Oh man heaven     There drawback food aspect  all eat $28   fresh REALLY think fish is?  fresh enough yummy but fresh enough YUMM O    Uni scallops oysters salmon belly I'd definitely say worth but place back every time vegas   So why 5th star?  made service    where extra star comes in   sushi chefs generous attentive wait staff   tea never empty always fish front us   perks being smaller venue 2 chefs   give more attention   Also they're fun!  sushi chef said All eat anything menu    including me! which lady friend said Okay take you! reply? Okay meet work    only advice he show scallops     My word advice reservation   didn't worry since early but small   see place filling up   I'd say hold 20 people total  <EOR> Amending review last perhaps final visit sushi AYCE place find lack respect freshness quality number turn off aside fear getting bad stomach  poki served looked made few days ago salvaged trash pile displaying grayish color along rancid smell  I didn't even bother risking tasting it  final turn off just bad sashimi was  love salmon sashimi any place eat doing really bad  unfortunate no longer bring friends families place which once served good sushi  Nowadays doesn't even look they're trying  <EOR> Good service  Good food  Better then Sin City Sushi  come back  counter tops  all eat which great value if you're big eater me    Good convenient location  Beautiful women 11PM discount  <EOR> Very good food good value ayce option! Highly recommended   I come everytime visit Las Vegas spot! Better buffets stripe   I tried all sushis menu everything fresh made order chefs   Love bringing more friends over here! <EOR> 3 stars may bit generous    but give 3 stars service  friend keep pouring own green tea since sitting next drink stations lack drink service  He would wait 15 20 minutes then pour himself   2 stars food  definitely quick efficient but because most things already premade    or precracked  asked oysters came 5 seconds later because just sitting bar  thought nice sashimi option but tuna bit fishy sweet shrimp    was definitely sweet shrimp  bit lost words sweet shrimp  Overall impressed won't say place gave horrible stomachache couple hours later lasted 48 hours but probably won't back  <EOR> PROS sashimi warm items available nice servers  CONS oysters kinda weird best rolls ever  I probably back  Because know ayce sashimi <EOR> Never disappointed sashimi here! Where ayce sashimi?! Plus Hamachi kama fresh oysters! Winnahs! <EOR> Here's thing I understand why many five star reviews Hikari   30+ all eat sushi restaurants past few years never seen anyone match Hikari's selection   Fresh oysters sweet shrimp soft shell crab sea urchin roe even sashimi ! which always charged extra normal AYCE restaurants included Hikari's $26 95 all eat price   fish also fresh all food tasted very good   If star ratings based food price alone Hikari would unabashed 5 thumbs up   However service place extremely lacking   worked restaurants server chef always try give workers benefit doubt when things par     but while even stop making excuses them   I would say 30% orders delivered table   three separate occasions party asked Where oysters? servers claimed hadn't ordered them coming they weren't finally unapologetically she informed delivered another table WHAT?!    happened also several other items ordered although did servers trying give food hadn't ordered   Maybe whole gave another table now coming around us   I should say spirit holiday fairness busy night Christmas   should also state unbelievably reasonable price appeals specific group people greedy streaks kilometer wide penchant trying eat most expensive items cheapest price read Asians    full disclosure tablemates along 80% clientele appeared members particularly avaricious brand Asians     Still if you're advertising such great deal food good such shame service slipshod  working incorporating alliteration into prose  ordering delivery method servers much America's current health care system horribly broken inefficient   owners managers should train staff limit number orders taken once avoid wasted food well all pesky missed orders   only bright side gross inefficiency did charge party two large Asahi beers   drank part dull ache witnessing such terrible restaurant management   But way see people always love great deal case people Asians low price high quality always trump poor service   Just any Pho restaurant planet Earth if you're convinced fact    say party others within spitting distance did complain loudly often did   just complaints muffled endless streams oysters soft shell crab uni being shoveled into gaping maws Hikari's customers     end if  customer satisfaction guess don't know is  <EOR> Great selection sushi amazing service  dad's favorite sushi spot Las Vegas! always hamachi sushi  <EOR> Favorite sushi place Vegas AYCE sushi    include sashimi oysters dozen anyone!? nice lots japanese hawaiians those two groups discovered it   Don't expect atmosphere just couple floor noodles dive status but if eat classic sushi gem!! <EOR> I just Hikari Sunday June 14 2015 couple friends  fabulous! ordered miso soup sashimi all different kinds hamachi kama salmon skin salad dynamite oysters soft shell crab various nigiri like unargi ama ebi more volcano roll spider roll can't remember all ordered! Everything delicious! <EOR> First time Hikari! group 17 dinner fit perfectly around double tepanyaki grills  Only 4 people ordered steak off menu but still fired grills put show kids!  Most group ordered AYCE $26 95  waitress taking orders however when food came sushi bar kitchen little chaotic  Anything ordered more 1 person made plated together  pretty sure missed first round Maguro Garlic Ahi Tamago Hamachi because also ordered plated someone elses sushi they didn't ask rest group if someone else ordered just ate it   But didn't speak just reordered next round!  You've try Hikari Roll Frallops Seafood Dynamite Tako Yaki Shrimp Tempura Shrimp Fried Rice Deep Fried Ice Cream  The waitress gracious enough split bill into 5 separate checks auto 18% grat added in    Minused star missed sushi during first round but minor thing!   We'll definitely coming back Hikari future trips Las Vegas! <EOR> We always here  If u love sashimi place right place u  promotion right now if u write reviews u 1 hot sake ice cream why not? <EOR> If your looking AYCE sashimi place many sushi spots Vegas none offer   The quality fish great menu simple many crazy rolls most Vegas spots uni oysters part AYCE menu well! Oh kama! Next time we'll sit bar since bar restaurant doubles teppanyaki house which pretty busy  All all great spot! We'll coming back fish fix  <EOR> awesome service food excellent  come least twice month hasn't disappointed yet  <EOR> Didn't know AYCE place but last minute teammate changed location came here  When saw low star review very hesitant jump cab them but did anyway totally regretted  Nothing close somewhat fresh I'm even asking FRESH cooked items no taste texture stale such hamachikama  Some nasty tasting saw colleagues dipping raw fish overly salty miso soup hope better texture taste but just waste effort   quite gross! Tomago tasted plastic  basically skipped most items even sake good took few sips left $39 bill big regret  Wish listened own instinct! Owell live learn!   Can't wait back Raku sushi house Goyemon cleanse palate <EOR> Went Hikari tonight friends  before many times highly recommended it  disappointed all   They offer broad menu sushi Sashimi included AYCE option   Each roll tasted delicious fresh  The Wynn roll favorite Starburst being least favorite   The service friendly did feel rushed all  remodeling can't wait see looks afterwards    My new favorite sushi spot! <EOR> Food service great! All eat sushi great deal! also order ala carte if you're super hungry  coming back sure! <EOR> This go to sushi place Las Vegas  highly recommend Kama yellow tail sashimi! Yum!!! <EOR> Best unlimited salmon sashimi!!! friends just because it  worth it  <EOR> Came 10pm wed open til 2am teppenyaki chefs gone  Parking lot completely empty besides employees  Miso soup cold baked mussels cold made gag  No bueno $28   Instead trying something new id rather regular spots  Sushi yama2 umiya sushi tachi! <EOR> Tried place first time see other places there  Inside seems old outdated sticky ish half ass repaired  only imagine cooking stations look like  did know server was? Everyone seems doing own thing mention rude when needed something  sushi tasted weird big weird chunk cuts  Never gonna back!!!

Best sashimi fish fresh! AYCE 27 95 give lot     Service friendly but super slow      very unorganized hard time large parties       If food wasn't good would back <EOR> Our large party dined steakhouse section restaurant  delicious experience  One side restaurant serves sushi other steakhouse where patrons seated teppanyaki style around grill  Teppan meaning steel grill  griddle yaki meaning grilled  broiled    The restaurant inviting servers attentive Nick chef excellent  first time but those party before requested him  order meats fish would served savory broth soup mushrooms salad green leaf lettuce pre dressed tasty dressing then Nick or your chef chops sautés assortment vegetables along freshly prepared egg fried rice  He cracks egg right wouldn't kick that? All items vegetables rice cooked meats shrimp plated your chef steaming hot right onto your plate  Lets forget onion tower he lights fire chops altogether its fun experience all ages delicious too  highly recommend it  <EOR> Very good service VERY fresh food!!! taste quality separates Hikari many other places   top outstanding food great service friendly personable staff  <EOR> Oysters die again  Only place eat AYCE sashimi  Highly recommended <EOR> This definitely place if party 4 greater because DON'T TABLES  Unless your whole group would want Teppanyaki grill  different story but if prefer Benihana  anyways because ambiance   understand mom pop kind place but decor screaming need make over  peeling paint 30 year old carpet flickering fluorescent lights drabby setting reminds eating basement college dorm room alone  alone felt when sat grill whole party spread giant semi circle    With mood set say AYCE place comparable rest joint Las Vegas  ordered steak plate which quite soft succulent but Oyshi order all eat rib eye plates almost equal quality   Overall experience definitely unforgettable thanks moments deja vu  Perhaps if wife sat sushi would different experience    <EOR> second time come fried rice really good also baked green mussel  nice service that only place know sashimi ayce <EOR> All favs!

Throughout night also agedashi tofu which pretty bland much flavor even while soaked sauce   also tried few rolls but can't recall ordered others  I'm looking Elnino    Outside mackerel yellowtail nothing else really stood me   all seemed average which maybe explains why offer all eat sashimi   place would frequent regular basis but would come back again  <EOR> I just love ALL EAT UNI!

Service slow typically curt   Selection limited especially rolls    all variations same roll   No diversity whatsoever   nigiri only okay but fresher better places around     My memory place little hazy correct if wrong but seem remember dessert being included part AYCE     There dozen AYCE places within five minutes Hikari significantly better   don't know why anyone would bother place  <EOR> Great tasting sushi  Loved bar  Social yet intimate  come back  Chef helpful  <EOR> Good place come hang away strip speak easy type  Definitely coming again  <EOR> FRSH SUSHI middle desert!

Loved it!!!  Would sure come again!!! <EOR> I came restaurant few years ago remember being really impressed  Last night well    selection very limited WAY overpriced AYCE sushi  sashimi plate takoyaki fried oysters good but rolls tasted bland  Dessert part AYCE menu  Plus really irritating having sushi bar only seating option  way crowded  waitresses needed speak up  friend couldn't hear them most time  AYCE sushi much better place  Kaya Neko Goyemon Naka instead  <EOR> * * 3 5 Stars * * If you're mood eat all fishies Pacific Ocean I'm assuming because closest ocean Nevada your tummies ready! bad option fulfill all your sushi needs if live Vegas if you're frequent visitor but if you're staying strip other options aka buffets galore strip Cosmo Caesar's would personally choose those options versus all eat restaurant    The best thing place sets apart all other AYCE sushi establishments serve SASHIMI  Honestly something wish all AYCE sushi places option because half time really only want fish  salmon tuna sashimi option  More fish love! woot woot!   Eating going cost $30 less when consider tax tip    The fish quality didn't feel best wasn't anything impressive but being Nevada quite ways away ocean's cost shabby there's many different roll appetizer options! also even miso soup!   The service pretty good too! However sometimes think servers confused mixed orders other tables  kept bringing dishes weren't ours multiple orders same thing  didn't mind first thought bad first until realized   it wasn't food it AYCE no biggie but mean still   just little frustrating because didn't look Hikari busy yet them mistaken multiple orders between different parties seated completely different areas restaurant   <EOR> whoa   they actually good food outside strip!!! technically off strip virgin came hikari  first restaurant ever tried something off strip since most time just stay strip exception eating RIO Palms South Coast M    I don't think ever ate Downtown     The sushi buffets usually suck they're usually fresh made sushi chefs  try avoid all types sushi shashimi when those places  AYCE come here  last time $25 per person  just sad place only opens night  means need day before leaving Vegas The place usually packed  However sushi side tempanyaki side I think  called never actually that   I only sushi side  usually full rice accomodate give shashimi only  don't think limit amount uni oysters because done six dozen respectively each time but kind sick lot it  Sick good way lol  don't really pay attention since just start calling sushi chefs if want something don't write anything down   Overall must if don't want eat Strip! <EOR> not impressed long long wait times  nearly 1 hr due staff ignoring small groups attending large parties 20+ ppl drafting review prior eating   thats bored mind am  update if service faster    1 star off 1 hour wait time while half restaurant empty  1 star off ordering miso soup 3 times adegashi tofu twice getting any it   fact octopus sashimi somehow instead  1 star off mixed sashimi quality   First round looked REALLY fresh while second round cut weird looked very old tasted fishy!!  sign should ordering sashimi more single round?

It definitely worth 5 mile trek west Strip   best Hikari just neighborhood ma pa place locals 'must try' destination out of towners   better sushi joints Strip     The raw ostiones looked diet   Pathetic shrunkened undernourished morsels sitting oversized half shells   raw fish nigiris tasted pre cut freshly sliced   salmon skins inside hand roll crispy   fact roll looked  sheet seaweed rolled into cone which exactly 'coz fillings certainly didn't leave any lasting impression     The food kid's menu salty greasy   want kids die young assuming kids don't know any better   I don't know Hikari reviews all stars   Just don't discriminate play games your customers treat them respect  <EOR> My absolute favorite AYCE sushi bar!!!! buffet style Todai but made to order everything fresh!!! saying sashimi quality blew mind anything but when comes AYCE its biggest bang your buck!!!  this restaurant split into two sides being sushi bar other tepan benihanna similiar japanese steakhouse   i never teppan steak dont recommend it   stick sushi     whats great AYCE   unlimited uni unlimited raw oysters unlimited sashimi   bonus u order hama yellowtail colar neck which very tender piece meat    fried rice   i love japanese fried rice but dont full off rice    sushi isnt amazing but def par w any other mid level sushi joint    liked white tuna salmon albacore halibut      i would rather come half buffets strip     <EOR> AYCE Sashimi $26 some change  Holla! beat?  can't tell sushi rice tastes but cuts meat above par many most ayce joints life  Japanese chef yes Japanese if matters you especially sweet!    Favorite sashimi yellowtail white tuna!  sashimi cut extra thick but overall great  Some cuts such albacore kinda broke bit when picking chopstick but favorite cuts yellowtail white tuna perfect! Melt mouth  even offer Uni Sweet Shrimp  Sweet Shrimp SUPER tiny no fried head accompany but oh well   Even fried cooked stuff which most pre cooked since shit comes less 2 minutes since throw your order definitely deelish! Agadashi tofu crisp hot! Prepped pacific oysters just yummy   Tempura nice crisp soft shell crab crab itself! Even fried rice I know know full flavor  didn't care Poke salad just bit much funk cut waaay big enjoy       I loved everything except cooked Yellowtail collar bit bitter dry side    Service excellent!  sign says 11PM AYCE $23 95 hot ladies asked main chef happens if ugly?

Super fast service  <EOR> Food just okay   Great could order sashimi rice fish ratio pretty good   some language issues waitress   Instead giving free cup hot sake writing Yelp review   She charged $15 she recommended  <EOR> Yummy sushi but limited selection   long time ago before Yelp days don't really remember it   Tonight looking AYCE sushi place tired usual places thought we'd try it   They very busy but excellent service   sat table usually used steak service most table booked large group celebrating engagement   first thought we'd would lot crowd but wait staff came around regularly made feel if important     We looked over menu made first few choices   When arrived fresh appearance smells great flavors spot on     There plenty sashimi both red white snapper salmon hamachi magruo tempura   Overall great food but limits selection gets old ordering just sashimi oysters we'll looking try someplace more selection  <EOR> Fresh fish fastest service anywhere!

Nowhere bill did state auto grat nor did show amount  biggest pet peeve! <EOR> I've hearing place while expectations high  First All food better average tried everything  oyster sashimi good  Fair ikura uni   Hamachi Kama could broiled better but good  AMA ebe  small little taste did come heads  Salad very good         service bad !   seems doing favor waitng us   waiting them turn backs ignored us   I would back even food        Oh yes  if yelp them let them see your review free dessert small sake   didn't stick around that  <EOR> This worst service received all Las Vegas restaurants  server walked away middle taking food order  Initially she refused take food order ask share food others whom met first time!!  She refused give check instead she asked finished all food    worst experience   bathroom extremely filthy  Vomit booboo gaga all over place   would give 5 5 rating if given option  <EOR> This sushi really tasty  excellent great service  restaurant fantastic  yummiest  <EOR> This probably best AYCE sushi restaurant ever  saying something!  mean let's honest   AYCE restaurants incomparable pay for you order counterparts because quality lacking anything even though most time is but because satiate different needs   need compare apples apples people   Typically when food higher quality going cost more   simple fact life sense which means no way AYCE restaurant especially sushi could possibly same level normal sushi restaurant   Now being said Hikari best AYCE sushi restaurant ever thus far   rest case  <EOR> We visited Hikari July 11   Friends told 26 95 all eat sushi sashimi   family loves raw fish thought would enjoy it   better expected   order much sushi want if choose just plates sashimi without rice served you   thought quality might lacking because price but better Kaitin sushi places Hawaii   Hamachi good Japan   also order sides such Takoyaki miso soup gyoza many other things   husband son ate much think restaurant happy when left   back next trip Las Vegas  <EOR> The reason 2 stars place offers AYCE sashimi   missing 3 stars due unorganized appearance restaurant servers   seated teppanyaki section which odd   once ordered sashimi came large unappetizing chunks   poor fish looked though unceremoniously hacked pieces    cut rolls WAY much rice   servers would move back forth taking orders several groups time which resulted scrambling fish delivered   baked mussels tasty though   But thats enough come back again  <EOR> Top 10        Must say good things place     Fresh fresh b      always come here     Love it       Cindy v <EOR> Went all u eat special  Never felt full life! Fast service fast refills orders  Just remember finish your entire plate else charge u! <EOR> Omg steal! If car while Vegas love AYCE Japanese love value meal then place go! Yes those Vegas buffets fantastic  mean love share prime rib roasted bone marrow king crab legs whole lot but really Hikari fantastic  never AYCE Japanese sushi bar type selection quality  only bad thing review might actually convince more people try which means longer wait times me  But can't contain excitement!   They entire menu la carte but order anything off menu not just sushi nigiri price $26 95pp! Considering variety items just standard Japanese fare see other AYCE restaurants great great deal  ordered Sashimi combo had hamachi tuna salmon sashimi  tuna looked quite few tendons but rest looked rather fresh fatty Fresh oysters Japanese mignette the oysters though small perhaps little shriveled surprisingly delicious fresh! sauce made better gave kick great accompaniment richness oyster meat Hamachi Kama you also choose salmon kama collar but hamachi kama really great  freshly roasted meat succulent juicy great flavor don't forget ask lemon! really helps bring best flavors Rainbow roll I know thinking rice? Yes rice wouldn't recommend getting rolls but flavor rather good AYCE! White Tuna sashimi Tasted bit frozen but still fatty flavor Hamachi sashimi Fresh delicious Sweet shrimp sashimi seems rare find great! Just good ones ate Japan  plate sashimi served 10 15 shrimp texture yet somehow melts your mouth fantastic Baked green mussels Surprisingly unique texture freshness Dynamite probably more disappointing all dishes  mayo some imitation seafood veggies baked took while Uni sushi Each order comes 2 cannot served sashimi but BEST dish night far considering AYCE  fresh rich luxurious just perfect  only thing could improved upon would seaweed paper chewy Shrimp Veggie Tempura freshly fried perfection Fried Tofu well fried good sauce though if you're big fan something skip unless just want something hot Seaweed Salad pretty norm Fried soft shell crab Really well made perfectly fried all great fried crunchy pieces soft melty innards crab meat inside That's all remember before jump into car start driving Vegas again second round   Notes You order off most items off nigiri menu ask served sashimi they'll add more your order take rice!  Take slow  made mistake being overly hungry ordering crapload stuff front definitely enjoy experience take slow  chefs fantastic friendly definitely worth extra few moments spend sushi bar   Dessert included but isn't overpriced couple scoops ice cream $2 50  <EOR> Chose place based other reviews  place sucked  Service slow sushi menu basic fish only ok  Way over priced  <EOR> this place used favorite sushi AYCE place since moved Vegas  even though don't eat sashimi still come quite often since gf loves sushi uni  even Hikari cap birthday   And yet still decided give them one star? must good reasons  So last night 3 13 girlfriend's birthday dinner  We arrived around 7pm store quite empty sat sushi bar   Service The waitress ok  But chief never really greeted but watching TV most time  understand wasn't busy but attention order something every time annoyed  When he finished making food he just stick arm bar catch it  without saying excuse  your roll ready food almost mouth shove all food mouth hurry down chopsticks grab plate front face    Food main reason upset me  food wasn't good previous visits  oysters tiny fried scallops smaller thicker harder crust  girlfriend's uni look dark fresh  HERE COMES BEST PART later night stayed restroom most night until next morning having crazy diarrhea  at least 6 times You may question may caused other food other Hikari but no did eat anything else yesterday since woke late expecting great AYCE time    Comparing girlfriend she fine Eel sushi Yummy rolls she didn't eat am pretty sure them   Anyway service pleasant food quality dropped food poison nightmare I barely work convention today   shame say goodbye favorite place coming back again  <EOR> Great sushi selection  Definitely come back again eat all eat sushi  Highly recommend place anyone wants fill sushi good price  All eat sushi choices taste great wide variety menu  Choices include sashimi rolls nigiri some appetizers  also mochi ice cream tempura ice cream desserts  <EOR> Yum favorite all eat places Las Vegas! coming years based recommendations family friends  Yummy all eat sushi $30 including alcohol    Sitting sushi bar must since service tables good  sushi chefs attentive those sit closest  Always gotta start raw oysters hamachi Kama soft shell crab sashimi Ikura quail egg salmon skin salad  Try combo sashimi early see what's freshest order more  most all eats there's gonna some type sashimi fish tastes better any given day last time hamachi salmon delicious! salmon skin salad tastes fresh refreshing but portion huge try share  order end don't fill your stomach salad    Uber lyft cost strip less $15  Easy way around Vegas  Enjoy!!! <EOR> This great place! even mochi fancy! all eat great price! ate way more all eat price tag   why feel deal  <EOR> We've many times service good!

No  Yelp review 3 stars mostly due excellent service food  <EOR> Not bad! Definitely deal if love AYCE sashimi! came very late hour seated immediately  chef told let know wanted but he kinda freaked when started ordering told SLOW DOWN!!!! Okay guess hungry hippos long car ride Vegas  Anyway sashimi okay high quality but hey didn't sick AYCE  Can't complain much  Sushi rolls sub par well friend didn't dragon roll said dry   soft shell crab did correct ponzu sauce bf didn't though felt fine itself    Overall everything great AYCE   but just don't expect much  back sashimi needs <EOR> Came MLK weekend group 9 boy did tummy rockin' time!  THIS place made finally ditch fears embrace raw fish!! Can't believe AP Bio teacher Mr  Hendrickson long effect all talk worms parasites      *shudder*    Due former long standing fear consuming sashimi raw fish rolls now realize missed long time only previously ventured 1 other AYCE establishment    made eat rice each order raw      AYCE **sashimi** tastes YUM doesn't ill?? Does even exist LA? tried many different kinds raw delights enjoyed them all   Only heard complaint Uni which looked really slimy scary  don't order folks   Also cucumber salad sucked but all else ordered shared others' plates quite delicious    This place little overwhelmed larger party others previously mentioned service hit miss   Orders lost and first half table's orders weren't even taken! asked more occasion     However 4 stars should tell worth nonetheless  waitress tried hard manage orders 9 foodies DID inundate dozens orders    sushi chef yells lot adorable!  He even came table personally apologize lack smoked salmon take pic party     Can't wait back    maybe even soon couple weekends! <EOR> My favorite AYCE sushi Vegas  only place know actually order sashimi  isn't huge roll menu but fish fresh can't sashimi  oysters little briny if comes sarchia ponzu  back! <EOR> Before eating Hikari tried only two other all eat sushi joints  Todai Honolulu Midori sushi Los Angeles  fight between 3 think Hikari wins hands down    I 4 pieces hamachi 4 uni 4 salmon 2 garlic tuna 2 ikura 1 tamago shrimp tempura    must good catch come because everything fresh melt your mouth buttery  rice really good too!  With ratio 5 1 think chef really good memory amount orders he deal too   I definitely back when Vegas again    may even write another review Regardless fact reminiscing food creates much hunger pain  <EOR> Love place!  all eat sushi $27 worth many levels   Delicious all way!

Everything good staff super nice  all very well mannered feel very welcoming  would  omw back again  <EOR> Being its AYCE sushi place expect quality take hit but sushi little below that   tried place twice once bar other time table   If want better sushi experience then pull seat sushi bar   table side service just plain awful   waiter slow forgot things ordered maybe purpose don't know    two tries don't think making third trip   There's just better AYCE sushi there  <EOR>
