EVERY TIME through drive thru order wrong! shouldn't check every sandwich every time through sure right  deserve even 1 star  latest order included quarter pounder without cheese home 2 slices cheese [picture posted]  food cold fries far fresh   don't even include napkins order   Owners pay attention check place every once awhile!       want $15 hour     Yeah right! <EOR> Tried order ice cream cone but machine broken  Okay but tried order Sprite but machine broken    Stop playing emotions McDonalds  <EOR> The drive thru staff always great! They're fast courteous hardly ever order wrong vs other fast food restaurants constantly order wrong   always count drive thru staff amazing   The drive thru PACKED layout shopping center location won't getting two lane drive thru makeover even though really needs it  When drive thru busy during peak breakfast lunch dinner times usually inside never very busy inside  staff inside usually isn't nice drive thru staff but they're still pretty great!  Anyway ended going inside time because drive thru line long  wasn't busy inside  quick take order  When fill drink sweet tea dispenser empty  employees saw empty immediately came refill it!

But overall experience okay  <EOR> I keep wondering if management changed because something happened   and good  Before would never waited line extending halfway door cashier  three employees just standing back doing nothing  None them acknowledged said right us  also pushed twice employee passing between trash bag  No excuse sorry  place really gone down hill  want back way was! use best   on game  Now   not much  <EOR> If you're looking quick breakfast really can't wrong breakfast sandwich iced coffee McDonald's   location always quick   I've never any issues orders employees here   only breakfast can't comment rest menu   My mom told oatmeal really good   planning trying next time   husband also loves cinnamon roll bites  <EOR> First off food ok usual staff always courteous  thing say saw teen put mouth fountain drinks pressed she could quick drink  disgusting! know its restaurants fault lack teen's self respect class  hope Mcdonalds staff monitors fountain more closely  <EOR> After visiting many restaurants all over glad live near location first all faster any other McDonalds without doubt choose use lousy speaker system rather real person food always ready time pick window   Never any issues food just want say extra effort people running location doesn't unnoticed staff all friendly professional  <EOR> This worst experience life! 1 normally never eat establishment but very late needed something fast  2 soon pull window hear see staff yelling cussing each other politely sit wait till done place order then wait another 15 minutes food! Which totally wrong order! But point over waiting listing staff argue! <EOR> I mean McDonald's pretty good food service wise  just think 5 star McDonald's would something find somewhere New York   <EOR> As far McDonald's decent McDonald's serve breakfast 24 hours day now  total bonus drive thru really packed  stuck line earlier didn't even know Drive Thru line which really confusing sure know if wanted through drive thru walk handled quickly because line drive thru could seem waiting everybody pass don't know all very strange  spend extra couple minutes life trying navigate through all cars thought waiting pull into intersection Silverado Ranch when really just waiting into drive thru McDonalds  FINALLY service good food decent seemed sitting couple minutes but wasn't huge deal  Two stars McDonald's  <EOR> awesome customer service food always good fresh! best mc donalds city  management does really good job continue come long food good <EOR> Worst service ever morning 4am !

Never compromise Coca Cola drinks would hate cross over another brand  Restaurants should mindful dispensing units ensure lines full bag box running through lines keep ice maker full ice  Thank you! <EOR> The best hospitality witnessed McDonalds  All crew managers engaged customers  Food came within 3 minutes all food tasted fresh hot  large order managers helped table    I also fresh flowers put each day  cleanliness Restaurant above average  saw fully staff restaurant crew didn't seem stresses rather enjoyed job    This snap shot review am sure if through day might experience something different  first visit outstanding  <EOR> I know reviewed some she said should eat better but sometimes just don't time send work schedule sometimes just need something quick  lot drive thrus day always seems late night always off  always doing something else other paying attention window  if always seems food sitting quite some time  Oh well guess sometimes pay for  <EOR> I just few days ago   ordered daughter kids meal thru drive thru   women first window very nice professional   When drove next window pick food women just handed juice then handed kids meal   whole time talking fellow coworkers   saw only back whole time   No hello no thank anything   weirdest thing   husband shocked happen   Sorry Mcdonalds bothering you   funny thing think she manager because she wearing different color everyone else  <EOR> Super busy morning classic McDonald's guess positive being busy nice fresh breakfast!! <EOR> I morning service guy youngish black guy working order window absolutely terrible  He took order rudely ordered iced vanilla latte  pick window gave hot drink asked if could iced he very nice let know didn't iced lattes asked if way could just iced coffee then since guy ordered didn't tell no iced lattes  nice guy back iced coffee hear first guy back talking much crap saying he read order back which he didn't ordered hot coffee liar he right wrong  Which work customer service we're always annoyed customers but he's literally saying all two feet away me  Thankfully guy made coffee fast very apologetic mix other wise would gone right talked manger  100% going back here  <EOR> Ordered sausage biscuit  Drive thru tells cooking wait minute parking lot  10 mins later Im still friggin waiting here!!!!!
