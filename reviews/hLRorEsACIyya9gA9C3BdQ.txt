I loved meal  ordered prawns spicy Thai noodles something that  lobster ravioli appetizer great well  really enjoyed cool atmosphere  very unique dinning  don't think BF cared much though maybe cause he pay it   pricey but nice if plan stay awhile enjoy some wine ambiance  <EOR> Maybe maybe 808 really overdone   When think seafood think simplicity fresh clean flavors     808 tries WAY many things fails more discriminating customer happy The grilled ono tough rock shrimp risotto heavy cream terrible contrast overly salty fish  thai curry basil sauce overwhelming fish     The roasted filet similar something could order large chain steakhouse   put plainly nothing special temperature incorrect     The appetizers definitely most APPETIZING part meal   Order some wine more aptly priced small plates   deconstructed ahi roll nice subtle flavors creative presentation     The dining room flat BORING  <EOR> I haven't several years   but  loved place   pan seared steak good! <EOR> Dinner two $160 + tips 2 appertizers 1 complimentary salad 2 soups 1 entree 1 dessert 1 juice 1 cocktail Hmmm   I wonder why only 4 yelper reviews! say 808? Mai Tai cocktail appertizers rock shrimp risotto crab cakes lobster bisque ordered sure win but only entree special du jour whole tai snapper   yes fish dessert vanilla souffle ordered most certainly flop!  The presentation whole tai snapper impressive caught few attention neighbors but bland overcooked!  Ahhh   reminder self don't judge book cover! dessert souffle sure light fluffy because all taste eggwhites   and undercooked too!   *sigh*  just disappointing because meal complete without dessert generally am anxious high anticipation towards end meal because dessert doesn't come until am through good three four courses before dessert arrives! *sigh*   for such nice restaurant but ending bad note   Nice decor average service average food   Three stars appertizers cocktail soups  <EOR> I'm depressed see negative reviews place  ventured last time LV canceling Bradley Ogden reserv  menu very limiting month week however many times change it decided try 808  plane gotten later then planned around 9 30 pm  place still pretty full  Sparkling water roy rogers my drink under 21 father some sort wine slash beer combo not together order appetizers  ahi tuna dish posters all around casino some rolls then appetizer sampler  two people  didnt finish but wow    everything good  tuna mmm  Wondering where hell main dish wait another 20 minutes good conversation when finally ask dad  He informs ordered yet  Wow  what? Why thought ordered  order promptly  food out    salmon halibut father    record timing  Everything spectacular  Downside wish could wine but alas young still  would back preferably when drink  <EOR> I say 808 waste money   fish came really fishy friend send dish back something else   very expensive some mediocre food server gave terrible service because didnt order wine bring check average up   does place survive? <EOR> Mediocre food price   decontructed tuna roll good but other wasn't extremely impressed food service   wouldn't classify restaurant seafood restaurant    little bit everything menu  <EOR> Took girlfriend sometime 07' when referred concierge hotel   made reservations sat down immediately when arrived   service good food even better greatly enjoyed seafood would say better places Vegas   little pricey w tip $150 but when Vegas $ should never issue    <EOR> I'm surprised all negative reviews because pretty good experience   tried seafood tasting menu while friend shellfish tasting menu shared dishes each item delicious   learned restaurant transport 'A Pacific Cafe' Kauai HI no disappointments   didn't rate 5 stars because price paid would expect level service par experienced Picasso see review Picasso    All all very pleasant dinner  <EOR> If don't seafood come here! only few other choices day even wanted   I just think  crappy waiter should tell before decide your meal  really disappointed    I eat appetizer dinner the risotto because wasn't anything else  okay   I split friend   I think $14 then made pay $5 split charge didn't tell us!! would ordered two things if knew charge going 1 3 meal   Just watch out! really disappointed! many other fabulous place eat Vegas! <EOR>
