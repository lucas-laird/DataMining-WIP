Tasty! <EOR> I excited try place when heard chef used restaurants frequent when LA   am forever waiting authentic HK style western cuisine restaurant open Las Vegas where good baked pork chop rice dish   Well although place didn't dish menu did try baked portuegese pork chop rice dish   flavour quite good portion quite large   also tried hot pot rice waiter's recommendation   took 20 mins it   flavour good but hot pot rather small wasn't any hard crispy rice bottom pot   hard crispy rice differentiates good hot pot rice average one   give dish average rating   give place 3 5 stars now   see potential restaurant come back try more items menu  <EOR> I brought co worker lunch before driving back Cal  place dead BC fatal car accident which closed off access North Decatur   Our order won ton soup Kung pao beef orange chicken  won ton soup came first but broth dark soy sauce  won ton tasty full shrimp included Chinese greens  When other entrees came chef made Mongolian beef instead Kung pao which ended accepting since hurry  orange chicken decent tasting nothing spectacular   The waitress good although ended down grading Tasty Station star due mishaps won ton soup mis ordering  <EOR> I no clue place 4 star waitress friendly kind clueless   8 people she asked many menus need   asked drinks entire page great Hong Kong style drinks available   Only soft drink available   hope food good but atmosphere welcoming try left    <EOR> Stopped some food   ended getting GREAT food! Loved French style filet mignon! place opened recently off great start! <EOR> The flavor food solidly authentic   am speaking Hong Kong native   decor rather drab   need redecorate if want attract hip Hong Kongers   bright friendly waitress didn't speak Cantonese which unusual but cares if food tasty?    Our Singapore style chow fun just right amount curry flavor   ong choy seasoned well plentiful  didn't over salt veggies most restaurants   honey ginger chicken just right sweet tanginess   wish more meat chicken bits though   XO yee mein spicy unctuous   noodles smoother texture though     When only 2 3 tables   am thinking if more business able attain better ingredients food excellent level   think great potential because chef obviously knows he doing   He just needs hands resources  <EOR> With simple cafe like restaurant only 1 thing     Tasty food just that  few times now    randomly ordered selection menu ordered some usual fave Chinese dishes staff recommendations no complaints far  <EOR>
