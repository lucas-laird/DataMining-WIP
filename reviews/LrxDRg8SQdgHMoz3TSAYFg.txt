No  not know of 5 star place   Are better places Filipino food? Sure but found  closer 20 minutes away? No    Is food decent? Yes   Is sometimes wait food? Sure when gets busy  If don't want wait then drive 20+ mins next filipino restaurant   Everything good  Halo halo bicol express binagoogan fried rice sinigang lechon kawali kare kare sisig longanisa fried rice tocino  see lot   There's areas improvement almost all dishes but heck until another Filipino place opens  closer 20 mins keeping 5 star rating DT's  <EOR> Too bad employees don't know anything catering event side business  person say coordinate event still ask boss if she book it  boss supposedly does respond text messages only way hold whenever he decides appearance  Poor management businesses fail  Customer service expected town if only employees given empowerment knowledge business would receive more stars great reviews  <EOR> First time here  crispy chicken lunch  $8 99 gets soup rice pancit 2 shanghai lumpia half chicken!!!

While food okay didn't taste authentically Filipino me   The service hit miss  would times where waiters waitresses would always check followed periods neglect  Also waiting time food really long considering wasn't busy   Overall place alright  wouldn't way come again but wouldn't throw fit if someone going take here  <EOR> I don't understand all bad reviews such tasty place Filipino food!  several spots Vegas LA Bay Area BUT place comes close!

We've several times during week early afternoon service food usually great here  1 star rating experience few weeks back I'm pretty sure checked day     It Sunday afternoon walked all servers dining room just stare few minutes  Finally them comes over seats huge table since all booths taken  menus ask waters melon juice  few minutes later still no water melon juice!   A few more minutes pass server comes back take order still no drinks! ask order lechon because menu clearly says available 1pm which just turned 1pm when arrived  She tells she ask cook if ready because usually isn't ready until 4pm  Then why hell does your menu say 1pm?!   We order binagoongan I think spelled wrong pata tim  She walks away put order guessed no drinks! fried rice comes guy looked he may manager? asks if need anything else ask water granted could've asked someone but no even paying attention walked passed hate when people raise hands say excuse me!   He looks table realized don't drinks he apologizes because server must forgotten    The pata tim extremely gamey if cook pork hock correctly shouldn't such strong pig taste fried rice just ok  mango top fried rice still frozen!   We ask boxes check  look bill just suspected charged melon juice which never got  She asked if still wanted point over didn't even want anymore! took off bill paid card whatever reason can't add tip card unless specify beforehand  asked servers break $20 she tries give bill again!!! told just needed change already paid    She comes back $10 2 $5's assuming would leave $5 worst dining experiences ever!!! wasn't gonna leave $5 because deserved  few times ever left significantly small tip   I've tipped higher baristas to go orders!!!! worked F B over 10 years know important tip especially full service restaurant but no way hell tipping server experience!!!   As mentioned before food normally great service  Throughout service servers behind register texting opinion extremely inappropriate dining room especially when your tables can't even glass water!  Maybe because Sunday lunch time but no excuse forget water servers attentive tables let alone surrounding tables  <EOR> The place crowded if coming your family some guys above average size filipino prepared squished  Service wasn't point keep asking own water refills napkins  food good but prepared all grease food contains you think regular homemade seafoodcity etc filipino food greasy place over top lol charge $1 add little piece leche flan your halo halo does that!!? worth Save your money eat somewhere else  <EOR> Is place still open???

Service alright  <EOR> I am thankful now Filipino restaurant Southwest area   DT's Restaurant great food    I restaurant couple times ordered some food go     What's lacking place customer service   employees need extensive training customer service   No  1 rule greet your customers when walk your restaurant  If you're busy eye contact acknowledge them let them know them shortly   customer feel welcome important   Just observation while patiently waited food took forty minutes ready     The place busy  Nobody checked apologized long wait order  Nobody approached guest stood podium 5 minutes seated he finally left   I support small businesses especially restaurants because very hard money successful within first two years   see restaurant become very successful but management needs train employees   So when eat DT's patient it builds character try ignore horrible service smile just enjoy your food at least didn't cook clean    Gotta give them chance maybe someday change  <EOR> if could give place no stars would  place isnt even runned filipino owner itself  food sucks would rather stay home eat familys home cooked filipino dish owner herself RUDE! everything place HORRIBLEEE!!!!
