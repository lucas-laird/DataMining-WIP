It just happens recently acquired coupon restaurant last Friday   just want clear would happily tried place full price dish looking most forward trying carpaccio you just can't wrong raw beef truffle oil   I'd hope    boyfriend seated greeted promptly   When server came over take drink order he looked down coupon took straight kitchen   Being server long time could tell he happy brought coupon but tried remedy situation being extremely nice   ordered carpaccio pan fried dates steamed clams diabla shrimp grilled octopus sautéed tilapia albondigas merguez   short while tapas started coming delivering first wave server said sorry but carpaccio very popular running tonight  smiled said disappointed oh really? he responded yes  Both boyfriend picked wording but did confront it   strong belief enough carpaccio LEAST another order but didn't want waste table coupon!  night progressed server grew increasingly more impatient annoyed presence   When check he manually written 18% tip   on table 2 always automatically tip 20% even when service bad !  coupon something comped usually tip much more because  fellow service industry workers do    can tell livid am? Unfortunately wish could say only service sub par but food ranged ok even edible   Pan Fried Dates best dish Barcelona   bacon cooked well all textures spot nice savory sweet taste   However red wine reduction way thin blue cheese crumbles stingy side Firefly's much better   Steamed Clams clams cooked well but chorizo very dry   broth also needed more seasoning common theme    Diabla Shrimp liked but again good Firefly's   nice spicy sweet sauce shrimp but sauce little thin   Grilled Octopus just lacked seasoning   octopus pretty good texture chewy but flavor bland   good grilled octopus try Olives Bellagio   Sauteed Tilapia Completely inedible!  sure if kitchen just didn't care if genuinely made mistake but outside fish mushy inside raw   never seen fish texture before honestly can't think happened   Albondigas Meatballs marinara melted mozzarella top   dry drenched each bite marinara   Merguez spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous   sausage dry very spicy   couscous little wet but good flavor   The good thing experience man refilling drinks extremely friendly!

Yes please! hungry hippo self definitely salivated option proceeded order variety tapas quell monstrous appetite   Tapas liked Pan fried dates  Sautéed mushrooms  Hamburger sliders Chicken skewers Mac cheese bacon Beef carpaccio  Pulled pork sliders Vegetarian empanadas House salad  Barcelona fries  Salami banderas Tomato bruschetta  Tapas didn't care for Albondigas found quite chewy very palatable Ravioli am ravioli fanatic part why didn't care high expectations ravioli Stuffed mushrooms mushroom good but sauce mediocre  Now if you're planning doing AYCE just forewarning all tapas available portions even smaller  But order much want big deal  AYCE perfect option because came glass sangria dessert  ordered cheesecake while mother accompanied ordered flan  Both delicious!

Anybody knows tapas Vegas knows Firefly place very comparable   Though slightly pricier Barcelona offers many same dishes frequent when dine Firefly stuffed dates camarones al ajillo la diabla manchego mac 'n  cheese    Red Sangria good but admit prefer Firefly's   But best part they're much closer Firefly if live Southern Highlands vicinity is !  staff always friendly prompt each time come   full service bar couple TVs always some game on   I'd definitely recommend place casual dining lunch dinner  <EOR> Yeap taco day tacos just warm coupl e ounces meat tortillas same     the rest happy hour items ok  well no bueno dollar tacos      <EOR> Unassuming little tapas  place tucked away strip away strip  Friendly wait staff excellent tapas menu  sampled empanadas fish beef tacos Bacon wrapped dates fried goat cheese some sweets dinner  All excellent  fried goat cheese exceptional  service quick beyond friendly  felt right home  would definitely go to spot return trip Las Vegas  <EOR> Tried steamed clams diablo shrimp Filet mignon medallions    all flavorful nicely side rice    A pitcher Rasberry mojito shared between friend I    Service superb pretty busy  Compliments chef! <EOR> One best Happy Hours Las Vegas   Well drinks house wines domestic beers well specialized tapas menu 50% off 4PM 7PM every day   Even Friday Saturday   bad     A few standout Tapas pieces Mac N' Cheese pork empanada well chicken mushroom soup   All very tasty   Drinks good size but if want drink I'd suggest wine beer believe watering well drinks during happy hour    Regardless good service two occasions quite tasty food  <EOR> Amazing food brought back Barcelona  Sangria hit spot affordable price  Food delicious return very soon try all eat tapas menu  place full but yet very servicing  owner approached sure doing good  always plus Vegas find well run mom pops  <EOR> The only decent thing sangria   sure if chef took night off but disappointed restaurant long time   mussels over cooked fishy sauce wasn't even dip able   garlic shrimp fresh mushrooms gritty no flavor   Service good  <EOR> I loved food    Happy Hour awesome      Serviced sucked   last night Marco server he very rude short us     obviously interrupted watching football game   If service better would given place 5 star rating   <EOR> Went three people resturant during lunch hour   where two yahoo employees back trying figure something out   20 minutes waiting acknowledged out  <EOR> I came meet mommy friends mommy night out   decided try all eat sample lot decent price   I ordered steak skewers Barcelona fries stuffed artichokes cheese ravioli Mac cheese beef carpaccio spinach salad pork taco Pretty much everything menu My favorite dishes  stuff artichokes stuff dates cheese ravioli spinach salad Mac cheese I definitely recommend place really fun good definitely good place girls night out <EOR> Normally really place but twice now weekend bf arrived around 11 40 11 45am haven't all ready customers note they're supposed open 11 30am every day week   mean we're talkin door's unlocked but open sign turned off chairs still sitting inverted tables neither owner nor any waiters there   The first time cooks busy kitchen heard come came greet offer something drink eat  He didn't know mixed drinks but happy offer some red sangria  owner showed 20 minutes later apologized offered something else not comped even discounted inconvenience mind you   He seems pretty cool general though   The second time walked 11 40am  11 55am someone just noticed waitress just arrived  Both cook she very nice accommodating but still confused why pretend open 11 30am when clearly barely open noon  could perfectly acceptable actual city Barcelona but come man   All aside food good but used better they've recently changed several menu items worse expectations versus reality clash since menu still old descriptions but shows your table isn't all same   Most menu items have  including sangria  Firefly Paradise does better hands down  But want drive all way often? Hell no  where Barcelona comes in  decent gas saving substitute when craving Spanish tapas just likely avoid going lunch weekends now on  <EOR> The food still wonderful time opened restaurant until now  service always great  Thank Angel being such great server  definitely back  <EOR> I would into detail food but many different dishes would pointless food phenomenal say least  service amazing atmosphere great definitely worth trip off strip  <EOR> Everything ate amazing service impeccable   only recently moved area still exploring nearby restaurants   Wish come sooner   server Ariel like mermaid she told us she fantastic   can't remember last time into place first time person serving said happy guys came in!  going much fun! Come think never happened until came here   recommendations 100% target every time   did all you can eat suggestion tried Pan Fried Dates suggestion tried Beef Carpaccio bunch other things probably cannot spell correctly every dish exactly great she described moreso   When dessert time came around wife already decided ordering Bananas Foster Ariel order said should Bananas Foster dessert   Good! She really guided through menu expertly start finish   whole experience felt invited into someone's home honored guest dining good friends   if said enough GOD food delicious   some items Pan Fried Dates mentioned earlier    never tasted anything life   Truly exceptional   top all prices really quite reasonable   place definitely going back preferably soon   haven't tasted every dish yet place incredible really want try them all  <EOR> I Barcelona   think nice addition Southern Highlands plaza   several times date nights birthday parties etc  etc   As far food food very comparable Fireflys however think sangria just touch better   prefer both white red sangria Barcelona over Firefly's   recommend coming during happy hour 4p 6p 10p 12a more food drinks less!  Just keep mind all tapas drinks discounted though   But doesn't happy hour?  The pan fried dates MUST   Seriously never wrong these   paella entree also really good   does take 30 45 minutes though just aware before order it   They used printable coupon website awesome but alas available anymore  If haven't tried tapas before you're looking alternative Firefly would recommend going Barcelona   good great but good  <EOR>
