Dessert bar OMG BANANA CREAM PIE GOOD! haha  <EOR> Food Mediocre very limited selection   Feast misnomer   The only reason would eat buffet if 1 you've nearly wiped out tables 2 all other eating options Hotel closed can't leave hotel   I contemplated walking other eateries across street Hotel should listened me self   Service however great   servers kind friendly  <EOR> The first time eaten impressed price selection food  time when didn't LV buffets lot nothing compare too  Now opinion changed since last few times Station Buffets   Over crowded people food prepared right  passing station buffets because doesn't matter which casino all serve same crappy food which disappointing because imagine going GVR seeing same slop Palace Station  If ever wait over 30 minutes food again then must mind  <EOR> I making some bets sports book No didnt bet Washington Generals Mr  T Rocky 3 although track record would sense if did friend declared hunger   assessed options then he mentioned buffet   feel much shame riding those escalators   He lets its cheap   agreed   The shame wasn't bad thought would be   When top greeted friendly staff ushered right in   lunch time price boarding pass $6 00   buffet tiny if you're used other Feast buffets Station Casinos you'll immediately disappointed    While selections limited food did decent hot 6 bucks thats all ask for           well soft serve ice cream machine which also had   Highlights probably mac cheese I love terrible buffet style mac cheese fried chicken surprisingly tender roast beef carving station I know carving station 6 dollar buffet gotta love Vegas      Overall solid option if your Palace Station retracing OJ's steps see where he attempted sh*t back  Nothing drive your way but if wallets tight need lot chow its hard place     PS shame returned escalator ride down   People seem staring really?  Did just that?      just don't eye contact it'll ok  <EOR> Good cheap!!!!!!! pretty basic but everything good  pastry chef must well versed culinary arts because best part  place par Hometown buffet its top notch   but can't price  <EOR> I stay Palace Station couple times each year business  While best buffet n Las Vegas quite good especially price  great value   Unfortunately draws lot locals cause long lines long waits well environment filled half dressed people sweat outfits slippers  sleeveless tank tops hairy armpits hanging out   note men venture public thinking such tops qualify shirt don't !

Not trying snob but dress code would nice   The locals business great restaurant but problem guests such myself need quickly   Overall recommend place eat often  selection quality food good   The biggest complaint suggestions management need something bottle neck cashier station  outrageously outdated cumbersome process figuring various Player Card discounts checking ID's antiquated paper process etc   course seems every other customer some issue complication which takes minutes sort out  desperately needs updated using new processes technology  <EOR> The place dump!

This place unfortunately reminds old Terrible's buffet now Silver Sevens  Coming escalator flashbacks   Sadly did gut top escalator u turn   good news better Terrible's even cheaper   bad news read opening sentence   Just don't it   Even if low expectations even if price beckons you're rationalizing lose?  Salad dressings labeled roast beef could more tasteless unappealing well DID look good under heat lamp dunno happened between time guy cut back table! limited selections food just didn't look appealing   Please show some backbone put down your player's card stop thinking price just walk outside head across street  <EOR> Ita low priced buffet line long food 1 2 decent cold  So if your looking GREAT  place isnt it  par  horrible smoke filled casino <EOR> Food descent  Well worth $12 Sunday brunch  But Andrea hostess 5 stars! She's ungodly <EOR> This third time coming eat first back 2009  food definitely improved since then staff always very nice when come here  opinion doesn't much variety foods other Feast buffets but price bad  closer where live boyfriend enjoys meat pasta station lot!

Actually best thing stuffed salmon  Fairly fresh overcooked! Everything else generally pretty good  least 3 4 if served individual dish restaurant would've given 4 stars  Especially price!  As everyone says sign boarding pass before hand! lower rate meal if activate your card playing free games 1st time only   something between $1 10 your card immediately spend your buffet    That takes few more dollars off your discounted price! bad deal vegas! <EOR> If your roast beef GREEN   run don't walk Buffet Palace Station!

Don't want tire fragile lamb   Did mention no behind she would more enough time adjust order?  wasn't happening she let know it   The Feast more Fe    small   Surprisingly so   small buffets but selection really limited   But food matters right?  If fried chicken jerky masterfully placed chicken bone other freeze dried foods you'll feel you're eating best camping astronaut food around   walked around hopes finding some sort culinary salvation but best bad stomach ache meal   The desserts however weren't bad dispenser iced tea okay   did fairly decent job clearing table   And chronicles first last time eat there   might endured mummified food if rude service  <EOR> Definitely well worth budget buffet! food decent you'll definitely bang your buck    My favorite dessert bar self serve icecream a assortment cakes pies!!

The price point fair all you can eat pie a bonus! but overall quality equivalent cheap buffet   said is!
