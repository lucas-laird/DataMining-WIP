Plenty seating very nice employees  <EOR> I come just macaroons  really review taste great   filling think key delicious  staff friendly helpful  price high side but hey gourmet pastries we're talking about  dining area nice spacious  Giving place five star rating no reservations <EOR> The 4 stars definitely Meringues Tart Tropizienne Macarons   The service lack  seems lasting impression   lady behind counter older blonde didn't name very impatient order secondly would think if am paying pastry should able chose which want buy but OH Nooo response cant owners watching camera mad what   really??? Even if true wouldn't want portrait your boss way would think second am paying it   what going mad about? Bad day underpaid she issues?  We sat down receiving pastries continued observe mannerism  other customers   Every time she thought no looking she rolling eyes mumbling under breath   Wow amazing such sweet concept leave such bitter taste   really hope owners catch camera much desired customer service <EOR> Where else escargot crosti 9PM? Nowhere probably   The interior definitely going win any awards but food reliably tasty most part  Also want say service somewhat better Rainbow Rd  drive thru location loved front cashier called dahlink  Planned come just some late night macarons but snagged single peanut butter then opted aforementioned snail toast  portion quite large pictured halved garlic bread loaf topped seven eight escargot liberal blanket cheese broiled order  Overall taste could use smidge more seasoning salt pepper maybe would perk tiny bit more  Taste just tiny bit unbalanced but quite tasty   I again bit put off male employee rear store ordered escargot him  case next read order title off signage window  front him  His first reaction grimace then Let check see if that  Then he crouched down pulled tray eyeing them apprehensively   Had craving escargot overwhelming likely would cancelled order left  order tasty feel just fine  probably eat again  But someone needs chat male staff company    see review other location more info  <EOR> Oh those caramel macrons!

But if don't want stay fat lipo place conveniently located next door Patisserie Manon  <EOR> Now macarons all rage thought I'd check macarons scene while Vegas  Bouchon Bakery obvious place but thanks Yelp app also found Patisserie Manon tucked away strip mall   There's much bakery huge assortment classic French goodies section sit down eat savory items flavor macarons  But overall ambience bakery cafe stark doesn't cozy French feel would want return hang out   Other reviewers raved $1 macarons thought deal! Disappointingly enough macarons also much smaller say Paulette's Chantal G    Think between quarter half dollar sized  texture macarons perfect though crisp shell tender interior good buttercream fillings  But color choices put off  want raspberry macaron light red pink odd adobe red color  Why vanilla macaron baby blue? Sure if close eyes taste great  but eating involves all senses food choices sight   The croissants quite good  very flaky buttery  half baguette long sandwiches ham Swiss cheese even bigger anticipated enough two share $8 something  impressed house made pates sale   We also ordered coffees again amenities dulled experience  When asked sugar cream seeing customary station directed packets sugar half and half type individual creamers tables which where also picked napkins  industrial style paper towels  Go food but unless don't care cozy atmosphere  food close 4 stars but ambience 2  <EOR> Really tasty food! French onion soup fantastic quiche lorraine yummy macaroons absolutely delicious!

Next time you're driving down Charleston passed Whole Foods you'll see guy waving arrow sign says French Bakery turn check least Macaroons     I dying try place finally chance Sunday afternoon   5 stars quality taste pastries but only give them four lack friendly service lack signage once inside bakery which ironic since hired guy just in!  Maybe time read review made few improvements   You walk you'll see counter pastries cookies some tables but  wasn't sure if someone seats if just sit wherever?    Then towards back there's another counter savory treats here   sandwiches soups etc  another cash register but can't see counter walk in  walk all way back while asking yourself back ?  sign? sit anywhere?  etc  very confusing customer  People just cut line if you're trying read menu just right front stand next counter can't passed regulars radar rookies   The array pastries seemed limited but late day sure already sold many?

Right away when walk your left fridge cakes truffles macaroons    walk down lil further find croissants rolls  If walk down even further see there's small cafe serve coffee tea sandwiches quiches etc  decided chocolate croissant eclair go  Before left though decided ham chesse croissant  heated 5 minutes yummy ham cheese sandwich  thought pretty delicious but 6 dollars pop might lil pricey    How did everything else fair? chocolate croissant ok  croissant wasn't very flaky wasn't best chocolate croissant ever had  eclair pretty delicious though  definitely liked custard inside sweet but perfect  Both items came around $5 00    Overall enjoyed Patisserie Manon  back try things cafe ground beef mashed potatoes!   definitely recommend anyone sweet tooth sweet tooth  <EOR> Such fun place many fancy delicious pastries lunch tasty too  <EOR> I wanting come FOREVER! But some reason just never happened  Finally sunday part town around noon decided drop breakfast first   As understand place used bevery small few tables  But guess because its popularity surged expand  started bsitro area where ordered ham turkey croissant  sprinkle ton cheese over plusthe bechamel sauce kind overkill me  But did its job filled up   After breakfast headed front where macarons  really gone for! each ordered chocolate pistachio strawberry raspberry coffee  loved them all except raspberry  would've bought 50 if budget and waist size allowed it  <EOR> Looks search good French Macrons come end!  Flavors chose Blueberry Lemon Rasberry Coffee Peanut Butter Strawberry Pistachio Caramel Salt Butter Vanilla    They're prettiest French Macrons you'd see featured front some culinary magazine but TASTIEST ever had  palette quite bad taste things no else tastes can't taste everyone tastes lol but when say blueberry blueberry  majority places Vegas some most flavorless macrons charge ridiculous amount them anywhere $1 50 $3 00  heck?! Manon sells theirs $1 00 each pack punch full flavor! think they're worth more other ones town but  don't tell Manon don't want them raise prices! P  We ham turkey cheese croissant split pea soup French onion soup salad  Personally wasn't fan split pea generally fav but there's taste diggin' but husband liked took over French onion which did enjoy  croissant AMAZEBALLS  salad deceiving    bowl boring romaine slices ham shredded cheese     Then honey mustard vinaigrette holy crap  completely underestimated dressing!

Patisserie Manon's macarons definitely worth visit here! While lots other pastries baked goods delectable looking cakes front store eyes set colorful macarons behind glass display greets moment walk into store  macarons little differently shaped ones am used more flat cookie like strange puffed shells making them longer less wide am  used to  color shells also look little artificial because bright  BUT amazing    I bought eight macarons trying test all different flavors  Overall felt macarons really puffy texture upon first bite but then became chewy afterwards making perfect combination shell filling give great macaron enjoyment    My favorite flavors were Rose heavy  contained perfect flowery taste delight tastebuds  shells pink white!   Salted Caramel loved flavor caramel! sticky but good consistency worked really well shells   I also really liked lemon strawberry  didn't taste extraordinary but very good taste  strawberry even bits real strawberry inside filling    Flavors a ok Ginger Interesting flavor but cup tea  love ginger candy but thought taste little weird macaron  also really sticky    Mango interesting but bit artificial liking    Pistachio thought pistachio good almond flavor shell filling also decent  big fan pistachio macarons but okay    Mocha wasn't strong mocha taste but liked it  memorable but something would try again!  When buying macarons informed salted caramel mango back  don't know if would told if hadn't asked them flavors but am big salted caramel macaron fan would definitely bummed if missed flavor!
