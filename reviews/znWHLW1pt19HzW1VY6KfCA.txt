Dry biscuits no flavor chicken Benedict  Chicken nothing special   Save your $ ihop  <EOR> Like everything else Rio Hash House dead   I know only serve breakfast lunch food but when did Hash Houses close early? 3PM closing?! While all other restaurants Rio seemed closed down heading direction closing 3PM  says can't breakfast food dinner?! There many many Hash House locations opened Valley last several years probably worst location come to  restaurant extremely dead tourists misfortune stay Rio packed post convention center events   The food good overpriced but portion size it  wish half size portion option  If order meal you'll getting 2 because there's no way you'll able finish single setting   Andy chicken waffles Andy's benedict most popular signature plates here  Both good prefer benedict  Ask without tomatoes! <EOR> Hash House sickening exercise wrong American dining ever expanding waistlines backed food gouger television series Man vs  Food    classic blend gluttonous amounts average food immense portions single platter enough feed European family 4 Hash House hand hand Las Vegas all ridiculous wastefulness   Observing diners Rio location being farm patrons stuffing themselves troffs jumbo pancakes biscuit platters other artery clogging dishes  <EOR> Huge portions good food  Could uses little help service  ate breakfast two mornings same waitress bussers seems more attentive hostess wait staff  <EOR> The chicken waffles favorite    prepared wait  Bit price tag but overall good experience  Accommodation large groups   Service very good  place gets busu weekends  Would cpme back lunch dinner  <EOR> The food ridiculously portioned few people  five eating three plates couldn't finish it  famous dishes loved each  Such crazy food apple juice even greg squeezed! <EOR> Another dining offerings Las Vegas Rio casino Hash House Go Go chain eateries features heartland inspired cuisine portions would literally choke Great White Shark!

Corned beef hash delicious chicken fried steak meals also brought fast  given amazing customer service definitely recommend location  <EOR> Let preface warning come only if big appetite prepared share    If leave still feeling hungry should eating buffet instead  Most items finished normal sized human being but two items stretch your stomach its limits    The item share made famous Man V Food  mashed potatoes biscuits fried chicken    food coma ensued    The quality food decent best breakfast food but certainly worst  service attentive made sure experience pleasant one  would definitely back if ever wanted drown gambling sorrows wonderful wonderful carbs  <EOR> Great place eat   Recommend brown sugar pancakes   Definitely come back bring kids <EOR> I've eaten couple times just don't hype all about   portions wasteful food just okay   nothing farm fresh it  Service fine though  <EOR> Hash House never disappoints especially when comes portions!
