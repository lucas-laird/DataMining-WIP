Next when front assistance assistant managers pointed young inexperienced hostesses said talk them then continued conversation  spoke hostesses let bartender know he forgot drink retrieved cup back table  deciding if possible give negative tip manager came over   He very helpful very apologetic gave resolution  Conclusion everyone overworked useless  Wait until staffing problem resolved  food expensive but could worth it  <EOR> Think good cheeseburger stayed paradise   Nothing exciting chain burger every burger party overcooked  Order wrong  Likely would back nothing exciting location sits back  mall   probably try other burger joints before one <EOR> I best Kailua pork sandwich ever! pastrami burger also very good  Beware adding fries 2 50 worth it! Ice tea 3 50  <EOR> Surprisingly good black bean burger firm decent flavor   Served whole wheat bun default which nice came very good guacamole top   able ask no cheese vegan treat delicious   son loved regular burger too  <EOR> Famous Seasoned Fries? famous same frozeb section Costco   below average french fry served luke warm   kids meal mac cheese boxed   Kalua Pig Sandwich bland   couldn't taste sea salt nor sesame mayo   Eat somewhere else  <EOR> I didn't quite feel Hawaiian vibe   beach ocean?
