Stay tuned!  soon know update again! hope store that'll stay put more than    uh    year? <EOR> Today first time shopping am very disappointed way employees act very unprofessional loud joking carrying personal conversion each other conversations childish employees seem bunch over grown children no self discipline acceptable customer service skills <EOR> I've Haggen's twice far they're only middle road  first visit would rated them 4 because produce department impressive selection good produce  second visit rate 2  fresh baked bread very hard top deli lacking cheese  variety deli meats no problem there  But cheese? only signs four types cheese zero blocks display  But large grocery store deli gotta cheese right? ask half pound provolone employee reaches into case where there's small saran wrapped package cheese  He tells all provolone he weighs it   45lb say close enough but ask all cheese? He's apologetic but all he say all have  If cheese truck broke down cheese cooler died he'd said something right? Okay only other cheese see small package maybe swiss  every other deli customer rest day or until whenever find couple blocks cheese s o l  other lucky guy only wants small packet swiss  prepackaged dairy section? another store more likely  agree another reviewer said something along lines store says they've business 80 years should little more together this  PS Haggen's Don't let 3 stars swell your head would've given 2 5 if option  But don't worry back  see ration cheese plays out  <EOR>
