Good Greek food right off Charleston near Summerlin   Lots folks visit tell you're affluent part town because all cars parked outside!  lowly Acura parked between new BMW Mercedes coupe   Dang did feel poor   Oh well suck rich people eat Yassou too!  Upon entering restaurant definitely reminds diner movie Fat Greek Wedding    White blue dually represented!  Nice little family run place   Wasn't particularly busy place day noticed lots folks doing take out picking large catering trays glitzy parties     Menu displayed prominently huge boards right above service counter   Kinda hard miss!  Menu varied traditional Greek fare items more modern palette   course stuck Greeks know   know pretty darn tasty   Throw spanakopita dolmades hummus aside   show meat!  Although sure those items menu probably pretty good some carnivorous action   The wifey Souvlaki Combo beef chicken skewer marinated house lemon herbs spices   plates came Greek salad rice pilaf pita bread tzatziki sauce   Overall plate good   skewers nice serving could definitely taste lemon herbs throughout   beef skewer juicy but chicken skewer little dry probably because breast meat which tends dry out    Greek salad good feta tomato cucumber olives lots red onion which wifey didn't really like topped house vinaigrette   Tasty   Pita bread tzatziki sauce good pita being warm soft tzatziki being good complement dipping things to   wasn't fan rice pilaf though didn't much me   probably because more sticky rice kinda guy   Overall decent plate   What really should ordered kids ordered   almost wanted switch halfway though meal!  popular Big Fat Gyro gyro sandwich flame broiled sliced beef lamb feta cheese lettuce tomato onion tzatziki sauce   Along large order Greek fries fries herbs spices feta cheese   stuff delish!  thin sliced beef lamb all combined into gyro made wonderful dish   hard put down few bites!  definitely instead next time visit Yassou     Prices kinda high side I'm cheapie eater but guess if want quality food gotta pay it   plates $9 each gyros tad over $7   Fries separate cost another $3 so   Servings generous though   plus side serve Coca Cola!
