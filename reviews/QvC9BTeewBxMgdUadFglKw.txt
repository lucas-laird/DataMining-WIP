We going quite bit dinner specials liked specials pretty good appetizer dessert! only thing don't expect big dessert very small! pay guess!  Time time seemed servers just take time care if your drinks filled if need anything  kitchen door where walk ask where waitress was!!  I think need new staff wants work needs work them service tables better  Some act just much them  Unless see service changed would rather eat buffet Irish pub across way! <EOR> Ok let's real  When look place you'd expect get  very reasonably priced specials really cheap  But classic example pay for  food mostly barely step above Denny's and sometimes below it frozen vegetables canned packaged everything else  <EOR> Slowest service west useless management only adequate food pervade little Promenade  given place try 3 times  Each time mild expectations came disappointed  Just because cheap food doesn't justify mediocre service  think service quality inverted  manager should lead team customer service  far bus boys most helpful then capable servers reasonably kind managers simply ignorant oblivious non regulars  surf turf special $9 99 menu  early riser specials $3 99  But don't expect much them tough steak small rubbery lobster tail over cooked bacon  Good luck one  <EOR> Awful service  Awful food  WOW  Avoid all costs  Reuben made question love Reubens company said cheese tasted plastic  <EOR>
