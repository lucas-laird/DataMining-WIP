Did drive farm potatoes fries?  waitress no where found   People arrived getting food   Finally waitress made appearance but table   saw look over oh crap look face   Then another 10 minutes later food came out   think she forgot order rather come tell she avoided then brought food later     The food mediocre best definitely worth 45 50 minute wait ordering   waitress never came back refill drinks either   once   Needless say she didn't big tip never back again  <EOR> So enjoyable ultimate Star Trek experience max!
