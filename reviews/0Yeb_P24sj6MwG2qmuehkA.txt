Good food price  Location isn't best if you're staying strip  If you're staying between Treasure Island Circus Circus just walk able  Anything else really no go   They add mandatory 15% service charge  Careful note case didn't notice then essentially double tipped! <EOR> If you're looking quick drink before start your day recommend come first !
