Service 3  We didn't many interactions waiters outside ordering asking few extra things   As California native Little Saigon used ordering Vietnamese Vietnamese restaurants  However sure if all waiters speak Vietnamese fluently because waiter seemed hard time understanding order   Ambiance 4  Pho Saigon 8 small restaurant tables kind close together  But decently clean cool  <EOR> Came lunch other day since side town  came bunch friends seated immediately    I ordered small pho brisket beef balls  friends large pho #18 egg rolls  rolls first without really looking menu assumed spring rolls fried rolls since lot Vietnamese places call spring rolls egg rolls uncooked rolls summer rolls  But guess every Vietnamese place differs? Kinda confusing tho told them wanted fried ones back order  first told just take eat them since ordered but why take something won't eat right? pho other hand good  lot green onions which personally broth flavorful  But friends felt only difference large more soup bit more meat  didn't lot noodles accommodate meat usually that  pho lot noodles but enough meat  4 beef balls cut half 2 full size beef balls 4 pieces brisket  left lot noodles leftover  Pho 8 10 egg rolls good tho! 10 10  Customer service decent  feel lot Asian places customer service just whatever  friendliest but also meanest  guy always came refilled water +1 them!
