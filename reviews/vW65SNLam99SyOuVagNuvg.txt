Worst restaurant trip hands down  Loved decor but service obnoxiously slow food no better bland  tried tasting menu besides getting order wrong I only think husband's accent meeting server's accent causing train wreck food just wasn't enjoyable  tacos el carbon but all could taste tortilla  didn't Sangria but husband did but drinks watered down  Worse husband ordered second Sangria glass double size glasses received first go round when drink part fixed price menu  Count extremely non impressed  <EOR> I honestly think deserves more 2 5 but hey feel being nice    We came semi large group 8 people  seated within 15 minutes which excellent    Then waiting began   inattentive somewhat condescending waiter took orders 40 minutes  friend ordered drink when came par when she complained waiter nerve instruct drink if she didnt know!

Served warm banana ice cream caramel sauce  don't want miss these  did stop just churros  You'll thank me   Compared most restaurants Vegas prices weren't high  But there's way much great food Vegas days  can't imagine Diego's A game  <EOR> My review really based restaurant portion venue but more hours when turn place into club scene   It Saturday night around 11 30pm when place really started picking up  Dj pretty good he played lot variety kept people dancing  However seemed everyone trying pack into area next bar instead spreading throughout rest place   definitely elbow elbow room mostly most clubs    The bar very stocked  also variety drinks even numerous amount different type tequilas  margaritas very tasty well proportioned    Overall good atmosphere decor nice place seemed very alive    Like said cannot contest food but hopefully able day  am quite curious  <EOR> I want fair ol' Diego  Yelpers think your experience kind place depends context    Me? looking tasty relaxed place lunch casino    Key words tasty relaxed lunch casino   I ordered Chile Colorado friend ordered tamales  both pleased enough  Would return another meal? Probably not  Diego's fault  food fine  But would worth trip strip local  But if staying MGM place great  if partying MGM place even better   See mean context?   They probably deserve four stars based meal  Three things keep Diego coveted four star approval 1 friend slightly less impressed meal    2 seemed crazy overwhelmed conference  Don't notice things? wait staff remained professional read composed but hostess clearly frazzled  why don't open more dining area huge lunch rush? Oh well sure reasons  said won't back won't spend any time worrying such things   3 salsa rather pedestrian   In short Everything fine  just need more   heart Mexican food if going travel strip battle crowd  <EOR> Gosh did hate restaurant  being high traffic area Vegas am shocked remains open   Food came during happy hour only allowed choose mediocre 10ish item menu  No impressed two party horrible food poisoning pork  think worse vacation food poisioning? Bland all it   Service took over 20 minutes check closed out  middle day bar half full  waitress just disappeared solid 10 minutes  busboys accidentally dumped salsa me  mistake course but Diego isn't replacing those stained clothes   Ambiance okay  seated next open doorway led hotel walkway very loud  Probably better seats house had  <EOR> Let start saying am picky eater  takes lot find something am willing eat   We ended girls night dinner  OMG food awesome!!!!! table side guac die for  practically ate whole thing said forget dinner  pork tamale yummy  comes bit mole sauce top it  Loved rice! would totally eat again  Others table said enjoyed meals well    The service so so  never few things asked straws hot sauce etc  lot different people waiting just your server  made things bit difficult when trying track down server check    Price wise cheapest thing strip nor most expensive  meal plus guac probably $30ish    They menus outside restaurant view your options along pricing  highly recommend checking out   ***I'm little confused reviewer said airport  Mexican restaurant airport but it  MGM Grand between casino pool shopping corridor  <EOR> Not amazing  food cold looked if sitting under heating lamp  chicken good flavor  But it  <EOR> I dinner totally overpriced worth it  far better places eat MGM overpriced somewhat worth it  place strange strange service  woman damn talkative talking herself front table would routinely vanish long periods only seen chatting various customers  watched chat table across way literally 10 minutes while waited bill  She seemed nice but way reasonably timely service  food itself ok more aptly uninspiring  There's gotta better Mexican food around  know it   And guacamole 10 dollars? don't care if made table  highway robbery  other hand salsa chips bring very good  <EOR> I rarely MGM but always dinner Diego  made scatch guac good gets  can't without ordering it!

The bad food is     ok  salad suffered tendency sweeten everything while core ingredients top notch overall salad little much handle terms its sweetness the dressing   Reluctantly could only eat half it   which soft fish tacos arrived  biggest disappointment  Why? Flavour or should say flavor   none  Seriously  ended lumping some salsa drizzling some lime juice chips'n'salsa fish tacos brighten them     Total bill 2 beers starter salad main tacos $49 before tip  reason rating two star review  Meh indeed! $30 all in would disappointing but kinda ok value for money point view  $50 plus $10 tip service good 20% seemed appropriate rip    Not going again until something changes  <EOR> Above average salsas fancy salts try!

<EOR> Unfortunate place closed per other Yelpers posts fact MGM removed Diego list restaurants really fan   Table side guacamole always really good  Dinners always good great depending which dish  The selection tequila always diverse quality   The wait staff always knowledgeable particularly Saul favorite waiter asked every trip last 5 6 years multiple times per year   Now find new source tequila tasting Vegas! <EOR> Summary   overpriced imitation Mexican food located MGM grand    The good   the table side guac  highlight very very tasty  service also fast friendly  If chips served guac hadn't overcooked slightly burned you know burnt chip flavor would very good    The bad   the food average poor everything overpriced  excellent Mexican food falls into inauthentic imitation gourmet bucket  When order combination plate you're receiving three small versions typical fair  ordered Diego combo plate  fish taco ok pretty salty chicken enchilada AVG best beef tamale terrible   With all options Vegas even MGM grand would highly advise going somewhere else  better  Really lot better  <EOR> Delicious! running late reservation did give problem when informed them it  hostess miserable but wait staff made personality  decor feel you're Mexico kept clean  ordered Sangaritas which nice sized drink  found later if don't finish your drink ask To Go cup bar take your drink you!
