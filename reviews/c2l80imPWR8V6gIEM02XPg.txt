Kinda MEH   Very MEH   favorite type hole in the wall Chinese food like   Maybe execution?  Maybe because delivered eaten restaurant?  just wasn't great me   food Panda Express think even more   Here's dealio The lo mein OILY   greasy   Greasier usual   Very slick going down yummy  The egg rolls pretty basic   Possibly store bought just fried   But damn ginger strong them  The beef broccoli average   wasn't bad but wasn't stellar either   find any Chinese restaurant here  The sweet sour pork hard!  Might overfried stood long before serving   bits pork difficult chew   Taste ok but damn did lot onions through  Main saving grace chicken fried rice   best thing plate s    itself pretty yummy but hard mess fried rice??  If work luncheon catered again Chinese would probably decide somewhere else   food Red Shrimp really under par best taste   guys need step up! <EOR> Bus late popped caught lunch special $6 22 including tax egg fried rice garlic chicken egg roll   Great deal lunch glass water service quick portion ample quality par expectation quick satisfying lunch  <EOR> We beef lo mein its super yummy! give HUGE portion could probably split 2 people! leftovers which didnt eat prices inexpensive prepare food quickly its still hot when home!
