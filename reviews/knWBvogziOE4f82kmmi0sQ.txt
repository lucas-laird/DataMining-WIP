Best mex town living right next proven quite dangerous wallet especially bomb drinks  10 10 would recommend  <EOR> I don't really know start but go   talking trying Leticias ever since heard opening  excited but now am beyond disappointed  ordered queso fundido which came literally swimming butter oil  Then fajitas came say no authentic Mexican flavor all  All could taste ginger  tasted Chinese stir fry  only start everything  work industry poor server weeded he didn't know where start  no manager sight  seemed understaffed  stayed 2 hours only because couldn't decide if should try call manager over say something server but once did see manager he such unapproachable attitude decided against plus long wait everything else probably would taken way long over  only highlight everything busser should really server  personality delightful more attentive rest staff  disappointed frustrated everything visit know going back  <EOR> This beautiful restaurant located inside Tivoli Village  outdoor bar area well indoor  tried quesadilla appetizer  very good though small side  also guava margarita  guava mix excellent! Though must say little light tequila happy hour  chips salsa good chips being freshly made salsa very fresh  bartenders very attentive friendly  <EOR> So Leticia actually walking around ensuring guests being taken care of  nice touch  Leticia's newest location Tívoli village simply amazing  chips hot fresh  salsas tasty but bean dip die for  food comes large portions many selections choose diverse menu  burrito Chile rojo amazing  service great want try dinner next time! <EOR> Went Leticias birthday must say although food good service terrible  server MIA most time food took hour arrive  He never took drink orders telling he kept forgetting  He told hurry because closing soon pissed off because asked split checks  top off gratuity included which he didn't deserve  Definitely coming back! <EOR> I high hopes place but unfortunately failed miserably some aspects dining experience  came Friday 7 15 reservation 11 people  seated time back restaurant  Room felt isolated warm  AC eventually turned but approved first manager which thought unnecessary  waitress Melissa came table right away take drink orders  She great personality but needs work service techniques  She rarely came check especially when food taking long time come between courses  She completely forgot 1 order which person delivered apologized but she didn't  far food empanaditas 6 pieces $18 worth it barely anything it  large guacamole $18 shared sparingly  can't speak everyone party but when asked weren't enthusiastic I'd hoped    Despite shortcomings waitress still $75 00 tip off $266 00 tab  hope she generous people did most work  Again great personality but service mediocre  <EOR> Not great  Customer service weird  having conversations right next table    annoying just because unprofessional but also because stopped watch football game  distracting  <EOR> Excellent food  Great service  hostess server busser welcoming!
