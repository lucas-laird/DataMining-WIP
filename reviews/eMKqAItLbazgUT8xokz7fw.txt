Chef's omelet awesome! much food take some home  Friendly staff efficient service  <EOR> Never gotten more such unassuming restaurant  looking Yelp new spot check randomly picked Wine 5 Cafe mostly due its close proximity house   Pulling into parking lot didn't expect much  Nothing spectacular visually outside   I ordered salmon upon suggestion server wife blackened chicken breast  dishes first became visible window yo delivered table knew pleasant surprise   Every aspect food incredible  Presentation?

Incredible    I can't say enough great place is  Highly highly highly recommended don't impress easily  <EOR> Great place  Wonderful food presentation  Great friendly staff!

No matter place could cave I'd still go  food fantastic service great   We The Salad which really salad  huge delicious would happily order meal  also chicken curry Lake Victoria  server warned several times lot food indeed was  stuffed ourselves silly still plenty least more meal  food equally delicious leftovers   If you're looking off vegas strip find some great food look no further  awesome meal highly recommend it  <EOR> In quest obscure off the strip locations along comes recommendation former colleague try no name place name Wine 5 Café  He described Kenyan American fusion restaurant claimed amazing burger 'transcendent' chili fries  bit far where rounds days but recent commitment brought towards north west part town finally made visit  good he claimed?  Wine 5 located crummy strip mall best looking parking lot but don't let exterior fool almost did us restaurant clean quaintly decorated  number 4 top tables middle few booths side decorated they're someone's front porch  rest walls around restaurant look front facades small houses well almost mini version some themed casino you'd find strip but more tolerable  menu some great sounding items looks bit heavy breakfast items but seems lots good choices  come back try some Kenyan influenced dishes day try 'flat burgers'   And flat wasn't Jetpack burger came thing absolutely huge  Topped avocado grilled sweet onions spicy butter pickles lettuce tomato thing stacked top knife presented with  bun crispy flakey outside yet soft gooey inside  meat good flavor although maybe best quality ever wasn't best beef flavor but more your standard pre made patty  onions amazing sweet flavor star burger  pickles more flavored cucumbers but totally delicious something need emulate home  avocado disappeared burger but good touch when came across few bites  tomato slightly grilled but still hard fresh seemed almost uncooked despite grill marks but quite good  burger all anticipating based location menu description but ended being fantastic surprise   The fries came very late believe forgotten first but extremely good well  thicker steak fries coated combo celery salt other seasonings  most steak fries majority crunchy cooked well few soggy ones mixed in  side fries definitely enough two served very large bowl   My girlfriend Exception which red wine spiced braised burger cheddar cheese grilled tomato slices onions lettuce  very similar flavoring mine additional treatment patty made some nice complexity flavor but felt missing excellent pickles  Even though bit way can't wait back try few more selections very curious see smoked bacon  burgers range $7 95 8 95 fries $2 95 heaping serving all very worth it  didn't try chili fries during visit but back soon try those well  <EOR> I dont usually give 5 stars anything but place deserves it  drunken frito misto hope spelled right platter amazing appetizer  its says serves 2 but could easily serve 3  but just everything else portions HUGE   salmon ruben entree great  thought salmon rueben would odd but wasnt all  sandwich tasty remoulade cooked cabbage wasn't usual sour kraut alot restaurants put ruebens  salmon cooked perfect juicy rye bread buttery crispy delicious  Overall decore cute thoughtful even place relatively small place feels big open giant glass windows see right into kitchen service professional all servers wear ties white dress shirts italian bistro style friendly never felt abandoned food portions gigantic everything seems made scratch very fresh tasting  guess bottom line wont leave disappointed hungry thats sure  <EOR> FYI prices listed menu linked profile lower menu restaurant  burgers average  50 higher  hickory loaded example really 9 79  Otherwise great food  <EOR> I love place much!

The burger   Although brother's good give rating based food mainly burger needed help   think probably consistency thing however major problem   Once while food perfect   What would place 5 stare?  I'd hard time making 5 star joint which nothing its food but its marketing   think 5 star joint top its particular field   Wine 5 actually sits between two types upscale diner breakfast place   Since top former can't give full 5   But  just play ratings game     Bottom line Great menu fresh variety something everyone   definitely back see if give fourth star    <EOR> This place amazing! little hesitant try but yummy  definitely come back bring rest family    Everything tastes fresh homemade  seasoning perfect over powering gives amazing flavor  presentation very detailed plate look extra yummy   The staff really sweet chef very talented  waiter great very attentive  decor fabulous much look gives home feeling  would recommend little cute cafe anyone!

I feel maybe ordered wrong things   huge curry fan but curry wasn't good maybe fault ordering burger when curry didn't work but also think restaurant shouldn't just put bad frozen food menu attempt appeal more customers     I think prices other dishes reasonable however almost $10 bad burger no sides considering took almost hour both curry then burger replacement restaurant busy just say stay away  <EOR> Excellent flavorful creative cuisine  Imaginative colorful presentations  Great knowledgeable staff very tentative  well regular customer   <EOR> This place hidden gem Las Vegas  eating over three years since movinig LV  grandfather head chef elite restaurant am mostly disappointed food sunny city spoiled properly prepared cooked meals  food Wine Five Outstanding! opinion if place lacated resorts would pay 3 times price still feel great deal  portions large perfect unless buffet sort eater require three plates full  If rush dont care quality your meal dont come take time right  For anniversary dinner wanted lobster good lobster spoke owner told wanted 2 LARGE lobster dinners  requested 12 15 oz tails prefer them fresh hey dont want much right? oh yeah cook said lobster properly? he took reservation didnt even ask deposit  showed dinner directed table already set waiting even burning candles BTW early  within 30 min comes dinner served chef personally  4 countem 4 large Lobster tails beautifly prepared cooked perfection  chef explained he could find large tails requested  he two each which small probably 9 ouncers  Best Lobster Ive years!
