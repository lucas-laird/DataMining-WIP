Unfortunately appetizers came same time meal didn't finish potato twister which bunch potato chips fried together clump  potato version monkey bread quite amusing eat  fry sauce nice just enough heat sweetness  burger 1 2 pounds if light eater better order two people  price tag 15 95 worth money because meat itself juicier tastes very good  tell meat prime   Here's sad part  the perfect burger comes lot toppings if eat burger flavor meat order this  guyere cheese good applewood smoked bacon cooked perfect onion relish slightly sweet smoky  overpowered everything meat offer when eat dry aged prime beef patty don't want extras drown taste meat itself  Although good burger much tastebuds meat lost relish cheese  ended pulling patty eating itself enjoy dry aged goodness   We also ordered chicken fingers refried  know most people cannot tell but refrying dried strips took good part its coating  and still served us   We took doggie bag look nice but threw immediately outside restaurant  wasn't worth 60 dollar price tag lunch   Fair food good tasting patty but fixings house sauce murders beef  and beef reason why pay 15 dollars burger   If type love meat don't eat anything but plain patty inbetween egg bun  If those neat toppings place you  hate say but lover red meat place made sad  feel don't know just great prime beef patties feel don't appreciate customers because decor says
