Well bottom crust no crispier better cooked elsewhere  wasn't even thin enough create cracker thin crust  proper coal fire pizza place joke compared real thing    The sauce water down flavor less tomato sauce    The cheese put while slices mozzarella thin doesn't melt nor does spread out  just wavers cheese don't give pizza any flavor   The toppings next joke  mushrooms good size not thin sliced version but sausage frozen ball sausage every other pizza joint uses  Nothing special nothing unique  same frozen sausage balls    In end don't recommend place  am dead honest Sam's Club Costco thing better pizza sell half price! HALF PRICE! place almost joke list everything but certainly isn't bad  didn't sick didn't walk unhappy but surely would pissed if paid $20 pizza  birthday deal worth trying place though  <EOR> One favorite pizza places ever! Every single time eat always end having stomach pains just because much eat since good  Every time come back Vegas come Grimaldi's  almost purposely stay Venetian Encore just  easy access Grimaldi's pizza  <EOR> Ordered small artichoke sausage pizza take out based Yelp reviews below  Ordering very fast said would take 15 minutes the place very busy   Came back 15 pick ready yet  OK no problem paid waited another 5 minutes  When pizza came surprisingly little cold  guess sitting back 5 10 minutes before sent up  good  crust little bland but toppings decent  If only served hot    <EOR> The pizza super duper delicious  service super duper horrible  Took forever food  Took forever drinks  Took forever bread      and when finally came because ask host bring some because apparently server bartender forgot  then he brings bread  Just bread  No butter  No knife  Just dry plate bread  Gee     Thanks?

Delicious pepperoni sausage    However extremely inattentive service  Water left unrefilled sees waiter request bill    A frustrating experience  <EOR> Wow! probably best pizza ever am big pizza fan all bit skeptical going first but then read some great reviews yelp decided give try  am certainly glad did! husband ordered small house salad  just ok simple but very fresh  Small white pizza it large thought should just gotten personal size pizza split Italian sausage mushrooms fresh tomatoes  right front you  pizza came very thin crust fresh mozzarella cheese use amazing probably made whole pizza taste good did  We also ordered some white house wine $4 glass $9 half carafe which actually pretty big would say cheapest alcohol find Vegas  Service very good would definitely recommend anyone  whole dinner cost $37  Super cheap Vegas super good! <EOR> Early October 2016 0 stars service  Ugh  service bad just left   right stepped before could even some possibly ? delicious pizza   The restaurant busier ever seen  took long while server acknowledge she running mad  Meanwhile tables arrived starting receive drinks salads etc  Each brief frenzied contact server gave impression inconveniencing her  Last straw? finally ready place pizza order she literally turned another table  literally left    No one's pizza *that* good  <EOR> The best pizza earth  Athena amazing manager whose friendly personality helpful recommendations made all difference vacation  location every time Vegas never disappoint  <EOR> While Palazzo see Panda! decided try Grimaldi's  live right around corner Eastern love location figured it'd safe bet different location   I think most surprising visit prices menu identical Eastern! Wow!No Mark being strip??  refreshing change!  As usual food excellent! ordered large pie grilled chicken italian sausage pepperoni  YUM! just good location Eastern!   I think biggest difference noticed between Eastern location spot service  Don't wrong service Eastern great   but service exemplary! Just good gets! believe servers name JP he great!

So seems foregone conclusion but give it    5 stars! back! <EOR> When order personal pizza two people share! huge haha  ordered brooklyn bridge believe  name topped ricotta cheese Italian sausage peppers  don't eat pizza often but liked because felt crossbreed between pizza lasagna  waiter served table very pleasant! <EOR> Not impressed    don't infatuation    Service ok pizza kinda tasted card board wasn't enough cheese pizza  wouldn't come back    Onto find favorite pizza place Vegas! <EOR> Yes!

We ordered Small pizza pepperoni fresh garlic fresh basil leaves   and them devoured it  crust crispy delicious toppings fresh   You order toppings different each quarter if really wanted try lots toppings   but charge regular price even if getting whole pizza FYI   We also ordered small house salad which really yummy vinegarette  dressing   Our waitress super nice  think name Amy   Angie   ?

Ps a little Tabasco sauce never hurts! <EOR> I lover Grimaldi's since lived New York love Vegas just much  Admittedly dough isn't good Nyc Brooklyn due water probably but overall flavor same  give tons topping offer more upscale ambiance super low key vibe New York locations    Their desserts also amazing if still stomach afterwards  highly recommend New York Cheesecake  would your day sure  <EOR> I would say 99% guaranteed best pizza strip  If deep dish Chicago style pizza lot cheese then spot you! But should some time before because if order large pizza going take least hour  Yes least hour cook your food probably without saying depending amount people there  But if some time you're willing some dinner drink stuff spot whether local just visiting <EOR> Some might say pizza best gift Italy    according me   Grimalid's some good pizza   love pizza restaurants let customize your flavors toppings grimaldi's does right   i am meat eater course added meatballs   jalapenos good if love spice kick     next time more adventurous try other sauce bases crazy!  house wine good price tastes delicious <EOR> The spinach salad really good flavor crisp bacon  Very tasty gluten free crust  Sauce cheese perfectly portioned  Sad didn't pineapple topping but dining partner told  gross anyway  LOL  really good would totally eat again!!! <EOR> I'm going say say proudly    Grimaldi's pizza best pizza ever till now    ruined other pizza me   Staying Palazzo noticed advertisement billboard elevator lobby didn't think much until family over hotel visiting instead eating decided order eat Bella Suite   no idea pizzeria looks really don't care because taste alone cooked cookie sheet lighter long tasted good   couldn't place kind cheese used but think manchego cheese along pepperoni oh spice spices just made best slice pizza ever had      I can't wait return Vegas just pizza time eat pizzeria  <EOR> We Grimaldi's Pizzeria Tucson much larger then ours   nice sit sitting close another table   great pizza plenty left overs great service  <EOR> Excellent pizza salads! whim pleasantly surprised  little way depending where you're staying but worth trip    A great place enjoy meal friends  large pizza should reasonably feed 3 4 people  Stays open til 2am? AWESOME <EOR> So review going stand out ahem     okay carrying on    We Grimaldi's first night Vegas last weekend mostly because only thing open time into Vegas   I'll first admit pizza joint no place someone gluten allergy  being said am surprised many places provide gluten free pizza   but don't expect it  try avoid being pain know servers generally call ahead just avoid places but night no choice expected graze salad bar    Now skinny inform server gluten intolerant ask if salad dressings gluten free  He simply responded don't gluten free menu  acknowledge asked again if he could just kitchen check back salad dressings ensure don't gluten I'd happy salad choices  He just repeated himself didn't gluten free menu asked take orders other people table  offended but same time feel bad allergy just decided wouldn't eat anything night    Had friend hostess asked please sure balsamic gluten free I'd eaten  able ordered Mediterranean salad no dressing boyfriend shared oil balsamic  only compliment salad good portion but both agreed pretty bad otherwise  Ingredients didn't seem fresh just run mill salad 15 bucks  boyfriend some pizza friends ordered wasn't enticed it   Our friends did seem enjoy pizza say beers pretty cheap boyfriend enjoyed few them help through salad So seems everyone loves place but unfortunately experience both service food very very Meh  <EOR> Highly rated location friends decided give place try  First off horrible service  Very inattentive very slow very lazy  around 3 P M  wasn't busy all which wonder why weren't receiving any service  fact pretty overstaffed it server per table yet received no service  No worries thought food definitely worth since much positive feedback! NOT! Disappointed again  First off its thin crust pizza which means really shouldn't take very long  Took over 40 minutes  made wonder would able handle if place packed  Maybe just never packed      Pizza sub par  Cheese rubbery five minutes  crust burnt many areas  enjoy little burn since stone oven but excessive  sausage good though but point good tasting ingredient if pizza whole tasted garbage  recommend location all returning any time soon  <EOR> 5 5 price 5 5 quality freshness ingredients 5 5 amazing service   I 3 Grimaldi locations feel best 3  Located inside palazzo NOT GRAND CANAL SHOPPES easily missed  lot smaller other locations but service lot better   We party 4 celebrating birthday  friend FREE large pizza birthday  added meatballs pepperoni ricotta cheese  meatballs soft perfectly seasoned dry either  pepperoni isn't other pizza places lot smaller don't really think good  don't skimp ricotta cheese either  pizzas aren't oily    all  Each topping additional $4  feel toppings limited but very fresh  don't any pineapple case you're wondering  crust super thin but large definitely feed 3 4 people if order sides!! think large pizza $19   We also ordered large antipasto $9 which came bell peppers mozzarella cheese salami olives  given slices bread olive oil balsamic vinegar enjoy antipasto  also ordered large house salad $9 which came romaine lettuce mushrooms olives red onions sure if remember seeing tomatoes not  light refreshing dressing    The 4 full eat dessert would say careful when order large pizza because very large  Also half pizza toppings other half different toppings but still pay entire price toppings if sense   Our server sweet she explained menu current specials continually checked us  waters always refilled  Food came good amount time    Lovely decor dim lighting if sit window good view  Perfect date nights  <EOR> I think am bigger fan regular pizza compared white pizza garlic       nice casual atmosphere attentive service     also very good Mediterranean salad!    rather limited menu  <EOR> Hearing New York transplant Vegas friend urged try Grimaldi's  Upon arriving Vegas first place hit less hour opened    The hostess quick meet sat outside main shopping area  hesitant first because didn't want feel being zoo animal exhibit    My friend ordered classic Margherita pizza while ordered plain pesto pizza   Knowing freshly pizzas waited patiently more thrilled pizzas arrived  Shortly food holiday special performance Santa dancing elves  attracted lot attention throughout mall hence made feel zoo animal feared I'd become   People would walk pointing eating  add brownie points? Close end holiday performance 'fake snow' started falling ceiling shopping center complimentary topping soap suds pizza   This reason review 3 stars 4 5  felt experience really ruined result special performance eating outside shopping area   TIPS 1  Don't eat weekends December  2  Eat inside if don't sit shopping area  3  Order pesto yummy   Overall pizza tasty  love NY style pizza [I actually love all forms pizza don't discriminate]  Grimaldi's knows impress pies bad locale impressive   Staff friendly moderately attentive water  Just when thought server forgot he would show up  sure I'd come back since Vegas full great places feast but definitely won't pass if Grimaldi's came culinary consideration conversation  <EOR> Love pizza!

Girmaldi's sit down restaurant plenty seating towards back restaurant see them making your pizza  waitor friendly  Prices reasonable offer traditional pizza special sauce regular red sauce white garlic pesto  variety toppings select $2 4 each   dough nice chewy but pizza itself bland  ordered large half red half white pepperoni chicken artichoke olives  salads good large portions would definitely recommend splitting  Probably won't seeing again Grimaldi's  <EOR> Great service relaxing atmosphere delicious pizza  thin crust tasty   server Tushumbe awesome   Great personality attentive   Drinks perfect  dined Sunday night which good choice crowded  <EOR> Oh love thin crust pizza  Place good kid friendly pretty big! house salad along your pizza  Nom nom!

Shocking! they're probably thinking closing duties but still   bar area where order wait maybe seats 7 people' shouldn't hard some more water order another beer   The other thing really prevents going another star pricing   just seems absurd pay anywhere $2 $4 toppings top small pizza already being $14   Some pricing also just seems weird sausage $2 but jalapenos $4? jalapeno most $1 00 store if organic! ?

ordered small pizza meatballs amount food perfect two us  Cheesecake must if room dessert <EOR> I first drawn original Grimaldi's Brooklyn few years ago since then returning number franchises both Nevada Florida  Known coal fired brick ovens pizzas great but nothing first time stepped into Brooklyn storefront  Maybe New York water being cooked original over 100 year old brick oven but just better    Grimaldi's since then franchised sure if even own location Brooklyn anymore  pizza recipe flavor probably diluted bit but love familiar chewy crust  ingredients fresh definitely compares any $15 fancy pizza may find hipster metropolitan restaurant  Although love classic margherita white sauce garlic also nice option  <EOR> The food excellent here  tried BBQ chicken pizza cilantro red onions grilled chicken BBQ sauce Don Jon full meats pepperoni sausage kale salad lemon based vinaigrette    Cocktails delicious well Limoncello Long Island Strawberry Basil Martinis    The service okay  high standards because used own two restaurants  if come across great service am great tipper  However service wasn't bad wasn't great  average he going through motions but didn't really care answers  feel insincerity  ask slices lemons three times before somebody other server brought them out  baby asked additional napkins  asked three times before he finally brought them out  He seemed annoyed requests  weren't difficult ones just standard ones  didn't all  He did check ask everything but didn't seem stay long enough really hear answers  said no sincerity   Hence three stars  Good food but when dine sit down restaurant service equally part restaurant well take into consideration when write reviews  <EOR> I CAN'T PLACE   our server BAD  regular bad BAD   he brought wrong pizzas TWICE screwed bill TWICE super slow still even correcting didn't pizza wanted ended just being ok fine fine    the manager came over said she gonna take money off bill    she refunded $2 00 but then didn't even sense b c charged toppings did get     skip nightmare  <EOR> I'm profoundly baffled all good reviews Grimaldis   The pizza isn't bad okay edible   but just barely   The real problem boring    All elements just don't harmonize    The crust overcooked  hard crispy no chewiness  suggest Grimaldi clan Settebello Green Valley tast real Neapolitan pizza   Crust should chewy hard dammit! Take trip Napoli birthplace pizza if don't believe me   The toppings synch any other toppings  if chosen own no awareness would ultimately work together   And please!  This coal fired nonsense New York water nonsense doesn''t mean anything except marketing ploy gullible tourists think they're eating something special    If want great pizza down street Sicili's Pizza Twain  ghetto area don't advise eating but take out delivery amazingly good  half price!!!  But if you're lazy tourist doesn't want leave casino then you're stuck mediocre pizza   If represents New York pizza given fame Grimaldi's New York never happier live overcrowded smelly cesspool  <EOR> Superb pizza great passion fruit ice tea  Good price too! loved pesto red sauce basil tomato mozzarella pizza had  Great cannoli desert well awesome cappuccino  again! <EOR> Pizza great service sucks bad  Server only showed face time rest time asking busser everything else  Other waitresses don't smile hostess frowning place sucks  place should called suicide Pizza   only thing alive pizza! <EOR> Best Pizza ever had   am thin crust person Grimaldi's perfect   Salad excellent well  <EOR> The best pizza ever life  exaggeration  last year Vegas back few weeks ago just see if memory correct  indeed   My friend shopping next day came upon another Grimaldi's big mall nearby  yet again   Yup 2 days row  location wasn't quite good Palazzo but still great  location however stellar quality   I can't disagree someone taste since subjective but people say they've better pizza   for love god tell where is  No words just go  Oh don't all fancy  Just pepperoni  Keep nice pure  <EOR> Stopped late show    20 00 each 3 small pizzas toppings 2 soda's beer glass wine!  crowded all    line original around block Brooklyn wait but just good     4 00 glass wine??

Sounds familiar  lots different well known restaurants all over setting shop Vegas  trendy thing now  But anyways having eaten OG Grimaldis New York didn't high expectations would nearly good  semi busy dinner just large pie go  don't offer any normal combos pepperoni meat lovers veggie  all customizable pizzas al la carte choosing size whatever toppings want  4 large only 2 bucks more medium  10 huge slices think perfect group 5  regular pizza tomato sauce mozzarella cheese included mushrooms sausage pepperoni extra   said 15 20 minutes but believe waited more half hour  Lame could've walked around more versus waiting front  But pizza hot delicious  cheese tasted fresh super gooey each slice lots each toppings  Again good remember NY but hit spot wasn't super pricey pretty much spot paid east coast  <EOR> As far pizza deals some best ever seen   good friends two days row   serve New York style pizzas think large which should fill 2 people very comfortably if 3 cost $16   Most veggie toppings $2 extra some $4     We large pizza mushrooms onions 2 half slices   pretty full but would've eaten more just because tasted good   sauce amazing tangy slightly sweet crust crunchy could taste toppings   Vegas several 6 times past year half best food deals come across   won't disappointed  <EOR> I've wanted try Grimaldi's every time NYC but never made trek down Brooklyn  sure compares original but certainly best pizza places now Las Vegas  best cheapest pizzas ever eaten but probably better pizzas eaten Vegas even sober because yes even cardboard oily pizza tastes great 4 am when you're drunk   expensive side probably 50 70% more expensive should really paying pizza but  usually Vegas   I sad Pizza Spot @ Wynn closed but way better less greasy better selection toppings  also eaten Secret Pizza spot at Cosmo which also good especially if only want single slice but definitely greasier limited toppings   This tucked away upstairs Palazzo wasn't crowded all when came Sunday evening 6 pm  hard time deciding order many combinations toppings pick around 20 pepperoni italian sausage mushrooms extra basil 3 different sauces traditional tomato sauce white garlic sauce pesto  asked server popular good he very helpful telling he disliked garlic decide own    The way price pizza toppings odd  personal pizza 12 inches $9 base just dough tomato cheese small pizza 16 inches $14 large 18 inches $16  don't know why don't medium size why didn't just small medium large probably people dining solo didn't feel awkward ordering entire small pizza just themselves  If want white garlic add $1 $2 depending size pizza  price toppings odd $2 mushrooms garlic olives spinach ham extra cheese extra basil italian sausage meatballs $4 sausage sun dried tomatoes   don't know why extra basil same price italian sausage why garlic jalapeños $2 each why sun dried tomatoes $4  Just close your eyes order know your bill like everything else Vegas expensive   I italian sausage mushroom personal pizza  could done just half pizza but ended eating all I figured already done number body Vegas why just continue bad decisions   crust delicious thin burnt  tomato sauce right amount overly cheesy the cheese also seemed fresh high quality nor did skimp toppings  All all once started eating couldn't stop delicious   It wasn't fastest pizza time ordered when pizza probably 30 min so  expensive side $17 small pizza but outrageously priced Vegas better pizzas Vegas  definitely back next time stay Wynn Encore need some carbs soak alcohol fairly inexpensive casual meal  Come least 2 people don't eat entire pizza yourself   You also order pizza pick which nice option if hungover leave your room nice friend come pick you  <EOR> Great service tonight  Cesar salad pizza tonight!  taste sauce meat liked made taste buds water!
