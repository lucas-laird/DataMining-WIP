I use restroom horrified  Each stall only seat covers tissue trash cans over flowing top cans tissue human waste it  no soap paper towels  person use restroom employee someone handles food sell  only imagine bacteria leaving hands food  never shop again  <EOR> Horrible servicio por parte del personal en la seccion de comida y por el joven que atiende despachando la carne lamentablemente para ser mi primera vez en la tienda pesima impresion  <EOR> El Super gigantic puts many other ethnic markets city shame terms pure size variety  There's adequate produce section large butcher seafood counter cheese ready made foods section bakery plenty pan dulce small dine in restaurant ceviches tacos burritos tortas   There isn't really any area done very well kind jack all trades master none situation but pricing typically very good most items particularly meats seafood  weekly sales but sure where circular sent out live nearby but receive one  available door prices appear yellow indicate temporary   Store still new but very clean organized  Some basic knowledge Spanish helpful all items English translation next them which little confusing deli produce areas  <EOR> I don't shop any Mexicans stores only El Super when living LA only would shop at  Veggies meat Cheap prices <EOR> For a Mexican centric market great  produce always clean organized  Regularly great sales meats my favorite part grocery store   Try marinated boneless chicken thigh take home grill up  Also pastor meat  really good  tell regularly taco nights house? cheese deli section couple scoops Mexican less salty Central American saltier cream your American style tacos nachos way more flavor American sour cream  Fresh well priced produce  Sometimes long checkout lines Good hot food restaurant section too  often grab agua fresca drink while shop  Combo plates good really chili cheese tamale  <EOR> Cardenas light! Less crowds easier parking definite plusses but produce section smaller feel market much more Food Less style warehousey   Also construction Decatur hard pain ass   Their prices right line Cardenas  6 $1 pepinos same 2 $1 avocados El Super's larger!   Meat counter lot choices even cachete which probably closest thing find cabeza without having actually roast entire head   Still most likely fighting lines Cardenas rather traffic come here  <EOR> To fair pre made food sell grocery store but apart that   this place pits!   Aside fact prices completely unreasonable when come anything  other fruits veggies but customer service utter garbage!
