Disappointed  <EOR> Extremely disappointed service food overall experience  seated right away since today Sunday wasn't busy but down hill   Can't believe lunch bill $70 00 small lobster roll bread extremely dried arancini appetizer 4 meatball Sizes two margaritas  Took forever waiter order once done bill  Not planning going back during stay Tropicana  Don't waste your money order room service another restaurant  <EOR> Had burger fries cheese sauce  nice atmosphere service fast friendly  burger tasted good  huge menu selection  <EOR> When you've become famous skewering failing restaurateurs really should careful license your name to  place interesting menu but 1 pm doesn't seem should bread advertises its sandwiches  made mistake ordering poor substitute meal suffered  Given lack business weekend dined suspect poor supply management isn't only problem  Perhaps we'll see Robert fix own restaurant future shows? <EOR> we locals decided try food great food service post unless loved hated something  Wendy server exceptional made drive strip worth it  thank Wendy great service <EOR> Terrible would recommend anyone   seems clear Robert Irvine never restaurant inspect poor quality food   fish chips oily almost inedible   Shepard pie would any Englishman frown  wings full gristle fat rubbery texture   Overall food disappointing especially because fan show really looking forward trying it   price Vegas expensive horrible food  <EOR> Unbelievable experience both staff food  First price very reasonable food delicious  staff always if need but intrusive  If best dining experience Vegas top <EOR> I try main burger there   twice   First time world landed top 5 burger list   bread put over top perfect toasted texture flavor   beef delicious   second time good but just good   roasting bread enough flavor did come through   take off top 5 but give another try next round Vegas   Also tried lamb shepherds pie another meal very good slightly salty but line expected restaurant this  <EOR> Didn't even try food sat down never approached bartender barback brought menus bartender never came left    don't understand why two bar backs bartender  15 people bar <EOR> My husband excited try Public House made reservations Saturday night  arrived 15 minutes early told overbooked short seaters would wait while  party 70 40 third 24  optimistic  But seated only little late  When ordered drinks server said bar backed we'd really appreciate drinks once finally them but wasn't long wait either  appetizer French onion fondue pretty good but bland  food came fairly quickly which unexpected but just ok  ordered fish chips  piece fish huge but wasn't served any type sauce dry  chips course fries but mustard various other things them which menu description would ordered them  made them unappetizing  am sure many people would them  Hubby F K burger ordered medium med rare  He said ok  least he regular fries  Bottom line wasn't bad wasn't good average  hoping more Vegas many good great choices average won't cut least us  <EOR> I thought great idea first yelp review favorite celebrity chefs fan since he led blue team season two worst cooks America  But

Very good dishes but seemed culinary ceiling cooking staff  mean understood walking into place specially gastropub food ordered simple classics fish chips but shock most haphazard rendition dish ever

nothing excelled shoe string fries dry cod oddly tangy malted aioli  But best redeeming factor place other nice bartenders pub aspect gastro sadly lacking  tried founders selection wife really enjoyed raspberry rubaues draft  But much she enjoyed drink managerial staff seemed love there's even more  mean each its own  But bald manager Marcus seemed take away ambiance he seemed enjoy few many pestering guest guest bar  nice see Irvine himself but unlike other celebrity chef properties presence didn't really outshine lower quality food  Well if your Vegas want try some beer enjoy watching

And witness French Onion Fondue? just need bring LOAF Ciabatta bread table because fondue itself damn good finish off spoon once bread slices gone   trust believe!  Where Bear fish chips main course and taste told order next visit stuck Shepherd's Pie   lovely enough but little dry side because missing gravy comes mixing roux natural juices meat case ground lamb   mean mashed potato crust does provide texture moisture know skirts extra calories   But having gravy only   'BEEF' dish  Sorry    The 'Banoffee Pie' something I'd never heard before go to dessert  Light fruity just hint toffee within espresso ice cream finally sends into Sugar Nirvana instead Sugar Overload    Our wait person Raimonda sp? funny knowledgeable kept drinks recommendations coming   not mention she walked made sure card before left   Now customer service!    We don't frequent Strip much but we'll definitely requesting seating section next time we're back down there   Overall Chef Irvine shoots SCORES new digs! should go   like yesterday  <EOR> I've few times  Fondue absolutely spectacular! Otherwise everything else good but rock your world good  would given 4 stars because service great location great offers something above beyond normal mediocre offerings Tropicana   However  dinged them star due pizza  last visit November ordered cheese pizza go  says arugula rocket which favorite flavor pizza  But didn't say never presumed they'd bake pizza arugula it!!! NEVER that! Please! basically alters  flavor profile arugula beautifully bitter murky dirty bitter  texture baked arugula seaweed  love bitter flavors but disaster  If indeed supposed wow  should added baking  <EOR> Fondue Burger? Don't mind if do    Everything somewhat limited menu looks great  fondue burger because could not  GF fish chips  battered better Gordon Ramsey's  Next time poutine apple pie jar  <EOR> Service leaves lot desired  suppose expectations higher due Robert's name door  Very disappointed  sat bar request drink refills every time  unacceptable  <EOR> Brand new inside Tropicana Hotel Casino lay wonderful eating experience  kept simple Heirloom Gazpacho Spring Greens Salad  Simple yet very good  Gazpacho bold vibrant but add pineapple sorbet becomes delicate balance flavors surprised me  salad? I'd never heard watermelon radishes peppery flavor would expect but also unexpected  really enjoyed whole experience recommend wonderful restaurant staff even better  must try when Las Vegas! <EOR> Tried new restaurant first time tonight  liked lot  Delicious menu options choose friendly staff  tried Watermelon Cooler cocktail which delicious I 2 steak frites which huge portion skirt steak  chimichurri sauce awesome!  husband fondue burger which unique totally delicious  fried bacon it  Fried bacon!!  dessert dad presented apple pie mason jar  am gluten free while menu accommodated affogato  would definitely come back  <EOR> This spot catch nice lunch when you're area  food  impeccable!  time walk door you're greeted very friendly hostess  atmosphere awesome staff managers come over ask where you're very welcoming manner!

Instead waiting since show catch offered free dessert   would chicken sandwich ordered    Shoestring fries served sandwich obviously frozen product barely warm no seasoning  Robert Irvine would taste show say garbage throw fries  Complete failure    Margarita pizza   Arrives warm edges but cold center bottom  Obviously another frozen product  eating frozen supermarket pizza    Salad roasted vegetables pile mush  dont even know sent kitchen    BLT wasnt bad but wasnt good either  Think BLT yourself home  Nothing special just OK    Overall place mess  Waiter nice but no clue deal customer receives poor quality food   hope Robert Irvines reputation doesnt take hit because place  really place he fix Restaurant Impossible     If want good meal avoid it  <EOR> Bartender server very good  Bartender very informative when looking special beer  highly recommend 805 if you're strong beer lager beer drinker  F K Burger fondue which really good messy eat but if you're going cut you're good go  lump crab pancetta appetizer very good filled crab meat but little small price  atmosphere clean bright made feel could relax take your time ate  <EOR> Great food service wendy  looking forward restaurant opening  grilled chicken sandwich awesome beer  No rescue required here! <EOR> Such amazing experience!

Food delicious!  Excellent service   space casual modern inviting   back! <EOR> I say very impressed experience here! Tropicana many times always appreciated older culture Las Vegas carried  However known lately needed modernized there  Walking into restaurant Robert Irvine's Public House made feel right away  Everyone very friendly everything tasted delicious whether bar kitchen really enjoyed myself here  staff works hard trying customer feel home    wonderful place enjoy great drinks great food great view! <EOR> Lovely atmosphere  Could see strip table window  Wish could remember name red ale  Very good  braized lamb shank  Falls off bone  good  partner crime shepherds pie  took little taste  Very yummy pretty piped stars mashed potatoes covering dish  Stuffed ourselves  Would definitely back  Lots waiters service quick friendly  <EOR> Disappionting   very excited eat there   food nothing special   $24 Burger over cooked kale salad extremely crisp kale dressing few things thrown appear better   No brandy bar coke flat when mentioned nothing done correct it   4 more days Tropicana wont back  <EOR> Myself another couple enjoyed 3 entrees salmon shepards pie lamb shank  I'd just say Robert Irvine lives reputation chef dish seem took 24 hours prepare while constrained time takes deliver food quickly hungry patrons  salmon glaze left wondering could such flavorful carmelization complement well fresh caught flavor fish? shepards pie made ground lamb remarkably did leave greasy taste  word I'd use every mouthful sumptuous  then lamb shank  did Robert Irvine devise recipe would explode your mouth such flavor yet overpowered sweetness? If rich mesquite wood smoke bbq meat try lamb shank  amazing! <EOR> The food good great but impressed service    The french onion fondue more cream sauce dip bread instead cheesy fondue  duck confit good especially sriracha butter sauce  salmon good but overcooked liking  If medium sure ask it  pizza actually best thing had  all made scratch   The duck confit actually came under cooked first time  server Fred took care us  He took off bill ordered new dish me  Chef Shawn brought table apologized last dish even offered dining partner something she won't just watch eat since she already finished dish  am truly impressed genuinely concerned mistake made it  felt taken care  really all ask customer  <EOR> Disappointed followed signs open late night  Open late night all signs say  Apparently means 11pm Saturday    <EOR> Ok locals decided try Robert Irvine's public house lunch  glad did! waitress Stephanie delightful  personnel friendly  food fantastic! order much but we'll good snacks later  Roberto bus person great too  Both need raise! ROBERT? listening!!! <EOR> Underwhelmed      Went grab late lunch 3 pm but told hours changed only served limited menu  seating tables  Only bar  Even though perfectly good table right front only TV playing game wanted watch relegated small high tops which far away really watch game  place advertises its football specials place watch game you'd think they'd maximize access TVs!  TVs lined over bar making hard really watch any game unless sitting around bar    Anyways limited menu  number appetizers available but only entrees pizzas    The mushroom pizza goat cheese arugula sounded fantastic description  However easily most disappointing   its base cheese pizza red sauce base mozzarella honest  pretty much tasted like  couldn't even taste mushrooms all  crust nicely done outside but thin soggy middle really hold ingredients  Now love good crust  However even while edible outer crust well cooked lacking flavor     salt? featured ingredients more afterthought sparsely sprinkled top few under seasoned mushrooms few blobs carmelized onion bit goat cheese  topped reasonable mound arugula  arugula fresh but could fooled truffle vinaigrette no aroma taste truffles  Why even mention truffle vinaigrette? Overall wouldn't known even mushroom pizza if hadn't pushed aside arugula double check    The pepperoni pizza marginally better only because sparse bits pepperoni actually added bit salt otherwise bland pizza  boyfriend ask brown spiral over pizza was      pesto apparently baked along pizza  opinion pesto best fresh minimal heating  would better effect if drizzled post baking    The only thing truly good hamachi poke which tasted fresh well seasoned green onions sesame oil guessing miso paste  unfortunately served six seven small fragments taro chips nearly enough  server relatively absent hungry never chance ask more    The service basic no frills pretty standard bar suppose  guess expected little better standard though  <EOR> This review solely based off fact could eat here  husband arrived restaurant hour fifteen minutes before closed hostess informed no longer serving food  very disappointing  never gone establishment stop serving food longer hour before closing time  <EOR> Staying Tropicana excited eat dinner Robert Irvine's restaurant  extremely disappointed dinner partners  steak Guinness Shepard's pie bland watery  expensive portion size  others Shepard's pie lamb potatoes definitely instant potatoes texture wise  Save your money    place worth price  All could think Robert needs visit own restaurant   needs help bad! <EOR> Hmmm ever could colder glass  chicken burger way over top spicy basically tasteless first few bites  Service attentive kept having someone's attention despite them walking even looking customers  Too many options return  <EOR> Brand new shiny! Great food great venue! Semi private area awesome view overlooking Tropicana MGM  Very spacious nice atmosphere awesome modern decor full bar lots TV's sports news  Variety different foods menu most popular known highlighted  12pm Monday wasn't very busy all  Service great  parked free outside parking lot right entrance off Tropicana walk escalators entrance restaurant left   Their chicken wings bomb! Buffalo flavor cooked perfectly  Heirloom tomatoes grilled ciabatta don't know exactly all but   delish! must! small dish but able cut into 3 pieces 3 us  salmon mouth watering grilled perfection amazing flavor! Spinach red quinoa along it  TheF K burger friend looked large delicious side fondue cheese pour all over or dip shoestring seasoned fries  Also looked fried bacon there  Definitely unique dishes   I highly recommend! <EOR> We dinner last night   watched shows place does everything he tells owners do  signature hamburger unbelievable   fries cooked perfection   We only town 4 days but dining again maybe twice! <EOR> Decided sit bar while waited rest group ! doing football specials offering drink specials each quarter different plays ! bartender Jeremy super chill engaged great conversation while waited table    tried Cranberry Caiparosa off healthy drink section     pretty delicious !! <EOR> To place hidden gem! eaten twice both times food delicious portions generous  duck confit cooked perfectly melted mouth! husband ordered Reuben last time ate said great  Don't think just average because its location  Take Uber cab over eating! <EOR> We enjoyed restaurant  Celebrity chef getting here  Food good service excellent   group really good time  Live music helped good experience <EOR> This place TVs great bar but food pretty boring  tried poke appetizer which tiny $19 pretty flavorless far poke goes  also pizza's which something spinach caramelized onions knows else  wasn't good enough remember  probably would back unless just grab drink  <EOR> I'm definitely fan Chef Irvine looking forward trying new restaurant   menu looks good some well thought preparations some standard pub dishes   just think still some kinks work though which why now I'd give 3 stars instead 4   With Yelp check offered free appetizer when order entree score!  opted try Public House Poutine which both thought pretty good   some crispy tots topped pulled pork shiitake gravy goat cheese   The entrees ordered Steak Frites Kurobuta Pork Chop   I'd say pork chop better two mainly because overall execution steak dish fell short   temp skirt steak done nicely mid rare but just under seasoned generally bland  While asparagus hot al dente fries other hand painfully stale cold   pork chop other hand more flavor other components dish hot   The other thing restaurant seemed under staffed staff looked kind sorts   1 2 full but still hard find server busser when wanted some steak knives wasn't brought entrees   The menu looks good I'd love try some other dishes worth going back another try   Hopefully some kinks worked then  <EOR> Options limited when large group impatient doesn't want wait table  Robert Irvine few places took reservations still openings last minute booking Friday night    Our large group ordered multiple entrees largely mediocre particularly memorable  dish sent partially undercooked  ordered mussels uni butter extremely bitter  also served soggy bed fries  almost inedible!  The only saving grace server's professionalism dessert  better restaurants even strip serve better food! <EOR> I ate twice row Sunday Monday while staying Tropicana  Service good  Food competent  medium rare burger extremely overcooked Sunday requiring remake  Better second time   Pastrami sandwich good   Beer selection pedestrian best  Whiskey selection uninspired   Overpriced   Would come if wasn't staying here   And TURN DOWN damn TV's! <EOR> Presentation nice  ordered veggie sandwich added bacon  sold  mention watercress variety veggies  Although sandwich tasty disappointed missing watercress waiter did offer explanation just shoulder shrug  husband ordered skirt steak which fine adding little salt  Also ordered wagu sliders curry fries very light curry flavor fish chips bangers mash which others seemed satisfied with  Good regular fries too  <EOR> Had fish n chips Pepsi while sitting bar $29 total before tip!!!

But everything else great  tater tots super crispy skin on fries excellent  wife grilled chicken bacon sandwich perfectly cooked nice ranch dressing  daughter phenomenal buttermilk fried chicken tangy citrus sauce   And service also top notch  We'll definitely back but think pass burger  <EOR> everything good here!  came mid day fast seating but filled quick!  great service better food!  come again! <EOR> Horrible food  waited over hour ordering even several empty tables  must sitting awhile cold  Service poor  ask salt pepper  Couldn't hear conversation piped music way loud screaming pop rock  asked turned down but no such thing  Would recommend place anyone! <EOR> Wow haven't Tropicana years remodel looks Great!

I very impressed staff waitress extremely friendly knowledgeable  desserts unbelievable sure save room  Specifically tried mason jar apple pie  Las Vegas local typically avoid strip but restaurant definitely worth trek! <EOR> We French onion fondue which excellent   main courses beet salad three cheese pizza covered arugula   Everything tasty fresh served quickly smile! fondue star quite yummy  <EOR>
