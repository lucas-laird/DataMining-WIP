He came back said little over 10 minutes  Mind now 1215 ordered 1130  He then came said 'they forgot yours then chicken then butcher chicken  why taking long ' If would known 20 30 minutes ago would ordered something else!   Finally food came he said free since wait long  few things    1 understand kitchen messes sometimes but waiter should paying attention especially since only table! 2 where hell owner manager?
