Even wife loves cheesy foods nearly gagged having taste  Thirdly pretzel combination under cooked interior nasty cheese sauce made soggy    inedible combination   This first time recent memory something awful throw couple bites would even fewer bites if wasn't trying taste crab  <EOR> Situated next Forum shops ceaser's newly rennovated food court phillip's seafood reasonable  $14 lobster roll     i expecting see crab roll instead offered crab cake roll   It noisey food court but overall great place quick fix seafood go  Express <EOR> Phillips Phillips Phillips    If use Seafood properly prepared  then place you! I ordered Fried seafood trio Maryland Crab cakes Calamari Fried Shrimp subbed waffle fries Hush Puppies best decision night!!! The Crab cakes awful  but could added little Soul mix  Genuine Maryland Crab The Shrimp small way much breading no flavor The Calamari seasoned well!!  But also cooked well  way over cooked predominately tentacles The Hush Puppies absolute Fave  good flavor compared counterparts but good enough order separate  All All  Very repugnant You feel sick time half way through <EOR> The lobster roll just come freezer  threw couple bites Di Fara pizza  food terrible recommend place all  <EOR> Dry fish service horrible April 3 7 30pm tender girl never smiled doing favour when helping me  Bad experience! <EOR> I Lobster Roll    good price    AM HAPPY!

Service forgettable cashiers remind kids working mall  given pager meal w drink arrives 10 minutes   I must say satisfied lobster roll all  only bits pieces lobster while smothered much tarragon mayonnaise while much damn lettuce  roll itself decent but when you're primarily eating bread mayo lettuce doesn't add quality meal  only thing place really going waffle fries crispy outside yet soft inside   I say definitely your money's worth lobster roll nearly $20  would save your money take your $20 nearby slot machine see if luck winning  understand tourist trap area but c'mon guys generous lobster! tasty out of towners leave happy! Anyhow WAY better places dine food court and Caesars Palace matter   rating Phillips Seafood Express below average two stars  <EOR> My husband needed just quick bite eat before headed dinner  know hungry but can't wait 2 hours feeling? us!
