Please better job training your employees  probably deal many things daily basis based location  does mean your employees rude unapologetic behavior     PS worked McDonald's 7 years  unacceptable  <EOR> So never mcdonalds time do   this happens    If could give no stars would!   By far worst place ever simply because person took order Older African American guy  mom stood order cashier mistakes telling mom order coffee she likes Starbucks gonna Starbucks anyways yelling her  speaking language maybe he mistook yelling but still gives no right react way he did    So right off bat he threatens call security which point mom think he joking  Then he asks mom if she ok  mom all confused trying explain haven't even said anything  He gives total hand credit card  He sly remark good thing making yourself  point should just said forget order ahead call security    I appreciate he's looking elder abuse but he should think twice before threatening someone without knowing said  Definitely something corporate must hear because guy needs attitude check  <EOR> OMG never such shitty burger bbq ranch burger threw mouth always loved mcdonalds 4 5 stars but review shit literally would probably eat shit eat bbq ranch burger! <EOR> Why am reviewing McDonald's Yelp?

Changed food preservatives?   Regardless need give fast food anyway bad you  don't smoke live smokers never asthma attack food cooked home   why think must something restaurants use food preservative  first time sick chicken  <EOR> Long story short  Forgot give 2 sandwiches but proceeded charge them  Even 20 piece mcnuggets wasn't full 20 piece  Granted don't come McDonald's service really pissed off don't being ripped off  Don't come store try another branch if you're trying grab some mcdiddy's  <EOR> This Mc Donalds nothing special line gets pretty long but always fast give your food  cheated $1 Sweet Tea though gave small cup  also alot bums but Vegas cheap food  hand hand  <EOR> The New Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich horrible! chicken patty extremely thin batter no flavor! only thing tasteful bun  Please place item dollar menu  charge four dollars change item robbery  <EOR> A stand alone store strip just crazy mess right? Well not   weeknight around 9pm  drive thru line short but moved extremely fast  inside fairly packed don't know fast things moving inside  only thing bothered construction Las Vegas Blvd  If need some quick food dont want park  only drive thrus strip  <EOR> You would think McDonald's Vegas strip would know customers want 3AM morning  Unfortunately not  some reason McDonald's did late night menu  switch breakfast only menu way early night! <EOR>
