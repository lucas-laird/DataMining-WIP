Tequila three times during vacation because service exceptional! <EOR> Wow never update review but WOW !! place its problems before but completely worth visit !! girl behind bar Jill think called probably worst  server bartender ever !! sat down wait notice only 6 people bar would think wouldn't hard but ??? When she finally noticed asked menu she gave bar menu asked full dinner menu ordered chicken quesadilla a couple bucks cheaper bar menu carnitas tacos reg menu point ready order drink but she disappeared even water when she came back repeat order said quesidilla first she then repeated order back wrong !! correct again ! She then off again still no drink ! chips salsa 2 salsas then she finally came back asked if wanted anything drink ordered drink ordered previously cosmorita but she said don't ingredients it  ??? Wtf ??? ordered reg margarita eh!! came same time food which appetizer entree together !! no silverware !! food runner noticed luckily brought some ! point skinney Hispanic guy stocky women came into bar assuming managers but neither noticed bothered ask things seat next me!! quesidillas bones !! Luckily last bite ! time tacos cold flavorless 50% salsa rest tortilla then meat order !! gave eating moved everything off side ! point still no came ask anything !! Another guy walked bar sat next 5 10 mins skinney Hispanic man asked if he helped he politely said no ordered drink he served Hispanic man 5 min later bartender asked if he needed anything !! She then noticed plates stacked asked if she could take them ! no everything ok ? Nothing ! even offer another drink which sitting empty !! Eventually Hispanic man came back asked if needed anything else just asked check he yelled bartender me! Which took another few minutes because she didn't pen ask guy next pen back !! Finally check paid change 100$ bill plus 65 cents nickels !! Btw some people bar 2 salsas others 3 ?? All all would never back !! If wanted bad margaritas overpriced so so food which charged full price quesidilla bar price many other choices !! quote servers 6 bar when asked another patron sitting bar table if restaurant he said heck no if open restaurant going Italian !! Hmm maybe  open location next !! kinda sad but restaurant promise when first opened straight down !!! <EOR> Service good  Food mediocre  Salsa disappointing could've better if little more chunkier  enchiladas which okay  May better if more sauce  Without much sauce left them tasting dry  Nothing rave about  <EOR> We stopped because literally first place came across leaving airport  glad did    The food drinks service good ended celebrating engagement there    My fiancée carne asada  He's incredibly picky eater he loved it  steak perfect  Tender tasty  veggie combo  all excellent really great veggies cooked perfectly  Still crisp flavorful  No pile over cooked zucchini seen  adored food  guacamole super tasty fresh good chips  El Tambien drink thoroughly enjoyed each sip    Every person friendly! guy made guacamole took pride work taste sure perfectly liking  server friendly without being intrusive chatted engagement  He apologized noisiness neighboring party  impressed staff  absolutely again! <EOR> Food okay but just tacos   can't mess bad  But service good all   ordered combo platos  plate mind you  your choice two three items  said two tacos held obligatory two fingers  She questioned order  again said two   Then she then says dos tacos?   Baffled agreed wanted dos tacos  husband ordered three tacos   She didn't understand first because he said three tres   Keep mind entire conversation English very American bred waitress  sign outside says American Mexican cuisine    Then ordered water filled zero times drank down initial offering  Once done food sat 10 minutes before she came ask if she could anything  wait wasn't because she busy three customers dining area three tres other wait staff working  all wanted check point   walked leave did see all wait staff sitting patio chatting  <EOR> Very nice place off road strip mall type buildings  waitress Susy very friendly helpful attentive  She offered spicy salsa which awesome!  All other staff also friendly  Food delicious nicely presented  return next visit! <EOR> Closed Down !!!  Shut doors !!!    Left some employees without paychecks  Check labor board   I don't know why first review placed recommended section because very honest review  lived Las Vegas 14 yrs   loved place when first opened  ate 1 3 times per week until great chef left  Then took break then back when thought might gotten act together  never did recover   reviews ALWAYS true own personal experience opinion    If Yelp employee just watched PBS special am being paid reviews  place DID deserve 5 star   Two months before closing didn't even deserve 1 star food sucked bad  <EOR> This place definitely your typical authentic Mexican food place  However keep mind only open Sunday's brunch assume open other days lunch dinner  place super far strip super close airport  environment looked industrial inside cool but didn't feel Mexican vibe  used groupon deal didn't mention anything using Sunday couldn't use dinner manager owner generous enough give deal anyway hence 3 stars  reason why rate place low bcuz found hair sausage breakfast sandwich which way breakfast over priced  Its something anyone could home especially since give small sandwich bread  waiter extremely nice well  She also 3 stars  <EOR> Went first time Wednesday follks staying Bluegreen week  Everything delicious   Fantastic service  Definitely coming back!!!! <EOR> Great service  Yummy food Carne asada amazing   don't drink made virgin Margarita gave fiánce extra tequila shots  <EOR> What gem restaurant located near airport Blue Green Vacation Club area   Authentic Mexican prepared family touch   Loved huevos rancheros! <EOR> Made day! food service ambience all excellent! breakfast wish long enough try dinner! <EOR> Superb atmosphere food drink staff   stopped casually met Ivan   He helped choose some specialty drinks great food   enjoyed company much came back several times over course week long vacation   Authentic reasonable prices portions HUGE   Thanks again Ivan!  We'll back soon NY! <EOR> The menu misleading confident management understands why  parts menu say entree sides included doesn't actually apply all items under nor does indicate which don't include entree sides your choice  inquired when charged sides thought included given long explanation why refund would inconvenient  Luckily chips replaced refund tasty  Still won't returning  much hassle  <EOR> Disappointed find restaurant yelp says open find closed until Sept 2nd  <EOR> Great food Great service! only downside still waiting liquor license so no drinks   definitely come back next time am Vegas  <EOR> Mediocre food awkward service   waiter acted he'd never seen Groupon before  food completely forgettable point since began writing review forgot ate   But doesn't matter because restaurant closed literally next day  Bye Felicia  <EOR> Read reviews very positive but very disappointed   Prices far high 50% higher traditional Mexican restaurants food NO taste lacked seasoning     sad when add free salsa comes chips food add flavor   complete waste $40+  <EOR> 2nd visit both times AMAZING Ivan bartender right things perfect selection attentive needs but over top  Made come back equally EXCELLENT experience    food excellent service even better <EOR> Nice service Cynthia nothing special food only good deal if used Groupon expensive dinner items <EOR> Went first time  restaurant attached hotel though exterior entrance  Didn't care ambiance didn't feel cozy but did feel classy  But OH WORD food incredible! waitress told buy all organic ingredients everything made order  different food prep area gluten free vegetarian well  chicken fajitas hubby Mexican pasta  home very happy leftovers  Really nice restaurant serves good authentic dishes! <EOR>
