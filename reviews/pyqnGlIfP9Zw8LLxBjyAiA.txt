Service very customized waiter Jonathan did excellent job tailoring menu sample little best Nobu  can't wait come back again would totally same dishes again! <EOR> This initially 2* but having service industry long take experience grain salt  sum food excellent over priced just expected ready but emphasis should excellent because truly worth it  service however pretentious inaccurate but most all excruciatingly slow  server gentleman Italian name ask because he offered no information outside overbearing spiels simply did care much  could throw guesses why he way he most likely group didn't seem would particularly lucrative we all bartenders servers he assumed wrong but conjecture  Getting order painful 30 minute process  Getting refill alcoholic beverages a tap beer whiskey rocks took 15 20 minutes it busy   end just getting damn bill took good 20 minutes  might back but would sure he server  Also dude whiskey isn't made actual coffee made Coffey stills  <EOR> I absolutely love place!!! far best sushi ever tasted! quality food definitely speaks self! <EOR> My husband Nobu 12 29 13 9th anniversary  reservations setting right away  table small middle aisle near door ktchen So huband asked if could another table The Hostess left standing looking place check  few minuets later she comes back tells only tables big parties advises wait  sit dowm  5 10 minutes later someone finally comes over want drink  Well know Nobu expensive but $20 bucks drink  looked each other walked out  probably only people walked out  another resturant great dinner 1 2 price very nice fun waiters hostess  <EOR> Meh    mushroom salad great but prices quantity everything else just wasn't par  Nice tried but no intent coming back  <EOR> I meaning eat Nobu more 10 years   lived NYC Nobu big deal then   live San Francisco now   eat sushi every week least once     I thought food Nobu excellent service at alcohol bar lousy ambience just ok   spare details but food Blue Ribbon Cosmopolitan just good but service ambience much better   Both outrageously expensive should expect  <EOR> Great meal every dish better last  Lives all expectations  Expensive but should come surprise anyone dined any other locations  <EOR> Yellow tail jalapeño awesome Salmon belly unique Vegas location awesome King crab tempura meaty perfect Wagyu beef amazing  <EOR> I'm saying food wasn't good  it definitely good but amazing  definitely price  ordered favorite black cod miso really lacking flavor  $65 sashimi platter also huge let down  probably only 8 10 pieces sashimi  rock cod tempura probably best thing night even then better less expensive Japanese restaurants   Nobu used favorite place NYC super excited Vegas location  Maybe taste buds but really disappointed time around <EOR> Good service good decor  But food salty sour  good Japanese restaurant  <EOR> I should preface review saying am vegetarian eat seafood  asked waiter vegetarian options he suggested tofu toban yaki vegetables $30  asked if any off menu items chef told tofu cantaloupe salad also $30  ordered latter must some miscommunication because ended being small wouldn't even call appetizer  surprised both cost $30 such vastly different amounts food  promptly called waiter over he willingly switched entree tofu toban yaki vegetable stir fry  ended being cooked flamed sake rich sake flavor which think pretty unique  However kind disappointed feel ripped off essentially paid $30 tofu vegetable stir fry didn't even include unique vegetables  Ultimately kind sucked girlfriend weren't able eat same time   My girlfriend ordered black cod signature dishes which she loved  large piece fish cooked well included miso sauce    I personally would back nor recommend place somebody doesn't eat seafood  If eat seafood you'll probably food but prepared pay wazoo  <EOR> It first time Nobu's    server recommended getting  each different types Omakase dinners   Although expensive totally worth it    Everything delicious    honestly say don't know which preferred over other because both good    Service fantastic    Would definitely back again next time we're area  <EOR> Went before going Shania Twain concert Caesar's  Atmosphere nice server OK overly friendly didn't add much experience  assorted sushi quarter size would expect price  Nothing special presentation just OK  miso cod good but nothing crave worthy  Overall price lack luster service would recommend  <EOR> First good service prompt attentive each server knowledgable menu specials    Now average food portions  Except black cod which excellent everything else very average  portions downright silly  don't know if slice yellowtail thinner did if did would empty plate   Now worst prices considering above  paid nearly $500 4 people  includes $60 bottle Sake I could off price but recall   If food fabulous $100 per person handle considering Vegas  But average food terrible portions no way   Do intend return here  <EOR> This place terrible customer service management  dined end July paid credit card  bartender fraudulently added 100% gratuity meal  few days later noticed credit card statement called talked general manager Keenan  He helpful first but never refund fraudulent gratuity wrongly charged  contacted few times initial conversation he always said he would look into but never did  almost 3 weeks nothing resolved  should take more 10 business days refund transaction  am very disappointed experience called upscale restaurant  overpriced underwhelming don't spend your money here  <EOR> Food good  Don't expect other Nobu spots near good  <EOR> Years ago nobu hard rock husband  waiter help choose various dishes enjoyed all them  On recent trip vegas mom visited nobu caesar's palace  The waiter accommodating when said would probably want order just few sushi rolls  He didn't pressure all order more  We ended starting shrimp tempura which very good  But known great sushi rolls would skipped tempura gotten tempura rolls  Btw typical tempura traditional panko breading  shrimp fried but doesn't seem breaded all   We ordered California rolls tuna rolls yellowtail jalapeño rolls spicy tuna rolls  fantastic  Ambiance wonderful  Service stellar  I beer mom said Arnold palmer best she ever had  <EOR> you must tripping if think restaurant deserves 4+ stars  hell justify $20+ seared hamachi jalapeno? same damn dish served 50%+ other japanese restaurants except $10 more expensive!  quality food isn't bad but sure isn't par Sasabune Sushi Zo  there's nothing innovative menu all cant most other japanese restaurants quality really big weighing factor here!  I there's certain premium you're expected pay dine prime location Caesars but literally bending over table pulling down your pants and    well idea   The service pretty good if looking dinner nice upscale restaurant don't mind paying exorbitantly decent food then all means would respectable choice  But just know very easily take cab 10 min off strip any number japanese restaurants serve same higher quality dishes 1 3 1 2 cost   I browsing through yelp review while see order actually saw reviewer sitting table next gave restaurant 5 stars  She eating some maki rolls nudging roll chopsticks   onto spoon then eating spoon  bf lucky lucky man     <EOR> Best sushi Vegas  Hands down! Black cod yellowtail jalapeno sashimi house special roll lychee martinis  Pinch me! <EOR> I heard Nobu knew expensive but wanted try it   husband Thurs eve   could only take 10pm   really worth spending money   Since first time waiter suggested couple cold dishes then couple warm ones   snapper $34 six very thin slices sour sauce yellowtail sashimi jalapeño $24   fish fresh but special   also uni shooter $16 oyster shooter $12    both pretty good  husband liked oyster more   hot dishes famous black cod miso $30   didn't really sauce sweet us  Then scallops wasabi pepper $36   scallops dry really spicy  couldn't eat waiter offered take back  waiter asked if tempura  said ok  He suggested king crab tempura  usual tiny dish six small bite size pieces   later saw $48 bill  good but again very expensive   Since plates small ordered more hot plate  tobanyaki beef  good beef tender  think liked best  $44    overall experience quite disappointing  didn't mind paying $$$$ since knew pricey place  But food service good experience   If really want give try purchase groupon  didn't think checking groupon before going there  later saw available  $150 value $95  <EOR> Amazing! food journey trust your waiter selections disappointed  Loved experience!! <EOR> I spat host metaphorically speaking  Rude pretentious hostesses treat clients if owe them money  place completely empty yet hostess looked down stated I'd wait hour  Then she made off putting holocaust joke coworker giggled  <EOR> Nobu best!  always eat bar   Everyone friendly gives great attention   tried many dishes all great   atmosphere fun  <EOR> We regular's Caesar's Palace but tried Nobu first time last trip  tried number different dishes each section menu everything exceptional     Our server though young incredibly knowledgeable wine selection well extensive menu   really could ask expect better service server accompanying busser runner staff   Nobu deserving $$$$ listed   Expect spend decent amount cash   am only disappointed price when service food does match  tab two tasty bottle wine nice selection food $270 + tip but worth every penny  <EOR> Amazing service  each course each better before  Highly recommended fried rice balls dipped soy sauce spicy tuna  If wasn't expensive I'd eat every day! <EOR> In Japanese Nobu ? means trust  find ironic then cannot TRUST chef provide single delicious plate 7 course daily chef's choice special Caesar's Palace location 2 friends myself experienced worst dining experiences lives  normally don't leave reviews when they're usually positive  sushi around world Hong Kong LA Tsukiji Tokyo while didn't expect best sushi life Las Veags certainly didn't expect WORST    The visual presentation courses cute but  it  the sashimi bland soup broth burnt oysters mediocre best  even worse still hungry end $600 colossal disappointment  politely filed complaints manager received comments condescension refused even apologize attempt offer anything might redeemed night  He simply said appreciate feedback walked away    But if avoid chef special anything else sounds fancy menu  TRUST me  <EOR> Didn't allow take lunch I wanted rolls   table seated 5 people bar  EPIC FAIL  Everyone next door watching games betting area NFL playoffs   eating there  Ever  <EOR> Horrible service cost outrageous even considering sushi    warned when if want spend 500$ appetizers couple drinks then place you  place never service again    Hustlers  <EOR> Good service but chef's omakase very mediocre even bad   Sauces way over powering natural qualities main ingredients none really complimentary flavor profiles   Suggest going la carte picking know like   Though would just put $400 black eat food court   might lose $400 but could also $400   Regardless $20 spend food saved big chunk change  <EOR> Amazing food excellent customer service!

Never experienced something even diner let alone fine fine! Food descent  part just ruined experience  Drinks good otherwise  expected lot better place! <EOR> Had great meal Nobu! nice away all steaks heavier foods night   Everything fresh proof good quality ingredients being used obvious when saw tasted food  Also portions surprisingly generous well!  We didn't much dinner stuffed previous meals    My mom started clear mushroom broth I'm sure much fancier name but  essentially was   plain seemed she said good balance flavour obviously did any hint MSG it  started shrimp tempura  Nothing amazing expensive two pieces but guess eating Nobu shouldn't surprised   For main course try signature Miso Black Cod  can't stress beautiful cut serve  BEAUTIFUL  cut alone wouldn't cheap if bought home yourself  cook beautifully all juices stay fish until cut into put your mouth  only thing little sad because cut thick should've marinated longer entire fish would flavoured all way through  No biggie  top fish amazing    I suggest maybe getting bowl rice having few other small dishes because very rich if try eat its own finish order yourself   Definitely worth going try  Beware slow service  <EOR> Awesome meal last night  Waiter Marcus did wonderful job putting together selections Karen me  Black cod wonderful rock Shrimp tempura bowl ceviche both fabulous!

Second visit mediocre best  Rice almost flawless however  just disappointing presentation lackluster taste  Service quite good however  <EOR> First when crowded noise level deafening  servers good but constantly apologizing took over 1 hour served meal any better your below average Japanese Restaurant   I heard much 'hoop la' restaurant New York disappointed talked everyone into going here  When steak drowned sauce cold   Save yourself $100 another place  <EOR> See experience Restaurant  Yes   when look prices menu shocked  Well   my advise if really wanna try place     set price your mind communicate your waiter when arrive enjoy experience    My first time very excited although prepared pay around $150 per person when really think start imaging hell worth much money!

Yes Yellowtail Black Miso Cod out world BTW Tuna roll spectacular   sat bar waiter beyond attentive helpful friendly  All Sake recommendations spot on   would definitely re visit when return Vegas  <EOR> Finally checked place off bucket list past weekend  must say expected little bit more such notorious restaurant   Perhaps frivolous but absolutely could overlook details interior  ambience felt little economical honey comb paper lanterns hung intrusively above table space  longer stare them more obvious imperfections craft comes forth  little place upscale sushi restaurant    Aside surroundings food stellar  Quality ingredients down seaweed which most pleasant nutty briny essence far more unique commercial brands local sushi restaurants use    Offering wide range items menu spanned imported wagyu gyoza ceviche meat skewers  Sushi tantalized therefore sampled Sushi Dinner consisting 8 pieces sushi 1 tuna maki  tuna definitely revelational  never tuna taste texture variety Nobu  distanced myself commercial tuna long remember due chalky chewy texture but Nobu tuna tasted different species altogether  a must try!  I little confused salmon which floundering texture dissolving instead melting mouth  contrasted expecting kind threw off guard bit yucky honest   The rest platter expected  quite enjoyed octopus nigiri which soy sauced sprinkled sesame  satisfying bouncy texture tasted balanced rice freshly grated wasabi  Also notable mackerel  Unlike commonly stringy overly pickled variety found other establishments mackerel delicate natural muted acidity    Our table six fabulous dining experience embellished great service conversation  If every Vegas again I'd definitely stop again another round sushi! <EOR> Even though reservations time 5 30 stomachs still east coast time glad hour   no lines restaurant quiet army attentive servers doing patrols clear empty plates refill drinks   service amazing when place emptier really take your time appreciate everything without feeling rushed crowded   The hamachi jalapeno appetizer fantastic although little pricey   $30 half price entire entree but glad because really shows off skills chefs   balance everything perfect tasting knew dinner would great   I usually a la carte sashimi sushi restaurants but decided let chef decide us   sashimi dinner sashimi deluxe dinner   brought all same plate beautiful all together   Both dishes 12 15 pieces but deluxe came better cuts fish   3 pieces Bluefin otoro ours but YMMV   sushi snob always fresh wasabi but which comes deluxe dinner sure don't order twice unless need extra wasabi   I flour less chocolate cake green tea ice cream which called bento box   Both delicious recommended waiter   green tea ice cream very green tea y which perfect warm chocolate cake   The only thing disappointing green tea   very watered down but can't knock place down star bad tea   Do yourself favor sure your first meals Vegas   It'll save even looking buffet sushi later on   Definitely must eat Vegas  <EOR> I very impressed Nobu  took FOREVER waiter menu order drink mention prices really worth get  getting fed slow going across hall steak house! When finally service he nice enough  Told menu when he realized never before explained usually worked  ordered sushi which again OK but fantastic expecting  think some other people table slightly better experience but stick know food more expensize doesn't always mean better  <EOR> Top quality fish cuts however much roll selection  Rock Shrimp ok but $26 totally worth it  would repeat customer  <EOR> I guess really don't need write review since really doesn't matter anyone says people continue flock famous restaurant  But let anyways kicks    We came late night snack shopping outlet  Made reservations 9 pm came time restaurant packed still but seated promptly table  first glance thought would ridiculously uncomfortable sit low tables but very comfortable fit atmosphere well  Music loud beautiful people everywhere obviously included night club  waitress came I must admit also beautiful decided menu us  told liked disliked much wanted spend  $150 both told she clarify say each table  Since mid range omakase $200 per person  Trying cool look cheap told dinner already which record truth    The 4 dishes came all excellently prepared delicious yes 4 dishes $150 including tax tips   food runner different each dish seems explain exactly eating eat it   The experience great night club atmosphere service food must eat Nobu least once life time say did it  <EOR> I've always big fan Nobu  favorite still NYC however Vegas pretty good too  first experience sitting sushi bar enjoyed very much  sushi bar chefs all extremely friendly quick taking order   I found ordered certain appetizers half portions of    Everything fresh dessert excellent  shaved ice much bigger expected  would recommend sharing  <EOR> Came first time tried some sushi rolls disappointed  high expectations since place gets lot hype but impressed  rice sushi way mushy tasted better fresher tasting fish we spoiled living Seattle   friend mine ordered scallop stir frys which tried very good but worth price  many restaurants choose Vegas don't feel urge come back again but if definitely avoid ordering any sushi  <EOR> Always love eating Nobu! first time eating Caesar Palace location  Figured would eat Nobu while stayed Nobu Hotel   Everything pretty familiar other Nobu's had  Nothing really special different honestly  But love consistent! <EOR> I would definitely come back here!

If you're looking nice romantic dinner Vegas then place just need! <EOR> My husband came tonight expecting 5 star quality service  Although food tasty service ambiance complete fail  ordered tasting menu telling server comfortable approximately $200 pp when asked  Expecting sake pairing food imperiled paying approximately $500 meal   Being self proclaimed foodies researched restaurant among others decided would one  left second course extremely deflated  sake food served such disconnect could even enjoy it  Food served without sake pairing 10 minutes later sake arrived no explanation  Horrible service experience  spoke management profusely apologized offered card but then expected pay $100 towards meal  horribly insulting  never back  dined many 5 star Vegas restaurants expected best service quality well  Very disappointing  <EOR> Nobu actually Peruvian accented Japanese food Japanese South American food meant sharing  If come expecting Japanese food place then  Peruvian food actually very similar Asian fusion food especially cold hot small plates cold small plates beautiful Nobu creations should really try!   The ambience pretty casual relaxing seated comfy booth started off Badoit sparkling water lemon drop martini cold sake  Loved cold sake container kept sake cold entire time  decided Omakase $225 per person    Omakase courses Yellowtail jalapeño spicy tuna crispy rice salmon carpaccio white truffles whole Branzino white truffles truffle oil mackerel sushi spread    I guess because higher price range made lot truffles  honest am big fan truffles but tasted very good still  whole Branzino very delicious just little small $125 bigger Branzino only $50 French restaurant previous night  mackerel sushi spread favorite few different kinds mackerel fish fresh tasty! Guess next time ask them sashimi sushi only! cold dishes all yummy presentations very beautiful too  Chocolate vodka dessert drink bomb loved it  housemade hot sauce amazing too   Service very friendly attentive food came very fast  great dinner food good but somehow don't think worth over $500 two us  Just keep mind try order hot cold dishes both apps entrees  Nobu restaurants famous for    I still want try Nobu Malibu soon heard views amazing if spend much meal would some views too!

<EOR> I'm officially done wagyu beef  First all really don't know all fuss about  Secondly 38 dollars ounce Nobu minimum two ounces flat highway robbery  absolutely zero issue paying dish where believe quality matches price  wagyu beef just simply great  Also dripping sauce Nobu douses many beautiful fish offerings with  really disappointed New Style Wagyu dish  Just don't it  Trust me!

When server actually did any order taking drinks etc  would come she wouldn't check everyone if wanted another cocktail even if glass low loud restaurant + separate conversations = easy miss her   Then round drinks ordered took 20 25 minutes arrive  assume bar backed but seemed very long time  Meanwhile waters weren't refilled thirsty through much latter half meal  Also several courses came top each other rather following another  just seemed timing issues  Some think being super nit picky but don't think feedback line prices Nobu nor expectations fine dining establishment  None would preclude coming back recommending Nobu  Overall dinner lovely if you're mood some delicious Japanese inspired dishes think should head in! <EOR> The food good amazing service good well portions ridiculously small price paying  only ever come back restaurant if win huge jackpot  <EOR> Top notch 5 stars all way! restaurant good!! twice now location amazing experience both times  Reservations easy ambience perfect food world   Had reservation 8 people business dinner server ordered meal us!

The Yellowtail Jalapeno just enough kick feel heat your mouth without losing flavor Yellowtail  extremely important trick when working such high quality fish!  The rock shrimp fantastic! rich creamy comes top salad nice citrus flavor cut through richness cream sauce  extremely well balanced exactly wanted dish   The Black Cod Miso also very good  favorite dishes order when see menu  many places definitely ranks right top 1 2 spot  Only Irori Marina Del Rey may slightly better dish  two extremely close though   The Salmon sashimi melt your mouth good  Salmon far favorite when no blue fin menu sashimi super fresh!  Last finished Bluefin Toro!!!! $20 piece cheap  However if love sushi try least once  just no comparison other types fish  When order just bite bullet least two pieces per person  If only order you're just going asking your server more piece anyways then probably another that   To top off great food service fantastic  don't remember servers names but super friendly helpful  décor beautiful far nicest sushi places ever to!  Be warned though  cheap all  Even if hadn't ordered Bluefin would easily spent over $200 between two people couple drinks  spent closer $400  well over 100 different sushi places life If really love good sushi try place least once  well worth money  <EOR> Well place recommended buy friends expected exceptional experience but did am snub but when am paying 500$ two diner testing menu live craving cheeseburger problem  Also brake between courses 25 minuets multiple courses arriving simultaneously 30 seconds apart  Food tested good but fail see any Japanese Peruvian Fusion all Tanta Chicago wick amazing bottom line if going spend kind money bar Massa aria much bater  <EOR> Be forewarned yes food pricey most wonder if food really worth price? believe only 2nd time here   I made reservation 1 8pm Monday seated soon showed 7 50pm    The first time right before New Years December time Chef's Daily Creations Omakase $225 pp 2 other people  However time $150 Nobu Signature Omakase was $125 2017    This 7 course plus soup dessert tasting menu well worth much different Chef's Daily Creations Omakase   Before choosing Omakase decided Kikori Old Fashioned cocktail which Yesenia server procured quite quickly  ended drinking total 2 over course meal  Kikori Old Fashioned highly recommended if whiskey Old Fashioneds  serving size worth its price   The service throughout whole tasting menu superb if willing Omakase please set aside least 1 hour 45 minutes fully enjoy meal all courses   From calculations all food received cost $230 portion size taken into account   My top 3 favorite dishes throughout tasting aged Bluefin tuna toro tartare black cod miso    The aged Bluefin tuna unlike any other tuna nigiri melted mouth much flavor never experienced before  sushi lover must each time Nobu   The toro tartare something initially did expect however first scoop amazed blend sauce toro caviar   The signature black cod miso just expected  Cooked perfectly portioned well extra sauce if want more flavor  must Nobu if want signature dishes   The other dishes also superb but those 3 stood opinion   To finish tasting menu chocolate molten lava cake paired fruit green tea ice cream icing cake end meal   Overall SIgnature Omakase tasting menu less food Chef's Daily Creations but well worth if never Nobu would taste he's known for   Now having done both might order la carte another tasting just value  <EOR> I want clear review specific Nobu restraurant Ceasar's Palace Nobu hotel Hard Rock  assume establishments same methods however since chain    Verdict Awful    I would give star except am feeling generous today unlike portions Nobu  fair expected such  didn't expect sub par sushi experience price hype    The hubs VERY experienced Sushi diners tend eat high end  know hamachi bonito  don't generally Western dip everything fake wasabi soy  prefer sashimi but explore interesting world inari maki temaki Japanese warm plates etc     BUT PLACE!

But worth checking if you're into checking different Americanized presentation sushi! <EOR> Great food service  crispy rice squares insanely delicious  Toro hand roll good!!!! drinks yum yum yummy <EOR> Nobu biggest restaurant disappointments ever   Why? Let explain Nobu pretends traditional Japanese restaurant Peruvian flavors  However reality embodies everything which wrong American hip ethnic restaurants    1  food simply good  seafood only semi fresh definitely quality level price would suggest  2  flavors EACH dish totally overdone  Mostly dishes just over salted maximum  Others super sour sweet  Japanese Peruvian cuisines known preserving distinct flavors ingredients Nobu overpowered every single dish sauces seasonings yes even sushi   only dish which okay signature black miso cod but definitely better  3  service ok but great  Servers rushed didn't good job explaining huge menu  4  interior restaurant feels trying hard look cool hip   setting inside way dark seen 10+ guests using cellphone lights able read menu  5  Worst wife quality ingredients definitely way off  both very used seafood raw fish but both terrible diarrhea right dinner   Overall Nobu felt Japanese version Cheese Cake Factory us  huge menu okayish food but nothing particularly good because trying hard appeal average American taste   Definitely coming back  Totally overhyped WAY better options Vegas price level  <EOR> An amazing meal Nobu  Although meal quite pricey well worth money  Restaurant beautiful tranquil inside  Nice low lighting tables spaced feel very private very busy room  bone filet off charts!  sushi point super fresh  service great well seemed 2 servers table whole time  dinning experience took some time manage your schedule before come expect sit around 2 hours  back Nobu again very near future  <EOR> The service impeccable  waiter walked through menu Nobu intended patrons enjoy food  food stellar well  Now although gave 5 stars price definitely something would bring rating down  However food good just wish more price paid  Apparently quieter day restaurant buser informed but just perfect us   a couple want able hear ourselves when conversation  Now did some complaints water being spilled all over husband's feet buser trying refill water glasses table next bones found fish dish  waiter apologized profusely all those matters  But it  <EOR> I dinner twice past years Ceasar Palace  food good  drinks aren't favorite but ok  Sugarcane blows everyone away drinks big competition Nobu food wise  Nobu overrated everywhere  regular prices could probably rate more stars but pay expect top quality no average cocktails  <EOR> Came without reservations Thursday night but nabbed seat bar    Certainly best most authentic Japanese food ever especially spending year Japan but creative most certainly tasty  neighbors bar very friendly all cheer against Miami heat together  no better bonding experience    The bartender also extremely nice drink the sakura   something quite potent  Sipping drink lasted all through dinner    We ordered yellowtail w jalapenos or something cold dish good rock shrimp crab tempura  also sweet shrimp fried heads some ikura sashimi  Next time would skip rock shrimp crab tempura since both fried didn't realize time ordering    Overall solid meal some fun new friends  <EOR> This first time visiting any Nobu locations unfortunately didn't try much hoped for various reasons review primarily regarding service although talk little ate   My friend intended dinner before going see Britney Spears but somewhat last minute decision called around 5 30 pm see busy would 7 00 pm  hostess phone rude could give slightest estimate anticipated wait time 7pm Saturday was  She quickly rushed off phone    We decided try anyway arrived I assume same hostess RUDE  asking questions wait times seating bar sushi bar she acted if she did want give time day  wait sushi bar 20 min decided wait grab drink bar    Things better  ordered drinks immediately hostess arrived take sushi bar bartender brought drinks over us  She super nice helpful drinks great although difficult mess dirty martini     The first sushi chef quick friendly but very chatty  only ordered few rolls because somewhat rush  highly recommend soft shell crab! second chef friendlier funny  waiter pleasant attentive however mostly unremarkable    From heard Nobu expected better experience  wasn't terrible update review when am able try more food selection but also didn't expect best experience bartender  lower rating attributed experienced versus expectations Nobu  <EOR> Our first time Nobu best sushi ever! Omakase 8 courses  courses delicious adventurous  LOT food  Most courses raw delicious beef dish broth towards end  dessert chocolate lava cake matcha ice cream extremely tasty! server great  cocktail menu also worth checking out  definitely back Nobu future  <EOR> Sushi basically favorite food ever MANY sushi places  place just incredibly overpriced is  mean even when you're expecting Nobu prices    First if you're looking sushi meal isn't place  fact waiter told upfront they're known sushi they're known hot cold dishes  dishes all smallish portions hefty price tag  Everything good but stellar  nothing particularly innovative fresh dishes here  felt kinda all very 2010? best thing dishes probably presentation which important but won't carry day alone  decor nice ambience nice  But food pricing just kinda ridiculous  disappointing having high expectations! <EOR> Seriously best restaurant experience ever had  Besides exceptional food service also stands out  ended staying Vegas myself decided treat myself Nobu  worried people judge being alone restaurant but servers hostess made feel comfortable while eating  chose chef's special where each dish created chef menu  8 small plates special 24k dessert made overjoyed experience Nobu  worth every penny  <EOR> Seriously overpriced gimmicky   If came big night gambling some money burn then maybe   positive note waiter   He very knowledgeable helped navigate voluminous menu patience class   all liked Hokusetsu sake definitely worth premium price  <EOR> #1 Nobu experience friend brought introduced Black Cod Miso fan ever since  Following some amazing sushi but life unable remember past cod when thinking back   Every visit Nobu should start Black Cod Miso  <EOR> Nobu favorite Japanese place! am extremely sad isn't Nobu San Francisco  heard Nobu sister huge foodie she told place if Vegas  bit hesitant because typically don't sushi sashimi which something nobu known for  decided anyway because boyfriend loves Japanese food   When awe  First off restaurant beautiful  interior design mesmerizing unique feel it  made mistake making reservation but able seat next sushi bar right away    Our waiter awesome!
