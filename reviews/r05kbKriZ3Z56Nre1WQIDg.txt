He told it'll bill he'll bring didn't say when    So thinking myself   kind want now   when am going it? hard verbally tell password? post somewhere everyone?  Sure enough he forgot bill didn't until finish food  He apologized your note  I wouldn't say mad but just doesn't sense  If let your guest enjoy free wi fi why would even set guest wifi???

On nondescript corner somewhere between strip downtown place without casino foot traffic flip floppy marble walkers downtown project coolsters midst Bail Bonders court goers Juhlers you'll find very rough diamond restaurant   With its pedigree good chef would expect more memorable is   After all following Subway ization strategy infected pizza places burrito joints late spring roll bar sounds something you'd put race car April doesn't it?

If you're looking some traditional Vietnamese dishes haven't seen yet Vegas then your chance  Everything tried excellent! spring rolls Banh mi pho dip! guarantee blown away! Cheers! <EOR> This place looks cool conveniently located downtown  Unfortunately vegan broth literally water  No flavor all  cannot vegan pho because noodles totally bland well  place would well improve flavor food  Especially considering prices quite high  <EOR> Very modern atmosphere really unique flavors  portion huge much more would've expected  Attentive service but intrusive   wonderful experience would definitely recommend locals tourists alike! <EOR> I came late lunch ate bar  Quick service bartender friendly  back again  <EOR> Tried place today lunch   ordered takeout    To start chicken 11 30am which weird  tried sub beef salad said no pork instead  salad assistant newly diagnosed having celiacs  told girl phone   not sure she believed me  Sorry   not just gf trend here  Some ppl actually can't eat wheat  Anyways salad made sick  Obviously gf   I ordered vegan pho spring rolls  She asked many spring rolls thought la carte  They're not  ended 6 orders spring rolls was ordering office  WTF  least they'll keep fridge    I guess  future reference they're 2 per order   The vegan pho underwhelming say least  veggies over cooked mushy flavorless  broth ok but mostly just salty  noodles weird   not normal pho noodles  almost looked ramen  gave tummy ache   Overall can't recommend food  Also pho Chinatown 100x better  <EOR> Came visit friend lives Juhl he recommended Le Pho due convenience he likes food   rarely Vietnamese Food didn't know expect thought would spicy  delicious!  WOK TOSSED FILET MIGNON friend Vermicelli Bowl Pork   kindly omitted bell peppers dish   service great ended sitting bar while bartender check menu options he very friendly didn't seem mind questions   great location if you're downtown especially if live Juhl!  Good prices nice mellow EDM soundtrack   own Saturday busy day ended back takeout     I'm giving five stars only because don't any experience Vietnamese food don't know if BEST   but could be       FYI service both times great  <EOR> Again live few feet upstairs joint really want eat because convenient  food solid but service literally WORST! downstairs grab drink some food thought maybe just maybe! Sitting bar would better service  Completed opposite sat 10 min  never even asked if wanted drink left  won't returning until place act together      hate leave bad reviews but frustrates much <EOR> I just rolled into Vegas circuitous trip Atlanta Denver SLC couple hot springs campgrounds all car few days Vegas before languid trip back Portland  I'm spoiling myself  should too  As tend first thing when back civilization some pho  Being Portland considers itself pho capitol everything little cautious best bring first time Vegas  pleasantly proven wrong! The drinks top notch pho fresh delicious very quick  am impressed  bartender server guy friendly fast efficient  only ate found tonight soft opening  doubly impressed  You'd thought they'd years practice  So if pho stiff drinks your jam  I'm telling any off Portland friends but beats most favorite places  <EOR> The chicken pho very good  best very juicy tender broth ass tasty well  took 25 minutes food ordering    little long especially pho  <EOR> Wanted try something new to downtown feeling sandwich mood popped here  busy Friday but only seating bar  C'est la vie food!  Had House Banh Mi which very delicious  splash Sriracha brought some more flavor top already very well put together sandwich  Also green tea Thai tea which little sweet but overly so  Liked all   Cool location interesting industrial interior  would curious come back dinner happy hour when look some great deals happening  <EOR> Nice renovation modern fusion  love pho! Soup salty both chricken beef taste almost same  service good! <EOR> My boyfriend last night dinner  food really good  Oxtail pho really good service great!
