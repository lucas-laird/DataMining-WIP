When waitress finally came back give check told never received rolls she asked if still wanted it? issue bring something supposed beginning?  ribs dry macaroni n cheese cold hard  once again service acceptable   I would refer restaurant any one! <EOR> Really disapointed burger cost way much unseasoned patty  even level say Red Robbin  Wife Reuben sandwich she said 1 2 decent  Even 16 oz beer tasted Draft lines hadn't cleaned years   could swing drink music but won't eat again  <EOR> Very few good choices Harrahs  Figured might ok given simple faire  Likeable staff usual loud sports stuff but still places quite full volume if look around  Food unfortunate expect Las Vegas  Indifferent prep presentation   Buying less expensive entree would probably better call reduce ripped off sensation really adds insult   Beware being offered double when ordering drinks  only price double but then add another double fee top that  drink costs more rib eye dinner!  Pretty clever   Good place if loud mediocre don't care costs it  <EOR> This favorite place Vegas! Touristy may love bar! 0 The food fabulous wait staff super friendly and fast atmosphere fun loud definitely country   My husband loved chili cheese fries  catfish po' boy he cowboy Reuben  both delicious boxes    If you're around Toby Keith's would definitely take time stop try it   5+ times haven't disappointed yet!

Now you'd think waitress would mop clean up   But nope just put cone over spill   if no noticed spill grew exponentially underneath cone  <EOR> Wehaa!!

You'd think no brainer  <EOR> We've several times  love music atmosphere but food only so so  trip steak pulled pork sandwich She's Hottie wrap nachos  didn't care nachos  Everything else good but great  menu seems more limited past   Love mason jars  would give 3 1 2 stars if could  <EOR> Slowest  Service  EVER  Came Sunday night wasn't exactly busy  Took 45 minutes seated although several empty tables   Server super friendly just greatest job  Food just ok    bad but great  Grilled Chicken Wrap probably wouldn't order again if came back which probably never   water super chlorine y yuck  Fries pretty tasty however  Took another 30 minutes pay bill  Sorry Toby Keith can't say love bar     <EOR> I really LOVE bar! opinion best bar around last call just head down Carnival Court which open later!  You order your drink mason jar $19  Seems pricey but considering most drinks Vegas $12 really good deal    Every time fun band playing between sets DJ play mix music not just country  If lucky enough night where locals lead line dancing    Overall really fun place favorite spot Vegas  <EOR> I've tried place twice both times high expectations both times left dissappointed  ambiance cool country but service lacking  food neccessarily bad but its top notch any means  <EOR> I'm country western fan don't know Toby Keith other someone girlfriend drooling over  But know country western people know eat all visiting bar grill while visited Vegas    It's inside Harrahs strip   It didn't open until 11 which bit annoying considering hungry 10 am but eventually did  many chains feeling same old same old moment walk just any Jimmy Buffet Margaritavilles Applebees    There lot country music videos TV mostly Toby Keith bra's hanging around bar  country western bar sure! stage live music  cool thing order your beer giant mason jar just Coors mason jar only   hate Coors but figured when Rome      The next day popped once again she could some souvenirs gift shop pose cut out photo Toby  did order some chili fries delicious which confirms theory food must pretty good chain kind way  Hot fresh plentiful  Overall lacks original feeling  But plan hit Phoenix next time did its job but avoid Coors  Yuck  <EOR> I only gave place 3 stars because live country music bands perform each night bands chosen directly Toby Keith himself supposedly    band great night bar nice large almost size dance hall   located 2nd floor Harrahs which something most people need know when trying find place   Otherwise big fan place simply because domestic beer prices BOTH bottle draft $7 EACH   buy entire six pack price!!  Since probably last time would ever visit Vegas again lifetime sucked stayed little while   However wouldn't back   Since very few good choices country music bars Vegas would recommend place those desparately looking country music bar Vegas don't mind paying $7 per beer   may happy hour lower prices but cannot confirm that   know bands start 9pm each night Happy Hour over then if all  <EOR> Really delicious burger drink toadfish pond something that   All around good  <EOR> The food ordered alright but service atrocious  larger party seated point server seemed forget any even existed another couple across couldn't attention   Ended having track down manager just check some carryout containers   In addition incredibly dark much even reading menu hard pull off without pressing your face   Also why all female servers seemingly required wear backless chaps panties completely visible way short shorts? sure corporate made call but here's tip Let food your reason some pointless lowbrow nonsense that   Honestly if standalone place outside casino wouldn't last long all issues  <EOR> Let start off saying LOVE country music course visit Toby Keith! felt south because atmosphere items menu   I would given 5 stars but server very ditsy bit rude  Order nachos!

I've years but say service degraded understatement   We waited 10+ minutes bar service even then sketchy  bartender spent entire time fraternizing two patrons while others waited without drinks service   The free cornbread stale dry worth every cent cost  butter good but limited   The bartender recommend fried mac cheese which love but things near tennis ball size tasted horrible recommended   I ask another drink twice wasn't even busy   The strange thing butter came corn cob hard tasteless sure why didn't use same butter cornbread beyond least good   Horrible experience  Service sucked food horrible won't returning  <EOR> Of all things did 3 nights best! Friendly bar staff reasonable prices  Very good band night there  People watching excellent! line dancing country music worth all! 2 orders wings very dry   Also would nice someone pick food done eating  drinks Mason jars atmosphere gave such high ratings  Food much  <EOR> I waited longer table would expected given place wasn't quite full  food very slow arrive well    The Cajun Shrimp appetizer decent  large portion served hot tasty dipping sauce  believe menu description inaccurate shrimp itself spiced all  say bad just expecting   The veggie wrap  admittedly most patrons going order land excess Las Vegas  awful  filling 95% shredded lettuce few other bits stuff thrown color dressing much bland just yucky  considered sending back but nearly only thing menu didn't used hooves  which mean didn't lot vegetarian ish choices   The service slow throughout meal waitress habit timing drive bys when mouthful food couldn't say anything  fast she moving you'd think she'd back around more frequently but no  Don't let your drink glasses empty you'll sitting thirsty while   All said setting lively especially later night when there's band stage  fan country western but I'd watch just any good band live    If you're just going quick meal you're better off elsewhere e g  next door Imperial Palace there's decent homestyle mexican place   <EOR> Fun bar! live cover band DJ Friday night  Drinks light alcohol   But band entertaining  <EOR> Always good time  Bands hit miss  Better weekends  Best pours when order bar  <EOR> Delicious food!

Music videos fun well  Only thing keeping 5 Star review servers dressed chaps showing ass  mean hooters it? servers dress sexy without dressing Vegas showgirls  <EOR> My coworkers placed large order to go food came pretty fast  Once started eating though    Oh boy    couple meals decent BUT couple issues    American Soldier Burger tough bone like pieces it  Coworker broke tooth  When called informed restaurant told could bring back    Chicken Dumpling soup  BLAND  grandma's all!!! made biscuits actual homemade dumplings  Tasted garlic biscuits    I personally would order again   server very friendly but food overall impressive  <EOR> If love country place Vegas you!  My boyfriend surprised took Vegas birthday first time Toby Keith bar  I'd heard friends loved sure loved too  bar very big lots tables dancing area dance live band  didn't any food since all just wanted drinks  staff friendly served quickly  music loud drinks strong! They're little expensive but guess sense since they're served huge mason jars  Seriously they're huge really heavy complaining  long island $30 big mason jar totally worth it   We stayed quite while dancing until little band took break  place great vibe awesome atmosphere  definitely returning when come back visit  <EOR> Good food great service awesome atmosphere! grilled chicken spinach wrap ranch BBQ sauce home made coleslaw garlic pickle spear   all very fresh delicious! visit again next trip back Vegas  <EOR> Went lunch today few years ago trip very disappointed   wanted salad much choose or anything else menu   I ordered build yourself salad which stated ranch salad then add grilled chicken fried chicken shrimp fried chicken supposed cucumbers red onions tomatoes cheese roasted corn it   It mostly all iceberg lettuce hardly any chicken no cucumbers onions barely any corn onions boot $14 99   I felt rip off worst salad long time   My husband ordered All American Burger which came big bun but meat didn't even touch edges bun he said very tasty cost $13 99   Will returning again high price under average food  <EOR> Servers look eye then ignore when only customer standing bar wanting drink  Incredibly egregious customer service  <EOR> Good wings Nachos  Catfish overrated  seated took 15 minutes before anyone came take order even acknowledge us  Several staff members walked did check us  wont return  <EOR> The food atmosphere great! But servers rude 1 star  group 7  1 person ordered 20$ drink wasn't hungry servers told she needed sit bar while rest ate  7 people order over 200$ expect better service  really disappointed because favorite stops  <EOR> Honestly did know Toby Keith until actually looked Internet while dining   When Las Vegas often pick place eat when am family   However time around since Casino hopping via Monorail capitulated group's choice   We normally eat other establishments don't Bar Grills  But since everyone famished wanted eat NOW chose closest restaurant stop   We greeted hostess walked through entrance  She very pleasant nice  seemingly impromptu choice family seemed would turn good choice  place brightly lit clean spacious many patrons plenty great seats choose from   The hostess grabbed menus exited booth she situated led table  Now punch line followed her none could help but notice fact she wearing chaps nothing covering rear except very small and nearly non existent panties   Well great choice Family!? perplexed look face stared onto wife's daughter's grinning faces!

No thanks Guy  BTW no reservations? Come on   First TK's fun atmosphere but looks normal 'ol bar grill  walls decorated Toby Keith    things all girls wear panties chaps  Ass your face every time your server leaves your table  Speaking service could improved  seated waited good 10 minutes put order luckily since all sufficient time all knew wanted eat drink   Onward food steak fajitas which came sizzling made excited  But when placed front let down  beef haphazardly cut chunky strips  Plus meat seasoned anyway looked just WRONG me  Fajitas come your choice corn flour tortillas  picked corn half them steamed enough hard edges  brought them tortilla holder NO LID  heck? No wonder did steam all way  Dear manager TK's put lids your tortilla holders customers tortillas soft! fajitas also came rice OK refried beans OK salsa not spicy all guac OK sour scream OK   Overall could great dish only mediocre   Next Love Bar BBQ Sandwich mother requested no sides sandwich but brought fries anyway  She said BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce    Chicken Fried Steak brother said so so REAL chicken fried steak family's opinion because didn't appear pan fried which honest way chicken fried steak deep frying lot breading  Speaking breading     My husband's fish chips mostly breading which he peeled off he could actually eat fish   Lastly shrimp appetizer which father ordered meal came HUGE amount deep fried little shrimp  20 came tasty creamy cajun flavored dipping sauce  really liked shrimp   Overall feel though could lot improvement  Toby Keith  idea restaurant really all country music playing but food huge downer  <EOR> Tried place first time over weekend group friends   tried put reservation night but told reservations made day advance   WTF!?!?!  Anyways food ok   Wife tried Burger Country Fried Steak      nothing special there   Plain old American diner food served twice price   drinks though pretty good   32oz jars $18 bucks pop isn't bad deal considering you're getting two drinks one   Whiskey Girl wife trying first line when offered free shots bar   The cover band actually pretty good Saturday night only negative once started enjoying ourselves dinner listening band next dance floor told give table   time place standing room only didn't bother sticking around  <EOR> Came back try some food enjoyed first time around few years ago  Nope same  least quality didn't seem same list time    We tried Fried Pickles much batter pickle itself pretty good though Biscuits Gravy Chicken Bronco Burger   The wife said biscuits gravy pretty good but oil chicken fried made taste just pickles which didn't leave good taste   Bronco burger kitchen sink burgers  Pulled pork Bacon Onion Ring + normal fixings burger  good nothing super special but solid burger  meat itself very well done which bummer but ain't gonna complain that  must say need change oil something because fries tasted just wifes chicken fried pickles   Overall I'd probably pass next time  Even though located inside favorite hotels stay strip  <EOR> My 2 favorite things place Buffalo Cheese sticks mason jar alcoholic drinks  cheese sticks made jack bleu cheese believe when breaded dipped buffalo sauce  come ranch bleu cheese dressing great twist traditional mozzarella sticks   The mason jars expensive side avg  $19 but big last while  good burgers yummy crispy steak fries almost every meal little over sized    My biggest gripe service all hostess' waitress' women many them snotty  First off walking around chaps asses hanging might reasons uptight attitude very rude  most recent time husband came in laws waitress horrible  She never cracked smile rammed into purse almost knocking down it hanging chair she didn't apologize even look back she forgot mother in law's drink because oh uh someone just handed back check haven't chance pick your drink bar  someone else run half wit! She's lucky father in law paid because would left sour puss face 1 red cent  Don't your job? Your ass cold?
