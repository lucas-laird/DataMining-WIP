Yep said it   Club Tuna #15 exact quality really good all vegetables being fresh   only thing I'd prefer tuna bit more flavor   some simple relish would suffice   Also drink offerings style   I don't drink soda   some fresh brewed ice tea everyone else has?  Service good all around place clean   restroom even soap soap dispenser!  confusing thing which suppose could problem busy day when sandwich done just call its number i e  Number 15    what happens busy day when maybe 3 people same order?  brawl could ensue!
