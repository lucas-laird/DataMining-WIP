He brought little samples good used unfortunate no longer put them table side    The food bit below average quality taste temp bit off  service slow distracted which seemed odd considering only some handful customers there   check took 30 minutes arrive totally done plates cleared  He knew done yet he missing 30 minutes   I only speak quality burgers onion loafs sauces   however once fantastic place gone down hill no longer worth money time  <EOR> The food good but some problem kitchen slowed down service  nice  comped apps made sure rest meal well  <EOR> I think place am reminded being almost 17 discussing all important prom details here    If your ribs healthy serving strip mall cheesy goodness side your spot  Look no further! <EOR> WTF Tony?

Just more inconvenience ask servers it  guess they're really trying save costs huh?  I came last night ordered full slab baby back ribs side baked potato rice It's only item order every time dine   baby back ribs glazed bbq sauce freakin good always freakin good  ribs tender juicy  However feel portions gradually decreasing over years  confident say two full slabs today would full slab back day along cheaper prices    Sadly due lot changes think lost lot business  However if really craving baby back ribs which isn't very often days most likely end coming back here  <EOR> Food decent but wait staff extremely unprofessional well slow  Which weird considering only 4 customers total restaurant nearly 12 wait staff    took nearly 20 minutes receive drinks should warning sign     probably never return    Tony Romas nothing California ones im used to  <EOR> Received free birthday coupon cutting down   used free entree now $15 that?
