Every time someone brings plate food drink they'd ask ordered this? didn't bring appetizer until asked ended being right before main meals came    The appetizer noodles good but kinda small portion costing over $4   The soup appetizer section menu also came way late  soon soup came said doesn't soup come topping? seen pics yelp looked different told them  tiny amount cheese gathered all  also only 3 tiny pieces chicken made canned veggies  should took pics but hungry didn't want Benedict cold just ate that  Benedict good least good potatoes  4 4 5 if rated meal alone    Even expressing displeasure soup having empty drink long let drink run again  servers don't help each other work sections  server the manager just poked head looked room but wouldn't come check weird    Finally manager brought table beside pancake he forgot but didn't container when clearly group ready long before  manager didn't think customer just own planet    What bumps 1 star decent food manager trying end but frustrating  asked manager lady said okay rolled eyes laughed! knew why when first realized server manager lol    He heard but didn't seem care all much  He said give another try come back tomorrow free meal said try again but least 2 4 weeks give time update train employees  chatting little longer asked check he said cover but pay next time  he offered free meal but but literally 1 2 minutes later changed mind said pay next time   Hahaha funny    It awkward breakfast likely back anytime soon  Hope review helps keep your expectations realistic least    Enjoy <EOR> Nice smaller place just west 15 fwy  Although seemed very busy seated right away  Waitress greeted gave beverages promptly ordered them  She approached just made mind have  many appetizing choices  She wrote down order quickly   The food plentiful  veggie omelette  fresh filling   husband Josephina also very tasty  <EOR> Can't say enough good awesome place! atmosphere menu choices service taste price portion location parking although live mountains edge worth drive sorry didn't find sooner!!

But distracting sit area where all employees stop chat  wish tad more professionalism end  <EOR> Hubby loved place when discovered during trip Vegas! loved much came eat twice!   Coffee pub feels eating someone's giant California kitchen  homey comfortable somewhat lively very nice    They offer small variety different coffee drinks which qualifies them word coffee restaurant name   When notice restaurant calls themselves coffee shop but only serving regular coffee IMO don't right call themselves coffee anything    The food awesome portions big prices reasonable everything ate during two breakfast trips delicious! would into more detail but since Vegas last month already just remember loved it!

Thank yelpers directing another great local find   I visit Vegas quite bit try eat Strip if possible   Strip rip only benefit eating Strip use comp points mediocre overpriced food   Finding mom and pop place Coffee Pub trip more enjoyable   Its nice just walk away clangs slots smoke filled casinos   This Coffee Pub tucked away desolate strip mall completely opposite side other merchants   Its next Embassy banquet type place which mistook Embassy Suites Hotel its not!    Its across Nevada Bank if helps   The place small holds maybe 50 80 people cozy few big table groups   There's outside tables pets I guess? maybe smokers though am sure Nevada laws regarding smoking near eating establishment   Prices reasonable plenty choose Breakfast Brunch Lunch   Originally going breakfast but sandwiches sounded yummy decided instead  thought ordered San Diegan but realized Redondo turkey bacon avocado sourdough   came melted cheese but held off cheese  comes fruit salad chips   Stephen huevos ranchero he said good kick it     I'd come back!

Lauren server over top   walking around couldn't find place following Siri called Lauren actually ran find me  girl excellent customer service skills being past coffee shop owner myself truly appreciate quality! Thanks pleasant experience good food  <EOR> So decided give coffee pub chance based past reviews hoping maybe find ourselves new breakfast spot   Unfortunately pretty disappointed   White mocha mish mash unbearably sweet bitterly burnt espresso milk   The pancakes bland       tough?!?!?!  takes some special skill pancakes TOUGH leathery  The country potatoes were     confusing mix underdone overdone   and Eimi's words ribeye Tastes reason why didn't meat growing Prices above average serve  The only saving grace kept restaurant away one star review friendly waitress   I hoping much better below mediocre   search breakfast spot continues  <EOR> The most incredible waitress ever works Lauren!
