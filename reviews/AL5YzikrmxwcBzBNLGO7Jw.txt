Fuddrucker's two locations Valley south west side town located your average shopping area Target Sears other typical crap  interior kind country kitchen meets Hawaiian theme something doesn't whole lot sense nothing fancy great  Also most patrons reminded folks spotted last time visited Farmer Boys think your average Wal Mart customer  menu offers few different sized regular burgers chicken sandwiches salads other things but items going draw back 'exotic' burgers made elk buffalo wild boar  More bit   I 1 2lb Original which comes 100% USDA all American premium cut beef sesame bun variety toppings available self serve bar  self service bar scary buffet style presentation wilted lettuce large slice shredded variety sliced tomatoes peppers onions few other items  also sauce 'island' ketchup mustard cheese sauces few other selections  decided keep very simple just lettuce tomato could sample exactly given  probably mistake  meat bad flavor overcooked dry  thick bun also dry didn't great flavor  cheese lettuce tomato all just ok didn't anything improve burger  burger sucked quickly realized draw could wild game burgers suddenly wanted come back try despite mess sitting hand  Mind probably won't happen any time soon   The fries also completely sucked dry generic just good  some seasoning but really did nothing help flavor nor did variety sauces tried  outside thought longest time slightly 'fancier' sit down restaurant similar Red Robin something no idea more less fast food restaurant just served terrible food  meal came $24 41 which far much crappy fast food meal two  going back some point check 'exotic' meat but despite many readers said would recommend staying away here  <EOR> 2 burgers 2 onion rings 2 drinks = $30?

Fantastic!  The burger very very good especially put your own toppings on  No more making sure know mean double pickles double onions etc  etc  just walk over toppings bar load up   They also pepperoncinis aka banana peppers which if haven't tried them burgers yet add really great flavor you're missing on   The fries thick cut cooked very well nice crispy outside soft steamy inside   The staff kind acts don't want there  Which doesn't surprise given all appear high school age kids when age didn't want work either  No big deal order right register girl definitely good customer service  <EOR> Grew chain Texas where apparently higher standards both quality product service    Popped grab burger takeout when guy craving  Signage advertising new bourbon burger caramelized onions bleu cheese crumbles bacon sweet bourbon sauce   Opted 1 2 pound version $8 asked side fries   Receipt reflects charged $13 apparently upgraded combo despite receiving drink  Apparently regular order wedge fries consists 12 pieces  FOUR FUCKING FIFTY  $4 49 close enough   I somehow did realize while waited 20 minutes order   Was asked wanted burger cooked stated medium  Burger received well done  Despite all toppings listed ad only onions bourbon sauce appeared present flavor very scant amounts each because still came off dry  Did taste any cheese whatsoever  Fries tasty topped jalapeno cheese sauce condiment bar love much  just wish didn't pay $4 49 twelve fries   Oh part service 20 minute wait takeout?

WTF? 2    Honestly came wanting try ostrich burger the tastiest animal two legs however they're until August 20th  hubby shrugged split elk burger instead all trimmings diet Dr  Pepper hoo! side seasoned fries   First things first really impressed side bar toppings available here  Love fresh veggie bar fresh iceberg cut wedges shredded wedges better course! tomatoes onions pickles  Personally didn't salsa because tomatoes gotten little mealy but  just taste   The burger came impressed size  When saw instantly gratified only ordered burger share   The meat itself good medium done  However felt patty lacked seasoning  Another problem burger bun  bun little large patty wasn't anything special kind your average hamburger bun   Although overall burger okay sure would justify 7 99 pricetag   The fries great lacked crispness adequate seasoning good french fry  soda however dead good watered down stuff see most places  Diet Dr Pepper pretty much tasted does can   My beef ordering exotic burger no combo deals here  must order drink fries la carte pricing if order exotic burger   why cost $14 burger fries drink   Overall burger okay drink good fries worth price  think come back when ostrich just try it  <EOR> Exceedingly excellent customer service  Dan team way help boyfriend's bday party  food made right every way  helped bring cake already lit candles initiated singing  mention excellent burgers  yes signature burgers packed flavor  highly recommend trying exotic burgers  <EOR> the burgers good but main thing draws unlimited toppings selection  love dipping burger jalapeno cheese bbq sauce  good  brother law commenting strange design load bearing post middle dining room  very strange way design dining area way    <EOR> My review may little biased because vegetarian can't say much specialty burgers  price food pretty decent  $10 combo which includes burger toppings free wedges onion rings drink shake  services fast friendly topping condiment bar burgers sides  veggie burger okay wedges weren't dry  sisters however didn't care much burgers  both ordered burgers medium rare but instead well done  Also buns burgers huge  Why guys huge buns? Why?!  So overall food okay  Definitely best burgers town but prices fair put whatever toppings want it  suppose worth try  <EOR> Great buffalo burger!  I only eat once every few months given isn't near house but every time am disappointed  buffalo burger thick very juicy which isn't easy feat given its low fat content    The condiment bar great  very picky when comes amount condiments put burgers  Restaurants fast food sit down alike always put much everything taste  also made mistake ordering light [mayo mustard etc ] only receive most minuscule amount  Fuddruckers add everything own preference which course solves problem  fries also really great  Thick cut hot every time  If something sweet finish off your meal brownie pretty good well!  Waiting line sometimes little lengthy  don't blame Fuddruckers though and thus did deduct any stars   think newcomers initially thrown off meat choices repeat customers switch up  Everything ordered la cart also which increases order time  <EOR> This actually smaller ones Fuddruckers     going them for    wow   20 years now?  The service impressive       Yes    waited little longer usual burger but enjoying company       along fact little smaller rest Fudd's problems bit cloggage when came getting line condiments    all good   We really good experience wait staff too    helpful getting stuff cleared when mom mentioned didn't ice cream area others lady even improvised made little sundaes!!!!
