I love cinnabon  ok one   Mostly everything gets baked fresh every half hour  service ok workers aren't friendly but don't care just want cinnabon  <EOR> Can never wrong sweet tasting Cinnabon roll   favorite comes pecans which gives your desert breakfast nice littlee crunch  <EOR> First stop when Vegas?  Cinnabon because we're hungry fresh off road trip   Next we'll Luxor before leave we're back again along Fat Tuesdays    good Fat Tuesdays  <EOR>
