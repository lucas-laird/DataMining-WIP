Many other reviews don't even touch upon quality taste food but rave price discounted pick pizza special friendly service staff  don't care nice cheap if getting inedible product  if best say pie $7 95 well  saying lot it? don't want come wings burgers chicken sandwiches salads quesadillas  want pizza calzone!  My bill delivery tax tip came around $48 dollars worth even 1 4 that  ordered Sicilian 4 topping pie $21 medium two topping Calzone $15 Cannoli $4 bucks so  items halfway good  Let's begin pizza  8 square slices each ridiculously heavy    easy tell why    mostly consisted super dense uncooked raw dough  Sicilian pizza should thick but dough should light airy  Because hungry picked off toppings edge crust put crust oven until crisp ate toppings  only positive cheese toppings seemed quality product   The Calzone truly awful  Calzone should thin crusted popover stuffed 80 85% ricotta cheese rest mozzarella your choice topping  received soft mushy doughy I don't know paper thin layer ricotta if spread peanut butter sandwich  layer didn't even extend closely outer edges calzone 50% your bites no cheese  $15  50x better calzone Vegas half price! wouldn't surprised if used 1 4 cup ricotta entire 16 calzone  Very very sad disappointed  more mozzarella sausage ham ricotta  way supposed done boys  Did mention dough thick soft airy dough sponge crisp all?  Then came cannoli   Oy! picked already knew wrong  weighed almost nothing    Meaning no filling  probably 6 7 long but filling extending 1 1 5 both sides leaving entire middle empty  filling tasted old if sitting while  shell tasted stale hard  worth $1 let alone $4  I must mention NYC high standard pizza calzone Italian food  living LV tend give places break    aware NY  said several experiences pizzerias I'd put against some NY pizzerias heartbeat  I'd rather DiGiorno Hot Pockets   For amount money threw away ordering place could've gotten much better meal elsewhere without having pick apart food   Not only did lose $50 also lost respect myself didn't call them ask immediately refund! said someone cooked living worked pizzerias take lot pride send guests  If wouldn't eat doesn't leave kitchen  If guests unhappy take very personally  hope manager and or owner does well  <EOR> Decided delivery today usual place added almost $6 extra delivery   Found place liked extensive menu options since wanted bit everything   ordered mushroom pizza wings philly steak everything   really loved crust pizza chewy flavorful  Lots cheese mushrooms   Wings sauced good arrived almost hot eat right away   Homemade ranch plus   Philly very tasty   seen complaints other reviewers enough meat but ours good lots peppers onions mushrooms cheese  Definitely order again   Hopefully pasta items just tasty  <EOR> Loved wings!
