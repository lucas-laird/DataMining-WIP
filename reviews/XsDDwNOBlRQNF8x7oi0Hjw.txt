I didn't it  Some items soggy some over spiced  couldn't finish it  <EOR> The place looked haunted but absolutely loved food  lamb ate amazing fresh   girlfriend liked vegetarian food well  Lastly girl works very nice generous food more sufficient  <EOR> Most excellent crazy inexpensive Ethiopian food very unassuming environment   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! <EOR> I loved food prices  owner very friendly  supper lighting very low  did St George beer Ethiopia but more interested food dissapointed <EOR> always 100% hospitality no matter busy owner come check <EOR> this place great customer service only food amazing but great price even much left overs  <EOR> Ok place seriously tasty  wasn't expecting much near hotel strip mall restaurant smelled strong incense  But food really good great vegan selections  much able eat lunch two days row in restaurant once leftovers   Even leftovers drew jealous stares other conference goers So delicious decently priced much food get  Just look past exterior sit far incense  <EOR> Funny little hole wall but food authentic delicious!!!   Great prices! <EOR> Great food  Great service above beyond service     food great  lamb loved it  know place looks sketchy but such good food  <EOR> Amazing Ethiopian food coffee  Chef came several times making sure everything ok  Asked Ethiopian cheese he didn't charge it  He amazing host lovely radiant smile  defiantly visit again  Price great! <EOR> I absolutely LOVE Ethiopian food! something seasoning  addictive injera amazing! Having best friend  Ethiopian tried lot different restaurants including other cities  Typically I'd Tibs Kitfo  but lately kick vegetarian sampler  first time only tried sampler  interesting thing never know you'll change samplers often  restaurant three bean dishes collard greens cabbage potatoes sorry don't know names specifically listed menu   All really tasty! definitely come again  if you're fan Ethiopian vegetarian food give place try!   The only draw back location! area pretty sketchy careful  Also restaurant little dark dimly light which isn't inviting  recommend order did  <EOR> Delish appetizing!   Don't fooled area exterior!  Restaurant com only 1 Ethiopian restaurant listed weren't disappointed served  Its always positive when obvious occurring Ex Ethiopians eating drinking Ethiopian restaurant Enjoyed curried lamb vegetarian delight beef tibs w Doro wat   it all good spicy   lamb far favorite all dishes tried because well seasoned was  Now con They recently bought should more handful menus large party  Also requested everything served separate bowls instead served 1 large platter  Overall food quite good  <EOR> Food good   didn't honor restaurant com coupon but food super cheap  Avg entree price under 10 bucks  Service ok weak English  <EOR> I July 2015 came group friends  ordered bruschetta sp? something somosa appetizers  flavorful freshly made  entree order some sort combo beef lamb chicken  food eaten your hands community style  Very interesting fun!   We all over stuffed ourselves because good! couldn't stop eating! food seasoned well quality ingredients excellent  top awesome food awesome service! Everyone very friendly made sure all water extra bread needed meal  Coming experience I'd recommend come too! <EOR> Definitely fancy place place would ambiance decor     BUT if just want delicious high quality Ethiopian food very reasonable prices place go   I came Thursday evening aside couple people came food to go think only customer aside am guessing friends family restaurant owners  CNN giant TV main dining room which fine catching recent events while traveling  looks interior restaurant hasn't updated many years but least looked clean   Knowing usually vegan options traditional injera usually gluten free felt comfortable ordering Shiro  delicious!  The default water option bottled water which $1  Is Las Vegas tap water clean? comes glass ice which guessing made tap water     confused  Whatever   My server nice though maybe most attentive  took time eating but she didn't really come check bringing food wave over I'd sitting while ask box rest food go  For single order there's more enough food two very filling meals  <EOR> I always love hole wall spots bc always great quality if food experience    We ordered 4 meat combo goat chicken lamb beef vegetables lentils  Both grub real good esp spa day which did still walked away leftovers  Very delicious! only meat did much beef which tender beef goat which bit chewy    The vegetables tasty best lamb stew!!!   Customer service great! Two people checked several times    Great quality food attentive customer service quiet place enjoy nice meal  <EOR>
