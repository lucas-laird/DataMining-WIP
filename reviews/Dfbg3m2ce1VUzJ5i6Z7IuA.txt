Why four stars?  kind hole wall might just food next time   Limited seating including couple picnic tables   dancing chair leg three inches shorter others nearly biffed couple times   Shouldn't drinking guess   The service very good other food saw looked great   Give shot! <EOR> I stopped Desnudo while home visiting am almost sorry did  Because now all wish those tacos somehow teleported across state lines  Why can't modern technology keep needs?  This most unpretentious restaurant you'll probably eat Vegas it literal hole wall pretty limited seating fun decor TV those socially awkward folks watch screen while dining others  don't here you're gonna want focus food  Note parking lot small hot mess situation if you're coming during high traffic times prepared almost backed into almost hit someone coming around blind corner several times enter exit   The menu isn't extensive afford be  Tacos specialty obviously but also tortas burritos chips+salsa etc  Again limited menu but won't need look far find something good  chivo goat hongo mushroom tacos combo came rice beans  judge any place serves Mexican food beans if beans bad well then might well close shop  Desnudo beans right  rice too  probably shouldn't eaten much beans rice did but couldn't stop! tacos fantastic hard say better other since meat other basically vegetarian loved both equally  skeptical mushroom taco as am any vegetarian anything mushrooms often used lame vegetarian substitute meat dishes often terrible  Desnudo did great job just letting mushrooms mushrooms really capitalizing flavor  Didn't miss meat these! goat taco didn't skimp meat wow FLAVOR! fresh bright toppings offset richness meat just making well balanced bite every time  guess only ding meat could shredded better some larger pieces made eating kind unattractive but honestly good almost didn't care    The service really great waiter friendly attentive never felt rushed the place starting fill left   such extensive list places visit whenever home visiting Desnudo's added list! <EOR> Desnudo tacos tacos naked your ordinary taco shop don't rely solely grease flavorful tacos actually use some kind Aztec Mayan magic create some best tasting tacos side I 15 Vegas  With tacos ordered some sides fideo soup which really good alittle bit salty side but good nonetheless  garlic rice was   we'll garlicky beans where good could just eat bowl them itself  meat tacos juicy tender topped real Mexican cheese added some real good homemade Mexican salsa which many heat levels nicely supplied bottles instead common little salsa bowls   also your basic traditional taco shop actually sit down restaurant where bring menu through all blah blah restaurant stuff although service more awesome reason usually taco places quick fast food style service but if going take full service route then should least serve complimentary chips salsa  next time stop sure more enough time enjoy nicely decorated room dia de lo muertos style listen Mexican alternative rock style music    No shirt no shoes no service      But desnudo  <EOR> Way Desnudo Tacos!

The decor vibe awesome staff super friendly food really good!   I mushroom tacos loved them!   They few things but well back sure! <EOR> Not exactly cheap food but most part you'll pay for  Pretty awesome 'Surf Turf' burrito ton shrimp carne asada guacamole few bonus french fries burrito trademark SoCal texture  burrito big sit end its own fat cat  Delicious  All lunch money $14 but delicious nonetheless!  The star Desnudo salsa show homemade habanero salsa hot refreshingly flavorful easily used 1 3 bottle food  Don't let orange appearance scare trying really hot  ceviche looked fantastic dudes next big portion too   Diet Coke burrito two tacos = $25 + tip you're looking $30 meal  If half I'd probably want eat least once week  But unfortunately neighborhood SUCKS Arville between Sahara Desert Inn admit part wondering if wheels Jeep would still meal done  Kids neighborhood no problem throwing landscaping rocks moving cars yes happened us parents defend them  You've warned!  Desnudo's front doors propped wide open result more few house flies divebombing food plates  Swatting flies during your restaurant meal awesome  Maybe if rock throwing kids wouldn't litter Arville much wouldn't such swarms flies?
