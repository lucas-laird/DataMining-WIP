You're Asian restaurant no service period  sure people working friendly though   The restaurant cleanest nicely decorated Vietnamese restaurants Vegas but all superficial stuff when can't deliver good Pho  <EOR> Pho phantastic!  Thrilled found place adding list favorite Vegas restaurants  <EOR> My first review Vegas resident   I wish writing happier review   no idea place received 4 stars   doesn't bode well other Asian restaurants Vegas  Hubby ordered  pho vermicelli noodles bun    disappointment   pho broth tasted missing some key ingredients   it bland   bun same   and really skimp meat noodles   Without meat noodles really paying for?  bowl lettuce?  bit expensive just lettuce     Very disappointing   Hubby said he would give 1 star   guess tend more lenient reviewer   Next time we'd rather drive twice distance some good food won't leave disappointed  <EOR> Needed something near Rainbow 215 found place yelp   decided try wife buddy grew San Fran       1   Ambiance Kinda very casual simple plenty tables   2   Service around 11 30 lunch only few people very easy casual service  did lot suggestions menu even though asked however service okay no issues all   would say just casual   liked fact let stay long wanted without pushing bill us   3   Menu Huge selection rice dishes meat dishes Pho table barbecue well   want come back table barbecue looks really good  Chicken Meat dishes friend ordered grilled chicken quite large serving hungry when ordering meat dishes  Pho No number system let's face cannot pronounce language very well point shoot best way go   Pho Beef Combo all beefy stuff tendons brisket it  ordered large wow very large   soup okay put lot spice some flavor   put heck alot noodles however mine bit clumpy while taste noodle good found fact clumpy weird best  Since texture important taste would say Pho greatest however again try better idea  Table barbecue am going back try friends seems really nice way hang friends   Even though haven't tried yet am excited so!!!  4   Price No bad  Everything just under 10 00 slightly over  table bbq meats seafood just under 20 00 plate meat   5   keep updated return visit  However am interested enough try place again    My suggestion also Bosa 1 Jones Spring Mountain when busy time see service different where explaining things letting try things helping your culinary experience!  GK says    Check out! <EOR> Craving pho but wanting drive down Spring Mountain finally gave Bamboo Bistro try   place come highly rated quite few people pretty excited     * Pho Beef Combination slices rare beef cooked brisket beef ball Medium $6 50 first thing noticed when bowl placed front small was   bowl average size but portion inside bowl looked bit disappointing   looked Husband he thinking same thing   When started stir noodles around stuck together big clump   good   also took bit longer order pho come feeling noodles sitting bowl long before brought me   broth smelled great but tasted average   wasn't much meat order either   Sure medium large x large family sizes available but usually pretty content smallest size offered Vietnamese restaurants   * Grilled Chicken Marinated then grilled  $8 50 Husband couldn't decide between Chicken Basil Sauce Lemongrass Chicken  The Golden Baked Chicken unavailable evening  table next door Grilled Chicken waiter owner? suggested better choice over three   came side salad rice dipping sauce   Husband said tasted he expected appreciated wasn't dry   Overall bit disappointed first experience Bamboo Bistro   Pho isn't known mistake ordering it   Next time try Beef Carpaccio House Specials 7 Courses Beef   With looked husband wife team running floor efficient friendly   Mostly families dining Wednesday night sure they'd higher stars once try other offerings  <EOR> Got vermicelli noodles! delicious!
