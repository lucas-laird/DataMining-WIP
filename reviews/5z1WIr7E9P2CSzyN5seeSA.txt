We reservations 10 30am but little early   asked players card don't one   seated main restaurant it wasn't very full time waiter came over   waiter very friendly super helpful   He quick service removal plates lot!      The food varied used buffet which think actually liked   meant stuff did did well   omelets wonderful big   filet mignon superb fruit super fresh   wasn't big fan lobster tails much rest   crab however YUMMY!!!!  also big fan mini belgian waffles     All all fabulous brunch   left stuffed didn't eat again until 4 5pm   would definitely recommend going earlier begun pick seating non members other restaurant  <EOR> Finally made it    been wanting try Sterling Brunch many years now  saw travel channel never chance till now  Glad did!  First off location great really nice well done room  Food all located small room side  Service great waiter definitely kept champagne glasses full    Bloody Mary bar awesome choices things add your Mary but mix left tons desired couldn't even finish it   Now food  Popovers awesome lobster very food caviar solid great but still good enough back multiple helpings waffles very nice signature omelette awesome bread pudding awesome filet well fair would nice   dry overlooked pork belly style fan smoked pork belly  Sushi impressive same buffet Quality see elsewhere dessert    exception chocolate covered strawberries everything tasted commercially made    Overall pretty great meal I'd back  Maybe soon   but absolutely again  <EOR> Best Brunch town!  Every time quality food service atmosphere top notch  <EOR> The Sterling Buffet Brunch only happens once week Sundays BLT Steakhouse inside Bally's    actually remodeled    past buffet crammed into center bar but now expanded serving line    much more spacious    still dark inside restaurant but bad before     Food very high quality    There's endless Perrier Jouet champagne fresh squeezed OJ combine delicious mimosas    server bring freshly baked cheese popovers which fantastically well lobster bisque    Might want inhale whole gigantic puff though!  Otherwise won't enough stomach real estate all other tasty offerings     You made to order lobster ham omelettes    chose lobster filet prosciutto eggs Benedict    course lobster tails prime rib Alaskan crab legs caviar     sure save some space dessert!     This actually best buffets Las Vegas    Minus star because obnoxious server    He thought he being funny humorous but quite opposite    He came across lazy surly    bad because otherwise very enjoyable meal  <EOR> To completely honest Buzzfeed brought here  We even same servers featured video Reservations made three months advance group four which kind unheard buffet but when you're only open day week identify best buffet Las Vegas bound peak your interest right?  With being said would give Sterling firm B overall  surprised Sterling did location own instead occupies Bally's BLT Steak Sunday mornings nor really expecting smaller dimly lit ambiance your standard buffet aesthetic  But service  undeniably impeccable Roxanne most attentive personable waitress ever buffet  She always every sip Perrier kind enough offer advice favorite buffet items  Foodwise though would say Sterling did completely dazzle me while food pretty well cooked menu exponentially smaller expected $99 seat  Rather describing buffet felt more pre set plated brunch made 50 people time  also felt constantly waiting food reset rather immediately picking items plate  end though still content experience perhaps expectations just set high  Worth wise would suggest Bacchanal Wicked Spoon half rate   If curious try though would definitely Sterling least once because lobster ravioli mouth watering popovers very unforgettable  <EOR> The filet mignon delish  However lobster over cooked tuff eat  crab legs hard crack rubbery  @$105 00 person expected lot better  Very disappointed   worth money  Service great though!  I won't going back   Call manager today 4 29 18 didn't seem care when d concern buffet  John R pretty sad when want your money  foodie fest Sunset Station ate lobster off food truck $18  wayyyyy better Brunch  Save your money don't go! <EOR> Came specifically because lobster  Unfortunately dry tasteless which should anticipated knowing Australian lobster tails rather much sweeter maine lobster  Maine lobster would worth almost $100 price tag rest buffet best 3 1 2 stars  Didn't see caviar hiding due cost  Due price value overall only gets 3 stars  However if all drink champagne which loved younger years gets all 5 stars along 5 star hangover   Update just renovated restaurant even changed name  retry updated version sterling buffet very soon update review  <EOR> Not worth price selection very small compare others   other review save your money elsewhere   Lobster over cook somewhat dry   No carving Station dessert station very little pick from  <EOR> The server attentive  seated 2 minutes later she came took drink order   The food options significant  Half dozen different types potatoes au gratin hash browns breakfast potatoes fingerling potatoes lots meats kielbasa ham corned beef hash pork belly sausage crepes piles danishes  also quiche chorizo fresh fruit even some smoked fish  Everything tried delicious  Nothing greasy nothing undercooked even asparagus fresh   If can't find something you're doing wrong  <EOR> Mediocre Bachannal Buffet 10x better  The food terrible price service amazing  Wouldn't come back all big waste $95 opinion  <EOR> I've anticipated coming over year  Overall think worth while visit but definitely place would visit regularly  seemed many other guests celebrating special occasions which sense because buffet does stand out  many thoughts experience both good bad thought just lay out    Positives  + Champagne served while you're waiting seated  + High end menu selection found other buffets unlimited lobster caviar  those where you're rationed  Lobsters full size langostino variety   + High quality food large shrimp cocktail jumbo king crab legs fresh raw oyster ripe fresh fruit  + Service high touch attentive service beverages refilled immediately  Napkins refolded every time left table replaced when dirty    Negatives Broiled lobster over done thus tough Kind crab leg wasn't halved crack legs  easy given pointy spines buttery sauce coating legs   1 leg gave up  Maybe objective  $85 + tax tip  faint heart Dessert selection OK Ambiance stuffy dark old school steak house ambiance  Would preferred light airy venue given Sunday brunch Only offered Sundays  best day given already gorged ourselves whole weekend wants stuffed right before jump plane car  LV LA traffic pretty much guarantees you'll sitting middle time you're done  <EOR> I gave Bacchanal Buffet 3 stars Wicked Spoon 2 stars but Sterling Brunch despite its doubled price well worth 4 stars  hit misses terms food but service unlimited pours Perrier Jouët Grand Brut champagne made favorite buffet strip    Pros  Perrier Jouët Grand Brut Champagne part buffet indulge unlimited serving Perrier Jouët champagne which reasons why would return  If haven't sipped champagne crisp but dry fruity undertones mild citrus finish  Every 5 10 minutes could hear bottles popping because pouring bottle if water  Despite being pricier buffet option compared rest money well spent if unlimited pours good champagne    Service Another reason why would return spectacular service  server Javier he most attentive warming personality  early breakfast 10am he's type gentlemen you'd want encounter start your day  there's no better way show your appreciation tipping your servers well Javier informative being first time made sure glasses always full made sure he received generous cash tip service  other servers including chefs behind counter also attentive friendly likable charm  Even hostesses super polite welcoming unlike other hostesses strip come off cranky    Food always prefer quality over quantity but  rare buffets but Sterling's Brunch find better quality meats seafood made care  Even though limited amount selections overall taste more enjoyable  Some favorites include following The filet mignon which did appear dry actually tender full its natural juices  The popovers which may think waste because purely carbs light buttery bring fresh ones your table seated  actually ripped piece popover served along side salmon lox caviar mini yourself sandwich bite  The lobster egg benedict which order your servers beautifully crafted together tastier chunks lobster soft buttery biscuit egg oozing cut into half  recommend sharing your table first before order more since biscuit filling  Banana Bread pudding something would normally skip buffet because filling but caramel sauce bread pudding amazing  The passionfruit crepe which brought surprise along lovely Happy Birthday song freshly made  passionfruit sauce nice tart flavor  The dessert bar small but good selection sweets choose from  Also liked smaller bite sized could sample more    Cons  Lobster fair lobster dishes Joël Robuchon night before higher expectation lobster terms taste  lobster also appear pacific lobsters taste isn't buttery but overall lobsters overcooked thus leading rubbery taste  Even though lobster disappointment snow crab legs delicious    Hours Operation boyfriend extended trip just could attend Sterling Brunch which ONLY offered Sundays 9 30am 2 30pm  could never reservations since Vegas Sunday  highly recommend making reservations soon since open day week  boyfriend attempted reservations 3 months ahead wasn't able table but snatched cancellation last minute  <EOR> Had excruciatingly difficult time finding place just know no sign says Sterling Brunch but rather inside restaurant called BLT Steakhouse  thought people starting mess when asked where place kept saying back casino right   Seriously best buffet you'll find strip probably good lot them  Yes steep price probably spend $105+ pp but won't find nearly freshest oysters stone crabs lobster tails anywhere else  probably ate whole lineage lobsters visit all nice juicy I think friend rubbery tail but we'll let slide   wide selection other items available brunch caviar sushi prime rib etc  LOVED ALL  also order eggs benedict steak prosciutto lobster  hollandaise sauce amazing! All while treated unlimited champagne  stuffed myself much didn't quite dessert but again display beautiful  sure tasted great   I'm ready back time sweat pants! <EOR> Good Brunch expensive but good We Sunday Brunch Bally's April good  If 2 things 1 reservation 2 Ask seated area where Jason waiter  waiter best even close  Jason take care you   The brunch does fresh caviar sushi King crab legs lobster  ask Caviar Sushi  won't bring automatically  Try champagne lots it  french champagne GOOD stuff  must drank least 2 bottles champagne while there  came stuffed buzzed exactly wanted to   I would reccomend doing just time   just say you've done it  <EOR> Right now you're asking yourself if want pay $85 + tip brunch Vegas  really worth it?  Yes   Yes is  <EOR> The service great food good but nothing fancy  think price high because all eat lobster tail  If main lobster cheap amazing  champagne unlimited  best part liked dessert omelet bread really good  price quality nothing would expect  <EOR> Outstanding brunch! Quantity items small but everything cooked perfectly  Best lobster ever tender delicious prime rib  Excellent champagne hardly finished glass before immediately refilled  Service wonderful well worth cost  selection quality desserts great  <EOR> Ok finally Sterling Brunch today even though very hungry flight LA 5h delayed 11pm yesterday didn't eat anything since couldn't even eat close much expected do    My tally 2x Lobster Tails 2x American Caviar 2x Lamb 1x Mashed Potato 1x Prime Rib 3x Small FM Skillet 1x Lobster Ravioli 2x Lobster Bisque some King Crab some Shrimp cocktail sauce    Thinking actually bit more thought was  Anyway total 95$++ 102$ incl tax plus 15$ tip  Service nice all around  fun once experience least once but think price tag I'd 2x Bacchanal    I don't think expensive though because items all well done high quality  I'd rated five stars but tiny sparse dessert section bit disappointing 4 5  thing bit off don't enforce hint dress code  If waiters elegant uniforms pride yourself serving best brunch town then don't let people muscle shirts rocker type come ask folks least wear T shirt Polo whatever look civilized such venue  <EOR> Today 1st experience Sterling Brunch Bally's Las Vegas  loved ambiance when arrived lights dim Perfect setting! buffet items included Lobster Tail Prime Rib Sushi Shrimp  Warren Manager welcoming friendly hospitable!

I made 12p reservation month advance then reconfirmed morning brunch Sunday 12 23    When called representative some difficulty finding but eventually did saying made old system  When arrived 11 46am madhouse people everywhere!  waited line hostess check in  She seemed flustered thick accent   She seemed some difficulty finding reservation but said she would 25 30 min wait   Given number people milling wasn't surprised but tiny bit annoyed what's point making reservation then?   Moreover system used archaic  wrote down your name onto slip paper tried keep slips some semblance order but still separating using Groupon those paying full price Groupon holders seated full price patrons   walk bar where could free included bloody mary but didn't want spoil appetite    After 40 min check seating status  noticed slip hostess stand she said 3 people ahead us noting people whose slips sitting stand next   said okay  4 other parties seated back stand noticing slip no longer there  asked happened she said seater must taken it  waited seater returned no slips hand  asked again going because slip stand due next no longer there  hostess found it now MIDDLE pile slips hand no longer stand  angrily asked happened because 10 min ago stand  She initially argued but saw angry deterred told seater ahead give table    After bit upset flustered but determined let ruin meal   waiter very charming never let Champagne glass lower 1 2 full  Fresh squeezed OJ also served but those tiny juice glasses ask refills fairly often  also Sprite   Now off food   sampled almost everything 3 lobster tails 2 lamb chops salmon shrimp crab pastry red snapper fillet mignon made order lobster omelette bacon mini quiche mini Belgium waffle  husband also sampled turkey potatoes prime rib   found everything pretty tasty although lobster could used some seasoning  full attempt steamed shrimp raw oysters caviar  most enjoyed omelette waffle course lobster   For dessert made order crepe bananas grand marnier whipped cream  simply delicious!    All all good experience minus debacle front house no major complaints but wasn't all I'd expected  selection definitely better Wynn M Wicked Spoon for half cost if looking ambiance PLUS delicious food experience at slightly lower price point Groupon notwithstanding I'd suggest Jazz Brunch Country Club Wynn   glad visited Sterling Brunch but won't repeat customer  <EOR> Fun experience   Semi buffet la carte   liked because choices fewer but quality better   Lots seafood nice service   Only thing didn't lamb very low grade but other happy  <EOR> Had great time Sterling brunch located BLT steakhouse Bally's  brunch only available Sundays usually requires reservation  think buffet most expensive Strip good reason  unlimited lobster caviar Perrier Jouet champagne filet mignon crab legs much more   I say way smaller most buffets used but quality size  Everything very filling still wasn't able try lot food there    My favorite things prime rib rack lamb lobster bisque caviar lobster  filet mignon super tender perfectly cooked but very flavorful  plenty sauces including chimichurri sauce happy combo  also omelet bar option add lobster too!   Other things didn't try sushi roasted halibut biscuits gravy salad most desserts  tried few tarts chocolate lollipop just ok didn't really eat much else since stuffed  really didn't oysters I'd stay away those next time  Overall you'll brunch if you're really into expensive items sweating price  Otherwise I'd personally prefer more variety cheaper  <EOR> Great food  lobsters moist tender caviar always fresh  champagne never ending overall ambiance ok  bit stuffy but if you're whole time 8 2 then $80 totally worth it  <EOR> I came Sunday morning reservation Caesar's event  located BLT steakhouse Bally's right escalator food court  brunch buffet tier its own  serve all eat caviar lobster tail filet mignon lamb chop oysters  extravagance buffet something I'd never before  almost hundred dollars meal definitely worth if you're hungry enough  all drink champagne bloody mary bar sufficiently buzzed well if you're inclined drink alcohol Sunday morning! <EOR> I'll keep short sweet   think problem fabulous reviews saw fact booked 3 months long time anticipate brunch    able reservation during March Madness when friends town   Everybody excited   All food good some things really good but nothing blew away   big problem limited selection no salad bar limited desserts just enough variety   If price 50 60 would worth but few reviews mentioned worth $100 actually $135 taxes gratuity   doubt back  <EOR> Recently Remodeled    Through transition space Bally's Steakhouse BLT Steak beloved weekend brunch made triumphant return  features same excellence service fare but more modern stylish presentation synonymous BLT Steak  Sterling Brunch offered every Sunday morning showcased sleek built in buffet space roll top chafers   As soon sit down dine Perrier Jouet champagne poured     <EOR> I booked buffet 3 months advance let's just say some pretty high expectations  champagne good never saw bottom glass  strictly stuck seafood oysters decent yes lobster tails weren't perfectly prepared but considering all you can eat still worth lol  Overall would say definitely worth money would return next time visit Vegas  <EOR> Great food selection excellent service   If you're VIP don't wait   High quality Pierre Jout Champagne  <EOR> Definitely best buffet Las Vegas   2 biggest downfall price only Sundays   If don't mind price best place fancy date  <EOR> Price Increase   95 washingtons NO discount total rewards   1  No signs  No apology when asked why no signs  Walked past several times   2   especially nice room   Waiting area if full small scarce  3  No greeting being seated  No explanation procedure just waiter pouring champagne  Didn't speak take drink order OJ coffee  4  Limited food assortment  Maybe 40 feet long   5   Sushi grocery store quality   6  Lobster tails looked good but didn't taste very good   only even though reason came there  Lobster omelet very good but worth price  Chicken good but just type offered  Deserts limited but berries cream great  Loved turnover  Best part meal 3 dollar piece bread   7  Hard check   8  EXPENSIVE poor value  If lobster tail better would added star   9  Did mention bad sushi?

The food itself honestly hit miss  stations themselves small stature but did its highlights all fairness  effort feel bourgeois sampled American Sturgeon Caviar just leave society's elite  came off very salty taste but googling apparently  particular supposed if  case count out! famed lobster tails another excitement fallen flat  housed larger serving dish honestly mass produced feeling me  tasted far fresh some rubbery yet others charmin soft MASSIVE let down! bright note LOVED filet mignon  helping helping became go to day  meat pull away tender hint garlic butter smothered into each bite which tres magnifique! Another highlight which proves bad experience is Greek yogurt parfait  even said wife spent all money liked parfait all things  yogurt itself did tartness Greek yogurt seems which refreshing granola partnered berries least brought smile back meal   As see many pictures taken food mentioned review but sum 1000 words would enough  nice experience?

Caviar top prime rib? Caviar top some macaroons? Why not!  The jumbo shrimp served unusually good quality buffet normal mushy shrimp find lesser buffets    An impressive antipasto section  Lots ways customize food various sauces   For beef lamb lovers covered very high quality cuts   Their sushi selection would say disappointment  seemed rather sloppily presented interesting  But million all eat sushi joints days really wasn't sushi anyway   Likewise dessert selection only okay  could more selection interest there  wasn't even ice cream gelato  if you're big dessert your buffet might put out   But if want eat lot top notch proteins happy glutton  <EOR> Where start  treat fiancee birthday  She loves crab lobster when saw menu knew come here  made reservations 11 am but right opened  accommodated no problem  table otherwise upscale restaurant  service fantastic champagne never fell below 3 4 full glass  food great  girl loaded meal 2 lobster tails 3 plates crab legs fillet mignon some shrimp  some Prime rib mashed potatoes Lobster ravioli food great atmosphere superb service fantastic  While really liked Brunch didn't love it  fiancee did but didn't why only 4 stars five  <EOR> Seriously enjoyed time sterling brunch!

First all blue points cheapest most common oysters shipped Atlantic east coast!   Second all freshly shucked  must shucked long before then refrigerated  time put juices oysters dried meat stuck shells  literally tasted old salty chewing gum crud layer jello slime left dried juices  frozen oysters tasted better  don't know wtf did oysters them all dried gummy that  travesty serve oysters this!!  Oh yeah there's caviar? Umm   more old fishy tapioca balls  Stay away    Sushi rice heavy also dried up   The other seafood crab claws crab legs shrimp  pretty average stuff MANY other buffets restaurants 1 3 buffet price Vegas no need come here  crab claws stone crab claws nor rock crab claws but jonah crab claws cheapest kind  taste sweet rock stone crab claws  Plus being previously frozen even tasted more bitter meat soggy watery if fresh   The fillet mignon cooked very well burnt!! hell cooks fillet mignon well done???  The dessert pastry bar only thing tasted good chocolate used good quality  Selection limited however bartender said dessert area used 3 times big used custom crepe stations   only thing really liked chocolate covered strawberries but everyone else wanted them didn't refill them fast enough  fresh berries general really good but why hell would spent $95 eat berries  buy 7 pounds worth ORGANIC blue raspberries whole foods same price  fresh asparagus spears grilled very well but again don't spend $95 just eat fresh produce literally ONLY non frozen stuff buffet    The only saving grace meal bartender tall black gentleman didn't name   sat bar he kept endless champagne flowing topping glass even before half empty   $125 tax tip they don't total rewards discount anymore ! If big champagne person then buffet might worth it  Please love God DO  NOT  come seafood  love seafood seafood made want throw because fresh is  Please don't pay $100+ eat old seafood   If want excellent FRESH seafood steaks would recommend Joe's Seafood Caesar's Palace  You'll end paying same but won't leave hating yourself trying stuff your stomach crappy food your money's worth  <EOR> I saving brunch something special when birthday rolled around first choice  honestly say disappointed  champagne good food ok service great  All all decent worth price don't really think desire back  better brunch town  <EOR> Food choice much  Taste good  king crab taste simply  Lobster fine  very recommended chinese want perfect complete buffet  But service okey  <EOR> 4 5 stars   Was LV during CES weekend   Thought place would packed made reservation 9 30AM   Surprisingly place never full   Would say 1 4 tables still empty when left around noon   Took time stuffing faces washing things down w champagne!  A credit card required when made reservation   informed penalty would charged card if cancellations made before 3 00PM Sat if no show   Didn't ask much penalty would be   Thought kinda weird never experienced w any other restaurants   mean    they'd refuse walk ins      Anyways took hotel reception's problem money hungry cuz recession!? nothing restaurant   The PRO's SERVICE!  Waiter made emperor!!  Never ask refills water oj nor champagne   waiter would pull chairs every time made back table w dirty plates gone course  LAMB CHOPS!  fav red meat meal   Medium med  rare   Mint jellies side  Perfecto KING CRAB LEGS!  I'd take steaming hot legs over cold ones anytime!  No fuss butter cooling clumping halfway   Props waiter actually cracking each every leg wrapped towel handle table knife! LOBSTER TAILS!  others said only grab when its fresh!  Overcooked rubbery chewiness no no! CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRIES!  HUGE!  mean MONSTROUS strawberries + chocolate   Nuff said!?  The SOSO's CAVIER   Only sevruga cavier   small black roes   Cheaper most abundant type there   Although fresh  FRUITS   Think could ed notch here   There's definitely more variety other buffets but quality just wasn't there   Sliced dragon fruits tasteless papaya canned lychee addition usual buffet bunch didn't quite fruits exotic either which waiter proclaimed them be   Having figs plus imo though   The CON's PRIME RIB   No lips any 3 roasts had!   having fried chicken w o skin!! Other reviewers' pix some better ones   Bad batch roasts guess   Choice grade best  NO CRACKERS   enjoy cheese w crackers   used eating brie straight up   waiter did grab some crackers next door   Nabisco crackers    Thanks but no thanks   Overall service champagne masked all disliking towards place   Would come back only share experience people hasn't here   Otherwise rather drop $85 pop non buffet restaurant  <EOR> Came Sunday Brunch!

Take your pick all you can eat lobster tails !!! jumbo shrimp rack lamb lobster ravioli caviar complete all proper fixings desserts champagne  Located inside restaurant BLT Steak buffet cost pretty penny $99 pp but well worth it   highlights lobster caviar  wasn't sure expect quality since buffet but excellent quality themselves made price worth it  large lobster tails overcooked but sweet tender  caviar good quality fishy overly salty  champagne perrier jouet cheap crap  also served fantastically fluffy popovers  All all gluttonous indulgent must try buffet least once    My only complaint lighting  know located steakhouse thus dimly lit full dark decor mood lighting but super dark dining area    point asked different table could see food better!!

Cheers! However took several attempts orange juice refilled  finally being seated drinks ordered explored supposed star show food! buffet section very   minimal underwhelming  surprised caught off guard small selection offered  But point thought 'Hey maybe quality blow away selection won't even matter '  How wish true  flavors underwhelming  Items such filet cooked unevenly lacked taste cold time reached table  sushi nigiri selection looked seen better days falling apart plates unappealing  Other items included lobster tails crab legs oyster shooters omelets french toast waffles charcuterie etc  idea  dessert station which section bar counter I just can't believe hefty price tag didn't leave amazed wowed  Rather much left desired  hoping fluke  But never know  <EOR> There seems two different experiences most people then friend had  no problem spending money good food drinks but hard pressed spend $85 brunch word buffet it  When Julie K posted talk thread informing Groupon Reserve 2 $99 jumped figuring wouldn't better time try it  Made reservation 10 30 arrived time seated hour later  hour  guess figure time isn't valuable could've slept longer! Finally seated but didn't drink ordered taken another 10 minutes sitting noticing decor felt Cosby Show episode ambiance very strange  80's theme all way  Started station broiled lobster tails seemed look good split half grabbed couple decent but nothing spectacular  skipped carving station huge meat eater can't comment that  entire warming station set catering type deal all food metal flip top fire under neath all food hardened layer top  appetizing all  over sushi station ordered hamachi tako when table noticed hard fish wasn't brave enough try it  caviar scooped bucket type thing gave try but spit out  warm  tried oysters which stacked plate sitting ice again when returned table noticed smelly were  nervous try them  All while barely checked server maybe 3 refills PJ that's basically best part meal far ended eating mostly crab legs few crab claws  desserts comparable Costco tried creme brûlée ehh  gives no pleasure complain entire meal experience but cannot see great experience anyone? tipped full amount still $70 meal  huge disappointment  <EOR> Came second time yesterday  delicious last year when first tried it  lobster tails good lobster bisque  sushi great filet mignon    They must've filled husband's champagne glass 8+ times throughout course brunch he happy camper    The chocolate covered strawberries good well! just wish bigger tummy could've enjoyed more food    I did notice raised price since last ate here  $95 per person now fear if keep raising price may entirely worth it  But $95 person still keen going back  <EOR> The food spectacular!  bit everything everyone   helped myself several plates fresh oysters cracked crab claws both which excellent   Also lobster ravioli best ever anywhere period   even roasted lobster tail which main reasons went   Delicious!  wasn't extremely hungry when but couldn't stop going back plate plate!  desserts awesome some best chocolate covered strawberries ever had    On side note all food available nearly forget caviar!  didn't help don't put all other food but ask person behind buffet line specifically   if plan trying caviar sure forget almost did ask it! <EOR> Is any brunch worth $85? Depends  If meat potatoes person no brunch worth more $20 so   Sterling Brunch among usual mundane brunch items sturgeon caviar lobster tails Chilean sea bass quality prime rib unlimited champagne  Honestly even all $55 better Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch $30? Probably not   Sure caviar server 25 times eat enough sturgeon caviar put dent world's sturgeon population but then broken down brunch experience into economic ROI return investment exercise taken all joy entertainment endeavor   So Sterling Brunch good even somewhat unique but $85 good $55 better Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch which gold standard opinion  But you've invested several days hundreds thousand dollars going Vegas just blew $500 Blackjack table hour what's another $85? <EOR> Finally able try Brunch  wife eaten every Buffet Las Vegas worth eating far best regarding food quality  <EOR> Oh god  came perfect Sunday  First given champagne while waited reservation Maybe 15 mins max wait then food outstanding  3 lobster tails hahah which cooked perfectly prime rib *faints* such good flavor king crab legs hard crack cause sharp spines haha personally would liked them cut half P excellent caviar smoked salmon  Champagne   Service but food point was slightly worried mix reviews but hey sometimes lobster gets over cooked just small amount tough day wasn't   beautiful Rose left    The best buffet ever too  <EOR> Oh Sterling Brunch wanted love but sorely disappointed me    My husband brother in law came Sunday afternoon  showed 10 mins early 1 00PM reservation booked over phone  I recommend calling bc sometimes OpenTable doesn't accurate count reservations available  hostess seated table right 1 00PM which plus  place located Bally's    Now let's talk important parts experience    FOOD   The buffet limited options  tried following 1  Lobster Tail They're big juicy easy eat  entire meal far favorite item enjoy Sterling's  didn't dip butter  recommend topping w caviar instead Yumm!  2  Lobster Bisque bisque creamy but don't let sit long it'll gross  Eat soup right away you'll disappointed it   3  Raw Oysters half shell fresh all weird taste it  Could've season came late good oysters gone  place closes 2 30 pm 4  Lamb Tender flavorful especially when add mint julep jelly top   5  Prime Rib outside salty saltier other steakhouses tried   meat tender   6  King Crab Legs things huge PRICKLY! hard crack meat  Maybe King Crab Leg type gal   7  Cocktail Shrimp Meh  good but nothing special   8  Truffle Mashed Potatoes DELICIOUS! tasted amazing lamb prime rib   9  Caviar Tasty salty well lobster tail bread   10  Filet Mignon butter sauce top meat perfectly cooked  11  Desserts portions great tasting  tried them all  favorite peanut butter one  Sorry can't give more insight desserts!  12  Bottomless mimosas champagne very dry recommend if more sweeter champagne then should mimosas  unlimited OJ other refreshments well  They don't offer Coke only Pepsi  They also served sushi    questionable looked dry  rice packed rolls limited sushi grade fish inside  You're better off saving your stomach better tasting items lobster tail bisque    PRICE   For two people came $200 $40 tip = $240  feel would've happier price known foods eat stay away from  When come sure drink PLENTY WATER drink much champagne w o getting intoxicated  Lobster tail caviar shrimp lamb prime rib FIRST  However food doesn't taste good when cold    I recommend grabbing two three things time then bring back table enjoy while warm  Then another round  Don't grab everything once!

YES DID  Did just pay $75 freaking buffet? YES DID  Did recommendation other Yelpers prior YES DID   Anyway back story Sterling Brunch those hidden gems Vegas lot people know about   occurs only once per week Sunday cleverly hidden inside Steak House those buffet trotting families remain none the wiser   Most customers proudly displayed Britishness thoroughly challenging every normal word while still speaking English proper   As soon walk feel classy place   Maître d' dressed all black tux matching bow tie   came shorts T shirts admittedly overwhelming first   until noticed EVERYONE else casual well  OK now see why SCIZO?    Of course everyone just wants know food   Honestly buffet its pretty good   But LOVED HATED whichever dish got   Encrusted Chillean Sea Bass Caviar Perrier Jouet champagne Crab claws desserts primo books   However found lamb shanks top sirloin strips Alaskan King Crab legs sub par buffet type   sushi much better Makino Decatur don't even bother   worth it?  YES champagne caviar alone justified expense   Oh if haven't tried Nagasaki saki might want give try very drinkable   However remain amused some marketing guy would name drink city bombed intelligent   SERVICE AAA but still your own food remember buffet    did however slight peave ended buffet 2 30 promptly asked leave 4 00 pm   few buddies just looking hang around good conversation but everyone working just wanted end shifts   Completely understandable possibly even fault but did ruin evening nonetheless   forewarned early   VERDICT If ADD personality love caviar champagne put few nuances DEFINITELY experience worth trying     If you've ever spent week gorge fest boat Celebrity Cruise Lines you'll sorely disappointed Sterling Buffet   If think $75 lot money lunch then Wynn buffet    you'll spend half much still think expensive  <EOR> Outstanding Brunch great time   The only limitations those imposed buffet format everything prepared served beautifully   service great   Definitely old school Vegas feel   Something every Vegas fan needs least once   Well worth money  <EOR> We Mother's Day   server very nice kept champagne glasses full   started sharing special omelet lobster boursin cognac   it delicious   Next lobster tail filet caviar   All wonderful   told myself would eat three lobster tails but just try everything full fast   sea bass great surprise  cooked perfectly sauce wonderful   husband doesn't seafood very happy other choices though thought hollandaise eggs benedict much better    croissant french toast die for I'm sure feel tipping stations buffet very expensive itself   tip would lobster filet sides plate them if restaurant   think would enjoyed more eating each little dishes   When left wasn't sure if would again but retrospect think will  <EOR> Without doubt BEST brunch anywhere! Obviously cheap but worth if right things  selections always lobster tails and just one rack lamb caviar shrimp  don't bother fill ins such bread pancakes etc  Lobster tails perfectly cooked seasoned just need dab drawn butter orgasmic experience  Don't bother little tiny cups caviar but instead ask caviar server put nice size dollop your plate  others said restaurant somewhat dated but cares your amazing food! <EOR> Got famous Sterling Brunch check off bucket list  am glad try but don't think I'd back    I couldn't reservation hubby but lucky seated bar without having wait all  service pretty good  Both bartenders working very nice attentive    The food section really small somewhat disappointing  lobsters hit miss  first round two lobsters along caviar crab legs lobster bisque both lobsters cooked just right  Though needed bit seasoning pretty tasty  But third later way overcooked rubbery  Everything else tried also somewhat over cooked except lobster ravioli delicious   For drinks champaign orange juice thinking some mimosa  Unfortunately OJ served wasn't good which kind spoiled it    I don't think  ate money worth food which probably would always case buffets even Sterling Brunch  But experience nice have  <EOR> Only Sundays only Las Vegas find classic! BLT Steakhouse Ballys Hotel Casino taken mantle Las Vegas institution  special occasion experience  Lobster Caviar Crab Leg Top Shelf Champagne much more  Don't forget spectacular extensive Bloody Mary Bar!  suggestion reservations well advance   find excuse buffet least once before die!

A while turned into never  buffet bussers clearing tables she busy she couldn't grab diet coke?  Anyway food okay lobsters good but great prime rib well done even though asked medium medium rare piece filet mignon chewy desserts lacking display looked dirty messy   The best part entire buffet king crab legs husband cracked I don't crab juice all over myself usually opt crab legs meaty fresh! absolutely delicious worth every penny  dare say crab legs better lobster tails!  All all try judge yourself! However don't think worth hype Buzzfeed made sound better really was  <EOR> If you're looking brunch forever endless options it  But quality hear come for   Three different types crab oysters shrimp  Then lobster tails caviar belini set up  Just amazing    There's side section charcuterie grilled vegetable all very good   In addition variety meats   Every section sauces  Minuet cocktail raw  Drawn butter lobster king crab  4 5 sauces carving station     The champagne delicious well    When sit down start hot popover fresh butter   The whole experience great food wonderful if seafood   Unlike other buffets nothing over cooked off temperature    Pricy sure but occasion well worth it  <EOR> Little did know place going cost $85 bucks  going prepared pay $65 70 but $85 bit much definitely worth hence star reduction  Reasons star reduction 1 oysters looked disgusting  yes nice offered would eat ting them up  but look they'd sick didn't look fresh all 2 lobster wasn't coming fast enough  always 10 15 minute wait lobster! which wastes your precious eating time 3 dining room separated  use two restaurants house sterling brunch  steakhouse another restaurant  sat other think Italian  walk pretty far food  quite disappointed this 4 wait 15 minutes reservation when waiting list without 15 20 minutes  whats point reservation? still crappy seat  Why its least 4 stars 1 lobster when actually fab  2 champagne unlimited Delicious  bit slow refills but still nice have  when he did refill he only gave half glass even when asked full glass  thought rude  3 chocolate cover strawberries dessert FAV! 4 lamb good super gamey  5 shrimp cocktail 6 caviar request   overall  feel didn't refill foods fast enough  always wait something setup food made line lobster [at end] block all other foods [crab legs prime rib]  super excited thoroughly disappointed  even desserts weren't refilled quick   not worth $85 bucks I'd again give place second chance if back $65 <EOR> If you're Vegas Sunday count your blessings because means MIGHT opportunity eat here!

Classic!  buffet tucked away Bally's   If haven't tried before should   Yumm!  10 30am Sunday no wait but made reservations advance   When reservations ask your credit card info but won't charge until day brunch  <EOR> After reading reviews made reservation beforehand planned arrive hour before could eat soon possible   Upon arrival no line but hostess seemed if being rude showing hour early reservation   said could seat side overflow section immediately since didn't know any difference agreed     The Food food met most expectations   Luxurious ingredients no limit   lobster tail overcooked but friend said second tail which he picked right when replenished serving tray perfect   made order omelette crepe station    sushi station nice but fish just ok   favorite items shrimp shrimp scampi the pasta over cooked but shrimp plump cooked perfectly lamb chops carving station cavier which decadently ate everything   cold station bit disappointment the stone crab claws good but desserts looked beautiful    The Service 2 waiters section don't think more 5 7 tables filled half room but some reason seems overwhelmed   didn't any attention long time   read constantly refill your drinks service impeccable but sitting good 5 10 minutes empty glasses trying catch eye waiter   sure if because overflow room   noticed other tables baskets bread pastries but never offered any   heard another diner vodka bar somewhere but never offered any   Having paid did expected servers much more attentive all all disappointment     Overall price high buffet  Even though food items all luxury items felt preparation could better   would rather spent money nicer sit down restaurant   all drink good but would better if servers more top it   would maybe try again seating main dining room think service ambiance may better  <EOR> We wish could say we're hip cats always finger pulse Vegas dining scene   could say all Yelp land but we'd lying   We heard Sterling Brunch cheezy Food Network show   know where dopey guy irritating woman looks soccer mom crystal meth travel around eating way into insanity   saw show became brainwashed rest America   We're ashamed admit it   Fortunately though Sterling Brunch turned sweet find   Soccer mom dopey dude really found gem which easy thing Vegas land endless buffets fine food excess   What buffet different?  friend if ask then worthy   We'll let others forum describe food just say quality top notch   The setting space usually occupied steakhouse Bally's   Dark hardwood surrounds waiters tuxedos tend offerings mimosas using good quality champagne cloth napkins   best part brunch irritating hillbilly tourist families usually turned away price $65 per person     right folks!  won't some bratty snot covered 2 year old running down aisles chasing flea infested brother   Nope people actually somewhat presentable   Make sure secure reservations advance walk ins turned away when went   Also Sterling Brunch only happens Sundays you'll mightily disappointed if show door say Tuesday morning looking fine grub   Bring extra stomach wifey take largest purse steal extra food flight home  <EOR> My girlfriend jokingly made reservations two months ago watching Buzzfeed episode it  When weekend reservation came decided just say fuck go  girlfriend ended driving 9 hours round trip day two hour brunch  worth it? Probably driving but great time celebrating 6 month anniversary  Anyways food First champagne guess big fan champagne thought  girlfriend loved though guess everyone else says pretty quality  Orange juice good  Onto food tried little almost everything  isn't huge selection many other reviews noted but when offerings all some most expensive things eat isn't much complain about  seafood offerings wasn't best time year eating oysters lobster but everything still tasted pretty good  shrimp fishy smelling imo oysters weren't great but lobster crab were  lobster sort hit miss terms well cooked rubbery overcooked but overall A+ me  offer pretty wide selection meats well favorites prime rib lamb  While filet mignon only cooked medium I guess just because most people want medium?? which book crime  still good but could much better if medium rare! lamb mint jelly prime rib horseradish both very good though  girlfriend loved salmon chicken dishes well  Some other assorted things pumpkin ravioli fresh fruit caviar desserts  Ravioli good a little rich fruit delicious desserts weren't amazing taste but did look very pretty! first time trying caviar both liked lot haha    Finally service didn't interact much waittress but she very cheerful nice when she came by  Lots good vibes! always topped off champagne never waited long anything  Overall probably won't going back just because $$ but great experience! <EOR> Hands down best brunch ever! Lobster tails perfectly cooked halved nor little  lobsters size wish your surf n turf somewhere else! Oysters half shell delicious truffle infused mash potatoes! loved rack lamb mint jelly could eat all day if could  Everything ate delicious  Even deserts die for! Bottomless champagne need say more? <EOR> It first time service impeccable! hostess Jamielee front friendly  She helpful great happy attitude  able start drinking champagne bar before seated  Perrier Jouet!

We both could only eat 1 plate each drank little champagne  The lobster tails steak good but nothing extraordinary  Plus dessert selection favorite  I Wicked Spoon better  <EOR> Our experience Sterling disappointing  price tag expecting varieties fresh seafood meat dish but all offered several savory options plus made to order egg dishes limited selection desserts  Literally take only 5 seconds walking first dish last dish display counter    Don't wrong serve fancy dishes such lobsters crab claws prime rib but quality does match price tag  lobsters during first two rounds fully cooked told server when he picked dishes he could also see lobster meat transparent cooked   He apologized brought couple lobster pieces without asking Very kind wish remember name! but time lobster overcooked rubbery    We also tried raw oyster half shelves didn't good job opening them because small pieces shell all over oysters  Plus prepared earlier time oysters dry sitting fridge awhile  knew because saw guy behind counter took them fridge refill plate  disappointment     Crab claws good but impossible fail   We enjoy champagne always PJ fans   only good part dining experience    Oh almost forgot mention  staff walked around restaurant give red roses female customer end buffet hour few roses she left hand she chose give  already dead  husband good laugh it  left table next matching look strawberries that freezer burned    Maybe off day but honestly return  plenty choices Vegas  hope better experience us  <EOR> Personally love unlimited lobster tail Champagne but maybe some into don't know      Have book reservation try sit bar  currently two pending reservations next two trips 4 months out  <EOR> So Saturday night decide can't party hard because 11 00 AM reservations Sterling Brunch however 1 sake leads 5 then leads vodka shots end calling night 5 morning    BAD IDEA lol  I really wish wasn't hungover could enjoyed fullest but none less buffet still delicious!   We started seafood which really drew here   oysters fresh shrimp plump crab claws good easy open! smoked salmon delicious   However lobster tad overcooked but nothing little budda budda couldn't  solve   wish sliced open king crab legs since hard crack open  Some pieces little salty side but still good  liked adding big chunks lobster into lobster bisque   If mini sushi bar ask chef some caviar dining partner fellow Yelper Chingoo L really enjoyed caviar even though quite fishy   Well else would expect fish eggs   ? Haha   The stand dish lamb    Omg delicious!!! gamey all little sweet crust it! good!!!!   I feel dessert section impressive   looked better pictures    When standing line creme brûlée chef made fresh man front when front she just pointed chilling there    there's nothing worse creme brûlée soft top    HMPH   As service server very nice sometimes took little long drinks table but he constantly kept champagne flutes filled brim I think best part brunch drinks!

Thanks asking! Checking restaurant pretty swift seated within few minutes  3 stars would expect 3 star restaurant   Food food selection just all other reviews caviar lobster lamb prime rib    Etc  ran oysters when 11 am   However food taste mediocre best  wasn't anything where felt must have  would avoid sushi freshly made didn't look fresh either  4 stars best food selection town prepared gourmet chefs   Service am very particular service but here's felt felt server Jason needed some elegance training courses  When arrived he immediately introduced himself asked if wanted champagne yes!!   ladies food came back then food came back but none drinks here! When he finally returned he did back forth act where he would reach across table pour some each cup while waiting bubbles settle  caused champagne spill each time due lack coordination simply looked bad  back forth thing rest meal  took another 10 minutes clear extra set plate settings table when arrived  bit into dining asked mimosa  He simply took half DRANK orange juice poured into half DRANK champagne    right front me  If restaurant management ever reads this   Please!! Bring customer new glass! also snow crab legs plate full other food some time legs impossible open hand  finished all other food plate finally ASK Jason crab leg cracker    When attempted lamb chef station chef busy chatting another staff member 10 feet station  When he finally turned attention he asked wanted then started chatting another staff member! He finally remembered serve then apologized getting distracted   also happened girlfriend when she tried some lamb   Later girlfriend also saw manager some staff arguing cold selection melting ice? unprofessional! 2 stars service only because 1 star saved mega disaster experience   Overall did meet $85 expectations  Food selection great food quality ok service seriously sucked  <EOR> Date Time Sunday 11am Occasion Sunday Champagne brunch daddy little brother Party of Three Location Inside Sterling Steakhouse   Antiquated decor  Cute little servers running around tuxes   Clean well set food stations  Ordered All eat drink Total incl gratuity $320  After much hype dad finally time way highly acclaimed Sterling Sunday Brunch Bally's   pricetag little high but includes all eat drink champagne   can't drink much only finished off glass champagne  Disappointing   I know!

Seven lobster tails later still stuffing myself soup waffles prime rib etc  The selection fine foods impressive   serve lobster tails mean lobster tails   dinky crawfish mini lobster serve some other buffets   talking roasted chunky delicious lobster tails   What's also brilliant?  serve lobster bisque!  grab lobster tail shred few bites toss into bisque   wonderfully delicious little starter   amount food serve vast however focus quality   well thought course well organized   interior room where house salads fruits cheeses  iced seafood station which included chilled oysters shrimps smoked salmon mussels stone crab claws sturgeon caviar   seriously couldn't enough caviar   delicious   overly salty some previously   must eaten $85 worth alone caviar! In main room find row breakfast foods  Crisp strips bacon eggs benedict freshly prepared Belgian waffles ham sausage omelet station   steered clear breakfast foods fear filling tummy quickly   Opposite breakfast line more heartier items steamed crabs legs yukon gold mashed potatoes steamed carrots haricot verts different chicken beef choices   course buffet would complete without carving stations prime rib turkey lamb?  The mentionable list crab claws lobster tails oysters waffle caviar bacon selection fresh raspberries blueberries   Sweet themselves great throw into your champagne  food deserves four stars service right par four stars well   Service overly intrusive but honest expecting little more type place   couple times glasses left empty until waved someone down   Nonetheless pleased finally try ever famous Ballys Sunday Brunch! <EOR> The food fine but reason 1 star review friend being harassed  caucasian couple  directing racial slurs staring guy even came over point face because piled plate full lobster oysters he took issue it?  The problem lies fact talked servers management did nothing  didn't move them despite requests simply indicated could security involved  didn't want cause any additional headaches simply just left  bill wasn't comped understand unique situation but response management absolutely horrendous should tolerated   Food fine experience not <EOR> Pros Unlimited champagne quality food expensive taste caviar lobster oysters filet mignon Cons small selections barely anything breakfast only offered omelettes potatoes mini waffles I'd suggest wicked spoon instead    food just good if better selection food nearly five times large only quarter cost sterling brunch  <EOR> Three words Quality quantity!  Tried Sterling Brunch during bday weekend blown away!  First off popovers   they're amaze!  include little recipe card take home but think left secret ingredient crack!  server gracious kept repelenishing popovers   But beyond crack popovers buffet excellent!!!  Don't expect long line endless food multiple stations   pretty much just straight shot quality quantity!  lobster tails HUGE self serve if wanted eight your plate I'd give dirty look but don't mind me   Crab claws awesome!  Filet mignon cooked perfectly delicious!  Prime rib probably best ever any Vegas buffet!  Even bacon thick perfectly cooked   Usually I'd avoid eating cheap breakfast food during brunch but really?  resist piece bacon?  They also menu quite few items ranging lobster bisque specialty benes other small plates   takes awhile food come but just patient pace yourself savor food front your dining companions   The service again top notch!  forgot server's name but he very attentive hospitable   The dining area isn't largest most elegant actually kind stale generic if ask me   But food matters!  The price yeah cheap faint heart   Runs $95 per but worth every dollar   #GoodLifeGreatBrunch <EOR> One best buffets ever to!!! does cost $95 per person but very special occasion well worth endless lobster jumbo shrimp king crab legs caviar filet mignon much more  wife really enjoyed salmon beurre blanc  famous popover bread amazing well  definitely treat definitely coming back Just give some time save up <EOR> Passing through Vegas eat again even better last time! switched champagnes didn't recall which brand switched started letter M very helpful know still yummy though  service excellent again server still training but he did mention where caviar time  good doing now    They prepared lobster different time entire tail steamed think felt better bf thought just good    A few other dishes enjoyed which may may change lobster papparadelle giant cocktail shrimp trout peppered salmon lox salmon en croute sushi wasn't bad standard selection sake excellent   the brand Nagasaki clever   Raw oysters didnt care much time didnt raw clams caviar still ok but am still caviar expert    Desserts top notch loved giant chocolate covered strawberries bunch random little cakes truffles well crepe station  worth save little room your tummy sampling coffee included  actually saw another table order bloody marys which also included your limited mimosas if dont care honestly price $85 pp should give whatever want drink   I bit peeved gambling did good roulette table 10% off coupon few restaurants brunch them doesn't discount     I think need cash certain amount over $200 maybe because bf didnt good did coupon   So again buffet might selection other price certainly heftier but quality items its worth splurge check out  <EOR> $90 per person    caviar large lobsters tails king crab legs giant shrimps raw oysters lamb filet mignon lets forget bottomless expensive champagne  try brunch if eat alot above   omelete station order items egg benedict but selection overall pretty small  dessert area tiny well  fantastic service though  place just didn't wow enough come back considering price  Expensive items buffet line but taste lacking i e   lobster meet dry bland oysters weren't fresh shrimp overcooked king crab legs dry etc   <EOR> 3 5 stars   selection limited compared other brunch buffets but all quality here   Tender rib eye steak rock crab claws king crab legs gigantic shrimp cocktail oysters half shell halved lobster tails rack lamb prime rib sushi sea bass roasted asparagus crab cakes mini crab frittata mini cheese plate mini caprese salad mini yogurt granola one bite dessert galore freshly made cheese popovers   order cesar salad caviar lobster bisque tuna tartare through waitstaff   liked savory items more sweet items   Many lobster tails dry popover little doughy side lobster bisque delightful   chocolates dessert bar tasteless fruit flies hovering over goodies   Other important info located BLT Steakhouse inside Bally's $90 per person which includes good champagne and reduced if don't drink alcohol quality over quantity quite tasty well worth if prefer dinner food breakfast lunch  <EOR> My best friend bought groupon brunch excited try out!

Lobster tails halves didn't look nearly appetizing pics I'd seen here  mean lobster getting rubbery sits but still really good  Filets cooked perfectly also braised boneless short ribs which weren't anything special   Chilean sea bass rich sure some jumbo scallops risotto middle  meat ravioli lamb stew seemed place just mediocre  Didn't try prime rib because looked dry  Lamb chops cooked perfectly juicy but weren't slicing them order could tell color outside sliced sat bit  But still delicious w mint jelly   King crab legs warm  Which nice change but also seemed sat chafing dish bit long  legs huge but some really dried out  legs broken off joints but precut  given 1 those nut cracker types table  opener looking crackers would've better choice since theirs just squished legs w actually cracking open anything  waitors also don't seem crack legs read another review  See mean yelp giving preconcieved notions date info? The ice bar usual fare raw oysters didn't try them snow crab claws watery being pre frozen colossal shrimp cocktail  Shrimp huge yummy cocktail sauce could've used more horseradish   I skipped breakfast stuff looked nothing special mini waffles omelette station bacon sausage eggs benedict fritatta  On desserts    think lot pics date don't tall 4 shelf display its cut down 2 shelves  dessert honestly worst part meal   first time ever said buffet  no cakes pies even creme brulee  don't know anything because no signage chef said don't know usually work hot side  just huge disappointment end meal way  try remember worst tapioca pudding ever pearls hard stale mini cream puffs w overly sweet filling blah lemon tart fudge brownie topped w raspberries weird berries clear jelly thing good thing chocolate mousse  seriously all offer  Vegas buffet  pretty pathetic price buffet  joke   Maybe its high expectations affected experience but really disappointed w Sterling buffet overall  may awesome before but unfortunately doesn't seem anymore  I'd suggest going another brunch just dealing w cheaper champagne better yet just buy couple bottles Perrier jouet  Its pretty bad when you're drunk still don't think food amazing  <EOR> There literally nothing bad say Sterling Brunch  First food selection astronomical! ton seafood varieties meats egg dishes french toast veggies salads caviar fruit    and doesn't even cover all dessert options! food itself prepared wonderfully everything tasted decadent fit queen  particularly loved popovers bring your table  Also amazing service  Tony serving section he always made sure champagne glasses filled!

Though any buffet some pieces better others   example first lobster tail near perfectly delicious   second bit mushy i e  very fresh    Also stone crab claws watery tasteless   Tip if try earlier reservation   brunch ends 2 30   saw people 1pm reservations still waiting 1 30 because customers slow give tables   Also sign Total Rewards card any associated hotels discount     Lastly surprised limited selection was   expectations way off thought place offered many variations lobster   Definitely case   Just type lobster tail eggs benedict made order! ravioli   latter contained almost no lobster   Keep mind restaurant full time buffet   Instead steakhouse sets small buffet Sundays  <EOR> I returned five year hiatus enjoyed brunch again   highlight shellfish   loved Australian lobster tails Alaskan King Crab   just realized forgot caviar   Dang!  Champagne excellent   desserts OK but nothing special buffet expensive $90    orange juice disappointment expected fresh squeezed carton   filet joke tiny gristle overcooked   service excellent   All things considered give three stars weighted price charged value received  <EOR> This brunch  cheap but well worth it  Champagne not sparkling wine lobster caviar prime rib lamb made order omelets crepes sushi lots more  Food delicious service great most importantly Champagne glasses never empty  Definitely coming back bringing family when come visit  <EOR> For those living Las Vegas planning trip here would think twice before considering Sterling Brunch Bally's  waiting but expensive far $90 person  many people heard but claimed premier brunch town many years running  Groupon two ahead did holiday weekend  last night  verdict is worth it  lobster cavier crab legs claws rack lamb sushi oysters other dishes  lobster pretty decent rubbery  guess if love cavier would worth it  deserts left much desired well  thought would full wouldn't want anyway  reservation but still waited 45 minutes because Groupon which means didn't rate   Maitre d actually told 4 5 star guests top priority!

Atmosphere existing BLT restaurant yet cool exclusive vibe   $100 man know everyone's coming good time  <EOR> Came expecting more average LV buffet experience wish average LV buffet   horrible but price terrible   Plenty lobster tails dry plenty crab claws watery completely flavorless plenty coffee horrible quality sushi Chinese buffet quality   What disappointment   best thing puff bread served table bread pudding OK   Bloody Mary sucked know what!  Service very iffy flag down guy two three times before could water!!  I rather spend twice much quality half much same elsewhere without lobster   What shame sham  <EOR> I honestly did expect little more quality due lack variety sticker price meal  quality food quite Vegas buffet average   However offer mediocre American caviar still caviar lobster tails bit dry chewy still lobster tails   crab legs lamb chops quite good best items buffet opinion    Their saving grace endless supply Perrier Jouet champagne everything more fun tastier  <EOR> Had brunch husband roommates celebrate roommates new job  great most expensive brunch ever $95 per person exact  looking restaurant said Sterlings Bally's until stopped asked some security guard corrected let know actually BLT steak house !
