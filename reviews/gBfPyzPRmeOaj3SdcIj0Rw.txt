I would recommend Sushi Samba Palazzo over Sushi Roku only because Samba more unique menu imo worth shelling few extra bucks for   But if you're looking more traditional Japanese flavors Roku gives more bang your buck similarly high end setting  <EOR> Always great service good food  great variety raw cooked items  view Ling Hotel strip  <EOR> Dinner absolutely delicious  special 2 rolls  also 2 lychee martinis hit spot  requested table magnificent view agreed smile  definitely dine next trip Vegas  4 stars because price  <EOR> Cute place  interior very upscale intimate  nice place nice romantic dinner love  would suggest request strip view when dinning because strip view just lovely    The menu ok  personally prefer authentic Japanese cuisine local area Spring Mountain! but few things like  signature martinis good! would definitely recommend Lychee martini  big piece Lychee garnish taste Lychee flavor martini  if all nice sweet taste your martini I'd definitely recommend it   Our group ordered Seared Tuna Tataki Seaweed Salad Yellowtail Sashimi Crunchy Spicy Tuna Rock Shrimp Tempura Chicken Yakitori Skewers  nothing special anything stands where feel place might only place satisfy distinct craving  food very light fish fresh portions small    I haven't tried Omakase yet but would actually try once see if worth spending $90 for  Omakase might only thing worth gambling on  All all experience nice service wonderful  If don't mind burning big hole your pocket nice fine dining experience small stomach appetite then would recommend it  <EOR> At lower price point would commanding 4 star restaurant but fails deliver high expectations sets nestled Caesar's Palace $50 person   Sushi solid but nothing your usual local Sushi bar won't offer 12 15 roll  Service somewhat irritating kept coming back often wouldn't let decent conversation   Start edamame try Filet Mignon Asparagus  <EOR> Wonderful sushi creative desserts top off!

P S  all ambiance understand sushi restaurant saying quality over quantity taken very literally but if place going charge much food expect service top notch well service just so so  Hence 3 stars  <EOR> I come every time Las Vegas done years  close Los Angeles but truly believe Vegas location best them all   Yes expensive but fish flown daily consistently best tasting fish available     Do yourself favor order Shima Roll spicy tuna shrimp cilantro sriracha   fantastic  Other Must Try menu items garlic green beans tuna carpaccio garlic chips baked miso black cod yellowtail sashimi diced chilis anything sushi sashimi menu specials always great  Whenever foie gras specials menu partner always orders because he can't California he always enjoys he orders     When your reservation request table window spectacular view strip  already romantic setting even more special  <EOR> I wanted badly love Sushi Roku    but alas poor service ruined otherwise wonderful restaurant   But there's just no excuse bad service high end expensive Vegas restaurant this  when many other amazing restaurants enjoy   The first time came promptly seated sushi bar where just sat    forever    nothing   no drinks no water no menu  looked uncomfortably around wondering if restaurant really even open yet  finally awkwardly ask sushi chef if supposed order drinks which normally bad etiquette sushi restaurant chefs only sushi   Finally waitress showed menus took drink orders  some point later evening those drinks finally found way us   In sharp contrast incompetent waitress sushi chefs AMAZING  ordered several high end specialty sushi rolls at $26 roll received delicious beautiful  favorites Titan roll which piece art Katana roll  Everything fresh tasty   Meanwhile finished drinks ordered second round  Once again waited   waited    waited  Keep mind wasn't ANYONE else section    restaurant busy all bartenders bar looked bored    yet waited waited waited some more drinks  now already finished meal honestly probably even digested already  Once again awkwardly ask sushi chef help  Only time asked manager explaining chef he done nothing wrong!    manager apologized soon drinks  But really didn't even care point because ready leave  Then shocked when first received bill nothing comped but later when slip came sign found he comped drinks some sushi least there's that   In most recent trip Vegas decided give restaurant another shot since liked sushi much  time sat table great view strip  really liked decor dining room felt quite comfortable there  But once again service disappointed us   first item tried order Oyster sushi told out   Next tried order Spanish Mackerel sushi told too  Finally ordered some rolls did have    waiting began again  more more time passed still hadn't received sushi realized restaurant just fundamental service problems  waiter apologized explained sushi chefs slammed but really there's just no excuse when paying $26 roll  tickets see show later starting stress whether even going time  also annoyed when waiter gave only little bit wasabi ginger share then he even took away partway through meal!  ask more   I think restaurant much potential really think sushi very good  But bad service just ruined whole experience me  If weren't great sushi wonderful view Vegas I'd definitely giving restaurant only star  Later same trip ate Blossom Aria hotel paid $20 $25 per entree some most amazing service restaurant  When Vegas want fun treated king    Sushi Roku just didn't me  disappointed  <EOR> We used come often Vegas specifically tuna tare tare  new tuna tare tare crispy dough cup now replaced infamous old tuna tare tare let tell pales comparison old recipe   We requested old recipe made but shock sushi chef said no can't done  thought wow!

What? um     I say West Hollywood location way better    I Hamachi scallion roll crunchy spicy tuna fried over cooked tuna Hamachi jalapeno sashimi    Over all ok   wouldn't back based experience  But next time down west area there  <EOR> We place NYE  classy place  ordered tofu 3ways salmon sashimi carpaccio appetizers  tofu dish decent  sashimi carpaccio very flavorful  also matsu sushi selection Japanese style ribeye steak both taste great  <EOR> Sushi Roku kind hidden since its third floor Forum Shops  Few people told place pretty good knew existed  However never actually dined until recently  Came Saturday night but restaurant empty  few people sitting sushi bar maybe 3 other tables occupied    We started off three Signature Rolls Crunchy Spicy Tuna Crab Dynamite Baked Lobster  husband liked Baked Lobster best  put creamy Miso sauce top roll which good but if stronger Miso flavor would perfect! nothing special other two ordered  basically your standard Spicy Tuna California Rolls found any sushi restaurant  also ordered Popcorn Shrimp Tempura  Kind hard screw Shrimp Tempura but tasty sauce  only complaint maybe should consider having spicy creamy sauce side because while shrimp seemed sort soggy     Service excellent  server friendly checked often  drinks always being refilled empty plates taken away quickly    I'm glad tried Sushi Roku but nothing special place want come back  think need more selections signature rolls  snob when comes sushi already favorite sushi spot! But $100 bill 2 people definitely better places eat sushi  <EOR> At Sushi Roko Sushi ok albeit extra small portions but expect strip probably never outstanding food quality service   The interior looks tired needs some updating especially most black wooden chairs all need some serious attention  <EOR> Sushi Roku excellent sushi restaurant favorite LV favorites USA   fall into trap always fall into which ordering ton most expensive sushi but also take more reasonable path eat lunch specials omakase plates etc save your wallet   quality always consistently excellent   generally excellent juicy fatty toro nigiri slices generously cut well executed   Although seldom eat rolls creative selection     **LV residents should note give 20% off locals discount huge score!  I always return Sushi Roku when LV absolutely love it!  Highly recommended all levels 'sushi expertise' non sushi menu which don't venture into extensive enough satisfy non sushi eaters well   Enjoy! <EOR> My experience place quite mixed but overall give them 4 stars  Here's why At first experience good We seated next huge party loud couldn't even hear friends  place full weren't able switch tables really ruined whole dining experience because couldn't even talk each other! Food took foooorever come when did some missing some wrong  tempura veggies weren't even cooked! But did LOT try better They comped veggies brought complimentary tempura shrimp shots table The manager came over personally apologized loudness mishaps we'd food And overall service great considering busy place was  food did take long time come but weren't rush fine  In terms quality food tempura shrimp amazing! specialty sushi rolls great but regular rolls nothing special literally nothing them could them home yourself   I'd say don't waste money regular rolls specialty ones! They're pricier but more 8 pieces instead 5 6 many more flavor combinations sauces etc  So overall I'd say give place chance  good food good service good drinks  <EOR> Sushi Roku good reputation LA  Sushi Roku Las Vegas should called Sushi Fooku because  they're going your wallet your palate   A group 5 came around 9 30PM Saturday night need pre late night nourishment  Yelping before leaping place decent review Yelp  only times  steered wrong   but oh wrong   The problems started when began select rolls order  Usually sashimi girl shy away rolls  But knew wanted something fill all up  started everyone off Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice first roll Spicy Canadian Rock Shrimp Asparagus  Tuna w Crispy Rice great but standard any sushi restaurant  roll other hand tiny 6 small pieces even smaller ingredients 11 dollars down   I asked waiter he suggested terms rolls wouldn't know rolls he told both MOST expensive rolls menu 26 dollars piece  A hole   We ordered three more rolls all small average tasting then told kitchen closing WTF 11 Vegas?
