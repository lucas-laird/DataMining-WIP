Unfortunately only because kids fought others  Order disappointed! <EOR> Ordered Postmates excellent pizza   tried supreme veggie did disappoint   Crust very good pizza great flavor!  order again  <EOR> IDK Pizza  Well    let's start name  Funny but funny when you're asking yourself idk where fuck pizza at? don't understand mom ordered pizza around 3pm pizza didn't show till 6pm  guy delivering called said he way multiple times  place maybe 2 miles away parents house   My mom called manager ask why taking long manager said well did try help find your house? Did give your cross streets? No apologies help  Just smart ass question   Obviously she going try help guide someone lost  But parents house isn't hard find all again maybe 2 miles away  least took two hours pizza boxes kinda flimsy soggy pizza cold crust pretty hard  even worth two hour wait managers rude attitude   Perhaps should work better customer service skills if going provide mediocre pizza   And possibly change name IDK where fuck pizza's if they're going provide two hours waiting  Perhaps just scheduled weaker staff members where having bad day    but overall great service pizza  <EOR>
