With off chest would say really Metro Pizza  However might add think Metro could please even foodie  least four times if keep going back something must right   The place looks 50s diner some rather uncomfortable booths back  Watch that  But servers always nice even when show right before closing    They calendar goofy specials changes every month  Goofy specials include days when 50% pizza if your name Mina  The name changes don't change your name  Also early bird special Mondays Thursdays 2 30pm 4 30pm Any Pizza Any Size Half Price!  Now pizza always thin crust  bake pies pizza pan knobs along bottom probably technical term think helps create beautifully crisp crust without excessive greasiness  toppings generous fresh  generally don't order specialty pizzas just toppings want  Man can't really think anything complain but then again am no pizza snob  Which reminds tried new Domino's? <EOR> Solid 3 star experience me   amazing but definitely bad   I'd happy return even order pickup delivery   We walked 7 00pm Friday night date night seated right away   The place itself little worn down but still clean comfortable     Service was   strange  We seated friendly girl then young guy tuxedo shirt bowtie came over drinks   when gave coupon free meatball sliders he became bit confused manager took care rest night   but guy bowtie kind of   hovered around table almost he wasn't sure he supposed doing    The manager very nice though   We waited 20 minutes food which isn't bad wait   The food LOOKED amazing    The Meatball Sliders meatballs sauce cheese served garlic knot french fries   Whoever came idea slider garlic knot   well they're genius want kiss them   great idea!
