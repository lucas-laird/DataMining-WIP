Awful bowl enchilada sauce tortilla soup salad under gross cheese enchiladas! Cold taco! place garbage! Run!!!!   Nothing family place! Gotta puke! <EOR> To fair look Pinches Tacos but only thing eat Mexican Corn Cob   Perhaps more depth review would give chance add another star   As only handful places eat Downtown Container Park Pinches shorter line   But wasn't particularly going entrees since some other food already another eatery   did really want check Pinches though   ended getting biggest staples find Mexican menu besides rice beans tortillas   Corn cob!  The Mexican Corn Cob Pinches Tacos actually bad although prefer mine grilled   looked just boiled steamed   did requisite Mexican cream cheese chili powder though   very good helping it   corn cob good size well enough two people munch off of   Overall taste good sweet corn blended well hit cream salty cheese   kick chili powder most welcome   would definitely again next time come back Pinches Tacos   The thing took 1 2 star review should no surprise   the price   Wow $3 95 plus tax corn cob?  Seems really high priced me   mean down your local Mexican market around town same corn cob in some cases better $2!  There's Mexican guy pass nearly everyday work rolls around little food cart sells corn cob $2 looks just good Pinches Tacos   must say raise prices must mean rent Downtown Container Park can't cheap     Hopefully when feel braving parking crowds park again able stop Pinches Tacos another taste  <EOR> This Mexican eatery located inside Container Park    I ordered fish taco chips salsa chicken quesadilla  all excellent  love fresh salsa  also side order guacamole but kick it  If can't spicy just beware  But ate them anyway    Not many sitting inside you'll sit outside  But they'll bring your food you  <EOR> I recommend trying agua frescas carne asada fríes  vibe but feel definitely over priced  meat quality isn't good prices charge could way better  alright if you're area but there's definitely some yummier taco Mexican places  <EOR> Tacos pretty good but nothing exciting  all edgy names which if know some Spanish slang might little uncomfortable ordering front your kids   Prices decent rice beans chips really good   Like every other place container park there's basically zero seating inside  Great sit patio if weather good great December January   I'm boosting 4 stars because container park gentrification complete!   <EOR> Amazing! Came pinche tacos 31st Dec  greeted amazing waiter  He recommended dishes few laughs us  Ordered tacos nachos burritos everything great! great came back 2 days later  Again welcomed awesome staff  food amazing  owner even took some shots us  Random but he really nice! Great place  Totally recommend it  <EOR> We thought place would delicious previously told based reviewers however case  place good meat taste kind weird  Also over priced  <EOR> Didn't really mean but friends ended being those people     We THOSE people came 10 minutes before Pinches Tacos closed  Now typically would understand if restaurant employees cranky because hey cleaning getting ready home  But surprise COMPLETE opposite terms service   We first timers heard much place pleased find cashier taking time talk some popular menu items  also noticed other diners talking people taco line complimenting everything just ate which only raised expectations even more   In end carne asada al pastor tacos  able try both good  portions meat salsa bad but tortilla definitely topped me!   didn't worry ripping because good hold everything inside always plus book!  Overall food bad  service downtown atmosphere keep coming back! <EOR> A little pricey but damn good pinche tacos!

Definitely gets job done while you're visiting park  Prices average menu big selection  However if you're looking best burritos town highly recommend Cardenas  <EOR> I'm sure if easily pleased when comes Mexican food if place really good    going say really good three main reasons any restaurant good 1 food good GREAT  only twice both times burrito instead tacos  pork asada beef   very more ish! opinion perfect size burrito you're left heavy brick your belly carb crash shortly after  comes side chips salsa just right amount kick   2 service friendly fast  first time late lunch food 5 minutes  second time during peak lunch time line quickly moved food arrived table between 5 10 minutes  Both times people behind counters friendly approachable gave good guidance order   3 atmosphere relaxed perfect outdoor lunch during warm winter day  There's seating inside outside sat outside patio where ample tables chairs heaters  warm not hot winter sun kissing skin burritos couldn't asked better lunch  say inside seating little sparse due size stores Container Park but believe made good use space had   I'll eating way through menu coming months    maybe weeks    ok honestly it'll probably days <EOR> This favorite place eat inside container park   Here's do   1  Check music listing  Friday Saturdays live music container park starting 5pm 2  happy hour beer bin702 sit stage 3  pinch tacos eat down front stage  taco plate 9 5 but lame cause pay extra  50 per taco carne asada   not sure why  potato flautas 5 5  Comes guacamole  4  bring your food you    Excellent experience least once month <EOR> The food isn't all great  serves sopes without queso fresco anyway?!?! However if want pay $4 corn perfect place  <EOR> This first time container park  Heard much place try it  don't eat meat but wasn't problem here  fish burrito which came chips salsa  burrito pretty good   favorite part corn!! goood!!!! Best corn ever had!   The only downside long line  husband stood line forever food took while there  menu also bit hard read  Overall awesome place  <EOR> We already burger loaded Fries elsewhere  But visiting Container Park noticing Pinches sign Asada Fries couldn't resist!  They start seriously awesome fries things perfectly crispy seasoned  Then they're covered cheese beans salsa guac sour cream course carne Asada  really load them every bite full flavorful!  We definitely back try more here! <EOR> We locals frequent container park often  today big group friends decided try someplace new  husband ordered carne asada tacos  Order came wrong but husband hungry he didn't say anything  older man served food rudely insisted  he ordered     wasn't  Anyways he then scoop metal stands table numbers a few table knocks them over ALL fall onto husband plate  food all over table  Big mess  Gross metal signs food  entire table kinda surprised he proceeded scoop them off husbands food say meant then walk off  Um ok  Luckily wasn't plate cuz definitely wouldnt wanted eat that  Anyways lost future business plus friends saw incident majorly turned off  Shocked family owned business  think they'd realize important customer service is  Anyways there's way better places eat container park  recommend Perch super customer service great food! highly recommend avoiding place  <EOR> When show typical Mexican food joint if see carnitas menu you've already attention    But Pinches' unfair advantage serve beer  Another unfair advantage Pinches located inside Container Park an awesome atmosphere live music usually playing 90% time but big reasons give place five stars serving system seems nearly perfect  third visit first time being given wrong order but mere SECONDS later correct food table nothing worse being hungry seeing someone else's food chowing down   I burrito made certain way served exactly no guff  Great food  Great atmosphere  Beer  wrong?   With Taco y Taco Roberto's town nice try excellent burritos fish tacos great flavor  definitely favorite Mexican food spots Las Vegas <EOR> If looking bang your buck PLACE!!!!

The burrito lot fresher lighter tasting most Mexican restaurants  chicken lightly marinated moist tender  tortilla also soft moist no dry ends  Rare If you're into spicy heat ask hottest salsa have  kind extra hot version Ranchero salsa   I've read reviews complain portion price ratio  True portions traditional American Plate crowding portions  But pretty close portion sizes other Mexican places freemont area  opinion food lot fresher close home made taste rest   Will eating again very near future  <EOR> I dined color run event food amazing  torta de pescado fish torta sandwich usual whenever go  sandwich itself pretty stuffed consisting fried fillet coleslaw beans  Each bite harmonious combination hot cool well tender slight crunch full flavor  personally know owner he staff very flexible when comes customizing substituting orders  feel family because cool día de los muertos lotería decor everywhere but because warm friendly interactions    Rating wise would give place 5 star rating but only reason why spacing particular location  extremely compact limited  Everything else outside since Vegas you're being blasted scorching heatwaves cold air  <EOR> This laid back Mexican fast food restaurant located container park  ordered carne Asada alpastor burrito  both very good  However alpastor good people enjoy spicy food   While carne Asada less flavor less spice  burritos come rice beans good quantity guacamole  dish also comes chips fresh salsa side  food good only problem dont always table very limited patio space  menu also bit overwhelming hard read   Overall very good place eat Mexican food without breaking your bank  <EOR> Pros tacos AMAZING  flavors very tasty but overpowering    just right! usual carne asada el pastor pollo every single delicious! best deal combination plate 3 tacos comes rice beans you'll definitely full!
