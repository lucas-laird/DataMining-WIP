On particular trip broccoli cheese soup served sourdough bowl   soup $4 50 believe extra charge sourdough bowl $2 50   Soup good thick without being thick   sourdough good good BJ's but still quite excellent   Decent sized serving   soup bowl plenty food fill belly   I didn't try pizza but looked kind gross   sort pizza elementary school cafeteria   Greasy thin crust whatnot   wings looked good friend dined says he enjoyed them   I taste friend's fries   Yum   bit crispy outside but still thick enough taste potato inside   Perfect   Usually crispiness comes price tasting potato but place able pull off   Service really good   Anytime soda began low promptly filled back up  <EOR> Solid pizza   Great little mom pop shop couple great specials   Loved all! <EOR> We ordered XXL pizza boy BIG! fed family four 2 5 days!!! Friendly staff! <EOR> I ordered place years very good  Due late work nights ordered several times last month     also LOVE PIZZA    Once pizza soggy uncooked middle   also did bring parm cheese crushed peppers asked for  called brought new pizza took old one  mediocre pizza kind bland  thought maybe busy new cook   The next time asked them crushed peppers parm cheese packets alway ask I stressed important was  said would put ticket   Pizza showed no peppers cheese packets saw receipt there   said would back few minutes it  waited hour never showed  Pizza cold soggy time  OMG don't say right back never show up!   I gave them another try week later  I love pizza Same thing!  No crushed peppers cheese packets!  time came back 10 minutes it  ticket! why extra car? least time delivery guy came back  pizza bit bland but ok     Ok tonight ordered gourmet pizza  figured might better luck house specialities  pizza supposed FRESH basil fresh mozzarella according description menu    pizza 90% tomato sauce tasted cheap canned spaghetti sauce katsup   cheese minimal  pizza crust tons tomato sauce cracker few little chunks cheese  fresh basil stated gourmet pizza description fresh all  sprinkled little dried basil maybe parsley pizza  don't know because no basil flavor let alone fresh basil    When see FRESH basil menu sort expect it  Epic fail called gourmet pizza  Keep your katsup cracker!   pizza just good anymore   general bland little care preparation  little care lot mistakes delivery side well  given place lot chances because service food good years  No really good  feel terrible posting but gave place many chances up  didn't post single bad experience but several consecutive experiences left bad taste mouth  sincerely hope together start making authentic Italian again  <EOR> Me girlfriend wanted eat hear but didn't change hundred dollar bill  planned spend around 35 dollars employee said he gonna help until another employee stopped said he couldn't because manager would kill him  Then gave ultimatum saying would spend 80 dollars order receive business  If you're gonna run business you're gonna need change your customers  Bottom line  Sorry but lost business today possibly any future business  <EOR> Several orders later still fantastic!  The only criticism delivery guys don't offer give change  just take whatever hand them then bolt  would likely tell them keep change anyway but would prefer if least offered change  <EOR> One favorite pizza joints town  love pizza much any chance get  Usually Pepperoni Mushroom Plain  <EOR> I ordered last night delivery  food just ok  ordered chicken parm dinner which suppose come salad but didn't bring that  friendly when call confirm order which didn't mind bc accidentally ordered cheese bread instead garlic knots  While brought knots also brought cheese bread but again salad no where  didn't bother call bc already full off rest it  Just disappointed if pay something expect order bag  Fairly large portions there's plenty eat  I'd maybe order again if just lazy something  just hope next time slow down check orders  <EOR> I regularly enjoy home delivery food Henderson location must say prepare fresh tasty food fair prices   wish faster delivery but otherwise entire dining experience outstanding  <EOR> Our pizza salad fresh be!
