Some other locations good days bad days food depending kitchen but Cheyenne location nothing but good days me    And only location Vegas found POLLO ASADO just shredded chicken  don't eat beef having option pollo asado fries amazing! Thanks Cheyenne Robertos! <EOR> Don't eat cheese enchilada cheese melted all brought back said  supposed don't play stupid idiots f****** Roberto's 0 stars don't know why dirty place also <EOR> We Roberto's last night dinner  beef taco chicken taco  Easy enough    Mike ordered beef chimichanga no cheese sour cream  guy read order back everything good go  Mike home cheese inside it  He back showed them took multiple times saying he ordered no cheese them understand he talking about  ended making new he came back home join me    This probably 5th time messed order  gotten point where stand register crazy lady watching them food  Every time catch them put cheese something shouldn't yell crazy lady    I don't know where miscommunication where people's orders lost translation since its printed them stare right at  Every time want back less less  <EOR> Ordered two adobado burritos go   Trying support Trump owners   Lousy burritos grisly chopped meat many onions less 1 4 tsp guacamole  <EOR> Always consistent always good food  more ask for? If want gourmet since Mexican restaurant pay price  really good though price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Another good machaca burrito! <EOR> There many Roberto's valley some better others some worse  But general product consistent you're never far away provide good food reasonable price   I used location before Roberto's non chain Mexican restaurant great chili rellenos favorites  digress back Roberto's Yelp   I working area location several times but never Yelped them  usually carne asada burrito lunch special  $7 35 carne asada burrito sides rice beans drink  today   The burrito filled carne asada avocado very tasty sides rice beans beans little above average rice average  Soda Pepsi genre   I gave three stars which average rating which consider them be  But Yelped many Mexican restaurants late many below average would seek average  food tastes good plenty reasonable price can't ask much more that  if you're area give them try  If you're Roberto's fan location average them better worse but general Roberto's consistent recommend them  <EOR> I ordered chicken burrito wonderful  highly recommend Roberto Taco Shop 1000% over location Lake Mead Rancho Las Vegas  <EOR> Best Roberto's to  extreamly happy location close by  some dreadful food other Roberto's locations but knew would eventually find good it  always carne asada fries delicious  meat actually seasoned pretty good unlike other Roberto's  also tried taquitos burritos all very delicious  Love horchata fresh pepinos relish lemon set costumers  am very very picky when comes Mexican food certain expectations sure cut  <EOR> I've going Roberto's 3 years now haven't disappointed once  usually order regular bean cheese burrito Carne Asada Nachos but everything tried still good! <EOR> For whatever reason shops only south Orange County San Diego Ca Vegas! Riverside Ca  But most great things woke day realizing Riverside Ca then F   out! L A  Alberto's Alvarro's etc   Their font signage nearly identical but once try Roberto's clear ingredients FAR superior other Taco chain s ! used say Alberto's best drunk food but trying Roberto's can't even stoop Alberto's level anymore     Rolled Chicken tacos Chicken Burrito Chicken Chimichanga! <EOR> My boyfriend ran Roberto's last night early morning 9 3 17 around 1 30am  live within walking distance  He asked if wanted anything lucky said no  He ordered two beef tacos usual beans rice it    Around 4 30am he started barfing shitting  He's terribly sick ever since  I'd suggest eating here  <EOR> Not gonna lie Roberto's go to when want some fast Mexican food   and don't wanna deal those huge 'Mexican' chains!  Yeah  DEL BELL     This probably closest home   Often pretty busy too   usually eat restaurant because else   the FREE salsa bar!  Thing loaded all sides need your meal pickled carrots sliced cucumbers sliced radishes jalapenos limes heck  even stalks fresh green onion!  red green salsas good well   Stock up!  What fam usually order doesn't change much when visit any Roberto's   We'll stick popular carne asada burrito machaca burrito I breakfast dinner rolled tacos carne asada nachos chicken tacos don't forget $1 chicken taco Wednesdays feel change tortas   But no matter decent quick meal   Watch though   the fillings burritos DAMN HOT!  literally cook place warm tortilla then send out   Tasty tasty but watch your mouth!  Enough cause some heat backlash   dainty if to   cut burrito half let some steam!  Their red green salsas accompany food very well   can't really decide which better always douse food some both   Delegation y'all!  carne asada nachos actually quite HUGE really give more meat chips one   pile cheese   not mention sour cream guac!  massive spoonful each   Fatty city come!  But really taste good enough just don't care   just eat side some Roberto's raw veggies salsa bar even bit     Don't start those rolled tacos   no doubt fatty fat cholesterol bombs!  KABOOM!  Rolled tacos covered mean COVERED shredded cheddar cheese topped generous amounts sour cream guac   yourself defibrillator if you're eating order along burrito nachos   Oily goodness!  Oh yeah extra napkins too   Folks nice enough never give any trouble   Fast efficient service   Es muy bueno! <EOR> I love some Roberto's food! No isn't fancy good least but enjoy time time   just wish could talk hubby into eating more often   Here's why Roberto's 1  Huge portions!  rarely finish any meal order here   almost always leftovers great next day     2  Good cheap! wallet never crying pay food here  ton pay for   love good deal   3  Super fast! totally fast food! great because am usually rush   think should add drive thru window though   rarely because usually crazy 2 year old backseat getting car seat much work most time   4  open 24 hours!   Why only 3 stars? Well     1  staff isn't particularly friendly   aren't mean rude but aren't very welcoming either   2  but don't huge effort which means just ok book   know totally subjective but truth    So enjoy Roberto's everyone should try least once   if try Carne Asada fries! <EOR> Unfortunately write bad review raved French fries hooked lot people fries  hoped just fluke getting undercooked fries but 4 times row isn't fluke  use come every Tuesday fries but can't continue disappointed eat soggy undercooked fries  think last time getting fries here  sad day  <EOR> Always $ 99 chicken tacos Wednesdays but location good  chicken seasoned very good  staff nice friendly  return location next week  <EOR> I  really only review Breakfast Burritos location but OMG       good!!!
