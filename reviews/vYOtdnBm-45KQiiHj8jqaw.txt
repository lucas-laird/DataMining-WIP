Served warm flaky jams cream delicious sweet   Service also warm personable  waitress brought complimentary glass champagne friend celebrating bachelorette!  I took off 1 star because Tea Lounge shares space check in lobby hear watch people checking in while you're having tea slightly takes away peaceful ambiance want afternoon tea  space itself also pretty small I'd estimate fits 30 40 ppl capacity most  <EOR> Love fun fancy daytime activity girlfriends mom  much fun both times been   love mini food items delicious desserts  Great cocktails too!! service fabulous view amazing just peaceful spot great experience  <EOR> Came tea mom niece great time  very nice food delicious  niece children's tea which came hot chocolate nice creamy  adults tea variety teas choose from  While having tea enjoy beautiful view strip  must if visiting Las Vegas  relaxing alternative if into partying strip  <EOR> This first time doing tea time glad popped cherry place  Totally swanky tea lounge 23rd floor Mandarin Oriental hotel  Very quiet relaxing peaceful environment keep mind Monday afternoon though  am sure busier weekends! We English Tea set ordered Green tea w lychee flavors  tea quite good but lukewarm few minutes which pet peeve love teas pipin' hot! finger foods very high quality but most items contained items am huge fan e g  smoked salmon curry chicken etc   actually hoping more simple cucumber ham sandwiches since well tea easy eat!  The dessert total miss me  Way sugary sweet palate barely touched them  would prefer more finger sandwiches place sweets! Overall service great server very attentive  <EOR> My girlfriends town bachelorette party over weekend decided try Tea Lounge because sister law manager training property 100% recommended it  definitely cherry top bachelorette party  girls loved it! Everything atmosphere fanciness decor perfect service provided great! Jingle server amazing! She very helpful deciding selections presentation teas pastries very professional  would definitely recommend place afternoon tea anytime feel being bit fancy impress your town guests!  girlfriends well definitely back!! <EOR> This place pretty much imagine little girls picturing when imaginary tea parties admittedly more dinosaurs lemonade stands some reason should help visuals  Everything adorably presented daintily tiny except pots tea which bigger home  very lovely feels bit homey lounge comfy couches etc   I really enjoyed butter scones which fantastic warm when brought table  wasn't fan clotted cream I'd never before but apricot jam raspberry jam brought table both great scones well honey  also enjoyed fresh passionfruit fruit platter brought when initially realized tried substitute dessert allergic yet another dessert same allergen also dragonfruit tapioca pudding gave well for same reason   tea also good quality morsels which able eat definitely delicious   The rating giving reflects handling food allergies could really bad thing if more serious allergy  egg allergy which gives stomach aches so life threatening much just painful am also vegetarian  When group made reservation friend very specifically told them asked if would able accommodate said they'd no problem it  If food allergy any kind know your stuff before coming although even didn't save end  easy enough them accommodate vegetarian request just substitute things meat them other menu items which safe  tried substitute some eggy dessert items couple macarons which primarily made egg whites pointed immediately when hostess brought desserts pointed which ones intended safe me  She looked pretty surprised thought maybe made eggless version she check discovered correct chef made mistake  pastries sweets turns appear brought outside sources rather made house chef downstairs apparently aware into them general knowledge any ingredients list which may may provided guess when ordering your sweets elsewhere   brought fruit plate fairly immediately then asked chef something scratch once knew mistake handled well  They came down vanilla tapioca pudding dragonfruit think guava compote jelly quite nice  hadn't tapioca pudding before oddly enough  hostess also very polite whole thing apologized chef's behalf  However really should more suspicious other items claimed safe eat because even all still ended stomachache later case food allergies please warned chef charge down doesn't seem take particularly seriously   Another thing when made reservation told would spot good view which guess thought meant we'd spot windows  entire time two spots windows open little reserved spot sign weren't only ones seated away window either  Ultimately big deal but little confusing  maybe folks reserved spot couple hours late something  Also told don't really Gong Fu Cha service anymore which    Well just really wanted know entailed guess infrequently hostess wasn't able describe us   Anyhow realize very mixed review but summary cute little place really cute little foods reasonably good quality teas but pricey if food allergies careful  concept lot location lovely but couldn't see myself going back personal experience  <EOR> By far favorite places tea lite bites exquisite view Vegas  Consider place real treat bring special someone Vegas visitor  definitely impressive  <EOR> During recent trip Vegas over Christmas holiday best friend decided visit Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge relaxing late afternoon away fanny packs liquor slushies    I'll start good    The hotel itself very chic Tea Lounge  Beautiful Asian decor view strip could find postcard hotel gift shop  clean upscale environment but without pretentious air frequent accompanies high tea    hostesses elegantly dressed seated almost instantly   In terms food impressed spread  scones delicious especially when accompanied strawberry rhubarb compote clotted cream  selection tea lovely  favorite being matcha    Now bad    The sandwich selection offer includes curried chicken salad which contains nuts  However nowhere menu did specify use nuts any offerings  waitress also gave extremely detailed run down types sandwiches scone toppings desserts yet failed mention nuts being any food aside pistachio cake  record am deathly allergic peanuts cashews point carry around multiple Epi pens purse everywhere go    When bit into sandwich started feel sick took closer look only see small piece nut couldn't identify off bat  When flagged down waitress ask kind nuts items she panicked left ask chef  When she returned she kept firmly insisting fine because just walnuts but ANYONE knows ANYTHING nuts knows almost all tree nuts processed same facilities  When tried ask nuts being any other desserts she acted annoyed bothered again    I appalled handled felt ill remainder day because bite sandwich  almost offended see automatically included 18% gratuity bill because would left $0 if given opportunity   I admit irresponsible part ask but waitress given such precise account ingredients used other items ie eggnog truffles bubblegum flavored French macarons black forest ham sandwiches etc  thought clear  suppose error expect such highly regarded establishment would care customer's dietary restrictions    I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't enjoy writing bad reviews as tell profile but necessary case warn other people severe nut allergies! lucky all left bad stomach ache  really hope future Mandarin Tea Lounge more consequent patrons' needs  <EOR> Absolutely fabulous! Attentive service wonderful food great selection teas  just left already can't wait back! <EOR> Beautiful view   Another review mentioned top floor Mandarin Oriental which exactly true   23rd floor which where hotel lobby is  <EOR> Awesome view on point service elegantly presented goodies tea can't ask more    My friends tea party dear friend's baby shower   seated next window which say understated  window fact whole length room sitting rooftop Vegas beautiful views lay ahead us    Our servers very accommodating nice offer take pictures just taking picture but making sure if picture took good enough if lighting just right  does nowadays???
