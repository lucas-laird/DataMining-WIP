Possibly fact very rarely even visit them  just don't understand happened good ole' days when McDonald's actually priced fairly didn't all issues but it   Supply demand type thing suppose? But geezee brought friend baby last night Happy Meal ice cream cone    Drive thru PACKED moving   literally spent good 15 20 minutes stuck all result getting ordering window informed ice cream per usual orange HI C suppose Happy Meal couldn't happen because Order   Sad say but just really aggravating no matter McDonalds location visit bound experience some sort issue deemed uncontrollable circumstance    The whole corporation should just stop offering ice cream because never fails damn machine ALWAYS BROKE! High Prices High Blood Pressure High chances ordering being able fulfilled enough continue keep away visiting any location    just one  <EOR> I can't really review joint serve breakfast since 3am   I mean really?

Keep mind car right obviously waiting order  Then employee turned around walked back into McDonalds Then someone started taking order over speaker I ordered breakfast items  which informed no longer serving   I thinking mind think just saw walk turn menu mean car 2 feet away Anyway craving breakfast let them know wanted cancel order I told breakfast hours over Then     magically     Christmas Miracle breakfast me   Truth willing leave McDonalds breakfast food  rule myself  never fight people food behind closed doors  Yea maybe paranoid but sadly its reality  completely polite canceling order  believe did right thing offering breakfast items  Where find problem simple lack customer service  conversation them no longer serving breakfast should never had  Implying order inconvenience when clearly shouldn't been    So then back few days later because type gives second chances missed few items ordered  Meaning ordered them saw drive thru order menu screen paid wasn't bag when gave order   Yea long review would honestly surprised if someone read down far  Props if have  But whole reason behind am just super tired getting terrible customer service paying food don't get  reason review only 1 star because given place multiple visits keep coming same problem  Bad customer service  <EOR> I occasionally buy coffee McDonald's rather Starbucks because once all yummy stuff caramel chocolate cream can't really taste difference least can't!  best all cheaper!  Let's face folks paper cup! If going spend $6 coffee least served proper ceramic cup!  Anyways came through drive through Saturday morning super quick efficient  two windows going place your order just flew through NASCAR driver speed!  Mind coffee    <EOR> Micky D's should all same but 10 plus year going most stand offish unfriendly people ever  starts top guess owners just don't care if employees unfriendly  <EOR> Terrible customer service  Kept interrupting while ordering  chicken nuggets definitely reheated day before  diet regular coke  <EOR> Other fact Redbox outside two lane drive thru at least star isn't anything great MCD's  If some nuggets Big Mac why not? But if probably best any other fast food joints nearby  Trust isn't throwing distance  <EOR> This place really hit miss service   The food cheap  why here  Period   The service said off  Sometimes mess up  They're busy   Cause heaven sent dollar menu  Love hate relationship guys   Updates They've smoothies love some Mango Pineapple  Yum!

Newest thing McDonald's health conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin   Definitely healthier take breakfast menu   yes fell damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck McDonald's bag tried one   Myself being bit health nut can't complain   egg white creation pretty tasty   Grilled egg whites Canadian bacon eh? white cheddar all toasted English muffin?  All only 250 calories?  Yeah dollar really liked it   But regular price almost $3?  would probably passed   coupon $1 $1 coffee made nice meal small scale economy   almost ALMOST added $1 hash brown   Luckily passed decided save money calories later   Other think majority people around world know McDonald's offers menu   If don't dang must living under rock?  possibly place where no McDonald's within your vicinity like under rock   <EOR> Steven best guy around!!!
