See next Saturday! <EOR> Service mediocre best  bad closest location  times servers point then times basic  Last week's dine in real basic  server didn't greet upon coming table  Never knew name  Granted he kept drinks filled but he failed bring complete order table forcing always remind him  He never smiled nor asked if needed anything  always ask  Every good server would know if kids present need extra napkins!   Today's pick order even worse  very specific ordered salad  only did lady read back correctly receipt printed correctly  why did food come incorrectly?! When expressed concern adamant no tomatoes due allergy cashier just looked dumb founded  reply concern Well see ordered no tomatoes  Never once did she offer remake salad nor take back them pull tomatoes off  Poor customer service!   Again sucks closest location  <EOR> It's 7 30p  Only person working floor  No place servings table  beverages served though waiting 10 minutes  Obviously cutting help  Server very friendly   a plus them  Don't recommend coming unless there's no other choice  <EOR> Thinking eating breakfast IHOP Sunday morning? Usually bad idea  When pulled parking lot full few families standing outside doors  fought way hostess stand made reservation party two  20 25 minutes she said  husband waited less minute sweltering heat when spotted empty bench mid section  sat down in between section then another minute passed husband motioned move seats again bench closer hostess stand  musical chairs? Anyways point seating area being cleared pronto fashion    Our name called seconds after  Instead waiting 20 25 minutes seated within 5 minutes even though looked crazy busy here  seated booth section waiter quickly took drink orders  fan IHOP's vanilla mocha iced coffees $2 99   drinks little pricey but least refills  ordered short stack pancakes $5 99 Mr  some kind ginormous combo plate  food less 10 minutes  food made order tasted great   If you're going IHOP ordering pancakes french toast waffles cannot stress importance using Butter Pecan syrup!!! everything better knocks socks off plain ol' maple syrup  husband introduced Butter Pecan syrup hooked ever since  swear dump half bottle sweet stuff pancakes  waiter game  He checked often made sure everything okay  When husband's plate came minus some hash browns waiter said he'd take care hash browns seconds later  bill came $22 some change  only complaint when counter pay cashier tried withhold receipt forgot hand back us  problem least three times before can't coincidence  Thing receipt survey which gets free short stack your next visit  rarely fill them but hey point want receipt!   I liked fact able restaurant virtually no wait time  customer service overall average but waiter particular awesome  IHOP Centennial Center your usual everyday IHOP  back when want some more Butter Pecan syrup side pancakes  <EOR> Service good food much  ordered chicken cheese crapes  Chicken used crapes absolute lowest quality possible chewable pieces holding each other something string like    took bite ewwwww! Otherwise wouldn't bad   ordering anything chicken anymore  <EOR> Super slow service mediocre poor food  I'd check other IHOP's area    not worth your time  <EOR> This place disgust would come least once month  Earlier today 2 coffees 2 waters unfortunately cups smelled wet dog even manager admit   all she did apologize wife th table next shocked smell water    why place still open  If sick 3 days takes long bacteria someone sick going blood test done IHOP big dilemma <EOR> Two stars might bit much place but never issues service just blah food  Everything lot salt it  EVERYTHING  Everything pre made well eggs pancake mix stuffed french toast  know this? asked once if could stuffed french toast without raisins toast  Oh already there  just thaw it  Um  EW   I've gotten still frozen strawberries which good all greasy eggs do saute them butter back there? limp ill looking tomato slices  I use place when high school when no other place open late teens mingle eat junk  seems every time ever gone something gets messed up  Whether plate sliced tomatoes somehow turned into plate pancakes they really try give those things out eggs being over easy scrambled   Service alright sometimes slow waiter sometimes don't but never rude one  <EOR> Giving 5stars because really wasn't anything wrong food service  <EOR> This WORST ihop ever to  friends horrible experience here  decided come breakfast morning  seated waitress extremely rude right off bat I wish would gotten name   When ordered drinks she threw straws table instead putting them down nicely  When she took food order friends ordered country fried steak eggs  waitress proceeded ask kind pancakes she wanted  friend didn't even know came pancakes decided she would just blueberry  some odd reason she only rude table  all other tables she nice be  Maybe because group young adults? Idk but found act very disrespectful  getting ready leave bill noticed friend charged extra pancakes she originally didn't want kindly asked waitress it  waitress lied trying say she said came buttermilk pancakes ONLY when reality she asked kind pancakes friend wanted because came it  friends bill rather high she wanted know why she being charged extra not big deal she going pay regardless if took off not   became issue argument even manager involved did absolutely NOTHING help out  She basically waitresses side claiming oh well she's 10 years never issue   used work restaurant manager would NEVER doubted customer rather if right wrong    customer always right  restaurants job sure customers great experience am right? Anyways nothing solved payed bills moved on  last bill paid because separate checks MANAGER chased down asking if stole cell phone cashiers drawers?! hell?! furious point  all felt judged unbelievable treated us  NEVER back  If could give place 0 stars would  <EOR> I love IHOP  waitress hostess always nice food always great  also enjoy to go containers reuse them home  <EOR> I personally wouldn't even give them star but no choice  come few times service ok food average  Today put name list let them know would need highchair  waited 15 minutes seated then seated waitress  same time she seating another host stepped front sat someone else there  She pointed another table said she'd highchair  husband stood son 5 minutes she walked around helping others while seeing husband standing now crying 1 yr old  She didn't even bother say she someone else bringing it  Then finally waiter came over said sorry no highchairs walked away  left when husband talked manager he pretty much sorry sucks but come back again  <EOR>
