But shouldn't hinder quality  time around jjajang sauce runny all  thick AF   The kind thick you'd expect seeing fridge leftovers couple days after  pleasant all didn't even kimchi banchan either    They say third time charm but pretty remorseful second trip     The plaza TONS good choices I'd probably visit SOYO before going again <EOR> Finally korean chinese cuisine vegas! Came no expectation turnt pretty good! love jjamppong jjjajangmyeon! second time coming back yay! <EOR> The service great but wasn't huge fan food  jjajangmyun wasn't used growing little lackluster predominant flavors slightly bland  Personal opinions aside would still give try  <EOR> Great place Korean Style Chinese Cuisine! expensive great service staff  ordered Black Bean Noodles special fantastic! Highly recommended those love Korean Style cuisine! <EOR> My Korean noodle knowledge admittedly lacking but some Asian friends lured social media marketing  Long noods long life yo! service very attentive good value huge portion sizes! but food itself didn't me   Jjajangmyeon specialty black bean noodle pork sauce bland note better elsewhere  brought scissors cut noodles but unnecessary kept breaking off short  No cool noodle lift photos us   The Samseong Jjamppong spicy seafood vegetables bit better but table agreement spicy sauce just tasted spicy without developed flavor  Same issue noodles broke easily just weren't very chewy  Prefered soup seafood   Maybe consistency issues maybe just fan food  Would come back if friend suggested but would try other dishes  didn't live hype  <EOR> Really nice ambience but food werent special  enough side dishes too    compared other places  <EOR> This place awsome  Nice decorate awsome taste food frendily server  love visit when want eat korean chinese dish  noddle item delicious every time visted <EOR> I found restaurant last month  Since crazy noodle  basically all noodle good really Love Kolian noodle !!!!! wish restaurant near house <EOR> Had late Father's Day dinner last night  Just happened also started serving happy hour 9pm 1am  Man extra treat  Frist off multiple times before  family LOVE everything place  ambience decorations spacious settings unique hole wall asian dining experience  servings huge exactly family needs since always eat family style  service always great crossing fingers doesn't EVER sour   Most importantly food AMAZING!!

The seating seems traditional necessarily comfortable because table hangs low your legs fit under  <EOR> I've looking Korean Chinese restaurant since restaurant Chinatown closed  super duper excited see place opened up!!  But little disappointed  The service quite par    Don't wrong service would Korea    Where flag down your server yelling across dining room    But US    doesn't really fly     know? server nice answered all questions but crane neck entire time try eye contact multiple times just check  But credit     looked he only taking orders????? 2 other ladies but just seem refill water bring food  might need rethink this  1 server dining area enough  2 5 Ambiance    Whoa! place definitely bigger then expected when walked in  huge! didn't see private rooms dining area back room    But definitely bigger then expected! entrance way little dark but rest dining room very bright  Most dining area painted white left side dining area being bright red  very clean space very open  Ambiance definitely 5 5  Food    drink    I asked barley tea told only Jasmine tea    served cute little pot tiny glass    Tea decent but really would've liked barley tea  side dishes banchan ok  Kim chi made American cabbage instead Napa cabbage    actually really good great texture  other dish raw onions traditional yellow pickled daikon served black bean sauce happens favs  But it  Maybe future more??? ordered deep fried dumplings good  skin crispy filling meaty juicy  vinegar soy sauce fine ground chili flakes table your own sauce dumplings  just wished black vinegar think tastes better then normal white vinegar types dumplings  4 5   I also ordered jja jang myun  price decent    only $6 95 small  done more Korean way instead Chinese way which expecting since most pictures displayed Chinese version  flavor ok  tad sweet didn't porky flavor expecting well  noodles also over cooked very very soft no mouth feel  also need tighten sauce little done picking all noodles sauce completely soupy which definitely should be  2 5  Overall think based off dishes ordered today lean more towards Korean way cooking things then Chinese which little disappointing  But since normally drive all way Island Style jja jang myun fix   I most likely back place only 5 minutes house  hoping fix service fix jja jang myun  Next time come definitely try something different   ***Tip    Pour extra vinegar onto daikon onions dip into black bean sauce enjoy! <EOR> First time trying place absolutely loved it! ordered samsun Jjambbong samsun jja jang myun both very good  best korean chinese restaurant vegas! <EOR> Regular jangbong delicious  Black bean paste noodle good too  come once week just some Chinese noodles <EOR> Was really excited try black bean noodles saw plenty Korean dramas but never really wanted try  place very nicely decorated clean spacious lots tables  came around 12 30 immediately seated   everything downhill there  sat 15 minutes no else greeted even brought water  Then waitress came took order   then brought kimchi pickled veggies still didn't water    My brother seafood fried rice which he thought ok thought wet only few  baby shrimps two pieces muscles its considered seafood fried rice  sister rice pork vegetables which pretty good  ordered dumplings appetizers which came fried rice rice bowl  black bean noodles pork which never came out! waited waited then asked guy told forgot it  cancelled it  say fried rice rice bowl came super quick   the food did didn't take long come all    I don't think bad service sense staff lazy incompetent think extremely understaffed  only three people working pretty decent number tables see working hard  hate give them only two stars but place new should more staff give best service people spread word    For particular experience extremely disappointed  given good service waited quite while order taken waited long while water water re filled forgot order rest food impressive    I might back few months when open while operation should more smooth because really want try black bean noodles but nothing else draws back place  <EOR> Not terrible experience but outstanding either  fan Korean Chinese food excited give YuXiang try  Unfortunately food service only deserve 3 stars    The japchae slightly mushy literally entire onion it  don't mind onion but way much  tiny amount other veggies  flavor okay but anything traditional japchae   The Mongolian beef good  Tender cooked well  chicken fried rice also pretty good  But neither memorable   The jajangmyun little soupy flavor okay but again nothing special    We also ordered mandoo which didn't any sauce   total came $57   We sat down soon arriving server brought complimentary hot tea ice water  don't offer free refills soda iced tea served cans which pet peeve mine  Overall service okay great but awful    Parking also issue here  3 restaurants Dairy Queen few other businesses all sharing small parking lot    In opinion when consider price quality both food service along inconvenient parking situation don't see myself coming back  <EOR> Great service great food!

If already Jjajangs Jjamppongs then suffice say NEED your way YuXiang if haven't already best Korean Chinese food town   I first Jajangmyen elevated Korean fusion restaurant several years ago loved ever since   Prior experience didn't know Korean Chinese Cuisine even thing but same way bastardized Chinese food America or should say bastardized based available ingredients pallets nationals same divergence happened long ago Korea  only few places town specialize Korean Chinese Cuisine YuXiang only tastiest but also provides best atmosphere long way   If haven't opportunity taste Korean Chinese dishes couple gateway dishes highly reminiscent American Chinese options Tangsuyuk sweet sour pork beef Kkanpunggi spicy garlic fried chicken    we shared both appetizers separate occasions friends family came with    The real standouts previously mentioned classics though Jjajang Jjamppong  usually Samseon Gan Jjajang without pork because love seafood but try limit pork intake  dish $11 hits spot! love thick rich taste black bean sauce  Highly recomended  love likes spicy orders Jjampongs typically extra spicy Bull Jjamppong seafood Samseon Jjamppong  extra spicy just that   extra spicy while Samseon Jjamppong great way enjoy some seafood more approachable spicy broth  While little more adventurous Jjamppong certainly worth trying all but those narrowest pallets   There even some American Chinese dishes available if aren't down broadening your horizons but dishes drive across town enjoy   In end YuXiang absolute best town   so could inclined pass 5 stars but don't want your expectations any higher need be  If aren't looking specifically Korean Chinese food then YuXiang very solid 4 stars   and if specifically looking Korean Chinese food then YuXiang beginning end story Vegas  <EOR> Came lunch special!

Highly recommended!! <EOR> Great place if your craving Korean Chinese cuisine    jjampong jjajjangmyun par me   But still good  <EOR> I quite happy experience restaurant today   outside thought would  hole in the wall however could more wrong   inside well decorated clean   should also mention outside hard tell restaurant open   staff extremely nice helpful     We food tasted great   personal selection quite limited since don't seafood it many entrees    Still seafood free noodle dish ordered delicious husbands fried chicken dish    This restaurant a  Chinese Korean place style spice level food would probably more familiar people unfamiliar Korean cuisine   would ideal bringing less adventurous friends introduce them Korean fare first second time    I would come back restaurant would gladly recommend friends  <EOR> It first time here  Hubby lunch Saturday wasn't busy all   really didn't know ended just getting Samseon Jjamppong white sauce which absolutely no heat  husband liked where I'd definitely try soup heat  surprised really liked soup  noodles delicious broth miso color since no peppers  seafood cooked perfectly   We weren't offered tea but wait bit when did ask it  believe hot water machine boiled water wasn't working something boil water some other way  When brought tea little kettle gave leaked when poured tea water all over table   We never asked if wanted anything else instead male server automatically asked if wanted check husband just said yes  guess we're just used other restaurants where ask if you'd interested dessert   All all sure we'll back try other entrees since fairly close house don't drive all way Chinatown  <EOR> Oodles noodles!  Alejandro B  myself took drive all way north side town some YuXiang  tired @LasVegasPhil posting scrumptious looking bowls freshly made noodles every other week see fuss all about  interior very new clean fancy designed booths extra privacy  Luckily privilege sit them since little slow   Our server very nice    pretty given suggestions orders sure completely satisfied  bad she didn't name tag would able express creepy gratitude little more Lol  Alex took team Jjamppong spicy seafood noodle soup while played safe Samseon Gan Jjajang seafood pork vegetables black bean sauce   Both own unique flavor being sweet spicy  balanced all carbs some crisp Spicy Wings weren't very hot but packed great flavor    Overall satisfied first visit XuYiang  come back try more authentic Korean Chinese entrees  <EOR> My favorite new korean chinese restaurant  Staffs super friendly  Authentic chinese food  Must try Jjajang noodle Jjamppong  Honey walnut shrimp pork beef tangsuyuk  <EOR> Good authentic korean food  Black bean noodles kids fav garlic pork  Service good server helped lot  <EOR> I come daughter regular basis  She loves steamed dumplings here  portion opinion quite generous definitely sharable  noodles excellent am normally someone likes stick ordering same thing restaurants but usually order different things because trust won't fail me  Being hospitality business definitely feel business valued welcomed  <EOR> Awesome spicy seafood noodle soup! Sweet sour pork dish perfect  Love separate sauce pork  Service excellent ambiance equally nice  Overall place excellent  <EOR> I visited YuXiang last Friday  good taste beef tangsuyuk jiajangmyun   Also surver's survives good  visit again!! <EOR> To restaurant seems considerably overpriced   Maybe feel better eating next time instead getting takeout though     Mapo Tofu weird cornstarch thickened sweet tomato soup lightly spicy almost nonexistent meat   Mapo Tofu Grand Sign Kitchen nearby lot more use bigger shreds pork any dishes bigger tofu less different sauce     Could barely tell difference between $11 Japchaebap $19 Gochu Japchae more expensive different container but portion looked pretty much same   pork cut tissue thin   amount cost every entree should come side dishes just 1 set tiny tubs whole order   flavoring everything very mild which may your taste    plus side everything tasted fresh light no 'old oil' taste   Every dish ordered lots onions portions look bigger side dishes onions   Perhaps would enjoy fried pork dishes more soup   feel place potential better  <EOR> I ordered Jja Jang myun Jjam Bong Tang su yuk  However Jja jang myun terrible because much water normal taste  looks JJa jang soup  Also server friendly  I think need improve food service  I visit them again soon  <EOR> Finally Korean chinese restaurant! love Korean food love chinese food  hearing place all excited!
