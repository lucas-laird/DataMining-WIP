My entire lunch ruined  Won't going back location  others said no wonder empty during peak lunch hour  <EOR> All time thought Baja Fresh fast food place comparable quality Del Taco but then office ordered lunch here  mind changed! quality higher fast food caliber produce fresh salads huge  None things say Del Taco Taco Bell   Menu tacos burritos nachos flautas bowls salads quite few them! Lots customization options sides include chips salsa guac cheese  Opted Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad chicken tortilla soup even though really wanted nachos   Salad huge fresh tons shrimp 8 10 tasty cilantro sauce least half avocado  Soup bit greasy side but ton chicken good overall flavor    Probably won't regular place but glad know quality better exterior suggests  <EOR> I ordered another Steak Fajitas usual very good rice the3 black beans  bell peppers onions great  <EOR> I same thing pretty much every time come honest come very often  always chicken Cesar salad burrito  location lacks consistency     food never taste same never even same ingredients say same customer service  Sometimes someone really nice sometimes someone doesn't seem interested doing    usually come Sunday's because store next them closed  want give them more starts because when right delicious but those things whenever order burrito don't know if going taste good bad  <EOR> I used come multiple times week but ever since new management quality food gone down  <EOR> I placed order location 11 am pickup 5 30 pm Liz apparently manager when came pick order wasn't even ready  guy working no idea order even placed  fault manager didn't relay message to Him  But alllll communication  If place order recommend confirming before driving it  Thanks guy handling situation fast getting order started ASAP <EOR> Absolutely discussing! guacamole Brown salsa bad  Customer service terrible reporting place kitchen filthy  recommend location possibility could sick  <EOR> I came Baja Fresh during Thursday evening   Atmosphere Nothing special Upon entering establishment almost empty  music background place pretty clean  workers didn't seem doing much because lack patrons present   Service Again nothing special I gave order cashier she gave receipt  She asked kind beans wanted burrito told black no complication all  No smile nothing ordinary made spectacular nor horrible   Food Bad Food Bad Sanitation practices This where visit takes turn worst  haven't Baja Fresh few years thinking visit would remind when liked them  salsa pretty good honest  However when nacho burrito failed tasted anything nacho like  looked into burrito notices little tortilla crisps but because moisture all other ingredients inside burrito lost crunch  also lack cheese flavor know cheese flavor would taste when nachos  really ruined knowing almost half burrito consisted beans  if added extra beans behind back  once order did mention beans other when asked type beans wanted  know food costing dragging food other ingredients last longer but RIDICULOUS   Oh yeah while eating workers coughed failed wash hands afterwards  gross that? If restaurant worker coughs open while preparing food never coming back branch again  Yes indeed cold season when visited but if you're sick STAY HOME    Overall Don't even think coming here This few Yelp reviews where type caps but think necessary emphasize points feelings  only positive thing say place would clean presentable public  Unfortunately lack sanitation practices willingness fill burrito halfway beans ruined perception Baja Fresh's reputation  never coming back shouldn't either  <EOR> I've eating Baja Fresh ever since first restaurant opened Newburry Park CA  always delicious even day all corporate buyouts brand ownership changes etc  recipes food quality remain same did all those years ago beginning during early 1990's  More specifically store Las Vegas West Lake Mead personal favorite just because now closest since recently moving but because incredible everything consistently tastes cleanliness restaurant itself fantastic staff service  Chipotle great but Baja original still best! <EOR> My diablo shrimp burrito easy beans enchilada style FFRAFRAFraaaarreeessshhh! Obviously writing tell am full   Why? Because exuding happiness! <EOR> Quick fast Mexican food tortilla chips best but guacamole pretty good friendly service location fish tacos always yummy burritos pretty good <EOR> Exceeded expectations  Food fresh very tasty  ordered steak shrimp fajitas plate  Highly recommended  Thank you <EOR> I baja fresh all time different location happened side town love food decided come location  messed order off top then made big hullabaloo charging correct price enchilado sryle when should just fixed it  husband exactly 5 soggy chips plate burrito  sent tostada salad back because dry lifeless barely sprinkle cheese it  literally grilled why sending back  didnt it! Simple that  could made way better home location sucks returning recommending resataurant anyone  Disappointing say least  <EOR> Not coming back all waste money time  Very disappointing  Dried tomatoes tomato salad dried salad black guacamole  Horrible <EOR> Came lunch husband coworkers thinking opened 10 30am  Its now 11 am still open  don't understand business doesn't hours posted  <EOR> Sadly FRESH all visit   Ordered shrimp steak burrito both old flaky crisp tortillas sitting around re heated  No bueno!  If ever return sure check freshness advertise request new fresh version   never problem before always fabulous one time thing   $15 two burritos even 'FRESH ?  Porfavor!  I frequent other BJMG Boca Park always great fresh food hopefully read watch quality control  <EOR> Ok start  Well walked greeted enthusiastically  really warm welcome happy there    I'm sure happened but did ordered  Yes should verified order receipt but ordered same thing many times  wanted battered fish tacos but grilled instead  good but looking forward today    I love salsa bar variety salsas Pico limes  healthy serving tortilla chips  Unfortunately think leftovers previous day since arrived shortly opened  stale  Blah    The set odd  main dining area then whole other side soda machine condiment area  Except no condiments sure soda machine worked over there  ceiling fans high blowing napkins around  music came few minutes arrived way loud    I believe cashier named Gregorio he highlight experience  Extremely nice enthusiastic  Other least favorite Baja Fresh date  <EOR> I'm basing review off two experiences didn't even food  ordered through third party delivery service where ordered Baja Burrito pork carnitas Chicken Quesadilla order Smoky Queso Fundido  When driver restaurant he called let know told carnitas  He put phone them lady VERY nice  She gave three options she could replace protein choice chicken beef white fish  told didn't really want beef white fish but could take chicken yet concern paid extra carnitas  next option shrimp the most expensive protein she totally happy add extra cheese no extra charge  She really made feel better order happy   Unfortunately third party driver called 7 minutes later flat tire! Apparently stars wouldn't Baja night  But alright made other arrangements third party company gave $10 00 coupon off next order troubles   So    last night tried again Baja using coupon little more  Exactly same order before only some added chicken taquitos side beans rice  Since through website called restaurant let them know wanted extra cheese no option website super okay no extra charge    The food arrived fresh delicious  taquitos still SUPER crispy yummy use real guacamole  burrito delicious absolutely loved smokey queso although such large portion really needed more chips tried quesadilla good nothing extraordinary chicken cheese     To sum food fresh tasty above beyond customer service ordering them again soon!! <EOR> Am only hater here?  store seemed really messy ultimo burrito or whatever called it soggy   Pretty sure could feed burrito 5 month old daughter pediatrician would objected    soggy is   also possible combination Cafe Rio combination plethora authentic Mexican Food city spoiled regards Mexican food   salsa really chunky too   know some people enjoy consistency good pico de gallo but really thing   Bottom line did enjoy lunch here   thought over priced quality got   southwest man   THE SOUTHWEST   Mexico 6 hours   you better Baja Fresh  <EOR> Every time come always order correct delicious tostada salad more decent service $2 coupon doing survey receipt  wait time little longer desirable but fresh hot food completely acceptable  salsa bar always well stocked clean just can't enough black salsa  spicy just good! able tear myself away tostada salad yet but few other things menu look good   Honestly am somewhat snobby authentic Mexican food  authentic but still very tasty more that  Also plentiful outdoor seating unlike other Bajas to  <EOR> What say Baja Fresh? used work near location quick place lunch o k  bad price  Relatively good food hot fast  Pretty good salsa bar    Hadn't Baja Fresh few years because more Mexican food places much better closer where live like Roberto's instance   Anyway April 3 some friends decided stop 7501 W  Lake Mead Summerlin location lunch  Big mistake! Place pretty empty lunch time  should told something   I wanted fish tacos menu board 2 choices  Wahoo  Crispy Wahoo    ordered 2 taco platter Crispy Wahoo taco shrimp taco  friend ordered meal she told Crispy Wahoo fried but grilled  O k  then sure girl counter knew wanted fried  asked why 2 different menu choices IF BOTH GRILLED? met same kind stare dog would given if I'd asked same question  reading another Yelp review ongoing problem apparently  menu choices need clear!  My order delayed  When wrong  forgot shrimp taco  When finally shrimp taco cold  friend's kid rolled tacos he said tasted soap  order also sent back  general manager day grouchy greatest moods  He acted didn't know talking about  He said No ever complained before! Whatever  new taco friend's kid also new meal but time didn't really want anything else    The counter girl server nice tried accommodating  complimentary chips pretty stale  pinto beans rice salsas decent  wouldn't recommend location  never back there  <EOR> It's pseudo Mexican fast food all but really Baja Fresh  Usually is  particular location's odd uninviting customer service just ruined me  really don't seem clue they're doing it  Not long ago ordering taco combo plate return because smothered sour cream for first time many visits   No big deal  Stuff happens right? Well everyone behind counter acted somehow fault  menus paper board plainly list all stuff comes each item  Sour cream listed neither place but acted being difficult only wanting advertised tacos  No crema? over over again  No   because doesn't come it! Granted Spanish but entire staff seemed spend next 10 minutes loudly debating situation cook rolling eyes server repeatedly checking paper menu proof mistake  Even 5th time still didn't say anything sour cream  say manager did quickly step in tell them remake food but even he seemed believe messed any way fault  Eh is  Everyone entitled off day right? Then last night when wife back made point just ahead avoid any possible confusion ordering food without sour cream that obviously isn't supposed come first place   doesn't come sir  ? Really? No shit? Well maybe should inform rest your staff because clearly didn't memo  Anyway when wife tried order small plate nachos cashier told only large plates left she order large nacho instead  wife asked why couldn't just put small portion larger plate appropriate price It wasn't fault stock order short but girl just smiled said something think mumbled Spanish cheerfully said No   that  Now neither experience some kind massive unbelievable offense but both rather frustrating far beyond textbook examples substandard lazy utterly unconcerned customer service  being said don't really see going back location any time soon  <EOR> Not sure BETTER!   the food service?  Every time stop location staff just welcoming  fast food service wouldn't necessarily expect but people work must love job because seems apparent  friendly every time  food always awesome  Fresh fast  Reasonably priced well  Love love love  <EOR> Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible <EOR> This breaks heart because used LOOOOOOOVE Baja Fresh  place dead  Guess should first clue  posted picture because sure speak volumes  Sad say officially off list  <EOR> Baja Fresh lake mead rocks! joined text message group email group am always getting specials promos BOGO really add value deal  Everything super fresh always prepared order spot healthful  <EOR> Great fresh food good service  more could ask for?
