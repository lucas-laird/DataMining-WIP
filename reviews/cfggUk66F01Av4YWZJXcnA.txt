Must try!!! <EOR> Worst experience ever! never back  felt ghost town  don't know surviving  theater servers friendly however bartender bar every thing ordered  food good though  All all don't see theater making it  <EOR> WASTE MONEY  Completely overpriced  if purse leave ticket counter!! said stop people bringing outside food which great way your customers feel criminals before done anything wrong  also found incredibly distracting through whole movie kept worrying where purse was  ordered popcorn seat but then server brought check during last 60 seconds movie which really ruined ending movie   would recommend going many other movie theaters upgraded seats but don't charge more tickets don't treat customers way  <EOR> My expectations Eclipse high let down due customer service while ordering food drink start movie   arrived 15 mins before movie started kiosk didn't recognize credit card print tickets then wait line service rep told kiosk would print tickets   need corrected take kiosk   I directly seat pushed service button took 10 mins waitress arrive take order then she started walk around theatre take everyone else's individual orders   First menu need non alcoholic drinks besides milkshakes   order Thai chicken flatbread chocolate shake   flatbread came two six inch pizzas chicken bbq sauce onion rings didn't taste Thai seasoning all   milkshake awful no taste even smooth very chucky bland taste   worthy $10 price tag   My food arrived 20 mins later start movie pretty last theater given first order     Waitress then handed bills everyone end movie didn't receive bill walk lobby inquire paying bill wait another 5 10 minutes them bring wrong bill advise them order more time before paying   Very cool concept but poorly executed     <EOR> I've theatre few times now really design vibe here   Also met owner seems very nice man cares business   Although rough ish area standard downtown theatre itself very clean modern   You enter purchase tickets first level take stairs or elevator second floor where theatres located   There's also nicely appointed bar area plenty seating   Another fun part theatre order food drinks your very comfy reclining seat  Prices fair is an upscale movie going experience   Service always friendly well   Overall everything pretty nice good experiences  give Eclipse Theaters 4 stars which gladly bump 5 soon long anticipated vegan menu available!!   <EOR> We decided try Groupon deal 2 tickets  2 drinks popcorn  overall experience just OK  place very clean staff nice  best thing place limited seating more intimate overcrowded experience     but you're definitely paying it  You purchase liquor bar far food snacks wait server Prepare wait wasn't busy when process getting two drinks no refills some basic theater popcorn terrible overpriced adult beverage literally took whole movie   As convenient is   it's definitely VERY DISTRACTING when your staff bringing item time everybody throughout entire movie  <EOR> Nice! Pretty close price theater downtown summerlin but much nicer more intimate  theater smaller seated around 40 guests really nice recliners excellent service  Food pricey but pricey expected  Happy hour helped  Free refills sodas nice touch  Parking easy  Didn't realize until home groupon we'll next time  Looking forward going back!

If your Vegas must! <EOR> In short disappointment  Way over priced low low quality  Also all reviews posted since initial review fake   I love theaters recliner seats  Green Valley Luxury first but many brands many locations  There's literally no other way see movie except maybe your Pj's your couch least favorite far    The recliners hardly recline large lump pad top forced neck uncomfortable angle maybe tall enough but definitely short! The food less okay  pulled pork sliders cold tasted stored plastic bag bread sub par  short rib flat bread inedible  crust around edge hard bite some kind topping he taste consistency wet dog food  drinks much potential fun ingredients  mule tasted little sprite lot lime mine tasted syrup nothing else  rosemary didn't translate drink all other look adding no flavor scent    The theater design decor very minimalist but cool funky way more budget design way  Right when walk greeter shakes hand introduction 'how doing' 'can help you' just 'hello' hand shake  If wanna chat briefly sincerely happy meet shake hand  habit shaking fun flu season gods sake many hands he touching before washing hands?  The theater servers quality brands ninjas here  server brought check reaching across boyfriend put table he shines flashlight food see if he could clear he table  okay  movie isn't over interrupting!!!  Picture quality just okay  Blurry times wasn't sharp sound wasn't anything special  4K tv 4K I read somewhere but knows I'm rooting iPic come vegas now  theater    I don't recommend won't back anytime soon  Hopefully act together increase he food quality server training <EOR> First things first theater sold mom tickets where seats already sold other people     fact oh will Let know if keep new seats just sat wtf?! even saying sorry but people prior gave seats which paid lmao?! then order alcohol seats call over radio each item see if even stock !! joke place mention 18$ ticket overpriced theater shifty service !

Love seats experience would definitely again date other special occasion! only real downfall location very odd no real signage parking opted street parking then found lot service usually quick attentive but lapsed little during show maybe being picky but don't dirty dishes around when dine when finished want empty plates gone !! plates stuck around most movie maybe being little OCD kept looking them distracted movie lol food opted flatbreads buffalo chicken Thai chicken both flavorful rather nice portions also apps which pretzel bites tasted microwaved cheese sauce bland fries tasty but side ketchup fry ratio pretty bad ended leaving half fries ! sangria fruity delicious recommend getting carafe better value ! All all nice experience would again !! <EOR> Great place ! Just ahead buy your tickets   Groupon currently deal including drinks popcorn   <EOR> Nice surprise am killing time while downtown   Decided catch movie found place Flixter   Driving im thinking no movie theatre here   Lo behold see it  Parked street walked in  machine bought chesp $12 ticket    Walked into salon   Small thestre recliner sofas   Nice snack menu     Same thing back home ticket $35  Great setup   Popcorn brougjt your seat good too  <EOR> probably won't back  early bar couple drinks just everything drink menu  girlfriend finally found all ingredients don't remember called but disgusting 13 bucks i think down drain  theater hot asked waiter twice if could turn ac something he sweating himself said he'd already asked  food decent best  Its very unorganized feels cheap dirty expecting   Maybe just organized real bartenders better menu then place could alright   The theater itself ok seats comfortable sound good NO KIDS! <EOR> Came during Fifty Shades Freed opening weekend hopes nice date night  theater equal parts garbage movie itself  Boyfriend orders large popcorn within five minutes being seated via armrest button which summons server  Gives said server $10 bill  Over 30 minutes roll without any sign food being served anywhere  Pushed button again asked different server when could expect popcorn curtly told haven't started serving food yet  Oh really? Maybe popcorn made to order theater which would only reason could possibly think why popcorn grouped same category chicken fingers burgers served alongside them  Ridiculous  Wait ANOTHER 30 minutes before noticing everyone including couple next three popcorns received food not  popcorn people  Pushed damn button again tell server waiting over HOUR popcorn hasn't come please give money back  Okay she says without care concern world  No apology given  Another 15 minutes rolls while watch same server walking down aisles distributing bills wrapping orders  actual ****  Call AGAIN ask where hell refund is  Oh she didn't bring yet? say 'she'???? asked YOU! Wait another 15 minutes $10 bill come back us  No popcorn no apology pure B S  Cool concept failed execution poor customer service  Many other luxury theaters around valley executing very same business model style grace  Yours sucks  <EOR> Very nice clean movie theater  very intimate place movie since very much seating room  seats recline very comfortable  mention your snacks brought right you  Just press button order watch your food come you  snack selection very big but still good  bit more pricey regular movie theater but definitely worth it  <EOR> What high quality theater   Great bar lounge   Great service   food good if just little bit better 5 stars had   back! <EOR> Pricey 18$ per ticket?! Yes place nice recliner seats serve food while movie going on  Also rent whole theater special events!
