Read some reviews prior visit decided give try  only located neighborhood also very good  Came all eat lunch really enjoyed it  Everything fresh service excellent very friendly likable staff  definitely back! PS offer free beer sake purchase all eat buffet    AWESOME! <EOR> Let preface entire review today saying Sushi Katsu still soft opening phase anything say could potentially change grand opening two weeks   Having said new restaurant lot potential could great addition valley's ecosystem ayce sushi joints   I came Monday noon ayce lunch experience quite interesting say least   feels going friend's house whose family happens great sushi inviting join them lunch   There's just homey hospitable feel going supposed other established restaurants where all employees dedicated tasks   In Sushi Katsu single wait staff also kitchen staff made appetizers reminds grandma golden years she'll just keep telling eat more shy   sushi chefs equally friendly enthusiastic   very interested knowing thought food compared other sushi places town   I ordered omakase entusted palette chef dutifully obliged   able sample all nigiri stock plus roll  menu   fish fresh prepared skillfully tasted great!  nigiri style reminds Sushi Rainbow purist minimalist only fish top sushi rice appropriate portion wasabi     There's nothing wrong pre sauced nigiri which when done properly quite delicious ie  Sakana's nigiri  However appraise fish quality much more accurately if there's already sauce   also sampled gyoza shumai per previous reviewer's recommendations found them excellent quality   miso soup edamame just ok   Last menu item worth mentioning single order sashimi if choose $19 95 ayce option menu   sashimi yummy though wish hamachi too!  just awesome even order sashimi ayce price   Btw several ayce pricing tiers beyond 16 95 19 95 mentioned reviews thus far   Please see uploaded pics     Because place still soft opening feel unfair rank them against other established sushi places Vegas   Let just say Katsu isn't complete restaurant yet more work progress   Things changing may total consistency yet   perspective see makings nice new unpretentious ayce sushi restaurant rooting them succeed! <EOR> Came cousin  big sushi fanatic thought we'd try place  Staff employees very friendly professional  Did all eat course  Saw sign front store getting free sake beer all eat   asked sake beer  Which great well sushi   Ordered some seaweed salad poke  Followed dragon roll crunchy roll loved it  Asked sushi chef if he could special hand roll any raw fish  delicious hand roll tuna salmon w veggies  The guy greeted walked recommended some things menu  Appetizers etc  miso soup oyster shooters  oyster shooters really good fresh    Overall place clean staff cool  I'd definitely would back again <EOR> Not surprised see place closed little relieved  They Groupon clearly hurting business  Shit talking your existing customers generally doesn't encourage more people give try see management's response Paul G's review  alone dropped typical 3 star mediocre rating bottom barrel single star   Menu small many specialty rolls even when order them small  Take seems hassle location but dining would take century half   Fish freshest pricing par places better quality  many other places city sushi better more variety sans attitude problem  Good riddance  <EOR> Great all eat sushi reasonable prices! friendly staff's commitment  customer service evident  <EOR> They tried really did  group people WANT see leave satisfied feel them want see them succeed but everything just doesn't connect   First all needed hire interior decorator  Walking into place ordeal metal fence front which understand outside dining but just looks terrible  Then walking inside experience cold office fluorescent lighting tables benches which reminds old deli well office space early 90's   menu confusing disorganized say least well   Food nigiri good  few choices salmon tuna white  Good size pieces good flavor  5 special roll options another 10 standard roll options  few but only memorable Spicy Crunch roll  few positives doesn't rest follies  problem same price head Yama Sakana even Sushi Trop WAY better experience food quality    It nice see sushi place side town need excited try place  Unfortunately feel fall victim rest startups around start sacrificing quality quantity      As final note said beginning people nice try serve but need something connect dots someone help them succeed change things around  <EOR> This first last visit Sushi Katsu  stopped yesterday because van parked street sign which advertises clam chowder  Upon entering asked manager took order if own chowder thought unusual item sushi house  He assured homemade said ok try love good chowder     While waiting soup looking fish sushi bar  was thinking ordering some sushi soup  noticed some fish under  plastic wrap glass cooler where prepare sushi from  dated 12 20 13  date visit 12 27 13!!!!!!!!!    brought attention sushi chef standing behind sushi bar doing nothing only customer restaurant   He said someone forgot change just looked other way  He did even  look try verify fresh     point decided would even consider eating sushi  fish sushi bar least week!!!!!!!!!!! WTF???   Ok manager comes clam chowder   obviously from Campbell's Chunky soup asked again if homemade  He said yes but he didn't right pot in            WTF???????????   taking 3 spoon fulls reached into pocket put down money pay for soup walked out   Canned soup unacceptable restaurant and I don't being lied to  also don't seeing food restaurant date preparation week old     Although usually just write reviews restaurants find exceptional feel necessary write review far worst restaurant experience remember  food horrid lied observed outdated food sushi bar  now know why only customer place NEVER AGAIN  <EOR> We came lunch last week   coupon purchased online thought we'd try place   visit started off badly when arrived place handwritten sign saying All Groupons must reservations phone number listed   stood outside 100 degree Las Vegas heat called reservation   asked when wanted eat wife told them standing outside lunch   told manager wasn't could call different phone number talk manager?  did   Again wife asked if could reservation told person phone lunch   He said would over 15 minutes   Say what?  sure presence restaurant eating lunch   wife asked inside order    Yes may   Sheesh!   So went   nice lady promptly seated only customers lunch time a bad sign?    ordered la carte sushi Groupon Menu huh?! quickly given water drink   10 minutes ordered young man showed table headphones on   manager perhaps?  sure he didn't introduce himself but he wanted know coupon   He took coupon   So all sushi came out   seemed decent actually but wants through all order few sushi rolls?  place likely close within couple months due bad reputation no business   I feel bad waitress she seemed nice polite   I definitely would come back  <EOR> I took some friends last night hoping expose even more people favorite sushi spot but really disappointed learn no long offer all you can eat Nigiri sushi!  nice enough serve nigiri last night even though no longer menu but let know would last time   can't tell disappointing me   rolls kitchen menu items outstanding but being able AYCE nigiri sushi means won't going back   Don't wrong if rolls only person great place but finding favorite place burgers fries now serves only fries!  Sorry guys miss great sushi wonderful staff  <EOR> Saw across way Walgreens Plaza decided stop try 'em out  place nice clean but still puts off hole in the wall vibe  Regardless nice relaxed vibe currently doesn't many customers during lunch definitely liking haha  lady sat very nice took care entire time  She gave bunch lunch options choose ie  all care lunch specials but interesting part Sushi Katsu way AYCE options structured  two AYCE options B  option lower priced AYCE option consisted only rolled hand roll sushi plus limited appetizer menu $16 95 lunch $19 95 dinner   B option boasted bigger menu which included nigiri addition rolled sushi expanded appetizer menu larger option  many options consider but ended going option A    Overall sushi pretty good  Wasn't freshest fish but definitely worse  am fan Katsu's crispy rolls crispy albacore FTW spicy tuna roll  Personally thought could've dialed spicy little more based high tolerance all things spicy but still came across well  Made sure touch yellowtail roll some salmon rolls good measure didn't disappoint  waitress also hooked some baked mussels wasn't appetizer menu option came little bit mayo touch ikura  Again freshest tasted but downed them pretty quickly nonetheless    Not shabby Sushi Katsu! food good service even better  back follow option B check nigiri offerings  Solid effort Katsu looking forward next outing  <EOR> Just stopped lunch special 911 roll level 10  Hooo weee should rename 91run roll  special spice super hot!!! Friendly staff under $7 lunch special can't that  <EOR> great food nice people   looking fwd  returning  <EOR> Great little hole wall Sushi place   Great Food Fresh Fish very friendly staff    PS   only place where eat fresh Sushi rip microphone some Rick James Super Freak! Karaoke <EOR> This place great!! Family owned  fresh fish amazing roll great prices  <EOR> Great food great service !! Friendly staff good quality food  laws Hawaii very impressed <EOR> I came group friends because wanted try something new said why not   few days later regretting decision having tried place unfortunately   FOOD First big fan sushi all types but far worst experience sushi stand point   friends order quite bit nigiri each piece fish warmer should considered safe eat  fish supposed colder but wasn't very off putting   also ordered some oyster shooters luckily those cold   options overall seem very short many choices rolls hand rolls overall size rolls tiny 1 5 inches diameter    But warm nigiri sick two days later eating it   wasn't fresh whatsoever biggest complaint restaurant   SERVICE We large group understandably would fall behind credit them trying keep up   But when waitress comes says remind ordered initially placed order  unacceptable   There's reason pad paper keep track orders   food would come 15 20 minutes initial order   If really want business big groups need prepare themselves better   AMBIANCE It did feel traditional sushi restaurant   decor bland big screen tv showing some PBS programming placement sushi bar itself rest tables seemed awkward   layout didn't seem sense sure if  due them being fairly new poor planning     I coming back restaurant regardless if friends invite join them   No offense guys but I'd rather pay more reputable sushi experience cheap place find myself nauseous few days later  <EOR>
