Great pizza cold beer watch Hockey could better?! <EOR> Hannah most amazing waitress joint  highly recommend sit section! <EOR> This place really good food the rasberry chipotle sauce amazing! pricing affordable service sometimes slow  <EOR> Ate simply because playing hockey tournament attached ice arena  isn't 1st time playing tournament rink all very happy bar updated  much cleaner food better wait staff much friendlier  Looking forward coming back next year  <EOR> As far ambiance Brooksy's Bar Grill does one other local bars west Flamingo its vast amount entertainment  only enjoy multiple television screens well projector screen during game time but also if bored always ice rink located south side restaurant visible through thick wall clear plastic    However  pretty much best part Brooksy's  Some menu items stand well but overall service unbelievably awful time time again unless you're regular buys wait staff shots during shift then you're probably going very lucky establishment   If venture more handful times try give place 2nd 3rd 4th 5th chance you'll most likely want avoid bar altogether grab seat restaurant portion open floor plan  Just keep mind can't smoke restaurant part regardless though ventilation system isn't nicest you'll walking through smoke way but norm Vegas    If you've made far enough you're mood some pizza choose between Great White Buffalo Chicken  Great White made garlic basil well two types cheeses  Buffalo Chicken pretty delicious chunks freshly grilled chicken tossed hot sauce baked into golden crust  If you're meat eater meatballs homemade accompany bowl piping hot spaghetti marina tucked into French loaf sandwich style option  Trying watch your waistline? Then Chopped Salad your favorite vinaigrette comes ham olives onions tomatoes lettuce   Again unless you're playing hockey rink watching someone play rink planning getting your food just avoid Brooksy's altogether  There's plenty other places where ambiance delicious food service offered  <EOR> Hey Brooksys love place ever since Groupon   great food drink prices shuffleboard fun too!  only thing missing would friends frequent much more often if could play Buzztime trivia your place   want someplace other Buffalo Wild Wings eat play trivia!
