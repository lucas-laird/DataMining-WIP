Must try! definitely back see Gina! try food course! <EOR> Very disappointed new owner changing everything  East Ocean which served dim sum carts now become muddled mess especially rebranding something generic Asia Palace   no longer serve proper dim sum but made things order  Everything tasted bland microwaved  Even sesame balls which previously best just horribly mediocre now   And they've removed chicken feet! Incredible  literally just crossed menu   It's massive disrespect once best dim sum Vegas area  would recommend anybody even people don't particularly care dim sum much  Spend your money elsewhere  <EOR> Limited dim sum selections four dishes picked taste common SWEET   chow fun expensive overloaded sweetener   don't mind paying $12 small plate rice noodle without meat if tasted decent   Maybe don't fusion taste bud   Phoenix Talons chicken feet fried glutinous rice dumplings overly sweet   rice dumplings looked tasted re fried   also ordered xiaolongbao steam buns XLB 3 pieces nestled individual foil container looked very much ones sold Trader Joe's   3 XLB's looked identical machine made hand made   asked waitress usual vinegar dip julienne ginger   She responded don't use    She came back landed bottle red vinegar look attitude some village bumpkins don't know XLB's are   same waitress came back placed order slip table made loud tap fingers   am sorry sophisticated diners offended establishment   companion told Asia Palace renovated joint but think owner should pay more attention food service  <EOR> The old East Ocean restaurant under different name   Similar setup same employees few new staff  Dim sum menu pictures prices but half crossed off pen indicating restaurant does serve items  much dim sum order  No tea selection just jasmine tea which $1 50 per person   You order dim sum available steam trays rolling around most dim sum restaurants  ordering dim sum arrived very quick  course food already made hours ago not made order even safe temperature consumption just disappointing room temperature food poisoning environment  Dim sum texture overcooked bland tasting  2 star rating friendly staff no food poisoning yet   <EOR> Friendly service delicious food best Chinese food since moving Las Vegas place under new management Gina did great job back <EOR> The new Asia Palace beautiful inside   Calming background music private dining areas larger parties white table cloths   main attraction however food!   started few dim sum excellent flavor texture   Then came spicy Szechuan beef broccoli savory delicious followed best tofu mushrooms vegetables ever had   Finally shrimp noodles which terrific!  thing apparent quality ingredients no aftertaste beef which other Chinese restaurants chemically tenderized   No MSG either!

Tasted done two days before     uneatable   Hot Sour soup much vinegar must added just being served   no Dim Sum   lunches good crossed off list   won't last much longer rate  <EOR> Saturday night 8pm when decided two favorite dishes first visit  Consistency important tonight place failed deliver Lemon chicken Seafood Fried noodles  The chicken tough overcooked  delicious succulent first visit  seafood fried noodles fishy salt water ocean taste   Yikes back because price fails deliver value  $29 worth being dissatisfied  <EOR> Where start? Well first looking East Ocean saw Yelpers reported closed   then found replaced Asia Palace    No big deal appears same restaurant Chinese food Dim Sum   Well when came less handful Yelp reviews of which no good anyway but figured I'd give them chance   Very regretfully brought friend really likes dim sum family here   Seems cleaned place little bit tried little more classy   greeted few familiar faces old East Ocean restaurant also note dim sum menu still says East Ocean it    Apparently Asian Fusion restaurant also serves dim sum Well anyway dim sum asked dim sum menu   Other yelpers correct don't push carts around anymore which part dim sum experience anyway    half items menu crossed off marker   WTH   no chicken feet no congee among other things   proceeded try few items crossed out   let's just say items normally steaming hot now taste microwaved fried items well   fried hell   Big disappointment   pretty much figured they've eliminated items take long time prepare replaced them things could fry microwave quickly   Oh also another big disappointment couldn't wouldn't serve tap water health reasons     does mean your water isn't even safe drink let alone cook with? Good thing talked couple into buying Cokes but where did water come ice cubes?  Way place look fancy bar area roped off wannabe classy dining area completely destroy food   sure would cool place hang but food menu water situation mess   surprised health inspector hasn't shut them down having non potable water   disappointment going once best dim sum restaurant side town   Mark words place going downhill fast   least waitress nice   Run away <EOR> We've gone before dim sum when another name and or owner  pretty good handful times went  came back first time since name or ownership change disappointment!  So dim sum  What's first thing comes mind when describing dim sum? carts? family  guess what? NO CARTS  confused  server came asked wanted order almost immediately seated  gave page laminated menu pictures names dim sum options but heck!!!!! messed   Obviously threw off but just kind set weird vibe rest meal  guess can't deal change lol  two tables next left while still eating both checks listed items didn't order heard them both dispute it  Thankfully ours correct  food ok came almost instantly kind wondered possible but then didn't really want think much lol   We won't come back need dim sum carts! <EOR> The food ok but need bring back dim sum   only dim sum place side town  <EOR> Nice clean environment  Music soothing  Food delicious server Rogelio wonderful!!! didn't ask drink refill checked several times  lunch menu sweet sour chicken mangolian beef fried rice egg flour soup egg role  All delicious including egg flour soup  There's cute section separated beaded curtains small party  Tables covered clothe dishes nice contemporary  Wish took pictures!!! next time! <EOR> What joke manager told waiter tell customer giving away glass wine free front table  check saw she charge double tea also ask if guys dont serve dim sum why still sign Dim Sum? she told its enough time take down means its false advertisement  Everthing menu increased  price compare before manager's name Jenny  never back place again  also recommend anyone all  <EOR> Honestly first time eating Chinese food loved it  wife loves Chinese food trying try years finally did  Couldnt happier decision   Had cashew chicken curry chicken loved both  chili oil table also great   Thalia server she very helpful picking food safe around glutin allergy  absolutely back   Loved it!! <EOR> Dim sum Asian fusion lounge should've just called Asian fusion lounge specially since only Dim sum served potstickers! Talk variety  Lol only reason why place dim sum but whatever  Lmao   We decided stay least try other food  food alright Mandarin pork chop some pot stickers veggie rolls  really wasn't anything special  Portions decent size but kinda pricey  only standout Beef Sirloin Hot Pot really good  beef tender flavorful  pot stickers weren't anything special kinda meh tbh   Place nice clean Service ok seated few mins came waiter did job but kinda just let thing food served  didn't really bother but might bother some people  <EOR> This place gone waaaaay downhill since changing management  regular customer East Ocean years horribly disappointed when tried Asia Palace  First off entire time restaraunt workers ? unapologetically drilling right next us  didn't even seem think might bother customers  seems fixing all empty chairs no sitting probably because no wants subjected earful drilling sounds while trying eat   Additionally things even better food horrendously mediocre  price paid which cheap expected least decent food but definitely case  wonton noodle soup ordered felt freshly unfrozen plopped some lukewarm chicken stock  also discovered burnt pieces knows fried rice  might better off having Panda Express honest  Overall horrible ambience disappointing food  While sad lose regular lunch spot would definitely recommend steering clear place  <EOR> The best lemon chicken had! All entrees delish newly remodeled decor beautiful service A+  neighborhood treasure  <EOR> I Asia Palace because really only Chinese restaurant area in laws only eat Chinese food   saw other reviews but decided brave since ANY Chinese food better unhappy laws    To surprise did pretty good job food   Asia Palace serves some pretty authentic Chinese food   Yes other reviews mention lack Dim Sum variety which true   ordered straight off regular menu which good 100+ items    even ordered roast duck which only took them 15 mins whip up   set some expectations future visitors just don't army carts old ladies yelling Su mai!! see other dim sum places   regular menu if want some good food   The 2 stars service which practically inexistent   takes really long time flag down server   asked if wanted tea   when already tea table   people most friendliest   Dare say  authentic Chinese restaurant?  When paid collected CC then forgot us   course also couldn't anyone's attention   ended walking front counter pay  <EOR> Justin server saved stay place  He amazing accommodating provided premiere service  Recommended try salt pepper chicken actually liked it  Thank green tea ice cream  <EOR> This place some very tasteful dishes    loved Kung pao chicken noodle dishes !!!!
