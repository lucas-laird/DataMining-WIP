As Cal girl frequenting restaurants Little Ethiopia Fairfax District years  recent transplant made finding good spot Las Vegas missions  visited place last week when missing LA feeling little blue    I read few reviews decided brave but chip shoulder since think know good Ethiopian food when taste it  walked bar order food go    The bartender immediately knew California welcomed Hell pet name Las Vegas   She took order gave complimentary tea which deliciously spiced little sweet    The food took while but when order home disappointed  ordered vegetarian combination fish  total around $10 00 portions right on! three pieces fried fish which thought would but loved generous amount injera offered white wheat bread but said hell no that! plate loaded typical Ethiopian veggies lentils    Long story short come back  food well priced well spiced bartender friendly  don't miss LA much now! <EOR> Ive big fan Ethiopian food awhile now love way combine traditional spices create unique dishes flavorful  favorite dish order call kitfo special gore gore   Kitfo special amazing dish serve raw medium cook  Its mince meat flavored ethiopian butter niter kibe red pepper powder mimita love raw whenever meskerem  sure call advace if your planning taking cause take foreverrrrrr cook lolz  Trust this!  day wait 45 mins food brought almost fell asleep waiting  Now know better  Overall great food! But horrible wait time haha <EOR> Great food attentive service fun music  only negative slightly shabby decor but easily forgotten once delicious food arrives  Personally vegetarian combination platter  Scrumptious    try it! <EOR> This first experience eating Ethiopian food   fun communal experience dinner club ate hands getting food center table   ordered combination platter sample variety food which enjoyed   friend Ethiopian wine which smell wasn't use but different me   Service fine waitress friendly   She educated order   did notice roach bathroom crawling sink  hope exterminate   place old strip mall doesn't look most visually appealing area near strip but its hidden ethnic joint Las Vegas foodies  <EOR> After 2 days sub mediocre conference food nearby hotel desperate something real something vegetarian beyond cheese pizza  Meskerem satisfied perfectly  fancy fact rather dingy  strip mall just off Las Vegas Blvd  next sorts down on your luck stores might usually find strip mall  But does matter because Meskerem delicious food restore you  ordered vegetarian sampler platter although cryptically called something else menu   arrived plenty delicious injera bread mop varieties lentils greens spread even more injera  kept eating eating feeling more more restored each bite  Then little worried all those lentils greens might digestion  However nothing worry about  most satisfying meal during stay Las Vegas  Leaving restaurant felt refreshed ready tackle another day exciting powerpoint presentations! <EOR> This place amazing! tried several places far best  good  weekly basis  order Kaywot which beef comes salad injera  Also always courteous  <EOR> My first Ethiopian experience!  Delish   solo just beef kifto which oh yummy   insisted cooking beef little bit wasn't fully raw   did chickpea dish  think another reviewed noted year ago sure why still menu   Service great even though laughed knowing eat waitress deigned demonstrate eating first bite food! Her English wasn't great    Gotta love  totally into place this  <EOR> This great find while attending conference strip   cheap flavorful vegetarian friendly basically opposite everything else within few block radius   fellow conference attendees really overwhelmed them dinner service suffered bit but sure better most nights  <EOR> this place popular locals particularly ethnic locals   the food quite authentic understand  many Ethiopian restaurant experiences place isn't BEST but very far worst   the food more home cooking style very cheap  patron over 5 years  best place quiet cozy dark atmosphere late night hours healthy ingredients  staff incredible friendly accommodating vegetarian vegan diets   i highly recommend place casual first dates <EOR> If Las Vegas always point eat Meskerem Restaurant food never fails impress   Usually order Veggie combo which comes bunch stuff neither name nor figure but all wonderful  served injera crazy fun spongy flat bread  peel off chunks bread use scoop food  staff give look disdain if ask fork just eat your hands  Apologies mother raised pick chicken clean fork knife  But time when ambled lunch buffet set up  much same stuff veggie combo plus soup chicken dish beef stew beef cabbage thing  buffet soda set back only $10  course amazing again    Looks live music night which might worth checking out  But remember Vegas venues charge extra 10% Live Entertainment Tax if there's even guy playing kazoo loudly corner   I Haile recommend place  Addis Aba bomb!

Okay  jahlicious  You're welcome  <EOR> Not really impressed but new food unique taste  Honestly going try again  <EOR> I back  only guest restaurant thought service would good  wrong  waitress helpful slow  took 5 minutes water 30 minutes basic salad The food came 30 minutes salad  food me  chance willing trying new cuisine  bread cold spongy  food very greasy  lentils good  hope don't upset stomach  When came time bill wrong  pointed mistake waitress because didn't add up  bill clear all  She did add wrong even second time front which came another wrong price She would explain bill well  paid bill even though wrong warn people pay close attention check when arrives  <EOR> The food delicious people work friendly  walked brutal hellscape Las Vegas into inviting home just cooked dinner community  $10 buffet?

<EOR> Good food  Quiet place  Shy waitress but friendly  Left satisfied! <EOR> This ethiopian food place may ask could be?  But if try craving bread maybe 2 3 times year once your head it     I cannot easily describe soft airy bread bit sour flavor but sour bad way   hold bread hand tear pieces off use pieces scoop goodness platter front you   goodness you   Read menu well enjoy open mind   You may hear lot ruckus next door but no worries just bunch cabbies playing bad pool!

I recommend place vegetarians looking something different near strip  <EOR> I Thursday early afternoon   many others noted only there  third Ethiopian restaurant tried Vegas say liked best  Good size portions believe first time offered hot sauce    Hot sauce collard greens injera bread = amazing  am vegetarian did try meat dishes  opted vegetarian platter   Waiter attentive without being overbearing  watched news huge tv felt home  Very comfortable  going back  <EOR> I really liked restaurant 1 100 chance would ever found it   Tucked away east strip pretty empty strip mall place lot character food service very good   Ethiopian food before but never Vegas back! <EOR> I never tried Ethiopian food before but wanting seeing someone eat YouTube  planned trip Vegas then thought later wonder if Ethiopian food there? place very close strip 2 miles MGM Grand  ordered food did take little while but staff very friendly  liked food very interesting but time experience  knows maybe try again  paid $9 food very filling  ordered veggie platter without fish  <EOR> Fourth Ethiopian restaurant month think safely say good share Vegas Ethiopian food tastes like   Meskerem Ethiopian Restaurant most lighted four visited thus far   actually natural light shining which restaurant feel less club disco   On Friday night only diner before party three showed up   time left couple non Ethiopian other diner Ethiopian arrived   Starting off know best love is * #3  Kitfo Chopped lean beef seasoned butter mitmita   Served injera ayb cottage cheese prepared desire raw labilb medium well done  $9 ordered raw course  And really learning surprise waitress when say want raw because guess aren't used hearing non Ethiopians wanting raw  generous portion she poured three sections injera bread   favorite everything else ate   * #5  Yebeg Alicha Mild lamb stew delicately seasoned cooked spiced garlic ginger other house spices  $9 meat stew time chose because 'wetter' per waitress   came two chunks lamb more goat few other pieces   bit gamey tasting wasn't particular favorite   Husband said he probably wouldn't order again because wasn't special   * #11  Yetsom Migb Vegetarian combination fish split lentil  $9 menu misprint there's really no fish veggie combo   included salad red lentils green lentils yellow beans steamed potatoes cabbage carrots collared greens   bit disappointed because usually love lentils spices use it   time lacked little something   okay but actually leftovers once   didn't same explosion flavors other Ethiopian restaurants to   Service okay only waitress when first arrived   She very sweet although bit over efficient wiping down table taking water glasses before left table   did try inquire any Ethiopian coffee since saw cups laid near TV but waitress pointed coffee maker behind bar  didn't see any kind Ethiopian coffee ceremony listed menu figured didn't offer it   Overall decent restaurant Ethiopian food had   But if craving kitfo veggie combo would probably elsewhere  <EOR> Omfg let enjoy! Eat your hands  Learn thank Amharic before go Amesegënallô feminine <EOR> A cab driver mentioned place  He said all Ethiopian cabbies shift because open till 2 AM  I never Ethiopian food but when wife told Ethiopian restaurants offer raw meat interest definitely piqued   The place small only ones there  The woman served also owner she nicest most patient knowledgeable server ever had  She explained all dishes but only interested trying raw beef  The bread favorite thing but honestly say nothing ever tasted before  Spongy sour learned cooked just poured onto flat surface left set  The raw meat reminiscent steak tar tar except huge portion  I would preferred little less seasoned but server told next time should order different raw dish would better suit taste   My wife ordered some vegetarian plate didn't taste any dish but worth looked good   They also owned little shop next door server walked introduced relatives behind counter  server nice  There little room back billiards table but rules game complicated me  wasn't regular pocket billiards  The service excellent can't fault them food being particularly suited taste  The food fresh healthy going back try some other dishes  <EOR> DELICIOUS Ethiopian vegan food! Good service nice restaurant good prices  Really close strip staying Circus Circus could easily walk there  <EOR> This first time eating Ethiopian food   think authentic? servers didn't speak much English but made experience wonderful! can't remember ordered but know liked everything ordered and everything people table ordered well   really cool because don't eat silverware use sour dough bread dip into sauce! service great food tasted delicious! <EOR> I stopped Meskerem during CES 2013 stayed nearby Riviera  vegetarian loved food here  bad located bit off strip  decor needs some update but food really good cares decor  If spicy food ask some extre berbere sauce  <EOR> The food pretty darn good   But general lack decor which allowed wild echos well stark lighting detracted experience   coupled odd location empty strip mall kinda weird   Maybe 3 5 stars overall   But did food The food 4 0 stars Overall very good!  But all fairly cold   If hotter would tasted better   Red Lentils 4 5 stars Slightly underdone but great spicy flavor   Yellow Lentils 4 stars A great change taste vs red very unique tangy flavor   Cabbage 4 stars Fresh tangy   Green Beans 4 0 stars Delicious   Never served Ethiopian restaurant before   Salad 3 stars Pretty plain but refreshing   Injera Bread 4 stars More whole wheat like or Teff both color texture   Quite good   thicker version used tray quite sour almost much    PS also prepared leisurely meal   don't lot rushing here  <EOR> Excellent! where friends once month so  Veggitarian platter world! fish fillets #12 enough two people  staff very friendly attentive  glad found place  <EOR> Disclaimer first Ethiopian experience  don't know if score unjust because don't know if ethiopian food just not  Generally everything  sounds right but if try another place feel Ethiopian food more re review    I walked super excited trying Ethiopian food first time  wasn't even familiar expect  glanced over menu pretty much decided ask waitress recommend whatever she thought best   My friend Veggie Combo Meat Combo described GASTRONOMICAL ADVENTURE turn down?! seriously? I asked if much food two she said wasn't  Well food came TON food   Both dishes came same platter  veggies along edges platter meats middle all portioned top bread   My friend describes bread elephant ears which reason why wanted try Ethiopian food  doesn't want try something reminds them elephant ears?! Okay maybe average joe but  peaked interest  But bread pretty much unleavened bread thats super porous  actually really really good    The whole experience very interesting  eat your hands take bread use grab veggies meat mixtures  only part didn't thought all portions food very bland but just might just food supposed taste?   I also thought food WAY much food  friend barely made dent portions veggies meat  would enough food two if would just ordered one   I just wished waitress would told us  <EOR> 1st Ethiopian meal    Loved buffet although am usually very wary  good sign when walk into ethnic restaurant populated folks look may country origin  Don't love weird bread but okay because everything else great  food fresh flavorful plentiful   $8 can't beat  ate Marriott hotel room around corner but would back stay once inside restaurant fine  area tad seedy but adds adventure right?  Not thrilled tons travelling now doing work but am comforting myself idea am going lot fun yelping way around Vegas! Oh beet sald ans sambusas great  <EOR> This restaurant absolute best service yet any Ethiopian restaurant   waitress limited English but way answer all questions   like really liked Ethiopian tea she over market side grab spices   whole difficult time understanding if should grind them steep them whole   She took spices into kitchen ground them me   Such sweetheart     Ok food   Only particular item ordered enough grease soak through plate injera   overall felt healthy   group 4 ordered veggie platter lamb platter   Both incredibly good definitely enough all us   favorite lamb plate   only thing surprised veggie platter didn't any mesir wat   sad menu didn't contain mushroom shiro   Tej good but more fragrant varieties   Overall great service great food   hope more ppl come appreciate gem  <EOR> I love place  Used come often when layover hotel nearby  Took friend last night  Love could Ethiopian food midnight  vegetarian combo variety lentils chickpeas cabbage  also beef chilies   honey wine tasted homemade  little fizzy tangy  enjoyed even though different used to  always food great service sweet though relaxed  <EOR>
