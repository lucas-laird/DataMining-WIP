Luckily another girl came told two seats bar opened could them  helped because could actually see place weren't smelling smoke casino any longer    So ordered truffle burger onion rings sweet potato fries  Both sides delicious  burger specifically said would medium waiter said  chef recommended  Unfortunately received rare burger entirely bright pink center  waiter looked said he'd back cooked right way  another 20 mins passed already eaten sides  Can't say wasn't annoying  when second burger came back charred  wanted cry    So ended getting shake because still hungry  playful huge shake great    If sit inside restaurant you'll probably much better experience guess just unlucky twice overpriced inedible burger  Keep mind burgers average $18  <EOR> Was coming back down strip made pitstop into Venetian quick bite eat  But where should eat when you're Venetian?

Black Tap plain simple expensive but point where docking stars  Vegas admit portions massive before complaining $15 00 shake $20 00 burger fries  Star    Stars 3 4 food?  So everything fell apart  burger fries onion rings all weak burger relied heavily upon mediocre toppings flavor fries limp devoid flavor Bam Bam Shake more optics anything else  No Stars    Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  I'll still try track down visit original NYC location but skip Vegas rendition going forward  No Star  <EOR> This place fun hangout atmosphere  Definitely more street style pub yummy twist crazy milkshakes  hamburgers thick patty's cooked order  both decided Texan burger big Texas say least  topped meal off Colorful Cake Shake exceeded expectations! heafty piece confetti cake real cake batter mixed into shake cherry top  We'd most definitely visit again most definitely recommend anyone! only set back price  We're willing pay good food but hard time paying over $15 burger fries burgers start $16 $20  terribly priced but quite hoping for  also split shake because little spendy $15   I'd probably suggest splicing shakes anyways since very large full yummy toppings! <EOR> This review 4 5 stars   Pretty damn good burger   Milkshakes photo worthy sides appetizers tasty   Though burgers steep $16 22 depending meat toppings came healthy portion fries different side extra $2   Greg Norman wagyu patty blue cheese pickle tomato added egg onion broccoli premium side   burger huge filling   Meat definitely did taste better typical patty fried egg perfect pop   broccoli nice side Chinese twist better your typical fries   table tried bunch sides sauces sweet potato fries stood did aioli sauce Korean sauce close second   milkshakes good unhealthy advertised   They're big enough and expensive enough meal its own but you're Vegas worth it   Black Tap sits patio side overlooking canal strip sports book other   Really prime location Casino quick service   Wine super expensive actually Chardonnay when ate 6pm Monday really?   beer fine but nothing spectacular though $9 IPA actually quite good deal strip   Black Tap better burgers strip could much worse sustenance drinks  <EOR> My daughter looking forward coming 18th Birthday  great dinner fantastically sugary cotton candy milkshake!
