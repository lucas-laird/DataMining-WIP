Buuuttttttt kills when serve your beer 2 head foam now 3 star <EOR> Excellent atmosphere located heart strip  nice selection alcohol vegetarian pizza options made needed  server also made feel income gave good spot restaurant  Nothing different unusual other Girodanos  <EOR> I really enjoyed first ever Chicago style pizza   ordered sausage pepperoni   didnt long took come but worth wait   Crunchy crust gooey great tasting mozzarella cheese great flavor tomato sauce top sausage pepperoni good quality tasting   Took most back hotel fridge heated nicely   Recommend pizza location where theres lots people watching many pizza options! <EOR> This first deep dish pizza  must say underestimated deep dish  Apparently Chicago   OMG much cheese sauce filling  Definitely expected thought deep dish all other times   I am giving them 4 star just because wait endured  service mediocre  But food awesome  small deep dish easily feed two people   I would definitely return  <EOR> My friend highly recommended place because she tried Chicago loved decided dinner here  patio outside doesn't seat parties 5 indoor seating  arrived 7pm  hostess quoted 30 40 minute wait  put name number down pre ordered pizza once figured wanted deep dish chicken bacon bbq  While friend pre ordering pizza noticed couple come put name down party 11 pre order  10 minutes received text 7 20 saying wait time bumped 60 70 minutes  Then minute later another text saying table ready  seated told waiter pre order already he check it     At 8 15 table 11 received 3 pizzas before us  table 4 sat well received pizzas well   didn't receive pizza until 8 40  When asked waiter why pizza took much longer normal even preordered came before other tables he gave half assed  answer saying preordered he doesn't know system works there  waiter noticed party 11 pizzas first tried assure ours would come soon  He kept dodging table would around even though seated next kitchen  questioned pizza time he stopped asking doing   If waiter hostess messed order would understandable but didn't tell tried half ass response instead fixing it  service sucks   food good  understand takes time cook fresh pizza but when wait over hour food see tables seated pizzas first then taste pizza isn't really worth it  friends enjoyed pizza because damn hungry but couldn't stop being irritated lack etiquette respect consumer    Again food good  But experience first time terrible  <EOR> I used Giordano's Chicago many years ago thrilled find Vegas! curious if would same Chicago think very close  would definitely recommend but give yourself plenty time because deep dish pizza takes hour cook  <EOR> I really enjoyed deep dish veggie pizza loved crust! only complaint parts inside which cold  waiting 45 mins didn't really care though haha  But still next time gonna tell them sure heated through!   We sat window nice view Bellagio fountain all vegas lights  <EOR> I eat lot   Maybe never true Chicago Deep Dish owners started Sicily?!?!?? GOOD! PIZZA?!?!?!?!?!?! <EOR> I've Chicago twice both times deep dish pizza but yet chance Giordano's pizza despite Chicago friends telling better places go   quite excited hear opening hometown Columbus OH but when Vegas strip saw advertisement Giordano's plastered side building knew would want wait until came Columbus would trying them Vegas first time   Arriving restaurant weekday somewhere between lunch dinner meant no line no waiting seated right away   first thoughts really clean modern restaurant looked    Despite being odd time weekday restaurant still mostly filled   waited promptly started ordering order Buffalo wings   short time later some very delicious looking wings came wow tasted even better looked   fact going limb say probably best Buffalo wings anywhere   Very surprising really expecting it   We ahead placed order Chicago deep dish pizza small sausage pepperoni   waitress informed wait would minimum 45 minutes which aware having ordered deep dish pizza before   long wait delicious pizza began   Normally part where would drink beer watch some sports but being Vegas few days fill beer just chit chatted waited pizza   While waiting waitress did great job giving refills tea water manager Eric Hamilton even nice enough come ask liked wings   chatted Eric bit he noticed wearing Buckeye shirt he started tell Polaris opening which thought nice   He told he'd come back check when pizza came out     Eventually right schedule 45 minutes pizza arrive wow did look spectacular!  Eric manager actually came over slices allowed take some fantastic shots all cheesy goodness   first bite pizza proved tasted even better looked all could think wow good thing Giordano's coming ways away where live Columbus I'd eating lot more often should!  really just great   cheese plentiful very saucy sausage pepperoni just amazing   everything expected more very happy it   Chicago deep dish much more filling couldn't actually finish entire small pizza took last slice give lucky homeless guy     The entire experience awesome loved all food   definitely going check Giordano's once comes Columbus spring I'd highly recommend anyone opportunity try it  Just tip Giordano's bar street sure if served pizza if just bar   pizza just didn't see anyone getting pizza while down into restaurant eat   If weather nice give try! <EOR> Favorite pizza!!! Yummy dough fresh sauce perfect amount ingredients! Must try! <EOR> I really wish location San Diego  Hands down best deep dish stuffed pizza ever had  We're HOOKED!! Don't want visit Vegas every time want slice two three  <EOR> Excellent little find right outside Bally's  Nice open air feel good music playing  thought food excellent! garlic Parmesan crusted fries fantastic Best fries ever    stumbled upon place we're glad did! <EOR> This long overdue  came month ago during lunch some town friends  server Patrick Y he amazing   He recommended perfect beer appetizer pairings  salad bruschetta pitcher light ale  large deep dish pizza Chicago style took very long time   little over hour table whereas told 45mins  But Patrick kept updated entertained whole time   very busy understandable  would definitely back!! <EOR> Pizza ok wouldn't far some other reviewers raving incredibly awesome is  <EOR> This best Chicago pizza ever had  tried first night Las Vegas  good ordered pizza house Maryland arrive when returned  would suggest eating restaurant buying pizza to go window pizza won't fresh  <EOR> As always awesome  only 4 deep dish options  But service food awesome  place super casual full bar bigger pizza menu  <EOR> This place great    husband from Chicago always raved pizza    wanted low key casual dinner excellent choice    drinks pizza salad delicious    waiter super nice atmosphere casual but warm  good choice   disappointed  <EOR> You would think being strip food especially given name restaurant reputation but am tell case  wings mediocre Parmesan garlic fries dry no fresh garlic light dusting garlic salt some dried parsley flakes all get  mention wings cold just overall lacked luster  least waitress very nice attentive but probably best part <EOR> Une pizza qui vaut l'expérience! Attention la pizza de type Deep dish leur classique et l'incontournable de l'endroit demande 45 minutes d'attente  La pizza est bonne et contient beaucoup de fromage  <EOR> The second greatest pizza world!  What's first?  Giordano's Chicago course!  If Chicago Deep dish pizza before shame you!   If am die day final meals Giordano's pizza final meals    Yes good     It takes good 45 minutes aware when but OH worth wait       Thank Vegas bringing best pizza world visit    glorious surprise  <EOR> If anyone excited Giordano's coming Vegas me  Grew Giordano's Chicago high school place Fridays  So when husband decided surprise take super happy  But happiness faded quickly  We waited good 10 minutes before waiter greeted us  It pulling teeth ask cup ice ice teas  We put order 1st deep dish pizza  The pizza came 45 minutes which normal I'm waiting first slice served he walked away table SMH thats part experience  So served family that never amazing pizza before kids loved it  I dug good taste wise but wasn't hot just warm  Waited all time warm pizza pretty disappointed  I just wanted leave  I waiting bar manager happened he asked everything explained disappointment  He great offered free pizza next time down since am local So hopefully when back service better  But review 1 star taste pizza another star customer service manager  <EOR> Really good deep dish pizza  ordered two small sized could barely finish one  pizzas tasty filling  <EOR> My first dinner experience Las Vegas! Came couple weeks ago girls trip chose pizza dinner cause deep dish pizza calling names  Friday early evening crowded  long wait which nice cause hungry!   We ended getting deep dish because server said would around 45 50 minute wait because deep dish takes longer cook  Since hungry didn't want wait long decided regular pizza instead  felt long wait food anyway idk getting regular made much difference    We tried Chicago classic which came pepperoni mushrooms green pepper onions  good!!! definitely want try deep dish next time chance! <EOR> When moon hits your eye big pizza pie  amore   Hmmz wonder if still amore Deano if along build your own individual sized pie? Well gamble certainly worth roll dice    What gamble experience overall Giordano's  fact actual restaurant towards back Bazaar vs  more casual setting towards front  Depending time year weather time least options  Safe say since triple digits time outing restaurant experience suited just fine table picked bird's eye view Bellagio all its glory  backdrop bad window cover I'd surely snapped picture description justice    I 4pm during week still relatively busy but nothing crazy  outing decided individual stuffed deep dish which comes 4 slices just perfect portion size person indulge in  Just prepared take 45 minutes put together  waitress made very clear said even tip left know you're getting yourself into don't hold negatively against Giordano's fault  Personally I'd rather them take time don't feast uncooked pizza  That'll leave your insides jackpot surely don't want cash on!  Ingredient wise pizza overall lot different compared some deep dish pies locally California  crust actually very light flaky which really elevated things different height  expecting thought carb overload all crust but really leaves feeling full yet bloated if sense? low point lack cheese pull more entertainment value getting individual size  mean yeah suppose but if just eating why would bigger size just experience? gladly traded really important taste  All veggies meat choices tasted fresh nowhere near canned least speaks itself  also set pizza apart which know sounds weird tomato sauce  last variation came tasting really watery but sauce hearty lets ingredients speak themselves  All all just well prepared meal!  I am happy three Las Vegas visits under belt having pass finally Giordano experience  urge event craving pizza Vegas comes skip secrets Cosmo Sbarro's Monte Carlo's come real treat  Your taste buds gladly double down! <EOR> Their deep dish pizza best pizza ever life still dreams it <EOR> After long hunt missing wallet walking down strip found btw all  cash still present! decided Giodarno's brunch  Mostly because sick walking cousin recognized Chicago    The place pretty empty but realized because people preferred sit downstairs patio area which probably should done experience    WHAT ORDERED Italian beef sandwich good flavor but bit salty taste  Margherita pizza didn't realize under thin crispy crust  didn't mind but everyone else didn't crispy flakey cracker   The Chicago classic deep dish delicious! Ooey gooey oh cheesey!  Fettuccine alfredo sounds most basic thing ordered but actually best dish! HUGE starters  liked pasta actually tasted cheese  hate when Fettuccine just tastes pasta mixed cream   I don't know if because place just opened still some kinks work but order took ridiculously long come out  Well over hour! Possibly even hour half  pretty agitated but staff did apologize unexpected super long wait  waiter great! wasn't fault food took long  <EOR> You want know why am 2 star right now  walked seated  front completely talking smack servers just walked am literally sitting yeah your Vegas going wait problem  staff cohesive mean smack talking door  SANDRA standing front asked napkins two drink over 30 mins ago server slammed mean he doing thing asked while he taking another order she told did hear table drinks       He holding plates drinks taking orders am bothering asked she wait 30mins because she didn't want it  NOW DON'T KNOW ROLE But leader team should take initiative  help she hasn't checked anyone seat she twiddling thumbs waiter freaking boss he getting Hella stuff done he running when people need help he came asked he apologized he said he going happy he it  WAITERS FOOD AMAZING STAFF TOTALLY COHESIVE ALL  Where does all come down to    Figure please  <EOR> I town working SEMA birthday November 2  Since love pizza birthday seemed perfect place small group together  supposed small group slowly turned into group 12 14 people time everyone arrived   we all those friends just don't think RSVP all important  manager beyond kind accommodating server awesome  felt very guilty having all extra people show but staff made every effort sure taken care of  top pizza great! <EOR> I would give place more stars if when reported issue manager he completely brushed off  waitress rude right off bat when asked if coke Pepsi response 1 minute because she playing tablet  Secondly waitress felt  better blame myself consumer because didn't realize more 1 chicken parm if more menu should confirm meal sandwich? She snippy when asked confirm side she put because she didn't ask  food sucked send back  place packed 11pm Wednesday night  shame because many places eat strip where staff actually busy still polite does job  Won't back  <EOR> I've Giordanos few times Chicago  really excited random craving when found Vegas too   I came dinner buddy  each ordered small deep dish pizza few toppings  pizza good    But wasn't good ones ate Chicago  fulfilled craving though!

The PIZZA amazing   I've placed bookmarked longest but never wanted fight traffic downtown  Until wonderful Thursday night    There two ways location  walking through Bally's Paris which isn't long walking steps street entrance   Directly across eatery another popular food place can't think name of  two nice friendly hostess informed roughly 10 15 minute wait  wait time shorter 5 minutes seated nice window seat view Bellagio fountains   I waiter came he nice friendly  recommend If getting famous deep dish pizza put first since takes 45minutes cook  decided deep dish pizza specials half meat loves  first Chicago style deep dish pizza did disappoint  use knife fork cut eat pizza because slices HUGE   My only problem sauce all over shirt because kept forgetting sauce top so keep sliding off hitting place    I love place defiantly returning soon some more yummy goodness  <EOR> It huge disappointment overall experience  came Giordano's expecting real Chicago pizza however overall experience made think much staff floor but barely no service offered   We expected long wait but just brief 15 minute wait  definitely thought going take order ahead time able start working pizza instead having wait another 30 mins food table  rush but 30 minutes enough time someone lose appetite  Considering style pizza serve takes long time should take Chicago order style into consideration well   As sat table server just much  He just stared instead greeting anything  He never introduced himself but he did asked if wanted order asked water ordered food well  never water until salad came asked them again    The salad came roughly 10 mins ordered actually tasted pretty good  house salad yet wish offered choice more cheese but did matter much  Then pizza came out  giordano classic 2 3 people  would say enough food even 4 small girls share but  just me  server offered serve first slice which reason am giving 1 extra star  Then own  pizza just bad  seemed put amount marinara should thin crust  forgot put other scoop sauce  bland taste was  eating onion pizza much cheese no taste it  basically only slice each left whole thing behind us   Will come back? NO  already even told friends local deep dish pizza places instead coming waiting table bad food bad service  combination bad bad bad all way  <EOR> We anxiously awaiting visit Giordano's ever since first heard coming Las Vegas  4pm Monday night restaurant crowded  only few booths large parties sat windows overlooking shops Bally's  both eaten Giordano's Chicago before knew exactly wanted order  Medium Sausage Mushroom Deep dish pizza right away  pizza took 1 hour table plan accordingly if hurry  pizza good but hardly any sausage mushrooms  $27 00 would expect pizza more meat it  crust good remember  But must also comment cheese which oozes all over place once pizza cut not crazy that   Giordano's best pizza place Chicago but best Chicago deep dish pizza Las Vegas  definitely back try extra thin pizza hope if new thin crust pizzeria Las Vegas  <EOR> Fantastic food always  lasagna perfect portion  Service excellent well  Very attentive lots refills polite accommodating  Only beef time seat which happened next door very cold night  tables available ideal situation TBH  But service fantastic Italian made forget  Just solid every time 14 hours Grand Canyon back really great ending very long day  <EOR> This pizza everything  If could marry probably would  would give Giordano 5 stars but knock star down because drinks  ordered Bellini  tasted great! But price pretty outrageous size  bellini served smaller sized wine glass price $12  Just worth it  Maybe if weren't Vegas land cheap alcohol would worth it  also comparing value other restaurants ate while Vegas  just seemed overpriced size  example ate fancy steakhouse later night price $12 cocktail  3 times size! place where entrees START $60 plate    The pizza though! OMG  eaten Giordanos Chicago before  far favorite pizza  very excited see location Vegas now  live west coast easy getting chicago true deep dish  cheese crust don't know crunchy bottom many fillings sauce   prepared wait 45 mins your pizza  stuff made order  pizzas very filling  small filled both plus took 2 pieces hotel  husband rather large appetite but even he couldn't tackle till end    Do yourself favor stop if deep dish  <EOR> I USED love place  But last few times unsatisfactory   pizza way over priced quality offered  actual restaurant Chicago place same quality  last two times ordered ahead time STILL wait additional 30 40 min once arrived TIME SAID PICKUP    Then pizza wasn't ordered little over cooked  pizza crust cardboard   Spending $22 small pizza mediocre never good thing   manager came over fix situation but solution wait another long wait time pizza  good solution already starving family  ended keeping due hunger already experiencing but did fill handled properly  He then begrudgingly offers 20% off THIER mistake which felt should 50% due extra long wait inconvenience eating pizza way ordered AHEAD IF TIME   Needless say back again  Very disappointing <EOR> Love it!

Check pictures  <EOR> Wasn't all great definitely didn't live Instagram hype  ordered pepperoni Chicago style deep dish  very thin bottom crust very thin layer pepperoni the pepperoni sliced paper thin   huge mound cheese drizzle sauce  cheese pull cool see but overall taste pizza lacking  Because layer meat sauce thin all tasted cheese! Now let's talk that cheese cooled very quickly half way through end something tasted more those kiddie cheese sticks  All all probably wouldn't recommend dining Chicago pizza here  taste price 23 some change small excruciatingly hour long wait just isn't worth it  <EOR> I came Thanksgiving day which relatively quiet   chefs mistake made pizza onions olives instead olives mushrooms  when mentioned server she immediately told manager  return FULL pizza house  place great customer service say least ate delicious pizza next 3 days  happy clam    Side note getting parking lot Bally's pain but giving Giordanos less stars because food service still wonderful  <EOR> Best pizza long long time   ordered half veggie half cheese   Would liked veggie half better without broccoli but cheese side awesome!!!

Buyer beware Giordanos location! <EOR> I such high hopes place based off several recommendations  Finally able give try sadly let down  Waited food over 45 minutes  When brought waiter's attention he assured would right however point lost all interest  Disappointing  <EOR> Really great pizza! There's really pretty view Bellagio water show  Great service  Tasted just Giordano's Chicago  <EOR> I sat bar no wait  There's upstairs inside downstairs outside  service okay   the bar guy wasn't most pleasant but did everything correct    The cheesy garlic bread okay but middle portion seemed undercooked underbroiled   so cold grey mess those parts    I ordered fettuccini Alfredo which actually linguine Alfredo  sauce notch above bland seems missing Parmesan cheese garlic  pasta also tad below al dente bit hard eat  little piece bread came pretty dry    My companion ordered personal deep dish came less 45 min quote time  looks advertised  Chicago location but since fan deep dish wouldn't really recommend it  crust just dry    The clientele population Chicago teleported location  Only people would come here  <EOR> Took forever food  fries good  house salad ok nothing special  still waiting pizza but kinda annoyed no toppings substitutions allowed  Definitely would recommend place  Server annoying excuses everything  <EOR> Who could wrong Giordano's? If visited then must when you're Vegas Chicago  very excited when learned new Vegas location opened right Ballys  non pizza options such spaghetti your traditional pizzas calamari cheesy bread famous deep dish pizza  carry window location which find super convenient Vegas  call your hotel room down your order  deep dish pizzas amazing filling  big eater small pizza feed 2 left overs  time ordered pepperoni deep dish great  made order does take long time don't expect because while  However well worth wait  Service excellent  seated right away servers very attentive  Wish Giordano's closer  <EOR> Three things  1 Overpriced 2 Overrated 3 Terrible service   We waited over hour seated  pizza good but could gone somewhere else deep dish  didn't waiter entire time until time collect check  Then check wrong took them 30 minutes take item off bill  only reason giving place star because pizza least decent  hope better experience did  <EOR> Because 2 page review wasn't enough  place always terrible service  Pizza always good though! Just time won't waste time bashing its services Ehh  <EOR> They warned deep dish would hour wait   Interesting when think places run throughput tables revenue  said he pie just takes hat long however other Giordanos simply understand many deep dishes sell possibly them already over default     Anyways decided faster food pasta chicken sandwich on   took hour table  when finally tried leave cleaning items done with  annoying    Food mediocre  waitress nice but tied bad management restaurant policies   gave good tip decided least moan Yelp  <EOR> I just visited Giordano's last night discovering Instagram loved it!    We ordered Garlic Parmesan Fries appetizer okay   Nothing impressive them   But knew wait pizza going while them tide over   The real winner definitely deep dish pizza   Cheese Deep Dish added Pepperoni   Although personally didn't really taste pepperoni thick gooey cheese everything!  love pizza all kinds more expected   kept side ranch fries dipped crust it   good!!  The servers nice friendly very attentive   The view strip where sat windows exciting   watched Bellagio fountains!

About 5 minutes ago asked cashier again order only then did she glance receipt under scanner register she tells they're just cutting your pizza  it'll soon  Then spotted putting receipt board  Something tells chick never placed order kitchen       Not impressed Vegas location  Sadly multiple Giordano's Chicago always better                       **edit** 40 minutes! Went window cashier already knew ask  She offered call manager which agreed to moments later he arrived speak me  He explained pizza ready side note WHY food arrives right when begin complain demand refund?! but salad appetizers only few more minutes away  tired enough already still asked cancel everything  He voided payment order apologized multiple times but did ask once again if wanted pizza   which sitting warmer ?!?!   Ugh fine then give pizza! Why did come first anyway????  While appreciate manager coming talk while quickly getting problem resolved without forcing resorting acting rude *thank you* entire experience shouldn't happened all no should through ever  <EOR> Als Liebhaber der deep dish Pizzas welche ursprünglich aus Chicago stammen war ich natürlich auch bei meinem letzten Trip nach Las Vegas erpicht darauf ein Restaurant zu finden welches diese serviert  Gab es vor ein paar Jahren noch nur ein paar wenige Adressen hierfür scheint die Szene zwischenzeitlich Zuwachs erhalten und sich ausgedehnt zu haben  Giordano's ist als eines der wenigen Restaurants direkt am Strip und hatte zudem sehr gute Bewertungen welche vollends erfüllt wurden  Die Pizza schmeckt wirklich lecker wie es sein soll auch wenn sie nicht ganz das Original aus dem mittleren Westen rankommen  Dort ist die Teigzusammensetzung einfach irgendwie anders evtl  mit einem höheren Anteil Maismehl als man es hier hat  Das Ambiente des Restaurants ist zudem eher laut aber typisch Las Vegas ist und deshalb eigentlich auch passt  Plus für eine Handvoll Dollars wird man hier richtig voll wo man einem Steakhouse für das gleiche Geld höchstens 100g Filet kriegt  Deshalb ein absolutes Muss für jeden Pizzafan der sein Leibgericht mal von einer anderen Seite kennenlernen möchte  Aus unserer 6er Gruppe waren allesamt begeistert von der deep dish! <EOR> They don't take reservations waited over hour half table since encouraged pre order pizza did while waited but then took forever come even sat down   pizza outstanding though end worth wait     ** am going update review later because manager kind enough reach offer right this  <EOR> The pizza really needs work  put very small amount   toppings pizza  Also worst part only put your requested toppings side   am  1st day opened  If you're looking Orlando FL Chicago style Giordano's Pizza doesn't compare yet   Hopefully improve  <EOR> Enjoyed bbq pizza  much thinner crust normal deep dish style pizzas  still haven't tried deep dish feel missed out  <EOR>
