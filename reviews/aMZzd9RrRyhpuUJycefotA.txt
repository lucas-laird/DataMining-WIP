I don't read reviews ahead time because form own opinions here's found  place small quiet very cozy feeling  think dark wood walls give bit enclosed feeling open airy  Perhaps need some splashes color give more inviting feeling   but decor aside  let's talk food service    I ordered Greek omelette which cooked perfectly! plenty feta cheese but little lacking spinach tomato  hash browns cooked crispy delicious  most exciting things bring back again real cappuccino! only 3 75!  The service okay  server pleasant however she never told name  unfortunately bit busy she never did come check see if everything's okay  wasn't huge big deal busy eating  But am server noticed those things  Overall thought food pretty good cappuccino bonus probably back again <EOR> We came just 20 minutes before close worried going those people showed made them stay late  really nice made best food! steak ooh la la very good comfort food  <EOR> So sign outside touting best eggs Benedict  which thought challenge accepted  Annnnnd   they right!
