Also service really good   While waiting food manager duty noticed husband's water half full immediately told server fill up   Wow  rare days impressed  <EOR> Ok start food actually really good consistent  reason rated them lower because customer service  several times usually good service however waitress needs customer service lessons  Im sure cultural background but she Asian prob thirties late twenties  last time group seven  occasion plenty seating but sign wait did  two waitresses white Asian both saw continued working even clean table   5 minutes Asian lady came over sat table  first thing she said planning pay? thought really strange kinda rude  Im used waitress telling u menu before discussing money looked each other puzzled look answered some paying cash some paying credit cards  Right away she responded can't that  only take 4 payments  tried figure cash if needed sit separate tables order lunch literally talked payment stuff ten minutes before allowed look menu   worked she gave minute look menu came back stood head table requested orders requiring yell across table place order over noise  Isn't common technique waiters walk around table order unless your booth sonly place stand? felt rude  easier placed order over phone order way she didn't worry  splitting bill number payments she could take  day each talk experience planning back  really food want back but tone supporting type customer service  If back order 100%  No need staying rather eat picnic table movie theater customer service feel obligated tip someone isn't doing job customer prospective  Overall think could improve customer service especially seating  typically wait 5 minutes every time gone always between 2% 25% full  <EOR> Came lunch wait 5 minutes before seated   Ordered oxtail fries which shared throughout table  Miyagi Burger which wagyu beef chili mayo fried egg onion rings bacon  ordered medium rare cheddar cheese  point everything complimented each other  Service good food came quickly   definitely come again when come visit  <EOR> Placed phone order know don't much time wait lunch break food sometimes takes bit prepare  required credit card number over phone process order  Against better judgement gave them express some serious concern over phone person being asked provide info  assured both times nothing charged until came card  Found fact DID charge twice  When complained finally managed figure refund weak apology  Other rightfully getting back taken them no real attempt right negative impression earn future business  Food good but never eat again seems though staff couldn't care less  Some shady stuff going here  AVOID  <EOR> Fantastic eclectic burgers  definitely leave full  Great sauces fries  Loved unique sodas apple lychee   Nice off strip go to place if want tasty burger half would pay strip! <EOR> Their Shogun burger good boxer friend call Committing Foul   contains unagi bbq eel foie gras wagyu beef   special fries made truffles parmesan  Yes now say am ready Las Vegas Marathon or just excuse eat Foul burger ^^ <EOR> I am fan Bachi Burger great experience other locations decided visit location since closest location when commuting north side strip   sat down rather quickly even during peak hours   seem larger space compared other locations majority crowds seem local residents   We started usual Ox Tail Fries   portion did seem bit skimpy when compared other locations usually takes two three people finish ox tail bit chewy comparison well     We Kalbi Burger some Peking Duck Sliders entrées   kalbi patty burger felt bit lacking seasoning but flavor ok overall   duck meat sliders bit dried really could use more sauces   There three but waitress bit rude companion maybe he only white person? he did end ordering anything end   probably onetime thing guess bad service made visit rather unpleasant usually love Bachi Burger  <EOR> Another solid burger joint!

Thank Bachi keep amazing work! <EOR> So Bachi Burger's newer location first things elbow room   seems lot spacious less crammed versus original location plus there's options things could before going here  There's bars theater restaurants just walking distance  Yea located next movie theater   The must Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries  amazing but just something known just your system  pile your usual French fries kind wished thicker maybe use tater tots steak fries topped oxtail chili cheese mixture cilantro jalapeño fried egg  Order your burger divide among group friends   I almost alway same burger Spicy Miso Burger  Don't let name fool isn't even spicy  angus beef patty shishito pepper swiss cheese onion mayo lettuce some sauces fried egg bun  bad tasty but only way satisfied adding lots sriracha other other hot sauces it   I they're doing menu creative would impress many  service almost always good except when want divide checks think max 4 split checks no matter large party but they'll let charge many cards if want check usually works out  <EOR> This second time second experience better first  oxtail chili fries which love  time Kiki burger recommended most reviewers YUM! night ended salted caramel shake which good! Customer service  also      only thing don't lighting there  bright little lights little oppressive  Maybe just night?? <EOR> I'm non meat eater but still liked it   Grilled cod sandwich very good  Sweet potato fries excellent   Service friendly   The place easy see street   corner strip mall next movie theater     I would come again sure   Aw hell no! just bill charged tiny bit bbq hoisin sauce   only $ 50 but hate that   credit other sauce didn't use?!  Seriously hope owner reads reviews   much though into menu plating   shame ruin impression over silly pricing policies  <EOR> Food excellent! Service good  Kalbi  burger wife Bachi burger  Both excellent but little under cooked asked for  kim chee burger just right over powering  Monday evening  8 tables occupied 3 servers  beer both drank water  water filled once napkins asked when food came never arrived  extent servers attention  Beer water dropped off she took food order she dropped off burgers  it  manager brought appetizer ask check finished eating waiting 20 minutes  Don't recall filled water but wasn't server  recommend place food great  give them another try  <EOR> Ordered Miyagi without mayo due allergy medium well  Burger arrived mayo sent back  Waiter brought back almost immediately asked if just wiped off mayo back he honestly responded yes  Sent burger back 2nd time requested manager  different waiter visited table order came 3rd time asked if company policy just wipe off burgers made incorrectly obviously response no   Ridiculous lazy!   Will returning any time soon seeing plenty other burger places service generally sucks location anyway  Service location slow every time order meal arrives some error requiring send back last time cooked incorrectly took several tries right cook cook time past well done no furikake some reason but mayo more important issue    When service better if move closer windmill location back  <EOR> This probably 4 star join but tastebuds won't let it   I cautiously Bachi friend adores place  She ordered us Oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer Spicy Miso burgers   I never oxtails life finding several year back didn't want to  friend convinced try oxtail fries surprisingly really good  just couldn't over fact eating cow tails  Yes am wimp   After snacking fries high expectations burger  burger wasn't bad just wasn't special  definitely tell quality ingredients into burger but flavor kind blah  Nothing sets apart any other quality burger  Maybe ordered wrong thing? only ate half   never happens!  It's bit pricey burger but think walking kind expect it  service awesome   everyone kind helps out  don't think return due personal preference but recommend checking least once  <EOR> Do want something different? Feel indecisive between Asian flavor packed burger? dream come true  love solid cheeseburger burger spot all burgs  more dozen times they've never let down    They variety choices when comes fries    Salt Pepper Fries Garlic Truffle Fries Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries egg My favorite Burger Myagi San Burger which comes egg bacon onion ring cheddar cheese   I ordered mine medium rare always comes just right  Always packed flavor !

He also forgot add extra party friend ordered friend decided without since would've taken another 5 10 minutes make  When came check told specifically amounts split he still wrong  My group resorted asking other servers around if regular milk tea apparently only flavored   makes wonder if all powder back another server grab ours could ask check  All other servers seemed lovely helpful even new guy but ours downright unpleasant    I'll probably eat again   just go!! <EOR> Being vegan am no way burger connoisseur but say really enjoyed place  came before movie tad bit hesitant  However did see some veggies line menu sounded really good pretty excited  pretty empty Tuesday night around 8pm    Our server little dry but he point filling drinks patient complicated order  ordered meatless burger no bun bed lettuce no sauces Made vegan   boyfriend two friends ordered burgers oxtail fries  opted edamame it good   food came pretty promptly no problems I didn't send thing back ! loved oxtail fries burgers! really enjoyed food well  would totally recommend burger any all meat eating friends    texture wasn't meaty being vegan hate anything mimics meat but definitely versatile dish anyone could enjoyed!

Really? You've eaten there?  No  But all yuppy friends say good must be  only give two because service presentation food decent   We ordered something called oxtail fries which horrible  sure actual oxtail would probably tastier   My girlfriend each ordered different burger could sample each others  Sorry can't remember called but didn't care one  best compliment could pay them say least edible   So mentioned service decent food looked presentable but far taste can't recommend place    Perhaps just me  Maybe asian fusion just isn't type food    I'd rather Wendys burger over place  <EOR> Finally try place! last night around 7 30 party 8 family dinner  wait wasn't bad but did take 30 minutes seat even seeing quite few cleared tables   First things first table sat broken  feet missing broken basically making table seesaw  Luckily some Vegas Weekly magazines front able slide under leg even though wife gave hard time that! P  Ok food well appetizers first   Since decent sized party tried couple different things  stir fried edamame great cooked just right  since everyone raves pork belly definitely must try  Those things spectacular pork super tender steamed buns amazing  wasn't huge fan sauce little sweet but still great flavor  also couple different types fries didn't care much  salt pepper fries along truffle fries just ok  Definitely staple items off menu  say though dipping sauces give them awesome  Another thing want mention even though aren't really appetizer milkshakes   you can't leave without trying one  tried mocha nut fudge salted caramel just altogether awesome milkshakes!  As far main items few things did didn't like  never tried wagyu beef substituted into Kiki burger delicious! everyone table agreed but there's definitely flavor difference unbelievably juicy  also use some great toppings everything just tasted really fresh  also can't say enough buns super soft really tasty  main gripes place burger cooking temperatures  love some pink burger but wife doesn't used seeing medium some pink it   not Bachi  medium extremely pink opinion lot closer medium rare  If aren't fan pink your burger sure order your burger medium well least    Even though pretty much everything good little pricey   7 adults 1 kid bill $210 some change before tip  decent service but slowed down quite bit time sat down 8 food took while come out  feeling now knowing bit more Bachi could probably easily bump 4 stars next time eat since definitely coming back  <EOR> Overated! heard lots good reviews place but felt burgers bland  lacked grilled charred taste really burger burger! Wasn't satisfying all fast food burger would probably satisfied more  tried $26 wagyu burger extremely disappointed  more thing burgers which start $12 don't even include fries! Great Asian fusion concept   but needs lot work  <EOR> Terrible  I sick food fries calimari very oily vomited oil food nasty burgers dry when ppl party sick manager did want take food off bill even though canceled it  watching if gonna walk paying never felt uncomfortable restaurant before  never back <EOR> Place very unique  oxtail fries over rated basically chili fries   but both burger wife awesome!

Sigh  definitely wasn't best dinner experience had  Jacob decided dinner friends school  all hospitality majors few heard place wanted check specifically     We arrived few minutes Jake Sam wife son RJ  little stuffy but assumed because multitude people restaurant  extremely easy find parking close restaurant    Our server quickly introduced herself super friendly but might miscounted didn't right number menus all us  dying try Bahn Mi burger days  ordered only find specific patty weren't able burger  She did state very popular burger asked recommendation    which expecting  recommending burger fish    she also stated red sangria but managed last glass  thank that    I decided order same burger boyfriend Sam which contains multitude mushrooms arugula gruyere cheese caramelized onions    At point  Let summarize happened  ordered plate pickled items calamari  Sadly Jacob weren't impressed pickled items  But 1 year old RJ didn't waste  calamari table favorite    We never offered refills water any other beverages wave down bus girl Jacob Sam said reeked weed apparently likes reallllly focus filling only glass per table visit  also empty appetizer plates almost 20 minutes finishing    All food came same time  Except baby Rj's food came few minutes ours  really wish would brought food first because hate when kid gets food adults    The caramelized onions burger superb cook burgers perfectly but sweet buns onions overpowered EVERYTHING else burger Parmesan porcini truffle fries only tastes Parmesan lacking salt truffle    I would told server all if she checked taking order but only saw end meal when asked check  checks also split incorrectly but because hot inside because all really thirsty decided pay leave    This expecting establishment  food itself 3 stars but service brought down 2  Sorry Bachi Burgers  <EOR> My friends location because original broken air conditioner said couldn't accommodate large party   We came waited ridiculously long time
