At Las Vegas Foodie Festival waited 3 hours White Castle hour White Rabbit another hour sushi burrito    all didn't compare Big Easy Balls Sauced! best part only wait 15 minutes! mad myself waiting long mediocre food when could've enjoying food Sauced whole time! <EOR> It seems though food trucks don't much following back California but Sauced still hold ground fairly well    I loved discount if buy more items  1 items normally $3 50 2 $6 50 3 $9 00  naturally being student budget appeals very much! Originally 3 items thinking would enough 2 us  ordered Big Easy Balls Turkey Slider Jerk Pork Tacos  First impression weren't big thought knew we'd need more but dug into nonetheless  Also any sauce put side they're included food   Big Easy Balls excited little disappointed  balls themselves nice crispy outside soft gooey inside  But didn't much flavor  expected little kick Andouille sausage but flavor little lacking  sriracha sauce much needed very good   Turkey Slider Probably favorite  bacon confit delicious really well turkey patty  dressed much smaller turkey burger   Jerk Pork Tacos weren't big fans this  pork didn't much flavor nothing really stood out  Also pretty big hunk fat taco   Next Asian Chicken Nachos Drunken Balls   Asian Chicken Nachos supposed Thai coconut sauce but didn't taste any that  liked served fried wonton shaped bowl thought clever presentation    Drunken Balls glad small bits cilantro else really would just fried ball potato  Nice crispy skin when bite cilantro quite tasty  Again cheese sauce needed    Overall food alright but hurry come back  things should try though Big Easy Balls Turkey Slider those better ones selection  <EOR> We booked Sauced well over month advance school event   Four days prior event emailed cancelled us   event school low income area raise money students need   Mike told he event cancelled then back on   very unprofessional wouldn't book guys event seem very unreliable  <EOR> Ok once upon time long long time ago chance try Sauced food truck first Silverton's foodie Fest but only some believe mac cheese balls some kind croquette bites can't remember long ago  All remember little pricey good    But last Saturday attended wife's company picnic serving food glad! don't know much because catered but willing happy pay good money burgers    We Blue Burger Hawaiian Burger which both came amazing seasoned fries    Blue Burger 5 5 sure beyond buns delicious don't know where if but something just toss normal  light airy toasted perfectly  burger patty great size right amount crispiness chard ness juiciness  OMG juicy  Packed great flavor topped perfect amount Blue cheese over kill grilled Caramelized onions yummmmm    The Hawaiian Burger 5 5 Ah Aloha My wife crazy teriyaki anything other then chicken she LoVed burger  Same thing patty grilled perfection smothered some sort teriyaki sauce topped grilled pineapple freaking good soggy over whelming whole sweet sawha deal coarse fries crispy seasoned finger licking good!
