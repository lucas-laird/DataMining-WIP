Inexpensive pretty good selection food   ordered few rounds beverages edamame spicy tuna roll vegetarian roll california roll yellowtail jalepeno not happy hour menu potstickers calimari sliders tacos   Everything pretty tasty nice buzz going bar patio area   good meal would definitely back!  four all food drinks only $70! not including tip <EOR> I now total 2 times both times left very happy  It very crowded bar HH Spy On's but still worthy checking out  The sushi sushi bar fresh fast  chef even made something special super yummy  would love come back again  and if Im ever side town  And just FYI careful cougars hunt!! <EOR> I excited see redone restaurant since last 3 years ago does indeed look different  does same quiet atmosphere once sure great happy hour cause  very disappointed sushi but everything else decent  would give another shot  <EOR> So heard place least last ten years  driven many times  However never attracted come even though love REI  better half girls patronizing place years it  finally since friends insisted hey treat helping them move some stuff   I didn't know remodeled  am sure looked before  place looks hip trendy  Since am single no party no dressed up   dress most eateries town  LV all its always casual  Anything special decor? least  easily sit sit Blue Martini Cheesecake Factory Roy's blink eye  t wrong everything looks new trendy if into kind thing  just wanted place sit   We entered bunch hostesses ? standing around  am sure were  stranding podium @ entrance  assumed told no seats available  related message friends mozied behind group  girls looking downstairs table upstairs friend looking table  circled around found table back  call girls told het found table downstairs too  always thought hostesses job? much love hear social affairs standing booth  really care less  doesn't pay bills but  believe did  really want place where really made feel welcome? But busy am sure care less party 4   We ordered crap load food drinks dinky round bar table could barely contain anything server nice brought them finished  would more nice if drinks refilled promised  dark outside once he sun out  understand ambiance but really just sitting dark outside  temp cooled put jacket along everyone else group  gas heater would provided some light warmth served enhance ha ambiance  named Kona? ever see Tiki lounges torches outside? Heck any restaurant outside Hawaii there's something burning night give light ambiance   So food  ok  Some avocado roll best  pizza thing ok  More cheese tomato sauce but  personal preference  sushi tasted good enough bar food  Yes bar food  know place tapas like  burger slider good  Again good but nothing write home either  Maybe if more flavor would but overall kind bland  Five Guys burger more taste  overall food average  Presentation great but taste just alright  where having great experience would compensate food bit  Don't wrong food bad here  just could little more flavor  best avocado thing five items ordered  thing tortilla chip bottom something top  am thinking some kind fish  But  memorable food me   The server seemed trying knack things but friendly cheerful  bussers worked butt off  hostesses held podium up   Oh scene  noticed quite few single people sitting eating themselves  Kona grills reputation previously told running cougars money cops   probably why never cared come  could see walking around search table sit there's quite few available ladies ready mingle   Will come back? Yeah maybe next 10 years  am particularly fond having look own table when there's people paid just that  just stick Downtown Summerlin local eats  within walking distance anyway  No need drive far lousy service  unfortunately nice hard working bussers waitresses those ditzes apologize ditzes everywhere else ruin whole staff  am pretty sure view customers biased glasses  But ladies if working office would've addressed shape shipped long time ago  Then again maybe Kona Grill pays professional podium models keep place falling down pick choose want feel welcomed establishment  <EOR> Kona grill always rocks it  Great sushi rolls happy hour fun new adults only upper deck  misters fans keep cool comfortable even when hundred degrees outside  Vegetarian rolls non meat crowd wonderful  keep going back because good  <EOR> Great food  Horrible service  BF Dad came tonight sat patio  service terrible  own utensils drink order incorrect  disappointed hearing great place was  maybe dining room experience different??? <EOR> What happened happy hour menu?

Decent prices considering location friendly staff food good  definitely plan coming back <EOR> Do come if handicap want order off happy hour menu your options seating tree stump no actual table which believe isn't easy when your handicap sitting outside middle winter isn't very warm place  service management working awful worst customer service received long time  Food took over 45mins all tables around moved inside because being cold heaters hardly working  Asked speak manager AGM came table when explained concerned he told plenty people sitting outside   Poor example management service slow seems GM needs some training team  Won't going back which sad since used very often but since remodel service just gone down hill  <EOR> This place definitely worth All Day Sunday happy hour!
