Place empty Friday night around 8 but starving wanted try something new   am going complain whole lot food quality   ordered Lasagna quite good great bolognese sauce garlic toast   wife burger she devoured good fries well   Serving size average but adequate   would give food quality 3 5 stars   However       sticker shock understatement   Read menu yourself your decision but food worth most 60% charge  It's Vegas       probably 40% any given home town place  The service spotty       people acted little didn't know why there   most memorable thing?
