Ambient music little louder normal maybe require talk louder another    Prior arriving yelp checking people suggested first thing caught eye Ruben  Being lover corned beef pastrami sandwiches going order  arriving saw wide variety salads caught eye ! Pricing salad scoop  Something around $2 50 per scoop pretty decent amount because only 1 scoop seemed more 1 scoop Seasonal Special as january 28 2014 $2 50 scoop Seared Ahi tuna watermelon radish edamame quinoa sesame ginger dressing  OOOH probably FAVORITE salads far EVER  seared ahi tuna nice fresh  Edamame gave nice crunchy texture while sesame ginger dressing gave nice flavor blended everything in  being doesnt really ginger didnt really taste ginger which great didnt know ginger until took picture tag prior leaving   also lot white little things didnt know but delicious  Asked said quinoa O o surprising  soft texture while holding its shape  Similar rice but apparently really healthy you  Something along lines flat couscous? Hope eat few more times before changes since its seasonal special   B Ruben $8 99 Corned Beef red cabbage slaw gruyere cheese Russian Dressing Rustic Raisin Rye bread  Decent sized sandwich ratio maybe 1 1 between corned beef red cabbage slaw  use pretty thin sauce slaw which caused lot dripping while eating sandwich  quite sweet  covered lot corned beef flavor well russian dressing  rustic raisin rye bread soggy surprisingly even end sandwich nicely toasted hard  Overall tasted pretty nice but its favorite ruben's eaten    Overall surprisingly enjoyed salad more sandwich originally for  I'd back try other salads various pides people raving about  <EOR> As first timer Vegas once again turned yelp some help    would say Vegas place very reasonably priced considering price everything near strip casinos    If food worth price mind paying little extra fresher local ingredients    No farms no food simple       ordered Ruben focaccia  corn beef delicious thinly sliced just right amount sandwich  use red cabbage Russian dressing Gruyere cheese  also came small sample strawberry apple salad which delicious well   really enjoyed sandwich fresh filled without making feel heavy  other blanco pide which much heavier dish because all cheese but he said ingredients fresh flavor combinations really good  pides large he could finish brought hotel finished later  also ordered morning wake smoothie truly amazing!!! drinks little pricey but all all feel Vegas food fairly priced    $4 50 coconut water?
