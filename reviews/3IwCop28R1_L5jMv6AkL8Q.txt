Probably only thing both instant fans of  Forgot add yes start right off complimentary chips bean dip salsa    Everyone friendly but service extremely slow  saw two sets new trainees ours didn't seem communication  Two different servers asked wanted drink later same two came individually asking wanted order  check took awhile run then even more time come back us   Tip There's Groupon $12 $20 worth food but can't order items value menu if so  way you're saving same amount anyway  Olé! <EOR> Me girlfriend group restaurant decided give try   10 night ordered Mexican pizza   honestly say good experience waitress awesome   name Imelda   drink never below halfway mark she point   music little loud but tolerable   would definitely eat again  <EOR> Hands down fiance's favorite Mexican restaurant! first time ever reviewed restaurant online but felt spread word  brought several friends when ask order tell them anything menu because all good  tried several different dishes never disappointed  personal favorite Tequila Sunrise Enchiladas del Mar   the creamy chipotle sauce amazing! daily specials under $10 those always good  Chips refried bean dip salsa complimentary  bean dip especially delicious always order refills  restaurant must try! <EOR> Basically best Mexican restaurant ever hands down  reason why because nice customer service ease reading menu authentic Mexican Latin dishes  love place very cheap definitely worth every penny  drinks best tasting  Sangrias favorite! <EOR> Just GREAT dinner waiter Ramero AWESOME amazing smile  enjoy good meal pleasant atmosphere EVERYTIME we're here   Thanks Again Jalisco's <EOR> Their tequila sunrise seafood dish really good   service good   the all around atmosphere good  <EOR> Stopped quick solo lunch   Service friendly fast food fresh tasty   especially bacon wrapped shrimp!
