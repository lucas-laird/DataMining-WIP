But also fine  knew pay leftovers because AYCE said okay pay  he brought check only extra $5 seaweed salad  Okay appreciate it   We disappointed sushi slow service leftover charge  Then pay tip only $1  know kinda rude but today didn't really want tip them  Then came OYSHI SUSHI    THE REAL PROBLEM THIS  GUESS WHAT   OUR SERVER FOLLOWED STARTED YELL SAID F**KING A** HOLE F**K KEEP SWEAR US  Before thought today really good should come again enjoy meal but once hear server yelling swear thought  tip $1 execellent choice    I know really manner put $1 tip  But kind manner that?

Great all eat option but often times just sit bar some hand rolls  spicy tuna avocado favorite   There's alot sushi choices Vegas but asking favorites  The service always excellent   Very focused your satisfaction  <EOR> 4 8 2018 first visit here  Hubby took AYCE lunch @ $23 00 Dinner Sushi @ $18 00   For meal miso soup served first nothing write home about  Bland watered down  Certainly full bodied no real miso taste it  holding miso expensive put more soup? credit though did put generous amount wakame seaweed but only small amount tiny tiny cubes tofu  Dang  Tofu isn't expensive! Eating miso soup drinking lightly flavored miso water mixed wakame diminutive amount tofu bits   Then came tossed salad which good size salad but dressing minuscule  stingy dressing OMG    The tempura dish very good! Hot temperature wise flavorful thoroughly enjoyed dish!  Now main dish came which variety sashimi top shredded daikon radish shiso leaves very delish   LOVE leaves!   No rice  long while finally inquired having rice gal looked table noting no rice retrieved bowl round top rice    Now back day when growing NEVER served rice rounded top  way serving rice reserved dead people  Yep   DEAD people  grandma used serve little bowls round top rice deceased husband little Buddhist shrine she bedroom   As overall ambience beautiful but music played incongruous Japanese theme! Instead quiet tone Asian type music which would conducive appropriate dining digestion blasted nightclub type music which almost loud conversation  Management apparently thinks people enjoy having eardrums blasted while eating sushi! Taste music pure hell anyway  Even if played same type music but toned down volume would tolerable  But force patrons listen music liking  Bad business! thoughtless customers' taste music  If you're going inflict YOUR type music your patrons decency turn volume down background music   As food server first female take order then later male came table  He acted putting when asked more water to go box which he brought  But when asked plastic bag to go box he almost sarcastically asked if anything ELSE I'd like??? goodness  attitude! He's job job service patrons  also fault he didn't bring plastic bag along to go box   only common sense need plastic bag put your to go box just case box leaks which DID happen ride home   Not once during meal did ANYone come table refill water ask if everything alright   Overall did enjoy meal but because ambience poor service poor attitude poor choice music lack service concern its patrons food quality amount back  There's just many other places which choose! Well never know until try tried! done that  <EOR> My AYCE sushi!! Such great selection reasonable price  just sushi AYCE menu but appetizers dessert well hungry!

Everyone around complaining whole atmosphere downer  Food good but would rather sushi grocery store then deal bs  P s   they leave pitcher water table   not nice   it's because difficult them even refill water <EOR> Worst service ever   Just because big party gratuity automatically bill doesn't mean treat customers worst service  Where shall begin  First took 30 minutes just water party 15   Second when bring orders just place corner table nearest entry expect sort whoever ordered it  Third just keep doing expect room table instead cleaning table which total mess because all empty plates table   Did runners rude  Just worst ever seen compared other parties sushi spots   feel gratuity shouldn't automatically added service  Stay away place party  <EOR> This all you can eat lunch $21  fresh order premade nor buffet style which love  plethora selections hand rolls sushi appetizers hot cold cooked sushi didn't order any personal Preference   Uni included during lunch  Quality great  dined newer location which nicely decorated modern touches semi private rooms also available  Service good  lot people lunch weekday but maybe because new location  Would come back here! <EOR> Not first time being Oyishi but today last   seated within five minutes arrival however ask service waiting 25 minutes  waitress assigned table very pleasant apologetic   placed orders but people   party did receive complete  sushi order 2hrs  waitress again apologetic placed  rush   star waitress if wasn't would walked out  <EOR> My mom eat Oyshi every now then when order same thing every time  Just recently mom decided eat service unbelievably slow restaurant full all mom couldn't understand why hour delay order  time server delivered food lost appetite eat just bagged food go  doesn't matter good food if service isn't excellent food ruins whole dining experience me  would also mention Oyshi servers take initiative bring things you'll need eat such utensils napkins chopsticks etc     ask everything pain a**  Overall disappointed service Oyshi hope see improvement future  <EOR> Since someone reached responded post decided update review  star accumulation between food service received  If subtract your server's hesitation then give three stars  <EOR> I really don't know restaurant getting 5 stars? friends family? fish fresh enough but when rice twice size any AYCE sushi seems worth it  ate mainly nigiri  waiter apologetic enough though he forgot many orders  Service painfully slow started think tactic strategy eat less since 15 minute gaps  Plus only dessert? normally 2 which always eat since portions usually small  Needless say coming back even if 2 blocks away  <EOR> Second time coming location fairly good experience last time came when Las Vegas  website Yelp both say location closes 11pm late dinner 9pm  restaurant noticeably less crowded last time but seated right away  waitress good quickly came took orders  first round food came quickly everything good except uni which definitely bad    The restaurant started thin eventually only table left  worked restaurants long time know over want home  However level professionalism expected when any customers around  parents ordered couple hand rolls etc last round definitely falling apart literally thrown plate    The biggest issue other employees not server   Before 10pm rest workers already cleaning talking other employees no big deal it  However employees incredibly unprofessional  Literally yelling again only table restaurant cussing every other word literally heard point YELL Oh fuck ya when fucking titties hanging out! am far prude but literally parents obviously older tolerate kind stuff  mom mortified employee did  come table half ass sorry being loud long day while literally laughing  all over just wanted there  When left single employee said thank good night anything    I would definitely recommend going other location just trying another AYCE sushi spot  <EOR> Man am glad came back try place again  must fluke day when before previous review because back few times awesome ever since  become favorite places sushi! sushi fresh every roll delicious  favorite salmon belly! rolls never wrong Love Affair!

Sushi came fresh delicious service great decor industrial beautiful  no wait when arrived around noon but customers quickly trickled thereafter  can't see place being busier Goyemon which why Also would recommend Kamikaze rolls <EOR> Their new location space formerly occupied Wild Sushi  Somehow made space less appealing  tore row booths replaced them tables  Also gone performance stage  rest decor looks half finished  Luckily food much better  sampling tuna albacore halibut yellowtail nigiri showed sushi better your average AYCE spot  order pork belly good despite drowning sauce  Rolls fairly well crafter minimal rice ample fish  Each AYCE meal comes dessert  opted velvety smooth chocolate creme brulee its thick sugary crust   A kid's menu available  kid's order popcorn chicken filled large bowl  la carte item inexpensive deal easily would fed four kids  He ended meal ice cream parfait made vanilla ice cream granola chocolate strawberry syrup   3 5 Stars <EOR> First off dark there  seriously only light enters through tinted front glass doors  feel you're some cavernous spot when bright sunny kinda feels weird  However if sort thing then it  Our Server Rey pretty awesome! energy enthusiasm light cave  ordered few things then based off suggestion ordered different roll  Nice too!  The Food Runner found myself helping out  when delivered edamame rather attempting place middle table he placed off side because few things way  experience yes worked restaurants when happens set dish down room then place dish center  However kind thing literally just bring food out  Didn't add experience just there  Oh but wait! food!

Surf turf best flavors  husband always gets gyoza  sushi fine  There's only few rolls call home   enjoy nigri! Very fresh tasty  definitely spot check out  <EOR> I've going Oyshi Sushi's Rainbow location many years it favorite sushi staple delighted when sister Sahara location opened since much closer where live     Oyshi consistently delivers fresh tasty quality sushi its customers   deep variety choices menu provides both cooked raw choices varied crowd people able come together share Japanese style menu even though some guests don't indulge eating raw seafood   Their traditional sushi skillfully prepared yellow tail times seems just melt your mouth   many varieties rolls first time visitor could spend quite while choosing assortment   After years coming recommend some favorites   The Rainbow Roll traditional California roll topped variety seafood tuna salmon yellow tail mouth watering colorful display   For spicy roll enjoy Red Rock   roll filled spicy chopped salmon served spicy mayo type topping  drink water type heat but just enough heat blow taste buds   If you're soft shell crab lover highly recommend Spider Roll   Spider roll contains fried soft shell crab parts layered crab mixture placed roll   slightly warm extremely tasty crunch soft shelled crab provides delicious mild crunch roll just cant enough of   The all eat selection also includes tempura selections well rib eye steak served sliced smaller pieces onions sizzl'n hot metal based plate  If still able handle dessert offer sunday moche all eat option   Beer Cocktails assorted beverages hot tea at additional prices available   Their all eat lunch price slightly lower dinner price expect pay approximately 25 per person lunch 30 per person dinner  course could purchase off menu lighter appetites  <EOR> We always eat sushi dinner time always serve good but time happy hour 3 pm 5pm serve food really low quality  barely see fish it  order dragon roll eel top tiny cucumber salad looks nasty n messy   All sushi order came big chunk rice  guess serve happy hrs coz 20% off regular price  other things notice once put 2nd round sushi order alway put more rice less fish  Disappointed <EOR> One best AYCE sushi places Vegas  food great! love fact many options restaurant all eat  great selection appetizers rib eye steak agedashi tofu shrimp tempura etc  all which thoroughly enjoyed    The nigiri sushi just right size  appreciated smaller rice portions which allowed order variety things without getting full fast    The service bit slow  only reason gave 4 5  <EOR> Oyshi amazing menu top notch service clean contemporary setting! multiple times lunch dinner consistently great food! continue biweekly tradition! <EOR> Really great sushi! Very nice place people great  become new favorite place  Try bonsai roll  <EOR> Second time both times food great love environment but service lacking big time  thought first time maybe just short handed help  Nope same bad service again  If waiter would slow down little pay attention customers positive he would better tips  <EOR> I'm HUGE sushi guy  much spending over $150 isn't question some legitimately good fish   I came suggestion friend previously enjoyed it  decor very hip showed strong traditional Japanese aesthetic  eclectic mix hip hop playing background    So far good      Now here's where things down hill  friend ordered rolls appetizers  Soon waitress left waiter arrived edamame  politely asked if could extra pair chopsticks  technically wasn't extra pair never received pair but no biggie right? Wrong! server rude asked if sure  if reason lie  Dude don't utensils cares if pair give extra pair    Apparently though asking if sure wasn't enough  She looked under menu all over plates see if hadn't misplaced chopsticks  left bad taste mouth  would more polite expedient professional simply give extra pair  swear stealing your sticks lady!  Another point rubbed wrong way fact 30+ minutes only refill drink during last 3 minutes stay  kind sucked    The food ok  mussels pretty good  reason knocking place down 2 star review because food wasn't horrible ans because original server only imagine 'sensed' weren't having best experience tried best save night  little late  Although appreciate effort  rocked   Doubt back  If want good AYCE sushi Goyemon  If want really really good la carte sushi Yummy Sushi Grill off lake mead 95   Final word exiting restaurant couldn't help but notice B health rating  Now B isn't bad but standard pretty much expected any restaurant  If could I'd give place 2 5 5  <EOR> They all eat sushi! Anytime come back Vegas place must lunch dinner  <EOR> Sushi Sake Fun! place great! Fish 'ono  multiple times service always great! Definitely come check place if haven't! <EOR> This second time last  eating sushi over 14 years small step above supermarket quality  judge sushi base off its simplest form nigiri   2 components rice fish  None fish tastes fresh rice dry gives nigiri weird texture  almost rice undercooked underseasoned     The rolls weird although imaganitive unappetizing  combinations don't together don't sound would   wants mushroom asparagus sushi????  Bottom line if want real sushi don't come here   If you're group people looking place something everyone then ahead mistake come here   If ever come back friends won't eating  <EOR> We aren't Vegas whenever come always pay place visit since don't types AYCE sushi Hawaii especially price!  Kenny server he does such good job serving us  Last year when came visit he also server same great friendly service well    The only con could think uni 1 serving per person waaaah why? love uni!

Waiter horrible !  Won't back sure time  don't care close place is!!!!! <EOR> Tonight first time ever walked restaurant! walked debris floor  weren't greeted seated right away  When finally seated given dirty menus dripping sauce both sticky gross touch look at  Menu didn't any salmon hamachi collar any riceless rolls  settled popcorn scallops Iris special lovers roll all nigiri specials board  None which looked super appealing would normally order  weren't very many choices  super skeptical bc none people making food Asian  little biased since think Japanese should Japanese food Mexicans should Mexican food etc  All fish old  rice fresh  sauces unimpressive  hubby drew line seared garlic albacore  looked more jerky smelled terrible  He took little bite spit out  He told server sorry but very unsatisfied quality food  good thing she didn't put fight  left  Date night ruined  unless into cooked rolls only  Even then you're better off supermarket sushi  <EOR> AYCE sushi equivalent happiest place earth me  can't believe first time because many appetizer nigiri roll options  seriously impressed!   Sushi great quality seafood  fish rice ratio fair generous Sushi Neko but quality it  tried salmon tuna fresh scallop A MUST sweet shrimp uni oysters eel  appetizers best ever AYCE sushi restaurant  ahi poke shrimp tempura crunchy outside juicy inside mussels  mussels worse because wasn't creamy flavorful enough    Desserts AMAZING! more your usual ice creams mochi ice creams variety creme brûlées tiramisu etc  green tea creme brûlée more flavored whip cream opinion mine more thick creamy but still sweet good nonetheless    Service Kenny server he fantastic  super busy when came but he still found time attentive catered us  He made conversation suggestions when hesitant deciding order favorite items recommendations  Thanks judging when ordered 10 items first order lol    Overall Oyshi top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants  can't complain great service quality fish  definitely back! <EOR> Loved visit tonight Kenny amazing server customer service skills impeccable!

Geez  <EOR> Solid 4 stars first outing Oyshi Sushi!  For Holiday lunch December family some friends dined newer Oyshi Sushi Sahara   initial choice Makino's which isn't bad but figure Hell?  Let's try something new! Off Oyshi was!  On weekend lunch place wasn't overly busy thankfully   party 11 seated more private party room towards back restaurant   Lovely décor!  Except when looked HUGE mural party room put all together   it's Japanese dude   somewhat naked!  Ha Ha Ha but hey least didn't faze some awesome eats   Because couldn't decide order Oyshi's menu adults just ended getting all you can eat   $21 per person lunch   it's FRIGGIN' steal!  mean if you're gonna order more roll which average over $10 each easy then option way go   Also if you're sushi piggy ONLY option!  guarantee each rolls chose try upper price vicinity probably around $12 per roll     With Oyshi Sushi's all you can eat menu ALMOST free range entire menu   Most hot items signature sushi rolls available order   Only thing all you can eat?  Sashimi sashimi rice   of course   But  OK because much eat   And eat did!  felt bad folks because just kept ordering sushi roll sushi roll   just four folks family EASILY ordered least 12 signature rolls!  Oinkers!   including hot dishes ordered menu!  see getting all you can eat saves bunch $ when avid sushi eater   estimated total without all you can eat option would spent over $175 including tax tip!  Yowza!  OK just show some things ordered off menu and show Fatty McGee really when comes sushi Tiger Roll $12 Oyshi Roll $13 Love Affair $13 Dynamite Roll $11 Volcano $10 Lobster Fair $13 Rainbow Roll $11 Spider Roll $9 Red Dragon $11 Monster Roll $14 Premium Spider Roll $12 Ahi Poke $7 Tempura Shrimp $7 Yakitori Beef $4 Edamame $5 Potato Croquette $4 Gyoza $5 See mean??  ordered all for just FOUR us doesn't include multiple orders same sushi roll!  Add right see savings!  Save some money eat well!  any better that!?  Quality = Good!  Sushi rolls all made order cut fresh us   fish fresh day no fishy smells   sauces kept light side which appreciate because while everything starts tasting eel sauce if you're careful   Sushi rolls nice size well definitely bite size but tiny all order save them money   Rice fish ratio point very generous     At end meal which literally took over TWO hours also your choice dessert   Only say?  Yep no problem that   then most likely stuffed turkey all rice you've consumed   ending meal something light Mochi Ice Cream slice Green Tiramisu?  No problem   already feeling bad since think family alone ripped guys off!  Service party great considering party 11 taking space time   Luckily poor little Japanese server task large ordering shootout   mention parties SIX more automatically charged 18% gratuity   Boy did she earn it!  actually tipped extra over 18% show much appreciated little serving entire party seriously dainty girl no taller 4 feet 11 inches    eaters sure!  Combining other folks group easily ordered very least 25 sushi rolls      Will back again?  Yes yes will   Oyshi! <EOR> IN DEFENSE Christmas Eve  only disclaimer  service received horrendous nobody blame except owner because evidently she also server  understand busy holiday evening  However called prior arriving asked if  busy amd whether needed reservation  assured busy could just walk in  Once arrived informed tremendously busy must wait bar  proceeded sit next minor father bar which specifically states nobody under 21 allowed  Thereafter once seated orders placed ignored plates never cleared AYCE water filled despite asking  mere reason giving 3 STARS due Sushi Counter chef Pedro whom made otherwise disappointing experience tolerable   contunue visit Rainbow location  Merry Christmas  <EOR> Slow service  Food subpar nowhere near top quality sushi  Wouldn't back   Sumo sushi 2 waaaaaaay better <EOR> My family lunch today   all chose AYCE option   $21 lunch included almost everything menu no sashimi    husband ate 8 rolls!  food fresh came nice pace which gave more time relax talk each other   rushed no time limit AYCE places   don't eat fish seaweed surprised many choices AYCE well terriyaki chicken gyoza egg rolls miso soup salads vegetarian rolls soy wraps beef plates   highly recommend Grilled Beef Asparagus thinly sliced beef wrapped around asparagus spear grilled light sweet sauce top   Each AYCE lunch comes 1 dessert chocolate creme brulee absolutely fantastic!

Ambiance 4 epitome comfort Tables far away each other enough spread your leg arm span won't hit another person  But still far away enough can't hear conversations table next you!

Service 5 table service fast friendly attentive  restaurant wasn't busy all really able cater!   Food 3 Just other location also offer AYCE choice specialty desserts!   I'm usually huge fan food but quality rolls just good original location!
