Now loyal customer  <EOR> This pleasant surprise  way next door coffee *rise parked thought just late lunch 2 30   outside place much understated truly unimpressive but enter immediately realize owner put lot thought into making place comfortably chic more upscale most Thai restaurants   venue well lit large windows enough tinting very comfortable clean  cannot emphasize enough clean place looks     Lunch pricing lower average great value $7 9!!  only reinforced more reasonable portion size   place reeks great value least lunch   Considering first visit first review restaurant food wise would only read into lightly until couple more visits   The food came within 3 4 minutes order  Therefore onset service awesome kitchen fast perhaps fast  explain later staff very engaging attentive giving enough space crowd guest invisible positive way   filled beverage tea water without notice   The disappointment gist it  all restaurants eat   Therefore if food isn't stands over ambiance then place just okay   brown rice sticky pasty clear sign past its time rice cooker   order basic first time visit  Broccoli Chicken   mentioned earlier portion size generous least 8 ounces easily 5 oz chicken    chicken cooked well   vegetables soft over cooked   flavors over all spot on sauce delicious   suspect kitchen base  veggies broth sit pot  flash cook meats chicken beef pork shrimp per order throw into base plating   unfortunately cooking unbalanced   Say would P** W** chain but theirs cooked order   All order each time   Therefore veggies soggy only takes 3 4 minutes more   don't think anyone would balk if kitchen takes 10 minutes put your lunch order  all pass time soup comes meal anyway   Also salad greens Iceberg lettuce instead leafy mixed green which more nutritional value but hey under $8!! place would better serve customers if par cook veggies just keep stock separately compose ingredients upon each order   give place another couple tries dinner perhaps larger group experience better day   Every establishment entitled bad day  <EOR> Went late Thursday evening wasn't busy  crowd actually started come around 9 30pm finishing up  Staff friendly fairly attentive    We ordered pad Thai shrimp fried rice garlic pepper chicken Crying Tiger dinner  shrimp pad Thai fried rice huge good serving each dish  pad Thai delicious!
