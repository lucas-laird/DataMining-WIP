Came Sunday around 3pm seated really quickly  big group 15 people seated two tables    We asked server split bill table because such big group wanted split bill evenly    it no problem but don't think he communicated rest other servers   With said throughout meal 4 different servers would come left right give food didn't order  assumed weren't communicating splitting bill because tables would food but other table would stamp dim sum card   very confusing!!   We're dim sum experts course when little plates food ask which is   but some them don't speak English!! server shrugged said don't know YIKES!!
