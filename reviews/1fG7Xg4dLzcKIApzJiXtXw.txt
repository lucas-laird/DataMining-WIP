Also side note next shop puppies!! look many cute dogs afterwards  <EOR> I really place  Must try kkhangpung chicken kkhangpung shrimp! super crunchy outside sauce tastes sophisticated sweet sour sauce really good  jjambbong special jjajangmyeon well has more flavor regular jjm   never disappointed here  <EOR> I came thing thing only Jajangmyeon Korean Black Bean Noodles    It's generous bowl $7 99 served traditional accompaniments Takuan pickled daikon fresh onion vinegar concentrated black bean sauce   The sauce rather viscous could remedied simply adding water decent flavor  noodles okay albeit overcooked  Overall bad bowl Jajangmyeon but certainly special   There's much else say dish its preparation simple price inexpensive basically same everywhere  Bottom line Would come back Jajangmyeon? No    when better versions town  <EOR> Our first time unexpected we'll fair  asked mild mistake cuz still hot  sauce Thai style sweet sour extra chili kick  We'll ask sweet soy sauce instead  back try try other dishes  <EOR> So Authentic  ate everything ! definitely come black noodles kang pong chicken   Restaurant clean friendly service <EOR> I think place super underrated  love fried chicken shrimp thing  called kkhangpung chicken kkhangpung shrimp menu but no idea kkhangpung means  usually combo offer   I recall combo #1 comes fried chicken shrimp thing sweet sour pork choice jiajang myeon the black bean paste noodle Jjam pong spicy seafood noodle fried rice   I think combo #2 sweet sour pork fried chicken shrimp choice starch   Depends hungry usually rotate between combo #2 #1 occasional menu adventure  never disappointed food    There's time decided try mandu  When food came appeared 4 huge steam buns meat filling  really surprised because whenever order mandu Korean places always those tiny dumplings   I looked mandu wikipedia means mantou Mandarin  However mantou indeed steam bun but no fillings    Service always nice attentive  Definite recommend people want try some non Kbbq places  <EOR>
