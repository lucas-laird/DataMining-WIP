Green tea slight orange green tint much lighter taste  Black tea however dark orange brown color bold bitter taste when sweetened  being pressed time issue pushed any long boyfriend left unsatisfied service  miss days when would Starbucks would now order right every time  <EOR> This Starbucks location absolute WORST location Las Vegas  could understand extremely long lines inside if could actually decent drink  sure what's going but would say 60% drinks order sub par  matters worse staff rude inconsiderate  Everyone knows 12 noon only brew pikes roast  Every other Starbucks location happy pour over any other roast you'd however location Cactus Decatur  flat refuse pour over coffee act don't know talking about  only reason continue suffer abomination Starbucks location because unfortunately only coffee shop southern highlands area  feel need provide more training employees terms actual drink making customer service  <EOR> Enjoy coffee craving double espresso toasted coconut frappuccino  When ordering Starbucks stop shipping toasted coconut syrup  complain but Kevin register kind rude situation  Between taping finger sighing while trying figure wanted order since mods anything else  If wasn't being rude would issue  <EOR> Slowest Starbucks world  everyday doesn't seem improve  star since close house  prepared least 20 minutes drive thru  good day three cars line

another Starbucks southern highlands  <EOR> The employees nice they're typically busy doing jobs  reason give location only 3 stars because come pretty often seems every time order drink takes 10 15 minutes drink  Almost forgot it  Now could ask why don't just ask drink I'd say  because ordered drink once shouldn't again  Unfortunately can't give more stars because said happened multiple occasions  <EOR> I'm giving star location 2 stop lights house another coffee  However service absolutely terrible  drink order relatively simple 6 shots espresso coconut milk SF vanilla syrup over ice yet always waiting least 20 minutes no matter slow busy are  If order ahead wait even longer because claim order didn't print    I another Starbucks couple days ago person line front ordered 2 full carriers drinks 8 drinks exact 6 them frappuccinos drink less 5 minutes  there's no excuse location give less sub par service other give zeros fucks  <EOR> My review based numerous visits over past two years 1 star friendliness 2nd star location 3rd star cleanliness    I would say yes wait painful  Example way work just 6am only person drive thru could see store empty but still wait 10min iced coffee  Example 2 work coffee run wait over 20min drive thru    The lattes iced coffees strong other locations but always happy remake that could explain long waits I did give them star friendliness but would've given more stars if order right more often    It's very clean well stocked store treats bottles drinks    Location star because close home convenient exits  <EOR> One favorite Starbucks area noticed shorter wait time orders  Staff real nice friendly  Today store looked exceptionally clean considering busy   definitely come back location when area  <EOR> The SLOWEST Starbucks ever to  employees nice but extremely slow  other reviews said come if you're rush  should take 10 min iced black coffee  Horrible  <EOR> I never never write reviews   But being told couldn't something when pay $6 $7 sandwich joke   All wanted no cheese comes sandwiches   Every Starbucks ever taken off no issues   However she said she couldn't corrected her   She attempted telling she able take packaging even though always ordered sandwich it come packaging made any way  said she proceeded try  serious joke   literally spend much money place treated way taking cheese off panini straight ridiculous!
