He replied such broken english could understood   asked again  He replied same way some other words could understood   point said never mind hung up   then just car friends decided drive over   Mind location very small back off Tropicana pay attention when looking it     We decided inside see place before order   Mind parking limited   little 8pm did close until 10pm   Walked door locked   All lights but saw no inside    knocked few times then saw person motioned through drive through   no sign indicating dining room hours  piled back car around  Thank goodness only ones time see why later We pull around look menu decide wanted  big menu but all wanted try pastrami   then pull speaker notice another sign said pull window order  Really? pull guy ask order heavy accent which sounded very familiar person answered line when called   Note check video yelp guys talk to   think guy am speaking of   wanted 5 pastramis various different things them ordered he seemed hurry   When asked repeat order he repeated incorrectly over again   He said he but english poor best made difficult communicate ordered back sure he wanted   5 mins trying sure he understood wanted canceled pastrami frustration  I am glad window order never would worked through speaker waited 20 minutes complete  Turns he only person there   would think all write ups place would more people working prime time   when finally food checked he did fries incorrect but decided wait just on   time 3 other cars behind decided pray them time waiting would wait!!  The pastrami actually good the meat tender good flavor bread soft good fries but frustration trying inside ordering wait made less great experience   Note use 3rd party service deliver  deliver themselves service charge   Lastly ran mayo!!!! burger joint??!!   I would only back around lunch time when could inside  <EOR> Just left Sammy's L A  Pastrami  First non food negatory stuff  Parking nearly nonexistent   16 persons dining room full house but outdoor seating   area slightly questionable side drove around surrounding area  but doesn't deter seeking good food  ambiance? Well also doesn't deter me   That said L A  pastrami reg  heavy pastrami  only criticism needed bit more peppery  roll came little soggy dropped high expectation sandwich considering all rave reviews  Maybe being little rough maybe just spoiled having Better Los Angeles   But want taste here! Continuing   Plenty mustard could used few more pickles  Over all sandwich 10 napkins sixer   I think if use better roll pepper Pastrami maybe offer some those yellow peppers heat might something  <EOR> I sad planning Las Vegas trip couple weeks ago knowing place closed  no idea why but later found going open while town  planned trip months advanced time plan food destinations top ones list  saw food network combined two most favorite foods   Burgers Pastrami! try it!

Even if you've appetite I'd order something share instead individual plates  might also ease blow pricey menu  lot complaints customer service but service received great   Overall Sammy's stinks when comes visual appeal but if you're willing wait delicious fatty meal your place  <EOR> This place best quantity quality combo any pastrami joint  <EOR> Guess expected much food good nothing write home about  Friendly staff even though he swamped  Small place big portions though  <EOR> Paid $35 2 pastrami sandwiches 1 medium fries only 1 person running place waited over 2 hours  food only end runs NEVER AGAIN!!! <EOR> We La pastrami cheese garlic ramano fries pomegranate lemonade blueberry custard shake   Portions perfect sharing between 2 people! everything delicious!!!

Its simply unorthodox specially when pricing seems less frugal  paid $15 $22 total Gyro didn't even come fries tzatziki sauce honestly all supporting local joints but really let down big time Instead tzatziki sauce received appeared some odd thick white cream paste which wasn't very good somewhat off putting flavor    Needless say today's experience left bitter taste mouth [no pun intended] When comes GOOD food certainly open wallet but case price simply DOES justify food received feel anyone pay $15 plain gyro almost insulting specially when 10lb sack potatoes only $1 99 business owner myself refuse see adding fries meals hinders restaurants profit margins any way  <EOR> I came once before several years ago before Yelp good  around time tv shows getting local awards  Now think death knell sounding place  Lunch time visit only person working   ??

You seriously throw dart menu hit something taste amazing  recommend place everyone  Even if you're picky eater just chicken fingers  <EOR> Oh boy    where start? go to place frequented some time now  epitome hit miss   no mistake when hit home run can't stop eating  When miss throw away what's left ordered  give 2 examples of many emphasize mean  mini corn dogs when correct batter such hand delicious  When don't? try concoct different batter dogs un bearable  Sandwiches same experience total hit miss  night particularly fiending ordered meal mozzarella sticks  ready it? Multiple mozzarella sticks were    EMPTY! Just shell no cheese all  never experienced anything that  different cooks different times never know you're going get   I'm big proponent consistency when comes food  Although really GOOD bad outweighs good unfortunately  Typically don't rate place based visit  least 2 3 should show good foundation    I don't know if owners changed whatever but quality definitely isn't top priority  want again but opt somewhere else because never know going get   I included pic sake confirmation  <EOR> As you'll see previous review love pastrami  love garlic fries  even around trying custard shakes rib eye steak fries fried mushrooms gyro big ass bacon cheeseburger corned beef sandwich lemonades 3 5 years since wrote review  fact bet husband eaten picked takeout 25 times since wrote it  But those days might over   The customer service become literally joke  we'll steel ourselves jokes bad it'll time before walk door won't boil over anger  used only bad night then weekends now basically any time any day  only customers joint we'll wait quite while because they're busy  doesn't matter  Why should put nice no matter work retail face *when customer* because guys rude? hit backwards headed home joked must deal unpleasant hostile customers  just forget drive thru  Come inside  I note afternoon early evening great service but because 2 people working relief because family town but  literally only exception  Why usually only 1 person working especially night? Isn't dangerous? Also quality construction some dishes vary widely depending when they're made  meats usually same amount I'm guessing use scale but sometimes bread cut weird special fries insanely heavy handed sauces chili    next time less even pictured  mean guess all making dish but over years you'd think things wouldn't de evolve know mean? Especially prices gone I stuff costs more expect least some regularity   All all food delicious  Sometimes literally crave it  But pay dollars patience  See ya Sammy  <EOR> I remember when shammys first opened several years ago gyro little expensive but really really good few years ago  Today driving said well pick sandwich pull into drive because no damn parking whatsoever sitting drive least 10 minutes nobody comes thinking maybe they're closed around block try find parking spot smell rancid oil hit ton bricks now there's only two people eating guy back standing inside now register waiting wait must waited eight 10 minutes didn't even say I'd turned around walked wouldn't even give 1 star  few years sure great would let dog eat there <EOR> I night 10 2 famed LA Pastrami Sandwich  Although flavor similar The Hat Cali meat very dry if spent much time flattop  seemed Crusties dirty flattop no wasn't pepper meat bread  Sadly threw sandwich away spending small fortune large feed wife I   Again similar flavor true LA Pastrami but quality very disappointing  all good comments read sandwich expecting high quality received Subway quality pastrami  did excellent shake though shake deserves 2 stars gave  <EOR> So originally LA craving pastrami fries when found sammys thought hit jackpot      service slow more meat fries mention meat still came cold     <EOR> Why keep coming back expecting more?!  third time entering shoppe but left only twice full stomach   Found discount BOGO Sandwiches today upon entering only honors $10 credit     why just say $10 credit instead BOGO *  Prices store synced prices online which also displeasing   Also cash friendly pull your card expect 20% surcharge All plastic payments  First time coming in food well prepared pictures easy eyes sight others  plates ready order 1 everything   chili cheese fries egg OMGoodness must see believe it!
