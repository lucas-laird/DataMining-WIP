Awesome   still think abt those all time   many flavors made right spot fresh!!! <EOR> I taste Cousins Main Lobster recent event  remembered hearing Shark Tank super excited   They definitely served solid lobster roll  probably purest ever no mayo just butter perfectly toasted bun  Served lemon!  Not sure better some lobster places New York area but see major treat NV area  am excited try out! <EOR> I've ordered Cousins twice now  first time amazing! Connecticut Lobster Roll order plain tater tots which lived expectation much more! second time around wanted explore menu ordered shrimp tacos  know why order shrimp tacos lobster truck right? Well stop any future person ordering them definitely worth it! would think pay right? whole taste overall eating fish sticks  No flavor all  attached picture zoom shrimp miniscule  Probably smaller chopped tomatoes  Next time stick only lobster items off menu  <EOR>
