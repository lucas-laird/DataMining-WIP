Only waited 15 20 food arrive waiter Sam very accommodating! Drinks very good ordered Cosmo pop margarita! <EOR> Last time pizza bomb    time suuuuper fucking greasy bread thin couldn't even lift slice without breaking off sliding     lame    walked Ceasars specifically slice    bummer <EOR> I came mom brother boyfriend's mom lunch Christmas   I ordered Blanca pizza which did like  Usually am huge fan white cheese pizza but something just didn't work    Note pizzas big enough 2    My mom ordered meatball sub which actually pretty good  didn't care chips came side   say apple squash soup good   For dessert vanilla ice cream sandwich  came thin crispy wafer   different but good   The service wasn't good   Maybe because server work Christmas but way  When done sat dirty dishes front long time before anyone came ask if wanted boxes dessert   waters also completely empty hunt server down   manager came check but didn't want anyone trouble  Food wasn't great neither service     2 pizzas 2 subs soup 2 sodas dessert came $125   I'll try something different if next time    <EOR> Stayed Aria decided dinner place since seen plenty great reviews Yelp   Needless say Yelpers right money   place only great service attentive servers also really great pizza!

Found funny all advertised 'Truffle' items tried Vegas weak flavor   never issue L A  suppose they're more generous here   Service excellent though which standard any NY style eateries visited within city  Super flirtatious entertaining character behind counter firing pies kept winding up  Found humorous  Overall stuffed rim satisfied  <EOR> Awesome pies    take counter    slice     Didn't eat dining room but slices take out counter phenomenal     Dat forager doe <EOR> Took FARMSTEAD whole pizza Chop salad   Pretty reasonable price pizza place right casino but pizza soft middle crust which but gross amateur under cooked crust!  also topping just don't smell good? sure was!   chop salad overdressed strong dressing masked all salad taste!  hate antipasti salad taste looks it? Should said menu? The good cooked crust very good <EOR> Das Personal sehr nett  Die Auswahl Bier nix Getränken war sehr gering aber die Pizza und auch das garlic breed waren Super   Wir fanden es lecker das wir sogar zweimal dort waren <EOR> I hesitant try pizza Vegas many other options try   looking light lunch slice margherita pizza hit spot  cute place watch football game beer slice pizza away smokiness casinos   say sucker thin crust brick oven pizza   recommend anyone stops Aria  <EOR> As far pizza concerned three pizzas varied good lousy  major complaint crust soggy  limp but soggy wet dish towel why limp    The Gotham tasted good crust soggy   The Forager tasted good cust soggy following nightmarish Pizza but far crisp   The North Beach just horrid  Clams shell just baked top pizza? did miss here? Why include clams if pizza could absorb flavor seafood? Crust MESS! Clam liquid obviously bubbled onto pizza just soaked pizza  complete FAIL!  The wings meh ok chain restaurant type place   The server Aaron I think name excellent  He professional helpful true bright spot experience  <EOR> We ordered garlic knots marguerita pizza which both excellent  plenty food two moderate eaters  televisions playing good game place crowded nice atmosphere  However problem came when two couple sat food before us  thought strange mentioned partner also noticed  then wait another 15 minutes order come out  <EOR> The slice counter awesome! Great value higher end pizza strip  If fan greasy pepperoni cheese other joints give shot! <EOR> The pizza good but then again kinda hard mess up  If looking quick fix you're City Center then I'd recommend it  wouldn't say worth going your way try  <EOR> Nice ambiance excellent service    We chopped salad cheese pizza dinner    The chopped salad little small side but delicious  substituted avocado salami very happy change us    The pizza delicious   Heavy sauce dare say much good quality cheese   could done maybe 30% less cheese  crust where pizza failed  center part soggy  outer half crispy delicious    With many great pizza options town sure I'd come back   Life short soggy crust  <EOR> When first saw signs place opening soon excited  sure why but guess good advertising  going first time wasn't impressed  wasn't bad anything but def wasn't memorable  ordered Gotham pizza which comes pepperoni sausage salami  little much me    During most recent Restaurant Week noticed good lunch deal friend decided give another try  saw including deal seemed better idea just order wanted  probably came same price good wanted eat   The garlic knots decent  Nothing rave about  pizza cooked wood fired oven 550 degrees  time ordered cheese pepperoni  wasn't bad but said its favorite memorable  service wasn't great  took while drink refills weren't even busy  Overall think place expensive quality  Considering location guess would less expensive other options though   Tip sell pizza slice  would good option if you're staying hotel need something fast  <EOR> Good place quick bite eat  staying Aria rather eat expensive meal every meal while Vegas stopped Five50 Pizza Bar lunch couple times during stay  Once ate table other time ate bar  service good  food good ordered pepperoni pizza margherita pizza caesar salad  restaurant also offered slices to go which great option those really need grab quick bite  Might stop again if we're Vegas staying Aria again  <EOR> We party 8 took less 10 minutes seated  server pretty cute friendly  ordered WAY much food table  total ordered 4 whole pizzas Gotham x2 North Beach Farmstead Forager   should've asked server see if she'd think 4 much T T ate 3 5 all pizzas ordered  more enough breakfast tomorrow   The Gotham your typical meat lover's pizza  all finished first pretty quickly also  never wrong meat over's pizza if fancy protein red meat   The North Beach really good  wish more but trying avoid seafood thise weekend allergies clan put top each slice bomb  Really isolated whole pizza itself really taste it   The Farmstead most disliked pizza  many flavors going off time but salty flavor dominated everything  very distasteful me  8 only 1 didn't mind much  guess most leftovers  tasted okay being intoxicated still tasted salty sour taste though   The Forager    can't really remember pizza well  really liked Gotham North Beach Farmstead ruined appetite bit  wasn't bad though  barely any left probably 1 2 slices  remember yolk though  tasted awkward first but then tastes good afterwards   I probably come again though just because many restaurants Vegas tried before played didn't really 'wow' me  Probably because Farmstead    lol  Service great  Watched baseball game while waiting food  Lost Parley  Ate some good pizzas ate bad pizza  Spent good amount dough some dough  <EOR> I always white pizza slice beer  prefer sit bar more lively beer prompte   The pizzas outstanding especially white sauce ones    Only thing beers $9 which bit much even Norwegian used such prices  <EOR> I like! Keep mind based eating slice 2am while half crocked but slice perfectly charred crust gooey quality mozzarella right amount sauce hot brick oven! <EOR> Good tasty pizza  Quality toppings  Cheese bread good too  Meat Cheese tray decent  Priced high IMO but  part being Aria Vegas  Service good plenty TV's watch sports  sell pizza slice to go  Worth stopping bite though  <EOR> Awesome!!!!!! Great truffle salami pizza pig truffle homemade meatball  Also oxtail macaroni garlic bread  <EOR> First time eating here  arrived around 2pm seated immediately  server pleasant enough but whose name escapes took orders quickly brought drinks right away   We ordered Gotham pizza share which Italians say mezza mezza   tasted great fresh meat toppings perfectly cheesed but crust consistent thickness  Some slices evenly thin crusted center edges some thick edges the way used being NY but paper thin middle toppings oil soaked through all fell apart   I'm no means cheap certainly understand strip pricing Vegas especially since work same hotel place resides but pizza carried $28 price tag 6 slices plus $4 50 each 6 tall x 2 diameter glass iced tea almost  1 2 full crushed ice can't help but feel could put $40 better use elsewhere lunch  Also disappointment which won't apply most people but mention anyway fact don't honor any sort employee discount making first place personally MGM lineup stiffed employee ID  Boo that  All things considered I'd give experience 6 10 think likely last time there  <EOR> The best thing place single slice pizza $5 5   Those slices fly off shelves good chance getting freshly baked one   Crust good balance crispness softness  Flavor bit strong taste  <EOR> Great pizza! Youll night if want good service speaking experience but  ! <EOR> Don't let them fool size pizza   beginning wonder if try think small size order appetizer   ordered Gotham pizza lots yummy protein not   But started chopped salad also very yummy then came pizza   Rolled pretty content  <EOR> Aria lean late night snacking opportunities   When midnight need quick bite eat Five50 Pizza best option something grab n' go   if 12 45 a m  on Thursday night during Spring Break know last slices pizza pie going fast   scored slices Pineapple Express which pineapple jalepeno peperoni yum!    For best part late night side show   Imagine alcohol infused grown men rushing clock ticks down closing time 1 00 a m  for week night 3 00 a m  FRI SAT    First see fellas jostle line school kids waiting class   Quickly followed adult hissy fits when pizza run out   Whaa!  Vegas good times but little savvy strategic planning helps  <EOR> Seriously can't believe haven't wrote review place because seriously stole heart! bf travel Vegas once month stopping 16inch pepperoni mushrooms pizza non negotiable  pizza far best ive ever crust delicious cook brick oven gives fire flavore  If haven't tried place your taste buds hating right now! <EOR> Really liked atmosphere! Great tables chairs ambiance! Wait staff somewhat aloof but pretty nice same time  salad figs pomegranate seeds quite good yet bit small price  pizza decent but nothing write home all  crust ok but quite tough chew  think dough bit dense over kneaded  sauce fine cheese decent without being great  enjoyed time would give 3 5 if could  would say bad place check but many other options $26 margherita pizza bit silly side terms price silly being code word ridiculous even comparison other Vega$ places  <EOR> This place looked great reviewing menu looking appeared real quality ingredients  pizza did fresh quality ingredients but flavor just wasn't there  Bland lot pop definitely far would considered good pie  thought given location place would rock but sadly fell short  prices bad considering casino service good  server knowledgeable very polite honestly best part experience  Beer selection alright but really would call craft beers  carry your run mill really popular brands but hoping some smaller lesser known brands really set place apart average place  Overall bad if your pinch but lot places around ARIA eat offer more flavor more value  <EOR> The pizza more solid both slice whole pie  When staying Aria Mandarin Oriental need quick bite go to nice beer list well  Only 4 stars because overpriced service hit miss  <EOR> Our first time restaurant usually just pick pizza bar  Made reservations wait even though some empty tables  Service okay pitchers slow coming table  Pizza delicious but probably just stick grabbing pizza bar future  <EOR> Great pizza service! waiter Aaron friendly efficient  definitely back next time Vegas  <EOR> Absolutely amazing pizza  bought pizza slices size really big  dough delicious crispy edges  sauce very tasty many ingredients top it  place itself look nice staff kind    I great meal once again surely  must try it  <EOR> Been least 5 times always good maybe best pizza Vegas  Still try few more but 5 50 winning pizza race  <EOR> We blast party 15!

Enjoy! <EOR> Grab slice decent wood fired pizza coffee great hangover cure  cant wrong simple quality ingredients!  The lines long evening especially when Cirque show finishes many people famished want quick bite eat  <EOR> Ordered pizza poker room pizza came surprisingly fast  Took bite totally cold  Plus burnt spots top  Told food runner  She asked did already take bite  Obviously able tell cold  She took back kitchen stuck back oven came back even more black course  Probably should just ate cold    completely let down <EOR> Some best Pizza outside Italy New York! came twice grab slice lunch during recent stay Aria  first time Gotham slice which some great tasting meats but star show 5 cheese me  just right amount cheese blended together delicious gooey topping  tomato sauce good tang wasn't sweet crust golden delicious    I wish stayed open later though would perfect snack refuel gambling habit  <EOR> Fantastic food  thinking pizza months now  pizzas delicious  service completely sucks though  workers very rude  Other would definitely recommend place! <EOR> For those aria know rather upscale ritzy place  really type place you'd imagine pizza slice bar right? Enter Five50    a sit down Italian restaurant serving artisan specialty pizza well typical overpriced dishes huge selection craft beer  Sit down group expect your tab high hundreds    Then aria decided try cosmo in opinion added line sells slices pizza  no cannot single slice when sit down inside 3 4 types choose from    Cheese meat slice veggie slice rotating seasonal slice  all them  find pizza very artisinal If sense  crust more wood fire baked pizza stone fired pizza etc  chewy yeasty quite good especially if you're into type thing   All slices just under $6 tax all them good  tomato sauce A1   i thinking head pizza 3 5 but then sauce really just pushes 4  its probably best pizza sauce ive had  overly sweet nice zest complements crust perfectly    The overall atmosphere kind weird   can't walk slice feel normal walking through casino pizza  right next sports bar right across high limit slots   strange  However think aria did nice job trying combine atmosphere place guests drunk quick food without leaving property  #1 choice but 2nd still solid  <EOR> If you're area hankering pizza head over five50  Let's call place 3 5  Midwesterners beware thin crust pizza joint!  We pressed time 30 40 minute window eating  service accommodating just time  ordered pizza half North Beach half Margherita  slices large thin pizza enough two people full three slices per person  pizza thin crust but still slight chew crunch which enjoyed  North Beach smoked mozzarella clams described bbq chicken pizza chicken swapped clams  unique tender clam pieces but think planted dangerous seed since found myself wishing dash bbq sauce! Margherita pizza nothing special just big basil leaf each slice  <EOR> Not only pizza very good thin crust very good any crust  Service above average very quick  Prices LAS pretty reasonable  Nice decor  <EOR> Walking through Aria saw numerous huge pizza boxes leaving Five50   Upon further inspection determined menu looked pretty good looked Neapolitan style pizza cooked pizza oven favourite!  We didn't reservation ended waiting 20 minutes before being seated   Funny because when seated found probably 30% restaurant's tables empty   Maybe understaffed particular Saturday night?  The server did extremely slow everything taking order bringing drinks refilling water then finally taking forever bring bill   There four each ceaser salads determined we'd share truffle margherita pizzas   salads great no complaints margherita pizza   truffle pizza completely overwhelming think put off truffles little while!  much truffle!!  Ultimately looking back much time spent debating over which pizzas choose think some choices little seemed something each them group couldn't handle   Definitely wouldn't return Five50 considering all other choices food Vegas   more stars Vegas leave feeling only satisfied but I'd return another meal  <EOR> I really enjoyed place recent visit Aria Casino  located near sports book which plus me   pizza great nice selection local craft beer which nice since visiting town   5 Stars all way! <EOR> By the slice pizza places dime dozen Strip they're great solo travelers budget minded folk alike clocking anywhere $6 12 person meal offering plenty variety  Unfortunately quality usually par your local mall food court    Five50 different  only easy find within casino straight through lobby left parking garage but priced cheap $5 50 slice including specialty styles but doesn't taste it  any given day four featured pies available slice Gotham meat heavy Forager cheese mushrooms cheese only version featured daily special    if slice isn't also offer extended menu whole pies along salads sandwiches shakes small plates  But pizza obviously highlight  <EOR> Surprised sports bar replaced pizza  always little wood fired thin crust pizza late night gaming     The restaurant closes midnight but slice bar open till 2am     Wanted customize watch adds fast sausage meatball spinach basil eggplant   Final tally close $40 slices huge really great crust abundance ingredients each bite   Wait time 20 minutes     If you're just wanting light snack between two people would suggest ordering slice whole pie WAY much pizza tummies happy today  <EOR> Beer mac'cheese 5! Lick spoon bowl good! Holy sh!t  Margherita pizza awesome  Left cheese coma  Ahhhhhh <EOR> Fantastic pizza!  Perfect crust  Just chewy enough toppings delicious  better half meat pizza shared Gotham spinach mushroom forager Blanca  All great  ricotta best  Best meal since here  Also very reasonably priced  <EOR> It's perfect snack during night if hungry  Good pizza  Portion huge  <EOR> I liked Five50 Pizza Bar  much fact ended coming twice course night Aria  easy comfortable spot dinner well drinks dessert some time casino floor  only problem Five50 Pizza Bar pizza no good   We came early Sunday dinner driving LA no particular plans  thinking leaving Aria which where staying but inertia best when stumbled across pizza place right sports betting station  only 5 30 but hungry time road restaurant beautifully empty   I liked vibe place  Very much piece Aria ritzy modern high ceilings interesting decor but casual fuss free  large bar ended being half point place service solid  ended coming back couple more friends when needed place catch later night  brought leftover pizza them eat server didn't call having take out box table   That pizza though some worst while  no contest when measured against others its price range  expensive personal pies just didn't taste good  flawed basic level limp greasy way much cheese  toppings good least  Catania came white sauce garlic purée Italian sausage rapini roasted tomato Forager white sauce mushrooms bacon whipped ricotta spinach  Pretty good ideas but enough redeem pizzas   Weirdly everything else great  beet salad excellent colorful mix local beets watercress farro pumpkinseed vinaigrette grissini  friends doesn't burrata goat cheese  accommodating kitchen nice substitution  When came back dinner some kind craft beer tap I forget which but good one partook couple decadent milkshakes  Vegas root beer float satisfying shake loaded vanilla ice cream caramel Butterfinger crumbles Boylan's root beer  mint chocolate swirl mixed mint ice cream chocolate syrup chocolate mint cookies  what's there?

Creamsicle  float simply stunning Absolut Mandarin most memorable drink Vegas  back more sure! <EOR> The most amazing texture pizza crust ever savory macaron crisp outer melt your mouth soft inner  Toppings good throughout first slice but rapidly dull lower quality ingredients? Over done? Perhaps just masked much mediocre cheese? But perhaps  critical  Overall Five 50 great pizza experience winking waiter shmarmy Vegas charm  <EOR> Chef Shawn McClain going on     pizza okay LOVE 'pizza' place bomb   Great selection cool atmosphere awesome service   Weeee did mention love pizza? <EOR> We ate family lunch  started wings which really good great sweet spicy flavor  liked fact pizzas thin cooked brick oven style  main entree Gotham pizza  loaded lots meat  also margarita pizza  3 pizzas total more enough share  asked nicely changed nearby tv game wanted watch  Score! place looks would tasty late night option  <EOR> Great pizza delicious sandwiches lovely decor fast service prices aren't outrageous Vegas  <EOR> Pizza excellent  Charred crust typical New York style pizza  Gotham added mushrooms which delicious  shakes very good option add liquor to  <EOR> Excellent!

Generally speaking service friendly non smiling host very low paced server    Come guys expect here  probably don't care most clients tourists you'll never see again but very disappointing locals  BTW love wooden wall! <EOR> Margherita pizza good! also ordered calamari appetizer which did love  Calamari tender breading crunchy but did love dipping sauce would preferred marinara rather aoili pepper flavor  Just prefer traditional over version wouldn't order again but would definitely back pizza! <EOR> The perfect meal long night strip  Definitely gave life all drinking  garlic bread literally heaven plate  could eaten all day! <EOR> Great place recovery meal large group  Blanca Gotham pizzas best!

Once finally acknowledged took another 5 minutes bring over carafe water  I understand seemed only 3 servers   but again place crowded   servers weren't much rush either   The food itself very very good its presentation   mac cheese friend wings   If rating Five50 solely based food I'd give 4 stars   service definitely merits no more 2 stars though   While waitress friendly lack attention length time took water food really ask anything additional needed just way beyond should been   patient when need place packed servers running around    but didn't merit much patience not crowded servers chatting instead checking guests   As mentioned previously definitely give another chance try pizza   If ever come back sit down meal though bring bottle water anticipate delayed service  <EOR> All pizzas 16 inches 6 slices say portion two people but perfect three  ordered half truffle half pepperoni 4 5 arugula fennel salad 0 5  pizza very good but little greasy  salad horrible!

Peppers? Olives? Mushrooms?  However anything above minimal serving meat would push price well above $30 since each ingredient adds another $2  those want spend $30 40++ 16 pizza wish them well   Wolfgang Puck's Crystal Shopping Mall attached ARIA better pizza 1 2 price  <EOR> Absolutely loved place  Came dinner however opted take instead save some time  Ordered furgrov pizza which mushrooms spinach rosemary ricotta  yummy  New York style pizza thin crust just pizza    Since pizza bar also offer individual slices $5 50 hence creative name    It's located Arya casino resort  <EOR> The server Amanda lacking here   food little pricey tasted fine but server she rude slow made entire table feel unwelcome    came Tuesday night when particularly busy   seemed only server 8 more tables  waited awhile until Amanda came table   She seemed highly annoyed really short us   felt bothering her   Two pizzas two appetizers took 30 mins appear someone suit brought table   nice bus boy refilled water doing all busy work Amanda   work foods industry did everyone table   could tell Amanda lot tables but watched poor bus boy all heavy lifting while she just kind drifted around dining room    When group asked box  more attitude   Amanda annoying inattentive lazy  When come back hope she's there   service really overshadowed food time  <EOR> Considering lived NYC area entire life would never thought best pizza ever would Nevada  point stop here   not every time Las Vegas but everyday Las Vegas  <EOR> Updating review because quality really declined over last year  Service frequently inattentive forget your drink order leave waiting long awkward etc  Quality food varies too  recently salad mostly arugula stems pizza where forgot sauce then added blobs pizza cooked  fact anyone allowed food leave kitchen sad  coming years we're unlikely return again  <EOR> 28 bucks specialty pizza  cheap but strip want?
