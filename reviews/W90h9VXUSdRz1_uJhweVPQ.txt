Coming SF Bay Area share ramen I'd say we're pretty good critics it! Aside oddly small servings meat would say ramen portions general also smaller typical bowl  all pretty full but left wishing more  Service friendly great no problems there  price bit high $16 17 bowl especially portions but price seems normal being Vegas let alone strip  I'd say give try if you're near needing ramen noodle soup fix whether help hangover simply some soothing comfort food! <EOR> Great food great service great atmosphere   came bachelorette dinner perfect   asked chef bring recommendations disappointed   pork buns octopus tofu donuts chicken lamb fried rice good! wait staff very attentive made night really special   high class food but relaxed mellow atmosphere   sure recommend others back future   place really lives hype!! must!! <EOR> The Korean wings good but shrimp ramen no flavor  broth didn't taste anything although 3 pieces shrimp good  wish didn't pay $17 soup  <EOR> The food fantastic!

Very tasty flavorful even bowl Ramen Craving right now      <EOR> I am able say am first people experience Yusho Las Vegas   industry professional am happy say am impressed entire package  Usually restaurants expect lot kinks food service but tonight genuinely impressed    First just entering Yusho set tone greeted warmly hostesses management  excellent vibe please come great time  being escorted table multiple members service staff touched table introduced themselves   There great selection craft draft cocktails well sake Japanese whiskey choose    The food spot on!  Caramelized kimchee yakitori glazed octopus start  griddle cake solid well chub sausage steam bun  tempura best Las Vegas  friends sampled almost entire menu  say quality food price paid Yusho earned business  <EOR> I am really sure which way review   food service great but left feeling bit ripped off   When new businesses open growing pains to say least    usually give them benefit doubt but case they've open 3 months most issues encountered avoidable   First made reservation via Open Table month ago   When approached host desk she trouble locating it   desk seemed very disorganized post notes everywhere she couldn't find ours   Luckily she found computer seated only couple minutes   exactly seamless arrival though   It took 10 minutes before server approached table drink order   Although she very nice wasn't busy night am sure problem was   time pretty much ready order but some questions menu   drink wanted Chuhai available because run out   just seems strange run your signature cocktails?  Anyhow server completely knowledgable menu even said guys really testing tonight! inquired Omakase works   She said could choose 6 courses ourselves Chef us   experience always good Chef's choices  did     Now am totally familiar restaurant but heard known 2x fried chicken steam buns ramen   excited try much possible but understood couldn't try everything   Server brought place settings many forks knives ramen spoon   excited know would getting ramen   First seasonal salad   really liked dressing I think yuzu vinagrette   pretty good even managed eat chopsticks! The next course menu   Aji Spanish Mackerel   presentation bit creepy but fish super fresh really delicious   something would ordered myself but very good   Next Xin Jiang Lamb Duck Breast   lamb came skewer cumin cucumber salad side   pleasantly surprised dish   great smoky flavor could tell cooked open grill   more steak lamb   also liked addition cumin side dipped lamb seasoning then cucumber sauce delish!  The presentation duck breast actually made look very appetizing but looks definitely deceiving  duck breast stuffed shitake mushrooms wrapped bacon served top shitake marmalade extra mushrooms   really liked would definitely order again   We then received Hamachi Kama which definitely something would've chosen but AMAZING!  served thai peanut sauce coconut slaw some greens well   dove right then realized seaweed wraps well maybe supposed wraps fish peanut sauce slaw?  wasn't explained when food brought table ended just eating fish   Which fine because really good am huge fish eater   We then expected ramen but never came   fact then received dessert   really disappointed didn't ramen steam buns 2x fried chicken at least them would've nice    top desserts just good   served doughnuts which just strange but ended being better 2   tofu doughnuts sweet potato rosemary   topping purple which just weird The other dessert soft serve hate say but disgusting   menu says coffee soft serve Fernet caramel pop rocks nori   First all love coffee ice cream but inedible   Also am sure decided use fernet caramel but just wrong   Lastly no sign pop rocks nori which ok because doesn't even sound would made dish any better!  This good ending decided order bowl ramen share since expected during meal never it  Logan Poser Ramen  OK  really liked crispy pork came with   Overall decent experience  would definitely back but adding courses no way food $200  Then additional $60 drinks? casual place doesn't quite match vibe  think slight identity crisis  <EOR> The hamachi Kama really yummy  fish amazing miso tastes could your own sushi rolls it  also tempura veggies chicken ramen  chicken ramen okay but other dishes better! service little slow but ask side peanut sauce it's fantastic!!! <EOR> Stopped dinner prior show while food great first service slow staff did try hard accommodate much could   It shouldn't take 25 minutes time sit down until time first food brought table  when mostly ramen noodles  mean kind time? sure didn't  25 minutes flagged down waiter tell please step up   So when food arrived pleased dug into immediately  bowl ramen fish balls another bowl ramen fried sliced chicken breast  thought mine just fine but Mom insisted salty enjoy  sent back  waiter said chef added some hot water certainly improved vastly   So while would say two stars add great staff tried hard right  <EOR> The service excellent! food way exotic tourist   enjoyed service far but restaurant food way sweet me   thinking would more savory because noodles   huge fan would come back   however enjoy service lot!  Great team please fix menu come back  <EOR> Reviewing salad Vegas might seem crazy  Eating salad Vegas might seem crazy  But salad place stellar perfectly dressed tart lovely yuzu vinagrette  Fresh fruit  Pistachios  big old mess mixed greens   If need salad fix while strip head Monte Carlo  Mmmmm <EOR> I seen advertisement place through room mgm grand  ramen place Denver love thought if ended over near hungry might give try  walking around saw decided share noodle bowl  intended ordering shrimp ramen but server steered pork ramen saying would better  known for  also love kimchi decided try something new $4 piece order oyster sesame kimchi local ramen place amazing house made kimchi Japanese pickles  Everything ordered bad  flavors off  ramen chunk something crispy it  thought oddly toast  No large cake shredded pork put back together fried  Gross  <EOR> Our group seven each ramen bowl  Three steamed buns  each also drinks  friend whiskey sampler  Each tried sip delicious whiskeys  cucumber tini sweet refreshing  booze cola similar long island  Each ramen broths full flavor  butter bowl rich full umami  buns nice small bite gave good idea flavors meats ramen  party said possibly second best meal he ever had  definitely recommend trying restaurant delicious dinner  <EOR> I might give place 3 1 2 stars  place opened week ago just try because monte carlo where usually stay at   Let first off saying service itself very good since main guy Cory came table asking everything making sure happy  He even gave complimentary shashito pepper app which very good  Thks Cory  ok now rest    We ordered housemade pickles pork shoulder bun steak nori chicken wings shrimp ramen mushroom ramen     The house made pickles actually good  fresh tangy refreshing  But $9 worth it  server also came picked dish without asking if done pickles took away when pickle still left dish  $9 im going eat all pickles but unable since server took off table   The chicken wings good taste them enjoyed most part   would chicken wings more well done crispier served   but overall bad  $9   same price pickles which no sense   The pork shoulder bun good  very good flavor  but bun cold  Im sure sitting outside played role bun being cold   but kinda expected hot soft steaming bun  But maybe thats its suppose served  not hot  bun $9  FOR ONE! cmon  i surely thought served two  but did warn just one    Steak Nori very very good  good flavors meat tender nori dry crispy  how should be  the mushrooms top very nice flavor  but $39 worth all    The shrimp ramen good most part  the only thing broth  it tasted very shell fishy  the noodles cooked good shrimp awesome  but broth taste little off  ramen served tiny bowl which seemed large drinking cup  $22 worth all   The mushroom ramen good enjoyed it  no complaints all  the mushrooms good tofu good flavor nooodles cooked al dente which like  broth good flavor love soft boiled eggs egg which soft yoke  Again served tiny bowl   not worth $17   Finally shasito peppers  only complaint   wish cooked lil bit more  but thats just them but free best!!  Ok   overall bad  flavors but food could better  Cory kept asking liked it  and told good  i really didnt complain because MAIN problem price portion size which he cant really anything about  Would back Yusho?    maybe if someone treated me  but would again those prices  the prices ridiculously high portion size quality    Cory  lower prices give bigger portions  then maybe il return  anyways thks experience Update 11 29 14 visit    I revisted place because inthe mood some ramen  I figured its while mustve improved some negatives mentioned  above  Well didnt   portions r still small ramen   only thing did serve ramen bigger bowl making seem portions bigger  kimchi ramen broth plain  needed spices seasoning something  Anyways wont coming back place unless im forced drunk dont know any better because im starving thats only place open  <EOR> We wanted grab bite eat way watch Blue Man stopped Yusho grab some ramen   ramen all spectacular IMO  Half table ordered Logan Ramen  broth quite sour did well pork bowl  charge extra bean sprouts herbs dish which pretty outrageous  Portions quite small well price range $16 bowl even full   Even drinking cups small  server literally came around 10 times refill drinks   strip can't expect much   best foods always outside strip    <EOR> Delicious noodle soup w great ingredients   Totally worth cost   buns amazing too  <EOR> The service fine  selection Japanese whiskey?
