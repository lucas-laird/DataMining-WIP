Qdoba chain restaurants serves fast fresh Mexican inspired food   vegetarian close Mexican food get     If familiar Chipotle then understand set basically grown cafeteria where pick fillings your burrito tacos build you   There's usually high turn over things stay fresh   Also expect large portions affordable prices   I hadn't Qdoba while couldn't remember why   recent visit back all came back me   The food pretty boring   Not lot flavor rice beans salsas   bad just exciting eat   I think going stick Zaba's   Bonus points coupons frequent diner program clean store friendly employees  <EOR> The Rice undercooked    and really wanted place because great customer service  <EOR> I put right Chipotle terms quality   Prices relatively same  Chips queso amazing  3 tacos chicken steak grilled pork   grilled pork wasn't great but steak chicken tasted fresh juicy even 30 min before closing time  <EOR> Clean fast food restaurant but food horrible tasting looking  containers held food wasn't covered  variety meat beans other toppings looked if hasn't refilled reheated least stirred before reached counters   I ordered three grilled chicken tacos tortillas cold  Only nibble chicken tacos would pretty much veggie taco lol   Staff ok restaurant very cool but definitely experienced better  <EOR> Van full 9 30pm all hungry  stopped doors 9 50 they close 10 00pm doors locked OPEN sign turned off cleaning up  knocked lady signaled closed!
