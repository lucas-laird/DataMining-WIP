Walking into hidden flop around 1 00 am first thing noticed place looked very unkept mundane  scattered few people just sitting staring into oblivion no conversations no dancing no lively entertainment  no fun  most OUTRAGEOUS thing couldn't help block overly obnoxious extremely loud music DJ playing  such small place should never music loud was  concert venue but hookah lounge where supposed relaxing mellow vibe  couldn't even communicate waitress wanted she couldn't well  group started off table few waters continuously struggled idea actually staying round hookah  served Voss water without having choice tap  if didn't want pay 12 dollars pretentious bottle water? didn't even want experience possible disappointment shisha sesh  mood desolate lifeless horrible ear piercing music leave STAT!   Hookah caught trendy aspect nightlife Las Vegas over past decade idea said places trying transcend competitive idea true hookah lounge supposed be  don't know but hookah lounge should consist of  Personally lounges should forever evolving innovative but still remain true incredible Middle Eastern tradition  Luna lost if dead  some major improvements if ever want see business evolving positively    I've past Luna many time because insatiable hunger incredible tacos Tacos El'gordo always wondered eerie structure back empty parking lot??

Come see me! <EOR> The hookah great  only good thing visit  hours state open 2pm during week  party 2 other separate parties showed exactly 2pm told weren't open  When all said website lists opening time 2pm then said open but weren't ready customers because they'd just gotten new tables needed moved  Sidebar noted dirty tables clear weren't new  fact see older reviews pictures those same new tables   lets further know correct original assessment  call b s  excuse  Well issue  sure weren't ready because aren't accustomed having customers afternoon weekday  But work industry know well  never gauge your customers prepared all possible scenarios  means should restaurant ready service 15 minutes before opening time still trying set time open  Failure plan your part does constitute emergency mine  But digress  15 20 minutes finally let sit down  Then wait  wait water  wait someone take order which just hummus trio teapot hookah  wait trio which just duo regular hummus garlic hummus  Sidebar chef  worked Mediterranean restaurant some time  know fact proper hummus cannot made without garlic  gave garlic hummus garlic garlic hummus   giving regular coffee coffee caffeine  would respected them more if they'd said only regular hummus right now  Don't try pull okie doke making menu item since think won't know any better  waited forever hookah   about 45 minutes total  kept asking manager come he never would  4th time he finally came when discovered apathetic nonchalant  unapologetic waiter actually manager meaning nothing going resolved  If waiter doubles manager doesn't care customer then other employees certainly won't   ergo why didn't care rushing let sit down 2pm when restaurant opened  hookah quality but enough warrant going back dealing slow service indifference customer's satisfaction  <EOR> I came San Diego vegas decided check Luna Lounge  Hookah good service great  Good vibes all around mixtures locals tourist <EOR> The hookah really bad change twice still awful   If your serious hookah user you!

Impossible Luna Lounge  Instead comfy couches usually seen types establishments uncomfortable individual chairs  man only 6' tall but legs cramping up  environment certainly doesn't encourage staying awhile trying multiple hookah flavors  DJ played some sort international music maybe draw some but certainly want hear when vibing goal  back recommend place anyone other tourists staying area  <EOR> Small location but nice lounge  Monday around 4 30pm wasn't many people staff but guy nice made Pineapple Krush hookah 2 good drinks  mango mojito which ok wife caramel Cosmo something she loved it  relax chill environment easy redeem Groupon  <EOR> I Vegas friends Bachelorette party  big group  Luna did excellent job taking care us   The service EXCELLENT! manager amazing waitress sweet fast very attentive  The Atmosphere Live DJ dance floor dim lights comfortable chairs couches classy trendy décor  tell every detail thought through    extremely professional clean!
