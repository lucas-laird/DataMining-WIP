Thanks!! <EOR> Their pad thai amazing! Great vibe good food  <EOR> Food average lunch dinner spot  mix Thai Korean dishes  almost always choose Thai food every time eat but then saw seafood bibimbap menu ordered instead  brown rice undercooked stale which kinda made fish all toppings enjoyable when they're all mixed up  something similar better Sakura Sushi inside Greenland market  called haedubap comes w variety fish instead just salmon plus cheaper too  also Thai tea ice cream nom yen pink Thai milk tea really wanted try especially since many other places offer those  complimentary crab rangoon brought delicious though perfectly crispy even real crab meat inside  Service friendly attentive  feel other places around area just better overall  <EOR> The former Hooligan's dive bar stuffed burgers finally replaced new business Thai Seafood Ginger straightforward Thai seafood specialties despite backwards sounding name  Hopefully able overcome hidden location stick around longer predecessors    We brought appetizer sampler house kitchen test new dishes  rangoon squid salad seafood salad pickled veggies all fresh well made  started tom kha soup sub tofu usual protein Drunken Noodle entree also tofu while guy Spicy Garlic Shrimp seafood dish definitely best ordered which line business name  Pricing initially seemed touch high but justified large portions   The soup great broth heartier usual added carrots other veggies  noodle dish decent but modifications add mushroom sub tofu accommodate part time vegan diet met dish egg despite being listed description no requested mushroom ton fried tofu    soggy rather crispy  guy really enjoyed shrimp dish spicy garlic sauce tried robust flavorful  seafood definitely strongest dish   Service friendly interior undergone complete transformation since days dive bar bright modern interior red black theme huge bar area  They're close enough home go to Thai takeout option may revisit lunch perhaps try some Korean dishes  <EOR> I hate say but number times started great  But declined steadily opinion  Yesterday some chicken pad thai sweet couldn't believe it  noodles stuck together wads  no else place yet half eaten food dishes half empty glasses remained adjoining table throughout meal  Perhaps changed chefs    waitress very nice but otherwise don't know gives  Keep clean  Health Dept took down very uplifting C rating right before left but did remain see if there  hope so  Come people why restaurants business fast  Please pay attention fundamentals  <EOR> Since 3 stars simply average cannot bring myself give it    Upon arriving Hubs seated quickly note server would right us  right he was! greeted enthusiasm friendliness just don't find Vegas  Service exceptional sure!   Being half Korean try Korean dishes  Hubs fan dishes offered Korean fare he stuck favorite Yellow Curry chicken  ordered Kalbi even though usually little wary ordering Korean non Korean venue    We brought plate crab Rangoon house  say really best Valley  am usually fan dish but didn't want rude least try ended eating them all good! Hot fresh fryer filling creamy just tad sweet just it filled REAL crab meat  would definitely recommend try if dish!   The main course came shortly Hubs stated meal good but he's better  appeared good mix vegetables balanced well amount chicken  tried taste broth end agree although good better  both prefer curry little more creamy side appeared pretty watery bit a    tang? it  Just little different we're used prefer but definitely bad  Probably wouldn't satisfy craving curry but would decent meal option if just good meal    The Kalbi well good but likely won't order again  many Korean options Vegas just top list  meat tender well marinated but taste little    off    used to  enjoy meat little sweeter less puree covered feel  understand many places marinade recipe calls pureed fruit may feeling but just style  meat also seemed sloppy cut butcher which something really hold against restaurant but when careful hard chew because shaving rib bone might mix little less enjoyable    All all location nearby which very convenient  prices reasonable although taste isn't we're used meal bad any sense  Kind good but mom it  know mean?  Also ordered Thai Iced Tea boast best Las Vegas  good very good but other places just good even little better much cheaper  $4 drink little steep me  free current check offer wasn't bad but knowing $4 likely going elsewhere tea needs when don't brew home   <EOR> We lunch  small selection lunch special which ok  portions big lunch filling  food delicious  husband ordered bi bim bap large good except little shell bottom waitress quick rectify problem apologized it  atmosphere clean nice  waitress staff very nice attentive  would back try other dishes  <EOR> Very friendly service Ordered sole fish drunken noodle fried rice all delicious Highly recommended! <EOR> Went back   Very disappointed trip  ordered shrimp tempura told shrimp   Asked  chu chi scallops   asked specifically if spicy  waiter said not    When arrived shrimp  thought which why changed order   He said could scallops but everyone else almost done said no   shrimp rubbery sauce spicy eat  When told waiter he said sorry  did eat    Money down drain   granddaughters bimimbop good  <EOR> This place delicious! recommend lemon chicken definitely because best ever had!
