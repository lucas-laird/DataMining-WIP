Tonight ordered pizza family delivered process doing million things when answered door accidentally grabbed sons allowance money instead tip money set aside driver ended tipping driver 47 00 very upset kid once realized happened! immediately called Pizza Hut guy answered nice enough contact driver name Luke  Luke immediately returned house return money apologized because he even chance see tipped him  Needless say kiddo very happy am more impressed honesty shown family! thank Pizza Hut employees southern highlands parkway! <EOR> Be sure inspect your delivery sure pay for! Tried but experience bad  <EOR> When come Pizza Hut 11 44 am southern Highlands order food can't disturb cashier phone talking bank personal stuff rude  10 min waiting till he finish business phone ordered  med cheese pizza done 15 min  If he rang pizza First talk phone 10 min would ok but course guys educated loving job can't disturb them  Amen  <EOR> I store pick online order walk into 6 staff members messing around upfront  2 them sitting counter shockingly pizza wasn't even oven yet  walk everyone scatters  While pay order isn't even ready barely hear cashier employees now messing around back  Should probably find manager keep employees line  Worst service ever experienced Pizza Hut! <EOR> My first experiences great  But    I am slowly discovering place inconsistent food quality! Why must always cross fingers good order? always forget dipping sauces! Always  double check your orders  recently ordered wings all looked undercooked  damn scared finish eating them  believe rushing undercooking food  actually shocked see decent amount pizza toppings time  <EOR> Love place people front counter very friendly just remember wensday busy cause 60 cents wings pizza very good order again <EOR> Worst pizza ever had  ordered Hawaiian pizza simple delivery  delivery Time kid nice enough  However pizza very bad  honestly worse frozen pizzas smiths  Crust tasted cheap old  Toppings sparse   Will never return    If place smart would some good management revamp pizzas seeing only 1 3 pizza laces area  <EOR> Ordered pizza online 1 11pm estimated delivery time 2 45pm  Really? Dominos Papa Johns delivers 45min less  Sorry Pizza Hut  you permanently replaced  <EOR> no star!!! ordered $19 99 big box came 35 mins late promised time! food COLD!!! how??? only  5 mile house!!! pizza tasted greasy cardboard box wings cold dry!!! <EOR> They're always pleasant when call  appreciate patience friendly service  its just Pizza Hut but good customer service seems rare days  consistently pleasant every time ordered  edit review  still agree they're pleasant when call  Past few orders messed up  crust forgetting drinks  Darien manager did offer replace meal items messed on  When called back them attitude little different but he stuck word  give that  getting anything free  principle paid items way ordered originally  think ultimately service good if mistake made orders  really proper customer service accommodate act its favor  Fixing paying customers order customer service  appreciated  Don't people fee its hand when they're already paid food  <EOR> Don't ever try order pizza busy night Halloween super bowl     pre ordered pizzas day before 5pm pickup  40 minutes later tell oven     totally unacceptable!!! never order again   together Pizza Hut ! <EOR> One only reasons order Pizza Hut because pretzel crust which happened only thing forgot order   So call them reluctantly tell remake but return pizza already received    So hour half later still haven't received anything waiting whole cold pizza   So call again which tell route no more that   Finally show new pizza  I ask them pizza giving back say they're just going trash it   which seems such waste   I don't think going order again  Even if its right down street  isn't first mistake they've made   resulting negative attitude towards customer    love Pizza Hut lot   but location given issues    <EOR>
