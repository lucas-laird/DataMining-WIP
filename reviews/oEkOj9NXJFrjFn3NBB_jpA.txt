A few more people came eating bridal shower party 10 young women came well   very surprised few people good food least tried    Our bill before discount $55 plus fixed gratuity 18% ended paying $39 55 coupon deducted   I would say try place again probably another coupon   other side world where live convenient visit regularly   But definitely enjoyed it! <EOR> Went Rhythm Kitchen evening  Since traveled California looking meal some great substance flavor! Rhythm Kitchen did disappoint  fried alligator crawfish étouffée great food wonderful atmosphere  <EOR> I'm vegetarian starving Las Vegas living off muffins fries cheese weeks   need   veggies   NOW   !  So today   It's past lunchtime everyone starving decided explore area sit down meal stumbled across Rhythm Kitchen   outside looked New Orleans home wraparound porch ceiling fans etc middle nowhere inside restaurant completely empty   When walked no hostess found picked own menus seated ourselves   When opened menu pick lunch absolutely nothing vegetarian   point am thinking going end disaster   Then Jesse waiter arrived take order asked if he could whip vegetarian meal offering sides broccoli asparagus sauteed mushrooms sauteed spinach bed rice pilaf   He said he'd ask because normal entree offering individual sides would cost over $20   He comes back tells manager agreed sell meal $10 99   Kind pricey but wasn't going complain point   When meal came surprisingly delicious!  DAMN GOOD!  All vegetables seasoned correctly cooked perfections a bit al dente rice equally good   good scarfed down 5 minutes   When Jesse came back check told meal awesome he just looked said Really?    guess Nevadans just don't whole veggie thing   In end lunch companions all expected disaster but all equally impressed surprised such find Rhythm Kitchen   Great food great service   I'll definitely back lunch again maybe even dinner   They open until 10pm weekdays   P S  Yay review #200!!! <EOR> Went Rhythm Kitchen tonight groupon   Jeff server top notch didn't even wait ice tea refills he xray vision continuously topped drinks off    Mr Seafeast Platter catfish oysters shrimp   good red beans rice andouille sausage of course am going taste his Crescent Pasta lots bay scallops shrimp large 4 plenty crawfish also included mushrooms spinach   very good and leftovers tomorrow   For desert Hot Fudge Brownie  a nice treat   bread hush puppies    mmmm   definitely back    There absolutely nothing complain place   thanks wonderful evening  <EOR> First let say really wanted place  love building decor very nice  being said food needs some help  friend Groupon $40 worth food let use Groupon liquor well nice touch   We ordered crab cake appetizer  First crab cakes crab balls  believe put deep fryer pan fried  basically crab ball things could buy any warehouse club dunked deep fryer  also very salty  Presentation good dipping sauce good well   I bowl gumbo entree  ok again quite salty some shells assume some shellfish gumbo shrimp shell?

New Orleans style cuisine sampled town over years closest found real deal!  Crawfish Etouffe delicious spinach artichoke dip crawfish really tasty also fantastic prime rib   Additionally sampled friend's shrimp pasta several fried appetizers appetizers nothing special but shrimp dish great flavor!    Aside food though Rhythm Kitchen offers many different wines specialty mixed drinks including some classics Sazerac   classy atmosphere feels fine dining but prices quite reasonable especially during happy hour   great place take loved ones special occasions   The first time dined wait staff very sparse took very long time drinks eventually food   But each time back service improved food always good enough keep coming back regardless  <EOR> I've passed building many times every time see curious say myself want try place day! when saw Living Social coupons $20 $40 worth food mom each bought one!

Here's scoop BF ordered Jambalaya Spicy but lacked authentic Cajun seasoning flavor  also bit soupy  bad but much better    Shrimp Catfish Po Boy Large pieces shrimp cornmeal battered fish  Just ok  Again seemed lacking something  bit bland taste    Red Beans Rice Disgusting  Truthfully Popeyes Chicken across street tastes much better    Cajun Rice sure why opted switch andouille sausage spicy sausage as indicated waiter but didn't care side dish  red beans rice Cajun rice zero flavor    Sweet Tea really excited see offered southern delicacy  However very disappointed  serve sweet tea when tea sweet???   On upside serve delicious hush puppies honey butter keep them coming  Just sure finish before 3 00 PM because hover over attempt rush close shop early  Bad customer service especially new establishment  Overall however would recommend place  better places both off strip  <EOR> I highly recommend restaurant  food very good try Larry's mint julip   mmm good  When ask seated James he very attentive friendly trust he take good care you  <EOR> First summarily chastised phoning ahead reservation when only party seated table entire restaurant    Nice ambiance fair service far overrated food  very sick eating there     Skip place  <EOR> everything way over spiced many things come only fried  item ordered choose another since nothing else wanted just something new friend would eat charged sharing fee 2 50 without telling me just hid bill can't stand that  think giving them another chance nothing good Sorry pass <EOR> Tuesdays all eat crab legs $38!
