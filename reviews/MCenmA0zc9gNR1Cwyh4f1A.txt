EDR 5 days week really appreciate efforts being made regards delivering best quality possible CP employees  However fact best selections only being served around peak times 11am 12 30pm only weekdays bit unfair thing  People working swing graveyard shifts feel they're eating leftovers  Breakfast options should change bit same redundant things since joined company year ago  Weekends' selections should important weekdays only rely fact if executive offices employees aren't then shouldn't serve good options  I'd also add majority people aren't fans chicken recipe  being served 3 4 days week  white fish tastes nothing some people eat pork  Thank much taking your time order read review   Edit Now understand process little bit better must admit review bit unfair towards your team's efforts  apologies that  <EOR> The food dramatically gotten healthy very good! now many more selections better choices desserts yes desserts juice!
