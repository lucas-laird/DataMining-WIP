USED FUN! The service totally wack if want food bar MUST order server floor if want drinks floor food practically impossible hate when ask or  Two people working bar where 100+ people crowded around BECAUSE 're did' open floor into dance floor which now means no more Flip Cup Beer Pong inside darn cold outside nothing going course  Obviously whole vibe off waited 20+ mins order drinks before finally deciding just own house where drinks wayyy cheaper listen WAY BETTER music seriously playing YMCA computer sitting your phone?! hope paying much play beer pong wait forever crappy service truly bartenders servers seem unhappy when gets busy don't want money?  This coming kick baller used games teams blast but things changed Bentley's better  If WAKA wouldn't happy since advertise crap Bentley's everyone am sure WAKA's people bring ton weekly earnings now really fun any more   I am confused dance floor put all money into but what? Seems people aren't really going Bentley's anymore because changes   I guess should give place chance weekend some time see if people actually dance  doesn't sense but whatevs   Good luck Bentley's  <EOR> This just review Bentley's during Nebraska football game  Granted sure large sports bar something offer pretty much any sports fan because TVs both large very large ALL over place  food pretty much your standard bar food wings pizza burgers etc   But come Saturday when college football full swing place literally becomes microcosm Lincoln Nebraska  Tables assembled end end maximize capacity don't forget wear your Big Red shirts! if want buy merch table which wide selection Las Vegas Nebraskan shirts hats  cheering  yelling  chanting singing   heck even cardboard Bo Pelini kitty! I'd estimate between 200 300 Husker fans here  Whether you're Las Vegan tourist all really fan Big Red! highly recommend trying out  <EOR> Been twice now glad Valentine's Day   always warmly welcomed very friendly service  just feel love motherly welcoming love   Outstanding service stays consistent    drinks great food great! love place!! <EOR> I told come pizza  think next time pass  ladies working very nice responded soon entered  However ordering large pepperoni pizza 18 pepperoni $20 seems kind high priced me  Overall better pizza elsewhere toppings actually taste better  <EOR> oops   recently returned so    charged ranch dressing without being told top off   the ranch watered down    not joking   watered down   who F ing waters down ranch dressing then charges it   in mind symptomatic other hidden issues   I wont back <EOR> Bentleys great neighborhood bar very wide variety menu menu everything pastrami sandwiches multiple salads everything between   far eaten several items menu every item well cooked taste great well balanced enjoyed  them!
