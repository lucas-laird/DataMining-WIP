Just sister tastiest vegetarian sandwich ever gotten Subway  Kamal made sandwich perfect  Giving everything friendly just great experience  try only when he's now  <EOR> Disappointed amount food sub   ordered turkey sub few slices meat  Then when asked worker extra onions she gave smallest pinch onions    when asked more but next time she gave dirty look put 2 more onion slivers sub  Before other locations would whole handful  didn't understand why she being stingy onions  asked extra onions but ended getting hardly any  <EOR> One worst Subways ever to  Note everyone considering franchise if can't afford run business correctly DON'T IT!   Although three annoying things  happened Subway wasn't going public complaint until opened sandwich home   1  last bit tuna tub asked if fresh one  guy says today  now 4 30 pm  But he did replace    2  asked swiss cheese  don't today  3  asked cup water  don't water  machine broken  bought sandwich  When home took sandwich bag felt wrong  See photo  Yep supposed 6 inch sandwich just 5 inches! <EOR> I enjoy coming great fresh food  service fast come location when your lunch time  subs healthy which huge plus especially if want stay healthy  <EOR> Generally good place eat until hired Jhoana  She served moldy bread did find until ate most sandwich  When confronted all she say sorry made no effort reconcile  Beware eating restaurant when she there  Jhoana brain dead come  <EOR> Came 830pm 1 1 17 meatball sub  said didn't any he showed cleaned station  close 10pm  Lazy employees trying cut corners  <EOR> Friendly staff good food but no public restrooms  city already problem feces being all over place can't even provide place paying customer wash hands  Shame them! Okay update review because when walk subway literally saw s*** stains sidewalk side facing Flamingo Road  go! <EOR> They haven't able toast your bread over two weeks  bad business 3 times trying sandwich every time same story  No urgency fix problem them think want cold sandwich  suppose hot? <EOR> I admit Subway does fulfill sandwich craving rare occasions  toast bread unlike some other big sandwich shops  cookies pretty good  $6 combo good option cheap lunch    But subtract star miserable everyone works seems  any people smile?  My cheap Subway lunches reliably good service while friendliest quick  place matter minutes even around weekday lunch rush  <EOR> Great first impression! Blanca took time patience smile answer all catering questions  Great sincere service! <EOR>
