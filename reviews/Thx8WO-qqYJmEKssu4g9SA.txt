She slow rude delay your orders all you can eat then time sure eat less  watched customer order iced tea once she brought lady hot tea  simple drink order she should just swapped her  She argued lady made such big deal saying she right wonder she manages keep job she's several years way  When taking to go order same old waitress gave hard time when asked two additional packs soy sauce believe not  She reason am regular anymore! Therefore avoid possibility aggravation yourself favor ask younger servers nice! Chef works left side bar small serious Asian man talkative welcoming  He may come across rude  sushi he okay but sloppy  owner other hand more pleasant works right side bar  He's talkative but definitely quiet other man he smiles often  eaten several times back because close home food lot flavor  HOWEVER here's something may scary some picky eaters found hairs sushi    couple times pretty much kept going back several months  did notify young waitresses hair incident heard owner irate but never offered anything hairy food free soup discount nothing! don't know treat customer  Am going back? Probably! food  But if old lady only server walk save myself indigestion! <EOR> Pricey very limited menu which gives lot rice sushi rolls   Went AYCE   service pretty good fast   server automatically split bill group earned them extra star   sushi nice big but amount rice underneath it       The AYCE menu very limited $22 95 lunch   no sea urchin uni said only available dinner but wasn't even menu   Mochi ice cream desert included either   Desert plum ice cream mochi ice cream red bean ice cream orange slices   mean really?  even 1 piece limit mochi ice cream?

If place slow enough whatever kind roll want provided ingredients which pretty cool   limit certain menu items such sake shooter fried oysters   Sundays Mondays include free drink meal including alcohol if inclined   Service usually friendly quick chefs very attentive when seated sushi bar  <EOR> Sushi Rainbow located next Greenland Market  sign boldly states Since adhere strict Japanese standards food costs higher other establishments which follow lesser standards which sounds promising  Unfortunately place underwhelming many aspects   How any service Sushi Rainbow 1  Walk find your own seat 2  If lucky enough swing ask drink  Tell them your drink order immediately rudely slap menu table 3  Order won't taken unless wave your hands   Hands air reach stars imagine yourself being butterfly trying reach heaven  attention eventually   FOOD As said earlier sign posted all over establishment very deceiving  ordered Sushi 4 Sushi Combo 2  Fish never taste fresh fact based +20 visits  AYCE $22 95 lunch 45min limit $26 95 dinner 60min limit   Way overpriced low quality items    On visit decided order Katsudon which turned total fail  First took over 30mins table  Perfect!

I only gave place 4 stars because beer sake   Honestly sake tasted isopropyl alcohol although am sake connoisseur only 2 beer choices and domestic beer!    But seriously $25 more ask for?  All all think place least worth try   All locals love besides lose all your money Vegas why spend your last $25 meal you'll feel good about? <EOR> Hubby lived Las Vegas more 15 years only  2 miles Sushi Rainbow surprised never knew existence until couple years ago   tucked small strip mall next Greenland supermarket   Now favorite Japanese restaurant bring everyone here! never tried AYCE but  never disappointed favorite Salmon Special piece teriyaki grilled salmon California roll tempura edamame salad  Served Miso soup rice  <EOR> Amazing sushi   biggest rarity vegas actually Japanese sushi bar!

Why former current Japanese nationals prefer eat older sushi bar doesn't fancy exciting dcor? answer SUSHI RAINBOW MANY people Japanese descent actually symbol pride community  owner very respected man Japanese Americans   When little kid Southern California first heard Shogo san famous sushi restaurant Newport Beach  Sushi just did exist area  Everytime sushi restaurant poped would quickly business  Remember sushi idea eating raw fish accepted American mainstream back then  sushi bar Shogo worked only sushi bar area made it  Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just eat there  Shogo San 1st generation sushi chefs along famous Ichiro Mashita came America Japan dream day popularize sushi America  endure much hardships during those days but most Japanese Asian Americans during era fought hard find success land opportunity  Today Sushi bar every street due labor  when found Shogo purchased SUSHI RAINBOW original owner ecstatic! great legend California Sushi now Las Vegas! dream come true    Shogo san over 40 years Sushi experience  During youth Kyushu he very respected edo style sushi chef  through years apprenticeship before he even opportunity touch actual fish  Today years experience really shows  Though majority day revolves around making California Rolls westerners also secret menu those appreciate real sushi  love every week something different  Edo Chirashizushi Shinko Engawa Uni Ika mix Maguro no Zuke Yamaimo many other traditional Japanese dishes aren't any other J restaurant town  Every time eat feel even more proud Japanese blood veins    Unlike most sushi bars LV SUSHI RAINBOW get's all items true Japanese Japanese American distributors  fish real Japanese seafood distributor not Korean distributor get's fish cold waters such Canada Alaska  Fish colder waters meat more fatty marbling enjoy much  Even Japanese ice creams plum wine green tea come famous Japanese ice cream company Torrance     If true sushi lover 1st thing notice Shogo's nigiri technique unrealistically perfect compared other Sushi joints town  Remember he over 40 years experience  see immediately even chefs Kabuto don't precision  funniest thing Shogo very humble + modest doesn't even brag great he is   There used guy named Hiro san worked also former edomaezushi chef Japan   Holy crap guy best chef ever seen  But he retired few months ago  totally depressed hell me    Kyuu chan new apprentice sushi chef  He Chinese descent but he lot Japanese chefs look amateurs due amazing talent  Shogo such hardcore Japanese man he made Kyuu learn speak Japanese chef here  He also made Latino cooks back learn Japanese couldn't work  coolest thing ever! much old school Japanese discipline kitchen  But Shogo himself such friendly positive guy  talk hours  coolest thing he knows everything Japanese history pop culture! most fascinating conversations him   I love coming SUSHI RAINBOW showing respect great Japanese heroes  Also every time come scene Goodfellas when Robert DeNiro walks into club everyone knows name whatever he wants even spot saved him  NEVER order all say Omakase take care everything me    I've written 100s Yelp reviews but SUSHI RAINBOW absolute favorite restaurant just Las Vegas but whole world  <EOR> This place came recommendation friend knows Vegas fairly well  Thanks Joy!
