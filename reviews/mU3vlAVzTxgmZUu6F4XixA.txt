Probably but respectable ramen sure  Broth rich flavor  Wasn't overly salt noodles cooked perfectly opinion  seen others comment saltiness noodles being over cooked    Overall glad tried it  Would definitely recommend if you're into ramen  If backyard probably wouldn't habit ordering $18 ramen because fanatics ramen half price but dinner companies dime anyways <EOR> Having seen David Chang Netflix wife very excited try Momofuku  appreciate chefs pushing boundaries new bold flavors eclectic takes considered traditional dishes  Whilst David tried expand flavors black truffle foie grass Sichuan peppers tingle your taste buds food leaves feeling gimmicked especially price    The foie gras shaving tuna barely adds fattiness gaminess foie gras  dish would tasted better tuna served slice foie gras    The crispy rice cakes Sichuan peppers could used less salt    The saving grace $50 truffle ramen broth black truffle  noodles chewy similar udon alkaline enough ramen    Overall very disappointed  Modernist cuisine fails when traditional version dish tastes better altered one  <EOR> Ashkhen most wonderful AMAZING person graciously invited into restaurant  because experience Momofuku elevated next level  'day before wedding' dinner she made extra special  because last night last dinner before fiancé became husband wife   She sat large party down private dining room nice table set overlooking strip  definitely beautiful amazing see Vegas lights while eating dinner  won't talk food because food course simply amazing should just read other reviews   solely experience    After dinner she kept reassuring if anything needed even beyond restaurant even future visits she would gladly help out  sealed deal us  Extending service graciousness future repeat visits definitely humble gesture appreciated  definitely back!

ALSO big ass restaurant literally 1 woman 1 male stall   restroom right outside restaurant if can't hold <EOR> Everything way SALTY  only good things tried pork buns big eye tuna katsu  But pork ramen kimchee stew bo ssam super overwhelming salty  ten glasses water  dishes definitely catered western palette but if Asian specifically Korean highly disappointed dishes!! $25 kimchee jjigae such ripoff wasn't even good kimchee  Also bo ssam made traditional Korean way  told wrap oyster combo tasted terrible  Also meat thick pork belly slices expecting instead braised marinated pork _ am really disappointed won't coming back  <EOR> I visited much more casual little brother NYC's Momofuku KO recently  Service laid back efficient  Dark woods metallic accents large graffiti piece anchor large interior's modern look    The la carte menu lists small plates raw bar buns salads meat seafood rice noodles sides desserts  drank sake but friend ordered Jade Dragon pisco jalapeño melon which loved kept stealing  Just know caliente   and referring temperature drink    What tried Shishito Peppers Spicy Cucumbers Pork Belly Bun Shiitake Buns Chicken Karaage Kimchi Rice Bowl Chilled Spicy Noodles  Except perhaps Shiitake Bun loved everything else  highlight being Kimchi Rice Bowl  Know everything comes ready really charge coursing your meal  Didn't try dessert time chose share Crack Pie MILK next door instead  would way visit dinner as would NYC's KO but would 100% return lunch again  Solid  <EOR> Fun fact David Chang chef crushes  He's always smiling laughing camera he absolutely loves he does he's pretentious it    I first heard Momofuku No Reservations Anthony Bordain another chef crush made mental note visit locations some day  first opportunity last summer during Vegas trip   First foremost know something spectacular if housed Cosmopolitan  Momofuku's location hot spot atypical visitors when you're looking gorgeous view strip pictured sneak some peaks quirky people around you  Don't those loud cowboys lookin' big juicy burger letting everyone around them know? probably won't find any those here   We reservation sure typical wait time is  restaurant packed though    After being seated eyes shot drink menu  Almost immediately land spiced slush drink  When Vegas gotta try something different! tasted spicy frozen margarita those those   We started off crab stuffed deviled eggs because why heck wouldn't try David Chang's seafood deviled eggs? Those three favorite things! definitely strangest deviled eggs ever also pretty darn tasty    We also ordered ahi tuna tomatoes cheese because night fusion food! also always craving poke bound ordered  sure if actually listed fusion poke but pretending also strangest form dish ever had  would never thought pair raw fish tomatoes cheese but oddly delicious  Sometimes wonder if David Chang thinks dishes while he's really high   maybe  most chefs though?  We ended smoked pork chops  Though well cooked seasoned item easily forgettable compared other items ordered  I'd say order only if want something safe   Would visit Momofuku again? Hell yes should too  <EOR> Had high expectations going into first ever Momofuku dining experience say only ok  menu rather limited only entree appealed pork ramen  Everything else really expensive appetizer sized  three pork ramens three pork belly buns    Sounded good idea time but ended being much pork belly didn't think such thing possible! pork belly bun definitely highlight generous slab pork belly sandwiched between Chinese bao along some picked cucumbers some kind sauce  Unfortunately full ramen ended having take buns made perfect midnight snack!

But its hard New York  when heard going Vegas knew nothing could stop me  only lunch ramen Kimchi side    when hear chefs talk taste every flavor and or ingredient dish    Its really true  don't adept palete even cook well  But could definitely taste multiple distinct flavors ramen kimchi  amazing  <EOR> I'm big fan food shows always hoped try David Chang's Momofuku day  would expected excited finally visit most recent visit Las Vegas  Now tried felt more like   ok   been done    and like    yea! gotta again  experience felt definitely under expectations  especially when looking food vs price perspective   I felt pretty much almost every dish overpriced  definitely regretted ordering soft boiled eggs salmon roes $9    which essentially literally 2 eggs salmon roes light sprinkle rice crispy leaf two sprouts it  Taste wise  not wasn't anything memorable  buns chicken karaage pork belly tried though quite good  they really small though   and while pork belly buns highlights   charging $6 $7 each little ridiculous   I guess result being Las Vegas signature dish brand name chef  also tried pork belly ramen  and while David Chang's interpretation ramen made mushroom based broth? which differed traditional ramen taste ok  just wasn't anything memorable   esp given just ok portion price point $18   Overall think glad tried it   but probably again next time unless someone else group wanted try it  Given high price point just ok  not much memorable taste  and fact Las Vegas offers many great dining options   I would probably choose elsewhere next time instead  <EOR> Crazy good drinks!!!!!

First because told great food friend lunch  decided dinner WHOA!

We party 6 4 grown men 2 girls  ordered 3 main course steamed brazino fish rotisserie chicken fried bone braised Korean short ribs few buns some 1 2 shell oysters some chinese broccli green  server suggested least order 4 definitely over kill  portion listed serve 2 but each entree definitely serve 4   huge!!   1 2 shell oysters melon ice taste 5 stars price value 3 stars  Over all 4 stars  very fresh love touch melon ice citrus taste  brings sweetness oyster but over powering  enjoy very much except very small  price $26 which breaks down $4 5 pieces very pricey    The pork bun okay 3 stars   If compare Taiwanese style pork buns momofuku buns juicey lack garnishing  If compare vietnames Chinese style pork buns bao hoag lack crispness pork belly flavors too  bad but nothing special them   The main dishes My favourite Korean braised short ribs  tender loaded flavors  didn't think spicy glance but put chilli pepper which live Korean dish without all being red  Loved lined claypot rice cake lotus root potatoes  soaked all flavors meat claypot kept warm whole time before finished pot  Honestly could just ordered dish greens would plenty enough us  meat cubes short ribs huge   But braised all through soft moist  Love it  5 stars The whole steam branzino fish pretty good  But seems only enjoys it  half fish finished end meal  Although says steamed really very steamed  more drier side seems more baked  Which dont mind  lemon taste because am afraid fishy ocean taste  actually fairly well down considering cooking such big fish let meat soggy maintain fish taste good dressing  Except quite steamed which friend wished was  Overall 4 stars   The rotisserie chicken think epic fail  big pieces very very dried  fried bones super salty  Nothing eat full piece ourselves  ended sending back kitchen  whole chicken almost untouched   In exchange asked try ginger scallion noodle  cold noodle shiitake mushroom  another average dish flavors good but bit oily side  Each could only small bite without feeling greasy    Last but least Chinese broccoli very good  typical Chinese style fried broccoli overcook crunchy over salty either    Overall feel people gave good reviews lunch instead dinner  Ambience very nice but portions very large expensive  much rather smaller portion shaved off price bit instead  lazy Susan most table intended family style sharing plates  I'd sample more dishes over power portions give and actually wanted more new American food then being mostly Asian style allover then place  <EOR> This place beyond five stars! won't recommend vegetarians though since options very limited! located inside cosmopolitan    restaurant usually comes wait times! But wait worth it   if super hungry then share noodle bowl two starters!! <EOR> Food amazing  Definitely hype  sparkling water delicious only things made seem sparkling water house  would nice if told $1 each addition charged extra cups didnt order  ordered Duck Ssam quite deceived amount served us  Felt being served well over priced but its Las Vegas expected <EOR> Exterior = 4 5 This Japanese restaurant located second floor Cosmopolitan  walked towards restaurant noticed line outside  breathed sigh relief walked straight hostess stand claim reservation spot  outside wasn't much place wait aside standing near bordering wall since left restaurant opening Milk    Interior = 5 5 Upon entering restaurant passed through individuals munching away bar before entering actual restaurant space  liked lighting restaurant which I felt attributed large panel windows which lucky enough seated by  think would relaxing rainy day we just cloudy but okay that    Service = 5 5 Our server bubbly she recommended some options menu decided order  She also would check bunch times    Order = 4 5 Yuzu lemonade 5 5 We biased because anything yuzu citrus y  Boyfriend liked because wasn't sweet tart watered down  nice balance alcoholic drink got   Dancing Daisy 4 5 I little nervous when read artichoke chocolate whoa there  server described earthy tasting drink popular that  When came stared drink topped pepper  also trying see if could see artichoke don't know why   drink smelled refreshing when drank subtle aftertaste chocolate   Big Eye Tuna 5 5 First time foie gras! liked appetizer wished gave more but see foie gras rich higher amounts  foie gras would literally melt eating would use tuna scoop up  asian pears brought crunch plate since everything else soft    Wagyu bao 3 5 It good meat soft  flavors nice  only came bao which price hoping two  Overall okay   Black Truffle Ramen 3 5 The size nice if person  shared but worked because other items  good but felt over hyped  taste truffle  liked broth because light but feel meat could softer more quantity    Overall = 4 5 It nice atmosphere place eat  enjoyed appetizers little more ramen but may just mean come back try another!  Hint = reservations ahead time avoid line! Also if truffle ramen available server said very limited availability through year the last time offered January 2017   <EOR> The ramen awesome! three days all could keep going back wanted try other restaurants!

Highlights were 1  Wagyua Tri Tip perfectly cooked seasoned  No complaints though didn't eat wrap!  2  Chilled spicy noodles perfect blend flavors just enough kick back more  demolished plate  3  Cauliflower Brussel Sprout great side dish full flavor  little salty when eating towards bottom bc sauce  4  Pork belly bun just good piece pork belly bun soft delicious  Definitely recommend   Lowlights 1  duck most excited dish  duck pretty much anywhere offers it  duck itself tougher usual even considering duck usually tough skin wasn't nearly crispy I'd like  portion ok but nearly $50 worth cost  left half plate because left bad taste mouths  put shredded duck same dish Ok but obviously you're paying premium for    Honestly overall experience pretty good I'd recommend restaurant generally just wasn't pleased duck which most excited about   Stay Cheerful <EOR> I found myself Momofuku yet again disappointed  service food still steller! ordered chicken caviar unforgettable experience  felt dining royalty mountains delicious food eat from  Though slightly expensive side would definitely recommend it  Really if 6 people split expensive  Also expect restaurant two hours if order chicken caviar  worth it! The service exceptionally great time  more then server recommend eat chicken caviar which super helpful because did know where start  also brought toddler son time staff nice made sure plenty keep entertained  point son getting fussy servers brought lid play with  appreciated it! Though probably bring son again nice know more welcome bring him  <EOR> I've Momofuku NYC excited visit LV location family celebrate mom's birthday today  Unfortunately due front house service really left bad taste mouths back    The food general fair amazing  dinner Hakkasan last night food service outstanding! Momofuku's food service does even compare  Hakkasan whole other level!

Service 5 5! waiter funny welcoming! He also very informative explained whole menu  <EOR> We wanted something light before show sheshito peppers Tuna app salty pepper tempura Lobster Shrimp  A little pricey but really good Service great gave all recommendations  <EOR> 4 5!  We lunch day flying out  am currently moment sharing abdominal cavity little human being stomach full capacity  If could would've tried many more things!  Of course pork ramen broth sweeter side which isn't ideal but all other components delicious  husband ordered cold noodles looked really good  If could handled spicy would've tasted it   We asked waitress recommendations because debating between some baos  cod bao first but honestly glorified fillet o fish  saying horrible but wasn't anything special hence  5 pork belly bao though   I mean bad pork belly bao?? good  wish two those instead    They serve dessert but only things next door Milk    P S  bathrooms only single person but fancy Japanese bidets  <EOR> I couldn't wait try but disappointed there  Momofuku overrated  restaurant decor lovely  Very well decorated ambience nice However ramen tasted most other ramen shops  Nothing special noodle broth made stand out  <EOR> I'm local also lived NYC NY location many times loved it  Vegas few times though first time spectacular each time left disappointed  menu completely changed missing things restricting certain items certain times  incredibly frustrating prices  There's very little consistency  Even items menu every time tried changed dramatically  example ahi tuna shaved foie gras  first time tried right around opening treated amazing big sashimi slices ahi THICK shaved pieces foie gras completely covering plate  last time tried ahi tiny cubes la poke mixed tomatoes peppers foie gras grated only served quarter plate  Still good but nearly decadent same price  No consistency  The chicken buns gone missing menu even though still fried chicken all components them  But apparently chicken sand which they'll only sell 11pm after? The winter truffle ramen gone missing though suspect seasonal specialty hope case returns The chicken noodle ramen gone well   Ramen chefs signature NYC reason people go now off menu only available bar late night request dinner which find incredibly odd if serve no problem serving why put menu instead making seem nuisance if ordered you're hiding diners   But other items such branzino pork burns etc  never left menu consistently same    The lack consistency frustrating change items ingredients well  Especially since few substitutions take away I e no more chicken noodle ramen no meat based options ramen other pork  I love momofuku would gladly wait line NYC keep going Vegas hoping impressed when first opened but just keeps frustrating disappointing me  local general town customer comes once doesn't know better but am customer would come consistently become 'regular' if knew getting  hard fans if keep offering inconsistency  I always know getting MILK Momofuku NYC  don't change ingredients meals ordered before take away simple classics  Mix hassle locals having pay parking restaurant much less appealing choice  <EOR> Had spicy cucumbers start incredibly delicious!! Also ordered chickpea miso ramen chicken probably best ramen ever had  Delicious full flavor filling! <EOR> This place refused service because baby stroller  Definitely place little kids babies  Just Another overprice asian food place trendy hipsters willing pay  When showed asked if made reservations told them no told Supposedly didnt any seats available but didn't even offer any available time  Wasted time walking place family 20 minutes LV strip only refused  dont understand why didnt mention needed reserve seat when called address location  Very frustrating  Little Advice host person tell customers phone ahead time before show need reservations  Very bad business poor service  <EOR> Very accommodating when wasn't able eat directly off menu  town competition waitress never skipped beat  Just ordered accordingly  Jealous friends could eat amazing food!

Momofuku NYC couple years ago FELL LOVEEEE pork belly bun  probably best life so far !!    I visited Las Vegas location twice now pork buns both times  first time pork belly melted mouth soft tender reminding experience NYC  second time pork tender but still good great flavor  server recommended Chicken bun saying top seller tried those too  feel chicken bit much batter but good Asian flavor think hint ginger   Overall     Pork Bun Over Chicken everything else I probably always stop anytime Vegas pork bun 2  <EOR> As someone past original NYC Momofuku because closed finally wanted try it  Loved service loved pork belly bun but found pork ramen totally meh  better ramen Portland  much hyped crack pie just tough to chew blondie bar  Lots hype lot  <EOR> Located second level next AllSaints clothing store    We able seat bar  Aside not so cheerful no smiles server attended food fantastic  She answered questions food didn't take long come out   The pork belly ramen amazing also shrimp bun  shrimp bun essentially shrimp patty inside soft taco shell bun sauce lettuce  Both tasty only wish time order more menu   The place definitely good groups  loud but type food quality presentation fan would back again again  <EOR> Momofuku located inside Cosmo right next Milk Bar which reviewing well! First all interior decor point definitely most beautiful ramen restaurant ever to  said sometimes find more beautiful restaurant excluding fine dining less tasty food  no exception   The pork ramen no means bad but wheorth hefty price tag  noodles decent broth wasn't very flavorful egg mediocre  best part dish pork itself which tender delicious  saved dish    Service great food much  Probably wouldn't come back here  <EOR> I finally chance try Momofuku Vegas! large group made reservation OpenTable ahead time  Once arrived lead private room party  beautiful room which made dinner excellent dining experience  staff also friendly displayed great customer service  explained menu options even create menu whatever price point pick  decided order individually but  nice option wouldn't mind trying next time!  Food include Pork Belly Bun hoisin scallion cucumber excellent appetizer before meal  delicious each bite wanting more! If you're deciding between shrimp bun pick pork belly bun   Shrimp Bun spicy mayo pickled red onion iceberg another bun tasting delicious pork belly bun decided give try well  also good but pork belly bun definitely better two   Chilled Spicy Noodles sichuan sausage candied cashew thai basil Noodles sausage nuts  spice level isn't high very bearable people can't handle much spicy  Overall noodles great!  Overall experience Momofuku great  especially liked noodles perfect quality plenty flavors  staff mentioned menu changes routinely open minded menu when coming here  However staff also understanding speaking chef able order some items menu such pork ramen  Dinner time Momofuku definitely more fancy side come lunch if want more casual food experience  <EOR> Ehh experience non less  Tried cookies outside whatever  wished baked house but seems shipped all way New York  restaurant itself nice  Very lively  But hey Vegas place lively here  pork belly boa probably only thing good tried  Wish wasn't much but really good  Disappointed Pork Ramen  flavoring wasn't liking  tasted little oily liking thick broth but hey can't win them all  But if anything least order pork belly boa  <EOR> Smoked salt could more evenly distributed Shishito pepper  The color chicken karaage could more golden brown but taste texture point  Scallion noodle ok  Would try ramen pork belly bun yellowtail sashimi next time  <EOR> Watching many vids documentaries David Chang's restaurants pretty excited check Momofuku Cosmo   but unfortunately would say try one time type place me   While food A OK wasn't mind blowing those menu prices expectations wow factors items  We very large party 19 reserved long table able seat all comfortably super comfy seats   interior Momofuku quite large clean simple decor   Service good food came fairly quickly considering group size   Only thing would recommend fix waiters announce guests default water given them some filtered tap water  supposed cleanse pallet better or some mumbo jumbo automatically charge $1 guest it   Regular tap free assumed would getting but nope   big price all but fan surprise charges even though fine print menu didn't see    The food ordered Pork Shoyu Ramen Ginger Scallion Noods Shiitake Bun Pork Belly Bun   Pork Belly ramen bun pretty good egg ramen cooked well   but aside ramen tasted quite regular broth wasn't super flavorful   Ginger Scallion Noods pretty good all ingredients mixed nicely   ramen buns bit pricier thought worth   Ginger beer also $6!  The table also ordered some shared dishes Five Spice Duck Pork Shoulder   didn't try but said while duck good wasn't anything better Sam Woo but super premium cost   Pork Shoulder good said would feed 3 4 people   nope feeds much much more   I'd guess 6+ esp if you're ordering other stuff   Additionally since some birthdays did offer some tasty cake balls birthday candle them nice gesture   I love watching shows David Chang's restaurants but just okay us   would recommend give try some unique items won't really find across Vegas strip   also famous Milk dessert bar right outside restaurant if want some Crack Pie Compost Cookies! <EOR> David Chang continues hit park  He chosen knowledgeable staff expertly guide through diverse menu  Needless say food exceptional  must if you're strip Vegas  <EOR> I now ate twice  first time came ate bar limited menu loved much come back full menu   I very impressed servers knowledge explanation menu everything each dish  food came perfect timing delicious  even visit managers   Overall great experience can't wait eat again  <EOR> Hi David Chang!

While Momofuku Resturant great late night bite filled cravings fell little short expectations  Maybe limited late night menu? wanted try Ramen okay  Good enough regular Ramen but blown water Ramen  boyfriend Chicken Katsu rice bowl he liked it  felt ginger taste gravy little strong  veggies though! meatball bahnwhich spicy put sauce side  I'm really sensitive when comes spicy food   favorite dish Shrimp Bao!

The dish didn't taste chilled     more warm room temperature fine  Even though removed all peppers dish delicious hella spicy though excessively painfully so  Very delicious though forewarned when say Spicy ain't kiddin' ! I'd read Confetti Cake good ordered realized sister's birthday next day asked server Chris if he'd put candle cake he brought along candle dessert plates forks! all happy Chris' attentiveness efficiency!  Others group ordered Pork Ramen which famous which half customers seemed order while Bo Saam Rice Bowl Pork Belly Bun Shrimp Bun  Everyone loved food! <EOR> Maybe expectations high    service restaurant much all restaurants Vegas superb  plethora dishes all them shiitake bun New York strip beet salad best  Outstanding dishes  Sent back eggplant crispy potatoes par potato side course  Now most controversial comments shishito peppers good but Gjelina's better  lacked char acid peppers really need warrant own spot menu  <EOR> I'll run things down dish dish  Pork bun Great!

If pick thing menu would definitely start buns  Shoyu Pork Ramen $17  ramen pork belly pork shoulder poached egg  good but honestly impressed should be  wished would Japanese marinated soft boiled egg instead  Brussels Sprouts Cauliflower $10  veggies cooked fish sauce vinaigrette chilles  really enjoyed dish but warned fish sauce saltier would expect! Crispy Sole Katsu $29  think ordered much food point   anyways case did catch name dish fish katsu pork! really liked batter outside sole katsu  extra oily KFC but rather light tempura    but tempura  comes scallion rice lettuce wraps kimchi sriracha aioli kind sauce  <EOR> Hmm  wish location lived Momofuku name OG NYC one  main reason late dinner because staying Cosmo  Late night ramen? totally in    We ordered pork belly buns oysters Momofuku share also pork ramen   Pork belly buns arguably best thing menu  inhaled buns    buttery melt your mouth pork belly along sliced cucumber hoison sauce soft warm bun  only reason why would return Momofuku    Oysters Momofuku Grilled oysters kimchi spinach bacon top  Meh  I'd pass next time   Pork ramen broth pretty lackluster  wasn't robust definitely least favorite thing night  mediocore bowl ramen bean sprouts slices fish cake poached egg slab pork belly some shredded pork  Wouldn't order again    I think Momofuku's biggest appeal great location  They're trendy Cosmo next Milk Bar  Would eat again?

The whole steamed branzino cooked perfection! meat melted mouth but flavor fish just alright  Seemed drowned some sort butter vinaigrette sauce pesto stuffed middle fish  Interesting preparation but wish more asian kick it   As far sides little more saltier side    Will back give ramen try! <EOR> I tried Vegas Momofuku back May first time but most recent vacay trip September looks it'll definite go to whenever we're town  nature wildly unpredictable city dinner experience much more adventure we'd ever expected account both delicious food fantastic service!

Anyway worth try sure  <EOR> Located second floor right next Milk Cosmopolitan Hotel  always wanted try place but never time last time New York  excited see place open Las Vegas    Sad say disappointed taste price  ordered Pork Bao Bun $7 two Pork Ramens $18 each   Overall presentation well done  Pork Bao Bun delicious only reason why gave place 3 star 2   bun soft warm  oyster sauce gochujang sauce made savory sweet  pork soft charred smoky taste it  However ramen definitely worth it  Personally prefer thick tonkatsu soup when comes ramen  Momofuku soup light did lot depth flavor  soup sweet savory  wish little kick spice it  think would've made better but didn't want pay extra $1 chili oil  also weird put shredded chicken soup  felt didn't really well ramen pork  However portion pretty big even though pricy    We looking good hangover soup but place wasn't right choice us   same price little more feel something way better  personally would opt brunch buffet next time  <EOR> We absolutely PERFECT meal here   am wary celeb chefs burned overpriced overhyped food   But another level   We party 12 without reservation Monday night around 7p seated within minutes   waiter probably favorite waiter ever   HILARIOUS   loved him  Server check says Mags don't remember being name  Since many people try lot things   Everything highlight but don't miss dishes were Hamachi Shishito Peppers Ham tasting OMG! Grits Asparagus I know right?  best asparagus ever eaten  Potatoes 4 sides ordered them all all exceptional Other things mention The whole Branzino delicate beautifully prepared and left head off request thanks! Jidori chicken nothing exciting chicken    put Jidori front still chicken   Order something else  Dry Aged Ribeye sucker $85 00 came sliced easy sharing let tell couldn't eaten more couple slices   DIVINE but rich    I'd back recommended place many people already so don't screw up!

I husband night  ordered 3 things   Unfortunately weren't much Vegetarian Vegan options  waiter helped some suggestions even offered something off menu     1  Chickpea Ramen w Bok Choy Fermented Shiitake Mushrooms off menu  give 2 5  chickpeas dry side  wanted love but overall tasted bland seemed lack some flavor spice    2  Shishito Peppers  give guys 5 5! cooked fried perfectly! seasonings point just irresistible!  3  Roasted Potatoes  4 5  great! potatoes cooked well but toppings top bit overpowering seemed hide main ingredient potato  If plated myself I'd put cream base then potatoes then Parmesan imo  All all I'd back sure!  I just wish more Vegetarian Vegan options  <EOR> Solid choice when you're Cosmo  Really ambiance  Good place lunch dinner date significant other girlfriends  dressy casual  Customer service excellent impressed despite small portion left very full very satisfied  recommend coming around 5 15 catch social hour cocktail special chai if can! then move along dinner menu <EOR> I really don't ramen noodles there     but pork bun shrimp bun tasted good  However ramens disastrous <EOR> We seated window beautiful view strip   addition excellent service   order sharing menu if big group order few items together   chilled spicy noodles phenomenal shiitake mushroom bun its world too   other friends ordered sharing menu lobster shrimp looked really good too  <EOR> I momofuku NYC try ramen here  service excellent atmosphhere great hours 10am 2am awesome    The ramen happy with  pork belly amazing noodles very good but broth very thin clear chicken soup udon broth very tonkotsu all  ramen different but hoping rich almost creamy tonkotsu broth ramen  being said tasty but wanted expected  did chance try pork belly buns but given awesome pork belly ramen back try that  back ramen did satisfy craving  Some best ramen country just road Monta Ramen Vegas    beats all best places LA NYC opinion  <EOR> Went during happy hour ordered shrimp buns which really good   Loved steam buns pattie very good! Also ordered  pork belly ramen really good! best broth ever but still good decent portion size! <EOR> Let preface review stating am having trouble figuring properly Momofuku   First location fusion all other Momofuku restaurants    little bit ramen some noodles entrees even deserts  Instead linear focus menu quite large ton variety!  My wife both ordered pork ramen  18 dollars additional 1 dollar small side chili paste  price insane! most expensive bowl ramen ever enjoyed   Price aside ramen authentic very nice broth base good quality pork   The question left this    ramen 19 dollars good? Certainly not   4 stars ramen service 2 stars price  <EOR> 6 lobster tails larger number fried shrimp can't recall  Says serves 2 4 but 3 big eaters could barely eat two thirds bowl    Those cucumbers macadamia nuts delicious   Pass all buns except pork belly   And finally chilled spicy noodles not pictured highlight night  birthday cake!   Thanks Momofuku delightful birthday celebration! <EOR> I shishito peppers over priced ramen ok wouldn't order crab eggs again <EOR> I heard alot hype place but overrall experience interesting  Momofuku definitely stands unique twist all food  sushi sashimi place  wouldn't recommend place anyone likes stick safe choices burgers sandwiches sushi etc   heard mainly known its ramen however did pork belly ramen dinner menu all confused  But when asked said offer pork belly ramen   So  a little confused why popular dish wasn't menu? didn't alot choices ramen either  Most ordered pork belly ramen ordered lots appetizers Pork belly ramen broth little salty pork belly very soft easy chew  noodles okay nothing wow it  buns tasted bland  Pork belly buns Again pork belly tender good but eating bun just fail  pork belly big eat bun would've easier if meat cut smaller pieces maybe? Shrimp buns Shrimp buns little easier eat but again kept falling tried taking bite  shrimp good though nice sweet sauce  Spicy rice cakes rice cakes actually fried diced into squares  doesn't taste korean spicy rice cakes but sweet slight soy sauce type flavor pretty good  Hamachi probably favorite small plate  soft cucumbers really complimented fresh taste  wish gave abigger serving hamachi  $24 tiny plate! Shishito Peppers When waft peppers gave off feeling where feel spiciness your eyes  But when took bite didn't taste anything! felt eating steamed peppers couldn't taste lime saltiness  boss disagreed but must just tastebudz  Crispy Potatoes second favorite item menu  good  basically roasted potatoes but grated cheese green onions  Nicely seasoned crispy outside soft hot inside  wished eating breakfast ramen     There's couple more plates ordered but didn't try them   Overrall food interesting  gripe place food unique but small plates would great compliments other foods don't offer expensive  crispy potatoes would great rotisserie prime rib if only wasn't $72     Service prompt efficient  waiter attentive came around always refill waters which really appreciated  Most convenient part lazy susan  However prices just mad  $14 small pickle plate? Nah  come back here? Probably but glad tried it  <EOR> delicious food   high quality expensive  Ramen must! sitting bar see prepare stuff  those guys know doing <EOR> I've Momofuku saam bar NY where food service excellent expecting same experience LV  However while food excellent service subpar   The hostess outside stone cold when checked reservation  No smile nothing  then seated server checked asking water letting know she take care tonight  she leaves look over menu now we're waiting come take order  see right front chatting table good 10 minutes so  Meanwhile we're just waiting literally right behind she walks away 2 other tables check them  point 15 mins since sat down no taken order checked us  flag down manager grabbed someone take order    The cucumbers buns came quickly  friend bf ordered pork ramen ordered summer truffle ramen  almost finished ramen before mine came out  server apologized longer wait food  wasn't sure if ramen took longer prepare which if server told when ordered would've fine with    A bit disappointing experience considering experience NY way different  <EOR> The buns AWESOME no words them justice  yourself favor taste flavor  <EOR> First time momofuku last time sure  Celebrated mother's birthday brunch family  many restaurants Las Vegas brunch dinner off strip really excited try place out  Unfortunately only thing menu thought good boa otherwise everything else just ok   If plan competing all other restaurants strip improve your menu options your portions  server forgot name did best but also bussing own tables  Despite understood he multiple large parties but still gave nice thank note nice tip  However leaving establishment wanted take picture family mom celebrating 77th Birthday  sister nicely asked hostesses if could take group photo  230p busy but still hostesses particular looked irritated  She reluctantly took picture without smile proceeded still look irritated even asked speak manager  Most places brunch dinner Andiron Hakkasan Honey Salt Stacked Fix Herringbone Seersucker Palm Wolfgang puck craftsteak Yellowtail Milos Kumi Jaleo more always way your experience good one  taking photo capture your experience social media norm       being said front service hostesses momofuku did smile did ask lunch did thank coming in  far better restaurants strip exceptional customer service willing above beyond create memorable experience  place sure them  <EOR> This long overdue update first visit which disappointment service  Momofuku four times since found improvements service much better food consistent   I suggest unique experience pre order large format meal  Pork Bossam all sides perfection  small feeds least four people main course but sure try pork bun some noodle options  I'm happy service improved really does break meal   Looking forward coming back  Thank David Ryan! <EOR> I feel bad leaving 3 star review when everybody else raving place   Let's start like  people working really friendly  You're seated immediately service prompt  sat tall tables front area  ambiance hip trendy  play good music but loud can't carry conversation  Oh loved cocktail called Spring Fling! delicious  When came ordering food husband underwhelmed limited menu options  decided ginger scallion noodle pork belly he shoyu pork ramen  Mine came only few visible ingredients lightly seasoned which didn't mind only piece pork belly  enjoyed but just don't think pay $16 okay tasting noodle dish again  hubby thought ramen lacked saltiness would expect any ramen dish  Oh ordered shrimp bun appetizer  saddest tiny bun costed $7  Since don't any raw stuff half menu feel opinion might biased  But still options limited! <EOR> The buns good! Waiter staff AMAZING  sat chef counter see all! Such great addition Cosmo! <EOR> Momofuku many restaurants owned Momofuku group  heard many restaurants quite excited try here  made reservations around 10 friend's birthday Saturday    +BRUSSEL SPROUTS CAULIFLOWER Comes uni aioli pomegranate seeds  They're great contrast savory brussel sprouts cauliflower is  Great side item! PORK RAMEN fair say more American style ramen  broth wasn't creamy flavorful  However lot meat combination pork belly shoulder  belly wasn't soft normally like  Overall just okay  CHINESE BROCCOLI alright nothing special kind basic  portion also really small but understandable since listed side item    It note came dinner ramen menu  However lunch menu ask them ramen options  still order dinner which nice  also specials which some group enjoyed  waitress curious input since she said they're considering menu   The service amazing all due wonderful waitress  She very friendly made sure everything needed  She also quite honest menu saying group meal option could feed more people listed  Furthermore friend's birthday she birthday cookie candle ice cream apparently just give cookie   She also suggested take picture balcony restaurant if no there  People ended getting seated opted group picture which she grabbed taller waiter all it    The staff wonderful but found some food only okay though brussel sprouts great! Perhaps ordered wrong thing I'd love come back try some other offerings  <EOR> This place located Cosmopolitan located next Milk Bar well    The menu bit pricey end caviar over $1k oh my shoyu ramen pork belly bao potatoes which shared someone    Ramen 3 5 5 am personally miso ramen person myself wish just ordered vegetarian miso ramen added pork belly egg add ons  Otherwise contents ramen itself pretty good classic soft boiled egg naruto seaweed etc    Pork belly bao 5 5 LOVED bao  ordered lot before but perfect  Though bit small nailed perfectly  pork belly super crispy skin part but once bit into melted mouth butter  Easily best thing ordered 3    Potatoes 4 5  good dish share friend  Realized loaded lot carbs noodles bao lol  But pretty much loaded fingerling potatoes some sauce could dip in!   I also tried some friend's slow roasted pork shoulder ssam which doing lettuce wrap rice kimchi meat together boi humongous  Yummy but started dense she took home leftovers <EOR> Finally Momofuku see all hype about  someone watched every video David Chang known man and Christina Tosi time see place all about    Overall I'd say good meal  someone spends lot time Asia many flavors familiar me  fusion American Asian fun whole  If you've never never plan going rarely Asia then place treat    The bao ordered pork shrimp good  pork bao classic dish but amped smoky pork richer sauces  shrimp bao really good fusion Chinese Thai shrimp middle very similar Thai shrimp cake while wrap still large    The lamb ribs surprise sweet salty spicy tangy Korean style ribs paired yogurt dill Mediterranean  never expected would well    The spicy cold noodles cold pesto meatballs  discombobulating its flavor combinations but if cold noodles should fun you  pesto made Thai basil itself nice surprise    We kept meal simple planned head Milkbar dessert    If any those dishes alone except bao would say would overwhelmingly eat dishes many complicated flavors  However if group 2 or better yet 4 more order share  enjoy your meal much more way  <EOR> Came dinner other night husband roommates  never myself love name means lucky peach!   From moment checked end meal service exceptional  hard find great service restaurants am happy actually able kind service    The place good size art decor wall  sat near window which gave nice view planet Hollywood  When sat greeted right away server nice enough give opinion many questions    We suggestion half portion Bo Ssam since large portion side menu  also oysters dry roasted mussels spicy cucumber appetizer pork belly buns unagi buns truffle potatoes Brussels sprouts cauliflower pork ramen which isn't dinner menu but asked it   Everything really great love plates utensils changed pretty much every dish ate    I highly recommend pork belly buns!
