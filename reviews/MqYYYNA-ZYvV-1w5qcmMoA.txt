Lots assumptions made all night  instance just first course asked if wanted any more bread I already tried roll   replied right now which evidently prompted server clear bread plate knife butter  would proper and polite ask first  Lots little details all night surprised given formerly stellar reputation institution   The food good but great  wasn't starving just 3 course menu  corn chowder cioppino cheese  chowder featured tiny crab cake center dish which tasted very fishy dried overcooking  also pull some corn gristle mouth which always gross  cioppino almost no flavor  Seriously  put salt which helped but honestly looked tasted someone poured thin tomato broth over 4 count them clams few unidentifiable pieces fish  could gotten better cioppino any seaside diner California  cheese fine albeit received TINY piece three cheeses total  mean small mean only piece  Very stingy   The wine program obviously very extensive   made restaurant famous originally  why wanted come primarily  see wine angels ascent wine tower  Sadly though many patrons around ordered bottles no angels ascended  only assume bottles stored somewhere else well? Bummer    However plus side did enjoy wine selection service  opted 2008 Christian Moreau Chablis 1r Cru Vaillons which $90  lovely Chardonnay which paired well chowder particular   few interesting bottles long list priced below $100  Wine service well executed prompt  glass always filled right time right amount   In end spotty meal few highlights  wonder if Aureole retired re vamped? other should probably happen soon  <EOR> Love coming when Vegas  happy hour awesome! featured wine $6 I sparkling regularly $15 glass   sirloin sliders which looked perfect little mini burger  awesome  bartenders also fun yet professional  wine cellar middle restaurant all way second floor surrounded glass see into it  very classy delicious place! <EOR> Fish really dry   Steak average   Duck good   2 wine stewards gave different summery wine   impressed  <EOR> I loved place  Foie gras die  filet cooked seasoned perfection  Everything ordered awesome  Deserts amazing especially pistachio ice cream  coming back  <EOR> Had fantastic dinner dear friend   ambience awesome wine storage definitely focal point   service wonderful sommelier gave recommendation great Pinot main courses duck ahi tuna + scallops   All all great dining experience  <EOR> This rating based dinner visit   Atmosphere 4 5 Entry into restaurant features stroll down staircase around glass wine tower which something sets Aureole apart crowd   two seating choices main dining room Swan Court   chose Swan Court which more private quiet romantic   room overlooks pond curious swans swimming seemed interested checking out   only downside Swan Court no view Wine Angels flying wine tower retrieve your special bottle Vino    Menu 4 two options menu 1  fixed Parallel menu two selections each course   Parallel menu tasting menu where selections aren't choices but both course items served together parallel   option only selected if entire table willing choice   2  Select traditional style menu variety appetizers main courses sides   fixed menu because loved being able sample wide variety dishes  option offered diverse selections   Service 5 Four Diamond restaurant expectations fairly high but Aureole did disappoint   Service fantastic moment entered right until left   wife some food allergies staff did phenomenal job accommodating modifying some dish preparations     Food 5 Outstanding!

It's total disappointment   Even though wine tower does dramatic introduction poorly lit staircase which spirals down around destroys it   There's very slow elevator but decided walk down monument Aureole's greatness order experience full effect   arrived bottom thought meh  ambiance nice boring depending your situation   intimate dinner two revel each others' eyes hold hands you'll probably enjoy it   boring   Quiet stuffy unless you're seated rear restaurant which nice window looking fountain lake total drag   Even though hardly anyone else restaurant large party seated right foot wine tower front restaurant   very distracting hear loud descending footsteps later arriving diners during meal   People party ordered couple bottles wine but because seated bottom wine tower never see them retrieve it   certain even did retrieve bottles wine tower   Similar dining over rated beach restaurant way sun set darkness envelopes felt missed best part putting inflated prices mediocre food   Restrooms ridiculous   open concept gone extremely wrong   no door powder room woman's side men's side both which communal circular trough only water dispenser wash your hands well mirror   ladies don't expect any privacy space if you're going touch yourself up   also only toilet room each side which fortunately does door but everyone else wait outside powder areas watch each side wash hands   truly idiotic design  Service also abysmal considering supposedly top notch restaurant Vegas  start finish things took long time none polish top restaurant   Drinks took forever table food arrived without known destination diner like question server fish? fastest most efficient service delivery collecting check   hate restaurants incompetent until want pay hell out   Food also sadly poor   Although several prix fixe meals choose only most expensive sounded appetizing   since things such impressive start decided save myself some money order cheapest least appealing prix fixe meal   won't into detail since rotate menu frequently others more likely won't able order anything but everything just ho hum   fault disappointed meal?  Maybe but feel wasn't missing anything based reactions fellow diners ordered more extravagantly saved myself some money lose tables   = Finally worst part meal dessert   Multiple bdays meant multiple free desserts which first seemed delightful since came large assortment sorbets cakes other items   But them tasty   fact several fruit sorbets horrible couldn't stand more small spoonful   Way close meal low note Aureole!  took slow elevator ride hell there!  Do need say it?  somewhere else! <EOR> Eh    there better places eat strip   price high type restaurant   convenient tired  <EOR> I restaurant week priced fixed dinner wine pairing  passing wine tower numerous times finally eat here    The service attentive without being over top  beef short shallots good but expecting bit more wasabi pomme puree    It fun place dine because wine tower wine selection being Ipads  <EOR> Ordered fall tasting menu  Best decision ever  try many different things everything brought nice steady pace  <EOR> We want highly recommend restaurant  Great food good service  Expensive but much  Went back day 5 7 happy hour bar  Great formula nice cocktails small plates very reasonable price  David bartender must  <EOR> Ambiance decor wine tower 5 Service had ask menu utensils bill 1 Food 2  So getting seated group request menus being ignored 10 minutes  we 2 servers came wine cocktail menus first maybe hoping we'd drink much wouldn't notice slow service was    finally getting menus ordering served nice selection breads   When food came everyone entrees except nicely asked waitress check order us   When waiter returned swordfish he said reason didn't bring dish because switched seats servers sent dish back when saw food already present original seat   couldn't decide whether he just presenting excuse being accusatory but wasn't sure why didn't just ask if extra entree mine since didn't any food front me   started eat fish very impressed way seasoned   However started middle filet noticed wasn't fully cooked   asked waitress if type fish supposed served way she claimed chef liked prepare but if wanted she could take back hubby foodie then tells swordfish supposed fully cooked    getting fish back only able eat outside parts because middle still cooked   point full mini vegetables didn't ask them try again   thinking would 1 star rating but sadly must confess easily bribed desserts   waitress seen disappointment and uneaten fish said she would send some sorbet made house   She ended sending sorbet ice cream found them very light flavorful!  Voila!  gain back star!    So final say is   If you're wine drinker which not would probably want try reason because selection pretty vast   mention gimmicky wine faeries fun watch fetch your order   Otherwise save $120 200 slots because knows could spin wheel fortune machines win Megabucks! <EOR> Had Parallel tasting menu last night but graciously substituted two more fish preparations Lamb course  started two raw preparations  first fluke second lobster  Both included pineapple  fluke slightly spicy macadamia nut coconut topping  lobster used grilled pineapple small green papaya salad  Both fresh tasty    Next duo carrots  First nicely seared scallop  other half seared tuna small plank carrot pound cake    The third course supposed lamb but gave black cod sauteed broccoli slightly spicy sauce  other half course salmon nicely red wine reduction   Dessert baklava stack concord grapes ice cream middle  slightly dry hard eat but filling great  other half dessert chocolate gelatin biscotti Napoleon    It anniversary restaurant gave very nice additional dessert sampler  lemon case strawberries most memorable  very nice touch   All food very good service excellent  waiter very helpful but never intrusive  rest staff kept wine flowing water glasses full bread plates filled  room very attractive novelty watching women repel down wine tower good conversation  food service price worthwhile  <EOR> I would highly recommend Aureole  husband happy hour evening while staying Mandalay Bay  impressed ended up going three nights row  prices very  reasonable was an unending list wines drinks  Dave Dave Sal great  know them very knowledgable all foods drinks  great to sit down visit such nice people  also liked fact only was the happy hour food but drinks also great variety choose from  Dave showed around dining room beautiful dining area with pond outside full swans chairs sit relax in  can't wait to go back visit aureole again  hope doesn't popular but am sure it because provides such great experience!

Thanks Jose Chef Vincent well! <EOR> This third time sad say pretty terrible time  The oysters ice them literally tasted sitting freezer super fishy The lobster cooked gummy Fish did taste fresh  Ravioli OK steak pretty good For $350 dollar meal definitely expect more very least fresh seafood The last time same meal couple years ago great Not sure changed  The dessert inedible poor choice  Bree cheese blue cheese cheesecake  No bueno <EOR> We excited try restaurant many recommendations eat during stay MB  When seated great host staff told changed Chefs menus  came try blue cheese filet but no longer menu  Very foie gras heavy exotic  tap water bad!!! wine list extensive but very expensive  Service good but great    Food Ordered lobster bisque which excellent tomahawk two which ok  better  Sides green beans truffle risotto  Both ok  Nothing rave about  dessert ordered Pumpkin spice cake which presented cake crumble small scoop ice cream  Good but again nothing rave about    Overall pretty disappointed    food previous menu looked good hoping same experience  3 stars  <EOR> What truly exceptional dining experience    no preconceived expectations restaurant chose purely walking looking menu   happy restaurant Gods intervened meal happen me   We started off super hungry ordered pork belly pasta grilled ocotpus 4 course parallel tasting menu between three us     oh added German chocolate soufflé too!    All three blown away meal   Comments would hear during meal each include single best bite pasta ever  The octopus most expertly cooked octopus years   The orange mousse most surprisingly good dessert can't stop eating it  personal favorite bites night lobster ravioli pork belly pasta goat cheesecake caramel mousse!  An absolute 5 start dining experience    No culinary stone left unturned mailed every dish delightful perfection   Can't wait return! <EOR> Aureole very pretty  wide open main room several story high ceiling candlelit elegant tables dim lighting which could intimate if date but just little dark if you're trying something new actually want see your food course elevated entryway bridge stairwell there's also elevator four story tall wine tower   food though didn't really measure up   okay but expected brilliance match price setting  I almost want rate 2 disappointment  admit portions excellent sizes  no skimping appetizers entrees   'Entertainment' wise bit sad throughout leisurely dinner only saw wine angels thing twice once because high roller specifically asked see it   understand guaranteed thing course  show  but restaurant's main showpieces just expected tower more utilized   Would return?  Probably not   only okay plenty other nice restaurants Vegas  <EOR> i think more 3 5 star situation but round total jackass    i didn't appreciate when walked doorway desk phone looks someone going seat let know what's going on  instead douchey other customer walk pretend he waitstaff  nice  just made restaurant look bad douchey mc douche    my friends wanted nice restaurant suggested aureole  little disappointing when would fail little  entrance no real greeting  then when finished bread two small pieces doesn't hungry people waiting steak waited them come back offer more    but didn't    one friend ordered ribeye which wanted  but per don't copy other people's food order rule lamb chops  lamb chops good  friend let try ribeye oh man quite tasty  wanted grab off plate eat all hahahaha    i think favorite part meal french onion soup  can't wrong gruyere truffles foie gras french onion soup  unless consomme horrible  which not  best french onion soup opinion    i would back future but still lot other fine dining choices strip vegas area try out    i think perhaps glass better    australian copy aureole  probably helps fresher seafood options disposal    so guess could say french onion soup rib eye lamb chops carried whole rating  but wouldn't fair  really decor too  said recommend giving them try = <EOR> I two times during stay Mandalay Bay    My first experience happy hour  service actually pretty bad  did stock only nonalcoholic beer advertised happy hour  said going coming shortly did guest want something else meantime  He ordered ginger ale charged full price above price beer  Weird  French onion soup so so ribs  But tiny sliders awesome cheese plate   The second visit company party excellent  Same cheese plate but enormous party size  Same burgers less toppings   If could 3 5 stars would <EOR> Got pre fixe menu steak good  expecting more since Charlie Palmer restaurant but food didn't impress me  service average just kind felt wanted turn table around pretty quickly instead providing great service would expect here  Next time am Vegas try someplace else  <EOR> Soooo  I said last review Bouchon full because ate appetizer somewhere else first   place believe essentially mistake think dining partner stumbled upon looking another place nearby but closed Mondays   mistakes sometimes decisions consciously but turn just wonderful end   Neat   Kind modern   large wine cellar see dining partner likes sort thing lot    We decided check something small   three cheese plate   really good   Dining partner french onion soup   puff pastry gruyere cheese foie gras it   need discuss good reader?  think all know just great   Enough said   Fun times   service normal Vega$ y servers helpful nice   early lot crowds   decided Bouchon more yumminess when stomach exploded but nice food memories Vega$  <EOR> Food ok  Service ok  Everything just ok  worth price  ok  many other places LV  <EOR> Great customer service but food terrible  Blue Cheese Encrusted Filet  No seasoning actually very fatty  eaten some great steak houses Banderas Flemmings Mastros hands down worst steak ever had  <EOR> Sighhhhhh   wife wanting dine Aureole quite some time finally obliged made reservation   Sadly restaurant sure even needed res Friday night   Bread 3 options Rosemary Pretzel i forget third didn't try it    Rosemary warm fluffy worth second around   If you've dined all last 12 18 months probably noticed pretzel bread all rage found almost anywhere   Unfortunately really misses mark here   Maybe just unlucky but bread room temp fairly dry   Apps where little disappointment grew   If attempt check Aureole online find much different menu find person   heart set shrimp scampi app prior coming but soon found available   torn between two options French Onion Soup based waiters recommendation   I'd say average better might chain restaurant but best had   wife crab risotto which more pricey but also hearty rich   would recommend app split because think wife most women would give dish before finishing it   Entrees If don't extra large appetite ahi tuna scallop entree good option   tuna high quality cooked rare   scallops also cooked perfectly enjoyed spice level dish   However portion very large if your stomach growling might feel entree more appetizer   wife lamb chop special which nice   chops fairly large size cooked perfectly   Overall she happy selection plenty food her   Dessert chocolate trio which nice because 3 desserts perfect two people split   fondue favorite three but donut good similar option always Scarpetta   Also forget middle option called but came some coated bacon strips   think added salty element especially bacon also very think desserts now but bacon just amount hassle   only bite just stuck all teeth pretty annoying   Lastly service wasn't bad slow but Jerry Seinfeld might describe waiter low talker  Eventually just gave listening recommendations because couldn't hear word he saying   All all Aureole okay but nothing struck unique superior many similar options Vegas can't say would prefer come back versus trying somewhere new  <EOR> The reason give 2 stars first impressions when arrived a  7 30 pm reservation made wait bar till 8 pm table   lady front desk very unfriendly professional   When finally came time seat she problem bringing briefcases saying would way  conference

business meeting  Happy hour short time 9 30pm 10 30pm <EOR> I'm still fan place but having returned several times since initial review noticed quality service food wine list dwindling  Given choice I'd opt nearby Fleur de Lys over Aureole  <EOR> I stuck stupid first time walked into establishment   design lavish restaurant made head spin   Pristine white marble everywhere   I dont know many stories glass wine tower made mouth drop   Fluffy Swans   Ridiculously gorgeous   My boss made reservation he rubs elbos Mr  Palmer himself   greeted Aureole's Manager Kevin overly fawned upon moment cousin introduced ourselves   felt old Hollywood   waiter handed intimdating mini laptop device aka wine list asked pick   looked if he grew another head   told trust you  Well done  he walks away

enjoyed Niman Ranch Double Cut Pork Chop Roasted Garlic Pomme Puree which absolute buttery bliss   Service little stuffy waiters need brush English pronunciation listening abilities   Luckily food tasty because otherwise wouldn't giving 4 stars planning going back future  <EOR> I've only work dinners   If paying own check I'd probably choose different restaurant feel bit overpriced quality food  It Vegas however everything expensive so        restaurant entrance lobby quite nice wine tower eye catching centerpiece main dining room   Service attentive though bit slow paced   no difficulty getting attention server when dined here   suspect some people may interpret leisurely pace poor service  Each time dined server frequently came through fill water wine glasses see if anything needed ensure enjoying dinners   also found them very accommodating example making some substitutions even though ordered prix fixe menu    All all good experiences here  <EOR> Loved everything place!

Alas Super Bowl    I prix fixe menu amazing  stuffed end   giving husband tastes throughout  Service perfect  expecting them bit snotty weren't all  Just enough attention paid keep things moving   Would back heartbeat  <EOR> I really hate can't give higher rating huge Charlie Palmer fan but just can't  anything majorly wrong  just meh    which very disappointing friend town wanted spoil  years since just didn't meet experience painted I  mind   First off bragged amazing wine tower wine angels  remembered angels wore practical yet kind sophisticated sleek looking black cat suit reeled down impressive tower  poor girl wearing very unflattering thing kind kind boring grayish nude color sneakers  When paying fine dining experience don't want something reminiscent gym suit sneaker face    Now fiasco menu    already planned doing special Restaurant Week menu but being both foodies still wanted start app share  menu incredibly confusing broken down into appetizers entrees  all clumped together based veggies land sea no idea realistic shareable item versus entree  wasn't until 20 30 minutes staring confusion heck looking before server came explain it  menu shouldn't confusing can't figure where appetizers listed    We pretty big into wine part reason chose place dynamic wine list  But let's face more options more overwhelming be  asked server help really kind expected sommelier come ask questions palates planned ordering   part fun choosing such wine centric restaurant  server nice enough but just kind fumbled seemed just pure random suggestion   Now figured unlock appetizer mystery super excited see bacon wrapped pork belly topped egg  pork belly itself amazing however egg top should sexy oozing when yolk hit  way over done  No sexy oozing which big disappointment should amazing dish     For entree originally going seafood risotto but server awkwardly talked into filet instead  am no means opposed good steak but dime dozen town wanted something interesting  love servers suggestions since usually know guide into something may overlooked  But really odd when someone orders something seafood guided extreme opposite steak  suggestion even though really excited try risotto  if something he knew top secret   maybe people kept sending back fish wasn't fresh  since didn't feel dying reluctantly filet  filet amazing would expect no less Charlie Palmer   friend trying eat healthier yes same person just ordered bacon wrapped pork belly ordered zucchini pasta vegan cheese entree  really kind shocked filet tasting menu same price vegetarian pasta could made home spiralizer  She said good but $80 per person should fantastic  Saying used black garlic just doesn't seem enough justify cost that   Dessert interesting  trio cheesecake representing Brie cheddar blue cheese  all teasing taste buds dancing between sweet savory but just didn't seem work especially blue cheese portion  just salty enough vibrancy offset it  exciting way finish off meal   Now bathroom situation  Really awkward classy all  First individual restrooms which nice touch place supposed elegant  However no mirror sink basically co ed mirror wash station  some creepy guy kept lurking around corner watching  Maybe sign times no longer having assigned sex bathrooms  But last thing want fine dining establishment some creepster checking trying remove spinach lodged teeth   From understanding recently underwent big remodel closed awhile  could explain some things going but don't charge top dollar while still practice   Better off going Charlie Palmer's Steak adjoining Four Seasons  doesn't beautiful monstrosity wine tower but more dozen times always exceptional experience  <EOR> Beautiful wine tower food super  early because show catch but sped service wouldn't miss show   Everything tasted great   Would definitely again   Nice date type restaurant  <EOR> I dinner 3 friends   Everything good   would definitely back   wine tower where hook ropes rappel down pretty cool   wasn't fanciest atmosphere but all all good experience   service good food  <EOR> A restaurant within restaurant  12 tables booths look waterfall pond where swans spend time entertaining dine pre fix menu which always exceptional  wine list extensive noise factor present eating Aureole's  service good gets  Wish could afford every month but settle once twice year  definite must try out <EOR> Was excited visit restaurant recent trip Vegas fell short all expectations  sommelier wine excellent loved appetizers hence two star review  However service main entrees desserts horrible would never return   We party 8 early Friday night dinner 6pm because show 9 30 wanted savor wine food  restaurant basically empty sat table right next room large wedding reception going on  politely asked waiter reseat right before water poured since no dearth free tables he every excuse book reseating Oh they're just taking seats it'll quiet down soon   close doors bit  I couldn't hear anyone opposite side table pulled waiter over again told wanted reseated But best table here! else we'd leaving  second thought should just left gone other restaurants Mandalay Bay since basically great experience every tried  Finally reseated much better table  Finally   We appeased appetizers wine  four oysters half shell served lemon horseradish tabasco  Yummy  also small plate peach cheese tartlet delish  Caesar salad dining companion ordered deconstructed looked cool but tasted bland  But order yellowtail served kiwi watermelon puree excellent   Well main star Aureole wine its computerized wine list given iPad type device wine fairies suspended wine tower retrieve your choices  enjoyed peppery Chilean Malbec buttery Napa Chardonnay delicious enjoyed entire table   I wish just ended dinner because main entrees huge disappointment  ordered entree tuna veal which stone cold  sent back obvious just microwaved becuase tuna which ordered rare now barely even pink  sauce served salty overpowering sent back again offered something else but point stomach turned didn't want anything else  Steaks table fine but worth $40 50 pricetag good Palm another high end chain  Two dinners tasting menu impressed either   Desserts came called chocolate decadence basically little chocolate tart size half dollar coin  laughed ridiculous dessert since barely looked chocolatey didn't ooze chocolate you'd expect   To credit Aureole tried better though could tell waiter sullen pissed off  gave $100 off bill gave three plates ice cream which chocolatier decadance bottle pink dessert wine unbelieveably good   So go  If apps wine lounge  You'll same ambiance good appetizers same wine list  <EOR> My daughter took dinner birthday amazing everyone sweet very elegant sophisticated  little situation through dinner chef kind sweet offer dessert thought going end dinner nicely surprised extraordinary desserts  Everyone lovely hostess waiter manager sweet overly kindly head chef Jonny  Thank lovely birthday dinner  <EOR> My husband secured reservation first trip Vegas  loved concept wine Angels thought we'd treated amazing meal warm atmosphere given other reviews Yelp    Boy wrong    After being seated table husband pointed wine vault  turned around attempt see noticed glass divider behind frosted  unable view anything going wine vault  Also tables centered around both assumed they'd and all know happens when assumes     Okay wasn't centered around gravity defying wine grabbing ladies  No biggie  must great selection wine right?! BUT present iPad 2004 judging its weight  Okay   progressive people cool that! Except list broken down into such minute categories no way view them all once  Want wine France? Better know region comes from! also better prepared sift through eight regions broken down grape TYPE    After being greeted sommelier did nothing help oh hard browse menu? Take few more minutes then decide  going offer any suggestions cause  job *leaves table* greeted only assume arrogant waiter read menu then literally tossed menu back front walked off  No suggestions no asking if needed anything   nada  Dude walked off he just done favor  Cause can't read  Ugh    The only redeeming thing night very nice GM asked opinion new wine menu  actually booked reservation Veranda Four Seasons while sitting here  leaving before ordering something never done! AMAZING meal Veranda!! <EOR> What weird place  drinks appetizers didn't feel walking down huge slippery looking staircase opted elevator  dusty waiting 3 minutes didn't anywhere  Stairs please    Then sat table bar which mostly empty waited 5 minutes anyone come over   not mention random forks knives table like 10 them     Finally someone came over ordered drinks 2 apps  15 minutes later food came before drinks  asked guy said oops ran off them which sitting bar long now watery    The food just so  No flavor  artichoke hearts boring carpaccio seriously bland  actually sent back  Then waiter felt bad stood talked literally 10 minutes I just wanted leave     Poor service and no weren't even busy dull food  going back    PS bar downstairs but open space see down main walkway Mandalay  chatty waiter told drunk people sometimes drop bottles drinks top balcony right onto bar  Uh   bad food concussion? No thanks  <EOR> This place just exudes class   moment see wine cellar which obviously centerpiece amazing restaurant your interaction hostess walk down past all wine bottles comfortable relaxed ambiance restaurant sense transported somewhere far away incessant noise slot machines drunk bar patrons crying children exist 100 feet away     The wait staff Johnny on the spot without being overly intrusive which sometimes hard thing balance   all very helpful ready suggestions including actually saved money telling option weren't aware of     Naturally wine  assume you'd tossed invited back if didn't given effort put into cellar   wines marked typical amount restaurants caliber found we'd enjoyed before reasonable price reasonable Vegas Total Wine   watched wine angel grab bring down which always interesting experience given its uniqueness     The steaks easily some best Vegas easily comparable best steakhouses tried visited nearly every casino's offerings   wife M friends time all raved dinner weeks afterwards   asked M if she wanted hit Aureole when back Vegas month immediate Hell Yes!

Finally another guy wasn't original waiter come over took order  We all ordered 4 coarse Parallel Tasting Talk overpriced disaster! don't want sound spoiled brat but if paying $$$$ then expect really good service  experiences highly rated high class restaurants usually tell plate  did that  food quite good   Im only giving place 1 star because to  Sommelier extremely friendly very helpful  food really good but such low quality service really left bad taste mouth  yes she said I excited try place but never back  <EOR> We going Light Saturday night hungry   restaurant restaurant looking something eat but everything 30 45 minute wait   then walked Aureole saw wine cellar just take look   then saw sign saying happy hour decided best option in   We everything happy hour menu amazing   perfect amount food 4 people expensive either   I can't speak restaurant menu since only happy hour  <EOR> Arrived Vegas Rock N Roll marathon walking through Mandalay Bay when friend stopped place  originally reservations another place but wound canceling those eating here   wine list huge!! bring e tablet choose bottle glass  server comes each table variety fresh baguette breads  menu many enticing options but ended choosing Chef Vincent`s Market 3 course menu  Starters breaded calamari slight tangy spice sauce yum!   Main course Beef skirt steak bourbon wasabi mashed potatoes asparagus scrumptious!   Dessert mango cheesecake lemon cello ice cream well thought supposed but ended pistachio ice cream? sure why!? Bonus though since also friend`s birthday sent over additional dessert trio! Oh wow more decadence!! No problem since town  half marathon!

I'd ok food airline food but $95 plate prix menu supposedly best restaurants vegas  Blah  sent email manager    surprise didn't hear anything back  Whatever  All tell avoid place   I probably eat nice restaurant least twice month possibly more   love food forgive all service mistakes ambience issues throw if good food     I didn't good food   Sorely disappointed  <EOR> Came tonight another couple dinner before show  menu really confusing  There's tasting menu prix fixe menu la cart if desire  took good 10 minutes figure all out  husband decided share prix fixe menu which includes appetizer entree dessert  chose romaine salad Caesar bleu cheese crusted 8oz filet chocolate trio dessert  Caesar salad good but spectacular  put anchovy plate which little much me  hint anchovy but actual fish! filet very yummy especially bleu cheese  Sharing perfect thing especially when entire three course meal  chocolate trio INCREDIBLE  Churro chocolate sauce mini chocolate covered ice cream pops rich chocolate mousse  good  5 30pm Thursday pretty quiet  best place sit back where view both swans side wine tower other  also awesome happy hour menu! <EOR> I came birthday few months ago full dining experience   place beautiful atmosphere very friendly wait staff host   sat down eat picked glass wine meals   say when food came served such large dish but wasn't much food it   food did eat very tasteful but wasn't much   price pay you'd hope your full but left craving cheeseburger   There much better value other restaurants Mandalay Bay   Unless already ate looking nice dessert port wine don't recommend coming because leave hungry dropping $200  <EOR> happy hour great  19th hole along ribs   can't wrong   bar seating which nice <EOR> This place really cool! always feel fancy when come here  Love wine tower  usually come happy hour delicious apps  Bartenders always friendly ae wine sommaliers walking around discuss different wines  Definitely tech friendly Ipads bars order wine!

The caprese delish delicate seasoned well very light melted your mouth $20 The steak came carved sliced juicy ready eat! Three sauces accompanied huge steak wasn't two steaks but just huge slab meat  really rare medium well but bad better rare burnt enjoyed anyway  $140 Side dishes were potato purée awesome yummy very buttery but delicious $12 Parmigiana French fries kinda cold kinda greasy kinda heavy  Didn't care them  $11  Service good  Malik waiter he friendly helpful described everything  only complaint servers bussers watching every move but every time glasses empty actually ask refills  shouldn't ask anything when place empty three four people didn't take eyes off us  When drinks almost empty please refills ready! <EOR> Came family sneakily sat 2 different tables could use $50 coupon restaurants com  nothing ashamed We all ordered $65 prix fixe menu course table dad ordered tasty bottle grenache alta maria vineyards  recommended very helpful knowledgeable sommelier  place asking reco way cool wine tablet menu cool but talking person much nicer  she gave several options price range based descriptors liked planning order fantastic job thanks allison!

agree previous poster cold bread joke fine dinning establishment   Ok onto food  very short point UNEDIBLE! sent back every course except white truffles risotto  rest food mean all four courses because even second choices manager made try compensate disastrous first course horrible     A total disappointment nauseating experience  Anybody rates great food no idea great food no way eaten Roubocon Guy Savoy    Do waste your money  <EOR> Had 3 course tasting menu   my second time Aureole disappointed   wines glass excellent   Ate bar when alone only place eat   Service good while pricey quality all over food  <EOR> Vegas Aureole somewhat more casual New York relative  located right restaurant row Mandalay Bay right across Japanese Restaurant Kumi   It's lower level need take elevator walk down two story glass enclosed wine cellar which harness mounted wine tenders down your bottle while tourists take photos   Menu somewhat similar New York location good choice seafood meat dishes  No matter your liking find dish but somewhat pricey side    There bar seating main dining room also outdoor seating if feel it   Wine list seems lot more approachable New York location  Wines bottle low $50s four digits if winning big casino floor   Service excellent party nine people strict restrictions   Enjoy! <EOR> Had 3 course tasting menu   1st Course Lobster artichoke salad * Rack NZ lamb*** Chocolate souffl* I sorely disappointed first desert! ambiance cool concept wine angels innovative but did see anyone any wine vault all during 3 hour meal  wine menu also supercool but food stinks  help great though  <EOR> First class service excellent food   drinks made well won't break bank   If want away riff raff Vegas then nice safe haven  <EOR> We some time kill before dinner drink  host guaranteed would love martini would free  loved bartenders couldn't any nicer  even drew map napkin suggested hiking trails   The martini awesome  jalepeno blood orange martini  little pricey martini but huge  refilled glasses three times shaker   Great atmosphere wine fairy flits around three story glass wine cellar selecting wines   I'd love dinner sometime definitely back martini  <EOR> My most favorite restaurant when come visit Vegas  love tall glass wine tower extensive wine selection  friend once told jokingly place considered fine dining books when there's crumb sweeper  place fine dining then guess!  three course menu which absolutely delicious especially foie gras  Beef tender cooked perfectly sides weren't overpowering  waiter also walks around bread basket 5 different kinds breads choose from  appetizers best presentation think  If come try bottle wine just see worker hoisted top grab bottle! <EOR> Aureole good but great which book seems damn shame when you're dropping $300+ dinner  But since Vegas didn't feel dining masses Des Moines thought we'd some fun nice dinner celebrate great 2006  PC tablet wine list great theory but also sort gimmicky felt ultimately 10 000+ bottle wine selection bit overwhelming  Although sommelier helpful narrowing down choices definitely helped some knowledge wine going in   meal itself again good but great  Nothing really jumps being standout can't even recall ate point  Contrast some 5 star restaurant experiences remember every last detail  Finally but service seemed bit schizo    least three different waiters all whom would show randomly throughout meal  So    sum if you're looking unique dining experience Vegas love wine then definitely try Aureole  Just sure kick ass tables beforehand otherwise kind waste $$  <EOR> I honestly say best steak entire life Aureole  Come ready spend fair amount money ain't cheap here!
