Best udon noodle had  Tender perfection  broth also top notch   chicken tempura added calamari standard good correctly fried  more tender tempora but overall experience atmosphere very good definitely place revisit   other restaurants all around full meal mix match  Thai others  enjoyable watch them noodles discuss changes compared Cali restaurant because humidity  <EOR> This place knows udon right whether hot udon signature udon all delicious! Udon Gratin amazing  noodles cooked perfectly nice bite them while cheese sauce extremely creamy every bite cheese strands would cut piece just ate rest udon  enjoyed slivers onion throughout dish giving crunch extra texture made dish much better  chicken cooked perfection gave good protein udon  beef udon other hand which friend delicious its own way  beef broth tasty its own very flavorful  udon once again cooked perfection absorbed some flavors broth  thinly sliced beef accompanied dish also very tender absorbed flavors broth  perfect dish current weather outside which cold very windy    But why four stars? gave them less star appetizer  friend shared pork lettuce wraps though delicious hint spiciness lettuce wraps came already assembled meat to lettuce ratio little lacking  appetizers good but udon amazing   Definitely recommend place! <EOR> Went high expectations maybe high  good new udon specialty place Vegas  amazing udon? Meh  Firmness wise prefer little bit more 'koshi'    Went party three ordered four different udon share Miso Carbonara Niku udon Tomato Seafood Ume shiso  Any other visit probably would appreciated carbonara tomato seafood more but bit sick little heavy liking    The Miso Carbonara quite expecting  hint miso carbonara which great  okay eat smaller portions but cream based broth become quite heavy    Tomato Seafood bit better eat terms heaviness made tomato cream based broth  Between two special udons prefer more   Ume shiso Niku beef udon fine  Nothing spectacular  broth Niku udon Kansai style lighter color flavor     I think specialty udons need bit work two bit drenched cream attempts fusion udon Italian weren't quite working well  Interested try udon gratin next time but may stick classics hard wrong them    Service could also use bit more work  okay but would've liked little more attention  <EOR> The food wasnt good  eating didn't feel satisfied  customer service ok  <EOR> Huge portions! Recommend trying cold hot udon dish  Cold showcases delightful chewiness noodle itself  Hot udon yummy unctuous broth we tried uni vegetaful   also ordered takoyaki perfectly cooked tender octopus pieces topped bonito flakes special aioli  order add rice bowl $5  tried seafood bowl lightly breaded shrimp scallop calamari  hungry! <EOR> Service average while most Japanese inspired restaurants much friendlier inviting  ordered carbonara creamy mushroom udons while texture noodles alright would say tad over cooked soups note pretty bland tasted straight cream which old 3rd bite  <EOR> Marugame Monzo without any doubt most beautiful udon life!   Come strong L A highly known creative take Japanese udon  restaurant itself located ever crowded but fascinating Chinatown F B complex easy spot thanks giant signage but getting parking plaza definitely chore! Once inside noticed interior just L A  Simple much going decor details mainly major use cream dark colors but somehow simplicity appeals altogether creates such warm cozy ambiance  Unlike location L A queue actually much friendlier barely waited over 15 mins weekend lunch!   We came two days rows ordered * Takoyaki taste pretty generic hence best ever but nevertheless still enjoyable slightly crispy outer layer melty texture inside  quite generous octopus bits well    * Miso Carbonara If you're fan carbonara sauce you're gonna love creamy sauce dish  Perfectly executed overpowering udon did all talking here  Chewy fresh topped bacon Miso Carbonara beautiful bowl udon    * Sea Urchin Udon Now HEAVEN  creamy hearty suitable those favors subtle uni taste  if fancy bolder Uni taste your dish give option double uni extra $5  Winning! most stunning bowl noodle swear starred couple hunger induced daydreams P   Marugame Monzo certainly disappointing any way homiest space beautiful food supported friendly service  unquestionably most memorable best meals Las Vegas!
