I would rather again todai buffet  <EOR> On trip Vegas ate Bacchanal first night   mistake should Makino Buffet   Absolutely best buffet ever eaten    My favorites Shrimp tempura ramen   Half price Bacchanal    My wife son mother Japanese loved buffet  <EOR> In 2011 invited business lunch first time blown away selection   wanting look pig chose seconds oh        though wanted to    immediately took girlfriend soon enjoyed large variety did she   Everything chose fresh tasty   long another opportunity another business lunch again impressed quality quantity food   subsequently enjoyed lunch multiple times never disappointed food selection   I'd 5 stars but servers times haven't entirely attentive refilling water glass   Since live Henderson necessarily closest place sushi but truly worth drive   taken other family members made destination choice town relatives   salivating right now  <EOR> Buffets just fun  must stop when Vegas but don't mind visiting casual lunch  sushi would expect AYCE  similar sushi grocery store Sushi Boy  Makino offers all standard fare assortment usual rolls nigiri pieces rice udon salad bar chicken beef fish mushrooms mixed vegetables little square pieces cake cookies cream puffs  chocolate fountain surrounded all kinds fruits waiting skewered drowned chocolate waterfall there's little ice cream station offers regular sugar cones several different ice cream flavors  putting cream puffs through chocolate fountain then adding them bowl ice cream  <EOR> The Japanese buffet located inside las vegas outlets definitely good bargain   came lunch upon arriving Vegas starving big appetite   immediately straight sushi bar   large selection rolls most filled crab meat eel avocado spicy tuna   rolls pretty good but felt 20 different varieties rolls only used 5 different ingredients plus mixture various sauces   didn't imitation crab meat used rolls just tasted fake Americanized wish would use real crab meat   sushi selection raw fish limited scallop sushi fresh tasted excellent salmon also pretty good eel sushi wasn't bad   However rest sushi wasn't spectacular only 10 different varieties sushi which tad disappointing   Nonetheless enjoyed sushi rice used rolls sushi   lot mean lot all you can eat sushi places lik Todai example serve crappy mushy rice   which sushi just taste awful!  Makino use pretty good quality sushi rice quite surprised just sushi taste much better!   shrimp vegetable tempura wasn't bad also Udon noodles which tasted pretty good   didn't whole lot hot entrees tried beef sukiyaki which okay friend chicken wasn't bad   surprised didn't see beef teriyaki only chicken teriyaki   Maybe serve dinner    wasnt all impressed hot entrees just wasn't whole lot variety food tasted ok better most ayce buffets   dessert bar disappointing most dessert just didn't appeal didn't taste good!  Even ice cream disappointing could wrong green tea ice cream!?  Well think own ice cream ice cream just bland no green tea flavor all very disappointing   decent amount fresh fruit selections which liked most where sweet!  also chocolate fountain where dip your strawberries other fruits in   great idea bad execution!  chocolate tad watery didn't solidify even letting settle 5 minutes      Overall place bargain all you can eat Japanese buffet lunch price $17 weekends but careful because drinks cost extra!  $2 drinks   which found odd since most buffets offer free beverage    if don't intend drinking beverage opt water fill your stomach extra food!  sushi selection could better but use fresh ingredients rice excellent! hot entrees could better tempura probably best thing   would liked more variety   dessert bar disappointing but large variety sweet fruits   think back dinner next time but lunch definitely deal! <EOR> Makino good selection sea food pre made sushi  The sushi many choice just regular tuna salmon uni toro etc but custom sushi  many seafood dishes Clams mussells Fish crab leg shrimp etc  also other hot foods chicken beef baked seafood Gyoza grilled salmon more  Always lots choose plenty eat  Busy but bad    Make sure come hungry     <EOR> Just lunch sure writing review because am certified food coma right now  place buffet version AYCE Sushi down miso soup station edamame seaweed salad dessert but better because no limits anything including time     started fresh sushi station where sushi chefs making sushi right front while choose your pieces then moved way all way down hot food section  hot food section nothing special really  sushi come for  Also TIP DAY Try iced green tea!!!

Everything fresh      <EOR> Every time come Vegas stop dinner   multiple times   only Japanese buffet Massachusetts Minado which horribly overpriced overcrowded fobbies know nothing buffet etiquette     Unlike Minado Makino always pleasurable experience   never crowded probably because located Premium Outlets ways away strip    food GREAT   huge selection sushi decent selection cooked foods well   desert selection very good which includes chocolate fountain   also big selection choose salads other cold foods   Don't forget raw oysters   Plenty them around no worries fobbies lining snag whole plate full them once     Over years Minado increasing price e g  weekend price now $31 but Makino kept price well below $30 mere $25     Customer service good most times when grab new plate food your old plate taken away promptly plenty parking garage nearby     This place really enjoyable place eat   hard give anyone 5 stars but place really deserves it <EOR> 3 1 2 stars more precise   I've reviewed other Makino down Decatur back day when place really great opinion   gonna keep little short   Wow Makino happened lately?  used place some decent AYCE sushi   mean still decent but main goal?  decent?  No plans exceed expectations?  Come Mr  Makino   I even saw restaurant day ate there!  kids awe!  Mainly because thought gonna break knife pose any second!  Gotta thank those commercials ran few years back   Makino!  I enjoy other sushi places around town but Makino easy layout cool sushi hot dishes   Your sushi section A OK good day but please back off many things looking darn 'California Roll'?  More sashimi please!  sometimes quality bit meh   sometimes sushi looks sits bit long   things easily fixed though if Makino bit more vigilant maintaining quality standards     Little secret Makino also ask sushi chef duty hand roll!  hardly ever put them line but ask chef should happy one   But alas pickings slim   only able California hand roll hmpf really?  OMG spicy tuna hand roll veggie roll   Ask simple salmon roll Sorry salmon only sushi response   Figures!  Expand hand rolls somehow sounds funny would some happy campers back your establishment   I rather enjoy hot foods selection most times though   noodles good love when teriyaki steak line new tray fresh!    But love love love when Makino sukiyaki eat!  Oh man special treat!  love some sukiyaki!  4 bowls stuff side sushi am happy man   Needless say little disappointed when no sukiyaki chow line   Why Makino why did install those lame miso soup machine stations!  whack!  pisses off when see machine Rio buffet still pisses off when see your establishment   hard miso soup??  feel am 7 11 making myself cup hot chocolate!  rid machine please bring back large pot when open lid minor steam burn   Desserts bit bland side might need some updating there   enjoy cute little bite sized portions though leaves lot room try everything   chocolate fountain?  Getting bit cliche don't think?  If see more kid pretending finger marshmallow pineapple chunk   I'm gonna scream!  Which why normally proceed settle scoop red bean green tea ice cream   Seems Makino now serves ton folks charter tours lots Chinese folks coming through daily lunch then spending money multiple Coach bags taking advantage weakened dollar   Guess restaurant's gotta restaurants gotta stay alive   Thankfully servers Makino quick polite keep your drink filled clear your plates fashionable manner   guess expect turnover!  Mr  Makino please turn your restaurant baby back higher end sushi dining!  Although graciously continue back your decently priced $16 lunch until then   all! <EOR> Ahhhh  Makinos     first initial favorite sushi buffet! bad vegas otherwise I'd once week! I know real sushi fanatics don't believe sushi buffets but huge fusion sushi fan myself Makino's heaven   First all price lunch $14 Dinner run 20   think weekend pricing  $17 $25 respectively   Sushi selection    everything would want   Various types California roll mixes simple nigiri sushi other tasty variations fusion sushi indulge all want long stuff it!  can't tell favorite roll because sushi chefs gets creative all time everytime always something different!    For those non sushi fans also very nice hot dishes   tasty selections includes traditional shrimp vegetable tempuras fried oysters steamed white fish white wine clams BBQ riblets Fried rice Yakisoba   All very tasty!  definitely feel left if into raw fish deal   The dessert section ok    all cakes sweets taste generic as if taken box trader joes something but bomb red bean ice cream which always some restaurant cone well   But ask that only problem because self serve Lastly those craves sweets chocolate fountain literally dip anything into If believe spider roll covered dark rich chocolate   guess right ahead      But definitely dip much your heart desires! location rating in  LV outlets off strip location Decatur taste comparable   Therefore should disappointed   However just remember buffet those hard core sushi fanatics please leave mindset having top notch fresh sushi would $200 night sushi restaurant mentality home won't disappointed but just enjoy much paying such tasty creations drawn Mr  Makino  <EOR> Today tried place first time  Busy Premium Outlet Mall enthusiastic shoppers traffic road   hungry husband I  honest very skeptical place first  knew close strip definitely didn't want eat food court  debating lunch husband noticed Makino    Lunch 15 95 adults 7 45 Children Dinner 24 95              11 95  Drinks included    They nice variety sushi relatively good quality  also different Japanese salads bar items such some exotic mushrooms seaweed salad etc  plus hot food buffet desert buffet  chocolate fountain definitely highlight  <EOR> This place less dirty gross looking counter part Decauter   also lot bigger easier around   Liked chocolate fountain dessert seemed freshly made   good location outlet mall pretty close parking garage   can't say much rest food eating seafood sushi   No teriyaki beef but did fried chicken which thought odd seafood place but pretty tasty   would maybe return but if choice I'd stick chinese place food court  <EOR> I've better  come Bay Area where Asian buffets come dime dozen  BF raved place being sushi lover course try it! We lunch doing some shopping seated very quickly  Selection wasn't good hoped didn't signs listing kind sushi eating dark  beef terriyaki good ended eating mostly that  So why 2 stars? Why 3? Because stomach happy ALL hour left  <EOR> The entire place big  dining area bit cramp though  Some tables little close together may bump into tables way back buffet   Service quick  Every time table plate gone when came by  drinks full every time empty   DO EAT SASHIMI  fish isn't high enough grade enjoy itself  salmon tuna actually tough instead metling your mouth  LOOKED good though but guess looks deceiving  rice isn't really good sometimes sitting long bit hard  Overall sushi alright  few AYCE sushi place lower end  think Todai better   The udon noodles good soup bit weak though  tasted water down   The desserts sadly lacking  flan hard not soft creamy all fruits weren't sweet    That being said place 17 bucks weekend   pretty cheap anyway wouldn't way but if you're near outlets feel sushi OK place go  <EOR> What say   bad price   still buffet don't expect better going authentic place ordering Omakase chefs choice    But $30 definitely some great sushi even better price   If rolls variety then place go   even green tea ice cream shaved ice! <EOR> Get off Strip people! Vegas just long stretch road unlike most people think  sin city gone domestic toned down  Suburban living popping mushroom during rainy season except desert   Fine dining no longer strictly located Strip          Well ok Makino isn't exactly would call 'fine dining' but good! matter fact if looking good eats should venture locals   This Makino conveniently located within shopping complex Premium Outlet yes girlfriends  garden heaven! eat then work food walking shopping  other way around whichever   Anyway oh yes almost forgot food   This buffet Japanese seafood style  Plenty selection sushi sashimi seafood salad etc  Selection extends hot food some non seafood hot food  miso soup Udon  All self serve   Good election desert even Chocolate Fountain!!!!  Quality decent  price pay seafood buffet I'd say place beats those pricey ones inside casinos  $22 dinner large variety satisfy your cravings full  Typical Seafood buffet casinos $45+  mostly only serve shrimp cocktail crab legs  Sushi selection minimal best   <EOR> A decent Asian buffet huge selection  <EOR> My friends mood some cheap sushi  and since 5 guy friends surprised chose all you can eat place   per profile LOVE AYCE sushi   However Makino doesn't quite satisfy AYCE sushi lover   sushi rolls weren't good  tasted bit odd   rice seemed tough quality fish wasn't top standard   restaurant good size those dining groups but really would miss restaurant   even though other AYCE sushi places bit more pricey I'd rather pay bit more satisfy tastebuds well no risk own health  <EOR> Food selection good but sushi did taste anywhere near fresh   okay but still disappointing pay   biggest gripe place most hot food items even hot even warm   restaurant half empty you're going freshly cooked food low turnover   lot items sitting while   brought guests really disappointed quality   Would return recommend   Probably better strip buffets  <EOR> I would sad Takeru Kobayashi found place   Who knew desert would good sushi?

Dessert wise green tea red bean ice cream good sweet smooth  sesame crisps crushed strawberries sliced top off better  chocolate fondue which rather kitsch dip your own fruits marshmallows in  its just glorified chocolate syrup fountain looks cool though wasn't tasty  took bites random cakes all just meh didn't eat it   Service okay  water filled once told them new didn't drink  plates stacking towards end though     For Sunday lunch $18 95 its probably more affordable Todai similar concept but compared AYCE sushi joint doesn't job me  wouldn't eating if wasn't family being Filipino love buffet being convenient day outlet  don't really see any other time would come back either  Yelp 100 Challenge 27 100 <EOR> I quite disappointed when visited place during Christmas visit Las Vegas last year   While love Japanese food quality Makino really faltered since last dining experience   Firstly sashimi improperly sliced   Sashimi grade ahi pre frozen should cut into cubes   Sashimi needs sliced certain way properly enjoy raw fish   Trust properly sliced ahi feels texturally better mouth even tastes better   The entrees weren't all great either   Much new all some sitting while   Oh chocolate fountain all but nothing cover chocolate   Maybe supposed put your mouth under drink?  lol  <EOR> A couple friends visiting wanted here  first ever visit Makinos  waited door few minutes since just before opened dinner  place seemed nice open clean  all eat buffet emphasis sushi japanese style dishes  Waitress good keeping drinks filled plates cleared  did wonder if food nice fresh since dined right start dinner later  selection decent  thought bit smaller side but could spoiled larger spreads casino buffets  If you're fan sushi japanese items would good place try  liked it  whether I'd prefer AYCE made to order sushi restaurant  would probably still lean towards made to order  dinner least prices similar  did notice lunch price cheaper  sure if selection same lunch dinner  maybe try lunch day  <EOR> I hoping all negative reviews false because still wanted try place  came today lunch price 16 bucks drinks 2 50 two people came few bucks shy 40 dollars  excluding tips    I tried every rolls which didn't names titled them all tasted little sub par lot places to  just didn't taste fresh popped once entering mouth  doesn't happen often where feel little let down food    I order tea also way all give pack tea hot water  just norm now? Most places serve tea ready drink   all wait cool down    I also katsu pork which tasted old no crunch left life !! sad die without honor !!   It felt little dirty when see imitation crab meat mixed cucumbers   unless  intended do  Correct if wrong but shouldn't veggies stay isolated themselves  Eeek !!   Other then that   waitress mark did great job !!   I don't think back unless something changes   only time tell !!

FOOD QUALITY The rolls sushi itself overall pretty high quality maybe best could offer but good enough enjoy without fail  Aside did also enjoy other dishes Beef Teriyaki Sukiyaki Beef good but    buffet quality good  Sea Bass very good though   One area felt place lacked dessert  felt only ice creams great  oh! would bet chocolate fountain stuffed silly already    SERVICE Service apt kind  Took away dishes whenever saw finished empty plate refilled drinks without asking    ENVIRONMENT It's pretty much open floor however kind felt crammed since tables somewhat put close together  Overall pretty clean tidy relaxing  I'd really come back again! Thank goodness Irvine CA now though  <EOR> I can't really expound any better anyone else but   WOW!  place rules   Hot food good but only 2 3 bites because sushi VERY GOOD   Better some so called high end sushi joints where from   powered down enough tuna salmon unagi veggie rolls easily $15 95 lunch cost   Good cookies dessert service fast pleasant  <EOR> AYCE SUSHI!! pops head That light bulb head shined bright when heard heading AYCE sushi place + more     This restaurant located outdoor shopping mall outlet Vegas made yearn sushi saw sushi display  other sections such soup section miso soup etc hot foods mussels noodles etc but all cared besides dessert just  sushi   Everything looked good but weren't any labels exactly each sushi was  Luckily eye sushi being LOVE sushi able distinguish each roll had  Everything looked fresh   thought    As sat down devoured well tried devour each roll  couldn't eat everything each piece sushi because geez MUCH RICE  C'mon people where fish?I didn't pay rice! literally pile rice chunks plate just didn't full off rice  need room other things dessert!
