Tough prepared way prime rib should be  Iowa boy trust know good beef!! This place doesn't clue prepare prime rib  <EOR> The bread really good!     but came paper bag   herbed butter tasty too    huge group billing very confusing when paid     Be aware   they charge drink then each individual shot pour your drink!   friend's martini came $21!    outrageous!   I ahi tuna cooked rare but would better seared   husband filet hs said very good   mac cheese good but under seasoned   Overall paid much got     Our cab driver told Del Frisco better steak house  <EOR> Hmmm   may eaten off night because filet mignon only noteworthy its averageness  Same salmon  did eat Mystere Dinner Package maybe chefs package patron plates assembly line  ?  Also hostess failed mention needed vouchers dinner package  we'd seated waiter says can't order until waited 15 minutes line to pick tickets Mystere booth  Meanwhile date sitting herself no mediocre appetizer nibble on  hostess should've known better   The food decent but much better more downscale joints  Good thing Mystere made unspectacular taste Steakhouse left mouth  <EOR> Ummm   that's steak!!  Located Treasure Island Hotel Casino  facility nice service decent glass water never saw half full   ordered surf turf lobster tail filet mignon   Now Dallas fair share amazing steaks Nick Sams $35 oz Wagyu Kobe prefecture Japan friend wasn't them  First off asked medium rare definitely charred medium  Second   did just completely miss seasoning?

First all décor typical Las Vegas style    When received stale bread in paper bag thought leaving but afraid would miss show if switched restaurants  French onion soup average steak lobster both over cooked  could even put type quality food table beyond me  outraged expected pay $48 chewy lobster well I mean well done filet mignon  tried best big deal I didn't want upset boyfriend but finally couldn't take told horrible was  thought he going flip when he tried food  complained manager atrocious meal said could only take off $23 I guess because tried choke down most lobster   if see place run far fast can  Don't waste your good money average meal two over $100 food   If knew knew now would chosen McDonalds over place  <EOR> Staying TI really GREAT deal  hotel casino central LV Strip hotel clean prices reasonable cafe table  figured I'd give Steak House try being everything else positive overall   The restaurant simple clean  walk bar front always good thing if wait table early want cocktail quench your thirst  wait staff friendly  Then came food  Everything downhill there  First off wanted oysters  only did selection oysters NO OYSTERS  steakhouse without Oysters?
