Nice atmosphere reasonable prices  Food just ok   not bad but probably won't hurry come back  Restaurant empty but check table before put down   wierd service  <EOR> Fine tourists but locals gotta china town stuff <EOR> Very tasty  just shrimp fried rice sauteed shrimp mixed vegetables  tea $5 per person which caught off guard but otherwise pleasant experience  Given located Mandalay Bay convenient hotel guests staying Delano well  Recommend place others nice lunch dinner  <EOR> The only reason 2 stars instead 1 bc extremely mediocre overpriced black bean chicken temporarily ruined appetite left more room Rio seafood buffet next day  Then again maybe subconsciously wanted pay lot eat blah food being LA did expect place catering mainly drunken tourists never authentic bb chicken compare real stuff LA? Also particularly upset discovered Burger Bar also Mandalay Bay right eating here  jonesing burger alllll night specifically mind set burger bar but forgot which hotel in  bright side skimpy little shreds chicken accompanied few bell peppers probably lot less caloric  <EOR> The wonton soup Noodle Shop just tummy needed indulging buffets along strip last couple days   broth hot flavorful helped soothed throat which grown weary inhaling smoke filled air casinos  long thin noodles lot fun eat very tasty   wontons good but don't think good other wontons had   offered generous portions which left comfortably full   However downside price  $13 lot bowl wonton soup!

We asked manager discuss total mis representation dish   Fish Balls count assorted seafood     He offered minor discount but should just comped entire dish   disgusted disturbed argue continue pointless conversation   Don't here   better options  <EOR> This solid 3 star restaurant judging only experience here   FOOD  ordered BBQ pork over rice beef chow fun  BBQ pork so so mostly because strong spice isn't most BBQ pork rice dishes consumed life I many even Hong Kong   Still edible all fine  beef chow fun same experience    Ok great pretty salty but still pretty edible   SERVICE  Good actually! checked fairly often see everything if needed anything else  No complaints  If anything only complaint table beside Chinese mainlanders kid watching iPad movie FULL BLAST  So  Annoyed    The restaurant itself well maintained  Felt clean updated etc  <EOR> This place extremely quiet when arrived  around 3pmish    so between lunch dinner rush  Even only few people server took forever take order  Which odd  She would just walking around  Finally different lady came over asked if wanted order    uh yeah! Dont wrong servers friendly  Just slow    Anyhow ordered sweet sour chicken hubby ordered fried rice shrimp chicken beef  much say  flavor bland  Nothing excited about  Mandalay Bay kind surprising restaurant would just so    Long story short somewhere else next time  <EOR> I'll give 2 stars because good alright but definitely worth price  Seriously? $30 standard plate noodles? also waitress no idea she doing when billing room took forever but before asking if going taking box leftovers my daughter couldn't finish all orange chicken which replied yes  She then ended taking food which roughly half plate threw away  worth price  <EOR> Would ever eat if wasn't comp comes stays?  Probably not   Food tastes okay but nothing tastes great prices charge   surely isn't Chinatown LA   Garlic shrimp chicken beef little sweeter would've liked   But nice serving portion two   shrimp wonton noodle soup more bland I'd but plenty noodles something 6 8 big wontons hey  definitely plus   calamari probably wouldn't again   Cooked long very chewy rubbery garlic salt pepper didn't really cling way does when order 'legit' restaurant   Service okay   drinks refilled nothing landed table cold but then again wrapping just started seating ocean people coming UFC 143 can't speak when they're busy    That food two sodas cost just little over $55 including tax tip bad 'hotel' food two but again without comp wouldn't eating here   wouldn't recommend place either   definitely take Dragon Noodle Co ?

Right? <EOR> Around Excalibur Luxor Mandalay Bay corridor your Asian food options quite limited  say Noodle Shop actually ok place even though paying 2x 3x more Asian cuisine  definitely paying convenience but definitely hits spot long night partying  roasted duck noodle soup preserved egg congee  roasted duck noodle soup pretty good although while notice heavy presence salt  tasted much salt tried tame salt bowl congee  congee wasn't good all  douse congee pepper taste better which disappointing  <EOR> Great food xo noodles terrific   duck very good   All soups great!! <EOR> I learned valuable lesson happens when don't yelp restaurant when traveling   Noodle Shop utter crap    Overpriced seriously mediocre   passed place looked  decent jam packed smiling Asian folks    thought good sign   but boy wrong    tried seaweed salad deep fried tofu seafood wonton soup roasted duck BBQ pork combo   BBQ pork decent but only four bites serving   Totally overpriced $18     ice teas $4 bucks course  you gave pay small side steamed rice    rice actually worth price tag but really f$*k rice     If need waste money torture you're taste buds then Noodle Shop disappoint    * gave place second star  because service good despite being packed     <EOR> One worst Chinese restaurants to  waiter recommends chicken chow mein saying full vegetables only find onions he referring vegetable  When asked he says additional vegetables going cost more!!    Chicken fried rice more white rice chicken  <EOR> If reading review sit restaurant wondering why everything awful  may wondering why experienced yelper myself would checking reviews already eating somewhere  First every other restaurant long wait  REALLY hungry hubby wasn't feeling well just wanted fed could head room  empty restaurant should sign but because much screw noodles? Reception always tough casinos didn't even try check reviews    I ordered Pad Thai husband ordered wonton soup  sure even even use words describe seriously awful Pad Thai was  If blind folded don't know would even know Pad Thai  guess would leftover noodles chafing dish 10 year reunion night before  flavor awful texture bizarre hungry could even myself choke down  husband's soup almost edible if avoided wonton  basically broth bland enough force down your throat pinch   I very rarely send food back but inedible expensive boot! kept trying flag server down finally 10+ minutes hostess said needed manager server  When server came over started explain why didn't it  He didn't seem surprised all just took away asked if wanted something else  decided subject myself anything else place  paid soup then headed over small souvenir shop hotel  grabbed bag pretzels called night  Those Rold Gold pretzels AMAZING slop we'd here   I don't think anything could eat again  Even if free! Even if hungry given option nothing think would choose nothing every time  AVOID ALL COSTS!!!!! Mandalay Bay should close place down open good noodle place  Noodles awesome when little much Vegas fun even if noodles just average think would very well! If saw picture tired place looks would even think would open inside Mandalay Bay  place needs go! <EOR> Really horrible Asian food Mandalay Bay right next casino   ate once didn't back  <EOR> I cannot life fathom such overpriced restaurant less mediocre food SLOW service succeeded Mandalay Bay  2 beers flavorless dim sum sampler 2 very fatty poor quality pork belly bao appetizer results $65 bill?
