But hue thai still good! love changes bread baked fresh everyday! <EOR> Overall experience wasn't all bad  service bit slow considering weren't busy all day but waiter very friendly didn't seem all rushed when taking order most asian places are  main reason giving place two stars due cashier  friends having fairly relaxed lunch then when came time pay cashier unwilling accommodations easier top side attitude  Honestly friends pretty easy going people just took bullshit left  no tip definitely planning going back  <EOR> This all time favorite vietnamese restaurant  sandwiches point menu items authentic  Some favorites ca kho pho tai bun rieu bo tai chanh  service always friendly very accommodating  Try bobas too! Amazing! <EOR> Crew very approachable food served really fast  Taste superb  Crew always ask else need  When ask charger he lend without hesitation  Great place spend your time enjoy pho  Only comment Thai tea milk tea boba  boba good other boba place  But overall good place try  <EOR> They best Yellow Curry Chicken French Bread! lower side calories which nice! <EOR> The food ok grilled pork sandwich which wasn't any other grilled pork expecting  just grilled ham  However terrible service say  wait remind waitress food ordered then wait again  manager very rude  coming back unless any other reason  <EOR> My friend craving something other fancy overpriced celebrity fine dining restaurants strip she yelp'd place just followed along  Located strip mall off main road Chinatown place bit hidden corner second floor but huge colorful signs steer right  heard place some good reviews sandwiches Pho   so looking forward good down earth simple lunch   It's pretty much typical basic casual Vietnamese restaurant    nothing fancy looking    sit down wait server come over take your order just wait food come out  there's counter takeaways    mostly Banh Mi sandwiches but most people saw dine ins   We wanted try both Banh Mi soup noodles ahead ordered Hu Tieu Ga flat rice noodle chicken broth House Special Banh Mi BBQ Chicken Banh Mi Banh Cuon Nhan Thit Pork mushroom flour roll      which never tried before  actually intended order regular pho noodles instead flat rice noodles but all good    enjoyed chicken soup very much    nice comforting flavor it    could've given bit more chicken meat though  beansprouts fresh     then noticed forgot give any fresh basil leaves  being just two servers cashier serving whole busy restaurant could tell well understaffed running around crazy trying attend all other tables      it took good 5 10 minutes attention let them know needed basil leaves   they finally did   The Banh Mi sandwiches   tasted good    the pickled vegetables quite sweet   however rather disappointed French roll bread  Every Banh Mi ever life nice light crisp crust but some strange reason very flat  BBQ chicken Banh Mi quite yummy though  friend enjoyed House Special Banh Mi looked couple different types sliced luncheon meat same pickled vegetables   The Pork Mushroom Flour Roll quite interesting     actually quite yummy but don't usually eat lot pork likely would ordered myself  friend said good   As previously mentioned they're very understaffed service very very slow    despite two servers running around chickens heads chopped off  When did around attending very nice friendly     and think would unfair harsh them this     they trying  Plus noticed sign cash register advertising help     likely even more understaffed kitchen took noodles half hour flour rolls even longer that      I think simply forgot flour rolls till friend asked it   Yea guess if you're hurry anywhere craving decent Vietnamese fast food then definitely ok place come your fill  Although slowest fast food I'd ever experienced  Yea would come back only if friends wanted come here    but would likely just order soup noodles  <EOR> This place located 2nd floor plaza quite hidden  very casual joint almost cafetaria style where order pay counter  came banh mi sandwiches before head hiking  okay average  bun itself didnt stand out  also ordered white rice noodle crepe assemble ourself  crepe itself very thick smooth  okay  <EOR> Mixed review trip   bahn mi good but bit pricey compared its competition   guests pho quickly but wait duck noodle soup   waited long almost done before mine arrived   Come service 101 deliver food together   only 2 other people place   No excuse bad service   More importantly duck noodle soup wasn't very good   duck tough  <EOR> My first bahn mi experience nothing compare against  bread awesome crunchy soft flavor grilled pork great but really stingy portion meat 3 99 Also viet iced coffee think its called French style   Yummy always bouncing off walls soon enough  But packed very top w ice which means lot coffee 2 99 So basically bahn mi fan now but likely won't back specific place again  keep hearing lees sandwich supposed best anyone know when its supposed actually open if its same LA? Oh its little scary shrimp spring rolls just sitting front cash register even ice  If think  safe wonder what's going kitchen  <EOR> i heard all rant rave yelp vietnamese friend dallas LOVES place over favorite pho saigon 8    but didnt think place all great    i love food its usual give 2 stars but    im giving place 2 stars    because kno where better places eat las vegas   yes place 2nd main chinatown mall if u around order convienience  Its inexpensive    i only banh mi which supposed known am impressed    i back day try some rice plates noodles  update if change mind!!! <EOR> My friends took here  guess place serves primarily Vietnamese food some Thai food  things place entire menu pictoral form discern actually eating   I mistakenly thought eating family style but actually ate own individual dishes  friend ordered appetizers cripsy fried egg rolls interesting gelatin things topped some orange stuff tiny dish  good when add fish sauce top it  also ordered Pho Tai  pretty good due its hearty beef broth  least give large glasses water  decor pretty interesting least drab many vietnamese restaurants   Overall place much better some typical Vietnamese places terms cleanliness   If compare Vietnamese restaurants probably better place eat due its cleaner environment  would say would rated place 3 5 stars   It would interesting if ever came back would curious try sandwiches  <EOR> Crazy crowded place gets weekends    prolly why lost order bit   comped two loaves house made bread   Yum   far viet food impressed variety entrees   Its just usual suspects menu   chicken salad banana blossoms   all impressed since same cabbage but few blossoms thrown in   nuoc mam weak   fiancee fried noodles seafood   Probably good gets restaurant   Other dishes tried hu tieu sp?   ABV again little lacking flavor   and broken rice pork egg quiche   think #51   that perfect   mother really cook lived Northern Virginia near Eden long time   so standards high   3 5 stars food extra 0 5 star variety   said silly craving some viet bread egg soy sauce   so returning pre flight meal   O forgot mention fiancee avocado smoothie said best he ever had  <EOR> I come vegas once year sure eat Hue Thai least once   In recent trip learned under new management   and could tell   For crowded usually was    Second order banh beo COLD forgot microwave it  Also banh beo order came multi sized plates banh beo  Some noticeably larger rest  Very strange  waitress even apologized mis sized plates   Will returning again? Probably not  take chances Cali instead  <EOR> Used tasty place gone downhill new owners  soups taste different  cooks no longer Vietnamese  lamb really goat meat  But saving grace place banh mi sandwiches   grilled pork sandwich much better Lee's  <EOR> Las Vegas' best kept secret!! best Vietnamese food hands down  Pho Dac Biet bun coun dac biet banh mi dac biet bo luc lac    all amazing!!! <EOR> I don't usually food but usually come drinks desserts  boba cheap pretty solid flavor    The food pretty good most part menu extensive  great prices wide variety options  Definitely room dessert place  <EOR> LOVE shredded pork sandwich! though everything else tried good other placed  would say specialty sandwiches those very tasty good pricing quick  <EOR>
