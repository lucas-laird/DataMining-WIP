Best Mexican seafood restaurant town hands down recommend all family friends <EOR> This sad! ordered cocktail husband ordered carne asada ordered two kids shrimp tostadas  place joke! If used eating really great mariscos don't come here  took 20 mins prepare cocktail still tastes bland ended taking home prepare it! shrimp tostadas AGAIN! No flavor! Disgusting! serve food under seasoned beyond me! husbands carne Assad good but come anyone season carne asada  never going back  stick other places! Save your money time going here  disappointing  If open restaurant things would eat it  where basically seasoning everything because lacks much flavor! <EOR> Esta locación de Las Islitas es mi preferida el lugar es relativamente nuevo y muy limpio  Tienen un extenso menú de mariscos al igual que opciones de carne  La mojarra frita y la campechana son mis favoritos  Las empanadas de camarón no se pueden olvidar riquísimas! <EOR> Si recomiendo este lugar!
