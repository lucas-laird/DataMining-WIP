I ended ordering pho chin well done beef slices which actually pretty good compared restaurants Eastern some places Chinatown  broth good amount flavor reminded taste thought could only Vietnamese restaurants back home  usually don't full eating bowl pho but place gives good amount keep satisfied while  also spring rolls which good but don't think worth price  paid $5 6 4 pieces which looked 2 pieces just cut half lol  also ordered fried rice which alright  nothing special probably won't order again if come back    The restaurant relatively clean which good because Asian places known clean should be  staff nice which plus book  I'd recommend going over places Pho 1 Pho Kim Long Lemongrass if craving some authentic tasting pho  would more often if closer me! <EOR> I eaten many times   employees over really give absolutely superb service every time   happily answer any questions always super nice   talking owner he heck guy also   continue going there <EOR> Their pho good but since many different places pho tell difference theirs  ordered pho tai usual friend ordered same thing but tripe  noticed broth little thicker much thicker but definitely notice it  biggest thing threw off oily is! oily aftertaste just different  didn't all but meat good just overall ok   I'd other places pho if craving though  place I'd want come back to! <EOR> If want traditional food your spot  ordered spicy curry chicken which soup form all bone  didn't try fried rice pho  steam rice cooked fresh since clumpy  didn't want water but kept filling half glass gave  Three people checked see  if food ok  floating chicken skin pieces bowl maybe taste  Nothing seemed healthy special place other service  didn't realize curry chicken came soup format stomach still bubbling  <EOR> I actually come back few times since convenient  pho really pretty good  still looking best Vegas any pointers would great  <EOR> Best pho broth Las Vegas NV hands down  fried chicken delicious! Just wish more pho condiments peanuts sugar hotter hot oil  All all 2 thumbs up  <EOR> I use come least once week  But recently changed owners think old owner took all staff her  Food isn't same very disappoint  broth chicken pho lacks flavor  <EOR> Very good pho very nice service    Dropped grab order pho spring rolls go  pho order large nicely packaged great flavor  nice man phone stated would take 15 minutes order but arrived early ready wait but food ready go    The spring rolls good though did wish more ingredients carrots mix but still good    I also ordered beef stew lunch next day very good  Filled tons beef deliciously stewed carrots   Definitely good pho place side town  I'd back any day  <EOR> This little way but say favorite place some really good pho  broth really tasty without adding any sauces it  atmosphere cleaner then most pho places ever lady owns place sure knows treat customer right  two young kids she would never charge extra little more pho side  <EOR> Been coming long time but don't think return  Mainly only dine due proximity home  Quick easy to  When first started dining service great food pretty decent  Annie owner gives great service constantly smiles courteous gracious  She remembers family where prefer sit whenever dine in  Although some positive experiences also just many negative ones  several occasions when order take often confusion problems order  and only order 2 things! blame mainly guy takes order  don't know name but guess way he dressed tasks he handles he related owner Annie  don't know if he's brother husband but he's mainly seating waiting customers other Annie  guy awful  Messed order several times  simple things no onions Pho extra sauce chapsticks  wrong amount provided phone bill arriving pickup takeout order being acknowledged last time stood almost 10 mins before approached he looked right 4 times!!!  MISSING food had drive all way back one! called ordered told order would ready 10 mins ended waiting close half hour dude didn't put order until there!!!! WTF???!! just sucks because really want place given many chances but mainly because guy screws everything it's ALWAYS same guy screws things choose no longer dine there   dude doesn't even say thank you  and considered myself regulars! There's just many other Pho places town offer better service without all mistakes    Food pretty decent said but negated fact service sucks bad when isn't owner lose focus your eating end thinking shitty service is    Regardless good food when last memory your dining experience bad service pretty pointless  come expect crap fast food joints BK McD's but place especially considering TONS Pho places Vegas offer comparable food BETTER service    Save yourself buyers remorse look better options  Service inconsistent  best  and down right shitty worst   Note Annie if you're reading think personally quite nice enjoy your service but guy works rid him   your business slowly dry because people this  If fire don't let serve customers   let clean your toilets mop floors take trash   you don't want someone represent your establishment considering service provide personally actually decent  Maybe if he's gone would actually return! <EOR> FINALLY! found place where truly enjoy nice bowl pho! If know anything pho searching journey Vegas you'd know pretty disappointed every experience Vietnamese restaurant thus far  But eureka! Pho Annie does me    First off need cover location because easy find  Complex rather odd  almost complex curves toward street Pho Annie tucked inside hidden street view   Just look Chee Burger Chee Burger same complex   Restaurant isn't large 5 6 booths left 3 4 tables right  First visit during lunch packed fast  Second visit Sunday night much slower  order Annie Special pho includes all meat additions tripe fatty brisket tendon meat balls flank   Houston given option small bowls large bowls pho would definitely considered large bowl  bowl costs around $7  order egg rolls appetizer they're great  comes 4 large egg rolls  Keep mind pho doesn't take long prepare all your main course most likely follow app within 5 10 minutes    It's really hard describe taste broth  All really say truly enjoyed it  perfect amount flavor actually sipped ate everything else    And if pho isn't your thing wide selection other dishes  Can't much detail ya cause didn't pay close attention   sorry!  My favorite pho place far! only downfall spend minimum $10 use your credit card  <EOR> I've eaten several occasions each time receiving great service  staff fairly quick seated  never wait more 15+ min orders  always recommend #12 all meat lovers there  combo all meats one! more ask for? Overall staff quick feet friendly provide quality food  <EOR> The best pho town!!!! Especially southwest side when know filled Vietnamese people good  No need drive china town authentic Vietnamese food  service excellent fast plus reasonable prices  lot pho places town Houston Cambodia Vietnam place good  <EOR> Pho Annie only few minutes driving home try it  ordered #65 bbq pork duck soup really good but side soup broth green onions tasted funny   Sweet creamy? first time trying duck pretty good much fat   bbq pork tasty  Next time try pho  also soda chanh but called lemon soda tasted lemonade  Overall nice staff coming back <EOR> Pho Annie delish!!! still love pho Kim long but pretty far house   always veggie pho bf gets rare beef  tried few different apps dishes liked them all spring rolls egg rolls calamari chicken wings combo fried rice  only dish wasn't huge fan crispy noodles seafood didn't love noodles wasn't much seafood mix   regardless pho solid service outstanding! <EOR> My recent experience inspired finally years using yelp start writing reviews!   Don't wrong food pretty good cheap! But service received HORRIBLE! always takeout no problem but friend stopped eat lunch awe experience   We food quick good always but quickly full pretty full plates  asked boxes kid waited 20 minutes boxes!

It's time write review place  live right down street you'll find dinner if lazy drive cook myself  location great but masses huge disadvantage  located south side town 20 minutes away Chinatown which where most people seek Vietnamese any type Asian food go  also hidden complex where storefront cannot seen street   When comes Vietnamese food am quite spoiled  grew grandma's homemade Pho most Pho restaurants Vegas don't even compare  Pho Annie though   hits spot! Satiates craving    When order bowl Pho perfect without having add any condiments available  Hoisin sriracha should dipping sauce meat flavor diluted bowl broth some places try serve  course everyone preferences but regardless foundation dish substance begin with    Their broth perfectly balanced   very hearty full flavor but salty unlike many other restaurants serve diluted broth broth tastes MSG  noodles aren't soggy undercooked vegetables fresh  Everything just comes together    Service could better but Vietnamese restaurants notorious awkward service  servers look eye when talking taking your order  most likely won't checking you  HOWEVER   you your food within 5 10 minutes   which nice    If you're looking authentic Vietnamese food seek Pho Annie!! <EOR> O  M  G  eff happened?  go to spot  traveling over last 3 years   The place used packed now empty    The pho BLAND used full flavor    The spring rolls basic    Left over lettuce old shrimp    The upbeat energetic friendly staff now replaced people tolerate you   wasn't hostile but      different   I wanted leave   energy gone    Very disappointing  <EOR> I usually Jenni Pho pho fix but wanted try place since block closer house Jenni Pho lol   Friendly staff very clean fast service  only order type pho anywhere rare steak pho  Broth really good felt pretty good selection food  definitely coming back <EOR> This place pretty good  Viet coffee drink bun bo hue  good but think pho better  drooped looking friends d eat haha but place really good  noodle dish pretty authentic amazing  <EOR> Pros few Vietnamese restaurants located Southwest  convenient area  Pho delicious  Few places broth right great job flavors  Fried chicken wings  chicken crispy outside juicy inside  Again great flavors   Cons service okay  bit slow side seem disorganized  best looking  There's duct tape holding booths together entirely clean  Questionable things  iced coffee ca phe sua da pre made poured into plastic cup unlike traditional hot coffee french drip self poured over condensed milk ice  believe save time but takes away experience taste coffee   Stars good food but wasn't truly fan service appearance  really more 2 1 2 star rating me  <EOR> Good food very affordable big servings wow! near place to  Check won't disappointed  <EOR> The bun best town veggies fresh! eggrolls also delicious  <EOR> First time California  And man broth bomb!!! I ordered seafood pho delicious ! Service amazing well Thank constant water fill ups! <EOR> We've Pho Annie several times every time visit Vegas   pho soup always good  Egg rolls Vietnamese rolls best  would given them 5 star but find servers friendly called all time refill drinks bill  They're busy day all  <EOR> Not bad option those pho cravings all time time  better bowls since moving Vegas  little way but Henderson lacks good Vietnamese places  would prefer Pho Annie most Chinatown Vietnamese restaurants well!   The service efficient  made sure waters consistently filled up  came large group offered ring separately cashier instead having trying figure split check 9 ways  love when places offer this  Brownie points them!  I standard Pho Tai rare sliced beef wasn't disappointed  broth good noodles passable book  rice dishes vermicelli options also looked promising next visit  <EOR> I live southwest side town driving Chinatown isn't always practical even though  where most best pho places are   I tried few pho places southwest area just weren't good   I decided stop try Pho Aimie first time glad did    The food hot good plentiful cooked just right really enjoyed meal appetizer   Patrick server awesome really top things even though lot tables sat   I look forward coming back very good restaurant should happy if come here  <EOR> So whilst traveling Pho circuit chinatown eatery which close house surprise   Pho decent but star Bun Bo Hue spicy noodle soup    Better most others sampled Vegas rice plates good too   service fine waited Annie herself alot haven't seen other guy     but then again used service asian joints am bit more forgiving     pinch spot works but give Bun Bo Hue try   and don't let pork blood squares pig's feet pieces scare just try it     there's worst scarier things could eat        Ciao!  C <EOR> Small but packs big punch  such good local neighborhood spot its just delicious more popular Pho Kim Long but service way better  pricey most dishes $6 $9 range portions huge your gut ready! <EOR> The food flavorful balanced  Every bite took roller coaster through taste pallet  Pho broth flavorful but mild enough wasn't over powering  lemon grass chicken which definitely recommend  service great especially Patrick! <EOR> Love restaurant!
