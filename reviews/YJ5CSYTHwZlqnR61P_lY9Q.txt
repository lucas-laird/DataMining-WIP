Also horchata perfect     sweet watery  also fallen love chicken burrito  sounds could plain but chicken shredded juicy also having tons onions peppers leaves heaven  Also fan good ol' bean cheese burrito beef taquitos   The prices very fair even though raised month ago  believe beef tacos $3 05 before now $3 35  huge change would much rather raise prices bit decrease portion sizes  only real beef far burrito sizes vary  Sometimes very generous sometimes never know exactly much you'll get   Also note Roberto's serves menudo bone  love menudo but hate eating off bone once heard some unknowing customer complain them she eating menudo almost chipped tooth bone  She acted douche so     if don't know now know! <EOR> This place great late night grub  close authentic taco shop  lot around town always find somewhere near you  <EOR> I can't speak other roberto's taco ships but very consistent  never failed please quick cheap Mexican food  Portions plentiful even tacos well filled  Carne asada fries to!

<EOR> What expect robertos  good service good food  <EOR> I've Roberto's 4 times first time location last which sucks because close house    beside point customer service which expecting four seasons but least normal common human decency beyond horrible girl didn't name but she pretty blue eyes    masked horrible personality didn't even look when walked looking menu waiting acknowledge then when she continued talking staff over 5 minutes which feels forever when you're doing nothing but waiting someone take your order  ordered little sides bar cucumbers sauces staff back yelled something really couldn't hear asked if he talking both said Spanish thinking didn't know she saying idiot deaf let's say would usually throw off edge but let because good mood then when order drink ordered wasn't filled she asked more forcefully irritated fact said want ice said yes knowing location put your own ice then fill your drink the specialty drinks horchata     idk but never done restaurant before didn't know way operated rude stare acting deaf idiot really wasn't helping either  put own ice handed cup she filled drink then slapped down looked she going top drink then couldn't find guess helped next guest without saying word stood unsure if she ever going top drink which she didn't knowing obviously idiot idk possibly confused lack service she could pointed direction lid least said here's your drink b*tch fact if she would said here's your drink b*tch I'd probably more satisfied complete ignorance act irritation being there  left very confused pissed assaulted  good mood ruin thanks Roberto's and yes directly blame Roberto's because many reviews complaining obviously she's still   I'd call speak manager however reading other reviews sure won't any good  Very disappointed    Ps carne asada no flavor chewy work it  <EOR> We quite bit due convenience  think quality's gone down bit since first opened  food's decent but nothing really stand service mediocre but they're fairly quick close house   The California burrito served other locations includes sour cream guac though charge extra  <EOR> Really good breakfast burritos! also menudo which ok  all meat no corn which kind disappointing but would defiantly other food items <EOR> Great place   Carnes asada nachos favorite but recently branched try variety tacos burritos pretty much everything good   Burritos huge!  lengua really good   Rolled tacos great snack daughter loves them    burritos little pricey time u add sour cream other items optional   But consistently good food <EOR> The girlfriend least once week  only California Burrito cannot recommend enough  Friendly staff they know order when walk in great burritos  <EOR> I come probably twice month  Always order carne asada burrito 3 rolled tacos  very consistent food service great  Sometimes might wait 5 10 minutes your food depending busy but its expected  carne asada nachos hit miss which why stick burrito rolled tacos  If looking quick lunch dinner crave Mexican food    here  <EOR> Ordered beef taco combo burrito combo  taco greasy appealing  didn't even attempt eat other one  Halfway through boyfriend's burrito he found wooden stick inside  cool  Overall bad experience Roberto's  Don't think come back anytime soon  <EOR> The food always good chain  customer service could better but still came back years because great prices great food  could maybe hire someone little more personality cashier  No matter which location all same  <EOR> I love Roberto's   mainly because being bartender off two morning place always open ] <EOR> Love location  breakfast burritos bomb well Carne asada fries  They're also open 24 hours  <EOR> Worst f*cking Roberto's ever too  nothing but bunch unprofessional unhappy workers don't speak English  Food tastes crap  real Mexican  forget orders  $1 chicken tacos Wednesday rushed taste sh*t  I'd give zero stars if could <EOR> A very good fast place eat  even call your order pick up  recommend California Burrito guacamole bean cheese chips  both extremely good  <EOR> I craving Mexican food ordered taco salad carnitas yummy bean cheese burrito    I know fatty lol  refried beans  craving mexican food come inexpensive good <EOR> I hungover wanted something soak liquor    beef wet burrito ummmmh ummmh ummmh great choice    stopping spot next time come Vegas for sure     <EOR>
