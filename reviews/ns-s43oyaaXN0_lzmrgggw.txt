Bagatelle located across street MGM adjacent Tropicana   great location?  Absolutely  Parking adjacent beach club without walking across entire casino floor bikini? Good idea  Dedicated entry Valet rather hotel entry trek venue? Good idea  Worz made clear thought part design   Mind design beyond egress  two DJ booths pool? main booth large noticeably elevated LEDs  sand beach volleyball? Yes sand beach volleyball  seem recall last Beach Club open town doesn't actually sand   strange  Worz also reminded design continuity St  Barth's admired mosaic Audrey Hepburn  space features seating 500 guests its indoor outdoor venue including two private dining rooms private outdoor dining pavilion  beach includes 250 seat outdoor restaurant beach volleyball 18 luxury cabanas plus outdoor concert venue capacity more 3 000   The rather hidden valet needs more signage yes unlike Tryst XS narrow hallway death as call them leading restrooms but Group done very very good job space  stark white refreshing walls more Hollywood Vegas chandelier plated gold let's name names outdoor seating utilized real dining space alone set Bagatelle apart  very happy seen look forward returning soon  Let's hope things stay quality over quantity   A far cry RPM Nikki Beach European style Vegas look Champagne Brunch  <EOR> 8 girls + 2 birthdays = 1 comped dinner  with tax tip came $25 per lady   PROS Valet own valet separate main Tropicana valet don't walk through casino  Decor Very pretty lots white chandeliers everywhere  Food _Salad Simple enjoyed butter lettuce           _Steak Salmon cooked perfectly           _ Green Beans standard           _Mashed Potatoes very finely mashed  liked it            _Creme brulee top little bitter burnt  Service Good!

I guess key getting really good comp dinner VIPs otherwise you're just getting really small free meal   Definitely birthday dinner status  <EOR> So stayed Tropicana decided Bagatelle days there    pretty cool couple fun blow water slides liked some shade  However staff needs together  bartender told thing waitress head lady working told another  When home Vegas trip checked accounts Bagatelle over charged $350 ridiculous! called did investigation eventually refunded money    until 2 weeks later when checked credit card statement RE CHARGED money! emailed guy originally handled problem am waiting hear back    worst customer service EVER  Don't unless want pay way more expected  <EOR> I graciously opportunity dine Bagatelle during Friends Family event   high hopes being several other locations nationwide well being part group could only describe series unfortunate events   understand pre opening event team still trying work kinks but some issues arose could avoided   My friend arrived reservation 45 mins early being she able work over Bagatelle sooner expected   checked hostess stand being aware might seated until time reservation   hostess did inform would try seat soon table available   waited bar area instructed give quite few drink tickets which greatly appreciated   waiting past time original reservation watching 5 other parties sat many empty tables restaurant asking hostess' check reservation finally decided walk over hostess stand ourselves   then told reservation didn't exist even though found reservation almost hour prior supposedly checked in   small argument ensued amongst hostess' content being each blaming other accidently cancelling reservation instead actually checking first time around   reservation re entered able seat 5 more mins that   After sat server section assisting table directly next us   Once he done table he walked away without even acknowledging there   took 10 mins before he finally returned giving menus look over asked beverages would like   took another 8 mins before someone came poured water glasses   took another 5 10 mins before given bread table server over menu us   told invite would able share appetizer order entrée each then dessert well     Because already looked over menu when bar decided foie gras appetizer rack lamb friend filet   also ordered potatoes puree asparagus sides   food very good however seemed could work timing courses little future services   didn't take long appetizer come but long finished appetizer plate cleared before entrees served   seemed least 15 min gap between appetizer plate being cleared before given next course   know if kitchen backed being probably still process getting use menu but seemed if case server could fired next course little sooner kitchen would much more time prepare   tables around did seem receiving courses more timely manner   During course meal water glasses never refilled nor ever asked if would other beverages refilled     After done entrees server returned ask if would look dessert menu respond believing would able least share dessert since told beginning meal would server proceeded tell some parties getting dessert some not   ones going receiving dessert but he would send chocolate plate   little dumbfounded being told beginning meal would dessert also because questioned why ask if wanted see dessert menu just tell would allowed order dessert?  another 20 minutes nothing ever came out   Someone came cleared water glasses before even checking see if done meal   server finally came back bill fold thanked coming in   point didn't see reason ask chocolate offered paid tip left   As ambiance very nice open floor plan   many levels seemed great place see seen   But also almost exact same décor predecessors   would see Bagatelle space own change things touch     All all hope experience reflection standards Bagatelle   considering going back few months see if things bit more streamlined  <EOR> Went Bagatelle Beer Fest rained out    music way loud pools made difficult even conversation  Some beer vendors generous others scrooge side   We good time 30 minutes but little bit disappointed spending good money rained no alternative being outside wind rain  <EOR> Went Friday night ladies night but dinner comped business with  told reservations 7 30 place wasn't even open yet  weren't seated until well 8pm  While waited drinks casino bar however weren't able bring them into restaurant pound them which weren't happy about   I under impressed decor  seemed very cheaply done  chandeliers nice everything else looked dated  place decent size dance floor seating all around  other couple group 4 guys seated both parties next which bothered because whole place empty   Once seated brought menus but since dinner supposed comped supposed prefix salmon skirt steak  Turned mix told dinner actually wasn't going comped  almost left right then furious we'd wasted time  Pricing menu ridiculous example $18 $30 appetizers I'd pay those kinds prices if well established place famous chef but some trendy new place Tropicana   After nearly hour discussion manager finally agreed comp dinner  hadn't able order yet starving! brought salad green beans potatoes etc  All served family style  group  8 people definitely enough anything around  food just ok definitely good enough ever pay for  didn't any steak instead brought chicken salmon  didn't try salmon because again wasn't enough around weren't 8 pieces pieces did very small  chicken greasy came more potatoes two kinds potatoes dinner??  All all ate left right wasn't atmosphere where we'd socialize spend Friday evening which bad  just dinner place food isn't even good  live entertainment but little much loud interactive only 3 tables people  would think Ladies night Thursdays likely only busy night  hip happening when whole place dead   Our group left complaining still hungry service hassle worth free food  won't going back  <EOR> Excellent restaurant  Worth finding Las Vegas! <EOR>
