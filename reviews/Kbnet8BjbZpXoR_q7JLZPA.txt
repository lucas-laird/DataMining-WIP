But darn it! just realized great garlic aroma garlic parm hence name taste MIA! also didn't parmesan cheese used grainy kinda pasty can't quite describe it eat  definitely lacked robust flavor garlic    On other hand lemon pepper wings good but needed more tartness lemon powder  would awesome chicken wings if better quality seasonings used  ranch dressing also replaced better quality  effortless scratch versus premade  would winning combination!  As usual staff wonderful friendly! located small plaza East Flamingo between Eastern Eucalyptus Avenue  <EOR> They changed restaurant  now Guatemalan food joint  no more exotic burgers tacos burritos aren't good anymore drink prices higher $3 50 half litre coca cola     I burrito some tacos  didn't burrito  lettuce beans peas carrots it  don't fancy peas carrots burrito  Aside asada tasted good    all really liked    As environment music way loud  don't mind music but jeeze isn't nightclub    Maybe being hard place because loved old restaurant old owners management  Turn music down try removing lettuce peas carrots burrito  <EOR> Came today lunch because yelp reviews  Place surprisingly empty even though reviews great  Place clean staff friendly  prices OK expensive but cheap either  bulgogi soda came little over 10 bucks   The burger Buns little dry but serviceable would loved see them butter tiny bit  Bulgogi very tender If tiny bit salty  patty itself slightly over medium but still flavorful dry  Overall good burger didn't blow socks off but still good gourmetish burger interesting toppings  try some other interesting offerings    Side note give chips salsa while wait some Ice cream your meal! All free definitely increases your value    All all solid burger joint toppings better average  Recommend lunch if you're close by! <EOR> Thought would enjoyable experience but sadly wrong  won't back    Location situated small shopping area near Flamingo Eastern  Parking decent plenty spaces  sure would feel neighborhood night    Restaurant spacious but boy boy smell cleaning products extremely potent! good way!! could smell approached restaurant  feel smell even permeated meals ugh! Big turn off! Pretty much reason won't back    Food don't remember coworker ordered but ordered Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Garlic Parmesan fries  Both good portions but again feel smell cleaning products seriously transferred food could only stomach half sandwich  came chips salsa starter which pretty tasty  sandwich fries bottled water believe paid roughly $16 17  don't even know much charged bottled water since didn't print receipt but guessing around $2 00    Service Friendly but slow wasn't even busy lunch hour I won't back reasons listed above don't think recommending place anyone  <EOR> This second time eating lab still delicious  guacamole burger now A1 burger they're both totally delicious  also cinnamon toast milk shake yum!!! staff seem really passionate food shows  glad found place though Yelp eat some yummy burgers!!! <EOR> If love hamburgers best town!

Best burger town! Parm fries excellent burgers big n juicy  here! <EOR> Excellent Hispanic type food Excellent friendly service!!

And while loaded fries certainly didn't look much actually pretty good! fries looked frozen cheese two forms sauce unmelted shredded  But real chunks bacon somehow came together pretty yummy!  Throughout rest time bad service continued  No drink refills no checking impossible find when more ready bill  didn't even bother asking split check because didn't want wait any longer   So guess if feel ok crap service check burger! <EOR> The Bulgogi Burger awesome   piping hot wait eat it   beef very flavorful spicy aoli side kicked notch   place brand new best location but burger very very good   If you're burger geek check out! <EOR> Little hard find but worth journey  Ill definitely back again try more whats menu  Great service great food  down try yourself  <EOR> The food great! garlic parmesan fries Cali chicken burger  good  girl served super nice too  only reason didn't give 5 because place isn't nicest looking but looks clean food good service great! <EOR> Its just mediocre  hopes walking into place because wasn't chain operation  can't justify trying them again though <EOR> What happened place? used cool burger joint  looks lot nicer but menu different  Burgers more thought  main menu huge full things street vendors  service bad too  server didn't really know English even pointing menu item wanted he still wrong  don't even iced tea  ghetto  <EOR> I'm sure if thought wanted order salt if should said wanted wings salt  received most saltiness wings ever life   guzzle Arizona tea order finish meal sip tea  <EOR> Saw El Niño burger yelp just try place! glad did because far best think invented  mixed pupusas patty mozzarella cheese middle satisfying didn't even eat diner day! back twice never disappoints!

I haven't tried secret instagram menu next time!  but all came hungry left full   Seriously don't understand all complaints prices here    burger costs just shy $8   Including fries three paid less $40 lunch today    unheard town where even cheap lunch averages $11 12   Overall great place find delicious unique burger   highly recommend Bulgogi Burger boyfriend recommends Pastrami Burger   Both delicious  <EOR> All positive reviews true still come nowhere close doing place justice! Finally stopped today living within walking distance year whoa    They're gonna tired seeing guarantee it! <EOR> Located small strip mall slowly being abandoned its businesses little restaurant  remarkably easy overlook  did three years  Then fateful day boyfriend brought place encountered friendly attentive staff juiciest burgers carne asada fries known side Almost Ghetto  quite few varieties tasty burger concoctions menu but customer allowed create own well  done but waitress told many examples customer creations Instagram  definitely returning feast future  <EOR> My husband loves burger joints just searched yelp found this  honestly weary walking because looks hole wall but good lord burgers heaven  burger husband guacamole burger   He garlic parm fries onions rings  gourmet burgers fast food prices  PLUS bring chips salsa beforehand FREE Thrifty ice cream afterwards    what??? We're coming again friends!!!! <EOR> The Service great  cheese revuelta cheese bean pupusas  size descent food delicious  <EOR> This restaurant definitely potential ! If owned I'd give renovation first off then inform better regulations uniform hair being tied up  noticed blonde lady long hair down going kitchen   just risky business  But besides ordered basically little bit everything! all good  only other complaint i'd shrimp nachos ff tots  ended paying $16 just order did taste worth much  Plus he order wrong too  pricey just careful order  also long wait time even no else but us    <EOR> I'd rate 3 5   Went lunchtime place empty   Asked waiter burger recommendation  much hesitation he recommended American burger  Pretty boring place called The Lab  The wait food torturous lunch break  All burger which frankly completely forgettable   However bumping star because ordered pupusa curiosity  cheap delicious frankly best had  crisp deep fried dough pocket filled meat   Conclusion skip burger  pupusa  <EOR> Wish could give 4 5 stars quite happy wonderful little restaurant   I burgers pastrami decadent  put chili side wasn't sure if wanted it  Didn't want ground beans could taste beans   burger although little dry great flavor very pleased it!  The cheesy Garlic fries OK good flavor but essentially fries garlicky cheesy mixture lightly mixed in  Granted good but would've chosen something else   Another minor thing helped subtract half star don't fountain soft drinks just minor thing   Additionally prefer cash charge additional fifty cents if use credit card  first little put off then thought cash discount   Want check place again recommend it! Thank you! <EOR> One only few places where pictures burgers actual burgers tasty look    When first walk you're greeted right away  service great  swell job explaining different burgers which ones recommend  Through few minutes debating which burger decided guac pastrami burger    The pastrami burger really hearty filling  burger itself looked just did pictures  chili good! really wished tried chili fries  Overall very good burger   My favorite guac burger  guacamole burger perfecto! I'd probably every time if didn't want try other burgers    They big variety drinks everyone juice Starbucks ice coffee canned soda    I'll definitely coming back again  Seriously close enough short lunch break if unlv  gooooood! <EOR> I just gotta know drunk enough think EL NINO?! haha  substitute buns pupusas add veggies it? Come on    my mind blown  only did sound AH mazing but ALL THAT!!! also oreo milkshake two slices cheesecake topped it  Wowzer! Service bit slow but could tell she new serving game cut LOT slack since she nice apologetic  Most high end places don't you're lucky if sincere apology  garlic Parmesan fries ok nothing special rest meal  But definitely back more EL NINO shakes  Prices bad all top off  advised charge  50 cents if use your cc if you're gonna eat just choose chair  <EOR> Self proclaimed best burgers town might true  burgers tad big but most won't complain that! Good ingredients fresh buns tasty cheese fries bacon! fast friendly service they've whole package    I recommend A1 burger onion rings bacon bacon!   fam ordered Guac burger not menu wouldn't share but said loved also bacon!
