Worst part night timing dishes  partner salad entree while salad salad  specifically asked entree salad served when entrees served  guessed it both salads served same time partner nothing eat while ate entree  good experience birthday dinner shame because food rocks  <EOR> After weekend drinking gambling general bad behavior wanted some food before leaving town    My boyfriend let's Sonic's camp but said I'd rather some real food  wasn't it   We considered buffet but figured price wouldn't worth shitty food started walking around find actual restaurant   Unfortunately found place its less buffet quality breakfast ended paying most paid meal all weekend   $20 gets plate food crammed eggs the scrambled eggs no salt tasted same stuff McDonald's puts your breakfast platter mini pancakes bunch meat  bacon tiny shriveled but bacon guess can't complain sausages tasted mushy goop encased really tough outer shell piece ham rubbery side looked something you'd see cartoon character eating  idiot assholes 2 these    $18 plate corned beef hash eggs  over easy eggs definitely looked came real egg happy that  potatoes fried shit but fine hangover breakfast corned beef hash puck greasy deep fried corned beef patty  kind corned beef I'd expected price  Hormel corned beef sliced into rounds frozen then deep fried oozing grease  totally against idea canned corned beef hash kind most disgusting guilty pleasures but should wrapped wax paper sleeve handed through car window exchange $3    $15 more dollars more pretend eggs few more those tiny mushy sausages another weird greasy puck hash browns? least McDonald's hash brown oblongs deceptive potato y shape   $12 Bloody Mary served small juice glass which basically tasted V8 but did tiny hint bologna  looked menu realized bologna must why called lardon bloody mary  never left alcohol table restaurant before but totally called for  $3 per sip figure left $8 behind   The best value coffee latte $4 $6 respectively  No refills coffee  knows maybe refill if somebody come your table  But time server came back around already raided neighboring table salt pepper managed somebody eating nearby give tiny single serving bottles tabasco  Chalked slow service server wanting face tasted food  finished plates because hungry paid lot money but wish we'd enough balls just leave    I'm glad didn't realize celebrity chef y place otherwise might some expectations  Before logged Yelp realized place name attached going say high prices shitty food probably kind expected 24 hour place lobby hotel  But waitasec you're telling isn't wildly unreasonable expect food taste better something cook home while half asleep completely wasted underwear 3am then eat while standing over sink?   Well now think Michael Richard owes $112     And he should probably hook waiter because end meal just felt bad he hand check  probably kind embarrassing him   If $112 burning hole your pocket should just take slot machine  faster way you're less likely shits  <EOR> Quick look Great location potential but still seem struggling find identity  Hit miss items menu service  Some menu items sub par some simply amazing     In depth review eaten several times mixed feelings  first occasion sub par beginning end second occasion spectacular all way around third occasion 50 50    This review based most recent visit call mixed bag  busy Saturday 7 30pm all restaurants Ceasars completely sat operating off table waiting list  decided try Central Michael Richard restaurant half sat could sit right away  sure if sign not? server attentive very polite  Made some suggestions menu took drink order  ordered beer mixed drink fried calamari appetizer  Server came table several times let know drinks n way apologized hold up  fried calamari appetizer arrived still no drinks yet? start eating soon beverages arrive  issues timing drinks should never arrive food  Server did apologize again blamed bar    The fried calamari appetizer served steel basket use deep fryer its placed plate  Unfortunately par  calamari extremely soggy all breading feel off tried dip sauce eat it  left wet chewy piece squid basket full breading plate full grease  pretty bad   We order two entrees 1 signature meatloaf 2 short ribs  Thought short ribs little over priced $42 entree  Both arrived really good presentation taste  meat loaf wonderful highly suggested  melt swiss cheese meat adds some great flavor  short rib best city  Entrees made poor appetizer  Both big portions very filling good job!

The server very nice working hard keep all tables happy since she only server restaurant 2am! Also reason didn't complain cuz know she stressed Basically Central overpriced Peppermill Denny's  water served room temperature tasted horrible  ordered $14 chips guacamole which really gross! tiny guacamole bowl avocados weren't ripe yet chips something Tostitos commercial  $14 would expect least bigger dip bowl good guacamole some chips flair! Maybe even lime scoops kind?? least chips Roberto's Taco Bell warm crispy! Just sayin    My Asian chicken salad tiny $16 but eating unripe avocados stale chips least hit spot   chicken flavorful good peanut greens dressing ratio    Don't waste your money! Eat Cheesecake Factory Taco Bell   least give clean tasting ice water too! <EOR> Expensive breakfast but heavenly  salmon eggs benedict friend crab arugula omelet shared order creme brulee french toast  salmon eggs benedict three small muffin halves piled high good quality fish thick sauce perfectly poached eggs  friend's egg white omelet large came side tomatoes but crab little strong  Might last batch?

It very much seems bottom food chain staff Caesar's  Plankton People! If you're late many times caught washing your hands trip restroom banished Siberia Caesar's eateries  people genuinely looked would surly anywhere   The food fine    When noticed 24 7 joint thought might old school Caesar's Diner but Michel Richard name drew in  Given service I'd recommend revert back Caesar's Diner  If you're going offer shitty service back candy striped bibs siren like call Keno?   Keno? Frowny face <EOR> It okay   really worth price  <EOR> This place amazing! array food! could ask more? service wonderful very attentive great selection!

I am sick tired places Las Vegas making prices astronomically high because Las Vegas   If know Las Vegas well enough know better pay high prices food very often because many ways cheap complimentary dinners     But Las Vegas known bring some best restaurants world city exposure all tourists     Well let negative exposure persist Central's Michel Richard   bad considering Chef Michael Richard put name place executes food poorly   Maybe someday try dish made PERSONALLY find amazing dishes may when made only him     Got croque madame very mediocre something could made myself   Ordered terrible cocktail blood orange juice super sour tart lacked alcohol     Biggest mistake ever made Ceasar's Palace coming here  <EOR> Service lacking waffle slightly disappointing  colleagues enjoyed food though! <EOR> Chosen visitors its proximity hotel elevator Central all right    Appetizer crab cakes plentiful good share between two people  arugula side good complement   For entrée he scallops served atop some pasta peas    I fish day flounder sautéed mushrooms arugula  flounder uninspiring simple salt pepper crust more soft crunchy  mushrooms arugula just tad over salted    I probably wouldn't come back own accord  better food same price  sure if care $14 cocktail either    Service great though    thing previously encountered restaurant used white napkins but when server saw wearing black he brought black napkins wouldn't little white threads clothing  impressed  <EOR> Sigh    where begin place   First off service appallingly bad   mean bad sit down    wait    wait    drink orders coffee two waters wait    wait    8 minutes then coffee shows up   No water   Really?  flag down someone just some water   FALE!

Dessert highlight chocolate bar mmmm I'd eat six those! <EOR> I don't know why would pick place over Denny's strip  mess eggs home fries bacon toast? latte came 15 minutes rest table served drinks  $6 latte should least serve warm  American breakfast cold took least 35 minutes food waiter never even came back refills $4 sodas    I asked rye bread wheat bread arrived  When asked if rye bread waiter simply shrugged  asked more home fries which sure pre frozen friend she given few only fallen onto plate just laughed never came back  Oh way $19 breakfast   I am only giving 2 stars because manager came 20 minutes later took care things apologized  even busy waited forever  He really should just fire wait staff start scratch  <EOR> I headed into Caesars turning left into lobby where grabbed drink while waiting some clients  bar proved facade Central Michael Richard where immediately told only carry two types vodka as opposed Grey Goose which ordered even though shelves above bar laden varieties     including Grey Goose  Figuring bottles solely accoutrements business when clients famished suggested grab bite Central itself    It appeared pseudo upscale coffee shop but also empty  especially liquor snafu should indication without a soul nature restaurant but proceeded  Upon receiving menu laughed audibly French Onion soup $19 $18 Caesars Total Rewards membership house salad $16 again dollar off! Rewards   issue isn't much prices 'new' Vegas Michael Richard formidable chef  acceptable laughable restaurant  clearly coffee shop menus laminated plastic Denny's! would charge much basic items     yet still offer negligible discount  Very corny very amateur   Regardless ordered standard fare burger fries chili cheese fries aforementioned salad chicken tenders left $150 bill six people which included only drink  food average but again inherent confusion really want restaurant evident  bring fries cute mini grocery cart eg Father's Office L A  but accompany ketchup plastic cup  mean no porcelain ramekins?
