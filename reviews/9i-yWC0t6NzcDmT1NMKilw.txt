I've very busy life past few months did realize grocery store once turned into restaurant   For past few years Filipino takeout place enjoyed selection  food oily fatty other Filipino fast food joints  Today ate buffet didn't partake seafood boils  But come back try shrimp sometime future  There's little spot corner which assume karaoke  should probably advertise open mic night happy hour   something cater young crowd bring business   I frequent competitors poor service most time  Cal Crab family owned love all people work here  They've always friendly they're just genuinely good people  wish them great success try figure new venture because deserve it  <EOR> Really big fresh shrimp ! finally place sisig right ! new spot Sunday lunch <EOR> The food delicious but very messy eat ! would really mood some work eat! peel eat shrimp served bag dump table throw shell table  However price very good romp quite large! Would recommend if don't mind getting little messy  <EOR> Okay guys know hot minute since done review sorry Where start? love trying new place especially if its local  walked Sunday afternoon hear crickets  good start  set pretty simple tables chairs minimalist? Yes!   The Guy tells sit wherever  Sitting down good gut feeling place but decided going brave give shot  server very nice did best provide answers  Here's what's menu     Shrimp 10 99 lb lemon pepper medium   Add sausage  Sweet potato fries Parmesan garlic fries  The shrimps came ridiculously thick heavy duty plastic bag  going vacuum deal leftovers? All could smell point melting plastic favorite  Inside bag think layer oil garlic  tried shrimp flavorless but oily  looks tried spicy using chili oil instead good blend spices  sure where pepper part seasoning but garlic infested  send shrimps back because appetizing all    It really disappoints think someone open crab shack compete hot juicy  If want compete least just good if BETTER  You're wasting food time doing half ass job using cheap useless ingredients    The only thing recommend anyone wants give place shot order sweet potato fries  Service good food terrible  Please just Hot n' Juicy  Even though don't know good servers least you're going pay great food    Happy eating everyone ciao <EOR> Hands down!  big bang seasoning n shrimp die for!  recently added filipino buffett it    JUST MORE EAT! Holla! <EOR> Was excited try place since love boiling crab hot n juicy crab corner   but disappointed  service SLOW   even though only other table eating waited quite bit  When blue crabs overdone didnt seem fresh other places  really wanted place   their cajun sensation sauce real good  Perhaps next time just shrimp maybe snow crab legs  bananas pajamas dessert good but its bit pricey get  hope better next time  <EOR> 11 16 12 DON'T EAT HERE! Location Eastern  Walked place Thursday while going Greek restaurant next door  Since family loves crabs hence name restaurant decided come back Friday try   There thought 4 customers however soon saw 2 owners managers  ordered crab then told didn't any  Then ordered fish chips fries lobster tilapia  Since am super fan fried food asked tilapia grilled   All food came different times  Fish chips first which ok great definetely didn't taste fresh cod  But ate it  Then lobster came dumped table bag  ask plates silverware everything plastic  Weird $40 lobster! lobster scolding hot could even touch nor would put something hot plastic plate  ate off table  taste seasoning lobster fine   Then came tilapia placed between mom she took bite didn't really say anything just looked then noticed horrific smell  should but tasted take mouth put nicely  fish smelled tasted bleach  literally handed back server  Then manager came table fish asked if ever tilapia before    Really! don't know wrong don't even want know but quickly packed family paid left  even charged credit card FULL amount then refunded $13 cost fish  never back  <EOR> I understand new business giving them benefit doubt when came opening week still trying work things out    When first came stood entrance five minutes before server greeted told group could sit anywhere want    The menu your traditional seafood cooked Louisiana style but see touches filipino influence thrown items lumpia fried tilapia adobo halo halo  also filipino beer Red Horse San Miguel won't find your typical restaurant    My party started off clam chowder bread bowl calamari  clam chowder came cold  Barely room temperature  calamari portions surprisingly small price pay calamari itself small boot  main course ordered crabcake sandwich cajun fries  believe pay $1 extra fries your choice  sandwich good but came cold again making wonder if made fresh  guess didn't mind since since eating cold crab isn't bad eating cold clam chowder  friend fried shrimp parmesan garlic fries  first thought brought wrong fries but upon closer inspection fries sprinkled little bit parmesan granulated garlic  expecting something along lines wing stops parmesan flavor put wings  barely could taste difference between regular fries  amount fries give small too  shrimp other hand pretty good  ordered cajun sensation shrimp very large came piping hot    Our servers really good  Checked tables often when needed them nice people    Despite short comings food want return couple months because want support new small businesses  Hopefully then kitchen sorted out  <EOR> Tried lunch   Walked during lunch hour only 3 other tables filled   Always nervous try place when busy during lunch especially Friday    Everything menu looks great   I ordered crab salad sandwich asked type crab used told blue crab which favorite  ordered sweet potato fries which additional charge instead regular fries which came it    After bit wait served  sandwich lot crab light sauce fortnately mayo  served top romaine lettuce leaf roll  Which toasted bit stale  just made lettuce wrap     The sweet potato fries great!
