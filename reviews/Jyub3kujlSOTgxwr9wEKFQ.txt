Step 2 choose 2 dipping sauces  ponzu goma  liked ponzu way more goma sauce  Ponzu strong lemon flavor which liked  Goma tasted more bland side    Step 3 Choose main entree  miscommunication waitress here  dad large order beef sampler going share since wasn't super hungry night  Waitress informed cannot share entrees which thought odd I understand business standpoint though   long story short EVERYONE needs order entree  share entrees long EVERYBODY orders but can't order just soup base share 1 entree btwn your group date significant other    Step 4 Add on extra  didn't add anything extra since plenty food already    So would come back? Yes would  did enjoy broth feel huge amount food price pay  think staff needs bit more training because service kind sl <EOR> It just ok  sure if give them another shot not  shabu shabu rib eye added side salmon  Good amount rib eye  However extra add veggies two mushrooms much neither amount cabbage given The napa cabbage cut oddly did cook right gave more hard stem instead leafy pieces  Shall bowl rice given  shiritaki noodles side added little piles knots take knot else wouldn't cook right  salmon good but only give six tiny pieces  Sesame goma  sauce way watery didn't lot flavor even garlic added it  even close being good restaurant Swish previously years  gonna re think before trying them again  <EOR> Ramen shabu shabu place very good Chinese ramen super tender beef shabu shabu  Love it!

Very friendly staff delicious food! restaurant itself very cute well  definitely coming back  <EOR> Hot pot broths very good  Sukiyaki Yobo spicy broth  Sukiyaki overly sweet which liked   Wife thought Yobo broth slightly sour    The servers very kind but service still bit lacking   ask utensils chili oil spices  Also choice bowls plates food less convenient eat    Advice owner maybe dim lights little bit  Decor looms expensive but would create atmosphere if slightly darker    Big frustration $23 8 oz salmon but gave ridiculously tiny portion  8slices sashimi When asked told full order  politely disagreed server brought plate back kitchen  10 mins later management finally decided more salmon right answer  brought full order plus original small plate    The wife's lamb tasty but extremely fatty  Protein quality seems lower cost quality me    Warning dipping egg pasteurized other shabu hotpot joints  chose cook mine broth     Still meal tasty nice servers lot  <EOR> Nice design  Asian fusion hot pot restaurant  Environment internal design more Japanese style  installed induction cookers table everyone own pot   Food ordered Australian wagyu Japanese wagyu super tender  5 sauces wish more   Price little bit pricey when comes wagyu Japanese wagyu $28 but comes veggie combo rice   Service waitress Jing  She super nice patient  She explained everything menu gave multiple suggestions very great service! <EOR> I wish 6th star scroll to!

We ordered shrimp tempura because Fried Soft shell crab good  Problem shrimp tempura terrible  Tiny skrimpy little shrimp overly oily batter   Multiple items ordered Shabu Shabu came 10 15 minutes main ingredients but even if came time still lacked flavor   his place blow if address isues but die if not  hope sit down eat own food address many saying   My Rating Scale 5 Stars Would back weekly 4 stars Would back monthly 3 stars Would only back only if friends wanted go 2 stars back all 1 star probably business soon <EOR> Is very good l'll come back again  goid AMAZING  waitresses all cheerfull  <EOR> Wandered into place blown away kind service great flavor appreciative chef   While new experience place just newly opened experience could more enjoyable  <EOR> After having owner reach decided give place second chance  service better but still needs worked servers kept mixing orders sauces  meat clearly way fresher last time  really stepped game time when lots more people broth didn't taste watered down  If keep third Shabu Shabu place to    For Shabu Shabu place quite simple way order   Step 1 Choose your broth   Step 2 Choose two dipping sauces  Step 3 Choice meat comes regular large size Step 4 Extra items add such protein vegetables <EOR> ????????????????????

Servers awesome coming back place many times! always recommend friends also ! <EOR> Unfortunately didn't enjoy YOBO shabu much hoped  would rate place 3 5 stars   almost 4 if few things fixed    I ordered prime rib beef platter boyfriend beef sampler platter  chose tomato beef broth boyfriend sukiyaki  Both broths good flavorful  Sukiyaki sweet almost teriyaki tart sweet savory  No complaints broth    The veggies came awesome well  loved spinach cabbage tofu  paired well Goma sauce which delicious    Don't bother ordering YOBO special spicy sauce  regular hot sauce already hot sauce table     My prime rib sliced nicely but meat took long time come  Way veggies just eating rice vegetables while  puzzled because thought all cut but maybe takes while  Also piece bone almost every piece meat spit out    bit couple times    That main reason why ranked 3 stars instead 4  However would definitely come back again because everything else good  Maybe next time better experience  <EOR> This place nightmare bc service    going honest right then there   Came Sunday afternoon wasn't wait  Also confused why some kind shabu shabu ramen thing going but when asked waitress she no idea kind ramen noodles here    ?  Sat down ordering  ordered rib eye spicy miso broth goma sha cha sauce  waitress helpful all recommendations  asked which meat popular she did know answer     Okay first all why everyone given sesame seeds grinder if everyone gets goma sauce? think little wasteful but don't know if place just other uses it  goma sauce give also comes plenty sesame seeds already just seems little redundant  did enjoy sesame sauce since tasted way sweet weird consistency  blended bunch sha cha sauce little salvageable    food takes WHILE come out  Even broth itself took long time come when usually should come starts heated  Everything needed asked didn't green onions garlic already table which should already there  When food comes noticed really cheap prepackaged udon noodles while everyone else normal udon noodles  ? Weird but didn't mention it  food actually pretty decent wish meat thinner cuts though but all okay   Now service    don't even know where start here  waitress completely lost  would say excuse she looked around if wasn't circle customers around it bar setup   friend asked more broth since soup evaporated most part girl says don't broth comes bottle water    WATER     She fills soup water walks away  Tell why later other waiter comes whole kettle pot soup broth? She also very awkward attempting create conversation   She asked if soup good first before water   ?? She dropped broccoli off friend's vegetable bowl picked hands put back friend's plate  When friend asked why she did she said You're going cook anyway haha  UHHHHH   NO   This service needs major improvements wish knew name but just going fly never experienced anything this  suggest just coming here  only reason even give 2 star because food decent Las Vegas shabu  <EOR> Came twice once ramen once shabu shabu both fantastic  never shabu shabu before but now huge fan wagyu definitely must  Service also great! <EOR> Just restaurant friends  excited new Japanese restaurant until young waitress being rude us  called few times but she seems ignore me  sure if purpose she pay attention  food okay but little pricey  end where she really pissed off  She gave wrong check didn't even apologize  Well disappointed service  <EOR> Service slow food wasn't good enough want return  party four sat watching friend eat 15 minutes since other meals weren't ready yet  <EOR> The food good but need lot improvements service  specifically talking server long hair  She needs proper training service  She needs see customers' point view because know she'd upset irritated ever come back if she experienced experienced today   A server short hair good  She knew she doing she made sure all table well taken care of  <EOR> This amazing place  food really good  Service nice professional  If really don't know order beef  best choice  <EOR> Found place yelp decided try because good ratings love hot pot  When first entered kind slow   but finishing meal restaurant more crowded  didn't want bother waiters since people kept coming  Anyways food good  miso broth sukiyaki broth  broth good didn't need dipping sauce  meat sampler side Australian wagyu  Australian wagyu delicious! also dumping spicy fried chicken dish  Over all good but staff seemed under staffed?
