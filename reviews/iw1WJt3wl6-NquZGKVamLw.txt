I also side  Masala Fries $1 57 fairly crisp but quite moist fluffy inside expected  Moreover potato undersalted masala seasoning didn't quite cover up  Note savings going full combo minimal due fountain drink water bottle pricing which actually quite reasonable    Compared typical Indian food you'd find lunch buffet typical Chipotle style places Chipotle itself and others am impressed Desi Burrito  perhaps useful local to go option quick lunch although seemed take almost 10 minutes making not so fast food maybe option vegans vegetarians but nothing worth special visit many other restaurants around town  <EOR> OMG Indian food burritos!!!! literally saw corner eye driving around running errands almost crashed into curb excited  reminded Indian burrito Parilla Grill Bend still haunts dreams!
