SMOKE  Having lived Detroit area So  Cal used frequenting venues where cigarette smoking permitted inside  There's always outside gathering spot usually back smokers don't mind it's second party   Saddles Spurs only bar town allow smoking inside most do  don't understand why government venues encourage smoking inside allow smokers blow second hand smoke into other's faces  other night watched entire unaccompanied cigarette burn down three minutes ashtray  ruins experience causes exit early  only ones  Unless least four air filtration units positioned properly I know because used many previous business know they're cheap but they're cost prohibitive stand alone unit won't enough stop having leave clothes garage when home  main problem smoker next whole night smoker may just sit down next half hour  always crap shoot  We'd least three four times week if weren't smoking  Hopefully day      <EOR> Hopefully place better night       but during late morning       did looked very strangely regulars all sitting bar       full way       kinda creepy   Thought if found two seats bar       would people telling Betsy's Carl's seats something   The set looked pretty good local band play would probably good       problem       when am Las Vegas       spend evening hotel casino am staying at   Bottom line       probably won't back       <EOR> Went first time check some jazz music  Chill spot great service! Would come again  <EOR> We try attend blues events often possible which means often am willing deal smoke  terrific time last Sunday listening Monk Po Boys bunch regulars  made feel welcome Bobby Kingston owner dropped table  rare times when only person smoking anywhere near hour turned into three  love bands play jams  know owner invested air filters but can't always count them  food good vibe great dance floor huge  Every friendly  <EOR> Been twice now very true stink eye regulars *and* bar tender  polite ways let people know what's but if want jerk  fine  tips improve when attitude does  Until then enjoy karaoke Wednesdays  Other review right    enjoy short rotation fill place your own group  If don't rely place's atmosphere fun still great night  <EOR> I actually good time overall place okay     The place nascar country hillbilly theme   It called Saddles Spurs   plenty spacious maybe big group   Kinda run down but dirty anything   Went Karaoke   pretty slow   good if someone just wants sing bunch songs   if bring big group friends bring your own atmosphere   I typically love place just because bars look back home!  But almost gave star reason   They accept credit cards   NOTE OWNER 2011 time credit card machine   handed bartender card asked run tab he looked crazy chuckled    cash only  ATM machine order!    ATTENTION OWNER PLACE please provide basic convenience your customers   credit card machine  <EOR> Disclaimer place gets 5 stars because walked away free beer!   Me buddy decided hole wall bar   drive all time name always catches attention  walk there's only 1 other customer inside female bartender  ordered 2 beers she hands them buddy hands credit card  gentleman customer sitting few chairs away chuckles says woman bartender looks some new warm bodies! probably both looked puzzled seemed really long awkward pause between friend bartender   she finally said no cards just cash  ATM down  feel free finish your beers your way  Again man chuckled  chugged drinks headed bar took credit cards   I few days later handed same woman $20 she seemed very happy but dont think she remembered haha <EOR>
