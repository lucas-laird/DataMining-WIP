The #1 reason why place going business HORRIBLE DJ's DON'T KNOW MIX DON'T KNOW RUN KARAOKE    They've amature wannabe's trying dj  embarassment  stupid owners Rendezvous say they're trying compete Moda but insist using waiter DJ  joke  other Ballroom DJ basically mute he never talks only good dancing own favorite music taking pictures   Carding's made same exact mistake thinking could friends family DJ new business  now NO business  sad  <EOR> Worst experience ever  Staff very unprofessional employees complaining management most importantly food horrible stale! Sorry but guys give bad name Filipino community  Avoid place run back out  <EOR> Tried place first time must say food just ok don't waste your time money plenty good places Vegas night out   I also found owners keep using Under New Management bs but still same people paying workers properly ie  worker said all received $375 three months hourly pay other people said same stay away place!!! Hello!?!? Nevada minimum wage!! Let owners know horrible treatment workers totally unacceptable!  Too bad can't put zero star Rendezvous does even deserve one  <EOR> We birthday party 70 persons last Sept 17 90 % guests town  Food enough 1 worker stated because food only good 30 people ? How dissatisfied disappointed were! Some guests nearby restaurant eat low blood sugar  Party supposed 5pm host request serve dinner 6pm! supposed buffet dinner per person but buffet containers empty  Won't recommend anyone!! Good thing guests mostly family close friends!! <EOR> First foremost don't come food  Food horrible zero star me  However entertainment 5 star  enjoyed dancing singing  Monday night fabulous because crowded all  some time sing hearts desire lot space dance  Thumbs DJ Photographer Mike  He awesome! I'd come back more dancing singing  <EOR>   <EOR> Great parties energetic spirited DJ host  probably just but fond food  Everyone else seemed though but me  Imo buko pandan only thing like  recommend? If parties dancing having good time sure  place dine eh  <EOR> I recommend awesomeness wine bar Restaurant   The food delicious guarantee it    New management new Chef <EOR> Great place parties family gatherings  Food great! together work Irene nice enough cater all needs  VIP treatment! Love newly renovated place  definitely come back! Thank Jay awesome treatment! <EOR> This place doesn't even deserve star  place changed name used Barkada  service sucked until now same! event place recently no served drinks even asked most people tables if want anything  left own ask if servers  When u tell them u need never come back   celebrant's family paid services wasn't rendered asked box waitress just said oh don't know if give box ask manager  Hello!

We'll just buy some Costco give them some restaurant maybe even afford coz no budget bad business  place needs close  No professionalism all  Shame Filipino name  <EOR> Food excellent Band Terry Wayne Project exceptional  Played mix everything  crowded dance floor  <EOR> Love place !! Great parties! friend birthday party all amazing time !!

Further more event over proceeded ask paid gratuity!! most unprofessional place ever come across want paid it!! NEVER REGRET IT!! place getting 1 star Gratuity deserves! <EOR> I flew Nebraska attend birthday party being held establishment  Food 70 people ordered since lot guests towners  Food 35 people served  unacceptable many people did food during party  business claiming miscommunication manager no longer works there  would think someone would call clarify food needs prior party just sure everyone same page    My advice those looking venue big party avoid terrible mistake find different venue unless want your guests hungry due lack food prepared  <EOR> Just celebrated awesome birthday party close friends loved ones  Food ambiance entertainment service excellent  only did guests enjoy live band dancing delicious food but well taken cared service given  Thank making birthday celebration wonderfully memorable shared loved ones  <EOR> Good place hang out! better parties most competitors  place fancier high end  Check out! <EOR> I think they're ripped off   Private party cost 35 per person   food good  price package charged 5K 120ppl  pricey  including alcohol least beer   Where DJ doesn't speak just playing music whole time   When your paying entertainment should decent DJ know entertain guests  DJ MIKE SUCKS  learn more party going  manager owner walking around wearing T shirt flip flops   Come professional least wear shoes flip flops  want business earn don't ripped customers   Not worth money customers paying  recommend others  <EOR> This place seems alot fun if your looking some live entertainment good Filipino food  ordered sisig plate meat good overall salty meat soft  fried rice right amount garlic Felt Tita's house dinner  definitely come back again try more dishes  <EOR> My wife great time last night supporting friend name JONATHAN  food good hot menu lot choices lemonade delicious! If you're looking good time Wednesday night night!!! <EOR> So    invited birthday party w friend close family  All seemed well until actually car  parking lot smelled raw sewage  Made sick but thought Vegas   always smells raw sewage  moved on  Walked into 'Rendezvous' smell just more concentrated found where smell coming from  Now could understand circumstance situation toilets having problems grease traps happens but place looked run down old dirty vibe awful  looked employee saw none just assigned seat  aunt comes talk arrangements she furious w lack communication staff leading event much she can't even concentrate task hand  settle down finish discussion move forward  Keep mind smell strong point just almost sick  look around only see few girls black throwing cheap air freshener all over room which wonderful packed litter box 8 different cheap smells kind aroma  _ Looking water notice 2 9 tables room water  own water  DJ AWEFUL yet great photographer?? family cameras  Keep mind ZERO service 3 hours smelled *#^ ! Come find family billed gratuity no service  JOKE!!  There countless other cons disgusts family friends say place  also experience place put them all review  All say place hope gets shut down  waste space    UPDATE Just received private message DJ  Pull yourself together Rendezvous   Michael L suck short staff even let u guys play ur own music ur going say dj aweful ur stupid dont even know whats going behind scenes dont come back again pls Needless say gladly won't back  <EOR> 3 stars food drink prices    We came show Meow Meow she female hypnotist  showed early grab dinner couple drinks before show  food pretty good pansit pork belly lumpia  pansit really good huge order really flavorfull  lumpia good well however $9 fried app pretty spendy  fan pork belly which  really over done crunchy didn't enjoy it   The beers pretty cheap $3 50 domestic bad charge per glass soda   The bill bit deceiving    automatic gratuity only 2 party which didn't tell bill tip percentages spot tip if didn't really look bill would definitely give another tip    Kinda shady!!!!  We stayed first 3 comics weren't funny ended leaving early mic kept dying  Meow Meow hard understand funny all!!  I would probably try different Filipino restaurant before going back spot  <EOR> I fun place good dj good music food drinks  People work friendly funny  <EOR> The best Filipino restaurant town! Good food good music good vibes  Love place! Two thumbs up! <EOR> Very fun place  Local spot cheap drinks decent food  Latin night fire though! back  <EOR> This place somewhere between bar karaoke restaurant    My family drove Vegas attend private party held relatives grandma's 90th birthday party  Food took 30 mins time when able eat  first thought serve food but more buffet style  All food Filipino dishes including lumpia pancit adobo fried chicken caldereta chicken curry a little spicy sweet sour fish   Overall food underpar  party 70 looked made food 50  Considering buffet style only back because wasn't enough food   However really karaoke dancing  first hour made tribute lola playing favorite Filipino song  Then played dance songs  live band following hour  really entertainment because fun most family  <EOR> This place amazing food drinks really good entertainment awesome fun place dj band karaoke very nice environment <EOR> here tonight friend's bday dinner  waiting over hour food guess what? 2 page menu? half them  apparently they're out  food able bring within half hour wasn't bad but seriously guys  learn run business properly before open public  Yelp please ZERO STARS option  <EOR>
