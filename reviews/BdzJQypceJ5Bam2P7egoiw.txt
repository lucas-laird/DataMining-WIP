In fact now am craving writing review looking pics  <EOR> Any time ordered delivery never problem  However gone person twice now both times some issues  first time none staff wanted very helpful cooperative  acted if annoyance immediately very condescending when started taking orders  again today stood front line 15 minutes while staff only same person last time group stood around argued eachother  took extremely long time lunch would say understaffed but group eight people standing around doing nothing but arguing long time while line customers more more frustrated   All being said always very pleased food love convenient location  Would definitely come eat more if staff's organization better time spent more wisely  <EOR> I'm big fan poke bowls but pretty bad  First When walked through door smelled strange odor immediately  didn't turn around immediately because wasn't fishy rotten smell maybe could still give them try  Then noticed quite warm restaurant if A C low  Difficult keep raw seafood fresh warm temps  Then decor color plain unwelcoming  particularly clean bright  Nothing you'd expect relatively new fresh poke Joint  within first 30 secs quite turned off    But forged ahead recommended Sin City bowl most expensive signature bowl  all fish usually like  took less minute prepare  Visually quite plain no pop colors unlike other poke places frequent  Then taste very very subpar nice  Screaming sauce bland  No taste all or appetizing taste   only thing screaming No! Don't ever again   fish room temp warm   Then mango no way fresh  added awkward sweet but rancid taste bowl     I'm thinking whole time eating boy hope don't sick   only place remember am thinking more getting sick food  Oh total bill frightening experience $14 no drinks   <EOR> First all ingredients order extremely fresh  cubes fish cilantro  Typically fragile herbs cilantro dried wilted time find way into your food pre preped fast casual dining establishments   So bravo F R E S H N E S S!  With said let's dive right review    I actually aware Poké bowl burrito spot actually being opened  driven past stretch Rainbow Blvd lot less frequently since moved over year ago but trusty GPS advised take 95 way obtaining new Health Card saw drove by  really hungry thus made mental note return once business SNHD completed   So head back decided give shot spite trend lukewarm reviews  Believe sat warm car parking lot skimming through posted reviews before mentally brushing past all reviews advising try different place other voice telling just good boy some English Cucumbers oranges light healthy dinner   But easily guess debate ended   The restaurant clean decent size dining area 5 6 eager staff behind counter waiting place order  ever courteous offering answer any questions might assist ordering process   Ultimately decided Sin City signature sushi burrito Tuna Salmon Crab Salad Yellowtail Avocado Cucumber Cilantro Mango Screaming Sauce   also listed Red Onions but don't recalling seeing tasting but big deal me   portion large above mentioned ingredients could physically convinced stay under traditional sheet pre cut seaweed  Once rolled typical signature sushi roll your local Japanese restaurant wrapped paper cut diagonal optimize exposed surface area sushi burrito   The roll tasted pretty good but could benefit slightly more Screaming Sauce little more served side 1 2 oz portion cup   avocado inside scooped shell cut into pieces time preparation none off putting oxidized look sad old avocado  mention before even cilantro looked freshly washed picked stem last minute garnish     The only thing bad hair found filet Sin City Sushi Burrito where bisected before wrapping sealed thank sticker   But far possible physical contaminations hair gross but dangerous other foreign objects shards glass metal shavings  Plus curly which ranked higher gag reflex scale   Anyway besides unintentional surprise rest sushi burrito good fresh  But stiff competition all Poké bowl sushi places opened 2016 Mr Poké should definitely considered putting more sauces rolls offering extra side if consensus opinion customers   Oh yeah if plan stop regular basis take advantage stamp card  if hate getting car weather being hater drive thru window your convenience   3 5 stars  <EOR> This place ok didn't lot choices compared Sweet Poke place kind dark  also skimpy fish taste alright  I'd probably eat again but would prefer Soho Sweet Poke  <EOR> I stopped take dinner towards end day just hour before closing still people eating inside well ordering take out    I quickly attended staff made great duo production smooth quick kind  Seriously polite genuinely welcoming friendly all around good vibes which stood most customer service  guy greeted entered while tending previous takeout guest order then made sushi burrito patiently answered questions appetizers drink options  well younger cute green haired cashier named Isabel super sweet she helped gather items assured thoroughly ask confirm if everything ordered right  While also tending guests seated too  never left waiting long which appreciate   I Thai tea no boba included offered which bit more milky really sweet time  also tried jalapeño poppers first time unfortunately picture looked 1 4th slice jalapeño instead 1 2 slice seems everywhere else much thinner smaller thought mostly tempura batter much thicker slice photos appear bits tuna wasn't very spicy honest sure if because sweeter sauces just spicy jalapeño possibly because less jalapeño thought but good aside much smaller appeared Might consider ordering again future comparison  Also miso soup which okay also most flavorful time bit watered down taste but least wasn't overly salty guess though might've preferred that  also some seaweed salad portion very generous actually compared other poke places some leftover full finish but good  lastly ginza roll which spicy yummy usual sushi burrito two other times always good also filling only ended eating half appetizers otherwise should good filling enough its own but wanted try little everything  would eventually try hot Cheetos dust crumbs rice sushi burrito rolls    Also thought it'd worth sharing also offer yelp review deals! time free cheesecake redeem next order which consider if whenever return  rewards system wasn't aware guessing new?  The interior design simple point nothing decorative really casual but did notice liked all illustrations everywhere protein station providing bit info white board specials menu illustrations little lucky cats    Honestly think way tend customers needs really liked most place  Despite particular order satisfying other orders prior take delivery couldn't just give them below average rating because good job end which think doing business good food time good but way treat guests probably return another over order hopes full circle satisfaction  <EOR> Good food moderate prices  custom poke bowl crab rangoons  ladies behind counter nice  little odd keep pest control plug ins seating area though  <EOR>
