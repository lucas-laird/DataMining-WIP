Glad given shot become go to spots side valley years   restaurant only offers dishes menu others don't but also food  far tastier its competitors   bad  only good part left since everything else place certainly gone downhill first time dining here   I say last visit rather upsetting   group seated server who'd rather doing anything else but job greeted frown expressed little to no concern we're doing   then decided move around twice due horrid stench coming each tabletop must've old dish rag used multiple times without being replaced   also noticed menus terribly date marked prices written all over random items crossed off   Overall Lemongrass definitely better Vietnamese restaurants valley   However current state left questioning if still even safe eat since place just dirty   know some may attribute authenticity some places Vietnam where amazing meals aren't greatest shape but different country everybody food industry should held responsible higher level expectation   I'd start looking alternative if you  <EOR> This place really good food but service terrible  waiters don't say hi   They're rude  time through menu table other times they've spilt water food lap  He didn't even apologize  He acts he hates job taking customers  husband daughter once week  would think would recognize ordering same things  going years  closest house  point want find new place but afraid foods going terrible  Some must changed owners something because people use very friendly worked there  <EOR> Loved Shrimp Pho Shaken Beef   service great food arrived quickly   10 year old she high sensitivity smells   When walked she wanted walk because she said smelled mustard   But eating delicious meal she happy! <EOR> good food slow service <EOR> My friend calls metal box lol  Very diner atmosphere  would never imagined pho joint 70s diner very original  bun bo hue really good here  best thus far  Customer service really good also  <EOR> At first weren't sure if restaurant since looked 50's diner  must commend freshness pho #39 small  Although took awhile pho all worth it  took first sip could already tell major difference! could never tell difference pho sushi BUT could definitely taste it   We met owner's niece she really friendly  first visit mentioned yelp gave 10% off but now took off website since always least once week  After visit bf ate 2 more times same week! good! <EOR> So disappointing!!!! first time came ordered rare steak pho okay  way better but thought I'd give another shot order something else  boyfriend eggrolls bahm niet lemongrass steak  eggrolls bland bahm niet only thin long strip meat all really taste cilantro cucumber but  even worst one  lemongrass steak which 11 95 disgusting!!!!! meat spoiled!!!! sell spoiled meat!!!! just hope don't food poisoning something!!!

Tofu pho truth just sayin'  <EOR> I really love flavor pho probably favorite Vegas  Rich deep flavor very generous meat portions  Only reason  likely returning because burn incense near entrance which center restaurant  While understand meaning behind very off putting those very sensitive smoke fragrance  Unfortunately overwhelming ruins appetite meal  <EOR> Whenever craving Vietnamese place  noodles great egg rolls super yum  usually take only eaten inside several times    So why 5 star? Ambience inside just okay Service could better when eat final reason person posted pic worm  Kinda nasty but still come back     probably because didn't happen me?

Wrong  inside egg rolls really mushy no real flavor profile  just jumble mush which suspect under cooked barely any seasoning  tried soaking egg rolls fish sauce which also lacked flavor spice    We also ordered rice plate grilled pork Com Thit Nuong which mediocre  meat didn't great grilled flavor again fish sauce didn't help all  nearly poured whole bowl fish sauce plate didn't help all   We didn't try Pho which might delicious but gamble Vegas willing make  You'll see dining Pho Saigon 8 across street which much better far  <EOR> I am absolutely disgusted high reviews place got   I expect place mediocre below mediocre barely authentic Vietnamese food least good service   Service horrid half hour before asked drink orders but isn't dominant reason low rating   The broth just salty little actual flavor   Portions small price much higher REAL Viet places   I certainly see draw place  it's close Green Valley suburbs Las Vegas  if must but if you've Little Saigons Little Vietnams Vietnamese grandma's kitchen you'll leave unsatisfied   Pho 1 Decatur Spring Mountain  little grimier but loads better  <EOR> Enjoyed food  used Johnny Rockets restaurant retro look  Price reasonable  again Vietnamese food when craving comes  <EOR> Had heard place read few reviews excited another New Vietnamese restaurant  tonight left totally disappointed  Ordered pho fried crispy tofu nuoc mum sauce tea  took forever finished tea asked more which never came until reminded senior lady she took pot never returned  tofu way soft gave peanut sauce instead nuoc mum already discussion about  While seating eating pho watched waiter put straw mouth pull paper off then put straw drink take customer   pretty disgusting!

Just fried rice amazing!! Also exterior interior looks diner! Doesn't look pho place all looks different!   I take customer service into consideration very important when rating restaurant thoroughly  However if lack good customer service when food absolutely outstanding along price MIGHT disregard bad customer service    In case going long time before staff now gone  staff before nice polite  would say staff lousy attentive customers  could improve greeting customer smile seem upset working when talking customers  few times when didn't check took while waters table  Most time front desk ourselves if needed something    Other 3 rating customer service really good food decent price ambience relaxing chill lunch dinner  <EOR> Its 50's diner    place fairly new     The broth ot soup isn't flavorful Pho Saigon 8   However bad   Some items but pricing bit more other Vietnamese restaurants   tried fresh spring rolls delicious much larger Saigon 8   liked most rice tea   sweet taste it    Overall nice clean atmosphere   Definitely place eat if am area looking nice Vietnamese restaurant  <EOR> Cheapest meat ever   Didn't bit   Staff friendly  Did care pho   Cleanliness did look priority  <EOR> We won ton soup pho tai nicely packed broth separate meats vegetables  When home reheated broth microwave then added other ingredients really tasty  <EOR> Sorry love try new things perhaps just ordered EVERYTHING wrong  But combined sewage smell when walk flavor meats being off just can't recommend any other person  <EOR> It's pretty obvious used 70s 80s style restaurant but course people keep business open going in which nothing wrong that! night absolutely empty getting seat wasn't problem  menu all typical Vietnamese dishes would see any other Vietnamese restaurant Las Vegas prices *slightly* higher other ones noticed Spring Rolls $6 compared other places where ranged $4 $5    I tofu vegetable mix which comes addition rice place filling enough where little hard finish whole meal entirety! server helpful pointing some new stuff try menu worked pace eating  only downfall experienced A C which FREEZING!
