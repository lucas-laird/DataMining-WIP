You'd prefer smaller tip?  While taking order he yawned faces complained being late   Then he order wrong   ask waitress another table send because he long since disappeared taking order she seemed very nice    When he finally showed he said only Whats problem? explained order messed he made derogatory comment kitchen staff   45 mins received correct order   We finally decided just pay bill over McFaddens meals   Once again ask waitress because hadn't seen 45 mins   He didn't bring water ask anything show could order dinner   Its probably first time life didn't leave tip   Now don't mind waitstaff casual long service good frequent few places where waitresses think nothing dropping F bomb during conversations me   However case service just terrible   He clearly no interest being server which fine but then let someone else handle table   I would suggest sitting table being served girl tattoos  <EOR> I really love little gem tucked above Town Square  Walking into restaurant highlighted some British beverages set tone walked into quaint eating area bar  ceiling really set fun ambiance place great relaxing place afternoon shopping   We Chicken Lettuce Wraps which curry flavored  Loved them! wish would made meal them because good! entree smoked salmon sandwich  open faced toasted ciabatta light pesto cucumbers butter  Very good! little awkward eat first but flavors delicious light refreshing  friend Salmon Salad huge piece salmon top gourmet style potato salad next some fresh greens  Looking wish would ordered tasting definitely order next time!

No matter food  way drinks companion ordered beer Pimms cup  arrived some sort bastardized version cocktail love dearly  giant fruit chunks which place sparse 3 tiny pieces ice top quickly melting away  drink wasn't even cold  took 15 minutes server reappear which point asked if could something else instead because really wasn't digging it  He left drink which hadn't touched table which means still paying it brought house brew which he described Budweiser  He wasn't wrong exactly Budweiser but sort rusty taste associate English beers  fan either   So drinks? Total bust  But food even worse  ordered two appetizers which took 45min come out  appetizers cheese dip smoked salmon crostinis  could taken long?!  The cheese dip hit table thick layer skin over top already unappetizing  grilled bread came tasty but cheese itself gross  Bitter ale bell peppers no real cheesiness   could tell mostly cornstarch concoction   The smoked salmon inedible me  crostinis just sliced bread toasted baked  salmon described menu creamy figured Atlantic but ridiculously orange no fat content all rather stiff  thin slice rolled cucumber top which supposed presentation but just awkward way functionally eat that    Our server didn't check again long time time he did ready check  paid full price everything even though all left untouched  Luckily since Town Square just hop away other dining options   AVOID ESTABLISHMENT! <EOR> My wife dinner last night both very pleased     As commented others doesn't classic English Pub feel if  you're looking may best going elsewhere   read reviews before going expectations check   We during happy hour which great!  Most drinks half price Strongbow Cider favorites   $3 50 glass most definitely worth it!    They eclectic menu both wife difficulty choosing wanted several things appealed us   ended getting Cottage Pie pretty much shepards pie wife two appetizers chicken lettuce wraps cheese spinach dip    When food came none dishes looked expecting small bowl cottage pie dip little watery lettuce wraps just weren't used to   But dug everything delicious   While serving cottage pie appeared small deep bowl just bit narrow plenty food think ordered smaller version happy hour menu which ONLY $10!  More worth it!  cheese spinach dip great especially giving few minutes cool down settle   chicken lettuce wraps didn't lot lettuce not enough chicken portion consistency different    but still very tasty     We finished off banoffee thick graham cracker think piece toast made graham cracker topped sliced bananas whipped cream   added ice cream asked hot toffee sauce instead chocolate sauce   delicious!  Service around 5 30pm Tuesday night show right bit slow place though started pick meal on   waitress very attentive friendly  4 5 stars  Food Everything thing delicious though often exactly envisioned   4 5 stars   Price wouldn't categorize place pub wasn't expecting cheap pub prices   no means expensive just low end chow lower end prices   mentioned above happy hour cottage pie just $10 apps probably around $8 each   dish $15 outside happy hour but I'd say still worth it   4 5  Drinks didn't cocktails just beverages tap   Again happy hour great prices   $7 glass outside happy hour still very reasonable  5 5   My wife all month wish learned place earlier stay would come back multiple times   Highly recommend checking place especially during happy hour   sure visit place again next time Vegas! <EOR> I feel really bad restaurants Town Square does take place succeed? Kudos non chains decide launch restaurant but regrettably cannot say return English's   Let start saying group friends going celebrate birthday Summerlin pizza place my suggestion btw but someone group thought would better  wasn't particularly enthused find myself Town Square busy Thursday evening  But digress  ordered fish chips thought ok bit pricey was  just checked menu appears hey lowered price when swear cost upwards 17 dollars    They incredible terrace unfortunate view Blue Martini maybe watching soccer match cold beer would nice  just don't feel coming mall that  <EOR> I bad experience earlier year received invitation come back restaurant's dime try again which did June food back par but restaurant honored receipt reimbursement  Now going into dispute hopefully avoid small claims court  disappointment  place used joy visit  <EOR> Went afternoon tea service  only three couples busy  first turn off seemed try sell much needed  friend neither hungry going split scones pot tea but kept telling two  stubborn only ordered more enough  food good wanted be  other problem waitress asked strong wanted tea said medium which place cool timer table  But she said she would back serve four minutes steaming  She didn't retune until five minute timer ram then some  awkward because didn't know if should've just poured ourselves!  Now don't drink enough tea know difference between strong weak but just don't she didn't come back when she said she would  all busy either! tea loose leaf acai berry tea which good pour through strainer guess thats whole service aspect  But overall somewhat underwhelming  <EOR> Afternoon tea delicious adorable  Happy hour great deals  Most food items $2 5  $5 Cocktails also awesome  Only tea happy hour can't review dinner entrees  far pleasant experience hearing British accent server wasn't bad also <EOR> I dinner establishment rest classmates part graduation going away dinner  fairly large party 30 people all seated outside balcony  Both interior exterior decorated nicely   For appetizers sampler platter which consisted variety items sliced baguettes specialty cheeses smoked salmon fried potato balls croissants pastries curried chicken pickled vegetables  All items tasty but especially liked smoked salmon   For entree ordered chicken tikka masala  dish kinda threw off chicken way spicy well other classmates tried it  rice also tasted minute rice Despite service good very patient accommodating  <EOR> I really mood fish chips  BEST  Delicious fish proper crispy batter fab chips!

silverware if recall correctly   Oh pretty much duration meal watch workers spraying scrubbing setting each tables outside front patio   Couldn't done earlier??  As food tea only things really liked sweets even though just came refrigerator wet look lol   told desserts serve look pretty much sweets Costco   Well whatever liked them am never able say desserts any afternoon tea place Costco treats p  sandwiches really did them especially apple it   seem different sandwiches current online menu maybe those better ones which all just very blah or terrible apple one    don't remember scones being bad but weren't memorable because can't remember tasted like!  Definitely best ones ever even there   then tea tea tea me   some fruity but remember really caring all much   Service fine rest experience much personally   Glad tried but splurge little more stick places Strip if want afternoon tea Vegas again  <EOR> We finally chance stop English's night without kids stopping again next chance get  sat bar initially because all tables full but table ready time able look over  drink menu place order  According husband beer selection AWESOME! He hard time deciding which order big beer but enjoyed lovely cocktail called Hampshire Tea   For appetizer chose Cheddar Spinach Dip delish! didn't really need anything else eat but entrees ordered Cod Chips Cornish Pastry  Both excellent  cod perfectly battered thick greasy  cod came Mushy Peas neither care peas all can't comment if good not  Cornish Pastry very tasty mashed potatoes gravy came with   The interior restaurant small but deck outside sure nice when weather warmer  interior fairly dark but gave intimate feel even though sitting middle room  staff attentive but overly so  ample time between appetizer being served entrees  We're looking forward having dinner again  <EOR> I took parents while town   first time also   high tea service $20 person   Each person gets own tea or french pressed coffee instead tea nice selection tea sandwiches sweets brownies macroons scones jam   scones unlimited provided eat them all     and there's LOT tray   thought taste all food items decent especially price since most high tea's run fairyly expensive per person   I'd most likely come back again  <EOR> Huge selection food  also nice Brunch menu   Service very good   Definitely improvement over Cana  <EOR> Not only did friends enjoyable experience encountered most talented hospitable bartenders industry  Living Las Vegas almost embarrassing undisclosed amount years friends all worked explored ALL aspected tourism world  However Matt Aldrich set bar most interesting talented mixologist   He invited created personalized drinks provided great conversion    Drinks fabulous atmosphere relaxing good company all around us  If ever find yourself Town Square just remember its always happy hour English   Amanda Nikki Jon <EOR> Never food because being seated mildly busy Friday night 4 20 12 sat 15 minutes without being acknowledge ANY wait staff  straw broke camel's back when waitress working area stood next wife took drink order recently arrived guest then walked away  She didn't courtesy even look us  Good news left GREAT TIME Brio's just across street 25% tip GREAT service  <EOR> I visited english's high tea experience when seated table very badly crooked asked waiter straighten out    The waiter advised hold lid tea pot because falls off easily  very hard catch leaves pour tea hold lid same time    We waited half hour sandwiches scones pastries  sandwiches plain served room temperature  scones bland powered sugar made mess  also didn't any pastries top tier all    The atmosphere cramped few waiters ran around entire time    When manager arrived he started yelling waiters no reason then noticed drinking job well servers drinking  He also made drink behind bar then he took straw tasted shaker made face served drink anyway    The regular food looked smelled amazing would've much rather gotten regular lunch waste time money tea    If looking high tea Las Vegas try Veranda Four Seasons resort pricey but well worth it    I returning English's tea may stop try food happy hour because looked delicious  <EOR> Not sure legit reviews far but good job getting check place out  Third restaurant location since TSq opened? Good luck!! fan both previous businesses    We just made end happy hour nice enough let slide couple minutes longer choose appetizers  All happy hour apps $2 piece  Pretty sweet price  $3 glasses Newcastle Werewolf beer  Never before very good brew    Happy hour apps We beef sliders which different  patties battered deep fried  certainly juicy but then again could deep fried hamburger patty any other way? prefer regular sliders though  Brits really way?   Got mini chicken pot pie steak pot pie  decent  wife preferred beef pot pie ground beef but liked whole piece steak  Good flavor something would definitely again    The chips most disappointing  came curry dip mild watery  fries served rare actually sent them back!! NEVER sent back fries life  place  supposedly British???? Unreal  2nd batch fries acceptable but still very meh    This place lots promise though  breakfast menu looked yummy weekday lunch deal could knockout  lunch entree then $5 more all drink British beer  sounds heckuva fun midday! $10 bottomless offer mimosa bloody mary's bellinis breakfast but its only 9am 11am   Still decent better drink deal anywhere else nearby   Sunday roast which starts couple weeks could great too    The English afternoon tea time something should targeted moms kids maybe guys drink pinky sticking out  more just 1 TV place? whole TV schedule soccer perhaps?   I feel bad 2 star review only because staff really friendly personable   But call see it   hope bump star next visit   know back bottomless beer lunch days       Conclusion Maybe British   But Crown Anchor kind British much much more darts jukebox more TV's occasional stupid wanker patron better chips  <EOR> Its Halloween day all dressed decided check spot Town Square   Once checked noticed place called both English's Gastro Pub English's Quintessentially British   Once heard second name eerie feeling chills down spine not Halloween suddenly recalling story trusted foody colleague mine very spot   few words she said save your money  But movie reviews try myself plus visitor  good unbiased opinion     Anyhow told seat ourselves no big deal   sat near bar close TV   asked waitress greeter cook server if she could change Lakers game   She responded why they' re going lose anyway  Mistake # 1   She then took order ordered Fuller ESB   little flat some reason beer stored various temperatures unless its taste   then  simply preference no ones fault   Still things looking grim     So 5 minutes later oh girl comes back claims can't catch channel because Time Warner cable   Whatever   grin bear best things do   10 minutes later she returns reiterated look designated channel changer dude   I over it   Although must say when food came out    bangers mash pretty good   forgot much loved Cumberland sausages sausages particular no homo    Thankfully meat potatoes guy its easy happy   not saying don't little fancy times   VERDICT Aside service lack bartender seemed serving himself more aight   Peep stars yall   Food good prolly more those culturally adept    Peace! <EOR> First time wife loved it  server Olga great really liked happy hour beef sliders  <EOR> I very disappointed second visit place   first time husband dined alone service wasn't great but food really good   excited see offered afternoon tea menu thought would perfect place bring mom grandmother mother's day!  Maybe should made reservation wait but certainly happened showed up   hostess asked many said four    she sighed audibly rolled eyes   She stated wait would 45 minutes which big deal   browsed around TS shops 30 minutes then came back upstairs wait outside restaurant   hostess stared but didn't say anything   45 minutes husband asked much longer she thought wait might be   She looked flustered replied she forgotten all I wish joking not!!!!!!! would another 20 30 minutes   left course   won't bother them wallet again  <EOR> I don't give lot 5 star reviews buy gots say great lunch last week   Very cute little English restaurant pub style menu although room decorated more cute cafe English pub   Food great   Try savory peas   Perfectly cooked meaty bacon pearl onions   tried sampler meat pies   all warm savory yummy comfort   Mashed potatoes little stiff underseasoned but let slide   partner fish n chips sliders   fantastic!  Great service un vegas quaint room great food legit pub menu little gem worth finding   The chef came said hey   Usually bugs but case cool cuz he forgotten include mash meaty pies came apologize deliver goods     Good stuff  <EOR> Ok salmon egg scramble tasty HOWEVER opinion should wait 45 minutes especially where only couple other people restaurant  When queried waitress wait she became defensive stated everything made scratch  tasting bagels somehow doubt it  any case did appreciate attitude nor wait  again  <EOR> From told place may last since many things spot but hope does when back Vegas it'll there   Really waitress made night she super cool fun  Really made evening   Great beer selection  <EOR> Food great! Staff friendly nice  could used more staff though during lunch time  tea awesome  Highly recommend outdoor dining good food  <EOR> I need shout rooftops      I finally found great fish chips middle desert! quest NON greasy over battered thick white slices perfect cod  Well place  fish accompanied perfect crisp chips wonderful homemade ketchup tartar sauce  bonus place serving smashed peas plate awesome! second visit in week    on other side town coincided happy hour enjoyed great pint cocktail very reasonable price  Topped off whole meal sticky toffee pudding  perfect dessert cold night!   Love understated contemporary setting perched above Town Square noisy atmosphere common pub settings  Seemed very slow last night hope folks find place hidden alley upstairs town square  Forget chain restaurants around town square seek cool little gem out   Forgot add      very nice servers bartenders      and very reasonable prices! <EOR> We stumbled across Town Square newcomer chance   Nice looking place though particularly English appearance   arrived during reverse happy hour treated inexpensive eats beer   Newcastle Werewolf but some other decent choices   chef recommended chips curry which turned great   curry watery lacked punch curry should have   Chips curry flavored water better description but probably wouldn't sell well   fish slider other hand really tasty   fish perfectly cooked   should few more those  <EOR> I love ambiance music played place but no consistency    first time came awesome food service  Valentines Day dinner no love food stated menu wasn't served  When state special printed menu chocolate mousse don't replace scone say anything  Tonight great special cod n chips which before time wasn't same aspect overly fried n plating messy  But wait Bonafee pie dessert which before once again made differently   description dessert printed menu never stated ice cream   If if whip cream just let customer know don't play off won't notice  handle slow service but consistency big deal! Wait guess thing consistent being consistent P <EOR> I English's before enjoyed both food service however experience Saturday May 11 2013 bad still thinking almost week later    My sister made reservations take mom afternoon tea over week advance because anticipated English's being busy Mother's Day weekend   6 top when arrived yet waited over 45 minutes even acknowledged   Mom finally tracked down server putting table settings asked supposed waiting she responded Well take your order   I guess  took another 20 minutes drinks additional 45 food we opted salads sandwiches    From taking order never saw waitress again until she saw standing bar attempting pay   When she handed check she told could use pen sign but steal pen!!!
