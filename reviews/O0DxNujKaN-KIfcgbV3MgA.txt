Ok no  Anyway offerings different other places unremarkable pretty bland mixings involving rice french fries flavorless pasta    Service fine drive through but afraid making drive by  <EOR> I drove Pollo Inka Express while ago but hadn't gotten around trying until today  conversing Colombian medical student South America during afternoon decided swing Pollo Inka Express dinner   The menu big fast food establishment but food still made order  ended ordering Peruvian classic lomo saltado which came sauce cilantro soup  love soup think great meal automatically comes soup  = I also free drink arroz con leche rice pudding thanks check in offer  Two freebies check in!

Honestly if could eat everyday would  absolutely loved food people working very nice  Definitely must try! recommending place everyone  <EOR> Affordable food but just authentic Peruvian food  Mimicking El Pollo Loco menu but no tortillas instead Mexican Tortas <EOR> For fast food Peruvian place am very satisfied  food made order don't mind wait  employees all very friendly manager made rounds sure everyone comfortable  chicken salad huge healthy $4 50  I'd budget everyday!   I didn't try chicken specialty but dry salad    The slight bumps likely work little things  Understanding ordering cup water means customer trying buy bottled water drink  giving plastic bag when requesting to go box  also homeless person wandering interior begging which employees weren't sure talk ask leave  But some customers ended buying food he could stay eat    I hope business succeeds! <EOR> What just happened belly?!  Drove through place long day moving  menu exciting voice behind speaker friendly  Chicken Saltados Stir Fry wait it  french fries! chicken tender flavors surprising wait time just slow enough knew fresh  wait extra five minutes window feeling any day   The stir fry comes signature Cilantro Soup which nice surprise  green sauce spicy fresh flavors nice touch add your dish  ordered bottle Mango Juice delicious  Chicha Morado beverage radar next time  sweet punch made purple corn spices  Say what?!
