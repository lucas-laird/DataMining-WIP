Serious sticker shock   I can't tell food used sports bar watch Tigers good time beginning end night   giving 4 stars because apparently can't rate 3 5 its better time 3 stars   Would again?  Yeah because pretty good place watch sports Las Vegas actually second best time nightspot vacation   This place located recent upper level construction side Planet Hollywood Evening Call Bubba Gump Shrimp Eli Roth's haunted house along others as far know accessible inside Casino itself   thought I'd add many reviews super specific its location  <EOR> Amazing wait staff drinks point great rapport building skills  Great atmosphere customer service  Smiles all around  <EOR> If service good servers looked would talking different story  bar entrance bartender whoa poster model Twins Peaks should represent  When taken second floor restaurant number waitresses walking around nothing entrance though  taken table nothing but tumbleweeds  20+ minutes no came tend table left  tipping point 15 20 minutes group two sat table next served immediately  Never time dining waited over 20 minutes even tended to  Unacceptable bye Felecia <EOR> Ok great location strip patio outside good view hot girls beautiful inside cabiny feel  boys nice drinking spot  But chicken fried chicken could barely find chicken just lot breading Tacos blah drinks good  But won't back eat there  But drink patio sure! <EOR> Visiting weekend great time!

Ein Plus für die Männer sind eindeutig die leichtbekleideten Mädels die dort Kellnern  Zugegebenermaßen machen nicht alle den hellsten Eindruck aber das machen sie durch ihre liebenswürdige Art wieder wett  Dos Equis um den GefrierPunkt genießt man auf der Außenterrasse und bei leckeren Snacks und umwerfenden Quesadillas und Pork Sliders  Der Burger den ich aß war nicht der allerbeste den ich Amerika gegessen habe aber trotzdem eine Gaumenfreude wenn man auf Fastfood steht  Leider ist die Außenterrasse nicht immer geöffnet da hier auch private Events stattfinden  Drinnen sitzt es sich nur halb gut da fehlt einfach der atemberaubende Ausblick auf den südlichen Strip  Aber darum sitzen wir auch immer draußen    Jetzt Buffalo Chicken Wings    Das wär's! <EOR> Came 5 other guys bachelor party   ordered combo basket fried chicken tenders grilled shrimp   Also bloody mary   Bloody mary bloody good   Comes strip bacon which nice touch    The chicken shrimp good too   chicken very tender   bummed filled fried pickles mozzarella   couldn't even finish food which rare me   The bachelor group tried climb wall   just 10 bucks 3 attempts   wall harder climb looks  <EOR> A little disappointed joint  First time wasn't expecting much them but ended getting wings loved them  looking forward trip vegas some more wings during lunch  okay but expecting  ended getting BBQ sauce spicy thai sauce  guess expectations very high  beers continues nice cold which really enjoyed  <EOR> The food good both times came which more say Hooters  back second time because craving billionaire's bacon  Sadly completely different first time  wasn't even good kind different  <EOR> A must while Vegas!

Excellent hostesss  the Nachos ordered just okay   we just kill some time some good cocktails mission accomplished! <EOR> I shopping evening since hotel within walking distance decided stop Twin Peaks  First off true sport bar TVs throughout restaurant  quickly greated Twin Peaks bartender her name escapes very friendly asked name would drink  selected Stella Artois which served cold frosty mug   Overall great time next time town sure stop by  <EOR> Very limited menu  Kind ridiculous Hooters  If want every girl act they're love your very own personal stripper might it  know they're doing big tips those guys though! 3 stories tall which pretty cool view top floor overlooking strip pretty awesome actually  also random rock climbing wall center place  Beer priced sky high man sized mug that's fools pay more because wouldnt want order smaller less expensive size if called girl sized   also serve beer top 29 degrees something which pretty awesome hint beer slushy beginning   This would great place drink watch game hang friends    If over top not good way service  <EOR> There's no bull ride but wall climb  If can't girls show don't mess them  love nachos came try  pretty good sauce gave sweet tangy flavor which made pretty unique  bar lively  Great views outside too! <EOR> Horrible service! Waitress bad attitude spoke under breath lot bad comments  We're locals know Vegas service focused place really bad place strip  Would recommend place  <EOR> I great experience there  asked hostess if she could accommodate upstairs she said no problem all even though myself  recommend chicken Cobb salad  portion huge but exaggerated didn't need doggie bag lol prices reasonable restaurant Strip  looks big selection beers too! service fast waitresses all young wearing cute little outfits  eye candy guys  definitely come back again  try something else too  <EOR> I looking place quick bite before going see Zombie Burlesque see review thought convenient spot perfect obvious reasons  Having once before knew food wasn't bad either  rimshot  I bar ordered chicken tender fries appetizer which turned more enough food  Besides admiring friendly tag team bartenders beautiful   smiles   I also enjoyed watching myriad games bank TVs set bar    Even if time race staff famous indoor rock climbing structure need spend some more time gym ready that! LOL  For Vegas purposes Twin Peaks good place pre game before naughty night out  <EOR> The name says all   refreshing alternative Hooters  staff friendly enthusiastic   Food bad  Plus Dubs eliminated Nuggets playoffs inaugural trip Peaks    <EOR>
