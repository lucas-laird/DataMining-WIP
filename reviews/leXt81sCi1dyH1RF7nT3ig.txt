Haha! <EOR> I frequent taco shops quite often polite staff  Although may convenient food consistent chain  big fan soft tacos over crunchy but  just me  <EOR> I've come expect less Roberto's general over years prices gone quality gone down but particular location really set mark low  start off wanted charge  50 cent card fee payed cash instead  haven't drank soda over 6 years ordered water always do  having already payed bill given them tip received food she then tells don't any cups water if weren't 100 Styrofoam cups right behind her  If issue when ordered would payed but wasn't given option even fact  top off visit sat eating myself nothing drink all girlfriend jumped back large roach running across floor right feet  gladly never step foot location again now Roberto's ranks lower list ever before  <EOR> Friendly staff fast service  Carne asada super nachos awesome! <EOR> This Robertos awesome   Even only ever adobado taco always point   annoys pay extra  50 when cash $3 00 taco but stop me   Lifelong customer sure  <EOR> This particular location never disappointed flavor quality food  Yes other locations same  such shame because would great if could same quality taste across city  Everything location great  deduct star because attitude cashier works late nights  several interactions she always unfriendly borderline rude  However just smile wish great night take yummy food   <EOR> My son just location  female clerk took order made mistake son said NO BEANS twice when she asked she heard wrong ordered beans  son girlfriend counter didn't want beans female clerk came told son he told wrong  Everybody mistake but blaming customer? Instead apologizing sorry heard wrong? kind customer service  No wonder 2 stars only   give 1 only because can't leave zero  <EOR> If possible leave zero star would  called order 2 chorizo egg potato cheese burritos them light egg  When pick them up  told them pick them up  told didn't say said California burrito  told them no didn't then made it  home no chorizo one  then called told them told need bring them back because need proof no chorizo there  brought them back grabbed glove opened them saw none  then came again said never said chorizo  told them want money back burritos  didn't appreciate being called lier multiple times  having drink multiple times  didn't anything help fix problem anything  When home still made burritos wrong  <EOR> I'm raising rating 1 star 4 because service noticeably improved last 6 months  Also admit always kept pretty clean  <EOR> Ridiculous waited 20 mins 8 chicken tacos all 8 edible   i just few days ago AMAZING!! TODAY TERRIBLE!!!!! <EOR> I ordered 2 carne asada nachos specified no beans both  home noticed beans called restaurant let them know  girl answer phone tells bring back food remake guess  inconvenient ask customer instead giving credit over phone your next purchase very stupid checking food before leaving restaurant  food reason why gave them 2 stars but customer service needs some work  <EOR> This place terrible  Usually order wrong food burnt  day crew pretty decent don't mess much  If night there's young girl 'works' behind counter  totally understand English isn't first language but no excuse when point picture burrito burnt taco instead  Save your money just dumpster dive chili's across road  least actually pick want won't high expectations  <EOR> Well certainly must take reviews heart because nice friendly person currently working counter  huge step right direction    Also found something menu only edible but super delicious  Beef enchiladas  Super yummy pretty addicting  <EOR> Wow sure why reviews low place   couple times tried number dishes carne asada nachos beef chimichanga carnitas burrito chicken cheese quesadilla carne asada plate each dish very good excellent   burrito nachos particular outstanding some best nachos honest    Service fast friendly efficient  its fanciest place if eat but its your standard hole in the wall type taco joint  <EOR> My husband loves breakfast burritos here  reason didn't give 5 stars because isn't any vegan menu items when busy isn't much place wait  needs number system displayed because can't hear description your order spoken   wait longer should when your order individual working counter mentions he called your order several times  <EOR> Do rolled BEEF taquitos string beef  much beef added such disappointment!! No wonder why losing customers  <EOR> I don't usually come location however may last time    prices taco just ordered barely any meat  Roberto's already isn't great <EOR> The cashier real friendly helpful  may because language barrier  cook very attentive real friendly  Sang he cooked cleaned grill  My husband carne asada tacos which he said delicious  #2 which  asada burrito beans rice drink  Neither husband liked refried beans however rice really good  Liked idea salsa veggie bar  Did fact  charged use credit card  Would probably back due that  <EOR> Food horrible  Absolutely horrible  Everything salty down beans  manage that? Ordered 4 different plates all salty  Chorizo saltiest all  Also messed order shorting one  came back just laughed  Very bad customer service  never again  <EOR> I called ahead 2 breakfast burritos still wait extra 30 minutes once shop  Very disappointed!! <EOR> This place pretty good me   hadn't any other ones but experience good   food great closest ever real Mexican   chorizo burrito beef taco both great   heard customer complain put sour cream even though he didn't want it   But fixed think maybe better Robertos around   know enjoyed less 10 dollar meal!! <EOR> Whoa Nellie   really   a 1st review!  forever since seen me!  Roberto's Taco Shop very first places tried Mexican food when arrived UNLV 1996   Prior Maui many locals thought Taco Bell authentic ever gonna get   Boy taste buds surprised!  now many years later still keep Roberto's Taco Shop mind when want some cheap hearty Mexican eats   I'm guessing Roberto's fairly new because hasn't reviewed yet!  can't really find location website yet either   located same shopping center N  Decatur where Walmart is   also very close where Goldilocks bakery used reside which sadly now closed   Bring back pandesal!  Now gotta drive A$$ all way over Maryland Parkway Filipino pastry fix!  If you're fan Roberto's know standard Mexican fare   Yes realize many especially those really Mexican think Roberto's McDonald's Mexican food   yes realize much better Mexican food there   But damn easy find Roberto's near me!  Almost no matter where am town am able easily find Roberto's nearby   When Chipotle option Taco Bell Del Taco constantly give random cramping still urge some carne asada?  hit Roberto's no doubt   This Roberto's particularly clean I'm guessing because new bright color   Somehow color orange mixed lime green always reminds papayas   guess just works them   also read somewhere bright colors invite feelings hunger   Nice psychological marketing ploy Roberto's!  menu Roberto's also no different other ones town which welcoming because am pretty familiar menu     I know shouldn't but usually stick fattiest things find menu   Those things first fell love when Roberto's back day   Beware eating stuff daily basis raise cholesterol levels turn into Fatty McFat Fat!  please handle some restraint   family shared Carne Asada Nachos covered marinated steak tons fresh shredded cheese sour cream guacamole Carne Asada Quesadilla burrito sized tortilla folded loaded marinated steak more shredded cheese  Mind supposed snack!  two items easily filled four us   usual Carne Asada Nachos point tasty!  always laugh nachos come small layer nacho chips loaded meat cheese toppings   usually grab fork eat rest delicious carne asada   extra order chips   quesadilla good well   Oily sure but damn good   Meat Cheese Tortilla Repeat   Fat = Flavor notion Roberto's sticks!  I am also fan Roberto's rolled tacos tortas   Try lengua burrito some best damn tongue you've ever had!  Well relatively speaking   Yes tongue very good indeed   What also love Roberto's complimentary salsa bar   Load red green sauces but don't forget helpings fresh cut cucumbers radishes green onion pickled carrots!  All cleanse palette cool down senses   grab cup Horchata your Mexican meal   Refreshing!  Service friendly super fast   Prices very nice cheap definitely par other fast food joints to   Ole! <EOR> I'm tired coming eating old meat kept warm over grill metal jar tongs it  gross food worth paying for  always ask fresh meat else don't right  doesn't any sense CARNE asada takes 3 minutes cook which isn't long  Lazy method lazy employees  <EOR> This wasn't par   relish bar disgusting   taco salad just ok  very flavorful  won't back  <EOR> Not best food Mexican  ordered three rolled tacos guacamole side  guy takes order starts making order right didn't even bother wash hands!! asked why he didn't wash hands he replied saying weren't dirty! _ just took money say your hands aren't dirty!? sanitary especially food environment!! Asked money back never going back!  Don't waste your money! <EOR> Love Roberto's  location far worse customer service bad  Made order everything wrong   Cashier argued stating did order right  even showed wrong still no change nor help  Just attitude    highly disrespectful  There's nothing   never come Roberto's again   Zero Stars opinion  <EOR> 24 hour spot  star convenience other pico  Chicken tacos chicken tamales  Tamales taste store bought pretty sure are taco shell disgusting! Red salsa tastes soap detergent  Rice dry  Beans digestible  definitely better Mexican  <EOR> Food customer service always pretty good whenever go  Love open 24 7 food always fresh  charge $0 50 use card which odd  Decently priced good amount food  since close home always open! <EOR> Ate location twice while visiting N  Las Vegas  no problems service order accurate food very good  <EOR> No mames  pinches tacos pendenjos que sirve la Carne parse mierda 20 dollar's por unos 3 tacos ponganse calentar las torttilas par de monos sin cabeza ni una Estrella les doy tieneen que cerrar esta basura <EOR> Awful cashier made kid buy another item because cashier did take order correctly  kid severe food allergy avocados tomatoes  She ordered nachos NO guacamole NO pico  Order came guacamole  evil cashier lady refused fix made order pay another one! used eat least once week 3 teenagers house  somewhere else! Shadow Ridge High School students beware       little Triana could died there! <EOR> If could give EMPLOYEE Britzel 0 stars WOULD  only she racist African Americans she nastiest attitude ever encountered restaurant industry!
