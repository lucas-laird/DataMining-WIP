SALUT!!! <EOR> Great new place near Summerlin   Food excellent service good!  Food coming kitchen bit slow but probably because open long   But staff food makeup that!  Worth waiting Lasagna Pizza delicious   Also Meatballs <EOR> Upon walking into Anna Marie's lunch today first time trying restaurant out confusion first step  no hostess stand walked stood bar area 3 minutes before ask bartender mind saw standing but no greeting acknowledgement arrival should ask help us  He waves off says server handle  Ummm    ok  lady grabs some menus says NOTHING US starts table  reluctantly follow she drops menus leaves own devices  server showed promptly stayed answer questions  server nice knowledgeable Romanian   non alcoholic drinks came good time but took 10 minutes beer  sitting just over ten minutes ask same bartender waved off beginning mind ZERO customers bar walked table see if some bread table  He's carrying case beer when asking question didn't expect drop everything us  Let perfectly clear!  He rudely says yeah your server you  30 plus years husband restaurant business ten years completely put off attitude towards customers complete negligence understanding front house operates  tell maybe he act he's part team tell nicely he's going drop beer off bar he find someone help out  very simple basics customer service!!! Especially if just opening new restaurant neighborhood great start  Immediately manager Kevin shows grabs chair front both hands squeezing squares shoulders it's called posturing restaurant industry defends bartender saying he beer hands  He asks going explain team member rude  He comes defense rude attitude says he bread  He walks away      ask name bc didn't see name tag he comes back squares shoulders again gives stare down  Completely unnecessary tried intimidate me  point husband gets aggravated say let's go  many Italian restaurants town treated were  only front house person but manager  don't review food sorry  could great could service no idea! But knowing restaurants operate off strip town need together  manager especially unprofessional sure should place work  Don't restaurant even Mediocre expectations should treated  down road salute red rock Ferraro's  Hell Applebee's  guys won't it  <EOR> Update owners response below picture attached shows owners response he initially sent message saying he would help next time visit  family visit restaurant twice week  celebrate birthdays bring friends family town recommend food others  am shock owner would send follow message telling family return if read more reviews others clearly see restaurant problem service necessarily food  reviews dating back last year decline  unfortunate owner won't take responsibility staff but rather tell customer spends lot money come back neighborhood restaurant   _______________________________________________________________________________ <EOR> I heard good things Anna Marie's friend decided give try   am glad did!  rather small place   If wine appear good selection!  I seated four top   hated taking room such large table solo diner but problem flow during time made OK   Asking server Justin several questions appetizers learned they're all meant shared   really wanted fried calamari but instead opted zucchini sticks   brain dead   never thought ordering cup small bowl soup   zucchini sticks arrived 10  5 each side dish marinara center dipping   zucchini very good marinara quite tasty but just much food   stopped eating five Justin packed other 5 takeout   For main course ordered chicken Sorrentino  Chicken breast topped eggplant prosciutto mozzarella light brown sauce onions   your meal choice pasta broccoli spinach other thing can't remember   pasta choosing rigatoni red sauce   could gotten same sauce chicken but wanted taste red sauce   The chicken dish excellent   brown sauce very rich somewhat wishing I'd gotten rigatoni   red sauce rigatoni good   LOT food   Still room dessert   all them box 5 zucchini sticks!  A special dessert yesterday Nutella cheesecake Oreo cookie crumb crust   excellent!!  Service exceptional   entire staff worked team   know probably assigned tables but any person walking would remove dirty plate   iced tea refilled several times ice brought glass beginning proved very useful!
