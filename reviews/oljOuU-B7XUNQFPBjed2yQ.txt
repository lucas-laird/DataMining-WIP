I would recommend restaurant   We party 9 waited least 30 minutes time ordered until dishes arrived   wasn't even worst it   When tried tell busboy waitress manager all adopted problem attitude   First ordered water   waitress brought tray water just left nearby table   Las Vegas where people tend thirsty long hot day   few minutes serve ourselves when another server finally put water table   Then long waiting period moment ordered until food arrived   took long started check watches know took least 30 minutes until last person served   The first person served 15 minutes   Then dishes slowly came table   first person actually finished dinner before last person served   second to last person served   last person 13 year old boy   decided wait until he plate good thing did because waitress then came grabbed dish said wrong dinner before hurrying off it   no apology   No Sorry mix    She just grabbed left   means someone else restaurant also dish late might've gotten dinner partially eaten   waitress didn't even check   Ten minutes later dish arrived ended being last served   When tried tell busboy long wait he simply said lot dishes  if problem there's no he mention to   When tried tell waitress long wait bad service once again she didn't apologize didn't even offer any explanations   asked manager she simply shrugged brought over   I told manager long we'd waiting he adopted very defensive attitude   When asked manager owner restaurant he simply said restaurant owned corporation should contact Vivian whomever might be    other words he only wouldn't acknowledge problem he wouldn't take responsibility nor give easy way inform anyone else   It took three discussions manager before he finally let ego apologized offered look into problem   credit he also took dish off bill   But cost meal isn't important   problem ineptitude staff attitude waitress busboy manager   The final insult bill came automatic 18% gratuity    because party nine   staff gave themselves 18% tip giving bad service   When tip automatically included takes away your ability vote   Before come restaurant imagine you'll wait long time your dinner lousy attitude might still tip them if great service   Then think all other restaurants Las Vegas give your money instead  <EOR> Came 6 year old's birthday extended family busy night them felt quite bad wait staff  beginning part meal did pretty good job service food actually 4 star tuna poke particular standout    Then things progressively uglier  Despite restaurant slowing down waiter pretty much disappeared  Whenever he would come asked bring daughter's birthday cake candles brought celebrate  He told least twice its way   then 30 minutes by  Both kids melting down 6 year old crying birthday grandparents falling asleep couldn't even find waiter   He finally reappeared asked cake back check cause go  Another 10 minutes cake check appear   with mandatory 18% gratuity added on   No apologies waiter just own cake back sad little girl pretty much ruined evening   So walk then realize didn't give candles back still needed light them home!

Maybe food spicy its swimming oil? <EOR> i've going back forth between 3 4 stars couple days now  what finally made decide 4 stars service   the hubby brought mom dad sis nieces dinner  what didn't realize until sat down menus chain restaurant locations california arizona nevada  not huge chain but chain nonetheless boy am fan chain restaurants  to surprise kabuki serves some decent fare chain restaurant  believe worried   we ordered quite bit food bill still pretty reasonable  it likely because ordered few things reverse happy hour menu which takes place everyday 9pm except sundays where starts 8pm  they also regular happy hour 5pm 8pm   they definitely don't skimp portions here  even appetizer portions huge! if known going cheesecake factory sized portions would ordered much! we ordered firecracker mixed tempura yellowtail carpaccio soft shell crab sesame chicken pear endive salad salmon skin salad omakase special albacore crunch roll rose roll mediterranean sea bass tempura udon slamon sashimi following nigiri aji kaibashira 2 anago 2 toro amaebi 2 hamachi toro aburi kaibashira   a few downers far much rice nigiri pieces  they serve huge slices fish but rice equivalent  i told request less rice try next time because only ate 1 8 rice gave each piece  the fish appeared fresh everything very tasty  there's nothing fancy sushi here  i don't use wasabi soy because tends drown flavor fish  i eat served used sushi chefs use some sort condiment sauce aged soy enhance flavor fish but don't here  they could certainly improve ginger well  albeit wasn't pink stuff which great but didn't consistency spiciness become accustomed to   our server however phenomenal  she kind attentive very patient even closed still eating  i asked some yuzu squeezed scallop she wasn't sure if chefs could but when she brought sushi order she also brought small dish yuzu juice asked if wanted  heck yeah! i ecstatic! she definitely way  i've found few far between lately   it's list go to spots but would dine again  now know huge portions take easier next time around  <EOR> Love place sushi great quality service always point! reverse happy total bargain love vegan menu! area restaurant sits very elegant quiet  Please try them cheers Saki sangria's!! <EOR> I came during happy hour surprisingly dead  party three another family only people there  seated promptly however service terrible  disappointing considering waitress should taken advantage slow business  She also extremely shy she rarely checked us  Usually wouldn't mind but water running hot Vegas during summer dry bone  started stealing sister's water  Also waitress wasn't available flag down another waiter bring plates  terrible service would only given place three stars but came another time before big group friends served waitress named Sara she absolutely amazing!

Absolutely  Hopefully choices more wheelhouse next time  <EOR> Kabuki great  When am traveling between Vegas Cali love stop Kabuki's sushi  same quality service matter which location to  am big fan <EOR> We Kabuki party definitely good restaurant groups  moment walked door service friendly above average  waitress marched own drum but she made lol several times more capable accommodating all requests etc  funniest part she asked if b'day because gifts told going away party friends asked if anything special could do  died when dinner brought vanilla ice cream happy b'day heart written chocolate syrup 6 them sang Japanese some sort jingly accoutrements   food!    ordered standard edamame also garlic one  Both very good own rights  garlic smells very very garlicky when 1st comes somewhat apprehensive but delish  all enjoyed miso soup even those aren't soup people   ordered plate sesame chicken table share ok would better if white meat  salt kinda girl but walking thin line being salty  sesame ginger dipping sauce didn't help side self proclaimed famous teriyaki sauce dying sweeter balance!   Surprisingly wasn't sweet when all said done opted dip soy sauce  just seemed alot work appetizery dish! ordered several sushi rolls all which well received taste buds tummies  also order chicken teriyaki order beef to please meat  potatoes guys   skimpy meat point made oxymoron declaration I'd never heard them quiet! munched away  addition happy b'day ice cream ordered chocolate squares divvy it's scored easy share   unusual scrumptious  fact I'd back just dessert menu few other items I'd try! blown away?

Ashley waitress very friendly does excellent job  Highly recommend! <EOR> I've couple times  Food good service kind disorganized  many tables enough staff  aren't really attentive when need check    Also stopped going incident bathroom  waitresses came stall while heading she didn't even wash hands! Talk disgusting  yes she used bathroom flushed toilet but did wash hands before leaving     Never back  4 5 months since eating there  <EOR> Went kabuki play date tivoli  9 able sit shortly table prepared  kid friendly kids menu  service typical any chain restaurant attentive responsive  am always skeptical mainstream Japanese restaurants try serve extensive menu  both cooked food sushi ramen udon  lunch specials reasonably priced few good options  daughter loves udon passed taste test flying colors  hamachi Kama yellowtail collar size more enough but maybe little over cooked ponzu little off taste  also chicken salmon teriyaki combo which little overcooked but great portion price  high expectations sushi rarely order chain type restaurants didn't here  ramen snobs well unless recommended specialty item last page menu stay away  good selection rolls might good place casual sushi eater  would suggest restaurant good lunch spot lunch happy hour menu  good mainstream Japanese selections but nothing exceeded relatively high expectations  Overall good enough  We'll back <EOR> Bottom line    the mushy rice means 2 stars   done   Owners reading reviews?  Mushy rice seems popular critique  <EOR> Had dinner recently   Very nice atmosphere good service   Dishes kitchen excellent   Gyoza crisp tasty   Great sauce  Slightly spicy sesame   Miso soup excellent  wife's teriyaki tempura plentiful quite well done   Tempura lightly coated dried perfectly   Unfortunately sushi poor   Now actual fish fresh tasted fine if somewhat dull  Rice poorly seasoned   fell apart when eat   Every piece picked rice just broke apart   Spicy tuna roll spicy mostly just mushy tuna   None sushi any wasabi flavoring  Just hunk fish sat top misshapen ball rice   struggled rating   kitchen won out   would definitely come back but sushi  many good sushi places town them serve stuff here   Really shame great potential  <EOR> This sushi spot when craving sushi   Which almost 80% time  usually opt bar because don't wait seated plus because drinks over there  Sushi great staff nice friendly  only complaint don't lion king roll! Lion King roll absolute favorite roll  practically all would ever when lived California  But ever since moved Vegas lot sushi places don't carry it  when asked them if lion king roll bartender told removed menu  Super sad face! But other sushi good service good drinks good! <EOR> I think many positive reviews place more ambience location food  bad  Decent predictable Japanese fare little innovation flawlessly executed  Entrees lacking flavor else salty  deal breaker Saturday night if want enjoy Tivoli bottle sake good friend hankering Japanese  But less nothing write home about  service well serviceable  <EOR> If you're looking some good Japanese restaurant area definitely place go   Great staff great service delicious food amazing atmosphere   Not overpriced other Asian food places   Had Las Vegas roll husband salmon teriyaki lunch menu  food came really quick could see everything really fresh   Keep nice work guys  Definitely coming back try other rolls  <EOR> So Kabuki daughters 25th birthday celebration Tim waiter made night excellent!!!

entree 2 appetizer  Overall good value lunch enjoy food  <EOR> This definitely more ABC Japanese fare chain but say pleased all food   I really enjoyed garlic edamame which salty garlicky some nice red peppers give extra kick     The sesame chicken hit among  friends   perfectly seasoned fried   Unlike most sesame chicken which tossed sauce served dry dipping sauce     With party 12 pretty much ordered everything   sashimi combination platters koshou beef soba unagi rolls everything really good   You're going Monta quality noodles Kabuto expertise regards sushi but place great big parties safe introduction anyone experienced eating Japanese   The food really good location Tivoli Village really nice  <EOR> Pros Brown rice substitute everything Wide variety menu items Large selection speciality rolls Food portions generous Great decor chill atmosphere Children friendly high chair available Clean restrooms Accommodating large group  Cons Brown rice bit hard Dessert took longer come actual entrees rolls Green tea mochi portion seemed very small  Overall very good experience  Would come back! <EOR> i soft opening yelp event   loved night every other night been   brought bf try loved it   love sushi now sushi spot nearby   kabuki platter bomb! i'd love try those boat things   The last times Happy hour order everything off menu   stuffed that! bad all! <EOR> This chain initially found California then when saw Summerlin knew luck   very good sushi although part restaurant favorite thing Tivoli Village while am eating scrumptious sushi valet clean car inside out  Anyways back Kabuki   Always good food elegant atmosphere   recommend Hawaiian Roll Salmon Skin roll   Both great  <EOR> Attended birthday family couple months ago   There's no lack quick service good food artistic interior design any Kabuki Japanese restaurants   Burbank CA also awesome   Makes cool place any other special occasion even mothers fathers day   bar television sports fans   This restaurant pleasantly located Tivoli Village across parking structure arches above ground   Gotta see area night especially   during winter holidays really pretty   Craving Japanese food looking meal somewhere hangout afterwards indoors outdoors?  going here  <EOR> Good location date night offer vegetarian menu  service very slow best but worth food  Ordered fried tofu rolls which pretty good sauce awesome  Would back if area <EOR> Been twice   Friendly service very good sushi prices   Most rolls basic California roll base but venture off traditional path talk server find very nice flavorful meals     The prices  shockingly low both times walked full bellied empty wallet   I better sushi but stop family friends great choice   I really loved Albacore Crunch roll crispy spicy tuna appetizer great   All bottle cold sake  <EOR> My daughter love eating kabuki always great service most all food always point  <EOR> Too bad  really wanted try place because heard great happy hour   I understand places busy but when don't acknowledge your customers they've sat down least 5 10 minutes don't deserve patronage  place big know server assigned table passed least few times   I waited 5 minutes  Then another 5  even drink order napkin down    Not cool  <EOR> Clean pleasantly decorated Japanese Restaurant beautiful Tivoli Village  enjoy specialty Sushi rolls green tea ice cream wonderful  Sometimes service gets slow but staff always pleasant  few servers just need pay more attention tables section  always order fast don't think Sushi chefs  But getting refill tea ordering additional items require flag down waitress  enough stop coming but management can't improve without honest feedback  more consistently attentive servers I'd given 5 stars  <EOR> Stopped eat last week advice friend   chose sit sushi bar  Friday night very busy   2 seats bar  Decorative place nice atmosphere again very busy  took abmormal amount time drinks order  sitting awating drinks kept getting bumped pushed servers grabbing sushi plates bar  extremely frustrating  should server pick area continually reaching over patrons choose sit bar  Drinks arrrive finally bring complimentary edamame  sat kept getting wiffs some great smelling fish  definitely good sign   ordered tuna appetizer jalapeos  Flavor ok but fish very fatty should served imo   Drinks point draft beer served 8oz glass doesnt last very long again took forever flag down server forever them   ordered food directly sushi chef   ordered 3 rolls total   All just ok all rushed  could really tell didn't put much effort into it   Sushi rolls fell completely apart before could eat them   Meanwhile bad fish smells still hitting every few minutes  Probably won't back  should really consider revising policy servers picking food over your head entire meal  should also consider more training into rolling rolls edible just pile fish rice your plate  Overall service needs help food presentation needs help food quality needs help   Beer should served 12oz glasses larger least option choose larger size which never gave us  <EOR> This favorite places eat tivoli's   great appetizers delicious sushi sushi always fresh if little bit spicy peppers would try shishito Peppers they're delicious sweet  great Korean short ribs which delicious  Even though volleyball rather dead most time still way over service pretty quick also delicious hot sake <EOR> The host kalee very kind polite  definitely coming back terrific service received  <EOR> Only spider roll but very good  failing understand however why need add imitation crab salad w mayo everything  Requested leave out  friends each full mains which all looked decent  wine selection bit funky hard time finding anything hit spot  Place all but empty @ 7pm Tues night but maybe  Tivoli rolls mid week  <EOR> Since birthday Kabuki uploaded $15 r t Red Mask Club card Kuya agreed celebrate Tivoli establishment   Unfortunately experience seemed training new staff priority   instance since offered take trays but no refills waters Kuya decided serve himself   Thus highly recommend strategic management plans action re assess re evaluate staffing training especially your new employees   conclusion would prevent others experiencing same issues  <EOR> Apparently chain restaurant but given expectations     Staff exceptionally friendly hostess Bobby sushi bar waiter   Free sample cold soup don't know name free edamame sushi bar nice surprise   Sushi rolls big delicious well presented   nice reverse happy hour night made many items cheaper   Waiter very attentive brought new water every time finishing current glass   menu most items bright pictures would no ambiguity ordering   sake bar which check another time    back! <EOR> Cute place  However wasn't terribly excited over sushi  rather bland most part just ok  <EOR> As frequent visitor opening restaurant found disturbing when denied booth two first time thank  Bruno    Change menu
