When called complain pizza mention lack cheese peppers repeat complaint two different people! assuming manager last speak he very very rude!! Telling normally don't automatically cheese peppers hand because staying grand view resort which furnished condos  Any hotel furnished condo idiot!! resort does differ hotel any way other reservations fees  guy assumed resort also meant full stocked fridge pantry order save money having driver always carry peppers cheese???   Not mention complaint pizza also taken lightly! told first person complain food 20 years!! Maybe because customers normally already drunk time pizza late night no difference them  guy then proceeded tell could call back morning repeat complaint day manager  ordered pizza 830pm good calling next morning going disgusting dinner!! told would send driver 30 miles deliver better pizza  Um Did he realize could google them see only 8 miles away! even if far why would advertise under door if willing drive us! never such horrible service food!!  I guess Little Italy Pizza doesn't care customer service customer retention because market hotels resorts which contain people only few days time! Very very disappointed place if could would flyers placed under each resort hotel door review them    I would definitely suggest Rosati's Pizza instead! aren't open late night but if you're looking decent pizza dinner vacation would suggest Rosati's  Save Little Italy Pizza your drunken nights If absolutely don't any other choice  <EOR> got bbq chicken specialty  pizza  arrived hot great  fast delivery friendly service  good pizza option lv delivery  <EOR> Open late fast friendly cheap pizza wings hot sandwiches  Halal place China town  <EOR> This place really good  staff very kind helpful  recommend place if you're looking pizza Vegas  <EOR> This favorite burger places  All items halal  double cheeseburgers turkey bacon die for  Pizza nice too  Location atmosphere particularly best but deliver  <EOR> Great cheeseburger buffalo chicken pizza!
