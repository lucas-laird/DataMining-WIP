The food average Thai Vegas   lot Thai places generally good bad but surely  standout   order expected salad wanted shredded pork   sure phonetically spelled Thai description dish noted shredded pork but written English rest ingredients   Every ingredient described English except pork   Weird   decor slightly better blah effort least service slightly worse mediocre place smelled smoke   didn't smell cigarette smoke but instead building once ablaze leftover odor combo smoke cleaning supplies   much better Thai Vegas same price  <EOR> Always fresh quality tasty Thai food        the Panang Green Curry awesome  top 5 Thai restaurants n Las Vegas!  Staff helpful professional   Restaurant clean very nicely decorated   Great families friends or business lunches  <EOR> I never disappointed Thai food restaurant one   Usually judge Thai place pad see ew  So right ordered pad see ew  A good thing noticed price very reasonable but think trap     LIFE RULE pay for   This place worst pad see ew ever eaten life  The noodles hard undercooked much salty flavor  I ordered chicken chicken raw inside  When waitress saw unfinished food she just looked didnt ask anything  She just took plate left check everything fine dandy   My co worker ordered pad thai she didnt either   She said way sweet noodles soft  It also noted both palest pad thai ever seen lives  No color whatsoever!?! Ive eating Thai food loooooooooong time  Ive even Thailand twice Pad Thai should reddish tint Paprika  At least thats know over 30 examples ever eaten life   Also Thai iced tea lot particulates meaning didnt filter correctly tea something wasnt clean   For such nicely decorated place totally surprised lack quality control   With all problems coming food suspect owners dont really know cook Thai food and or run proper shop  From other reviews seems its family restaurant heres some advice owners Just cause cook good home family friends does mean should open restaurant  First study your craft carefully pay attention every detail   Positives Decorated nicely but shouldnt judge book its cover   Negatives Food shady location service   With bad food shady location unattentive service end many other good Thai restaurants area ever eat again   Thanks but no thanks  <EOR> Had carry twice now  Both times food very good  people extremely nice  Very clean quiet also  sat waited order brought water table  plan going dining soon  <EOR> Very tasty very professional!  Don't fooled slightly dirty parking lot very clean inside employees kind helpful   always able help select something new tasty menu   So far mostly pad see ew pad thai sesame chicken salad silver noodle salad I'd recommend them anyone   prices very reasonable well usually enough left over take lunch next day   Be sure check place out! <EOR> Never dish didn't here! co workers always order here!  quick staff awesome  though sometimes hard understand because accent   pop sticker's delicious!   Thai food all time Rise! <EOR> Great soup pad Thai beautiful decor   glad tried place can't wait come back  <EOR> Tried beef Penang good   But good Lotus Siam <EOR> WOW!!! unexpected pleasant surprise  driving decided try  Restaurant wonderful peaceful decoration food second none!!! Best Thai food had  service flawless  <EOR> Stopped lunch today coworker   Initial impression great decor very contemporary restaurant clean    The selection lunch specials wasn't extensive other spots town but first visit wanted try range old standbys anyway   Ordered Pork Larb Chicken Pad Thai Chicken Red Curry   with all dishes being 3 4 1 5 spice scale coworker doesn't super spicy  Prior food being served waiter brought small sample Egg Drop Soup Crispy Noodles which nice touch  Pork Larb served first   Nothing particularly remarkable   usually shy away Larbs incorporate mint leaves but Larb used just enough provide some complexity without being overpowering   pork overdone think would pretty solid Larb  The Pad Thai Red Curry came short wait Curry being accompanied very modest portion rice   Pad Thai probably highlight meal   good flavor heavy scallions although certainly wasn't winning any awards   Red Curry completely uninspired   nice rich color good amount both meat vegetables albeit little heavy bamboo but once mouth flavor flat quite salty no noticeable spice level 4  I probably would stop quick lunch service attentive but kitchen little more leisurely   However probably stop again dinner try some other dishes   example large bowl soup served neighboring table looked quite good   Based first experience feel Stick E Rice overdelivers ambiance underdelivers food  <EOR> On recent trip Las Vegas lucky try Stick E Rice part large group    service impecable food simply delicious     impressed selection dishes offered sampled large portion menu     Nothing let down    recommend restaurant anyone truly loves homemade Thai food      wish location Ohio!

Midweek only though  Portions perfect amount food egg flower soup  Nice modern decor very clean everyone friendly  Music slow relaxing jazz create calm environment but almost fell asleep! best part right next door Foxy Nails which Yelpers also gave great reviews way now  <EOR> What pleasant surprise !

Good food nice service clean place   but kinda smell smoke maybe because bar next door  <EOR> Visited Vegas L A  searched good Thai restaurant sweet sticky rice most places back home don't serve when mango season  problem Stick E Rice     wide variety sweet sticky rice desserts   Terrific Thai tea tastes ginger great curries beautiful ambiance modern generic strip mall    wisely ask name your spice level    chose 4 some serious spice moments but really enhanced flavor made appreciate Thai tea   It's strip but great spot if you're looking Thai pricey Vegas standards  Also don't liquor license    don't expect beers!

If could grant place 4 5 stars would quickly happily so  spent last few minutes debating review wife absolutely convinced Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars   This restaurant several strong points  service truly amazing  Every time come pleasure being served same waitress whose friendly greetings smiles feel member family  waitstaff always point timing courses well clearing used dishes promptly  Drink refills typically issue unless you're only drinking water but never leave wanting refill   reason soft drinks served ice cold cans accompanied cold glasses filled ice  know restaurants typically may profit more serving soft drinks cans but feel better establishments provide fountain drinks free refills   I ordered potstickers appetizer VERY tasty lack excessive doughiness served many other restaurants  don't know if they're homemade but tell surely can't wrong placing order them   I typically order lunch special menu meal accompanied complimentary soup  egg drop soup tasty served attractive cup side crispy chow mein chips  once rendition hot sour soup honestly say needs much work resemble true Chinese hot sour soup   The main courses always flavorful  portions may seem small but upon finishing order am always very satisfied  pepper steak orange chicken pad thai mixed vegetable options wonderful entrees  wife's regular favorite entree mixed vegetables added shrimp  simply must leave room dessert!  Stick E Rice offers dessert called Stick E Mango absolutely must have! order every time come here  Every time  sticky rice formed sushi sized pieces bear almost banana like sweetened flavor coconut  Each order seemingly bombarded sliced mango! mango always sweet succulent never unpleasantness biting into more green hardened slice mango  mango drizzled sweetened coconut caramel  absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice less 3 star rating!
