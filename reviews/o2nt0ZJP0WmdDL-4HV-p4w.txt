Lindo bland loud only Desert Inn location     Carlitos due another chance since moved Sunset but new location proved good original location   Had Don Juan around downtown wasn't impressed but someone told new location Sunset better   Overall food okay   Nothing would drive separate trip     Pro pork tamale good cheese enchiladas   tamale enchilada style   Extra 3 50 otherwise dry  Beef taco decent seasoning  Beans rice pretty much standard fair nothing special   Chips standard fare nothing unique fresh them  Salsa probably weakest all   Watered down real appealing   served bean purée no seasoning all   As ice tea drinker tea weak just tasted water   Switched Coke instead   My friend same opinion food   Would back?

We mango margarita house margarita rocks lemonade  All extremely tasty refreshing   Being mood surf turf ended 2 folks ordering steak shrimp  steak thin flat iron steak cooked until melted your mouth  Shrimp grilled perfection  third person ordered fish fillets  delicate flavors amazing  Even though food amazing real experience came staff  Everyone attentive caring funny warm inviting  later evening could've rushed snubbed being close closing time but welcomed very well cared for  If lived area would often! Don't miss gem! <EOR> We excited prospect good Mexican restaurant area impatiently waited Casa Don Juan open  interior decor updated servers new uniforms  server very attentive but atmosphere relaxing all while dining  Unfortunately felt food mediocre best  tamales very difficult open  accomplished tamale itself ball flavorless paste almost no filling inside  awful did eat them  beans rice lacked flavor even chips salsa very bland  Hubby's fajitas sparse amount very tough beef prices high quality food  keep waiting good Mexican restaurant open area  <EOR> To start sincerity fairness food fresh tasty  overall environment gave illusion friendliness  resturant clean   So why only star   ??? Well unfortunately saying only takes bad apple spoil entire bowl   Customer service key   competitive world Mexican restaurants servers also alway looking work review may something consider  A Sunday 3pm relatively empty restaurant  small table but extremely large party either  placed orders which seemed take extended period time  least 2 refills chips 2 drink refills   Then finally food arrives!  Then 3 plates incorrect  The first notice sees right away  Tells server CARLOS  He instantly replied know ordered   Then told ok wanting item sounded just  please instead   He again replayed no know ordered   He hands shoulder he telling this  Which am taking very aggressive now  He then moves serving others leaving plate no assistance correct it    then husband  ask please other item  which CARLOS places hands shoulders again says no can't  ordered understand  if exchange pay PAY  did misunderstand CARLOS said 5 witnesses sign off this    Then order another plate originally wanted PAY ADDITIONAL it   Plus other two plates mixed CARLOS tried pull off people tables fault again  He even tried give person bitten into item food swap plates  Due fact would know until open food inside Ok part but then CARLOS tells blatant lie  When asked table asked if want desserts  person said sure complimentary? He said no  She said no then   just thought maybe giving special treat complimentary dessert something  which CARLOS said talk owner  She front Mexican dress flowers hair  Pointing hostess  Now completing meal  Approaching asking hostess if she owner she stated No  She bartending if would her  The owner bartending never front where he pointed alluded to  She bar entire time he mentiomed cannot see inside bar area resturant  So could she considered front   sure if your trying condescending look liar if someone actually asks   Summarized stated beginning food cleanliness great  Service CARLOS negative 0  Why? Defensiveness before apologizing  Never trying correct problem Never bringing management over correct problem  Touching customer when defending yourself    Especially placing your hands top shoulders while seated your behind them  aggressive behavior towards person  Intentional Misdirection person authority management   I believe sum enough  sad cannot reccoment such place anyone such employee  food good  <EOR> Like its predecessors place ok but great   high hope heard other location good   From start annoyed comedian waiter   Hello name Juan but Juan   Take drink order?   Yes diet coke ok Dr pepper     every time he came let Dr pepper refill   Haha great except time actually did bring wrong refill   I ordered tamale very hard open   no tamale ever past more ball shape   No filling just made   The rest meal ok   great but ok   But Super Mex which turned Jalisco same owner almost expected same average food just slightly pricer   Will back?  More likely no  <EOR> Amazing food incredible service! come several times since they've opened everyone always greets we're returning family members  food just awesome! Tried many parts menu always consistently best food Vegas  Could give higher recommendation look forward coming back family over over again  <EOR> We always Casa down town but recently opened location old Jalisco mexican restaurant   Inside completely redecorated very very festive   service very point someone always walking tables constantly removing plates refilling salsas chips making sure your drinks filled   food point decent portions compared prices very tasty  find food little better tasting $1 $3 cheaper per plate Lindo chain  Our only complaint when asked some spicy salsa meals told extra charge   We keep coming back   Also take note many times find groupon down town location  pretty decent deal  <EOR> Yep personal favorite    new area love place   pomegranate margarita rocks alone worth visit   enchiladas green sauce which delicious!  rellenos also yummy   definitely recommend!
