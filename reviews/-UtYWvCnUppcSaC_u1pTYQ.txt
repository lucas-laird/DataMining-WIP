Kitchen closed! no food stunk ass bartenders horrible attitudes! would suggest just close place down!! TWO THUMBS DOWN!! <EOR> This place pretty good   mixologist Julia very knowledgeable GREAT positive attitude   She very friendly genuine talked other patrons bar if she's known years   mostly locals hanging vibe pretty laid back relaxing   bottle IPA cost only $3 50   definitely plan visiting again soon!    The only caution hungry   says Restaurant but food    only negative thing say it   Otherwise would highly recommend! <EOR> Stopped quick pop see friend waiting us   Beers came big glasses comped over because playing video poker bar machines   cool that?  Two free beers lose $25 machines while drinking but good time talking getting caught nice air conditioned place great service  <EOR> I come quite often haven't single bad experience  drinks delicious calm atmosphere Ali best  soon walk drink ready  hard find good place town where just relax take breather  <EOR>
