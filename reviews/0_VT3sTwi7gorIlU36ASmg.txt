Definitely biggest play places most variety things do    However only giving 4 stars because price tag place absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!! actually wasn't going come all being good 20ish minute drive house PLUS $30 price tag just two kids  CHARGE ADULTS! What?! Why?!  insane  never ever heard indoor playgrounds charging adults! First parent free if plan bringing anyone else plan spending additional $5 PER ADULT   I'm happy gave place try but definitely only coming when older school husband work  I'd rather take them comparable less expensive Kangamoo Fun Lane when whole family     Also because huge price tag admission definitely deterrent ordering any food here  isn't really worth $50+ admission food drinks  When Chuck E Cheese Peter Piper Pizza food play packages less that   LOL would totally complete 5 Star package if lowered admission completely stopped charging adults! would more inclined spend more money once inside food drinks etc    Until then just special occasions when only child me  <EOR> Place ok  i think don't  What pay   It's over priced  $52 2 kids  The Question why parents  To pay ???  There nothing matches  Age   Except watching  kids   Not Fair   Food also very Expensive   <EOR> The staff needs better job regulating toddler area  girl didnt look 4 under climbing car climb onto 2 ft edge ball pit used it    pulled down shirt then gave attitude it rolled eyes waved arm snapped fingers when said excuse me  prior she already made move she climb over wall into dining area  totally ruined night  contemplating entire time whether speak mother kid apologize     but she large party celebrating birthday  some older kids also throwing balls really hard air blowing volcano took while staff kick out  When people check should tell people kids read rules mindful other ppl  first time checking never even told review rules  kid did enjoy place though  kangamoox3  food isnt bad way better chuck e cheese its actual cafe restaurant    lot options    all cooked fresh order  place would come only once while though because cost lot more other indoor playgrounds which understandable why   maybe guys consider monthly bundles stay home moms wouldnt mind bringing kids more often during weekdays  <EOR> Threw sons party just now awesome!!

However besides keeping eye your child during busy times big red slide could use some staff supervision  Children just flying down another without bottom being secured  Therefore people sliding into another knocking each other down sometimes causing injury   Other fun environment very tasty LOL burger  <EOR> My first time 2 year old  She such great time! very packed but staff manages place well sure your toddler doesn't hurt alone cute toddler ball slide area strictly enforce toddlers  did buy food seemed pricey lines long  When buy ticket leave re enter which plus well! <EOR> My review based experience? party planning hosting place    A month before daughter's birthday party little family inside check ask some questions  before but never inquired parties  SISSY kind enough show prices answer any questions had  thing she mentioned book party soon very busy weekends  booked child's party January 13th online  When book party tells wait confirmation e mail  waited 2 days didn't receive any confirmation e mail  called every day once even spoke someone said she would confirm party supposed receive email confirmation  Thinking party Feb 11 all set tried put guest list again said party confirmed  tried calling them week half no answer?  left voicemails? called multiple times even work see going party  Just when ready call quits cancel Amanda called gave peace mind party going without problem  truly stress reply them  spoke Amanda Jan 31st would e mail back forth regarding upcoming? party  just 1 week 1 2 away able give them details regarding? food other things needed day  added extra food Thursday before party when dropped off decorations  When first toured Sissy she gave brochure pictures front prior parties decorations mentioned wanted arch balloons party well like picture brochure she said could absolutely accommodate? that  Thursday? before party again mentioned Sissy brought balloons things arch she said ourselves? because charge $1 blow any kind balloons just helium  great detail she forgot mention time toured playground   The day party everything seemed going smooth until checked entered room spoke party host  main reasons rooms did the first 2 rooms because Sissy mentioned play Netflix? put Trolls movie on  Come find didn't wi fi can't play Netflix  guests figure connect phone television order play movie  allowed room 20 minutes before party started rooms booked 7 30 PM 9 30 PM   party host did great job decorations cake die for! food good! Although yet another miscommunication didn't add food previous? mentioned Thursday? party pay 3 pizzas 1 tray sandwiches $113 more  honest irritated but already expecting more people it  staff just kept saying sorry but didn't offer anything else but that  liked party host she did good job but suggestion any future parties If party more room should consider having 2 party hosts overhemled everything needed  only party booked room day time  main selling points would handle everything could enjoy party but least case  wouldn't come back book party anytime soon but would definetly come back play eat here  Highly recommend pesto alfredo BLT croissant pizza if cake made here! children enjoyed see Juju the panda mascot    I would say over $1 000+ spent deluxe package worth much miscommunication stress   great job but them  feel trusting initially told wasn't worried much until everything started downhill    I add names party host chef later am currently waiting e mail Amanda details  <EOR> Awesome indoor playground kids  spent 3 hours could've stayed longer! also impressed food expecting frozen good food but all pretty tasty large variety! Definitely place kids birthday parties at  Admission $30 1 adult 2 kids  many different jungle gyms slides ball pits etc  bringing nephews back!

Another thing leaving facility should some type security system  walked kids cousins kids  know those kids? should stamp thing CEC check if wristbands same #s  could definitely potential problem    Also prices higher most places but big cold CLEAN! Regardless think would more business if don't charge multiple adults if charge bit less overall  $16 95 first child $12 95 additional kids  $5 2nd adult  does cost lot when multiple kids  Entrance food would definitely break bank would allow families come often they'd like    Change your prices bet you'll business lot longer think    Overall good experience  understand soft opening  definitely some improvements work on  <EOR> First time blast  Super clean which nice  Employees great  Especially amber!!!
