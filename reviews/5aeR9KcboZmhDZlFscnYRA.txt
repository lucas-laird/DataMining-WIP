There's restaurant seating area well atrium seating area  Free wi fi  Happy employees  menu small yet satisfying  wonderful smoothies made boost energy re hydrate  also good selection healthy wraps  taco wrap BLT wrap aren't listed menu  haven't taco wrap yet but BLT wrap yummy  Inside hummus like spread tomatoes bacon neatly wrapped fresh piece lettuce    So why say bacon ? Becuase actually dehydrated eggplant  marinated something salty   perhaps soy sauce? definitely consistency bacon  greasy overwhelming bacon though  delicious! friend front asked made bacon   Turns sell little 1 oz  packages! Win!  The fresh coconut water $3  fan packaged coconut water sold stores because taste artificial me  But Fresh Mama sold actual coconut convenient hole straw  Perfect way replenish those electrolytes losing them hot yoga!   But best item Fresh Mama sells quinoa salad  Oh goodness gracious  First bite heavens open angels sing full choir  Perfectly cooked quinoa bits dried cranberries other fresh ingredients  seriously buy tubful stuff scarf down there's no tomorrow! must try this!  The only issue place little pricey  But expected ingredients use food  recently Living Social deal place  Apparently rewards program through Perkville which yet register for  <EOR> It took forever order taken  guy behind counter takes order then walks away  When receive order all wrong when brought attention he want argue me   Then another coworker comes over try help he leave then tells cowork just trying things free but when already paid order  paid avacado none there  Why should charge extra receive it   gone before many times but when see guy working return establishment  <EOR> Really cool atrium area hang in  enjoyed smoothie though pretty pricey  However snagged slice pie dessert case OMG GOOD!  It supposed raw key lime pie but tasted more cheesecake  Delicious though $6 slice weekend treat rather regular pit stop  <EOR> ATTN IF $10 GROUPON Don't buy wrap + juice use your Groupon    I ordered wrap juice which came $11 46 I approximated cents   I paid $5 $10 Groupon thought wow only paid $6 46 meal      all dreams shattered   The cashier said he cannot honor Groupon both if order wrap smoothie together HELLO Groupon says $10 per purchase per item!! then muttered comes $5 98  If paid $5 Groupon $5 98 order saved $0 48 $10 GROUPON WTF    0 stars honoring Groupon forgetting wrap  +2 stars awesome Spicy Thai Wrap Twisted Mint juice  <EOR> There nothing better Eliza Slushie Mamas right Hot! workout!! =    Hands down feel good restaurant! See there  <EOR> This place unreal worst possible way! First all wait good 20 25 minutes your food made when there's even any business first place  wrap ordered utterly disappointing wish returned it  never served such minuscule amount food $7 99  bad excuse wrap ordered literally 1 inch diameter worth more maybe $1 50 most  finished wrap noticed place also sells favorite kombucha  really excited until register purchase realized $5! Overall place just worth it  Only if don't mind spending $8 measly snack best beverage $5  <EOR> This place absolutely amazing! Before into wanna start fact its very misleading when people post reviews place clearly state into raw vegan food then continue bash place being overpriced filling   someone very into raw vegan food tell place expensive quality ingredients each smoothie wrap would honestly cost same amount if tried things myself  Plus innovative create flavors delicious dishes would never even thought of! terms healthy food more expensive less quality  terms filling place certainly full off smoothie wrap separately but then again if aren't used eating way then yes maybe won't full but then hit McDonald's if clearly going dismiss nutrition full factor Now onto review food jungle storm red rabbit smoothie each delicious very large container sizes also see them add ingredients themselves which always like  baja wrap collard green outside instead tortilla best wrap vegan not ever eaten! Absolutely delicious flavorful even little spicy  only thing say off menu items kale chips desserts etc little pricey but absolutely delicious high quality organic raw cannot resist! Especially when Cheesecake Factory charges $7 slice why instead raw strawberry cheesecake slice $6 which amazing very filling! couldn't even finish sitting! also kale chips which very good best actually put ingredients back if into reading labels am! Overall very friendly staff asking tons questions things very helpful kind even gave free cup smoothie!   I 100% recommend place everyone should supporting healthy businesses this! <EOR> First time ate meal here   taco salad cilantro dressing   OMGosh    better some   Service smile quick  Also vanilla latte soy milk   Very good   Very very good  should taken pic but ate meal way quick   Honestly   Try place  Youll pleased  <EOR> Got knock Fresh Mama down 2 stars original 4 star review why   I only order ahead me   Took them 15 minutes give Taco Salad another 10 minutes give Red Rabbit Smoothie   Reason being while lady preparing salad some not as fresh romaine lettuce would expect $7 99 before tax salad should other lady busy chit chattin'    worst part   The worst part favorite smoothie world coconut shells it   cautious accidentally bite shell may hit nerve ending result migraine happened before shrimp shells am very careful shell anything   total four pieces coconut shell spitted out   When chatter box made smoothie noticed she dumped whatever left plastic container coconut meat smoothie   Wrong move lady   Conclusion Meh   experience better Fresh Mama time around  <EOR> As regular Vegas Hot appreciate option quick snack smoothie   favorite Coco Cat Cow    5 99 little pricey could little bigger but use your perk points $1 off    also appreciate water bottle refill option $1   just love minty lemon water especially hot class   mention place beautiful inside all plants Mediterranean feel  <EOR> While want love super healthy all natural vegan place can't help but wanting more paid  7 99 wrap 7 99 smoothie felt very pricey counter order wrap no meat obviously vegan place though   single item very filling would suggest smoothie better value wrap   They should bring back some sort combo deal think would generate lot more interest  While 2 items 10 dollars clearly loss them smoothie wrap combo 13 would really help add value purchase   The tastiest thing called Ra Reo Pie which all natural raw oreo pie  wraps smoothies while tasting extremely healthy mediocre taste    Disclaimer vegan anything but craving something healthy  <EOR> This review ONLY based spicy thai wrap   Even though VH! 3 5 times week always rush never time kill Fresh Mama       well lets face always want something meaty some ice cream classes   Anyways boyfriend done class time kill before another class  decided try Fresh Mama  Shockingly BF's 1st time too despite going VH! almost 2 years   I spicy thai wrap bit o smoke dressing sauce  It  was  amazing!  Especially bacon bits which dried spicy eggplant  fact think bacon more real bacon  crazy wasn't meat    it crunchy smoking real bacon    but without guilt fatness    Excited roomies friends eat they're vegan vegetarian respectively  <EOR> Ate yoga Vegas Hot very hot afternoon  Twisted Mint Dragon Smoothie cooled off Verdi Florentine wrap held over until dinner  buddy split two $9 99   $2 less other places Fresh Mama's smoothies also contain fewer ingredients  Twisted Mint Dragon more fluid used but liked it  those keep stirring shaking once your table   The wrap awesome  wrapped tightly delicious smear fresh veggies no carbs   Service great atmosphere invited community  lady friends talked while counter nothing  Good fun  <EOR> Fresh Mama conveniently located under Vegas Hot! yoga studio great place re energize work grab healthy smoothies Spicy Thai wrap home with   don't vegan enjoy place!  wouldn't stay eat hot yoga personally I'd slightly unsanitary  <EOR> God would hate dietary restrictions  mean try eat healthy whenever possible but raw food just unappetizing  Yeah know good me  good eat walnut puree instead meat good eat strawberries within 12 minutes them being picked but whatever food cooked    So  attitude general towards raw food review comes attitude  being said Fresh Mama seriously lacking  juices couple times today wrap  wrap itself juiced its contents all over hands lap  Let tell those contents weren't good when cohesive unit  really weren't good when being eaten parts fingers    In short remain unconvinced  <EOR> I bought groupon restaurant because recently vegan im trying all places town serve vegan vegetarian raw menus  pleasantly surprised prices even without groupon!

salads offer pretty good though prepackaged  fun jiggling around congealed dressing Tuscany salad  wouldn't say FULL full when finished meals maybe just fatty but satisfied  <EOR> A very tranquil setting offers fresh healthy eating options  Tried Red Rabbit smoothie  Consisted beets other healthy ingredients  Added scoop pea protein help rebuild muscles  Next visit plan trying some healthy food options  spicy Thai wrap looks promising  Great friendly customer service smile  <EOR> tried place groupon far liked everything place  best thing fresh coconut water tastes just home when used em coconut tree guy philippines would just climb tree u coconuts few dollars  restaurant pretty big really convenient when nest yoga studio to  really loved Peach smoothie tasted good obvious ingredients really fresh  would preferred could put more spread wrap though  wish bring back combo though coz they're more pricy side guessed costs eat healthy  <EOR> My first experience Fresh Mama okay wasn't 5 star but wasn't 2 star either  experience last night felt worth posting experience   My first visit during lunch time while service incredibly slow lot foods very much enjoyed food  staff helpful answering questions dietary restrictions finding accommodations   My visit last night just annoying  checked Yelp business hours didn't want drive way late evening just fulfill pregnancy craving  Closing Friday 9pm  Cool  1 5 hours plenty time    When lots people walking around restaurant but looked cleaning  sign door said Friday hours 'til 6pm    sign other door said hours until 9pm Friday  door wasn't locked fact cracked open  vehicle walked in   As soon opened door employee barked 'we're closed     close 8pm Fridays'  husband points hours painted windows time listed yelp  Again barked 'we're working fixing that '  I impression other yelp reviews now own experience employees just kinda things go  own hours open close when feel it    Recommendation call before eat    might no food knows if they'll even open  <EOR> Smoothie smoothie smoothie  place some most epic smoothies life  No sugar added they're perfectly blended replenish vitamins your body craving  favorite Red Rabbit which beets coconut meat vanilla  prefer add Sun Warrior vanilla protein added kick  vegans know they're doing! <EOR> I morning wrap lunch  Inside restaurant empty but takes long long long time just 1 wrap Oder  Price over priced little wrap  Pics looks big n nice but hen wrap small 7 95   If u wanna n try should call n Oder n pick your Oder better  <EOR> Bad service literally sprayed friends face w spritzer bottle over 'bad chi'   Rediculous!

<EOR> I really want give place five stars because food SUPER yummy! Unfortunately does take long time your food place very vacant feel due empty shelving  also sense understaffed  look forward growth development  <EOR> I gave place three chances  first time food great  groupon baja wrap peach smoothie  customer service complete crap though   don't smile greet anything  rushed when ordered if question rolled eyes  Oh  last time EARTH DAY would think would special but No  kitchen even CLOSED!  K BYE  <EOR> What joke  Waited 24 minutes very slow woman hot pink hair very disappointing wrap  came 4 19 13 during lunchtime  weren't *that* many people there  ordered  lame excuse wrap which tiny barely any ingredients it  irritated waited long crap plus $7 99  See pics posted  thought interior rather cool but service slow don't nearly your money's worth  Maybe smoothies better? suggestion drive little farther Raw Cafe huge portion awesome raw vegan food  <EOR> The food decent  glad more vegetarian vegan options there  hummus wrap bit bitter taste  Also staff wasn't very knowledgeable helpful ingredients sauces  should more info into foods because some people very strict diets  <EOR> Ok come now almost every class love food but employees unfriendly can't take anymore! hate feeling annoying them coming business  usually eat squeeze workout dinner work but need new staff class customer service <EOR> I really hate write negative review but experience really stood me  Looking Yelp realize weren't only ones poor customer service experience  friend into Fresh Mama yesterday morning excited place  live close figured could place would come regularly since fits eating habits  quickly let down moment approached cashier  greet first  kindly asked recommendation wraps she listed all them annoyed manner  counterproductive  Lol  friend both ordered wrap  Mine came first  took friend over 20 minutes because forgot place wrap order  If she wouldn't asked wrap probably wouldn't ever placed order since no ever came around ask doing  food pretty good  raw vegan desserts baja blast wrap helped experience better but probably won't come back again because bad service was  such shame uncomfortable made whole dining vibe  place definitely needs some friendly warm efficient people match quality food  <EOR> If all natural person place you!  Although wasn't biggest fan prices smoothies best! I tried Hawaiian tortoise flavor tasteful  couldn't taste spinach but could tell smoothies made real fruits veggies! My co worker Red Rabbit which fruity but lot beets smoothie    The food filling but again pricing favorite mine   I BLT wrap which filling delicious  Although meat wrap wasn't bacon since didn't any decent substitute   My co worker ordered spicy thai wrap which picture mind thai wrap although does lot kick it!     Even though food took longer expected pricing little high overall tolerable experience  Pricing always going high especially when walking into all natural smoothie bar  Maybe next time we'll come before work just order smoothie! <EOR> On entering atrium vegetarian café realized visited quarters several years ago when occupied Aroma Café   warmly greeted staff member explained should order counter she would bring food us   each ordered combo included spicy Thai wrap smoothie   wraps pre made wrap itself constructed rice paper   ingredients fresh but virtually tasteless without accompanying tahini almond butter sauce     For smoothies wife chose banana bound locust spinach mango banana while opted coconut cobra banana cacao coconut water meat    While smoothies very good wraps disappointing   A rating 2 5 would most appropriate  <EOR> The smoothies good but pretty expensive   liked Thai wrap   However didn't honor $10 groupon only taking $5 off   Won't going back  <EOR> Love food smoothies! However wait time really long 20 30 minutes items quite expensive  only once month so  <EOR> Don't let hours operation open sign fool no ever assist you  tried three times now done  <EOR> This second trip local juice bar! Although vegan sister loves lifestyle  She recently came visit Orange County weekend always try tend lifestyle please her  know deep down if start grill throw steak she probably wouldn't happy might end lecturing respect your body!  She's absolutely right  why every time she comes visit FIRST STOP!!   I agree 7 99 bit pricey drink but keep mind MADE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES!! also organic produce which tends higher cost quality!   Everything delicious service kick@**!   Another good thing hot Pilates place next door! Seems fun walk next door enjoy smoothie nice workout! Something need try!
