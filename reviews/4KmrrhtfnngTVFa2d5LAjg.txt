When originally checked reviews casual option within Wynn almost scared off amount people ordered pizza didn't necessarily want food uber casual being NYC NJ certainly did fly Vegas flat bread high end cheese sauce   But guess delicious!  didn't order myself but both occasions least coworkers ordered flat bread pizza extremely delighted!  both nights tried slice each enjoyed both meatball version well Vegan roasted veggies top   The first night ordered Amazing Fava Bean Yellow Beet Salad start Veal Marsala entree   couple nights later Arugula Salad along Mushroom Crusted Salmon   could probably eat every night perfectly happy fresh delicious food!  all starts off beautiful bread basket white fava bean garlic spread don't miss trying that!!  Banfi Chianti Classico highly recommended but actually several wines list reasonably priced     Definitely dine least once if staying Wynn looking affordable but classy casual dinner option  <EOR> A casual Italian restaurant fancy ambiance  surprised find Allegro opened until 6am  Perfect those clubbing cravings munchies  located close Wynn parking garage hop skip away Wynn Encore theaters   My party 10 Thursday late dinner  pre set menu kinda thing     a dinner nightclub package if will  Some items brought table include arugula salad bosco roasted mushroom ricotta cheese white truffle oil pizza  fettuccini pasta chicken cauliflower broccoli  chicken francaise and individual sized cheesecake bite looked cupcake  perfect finish   rich but overly sweet   We also red sangria part pre set menu  FEW sips that    definitely fan red myself but party enjoyed it  I wonder white sangria taste like?

Terrific cuisine! Qualified waiters! Management changed! Extremely rude people front desk! Other compliments Allegro Wynn! <EOR> it okay  server helpful dietary restrictions gluten free vegan   food itself just kind bland  when Italian food expect bold flavors really didn't hit mark all  little disappointed  but if just rate service i'd give them 5 stars  server chef kind accommodating wish could rate higher over all  <EOR> Allegro's food tasty unique way experienced yet since am BIG fan Italian food!I able see lot people playing casino which pretty fun watch  service allegro really good but doesn't match all expectations but guy served beyond nice very helpful  ordered penne tomato sauce cheese  different other Italian dishes ate other restaurants because over baked cheese which made penne very crunchy but again best eaten  Over all really recommend people here!   Review Noah Adams <EOR> Located inside Wynn casino cute little Italian restaurant perfect late arrival Vegas open until 6 00am  Granted eating pasta 1 00 morning isn't usually advisable but when Vegas    it  pasta indeed worth it  Cooked perfect al dente rich flavor sauces whether rigatoni meatballs kale ricotta ravioli everybody enjoyed meal  chilled cucumber soup bit odd lack salt almost made spicy kick end   The big issue terse inattentive service but suppose  1am  <EOR> I thought all food Allegro really good spectacular but way over priced  Vegas strip but still doesn't right  Like everything else Wynn Allegro promoted 5 star but reality more 3  The food took FOREVER come out  price but also nothing set Allegro apart any other restaurant  Amazingly average every regard far tell  Because everything average but priced worth its weight gold doubt returning  I doubt recommend place friends family  <EOR> Went cocktails Friday night dinner Saturday night  Please reservation always people outside lined eat  2 groups waiting line brother reservations seated before did   The waitstaff friendly courteous  food delicious cocktail menu leaves wanting drink more  <EOR> Love fact vegan options let customize decisions   The good expensive? Wynn expected  service good higher end restaurant took 10 minutes water 20 minutes order  asked bread came same time meal   We customized vegan pizza mushroom menu which encouraged  mediocre best cold  When asked if liked said ok would order again  server proceeds say well its best way put menu regular cheese  If ate regular chees think would ordered soy cheese?? Think before ridiculous comments    On another note very upset restaurant serves two veal baby cow dishes  times quit serving babies   I would recommend place due price poor service mediocre food caring animal welfare  <EOR> Great spot grab drink fairly nice bite Wynn  beer menu isn't huge but some decent bottle choices interesting 750ml bottles choosy  bar tv catching game while drink dine well  liquor selection limited beer selection sure  service ok but nothing special  place because near your room necessarily destination  <EOR> Came around 1 30 morning Friday course they're sort busy  Understandable  However took forever attention waiter he left menus  food didn't take long come ordered wasn't kitchen solely wait staff    I ordered Caesar start petit filet minion potatoes au gratin asparagus sides  Yes starving  First bite into salad only thing tasted salt  maybe 4 bites put side  perfectly cooked meat inedible much salt added on  saddened this  might guess same story both side dishes    The cocktails weren't anything excited over glass champagne came sticky  Gross    I would rather eat sandwich quick 24 hour cafe right next door next time Wynn  <EOR> Food Service excellent!  Highly recommend   stopped alone while fiance conference early evening Nov 29 2016  Bartender KeAo Genuinely welcoming friendly  unlike typical  script empty half pleasantries she created inviting friendly atmosphere KeAo truly refreshing lovely ladies Wynn Encore  Marketing beside bar Jessica sorry forgot other name    also enjoyed meeting chef   delighted hear chef coming Boston next year open another Allegro Everett MA   looking forward it!

<EOR> Honestly because bartender provided such great service am giving 4 stars  first waiting list 2 people 20 minutes sat bar ordered drink finally gave never came when told them going bar  Good thing bartender extremely nice could tell she enjoyed job  ordered ravioli appetizer both ordered two different pastas actually good  wasn't fan bread basket but really did enjoy pastas  Overall did place especially if don't want spend much   PROS bartender ambiance food CONS Hostesses <EOR> Their penne pasta cooked just way it  best friend trying describe next morning only words come mouths and same time AL DENTE!!! also bianca pizza which really great  thin crust taste each every ingredient prosciutto arugula etc   spaghetti meatballs wasn't fave but friends really liked meatballs    My friends Vegas twice 3 months came both times XS  Overpriced but Vegas  close proximity although doesn't feel close end night when you're dying your heels ! <EOR> Mediocre food best very expensive price  ordered hot wings still frozen raw inside  nice enough charge but still  lasagna also cold  <EOR> Ordered lasagne mushy kind seperating but ate anyway  could tell just premade reheated  chopped meatballs filler  Later night give Wynn room service call send some Tums worst heartburn ever had  No excuse given price  <EOR> We bought show package Le Reve dinner  Dinner off prix fixe menu package which understand  appetizers table four us your choice main 3 4 options choice between serviceable red serviceable white  Came dessert choices well  Overall bad  great but if looking quick way catch dinner scrambling show could lot worse spend lot more  <EOR> I used really Allegro vegan menu  Steve Wynn used vegan but apparently reverted  Since believe things slacking  tried pizza time which no cheese marinara  would more accurately described vegetable flat bread  bread itself larger portion but little density chewiness  would order again    Last time ordered pasta faux chicken  enjoyed that  filling tasty  little heavy sitting belly  Priced $31 dollars decent option ok  Considering Wynn expectations higher  Wynn but now think am going start looking more progressive places spend money    Last thing   the cafe across carries sweet low refined sugar  Jus time program  Stevia Raw sugar  Evolve left behind  <EOR> This review specifically server named Davide  arrived restaurant around 4 30am 9 3 2012 night dancing XS club     After getting seated sister started feel cold since AC blasting restaurant  friend ours took dress shirt cover but later told man suit he cannot wear tank top restaurant  then asked man suit if there's any blanket warm cloth sister she doesn't sick  man stated didn't any blanket then suggested use napkins! napkin going keep getting cold?! Then comes Davide wonderful courteous waiter did best asking everyone if there's anything cover sister he wasn't going give  when man suit realized he needed something thus he FINALLY brought t shirt he back  Davide sister probably end getting sick  appreciate Davide's persistence!
