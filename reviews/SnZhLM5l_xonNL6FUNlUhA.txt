At first really skeptical place serving BOTH Chinese food Vietnamese food located far southwest part town   boyfriend kindly reminded am product family two cultures Chinese Vietnamese bomb pho definitely exists home    ok ok back review FOOD   In review only based off few Vietnamese items tried  1   Pho Tai Slices beef noodle soup   bad but could also better   Broth nice beefy flavor base   plate greens side looked fresh but amount impressive   understand because being side town wouldn't expect crowd want load greens anyway  2   Com Thit Nuong Charbroiled thinly sliced marinated pork rice  Visually pork nicely charred but upon chewing realized wayyy dry   healthy dunk nouc cham fish sauce side fixed that    3   Cafe Sua Da Vietnamese iced coffee   tasted quite strange me   flavor essence some sort coffee liqueur   Very weird   Conclusion think if stuck southwest side town no time Chinatown area better Vietnamese pho Grand China by     I think need back another time see Ameri nese Cuisine Americanized Chinese Food is   report back once happens  p s  server very nice efficient during Monday lunch time adventure   Poor girl work front back take orders bus tables I'd definitely cut some slack   However fellow co worker a k a homeboy asian popstar hair needed step little more help chick out  <EOR> Tasty food good price!   Pros Open 10 00 AM we need catch flight close enough airport 15 Min  drive open early Tasty food Good price easy parking  Cons Some vegetabel fresh should be <EOR> Having just read Christine's review thought I'd throw two cents   wife food Grand China very much once every two weeks   However true restaurant often sparsely populated   suspect due three things   First looks business large part carry out delivery   Second number other Chinese restaurants down Rainbow competition must pretty fierce   Finally current rough economic situation may playing part well   Christine indicated waiter did seem particularly happy see party   However experience there   true though Chinese folks known being demonstrably affectionate   Perhaps Christine's experience might arisen cultural misunderstanding   terms food experience Grand China restaurant moderately sized dining room which appears seat 50   Oddly placed partition front restaurant can't really see dining room street   don't know purpose might other maybe keep people picking carry out discomfiting dine in guests   Regardless little weird   taste food Grand China clearly cut above you'd find most Chinese places town   especially potstickers which large generous   also lightly perfectly fried Rangoon style cream cheese wontons   Another great item Moo Shu Pork   Oh way here's local's tip Grand China runs lot coupons local paper Review Journal   Thus if look Southwest View section Tuesdays Taste section Wednesdays Neon section towards back Fridays may find couple fairly decent coupons free soup half off entree place  <EOR> I tried place two years ago when served same kind food other Grand China restaurant  food okay nothing good special just Panda Express  Anyway few months ago saw ad asian newspaper expanded menu included alot more vietnamese items  visiting few times tried different items  Pho definitely good but horrible bad Pho Hoang down road  Noodle soups best vegas standard broth very flavorful  combination fried rice pretty good too  those live SouthWest place would save some driving Chinatown  Basically if think Panda Express awesome place may new menu  But if used authentic chinese vietnamese food would definitely recommend it  way when visited place first time place empty which normally good sign  But few visits realized location dark surrounding night lack advertisement cause slow business  waitress works very nice  <EOR>
