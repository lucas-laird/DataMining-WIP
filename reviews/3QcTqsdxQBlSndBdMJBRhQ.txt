Would recommend anyone looking breakfast downtown  <EOR> The best experience ever live music great beer phenomenal service  can't miss it  Nina server dream catered every need  music amazing and life changing bar least 10 times amazing  Don't stop keep jams sure visit Mondays 10pm 1am Gibson jam session $1 drafts! <EOR> Sat bar dinner Thursday night   pot roast sandwich very good ample cheese   Cooked nicely good crispy sourdough bread   Opted baked beans instead fries   beans disappointment nothing remember     The beer selection good extraordinary but sufficient   service very good except time   former bartender restaurant owner high expectations when dine out   finished first beer barely touched food wanted order another beer   sat little while shorter period probably thought while sitting there   Alyssa bartender become busy doing other tasks   When other bartender duty asked if wanted glass water friendly patron   Alyssa said she sorry happened immediately calmed down   Instead becoming customer hell became regular   She handled potentially bad situation very well job very well done!  Some people said music loud   weeknight just single guitar player   music volume enjoyable   back     Jim Kruger <EOR> Awesome new restaurant downtown open breakfast lunch dinner  live music tvs football everything tried delicious  Highly recommend chicken wings tater tots  Cool beer cocktail options too  <EOR> Food always fresh atmosphere always good! Love coming weekends when live music since early morning  <EOR> First time came some realistic expectations having good time good food some drinks brunch  Unfortunately pains tell only friend but also most people around remotely happy anything happening  few things would bring your attention management because believe concept good place lot potential  Servers need assigned specific sections facilitate speedy service  When serving bottomless mimosas use pitchers proceed quicker service tables  all eat needs change format  much appreciate presentation doesn't look really working when people ordering rate today  Maybe buffet style avoid long wait times   In addition would let know deeply disappointed local when others complained given better service  However friend decided complain hopes services would better became less busy  simply did happen those around did complain received service hoping get   Again locals would come back enjoy place believe concept potential food good  already love spending time property   Good luck hope things change better! <EOR> This place terrible  Let start saying finding close enough parking close place completely ridiculous  ended having park shady af parking garage across street  When immediate headache  band loud place small even louder   Our server literally ghost  She came around give drinks then food it  wasn't even busy while no reason appeared more often  ended having refills other people because she couldn't job right  The food absolutely gross  things ordered macaroni cheese  never said list ingredients going onions but  feel more onions bowl macaroni cheese  also fried chicken sandwich completely disgusting because use dark meat  made want puke   The table small could barely fit there  Plates clanging everywhere because enough room  The manager ended being duty condescending  Every time would ask question she'd seem your fault servers weren't doing job she actually something  Ugh just such terrible experience I'd give 1 star if could  The only plus if ate they'd give parking pass garage wouldn't pay  I definitely recommend place anybody  <EOR> This Place Bomb Great Food Excellent Customer Service Form Reba Case Cristabel Amber Thomas <EOR> I ordered room service provider downtown grand   photos Yelp reviews seemed very good   ordered pastrami hash eggs   eggs cooked order runny but hash almost no pastrami   Maybe 4 5 small pieces   Then cubed potatoes which 99% dish very undercooked   Very disappointed order but hungry ate anyway  <EOR> Music great  Food great! Ha $9 99 prime rib better thought  Lady singing tonight great  She great voice letting people pick artists sing  <EOR> The best part visiting Freedom food  am talking outstanding quality but quantity  $17 received plate full good fried chicken portion fairly enough two people   biggest advantage place work 24 7 looks safe one  saw some police officer eating too   There several waiters waitresses workig time  least hostesses needed wait century food delivered   The unlimited buffet works only if staff comes check if would something else which didn't often even all  <EOR> Love place food point especially pot roast sandwich!! Love live music late LIB William Voice singing!! Where does happen?!? gotta check out <EOR> So group first group people waiting line brunch  Brunch starts 10am we're waiting line 9 45  being first group sit down ordered would think would first receive breakfast  Right now 10 45 everyone else came received food already almost done meal  didn't even first order  unacceptable  never request talk manager much entire hotel casino within 24 hours  write separate review hotel  When finally did food dishes ordered never put order  <EOR> Came Sunday brunch   It's mini breakfast lunch tapas   Oh forgot mention  all eat   They also live music playing while eating   I chicken waffles sliders short ribs   Biscuit gravy  Potatoes eggs  Mini pancakes  plenty more  just can't remember all  All those just $20 $10 more endless mimosas  <EOR> ROB ROB ROB  If you're bartender isn't Rob then ask when he working come back then   Plain Simple  <EOR> Feb 22nd Trip Late Review 0 Stars service 10 stars food!
