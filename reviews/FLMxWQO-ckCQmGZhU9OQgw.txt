Yes eat storm many choices choose from  But quality food itself isn't greatest  Some foods dry flavorless just eh    So come variety pure enjoyment eating much can  But if want quality food should head somewhere else where pay same amount but food taste 10 times better  <EOR> Okay if nothing else shear selection things choose place worth $24  first time rating based only experience    I took only small sampling just everything meat fish trip buffet all could handle    I did slab Prime Rib which could cut fork couple crab legs  Both very good although crab legs bit overcooked but common happen won't knock rating it  breaded scallops awesome beef ribs pretty good too  type BBQ ribs typically drier fall off bone ribs really but still good  only two items didn't care chicken wings fried fish    The deserts okay but time sampled all foods gone back stuff liked won't eating much desert any ways don't worry it   The thing didn't but looked amazing 1 2 gallon maragrita   Okay don't know exact size but did see lady use two hands carry it   Lastly didn't know but coupon available http www vegascoupons com rio buffet coupon html <EOR> This still favorite buffet Vegas   service awesome food variety selection superb   something everyone seafood corndogs quesadillas EVERYTHING!

Yes am buffet foodie many    I find myself returning Rio regular!  price quality food most part servers great! <EOR> Waited 75 minutes line 8 00pm despite least 30 open tables visible   Staff didn't seem care laughing while standing around work stations   Expected food worth it   Ribs tough enchiladas hard   Dessert good   never back   worth trip even if 24 hour pass  <EOR> I bit leery try buffet   they typically favorite places eat but heck reviews sounded pretty good   When arrived did bit sticker shock prices   long time since Vegas price per head definitely increased   Luckily some locals ended getting rather large discount   that good part evening   At first waiter pretty attentive but getting first round drinks clearing couple plates he disappeared   He gone long filled adjacent table top pony wall plates   wasn't piggish 9 us   When he came back attitude little nasty he ended spilling remaining contents plate seat where nieces husband sitting  Now let's talk food   while wasn't horrible certainly great   did live reviews least   comparison buffet Carnival Cruise Lines would 5 star   don't waste your money  <EOR> crab amazing eleventeen different kinds gelato recommend tiramisu   hate sweets place made em' great tells u something   oh yea prime rib break your grass munching hemp wearing vegeterian habit   2$ margarita specials   this place glutton's paradise! still working that    <EOR> Not best  Ate before Pen Teller show since plan day there   630 d wait line atrocious!  recommend using cash credit no line which discovered 30 minutes waiting!!! food worth wait   Bland best dry worst dessert table nothing brag either   Its work tour Buffett Mexican American Italian Chinese   crab legs but small worth effort     Its 25 Buffett watered down drinks no extra forks! sure keep yours   Buffett trip Las Vegas just different foods definitely going back far worth it  <EOR> This place garbage   still think back cringe wasted valuable stomach space food tastes Hometown Buffet legit steriods   I've heard LOT place decided well why not    boy did regret it!! selection food amazing give them that  little bit everything room but dang   horrible food!!! If looking Vegas buffet first place I'd recommend perfect medium between price selection taste Bellagio Planet Hollywood  Selection may massive Rio but taste difference quality preparation!  Like said only thing Rio going them selection other only good those high because everyone knows everything tastes better when you're high  <EOR> Happy came experience buffet  Great selection amazing variety food  DELISH <EOR> We came Friday night dinner  Since majority aren't big seafood fans decided try world buffet opposed seafood buffet  price dinner reasonable $30 person  I  must admit place huge TON variety  There's italian bbq mexican chinese american  even pho mongolian bbq bar  Don't started dessert choices  UNBELIEVABLE! However    I personally didn't think quality standard  Some food really bland salty  presentation some items horrible  looked food left under heat lamp hours  But don't wrong some choices very delicious  especially enjoyed desserts  If you're looking variety Carnival World Buffet your best bang buck  <EOR> Best buffet ever to! Great variety all kinds food plus prime rib divine P   But don't come Thanksgiving the line gets wild!!!! Or any holiday actually sure same but if sure tip well because people most likely work every holiday     I would call ahead just case see long line depending day time  <EOR> Two words    crab legs  love some crab legs  Everything prime rib gelato very good  something everyone  all  big fan prime rib but since tried just fell love it  tender juicy  Yummy  velvet cake very good well  Plus bar buffet  Endless possibilities  <EOR> One better LV buffets eaten few reasons 1 great service during champagne brunch  unlimited mimosas! 2 reasonable price seeing many buffets upward $40 per person  would again  <EOR> This place steadily gone down hill since first visit three years ago  Granted almost direct proportion Vegas slow sinking general   The prime rib roast beef over cooked practically inedible selection Asian food used include some delicious Indian Thai entree's down basic Chinese Japanese items samosas which pretty disappointing  The saving graces world buffet crab legs desserts red velvet carrot cheese cake   cheese cake easily best had   creamy delicious   Mexican food also some great options mole chicken   Our first waitress pretty much hostile trying buffet but second waiter awesome 3 stars <EOR> This week first time ever buffet  dying years because lot people told good  Don't let 3 star rating fool though  more pros cons   Pros buffet huge variety food  comparable size Bacchanal Buffet which favorite buffet Vegas  The asian food excellent! If then highly recommend place  husband father in law also commented buffet best duck ever tasted  both work food industry speaks volumes know try if ever back here  The gelato also very delicious  There's lots flavors choose they're all good  Service awesome  server quick refill water  She also offered extra napkins even gave hubby empty plates crab shells  unexpected but very kind  It relatively empty upon arrival  came opening time dinner 3pm no line whatsoever  actually thought closed  Haha  We discount being local  Sweet   Cons The price still lot but guess expected because serve seafood everyday  The main reason knocked whole 2 stars off rating quality some food  example mac cheese no flavor slimy just plain gross  Also weirdest cheesecake ever tried  base made sponge cake which gives weird texture cheesecake also flavorless  could but think idea  Just lot food lacking flavor  Overall place great but don't know if would long trip over here  better buffets there  <EOR> Would put higher if price lower  Decent food great selection variety terrible service  let dishes pile table trouble finding space new food  Ordered coffee repeatedly ask it  Why hell place expensive? enjoyed prime rib roast duck some desserts  However some food tasted stale waaay long  really irritated service  point just being inattentive begruding but almost being rude  guy working?? Jeez  Only reason put two stars instead because prime rib  <EOR> If you're going eat buffet Vegas might well all out   Rio buffet lotta quantity but whole lotta nothing when comes quality   Price decent but don't skimp cheap if you're going Vegas   What's even more annoying huge lines everything   worst stand line forever something isn't even worth it   Recommend Bellagio Wynn buffet   10 times better!  Dessert highlight gelato selection but even even good   Limited selection  standard issue apple pie cherry pie chocolate cake cookies     Seafood Crab legs ice cold cocktail shrimp seemed more bay shrimp clams only clam shells   you point  <EOR> My boyfriend down Rio see Penn Teller decided eat buffet because bit pressed time  payed $10 extra bypass line but still wait line people bypassing line  Well least saved some time    This buffet almost overwhelmingly huge if you're into options your place  found stuff left dessert area lot better stuff right some reason  Some highlights prime rib sweet potatoes sushi small selection though   Mexican food section looked straight Golden Corral though wonton soup Chinese section kind average    I left feeling satisfied but amazed  good buffet but still buffet  Next time Vegas try others contrast compare  <EOR> I love buffets    And love buffet more others  figured should write review good buffet since just slammed Aladdin's  heh   I haven't back few years but remember really enjoying myself eating until thought might explode  Lots variety quality food really good  price much cheaper lot other ones    Sure Rio little far glam some other ones but best food especially price    OH probably won't give food poisoning  Unlike some other buffets know    *cough*Aladdin*cough* <EOR> I did buffets STILL DISLIKE BUFFETS going Carnival World Buffet!  This supposedly best buffet Las Vegas! OKKKKK      According BF buffet better Hometown    but when left he said quality down  Way down      There several areas which serve Asian Mexican etc  food   The pho pretty lame  meat even close supposed guy served flat noodles! Yes flat noodles pho!?!?!?!?! broth ridiculously mediocre  dim sum dry around edges  Chinese Broccoli salty      The fried rice OK  BBQ pork OK  did seaweed salad which added some tofu to   The Mexican style rice good but authentic  cilantro sauce tilapia only repeat ONLY good thing ate day!  The steak boyfriend ate bad either   The BBQ pork ribs cooked well but BBQ sauce just sweet flavorless sauce   The dessert section best thing  However pies placed small individual plates  would better if could use spatula serve many slices want onto large plate especially since tiny! cherry pie good but crust poor  ice cream mediocre   I never another buffet life if avoid it  If Vegas buffets supposed great frightens think any other buffet there   However heard more expensive buffets Bellagio way way better  knows? must said though those buffets different class  serve kobe beef example  <EOR> If past price incredible experience! discounts joining Total Rewards club $3 off checking Foursquare $5 off just show your check Total Rewards Counter! Genius!  Huge fan carving station! Prime Rib off hook  Ask two slices cause cut them bit thin  Also mongolian grill pumps some really great tasting stir fry  Also really enjoyed gelato bar many choices! mention 100's  other desserts case!   GO! <EOR> Better any buffets far but there's still room improvement  Most everything very good but few bland plates  sushi good most impressive thing miso soup dispenser    However miso soup definitely needed salt! <EOR> First time maybe 7 8 years ago parents  all those years still enjoy buffet  don't eat meat actually happy fish other offerings available   If rating desserts itself would give 5 star  food 3 5 4 great but dessert bar bomb dot com!  If your going avoid higher priced buffets but still want buffet then come Carnival World Buffet!  other budget priced buffets you'll regret it  <EOR> I remember elementary school friend mine regaled wild stories excellent buffet Rio  Flash forward some 20 years later we're visiting friend Vegas can't wait take girlfriend place  SURE! sez   What found Rio buffet every other buffet ever life  There's lot food but there's lot mediocre food  There's Asian section tastes every take out place you've ever greasy duck glaze saturated pork dry satay chicken skewers sushi tough seaweed  There's meat section cut sirloin steak absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance flavor  There's seafood station which beyond unlimited crab legs filled fried foods fresh foods   A few positives great pie good ham half decent Chinese siu mai   We half usual price $16 opposed somewhere neighborhood $32   Even fire sale prices still wasn't enough back  Maybe three star place but hearing many people life talk magic wizardry Vegas buffets left especially disappointed   So here's advice buffet personal challenge stuff your face four plates food want just decent dinner? second kind person next time I'd recommend put $30 towards many many many exceptional restaurants strip competing basis quality quantity  guess what? You'll still filling delicious meal! <EOR> I buffet family eat buffet told other family member's know paid $29 dollars *6 adults $21 per kid *7 separate checks you  girl host tells need pay additional% because many people me  she split up  which fine  but two opposite ends place  Otherwise meal Good enjoy buffet  <EOR> I Love good buffet!!!

There's also good choice meats sausages prime ribs  All fresh high quality well  wish could've taken picture but hands full holding plates endless food But short clear food worth its value  Especially weekdays since less twenty bucks  <EOR> I set trying buffet Wynn but couldn't pass deal Carnival World Buffet   Tix4Tonight offered Carnival World Buffet Rio $12 95 which over 50% off regular price dinner service   ahead made plans dinner buffet headed Rio   The buffet wasn't difficult find within Rio Resort steady line greeted us   neglected remember most buffets long lines customers waiting but luckily only waited 30 45 minutes particular Saturday night   Once reaching register paid price promised Tix4Tonight   price seemed bargain especially Las Vegas buffet   A hostess walked over table let loose food offerings   eye fucked selection browsed before going wild food   buffet name does its justice selection everything might imagine including Asian Mexican American Italian Seafood   made mistake mixing all kinds food which didn't agree stomach   Nevertheless food selection impressive looked great   I ahead tried Italian selection first pasta good but great   pasta seemed overcooked sauce lacking flavor   Next tried Mexican some fajitas rice beans tamales tortillas   Mexican average yet much better Italian   fajitas great flavor nicely tendered nicely paired grilled onions tortillas   wanted try few more things before giving up   ahead tried BBQ ribs pleasantly surprised flavorful tasteful were   Although dress shirt buttons verge popping ahead way desserts  desert selection just impressive food lots choose from  set trying gelato eclairs   gelato delicious looked must try gelato fans   eclairs just equally delicious great way end food binge   The selection quality food Carnival World Buffet average best   selection impressively large but food wasn't hoped for   food quality average didn't impress much   However given price paid $12 95 can't complain much   If you're trying save few dollars Carnival World Buffet good bet  <EOR> Everything disgusting except maybe fresh fruit  If you've taste buds stay far far away    I sampled plenty things including chicken steak veggies Asian rice seafood Mexican dessert  Something off everything  taste wrong texture weird sitting long being terribly fresh because all frozen  Chewy chicken spices wonder if you're eating expired     Yikes!!  Frowns all around  sure hundreds other buffets eat Vegas mention thousands establishments yourself bite eat   Good luck! <EOR> Been going many years recently back when visiting Vegas  Place hasn't really changed ten years  good thing  Very reasonably priced usually breakfast here  Lunch good but if want high quality gourmet food dinner steer clear  But said very consistent never really anything bad buffet  <EOR> We took long walk Excalibur Rio worked massive appetite could enjoy amazing buffet lunch   The Carnival World Buffet HUGE! abundance stations weren't able try all because just much!  Asian choices very good Italian style salads   absolutely amazing cheesy pasta wish would more of   sandwich station but decided if opted we'd full enjoy dessert!  The desserts phenomenal   tried 4 types gelato between two none them disappointed   bread pudding delicious cheesecake   cherry pie ok but nothing write home about     This favorite buffet Vegas definitely worth long walk! <EOR> Went try food  very disappointed because food good all  waste money expensive  family didnt either  <EOR> If variety sheer volume matter your buffet pleasure look no further  Wait times long but reward kind experience  buffet divided geography Italian Chinese Japanese American etc  also requisite carving stations build your own stir fry etc  center dessert station gelato which good but more regular ice cream gelato cakes pies truffles pudding more  Let's just say you're going come place if you're diet  Overall food good any buffet but beats them all diversity options  <EOR> All Eat!

Enjoy! <EOR> Very reasonable price good variety quality  best Asian choices buffet offering Vegas opinion  favorite buffets Vegas! <EOR> A buffet getting 5 stars? WTF right? those know would shocked even see 4 stars but give credit where credit due   If reason choose buffet only reason only 24 dollar day pass  Want sweet deal? coupon book hotel 5 dollars off buffet  alone would 5 stars most people but me   so why did 5 stars? prime rib absolutely divine  would pay prime rib shop  wasn't dry under over seasoned  If trying find reason knock failed   The other spread food good but prime rib standout  average dessert bar gelato  don't know if everyone serves gelato days but gelato always special me   So awesome price great food hate but 5 stars  <EOR> Came dinner    I really wanted crab legs trip Vegas  legs really tiny but still enjoyed them    Dessert disappointing  liked coconut gelato but seemed really frozen creamy  Nothing labeled dessert section accidentally grabbed carrot cake  dry  cream cheese frosting  strawberry tart tasted really artificial made strawberry instant pudding    I liked fried scallops shrimp    I couldn't find soy sauce sushi    It's few days since ate but remember liking it  Everything all kind blur because did Buffet Buffets  ugh never again  <EOR> Would review zero if could   as actually able eat there   waited line paid second line seats   when asked many party replied six which met eye rolling   ten minutes pass fifteen minutes pass twenty minutes pass finally ask speak manager   who proceeds rude party pointed table sitting dirty response SO?    small parties no problem VIPs no problem but anything bigger good luck   after attitude opted take money elsewhere  <EOR> My boyfriend visiting Las Vegas birthday   decided check Carnival Buffet since pretty good deal Groupon     We came during lunch time seated fairly quickly   most international buffets food separated country American Italian Mexican Japanese Chinese   soon shown table off races   tried little bit everything just expected everything just average  desserts just average well   Nothing telling your friends family about     With Groupon came free wine bottle which pickup bar   When first bar bartender wasn't there    10 minutes later bartender still there    another 10 minutes bartender still there    another 10 minutes still time getting pretty frustrated and we're pretty patient people   ask chefs he couldn't find bartender   another lady waiting bar trying free bottle well   thought very unprofessional   only leave your station but even telling anyone it   wasn't until done meals bartender showed up   No apologies no excuses he acted nothing wrong  He just look face showing he did want there   just took bottle jetted there     The service other staff members great! Just bartender kind ruined experience because looking forward drinking free wine while eating lunch   Overall place good buffet if your budget   bad but great either  If weren't Groupon most likely would never step here  <EOR> If your main purpose eating buffet experiencing many different food then would place visit  many different foods many countries present many them cooked order  servers friendly delightful strangely easy find friendly people Las Vegas hotels restaurants   ambience light spaceous which liked lot too   The only reason didn't give 5 stars rating fact short oo friuts vegetables  only basics fruits vegetables  wish put more next time  <EOR> Went Buffets buffet pass   Yee   Excellent choice dinner however wait tremendously long 1hr+    must say worth wait   food better most buffets buffet pass   offer different food selections ranging american italian mexican chinese etc    most favorites roasted duck dim sum selection noodle soup selections desserts great   experience it! ps  ride shuttle harrahs rio  taxi good too  <EOR> Some things good  Some things great  Some things good   That's usually most buffets   This place generally cheaper other buffets Vegas dinner   It's $30 person   If come weekends arrive early !

Great price wide selection your fatty status on! <EOR> YEAH! third last buffet 24 hour Buffet Buffets madness definitely best!  Le Village Paris then Spice Market Planet Hollywood finally Carnival World Rio   Since only few hours since filled Spice Market little concerned stomach's hadn't enough time process everything   Fortunately depending look it additional hour long wait line gave more time work appetite!  They crab legs sticking pile ice bed nails really unique garden planter   crab split half other places such Bellagio Wynn but if don't mind extra work cracking shells big deal   Plus additional work slow down little don't end filling 20 minutes waiting line hour   buffet trips legendary 4 5 hours eating sitting little time spent shell cracking no problem   The noodle bar great good Paradise Garden Flamingo but definitely second best far   pick your noodles broth few ingredients such fish balls chicken veggies etc   large selection but noodle broth amazing   spicy course also helps slow down pace eating when spicy food!    This first buffet where nice teppanyaki grill   Similar noodle bar just load bowl non meat ingredients add meat before stir fry process   Now don't flip any cooking utensils air flair little lacking but food still tasty!  Note Rio rid ridiculous Miso soup automatic dispenser   all fresh ingredients tofu green onions seaweed etc  then looks re purposed cappuccino dispenser break room local Toyota dealership   bit tacky your buffet!  I thought wood fired pizza oven very nice touch   recommend take extra step craft some unique pizzas though   rarely pizza buffet because carbs feel full quickly lets face if looks Dominos then don't need wait line hour it   When walked pizza section just saw your standards pepperoni cheese mushroom etc   Why don't spring some nice toppings such prosciutto artichokes sun dried tomatoes etc   even throw some mini calzones since wood oven there   Ok enough suggestions   full bar middle nice touch since Vegas drinking connected some strange reason   desert section again amazing gellato really smooth fresh   Out three buffets tried those 24 hours definitely best thanks helping wrap day good note   Food thought If winery which essentially buffet wines sample wines spitting wine don't drunk can't same thing food buffet?  Would socially unacceptable bring little bucket along just taste food without getting full?  Just sayin'  <EOR> It's alright   Half off locals a big reason why husband likes it better station casino buffets   guess if you're hungry don't lot money   why not? <EOR> FINALLY something worth having Nevada ID for  50% casino buffet all u need Nevada ID sign rewards card  don't even gamble  long lines but if VIP status actually pops does side step VIP line just little wait  but if wait regular line expect close half hour so    I'd compare Carnival World buffet Studio B buffet M Casino  variety quality food  Big selection good tasting food some ok even poorly made food sushi bbq ribs terrible   everything soup salads corn dogs meat loaf fried chicken dim sum mexican asian american italian beers other alcohol drink desserts    Really really loved asian style roast duck enough almost much duck crab legs full plate juicy tasty  also real tasty asian style pork chop  If want PHO TEPPANYAKI specially made pick ingredients they'll rest  Soy beans    Carving stations!? some tender pieces prime rib they'll even cut thick just let um know  Roast beef glazed ham think saw turkey maybe  pork beef ribs    No made order pasta but some good pasta dishes ones you'd bake casserole  also lot good quality pizza    Came crab legs oysters but disappointed find no oysters only served cold crabs legs  didn't ask but maybe next time ask teppanyaki guys see if something crab legs    Desserts lot choose but plate mango coconut orange cream ice cream scoops topped warm just banana foster yeah know you'd some right now best way end feast    Service wasn't good bad clearing table getting drinks even worst when wanted refills  Didn't drinks until two plates in  table filled plates cups stacking    But overall definitely worth 12 bucks 50% off locals Friday night might even steal  <EOR> Stop 7 7 buffet buffets journey  Rio biggest buffets decent quality  second favorite planet hollywood comes first   Nice variety something everyone  <EOR> Super average buffet  wanted buffet because starving but JUST come back Grand Canyon Hoover Dam driving all day just hungry didn't want change ready somewhere nice  Yelp told decent buffet price went  Also didn't want wait long line but ended waiting almost hour anyways    There lots drunk obnoxious people standing bar nearby annoying everyone complaining  sure if management eventually did anything if left own    The best part Asian section gelato  <EOR> Grew coming Rio Buffet    They good variety cuisines but favorite made order soups Pho egg noodles other Asian dishes    Oysters fail here  Super slimy small mushy pleasant all    Prime rib standard raw horseradish    Shrimp Cocktail good size plump   Crab legs pretty thin annoying open amount meat get  gave those 3   Pho broth delicious  add all kinds different meats including bo vein Vietnamese meatball rare beef etc  Hoisin condiments including fresh herbs basil bean sprouts lime etc   Desert station plentiful but most popular ice cream sorbet station  Nothing really stood here    Overall $35 mediocre  <EOR> The Rio Carnival World Buffet best buffet Vegas  lot more selections food desserts great price  atmosphere nice big its incredible experience!

BF's review Crablegs bomb!  Happily Hungry Heels adds 5 inches taller Vegas requirement!  Must rock some stylish spiked heels! <EOR> Loved spread ! Very satisfying filling! Happy selection course taste quality food  A must try people loves buffet Vegas style! <EOR> Rio two buffets each end casino   first maybe less popular but think better buffets   Perhaps should give Seafood try   remembered place stations set ethnicity pretty cool  Sure others copied them but 'm pretty sure first  most buffet some food good some weren't   fan buffet but getting sushi although great always good thing   Alaskan Crab legs always plus too  <EOR> Kinda disappointed  Blah flavors  might wrong but memory hotels used competing best buffet now they're closer all same  $32 99 used mean really good quality   Sad  <EOR> I can't believe place highly rated!  Proof positive quantity sometime mistaken quality   The thing Carnival World buffet's going its size   Even compared other Vegas buffets huge themselves place GIGANTIC   But really would rather football field's length Chef Boyardee plate edible food?  Cause you're going find place much other   I used forced come friend's family jr  high because swore best   Even then palette knew difference   point only place different 'stations' different types food   Everyone does now lot them much better results  <EOR> This first time tried Seafood Buffet Rio's before good also  Carnival World Buffet Monday night still wait line 40 mins which bad  price $29 99 but if Neveda ID 50% discount    This biggest most variety buffet found Vegas  food fresh especially Snow crab Shrimp cocktail Oyster  chinese section great even roasted duck  Overall good value recommend friends when Las Vegas <EOR> There many varieties   probably best thing place   never same thing twice except deep fried scallops   full half way during time here   food wasn't super amaze balls but great  lot items cooked very well very good seasonings   server attentive courteous whole time asnwered all questions   Plus free champagne via groupon! <EOR> Location It's Rio which isn't Strip   little far walk if you're staying Strip cab over hitch ride local family friends   Atmosphere It's buffet   Food stations along back way   Seating front   large dining room may ge lost walking back your table fixing your plate   Service The wait staff refills your glasses takes your finished plates away   pretty quickly no complaints there   Food Drink If want found here   Being Maryland always start seafood crab legs shrimp !  But there's more sushi fried chicken prime rib salads etc   mean wouldn't love all you can eat buffet food inspired all over world!  Yes tad pricey approx $32 00 dinner but you'll definitely spend more money less food celebrity's restaurant   The BEST buffet Las Vegas   Hands down!!! <EOR> This big place lot variety  food decent  server friendly attentive  <EOR> I've better buffets Sizzler   Long lines stale food just very dirty apperance  used spot eat if wanted buffet experience  Garbage!!!! <EOR> Had vegas reunion ended coming back buffet! Even though little off strip totally worth taxi trip here  would say place best buffet places to!   There much selection!!! never fails overwhelm I would recommend coming during dinner because food much better don't even worry somewhat high price charge I think $30 40 person but disappointed!! personal favorites   CRAB LEGS! Prime Rib!!! asian mexican sections good too  There's really much say but fact place come back says enough!  If you're vegas definitely try buffet least once!! <EOR> I Rio World Buffet more ten years ago food palette changed radically amount time place dipped quality  Possibly combination both  any event sorely disappointed  food mediocre best  prime rib very salty sushi barely qualified sushi more fried breaded offerings shake dollar bill at  Highlights cheesecake you might ask dessert attendant har gow  figure   If you're looking great value probably plenty mass quantity dining options Vegas just good  <EOR> To tired waste time why rating which should 1 star  wont back visit last week  <EOR> The food good! They such wide variety meats sides appetizers desserts  Unlike most buffets quality food surprisingly really good  always special offers going staff very accomodating  witnessed woman begin yell staff member whom looked some sort management position line being long  Thats obviously something management can't control but manager remained calm appologized  If lines long then food must good right? Recommendation Steak place middle where choose your own meats and GELATO!!! Coconut Cookies Cream <EOR> OMG crazy serve much food even crazier much eat!!  good part took time  afraid would look contestant Biggest Loser!  Ok    I when changing Lunch Dinner where change some food all good know   Anyway managed capture every taste bud imaginable   Pizza Pasta Pork Pot Roast Potatoes even Pudding   things would regular basis its buffet if don't something else   think paid $35 which l if think $17 lunch dinner bad I didn't coupon    server great ok    she brought drink cleared table but offered nice conversation which nice    desserts good HOWEVER lot them similar some sugar free but some reason didn't knock socks off entrees  dessert area looked little bakery   place agenda visit well worth it   PS   that food never tried before Sesame ball OMG great don't know if mass produced but ggooooddd   Looks strange inside but try new stuff   YUMMY   Oh crab legs gazillion them  <EOR> Locals discount  Ate shrimp clams mussels crab legs crawfish prime rib all sorts fixings  Some items warm preferred  Good desserts  Didn't really care being seated way far edge area control kids just because toddler too  She's typical quite well mannered  Updated 11 10 14 all night sick something ate  pleasant  <EOR> Great big dessert section crab already cut duck here!!! No need upgrade seafood buffet world buffet enough! <EOR> Food pretty good staff friendly but booth seats horrible would give 5 stars  Theres exposed piece wood runs along back  Right trombone position thats all felt during meal  need fix need bring cushion  <EOR> Since Paris buffet downhill emerged current favorite buffet Las Vegas!  many choices would take days eating meals buffet try everything   Disregard Friday only seafood buffet   we Tuesday night tons crab legs among other seafood choices   items remembered trying liked salisbury steak Chinese pork loin eggrolls taco bar mac cheese prime rib fruit tart cauliflower au gratin honey glazed ham etc   Paying $26 tax quality good enough price variety much better lot other places tried  <EOR> Just re visited buffet still lives its reputation   think lot people put place down because spoiled fine dining high expectation!  Outback Steakhouse nor Claim Jumper Olive Garden   Don't come expecting good quality food   food very very descent but gourmet   Very rare ever gourmet buffet there   It takes 1 minute 40 seconds walk entire food area non stop !  24 seconds walk entire dessert area!  2 minutes 4 seconds worth buffet!!  Think it   go walk 2 minutes anywhere idea long food serving area and NO repeated food item see other buffets   <EOR> First night Vegas ate Carnival World Buffet  Well worth money! little nervous some reviews  sushi peel eat shrimp order your own soup spicy viet noodle soup shrimp dumplings wonderful! wish crab hard peel  Maybe could cut them half some other buffets  glasses never empty! service amazing! Plan back sure! Tons locals which good sign! think locals special price half off something that  <EOR> yummmyy!!! always must   come whenever visit vegas  prices actually pretty cheap compared lot other good buffets vegas  23 99 dinner 21 ppl paid 28 alltogether per person including gratuity wasnt bad all  many choices never leave feeling unfilled unsatisfied  prefer dungeness crab legs tossed sauce asian style but fresh snow crab legs really yummy! prime rib melted mouth! dimsum actually better some restaurants  love soup station! Most hungover alot your own pho station awesome! prolly best pho but shoot still its own little yourself station which awesome me  bar which party started early lol  come buffet! its great deal money very yummy!! <EOR> This place awesome!!! never spend much anything all when come since reap rewards harrahs platinum member!  long line but absolutely no line all when walk through VIP front entrance     much food choose dinner breakfast recently there   probably 5th time buffet its always great   dropped  lost phone buffet but turned into lost found!  great place come hungry prepared walk away full!!! <EOR> So woke hungover hungry should since Vegas  People rave Rio Buffet entire group decides give try   Food Large selection but mediocre best   Drinks Champagne included yay!!!! But Orange Juice fake kind  Order Grapefruit Juice Instead   Seating Sucks large parties any other buffet Vegas  DOes accomodate large parties   In conclusion Lines long  paid extra $10 express line  Not really worth it $10 person  Does accomodate large parties over 6 without adding 18% gratuity  Meaning sit together  Food mediocre best For $24 bad guess  Enjoy! <EOR> Considering prices buffets Vegas days actually good value   Good selection food   Some Asian fair isn't half bad    your own pho section   seafood section kind bleak but considering price didn't expect much more   Overall decent buffet good value money   Large groups charged gratuity  <EOR> Prime awsome crab shrimp mounds food around world dessert never stops all fresh good place seats 733 people wait <EOR> Recently relocated Vegas though dined past tourists  Decided experience Carnival Buffet again Sunday night dinner offering 50% discount locals  don't anymore only 25% only quality subpar but overpriced  shortly before 4pm no line but caution if arrive prime time lines longer! Atmosphere layout good but rate 2 stars because if paying full price $29 99 per person players card good value compared other Vegas buffets  Negatives if crab we do! Carnival's snow crab which obviously cheapest smallest procure bit salty lacks meat sweet taste  spouse commented salmon he dry tough  Salad bar OK but no Caesar blend nothing special  Selections varied but nothing really stands out  Some other buffets Vegas similarly much lower priced offer much bigger better crab unlimited beer wine but Carnival pay significantly extra wine etc   Positives are pleasant staff good Prime Rib shrimp dim sum gellato good  Best give Carnival Buffet Rio right now just half hearted recommendation  <EOR> I've stayed Rio many many times when LV parents   Since completely against any restaurant can't wear jeans per person cost more $50 bucks eaten Rio buffet many MANY times   Overall am totally fan buffets   hate way food only kept warm enough can't back your table before its inedibly cold   hate way people breathe pick over food buffet open heart surgery just PICK something already move on        Anyway though Rio does problems degree pretty much always satisfied when eaten namely because crab legs shrimp   could sit all day eat just that   say TON other selections kind dabble usually some kind pasta dish salad maybe some teppanyaki whatever they're calling cooking station little sushi roll little dessert   parents seem chicken wings lot anything meat dad   mom doesn't eat seafood actually neither them do always seems full plate options knowledge complained very little particular buffet and she complains lot food places all all definitely worth if you're Rio want eat somewhere where sample little bit lot different stuff    However line VERY long price wise its bit steep buffet 30+ per person but  unlike most other LV casino buffets whatev   Quality content wise would put Rio buffet Wynn Bellagio buffets especially since kind better deal Rio   also helps when gone parents Diamond+ rewards credits butt always able skip line just cash credits instead having come pocket cash   no major complaints me   self help touch screen setup pay your meal helps line much faster   again having dined regular sat back 40 i e  tables near bathroom approximately 1 2 miles food also helps Diamond Platinum sit VIP area smack dab middle ginormous eatery Carnival World Buffet  <EOR> I 3 weeks ago looking try new buffet  best parts buffet braised beef ribs carne asada  Other most food bland meh  Some food actually tasted pre heated  Anyway if best afford I'd but personally I'd rather save some place better  <EOR> The food great lots options anybody's taste  Everything great customer service food only problem way waiting line set bit disorganized  mean cashier ton people  right  Reason why took off star  <EOR> The last time ten years ago loved back then thought would give try again     Let's see Rio buffet hate let count ways   Yes huge selection great place those larger groups different tastes   But really ends there     I think line system really sucks   coupon stand line right while people way behind credit card side paid seated way before did   If guess wait extra 20 minutes seated those people back line   don't know think fair but guess attempt keep line moving     When standing line could see bunch empty tables weren't being cleaned   line wasn't long Saturday night but wait over 45 minutes   Even when inside empty tables still ton people line   Our server just ok he did bring drinks relatively quickly but when came taking dirty plates away he very slow   We really enjoy sushi selection pathetic tasted gross   rice kind crunchy really fresh   chicken very dry few other things tried but didn't finish because just good all   One thing very good gelato meat station decent pretty tasty selection   did sort looked creme brulee but c b   don't know but bottom all liquidy raw! Yuck!  Overall think much better somewhere else   know some people really enjoy buffet but husband did not   Yes alot quantity but think quality most part really lacking  <EOR> I vegas often 24hr buffet pass must say best buffets gone vegas  Wide variety food chicken wings wonton soup crab legs popcorn shrimp carving station dessert bar  something kids adults enjoy  reason didn't give five stars because service bit slow don't steam crab legs  prefer steam crab legs over cold ones  But over all quality food great    Happy Eating! <EOR> This 3rd final stop Buffet Buffets tour saved best last  Carnival buffet still favorites because huge variety foods end other  favorite day prime rib  juicy tender but slice little fatty  selection ranges seafood different ethnic stations carving station   There no line since came right between breakfast lunch time could walked right in  buffet very busy since weekday weekend  If come don't mind driving over Strip then buffet you  <EOR> For Vegas buffet pretty Damm good  would definitely come back here  should love seafood if u come because  what's here  Also playing Gin Juice family restaurant which thought hilarious  N O M   P s  there's also station Pho <EOR> One better Vegas buffets opinion terms variety  choices endless buffet seemed miles!

<EOR> As vegetarian review buffet probably holds little weight but even flesh eaters agreed Carnival @ Rio didn't seem all special  The crab legs did thumbs though  brunch selection large but expected still limited options   Our server extremely cheerful much bordered fake side   She helpful constant smiles couldn't figure if just personality as scary seems some people actually that if she feigning big tip     The only thing made creamy rich gelato  <EOR> The variety foods brings back place everytime  fun many different types foods choose from  If don't thing theres something else try  even dim sum types food crab legs  If new vegas sure visit buffet rio! <EOR> I heard much buffets wife she said buffet gets 4 5 stars expecting something really good   Unfortunately bad news most if everything sub par don't anything write home about  only things all items bread pudding dessert galeto it   Don't wrong desserts look astonishing but sweet didn't really taste good looks   The food tasted fast food restaurant rather high quality restaurant   Maybe just but honest opinion just didn't wow all just type taste quality   We Vegas 4 nights bought day pass buffet  did save lot money vs  paying each meal individually  appreciate day pass buffet cause saved lot but otherwise buffets just really really don't know buffet hype   <EOR> Was Vegas July 4th weekend stopped rio carnival buffet  old faithful place when Vegas know getting  No complaints food  service outstanding always    Still disappointed dessert sections just pies cakes cookies still feature gelato which looks pretty but thing past   No Creme brûlée but flan w caramel syrup <EOR> My husband came October couldn't stop raving food  He said almost good Bellagio  month later found ourselves Rio few days wound eating three times  wasn't because Best Thing Ever because best place eat Rio  Anyway first time dinner then lunch finally breakfast into lunch over three days  probably should've gotten BOB but oh well   I pretty underwhelmed dinner  Sure selection huge  intrigued teppanyaki station but didn't try it  salad station tucked waaaay end but nobody know eats salad Vegas buffet  sure don't  Anyhoo liked half really didn't other half  fried fish crab dessert good  mac cheese became edible some sriracha  Much stuff didn't dry chicken corn dog fried rice   guess husband $29 99 price $3 off Total Rewards card set expectations little high    Despite experience encouraged try again time lunch  better  Breakfast best meal really liked breakfast foods tried especially corn beef hash    Drink service little slow times but staff nice enough    While a ok Yelp rating indicates wouldn't trip if back Vegas staying Strip  Bellagio still favorite  If try before five  line gets ridiculous  <EOR> Great buffet  Every time vegas here  Its great plenty food great selection good price  $25 per person  bad  <EOR> I agree Robin C's review  Completely dead on  wait long but seemed moving till point put multiple pay lines  friend coupon put last line which apparently where all couponers Rio guest sent well  Lets just call no body cares line basically standing moving forever while all other lines continuously flow  see people half hour wait behind seated before while stand hungry upset without any Rio hostesses even looking your direction  Finally couldn't take anymore asked Cashier he basically told nothing he could do  asked manager he acted he going talk him  He came back continued ignore everyone including without giving answer where manager was  absolutely ridiculous  Finally asked again when manager came let it  point he spoke hostesses then began seating people line  friend next line when noticed other lines then being sat first again! called hostess over she asked many 2 then asked everyone else back us  She then proceeded seat all larger groups back us! asked F going she told she 4 top tables 2 top  another minute waiting called back over pointed multiple two tops open she yelled stating supposed other larger groups because 4 top tables seat 2 people  told am fricken idiot know said! point wasn't worth it  just table took full advantage damn buffet   You name tried didn't care much food wasted  food wasn't even great  Rio multiple times before food much better remember genuenly thinking best buffet to  However time realized no buffet good  Buffets just full crap fresh charge arm leg it  If want good fresh Chinese food pay 7 00 full 40 00 crap! Anyways other times Rio carnival buffet seating didn't seem nearly disorganized  Perhaps because paid full price those other times  Seems give those people priority when should just going off time receipt seating people longest first  Gee concept?!?  So conclude although buffet reputation being The best Buffet Vegas would never return  your own risk if much eat crap food wait line over hour half  Just sure eat before coming come stocked purse snacks when waiting  Also sure no set stone plans your dinner  family back booked show few hours decided come buffet  Needless say once finally mom rush box office see if she could change show times  Apparently possible because family only able spend 30 minutes eat run  couldn't even moneys worth try everything buffet offer  thought pretty sad  Did also mention guest hotel? would think being guest box office would willing work them since Buffet full incompetent jerk employees   The upside waiter very nice very attentive something didn't expect service received while line  <EOR> I think line always long here     sign wait worth food!  My parents always come lunch dinner  want start off saying foods best 1  Crab legs dinner 2  Shrimp 3  Prime Rib dinner 4  Smoked sausage only lunch 5  Crab wrapped sole dinner 6  Catfish 7  Udon soup 8  Dessert all it For locals 50% discount come eat! 8 listed above worth while lunch dinner! <EOR> great buffet probably best Vegas buffet buffet deals  Lots selection  even hanging Peking ducks pork  Great service well  Line long maybe 30 minutes top  <EOR> I never eaten more here  buffet itself must 500' long  large quantity food    some quality some meh  But sheer quantity lacks quality specifically anything Italian other gelato     They large dessert counter well all sorts pastries chocolates gelato    Oooo gelato  girl group loosen already stretchy belt dress several rounds  good  Enjoy  <EOR> Back again two years row  Yes buffett GOOD  If check foursquare $5 off!

Ronald great very attentive always ball    Players club discounts believe could wrong locals half off  <EOR> If you're going treat yourself just buffet during your trip Las Vegas would choice   It's fairly standard far Las Vegas buffets go   large variety quality decent service quite good   But overall would say nothing overly special least when compared other options Las Vegas     For main reasons try buffet sample various deserts may find anywhere else   desert options bit lacking uninspired   suspect most deserts pre packaged  <EOR> One more decent buffets cheaper price others Vegas strip  If you're looking variety good food desserts   not mention unlimited mimosas brunch cost lower $35 then buffet you  buffet also included buffet buffets pass gives 24hr unlimited visits 8 Vegas buffets $49 99   Lunch 6 6 2015 <EOR> I'm somewhere between 'A OK' 'Yay! fan'  good value but sure amazing quality is    gourmet but good selection cuisines desserts if room them! <EOR> I can't believe forgot review place went!  Excellent buffet   really does everything girl could want   When waiting long line never having before price $25 seemed really steep but assured companion well worth money   Oh boy it   section major varieties cuisine Chinese Japanese Mexican seafood American Desserts maybe more    able fill plate which sometimes difficult being picky eater doesn't trust dish if looks just 1 ingredient may like   The wait staff awesome well   don't think ever such good service beverages plate clearing any buffet before   guy even offering take pictures parties nearby pulled chairs ladies etc   Superbly nice fellow well worth tip!  The dessert die normally when think buffet think dried cakes puddings but quality pastries special when bananas foster OMG!  Delicious!  I'm going staying Rio again January think just might eat day gorge myself awesomeness Carnival World Buffet! <EOR> Selection usually quite varied meaning many types which choose but also quite rotated meaning no matter season generally expect same things    Boo predictability   Obviously don't really world buffet simply eat Asian again but udon soft   I'd see more French besides dessert overall greater international credibility  kind run of the mill now   Their dessert selections seem getting better chocolate cups topped some sort berries  <EOR> I'm vegas least once twice month NEVER fail hit place up    No other buffet compare imho  much variety much seafood prompt service    Prime Rib BBQ Beef ribs Tepanyaki crab legs all damn day    I totally regret trying everything else except maybe Paris' last weekend    This buffet set bar book  <EOR> In past would given 4 stars easy   would definatley give 5 stars just fact accommodating  emailed Rio explaning always eaten when visiting really wanted husband brother sister law experience buffett however due having weight loss surgery over year very limited amount food eat  asked if would possible pay children's price also explained card surgeon name well type surgery had  emailed back 48hrs readily accmodated  told just show cashier card I'd able order children's price talk chef if any particular diatery needs which did not  happy thankful willing accmodate family! The food endless wide variety alway! enjoyed meatloaf mashed potatoes some crab! <EOR> Every talked raved buffet Rio guessing talking Seafood Buffet Carnival World Buffet  Carnival buffet known its massive variety dishes yes if truly looking then buffet right you   However if expecting more just variety more quality food itself am sorry say Carnival fails meet specific criteria  food definitely falls short anything spectacular even memorable cannot recall single dish worth remembering today!   Despite negative opinions price good $25 dinner variety does live its solid reputation  Carnival World Buffet definitely good place group friends your family however Rio off strip unless you're actually guest Rio you're going pay cab fare  unless desperately need try buffet suggest another buffet actually strip  <EOR> Not good Wynn  beau love buffet gave try must say its any other buffet @ home San Francisco   Dont wrong food tasted good but just wasnt spectacular! Crab shrimp pastas good  say am highly disappointed desserts I major sweet tooth! probably would come buffet compared other buffets strip! <EOR> What say?? all time favorite buffet   $24 99 person + tax their brunch great deal   dessert station immaculate!  much choose quality food great   variety Asian food pretty vast    sushi dimsum   pho made order   If brunch also mimosa each person!  Don't forget tip your waitress  <EOR> By far best buffet Las Vegas  always great experience  Love Gelato bar  <EOR> Came family because hungry didn't want wait any order  But forgot lines outside buffets  waiting obviously stars aligned evening    They great variety everything but food just decent though  tend stick soup salad anyways  Sometimes try pasta because very picky buffet pastas wasn't bad  loved small selection dim sum sure yummy! all over section  also Asian selection noodle soup pho udon even wonton just minus wontons? could also add your selection meatballs pho beef even fish your noodles  also sushi wasn't fan but maki sushi took salmon dipped wasabi soy sauce small dices sashimi myself highlight night! Getting sushi fix    The only downside lady slipped some food fell ground weren't helpful all help pick back up  big disappointment  lady more concerned cleaning food around her! service horrible  know buffet but acceptable two stacks plate sitting table 30 minutes! <EOR> Meh way better  salmon over cooked lot food lacked flavor tough  did some baked fish Mexican station breaded fried shrimp  dessert some raspberry cake thing picked raspberry found big chunk mold yuck! <EOR> Brunch attention waiter paid excellent he very helpful cleaning dishes off table refilling drinks checking us   Harrahs same week liked Rios much more   Rio better selection better taste gelato nice cap meal   crab legs little small but mountain them   Its off strip but would recommend catch shuttle enjoy food  <EOR> Best largest buffet ever to! Love many varieties different cuisines  side note quite expensive! But best buffet Vegas can't wait again  <EOR> We heard great things place first round diner  Being early would expect everything fresh  disappointment 1 Breads rolls rock hard  sitting days 2 Clams over cooked tough 3 Oysters flat plumb juicy  Guess  happens when thaw vs  fresh  LOL 4 Snow crab legs overly salty! be? 5 crust prime rib caked 1 8 inch salt  literally eating spoon salt  salty! 6 Lobster tails small 3 overcooked 7 Sashimi frozen stale taste 8 Sushi rice dry 9 cold dessert warm due sitting under lamps sitting long  The only good thing place wait staff  quick efficient   I've many buffets Todai Hotel Del Coronado etc    extremely disappointed compared others  guess figure there's many transients don't care quality opt satisfy patrons quantity   I mean $41 per person alcohol included seek elsewhere  place should $$$ star IMO  <EOR> We just coming back leg road trip stopped Zion Canyon Utah exhausted  But Rio nice break  Unluckily hit during random Sunday Champagne lunch special where tack 6$ price whether plan complimentary glass champagne  good granted cheaper getting separate drink bar but since all party took advantage namely those under 21 driver seemed wasteful    Anyways international name game? Hardly  If good chefs certainly aren't American Chinese Japanese Italian  Stay away teppanyaki dim sum hardly even immutable pasta left something desired  thing liked Caesar's others recently didn't offer king crab legs which indulged myself wholeheartedly  gelato bar also outstanding memorable dessert  But whole felt many buffets simply eating fill stomach enjoying food   I don't usually leave large tip top something where waiter traditionally only brings drinks clears dishes but waitress clearly way friendly helpful  that  All all great waitress wasn't enough salvage buffet's impression below average food  chose out of the way Rio because rave reviews resident Vegas experts but sure standard food is  <EOR> Went lunch  If your local rewards card half off  12$ person m f  Service very good food good lot choices surprised overall experience good quality nice people  lot different then remember people saying  desserts really good  thing  <EOR> I came Carnival World Buffet breakfast lunch today far more impressed expecting  Originally wasn't first choice buffet Vegas but seeing staying Rio just convenient eat today   For around $27 highly impressed quality food mention couldn't asked lovelier waiter   The coffee good for American coffee fresh orange juice huge salad bar Chinese Mexican section seafood area carving station huge dessert bar but standout far cooked to order tepinyaki station wow! choose everything want made right front you   Other notable mentions fried chicken not greasy perfectly seasoned cooked perfection prime rib carving station tender melted butter mouth house made gelato also great loved all novelty flavours   I would recommend buffet if staying Rio if then sure other buffets other hotels equally good sure I'd way eat again   but if you're general proximity give try! <EOR> Went over weekend wait little even though prepaid but probably due fact such big group    They lot food variety things selection very good  food itself just ok good but great  only thing really liked prime rib everything else just same any other buffet  Gelato dessert cakes really good though! Dont forget try that  <EOR> I tried seafood buffet Reno last night sick posted wouldn't feed food cat  Tonight tried buffet Reno wouldn't feed dog  Most recent stays Vegas included Cosmopolitan Wynn  Both food far superior Rio  <EOR> So constantly hear Rio use best buffet vegas but definitely before time such reign top ephemeral ever  Everything place meh 20 hours buffeting groups last stop  two pluses brought place 3 four fact serve champagne brunch also serve gelato  first buffet ive gelato  favorites mango chocolate coconut  Gosh thinking drool  Though wasnt best quality food gelato matter still hit spot quite well  buffet could definitely use some renovation <EOR> I've better buffets Cal Indian casinos   plenty chose from  But two slices roast beef tried toughest EVER eaten  Service great! <EOR> I thought overall selection outstanding!  purchased 24 hour buffet pass third time but first experience RIO   thought food selection diverse overall quality good   size entree food would expected more dessert selection       oh well full eat lot sweets anyway  <EOR> BEST CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH!  ENDLESS MIMOSAS!!! need say more? = <EOR> Ultimately guess buffet buffet    but definitely lives its name   theme food around world 'World Buffet     it    The variety definitely top notch   Saturday 'brunch' TONS great stuff   thing though personally wish ALL buffets would give Sushi    loves some sushi   BUT eat stiff sitting out   sorry but no    just gonna happen   On quality side would rate them above average compared some buffets Vegas   ordered omelet station flippin delicious   Downsides buffet Rio which off strip   shuttle runs pretty regularly though look save cab fare   Also line little ridiculous   pay machine know retarded people when comes working machines   Other though definitely recommend checking when Vegas looking goods buffet! <EOR> Ive buffet almost every time come Vegas which isn't very often maybe 3 times year  don't know why today wasn't good last couple times just didn't seem great  Our waitress very attentive friendly made sure whatever need  The snow crab legs dry worth effort didn't salad bar vegetables  I don't know exactly if when changed  But plenty food all different parts world accommodate your taste dessert bar very good  At $32 adult dinner just seems pricey  Maybe need check some other buffets  <EOR> Back when place first opened silly crowded very very good   remember place buffet   all new places sprouting Carnival World Buffet dropped quality   Don't wrong still nice buffet   food very tasty but over years always seems exact same stuff   used seafood buffet but realized mostly ate crab only Carnival World buffet crab lots it   starting crack kind takes away feel puling whole chunk meat   If area staying hotel suggest try least once judge yourself  <EOR> Saw crab legs basically ate only those entire meal   I'm gross that  The legs super tiny pretty impossible break open sweet sweet meat inside   I'll sure eat different foods next time  Eating only crab kind stupid idea now think it   Also INSANE LINES  Man  <EOR> Can say variety?! little everything  Italian Chinese Mongolian Korean Japanese American Mexican    especially enjoyed staples good buffets prime rib crab legs  When you're ready dessert try gelato  WOW    Linger around casino bound coupons buffet  them pitboss and    somewhere else    don't remember  Damn alcohol    Viva Las Vegas  <EOR> I say place best buffet Vegas     Located Rio Hotel Casino   Carnival World Buffet wide selection food choose from  usual American food Mexican food Asian food   There's something everyone enjoy   even bar inside those probably prefer bloody mary food   dessert bar nice but wish bigger selection     I'll probably admit pricing but selection food all eat   probably eat more probably worth   food decent seating arrangement easy of     Overall best buffet Vegas to  <EOR> It's still biggest buffets Vegas only recently passed upgraded buffet Caesar's if group people guarantee all find something eat  Doesn't matter if vegetarians food snobs kids refuse eat anything but pizza chicken nuggets you're covered   The line long  when really busy feel wait wasn't worth it  But isn't true all Vegas buffets? mean seriously learn eat off peak times  anything else Vegas depends normal clock  used eating early late all good   4 stars  <EOR> My boyfriend came because heard all hype Rio Buffet   When rio didn't know whether carnival seafood but boyfriend isn't big fan seafood figured both buffets must good because no ever specifies which awesome carnival world buffet   Now if buffet everyone talking would definitely overhyped because buffet crappy any other asian buffet would find Bay Area  selection crappy would even classify food good asian food    The desserts decent bite sized pieces but worth going back especially since need take shuttle if dont car because really far main strip!  Seeing bad buffet don't even know if would through all trouble giving seafood buffet chance  mean same hotel but knows we'll see feel next year   BTW such crappy food wait really long time  think waited least half hour alone restaurant   probably another half hour shuttle  definitely worth wait  <EOR> Everything's more delicious when you're starving nursing hangover right? said state when friends Monday morning breakfast    It first time pretty satisfied huge selection  way buffet set pretty much walk end restaurant other  timing happened catch end breakfast beginning lunch which super excited being foodie am  Haha  Sad say pretty full first plate didn't eat much after    Their selection food pretty good variety  breakfast menu consists everything pancakes French toast Eggs Benedict hash browns course bacon sausage  lunch menu pretty decent too  roast beef sushi delicious   The customer service decent  When friend asked orange juice took them while but cleared plates timely manner  Next time Vegas definitely come back hopefully try some desserts  full last time some  <EOR> If haven't buffet last year changed quite bit  took part right side where traditional american food resided turned into seating  bit small overall think but still tremendous selection  really enjoyed grilled satay meats  think food overall bit better  big complaint wait if diamond card member prepared wait  don't seem interested all ringing cashier seating if only gold member  <EOR> We really did research before first trip Vegas knew wanted try buffet Rio  no clue though would best meals ever life  Carnival World Buffet probably greatest buffet world  many places pizza freshly rolled sushi gigantic crab legs tacos burgers all meal? everything all excellent price compared other Vegas buffets  definitely recommend trying find coupons stretch your dollar even more  example last time found coupon those tourist magazines free steak cooked order your buffet  thought since coupon would little piece meat but pleasantly surprised when excellent cut cooked perfectly  Also if room dessert! fresh fruit chocolate cups gelatto almost worth price admission themselves  <EOR> I coming buffet once twice year last 10 years when Vegas  always place  last few times food quality really gone downhill price keeps going uphill  last time come here  dinner $34 time  Most food good  sad but table consensus best things pizza gelato  tired little bit lot options didn't really find anything really good  All food nasty so  prime rib which always favorite flavorless really fatty  crab legs seemed smaller really salty  always recommended buffet anyone talked going Vegas  won't anymore  would take $34 eat elsewhere  sad give review looking forward buffet 2 months major let down  <EOR> I am getting hungry again just thinking night's here! regular guest entrance long line dinner! family threw VIP area which quick painless   The Carnival World Buffet amazing selection food! While sushi area small offer really fresh salmon maki shrimp tempura! long line prime rib amazing! Worth line WAIT! cook really did amazing job! stir fry noodle soup area! much different food became hard sample all food before getting full   The only reason took off star because waitress seems busy clear table dish but would RECOMMEND Buffet! <EOR> Even though Rio mile off strip on opposite side I 15 people flock famous Carnival World Buffet reason   Dining gives taste real Las Vegas buffet all about   Several different stations spread across front buffet allowing just anything find Las Vegas place   price lunch isn't bad  $18 00  but clever consumer into buffet shortly before lunch begins gaining access breakfast foods along lunch becomes available   place truly worth try  <EOR> YUM YUM! second favorite buffet Las Vegas  Only because enormous crab legs jumbo shrimp Wynn  Besides winning bunch best place las vegas awards local favorite    The best feature buffet huge selection  7 different types cuisine plus desert section  could fried rice roast duck side hot dogs hot wings if like  know  odd combo but should large enough variety satisfy pickiest eaters   Highly recommend  Don't take word it  Just give Carnival World Buffet try  only con don't big enough stomach try entire buffet  recommend taking small portions things want try first then later grab more truly enough  See there! <EOR> I admit love buffets   However Carnival World Buffet buffet all buffet   purchased discount coupon Tickets 4 Less company paid half price   made tremendous value   wife big fan buffets she even loved it   While none food outstanding except maybe gelato most very good   took shuttle Bally's Sunday brunch   early enough avoid any lines   huge assortment food spanning almost every genre food   Some favorites were lox ambrosia salad prime rib potato pancakes applesauce strawberry churros   also loved Japanese stir fry station very similar Mongolian BBQ   Tom waiter outstanding  <EOR> I LOVE buffet before   go every week years     but now visit prices raise no reason discount locals down remodel buffet remove 1\3 all stations! Portions smaller before but now even more smaller guess soon need microscope    selection say sweets become  terrible remind those cheap  local buffets around town  Its dinner 07\03\15 selection sweets 10 names half available because enough all customers    Now its average buffet super inflated price    many buffets better Rampart example    And now no breakfast just lunch dinner which even worse because most other buffets around town breakfast! I'd rather Golden Corral now 4 times cheaper selection better! <EOR> It's billed BEST AYCE buffet all Las Vegas if weren't just two things probably would be 1  wait FOREVER line and  problem those physical handicaps 2  expensive average person   The food selection HUGE quality food terrific staff good but those things unfortunately offset long wait sit down amount money spend privilege dining there   But all means give them least visit form your own conclusions  <EOR> Decently priced moderate wait tasty food   We buffet around 2pm stayed 3 hours including 1 hour wait seated wandering smörgsbord international cuisine Rio   I impressed number offerings ones notable mention were Noodle soup bar the udon pretty good Gelato station Assortment desserts mini eclairs! moussecake! red velvet cake! King crab legs station Cocktail shrimp station next crab And rest decent but forgettable  server busser very attentive even showed use plastic crab crackers different ones used to   He friendly filled glasses quickly   My dad husband knocked 30+ crab legs ourselves     sweet husband kind enough shell every single me  Clean hands! D  love people      love   Overall pretty good food  nice able stay over until dinner time  <EOR> This favorite buffet long time   huge   very large selection food all really good stuff   wide variety including Mexican Italian Chinese American  only thing noted time compared previous visits didn't some fancier dishes anymore   used hasenpfeffer for example but no more   seem recall other things chateaubriand but nothing time   also seem removed burger station which good   why pay much buffet only burger??    Overall still favorite buffet but Bacchanal Ceasar's   I hear good things but very expensive   Carnival World buffet Buffet Buffets pass which very cool  <EOR> Very expensive long lines but delicious selection   super buffets good all around quality   slightly prefer M buffet because great Asian dishes but alcohol free   M lot cheaper though   Waiter service good but walk mile every time buffet   Now against little exercise but sheesh gelato melt time back!  loved noodle bar soups   Would come back if would lower prices little  <EOR> On day visited buffett leave couldnt stay long food good wouldnt mind coming back eat when visit Vegas <EOR> In August husband visited buffet great time Carnival World Buffet  waitress Barbara she far best  food also excellent  next visit Vegas eating Carnival World Buffet  Thanks being very hospitable  <EOR> Carnival Buffet Rio gets 5 stars when used eat here  variety food choices really nice  However let's honest  When Steve Wynn built Wynn tried buffet    never back  Rio would snow crab legs Wynn buffet king crab legs they're sliced don't sit hours trying take shell apart  haven't awhile could changed but if Wynn buffet still picture don't know if ever come back  <EOR> Rio Buffet HATE LOVE MUCH    I eaten over six different buffets Las Vegas including Bellagio Wynn would still pay taxi ride RIO anyday  Doesn't hurt Chipendales located well   little eye candy photo opportunity before stuff yourself    They eight different eithic foods satisfy all your tastes buds  love Asian soup stand  Tell chef type soup want cook noodles instantly you  Come on   everyone knows little pho udon great day drinking  However would save some room crabs    gooodddd    think each ate least ten those bad boys day    Note any group 10 higher wants sit together pay $3 60 per person tip upfront which reasonable   came group 20 put all own private room  YAY!   Also recommend coming early if planning eat dinner here  Especially Friday Saturday  came 3pm still waited half hour  <EOR> Hate it  Came when younger food poisoning  Haven't came back almost 15 years  However decided give them second chance last night  Albeit didn't food poisoning again found food subpar service nonexistent overall experience bleh    The only thing going place king crab legs  Hordes Asian tourists line this  admit price $25 30 buffet dinner aiiiight  But other place nothing else worth eating  Many items cold and or bland    So surprising line unbelievably long such unforgivingly nasty food  pray never return  <EOR> the best part going vegas trip de carnival world buffet   i all buffets vegas non come close 1  overall 5 stars family  <EOR> Rio's buffet always consistent its quality food  Seriously  good mix all kinds food fried clam strips steamed mussels gelato mongolian beef  top cheaper buffet dinners Friday evening only $23 99  mention registers pay self serve  Yes self serve  Feel free enjoy animations silhouettes dancing background type many people part your party paying your meal   I said before way much food choose but then again tend same dish 2 different sides  There's bar middle buffet but unfortunately drinks aren't free  bartender does announce occasion specials next 15 minutes    The fried rice restaurant quality steamed mussels cooked perfection  sushi rolls decent quality but don't expect awesome  appreciate fried goodness section which basically french fry medley fried cod fried clam strips fried shrimp fried scallops  Fried scallops! love scallops  just amazing! Oh yeah there's also clam chowder lemon baked chicken  Hungry now?  I Mirage's buffet last Thursday lunch sorely disappointed selection  If car drive bum ride off free shuttle coming Paris  <EOR> If going eat any Harrah's branch buffets recommend getting Buffet Buffet passes where eat any buffets 7 hotels 24 hours  only $50 wrist band non hotel guests  wristband walk any buffets line scan in  Simple!  The Carnival World Buffet huge selection food pretty tasty  Chinese American Italian even station where pho egg noodles when order it  dessert bar ginormous!   The reason why gave place 3 stars because cashier lady super mean! She's old cranky holds line  trip good but nasty attitude ruined day good 5 minutes  hahah But really she pretty bad though  She going put wristband asked politely if she loosen before she sticks permanently because didn't want wrist band tight  She started screaming saying she's putting tight policy she puts herself  told tight 113 degrees outside don't want wrist getting sweaty because wristband don't rip off because going wet if sweat   I put pinky between wrist band arm when she puts it'll little loose super tight she tried slap hand  SERIOUSLY! She's wrist band waterproof stop that! said just asking please put tight uncomfortable  she WON'T!    Such b! Ugh    people behind which lot people saw happened made scene rude she was  just walked off food because much drama    I think she's regular employee buffet because next day when came back she slow holding line again but she just scanned wristband no communication going thank goodness  <EOR> Very good maybe best value dinner buffet if don't spring extra $15 seafood option  Although didn't try maybe worth but plenty seafood options regular buffet well   Good selection Asian dishes including dim sum some decent sushi really good spicy mayo sauce side honestly enjoyed some other dishes well   Best prime rib anywhere cooked rare dynamite au jus sauce  Dessert pretty good some varieties gelato although good Caesar's Bacchanal buffet  <EOR> Longest buffet ever seen  bit just every cuisine around world  Tasted pretty good <EOR> We lunch week while Vegas   many stations eat from! pricey   2 adults 2 kids $85 plus tips   found food average  same quality better Golden Corral  thought mexican food unappetizing   Normally favorite but did even touch it   did fried shrimp clam chowder bread pudding bacon cheese potatoes  <EOR> #1 buffet Vegas!

WORST experience buffet Rio brunch Sunday    The line long  waited hour  Which fine    It $50 bucks two us  OK    Once when all terribly wrong  Yes crab  BUT       We both finished plate before some come ask drink order  then pulling teeth trying flag server down more mimosa's  Even though waited hour empty tables everywhere! wasn't really busy  dirty plates sat small  table far long before cleared    We shared napkin while because couldn't find anywhere server missing    The sushi looked worse grocery store grade sushi being generous    No bagels cream cheese  the????   The eggs benedict tasted perfume  ewww    Did mention couldn't find server more champagne mimosa's     Seriously everything greasy though wide variety choose thought all garbage    Sorry Rio  <EOR> Decepcionante ! primer punto dicen que es el más grande del mundo y no es cierto ! El de xcaret Cancún es mucho más grande los platillos bastante regulares ! Nada del otro mundo   <EOR> This first time ever eating casino buffet   really hyped excited try since looked very big gourmet   But unfortunately tastes most foods did live looks   foods did taste good because drenched oil butter and or loaded cheese   Even huge appetite mine thought place little pricey considering mediocre quality food  <EOR> In movie Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory scene where children enter big room filled candy eyes lit mouths dropped open started gorge themselves every bit candy could hands on   Rio Buffet starring yours truly eyes lit mouth dropped open started digging everything could fit plate!  Close your eyes   make wish    and probably find Carnival World Buffet!  largest buffets biggest variety food ever seen   your favorite type food?  probably here!  thoroughly impressed Asian station including various soups the hot sour favorite! pho freshly prepared while wait!

WRONG! food basically same you'll find all buffets town except four times money!

Yeah   there ton food but  all interesting   decor boring enough put sleep   If hotel guest stand different line pay using machine   happened human contact?  bit pricey $25 00 dinner   The desserts  which always worst buffets actually pretty good here   But would again   probably not    <EOR> Variety was Nice but seemed place quantity over quality  crab legs are So so Skinny and Cold  them all stacked looks like A Skinny crab leg Bush  When u Crack them Open meat sitting pile long its almost stuck the Shell and Doesn't come Out nice piece crab meat should instead come strands pieces strands  No Bueno   But     prime rib very flavorful gelato wonderful  Service good huge selection but times some dishes reminded scene Vegas vacation  <EOR> WARNING MANAGEMENT RUDE DISRESPECTFUL trains staff way well!  If could give location zero stars would    Quick food review tonight 8 02 15 food no better other buffets area   birthday dinner fairly disappointing especially price   should gone elsewhere Lotus Siam eaten something much better quality well reliably undeniably delicious less!   The reason am angry however friend another couple seated nearby treated staff   couple originally seated booth next ours while   together refill plates     which point seating hostess placed new people table!  only original couple obviously finished table hadn't even cleared yet!  When returned table obviously confused   newly seated people rude dismissed them which point seating hostess swooped said oh fault let's sit guys over here  you're expecting people who'd paid $30 each eat much want leave when finished just ok being unceremoniously moved mid meal?!?  RUDE      By time friend nearly ready whereas couple who'd moved couple rows over still mid meal   over them apologized imposing told them friend seen transpired asked if would find manager them speak to   asked if visitors they were said local did want experience ended telling the big thing happened while Vegas  suggested should comped meal thought good idea would ask when manager came talk them   off find manager   As bringing manager table seating hostess tried pull aside saying need talk minute  don't need talk them they're fine  She already trying trouble   manager started talking couple told he'd come talk afterward but could already tell he wasn't planning doing anything   Sure enough when he over table he said he'd tried comp them but wouldn't take  course not   when your staff encouraged intimidate customers into complaining or guilt them into getting staff member into trouble    wasn't happy because obviously someONE them change minds whether seating hostess manager himself     At point he started attacking asking why even cared since didn't happen me  Because right offended right speak when other people rude those around  why! He made show listening but interrupted frequently rolled eyes while talking which called on   He asked if anything he could visit better said since he wasn't listening paying attention WHY upset couple reseated and point rude way he speaking wasn't anything he could going leave dissatisfied  never come back  <EOR> After eating Rio Seafood Buffet stuffed! Well guess would happen any buffet  selection great only thing missing Indian food  would wonderful   Anything pizza CRAB seafood sushi prime rib nachos tacos Chinese food made spot salad soups DESSERT!  That buffet never ending  stretches mile seems long  wait staff attentive nice    The crab great fresh just wish better things crack pick them guess bring your own if them  desserts eye opening! GELATO! Tiramisu flavor good  cheesecake was     mouth watering creamy goodness  red velvet cake! woo hoo!  A must when Vegas  <EOR> This buffet looks really impressive but really variety more though quality  nice because party five all different tastes but nothing good something I'd way eat again  did Greek salad really good but when back seconds no where found    I'd again only if trying please large group varying tastes otherwise I'd take pass  <EOR> Short explanation Bacon omelettes  I can't recall last time bacon perfectly cooked flavorful  ate much bacon there   Omelette spending years trying good omelette home short order chef woman taught just observing  now something almost good home  wish could back again learn all over sure didn't miss anything is omelette really complicated? yes! I 24 hour pass came 3 times few weeks ago  Did place used open 24 hours? disappointed see closed 10    Everything great can't give 5 stars because buffet reviews basically comparing them others especially Vegas there's always possibility there's something better  convinced though most hotels food same suppliers we're all just imagining superior other Selection OK but wish just few more things  like more types same cuisine  surprised see pho dinner but considering popularity last few years sense  Don't expect good sushi sashimi bar  definitely there   Just don't same mistake did your pass expires  lost track time being inside hotel 2 days waited line 20 minutes only pass cashier look funny    Will ever see buffets list basic ingredients? hope because things tried avoid because didn't know made allergies     I'll back someday but gotta see rest  world first! <EOR> The dude omelet station looks Walter Matthau's twin!!

Let start saying layout RIO pretty ingeniously done designers buffet maximize time distance customers walk while dining fill faster eat less due being lazy having walk clear other side dining hall more favorite dish  Now am no lazy SOB routinely run bike 100 miles week but damned if didn't seated farthest end seafood area which favorite foods 500 ft walk section just another plate 2 crab  Thing crab legs weak small only plate didn't even bother heading back another   So how's sushi selection ask? Well other yelper's commented typically  less most run mill mom pop Chinese buffets $8 10  Considering RIO more 3 times price downright pathetic!! am literally talking maybe 6 7 different types rolls it! No sashimi no fancy handmade sushi's    NOTHING! almost couldn't believe usually sushi section area most buffets crazy on   strike RIO   The second thing immediately pissed off place total lack healthy options featured here  I'd say solid 70 75% items fried breaded literally dripping fat buttery sauces  Lets honest people   anything deep fried usually pretty low quality very cheap think fish sticks fries tater tots    etc   more fried items buffet typically more low grade restaurant RIO sure case respect  prime rib which usually hit almost exclusively 3 4 fat grizzle not exaggeration   only but man carving meat gave slice wouldn't fed hamster course when laughed asked 3 times amount he mumbled something tossed another chunk plate then turned literally walked away    I mean WTF! am 240 lb dude   obviously am going eat take tell EAT looks me  whole place freakin stingy swear if managers told employees any food wasted thrown coming paychecks    Moving on   strike 3 solidified 'never again' RIO dessert bar  could described single word    WEAK!!!! Now am big dessert eater typically only stick fat free sugar free desserts ice creams but swear doing lap around dessert island am pretty sure Hometown buffet double selection here's real kicker     most items behind glass ask attendant everything want! Once again understand people take much end wasting food especially kids dessert assume notorious being taken tossed but come fuc* man   I hope your sitting before reading next no     this joke  actually served ice cream little plastic cups ones fill condiments sauces fast food restaurants  $32 per person handed fuc*ing 1 oz plastic cup 1     yes 1 mouthful sugar free ice cream  point confusion actually turned into rage thinking $$ friends just dropped better options access much cheaper    Most negative reviews spot on    this place downright SUCKS!!! food highly sub par and standards below average best complaining service food means restaurant should most likely condemned demolished  would honestly even again waste gas money even if free voucher pitiful  Maybe gone downhill recently 4 5 star reviews while ago perhaps people wrote those just won $10k slots elated box dog poo would given 5 stars    I don't know but know never back Carnival buffet RIO again   End rant  <EOR> Went lunch still SUPER YUMMY!!! <EOR> THE WORST FOOD EVER! only reason even giving them because nice server amount selection have  chose visit buffet because variety offered some friends fond seafood  Although your ticket good 24hours alternative buffets food fresh taste good   would rather hometown buffet closest 711 some snacks eat rather visit place again   All food hard bite into flavorless   price $50 person treat yourself 5 star restaurant! <EOR> Where else fish hamburger taco corndog pizza eggs mashed potatoes fried chicken ribs ice cream pie chinese food chili clam chowder beer ice tea milk soda ALL SITTING?????

For some reason magnet Rio always coming back   far memory take think only buffet ever Vegas   But then again memories don't really exist Vegas due consumption mass quantities alcohol   Hadn't YEARS talking back when high school last time 5 years give take some years it leaves age ambiguous    Walking your table finding your way through maze   Seriously took almost five minutes   then worst part when you're drooling corner your mouth completely stacked plate food hand can't find where sitting!  wanted just plop down middle floor start eating hands    I think between boyfriend 9 plates food plus more enough servings dessert   I full end meal tempted just walk around stomach pushed look pregnant no would question if really not  Gosh hope never happens though  <EOR> I came brunch old high school friend   foolish think would locals discount weekend  buffet still worth regular price because huge variety choose from  love crab legs because salty some places  use some muscle yank them ice because pack them pretty tight!

My whirlwind journey through Las Vegas ended hoped world's best buffet at least  billboard said   Instead ended raunchy gut busting round queasiness  Both before meal   If nightmare congested self pay line wasn't enough send running depressing atmosphere equally depressing looking food demanding refund  dining area attempts set mood deeply colored furniture requisite ambient lighting but fails miserably actually feels dark dank dungeon  reminder inescapable nonrefundable world hurt  Sampling little bit every corner found dim sum particularly sui mai har gow bland barely lukewarm and    rubbery? quesadillas cold pancakes soggy even before put syrup them crab legs forgettable    fact most food forgettable honestly remember else ate  filled 5 plates sad looking food most part made pretty sad eat   I know all thinking Carnival World Buffet deserves props combining American Chinese Japanese Mexican etc  cuisine  But couldn't fact shouldn't executed *better*? <EOR> well done Flamingo Casino !

CLOSING $15 buffet doesn't cheap food service NUTS      you'd hard pressed that  <EOR> When Vegas eat buffets generally find they're all nearly identical each buffet having its own factor  place stand apart other places service served ice cream    Unlike other buffets service friendly  unfamiliar using tools eat crabs asked waiter he kindly showed us  He didn't just describe process but he literally hands dirty showed use it   great service  He didn't but he did   The food overall good can't really say best since reigning champions Wynn Belagio  But price price pretty good  if Buffet Buffets deal $49 99 your choice 6 buffets within 24 hours but discount $5 per person if join total rewards member  brings your price down $49 99 place incredibly cheap worth going  6 buffet choices would say easily better ones  Don't even attempt going Imperial Palace one   That little iffy even though main hotel heh     Would come again? YES  But given price however  most likely Buffet Buffets deal again  Much better deal pig eat all day if want to  <EOR> Is best buffet town? knows really depends your definition good buffet is  say favorite buffet Vegas locals only paying $12 99 dinner    its best values town! love wide selection items choose never bored eating same thing  Some days its made order teppanyaki bar amazing other days its Prime Rib best town heck why throw corndog its only corndog good measure? place seems unlimited array items choose even pickiest eater should able find something    What impresses most service usually very good  Drinks always full plates cleared timely manner people serving generally good mood  Its another buffet where meat nazi cutting off tiny portions flank steak irritated when asked more    6ft 200lbs eat more then that    hello think burned more calories standing line Im gonna little slab called meat    but digress  even waiter gives GF little bit hard time because she gets same thing every time there    place fun serve good food    I think if looking good place eat great local prices Rio Buffet should your list  Just sure local ID your Players Club Card  <EOR> I don't usually review places but standards pre recession!! Drum roll!!! No but seriously bad ass buffet terms selection  very eclectic liked concept if noodle bar where could pho ramen wonton soup some other kind Asian noodle dish create basically subway   pork belly which thought cool some pretty good meats carving station tons other things can't into detail because drunken nature moment  said desert bar slammin!  Mid back heartbeat  if 24 hour wait all other high end buffets! <EOR> Despite being strip worth coming here    I 24 hour pass 7 buffets Rio just happened list  Since well known buffet family thought should try out  First off let tell wait buffet ridiculous but guess expected  packed!

Rio last buffet before buffet pass expired before leaving Vegas  buffet HUGE all kinds international variety which definitely made more interesting    Some notable features Custom stir fry station Hand scooped gelato dessert station! Definitely try Cookies'n'Creme Strawberry Mango Orange the last two might depend individual taste palettes Plates lot smaller other two buffets while isn't really problem leads more trips buffet which would little inconvenient if seated end buffet coming back other end  <EOR> Widest selection foods choose all Buffet Buffet restaurants   But if going dinner busy weekend Buffet Buffet deal prepared wait very long time seated   arrived 7 didn't actually seated until 8 30 9 PM   buffet items general very good various regions world but probably won't try buffet again unless am actually staying Rio due very long wait  <EOR> This best buffet Vegas   Totally worth shuttle ride off strip   It's almost expansive   it's hike back forth forget where saw dishes   seriously!

Everything could possibly want   food just meh though   better quality food Golden Corral   did sushi although selection lacking   All food good  didn't anything bad just nothing really stood out   Considering price food Vegas Strip area though $25 wasn't bad much food menu  <EOR> I wanted eat because always heard Rio great buffet     I wish wasted time    I waited line hour just pay then another 10 minutes seated    They provided no way crack crab ended hurting fingers  rest food tasted pretty much cafeteria food  40 bucks person feel entirely worth it  Plus Rio really run down looking didn't even enjoy hanging around eating  <EOR> Food delicious plentiful but service HORRIFIC! guy table ate two plates food before brought something drink   table next complained manager afterwards servers all gathered gasp fact someone complained   server seemed really busy all time but probably given many tables take care of   champagne brunch didn't enough champagne  <EOR> The food good! groupon made great deal  would eat again loved loved salad bar  Lost star wait being 45 mins seated  aspect little disorganized  <EOR> I Saturday champagne brunch bottomless mimosas wonderful which probably why rated 3 stars   don't particularly care buffets but alright  where sitting journey plateful crab legs  Besides crab legs mimosas nothing else really stood me   The buffet kind difficult find friend security escorted all way over resulting work before meal  <EOR> I Rio buffet today Lunch around 12 30pm  seated diamond seven star lounge  soon sat down start eating heard sawdust cutter construction going during busiest time lunch! shocked see man saw dusting wood 10 feet away food! health violation! Every diamond seven star guest looked each other look disgust shock Rio no respect people's lunch health risks subjected people to! table personally asked man stop he doing concerned health room full VIPs eating ! man continued cutting wood! did eat left ! Maybe Rio doesn't know health hazards violations! downloaded them well pictures ignorant man putting people's health risk ! <EOR> Definitely quantity over quality  buffet many selections international cuisines however none food really memorable  example sushi section consisted very basic rolls no sashimi  Some food good such Italian pasta but nothing exceptional  only thing somewhat stood dessert bar  buffet serves variety gelato sorbeto scoops good if want sample few flavors  <EOR> A colleague suggested Rio buffet conference ended  normally opposed buffets since seem believe stuffing beyond all reason compensation mediocre food   I surprised Rio  quantity certainly didn't cheat mentality full effect  food itself actually decent  some prime rib near perfect  Frankly when crab legs many possible  excellent situation  desserts very good without being sweet  waiter cleared table quickly efficiently   The only downer observing unabashed gluttony other individuals  colleagues noted listening people complain enough when they've two pounds lobster tails just shameful  <EOR> Came since AFAN 2 1 haven't since kid  tried majority buffets keep hearing spot only fair try out   The renovation nice modern remember when all pink hot air balloons rio samba kind decor  lot better   So most people crabs today fresh just good Rio Seafood Buffet duh! same casino same supplier   peel n eat cocktail shrimps slit top where peel shrimp easy motion  lot people carved meats prime rib good  also ham turkey beef roast well but wasn't feeling trying  little sake maki salmon sushi fresh today    Odd standouts shrimp crab salad firm mango chunks spicy mayo    I put bread roll actually good seafood sandwich    Oh did coconut gelato bananas foster top bomb  Took bites other things looked good but didn't taste great    Like every buffet hits okay misses   usual but there's decent ratio good over bad  Now $23 99 worth good items? don't think so  good but far best buffet Vegas    think 2 1 special Locals 50% off Mon Thurs deal good value worth it  If pay full price would upgrade myself few more dollars eat Wynn Bellagio  feel more bang buck    Food guess 3 but bump 4 star because think nice thing good deal locals    what other place does any kind promotion that? knowledge only  much rather eat 50% off price point any buffets lower price range Station Casinos  <EOR> Not worst buffet but definitely best  gotten more expensive time passes no reason  Because buffet does kind quality anymore hiking prices that!  Ambiance 3 buffet always very clean its stations very organized  tables much  Tables rather scattered disorganized bit dirty when sit down    Service 4 server very good extremely funny  He really always took care constantly refilling drinks even getting extra plates when ate some crabs crawfish!   Food 2 only things really worth eating buffet crab dessert  But time even crab legs just sub par only having little bit meat inside  rest food just average  there's really nothing say because well nothing really stood out!  Carnival used better cheaper buffet bigger crab legs slightly better food! But now going Village Seafood Buffet just way way better idea spending money Carnival  <EOR> Been probably over 2 dozen times various friends  Service always good although note only sat Diamond section  Price par similar buffets nearby strip  50% locals discount running which great deal but sometimes theres long lines dinner if don't platinum higher Total Rewards card bypass line  Very large selection can't say tried every single item there  most part its fairly decent buffet  <EOR> This buffet great  may best buffet but damn good  gelato which sold steak delicious  even $4 drink special 20 minutes time which never seen before  <EOR> Was seriously disappointed place  only saving grace prime rib  general food much cafeteria side  Sorry Harrah's diamond member nice stand line but wasn't exactly wonderful experience  ice cream bar nice though  <EOR> What's first things think when talk Vegas? most gambling drinking all night Elvis all eat buffets  Now used day when could come Vegas pay $30 hotel room $6 buffet  which gorged yourself point wouldn't want eat rest day  concept could spend less money food lodging more gambling   But those days gone      The buffet cost $25 person but told if look around ways two fers discounts  value pretty decent though when walk inside you'll see it  buffet itself long football field  Seriously massive end to end  menu ranges your typical buffet affair prime rib salad etc even sushi bar wood fired pizza  also buffet bit different alcohol bar if pay attention offer $1 drinks every half hour so   The quality food good but I'd avoid getting end meal session turnover another if want freshest stuff  Some things constant but menu items change between meals usually stop refilling 30 minutes before change   The service really good  drink server despite being very busy attentive  beverage never empty when shifted soft drink coffee as dessert she didn't grumble bit  best part though visit arrived late  other buffets they'll warn only few minutes then kick or charge higher meal price   server let know change but despite paying breakfast allowed stay through lunch    The Carnival World Buffet amazing buffet best strip  must when visit come hearty appetite  But sure dedicate couple hours eating won't able experience fully    Four Stars based on Awesome selection Great service Decent quality  If regular price less would Five Stars  <EOR> I just back place bread queen merely 4 hours ago still full  original reason why Vegas weekend celebrate end finals take opportunity having free hotel room Mirage but show beloved bread queen international buffet looked like  didn't disappoint all    Still full big ass brunch unflavorful Flavors buffet Harrah's decided commit seven deadly sins gluttony here  When usually eat buffet only things most but being converted picky foodie journeyed try finish everything buffet offer  Mission over accomplished    Ranging italian american comfort chinese japanese bread cuisine place all  only thing wrong today temperature issue  Quality all food great even bountiful desserts  server also way friendlier livelier morning server  ate 7 plates food probably consumed over 5000 calories alone but all worth it  top all off booth nearest buffet line Diamond area no interruptions present   Must tries Prime Rib girl tripping melts your mouth literally BBQ Regular Ribs fall bone tender but flavorful enough satisfy masses Korean BBQ Ribs can't wrong wherever given Honey Baked Ham sweet meets savory  Shrimp butterflied flavorful without marinara Shrimp Pizza shrimp lover    must say more?

Well well prepared food no matter good food buffet sloppy eaters heat lamps inevitably detract taste food   Further unlike some take piles snow crab legs prefer food don't fight sliver minor pleasure   also dislike price value   cheap buffets usually poor quality good ones overpriced   mention never spent less 30 minutes line buffet good day   That said why one?  First if local price dinner 1 2 price only $13 50 so   bring least party 4 price   Next Sushi Sandwiches buffet matches quality quantity any buffet   Plenty chef stations keep fresh food coming   Even kids load plates here   roast beef Turkey properly cooked both med rare medium pieces available   sushi firm tasty lukewarm slightly fishy tasting some lesser buffets      There some cleanliness issues last time but seemed abberation   Overall best buffets Vegas  <EOR> OMG line ridiculously long   swear almost passed waiting it   early afternoon probably waited over hour    think would faster because its buffet saw ton tables open Its good kiosk process payment tad faster   If you're big group prepared wait longer   Your best bet split if want eat    The food just okay   different types food ranging Mexican Asian breakfast Japanese etc   seafood going for   actually wanted all seafood place Rio but actually only open evening    The buffet 25 bucks typical Las Vegas price tag   dessert plentiful enjoyed getting gelato    My pick buffets Vegas would still  Wynn Cravings Mirage  <EOR> Look forward munching here!

Seated pretty smoothly waited quick but waitress seemed disappear thereafter  Carnival wide variety styles BBQ Mexican Asian Italian American but Las Vegas buffet terms hardly spectacular  Most choices seemed bit aged lack crowd didn't necessitate constant attention buffet line  Didn't really try anything noteworthy   just your run of the mill buffet  Staying Rio bit off strip may prompt hotel guests stay close stop bite but I'd hardly catching cab Caesar's eat Carnival  Long story short   decent price typical array buffet cuisines average execution  <EOR> Prime rib  excellent tender flavorful  But horseradish hot least  Big minus me  If prime rib au jus champagne only Its worth $25  The place wreaks musty smoke even though no appeared smoking  Low class people eating there  No good seafood!!!!!!! Peel eat trout jerky  Everything else didn't meet McDonald's standards   Tried Mango chocolate cookies cream gelato would pass too  I am very sure RIO once superior quality now    It compares $10 asian buffet  <EOR> DELICIOUS! much variety great service  All only 25 bucks!
