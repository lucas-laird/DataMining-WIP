Very easy find  Great location  Food gets quick  You'll spend $20 two people     totally worth every penny  <EOR> What yummy find!  You create your own bento choose pre made choices  opted Mochiko Bento bf chose Furikake Bento    Let start off saying oh goodness portions ridiculous! generous! No really  could share bento someone would both still super full    Anyway choose white brown fried rice  Fried rice upcharge $1 25 something  Kinda pricey know but wanted try it  ask veggies just chose peas carrots corn   tasty  best fried rice but liked it  needed more flavor though  somekindof seasoning  Maybe garlic salt? egg fried rice  another negative thing   Mochiko chicken more salty side usually mochiko more sweet side  liked chicken katsu stick  Dipped Teri sauce sweet chili aioli sauces all free btw just ask all good condiments! Teriyaki steak tender chewy  Boyfriend loved bento too  He finished all shrimp Mac salad! did even touch house salad  just wasn't fan all   All all portions definitely very generous food tasty but watch price rack if add extra things  <EOR> Great find came suggestion co worker now can't 2 weeks without coming back   Its all just good   can't without macaroni salad portions big when coming lunch always enough left over dinner too  <EOR> I'd give place 4 5 stars if could  only thing  stopping giving 5 kind pricey  bento $10 depending get  But your money's worth because portions size pretty large bento combos come plenty food  just I'd rather pay less less food more money food may finished  But  just me   Anyways Mochiko bento which came Mochiko chicken salad rice shrimp tempura chicken katsu beef skewers  said plenty food also tastes good  particularly liked chicken Katsu  something flaky breading made taste better  rice comes furikake which nice too  place worth visit <EOR> Trying give RiceTrax fair shot but 3 5 times new location they've run pork fried rice  Never really ran into problem old location maybe they're adjusting new location demand running out??    I won't back while probably call ask if they've run pork before do  Seems weird thing place known fried rice   I've brought friends family kinda sad its same  <EOR> Mochiko chicken pretty good fried shrimp little bland fried purple potatoes really good but only 3 little pieces when order side  Fried rice pretty good  Definitely must when visiting Vegas  <EOR> When craving some garlic chicken Rice Trax place   starters serving size boxes huge reminds plate lunches back Hawai`i   Compared other places Vegas don't mind paying $10 amount food actually tastes ono! <EOR> I definitely update if ever chance actual try place  Last time old location closed randomly during normal operating hours  Today food closed  much say except maybe never meant eat ^ ^ lol <EOR> I know long since update cause totally slacking Bento Action!
