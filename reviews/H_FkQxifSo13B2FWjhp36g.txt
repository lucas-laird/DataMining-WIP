WTF? Oh can't change alter any menu item because great Mario wants served certain way    I won't back ever again  <EOR> This favorite places dine Vegas!  First off located Saint marks square Venetian  outside patio seating indoor wine rooms  decor warm home y live show band plays classical music every hour  ceilings around 80 feet they're beautifully painted resemble clouds feels if you're outside! The food service both spectacular!  I tried braised pork shoulder tender flavorful cucumber salad top great! I also rigatoni pasta veal rich hearty  veal cooked perfection very savory! I also tried caprese salad which die for  during time cherry tomatoes season liked sweetness it  deserts offer also amazing! pistachio olive oil gelato creamy amazing!  The service great! Everyone staff managers servers even hosts all kind warm!  I love place want continue coming back long possible! <EOR> This first time may last  huge fan Batali! even mom's shop Salumi Seattle because admire guy but say really disappointed pizza    I think tell good pizza place try Margarita Pizza due its simplicity freshness ingredients which should used  saltiest pizzas ever life  sauce probably saltiest  Horribly disappointing! SMH  even started off meat plater allowed waitress select meats us  Biggest mistake ever  Nothing memorable    I kept simple ordered house wine  good  best house cabs ever had    We bill found wine bought $20 Glass  Seriously? could've ordered own glass! Wow  If subtract glass tab then reasonable  Around $50 appetizer pizza decent Batali restaurant  Batali salted last pizza  Needs work  Batali even came taste food yet he busy spending time Carnevino  Which fabulous BTW  <EOR> The summer lived New York visited Otto often possible taking advantage $4 vegetable pots combined excellent light take out dinners  remember getting little containers filled beets rabe mushrooms eating them alone Washington Square Park  Otto less affordable original  even New York can't rip off quite Vegas  but equally pleasant excellent food casual friendly ambiance   Otto Venetian central spot formerly occupied Enoteca San Marco which more less Otto another name  dine faux al fresco under painted Venetian sky yield gleeful corniness your surroundings  husband came late dinner right off Friday night flight Vegas  reservation but looked could've walked in  waiter Eli L  excellent  He took time recommending both food wine attended all needs warmth absolute competence   We drank red wine glass  Montepulciano Barbera  and indulged wonderful meal  fresh bread olive oil balsamic ordered big spread starters  prosciutto di Parma coppa which both excellent well plate gooey taleggio served black truffle honey syrup stewed cherries apricots  also pot Otto pickles which overflowed baby carrots cauliflower fennel radish turnip all crisp zippy brine  Feeling extra indulgent fresh off plane caprese oven roasted cherry tomatoes pesto milky burrata  Entrees probably unnecessary point but did finish pastas alacrity  linguini special cooked nice al dente shrimp garlic chile  husband tagliatelle butternut squash brown butter sage  sweet but he liked it  ended decadent meal bowl sorbet gelato  huckleberry lemon olive oil all perfect perfect together   Dinner expensive but tends happen Vegas thought very worthwhile  food service atmosphere all point I'd recommend Otto anyone looking sit down good Italian meal  <EOR> I visited restaurant twice during visit Vegas   first time everything well   But second night ate server Sabrina really bad attitude   Maybe she didn't want work day   However did inform manager he didn't seem care much   ate appetizer visited another restaurant continue dinner   pretty amazed Mario Batali would associate name such horrible restaurant  <EOR> Some reviewers adored Otto Enoteca   think Otto heads examined  sorry couldn't help it On side pizza thin crispy close real Neapolitan pizza long time     Other service fair good place very busy but service kind slow bordering attentive long waits between waiter's visits table     Dinner longer wanted felt even longer due setting St  Mark's Square  realize many people find fake street scene environment Venetian novel even charming      However location simply relaxing loud echoes gym full people lots people   music amplified acoustic street performers sounded echo chamber sky vaulted reflected any sound below   People watching interesting but only two steps above freak show strip typical bachelorette parties crotch length dresses wasted dudes re enacting Hangover tee shirt covered pot bellies   short lot American tourists   kind sucked charm factor

The next trip Otto ordered Caprese again along grilled tuna no more broccoli rabe though   round meal ordered Bucatini all'Amatriciana tomato cured pork onion which we'd somehow missed previous trip if seen would ordered beginning! Again Caprese sublime tuna  bucatini also amazing point needed more bread then fingers sure every last bit sauce left plate    Our third trip Otto varied slightly  Caprese bucatini but mixed ordering Marinated Chicken Paillard arugula fried eggplant ricotta   Paillard delicious simple yet expertly prepared  eggplant nice thick slab creamy ricotta complemented rest dish nicely   All all only disappointment broccoli rabe everything else just wonderful!

My son pasta dish Cartierra      also looked boring plate   just pasta   no other accompaniment     waiter never grated any cheese over pasta being done other pasta dishes being served    $17  In celebration wedding anniversary ordered usual Bombay Saphire Gin tonic   when bill found charged $14 cocktail should called manager over made scene   I've NEVER life charged such exhorbitant amount Bombay Gin tonic nor would ever expect again lifetime   c'mon Mario kidding me!  Now dessert fiasco   we ordered Dolce Giorno   which three different gellato selections served cream puffs   what first three different scoops gellato served bowl all squished together liken large scoop?   when said ordered dessert served would thought all hell going break loose   the waitress's jaw dropped wasn't fault   and then manager wanted know why she bringing dessert back replacement?   price tag   $12  All told mediocre meal   a $111 tab plus tip   I agree other star commenter   these TV star restauranteurs could care less if ever see again constant turnover travelers Las Vegas provides huge pool sitting ducks just waiting plucked   And way Mario if would try good hanger steak please visit nearest Cheesecake Factory  they sell theirs Hibachi steak slightly more half your price   Lastly would recommend wonderful Las Vegas restaurant dined called Table 34  great food wonderful service gin tonic   $8 <EOR> Took wife Otto's anniversary prior seeing Rock Ages    Started 3 cheese sample olives 2 carnes   cheeses came dipping sauces honey black truffle oil   cheeses olives carne great   dinner wife quatro fomagi pizza lamb meatballs   pizza wood fired crust thin crispy  Very favorable sauce cheeses   meatballs great tender full flavor     Otto's extensive wine list waiter glad help pair wine appetizers dinner  Service great attentive whole dinner   Otto's expensive portions large but quality flavor surpass both  those issues  would given Otto's 5 stars but only complaint few minutes getting cheese carne dinner came  would great sit enjoy appetizer rushing it  <EOR> Had fun relaxing meal here  party 6 which included 2 12 year olds loved Gnocho  Fritto caponata assorted cheeses salads  Half ordered pasta half ordered pizza  pizza outstanding  sat outside grand canal  people watching A+ if going Vegas might well fully embrace illusion enjoy spectacle vantage point  Great wine list very pricey  <EOR> The girl desk wouldn't let three seven Antipasto wine tasting menu  took photo TODAY website shows hours Antipasto menu  am very displeased DISAPPOINTED can't say Otto Enoteca bad restaurant  Ive several times before  But REMOVE them Vegas rotation list  <EOR> We best service here  waiter informed helpful   ordered two pasta dishes both amazing  Especially black linguine  fried dough sliced prosciutto  Pizza also looked good  which less expensive way eat here  Definitely better choice Carnivino which another same chefs restaurants  because price point but because food much better  <EOR> Terrible experience!!!

Which know seasonal  However online menu said them  Second zucchini fritti simply    fried zucchini! didn't either! The service just OK  Nothing jump down about  waiter brought  Age breadsticks asked if wanted sparkling flat water then disappeared    even told when mentioned water wanted some drinks  Even lackluster    no question vodka wanted no suggestions wine anyone else @ table    nothing  So service ease menu say fail! However    however!!! food great! Pizza spot nice taste great chew crispy crust! Just way should be  also arancinj brussels which would highly recommend!

Damn Yelp!  This faux outdoor sidewalk caf looks swanky classy distance but if look closer you'll see waiters wearing jeans  Which cool   The menu contains all usual overpriced hard to pronounce staples typical North American Italian restaurant tries hard  something two hundred different kinds wine choose if you're wine connoisseur pretend you'll heaven here   I ordered spaghetti meatballs because only item menu could articulate absolute certainty  Despite being smallest meatballs ever seen meal good  overpriced Bloody Cosmopolitan wash down think enjoyed too  I couldn't pronounce most drinks powdery but maybe supposed be  worried maybe ordered chick drink  wife didn't say anything though   The waiter assistant waiter both very cool laidback casual lady showed quiet table back   My only hang place prices  don't accurately reflect kind restaurant place actually is  casual atmosphere casual food even though names food little convoluted but charge if some high class renowned establishment  <EOR> Visited Thursday 12 00 PM lunch meeting   Service 4 0 5 waiter friendly attentive orders kept drinks fresh   Food 4 5 5 Started off Arancine   Saffron infused risotto bolgonese bufala mozzarella made cheese lover happy   Pappardelle suggestion Italian friend much knowledge food   LOVED thicker pasta overall dish tasty   portion Papardelle received significantly less dishes friends had   strawberry martini tasty but also little light portion   Value 3 0 5 pricey quickly if actively order great appetizer dessert selections   However extremely happy ones sampled time around   Ambiance Great place eat people watch St  Mark's square Venetian   Loud enough others can't hear your conversation yet quiet enough don't raise your voice   Summary Think higher end Maggiano's same pricing much better selection good much better quality   location being St  Marks Square Venetian enhances overall experience opinion   Enjoy  ! <EOR> We made dinner reservations group gals Friday evening  When arrived table ready but unfortunately tucked away very tight back corner  asked another table mentioned we'd happy wait one  hostesses really helpful seated 10 min later    What loved place location  felt outdoors Italy soaking sunshine daylight listening live music streets   Very charming touch part all magic Vegas!   The food though fell really short everything expecting Mario Batali  huge Food Network junkie  and dishes seen looks freaking incredible    just here  torn trying crab ravioli pappardelle   they both sounded amazing menu   as did truffle pizza!  After making toughest decisions night Pappardelle is  First off dark meat chicken  hate discriminate guys but more white meat chicken type gal here  looked past knowing great hands Mario's food   but nope  dish bland chicken beyond disappointing  girl friends ordered crab ravioli   I tried bite felt eating old seafood  crab really dry significant overpowering fishy taste it  Definitely palette  playing food decided carb pasta   There final pizza slice truffle pizza table girls certainly bet snatched it! probably best dish night  hindsight should probably ordered pizza passed pasta dishes  perfectly crisp truffle flavor good!   Also note substitutions alterations items menu  tried rejected real quick  Bummer    Service nice but sort became hit miss throughout night  felt some moments where waiter totally top everything other moments where wondered if he flown off Italy    <EOR> Service was   not good!  Very slow keep asking things took forever them  salads very good but everybody's pasta cooked all way nobody enjoyed meals  Bummer <EOR> I loved dinner Otto! friend enjoying girl's weekend Vegas stopped into Otto dinner  great table facing entertainment square  waiter really friendly walked through recommendations menu  decided start fried ricotta then share prosciutto pizza carbonara pasta   The fried ricotta delish basically little cheese balls little bit spice  Yum  pizza really good tons fresh prosciutto crust done just right  carbonara pasta pretty heavy odd but good taste if sense  think really stinky cheese used  don't know if would liked just single entre because rich but great combo pizza  waiter recommended white wine also complimented flavors perfectly overall well put together meal   I love Mario Batali's restaurants casual yet food top notch  would definitely back next time Vegas! <EOR> Great food!  Great atmosphere!  pancetta goat cheese pizza meatball pizza cauliflower appetizer   Simply delicious!!! <EOR> Just say no ! am disappointed restaurant chef especially  life threatening nut dairy allergies  simply asked waiter sub cow milk based cheese goat milk based cheese am allergic cows milk  Waiter said he needed ask chef  Ummm if am paying $14 just tiny plate argula tiny bit parm cheese issue  Plus also allergy said cheese  Waiter comes back says chef compromises texture salad  Wait what?? Seriously kidding me? Someone ego  plate greens cheese bottom line   So order caprise salad  Again advised nut dairy allergy  Guess comes yes correct nuts  dealing food allergies LONG time hands down only establishment down right dangerous those life threatening allergy chef's ego clearly trumps customer safety  sad  <EOR> Every time stay Palazzo sure include Otto  Being perfectly honest service  always somewhat sloppy but food selection great taking specifically cheese board small plates which always delicious interesting  We headed last night brought friends along but rather embarrassed entire experience!  More 20 minutes being seated friend finally find waiter  no food no drinks only bread least server attentive when bring company search service great experience   Then waiter finally shows ask want eat just added drink orders he would never taken them  kids ordered meal but ended having order again later when never showed note may kids but does mean okay compromise quality pizza over cooked way firm rushed afterthought bad The cheese board delicious always squash blossoms amazing but where ended  cauliflower burnt found waiter should probably just sent back salty deep brown black mostly left behind! also notable absence some previous lighter dishes tuna farro large emphasis fried heavier fare appeal gone    I always loved food put service but when both bad see no reason return   plenty other places good cheese boards better wine service worst received Vegas <EOR> its basically mall's food court  mean call is    fancy not  its inside grande canal shoppes which inside venetian which same huge property palazzo sands expo center  occasionally live opera singers some little acts perform arena area mote inside more little Italian river under roof  food court done really nicely always looks its day time due painted ceiling  its really your average mall food court  its way nicer  but apples always apples    dont tell them youre hurry  everyone working fast can  if youre really much hurry should packed sack lunch  <EOR> Food OK  WORTH PRICE  service good though  Ended espresso gelato  Tasted okay  <EOR> Definitely best Italian far actually  ordered sweet potato ravioli sage sauce decent but $24 6 small pieces  Outrageous prices  prices horrible service even worse  gave bread but brought olive oil when dinner coming out  said no mushrooms asparagus put pasta which saw plenty people did   not mention find very hard believe Italian restaurant no vegetables period as waiter informed us   number 2 friend's list places eat but think list needs reevaluated  location Venetian nice but pretty much best part restaurant  others group did pizza thought decent threw extra star that  <EOR> The location great but pizza horrific  ordered Quattro formaggi pizza thin limp thoroughly disgusting  I'd rather frozen Red Baron pizza place  top off service spotty  <EOR> Fan both celebrities run joint   problem nothing fully met expectations names   group large sampling menu   Some pasta undercooked sauces just OK   Meat cheese dishes good but nothing couldn't easily surpass your local Italian market if live near one    And biggest let down pizza   lot similar pizzas brick oven flat bread thin crust etc   ranks below par   price ridiculous   mediocre best premium price tag  <EOR> Ran quick lunch break show attending  Friend wanted pizza worked well  w looking more salad but nothing suited me  Asked waiter he rec'd chicken  broiled placed over nice piece grilled eggplant Roma tomatoes topped off ricotta mix  best plates while lunch dinner  Flavors incredible match finished plate  Buddies pizza good well also finished every bite  Might back try dinner if time permits  <EOR> Came first trip Vegas  Black spaghettini delicious!

without spending much in realm Strip restaurants without traveling far  Otto Enoteca fulfilled all those needs quite well  Located shops Venetian space surprisingly small big looks outside but able seated right away without reservation drinks water distributed very quickly   We all split some arancini fried rice balls which quite excellent much ended getting more orders start off  entree carbonara pizza which egg scallion guanciale top quite excellent  assumed egg would just runny yolk top but actually scrambled top which turned really well  scallion just enough bite cut through richness pizza finished pizza off quite quickly almost wanting some more    Service pretty helpful attentive much late afternoon group 12 hungry dudes  Prices pretty much par casual sit down Strip pizzas around $20 cocktails wine $11 12   Given names behind place Batali Bastianich pretty decent place Italian if you're staying Venetian but perhaps nothing your way for  Yet if need flexibility large party lunch casual dinner Otto Enoteca quite nicely  <EOR> During peak meal times wait table  bar instead enjoy fast service  Order cheese platter wine shopping break people watching  <EOR> The idea eating inside mall doesn't appeal but food Otto always satisfying back again again   The pizzas thin crispy  They're good table share along pastas  pasta portions smaller average restaurant but great pizza  Mario Battali's bucatini all'Amatriciana must try  <EOR> We tried place year ago loved much only place knew again when Vegas just before Thanksgiving  lovely little spot Venetian

But celebrating birthday instead just bringing desert say happy birthday asked dessert would if more important charge which didn't matter but common sense just bring charge after! <EOR> The Pizza Cannoli outstanding! Both fresh delicious! only two recommendations them start serving mochas second change music  playing loud rock music noon  didn't match ambiance restaurant all  hard time hearing other would nice hear something more appropriate such delicious noon time lunch  <EOR> Mediocre Italian Food  wife looking somewhere eat stumbled upon place  thought because Mario Batali's restaurants food must excellent  wife ordered meatballs ordered sausage peppers pizza  both found food underwhelming quite frankly worth charging  If only known Carmine's across street would gone instead  4 10 would recommend  <EOR> I pretty skeptical menu first since all item descriptions pretty plain  Everything turned really flavorful delicious though!  The truffle pizza really potato y just right amount truffle didn't overpower all flavor  also braised pork shoulder which really tender well seasoned  cucumber top really nice contrast texture gave refreshing bite    Being serenaded live music canal nice despite loud gaggles Asian tourists snapping photos iPads    This almost 4 star review but am docking star following reason The bill came while boyfriend bathroom put card paid  When check came back sign manager host he checking people but also checking tables assume he some kind manager handed boyfriend said Thank Stephen  may innocent mistake but definitely came off misogyny  21st century women allowed pick tab once while  Poor form! <EOR> We Arancini octopus salad  Arancini waaay cheesy but still lacked salt! octopus salad good   I ordered Pasta Norma just ok  Really did texture ricotta used dish   Hubby ordered spaghetti meatballs he enjoyed it   Overall expensive get  way many restaurants try ever give another chance  <EOR> I dinner enjoyed some simple but scrumptious menu    Started off mushroom bruschetta mushrooms tasty even if bread slightly crunchy side  topped light cheese I'm sorry don't know exactly kind cheese but tasted provolone some chives cut richness dish    For main ordered chicken paillard  dish many layers starting slice fried eggplant crunch bitterness  spread ricotta add creamy texture dish  then added layer tomatoes followed two layers grilled chicken  charred edges chicken added perfect amount smokiness offset ricotta  little bite little acid placed arugula dressed vinaigrette   little olive oil finished dish   beautiful dish worth try    For dessert pumpkin cheesecake  interesting dish composed both crispy pumpkin chips tastes similar sweet potato chips thicker slices boiled grilled  Underneath mascarpone the cheese cheesecake nuts graham cracker mimic flavours cheesecake  interesting dessert but definitely sweet finish  If want something sweet then something else gelato in house    The only nice thing lighting bit dark taste    Tip Daily specials great check back menu   Tip If you're designated driver night ask sodas also them fresh in house  <EOR>
