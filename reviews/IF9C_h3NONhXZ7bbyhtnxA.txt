I enjoyed Merguez since new taste spicy but fiery covered some fried onions   don't know if I'd order again since some other non familiar items menu also appealing   husband's schnitzel good too     There seems bit price disconnect between entrees sandwiches   platters $14 98 substantial amount food   same items baguette sandwich would only $2 less come no sides   really would preferred sandwich because wo man live bread alone even nothing inside but couldn't justify it   relive couscous experience tomorrow styrofoam gift box took home   Oh live Yelp don't unlimited data plan wifi!
