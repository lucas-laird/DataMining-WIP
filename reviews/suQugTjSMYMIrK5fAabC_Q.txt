Yeah   that's every time into here    The place never clean  Which kind feel authentic Tijuana taco shop  Honestly  always bare minimum clean    Which kind expected 24 hour place  But maybe closing few hours slow night deep cleaning would help   So always kind feeling gambling stomach but first couple times actually pretty decent finished eating   I usually carne asada fries  mean   throughout life carne fries  Years years San Diego SoCal always go to  gotten surprisingly better versions  say surprisingly because just every taco place Vegas kind disappointing  Even upper scale taco shops  But exactly way like   loaded!!! Loaded piles everything  meal!   But last time alternate go to because wanted something little smaller  California burrito guacamole added because apparently guacamole isn't included which basically carne fries burrito  $7 50  It took unusual amount time wasn't busy started getting uneasy feeling  cooks talking lot each other don't happening when waiting order especially if taking awhile  couple customers strange air filled place  noticed everyone waiting started looking over why orders taking long  bad sign   About hour eating started getting stomach cramps now 4am waking stomach pains  sure else could because only thing ate all day    I may still give place another chance but priority me  lack cleanliness alone usually enough find other places  <EOR> I love food here  green sauce always inconsistent though  day its mild day burns off your tongue  also super tired young man glasses calling beautiful everytime come in  Thanks compliment but when EVERY time gets annoying  just want food hit on  Otherwise place cool  <EOR> This place best carne asada fries Vegas great everyone line ordering them try them  guess  why everyone that  <EOR> Kind sketchy place 3am Saturday night but Roberto's best beef taco best chicken taco ever had   A perfect place late night meal ending bar crawl next door Cheers  Don't ask    <EOR> Best cheap 24 hour taco place town  Always good night drinking greasy carb filed hangover curing goodness  Try Carne Asad fries dollar tacos Wednesday   green sauce salsa bar  You'll thank yourself  <EOR> I can't imagine there's person Vegas some sort nightlife scene ended night big heap Roberto's   mean peanut butter jelly just hand hand   And let tell late weekend night few things better some Roberto's   rolled tacos guacamole good cheap snack quesadilla feed entire family combination plates sate even most drunken hunger   most famous however probably least consumed Chupacabra fries   Well  call them least since suck your soul   plate fries covered cheese salsa peppers know all type stuff TOP your usual Mexican fare   The odd thing Roberto's when during daylight hours loses some magic sometimes wonder eat all stuff 3 AM   But 3 AM roll around again fear magic return  <EOR> Other then cultures food Mexican food list   Coming Southern California could fall love Mexican Fast Food  Im glad Robertos reminds SoCal     <EOR> Sucks!
