Then noticed none 2 waiters manning whole lunch crowd using any serving trays   thought maybe tough them balance trays while try maneuver very tight restaurant space   restaurant many tables space   placed series connected small tables form very long table middle restaurant almost occupying full length dining area   Even very hard time maneuvering series long connected tables just walk table wall   end meal waiter asked if he put away dishes   said Sure ahead! Then right table while still trying finish drinks he started pouring accumulating all leftovers into container some contents spilling over splattering all over table!  waiter tried desperately stack all variously sized dishes bowls into column 2 trips putting away dishes   husband even tried helping several times because some dishes started tipping over   stressed just watching lol!
