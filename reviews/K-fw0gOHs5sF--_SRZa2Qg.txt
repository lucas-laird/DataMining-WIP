I've always liked Port Subs but think experience worth sharing   Their posted hours Sundays 9am 9pm   walk 7pm Sunday lights open sign blazing guy behind counter asked you? idiot am assumed open business   Evidently not   wasn't eyeballing counter hard didn't notice put bread such away until he very laboriously dragged back out   He sighed scowled entire time sarcastic rude whenever he spoke   He made extremely clear he wanted shop wished hadn't come in   also made clear re open register order   I've worked shop before really did feel guilty   know people come just before closing but never treated customer badly just some last minute business   But kicker 2 hours before posted closing time hadn't bothered turn off sign lock door even though apparently shut down register   mind reader don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless told   He could easily said sorry just closed would said oh sorry dude walked no problem   Though getting sandwiches parents sure could lived something else   same ingredients better ones home   glad wasn't getting anything myself because way man treated doubt would wanted eat it   I don't know why happened closing early don't care   just wish older gent served honest said they'd closed instead using precious five minutes treat rat turd lentil soup   Needless say put off doubt back  <EOR> Love Sandwiches   Always fresh bread hit spot    Very friendly workers always seem eager help you  <EOR> Let preface review saying if love Port Subs all means continue! am merely person own opinion don't pay wit attention this!
