Dropped fork new location Hualapai Way  While didn't need reservation due large party 20+ if arrived any later would wait sit bar   Since bar looked nice plenty seating plasma tv bar would acceptable   Atmosphere room very nice upscale but unpretentious   We brought bread which ok but nothing special  Skipping appetizers evening jumped right into main event A bow tie pasta garlic eggplant dish Nothing extraordinary but edible  Would again? No   A double bone veal chop roasted potatoes special excellent! veal chop perfect potatoes just crispy enough want more   Dessert Spumoni Pie looked tempting but little disappointing   cream puffs however outstanding should featured item    Service Could better  Slow very attentive  Perhaps partially due large party but definitely could use some improvement   Will back? Despite mixed reviews back try another pasta dish possibly veal chop again if available but definitely cream puffs  restaurant also known fresh seafood which needs tried and reviewed   <EOR> Location @ Hualapai Over booked incompetent ur choice  reservations arrived least 10 mins early total cluster i e FUBAR  Left anger poor girl front Hostess would call that totally over head  Would never return live 1 5 miles down road  Mgmt must Greedy  Worse relate       Reservations ahead time meant nothing being took everyone order anyway   NEVER RETURN <EOR> We dinner reservations which entry realized needed   waiter irritated immediately leading small table when other couples seated larger tables   told larger table would where would sitting evening   served warm but industrial Italian bread followed cups pasta fagioli brimming beans but much else including flavor   wife ordered eggplant Parmigianino virtually tasteless accompanied terrible marinara   cast lot penne chicken spinach pink sauce   Blah blah double blah   waiter continued earn paltry gratuity failing check back see enjoying meal if water glasses needed replenishing  <EOR>
