But full afterwards skip desert  We back try more think sit table chairs <EOR> I love Nacho Daddy  Thai Chicken Nacho's Chicken Enchilada Nacho's best! could eat those every day! street tacos also good service always consistently good <EOR> I thought food good esp  considering basically sports bar restaurant  really surprised when asked hostess if could something vegetarian she pulled vegan vegetarian menu maybe 8 10 items listed  easy everyone  pick item menu waiters don't need know lot vegan vs  vegetarian simply tell chef picked out  helpings little generous but nobody ever complains having much food left over take home  <EOR> I Nacho Daddy twice now last 3 days   came back 2nd visit because first experience good   Both visits ordered Cajun Nachos which thought phenomenal   nachos come lot meat spicy cajun sauce delicious   also really enjoyed bottomless chips sals   salsa made lot cilantro which love     The staff extremely friendly   3 year old son flirted all waitresses hostess  lol  Service pretty good overall   allowed call ahead order table 2 minutes arrived  AWESOME!!!!  The ONLY reason did give 5 star because prices little expensive   am used paying around 7 8 dollars Nachos drink ended paying $15   worth though   also atmosphere   enough TV's watch sports typically some good music playing well  <EOR> Margaritas everything delicious! Buffalo Nacho Pizza yummy! <EOR> Ok since lot say Nacho Daddy give cliff notes portion don't read much point  tell think need know am going start off  important stuff  resturant itself wasn't bad plenty seating nice clean staff great just prepare sit through classic rock whole time  Which may bad if kind stuff  just felt bad movie  food well completely mean but could've gotten better nachos tacos 7 11 if served tacos  Ok maybe weren't bad but when expected place bomb dot com wasn't knit pick  pickled jalopinos salsa tasted straight cheese tasted Velveeta   really? Gross could've gotten home  order cheese burger nachos  steak chicken street tacos sounded good but when arrived flavorless mediocre armature old soft flaky corn tortillas should left streets just straight kicked curb  Resturant more Tex then Mex good way  good size bar but probably because drunk eat food  price weren't bad amount food but food worth price pay  long story short way stoked try Nacho Daddy but first impression left absolutely no desire ever come back give them second try  never gone Resturant such high hopes left disappointed which blows mine more then location  eats stuff? Now read long version    I am rating place 1 star because personal experience  seen reviews where people fence really feel Resturant food itself now finally visited see why   The advertisement hyped Resturant point main reason why excited looking forward try Nacho Daddy  marketing amazing hear them all time see ads everywhere all looks sound good but where amazing stops    Pulling resturant's pleasantly surprise see actual Resturant fast food type joint expected  point mine still high hopes food ordering inside  Entering Resturant immediately greeted very nice host girl everyone wore Nacho Daddy tshirts kindda cool expect when everything finally sunk in  all sudden then felt transported into weird Chilis slash trashy Margaritaville wanna type Resturant blasting old school rock  Cancun? No!  Anyhow did space bad just didn't concept  being seated thought odd ask if would Chips Salsa being probably going order more chips salsa nacho meal  But did anyway just try salsa   but beware free even though sounds when ask  Fortunately checked Yelp receive free serving  So chips actually good slightly thin warm crispy just anywhere else salt never sticks salt both chips salsa  salsa left confuse because convince but couldn't completely sure    My wife decide share since everything menu sounded good  Now know Tex Mex place but shocked see actual plain nachos menu  know kind chips cheese meat bean sour cream guacamole  Even though more curious try normal nachos thought least regular nachos should offered ones adventurous  did order normal cheese burger nachos because curious I guess where phrase curiosity killed cat came into reality because good all cheese couldn't pass Velveeta tasting cheese  Eww! wife's steak chicken tacos no Bobby Flay but could've made better tacos least served them old tortillas  know old corn tortillas when try prolong shelf life heat them up? just soft flake away  Well if don't know now know  rice beans SMH place still open?   Anyways wrap wish better never less if you've wanting try all means see feel  only fair  rights own opinion opinion place over all missed mark  But try because some people whatever reason  don't! <EOR> I love place service always great never anything menu didn't like  absolutely love nachos though having many options nachos amazing! Breakfast nachos ALRIGHT <EOR> Nacho Daddy happens vegan menu which awesome  server very nice but somehow meal mixed ended something non vegan  friend Vegas eats all time she's vegan loves but wasn't impressed  Receiving wrong meal kind put off didn't really enjoy food either  may just off day but unfortunately can't give good recommendation it  <EOR> Me family seat 3 different waiter comin left right   like really? Plus don't know going wasn't pack night cuz waiting long time an hour food  taste food ok seem sitting while even though look beautiful  sport bar + restaurant w ton flat screen everywhere which cool  outdoor seating area  But overall no sorry  <EOR> Great experience food awesome    server Carmen made sure everything perfect amount time   since 09 never gone until last night   definitely missing out   Top choice  <EOR> I don't think again but gave shot  Husband ordered filet mignon nachos shared some entree well  He said he enjoyed but honestly think taste buds judgment clouded margaritas he drank before food served  ordered enchilada trio iced tea  iced tea great   and leave that  <EOR> Food come fast great environment food delicious ordered steak fajitas amazing size dish big very generous food full meat  love definitely come back  At end wanted order dessert but most them containing cinnamon which allergic hopefully next time would something delicious cinnamon beside everything perfect  Our server mike very fast welcoming took care needs perfectly  <EOR> Bottom line good sports bar decent bar food   This place should heaven because nachos desert island food but  it's       well just decent bar food   Good enough burgers edible salads frozen veggie burgers heated order lots good beer    First positives atmosphere great game night   came Super Bowl 2012 better sports spots to   Loud raucous contests prizes giveaways throughout game   People watching into game without getting obnoxious ruining event others   beer list pretty well stocked American beers   Foreign beer lovers may little disappointed but most others satisfied options      The nachos little hit miss   may tortilla chips bar chose   They're little salty    coming guy always reach salty over sweet   all choices buffalo chicken nachos favorite   buffalo sauce great blue cheese topping rich tasty   chili cheese nachos okay   chili just isn't tasty enough compensate over salty chip pile    The quality sandwich choices ranges decent mediocre   chicken sandwich decent worth order if you're mood   veggie burgers deserve pass  but all fairness rare sports bar good veggie burger   regular burgers       well good enough   So stick beer sports buffalo nachos 4 star spot   Everything else drags place down 3 stars  <EOR> This place great  try Thai Chicken Nachos flour chips flour chips important because fluffiness crunch take place rice  Tequila Tuesday's fun especially some street tacos  also give high 5 fajitas best area  <EOR> Let preface experience year ago but just begun really using yelp experience left serious impression   I working area local school co worker mentioned concept   both love Nachos psyched amazed  someone finally came idea   I ordered build your own nachos go    When arrived pick food place pretty barren  sat bar bar itself incredibly sticky kind gross     My food suppose ready 15 minutes took closer 30 which surprised me   When food arrived didn't look incredibly appetizing frankly tasted canned rosarita beans imitation cheese     I really looked forward trying place sorely disappointed  <EOR> I'm fence place still  could down 2 stars could 4 stars  currently exercising some forgiveness since just opened few kinks pretty much inevitable   When walked greeted 4 hostesses  Yep 4  assuming part some kind training  technically really only greeted 1 them  others just sorta looked on  asked if wanted sit bar dining area bar area includes high tops   replied bar area fine  hostess then back other 3 hostesses conferred bit then led high top bar area   The bar dining areas aren't really divided all  all big room no physical division  dining area all booths most part  bar area long bar stools then cluster high tops including some high tops part booth   Upon seating hostess explained only part menu available nachos  rest menu available until January 1st   And sat awhile  No even much looked me  Though counted least 12 staff hostesses bartenders servers milling around only 4 other customers entire restaurant  But ok waiting someone maybe waiting until person arrived  Nonetheless seemed strange no took drink order brought water etc   After person waiting arrived continued wait another 10 minutes  point woman assume manager came over asked if we'd helped yet  She then promised server would right over she took drink order stating drinks her   She incredibly sweet friendly  Things looking up   The bartender being all befuddled drinks could possibly manager brought drinks one  pleasantly surprised find draft beer selection rather decent  standards Bud Coors etc  slightly better Blue Moon etc  then also way better Snow Cap 2 Below Dogfish Head etc     After few more minutes server arrived  She apologized wait asked if ready order  nacho list quite extensive inventive and also build your own   all nachos available half full order  settled two half orders Buffalo Hot Sloppy Daddy  point informed didn't chips Buffalo Hot supposed come with  Ok then we'll just regular tortilla chips   Our server very nice good timing checking etc  However definitely seemed she very new new only new restaurant but new serving  She super sweet but seemed little flustered  fact think same could said majority staff here  staff mean young thin females strong preference blondes  Possibly trying little hard Hooters feel   It seemed take while food arrive especially considering nachos  But didn't take long all ok  nachos pretty good  Good enough warrant coming again  chicken Buffalo Hot just right size perfectly spicy which book very hot side   pulled pork Sloppy Daddy great flavor  best part didn't skimp cheese  Unlike other plates nachos left halfway through eating plate chips no toppings  cheese permeated every inch chips  weren't best nachos ever had  fact even close  But different yummy    The prices though did seem little high get  full orders nachos elsewhere less price half orders here   The manager came over two additional times asking ordered and making some small talk then again food arrived asking everything was   Major props   The decor nice everything very pristine  Several large flat screens bar area tuned different sports channels  Even couple flat screens corners dining section  No gaming  No smoking  Music neither loud soft primarily all Top 40   Overall decent experience decent place  fully intend patronizing again especially see kinks ironed out  ok yeah might already craving Buffalo Hot nachos little bit  <EOR> I'm just fan   not food service  way many other authentic Mexican restaurants LV <EOR> Worst nachos ever  cheese some weird Velveta sauce  Over priced too  Want real nachos decent price?

Although incredibly thankful did come same time  avoid sogginess happens when queso involved  nachos also very good  buffalo sauce overwhelming really good flavor complemented cheese well  chicken really breaded little fake chicken taste but tasted alright   Overall great atmosphere nacho pub joint  place clean service friendly food good  came end happy hour but seem some great specials  back? Maybe if other people want but much health nut become regular  <EOR> What's hype? Decided finally try Nacho Daddy year letdown   First off    I know no brainer but DEFINITELY health conscious diet people  sharing SPICY SHRIMP NACHOS felt big fat elephant  nachos good see pic attached    but ugh   make sure come HUNGRY   even STARVING perhaps  Maybe  why didn't enjoy much   Besides nachos date order some pork tacos la carte  He said amazing  He liked lot  MIGHT come back next time just try street tacos  I ordered southwestern grilled chicken salad  good  but nothing amazing   Also   service wasn't very attentive  arrived 30 minutes prior closing time maybe 2 4 tables besides waitress took awhile take order    We came tried most likely we're coming back  <EOR> Amazingly creative nachos!  Awesome margaritas flavors galore!  Homemade sauces tortillas guacamole more  Large portions great service too! <EOR> This second time visiting restaurant  Each time decent experience  Today am writing review based off lunch  sprite chips salsa kale salad chicken My husband beef enchilada raspberry tea   I bit annoyed raspberry tea fountain  husband didn't but wait staff brought refill before he even drank two sips  if scared proving great service didn't care if wasted food   Regardless salad great aside cubed chicken  wasn't worth $3 dollars extra protein   My husband wasnt fan enchiladas   appearance sitting under heat lamp while  But past great nacho dishes specifically Thai chicken nachos   I'll probably come back but slowly dissecting parts menu worth trying  <EOR> Had 10 20 dollar Living Social coupon fam decided try out  guess improvements made all around because very pleasant experience  Half reviews positive but until actually experience yourself then reflect Yelp  expectations neutral   As came hostess greeted sat down right away  minute later Victoria server came take order  soon informed noobs she politely gave little overview menu  deciding she drink orders left them  When she came back she gave small order Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins! gotta say good just fact Victoria gave some try very commendable!   I Fajita Nachos two kids basic kids items chicken fingers bean n cheese burrito wife endless chips salsa  Good thing only ordered plate nachos because give lot! All shared ate meal already still couldnt finish it! chicken fingers basically cooked Katsu! those don't know its chicken breast lightly breaded deep fried golden crisp    For dessert two choices Deep Fried Ice Cream Churro topped Ice Cream Chocolate Drizzle surrounded different colored tortilla chips  chose Deep Fried Ice Cream! Again all share because pretty good sized item   So props Victoria rest Nacho Daddy staff  wouldnt mind bringing new people place especially if craving nachos  <EOR> Nice bar lunch watch game   separate restaurant area but menu same   nachos pretty good good ceviche   also tried Chimichanga Burrito tasty but nothing cartwheels over   service pretty good waitresses waiters attentive   mexican restaurant somewhere else if  you're mood for  I'll back but high favorites list  <EOR> I roughly half dozen times consistently delicious provided well above average service every time inside very fun casual atmosphere  food tasted great each time nachos truly reason visit enchiladas large salads good but variety nachos blow rest menu water  Cheeseburger nachos favorite far  Friends told also best margaritas take word whiskey only drinker  Nacho Daddy definitely worth visit  <EOR> Sigh  hate because love excuse LOVED Nacho Daddy  hadn't chance awhile when finally able pick some food disappointed prices skyrocketed  Wrestlemania night grab some chips salsa queso to go  believe queso around $6 $9   fine guess but think mexican restaurant cheaper  Additionally when to go small container  Okay fine but least fill up  If paying much small container least could fill up! salsa bit salty side too  looked pretty much everything menu gone beware if haven't awhile  sure still back not to go just won't often before  <EOR> Nothing special all bummer  If check in free chips salsa  don't most Mexican restaurants give those free? Everything just ok  <EOR> Ordered carne asada beef burrito     it's 99% bean just know   prepared disappointment  waitress nice she said common complaint customers  manager came over explained burritos made pre portioned use really good beef less   cook told won't call chef she did  Someone should tell some people beef burritos some people bean burritos   why different kinds  don't jam beef burrito full beans put trace amount beef call beef burrito  street tacos chicken beef bland   Must seasonings kitchen  Lindo Michoacan MUCH better choice  Every dish lacked seasoning  open long   only survive long first time customers before word gets out   Saturday night 8 30   Prime time Saturday night dinner crowd but many empty tables here   sign things come Nacho Daddy   bad  <EOR> We sat patio large group people including crazy toddlers   DEAN patient just great experience beautiful spring evening Vegas Thanks again!! <EOR> I want start review saying  did any complementary chips salsa!

Overpriced Bloody Mary's but guess if stay few hours all you can drink would probably your money worth  <EOR> I am now having amazing experience server Jose  amazing food just great      I would definitely recommend Thank Angie taking care <EOR> My husband took daughters dinner last night   second visit husband first two little girls  first visit underwhelming say least   nachos way many toppings enough chips scoop them all up   remember drink because just average   returned reluctantly because husband coupon which he could find when came time pay lol!    second visit completely different experience   ordered fiesta chicken nachos frozen raspberry margarita myself girls split cheese quesadilla   nachos awesome did enjoy margarita although believe worth $10 price tag   took away star because when took daughter restroom sweltering actually broke sweat!  end June Vegas turn freaking air on!

I did receive tortillas meal until almost done asked them  We buy brunch entree free coupon server nice enough give higher priced mine free  usual coupon did require purchase two drinks  $2 95 each iced tea diet coke  <EOR> I hope placed closed service atrocious  fact don't know if could even call service <EOR> We've tried place twice now   both times server slow distracted disinterested absent food warm marginal quality  won't back  Avoid place  far better Mexican elsewhere <EOR> Nacho Daddy getting pretty good reviews lately since close why stop in?   I ordered Supreme Tostado Nacho's wife Daddy's Wings  nachos themselves huge lot toppings   but very much meat which weird  can't see why amount taco meat small plate nachos cost $13  Everything else seemed right though give good amount guacamole all ingredients seemed fresh  favorite part avocado lime salsa killer!   My wife didn't much luck food  She ordered wings asked them extra crispy but came undercooked much sauce making them really soggy  wings come dip which asked ranch blue cheese  No problem swapped pretty quick  Now problem   there's something ranch  supposed there  pulled 3 big dark chunks something think maybe kitchen dropped ranch sitting while  sure but big soggy nasty   when find things food shouldn't all over me   I going give them star but waiter noticed wife stopped eating food without saying word he offered take wings off bill  may try Nacho Daddy again but won't while  good service decent nachos didn't outweigh high prices weird crap food  <EOR> If minus stars option place would minus 5  OMG worst food ever has  Ordered some type nacho plate cup tortilla soup  soup salty nachos bad bite paid bill left  several months ago read new management hopefully they've act together  afraid back  <EOR> Food decent  nachos great but tacos just ok  Atmosphere fun but greatest meal Vegas  <EOR> Best ever! We Nacho Daddys celebrate National Nachos Day    which waiter NO IDEA talking about! So ordered delicious pitcher House Margaritas    very well made just right mix everything! Then ordered Supreme Tostada Nachos DELICIOUS Beautifully built where entire top layer covered all ingredients    it best plate Nachos ever had! <EOR> I give Nacho Daddy some credit where credit due now  There's new chef town taste difference quality ingredients food much more interesting enjoyable palate   We ordered GUACAMOLE Fresh flavorful   3 Kinds SALSA tad watery enough bite liking  Didn't care any them    Side White QUESO only thing would cheese better if naked Ryan Gosling feeding fingers while whispering sweet words ear   ENCHILADA NACHOS huge fan red enchilada sauce used but overall still grubbed big time these  Nice huge chunks white meat chicken   CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP partner crime loved it   Dessert Nachos FRIED ICE CREAM lovin' chocolate vanilla tortilla chips! Delicious ice cream too!  Not only food huge improvement last visit year ago but service spot too  waitress knowledgeable menu offered recommendations also made sure cups least half full all times  Just doll  Only small complaint when walking car VS yoga pants cactus bush strategically sticking into sidewalk scratched below belly button big ass bush! Ughhhh  Please trim ya big bush! Now definitely don't think food five stars really closer three stars but when throw awesome service cleanliness UNLV tvs THERE   Nacho Daddy does suck balls anymore  He actually gave ball sucking some nachos! Good stuff! <EOR> My family Nacho Daddy 12 20 10  While waitress nice enough she ackward niece wasn't quite ready order  asked waitress regarding beers she seemed limited knowledge beers would expect such sports bar    agree other reviewers food quite cold better nachos home cheez wiz   wouldn't back   understand kitchen isn't fully operational however wasn't made clear when ate night   think if going open restaurant don't open if ready  <EOR> The only thing giving place 2 stars book instead 1 service actually pretty good seated promptly well attended server friendly   The food god awful!  friend weren't all hungry but figured should eat something before heading strip night   try chili con queso since weaknesses   worst had   only velveeta esque really didn't any kick all   added healthy amounts couple different hot sauces table still barely edible   also chicken tortilla soup   Weirdest tortilla soup ever had   Once again very spicy broth thick barbeque sauce   most plentiful ingredient soup corn!  little chicken tasty   hunted left rest   friend couple street tacos wasn't thrilled   He actually commented should gone Roberto's which guess fast food Mexican place area    To top all off supposed sports bar TV sat next fritz color picture going regular intervals   My advice skip place find somewhere else   Maybe Roberto's? <EOR> I love food healthy options especially breakfast items  Even coffee good  could only improved upon use organic least non GMO foods  love sports channels all TVs sprinkled through restaurant    So why 3 stars? Service  comes down service  inconsistent  Sometimes good far sports restaurants but then frequently apathetic lazy server gives off impression she just wants turn table phrase goes  friendly forgetful seemingly put off presence sometimes  8 y o  knows servers she likes doesn't like  won't call server sometimes stuck but again today  My kid quipped don't her  Just ready if visit foods consistently good but service spotty  <EOR> My husband came watch Alabama Clemson game pretty nice  Alabama bar catered fans alumni  Filet Mignon nachos honestly expected little more spice flavor wasn't very good  finished coconut flan awesome! bar restaurant really big nice view Eastern  good place lunch dinner most likely  live Southwest part valley probably won't venture again but if we're neighborhood it'll good stopping place  <EOR> This place great nachos great price  brought family b day dinner worth it  few margaritas very fresh good  Come down green valley worth drive  <EOR> I'm big Alabama Crimson Tide fan heard Las Vegas Alumni chapter watch games Saturdays   nice enough place lots parking   However  where good place ends   food absolutely disgusting   tasted microwaved    service good all   sat bar first then joined alumni group   awful both places   don't know why chose place game watching but hope change upcoming season   back no plans back there   nasty  <EOR> I amazing dining experience thanks Kim!

Imagine big juicy burger  Complete bacon diced onions loads cheese  Now imagine juicy burger sans bun all chopped stacked delicious chips! DROOL    We ordered 2 4 1 margaritas good original strawberry ONLY   would definitely come back try white peach margarita    Absolutely everything passed table while waited food which came pretty quickly smelled looked phenomenal!

Keep Nacho Daddy  definitely coming back! <EOR> I actually loved wings more nachos  I expecting WOW ! nachos  But instead just dissatisfied <EOR> Not great service really good but two margaritas wimpy no kick flavor weak booze We filet nachos dish $18 U S  Think since nachos name would signature dish    Not Chips cheap think I'd some volume drizzled sauces two small scoops guacamole cheese beans but wow amount $ It Saturday night 8 30 wasn't busy tells something employees standing around I wouldn't back $40 <EOR> My boyfriend Eastern location Thursday March 12 2015 3 55pm  excited finally try Nacho Daddy! waitress Kim great very sweet  ordered Buffalo Hot Nacho appetizer bf ordered Daddy's Bowl Marinated Filet Mignon ordered BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich     The nachos took 20 minutes arrive immediately followed entrees  waitress apologized kitchen being backed somewhat order  weren't thrilled all food arrived same time but no big deal us    The buffalo nachos really runny buffalo sauce sandwich ok  boyfriend said bowl ok nothing really worth coming back for    We left disappointed quality food but service fact great! Unfortunately both became violently ill later day due food poisoning nachos  only thing shared only thing eaten all day knew  was  both sick over 24hrs due food being prepared incorrectly    This first last time ever going there  <EOR> I really wanted place because need fun nice Mexican restaurant good food Silverado Ranch area   place isn't going it   My friend ordered Fajita salad edible but pretty simple entree really disappointing wasn't better   Originally ordered nacho brisket ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING   just horrible taste   couldn't take bite being grossed out   cheese didn't taste good either   don't know screw cheese   sent dish back ordered 3 tacos   ordered each taco different way hopefully would good   Nope    also disgusting  Don't it!  The service ok   bad but great   restaurant itself nice   idea being able sit patio but returning  <EOR> I think place bad rap early reviews when first opened say ignore early reviews ones mid 2011 mine   We just back must say place healthy eating no way  junk fooded ourselves did traditional nachos chicken wings Sonoran Hot Dog! Massive calorie overload! but eats every day? basket fries also dropped off order but guess pairs chicken wings  When comes food common sewer ha ha! ***YAY nice thick steak fries loved aspect shoestring fries sux!***  The decor casual fun TVs everywere bar looking most part  surprised huge inside building looks smaller outside but indoors plenty seating  guy making fresh tortillas back room see machine chips pretty cool  machine made company called Lenin   Hmmm? strange Russian heritage somewheres   Oh yeah thought funny  see $2 Coronas cans order one  few minutes later waitress litterally drops off table  Here's your Corona she skampers away  Whaaaaaaaat? No glass no lime opened just drop go! Amazing! did some limes glass when she passed again  Funny!  Overall good place nachos bad previous EARLY reviews place sound  traditional nachos didn't canned cheese although did ask side guacamole sour cream noticed missing but then again might melted all together why looked wasn't there  Just ask some bussers very helpful   Good place junk yourself we'll back when cholesterol levels back down semi normal  Ha ha!  Seriously most part  <EOR> I love place  decent food drinks very affordable prices  great place come friends some drinks  myself usually IPA always few good ones  am told margaritas pretty good too    I always enchiladas which really enjoy but watch those crazy spicy tomato things! never any nachos ironically but food always great  staff always friendly point honestly cannot ever remember having bad experience Nacho Daddy  Really great spot  <EOR> Been few times now food never disappoints  fish chicken carne asada taco great choice shrimp nachos  But if your looking something really special Filet mignon nachos real treat  Also tequila Tuesday great gives chance try all kinds different tequilas  Service good but always consistent  Most servers great but anywhere always few throw others off  Over all really place look forward next visit! <EOR> Typical sports bar atmosphere Mexican food twist but don't fooled still Americanized   They huge menu many different types foods any your picky friends  You're bound find something your friends enjoy! awesome part friends Vegetarian Vegan menu! Which choosing foods easy since won't necessarily read all ingrediants list if order anything off menu    We came Tuesday which Tequila Taco Tuesdays! 2 1 shots any Tequilla 3 tacos $6 $7 depending type meat get  bad deal! group 10 people decided order food group share  Basically Nacho party platter larger anyone expected     safe say didn't finish lol  didn't try any but everyone own favorite since contained four different nachos have  ordered around 4 5 plates tacos then vegan nachos    I did try vegan nachos delicous! all favorites daiya cheese beans corn mild salsa guacamole fake meat =P  all recall  enough share between two people!   Oh also Chips Salsa but requested hot salsa disappointed when hot salsa tasted mild salsa me  Even asked extra habeneros but apparently don't offer that  waitress kind enough bring some other hot sauce which good but spicy bust    Add couple rounds drinks all set! think stayed past closing time but weren't kicked never said anything which awesome! didn't even realize otherwise would door 10 minutes before closing  Props them letting hang longer without distrubing fun! <EOR> wanted try something new stopped nacho daddys  hoping full mexican style restraunt  first thing server told known thier nachos of course   even ordered house recomondation bland sparsley loaded bbq chicken nachos  husband burger!! impressed n going back <EOR> Nacho daddy fantastic  2 years ago but waitress told drastically changed better since last visiting  am glad gave another shot!

Upon sitting down bartender brought each menu told she would back few order she also informed right when happy hour started! love when bartenders give few minutes order because always feel rushed when immediately sit down want order   We house margaritas because 5 dollars deal couldn't beat!  The bartender made them quickly delicious  Came cute little glass plenty tequila just it! The bartender great would come back again just drinks her! <EOR> First time here   food blackberry acai  margarita awesome server Kim  called The Goodness delicious!  Very happy drink recomendation  Great atmosphere fast service Kim super nice   We'll back sure! <EOR> Slow service waitress looked train wreck piercings tattoos head toe   Ok overlook insane look but then greet table hi blank stare then odd silence until ordered drink told waiting someone   service horrible slow restaurant she never around   other staff tables near looked great personable but woman train wreck needs job gas station local tattoo shop   food okay horrible but sort bland mexican but am interested trying some other nachos offered menu   back again everything deserves second chance but if next time anything visit bet another restaurant failure within year  <EOR> The first time around 10pm busy  few other parties restaurant generally quiet  waiter energy friendly attentive  took two orders nachos Buffalo Hot standard kind just safe  took far long order come somewhere around 45 50 minutes  Considering un busy most restaurants area close kitchens 10pm Nacho Daddy exception closing kitchen 11pm pleased  However when food arrived hungry delicious enough worth wait  standard nachos little boring naturally Buffalo Hot unlike anything we'd before just awesome! All all decided would return   This evening decided reward ourselves long day another plate those Buffalo Hot Nachos some regular 6 pc  Buffalo Wings Nacho Daddy  walk there's no apparent hostess but everyone seems chatting bar sitting around  moment two notice awkwardly waiting noticed someone comes over seat offering anywhere you'd fine! smile  Dining area empty except couple  sit waitress comes perky nervous well  She takes drinks complete order returns timely enough throughout evening check she did great part  great refilling drinks clearing plates finished appetizer basket  Order nachos came really late again time cold even although waitress told watch because plate hot? hahaha which may may true didn't care enough check  nachos all soft where cheesed cheese starting solid again   ended finishing them because things aren't really appetizing when they're melted then solidify again  lot more disappointed evening but really bent over all worth mentioning  only heartbreaking part Not So Hot Nachos  Which really Buffalo Hot but don't think worth going back again even if craving them   Hopefully things figured isn't Chef Ramsay intervention wills customers back year now  They're bad but slow business wise both times somehow food coming slow  mean even if really good when they're hot they're still nachos does take long put them together? Also feel chips bought made house  If wrong them being made house then sorry didn't look all nice thick bubbly or taste regular fresh made chips familiar with  Maybe they're frozen then dunked fry idk  even really expecting them but just suggesting would really cool fresh made order homestyle tortilla chips especially when place called Nacho Daddy  feel would totally worth 10 15 bucks 40 minute wait  Assuming they're warm time  <EOR>
