Two meat plate portion small brisket sliced thin maybe afraid running out  baked beans quite same little undercooked  Change your vendor tortillas very fresh    Now service constantly remind cashier no forks food getting cold  No forks no white sauce no lemon tea no soft serve ice cream   Hopefully just bad day give them another visit  <EOR> Maaaan bad review because tried place order didn't anything !!!!!  No ribs No chicken  No brisket  Why even open????? <EOR> Looking something different Famous  Dave's did research found Billy's   around 4 PM Saturday afternoon pick menu never did any contact employee but did talk two different patrons  Both said give try called 5 30 place order  voice mail decided just order when 6 PM informed pretty much everything   DUH Saturday night 6 PM   General manager did seem concerned   Ended ordering pulled pork sandwich side beans both only OK ribs anticipated ordering   Sorry but don't waste your time place broke business shortly because owner doesn't care doesn't know better  <EOR> The Service fantastic!! food amazing most definitely telling friends family come eat here!  I tried sampler which includes 1 4 lb  each pulled chicken sliced brisket pulled pork 4 baby back ribs 1 sausage 2 small sides    I lean brisket which tender juicy full slow smoked flavor  Pulled Pork second favorite meat again tender juicy nice flavor  sausage which different now used much better opinion more smoked sausage polish  RIBS favorite would say Best Town far  Fall off bone tender smothered yummy goodness made scratch BBQ sauce  chicken also very delicious but didn't very much room left all face stuffing ribs   I tried Bacon Mac n Cheese very surprised creamy but yet perfect golden brown cheese bake top sprinkled bacon because know bacon everything better   Baked Beans truly must here  Bursting smoky BBQ flavor but still sweet heaven your mouth   Save best part last   the die Peach Cobbler  OMG could seriously eat every time best part Complimentary!!

BBQ Fan Leslie H <EOR> Even though believe meal 5 stars giving 3 stars why lunch brought in  ordered brisket pulled pork mac cheese corn bread  large aluminium pans    Even though ordered ahead time received order back office warm room temp cold    And absolutely fantastic!!  Even cold brisket pulled pork tender full flavor did need any sauce enhance its goodness  brisket pulled away easily without effort pull pork fell apart  should  just steak if add sauce wasn't good begin with    The mac cheese even cold huge pile creamy goodness plate  pasta perfect   Instant mac not    Everything fresh  cold did disappoint  fridge cold leftovers night   30 seconds mike perfection!! I wasn't keen corn bread  While good sweet flavor dry  But won't blame Billy's they bring outside source town  forget name    Born raised Texas having eaten some best BBQ joints all Dallas Ft Worth searching BBQ place taste buds proud since leaving 1996  taken 20 years find worth search  only wish found sooner    Hopefully visit Billy's BBQ dine update 3 stars 5  It true run meats  Meat next days service night before  Once they're they're out  suggest going lunch you're bound want instead slim pickings dinner  <EOR> Excellent BBQ!

Best smoked chicken ever had   Brisket since Texas  real deal barbecue   Disappointed ribs pork but if brisket chicken any indication would great also   enjoyed cornbread yes more cake like  Homemade mac cheese ok  Cole slaw  If west side town GO! <EOR> I picked some food buddy mine myself two meat plate baked beans collard greens pulled pork brisket  Also some peach cobbler  1st start negatives root beer macaroni cheese pulled pork looked pretty dry  someone food industry nearly 30 years know can't please everyone because raised think eat differently taste buds mutate every seven years  But common sense weighs selection root beers must flying off shelves mad crowd came cleaned macaroni  Now could albertsons pick some ingredients whip batch 20 minutes but integrity dish compromised  good call chef  gladly wait serving next time  But baked beans collard greens phenomenal  made meal those some crinkle cut fries  way skinny fries DOES better bbq dishes but crinkle cuts favorite also  Keep doing your doing  pulled pork    well put some bbq sauce graciously set side tossed wedged between dinner roll provided tender juicy tasty  taste buds changed least 5 times now now love place  Famous daves something worry about  couple other tender juicy items would've spoon off plate but save when come try Mac n cheese  Bravo! <EOR> TL DR version nothing seasoned meat sides but all meats cooked very well somebody knows control heat  wouldn't call BBQ because nothing any flavor BBQ isn't just meat heated cook but rubbed marinated mopped basted smoked   FLAVORED  only flavor tonight salt food major sugar sauces  bright spot night pickle fries which despite rest food absolutely delicious  Overall place definitely no go  Details follow    My food no seasoning other salt if anything  brisket taco incredibly salty corn tortillas tasted super cheap but meat great texture bark cooked well  couldn't taste any flavor all taco's coleslaw over meat's salt basically totally flavorless  Great size though its price I'd order heartbeat if tasted good  french fries tasted cheap frozen fries cooked old oil  pulled chicken cooked very well also but seasoned only salt far could tell  seemed made eaten sauces but all sauces disgusting more minute    The wife's pulled pork great texture pulled chicken but again basically unseasoned just salt cooked alright  However did bite all bark which pretty thin tasted pure salt spit out  brisket good texture end cut seasoned but she worked down piece meat seasoning faded nothing halfway through second half unseasoned  side coleslaw also no flavor all   Pickle fries absolutely excellent  Simple that  Pickles snap tasted fresh  Breading great thickness cooked perfectly  asked some ranch them ranch gave definitely store bought ranch put into those little plastic cups but didn't charge them least good store brand  No complaints two items  Easily worth $2 50   So those sauces original barbecue sauce tasted ingredients corn syrup water vinegar in order hot barbecue sauce tasted just original even remotely spicy I couldn't tell difference betwixt two sauces truly   even wife thought spicy she's exceptionally sensitive  White sauce super watery even though called mayo based sauce short flavor too  All three sauces super watery two barbecue sauces super super sweet  surprised people raving sauces some reviews  They're basically sugar water if you're into eating lots sugar then you'll probably them  But only flavor they're going add food sweet there's nothing nuanced subtle flavorful it  no depth  just sugar water   I felt personally insulted menu  $14 99 2x 1 4 pound meats 2x small sides large side  Small sides alone $2 50 large $3 50 1 2 pound meat $7 99  $7 99 + $5 = 1 2 pound meat two small sides $13  2 extra dollars privilege getting half and half meats? could just buy half pound meat sides own save $3  thought combo plates supposed better deal buying things individually  Apparently not  insulting basically saying think customers stupid basic math  Given all positive reviews try place again hope just off night seasonings  But seriously really really off night  pretty sure menu prices sauce ingredients chosen purpose no off night part  Despite un flavor meat all cooked pretty well  wasn't inedible  complaint just super bland super salty sauces or more accurately sugar waters inedible  <EOR> Disrespectful BBQ everywhere!  Im only giving 1 star because cannot give fewer   This place such huge disappointment myself boyfriend   The ribs leave much desired   putting mildly  Even though weren't dry all lacked flavor and smothered bbq sauce   Ribs supposed seasoned BBQ sauce should optional only way choke them down  no smokiness all doubt spent any time actual grill smoker could even used liquid smoke!!!! The bbq sauce tasted just poured straight bottle   The sausage     sausage tasted store bought kielbasa sausage  Actually  disrespectful store bought kielbasa because even more flavor  sure I'd even feed dog  looked microwaved sliced into container   The baked beans absolutely no depth flavor  chunks whatever meat product use I think supposed brisket cut inside mouth because hard    The Mac cheese just all around dry  bacon tasted old aftertaste   We read though reviews place believe any review Billy's barbecue rated four stars better fraudulent just boost score Yelp increase sales  place empty 5pm  If feel good barbecue gave four star five star review you're probably used taste Elmers glue  You're better off spending your money TGI FRIDAYS  Will back  <EOR> Nice little sit down place great BBQ aromas  when walk  many choices  choose from  Slow roasted pork brisket chicken  amazing  Great selection  root beers ginger ales birch  beer  Only thing wish  would stouts porters food  Deff good spot  locals! <EOR> Strange business  Sells meat lb  but ribs rack buy meal  Sides sized small tiny  Can't pint quart size party buy lots small tiny  Sauce 2oz mini selfserve self fill  containers asked couple tiny sides containers sauce told against rules  Thank goodness sympathetic  cashier relented   Sides non descript ribs brisket dry no moisture all  Even sauce both disappointing   It expensive didn't offer platter parties families  expensive BBQ   Seems only decent place Vegas BBQ Roadkill Grill  <EOR> A BBQ place  pork ribs   Wow   says 2 meat plate comes cornbread but only sides because losing vender give small loaf bread    Smh  Should just gone Rollin smoke <EOR> Delicious     Overall great experience  BBQ pulled pork topped Mac n cheese bowl world! <EOR> Amazing!

Finding good barbecue Las Vegas shouldn't task but be   Some places gone essentially really sketchy parts city whereas others way North Las Vegas areas undeveloped land odd hours operation   Thankfully most heavenly barbecue restaurants came randomly putting Google search nearby BBQ places Summerlin area   say definitely deserves spot Top 5 even Number 1 if possible! Many reviews said Billy's BBQ primarily 'eat til gone' type place once available meats all gone they're gone   But often expected especially when comes BBQ   accepted fact figured should still give shot knows?  Given fact photos other reviewers uploaded making mouth water knew sign try it!  My fiancee Friday night find tucked away nice area major shopping plaza Flamingo 215  Walking place reminded Capriotti's Downtown Summerlin   Somewhat small terms width but very tall height   Seating appeared hold roughly 18 25 people   The photo enticed most signature dish Billy's BBQ shrimp   always loved fish but shrimp something never into until 9 10   didn't idea fish crunchy   Shrimp always felt weird when bit into heard audible 'crunch' sound   But into more older now favorite fish eat   I'd tried shrimp wide varieties over years grilled pan fried stir fried popcorn coconut shrimp toast shrimp po boy   listen me! starting sound Bubba Forrest Gump!

Pulled pork just brisket ribs smokey packed flavor  imagine awesome would taste sandwich coleslaw  Each meat moist flavorful enough didn't really need selction sauces each table although smokey sauce fantastic! Now onto sides Pickle fries really good! Fried perfectly wonderful concept making dill pickles into fries although prefer cornmeal batter fried pickles ie BWW fried pickles but really good! Mac n cheese delicious! Perfectly cooked spiral tube noodles super creamy cheese sauce  Baked beans wonderful sweet smoked flavor large chunks brisket mixed in  Very well seasoned brown sugar sweetness nice balance all smokey meats plate Cornbread just right amount sweetness very moist   Only cons think soft serve ice cream all meat some soft serve vanilla sounded amazing  basically tease lol  also ran sausage night time but fan hot links i did try them durring lunch good but something would order no matter where eat also dont potato salad yet   If didn't cut weights fights would place couple times week especially since live down street  All all besides fancy appetizers desserts place beats Lucille's Rollin Smoke taste quality convenience   wasn't  packed maybe because still pretty new great combo selection 2 3 sampler meat plates few nice ala cart selections bbq mac n cheese bowl gutbuster loaded waffle fries sandwiches bbq soft tacos etc service really friendly too  see why owner won those trophies display above drink fountains    I officially stamp place RIDICULOUS APPROVED   IG twitter @ridiculousj702 <EOR> Delicious addition west side!
