No sense urgency no refills everyone blinders on  place doesn't work team but VS other server attitude shows    I may your guest time but doesn't mean won't next time  However won't next time  Need new manager ASAP  Great location horrible management  bet if let see PnL it'd confirm right    I'll just breakfast home out  <EOR> This location worst  dont listen when order being taken because when your food its always wrong  When management  told nothing fix problem  <EOR> This location bad example Denny's!

Yes true  Sure enough when waiter finally decided job food cold! Funny thing couple leaving arrived complaining getting served cold food  service just awful location  <EOR> A couple things need know your experience positive possible  many times should ask sat Lourdes' section  She always seems top things when comes service  Any other waitress slow incompetent period!Also don't believe all cooks experienced location no reservation sending something back if way want it  Other then above good place eat  <EOR> I visited location several times since live couple miles road  never remarkable but OK leisurely breakfast  last experience final straw however    I called order pickup  girl answered phone rude  told wanted place order pickup she said hold please   She sat phone down but did actually place hold  could hear all conversations she having other employees guests I think she cashier   waited over 5 minutes  finally started yelling hello hello hello into phone hoping she would remember line    I ended hanging up  tried call back couple minutes later but kept getting busy signal  Finally answer  same girl  told wanted place order pickup  She passed along someone else  explained both them called previously put hold could hear conversations happening never acknowledged again felt service lacking morning  guy apologized did end ordering but told husband happened he told pick food  didn't    I never ever back Denny's  obviously mismanaged  Customers priority  <EOR> After eating Denny's least 15yrs decided give try rather usual which IHOP   This morning stomach regretting it   Went around 10pm last night place wasn't very busy  Hostess asked wait minute which actually 15min  Place seemed really dirty kept getting whiffs dirty carpet smell  Food good but great  Hash browns eggs where actually really good   Three stars because did decent value menu biscuits gravy meal $4  <EOR> The worst Denny's ever   sat table greeted 10 minutes left   No cared   watched no servers tending any tables   think managerial issue   seat people quickly servers handle thats just restaurant 101   Sad thing always given Denny's second chances    keep coming even though know poor service   mention nasty sticky menu's forced touch look menu  Today final straw no more Simmons Denny's any more  <EOR> Worst all Denny franchises  boyfriend came breakfast place only 3  tables occupied but host decided sit next kitchen  10 past no greeted noticed other new arriving guest being seated other side sight kitchen  few moments decided leave IHOP  waitress came around host smile said Oh help door ?   WTF?! If could give rate zero would  location perfect management sucks  Someone needs take over place current owner  <EOR> This visit disappointing disgusting  waited 20mins salad  Then top off nasty fork food still stuck it  screwed salad order still charged everything  asked hostess if could new fork because dirty she replied looks gross  Yes gross attitude managers attitude wasn't any better  if stop dumpster sure double check your utensils cups  <EOR> This Dennys usually breakfast when whole family wakes wrong side bed   Our servers name Lourdes day besides professionalism she definitely cutest employee there  So route avoided sweets time ordered Sante Fe Skillet here's kicker   added Corned Beef Hash into $1 extra! Probably best thing ate Dennys mention huge meal   If see pic skillet eggs top yeah that'd me Overall viewing all other reviews service good  wouldn't complain being any better because meant fancy restaurant  <EOR> Look @ food tells most story  wife 2 kids called work said dad want Denny's breakfast  said if corse guys fun once wife arrived she wasn't seated spoken timely manner  when she finally table waitress order wrong didn't put other 2 kids orders  They've Denny's over 1 hr no food  recommend guys never ever again!!!! worst Denny's  similar experience when few weeks ago myself      trust management employees problem here    <EOR> We came 5 minute wait  place empty     waitress really nice food quickly  else say? Denny's  food clearly microwaved but wasn't terrible  coffee burnt didn't finish it  Bottom line would come back? Maybe isn't worst Denny's but better breakfast places LV  <EOR> The food fine  service spotty  nice enough when actually around us  daughter never all food  only three people working during height weekend dinner rush  guess overall exactly would expect Denny's which ultimately reviewing place completely asinine pointless  But definitely did enjoy experience  <EOR> Just walked myself  Only 1 table full whole restaurant still couldn't take order  Lady sat down didn't smile once counting money when walked in  Waited 20 minutes waters walked out  lady still counting money when left  <EOR> Surprisingly best Denny's ever to  food awesome yummy server attentive nice place clean  Nice quiet  must admit good experience  All Denny's should way  <EOR> So again try give place try again know server says chicken sausage patties instead turkey sauasage patties  say okay   She comes back says oh discontinued gouda apple chicken sausage   face priceless yet still nice professional  waitress says no 1 knee dicontinued until now??? Interesting   what's wiifm? She says speak manager  guy good english comes menu can't read incompetent starts pointing! politely advise am very competent read advised your employees need trained properly if things discontinued still being offered  it manager horrible understanding common language America  NEGATIVE 100 RATING!!! <EOR> My parents coupon treated kids breakfast  server friendly but many tables wait she trouble attending us  hostess unfriendly  food standard diner fare but took nearly 45 minutes even though restaurant half full  hobbit hole breakfast bit disappointing hearty sausage pay extra void flavor  line cashier pay also annoyingly lengthy  place wouldn't bad if added more staff  <EOR> Had update review Denny's seated acknowledged nobody    People made eye contact nobody said word other busier took name down well long story short 10 min later just left  looked around people's faces didn't look happy just gave more reason leave unfortunate shitty service cause close house but no longer going several encounters bad service  <EOR> The food good but service bad  Nobody around when need them won't mind further drive better service next time <EOR> We didn't eat!!  Didn't even seated!!  Waited behind 2 other couples hostess station longer anyone should to  couple left few mutes later did we  No ever came!!  even tell __ minutes   People already waiting tables  People waiting pay bill  still nobody came!!!!  Lots empty tables still people wait    I thought only Denny's Craig Tenaya bad service but beginning think now bad service standard all Denny's!!  wouldn't even given 1 star but give something write review  arrived Saturday around 12 30 wasn't dealing morning rush  Bad management leads bad employees leads unhappy customers  Come Denny's together before become obsolete!! <EOR>
