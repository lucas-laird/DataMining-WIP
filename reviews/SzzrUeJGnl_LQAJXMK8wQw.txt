Seated quickly food came fast service great!  I tried udon instead ramen which last time prefer udon  broth better noodles aren't thick udon noodles sushi other Japanese restaurants  add extras wakame fishcake or tempura among other things    I'm also fan umeboshi nigiri which if you're Hawaii basically musubi ume it  don't see lot menus although very simple item love it! Probably because reminds home   I'm glad gave place another chance  worth it! <EOR> Pretty decent place ramen close house convenient  Very cute place nice clean  twice now changed menu added more appetizers  Service best only 2 tables but still waited refill server did check us    They variety ramen fried rice appetizers  spicy miso ramen pretty good  Although picture menu look 1 whole egg but only half    love egg sad when only half  Also takoyaki only comes 4 other places usually come 6 believe  Tried chasu buns which weird expected slices chasu but ground meat   nothing crazy flavorful  Also tried kimchi pork belly bun which ok  <EOR> Simple place familiar menu options! Most time you'll find main ramen places packed long wait list but if want avoid crowds come here  your average Japanese ramen spot several other menu options including katsu bento type entrees  food over decent no complaints  simple but don't expect best tasting broth quality  bad tasting but greatest  pricing around same other places near you'll look spend around $8 $13 per entree  only tried katsu ramen here  actually thought katsu pretty good! staff friendly provided good service based experience  Give try if you're looking somewhere new eat <EOR> The family decided try some Japanese noodles nearby picked place  The place very clean decorative Japanese decors   I picked tonkatsu miso ramen mediocre due salty broth  Overall place great customer service but saltiness food keep away some time  <EOR> Great those ramen cravings when just don't want drive distance spring mountain   broth tasty chashu delicious  only complaint ramen bowls don't come egg  You'll pay extra $1 50 egg  otherhand bowls reasonably priced   There also great selection appetizers dons rice bowls if you're feeling ramen  <EOR> Ordered kitsune soba noodles side potato croquette croquette just right hard tasted just imagined  soup broth delicious tofu good light service excellent  other 2 friends also agreed meal delicious  way did mention decor wonderful! also play only Japanese songs which perfectly fine me   I recommend giving place shot if you're area mood some noodles  <EOR> I only 5x always lunch special  review based on  love it! tons food price includes drink  love decor service friendly seem great menu  look forward trying more dinner menu  UPDATE Omoide quickly become weekly lunch date spot husband  just love here! favorite dishes poke bowls tonkotsu shoyu ramen chashu don  udon also great! <EOR> The Goods 1  liked ramen pork katsu usually catch all Asian places everything adequately but thought food pretty good! 2  I'd back try soba udon 3  Also offers sushi 4  I'd say good groups something everyone if cannot decide between noodles curry sushi   Service 1  Good did refill iced tea which yum  2  Good parking  3  CC ok cash   Ambiance 1  Clean somewhat romantic dim lighting   MoJo 1  strength variety but believe better expected   Cannot wait try some sushi <EOR> Located awkward area shopping center  Pay attention where park might park back thinking  front    I off work super late wanted food  Saw happy hour Buy free beer sake  why not? long day work   Ordered grilled squid chicken karaage don  Ok squid alright grilled no seasoning it  chicken karaage little off  Especially breading  guess  take it    But other service good would come back another HH drink  <EOR> Super happy ramen house next house!!!!!

I guess tucked away kept little secret but long  good try  <EOR> Only second place found served Katsu don   came hot but no shiro sauce bottom rice time under pork cutlet very dry hot but very dry   Very difficult grinding rest order give only two stars   Service very good though   Best Katsudon ever 1968 Vietnam during jungle down time   Ate fabulous house owned Thai's restaurant inside catered every body   Can't food next Hwuang's monkey brain tiger soup snake teriyake etc  <EOR> I'm sure why place such crazy hype food all authentic service mediocre best    Ordered Spicy tonkatsu water hot sauce Kimchi bun bland  Chashu bun very dry  Gyoza  We barely touched food  <EOR> Great place quick ramen fix  Good atmosphere delightful  There's waitress always remembers great service  <EOR> Chilly night decided some ramen here  Ordered just shoyu ramen potato croquette which good  vegas locals old Rice Trax location  Atmosphere okay service okay but change music  some sort rave music going quite matched atmosphere  would probably dine again  <EOR> Absolutely great  first time food amazing staff incredible  definitely going back  <EOR> I really liked place   ramen good close place   Haven't bad ramen place though  <EOR> It only took trip place convince won't back  giving 3 stars mainly because place really cozy clean  sure maybe some other menu items could better ordered    So broth bland flavor meat really tough undercooked  The server knew nothing menu could only say she liked popular  I'd ask questions meat prepared u spicy dishes could recommend basic menu questions she should've known answer to  mean first time familiar menu  I'd say I'd give another chance but I'd rather try other places since there's MANY restaurants choose from  Cute place though! <EOR> I glad hear new ramen udon soba rice bowl place opened Southwest part Vegas  ordered chicken karaage shrimp udon  friend's gyoza sampled Spicy Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen    Chicken Karaage decent but would liked more seasoning  hate say but really disappointed udon  broth light thin weird indescribable taste it  couldn't figure missing  didn't care udon consistency either  prefer noodles chewy soft thick  Sadly better $1 udon market  husband said ramen just OK   The service good food came reasonable manner  didn't finish udon thought driving fast food joint but decided eat dessert home instead  sure if would return try other items  read reviews see things pan out  <EOR> The best katsu southwest Las Vegas between 10 11pm!!!  We stopped Omioide waitress's recommendations Tonkatsu Ramen Katsu Don Konbu Onigiri Pumkin Croquette  Aside raw egg white Katsu Don everything palatable   then again most places aren't going merely palatable food options  didn't hate any items tried   but would certainly rather venture elsewhere  ramen lacked flavor literally thought first bite Well edible  favorite item Pumkin Croquette but even here isn't something could ever envision myself specifically wanting stop Omioide get  All around strong two star very weak three stars  problem exception ramen most menu found nearby similar price point much better versions     and ramen I'd rather trip Flamingo Spring Mountain come back  sounds little harsh but food certainly wasn't A OK   it precisely Meh  experienced better  hard recommend item served unintended raw egg but if find your way think would Katsu Don aforementioned Pumkin Croquette  Omioide took over old Rice Trax building fans quality originality food may enjoy themselves here    The interior more adequate price range actually really padded double chair loveseat chairs  comfortable certainly something don't typically find  While didn't particularly relish anything Omioide seems kind place okay part town teenagers twenty something's individuals don't seek great food  <EOR> I give 4 stars   Service great cute spacious decor   Some dishes need more improvement overall would back again  <EOR> I few days ago tried spicy ramen since  usually always when ramen  taking first sip noticed miso watered down many other places gone feel way more creamier even added butter corn usually when just becomes creamer other ramen spots  Also noodles weren't favorite  felt place wasn't authentic other ones to  all all wasn't bad but being other places feel better opinion made compare  But plus side service great everyone real nice explained everything well  <EOR> Another favorable experience   asked extra Chasu pork eggs bowl    they did disappoint   Started things off gyoza   very nice    Service very good   décor very serene  <EOR> I'm glad gave spot second chance  time ordered cold udon noodles amazing  think waitress lot why left 3 star review last time  time around waiter very attentive more knowledgeable menu waitress first visit here  back! <EOR> Kids choice night  wanted Ramen  suggested place because according yelp serve Ramen  experience think created little foodie monster children lol  blunt hey kids keeps real!  I no influence opinions yet always encourage kindness  But unfiltered 6 year old son 3 year old daughter most funniest facial reactions ramen   Mommy noodles hard   Eww kind soup this? Miso shoyu base Mommy tricked said they'd Ramen   never come back again? keep shushing them because other customers looking way  husband tried Ramen agreed  11 year old son however enjoyed grilled chicken wings  other two little kiddos asked if potstickers because couldn't eat anymore soup  encouraging them eat more did order some potstickers hungry little monsters gobbled two orders   I enjoyed salmon sashimi plain rice onigiri  fact hubby pick some to go another night since kids adamant wanting eat ever again lol   3 stars good service grilled wings potstickers salmon sashimi  great choice Ramen  <EOR> Bun soft should be  Chicken curry great ramen delish  Prices AWESOME!!! Cool vibe inside too  Great service  <EOR> I've restaurant 3 times now  First when just opened  liked decor menu selection  ordered 2 different ramen zaru soba  All noodles tasted fully cooked broth wasn't impressive  Service pretty good but overall disappointed  Because place close house wanted place gave another try  Second time packed but only server  Service friendly but slow  least noodles tasted better  Then finally third time restaurant now seemed all place settled  Service prompt very friendly attentive noodles perfect texture  ordered tonkotsu spicy tonkotsu miso ten zaru gyoza pumpkin croquette i tried potato croquette before but pumpkin croquette more flavorful all tasted very good  satisfied food service  glad improved since first opened now met expectations! definitely going back! <EOR> Not richest best tasting ramen but did quite enjoy it! ordered lunch special pork ramen pork chashu bowl  ordered them plain quite happy it  noodles nice chew soup think milky consistency  pork bowl savery  sweet flavor quite bit pork  also ordered chicken which very flavorful tasty    I suggest trying place  <EOR> Cute exterior menu board interior decor really wanted place! trying people expect Tokyo but just FYI actually   which would totally ok if authenticity flavors there    menu good options but afraid lunch didn't live expectations  karaage wasn't seasoned enough needs more salt maybe crispier batter higher cooking temp fryer crispy outside juicy inside if we're trying avoid over salting should condiments side salt pepper table but wasn't   or least offered side curry powder mayo soy sauce side instead   maybe chili pepper could've option?   onigiri fell short also rice overcooked wet ume filling ok but price wouldn't typically point fault except rest meal wasn't tasty either  Then miso ramen wasn't hot maybe bowls should warmed prior serving? Because room temp when table ramen noodle different slightly overcooked  miso base itself rather bland more orange color typically maybe different miso base?  Overall everything ok best way explain all flavors mild  Other notes bothered multiple tables brought outside drinks no said anything as 1 table Starbucks another raising canes but maybe just casual?    and when apps came no utensils napkins plates? wait each entrees come them bring each setting since mine came first chopsticks but companion wait ramen eat app!   Finally no stopped touch table server manager see doing until waiting check server saw ramen touched much just didn't care any more instant ramen home  If you're area want quick bite fast food may definitely place you! But think you're might better off going Chinatown better meal same price if stronger flavors temperature appropriate meals  <EOR> Waited 30 minutes them give BS excuse order being lost having reorder  If waiting eating come here  Worst Ramen place ever! <EOR> I love ramen place before but when recently upgraded menu renovated place everything change  Prices portions quantity decreased  Quality hmmmm same but quite before  graded 1 keep coming just give them them benefit doubt but today totally it  Service wasnt great  If only made everything better but changes just made everything worse  would last time found new place  durango warm spring place ramen plae starts O! <EOR> The good perfectly cooked egg tasty pork broth chasu   The bad imperfect rice texture flavor  No liquor license but won't allow byob w   Below average tempura   Japanese typos menu Japanese friends laughing cringing same time obviously designed native speaker Japanese    So much promise but missing conviction follow through  <EOR> Came late Sunday lunch husband  staff really friendly fast  husband udon noodles buta shio bukkake ordered tempura bowl ten don   tempura great shrimp wasn't thin most places  pork belly buta shio bukkake super tender perfect  Overall food service great! first time husbands second  Highly recommend trying rice balls onigiri   We'll going Omoide again since kids husband love noodles  <EOR> This place slowly becoming favorite ramen place  great vegetable miso which great when want avoid meat  far away china town  nice when don't live close side town  Good atmosphere good service  very reliable spot  Check out! <EOR> Omoide really great place decorations cute! staff super sweet food equally just great  I'd say thier Ramen favorites always come place little 3 00  There's no wait all which pretty important consider especially when place serves some popular food  <EOR> Not bad little Japanese restaurant   all comfort food crave  Good udon soup delicious katsu don all mind ramen   5 year old daughter finished entire bowl udon soup herself  <EOR> We udon 5 year old cleared bowl  Everything authentic served just asked it  curry udon good well   udon noodles thawed served but still tasty hit spot  katsu curry just good find Japan  spice perfect but maybe bit much 3yo  definitely back try ramen  <EOR> So friend mine put ramen noodles recently hooked ever since  some amazing ramen noodle places around town Omoide right best  place extra special total package  Great location love decor amazing service finally delicious noodles  <EOR> Place delicious  salad all toppings  Price reasonable  Pretty quick ordering bringing food   <EOR> This place cute!

It's cute little restaurant but seating size grander most ramen places to  soup ordered delicious Tonkatsu! soup base creamy sufficient noodles sides but extra meat wouldn't hurt  However overall entire dish good portion size filling   The only negative would hot tea $1 50 w free refills where other places give complimentary   However despite I'd still come back try other ramen flavors curry bowls  <EOR> Went yesterday looking quick lunch   bowl chaschu miso ramen   Wow great miso broth tender noodles very succulent pieces chaschu pork tender thinly sliced   Very spacious nice decor   two waitresses great making recommendations checking everything ok   definately back next time Im west side town  <EOR> My friend craving something soupy late night stumbled upon place  When first walked kind surprised nice inside restaurant was  ordered Miso Tonkatsu Ramen while she Shoyu Tonkatsu Ramen  both came into agreement dishes nothing note home about  Flavor portion okay well price range  doesn't pack much flavor compared other noddle joints    If remember correctly hot tea rice tea enjoyed sipping through cold night   Our server very attentive  She also kind whenever we'd ask questions requests suggestions  <EOR> First time here  Ordered beef steak Don tako yaki Overall food really good  place really cute def loved high ceilings  would def come back again  <EOR> Service great but food bad  wife food poison right away eating  <EOR> Had great lunch baba place  Lots selections easy dining  Ramen great also some other Japanese favs  sure try lunch specials <EOR> I love menu! always something fix japanese craving have  wish place better rating because didn't come longest time because rating wasn't high enough  But 5 star inexpensive japanese restaurant great ramen udon soba menu  appetizer menu also 2 pages sometimes just order off it  <EOR> Oh place!

Even little noodle bar  Only thing little chilly guess didn't heater but eating Ramen would warm no time!   For appetizer ordered Tuna Sashimi $10 which took little time me  tasted fresh stringy all some tunas would  creamy 3 different kind seaweeds  quite interesting especially clear looking one  yummy    For Ramen Tonkoysu Miso $7 75 toppings Nori $ 75 Egg $1 50   waiting order totally forgot add butter but once tasted ramen yummy buttery already didn't need anymore  tasteful yet light  came usual veggies bamboo shoots chashu  Although didn't taste much garlic which love ramen   Hubby son ordered Ton Katsu Curry Don  $10 00 came side salad ginger dressing miso soup  curry chicken together such good flavor perfect spiciness  time nothing wrong food  Everything delicious    Why only 3 stars? Well food took more time come other usual ramen places  also ordered 3 pork buns appetizer but never came cancel order since put bill  really chilly inside restaurant even eating Ramen being fact eat jacket super uncomfortable  lastly being Izakaya didn't much options menu other Izakayas  Other server great super happy all food got  definitely back more  <EOR> Seems changed interior since last time came here  booths now left side entrance!   If you're newbie Omoide craving curry late night definitely try ton katsu curry don  pork cutlets melt your mouth! delicious surprise reminded closed establishment years ago similar dish however couldn't find any place served anywhere Vegas life   until stepping into quaint little joint    Ton Katsu Curry Don consists generous amount pork cutlets white rice consistently doesn't sticky hard texture slices red ginger less wholesome amount curry sauce all over  always comes soup salad whether order dine go     Apparently tonkotsu ramen black garlic oil but only limited specific ramen which tried briefly few friends however flavorful may wasn't anything ordinary  late night Japanese beer specials definitely noteworthy though! <EOR> Well service great  Saturday lunch waitress entire restaurant   She did fantastic job serving clearing tables etc   However overall food okay nothing great   Katsu curry tasty but strong katsudon okay   Gyoza tasty  Big issue cleanliness  Salt pepper shakers soy sauce plate sticky dirty   Looks cleanliness leaves something desired   waitress she everything clean too?  Also looked counter customers utensils napkins laid curtain front but see supplies behind curtain  Would hope don't seat customers wouldn't sit stare curtain while eating   place needs work definitely start cleanliness  <EOR> I am fairly impressed Omoide!

Despite fact Sunday afternoon plenty open seats  Upon walking immediately greeted assigned seat  menu holds many options whether you're feeling ramen Japanese curry appetizers cold noodles  Its wide variety made question decision because everything looked good and wasn't even hungry     The pricing ridiculously good  Although only ordered two mini dishes appetizer filled total ended being lower fast food meal  There's no chicken option curry opted mini chicken curry bowl  pretty good sized only $4! boyfriend ordered chasu bowl karage super satisfied meal well    Our waiter super attentive knowledgeable too  He continuously checked filled water cups  definitely win win when service food quality mirrors another! top off there's great ambiance would highly recommend restaurant lunch dinner! definitely see ourselves returning near future  <EOR> Not bad liked ramen but just person working waited while she took order people behind first which don't know why     dinning experience wasn't very good but Ramen good    new hopefully more workers    lot beverage options    <EOR> I friend last week first time i love interior design see spend some time design  However ramen good  ordered shrimp tempura ramen  When serve dish tempura already melted soup  soup good either  server very nice though  <EOR> I've always wondered place tasted every time would drive it  next all amazing food spots decided give try some friends craving noodles soup    I ordered vegetarian soba noodles egg  asked spice rack only 4 options none them spicy  more savory mild nothing compared Monta any other ramen places    The ambiance overall nice play some great tunes  also noticed poke bowls which interesting overall advertised noodle place  <EOR> We recently moved side town came across restaurant  twice Omoides lunch special  can't quality price!
