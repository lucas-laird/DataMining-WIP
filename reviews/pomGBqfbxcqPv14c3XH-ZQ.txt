There good things Leticia's few not so good things    THE GOOD Our chips salsa waters brought table right away    within 3 minutes sitting down   that   chips weren't anything special any means but both types salsa very flavorful   especially liked chipotle based one   The menu lot variety lots things would liked try   hard decide I'd try first   The prices very reasonable big portions   My shrimp tacos excellent  The rice came them different story but more below  I'm embarrassed admit ate through whole basket chips whole cup chipotle salsa     but happy say didn't even ask     just brought more soon done   The service staff seems work very well together   seemed top things everywhere looked definitely good us   THE BAD My husband's seafood enchiladas definitely meh  Very bland tasting more pasta type sauce top   But even more bland rice came shrimp tacos   UGH some nasty dry tasteless stuff!  Our desserts very fairly priced but just kinda meh too   He fried ice cream which kind stale tasting shell around ice cream   sopapillas which ok   mean just fried dough some cinammon sugar     there's whole lot     but better   If going kids would good section but because date night put here   place VERY much family restaurant   said GOOD thing if kids    would definitely think taking daughter     but if you're going date night type atmosphere wouldn't choose place   LOTS kids    pretty noisy     And apparently minority since seems every restaurant doing now     but don't understand why TVs playing sports every wall   sports bar pub?

A bit warning Tex Mex flavors more milder side  If need offer various hot sauces   I ordered soft tortilla soup great subtle tomato flavor squeezed lime good balance bean starchy flavor   You also appreciate care put into chicken enchiladas baked perfectly without being overcooked shredded chicken moist seasoned perfectly   great deal $11 change   If any drawback drive Strip would take 30 35 minutes here   But won't detract great food  <EOR> I hate doing but feel needs said    Firstly love Leticia's  love mean eat lot  lot mean frequent place least once month   lot me    The reason update service  sit bar because play free drinks  usually just boyfriend I  Otherwise we'll sit table  almost always bad experience when we're seated  waiters waitresses seem rushed annoyed just generally pretty rude  hate being biased way long  seriously lacking treat clients  rarely check take forever food drinks  If smaller larger party made no difference  Each time waiting long just server doesn't seem keen helping us    The bartenders awesome  few new ones excellent  food each time come perfectly delicious always  main reason come place   Now hate referring people here  Each time say same thing  loved food but hated service    So give 3 stars servers please   do ruin such great place  food drinks bartenders give 5 stars  <EOR> This place ZERO! took husband birthday dinner few good reviews  Well place just awful! waited two hours table take reservations  bar wait waited 20 minutes someone notice ask if wanted anything** another 25 minutes receive drinks bottle beer house Margarita no straw! Asked waitress check table witch she never did Three times husband check apparently skipped even checking 3 times The staff very roude unwelcoming  food nothing great exactly same neighbor hood taqurilla but ten times more expensive  very upset ruining husbands dinner  never back give bad reviews  come if want great Mexican place Lindo Michuacan should take tips them*** hate place! <EOR> Place gone downhill since first review  back several times always hit miss  really depends server but even when basically empty service slow  <EOR> Try Mexican Roasted Corn DEEEE Family karaoke Fridays Tuesdays! <EOR> Oh my!!!

I've tried little bit everything here   but favorites probably Burritos tacos!  You essentially customize your own food salsa ingredients course meat! particular burrito made Al Pastor Red Guajillo Black Beans House Blend Cheese  BEAST   had take other half go! Really loved salsa   it actually bit spicy!  I also liked Queso Fundido Chorizo Gouda Menonita Cheese  Super cheesy mix tons oil fat   just chorizo should be! almost cheesy actually being super stringy little difficult pulling apart! But  friends for   to help your cheese!  Even complimentary salsa chips great bottomless if enjoy them much us!   Prices seem bit steep first but quality ingredients taste portions worth it   Wish portions smaller more reasonable prices reflect that   ie burrito half size but around $10 mark vs $15   Took plenty pics check em out! <EOR> I lived Las Vegas over 13 years yet find any Mexican restaurant come close establishment   starters owners wonderful people   food absolutely spot every time flawless authentic get   Nothing strip anywhere else Vegas comes close   travel San Diego business visit section city called old town  filled Mexican restaurants cafes none them come close this   sad close Mexican boarder yet better Mexican food Las Vegas   Try place once you'll addicted just since day opened  <EOR> My husband just moved AZ just love love place   service always wonderful food is    The owner wonderful lady kitchen cooking food  Yum yum!!!  say only month almost lunch dinner 20 times  Yes good  <EOR> I absolutely love coming restaurant  treat would if visiting home  food delicious super authentic  don't win best taco award no reason!!!

Restrooms large clean  Atmosphere positive lively loud side  Park behind restaurant best parking options  seems road construction always happening area  <EOR> Stopped lunch  guests knee bad shape kind enough seat right entrance  5 Star service  Very kind personable  rita came perfect  even try accommodate any way needed  example if want special drink made certain way  Food delicious  Cannot wait come back try tacos  <EOR> My wife moved 3 months ago San Antonio good SA if better   first time told Walter server just moved SA would hard please   comment let order fantastic   Several trips later decided could try Tamales Christmas   Tamales Christmas tradition but cheated some last night DELICIOUS!!  Chipotle Tamales fantastic   sure where some reviewers ate cut could thanks Walter all your help making selections  <EOR> This place used favorite Mexican food restaurant Valley but found another   Juan's Flaming Fajitas see review   Anyways more Leticia's food eclectic however sometimes basic ingredient salt missed food comes bit bland  flavor aspect especially Mexican restaurant missing  Additionally prices pretty exorbitantly high quality taste dwindled over years  Happy Hour want cry *whispers* expensive too! Honestly come conclusion Leticia's survives well does partly because location  sits upper middle class neighborhood within upper middle class part NW Vegas  also most authentic Mexican restaurant miles   of anyone says Lindo Michoacan authentic going remind them cheesy stereotypical atmosphere bland food salsa tastes rip off Heinz Ketchup  Also think Leticia's survives well also because puffy tacos green salsa yes dead serious  amazing green citrusy avocado salsa craves attention most pregnant women tacos lovers salsa fanatics  Anyways Leticia's always place heart especially because live 2 minutes away NW Valley but now drive 40 minutes Juan's Mexican food infatuation <EOR> Came first time today food great! really enjoyed bean dip cheese chorizo! service good too! Ill back <EOR> Leticias great happy hour menu  regular menu delicious well  carne asada wonderfully flavored  Loved grilled corn well  Guacamole great start here  <EOR> Last night husband looked said want carne asada! Onto Yelp find good authentic Mexican restaurant   just moved area don't know neighbors well enough ask any suggestions   hit miss when comes ratings Yelp more place since moving LV   say visit Leticia's HIT!  We took two kids little bit wait seated but no more 10 minutes   sat booth right next kitchen could smell food   brought chips beans 2 salsas asked drink orders   kids ordered sodas while husband Blue Moon blended strawberry margarita   dug into chips beans salsa   enjoyed tomatillo salsa while husband liked red salsa both loved beans   children ordered off kids menu son bean cheese burrito came beans rice while daughter ordered hard ground beef taco which also came beans rice but she only wanted rice   husband ordered street taco platter which offered 3 street tacos choice carne asada al pastor carnitas chicken   He 2 carnitas 1 carne asada served rice beans   ordered Ensenada taco platter which offered two tacos your choice fish shrimp which each   The food arrived fresh hot quick   husband devoured taco platter leaving nothing behind   would say he enjoyed it!  son ate all burrito brought beans rice home   daughter only ate rice taco because she full   only ate fish taco small portion rice beans   packed leftovers boxes which great reuse them!  All all total bill just under $60 4 without tip   Pros 1  Nice variety offerings menu 2   Chips salsa beans  3  Portion size   Cons 1  When daughter asked no beans asked if could give double rice instead   kitchen didn't that   wasn't worth sending back more  2  Parking little strange   parking lot behind next restaurant but seems odd  3  cons aren't deal breakers we'll back! <EOR> Yummy food cool restaurant large menu kid friendly yummy drinks decently short wait times! just wish little cheaper   quite expensive Mexican food  <EOR> Leticia's great Mexican restaurant located northwest side town! located little downtown type atmosphere  offer outside seating well inside dining  establishment itself very clean comfortable inside  bar gaming but does take away full restaurant experience! visited Leticia's 6 times since moved area town every time wonderful experience  creature habit tend same things every time place  love build your own burrito! very filling portion size everything giant! Everyone brought establishment loved ended returning friends families  definitely continue come back when mood good quality Mexican food! <EOR> This place good all  spent more time waiting check did anything else over 45 minutes  food tasteless    Definitely coming back    <EOR> I only during happy hour because amazing  great margaritas food always good  find service tends better if just sit bar! <EOR> This place awesome  probably best nachos ever had   ! If come highly recommend street tacos menu  three different ones $12  tamales also great but best value opt half dozen dozen take some home!

Overall just 3 star spot me  really excited first time in hopes finding good sit down mexican restaurant   but unfortunately Leticias isn't least  There's nothing extra special aside from it being only decent restaurant within Tule Springs vicinity  Nothing drive across town for   They busy though but able bring stroller without inconvenience no broken buckle high chairs! <EOR> wow   WOW   W O W!!  this place fantastic! impressed mexican food place  horchata divine!!! no rice water powder carne asada burrito spectacular husband red posole couldn't stop eating bowl  FIVE stars well deserved  waiters very nice too!! its 12 miles strip but if want some great authentic mexican food come here! <EOR> Excellent!!! last minute wedding cater 30 guests  Leticia's referred friend  staff very helpful courteous food top notch  asked order ready 4 some time spare decided pull chair order plate while waited catering order completed  Boy disappointed first experience Leticia's  Also wedding guests similarly impressed  Friendly staff great food awesome prices great atmosphere repeat customer  Thanks again Leticia!!! <EOR> The food again delicious  chile relleno carmelitas small bowl pazole  Both very flavorful fresh tasting   Unfortunately time service somewhat below average which hard understand  considering busy all lunch  Despite weak service continue work way through menu  <EOR> Been few times still just impressed  prices high for Mexican food   I am ever impressed server always busy doing other things except tending tables   The people help drinks food runners better!
