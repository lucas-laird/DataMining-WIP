Awful way begin Vegas trip    You see awesome Sinatra memorabilia neat   But nothing exciting here  Very over hyped   <EOR> From minute arrived treated guests  food amazing  service best encountered  decor very appealing   I highly recommend stopping if Las Vegas  <EOR> Very good all way around  Daughter 21st birthday meal  Only criticism menu rather limited  Everything highest quality  <EOR> not cheap but pay more less  Somewhere special night rather scarf before craps  Service excellent Food OK no complaints wine good  everywhere else long wait didn't very good  maybe because hidden relatively quiet Encore <EOR> Outstanding service really impeccable   Seating time nice table set ups lighting could little lower but good ambiance veal dish spot ricotta dessert best ever tasted  <EOR> I am all splurging great dining experience especially while culinary Mecca Las Vegas but place it  None descriptions menu sounded good but tried keep open mind  Ordered Quattro Formaggi starter 4 cheese plate which come surprise four cheeses assortment seasonal accompaniments   menu said     imagining fruit bread crackers olives maybe little prosciutto salame  Grape tomatoes    anything! Man wish took picture $30 cheese plate! husband literally laughed loud when arrived table  four measly bite size jokes cheese two which inedible  no idea because neither menu nor waiter provided any descriptions but didn't taste look cheese  those seasonal accompaniments? Five almonds  Yep five almonds  offended waiter didn't tell ridiculous starter when ordered it  Beyond complimentary bread ice cold stale  food over priced ranging unimpressive downright awful  Im frustrated myself sending everything back normal person probably would have  But hey no ever asked doing whether enjoying meals anyway  never even asked if wanted water refills  sure why dining experience different other reviewers but would never recommend restaurant anyone  EVER  Spend your hard earned money thousands other restaurants area  <EOR> Overpriced but Vegas so    Everything delicious  shared halibut filet medium well   Both cooked perfection  Husband enjoyed sea bass  Fresh baked Focaccia bread basket served beginning meal  nice limoncello raspberry sorbet finished off meal nicely  No complaints other overpriced  <EOR> Service outstanding place   both felt very welcomed moment walked into restaurant   staff remembered special occasion offered complimentary dessert end   Our wait staff very responsive professional   Appetizers great feel even much better main course taste presentation   entree hubby's lamb chop carried no salt while veal chop uneven seasoning surface   However when hubby brought issue mashed potato server immediately fixed apologized   Again service awesome   We wonderful time believed entree wasn't perfect cos busy labor day weekend  <EOR> Dinner perfect  probably best if best places dinner Vegas  ambience service music food all incredible  place whenever come back town  Thank you! <EOR> Service excellent food very good  Enjoyed Caesar salad veal parmigiana panna cotta  <EOR> Lovely!

still fabulous  Servers host staff very accommodating your every wish  decor absolutely beautiful lush garden venue available those would dine alfresco complete fireplaces heaters cooler weather  Menu somewhat limited but complete meat fish pasta categories  decided share filet ten ounce smallest available pasta mixed green salad which also shared  server placed everything center table even going far slicing filet us  true dining experience while listening Frank croon back ground  top off shared over top pana cotta flight vintage ports ten forty years age  many great  choices Italian food Las Vegas but Steve Wynn says menu forward think Frank would really place you! <EOR> After reading several amazing reviews chose 30th Birthday dinner friends Vegas  extremely disappointed  service par fabulous Wynn name  ask things removed table etc  ambiance quite nice but bland   expected something little more nostalgic Sinatra  all  where were  must say bathrooms fabulous  food biggest disappointment  carpacio lacking flavor needed salt  absolute worst entrees Osso buccu extremely fatty virtually zero sauce accent it  risotto ok  sea bass also just bad  all lacked flavor  Please avoid restaurant unless your bland food mediocre service generic entrees  best part meal when magician appeared table some amazing tricks saved evening!

We caprese fettuccine alfredo black truffles apps  capresse ok but alfredo huge disappointment  black truffles no aroma    clearly used oil alfredo any flavor   tasted prior shavings truffle fresh truffle added  No difference  Look picture  covered shavings! Yet flavorless $105 appetizer complete bust    For dinner osso buco veal parmesan  Both nice cuts meat decent sauces but overall would say just ok Clearly only few items menu maybe just unlucky    The manager cane over apologized offered buy dessert  Nice jester  Hind sight should told them eairlier maybe something different <EOR> Fancy enough dress code effect IE guys no shorts great food decent service if hearing Frank Sinatra may well love here! It large restaurant outdoor seating could see fireplace looked very inviting  Resos recommended  The dishes perhaps pricier need get    BUT   if order clams spaghetti did $33 ton clams heaped pasta overcooked phew! many places overcook pasta feel ripped off here  Some may say seasoning bit much but fine  Especially no salt pepper table  clams properly cleaned gritty  I ask black pepper pasta should offered appetizer salad but small detail   The Riesling white wine very good but $16 glass better be! My friends each lasagna also around $33 enjoyed it  found portions adequate  I recommend Caesar salad start although found missing bit bacon extra yummy  Perfectly cool crisp lettuce dressed perfectly overloaded croutons  We also shared Caprese salad while less hearty option staff split 2 plates without even asking mozza very fresh   We skipped dessert just full but left feeling nice meal would recommend if staying near Wynn Encore  <EOR> Fantastic Italian meal!

Although might expect bit pretentiousness such classy restaurant Michael certainly dispelled notion  He welcomed Sinatra provided quick description restaurant well award winning Chef Theo Schoenegger  Michael described Sinatra obviously Italian restaurant  However Chef Theo approached menu taking classic Italian dishes utilized reverse culinary engineering deconstruct ingredients  He then implements influence dishes create modern feel classic Italian selections  said he elegantly over menu giving brief description dishes he recommends  hearing Michael's monologue must say excited!  While waiting food arrive dad brought bottle wine table 2005 Caymus Special Selection  believe corkage fee around $40? Michael took orders sommelier or wine steward quickly came table asked if we'd wine placed decanter  saying yes observed wine master work delicately pouring wine its original bottle into decanter then taking bottle close lighted candle observe if any sediments left  few minutes allowing wine aerate breathe within decanter she sampled wine taste any tannins  Deemed ready  she brought wine table witnessing all made wine even more enjoyable! actually just came Napa Valley consumed much wine during trip as expected haha dad having conversation her  She very charming answered many wine related questions nice   Okay onto food  Sorry wait! appetizers decided share amongst 5 us  ordered two orders each Assaggini Di Mare quartet sea Polpettine meatballs polenta mushrooms Cappesante seared Maine scallops   didn't much sea quartet but definitely vouch Polpettine Cappesante! meatballs bursting flavor well scallops  Together celery kumquat fruits diverse combination scallops produced refreshing taste palate kumquat complimented scallops well while celery acted bridge put two tastes together   I ordered ravioli butternut squash vanilla amaretto second choice  bit disappointed taste bit bland palate  Perhaps butternut squash? vanilla foam top however nice touch ravioli  dad recommended Agnolotti ricotta herbs parmesan sauce chives maybe next time   For main course ordered Colorado Rack Lamb along side mashed Yukon Gold potato  Yum! lamb tender flavorful! meat tasted delicate literally hanging thread off meat  potato puree excellent compliment lamb which suggested Michael  sure Chef Theo did but try meat see yourself!  For dessert bread pudding gelato  contrasting flavors temperatures made end dining experience even more enjoyable!
