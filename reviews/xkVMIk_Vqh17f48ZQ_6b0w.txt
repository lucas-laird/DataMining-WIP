I high hopes Craftsteak definitely delivered  Fantastic food classy yet unpretentious environment amazing service    Some notes We ordered cheaper steaks menu AMAZING  Melt your mouth  Hard imagine good Waygu other pricey ones would be  But don't feel you'll shortchanged ordering cheaper ones  Don't skip salads  fava bean salad best thing ate  knew salad could good  Sit bar before dinner if time  reservation running bit late drink  bartenders most delicious strong drinks    If love steak want classy dinner Vegas here! won't disappointed  <EOR> Very disappointing! many high end steak houses Mid West Craftsteak would rank top 10   The good All sides tried very good  But $15 $22 sides should good  risotto favorite  mashed potatoes also very good  Caesar's salad classic real anchovies    Service decent but little slow times  The bad I grilled NY strip bone ordered medium  lengthy wait  steak came way past medium  sent back  another 15 minutes another steak came cooked properly  wife finished meal however before second steak came  But steak worst $50 steak ever had  dry age steak very tough  Even steak knife hard cut  Most high end steakhouses trim gristle fat outside steak but here  only ate half steak    They offered nothing inconvenience no free desserts discounts meal  Just sorry    We made reservations 7 45pm  plenty tables available when called  seated next bar bar really  Terrible seats! Loud constantly getting bumped people bar    This expected Tom Colichio restaurant  <EOR> I suppose some explainin' considering group 3 friends dropped $500 dinner yet only gave 3 stars    So let start sides  tried Hen Woods mushrooms gold yukon potato puree asparagus  hen woods mushrooms quite good but nothing can't put together myself  no great sauce no POW factor  gold yukon potatoes fine nice potatoes boiled pureed baby food texture  No special unique flavors going there  Finally convinced asparagus just microwaved some water  Very poor effort guys  Considering each dishes $15 $25 very disappointed    Now onto some better things  lobster bisque which very good  Nice creamy succulent chunks lobster  only complaint if even counts served ton  very rich didn't cup bisque giant bowl    On most important thing which steaks  friends ordered 16oz Ribeye 16oz New York Strip 12oz Hanger grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak  all really really good but mixed feelings here  Sure cooked perfectly but home grill  No sauces nothing just pure steak goodness  first time ordering wagyu beef good but actually preferred Hanger four steaks ordered    Overview service impeccable  wine list extensive however price range $125 per person without drinks   Though steaks bisque great sides eerily reminiscent grandmothers terrible cooking  think Craftsteak poor value your buck therefore give 3 5 A OK  <EOR> Food amazing!!! scallop starter which where best scallops ever great size main T bone steak which just broke off bone absolute quality! side mixed cauliflower which cooked beautiful!

The atmosphere nice cozy dark very masculine decor  lovely  Service excellent friendly   ordered Pom Rita rocks delicious order another one!   They brought warm delicious yeast rolls table while waited    We ordered tomato bisque goat cheese Bibb salad bacon blue cheese  He loved soup salad fantastic  bacon lardons good little kept stealing them salad! salad dressed blue cheese dressing generous sized salad    For mains he ordered filets medium rare  He corn side ordered grits  little flat iron stake medium rare potato purée    The food incredible  Steaks great unique flavor sides delicious  Grits perfectly cooked corn nice surprise   The real standout little one's flat iron steak  ordered because smaller no kids' menu might imagine   flavor incredible  Perfectly medium rare flavorful  potato purée also good but he polished off steak!   We didn't order dessert nothing but all looked good    Definitely respect judging he dishes Top Chef! <EOR> This restaurant bit expensive but food decor service all worth every cent spend there   wait staff very polite attentive   food excellent desserts even better   very extensive wine collection ordered dinner glass wine waiter stingy it   good place take your date enjoy very good dinner very good company  <EOR> Had dinner bar Friday night   always Craftsteak great experience   Beef Tartare never miss while Vegas   meal itself but ruin Tartare anywhere else   Braised Beef Short Rib also favorite   fall off bone tender rich   yourself favor choose bar over dining room   Bartenders Larry Alexis steer perfect dinner more relaxed setting dining room  can't wrong  <EOR> As much hate glorify expensive meals think Craftsteak deserves lot praise  Compared other steakhouses Vegas e g  SW Cut place really does hold its ground! Yes did spend $600 two W O including alcohol MGM Grand all places LOL  But let tell Craftsteak very special any price    To start just two us  both ordered 3 course 'A5' Japanese Wagyu shared side potato puree mushrooms asparagus  definitely LOT food!     should mention although ordered separately decided share eat family style since both want rib eye strip more later    Appetizer + Wagyu beef tartare + Braised artichokes  + Grilled quail      The artichokes quail okay  But tartare very good  topped raw quail egg chips eat with  tuna tartare beef carpaccio before but beef tartare  definitely treat    Entree + 'A5' Wagyu Ribeye + 'A5' Wagyu Strip   AMAZING every level  virtue being genuine kobe beef would say 75% work already done them  But considering delicate nature meat think chefs did masterful job preparation  meat cooked perfection love use rosemary skillet presentation  Quite honestly very difficult differentiate between ribeye strip because both extremely EXTREMELY rich texture taste and   oh tender  also very generous cuts  never really checked much supposed but think both ribeye strip 10 oz ea ? Trust kobe beef  LOT!! separate note maybe because decided share meals but steaks pre cut us    Sides + Potato Puree + Mushrooms + Asparagus  Mushrooms asparagus okay  But potato puree REALLY good! don't really know explain it   mashed potatoes miniature cast iron kettle   very delicate tasty soft?   Dessert  + don't really care much dessert but 2 cakes sherbet  good  But already stuffed   didn't take more 2 small bites each   + french pressed coffee really good though  should asked kind beans used     Drinks + glass wine server recommended   good but untrained palette wine wouldn't know any better + flavored martinis good   Decor Contemporary warm inviting   without over the top glitz glamor associated Vegas fine dining e g  Joel Robuchon  surprisingly casual?  Service excellent! server really REALLY good  But then again think easier patrons serve night    Overall think Collichio did marvelous job one  If you're looking fancy steak house place Vegas  know there's lot options location MGM little far center Strip but think worth it especially if you're planning watching KA event Grand Arena  <EOR> Good food but nothing really blew away  eaten Craft Manhattan nothing compares  Excellent sides proteins price wise family style dinner available super reasonable  Since many great steak houses Vegas probably wouldn't back  MGM though if your looking good steak might place stop but worth special trip  <EOR> Poor Example High End Steakhouse  Overpriced $58 10oz Filet only tough but lacked any flavor  thought just bad cut Steak  NY Strip across table also flavorless  Very Expensive even Vegas  Don't waste your time money place  Definitely would return  <EOR> Yummy tummy!  Pricey but well worth it! group those kobe beef tasting menus supplemented appetizers side dishes dessert  lot food lot! Even 12 hours later full! Nothing fancy but just simply tasty food    The wine selection pretty extensive even selection wine glass pretty good  Service could bit better   Got rec some friends  Perfect place group dinner lot money spend = <EOR> This pretty disappointing experience   started mixed lettuce greens expecting some kind salad but just some lettuce mixed little oil vinegar   guess trying some kind simple thing but simple   gave little rolls which decent enough except bit salt top which just easily sweep off   main course skirt steak   cooked properly fine   could just well making home   really push kobe wagyu dishes heavy when sit down but dont deserve business $40 steak Im going buy $100 steaks them?  think not   dont remember dessert   Probably nothing special since dont remember it     This place isnt come Vegas for   lettuce thing kind joke didnt start things off well  <EOR> Food perfect! salad dessert wouldn't change thing   filet fork cutting tender   loved corn chives potato purée   Service matched food   Very attentive friendly   Two thumbs up!! <EOR> I honestly loved restaurant but main reason steakhouse else steak  seated right away reservation started glass Dr  Heidemanns Bergweiler Germany 2005 Riesling which if anyone fan Riesling would love wine  brought some warm moist buttery rolls just delicious   I started off Foie Gras  nice chunk warm Foie Gras believe some kind sweet beet salad next it  dish simply amazing  flavor combination between two just each other Pb j far best Foie Gras had  entree ordered Skirt Steak  came way ordered medium but just didn't hit spot me  very salty flavor just wasn't there  told server Las Vegas celebrating 21rst birthday surprise brought Vanilla Bean Cheesecake Fig Compote Sweet Cream glass desert wine which simply delicious  made steak   Overall would given Craftsteak 5 stars but whole reason going steakhouse steak failed department me  Service 5 stars throughout dinner enjoyed ambiance lot  room dark warm sophisticated which steakhouse  <EOR> It just two dinner husband ordered tasting menu   chose angus beef menu which 3 courses salad protein sides dessert   $125 per person lot food very reasonable enough four people!

Plenty other restaurants lower quality ease   waited another 20ish minutes bar starving!  Service awful   Others said well   waitress couple large tables obvious worth time   Im paying lot money pour own overpriced wine   server helper which did help all Im sure exactly she helping 10 minute conversation something very depth while wating food which took forever! We didnt even start eating until 10 ridiculous   Food Lobster Bisque excellent good amount lobster creamy yummy   Wish stuck just but     My husband New York Steak $44 Sirloin $56   worth even little bit   buy steaks half would cook them correctly    We both ordered Medium husbands Medium well mine Medium Rare   waited long food waitress nowhere seen didnt send them back  They werent awful but basic nothing expected   figured going best steak Ive thats hoping experience Charlie Palmer like   But worst part side Kale smoked bacon   told didnt any left then all sudden order left   assuming left bottom smoker found us   worst thing long time   Nothing but smoked flavor kale kale jerkey   If Tom would asked he thinking but no because said service awful   Oh    wine list overpriced   mean expect somewhat thats fine but when average price wine menu $150 know wine $40 elsewhere thats just ripping off because can   We felt suckers dinner here   Lured name nothing show it   Oh guess portions large leftovers great because most people vacation without way eat leftovers   Suckers  <EOR> Heard lot good things place wanted good steak  decided order porterhouse split some sided  ordered Medium flavorful fantastic even though should asked Med + Med Well because just shy med  brought amuse bouche while waiting between courses which thought pretty classy even though weren't waiting very long all  All all very good <EOR> My girlfriend vacation wanted treat ourselves fancy dinner  exactly did! service welcoming helpful really made experience much better  atmosphere calm relaxing  both ordered prefixed menu which nervous  brought four starters which meal itself  giggled dived into each dish  short break main coarse rare filet perfectly cooked pork chop arrived accompanied creamy mashed potatoes variety mushrooms sweet corn  Feeling very stuffed knew dessert would still crawling its way table  Maybe would scoop ice cream sorbet mascarpone? Maybe monkey bread caramel sauce? Oh maybe some fresh fruit top off massive meal? Well sort wrong  all desserts mentioned! early enjoy cocktail some wine don't rush  Enjoy meal atmosphere! <EOR> After watching all those Top Chef episodes just try place see if Tom Colichio's flavors married well  All flavors certainly did   steaks fantastic perfectly looked cooked   seasonings delicious unique being just steak  flavors overbearing but definitely bland   sis duck confit which nicely prepared flavored   Probably best duck dishes ever tried   service good really could complain  But thing drove nuts steak knives!  most useless knives butter knives sharp point   guess good thing steak tender enough did hack it   I would give place 5 stars but considering Picasso day before could put same category  <EOR> This restaurant way overrated  tried winter tasting menu lobster bisque   very impressed  took while waiter bring bread even all great  better Texas roadhouse  meal quite expensive got  only thing liked quail appetizer which juicy tasty but beefs not  disappointment    meal way overpriced  sorry say quality food only par high buffet quality food such those wynn bellagio  <EOR> Great service  Great food   Every server pleasant friendly treated actually wanted serve us  seemed somewhat rarity Las Vegas  Waiter made helpful recommendations  Food fantastic Quail blueberry appetizer pea puree risotto bread pudding dessert standouts  Serving sizes generous  Did disappoint  Skip Heritage Steak which lesser shabbier version Crafsteak for more less same price    would return Craftsteak anytime Vegas  <EOR> Pros indicated other reviews lobster bisque amazing husband did two rib eye flavor awesome ours served wild mushrooms   Wine list incredible scotch list hubby quite impressed with   Even though know bread shouldn't eaten before big dinner    couldn't help myself    good   But didn't come bread!    Cons knew pricey going in    just hoping could justify everything else  little things stopped being over top experience    servers condescending intimidating   ribeye meat chewier expected    lucky enough score booth against wall facing entire restaurant privacy but could readily see if table two seated middle would noisy   9pm packed     I higher hopes Tom C's place would say other places Vegas steak where aren't dropping $250 $300  <EOR> I'm sure rave place   wife thought average best   price way high quality    cheaper better steak Ruth's Chris steakhouse    really excited eat big let down   bread service excellent  just don't understand why people think need change classic dish   filet's sauce gross mash potatoes way over blended new when ordering but great but Brussel sprouts really good    Very slow if hurry place  I'd suggest saving your money elsewhere  <EOR> Of all Vegas steakhouses favorite   actually pick between dry aged wet aged grain fed grass fed   dry aged steaks excellent friends wet aged say very good well   An edge Craftsteak its excellent side dishes   only outdoes Yukon mashed potatoes Robuchon very much   only restaurant better creamed spinach DC Palm which different recipe creamed spinach all other Palms U S   There occassion where service bit slow but other always outstanding restaurant   expensive but worth it  <EOR> Went Vegas birthday weekend eye Craftsteak months advance   Disclaimer am big fan Tom Colicchio Top Chef   watching critique and coming chefs years wanted see if he goods    Craftsteak did disappoint   am no expert fine dining but really enjoyed experience   Beautiful dining room perfectly lit energetic crowd buzz but reasonable volume   service awesome food better expected    We domestic wagyu beef tasting menu which spot on   Just sat back drinks let servers deliver amazing dish dish table   FYI Wagyu really does taste better regular prime cuts   portions no joke   delicious lobster soup three appetizers full ribeye full filet mignon three amazing side dishes brought four desserts almost exploded being full   picture tasting menu's wimpy portions but total opposite   don't think party 4 could finished all food served     Bill around $450 including tip party 2 but felt money's worth   100% worthwhile experience if coin  <EOR> Very disappointed house specialties lobster bisque 24 hour shortrib  best part meal side dishes maui onions risotto   spent $220 meal two drink money would better spent Flemming's Ruth Chris  place also overly crowded difficult hold conversation  wait staff did great job explaining menu providing quality service  <EOR> Let just start off saying fan Tom Colicchio any way shape form   fact he irks but  another story  Despite feelings impressed Craftsteak    I say really hesitant dining because whole celebrity chef thing  more food am names but thought menu sounded great reviews good gave go    I'm really glad did   food point ranked highly book some better restaurants eaten NY SF   enjoyed heirloom tomato salad shrimp cocktail starter both tremendous flavor   tomatoes beautifully ripened perfectly dressed   shrimp large wonderfully fresh    For entree split 16 oz ribeye which cooked perfection veal reduction sauce   Omg sauce!  dipping everything possible into would licked plate if could   small girl but could finished steak own don't let 1 lb freak out   sides wonderful well roasted carrots honey AMAZING   tasted even better steak jus     I really enjoyed dinner would most definitely return   Don't let your thoughts good bad Tom sway you   worth visit start your night off right Vegas   Oh gluten free eaters Craftsteak work order   Another plus me! <EOR> I very disappointed tonight Craftsteak  probably into restaurant 3 4 times month  understand extremely busy tonight but all but forgotten wait staff  given very small table lounge which normally would fine but tonight crowded this  asked moved basically ignored  table way small food brought both wife myself utensils fall off table  find fed packed everything left  recommendation restaurant busy nights  <EOR> Boyfriend ate recent trip Vegas  wonderful   fairly early reservation 6 30 wasn't terribly crowded   service very prompt attentive     Once ordered brought warm bread rolls   soft pretty tasty   Nothing norm though   each steaks fabulous  Cooked perfection   sides potato puree asparagus both quite good   roasted corn side dish heavenly   honestly don't know all but most awesome corn ever had    and big veggie person   Servings generous side dishes everything served family style pass them around share   We full weren't able dessert  <EOR> Great place steak  I kobe skirt steak say best steak ever had  Very tender sides just great  Service over top  If going spend money place spend  Extremely high recommended  <EOR> This place oozes much class thought would call Sir    then ask leave   Most restaurants Vegas diners full view people passing by joint   ushered into huge dimly lit back area multiple stations large booths casual areas well   person going around taking pictures diners create memory books   didn't know it   saw woman convince reluctant husband buy it   wanted take picture see much would cost cherish memories official form but better half shooed away phtographer   slightly but noticeably disappointed   We American Kobe menu which knew would going but asked waiter explain anyways   mean head waiter assistant waiter bus boy water boy   Division labor would any union proud   sheer number people attending adds alot both experience bill experience getting bill unforgettable     The kobe tartare strange but grew me   Raw beef crackers?  guess eating spoonfuls raw beef just wasn't classy enough   avoided all mushrooms but peppers fine   When entrees sides came weren't quite ready part appetizers them leave everything table   sight since think every inch table covered plate food it   meat served small skillets diced which odd but sense context sharing   American Kobe rib eye skirt steak medium rare   Oddly enough skirt steak much more flavorful   suspect used more seasoning since its tougher cut ribeye should able stand its own   Both steaks cooked well tender sitting its own juices  I'm going Official Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef Hyogo prefecture some day because would say there's huge difference quality moving Prime American Kobe   last frontier credit card shaking though    I don't think ate much more half anything brought before stuffed   brought much food much left table mildly embarassing   desserts great but once again done much food   Unfortunately bit underwhelmed steak though   steak took home doggy bag fed wife's dog   wasn't disappointed miss it  <EOR> I'm only giving 3 stars instead 2 because service waiter great  very underwhelmed food  steak ok cooked just good steak home  rib eye medium rare wasn't very tender  wife filet bit better  mashed potatoes side runny consistency smoothy  Which might ok some but very bland texture just wasn't right  If paid maybe 25$ person meal would say would worth but considering bill $160 without tip mixed drink two steaks side worth all  fine steak houses honestly say worst them  prefer Mastros Larsen's much more  Don't waste your time here  <EOR> Yelp let down time   debated between 1 2 stars but settled 2 because steak reason came good   Ambiance OK but made reservation seated bar area   annoying   Another couple sat down next complained re seated table   guess if complain give better table?  restaurant wasn't full 7PM Saturday night sure why seated bar area reservation     Appetizers shrimp cocktail lobster bisque soup   Soup good big chunks lobster shrimp coctail good but size shrimp very small considering price     We ordered all food when sat down told waitress hurry very hungry please bring food fast possible   then waited hour steaks   didn't menu two options steaks grilled roasted roasted 20% more waitress offered very little information difference between two   take don't know best way cook steak think restaurant should method sell best method   ordered each thinking could try each others see difference   Unfortunately waitress brought two same steaks when figured weren't ordered no offer bring another anything other meek apology waitress    Steaks good but mine luke warm sitting 15 minutes warm     Got broccolini gratin potato sides both very good     Each glass house Pino good but pricey @ $17 glass     Ordered apple vanilla crisp desert fantastic but way overpriced @ $15     Total before tip $250   Very disappointing experience much better options strip sure place such high marks  <EOR> For upscale steak house expecting bit better   It still overall good would come back again  order 3 course menu next time  I Waygu steak definately tasty but somehow expected something more  Steaks all cooked perfection bill some extra charges   The lobster bisque ok  Capital grille if want great lobster bisque  Sides very good  mash fries Service nice friendly   Food 4 Value 3 Service 4  I prefer Capital Grille  <EOR> Off sensation Vegas couple weeks ago! Since event MGM Grand Garden Arena decided quick bite  craftsteak before party began lol   We didn't reservation only able sit bar area which perfect quick dinner    Their lobster bisque really good chuck lobster there  Ordered foie gras good wagyu ribeye new york strip potato gratin hen woods  just ok steak!!!

Taking first bite eyes just lit experiencing explosion beefy flavor mouth   swear meat tender only chew three times before swallowing now  steak should be   Since ribeye bone in more flavor closer bone rare once bone itself   During meal conversation died down mainly revolved telling each other good steak along making sounds joy while eating incredible food   As side au gratin potatoes excellent really creamy artery clogging sure french fries right crunch but little saltier side me   sides especially fries good portion definitely fill up   meal server came desert menu but full even ponder desert seeing couldn't even finish fries   Overall loved place coming back future service good food amazing   When all said done bill came $138 not including tip which bad great steaks great service  <EOR> Amazing meal except           much food     tasting menu     Lobster bisque really good lot lobster comparison most     stuffed ourselves main course point couldn't take anymore leaving almost entrée course uneaten   Just when ready bring desert course     FOUR huge plates desert only two us      Go hungry      don't fill bread  <EOR> Highly dissapointed!

If appetite mood classy sit down then must stop by   *Sorry  No pix accompany review  greedily indulged before even thought snapping photo <EOR> My three stars price dependant just heads but even if bill halved wouldnt break 4 stars   wanted check Colicchio's place being huge fan Top Chef   wont lie expectations set high   The place packed when buddy there   No worries its great people watching bar everyhing could possibly want   When seated noticed glad buddy gal felt cafeteria   think size place open just observation  service very good attentive but fussy   bread really good everyone says little sea salt top made it     Now main course mushrooms asparagus gratin potatoes   potatos good but when arent potatos gratin good expecting great   others blah took awhile remember thats ehh were   Now biggest dissapointment   domestic wagyu ribeye medium rare buddy ribeye medium rare    Side side comparison   Mine little overcooked unwilling wait them right   agreement better half cost    Dessert apple pie turnover whatever al mode awesome high light meal     So decent meal but nothing outstanding certainly four bills tip two dropped eat there  <EOR> Just wanted let know experience CraftSteak February 18  begin am big fan Colicchio Top Chef  No did expectations meeting know chains don't really meet actual chef  did however expectations having well cooked meal good service  Especially restaurant where owner judges other chefs things own people cannot follow through themselves     husbands anniversary my b day anniversary 2 days apart relevant seeing show  decided where would dinner since earlier plans fell through  did reservations but upon reading menu decided dinner CraftSteak  seated immediately lounge area walkway which nice people watching  Anyway busboy greeted before server but maybe standard no big deal  When server did come take drink order didn't order wine because going show didn't want any alcohol  Again no issues  But some reason different server  Again no issues  ordered dinner everything fine although little slow water soda refills  Still no issues we're picky  first course came delicious  husband shrimp cocktail quail  Both fantastic  Then steaks served  where everything downhill  husband ribeye cooked med rare  came more med side but he ate said flavorful but rosemary flavor times overpowering  also lot fat  Actually quarter $50 steak fat  hanger steak ordered rare  cooked med well  server didn't come back see if everything okay actually flag down busboy table  She said she would recooked  asked she give time frame since going show short time  She didn't this  She just brought steak left  She didn't check back again see if everything ok  steak cooked blue  rare   blue  point done  Sadly highlight dinner appetizers side item which sugar snap peas  steaks service  restaurants busy actually saw server chatting computers other server  would more forgiving if server busy  dinner $180 00 tip expected more  moon but more  Especially well known restaurant    did give 2 stars because 1st course bread good but weren't $180 good  <EOR> Ahh Tom another your restaurants tried just good think should be  don't know if am prejudiced against because top chef king just expect much your food  told daughter wish could serve your recipe similar see if could tell difference if even would yours better   I visited your heritage steak house did it  liked craftsteak lot more heritage but still wasn't wowed   I started off Caesars salad because favorite  Your version ok  Dressing wasn't great those big whole anchovies grossed out   For entree beef short ribs  very good  also ordered risotto instead potatoes wished hadn't  Risotto supposed pancetta which thought would give nice salty flavor but didn't taste all al dente point almost crunchy just didn't it   For dessert monkey bread which thought would love but hated brown sugar ice cream came because  weird aftertaste thought way many raw pecans dessert   Service great  <EOR> We ate 5 years ago wife time 2 boys   Steaks great flavorful   New York Strip medium cooked add fries cold stella artois lager incredible dinner yourself  <EOR> As Chicago resident dined just every high end steakhouse city offer know thing two expect place caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as  wife dined 09 30 B'day while Las Vegas chose steak house because both Top Chef fans thought would great way celebrate  Upon arriving seated prompt manner probably best experience all night  short HIGHLY disappointed meal experience    Our service terrible because waiter awful  use team approach but guy main person service he doesn't even belong Outback  He more once tried entertain table seated next us while engaged wife he challenged wife glass bourbon she ordered menu made bit show flipping threw 100 page drink menu table instead inquiring bar never told anything menu when asked if any chef specials night response menu printed every day think everything special   He very unprofessional he never once talked steaks menu offer!! Needless say didn't order one    The basics service never covered  even order another glass bourbon bus boy sitting without 10 minutes bad was  If going charge prices don't care if busy slow completely dead level service expected should executed on  Tom C talks all time show maybe only bad apple group but both appalled point upset it    Regarding food say overpriced  braised short ribs specialty Tom C very happy them but everything else just average  high expectations night both left restaurant bad taste mouths  <EOR> This delicious!! wait staff point always courteous attentive  Ambiance beautiful relaxing  Music little loud but fun  Also careful check bill  understandably expensive worth every penny    but did overcharge $60  sure add up! <EOR> One fantastic experience tonight  Being local town customers business wanted something different but strip   Could picked better place!  People always talk good first but people   Justin Dunia first class all way   High level attention conversation feel home part craft experience   Fantastic wines he called himself cork guy   love it   Great people great food   Live well! <EOR> I restaurant now 3 occasions  first time EXCELLENT! Wonderful service great food very enjoyable  second time also very good but friend did enjoy meal much  then last time which prompted review  details I Party 8 We ordering lots wine appetizers salads food money spend  Service terrible! never brought any bread  pour own wine whole evening would ordered more if checked us   didn't change plates between appetizers salad ask them servers barely checked us  last time came service excellent  time appalling restaurant caliber  better service Denny's!  The food just okay some lobster ordered appetizer table tough chewy just good! Extremely disappointing! steaks pretty tasty most part pretty good but no better distinguished any other steaks high end steak house   I embarrassed  such good experience before recommended place friends all serving experience dining experience place such disappointment time around  All kept thinking if Tom Colicchio knew low quality service quality some product coming he would very disappointed want name this    I recommending place again nor going back  all fine dining experiences could Vegas wasting any more money place  bad  first experience good  Look elsewhere if want fine dining experience  <EOR> Impressive selection scotch  bread serve pretty delicious  don't really eat bread stuff fat but ate whole plate warm delicious    The main reason should eat wagyu skirt steak  usually ribeye but ribeye nystrips filets etc any other steak joint   Honestly while other cuts good nothing special  certainly did place stand out  $80 bucks cut meat usually associated fajitas skeptical first  combination flavor tenderness piece meat absolutely insane  shocked good was  Incredibly rich thing oozed butter when chewed it  also great if you're really lazy don't feel cutting your steak  comes pre sliced into perfect man sized portions   Extra points bartender knows proper old fashioned  Sadly become rare sight  <EOR> 4 5 stars!

Second first two steaks came new york strip ribeye cold overcooked   When say cold dont mean warm luke warm best  it tasted if sitting counter 10min    Third overcooked steak maybe sitting counter long steak kept cooking also became cold same time  who knows way steaks came medium medium well when asked medium rare      told waiter unsatisfied steaks he took steaks back them recook without questions!  A+ waiter's part taking back steaks NO QUESTIONS ASKED   unfortunately he tried double charge bill!      also ordered sides mushrooms mashed potatoes sauteed brocolli   mashed potatoes very good!  mushrooms broccoli way salty!  t bone steak came okay but felt meat little bit tough didnt much flavor   then again hardly eat t bone   waited waited two steaks come back waiter swung couple times tell steaks would shortly  but took almost 25min steaks come back  way long opinion!  Finally steaks came back but time steaks way rare!  waiter tells he cooked rare+ which somewhere between medium rare rare    But didnt ask rare+ asked medium rare   the rare+ raw inside looked almost rare inside even cooked it cold      course point dissapointed didnt want tell waiter take back again it might taken another 20min time     decided eat side pieces meat avoid rare parts  the ribeye actually good piece meat but its hard eat rare meat    new york little chewy but could because undercooked!          Another thing add experience waiter kept dissapearing waited almost 30min check once he brought food he would dissapear 15 20min   service way slow here   we even asked other waitress check but she insisted waiter would shortly          Overall place failed deliver quality steaks service   service slow kept waiting food check which very unhappy customer   steaks ordered weren't recommended menu maybe thats why didnt turn good but i'd expect quality food whole menu!   chefs really need learn time entrees all food should come once   steak also needs cooked right which chefs failed do!             Ohh last point when sent back steaks waiter tried bill twice both steaks notice'd double charge bill  pretty shady waiter!  He tried play dumb when told but obvious he tried double charge no reason   bad food service overall!  But maybe its because didnt order tasting menu which 100+ per person  <EOR> The food rich music loud   some friends visiting abroad unable hold conversation   dark ask flashlight illuminate menu   didn't finally used light phones   detest eating low lights when can't see what's your plate  asked server Manager several times please turn down music couldn't even hear person other end table talk   Dinner old friends should enjoyable experience especially catching but impossible   wouldn't again if paid waste evening  <EOR> Been quite while since ate but won't forget good way  birthday hubby treated James Taylor concert dinner  Now must say top chef fan day but just cannot even  deal tom horrible experience place!

Ironically serve HUGE PORTIONS everything else  really way much food    They focus quantity over quality reals   Other food service great ambiance kinda cool   not expecting though  If you're looking romantic fancy steakhouse type place date special occasion   try somewhere else  I'd recommend Craftsteak groups portions HUGE pretty casual pretentious all  <EOR> I don't normally enjoy high end steak but along bachelor party  generally think steak restaurants wildly overpriced  still overpriced but quality cuts seem worth it  side dishes fantastic drinks also prepared perfection  2lb porterhouse took high pleasure devouring all  If bunch money spend dinner want steak don't see could satisfied here  <EOR> We eat last week  Second time me  time steaks hot   When shared them No apologies just OK take take them Back warm them   Second time around still hot !

Just there  Came Saturday night friends could believe nice restaurant was  decor very nice bright dark  sat table right front arrangement pumpkins which made nice background group picture    We ordered three side dishes baby spinach baby shitake mushrooms roasted garlic leek gratin potatoes  didn't try any spinach but other two really good  also shared between four 16 oz  rib eye 10 oz  filet mignon since gone buffet lunch  Hmm   rib eye good! filet mignon really tender center but side little dry otherwise would better  Plus lacked little bit flavor  didn't order any dessert since all full  = think next time save room chocolate souffle! <EOR> one best steakhouses ever eaten at  if you're going group 4 money no object i'd suggest doing kobe tasting menu  3 courses but amount food generous  especially desserts  personally don't think upgrade surf turf worth it  unless 2 pound lobster tail sea scallops  sometimes prawns crab legs surf options little rich because butter poaching  favorite thing menu kobe skirt  also if your whiskey rocks restaurant icemaker 2 1 2 square inch cube  <EOR> For high end steakhouse especially owned operated such well known chef wife expected far far far better     Our evening started off well very warm reception hostesses   greeted name shown table almost immediately   Once table two servers greeted took tour menu very nice explanations various options available us   took water bar order left study menus bit more   until then still very happy restaurant choice evening  The martinis bar well done   said no drink worth $16 charged them   Then again Vegas all came no surprise paying Singapore type pricing drinks   Now steak most disappointing part experience STEAK HOUSE   Even though prepared pay high dollar meal certainly weren't prepared pay prices Japanese American Wagyu options hundreds per steak    opted Prime bone in ribeye filet options thinking Prime designation certainly enough guarantee solid quality aside quality expectation Colicchio's name alone    case     I ordered bone in ribeye medium rare wife ordered filet medium well she's pregnant unfortunately can't order meat far rare side    When steaks came ribeye cooked well done wife's filet essentially rare   If kitchen simply made mistake applying right temperatures wrong cuts could let since she could just switched steaks   However kitchen completely missed mark temperatures what's worse served pregnant wife rare steak   sent both steaks back kitchen where ultimately provide all new ribeye replace original overcooked piece shoe leather re fired wife's bring proper temperature   disappointment didn't end however once both wife started cutting chewing found meat incredibly tough dry full gristle   All characteristics no one would expect find cuts meat     How did Craftsteak team respond experience?  acknowledged poor showing Ray Charles Stevie Wonder back kitchen server's words ours provided complimentary serving Monkey Bread presented full $250 bill   This whole experience just emphasized often easier find proper cuts meat cook home experience on par if better most steak houses fraction price   week following experience Craftsteak Costco where picked two Prime ribeyes total $40 cooked them perfection far better steak experience comfort own home proper temps tender savory flavorful   <EOR> My overall experience would 3stars five  because food service  sides appetizers decent but steak under cooked worth price  However some sides Luke warm which awful disgrace greatness could been  service great except lack communication  fairly excited come but honestly wasn't worth it  way if decide ignore review potato purée fairly good charcuterie excellent  <EOR> I believe 4 years ago when friends started take eating seriously   Vegas New Year's celebration a tradition wanted eat nice place   late making reservations any nice places but Craftsteak said if came opening 5 pm could seat right away   am happy ended night   experience every positive heavenly descriptive word possible   all participated chef's tasting menu  uber expensive but well worth it   plethora meats beef pig poultry etc side dishes spinach mushrooms onions etc appetizers desserts   end stuffed gills but omg really aaaaaaaaawesome   second time kobe tasting menu  YUUUUUUM!!!!

Should punched myself face mistake   Either way everything freaking delicious  strength meal came steaks scallops sides  Perfectly cooked medium rare  appetizers good but comprised nothing cooked harder appreciate dishes came various marinades dressings we shaved fennel salad cucumber watercress salad buffalo mozzarella proscuitto figs   would've appreciated roast quail but night  Dessert good sorbet girl loved peach chocolate sorbet  Tasted cocoa ice cream without ice cream texture don't like  also molten chocolate cake monkey bread which bf loved   Portions HUGE  could've fed least 3 ppl food received   Service great  waiters weren't snobby all even though bf youngest kids there  little annoyed kept referring Wagyu beef Kobe   because its same thing  But lead waiter even recommended cheaper tasting menu fit tastes better instead recommending more expensive would result bigger bill   Why star off? I'd see better appetizer tasting menu got  Also really thought food good but bill came $275 two people we split 3 glasses champagne which thought hefty food plain idea execution super innovative unique  think if paid Restaurant Week prices I'd little happier but all all great meal  <EOR> Holy cow!

Overall Would recommend beef here   Come coffee dessert instead! <EOR> For much watching Tom critique Top Chef contestants would think food restaurant serves would completely point  don't think anything bad but paying $300 don't think anything particularly good either    First little weird people dressed t shirts shorts dinner guess  Craftsteak's fault because Vegas everyone does please    The wine bottles especially marked which really annoys me  know  money build Tom's fortune pay dome wax but really puts off    The food mediocre  filet asked medium medium well parts medium rare rest  Plus needed lot more seasoning! does Tom say? Simple salt pepper! brussel sprouts potato gratin slightly better seasoned but still needed lot more flavor memorable  desserts sorbets very good but carrot cake bummer    Take advice Mesa Grill instead! <EOR> Amazing food + amazing service    what's love???  The hubs Christmas dinner    raving bread bring your table    Freshly baked    buttery    sprinkle salt top   He thought exaggerating   He looked crazy   He said Ok    Ok    condescending manner which he responds all crazies   Then he took bite   I win   Again   The rest food amazing well but when meal kicks off start this    rest review just writes itself  <EOR> I just died heaven  service great ambiance = perfection  filet mignon = die for!! boyfriend also enjoyed rib eye  Sides nothing write home puréed potatoes asparagus risotto but all delish  would back heart beat! <EOR> I wanted love place but did really enjoy experience here  But let explain    First all place just oozes class manages impeccable attentive service without straying into stuffy type service feel uncomfortable see review Alexander's Steakhouse San Francisco   nothing but gracious wonderful service throughout meal  would give 5 stars that  food however disappointment me  big part just personal reasons  trouble chewing due previous jaw surgery vegetables cooked lightly still crunchy  While might great someone looking vegetable fresh tastes just pulled ground but prefer things cooked just little more tender actually chew them  Even hubby found them hard  flavor nice but needs little more time stove IMO  Hubby's steak good cooked he ordered it  ordered scallops  disappointed flavor scallops  arrived half dozen scallops took bite first just tasted fishy  Fishy doesn't even begin describe it  actually almost made little sick  Now happen before where bad bunch and don't fault chef think just luck draw harvest tried little bite four them only found tasted fresh palatable just ate one  Unfortunately no hiding fact didn't eat dish server asked admit didn't it  wasn't expecting anything because don't think anything cooked but he took off bill anyway  thought very nice  Overall think if crunchy vegetables want stick steak then probably love place  also lovely quiet respite noise casino floor  forget where while dining place  if  you're looking then would recommend try place  <EOR> I pretty much just best steak entire freakin life   Came bf's birthday  Weren't quite sure order domestic wagyu surf turf which came lobster bisque 3 choices salad new york strip ribeye 3 choices sidedishes dessert all $160 per person    Lobster bisque Took sip transported heaaavvveeennn!!! bisque just creamy smooth little bits lobster meat also think slight hint curry? knows  cares  freakin delicious    Salad Caesar market spinach wild arugula  Caesar your typical caesar anchovy   interesting but tasty  market spinach would favorite  thought port wine really complemented spinach apples walnuts  wild arugula alright guess   nothing special    New York Strip Ribeye Honestly baby could eaten this  Why? Because its melt in your mouth steak  First bite probably only chew 2 3 times  Yes  good  Between two would favor new york strip just because probably less chewy  Both done medium rare   Sides Baby spinach Mushroom assortment potato puree  yum yum triple yum!

Everything delicious  probably best steak house food ever including only melt in your mouth amazing filet mignon but knock your socks off sides roasted corn creamy mashed potatoes mixed mushrooms  and service impeccable but reflection wish they'd given slightly less food charged slightly less money  When food expensive and yummy really want eat all but no should really eat much meal even if Tom Colicchio  <EOR> Impeccable service   Extremely personalized   visibly obvious server took immense pride job understanding menu   appreciate that   food cooked perfectly seasoned excellently   Service throughout awesome   Its expensive but wonderful experience   clients impressed <EOR> Worth every penny   I group 6 did prix fix menu  AMAZING  served family style try 6 apps salads all delicious then 6 meat 6 sides all truly delectable  almost didn't know when 6 desserts came out  All amazing  loved ability taste little everything glad did braised short ribs top favorite dish none would tried this    The server busboys all helpful friendly quite lot questions menu ingredients which answered all smile     Wonderful!

As critical Tom Colicchio Top Chef hard find anything dislike restaurant    Unlike some Vegas restaurants atmosphere feel if you've truly escaped casino madness entered another world  service top notch food outstanding  wine list overwhelming but if look around find decent bottle under $100    For appetizers ordered oysters fantastic! yellowtail hamachi very fresh although citrus did overpower fish bit lobster bisque absolutely perfect ordered share table brought four small cups nice touch    I wagyu skirtsteak far best skirtsteak ever eaten  yukon potatoes amazing fries perfect   For dessert highly recommend monkeybread amazing pecan brown sugar ice cream refreshing  huge chocolate fan but dish far superior chocolate tart ordered which came maple bacon ice cream didn't care love bacon!    Overall best meals long time  Did mention bisque?  Five stars huge fan! <EOR> Well others said VERY disappointing experience   SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!  I love Tom wanting come since heard he restaurant Vegas   However service awful   Others said well   waiter took forever come over take drink order forever come back take food order practically flag down throughout meal whenever need anything don't know pesky refill   Pissed off really because usual dining alone felt being ignored somewhat reason   don't think you'll big tip?  Because noticed he really friendly some more populated tables   Plus relatively early dinner reservation no reason take hundred years return check since restaurant full when there   Anyway addition service highly disappointed food overall   ordered Wagyu filet think   might Kobe filet mignon   See  evidence right terrible because LOVE cow can't even remember ate here   All know filet since  all order $125 10 ounces la carte   Now ordered well done may part problem because other posts mentioned getting steak medium medium rare doneness   understand preserve taste meat way especially really expensive cuts but personally prefer hear Moo's dinner walking off plate sticking fully cooked   mark great steakhouse whether properly cook steak well done leave juicy case filet mignon feel butterflying cheating   But digress   ordered damn steak well done sucked bigtime   kept wanting ask A1 steak sauce all night but fought urge since seemed inappropriate slather such nice piece meat sauce  However when room later saw 6 ounces steak leftovers remaining silently kicked myself grabbing some A1 cafe downstairs hotel      In addition dreadful steak possibly worst accompanying side dish EVER   am speaking Tuscan Kale capitalized because its notoriety   Ordinarily love kale especially love bacon   mean could wrong here?

Did split dessert?? No  Did two desserts?? Nope! served THREE desserts   and all great  monkey bread which very warm fresh  Next panacotta sp strawberry sorbet     absolutely great! then basil sorbet just it    sounds weird but VERY refreshing!! smores ice cream  best part  added meal purchased everything al carte including drinks meal came $400 BEFORE tax tip  However because did Chef Selection bill $410 tax tip     saved roughly $80!! may while before wallet recovers able return Craftsteak but bet your rear end recommending hell place until then!!! <EOR> My husband great time Craftsteak   steak deliciously tender side dishes excellent   rolls sweet potatoes highlight meal actually good overshadowed steak bit    also ordered au gratin potatoes mushrooms  they good but would pass them repeat visit because simply much food     TIPS Call ahead ask semi private booths   booths VERY nice some dining room seating looked crowded loud   bar seating looked pretty bad   booth loved but wouldn't happy paying $150 per person sit loud bar  It LOT food  portions large very satisfying   am big carnivore usually no problem polishing off salad steak baked potato bread  but place left stuffed   would fine each getting steak splitting side dish  I love wine but would recommend skipping wine going two specialty cocktails   only cocktails delicious but more bang your buck them   cocktails come shaker  so more just one    normally order wine but thought bottles tad over priced were  <EOR> Overall 5 Star experience  only thing could knock down would terribly overpriced  dinner comped casino wasn't factor experience   Before started $410 dinner two must begin service  flawless actually mean literally  cousin watched busboys measuring distance between chairs while preparing tables next guests   I started glass Malbec  server gives small pour directly bottle sure your standards  glad because terrible  waiter suggested Cabernet its place  excellent however would feel badly turning down second glass anyhow    I started lobster bisque  mentioned other reviews served bowl many large chunks lobster  bisque poured over meat table side  Best lobster bisque life   at $18 should be  cousin Kobe tartar  thing but he said excellent  also shared sea scallops  Cooked perfectly tasted excellent   For main course 18 oz rib eye bone cousin filet  really wanted side lobster but don't offer split 2 5 pound Maine lobster entree   back minute  know getting redundant but steak order medium rare plus dead on  don't know did but perfect  compare all fine steaks favorite Mastro's  Mastro's still number but close second   excellent marbling flavor aroma  filet looked great well received cousin  lobster presented shelled light cream chanterelle sauce  good but minds charging $70 it   The sides average above average  enjoyed potatoes au gratin asparagus baby shitakes   My cousin finished off cheesecake he really enjoyed   No complaints here  evening flawless free minus tip thanks MGM no more overpriced every other restaurant there  <EOR> Went 8 28 2016   In sentence thought very good but but few things could improved imo  First off mention website doesn't list any price  day age hard justify   I myself  sat table where side chair other side couch  sat couch find actually uncomfortable kinda deep no good back support   Sitting chair meant facing white wall sucked stayed couch  Take those couches away Tom they're terrible   To begin heirloom tomato salad  Just array heirloom tomatoes olive oil  pretty good   I ordered domestic ribeye wagyu  phenomenal cook perfectly   The first side mushroom assortment  perfect steak   The second side peppers onions  pretty disappointing  guess expected roasted peppers but super crunchy slides pepper  Crunchy because skin which isn't great  wasn't much onion found dish   Another problem portion sizes  They're way big  heirloom tomato salad supposed appetizer actually meal itself  stop halfway could enjoy main course later  sides also enormous  Combined 14oz boneless ribeye steak truly beyond capacity and overweight take lot   managed finish steak but nothing else   Lastly took Duckhorn Vineyards wine pairing option $75  basically 3 reds two cabs merlot   think overpriced  first wine Decoy cabernet sauvignon rough wine  other wines better but nothing spectacular  Finally wish sommelier would shared tasting notes me   Service excellent   So overall pretty good but there's work do  If restaurant somewhere else Las Vegas would given 4 stars but Vegas tons amazing food options within small radius takes lot stand out  <EOR> Rained Parade  We really looking forward delicious meal unique ambience Craftsteak  But alas unfortunately wasn't experience    Let's begin two highlights first busboy George Wagyu Skirt Steak  Both incredible    George pleasant lightning fast Skirt Steak seared roasted beautifully  Moist buttery full bodied seasoning  honestly no idea Skirt Steak could transformed into something spectacular    We waited quite some time waiter   and rolls which mediocre best girl knows fantastic yeasty roll when she sees wraps lips around one  4     Then more time passed before waiter eventually came back take order answer some menu questions  When ultimately able speak really more akin yelling  loud restaurant say least    Tip If loud fantastic steak fantasies yours I'd skip Craftsteak head over STK    For Sides Mushroom Medley which beautiful behold but lacking any type enhancing flavor additions such garlic butter perhaps bit salt   We also Yukon Potato Purée  nice full fat mouthfeel but tended toward gummy side  potatoes certainly didn't blow minds float parade hoped    For now Au Revoir Craftsteak! Perhaps meat pun intended again! <EOR> Went Craft drinks prior dinner L'Atelier  Empty restaurant easily could reservation 5  Would allow sit lounge hour meet guest    After making reservation hosted informed could sit ordering full meal   Disappointed  <EOR> Craftsteak high end American Steakhouse all fancy i e  Wagu beef options would expect find such establishment today   quite stuffy some other high end steak houses visited throughout great country but still upscale     friends both surf turf thoroughly enjoyed meal  steaks cooked temp    Upon recommendation waiter I undecided wanted tried braised veal octopus combination    promised veal fantastic however octopus tad over cooked chewy     Appetizers spot on  doesn't love cooked egg salad?

Reservations seem fill quickly especially pre theater folks would suggest trying them early   ended having 5 30pm reservation Saturday when finally found restaurant maze like MGM confused because EMPTY   shrug  The menu changed printed daily based produce available day   non steak options but comes steak restaurant doesn't order steak!?  I raspberry martini brought mini shaker poured table side  really refreshing but touch sweet     After looking pictures dinner rolls Yelp couldn't wait server bring them out   don't know put rolls but they're seriously addicting   They're baked kitchen served hot mini cast iron pan clarified butter sea salt top   FREAKIN GOOD!!!  bf polished off first 6 secretly hoping would bring more BAM! 6 more appeared table I took those bad boys go!    decided split kobe beef tartare appetizer  served crostini raw quail egg really yummy flavored perfectly   bf decided ribeye surf turf filet choice prawns    Both steaks cooked perfect doneness tender   side roasted fingerling potatoes really good sized portion splitting delicious!    Normally stuffed can't possibly eat dessert but managed some room   Craftsteak's monkeybread banana ice cream most popular dessert menu good reason   good!!!  found myself really savoring each bite   banana ice cream perfect sweetness balance monkeybread   Service point as should be    Very friendly knowledgable servers   Yes meal definately put dent bank account but still full thinking those freakin delicious rolls! Tom Colicchio if you're reading recipe???? <EOR> We great experience  rolls die for  Steak flavorful nearly fork tender  recommended Craftsteak many friends all them enjoyed much did! <EOR> Craft steak flawless every way   arrived party 10 mins early just case wait   sat noticed interior perfectly classic steak house wood everything   Dark oaks redwoods even pine   Aw faint smell wood finish unmistakable wonderful when sit down hearty meal   just something smell pine oak 12oz steak   Our server came over promptly introduced himself   Charm filled room every wait staff smile ear ear    Floor manager came over next   all dressed business attire casual wear nothing special all   all 110 degrees outside some shorts   None stopped coming over    He just came over introduce himself sure everything liking    We started meal artisan breads  favorite table kalamata rosemary bread  Wonderfully salty airy perfect way drink 2 more cocktails each   good restaurateur understand need sale through cocktails good way salty snacks New York strip Natural Ju Thyme    came sliced into perfect  inch cubes  inch fat cap still attached   All could think thank god kept fat there   side roasted mushrooms steak  sucker when comes mushrooms especially when prepared simple possible  simply pan roasted clarified      also known liquid gold   All All experience atmosphere food service 5 but when into place expect nothing less then perfect evening  <EOR> I've lot amazing steakhouses Las Vegas   Craftsteak just didn't me  served bad food other serving medium steak when ordered medium rare just price point $200 person should absolutely exceptional everything just average    The only real plus place noise level wasn't over top could conduct little business during meal without effort  <EOR> Very fancy steakhouse located MGM Grand  heard legendary lobster bisque made plans dine Craftsteak during next trip Las Vegas   The restaurant very nice servers extremely attentive  ordered lobster bisque start incredible  Fresh chunks lobster meat drowned creamy delightfully complex bisque  Every spoonful delicious initial flavor aftertaste  sure exactly bisque but seasoned beautifully  Easily best lobster bisque ever tasted   The Caesar salad picked anchovies quite good   The steak also very good  ordered Double R t bone cooked perfectly  Definitely sous vide steak charred nicely outside uniform medium rare doneness inside  wasn't crazy slightly sweet sauce accompanied steak  Other fantastic   Overall fantastic steakhouse  steaks great but opinion lobster bisque overshadows beef  Come ready eat ready drop some dough! <EOR> Craftsteak must when Vegas  If you're lobster scallops kinda girl then try seafood trio regret it! <EOR> If going call yourself world class steakhouse then your steak better amazing  Unfortunately true Craftsteak  2 friends came girl's night ordered 3 steaks 3 sides  all shared   Filet disappointing  Dry! ordered medium rare  better 3 star places  Hangar steak very good only any liked  Still nothing inspire return trip itself  Third steak also just flat flavorless  Can't even recall now  If recall just tell avoid    You know excellent though? sides  Brentwood corn Fiddlehead fern special sides potato dish menu staple  first two life altering great promised server   advice vegetarian meal special sides recommended your server love skip steak  Service very good course  Place looks very Vegas hotel course clean  such huge restaurant nice table wasn't noisy any way  <EOR> My wife dinner last month   both Top Chef fans looking forward trying place some time     I feel led astray good reviews place   service ok   wife thought very attentive grown impatient end meal   She pointed server really only twice during meal when food arrived end maybe she right   I think best part start   rolls fabulous   give them that   Really delicious   started lobster bisque which also very good   would recommend that   But then main course   recommendation skirt steak   Now know skirt steak different texture but thought mine extremely tough   really didn't enjoy frankly spit few bites out   wouldn't again nor would recommend many others do   overheard woman seated next table over also complain tough steak was   don't think anomaly   Maybe both bad cuts don't know      My wife rib eye   tried bite definitely liked better skirt steak   But wife thought just so so nothing great   sauce served steak very good though   probably only saving grace   would happier different steak think   I wanted try souffle dessert but just wasn't end meal   wife shared some chocolate sorbet   good but just sorbet   We both disappointed meal decided would back   place lot hype behind but frankly much better steaks meals chain type steakhouses   instance repeatedly gone Smith Wollensky Vegas never gone away disappointed   many choices Vegas superior based experience  <EOR> After scoping Yelp decided would fancy Vegas dinner   While dressed other people just wearing T shirts   Par course city   The place big warmly decorated dimly lit   Once pass bar televisions enter main dining room   Our server great   older friendly talkative guy   He told menu changes every day depending produce supplier buys morning California   You start complimentary hot buttered salted rolls skillet   outstanding   I ordered 16 oz  New York strip steak grilled   massive piece meat   ordered medium rare but came entirely pink   server picked steak summoned new one   Unfortunately meant girl would eat while waited   When new steak seemed closer medium rare but straight cold middle   wanting wait third steak just ate it   Fairly middle of the road   For sides ordered Maui Onions which girlfriend loved   nice addition any fork full steak   also ordered Potato Gratin   Sadly tasted fairly bland   needed salt bring them par   Another deduction photographer came around snap several pictures us   15 minutes later she returned books photos she tried sell something $130   didn't see snapping pictures any other couples   Nothing having shoot down sales pitch middle fancy dinner   While liked atmosphere server food fell short   really wish I'd enjoyed more  <EOR> This five star restaurant review feels like  while  Nice reacquainted   So let set up  visited CraftSteak NYC few years ago lunch but burger while very good didn't rushing back partly because so many options NYC plus closed way Collichio Sons high list    Flash forward Vegas  Even though buffet mecca celebrity chef restaurants top list there  when buddy Big J regular invited join Adam Pimp instantly said hell yeah time    The place full when arrived 6pm but totally filled 8pm when left following quick tour kitchen meeting head chef Matt Seeber Colicchio btw   those two hours Top 10 dining experiences   Craftsteak produced far best damn lobster bisque steak had  bisque several plump lobster chunks those little bits often flavor exceptional  don't excited soup  special    But real star 12 oz  Wagyu Skirt Steak  Served medium rare first bite rediscovered special happy place great steak transports but something different time  kept eating realized I'd steak delicious before  even closed eyes few times shut key senses focus more intensively taste  Pimpski also ordered skirt steak concurred steak apex  Big J going town surf turf but recommended skirt we'll call unanimous along many other reviewers     The sides also fantastic  Loved Yukon gold puree potatoes asparagus but all agreed braised Brussels sprouts smoked bacon standout      Dessert didn't miss either  monkey bread gets lot love but tried new bread pudding wasn't menu yet lobster bisque stood apart every other version classic  much lighter most perfect ending meal   That service uniformly excellent throughout didn't seem anything friend being regular  Looking around surrounding tables booths servers constantly moving bringing dishes right time refilling water drinks asking things just table  Combined overall ambiance service created very welcoming comfortable atmosphere    Others touched prices which also menu should already know you're but add just dollar amount but total value

Give them shot if you're Vegas!  full skipped dessert  <EOR> Overdue review dinner 2 weeks ago  Vegas trip buddy's bachelor party  staying MGM restaurant easy pick since didn't leave hotel!  Craftsteak very spacious hip Sheik restaurant  Dim lights warm earthy colors throughout  table side rooms  great gathering friends very hungry full day adventures !  Took look wine menu all bottles $100+ range except two reds @ $65   think seen them $15 but then Vegas go  old fashioned candy Bullet bourbon $12    steak menu impressive wanted fatty steak absorb mayhem cocktails   Ordered 22 oz T Bone @ $58 able eat half shared rest table  sides ordered Cauliflower tasty can't remember rest group ordered    Great service 3 4 people serving replenishing drinks taking photos us    Steaks great super busy noisy overpriced but job done   <EOR> You honestly don't even need read review but instead just know experience Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak best ever had anywhere   Star 1 service atmosphere?  Quick knowledgeable even though place absolutely packed Friday night  No complaints here  Star Granted   Star 2 portions relative cost?  This tough considering party essentially ordered all you can eat four course feast  put acceptable price all you can eat dining highest quality? No but Craftsteak decided amounted $200 per person including drinks   high  Very high but only Vegas but restaurant inside hotel let alone MGM  completely honest? usually sticker when comes overpriced luxury food but good can't complain  Vegas treat yourself  Star Granted   Stars 3 4 food?  I first say no appreciation whatsoever fine dining especially when comes steak but some best food ever had  fantastic rolls appetizers ranging peppers prawns meal made even better various cuts meat breathtaking dessert  Dual Stars Granted   Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  I would without question eat every day if could afford but pump breaks just because end day really overpaying based atmosphere high price point set Vegas dining  No Star Granted  <EOR> I'm huge Top Chef fan eager try Craftsteak  hit miss   mostly miss  They start off hot out of the oven parker house rolls topped butter sea salt  excellent  The organic lettuce salad lemon vinaigrette wonderful  fresh very refreshing  Just perfect  Hubby Angus bone in NY Strip  actually tough didn't taste mouthfeel prime meat all  I Angus bone in Ribeye  tasty but also did seem prime  also unevenly cut thinner parts overcooked  I found ironic based often Tom judged people poorly butchered meat! steaks arrive copper skillet swimming demi glace  nice way serve but thyme because herb permeates steak cippolini onion served it  Our sides french fries excellent   homemade crispy brussels sprouts bacon  half sprouts well done caramelized making them delicious  other half looked tasted though steamed bit inconsistency well  We finished something called Chocolate Decadence which very good all  looked tasted something you'd find your high end grocery store bakery case  But consistency gloppy also chocolate nibs throughout making terrible crunchy texture random areas didn't seem intentional  chewing bebes  desert didn't fit feel restaurant certainly worth $15  We back Craftsteak  <EOR> Things Vegas changed people gambling much EVERYTHING gone must admit did experience Sticker Shock number places   place worst example felt Value just there   Food OK dessert better main entrees service Poor  party six Tip added $186 00 dude should stood next table entire night absentee waiter  see no reason back None  <EOR> I picked place romantic dinner first night Vegas together   only planned going fancy dinner did lots reviewing yelp pick someplace great deciding Craftsteak much  deliberation   decision somewhat swayed fact big fan Top Chef some may know head judge Tom Collichio executive chef place   Well think Mr  Tom may need pack knives go     I totally disappointed food   ordered surf n' turf tasting menu which something $175 each three courses wine pairings  started off some kind steak tartare which impressive   bad but tasted very strongly garlic no delicacy flavor   special   Then came steak lobster selection side dishes   skirt steak fillet both Kobe beef well cooked suppose but anything better bbq'd home   especially tender especially well seasoned   good amount lobster but rubbery took some messy work half shell  sides included pomme puree aka mashed potatoes sauteed mushrooms grilled asparagus   Seriously   order fancy tasting menu expecting best chef offer he sends friggin' mashed potatoes?  special?  best offer? dessert some kind chocolate cake selection sorbets one which red bull flavored   Seriously?  Red bull nasty flavor only slightly improved vodka wine paired steak good   other two unremarkable dessert wine paired chocolate cake some kind Sauternes which consider inappropriate choice chocolate   late harvest Zin port some sherry would much better     As you've probably gathered completely unimpressed   type complain management such things which why venting all here  thank yelp When pay top dollar tasting menu expect something really special high quality creative   none above   felt seriously ripped off pist off when leaving place feelings subsided   If Tom judging meal think he would agree   He needs check people running place because they're ruining good name   If you're looking interesting delicious tasting menu excellent Chefs Vegas choose someone else! <EOR> Try place few years ago magnificent!!!!!  3 course dinner wine parings  Everything's great start bread butter then some appetizer don't recall name Shrimp dish tomatoes dish  Anchovies Caesar salad Wagyu steak sweet corn asparagus Cinnamon monkey bread!!!! Wine pairings perfect every dishes!!! Looking forward back place again  <EOR> This place such disappointment  love top chef very high expectations  steak but wanted something else too  new york strip fun  salmon atrocious  said olive relish but came totally plain unseasoned  asked said olives broth  seriously doubt since no broth  Also asked ignored remainder meal  worth money  <EOR> Although Craftsteak serves pretty good steak suffers comparison more lively interesting spaces Las Vegas SW Steakhouse Mesa Grill   no complaints food but when you've eaten high end steakhouses many years bar gets raised look something set restaurant apart didn't find Craftsteak   Again won't disappointed food but if you're Vegas weekend why somewhere more fun? <EOR> I must say great deal   sure Summer Menu when don't eat days before just stomach all in!  For full review great photos everything served http www kats9lives com 2008 09 greatly surprised cant beat price html  I break down simply liked   sure reservations before just case convention going on   Heck kidding   Vegas ALWAYS convention going on   =P  Summer Menu First Course    Roasted Red Peppers = so so good flavor *just reminder am Meatatarian*   Persian Cucumber Watercress Salad = so so fresh   Grilled Quail = SIMPLY FABULOUS Second Course   Kobe Sirloin = good but needed more flavoring    meat okay but really wish could paid more filet mignon   Roasted Chicken = goodI guess needed more flavor well   Diver Sea Scallops = cooked well flavor fine Dessert   4 Ice Cream = flavors lacking really icy   Warm Fruit Crisp = so so crust could lot better   Cinnamon Monkey Bread = bad sauce good Extra Appetizers ordered      Wagyu Beef Tartare = soft texture flavorful   Seared Foie Gras = good size flavor bad   Okay $60 dollars per person 4 courses 3 items each course   12 course meal! great deal! really didn't need extra appetizers because stuffed   just much food incredible   Maybe because group two?  Still tons food great   definitely back again if never tried then should really go!  I watched Top Chef when first came really questioned if Tom Colicchio knew anything food   Now give props   When NY restaurants didn't look tempting but now mind changed     If looking more people party 4 better tasting menus give call there! ^_^ <EOR> Most unpleasant dinner ever had!

craftsteak   and desserts tad bit sweet <EOR> I many years ago seemed recall being standout but last trip told different story  Overpriced decidedly mediocre steak done chef's choice assuming wouldn't roasted maximum heat containment but boy tough piece overdone meat  quickly recovered better average service new  piece meat but despite better cook temperature meat itself par pricetag  many good options Vegas settle mediocre meal  <EOR> It's tradition birthday husband takes restaurant  surprise somewhere never before  When he revealed taking Craftsteak he prefaced lengthy justification mainly centered fact yes Craftsteak steakhouse but impressive assortment vegetable options  disappointed   The menu changes daily apparently does lots veggie options though most them garnished some manner pork products if you're strictly vegetarian your place     When sat down brought cast iron pan most delicious dinner rolls  fluffy light yeasty but impossibly buttery sprinkle salt top  felt little ridiculous putting butter mine but did anyway  yeasty buttery rolls sprinkle salt top  We ordered Billionaire Cocktail Booker's Bourbon lemon juice simple syrup dash grenadine star anise Cucumber Gin Martini Hendricks Gin cucumber fresh lime sour   Both delicious   sweeter normally but unbalanced  bring martini glass garnish table then individual shaker cocktail separately  shakers roughly 1 3 martinis   The Bibb salad generous portion beautiful smoky crisp pickled onion chives blue cheese lardons  perfet share   We thiknking skipping entrees altogether just loading all tempting sides but husband insisted ridiculous European Sea Bass beurre blanc chives pile sauteed Napa cabbage shiitake mushrooms piece crispy pancetta top   fish well cooked flaky sauce complemented without overpowering   I particularly excited mushrooms  you order several different varieties Mushroom Assortment  planning assortment but many other things wanted try  glad didn't   the Hen Woods tasy but impressive  NB If want amazing mushrooms Thomas Keller restaurant  Since birthday ordered few things normally would compromised but turned husband enjoyed them  kale Maui onions  kale cooked brink death studded cannelini beans lardons  more Southern greens preparation delicious   smoky bacon y    The Maui onions cut half roasted Minus 8 Vinegar made ice wine   perfectly tender sweet  Delicious  The butternut risotto good but expected more flavorful especially scallions proscuitto    The service really good all night until very end when wait little while bill   Overall highly enjoyable meal

But really compared food scene Vegas 10 years ago place could considered fantastic    But did say could  here's beef ha ha it? dessert  remember because just seemed off  monkey bread caramel sauce the bread golden enough fact looked kinda anemic darkly lit dining room molten chocolate cake ho hum might well gotten vanilla creme brulee sorbet gelato quartet no fireworks sliced Asian pear that's right sliced even nicely sliced seeds still it  no wasn't even poached   Something definitely fell short kitchen   My other beef service biggest pet peeve  usually servers welcome give menu talk completely sell experience have  your order your drinks even next door another restaurant bottle sake because don't carry any once drop entrees main event black hole suddenly appears middle dining room  Where did server go? oops bad just illusion  kinda looks but he keeps disappearing acting uninterested can't him  advice servers follow through your diners man  could made bad dessert experience if even bothered check if wanted coffee!   So sad say good bad experience would loved give place 4 stars because beef just amazing  place definitely suffered bad service  Despite fact guy nice enough next door some sake  <EOR> We pleasure dining CraftSteak Christmas night! first time dining experience certainly lived reputation Chef Tom Collichio!

seasoned well   bordelaise sauce served steaks paired very well meat   also shared few side dishes standouts mind risotto brussel sprouts   really enjoyed all meals restaurant steak Vegas  <EOR> Final Decision new favorite beef WAYGU  So long awaited trip Vegas check spot since explored sister restaurants Craft Los Angeles last holiday season food tremendous expectations high met destroyed Rambo part deux   wanted try steaks possibly two side items dessert but enticed three course Waygu beef meal     So think would appetizer salad main dish side single dessert well much yourself thought wrong   See following   Service superb   although waiter combo very heavy latin accent both hard time figuring describing menu   But winner various selection food coming 3 course meal   Funny thing waiter glasses resting end nose girl wanted flick back bridge    Decor dim roomy wine racks line false wall look little chutes leather panels probably straight cow's back talk using full cow    Food served Appetizers Buffalo Mozzarella spicy fresh very nice start meal light olive oil vinegrette surrounding hefty slices mozzarella diced tomatoes   Avocado Salad unique side wedges soft avocado other tangy noodle like veggie lightly dressed very refreshing something never thought putting together   Romaine leaves long uncut romaine leaved served caesar salad style topped anchovies yes anchovies those things pizza didn't touch them myself since dislike them just much do    Pacific Coast Prawns probably most finely prepared crustaceans long while   grilled lightly seasoned some salt pepper possibly some butter some smokey spices chives finger licking good if even proper do   cocktail sauce which seemed moot since flavor prawns delectable all itself   Main Course Rib eye Filet tender juicy flavorful probably two most tasty pieces steaks ever tasted   truly understand why pieces meat sought after   Lightly seasoned cooked refine red wine herb sauce nice complement steak   Yukon Gold Puree silky smooth your prototypical mash each spoonful its almost taking bite sour cream onion potato chip     Roasted Asparagus nicely roasted seasoned well  Soft flavorful   Can't mess dish up   Assorted Mushrooms baby shiitake shimeji hen woods all very tasty grilled well small copper skillet   admit ones prepared Craft restaurant more memorable delicious comparison spot    Dessert Cinnamon Monkey Bread basic cinnamon pullaway pecan toffee ice cream interesting dessert but ice cream winner plate though little overwhelming flavor   Chocolate Ganache Cake cocoa nibs filled inside choco cake making almost molten when cutting open partnered some sweet whip cream    Season sorbet lemon strawberry sorbet some fresh black berries strawberries black cherries   nice third option very light almost palate cleansing dish    The meal delicious definitely changed perspective steaks   already dreaming next trip restaurant  <EOR> I spent same $$$ place did L'atelier seven times amount food  course really fact steaks knock your socks off good  Kobe menu which means two people share two kobe steaks filet mignon skirt steak 3 sides 3 apps 3 desserts  Way way much food actually freaking ask

Negatives 1 Wines heavily overpriced marked seems quite bit over industry standard   matters worse charge exorbitant $50 corkage fee bringing your own wine restaurant   Although digging through wine list certainly find wines local store when added $50 corkage fee would likely good value $50 just insane!  would much rather see them mark wines more reasonably lower corkage fee $25 $30 where most high end steakhouses are   Sometimes want bring your favorite wine home pay 350% markup  2 Dining room tight intimate which noise little louder may want   also tables near perimeter restaurant right along main walkway property catch noise outside restaurant too  <EOR> Delicious but expensive   Dined few weeks ago just remembered right now awesome dinner rolls were  looked sweet glaze top but salt sprinkled top   Came during Pacquiao Cotto fight weekend excitement air MGM  restaurant packed everybody looked having good time   With party 6 most ordered surf turf deal respective sides  gf along carrots risotto    Take note sides HUGE definitely family style  filet mignon shrimp satisfying   After feasting ended night chocolate souffle ridiculous sized serving coffee  Each person own french press!  6 people = $750  If you're looking lower priced steakhouse celebrity chef I'd highly recommend StripSteak Michael Mina Mandalay  <EOR> MGM Grand sign front says The City Entertainment   MGM Grand more The City Restaurants   many good choices resort very hard choose which upscale place you'd dine  Well look no further    Craftsteak easily accessible if come Valet parking garage  If walked front door MGM Grand strip long hike here    The food excellent portion sizes great atmosphere warm inviting    My previous three journeys into Craftsteak ordered 16oz Skirt Steak  Wagyu version base version  Pretty much if ordering cars steak house      you'd your choice between BMW 3 Series Toyota Camry  always picked Toyota  Why? Well skirt steak served $36 16oz sufficient delicious    Unfortunately seems based menus online only Wagyu kobe skirt steak now hefty $69 12oz  If want BMW 3 Series steak knock yourself out    The truffled mac cheese other sides excellent but unnecessary   only need steak because if order lots sides you'll wasting lots food   All all decor nice service excellent which Craftsteak perfect place quiet dinner   recommend place everybody meet stays MGM Grand however across street Stripsteak @ Mandalay Bay favorite cut skirt steak  <EOR> Sadly very disappointed husband's steak   He ordered wagyu ribeye   chewy lacked flavor something definitely wrong it   aren't usually kind people complain but price lack quality meat completely unacceptable    The wagyu skirt steak other hand amazing   also really enjoyed broccolini   lobster bisque creamy pretty good wagyu tar tar unlike anything ever eaten   The wandering photographer added unnecessary cheese factor absolutely didn't belong such nice place  <EOR> If can't afford $300+ meal for two should probably just stop reading review now  only sad know can't enjoy it    This most recent trip Vegas first time Adult meaning wasn't drunk poor college student trying $50 day for food   obviously wanted big    And boy did big  most food Vegas two different Buffets too  Most importantly though food amazing    This 5 star dining experience start finish  made reservation arrived early grab cocktail bar  cocktails both delicious  showed wearing fancy clothing Hostess realized special occasion although really just boyfriend looks tie given private booth back restaurant  very quiet romantic   We each ordered Chef's 3 course meal must least 2 people   American Wagyu $140 each  worth every penny  started off appetizer Hand cut Wagyu Tartare which delicious  never tartare before both loved it  also choice 3 salad choices  Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Roasted Red Peppers Wild Arugula  all fantastic but think Buffalo Mozzarella favorite which included roasted red pepper relish which fantastic     Then came steaks  Oh man steaks  both American Wagyu which comes Snake River Farms Idaho  New York Strip boyfriend Rib eye  cooked perfectly delicious  Each cut 14 oz couldn't even finish it  felt weird leaving behind delicious expensive steak    With steak also choice 3 sides  Mushroom Assortment Potato Gratin White Corn Grits  Bacon Gruyere Chives  all good but once again favorite White Corn Grits  polished off  addition bacon Gruyere amazing    After eating ALL FOOD  also tasting selection desserts including Cinnamon Monkey Bread Vanilla Cheesecake Farmers Market Fruit ice cream sorbet  point could barely even touch food but all very tasty  favorite Monkey Bread which surprisingly somehow managed finish probably because delicious but also because fatties     Overall think Chef's 3 course meal way go  Steak itself $105 $35 more ALL FOOD    We also shared bottle Malbec which always favorite Steak  very extensive wine list    The service all top notch wonderful    It delicious dinner fantastic experience  <EOR> I would come back but only Diver Sea Scallops   Those good!

Also don't really drink Rieslings but Riesling glass divine! if Riesling must try it  best part price glass bad all  think $9! generally waiter kind heavy hand pouring  Remember tip well! If can't afford tip can't afford restaurant THE BEEF first time ate frankly impressed  Everything over salted! didn't want harsh  Maybe person grill evening heavy hand  But repeated visits Craftsteak realized every time steak kobe not grilled tends overly salty  learned prefer steaks roasted  server explained grilled means just stick over grill flip  Roasted means kind sear pan then stick steak into broiler  Also seems when grilled steaks slice steak when bring table  But when order roasted steaks entire steak  Whatever     don't care much long tastes good! also braised short ribs  excellent alternative traditional steak  short ribs perfectly tender fell off bone    THE SIDES SALADS Haven't tried lot salads but enjoy beets shaved fennel salads  ingredients fresh good quality  sides also learned tell them easy salt sauteed mushrooms  But LOVE assorted mushrooms because great quality mushrooms  Also great side     don't know if just seasonal but sauteed corn delish! butter     butter     more butter! onion  just good corn  Yukon Gold Puree pretty good above average but amazing corn  would recommend sharing sides pretty large  mushrooms could two  But potatoes corn portions definitely large enough more 2 persons   THE DESSERT Okay admit     found stuck it  Since many reviewers recommended cinnamon monkey bread  first visit never veered  suggest too    BOTTOM LINE service excellent food great if order right things  nicest waiters older gentleman Switzerland something around there  don't remember name but he's lived all sorts places speaks few languages  <EOR> Maybe came night greeting ladies waitresses unhappy working but walking being ignored until done talking other people fact frowning ALL THEM fact sat couple checked later reservation     who cares food tastes why want step door ?

Meats 1 Wagyu skirt steak   melt in your youth goodness   3 4 pieces does very rich recommendation order table share family style   definite must try  2 Porterhouse AMAZING   Perfectly seasoned very tender   very large cut definitely needs shared more just 2 people menu recommends 1 order 2 people but feed 3 4 even especially when order side dishes 3 T bone Very tasty but does compare Porterhouse Wagyu steak   Still great choice although filet side bit dryer all other cuts  4 Braised Short Ribs Very tender   meat pretty much melts your mouth   dish bit smaller size filling eating steak   Although dish well prepared think ordering steaks much better option   never better steak anywhere else but comparable braised short ribs   Sides 1 Mushroom risotto If risotto must   Probably BEST risotto ever had   Unfortunately wasn't available last time here   replaced another dish said comparable but wasn't all  2 Mushroom assortment nice side if enjoy eating mushrooms your steak   Good but nothing special    3 Potato puree Very smooth rich   It' nice side if butter   think put lot butter into puree   eating very creamy mashed potatoes 4 Asparagus nice side if want some greens your meal but taste just asparagus prepared anywhere else   special  5 Corn forgot call menu only menu when season but BEST side dishes here   grill corn then take off cob cream corn but more grilled corn   Very flavorful   If happen eat when available must order   Dessert 1 Cinnamon monkey bread bit sweet tastes but friends really liked it   If love sugar then maybe dessert but way sweet me  2 Chocolate

looking well worth money  <EOR> Went Craft steakhouse bachelor party dinner   didn't high expectations because haven't many steakhouses strip used typical Ruth Chris wolf gang type places   must say probably best steak ever had   wagyu rib eye snap pea risotto potatos mushrooms side   Steak cooked seasoned liking risotto delicious   order shrimp cocktail appetizer which good but nothing special any other restaurant   monkey bread dessert die for   Heaven your mouth     I say down side price    def most expensive steak dinner life   But worth it   ordered 2 bottles wine portion bill came $200  <EOR> I want start saying wife previous experience Craftsteak top notch many best first time experiences   Such best rolls steak sides ever tasted reason made special trip back Vegas just eat restaurant   However time completely different experience where everything over salted not over seasoned but way much salt everything    almost edible well temperature steak way off   ordered medium rare steak but large portion steak medium making tough chew    issues may expect run into every once while single $ restaurant but $$$$ establishment Craftsteak   Needless say very disappointed back   As side note no issues staff everyone friendly helpful   However less said chef cooked meal  <EOR> I didn't really research place before trying usually but fast reservation didn't much time choose   tried domestic waygu menu which included 1 salad 1 appetizer 1 soup 2 waygu selections 3 sides 2 desserts     The warm frisee salad sour but egg bacon nice   lobster bisque excellent where creamy chowder but just enough texture feel drinking soup   6 piece oyster very fresh ate them fast came     The main course wagyu filet mignon ribeye   ribeye tough medium rare but still good   favorite filet mignon where very tender required very little effort eat   main came 3 sides which wild mushrooms carrots asparagus   All cooked very well     Dessert coffee ice cream sencha tea   tea helped cleared palate great close meal   Next time try A5 menu  <EOR> Great place bring group friends spend lot money   Our party 5 ordered Chef's Tasting Menu when say tasting mean little little that   Portions served family style lot veg awesome knew many types beets existed   Meat well prepared signature spare rib fall apart wonderful   Next time Kobe tasting menu   Wait staff good however did find group pouring wine more often  <EOR> Went first time November 2011  Best Porterhouse ever ate  Just July 2012 Porterhouse delivered dry way overcooked  Talked into getting Filet substitute  Arrived blood rare  still looking medium rare  back another 10 minutes came back fine  Flavor good remember  Seemed under seasoned dry  Huge difference November 2011  WAY better steaks Ruths Flemings  bad steak house can't deliver good steak anymore  <EOR> While MGM wife wanted wine n dine wanted impress wifey fabulous dinner considering looks great atmosphere nice then why not  Well amazement dinner all means great ordered rib eye steak medium came bloody hell also forget salt Really great  but mashed potato puree indeed great swallowed those bread warm n good  wife ordered filet bloody hell again she return finally when came back tasted dirty wet rag spinach salad good  Finally she return filet told them tasted horrible  took bill which  least could've done  2 stars 1 bread 1 salad   it      <EOR> This highlights 3 day weekend getaway Vegas    I really wanted tasting menu but boyfriend pointed would little bit more cost effective just order la carte off menu still ton food    The tasting menu $125 person if double ranch steak $155 if wagyu beef  offers appetizer soup 4 oysters shrimp cocktail 3 small salads 3 sides 3 desserts     Started off italian buffalo mozzarella $17 00  basically 6 slices Mozzarella topped tomato relish balsamic olive oil  highlight toasted hazelnuts  Nothing super special salad but good  We decided order porterhouse 2 $98 00  huge 32 oz steak cooked perfectly medium rare  hate when restaurants cooked steak medium rare comes dripping blood but Craftsteak does well where meat medium rare but bloody    Sides all tried corn $15 00 potato puree $14 00 mushroom assortment $25 00 baby squash $15 00    Corn sweet corn sauteed butter  corn crunchy tasted very fresh Potato puree mashed potatoes but very different  potatoes very thick gooey such right amount butter cream Mushroom assortment shittake french horn hen woods white beech  Sauteed mushrooms still some texture  Baby squash least favorite sides  small italian squash over really good chunky marinara sauce  believe squash roasted Not anything super special     Dessert $14 00 cinnamon pull apart monkey bread  basically chunks broiche pecans caramel side cinnamon ice cream  really rich but overly sweet which surprising because whole bread alot caramel sauce over it    Service 3 different waiters main waiter water boy plate person  Service exceptional give warm plates every course well
