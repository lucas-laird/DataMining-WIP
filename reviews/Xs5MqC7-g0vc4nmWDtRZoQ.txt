Just nicely nicelys pizza large fry  Pizza amazing  Juicy flavorful chicken yummy mushrooms big chunks garlic  Ingredients good  Crust perfect too   Fries just regular crinkle ones but atleast good! First time delivery atleast once week! <EOR> This favorite cravings spots sandwiches  tried quite few them yet disappointed any  pizza looks great but haven't personally tried but based other reviews may check couple those too  mention favorite desserts right same shopping center  <EOR> This place gone downhill significantly sadly!!!  When lived part town some years back ate occasionally pizza service always decent good enough enjoy once awhile   Then moved across town didn't often wasn't convenient   Over past few years few times okay    sauce seemed different but okay    good enough eat nothing excited about   didn't quite some time   thing always    always same when ordered pepperoni each square slice 3 4 pieces pepperoni it   Each time we'd say dang next time need order double pepperoni because lots more slices   But always forgot order way  A couple weeks ago trying decide eat thought Nathan's    decided give them another try since quite while   actually remembered pepperoni time ordered medium DOUBLE pepperoni light sauce    nothing else  Our pizza arrives    4 pieces pepperoni each slice    umm double??  But worse cheese overpowering triple normal amount cheese   When said something argued said double when asked cheese he said Yeah put extra cheese     WHY?  didn't ask extra cheese don't TON cheese!   said double unless you've cut way back only 2 pieces each slice    always gotten 3 4 pieces per slice    nowhere near double  Paying double should least 5 6 pieces pepperoni per slice   cook very rude took pizza grabbed huge handful cold pepperoni dumped all over pizza    now way much wasn't cooked into pizza all   Because being loaded down cheese didn't taste great either    all could taste cheese   ate just enough weren't starving anymore  left rest  Extremely disappointing visit    each time over years gotten worse but very worst!  Really bad service terrible pizza!  should offered re make pizza correct cheese correct pepperoni refunded money could very least apologized    but no just nasty rude!  Very sad    used good family run place    now just rude people making wrong pizzas then refuse fix them when screw up   won't back again they've used second third chances each time worse last  <EOR> Best pizza world! Knowing pizzas made daily done hand more delicious  usually craving place  I'd probably gain some weight but totally worth lol <EOR> Was Sunday night dinner   decided try because gift certificate Restaurant com heard good pizza   restaurant corner Lake Mead Buffalo next smash burger   Inside pretty cool  bar booth seating walls decorated Detroit sports stuff theres least 10 nice flat screens all over giant projector screen   Most sunday games 1 nascar race 1 even cartoon network couple tables kids     So when arrive order window just find seat anywhere your number  fountain drinks self service didn't order any beer sure tab goes  bad aren't self service   amirite?

Pizza  what  trying Northside Nathan's see why  Now come two conclusions eating Northside Nathan's doesn't accurately represent Detroit style pizza much same way lot New York style pizzerias town bear absolutely no resemblance real New York pizza Detroit needs stick manufacturing vehicles love drive leave pizza big boys New York maybe guess Chicago     The ambiance place easily 3 5 4 stars  really cool decor  service also good  counter girl friendly helpful  also lots good promotions going coupons all over website pizza boxes    So those three redeeming qualities Northside Nathan's  Unfortunately everything came tumbling down  crust far terrible actually most decent thing pizza  most apparent problem cheese artificial blend variety  Whatever guarantee box came didn't read Whole Milk Mozzarella anything sort  meatball topping just awful flavorless crumbled ground beef topping  sauce barely existent but maybe  good thing because little could taste really sub par  doctored Parm Red Pepper Oregano Garlic Powder but Eminem once said Nurse we're losing him  Check pulse!! Alas late save terrible pizza  won't swear off Detroit style pizza good but chances returning Northside Nathan's anytime soon somewhere between Slim Shady    P S  Something learned experience    If restaurant hard time burning your fries probably isn't going fare well more difficult areas food menu  <EOR> We former Detroiters way adding miles visit location every Vegas visit posted pictures recommended place pizza many former Michiganders now living AZ  Really looked forward pizza again last Wednesday Sept 26   Don't know if Malinowski Warren MI sold place but crust medium pepperoni pizza edible  crust dry tasted days old bread  thought very strange when pizza delivered booth almost immediately sat down  must precooked left sitting  hot  tired riding Harley 337 miles picked off toppings ate them left headed check hotel very disappointed  Also used ladies room before leaving ladies bathroom 3 yes three visibly empty soap dispensers no hand towels  <EOR> My new favorite pizza!!!
