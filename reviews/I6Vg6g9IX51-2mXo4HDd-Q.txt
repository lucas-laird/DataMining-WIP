A typical local bar! Nothing special  Smoker friendly! Drinks good bartenders nice plus machines give play time! Plus lot TV's chances catching game want there! <EOR> So used come quite bit when lived closer stopped today area yes terrible luck new machines but bar tender more concerned personal phone call she getting diet soda requested never did get   Ok only briefly but long enough know wasn't concern personal assumption phone call she obviously more important only customer   I originally going order food request drink again but she didn't give chance would interrupt conversation she stood other side bar guess couldn't hear conversation but also made difficult ask anything just left then she asked if good   burger Wendy's  <EOR> $3 50 drink  Happy hour  midnight something haha can't remember  pretty drunk   Well anyways happy hour $2 drinks $1 buds   Can't remember if pay play pool but remember giving ID balls bartender   Ok pretty sad review  little recollection night  much whiskey kid  <EOR> Machines very tight but pool table  Bartenderd excellent  Food average bar food  Overall ok normal vegas bar <EOR>
