I deal travelzoo com recent trip Las Vegas  thought good deal   2 entrees 2 margaritas plus restaurant strip Forum Shops Caesars Palace  When seated greeted server mentioned travelzoo deal  Once said think service downhill     He asked if wanted margaritas rocks frozen   we asked frozen  did get??? Margaritas rocks!  I ordered carne fajita platter  did get??? chicken plate!   I mean c'mon! Every other table salsa chips took good 5 min flag down server ask tell he orders wrong  worried most only took them few minutes bring carne asada platter  would think meat would take longer cook   I guess not!!!   It frustrates when restaurants offer travelzoo deals groupons etc service changes once mention it! Just because pay fraction meal doesn't mean should fraction service  ridiculous  No matter kind deal always tip full price  so don't understand why businesses freak think don't need provide good service  <EOR> First post Google Map Review month ago Very tasty fresh!
