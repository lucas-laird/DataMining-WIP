Besides waffles morning she nothing else eat fact other friends sick also should speak itself  just found others called well manager said she wasn't sorry sick! absolutely pathetic  didn't want free meal more wanted money back but manager flat said no money back  Don't ever please eat buffet  <EOR> The sushi chefs great   food great but haven't returned since 2014 reason even though favorite spots to   never return just because waitress female server scolded having leftovers   extremely stuffed couldn't take another bite   She said next time don't leave leftovers  said maybe won't next time   never next time  <EOR> My sister coming Sushi Mon more year always leave satisfied! servers always super nice coming around take more sushi orders refill drinks  love offer half rolls try more menu fill two rolls  love garlic edamame ecstasy roll! always start finish it!

As food 11 10 highly recommend! baked mussels favorite  always AYCE when come here  sushi never dry refreshing  sushi never overloaded rice some places  right amount rice compliment fish   The experience amazing  always spot sushi! <EOR> What shame? New ownership  Used come once week  very friendly relaxed atmosphere  Maybe changed last 4 5 months but changeover became very uncomfortable  Large slices fish became thin  Included items became additional charges  son 2 years old  regular think let people away things I say restaurant owner let's regular customers things all time   admit annoyed when charged son eats two pieces roll plays third piece  cheap don't mind paying but good least once week      Let slide    Then flavors kitchen changed too  Take leave it  bought restaurant existing business well  Your customers liked received  may think you're improving something but reality changing something people like  good before  Now we're regulars sushi koma  Very happy but miss old crew  <EOR> This place all you can eat sushi thing but thing can't share  also says time limit but don't care eat your limit! sometimes eat all you can eat sushi but also donkatsu which order separately apart all you can eat  finale always enjoy strawberry mochi ice cream favorite  Don't worry all all you can eat peeps dessert also all you can eat!
