Crunchy cheesy slices melt    Recommended restaurant right! latte also nice raw sugar stick! Service nice great view pool garden!   Oh watch birds might land your table <EOR> I came last week some business associates while food itself great service not  drinks meal dish check all took SEVERAL requests several different staff members before being brought us  Certainly you'd expect when spending bit money breakfast  Three requests spanned over 15 minutes diet soda? side pancakes being brought once everyone's done eating despite two inquisitions previously made arrival rest dishes   acceptable worth coming back  need refresher means WORK instead standing around groups 3 chatting while paying customers struggle full meal drinks  <EOR> Staying Encore wanting eat house spent some time looking over reviews different options   Jardin overall good reviews though seemed common thread inattentive slow service wait staff   would dining alone nothing else if dinner took long wasn't going effect negatively   I greeted entrance two smiling pleasant hostesses could seated immediately patio inside   inquiring temperature patio being assured comfortable heat lamps chose sit there   breezy cool didn't feel much heat nearest heat lamp glad wearing long sleeved blouse! The occasional waft cigarette smoke another patron two seated patio unpleasant but overwhelming   tables close together since dining alone could without straining overhear conversations tables left right  but engaged conversation own table those conversations probably wouldn't even registered me   being off season wasn't any noise adjacent pool  As seated hostess gave drink menu which contained respectable number offerings  One couples eventually seated next weren't given wine menu hostesses evidently retrieved them wait staff waiter brought them upon request  asking couple questions waiter he knowledgeable cocktails asking recommendation settled spritzer absolutely delicious some water no ice please    I also ordered bowl chicken noodle soup kale salad side Brussels sprouts   Within minutes placing order soup delivered hot scalding could enjoyed right away hearty tender cubes chicken heaping serving noodles    While enjoying soup and consequently being warmed inside out bread basket arrived warm soft chewy pretzel sticks side horseradish whipped butter or aioli  I am NO FAN horseradish but outstanding   bit time before salad Brussels sprouts delivered requested some hot water side lemon promptly delivered   kale salad good though maybe few more croutons would liked but balanced flavors very filling   Brussels sprouts superb served hot miniature cast iron skillet   With little room remaining stomach chose dessert layered cheesecake dark chocolate cake   most disappointing item put mouth all evening   but still good   cheesecake creamy delicious but parts cake layer gummy springy liking  now full nearly bursting left half plate   As leaving restaurant stopped use restroom small 2 stalls only 1 sink but very clean   Both waiter Dan busboy Cris attentive courteous kind helpful prompt   service table tables next excellent helped turn could lonely dinner into lovely dinner! <EOR> Maybe more 3 5 but just OK   The OJ fresh squeezed all   fact whole Wynn Encore property blatant disregard fresh OJ  all paying $8 OJ when truly fresh squeezed   but when give glass sour watered down crap you're shitting whole day! My hubby felt same coffee   both those items being first sips whole day want good off great start  weak might well throw water face send way   bit dramatic but take OJ coffee seriously!

Lastly Bloody Mary cart smiling bartender  save next time!

Our server came said hello then didn't see almost 20 minutes  Meanwhile other servers hanging around table noticing looking server them came check us  When server finally came back she simply said Sorry step off floor   first question why didn't let know send someone check us? cheap diner! place upscale guests should treated way    Our food took FOREVER come out  realize Saturday night but again server never came checked restaurant honestly looked dead  Once food finally arrived disappointed  Luckily snacking throughout day only ordered small meals because food just alright drinks mediocre well  presentation fabulous but taste   not much   After finished food took server another 10 years finally check sister law asked very nicely check she asked if she could please split them  server looked sister law said TON attitude all 5?! Ugh just give 2 minutes   10 minutes laster she returned checks slammed them down front each said thanks under breath she walking away    At point upset wanted speak manager  friends servers even worked restaurant short while myself completely understand every table pampered splitting checks pain but being said place cheap service received terrible  manager came over server made sure very close pretending stuff she could listen complaints  All manager said sorry your experience let your checks   another 10 minutes server yes bad experience came back checks said very sarcastically sorry bad experience manager took $5 off your meals     Why would send server complained give checks? Also nice manager took some money off meals but honestly $5 off place expensive Jardin more slap face apology  looking anything discounted free but wanted management know experience hopefully future guests better time half hearted apology received along $5 off seemed just trying door  Overall truly disappointed final dinner sister's bachelorette party ruined horrible service treatment received Jardin highly recommend anyone considering eat turn other way  Although ambience appearance place fabulous everything else subpar  <EOR> I don't post much but place moved to  cannot say enough good things! being greeted door server being most fun attentive ever then visit GM most engaged managers ever seen  She moved table table huge smile engaging people joining service  recommend chicken waffles chilaquiles awesome!! <EOR> We booked stay Wynn Encore same time made reservation Jardin before left Hawaii since new restaurant  We weren't disappointed breakfast meal Veggie Frittata made perfection bacon crisp service exceptional usual Wynn decor real flowers  We'll back again tomorrow  <EOR>
