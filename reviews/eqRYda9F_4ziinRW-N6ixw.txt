I don't think speaka good Ingles though  Each time through drive through ask red sauce always green sauce  <EOR> Fast easy good   normally breakfast burritos Sundays always hit spot lol  Word advice    Don't red sauce unless your home work  good idea trust haha <EOR> A little difficult communicate directions because typical language barrier but pretty much impression when there  quick cheap Mexican restaurant gas station minimum wage employees   what expect  Anyway don't ordering anything special complicated most likely turn want it! Other they're okay  <EOR> I just most unpleasant experience location  ordered carne asade QUESEDILLA given carne asade fries drive thru  When realized fries waited someone come back window no luck  parked inside fixed  stood counter couple minutes before someone decided finally come counter help me  top already waiting far long assisted lady helped unbelievably rude me  told situation she started arguing telling ordered fries  never ordered carne asade fries life actually ordering co worker straight order she wrote down me  KNOW ordered quesadilla  lady kept blaming telling fault  point furious but didn't want cause scene  stood quietly while made quesadilla decided check prices both items noticed fries more expensive quesadilla  Typically am type person just shrug off worry price difference  However when she handed food attitude immediately walked away without offering any type compensation price difference decided enough being treated crap wanted money back   she walking away grab attention again she pleased  explained price difference immediately she threw hands air said again fault said fries   baffled someone would treat customer badly no matter whose fault order wrong  No matter fault came calmly issue fixed  did deserve treated way she treating me   She then said something co workers which she likely talking badly whole time bad don't understand Spanish   He told price difference between items she opened register basically threw dollar said   Mind price difference $1 15 charged tax more expensive item  Again normally blow kind thing off especially because really wasn't big price difference  However no customer should EVER treated way treated no matter fault order being wrong  point only wish would made bigger scene demanded full refund ate somewhere else  <EOR> First need say LOVE Roberto's new favorite Taco Bell Del Taco etc   Since moving Feb  12' say certainly favorite little drunken munchies spot     Now specific Roberto's   third location tried far FAR worst coming couple pitchers munchies raging!  ordered rolled tacos gauc which tasted just other 2 hence why 1 stars   other star because food served very quickly but alas believe why second dish great     I cheese enchilada meal   sauce tasted okay but main problem cheese even melted inside just bunch shredded cheese did enjoy inside luke warm enchilada   friend also ordered 'GO TO' meal chimichanga mmm mmm mmm however Roberto's bleh bleh bleh!  tortilla fried nearly enough chicken wet moist wet overall barely even warm     I marked Roberto's off list return which shame because hoping local spot Tuesdays less mile local bar  <EOR> I ordered tacos de adobada husband California burrito super dry! wasn't even appetizing all didn't even eat am waste food but just couldn't   sorry but last time go   <EOR> If could give less 1 star would  3 separate occasions figured third time would charm? wholly disappointed! Tacquitos hard dry bland even dog interested  Fish tacos bones them twice  literally wouldn't even eat poor excuse food if given free  TERRIBLE  <EOR> I ordered phone before drove pick food  guy tommy order kind @ $% but stupid ordered anyway    I didn't realize gas station  son Roberto's expert he said he likes down street  disregarded initial instincts eat gas station     First all food zero flavor  enchiladas which Roberto's plenty times full onions green peppers  Literally! didn't order veggie plate    Second food no flavor     Third became sick ingesting garbage  weeping razor sharp pain intestines     quite intense  sick felt horrible rest night    That's eating gas station!!! Ugh! <EOR> Not impressed  Probably smallest Burrito ever gotten any Roberto's 20 years Vegas! <EOR> If could give zero review would  Called order still waiting food over 30 minutes  Tipped guy cashier five dollars advance still horrible service  won't returning <EOR> I love Carne Asada breakfast burritos     being said    Service poor wait time especially evening time HORRIBLE!  Crazy thing is back breakfast burrito  <EOR> Good ol' reliable   Open 24 hours south west corner Charleston Buffalo gas station right next door   usually work really late into odd hours night location even more convenient drive thru!
