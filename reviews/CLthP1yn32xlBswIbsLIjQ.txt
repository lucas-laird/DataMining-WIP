I've ordered twice  first time delivery fast  only 30 minutes which convenient because work off stirp BUT FORGET CHIPS  I little mad but still happy food  even though pretty plain  Ordered second time AGAIN FORGOT CHIPS  TOOK OVER 90 MINUTES DELIVER WHEN ONLY 15 mins tops location    Never ordering again  Terrible customer service!!! <EOR> Wait min   Ok place some good late night grub!  This your standard Mexican joint attached bar! Which really helps while sitting trying debate if Jack Box Del Taco order few brews    For all frugal drunks grave yard special!  For $6 00 get     2 pints beer   STELLA!!! next door @ Money Play's item off limited special menu   But real deal    the food! really bad opportunity try variety items   But true standout is     Carne Asada Torta! say standard  variety nachos taco burritos etc  good fact pretty good    Go back prices quality food enjoy ride! <EOR> Disclaimer   my food delivery order  heard mixed reviews opted try it    Lack flavor    added some salt some down   hey hungry no other option point lunch break! Enchiladas bit more greasy expected rice beans really no flavor   Menu basic Mexican food  Lots bar type appetizer options   Others ordered said fish tacos great quesadillas basic  Probably won't return  <EOR> Good food open late    perfect!  stopped few weeks back weren't disappointed   chicken beef taco prices decent! inside place isn't greatest which almost want leave but food good  <EOR> Worst food ever  Chicken tacos gross  Supreme nachos bland  asked cilantro didn't give any  burrito  no rice literally just tortilla meat  No Pico de gallo no sauce cilantro NOTHING!!! Only reason two stars because fast  Horrible food though  authentic Mexican food all  <EOR> This place very delicious food! best shredded beef taco salads! Chicken fingers great if don't Mexican  recommend place everyone  all bad reviews don't appreciate good take out  <EOR> i called 1am  said would deliver hotel room drove over   the guy behind counter ignored while he counted register  once he ready order ordered couple things he stopped called another guy over handed pad paper asked if he going write down  then start order over 2nd guy  finished order he asked other guy #9 combo was  he didnt even know own menu    while waited them cook food filling some little cups salsa saw couple bugs counter which scurried under dish  flies fruit flies  bugs  beetles  tiny cockroach maybe? let i'd already paid just wanted food   we food home  sucked  i had fried mushrooms flavorless very watery   nachos supreme flavorless low quality  more flavor texture lean cuisine  barely managed eat half   fish taco much sauce enough fish  my boyfriend extremely easy please had #9 combo bean burrito chicken enchilada rice beans all mediocre best  summary poor service filthy restaurant food made regret eating it   we should've gone del taco down street  <EOR> Yes very very good!    I recommend shredded beef burrito   lot nice melted cheese burrito handful heaven     And if carnitas carnitas superb delicious!    I also recommend veggie burrito   am vegetarian but packed burrito lots lettuce etc! The veggie burrito packed really really good   add ingredients any burrito extra charge  theoretically order veggie burrito add meat it   although seems ever turn quite right   otherwise burritos don't much else them other meat   each burrito comes two additional ingredients depending which order           Uniquely flavored rice red salsa  favorites but uniquely flavored   love green sauce though    <EOR> I ordered veggie burrito without cheese $5 which ended being just less $6 taxes card fees  portion size worth its cost jalapenos tasted par other veggie burritos other places  I'd buy more food but 50¢ card fee held back  definitely order more next visit however  Keep mind looking something eat 3 30 A M  convenience 24 hour restaurant adds its value   The only drawback bar next door which open doorway connected dining area annoyingly loud party dance music  Considering late more sensitive irritable such sounds I'd prefer if door kept shut turn down noise coming into dining area  <EOR> Fast delivery  Great price  Amazing chicken chimichangas !!!!
