Then approximately ten minutes later he arrived door pasta hand signed receipt handed back he muttered something he walked away   I gave food boyfriend no clue if actually good lost appetite  Maybe just happen catch guy bad day maybe he upset because hard time understanding phone but customer service shouldn't sacrificed opinion  <EOR> Only person working literally taking orders cooking  Waited over 45 min still didn't only JUICE ordered   Asked money back people ordered food before never again !

Always good quality literally just ANYTHING could want BBQ pizza subs burgers salads soups even VEGAN VEGETARIAN options! well huge selection smoothies! deliver until 2am! Family owned obviously hard working dedicated people  pleasure provided service The only negative say place isn't nicest or easiest navigate locate area neighborhood  If aren't within delivery range which pretty huge recommend phoning picking up       More worth venturing your comfort zone diamond rough! <EOR> They're close where live thought I'd order them   ordered simple meal pasta plain sausage beer battered zucchini   pasta covered sauce cheese   zucchini absolutely delicious   low rating messing easy order  try them again because menu items zucchini   Can't write off place because less stellar experience  <EOR> Daddy's Delights is    alright  This review based soley upon delivery which costs additional $3 until 3am although can't imagine dining offers much different experience     On plus side  menu extensive   Salads crepes both savory sweet burgers pizza pasta fried chicken quinoa smoothies fresh squeezed juices gyros grilled fish etc etc etc   If its 2am don't want pizza delivery Daddys great because offer *huge* selection both normal items healthy alternatives too   Grilled veggies sweet potato always well done   On down side  everything mediocre   Burgers no frill pita bread tough juices watery salmon dry quinoa dry lettuce limp    but taking hit quality something might expect family restaurant menu large   Don't expect excited your order   feel smaller menu might able specialize items instead offering wide variety bland     The delivery men women always very sweet always arrive timely manner   order only wrong once a peach papaya smoothie red   watery pulpy but thats besides point but besides operation tight service friendly   All all if its late night delivery options slim would order Daddys Delights again but food certainly crave worthy  <EOR> This place hidden gem! caprese salad  fresh delicious  Service really fast friendly  Can't wait try more menu items    Picked order 7 25 16  Noticed Heath inspection grade downgraded C store smelled sewage  Thought people should know before order pay online  <EOR> Ok gave them another chance everything great again!
