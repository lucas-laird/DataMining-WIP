Then she said ok right over  I think she supervisor because she different shirt rest them  thinking she would generous giving towel because she attending another guest  waited 5 more minutes come by  Then she sends another person wipe table  Funny thing observing more table needed wiped she only wipes ours  LAZY!!!! busy all  Then brought food fries cold burger awful!! meat hard tasteless My husband could hear staff just messing around back  kid without uniform just standing looking over small counter soda machine just smiling  all observation lobby looked crap  Staff no sense urgency lobby check sweep whole time there  Fountain machine full spills restroom no soap wash hands with  Thinking self if isn't any soap would staff hands using restroom??

But idiot constantly thinking handle eating jalapeños when know taste buds can't handle it  Masochist dining  Fortunately didn't suffer runny nose  lettuce didn't seem fresh southwest burger     Southwest burger bit messy but better jalapeño one  Maybe because sauce maybe because messy imitate all other A List celebrity Carl's Jr commercials lick fingers lips    Cross cut fries greasy all true fast good fries  initial bite always good but aftertaste I no like! hate icky feeling having grease roof your mouth  <EOR> Never changes expensive dirty tables  I guess Management never looks Yelp   Funky air vent smell back restaurant   Big Carl burger good  <EOR> Fast Food?
