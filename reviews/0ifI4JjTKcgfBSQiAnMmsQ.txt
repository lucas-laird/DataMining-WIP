Because love Mad Greek Baker  long line never look menu when turn order falafel  Never anything else     Falafel tahini rice pita small salad     always excellent!!  Went locale last week since outside decor made think food would good Baker locale       The guy said same company same menu  I ordered falafel course  Extra $2 rice fries What?! Ok ordered rice  When meal arrived fries  Good thing didn't send back because those fries best part  Maybe turnover slower but falafel heavy pita light fluffy tahini he gave hummus   I'll give them more try even though visit very disappointing  Maybe they'll act together  place far home but lot closer Baker!! <EOR> Every time Vegas lunch dinner  gyro's best ever!!! lunch meals super cheap just gotta try place won't regret it  <EOR>
