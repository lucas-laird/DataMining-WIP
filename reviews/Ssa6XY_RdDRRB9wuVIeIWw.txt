Food wise roasted chicken sandwich which came highly recommended  chicken moist seasoned perfection it hint pepper but much else   garlic sauce drizzled just creamy yet sent taste buds into overdrive  even side note pita bread heavy really soft each bite no soggy tones   far best best anywhere    Since right down street Stepmother's employer certainly see myself ready round #2 3 4  Ha ha! Very well done indeed! <EOR> Really can't complain  Fast service great Mediterranean food free hummus Yelp check in  else ask for? good service because really no other diners which odd Saturday shortly noon   The prices pretty average comparable other similar restaurants town  Lunch combos include side pita bread  Would likely come again if craving beef kabobs! <EOR> This best Lebanese food town!

Check promotion free Hummus appetizer purchase entree  Even without Yelp! offer would still order this  Every restaurant's always different ways seasoning hummus location appreciate very garlicky notes hummus  Theirs also very smooth consistency overpowering tahini sauce   Their baba ghanoush other hand okay  appreciate differences consistency but similar hummus    What better hummus haha ghanoush? Fresh oven pita bread! haste downing 3 baskets between friends forgot ask if pita bread made house because fluffy compared very dense thick store bought pita   For appetizer friend ordered lentil soup  Soup very strong lentil flavor garlic onions over powering dish but downside soup pureed smooth hummus  Great soup just needed garnish just offset lack texture   One friend ordered Lebanese sandwich  When think Mediterranean would think fresh healthy  miss  sirloin didn't much flavor ask server tahini sauce  Also would think Mediterranean food would find your entree swimming oil    But was  pita bread meat ratio off being more bread filling  price offered but least trim bread provide perception customers being ripped    My other friend ordered Meat Plate which combination 1 Skewer ordered  medium rare 1 Mqaniq Lebanese pork sausage 1 Kibbi ground sirloin meatball stuffed onions pine nuts 1 Kafta ground sirloin witj spices 1 Sujuk spicy ground beef   Skewer seasoned great but temperature medium  Myaniq Kibbi underwhelmingly seasoned borderline dry  Sujuk great spice seasoning  rice phenomenal fluffy mushy nice lemon taste seasoning   I ordered myself lamb chops ordered rare  Aside temperature arriving medium flavors great  sauteed vegetables swimming oil  Well literally but cook very liberal should say    To finish off experience ordered baklava shabiet  sucker baklava hate say fan take classic staple  size impressive but ends there  filo pastry sheets didn't seem fully baked flakey crusty characteristic would expect amiss  Instead very hard cut honey rose water syrup crumbled pistachios enjoyable    The shabiet other hand offered savory sweet finish meal which delightfully unexpected  milk custard consistency thick cut mozzarella loaf over half inch thick warmed kept square shape but yielding when cut side tine fork  honey pistachios provided sweetness  Sadly filo dough wasn't crispy should but combination nuts remaining crunchiness dough provided nice counterpoint texture   Next time definitely need order pistachio ice cream   Overall experience mediocre  Server great especially when messed didn't read lamb chops came French fries changed order rice  Just liberal use oil underseasoned entrees crunchy filo dough made rate 3 5  But hummus service lamb chops fresh pita enough return future visits  <EOR> Tried restaurant found new favorite restaurant Las Vegas   soon walk smell Mediterranean spices food great   waiter Jason very helpful pleasant explaining menu provided recommendations   He came check table frequently made sure everything needed   ordered Shawarma Lamb plate   best meals life   ticket time max 10 15 minutes but tasted could taken hour good   environment cleanliness menu service food great   am definitely going back am happy found gem  <EOR> This review frarej chicken dish alone  good amazing  big portion could shared it  good lemon garlic flavor  complementary fresh pita bread good too  restaurant itself small could use some updating but service fast friendly  <EOR> The BF haven't back last time food fresh great flavors just stellar food    I looked online saw falafel menu off sandwich  decent  Good crunchy outside soft inside felafel veggies fresh tomato bellpepper lettuce pickle sauce decent  fresh taste but needed some oomph some hot sauce  Good but best felafel town  sandwiches come fries okay  would think mediterranean place would them more seasoning yogurt dip but ended ketchup     We shared baklava $4 50 decent size square  came oddly slices apples but did kinda work syrup  baklava more fragrant rose water most which but phyllo wasn't crunchy undercooked    Service isn't most personable  Yes water refilled but another dining room clearly see staff sitting eating watching TV etc  When needed something wait until waitress decides come room    The price site actual menu changed $9 50 $11 50  much good fresh hike dinner prices specially sandwich pretty high  wasn't $11 50 worth sandwich  favorite felafel town $6     It good but think maybe lunch they until 3pm   seems majority rave reviews lunch crowd  Good food but value service during dinner  <EOR> The food excellent delicious healthy dining two years    consistently fabulous  Try lentil soup hummus jalapeños    the tilapia prepared five srar   the green beans favorite   shrimp scampi order extra garlic  The dolmas divine  Everything  delicious   quiet staff super friendly top when making sure receive top service  <EOR> Absolutely outstanding food   four us    two adults two kids arrived around 5pm early
