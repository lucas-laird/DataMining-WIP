Also good portion size ! <EOR> Came Veteran's day glad see open   looking forward trying soufflé which waiter informed takes approximately 10 minutes order basically knowing takes while make   ambience nice typical any other Filipino restaurant in   am fan Filipino food but few dishes like   ordered pork sisig sister ordered oxtail kare kare niece ordered calamari   When asked if dishes came rice waiter said did not   $2 extra rice   when started downhill     The calamari came first before other meals even though asked brought other dishes   big deal guess but shows much attention paid request   waiter then came inform making new batches white rice he asked if would garlic rice instead he would charge it   said fine    When food came excited try sisig   first bite however traumatizing   did know pork would sour!  very vinegary oily   never sisig before did know supposed taste but sour mind   more sour adobo   taste does grow but definitely needs rice egg came it   description flavor should menu   If apologize but missed it     As other food calamari alright while kare kare tender pieces oxtail sauce tasted weird   weird gray color instead bright orange brown   vegetables also gray vibrant very very oily   vegetables looked grilled but tasted deep fried   Before finished eating informed waiter wanted put order ube soufflé  when he told all soufflés   very disappointed that   ordered another dessert but great either     When reviewed bill noticed charged 2 sides white rice ordered   informed waiter he said yes he still charged rice but substituted garlic instead did charge garlic one   thought would happen but said fine whatever     Thankfully waiter nice enough take rice bill   wish he took dessert off bill well gave discount having items menu wanted     In summary service okay food however blah overpriced   Most likely back <EOR> First asked recommendation drink  waitress looked confused just wanted beer food pub right? She didn't know suggest then every time picked didn't anymore finally ordered crabbies ginger beer she brought regular when told wanted alcoholic didn't either  If don't anything drink menu suggestions would welcome but she still seemed lost  Okay whatever guess wasn't drinking food came everything seemed ok lumpia tasty but then bit into chicken wings neither past bite totally bad even smelled off  just wanted point took rest threw out  ROTTEN CHICKEN COOL  eaten lots subpar chicken wings but serving expired bad food just doesn't fly  Also just tip don't leave bathroom door right your entrance open especially when smells raw sewage  <EOR> Main course whatever expensive 20$ beefsteak seriously taste very impressing  give the  dessert but other look somewhere else <EOR> I LOVE PLACE  food service 10 10 couldn't any better!

However sisig itself think would give alternate dish future   Garlic fried rice staple home before could remember  grandparents would fill rooms aroma fresh garlic almost every day when young  version rice dinner comparable all  tasted if cooked dry rice bottled garlic  Definitely lacking lot flavor   Overall experience wasn't terrible  would definitely come back try again  Although next time think something little different pair 4 star bone marrow <EOR> Rating again bc recently started doing breakfast its just great dinner!

Cutting Board far exceeds other local Filipino restaurants  isn't single Filipino restaurant Las Vegas would compare  hard decide because almost everything menu looked yummy  beer selection impressive well   What ordered Escargot Spicy Coconut Bone Marrow Grilled Hamachi Collar Seafood Paella Squid ink they squid ink some type red sauce Crispy Pork Egg Sisig Lechon Ramen Noodles Soup Pork Sinigang Bibingka Souffle Bread Pudding  The escargot phenomenal bone marrow superb grilled Hamachi juicy served soy sauce side sisig die pork Sinigang kale really worked complimenting dish ramen tasted Lomi interesting but would probably still stick Monta when ramen craving deserts both OMG YASS!!!

Ps Lumpia slapppps!!! <EOR> I'm usually board try any restaurant  considered Gastropub   but when hear Filipino Gastropub definitely must try    FOOD trying several items menu really isn't lot different experimenting traditional Filipino dishes Asian fusion restaurant would have  However everything tried pretty solid  Bangus Sisig definitely favorite dish here  sizzle grease seasoning zest all perfectly executed  Fried fish  mixed bunch vegetables butter  served sizzling plate   Crispy Pata super fried pork legs tons flavor best dipped sauces  really liked flavor but meat little tough me  Kare Kare traditional flavor oxtail  perfectly cooked  vegetables side nice touch cause dip them Kare Kare sauce  The odd aspect restaurant basic white rice does automatically come dishes  only Asian restaurant ever doesn't give white rice free  But cool cause end having order Garlic Rice Seafood Fried Rice which both super tasty   They pretty unique drinks including cocktails Calamansi   little weak side though  Great beer list!  AMBIANCE The look could really cool gastropub   but feels more nice family restaurant  During visits DJ playing really loud music   actually little awkward necessary   SERVICE Awesome service   everyone very friendly welcoming  True Filipino hospitality!

Well basket maybe   Pancit Bami plentiful bounty meat veggies over well cooked pancit noodles   wished bit more umami flavor perhaps splash patis kalamansi but think  easy fix   really liked Adobo Fried Rice lot covered nice brown lacquer strong adobo flavor   doesn't salty slightly tart combo?
