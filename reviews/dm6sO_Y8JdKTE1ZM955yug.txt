For all understand urban slang money means 'of unusually high quality very good '  example Kobe Bryant money    whole menu actually rib eye options if don't want regular beef chicken pork shrimp   Bless hearts putting fatty rib eye gotta give them money!!  The server recommended grilled pork dish   Also money dish big pieces sliced grilled pork over bed Chinese broccoli   saucy dish any means very simple but very satisfying   Last recommendation crab curry   served three spirals rice noodles   Also money dish crab over powered curry   definitely essence crab if your thing   doesn't strong flavor used other curries panang instance   light dish would share friends wouldn't your main entree   The least money dish drunken noodles   Typical sweet noodley dish anywhere   would instead try three dishes mentioned earlier   Perfect example restaurant having decent rating lot reviews but still being excellent or should say money    Yelpers fooled reviews would next Thai restaurant hidden gem indeed  <EOR> We came because Lotus Siam way busy   outside looks hole wall Asian restaurant but inside surprises good way   service excellent   However food o k   better   part bothers most place portion size price   Just beware may feel full unless order more would normally other Thai restaurants! <EOR> What's tired work Vegan couple supposed when 11 30pm hankering Thai food?

Bring flashlight read menu  also huge wine selection Service efficient friendly  <EOR> Came warm Wednesday evening function restaurants inside Crystals   Only party dined previously she impressed time but wanted give them second chance    The restaurant interior low key but modern walls proudly displaying part wine collection another wall decorated framed fine wine labels   Pretty classy impression moderate interior decorating budget   The service good  parched but glass water refilled frequently without having ask wait staff do  looking over menu felt 1 4 eternity finally picked three items try dinner   My favorite probably Pad Hed Shitake Shimeji Mushroom Stir Fried Brussels Sprouts Lotus Root  Excellent!  first item disappeared table   We also tried Panang Curry Slow cook Beef Panang Curry   beef tender good flavor  Overall decent dish but nothing screams must tell everyone order this!    Last but least Pad Kee Mao Drunken Noodle Flat Rice Noodles Bird Eye Chili Garlic Basil Ground Pork   Decent but still wish portion larger     Taste 3 5 5 think key finding better menu items   Price Value 3 5 Average price but portion smaller side   Service 4 5 Did good job  3 5 stars   But think better job finding better items order future visits  <EOR> Were staying Henderson last year  valet asked if need any restaurant recommendations he suggested Chada  Didn't expect such elegant restaurant outside  great meal left happy tummy  visited Vegas again last week just come back  Panang curry great just remembered  They're famous duck curry  I opted salmon instead since pesco veggie wine selections great  definitely coming back if visit Vegas again  <EOR> Three 2 first timers Dark Porter Beer bottle Hexamer Riesling Oysters Lettuce wraps Green Papaya Salad Coconut Curry Duck Seabass along some other dishes mango dessert all perfect  let server choose trust well placed  Incredible spot  Easy recommend  place smelled great lighting just right service timing could better  Spotless bathroom super easy parking no wait table  Off the chart good  Best Thai food town best strip mall restaurant town sorry Lotus long shot Open late  Worth driving your way to <EOR> A little disappointed  hankering some Thai food wanted off strip place came highly recommended yelp thought couldn't wrong   eat Thai food often spent good deal time Thailand know flavors   feel food made suit local tastes did strong Thai flavors fact think food way salty   very average meal   other hand decor very nice wine list impressive  <EOR> Excellent off Strip dining choice Vegas  taxi ride run $20 Uber $16 but save more off Strip dinner prices   All food really good  initially appalled soups $10 each thinking would single appetizer portion am used Thai restaurants but Chada gave giant bowl soup offered four more portion each  herbal spring rolls favorite appetizer while crab lettuce wraps good didn't me   For main dish ordered something pork spicy delicious    As name would suggest Chada Thai Wine also pretty decent wine list particularly Thai place well 10 bottled beer options   Why only 4 stars? Two reasons restaurant understaffed service correspondingly slow  think might some sort accident like server calling last minute wouldn't let stop going back  Two food didn't arrive remotely same time awkward situation Should eat rude wait food cold? see latter issue originating kitchen   Do reservations tiny dining room fills quickly  <EOR> Thai food favorite cuisine doesn't better Chada   Every meal delicious flavorful cooked perfection   also best cold spring rolls ever   many bland but Chada's favorite   wine list IMPRESSIVE sure eat enough food Lotus LeThai Pin Kaow they all great but Chada #1 Las Vegas   just wish more tables! <EOR> I really hate give rating   Very nice restaurant but both soup entrees very bad   Pepper flavored pork dish overbearing Pepper tasted terrible   Tom Kha sour ordered extra spicy no heat spice it   know Thai food really wanted place because cool restaurant   think need back try few other things someday  <EOR> I stumbled upon place few years ago introduced all friends it  simply best!!! never bad experience here  fact all special occasions birthday birthday Valentine's Day we already made reservation year! anniversary   It really just good  best part while awesome place special occasions romantic awesome reasonably priced random weeknight just because craving Thai!
