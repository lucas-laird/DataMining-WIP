Stop dessert! <EOR> nternet sitesinde calma saatleri 4 pm 4 am yaziyor 30 miles yol yapip gittikten sonra kapal olmas tam bir hayal krkl acilen saatlerini web sitenizden duzeltmelisiniz   ! Dont open restaurant night time   <EOR> Years ago Egypt man told someone gave bad eyes  figure he's talking glasses     nodded explained yes them Dad   No    BAD eyes   glasses?  No  Someone made sick  tummy sick  Ohwait! Yes some guy pyramids put evil eye me  host nodded satisfaction    If only I'd eaten Ibo's first would never happened  During dinner Mr Ibo gave little evil eye protection bracelet    If I'd never found front door I'd luck too  We drove around bit figure still figured wrongly  My guest ordered mezze platter which some delicious baba ganoush some decent stuffed grape leaves wonderful eggplant salad some other tasty bits    We mixed grill deliciously seasoned chicken lamb beef lovely orange pilaf   None food totally blew away  All very good  But prices spendy lunch prices ridiculously spendy meaning any different dinner  The average entree $20 average appetizer $9  interior restaurant bigger probably fancier should called for    If place more reasonably priced I'd loved it  But price point other options you're far off places Rosemary's offer better value   I want see city more independent restaurants offerings other sushi bar food Italian Thai  want see innovative ethnic restaurants thrives  But sure if Ibo's right mix happen even though hope he does  <EOR> First big first menu changed    NO LONGER TURKISH MEDITERRANEAN   didn't know until seated looked menu   We greeted very warmly owner whose name happens Ibo   main dining room just beautiful perfect lighting candles tables covered white tablecloths over skirts large banquettes around perimeter attractive heavy menus   But alas virtually no Turkish food except usual hummus babaganoush appetizers kofta beef chicken dish called Istanbul Chicken but nothing remotely related Istanbul   When asked waiter he explained owner made business decision change because Turkish wasn't bringing customers unused such cuisine decided steakhouse   But lighted sign above restaurant original IMO losing proposition owner those thinking Turkish won't come because strange those know love Turkish food won't return because not!  I asked wine list dismayed see crossed $7 barrier glass wine less $8 $8 50 most more   two couples other couple decided forgo wine   husband told waiter weren't going pay $8 50 glass Riesling started hand back menu   He then offered charge $7 glass   didn't know could bargain wine!  We munched excellent bread while waiting entrees   Choosing entrees wasn't easy since hadn't expecting choosing steak Italian dishes but settled two Istanbul chicken kofte kasseri cheese rainbow trout   Entrees served lentil soup salad garlic mashed fresh vegetables   all salad comprised mixed greens some shredded carrot chopped tomatoes choice three ordinary dressings   salad very fresh good sized portion   When waiter brought entrees he told friend careful because she might find bones fileted trout   full bones she send back   Both men ordered chicken butter sauce side   dish consisted thick slices chicken rolled around spinach carrot filling   wasn't enough filling because chicken hadn't heated sauce quite dry   friend substituted same chicken bony trout she forgot specify butter side waiter didn't think ask came covered sauce   may chock full calories but much moister   My Kofte large portion five patties each slightly larger you'd find slider ground beef   tasty but bland lacking necessary black pepper distinguishes ordinary burger   But forgotten kasseri cheese equivalent parmesan also added lot salt much taste though many others wouldn't think so   The big disappointment dishes sides mashed veggies cold   told owner stopped check table   He apologized profusely returned few moments later plate filled four scoops hot mashed potatoes lots same nice vegetables but well heated   Only when lounge which completely separate main dining room did see scrolling sign over bar indicating Ibo's Steak House  shame!  Las Vegas which quite few Mediterranean restaurants really could used good Turkish one   Ibo's if ever no longer     In summation ambience very beautiful   outdoor patio quite large would oh inviting if weather warmer   lounge bar attractive also filled tables banquettes equipped provide live music which wasn't Saturday night visit   don't know if ever it   owner friendly very eager please   But without ethnic differentiation just lovely setting good mediocre food nothing else distinguish hundreds others Vegas   Except huge rent due sheer size place probably render review obsolete within few months  <EOR> Not Turkish restaurant  when created bad reputation Turkish food  sure steak retaurant now sure same owner anymore    <EOR> Terrible food   no background music playing restaurant once sat down could hear people's conversations across room   Midway through meal random woman street came asked money!!  No return ever! <EOR> Loved atmosphere! BEAUTIFUL walk way restaurant sparkling pavement lights  Interior also very tasteful great decor! lights just right dim bright  LOVED  flame less candles adorning all tables!   Now good   I came restaurant expecting authentic Turkish fair some American steak house instead! wish some kind announcement online when looked menu wouldn't expected Turkish food   I guess part fault should read Yelp before D   At first bread olive oil vinegar blend  bread good but best  oil dip bit thick vinegar  Hummus average friend commented tasted just store bought  thought little better but still great  Calamari excellent  Mediterranean salad very heavy cheese which didn't like  vegetables tasted fresh but all cheese distracted flavors  Turkish pudding dessert one few remaining Turkish dishes tasty but nothing ground breaking  $7 95 small piece seemed little steep  Overall prices reasonable however caliber restaurant   Service nice overbearing helpful   On way noticed steaks other patrons looked very pink undercooked  did look appetizing all  course she could ordered way     Overall loved atmosphere service  Food mediocre  am sure would loved Turkish fair but certainly impressed steakhouse food  felt little deceived process well  probably won't back here  <EOR> I Ibo lunch couple coworkers  ordered lunch specials  $9 95 lunch special lets choose salad appetizer entree  $14 95 same plus glass wine dessert    We all ordered different things try them all  Mediterranean Salad delicious very nice portion  hummus tasty nice balance garlic spices  haydari fave mine  really thick little bitter  spinach Borek very tasty yet lacked crispiness phyllo  seemed if heated microwave  grilled Salmon entree cooked perfection! outside perfectly crisped grill marks inside moist delicious  disappointed didn't come sauteed spinach stated menu but instead came steamed veggies  sauteed leeks under piece salmon divine  only complaint would portion  small piece salmon completely hid leeks but once found them heaven! rice standard rice nothing rave about  poached apricots filled cremefraiche delightful  baklava would better if again phyllo crispier    The decor place very rich extravagant  problem lunch seated bar area which wreaked cigar cigarette smoke  able past but coworkers very bothered it    The service so so  guy seated looked patron t shirt Bermuda shorts  waitress equally dressed down wearing daisy dukes random t shirt  3 other tables she tending sort understood why service bit slow  thing really struck odd when host maitre de brought refill bread  almost finished other basket bread but course fresh stuff when he put table  waitress then came table said supposed other table picked gave them! hands all over bread! Why wouldn't she just another basket? literally 2 pieces left basket covered cloth course  <EOR>
