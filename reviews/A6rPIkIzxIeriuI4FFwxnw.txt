He asks special last 2 weeks? said yes  He tells lucky  He says owner put something computer doesn't allow them override would charge higher rate  If  true then did deal less then 2 weeks prior? pizza decent honestly wings under seasoned usually add seasoning when them  continued order because convenient chicken always cooked right under cooked over cooked but charge much  last order over $50 2 pizzas 40 wings 2 liter pepsi which driver back because he forgot it  customer service today terrible very unprofessional  guy phone argumentative  won't ordering again due poor customer service alone  way NOTHING menu says NO SUBSTITUTIONS  <EOR> This another place yelp didn't fail all!   We going lunch but wanted sit down decided only problem place seating    After reading reviews again decided ahead take must say mistake  Joey's special pizza great best pizza far Las Vegas had  Even more amazing fact just plain pizza also looked tasted excellent fresh ingredients all very good  highly recommend it  <EOR> They said food would ready 30 minutes    which really good about   but now 50 minutes chicken wings still cooking  ordered family pack deal #2    it's 12 30 pm chicken wings couldn't complete order  told girl substitute some chicken fingers girl said would cost more  Very young inexperienced people working hour no customer service skills  While standing waiting patiently order    another gentleman came order girl told waiting cheese cook pizza food awhile  Why open today if no food??? <EOR> Very good pizza calzones   Called order when arrived everything ready hot   Prices really good definitely order again  <EOR> An Adventure!  Best pizza town! getting half adventure rest gps going berserk spitting other side town   But  review about!  Ordered Joey's Famous Home Run but reheated temporary navigational fail still tasted great fresh! some lightly burnt parts That garlic alfredo sauce really hits spot cheddar cheese adds great flavor! It'd boring if only mozarella right? entire pizza combination compliments itself!  Great value money since prices already factor taxes you're getting more taste your dollar!   Definitely going try more combinations when urge cheese strikes again! <EOR> I ordered mushrooms olives sausage    I hard time finding any mushrooms sausage   Might well Little Caesars cheese pizza  <EOR> Called order specials said no chicken fingers asked if could more wings stead said no  all time kidding horrible customer service    going anymore   Bunch jerks    <EOR> My family going Joey's pizza over 9 years best pizza ever they're always time always friendly <EOR> The pizza so so  some minor hiccups area very minor  But    the stromboli  word outstanding  bad boy bigger forearm  highly recommend Classic  Filled exploding pepperoni ham mozzarella cheddar   and sauce! If love stromboli does disappoint  If featured The Godfather instead canolli would gunfight over baby! <EOR> I joeys nellis order 10 inch ground beef pineapple pizza wings great  taste fresh homemade taste it  love joeys would recommend all pizza lovers las vegas nv <EOR> Apparently folks Joey's Pizza read signs displayed around Stallion Mountain community clearly state solicitation allowed   Furthermore shoving your menu through front door setting off canine alarm system very unappreciated although good proof its effectiveness      Your menu immediately into trash now never patronize your establishment no matter good your pizza appears be  <EOR> I finally chance try burger fries combo here   burger pretty small fries just average   burgers better Angelina's much better   Actually feel best burgers East Side town   But digress review Joey's   pizza still favorite though   yelp check deal which saves 10% your bill   bonus  <EOR> we order all time  yesterday ordered Vegetarian Joeys Deluxe  45 00 worth pizza! called complain terrible no cheese no veggies no meat worth money! lousy customer service even offered take pic awful pizza send bad! she said Manager would call back! dont bother LAST TIME JOEYS GETS MONEY!
