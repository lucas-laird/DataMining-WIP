But say ingredients shrimp lemongrass super fresh     The pho tai came bowl huge!  Tons noodles which dig   But alas must come point why gave 4 stars   wasn't lot meat which bummer   But more bummer NO ambiance place   could felt little less weird if music tv any distraction besides being only person inhaling peanut sauce taking pictures food   Ok maybe little weird but someone should bring folks boom box   might suggest bringing your own Mp3 speakers making party?    All all good pho awesome summer rolls come back when pho craving returns vegas     Oh way total summer rolls hot tea pho tai   $10 45!!!
