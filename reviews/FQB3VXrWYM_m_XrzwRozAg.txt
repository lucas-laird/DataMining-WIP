Quality food meats low  worth price friends expected average star rating  gave two stars because staff very courteous  <EOR> Brought friends Sura today  Would recommend place  meats tough fresh including shrimp  good value your money ay 25 99 per person  Did enjoy food   Would back  <EOR> If haven't Korean BBQ yet you're missing life  #justsayin  It's pretty big Korean BBQ place Plenty tables  fancy just most Asian restaurants   place open until 3 00 AM $20 person  All meat raw bring back your table where spot middle cook it  always bulgogi marinated beef spicy marinated pork  kalbi good but comes bones difficult eat chopsticks  also all available small dishes kimchee marianted cucumber noodles mung beans other korean delights  Also finish off ginger drink dessert section  weird first time try but always crave when eat now   www anitaeat com <EOR> I've many KBBQ places  LOVE getting AYCE bargains but just disappointing  city known quality food cheap prices just doesn't cut mustard  selection meat wasn't impressive price selection much  better options most KBBQ places around L A  quite lot cheaper  many sides which made bit better but lacked essential side dish  no steamed egg  Truth told probably wont again  <EOR> shame restaurant  saw video family getting kicked just because waitress thinks they're eating meat way should complaining only grabbled short ribs nothing else  far concerned its BUFFET you're entitled whatever want long pay    Change yours ways you'll business  Its only matter time since guys started cycle  <EOR> Prices way up!  remember place used 22 bucks per person now $29 bucks ayce  charge half price kids over 2 years old which pretty hefty   If you're brisket eater place isn't you  slice brisket super thick  marinated galbi super sweet all other meats super thick which fills quickly  flavoring meat isn't good banchans limited  <EOR> Not service oriented place    Much higher prices other Pho places to     family did Pho  <EOR> Most AYCE KBBQ places servers coming back forth thinly sliced meats banchan  But hey why wait when just serve yourself?  Sura BBQ buffet brisket bulgogi pork belly goodness your favorite banchan  clearly won't getting wagyu beef but when meat hits hot grill all forgotten delectable aroma juicy tender slices sizzilng meat  Other proteins include chicken galbi short ribs roasted baked fish  typically found side dish Korean restaurants   The banchan no longer limited those miniscule circular dishes! If need carbs huge pots rice white brown salad  soups such kimchi stew beef radish soup rotate daily basis  offer some Chinese dishes some sushi tempura well  much dessert besides some fruit cut jello but refreshing end meat massacre  If you're daring ladle some persimmon cinnamon drink known soojeonggwa then water down bit  stuff packs punch!

Well new favorite place eat Las Vegas  don't eat but you've gots try it  <EOR> Awesome good food  price good too  Service ok  good selections beef without marinate  best Korean BBQ far tried town  Would definitely come back  <EOR> We stop every time visit Vegas but last time   They've raised prices food just isn't good remember   all Korean meats could ask but seasoned right tell meat lower quality its tender should be   it's still very tough especially meats aren't marinated  So here's kicker   wait staff keeps track many plates meat bring back table   exact amounts   so if left overs argue much justify charging extra $5 each person your table even if person leftovers   Doesn't matter if there's something wrong food not    My wife accidentally beef tongue instead beef brisket   buffet line look very similar   frozen then thinly shaved same color texture etc   She grabbed some thinking brisket but soon realized she cooked ate piece   tried explain mistake waitress turn said seen grab 3 plates other meat you're just full charge you   even tried explain them both right next each other look same hence mistake   I think purpose actually   I'm Korean lived Korea never seen beef tongue grilled this   ever   sure others made same mistake  After some heated exchanges between wife waitress charged $5 mistake but kept blaming bringing fact much other meat got   I think track per table   ticked wife off never want piss off Korean woman   also said should charging $5 per person total $25 but acted taking care only charging $5   serving meat left over uncooked plate   Probably costed them $1 less   also first meat wife wasn't end    So needless say wife didn't care   we left without even finishing still cooking grill   end she's Korean getting charged $5 cheaper paying tip    A little more understanding waitress' part could better   seems place going under soon   Saturday night wasn't busy all   in past years place usually packed    I recommend pass hit casino buffets   you'll better service better quality food   writing morning stomach still feels awful although didn't eat very much    One more thing   I've authentic Korean food Korea   what serve now may look Korean food especially side dishes but flavor all off watered down put only 1 4 seasoning required    If decide reading you've warned  <EOR> I personally enjoyed experiences here  love briskets cooking meat  little overpriced but buffet  Definitely better Tofu Hut opinion but could more choices  Overall bad place but nothing phenomenal either <EOR> The only good item limited menu short ribs  Everything else bad worse  pricy quality choices felt rip off  <EOR> After reading everyone's reviews Sura eager try  just recently come back state side visit Korea wanted continue Korean dining experience  must say somewhat disappointed Sura should say reading reviews Yelp higher expectations   For starters problems seasoning meat  think beef ribeye well chicken  ribeye no distinct flavor ever  first thought but colleague made same comment beef  Unlike beef chicken quite flavorful  fact good back seconds   Another problem food already prepared  food cold  wasn't even lukewarm  would much more enjoyable if every thing few degrees warmer   Thirdly maybe different selections different days but very disappointed selection desert  quite disappointed see jello main desert  did another selection desert  Quite honestly don't remember but wasn't great   The last biggest problem Sura price  Considering all mentioned didn't feel dining experience worth price paid buffet  wasn't exorbitant amount but 50 00 two people quite disappointed  But know don't frequent many Korean restaurants all but frequent many asian restaurants disappointed  <EOR> Great loved it! good selection Korean food  Sushi average though  Great service  <EOR> Really now?! mold meats guys checked recently?  Rice old soggy  Plates barely cleaned  expected when comes fine dining  <EOR> Don't take your kids unless eat adults  charge same kids 8+ adults 5+ charge half price even three plus pay  wife four kids two 10 yo 6 two yo $135!!!! much buffet <EOR> Great place! being able grab own meat able eat own pace wait someone bring suggest should eat first   I small kid me    Overpriced  Minus star   I'm all meat  However would nice some tasty must sides  <EOR> Good prices!!  All eat 15 16 bucks per person weekday afternoon  But dinner prices weekend prices shoot 25 bucks per person   Is worth it? is   Lots meat choices lots sides  opportunity try little bits different things might order heapfuls non buffet  normally just Kalbi ribs pork but tried piece Beef Intestine LOVED it   I wasn't love potato salad soups but ya know all eat much cheaper normal DJK down street still love Sura   I definitely come back million times! <EOR> Came because told place great     Came greeted right away   and sat down   He asked would eat told new asked worked he said don't worry he would explain took drink order   He then told follow buffet line   He said middle section raw food rest okay cook ahead serve ourselves   explanation   then again more need     So took Seaweed Salad kimchi of course! white kimchi potato salad daikon carrot combo bean sprouts side dishes   BBQ only tried two different types meat   Short Rib Bulgogi   else need? only two really but maybe next time take little other selection   they pork belly marinated pork marinated chicken few other type meat   wasn't much varierty but don't really think need it   also sushi which tried fish other already cooked items   also small salad bar   notice jello bar fruit   only took some garlic cloves lettuce leafs wrap BBQ didn't notice any rice but AYCE maybe eating rice isn't such good thing So Short Ribs awesome!  Favorite two   falls bone    didn't really bite into much meat off bones which nice   wasn't marinated under marinated   wasn't spicy over salted anything    Bulgogi   I felt better   Although notice once cook shrinks lot   But wasn't chewy good flavor   just wish little more kick something   Maybe because ate ribs first   and stronger favor   The side dishes though didn't like   kimchi awesome   it spicy kick it   Potato Salad bland   Seaweed salad well   But Korean BBQ place eats those?  Maybe just me   Sushi lacking wasn't bad but rather focus BBQ next time visit   course sushi sitting sheet plastic wrap over it   but try it   Okay back sides sprouts weird taste   and felt probably marinated mixed some spices wasn't used to   awhile eating sprouts though started maybe used it   White Kimchi pretty much fermented cabbage   maybe fermented word   it soured bit   wasn't spicy cools tongue   nice eating spicy kimchi     Overall place good   cheaper Lunch believe $15 99?  $24 99 dinner   bad especially since AYCE   Just sucks because don't eat much but worth try better place tried before   told dessert station didn't see but next time find it  <EOR> just looking since moving Vegas CA some 7 yrs ago   shame looking harder! <EOR> They don't only serve Korean BBQ tons cooked dishes well   tons meat Bulgogi marinated short ribs spicy marinated pork belly pork belly rib eyes pork chicken shrimp squid   waitresses great!  stopped Sunday around noon   place busy   Thought going lunch price $14 99   total bill over $50 + tip   If mistaken $22 99 per person   very high lunch   Maybe because Sunday   Should done more research before went   Overall great experience  food delicious staff very friendly helpful  definitely back next time Vegas  <EOR> Lots different varieties including raw meats cook yourself cooked food fish pancakes cold dishes i e kimchi cucumber seaweed salad soups vegetables fruits etc  but am impressed all  prefer all eat restaurants provide quality food rather quantity  Meats weren't fresh all  When took marinate source beef color dark gray  am sure source color color beef     cooked dishes weren't good either  find dishes come meal any Korean restaurants better quality     There many Korean BBQ town Sura again  <EOR> The place good good selection meat well other foods already prepared  Service alright   If you're culinary savy might little nervous when see raw meat buffet area  bothered little bit but anyway   Overall pretty good slightly higher price worth it  <EOR> For Vegas provides good value  All eat Korean BBQ fair but limited desert selections  Also charge full price children over 8  Place easy find few miles main Asian strip restaurants but could recommend exploring elsewhere  <EOR> Great service hands down  girlfriend dinner  good selection food  point during meal asked server good he grab marinated pork brisket told try one  good spicy  made sure drinks filled came just enough sure everything going great  would back but maybe lunch  bit pricey but service selection food made it  <EOR> Sura buffet style really glad tried place   Its great if don't having wait take your order    just everything want grill yourself   $20  sorts different meat poultry seafood   course favs squid shrimp kalbi ribs rib eye   Everything marinated well when cooked still very tender   only reason why gave 4 because really enjoy banchan side dishes didn't big selection but did some favs cuccumbers bean sprouts   would again! <EOR> I love place   love korean bbq general already some stiff competition   Its all night all eat korean bbq restaurant buffet style   meat always great plenty variety other dishes well   Granted if come 2 morning expect fried chicken sushi fresh would 2pm disappointed   But needs when all meat rice sides want?

I Dad couple months back  trying find good place eat before headed back Los Angeles  Dad said pretty good in   The waitress came over asked would drink Dad asked some jasmine tea if any waitress turned nose air said KOREAN restaurant CHINESE! Ok lady Japanese but difference does make? If Chinese then would no doubt offended tone disgust  She sashayed away leaving mouth open disbelief    The food itself unique self serve buffet instead ordering waitress  When started cooking vent broken turned which left cloud smoke  waitress ignored repeated attempt attention finally she said doesn't work table  Then why did seat here???  The food mediocre best pricing  service just made outright terrible  Hate leave negative reviews small businesses but customer service everything definitely did here  <EOR> At roughly $24 person would probably expect satisfying meal  However place does give satisfaction  three very hungry guys cross country road trip LA NYC when stopped Las Vegas some chow  know feeling when you're hungry even bad food tastes good? Yeah  doesn't work here  food must special kind bad still taste crap three very hungry guys    The selection very paltry  meats did seem fresh which fact weren't  Shit even fruits tasteless  several women joint could least some enjoyment playing She Escort Not? game   My whole entourage drive Las Vegas Chicago while fighting urge expel liquefied human excrement approximately 78% food coming Sura BBQ while wearing five layers because damn Polar Vortex taking place  received all sorts crap figuratively being recommended place them judging Yelp reviews  If gave place anything higher star likely led demise  Please reproduce   Please attempt ingest anything establishment unless you 1 auditioning next season Fear Factor  2 fervent death wish  3 wish try dining options worse those served state penitentiary  4 preparing yourself backpacking tour through South East Asia  5 think your current weight loss program isn't working out   Avoid place all costs! <EOR> My buddy ventured off Strip food yesterday decided try Sura   plenty food options Chinatown but chose Sura because AYCE restaurant hungry   thought great buffet option because focused just Korean food well    It's short trip Strip well worth it   buffet affordable parking plentiful  <EOR> I recently ate lunch! can't decide if better Woochee but Sura definitely good!   The price higher Woochee but atmosphere bigger ceilings higher which don't walk smelling BBQ   The grill little smaller round  servers change grills when gets filthy clean napkins    I love selection meat seafood side dishes  only thing didn't rock sea salt love dip pork belly in    Other Woochee Sura tied book! <EOR> Ah junk place  Hahaha  No only kidding  Just didn't want wait 1 hr again   Honestly usually fan style dining because don't think should paying $20 something per person restaurant cook own meals especially if hungry $20+I'd AYCE sushi nice buffet curving station but again they're only $25 which little cheaper other few here   There lots parking seating maybe couple 100s but extremely busy days maybe wait   All those meat when cooked might fine meal 2  Ingredients seemed fresh higher quality few others to   grills easy use clean   seasons table may need tending to  venting a c good  Service OK  Priced cheaper get  Theres both cooked uncooked food salads veggies alcohol non alcohol drink  better AYCE Korean BBQ businesses town  <EOR> We took cab off strip place    All eat Korean food which cook yourself table     I thought food good but selection small $26 per person   decor needs much upgrading well   Service friendly informative but when ready leave needed cab   waiter called asking whether mattered whether cab American Korean   he should asked whether cared if cab legal illegal   ok until driver charged double cost Strip restaurant   felt duped should simply happened   Watch yourself  <EOR> My sister decided give place try lunch glad did  Great personable service great tasty food!

But  really all dessert here  even selection cakes cookies  If you're fruit person some peaches oranges but  it   I also little bit put off when served hot tea tall  PLASTIC cup  Really? first time ever encountered restaurant    The atmosphere? hated it   felt stifled dim crowded music less atmosphere wasn't friendly fun kinda atmosphere would expect  would expect weekend but Tuesday evening?   The servers deal breaker plenty them but them smiled even looked us  Each them looked hurry engrossed jobs bothered  could've asked if doing okay point even when meats burning  Maybe communicating hard them but least try  paying $24 95 just food  also expecting good service if paying much  eating seemed server wanted leave fast possible  Which very unhappy about    For price paid place don't think worth every penny  could've picked random Korean restaurant food atmosphere service would've much better compared place    This place actually deserves 1 star but because several meat seafood variety added more star  Maybe future experience better which case write another review rate better but really don't think eating anytime soon  Trust you'll your money's worth eating different Korean restaurant  <EOR> Decent selection raw meat decent selection prepared food soups  radish beef soup favorite along many other various types meat!

You pick many sides want skip ones don't  choose pieces meat much want then bring table  Right when seated host turned grill lit lighter! Awesome! only different beefs pork  Kalbi Bulgogi favorites  set meat grill no time waiter side flipping cooking meat us!

I want Sura but can't if keep getting sick  might try again future hope gets better but now say elsewhere your kbbq needs  <EOR> I haven't eaten all Korean places Vegas but favorite AYCE  Everything very clean orderly   wasn't very noisy servers very personable   When Vegas want AYCE Korean BBQ head back Sura  <EOR> Sura BBQ just okay  I'd rather Tofu Hut  only good thing Sura  better Tofu hut fact grab your own meat instead having wait  also fact other foods choose such sushi fried rice egg rolls  Overall quality overrules quantity especially if you're going pay around same price  Sorry Sura  <EOR> Food fresh delicious  Spicy pork belly ribeye favorites  barley tea cinnamon tea exceptional  Super friendly fast service  back  <EOR> Pretty awesome  First time kbbq place where self serve  Good assortment food well  Pretty big place lot people could come  Also open till decent hour  Glad found place  <EOR> A cook your own place  area good place big enough smoke wouldn't bother you  Servers really nice too  <EOR> Excellent service  Decent food  Clean  But little pricey selections offer  <EOR> The price gone AYCE Korean grill but still worth such variety food chose from   ribeye best very fresh tender   If plate full just alone would worth price buffet $23 00    other meats good but would avoid having shrimp very fresh   hot menu items also quite good too   soups very flavorful other hot desserts  Oh pass sushi rice full   Eat sushi kimbap elsewhere  <EOR> My friends Sura 4th July  skeptical first coz place less half full  However hungry decided eat anyway  food amazing  Everything fresh delicious  paid $32 person including tax tip  <EOR> So use favorites but trying few them definitely feel top   selection ok most part enjoy getting food myself   price pretty high  specifically dinner   meat some days amazing others just ok   service fine   Nothing super special it   ventilation system very good   cooked food meh worthy but again its kbbq place raw meat cook yourself   fan salad choices but know many kbbq places around just middle   terrible but great  <EOR> Really another AYCE Vegas?

Pork Ear Salad Beef Tendon Salad Pickled Zucchini Stewed Pork Belly much more   3 types soups white rice mix bean rice   same ol' same ol' other KBBQ find Orange County San Diego but quality well beyond expected   lunch meat options same listed full dinner meat options but all typical lunch meat grilling   Everything very tender perfectly marinated salty sweet     So next time travel down Las Vegas Blvd  far u turn back around hit little China Town Sura BBQ   beats 'biggest KBBQ' several buffet lines  <EOR> The meat quality good know more expensive then tofu hut some other places but worth money pick whatever want your seat right away save lot time  used others lot since cheaper but always waited 1hr sometimes ever longer just ridiculous  just pay lil more money better food n service  <EOR> I no idea little gem even existed!!! glad found because sure visit again soon!  Sura Korean BBQ same concept every other Korean BBQ but cool thing place buffet style just grab your proteins choice sides kimchi kimchi radish rice cucumber Mac salad etc   take them your table start cookin'!  There's pretty good selection proteins such as shrimp heads still my favorite holds much more flavor Kalbi ribs chicken beef tongue ribs crab thin steak slices other choices couldn't fit plate The seasoning pretty subtle though sure add some shoyu proteins cook! did forget grab silver ware tongs must also grab then yourself  thought would've set table but no    only thing servers refill your beverage cup take away any dirty plates   fine me  dessert selection pretty plain consisting jello oranges but once your done your partial self made meal dessert isn't even option!  I mention though sure grab much devour cashier charge extra $5 anything leftover  Dinner $30pp believe Also although proteins seem they're replaced continuously may best quality because lot meats seemed pretty fatty chewy    No because didn't grill correctly  Overall really did enjoy place  wait staff ok best since waitress left few times while asking questions    But overall good   Great time bring friends family since booths spacious! Only downfall    smell BBQ pit once your So try place out!!! <EOR> not big fan kbbq but lots selection fairly cheap good service always drinks filled rim <EOR> We haven't back awhile since quality meat gone down   selection banchan vegetable side dishes etc  great load your plate lots healthy veggies   also sushi fish soups fruits even if meat quality gone down little other foods offered still great value  <EOR> I've few times each experience typically same   For those never done Korean BBQ before pretty much choose your meats side dishes buffet style then grill meat    Pros Good variety food Buffet style grab food please don't wait your order meat which ironically con below Servers sporadically check sure grill working   Cons much dessert selection Some meat items aren't fresh since sitting out little pricey compared other Korean BBQ places  Overall pretty satisfied when leave restaurant    usually overstuffed! But can't complain <EOR> I place flavorful cold noodle soup summer all buffet items amazing  don't eat sushi can't comment but service good   Meats flavored good! David good server  Camsamyeda lol <EOR> Loved idea Korean BBQ buffet which never seen before  quality food generally OK although best selection display  Frankly hurt review most unattractiveness buffet itself less fresh quality few food items   That being said still enjoyable  let take control BBQ thus able let chicken burnt crisp just it  selection banchan cold appetizery things buffet decent but extraordinary  also enjoyed being able take two bowls cold cinnamon y soup dessert    Yum    wish place far away me  Glad off strip came here  <EOR> For $25 think worth it  mean if eat lot meat then yes  Really good food cook your own  lot food choose from  Fast service good customer service  Overall A+ restaurant!!! <EOR> Don't come high expectations    nothing much other pretty small buffet limited options  Meat wasn't marinated best but hey if want skip lines Vegas might well some KBBQ!  Alongside meats choose sushi fried rice other stir fry tempura  tried pretty much all meats but nothing would want again  Dessert limited jello fruits glazed sweet potatoes  Service bit slow definitely ktown  Located 5 minute drive strip  <EOR> The food tasted OK   service soso   reason 3 stars price charge could better selection food should really bring instead having yourself  <EOR> Great table side Korean BBQ  buffet sample range proteins cook table  also number cooked items but best BBQ cooked table side   Also nice selection soups try  kimchi soup great   Speaking kimchi made fresh shows  red kimchi medium heat white if spicy food  But try it    I come again next trip LV  <EOR> I've few all eat Korean BBQ places Las Vegas must say best yet   serve most popular marinated beef pork chicken seafood   Pretty much something everyone except maybe vegans     For those familiar all eat Korean Style BBQ pretty much grab whatever ever much meat want take back your table cook   Which some people may may because sense cooking serving self   bright side basically pulling meat off grill cooked want doesn't much hot fresher that     They also various prepared food grab off line   remember seeing steamed rice fried rice various kim chi sushi all other various Korean side dish items   Overall if quite appetite delicious Korean BBQ don't mind cooking your own meat would recommend place you  <EOR> Meats ample pork beef squid chicken  Lots kimchee some sushi some cooked Korean goodies soup salad  best marinated meat flavors Korean BBQ but good bang buck if Korean BBQ  ready work you BBQ your own meats your table's grill  spent $40 bucks two people  <EOR> I love korean BBQ love Sura's style concept   restaurant buffet style  pick meats dishes wish bring back your table grill  server bring drinks clean your grill ever often    The food isn't bad but isn't great  might find some pieces meet still frozen if pick middle tray    I restroom while eating witnessed employee leaving stalls without washing hands only later see behind buffet line serving meat   True story    I disgusted wanted return back stall puke    Since Sura's AYCE menu around same price others town   I'd elsewhere especially using restrooms  <EOR> I talked gf $5 lil arepas spot place seeing yelp letdown  Worst food experience 5 days here  dont love korean food bbq  Just everything alright if regrettable let down taste meats love pork belly just Love bulkgogi here  the seeweed mayo them 2 stars  and shrimp cooked seasoned 10 them left 9 half plate    I pissed hours left especially asking looking prices $57 bill   No wonder kind nice waitress asked leaving already? thats all? yes im leaving thats all   dont better around town  major letdown felt slot machine wont hit feeling  robbed dissapointed mad    <EOR> If feel eating Korean food favorite places to   selection food quite impressive   Moreover experience selecting then cooking food right table cool experience highly suggest   might hot inside times but end you'll glad experience   mention you'll agree food yummy your tummy! <EOR> The staff definitely highlights restaurant being very personable nice while also taking care everything  food delicious high quality establishment clean  Overall left very good experience happy family full stomach all good price!

Although prefer cuts meat Honey Pig service attitude very unappealing enter Sura    At first did choices meat but more ate more grew me  only gave them 4 stars because think should add rib eye cubes selection  variety far nonbbq food items also excellent  fish buffet essentials such orange chicken  Also thought selection different soups pretty awesome    The service much better Honey Pigs need more servers but service bad  might just little stack plates piling up   Pricing think pretty fair  little expensive dinner but bad taking account much eat  Tofu hut also good alternative price think serves slightly better quality meat cuts  Service though suffers    Overall sura pretty good place come try Korean BBQ  Seating spacious lots choices service adequate  <EOR> Best place since opening original Korean all eat buffet   service servers nice prices very reasonable  despite all other competitions Definately 1 put 3 favorite spots   <EOR> I recently traveling coming Los Angeles roadtrip decided through Las Vegas  looked through reviews came upon place  LOVE KOREAN FOOD  because buffet decided give chance   Upon walking ambience nice  came Saturday hour opened  immediately smelled meat automatically it    BUT food lof variety  understand lunch but $26 buffet expecting ALOT more  8 different kind meats 10 different sides banchan     The meat OK  ALOT better bulgogi but must admit spicy pork belly best    The sushi very plain also chinese food but really plain tasting no 'outstanding' taste    The waitress kind mean attitude while  She would NEVER come table made feel bad when asked stuff    There barely any desert either    Overall food OK but price wish would gone LAS VEGAS strip buffet worth money better selection food   Price $26 just don't think worth it  BUFFET STRIP same prices better selection  <EOR> Don't wrong absolutely love downtown LA KBBQ   But sorry    Sura just tad bit better   First off CLEAN restaurant LARGE nice variety food appealing!  price right around $23 person all eat  Food your selection rear restaurant   Everything hand picked your own  Good amount different types meats sushi vegetables fruits fish rice soups etc  choose wisely!  warn customers if waste charge it  Roomy seating don't afraid large group  Order your beverages attentive servers   Lastly any AYCE joint sure build appetite prior arrival HUNGRY ready eat! <EOR> Buffet style AYCE Korean BBQ   They average selection cooked uncooked foods sides  I think 8 9 different types banchaan same number different marinated non marinated meats including shrimp cows tongue   banchaan meats turned over replinshed regularly due constant stream people grabbing huge plate fulls back tables     The salad dessert bar selection wasn't great   onion salad lot romaine mixed in   few selections resh fruit rounded salad bar   didn't pay much attention cooked food portion buffet line   2 3 choices when comes soup regular rice rice beans meats banchaans   Freindly efficient service always kept ice tea full   interior roomy high ceiling   coupled powerful exhaust fans kept smoke minimium  Increased selection banchaan meats along more green onions onion salad would earn place more stars    bad place Korean BBQ but spectacular either  <EOR> I'm sure people give place high rating  Food gross obviously poor quality  health standards place highly questionable  ended walking once saw food  Never coming back  <EOR> I love meat BBQ much next guy but WOW   Sura BBQ meaty overload!

Jackpot   Came pretty late Friday night family straight airport  pretty surprised many choices meats both marinated raw kalbi bulgogi etc  also choose your preferred choices ban chan kimchi bean sprout radish fish cake etc  Usually limit types meat serve case here  Everything really tasty  don't remember exactly much cost per person but don't think should run more $30   Definitely visit if you're looking good KBBQ Vegas  <EOR> we came tasted probably won't back   place good customer service   cameat lunch time wasn't crazy lack meat variety close dinner didn't replenish food   great experience little lady   she enjoyed sushi really only thing   really nothing them really into BBQ Buffet <EOR> Every time visit home tons new Kbbq places opening but most now trending toward high end meats which cost ton more but end day only taste marginally better   This place AYCE style where don't wait annoying server come back give more meat since grab your own meat   you don't deal whole       SHIT ORDERED MUCH problem unless you're idiot   Oh also kalbi dinner   Love reading reviews people complaining hot food orange chicken sushi  etc   Why f Kbbq place eating stuff hell outta makino if want that  <EOR> First time coming few weeks ago! wish more selections meat  bulgogi also soaked sauce bit overpowering but still enjoyed love tasting everything all delicious! love broccoli bit hard but if put vegetables mix meat grill its only softer tastes better  Will definitely coming back! <EOR> Disappointed   Wasn't impressed  Especially price little high wht u get  website wrong dinner price too  give 2 5 rating  experience  know there's plenty Korean BBQ places hopefully we'll find another one    can't win them all  <EOR> Meh  lot friends really place but guess spoiled LA Korean BBQ  found meat relatively low quality banchan very mediocre    I'm still looking good KBBQ Vegas favorite cuisines  it  <EOR> This place ok but think overpriced  don't even lot meat choose from  2 5 stars overall <EOR> SURA BBQ buffet can't really miss sign its freaking huge   My parents weren't lying place definitely some good meats   variety options awesome   Aside bbq meats soups your choice sides sticky rice pre grilled fish sushi few other Chinese Korean entrees   But bbq meat where its at   Kalbi best Korean BBQ joint meat good quality well marinated   also enjoyed bulgogi more sweet side but well some kimchi  <EOR> I must preface review warning standards Korean restaurants probably lot higher most people two reasons mom amazing cook don't mean course nothing beats Mom's cooking but mom operated successful Korean eateries own outrageously delicious recipes Korean kimchee blood   My brother brought eventing because he really enjoys BBQ  most part meat decent good selection tasted mostly your Korean marinated meats should taste  raw meat brown before cooked? Hmm really and wasn't all marinade   did enjoy fresh romaine lettuce leaves eat meat sang chu saam which made more authentic    The item look forward most Koreans actually consume commonly soups  soups offered horrible  mean seriously worst versions Korean soups yet  Really disappointing  Also dessert section just confusing  Banana spring rolls most likely lumpia ? Korean but admittedly delicious   Basically another visit if help it  many better Korean and meat lovers AYCE BBQ restaurants town same vicinity! Believe when say your money better spent somewhere else your stomach also thank you  <EOR> In Los Angeles ton choices wife know difference between good great Korean AYCE BBQ  would highly recommend SURA  Staff great  Booth seating adequate big guy such myself  Selection sides great  Meat selection awesome  pleasantly delighted help yourself buffet style service  <EOR> Great customer service but WAY over priced!! very good selection meat good either! $42 bill two people shitty food! <EOR> If you're looking buffet style self grill then don't come here    My Dad tells Sura reminds places he likes Korea same exact concept self grill self pick  just plus spicy Korean crab dinner only personal fav    I don't mind buffet style banchan grilled fishes soups very good  fond sushi but everything else    The kimchi spicy samjang salty but very tasty  wrap meat samjang garlic kimchi inside piece lettuce  Kimchi fish grill also good n  I love kalbi thinly sliced beef spicy pork belly love all    I enjoy coming family reminds grilling home minus clean up! If don't finish your food can't take home because la carte    The cost actually bad true could somewhere else town similar dining experience however Sura place where don't mind freedom dining style  water glass never empty neither belly   all ask for! <EOR> My absolute favorite Korean BBQ ever!!! spicy sweet pork addicting   and even better place all eat! def regular spot me  Kalbi ribs pretty good they're better Soyo though =] <EOR> Trying convince mom because she doesn't sweet food when she finally agrees eat she gets super sick afterwards    The whole cook your own food booth kinda fun me  started checking hot dishes really didn't find anything appetizing  sushi actually really good  rice wasn't dried plenty fish good flavor    Now MEAT   I grabbed some kalbi ribs pork ribs spicy wine sauce bolgogi squid shrimp  shrimp couldn't eat because since whole impossible devein pop them grossed out  squid really good though  kalbi ribs sliced beef good quality delicious  pork ribs really spicy smothered more sweet marmalade sauce  pork lot fat but very tasty    The condiment bar awesome because sliced jalapeos garlic cloves grill  best part dessert grilled pineapple! <EOR> I love marinated meats! AYCE korean BBQ place pretty good  think meats really stands me  Everything else just ok  But if craving some tasty meat fun experience come here  <EOR> Lunch $18 dinner $25  Much better money Vegas buffets  Unlike most ayce Korean BBQ directly food grill yourself wide variety  Kalbi only dinner    They small salad bar 8 meats sushi bar some Chinese dishes some Korean side dishes  place very clean ventilation system ensures its smoky inside  Best Korean BBQ ever lot  <EOR> Delicious great service!!! mom totally owner came help revive hot water tea! Also recommended things bring feel better worked  definitely head back next Vegas trip!! <EOR> The waiters nice   It's all eat buffet wide selection side dishes   meats sides all tasty   I wouldn't mind coming again if craving K BBQ Vegas! <EOR> Went lunch  All side dishes very good meat selection adequate all bins serving trays full fresh foods  Buffet area looked clean well organized  Korean Restaurants typically don't great service while over top attentive folks working today OK  Lunch $17 99 all eat IMO good value   If your looking fancy place dine place might meet your standards but if your hungry craving Korean Grub place you     <EOR> This place ayce food yourself buffet style  All servers just change your grills refill your drinks  Even chopsticks silverware all set yourself  First off fan raw meat just being left yourself but thought would give place try  25 99 dinner  pricey side only having bulgogi kalbi marinated kalbi brisket intestine pork belly pork belly marinated wine believe more pork item  expected beef tongue included least if going charge price ayce  ended eating just brisket kalbi entire time  Brisket whatever but kalbi good! also liked place lettuce could wrap your meat it  Downside don't rice paper when asked server looked crazy   uh rice paper? don't know let ask   If you're working kbbQ place should know rice paper is  top clearly done place empty two workers just stood table away talking noticing needed check even looking us  Other meat selection worth price but did lot side dishes appetizer items however those just fillers  If eat kalbi your money's worth! <EOR> Yummy kbbq! Waiters only bring refills swap grill plates  buffet style where pick all your meats bring back table  Unfortunately there's short rib limit 4 per person  if 8 could understand but 4 little sad $25+ before tax when most AYCE kbbq places $22+ before tax  However place does offer bunch sides soups even sushi! Overall worth $25 but if strictly looking kbbq Hwaro Tofu hut more short ribs save couple bucks! <EOR> I would really give place five star but because don't offer much small dishes think should price can't seem justify five star rating   However said Sura awesome   meats very fresh marinated just right  service great really pay attention your grills sure clean your grill time time   really enjoy times definitely come back when am mood some korean bbq  <EOR> Le Buffet n tait pas vari trs peu de nourriture et tout tait super piquant Uniquement de la gelatine en dessert! Le prix est de 28$ par personne sans tax ni pourboire  <EOR> Like mentioned previous post 7 24 09 back tried twice see if anything changed  first time everything excellent spicy crab seafood soup good kept going back second third fourth    The meats marinated just right everything wonderful  walked restaurant thinking should give them 5 stars now  came back second time week later b c want spicy seafood soup  Guess no spicy soup day  Also guess put much sugar into kalbi burned when onto grill even though heat medium  looked around realized other tables same problem  sugary stuff kalbi grill which created blacken burned layer smell which made everything tasted good  conclusion guess quality vary each day may great food may restaurant  still visit them again  cool thing restaurant because ceiling high open don't nasty stinky smell your clothes body normally when cooking food your table  Don't wrong your clothes still smell but home shower b4 going again bad  <EOR> The meats good  side dishes  sushi joke but expect? Multiple types rice options  Crappy little salad bar but least something  Alot kimchi options  sometimes close no reason aggravating  <EOR> The all eat Korean BBQ well worth money  order whatever want all enjoyable experience here  took family everything very good  quality meats food excellent many choices choose from  <EOR> i really couldnt decide if liked place  break down   pros its buffet theres no long wait another plate meat tons other stuff besides stuff bbq sushi tempura soup etc the meats pretty good im fond marinated stuff though because its buffet grab everything need their salad bar consists fruit some other sweet stuff which nice  cons keep mind LA korean bbq very different vegas kbbq service isnt great  remember waiting pretty long time water refill im little iffy kbbq buffets  granted everything clean stored proper temperature  guess just everything sliced order? some fans didnt work definitely came smelling kbbq its expected but fans help maybe expect lot more kbbq maybe im just picky  but definitely gone back few times if dont want wait tofu hut  sure back though! <EOR> AYCE Korean buffet  craving try Korean buffet finally went  hearing good reviews place  wasn't all impressed buffet made regret going there  even charge drink  going back there  <EOR> this review lunch    a group middle week disappointed don't serve kalbi lunch buffet  believe sushi don't dinner  100% positive though    service just friendly food replaced frequently even though weren't many people eating particular day    it's $16 pp if u don't drinks    i think fork over money dinner kalbi    PS  orange jello best red orange green  lol <EOR> We called advance set dinner large party  reserved two nice tables next each other service great  Everyone loved food successful evening  Once again thank SURA great food service  5 stars  <EOR> Decided come Hwaro told it'd hour half table   Food pretty good group American friends never Korean BBQ before enjoyed experience  plum wine ice cream must try  <EOR> Awesome spread array meats selection kimchee amazing sides   The best town   Courteous staff   <EOR> Delicious all eat grill yourself table Korean BBQ!!!

Good luck   plates start stack fact start remove them  However best service  Kinda forced service   4   Barbecue prefer very nice clean barbecue grill it clean sitting top nice fire it nice fresh oil drain plugged all past guests oily mess  Yikes Nasty 5   Bathroom Well would say bathroom rivals best chinese restaurants worst bathroom   No paper towels using mop hard?  GK says coming back give place second shot   just hope pick right time place total complete good experience   liked place kids liked know potential  <EOR> Korean food  no Korean BBQ! basically live for! Its perfect low carbers which boyfriend are  Once every few months when decide cram ourselves endless meats because unlike other Korean BBQs restaurants pick much meat want freakin amazing    So picture Walk seated your table some drinks  Then two plates just meat other lettuce wrap meat once its cooked cut into pieces But since its buffet meat quality is   not pretty haha  Meat good don't wrong!
