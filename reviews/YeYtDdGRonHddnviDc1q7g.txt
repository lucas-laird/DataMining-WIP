Upon looking chicken further noticing wasn't grilled anything just looks plain chicken  Then thinking did microwave did cook it? Chicken came little pale looking rather cooked    take first bite bad    Upon completing half bowl notice few pieces cooked    brought attention asked if wanted something else  said no due fact might give more undercooked microwaves chicken      I'm betting if DIDN'T ask sauce did wouldn't noticed it    future reference CHECK your chicken    <EOR> Love place food great service fast  Very healthy portions decently fair  Keep your health mind while enjoying  great food! <EOR> 3 99 chicken bowl deal! Definitely recommended those coming good pump gym  <EOR> I think only thing really keeping place afloat its location  VERY busy center LVAC 24 hour Starbucks  never experienced rude service but never very good service either  two girls working always seemed kind unhappy but unlike some people don't generally expect someone making minimum wage kiss ass    The food ok  charge extra everything menu price isn't accurate  If want white meat brown rice extra  total cost chicken bowl around $10  biggest issue place some other reviewers more occasion received chicken seemed under cooked least very borderline! pretty unnerving  Pretty stingy veggies too  mostly all zucchini!  I since ditched place Teriyaki Madness Maryland  little further drive but slightly cheaper usually faster tastes better too  <EOR> We came Friday night order 1  Yakisoba steak chicken LRG 7 60 2  Low carb chicken bowl LRG 7 30 for $2 11 used $7 groupon $14 Next YogurtLand LVAC  Chicken underwhelming  Can't expect much dry white chicken breast  Steak slightly flavored probably best item plate  Average tasting teriyaki sauce  far off Kikkoman teriyaki marinade  Yakisoba noodles microwave Maruchan style chow mein  Steamed vegetables great alternative over white rice  Honestly I'd opt Teriyaki Madness satifying Teriyaki taste buds  money I'd rather eat grilled chicken salad  But stay fit wouldn't mind occasional healthy meal Teriyaki Boy  <EOR> We ordered taro Boba tea which delicious icy cold  boba balls nice squishy  Great dessert eating Asian foods  <EOR> Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill fantastic place eat! clean excellent customer service food tastes delicious  would definitely recommend restaurant friend  Also best cashier ever  <EOR> After reading some poor reviews going try teriyaki Boy   am glad did give try food good staff friendly quick!
