<EOR> I think place potential   hummus pita pretty good liked chicken souvlaki but think might trying much   wish more kebabs menu maybe little more typical mediterranean fare though know prescribed fare   service pretty good but dead there   think might result location more anything else   pricing pretty good too  <EOR> It's nice place staff very friendly but food mediocre   gyro fries Caesar salad   Nothing homemade except Caesar salad dressing   If advertise homemade food should serve frozen fries frozen gyro meat   Pretty disappointing such Greek inspired menu   Probably won't try again  <EOR> At first hesitant coming because greek italian american food but actually good  waitress very kind knowledgable menu always smiling  ordered chicken pita delicious  chicken very moist fries very good fresh  Next time come try italian dishes because owner said very good  <EOR> Had chicken Slovakia very good  Service great we'll definitely back  <EOR> I love little local restaurant  When son eat dinner always greeted warmly  Brenda usual server always kind welcoming    I always come back delicious lasagna  baked perfectly oozing cheese homemade sauce  Whenever order think could never finish but addicting never leave crumb  son always orders spaghetti which consistent good well    I hope restaurant gets noticed more patrons because always pretty empty when go  <EOR> The kid finally stopped into restaurant Wed evening 10 1 14  first impression space did reflect its namesake  restaurant very homey inviting also felt staff well  Definitely place take family when you're lazy cook    I opted chicken parmesan kiddo cheeseburger  really enjoyed meal  pasta spicy meat sauce chicken parm still crispy delicious!
