Does say Luke's Lobster am dreaming??? definitely dreaming!! really excited RAN some   I super high expectations because first tried NYC YES!!!! did disappoint!! am truly happy!!!  Their hospitality beyond belief felt family!!  Instead 5 hour flight east coast only hour flight away!! happy!! <EOR> As someone frequented Luke's Lobster locations NYC while lived mildly disappointed Las Vegas location   I just back lunch am thinking myself really Luke's? Something lost trip east coast LV think   usual Taste Maine because greedy while service great seafood seemed fresh just    Wasn't good back east    felt rolls may benefited slightly more seasoning rolls did seem same resistance soggyness   Maybe touch much mayo?   I couldn't really put finger but mildly underwhelmed comparison   That's say didn't enjoy meal contrary quite enjoyed it  Since moving east coast Luke's Lobster fast casual chains missed  still enjoyable  Even price hike again sure if  because transported Vegas prices just raised since last time NYC if just we're Vegas now Vegas prices inflation  <EOR> If you're mood lobster roll really can't wrong place  Prices reasonable considering its strip lobster  husband share roll but good order another  give lobster roll without mayo cheers that  Would liked try crab and or shrimp but wallet only take much  let add small lobster tail side $5 if can't enough lobster you'll still want second roll though They interesting selection sodas including blueberry lemonade actually tart side sweet incase mood something different  But if sweet sodas covered too    We came around closing time back patio closed super crammed inside wasn't really place sit  There's seating around outside various other places but supposed customers sit your own risk  <EOR> Las Vegas land world class lobster rolls served kiosk front mall   It really just kiosk  a counter small adjacent seating area five small tables  But don't let keep away    My husband register little panic over order  taste Maine? Noah's ark? man taking order walked through various options super friendly helpful   didn't rush all   We settled Noah's ark $52 which features lobster roll crab roll shrimp roll two pickles four crab claws cocktail sauce all divided evenly into two baskets plus your choice two bags chips Cape Cod kettle cooked potato chips  regular sea salt vinegar two drinks bottled water Main Root soda Luke's Maine blueberry lemonade     The combo gives nice amount food each person  If you're starving guess might want more but couldn't finish everything  rolls simple  toasted white roll bit mayo piled shellfish topped drawn butter sprinkle seasoning  Great bread to shellfish ratio plenty butter but much anything overpower seafood  delicious! There's Sriracha shakers seasoning tables but totally don't need it    Maine root sodas great  made organic cane juice  opted blueberry because know Maine  No flavors anything just blueberry juice  lemonade made wildflower honey    Pickle totally meh  not crisp but  biggest complaint which saying something!   I love chalkboard telling where day's lobster crab shrimp came from    The service consistently excellent person took order came check while eating    Prices certainly aren't cheap but Las Vegas you're getting great quality delicious seafood  Don't miss it! <EOR> Much better then lobster me!
