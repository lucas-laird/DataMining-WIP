Super nice people chill atmosphere   There's soul food place next door share kitchen them fyi <EOR> I stopped Thursday night around 8pm  drawn sandwich board sign all sorts good dishes listed  restaurant much bigger inside expected brightly lit colorful welcoming   However when opened door only saw 4 people sitting circular table towards middle back restaurant  wasn't sure if customers people worked there  didn't acknowledge presence waved little asked open? Someone answered Yes but all continued sit there  Talking amongst themselves  playing cards? Having staff meeting? don't know but bad customer service show table least smile stand up   My friend picked table sit  Menus appeared but no drinks offered  The four them continued sit table  It looked them folding menus  Maybe other 3 people friends visiting restaurant  Maybe not   But customer standing front takes priority over folding menus chatting amongst yourselves   The menu choices looked good  bad didn't server come talk keep interest  friend took bad start omen bad service whole meal left   Service restaurant nearly important food  Nothing food taste worse bad service  sure customer won't come back if bad service given no amends made better  Worse yet customer give bad review tell friends service sucked   As much would give place one star respect fact mom pop kind place trying drop business  However folks need know because experience if someone told food awesome I'd follow personal experience outlined review  <EOR> 1st time having Jamaican food    Must say delicious  atmosphere real laid back    Small establishment  Owner says transition looking bring more Caribbean flavor Las Vegas  curry chicken blew mind    Such flavor chicken very tender  curry sauce over rice peas took over top  Over look sketchy decor yourself favor some chicken    won't disappointed!! <EOR> Came authentic Jamaican food  had  Delicious jerk chicken rum punch  restaurant re concepting lounge opens 3pm until  Unless you're going evening may want stick take orders cause pretty empty another reviewer mentioned  <EOR> This place expected but confess food good  Tucked corner plaza right next House Flavor you'll notice restaurant must former office some sort  kitchen? Located back plaza which assume smoke grill actual BBQ grill which order    At night turns into Jamaican nightclub chill spot where listen reggae all night  even VIP SECTION which basically your mom's dining table seats 8   counter consisted foldout table basic cash register microwave rice cooker    Anyway ordered jerk chicken which comes small salad fried plantains  also ordered side festivals beef patties  jerk chicken delish! Tender meat right amount flavor spice however jerk chicken naturally spicy all together   salad basically your typical pre made iceberg lettuce mix  personal favorite beef patties festivals! beef patties REALLY spicy keep watering down water but good way  festivals fried sugar powdered donuts  More fried doughy which sssssoooo good  can't deny kept wanting more sad when came end helping   Place a ok  might come eat establishment but may come order take out  probably won't way though  If ask think place would awesome food truck business! <EOR> The food pretty good    jerk chicken though little disappointed because wasn't Jerk side spicy all    Still good flavor but authentic jerk    Oxtails Mmmmmm      Good!!!!
