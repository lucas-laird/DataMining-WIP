Good thing fork help out  both ordered them dressed lettuce pickles onions while good choice Streetcar think detracted bit Bourbon Street because gravy lettuce made unholy mess    Prices little high $25 total compared other local sandwich shops but reasonable considering most ingredients shipped Louisiana  Groupon which cut price nearly half   Overall food fine but sadly unmemorable  If you're craving po boy Streetcar pinch  But think just wait hit Johnny's Po Boys next time New Orleans  Now  restaurant desire! <EOR> Very good down home cooking  bread perfect flakey  fried mac n cheese bites freaking amazing  gravy real cajun also delicious    The service very friendly  Prices extremely reasonable  Only downside its far!
