The small restaurant seemed clean usual basic Thai ambience but no diners 8PM Wednesday evening    The three entrees I'd ordered   curry dish noodle dish fried rice dish all OK yet great   All ordered spicy  3 4 scale 5 but only actually somewhat spicy rice dish which I'd asked level 4     Couldn't detect heat other dishes    Portion size completely normal gotten dozens other Thai take outs over years except Mussaman Curry portion little low   I realize vegetarian  missing ubiquitous FISH SAUCE  normal ingredient just every Asian food dish particularly Thai food unfortunately fish sauce provides basic flavor    None three entrees ordered really much flavor them eaten vegetarian Thai food dozens dozens other places over decades able provide great flavor plus spiciness   If Valley Thai closer home probably least 20 other Thai places closer  LOVE area!! I'd happy try them again knowing initial experience need tell them egg rice etc  OK kick spiciness level 5 in order hope there's even little heat  common problem Thai restaurants around guess they're afraid stupid people order really spicy then complain really spicy       But instead keep ordering Thai food couple places area able good balance flavor + heat plus keep trying new Thai places  <EOR> It okay but don't think back  missed being able order beer meal  restroom dirty  <EOR> Service awesome food delicious atmosphere very vibrant  server Belle she pretty cool  first timers loves noodles recommend pad Thai drunken noodle  Besides entree crab rangoon which extra rangoonie  plus fried calamari Thai tea specially great wasn't watery other restaurants dessert Fried Ice Cream mango sticky rice!
