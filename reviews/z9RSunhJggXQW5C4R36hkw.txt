Kinda wasteful  Great experiece overall  Recommend brisket ribs  <EOR> First off before bash place let say if wanted BBQ sandwich lunch 8 bucks soda side would eat every time just take family friends BBQ feast place me       The meat most tender BBQ ever suspiciously tender tender   mean ribs tender could barely pick them without them falling apart some might love but point much   pulled pork came off just little mushy but no chunks fat might see elsewhere    I say suspiciously because meat smoked gets very tender but fall apart tender braised stewed also gets crusty bark outside rocks contrasts tender meat inside  BBQ no bark   meat did authentic almost strong smokey flavor smoke ring also smell smoke outside am sure whats perhaps smoke while then steam something extra tender   ate 2 could sitting steamer tray all day but thats reminded of     The flavor just wasn't side strong smoke   needed salt minimum no rub taste could distinguish all   sauce ok but thin diluted sides well sides     The dessert cobbler ice cream very buttery delicious but little small share 6 bucks  <EOR> Lots meat per serving  Flavor amazing  Better other BBQ places tried! Comparable Lucille's much closer me  3 meat combo comes 2 sides rolls only $20! Fed boyfriend even brought home left over! Love place  <EOR> 2 words    No Bueno!
