I appetizer main course   I seasoned shredded beef empanadas which dried currants onions spicy salsa verde side dipping   crust nice but filling bizarre   the cumin overpowering dried currants strange addition   like tiny little raisins   can't recommend dish all     The best part meal should messy sundae   Unfortunately ice cream freezer burned hard rock     Food took foooreverrrrrr come out  asked waiter pizza long? he replied No ma'am round  HAHAHAAHAHAH All kidding aside no urge back   Seriously  <EOR> Stopped while waiting tire changed Discount tire which across street  great place! pleasantly surprised  Great happy hour great prices truffle fries mahi tacos Kobe sliders Gorgonzola cheese OMG! good  portions large very well priced  back sure! waitress Sherry G fabulous  <EOR> We came 1am wasn't expecting much    bf works odd hours he friends come occasion because late night happy hour    skeptical    And course wrong!  fully surprised good food time day price   Late night happy hours usually mean getting rid bad stuff but everything tasted fresh delicious    I think might obsessed duck tacos    Perfect balance flavors textures    also really liked baba ganoush lot    might favorites ever had    The service pretty good just bartender working    runners cooks came help carry food knocked over water glass   Very quick remedy situation    really appreciated that    Will definitely coming back! <EOR> This another local place wanted try actually found them thru ad online website sign email offers pretty good deals  pizzas because woodfire cooked those pizzas always seem lot better tastes traditional oven based cooking also good salad well something pizza salad going together takes better  service average could a little more attentive drinks getting empty  am believer servers need sure drinks always filled least checked frequently  <EOR> My husband frequently visit Sammie's Sahara 4 times week considering night owls spend most time tavern  really enjoy bar staff! Cher Kat  always remember drink orders feel welcome immediately ask if want order any food  always informed current player promotions really enjoy spending Free time Sammie's them   I suggest everyone Sammie's drink orders hummus! <EOR> I found place when renting car place next door   The All Natural Pepperoni pizza tasty delicious  service excellent friendly    Note While family place child cannot enough pizza highly recommend always checking yourself making your own opinion when reading reviews  all reviews especially filtered Yelp recommended  need scroll down bottom all reviews click xx other reviews currently recommended able read reviews hidden Yelp  <EOR> Wife stopped recently lunch   She ordered chicken wrap Chinese chicken salad   took nearly 30 minutes order filled   Waitress apologized   Said chicken being fresh cooked   Manager finally came offered free tapas ease wait nice touch    But when dishes finally arrived found 5 pieces chicken heaping salad taste wise compromised over generous drenching some kind dressing sesame oil think produced more heat taste   Wife's wrap more robust chicken but noticeably fresh cooked   Overall poor experience  <EOR> The Hawaiian grilled Mabo tacos delicious die little kick jalapeños still stinging mouth type review lol <EOR> On scale 1 10 Chilled roasted veggie salad solid 11    Loved combination flavors dressing excellent  GF menu  Pretty good GF pizza   Good wheat crust pizza  Very good coconut shrimp skewers  Love commitment sustainability  issue presenting free pizza coupon smart phone but made exception took care it   loved nice mellow nice break typical Vegas experience   Worth 10 minute drive downtown   Great outdoor seating  <EOR> This first review branch Sammy's   many times before unfortunate them chose review time   The last few visit Sammy's Centennial Flamingo locations raved it   time wasn't such fortuitous event     We shared Tapas appetizers hummus kobe beef fabulous   came triangles seasoned pita stayed crisp end sure did finish every drop hummus   We followed standard Thai chicken salad   last time Centennial Sammy's big couldn't finish it   time skimpy half amount chicken enough greens fully satisfied big eater   used two sizes salad but changed before Centennial definitely case having ordered larger size last time   When commented waiter waitress seemed disappeared he only working room he asked if wanted change something else   didn't   late we'd already gone through most which wasn't hard time   He then asked husband if he'd another beer   sure sounded if he comping result negative comment but when he brought bill charge second beer!!  He did remove but seemed hand hand indifferent unfriendly service took over when waitress split   This Sammy's bit closer house others usually more convenient when we're way back Strip environs but next time we'll rethink it  <EOR> I personally am big fan chain restaurants   Mostly because cookie cutter decor mediocre service typical short nothing special menu general ambiance  Yes IMO Sammy's some but lack better expected menu  offer whole grain pasta generally healthy options or least more most  difficult eat limited very few options when you're watching your diet  food tasty average prices  can't complain much but won't complain all  sure return near future  <EOR> Food decent  Service needs help  Walked 8pm place even 1 3 full immediately told right you  No hi welcome nicety  More would expect flos diner   Seated waited WAY long menus drinks order   Maybe am critical but expect water refilled without asking asked when beer empty if would another checked during appetizers meal if enjoying meal everything good   With all being said food being adequate many other choices better pizza service which may why place 2 3 empty  move onto other places good luck <EOR> Had New York Style pizza including pepperoni sautéed mushrooms salami  Italian sausage  able add goat cheese which awesome assuming add extra toppings any pizzas however sure if costs extra b c didn't see bill sure ask if care that   The pizza definitely good  bad world  My hubby grandma shared donut dessert came with chocolate raspberry sauce  Yummy cripsy fresh oven!  Extra points expressing sustainability buying local ingredients matter importance menu  Yay sustainability local ingredientsand yummy food! <EOR> Love place coming years! sad when closest house closed but location great! Waitress always remembers years  Food menu available 24 7 through attached bar if you're late its perfect  sit outside near fire pit plenty inside seating also  favorite food items include Lebni app goat cheese pizza but honestly never anything bad here  Wish would open north side! <EOR>
