asked speak manager then claimed allowed ask if service dog allow dogs into restaurant   I nothing against dogs but never return IHOP because wish eat table where dog probably just eating at   The manager could care less but am sure care once health department gets involved   <EOR> I definitely understand why place such low ratings  seated tried tell waitress couple different times wanted ahead order even though waiting couple others but she kept talking whatever she wanted say even when tried interject  Could word edgewise then she left  waited come back but she never did  Sat 15 20 minutes without much offer water  entire restaurant almost completely empty only two other tables customers! Really disappointed because love IHOP other time nice waitress  Oh time crunch when waitress finally came over when told going leave asked first long would take food if ordered thinking maybe I'd able still squeeze in  reply? Well why don't tell want tell rather unpleasant way  worst restaurant experiences personally had! <EOR> A bunch local thieves!!! If could give 0 stars unprofessionalism lack morale would  use location frequently purchase breakfast team  normally order take customer service lack any real concern  specific day asked split bill $50 corporate card $28 balance cash  am submitting expense report work notice charge $78 guessing Sheree C manager duty became immediately annoyed when she asked assistance decided pocket cash  When called open dispute advised left additional tip  Thank goodness submit receipts reimbursement  Such thieves  hope $30 worth losing all future business would received us  sad  very sad  <EOR> Great food  Crappy service  wait 10 minutes seated simply because understaffed boxing day   8 open tables yet no seat no cash register  few servers serving those lucky enough seated but no available seat people coming in  left extreme prejudice    previous experiences tell food good but service never par but today particularly bad   However owner responded professionally complaint past experiences decided change rating 2* 5*  going back assume off experience previous experiences good  Service perfect but still better lot places visited  I also respect professional responses  <EOR> This favorite IHOP few reasons  it's trashy some other locations kept very neat  The food usually comes quickly  The staff great see management actively making sure people happy  I'm only giving four stars because few times service could used some work  <EOR> today boyfriend sister all came usually do  seated fast waitress NORMA asked drinks we'd all 3 asked water  took longer usually just 3 glasses water place wasn't busy all  She took order when food came sisters food spilt honey mustard plate not big deal but everybody likes honey mustard   asked extra plate she seemed she didn't acknowledge 5 minutes waiting 1 plate she threw down table  said thank she said yeah asked table behind doing  once did Norma bother asking if okay needed anything  She walked past stop ask check she kept walking said yup   she gave check said thank pay front she didn't say anything  waiting someone ring all heard screaming THANK YOURE WELCOME she picking table  she then walked back asked 'Janay' ring before she knocks somebody   Janay very nice asked if everything okay rang way  am write bad reviews but just crossing line  Working F B easy job especially when customers very stressful rude which little comments very rude crossing line  If could give 0 stars would just because Norma  Every other time come service great acceptable  first time ever seen lady hopefully last time because nice if again  <EOR> I've fair share food missteps but IHOP's saving grace its ambience  facility feels clean modern spacious yet also homey surprisingly peaceful respite its more chaotically busy competitors leaps bounds better beyond any other IHOP dined at   For years come weekdays avoid weekends simple sit down lunch dinner family friends  Over time decent breakfast diner food + friendly service I'd highly recommend  <EOR> I ordered manager special hash browns charcoal waitress never came back food  boyfriend ordered California scramble came homefries those ok  Basically save your money Marriott cafe down street  breakfast coffee prices better  <EOR> This well managed IHOP pretty busy weekend mornings  service received great even though server quite few tables  lots families come eat don't forget mind your language around kids elderly   I BOGO free meal coupon Las Vegas Entertainment Book accepted happily  *saving money dance*  Also kids eat free every day 4 00 PM  true when checked 05 26 10    IHOP classic great place eat!

We never ever back  Except when people want take even then suggest somewhere else  The tables filthy floor looks hasn't vacuumed ages  While 2 different occasions food served wrong other customers complaining same thing   The servers stand gossip while your glass empty   When leave purse stuck seat syrup straw wrappers it  They usually empty don't see why servers stand around gossiping instead getting orders right cleaning something  I recommend location anybody! Red Rock Station isn't far Bagel Cafe if looking great breakfast  <EOR> This IHOP location boasts friendly relatively speedy service  am impressed changes made menu  Menu items mixed between traditional IHOP selections would expect find diner which nice if cant decide want thanks ''options''  fair share IHOP locations may most clean seen  If your lucky may find devouring bacon eggs combo  <EOR> Was waiting boyfriend almost 10 minutes until seated  place empty hostess didn't even bring menu  just walked worst ihop ever  <EOR> Ok      IHOP gourmet faire    But always clean   exceptionally good service generally just top IHOP food chain      Once while just want full breakfast    dinner!   <EOR> This place disgusting  few times convenience but last  If come sure smell water  Seriously smells dip glass toilet  Coffee mug smells perhaps clean all glasses urinal  Eggs good  Hash browns tasted freezer burned barely warm  left hungry thirsty top every time use restroom think water  <EOR> When comes Pancakes simple guy   Give some traditional Buttermilk Pancakes happy camper    99% time come IHOP   location middle Summerlin next gym work at   It's nicer locations town they've kept clean comfortable   employees always friendly never any issues service   gets really busy weekend normally come family weekday morning   Will return?  bet  <EOR> Loved restaurant when Bernadette Manager    nice!
