Don't wrong food still very good but experience just didn't same wow factor   guess back day kinda revolutionary Japanese restaurant   high end high quality modern ambiance modern preparation but 10 years later everyone mother copied format just common   Back drawing board Nobu! <EOR> The food great  Just watch your waiter  ordered bottle white wine unknowingly he substituted bottle another more expensive bottle wine  72 dollars bottle wasn't great! <EOR> Fresh yellowtail sashimi jalapeno Spicy miso scallop chips Tuna tataki ponzu Black cod miso Tenderloin beef to ban yaki  Best  Dinner  Ever   Oh did mention Lindsay Lohan new Hard Rock beau bodyguards  Good times! <EOR> If possible I'd give Nobu 4 5 stars    My sweetie spent few days Las Vegas week high profile restaurants every night   All food ordered absolutely delicious perfectly cooked seasoned   sushi sashimi served perfect temperature everything tasted absolutely fresh     Spicy Miso Chips w Scallop Sashimi Squid Pasta Miso Glazed Black Cod A Nobu specialty best piece fish ever eaten A Selection Sashimi sushi including yellowtail fluke salmon avocado roll yellowtail scallion roll  Flourless Chocolate Cake Bento Box As pastry chef pretty wary whole flourless chocolate lava cake trend but fabulous perfect texture molten center served white chocolate sauce green tea ice cream  Yum! I'd say prices quite reasonable well   Keep mind is Vegas people   checking many restaurant menus other hotels I'd say Nobu absolutely less expensive there's no way you're going better food quality   The only half star missing would quality service   clearing mise en placing table fabulous but waiter little casual   He seemed almost verge addressing guys calling sweetie boss    Nothing wrong being friendly but lets face isn't diner   little more dignity would appropriate   Luckily professionalism runners made it     Yay Nobu! <EOR> It's Nobu  set gold standard Japanese fusion cuisine  lot Japanese restaurants copied Nobu's dishes Miso Black Cod Japaneno Yellowtail know they're doing something right 20+ years original opened New York City  can't really add anything hasn't already said  Treat yourself go  <EOR> Food good sushi but worth 3x premium charge   Sushi Roku just good much less expensive   Ambiance good should but top flight experience   fine upscale dining experience but  it   dining room itself lacks any real joie de vivre   Prices extreme    Your paying hefty premium eat Nobu   some being able name drop worth price but food experience don't justify price   Final take Nobu tasty but lacks inspiration   dining experience nothing experiential nor terribly memorable   Given all other options Vegas won't going back   Life expectancy 2 3 years <EOR> Ate last night service great but didn't think food over top price  wagyu beef under seasoned sashimi opinion just sashimi  didn't any flavors wowed me  would however back try again  menu huge possible just didn't right things me  Presentation all good absolutely beautiful  <EOR> I've only pleasure going once but memorable sure! boss loves sushi much he last trip highly recommended it  Before left Vegas he said Nobu spend $150 him!!! Nice boss!   I sat sushi bar told chef first time something good he certainly did  left all he served numerous plates fancy sashimi   salmon yellowtail barracuda more! thought would miss rice but did not  Japanese beer 2 glasses red  no idea much check would be   turned $135 + tip which worked well budget! lol p s  wine $17 glass   ouch  Anyway never ate much sashimi before enjoyed every bite!  Oh  waiter really nice attentive  <EOR> When Vegas want Sushi come here  Sushi exceptional usually Toro melts mouth  down Sapporo  If small group sit bar ask Sushi chef he recommends  Never bad food never disappoints  staff nice friendly  Bonus Hard Rock Hotel when stay don't far  <EOR> Pros Good service great atmosphere  Delicious sushi all fresh presented well  order many dishes  All splendid    Cons Pricey  where if feel splurging sushi  prepared drop cool Franklin per person  <EOR> Just back Nobu  sat sushi bar ended little tipsy er expected  Even review Their specialty dishes really very good  both Toro Caviar dish Live Scallops  Yes  really did pay $40 Toro Caviar  worth it? least once  All normal sushi stuff fresh good but honest million other sushi places offer fresh raw fish lot cheaper  suggestion? If going sure try least couple specialty dishes   Decor seemed fine   I more interested lightning hands uber sharp knife sushi chef  He only super cool watch but also offered some superb suggestions even though he clearly only understood tiny bit english  Ultra attentive wait staff   maybe even little attentive but think because chairs close together sushi bar can't more 1 plate front time  other words if didn't ultra attentive wait staff wouldn't able order more food   What keeps place 5 stars? PRICE  Wicked expensive  super wicked  know expect pay bunch good sushi but pretty high  Drinks run $15 specialty items run $20 $40 any other nigiri hangs around $10  Though should scared when notice no price dillio website I great meal sure but don't know if would worth $130 again   I alone didn't feel odd all  I'd love say I'd back but things could hold back price tag lack proximity strip  being said if getting some cost assistance biznass trip staying somewhere close say   the Alexis Park Hotel then I'd sure  <EOR> Just back recently   glad place closer   i would everyday! <EOR> It's first time Nobu which thinking going forever!!!   I tried Omakase $125 which good  came 7 8 courses  looked simple but each bite flavorful  just realized Nobu Palo Alto too  can't wait again!  Everyone friendly  waiter asked time frame wouldn't late watch show  appreciate courtesy!  Not 5 stars because ordered Old Fashioned  good thought should be  But food definitely 5 stars! <EOR> From moment arrived received impeccable service customized menu which entailed finest seafood well wagyu which outstanding! would definitely recommend location vs California  entire selection items off menu provocative taste buds left wanting more  relationship full amazing experiences rather dinner  <EOR> Nobu love you!!  Came Vegas trip girls first stop! dolled drove Hard Rock where valet parking walked into center first floor where ridiculously delicious restaurant located   Service Great!

Oh sake If knock off even 1 star it'd because little ways off strip Hard Rock   if you're totally strip centric maybe your best bet   also felt little cold definitely seated most comfortable table but none looked uber posh   6 courses served felt sub par   But believe level service quality ingredients expert preparation made top 3 meals life  <EOR> Hamachi jalapeno cilantro sashimi    special soy sauce   OMG   The staff    sorta snippy   The price astronomical  <EOR> Delicious fish fresh great quality  However small portions pricey  The server seemed irritated did want order $300 bottle sake  <EOR> Did try food because server worked hard selling instead describe food entrees  He nice guy but wanted dinner timeshare presentation  Thanx water  <EOR> Ok food good service but consistently orders wrong  Way over priced  Don't even try order wagyu $75 sliver meat = outrageous!! paying name whatever gold digger drags there  <EOR> I'm usually  big fan Asian fusion but food Nobu superb! place uses very high quality ingredients serves really fresh fish   Recommendations Order things aren't menu! Ask specials most decadent food isn't regular menu  Miso marinated black cod favorite! savory sweet done perfectly  Yellow tail jalapeño could seriously eat 10 orders this   Don't order sushi rolls aren't anything special worth it  <EOR> My first second visits hands down 5 stars  food delicious interesting atmosphere pleasant  third possibly last trip mediocre  opened new club Hard Rock crowd bit loud lively fine dining restaurant  foie gras delicious but sushi wasn't good previous trips  If again likely stick hot dishes  <EOR> In case people don't know Nobu restaurant chain chef Nobu Matsuhisa starred Food Channel show Iron Chef  He brought gourmet New Japanese cuisine world  place very expensive   but taste extraordinary  Black Cod miso melts your mouth  Every dish work culinary art  service Las Vegas restaurant excellent  constantly sure everything clean ready glasses filled your needs met  bill 6 $270 before tip costly but over priced  definitely upper echelon restaurant  Las Vegas venue situated middle Hard Rock Hotel therefore several decibels high  If eat frequently going lose your hearing  why give 4 stars  imagine restaurant outside Hard Rock Hotel more pleasant  If you're your 20 40's you'll probably give 5 stars  <EOR> We heart Nobu!!!

Priced control even control Vegas 2018  Nowhere near worth prices   One saving grace desserts which creative tasty unlike food  <EOR> Nobu definitely qualifies some best sushi ever tried  Keep mind if you're thinking ordering your basic California Roll Spicy Tuna Roll etc   it'll waist your money  Some things tried Miso Black Cod Yellowtail sashimi jalapeño Barracuda sashimi   all amazing way   Don't forget try saki well bit expensive but worth every penny   eaten twice see myself coming back more  <EOR> [Michelin Star #11]  Night three day Vegas Michelin dining binge brought Nobu   occasion friend's birthday     Upon arrival led through crowded dining room full boisterous patrons drinking sake beer table which rubbing elbows parties around us   First things first place where want elegant Japanese meal but perfect bigger groups     When waiter arrived he took drink orders then instead announcing any specials he told group size he strongly recommended family style   He said tone left no other option   course family style sense but seems establishment Nobu's reputation and Michelin star! should far more accommodating its patrons   But understand likely difficult navigate one's way through such crowded restaurant myriad plates accompany most Japanese meals   My group opted omakase   brought nice variety both hot cold dishes raw cooked   highlight meal miso black cod   dish placed center table following unanimous chorus approval each tasted delectable morsel definitely umami   also enjoyed nicely seasoned yellowtail sashimi great deal but wasn't best yellowtail far   rest dishes less memorable but still well executed   final few courses consisted rolls whose fish rice ratio unreasonably high yeah could tell trying fill up     Were rate food alone Nobu would solid four star establishment   But Nobu Michelin rated restaurant I'd rate Michelin standards   places experience don't pack diners sardines especially don't patronizing waiters   enjoyed experience Nobu but enjoyment more company restaurant itself     I've told Nobu's other locations much classier Vegas strip   If  case then shame those Michelin guys giving particular location star  <EOR> I walk place say PLEASE hand menu   know back hand   several times over many years cannot enough new style sashimi    white fish salmon delish!  Very thin sliced fish served warmer room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled chives  Now yellow tail w jalapeno peppers   Melt your mouth!  Next popcorn shrimp breaded crunchy sauce   yum!  Chilean Seabass next buttery tender flavor indescribable   Black Cod w miso sauce perhaps favorite dish  done right!  believe  home hard find miso paste right balance over power fish   yeah expensive place dine but am never disappointed   am big portion person if you'd hate broke here  love quality care presentation every dish here   Wine list good cocktails imaginative   Service always good if don't take word aforementioned menu options wait staff happy recommend explain dishes great detail  <EOR> Best Nobu Nobu family   omakase which true treat  Deducting star because expensive! bill over $500 just 2 people but some pretty incredible dishes   The portions quite big too  left full! highly recommend omakase such fun experience great way try all best dishes  <EOR> Love service sushi melting    heavenly  took care 100%  walked server offered chef choice selection  All needed say much wanted spend  Wow am missing place already <EOR> As always food Nobu fabulous  wasn't fabulous ambiance particular Nobu location  tables plywood look vibe chairs uncomfortable  Everything looked worn tired  server energetic informative but service beyond slow  half hour between each course! No joke  Those kinds delays when uncomfortable seating arrangement everything much worse  won't back Nobu location  <EOR> Maybe time day but overall fare salty tastes    black Miso Cod good but much remainder left rather neutral impression   Particularly unsatisfying order crab sautee   Salty heavy indelicate cannot offer place high marks   Better sashimi selections   Again primary complaint still seemed flavours heavy handed  <EOR> Ok if know know love NOBU!  It small place wait staff all look rock stars even if faking sexy accents I swear last waiter Spanish Brazilian Puerto Rican throughout course meal but he hot didnt mind anyway said Malibu Location San Diego Location LA Location   recommendations are * NoBu Ceviche Tacos      * Yellowfin Tuna Spicy Miso Chips      * Yellow Tail Sashimi Jalapeno  and pair Conundrum if it    sake   YUM <EOR> I gamble Hard Rock pretty frequently afforded number comps here  definitely better your run of the mill sushi joints bunch Americanized rolls but others really stepped high end sushi game e g  Nobu Caesars Blue Ribbon Cosmo Kabuto Spring Mountain etc  which left Nobu just average among set  Certainly if you're area comp or business account could much worse but shouldn't your go to high end sushi place anymore  <EOR> Omakase let chef blow your senses  ate items weren't menu!  Fish couldn't any more fresh   Meat dish better any Kobe ever eaten   sake   order most expensive bottle ridiculously smooth only made Nobu   Service exceptional besides fact all hot!  back know will! <EOR> Great food excellent service  Its japanese peruvian influences cuisine  Everything very fresh squid pasta no pasta dish something die for  Overall great experience  <EOR> This review groupon deal dinner   The Skinny fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left unimpressed 3 service excellent service despite disappointing cuisine 5 value Groupon still overpriced is  imagine say full price     worth 2 5    So here's deal  spotted Nobu groupon $95 2 person regularly $150 prix fixe menu thought pass up?    We seated prompty  server great giving time space some decisions menu  ended getting addition prix fixe order vegetable tempura round menu  specials offered didn't really appeal lot fruit candied nuts mixed sashimi which sounded overly sweet passed those   Starting some simple edamame Maldon sea salt love those flakes! nice way start meal   Course 1 yellowtail sashimi jalapeno cilantro 6 slices good dish but exceptional  Although different versions before better renditions given quality fish strategically correct amount heat  only thing dish actual slices sashimi itself slices bit thin ragged along edges which surprised given supposed caliber place   Course 2 selection nigri 6 pcs california roll 6 pcs nigri okay slices fish decent sized  despondent when realized sushi rice little overcooked sticky   Course 3 rock shrimp tempura first bite good however ate spicy aioli began slowly permeate batter leading soggier batter  think aioli would better served dipping sauce rather dressed tempura retain textural integrity  Flavorwise nice dish loved mixture chive togarashi   Course 4 miso glazed black cod candied black cod more it! Overly sweet piece fish smothered sugary sauce which became more unappetizing more worked finish this  made home using recipe 1 2 sugar much better   Course 5 vegetable tempura added Groupon tempura okay nothing special  batter slightly spongier like  think would better if shredded daikon ginger provided could add much little wanted   Course 6 normally would mochi ice cream except birthday molten cake tiramisu green tea ice cream  All them very good however nothing really wow'ed think exceptional   Perhaps 10 years ago level fusion cuisine would considered cutting edge  However time made dishes appear quite dated  signature dishes rock shrimp tempura yellowtail jalapeño sashimi miso glazed black cod easily found elsewhere might argue location's rendition rather lackluster considering price  Given many issues dishes mentioned above cannot recommend place given Groupon price let alone full price  Although server truly exceptional doesn't food  2 5 rounded 3 starred review  <EOR> The food creative very high quality  executed presented beautifully  service very precise  Overall tremendous experience   I enjoyed subtle yet poignant latin influence  bit pricey but believe top restaurants Vegas  <EOR> Cod good expected but other dishes paled comparison NYC  beef dumplings worth high ticket price <EOR> This place good  Better expected  Came boyfriend weekend trip Vegas would definitely come again    We never Nobu before just asked waiter recommend dishes us  turned best idea because things he recommended bomb com    Must tries Yellowtail w jalapeno Black cod w miso Japanese red snapper Dry Miso One Signature Dishes forgot name but see pictures website    5 pieces medium sliced tender beef things accompanied w peruvian potatoes topped tasty sauce    On $$$ side but honestly if try right things worth it  <EOR> My wife another couple cool people Nobu before Queensryche Scorpions concert   What AMAZING Experience Culinary Art  Tara Thom ordered $125 Nobu Signatures  where server asked some questions proceeded bring them smaller servings some their Signature dishes   First them  Yellowtail Sashimi Jalapeño* and recommended cilantro leaves   stole piece OMG!!  I lost track some but another highlight Pepper Crusted Black Cod  never liked cod before but special  char perfect  I best mushroom soup Tenderloin Beef* cooked perfectly  Eating pre sliced steak chop sticks classy   Anne Organic Chicken both chose Anticucho sauce marinade  Stick licking good   Bottom line place Fantastic  service exceptional  swarm friendly team players keep over satisfied  meal never forget great friends    Thank Nobu <EOR> Ok admit lot hype around restaurant trying LA say wasn't impressed  BUT decided give another try Vegas man am glad did!!

Nobu est une chaîne de restaurants japonais fondée à l'origine à New York et qu'on retrouve maintenant sur les 5 continents quoique pas en France   Celui ci est situé à l'intérieur du Hard Rock Hotel un peu à l'écart du Strip attention quand vous faites votre réservation car il y 2 Nobu à Vegas l'autre étant dans le Caesars ne vous pointez pas au mauvais endroit    La cuisine nippo fusion du chef Nobu Matsuhisa est remarquable les sensations gustatives surprenantes raffinées exotiques ! Vous pouvez vous laisser conseiller par le serveur ou aller à l'aventure dans la carte  Comme d'habitude dans un resto japonais une ligne du menu n'est pas un plat suffisant en quantité pour votre repas commandez plusieurs plats d'un coup ou au fur et à mesure le service est rapide pour varier les plaisirs  Parlant de service il est aux petits soins sympathique mais curieusement familier même au standard américain pas du tout gênant mais je m'attendais à un tout petit peu plus de formalisme  Bon c'est Vegas peut être qu'à New York il en va autrement  L'addition vient vous rappeler qu'on est dans un resto de stars Robert de Niro est co propriétaire comptez 200 dollars par personne tout compris ouch si vous voulez vous faire plaisir ce qui est quand même le but de l'opération ! PS il est indiqué au moment de la réservation et à l'entrée du restaurant qu'il est interdit de s'y présenter vêtu d'un maillot de bain  Je cherche encore une explication logique  <EOR> Really 41 2   Back week later except ate bar time   them scallop role soy paper caviar top awesome   Also stuck sashimi again yellowtail snow crab Japanese halibut albacore octopus   tuna nigiri miso soup too   couple martini's shot unbelievable tequila called Deleon   Very smooth unique   Expensive but celebrating very worth it   Service very good server very helpful offered other local joints eat suggestion wise   Expensive but great place  <EOR> I upset when paid 35 bucks tiny Sake large kinda hated place then on  LA fine dining same size less half that  principle would never return regardless food service quality  <EOR> Even though ate Nobu over two years ago experience still pretty fresh mind  Its most memorable meals ever had  came group people during conference luckily expense meal otherwise cost would made flinch    We seven course chef's tasting menu WORLD  dishes stood yellow tail sashimi jalapeno lobster tacos whole yellow tail came stand upright looking while pulled moist meat off its carcass  Everything great including service  hope back another 7 course meal someday! <EOR> 5 Stars   Hmmm else say?

Every dish looks artwork   fish fresh black cod amazing!!! <EOR> I've back twice various occasions once Vegas once Hawaii say wrong   Sorry Nobu!  thought lame attempt sell first time 'house specialties' really mistake lack trust part   house specialties Miso Cod other dishes   really amazing   sashimi delicious some less common choices   really would steer clear rolls   you those anywhere honest rolls casual sushi eater     Thanks proving wrong Nobu   made eat cod I mean crow enjoyed every minute it! <EOR> Love Nobu! Only negative thing say pricey  but guess  expected Nobu being Vegas   Nigiri sold 1 piece per order look if ordered 10 piece omakase $100   it doesn't seem bad  Also if remember correctly fresh wasabi would extra $7  if drink good amount   it probably average $75 150 top your food bill  All all   it's good recommend if moola it!  Oh yes   sushi bar all day everyday   Also Nobu Waikiki LA but ones fav  <EOR> I always say know place great sushi if California Roll tastes really good itself! Man Ohhhh Man! sat sushi bar while chefs made sushi endlessly precision freshness rolls amazing!! also order lobster roll soft shell crab roll miso soup mango passion drink!

YAY! shrimp very similar walnut shrimp find Chinese restaurants only without walnuts  I find dish quite another bummer   But then pan seared scallops edamame hummus came rescue GOOD!! scallops fresh huge hummus really complements scallops!  Then second hot dish Black cod miso very very delicious love it!!!  The last course dessert SUNTORY CAPPUCCINO which many layers  including Coffee Cream Whisky Foam Milk Ice Cream  tasted tiramisu some ways but lot more tasty  Very light sweet   All all even though some flaws dining experience superb full surprises  <EOR> Amazing black cod  Amazing  good  new style tataki second favorite  If you're considering yellowtail sashimi even you're tired ponzu jalapeño  yellowtail roll isn't good  mean great but think sashimi plate better deal more flavor  Blair B  said unique plates here   As side note Nobu participated Taste Nation Las Vegas which fundraiser end childhood hunger Nevada  Nobu cares community  really appreciate that!  Service Nobu really world   Nobu's bento box favorite dessert all time much replicate home success  flour less chocolate cake green tea ice cream hot fudge  Lord mercy am heaven!  If money spend Nobu  <EOR> This only restaurant would recommend Hard Rock Hotel  working HRH five days ended eating almost every establishment there  Nobu only would optionally again   This best sushi had  Everything flavorful top quality  can't remember all dishes but below ones remember score 5 Bug Eye Tuna Lotus Chips 4 Shishito Peppers 2 I really spicy one!

The food great but service lacking  When sat down group 5 6th person joined us  When waiter brought tuna lotus chips he said only 5 since  many when sat down  He easily could said bring another but specifically ask him  price service should better maybe because still Hard Rock  <EOR> Amazing  Let list would suggest Sake 35 super smooth Sake 40 Chicken Steak skeweres amazing sakito peppers instead edamame Black Cod Miso Spicy Tuna hand roll  However if name thing off menu eat only eat would Black Mod Soaked Miso few days  amazing  boyfriend thought crazy ordering dish ended eating half    After initial entree orders ordered more sashimi toro because fish literally melted your mouth delicious     Ask Marcus he shit!!!!

The miso Black Cod Miso best ever ever  tuna tar tar   Wow  brought sushi dishes end but everything prior better  Highly highly recommend going spot  <EOR> Totally disappointed place  should've listened friend really disappointed omakase but noooo throw down two bills prove myself much sucked    The decor nothing write home about  think overuse bamboo place chairs Ikea tables just weirdly laid out    First all couldn't understand cutesy English waitress speaking  Each time she said something would pause 1 2 3 4 5 seconds since couldn't tell if she asking question making statement  Then it'd followed sorry what? ordered chilean sea bass black bean sauce crab ceviche some grilled beef thing  ceviche overwhelmingly tangy  think reshaped some fillings teeth  lot though even though waitress told small portions  next chilean sea bass which good all  Again portion decent but bland even hot  Finally meat came although tender just wasn't flavorful expected   For being Nobu did high expectations  But DK evaluated said even if no name restaurant just walked into still wouldn't thought good    And next morning telling people just sucked  sticking that    So those speak Mandarin know bu means don't  restaurant's name forewarning answer you'll give when asked good?  worth going?

No privacy    When seated disappointed elbow elbow other couples side no chance romantic dinner or private conversation matter   point couple next leaned over discuss selections! place small somewhat crowded  Although frequent Japanese Sushi restaurants menu contained many things never before  Most items appetizer sized quite pricey considering size $14 25   chose items off hot cold sushi sections   The yellowtail tartar great lobster ceviche so  tempura rock shrimp excellent just bunch fried shrimp plate popcorn shrimp size   tried house special a rainbow roll Eel sushi  Both good but favorite rolls I'd ever had actually kind plain  dessert bento box essentially souffl <EOR> Let start saying am sushi FREAK  don't wonder Hmm    maybe just first time or     No  seriously LIVE sushi  eat incredible places 3 4 times MONTH! dont care cost either  Good sushi worth me!   Okay being said    would give Nobu 3 5 stars if possible  Then again only reason I'd bring half would friendly servers great decor    Now sushi    someone said below recently expecting WOWED  eaten some amazing food Vegas hoped going blow those other places water  But unfortunately  Now don't know if because we're more into nigiri sashimi don't hot meal route very often  way just impressed  ordered red snapper sashimi which came big slabs flavorless fish no presentation really no taste either  Next spanish mackerel usually fave  bland boring  Then ordered unagi which most sushi fans know takes while when bake fresh  brought almost before words came mouth! Fast service yes    but did he bake fast? discovered answer when noticed plateful sitting top little oven already done waiting  Boo!! caused lukewarm when arrived  Finished off rock shrimp tempura because point really just wanted realizing if saved money we'd normally spend could fave places soon it!   Rock shrimp tempura good can't lie  But also nothing special  Oh!! something really bugged dining partner chef wasn't very good making rice stick together tight! fell apart second touched it  So sum up     1 point service 1 point ambiance 1 point food taste I say fish did taste fresh quality seemed safe good  However back?

sat booth side instead chairs   wierd  <EOR> Authentic Japanese food   no but really good modern Japanese food  Yellowtail Jalapeno everytime order dish   Probably could eat 3 plates Black Cod Miso Excellent but better eat rice share  because miso become overwhelming   But could've 4 bottles Grey Goose night before speaking  Creamy Crab tasty but salty again good sharing  Creamy rock shrimp tempura excellent  Blue fin toro caviar excellent  Blue fin toro truffles special time really worth $100 6 pieces   Just order Blue fin toro sushi sometimes simple better  Would venture every other trip LV   Haven't tried other Nobus compare but chance Bahamas  <EOR> I feel name speaks itself don't need guy tell food good here  being said best Japanese style meals life place  let chef decide going eat told them didn't custom tailored way  Once incredible craft cocktails I couple highballs waiter start bring courses perfect speed  wait watch your every move sure all your needs catered too  food second none  Must haves I don't know if always menu black cod entree which tastes nothing ever before  Uni spoons fish carpaccio famous Yuzu vinaigrette matcha flavored cronut tm dessert  If you're vegas Nyc Malibu area stop real treat  <EOR> We eaten twice once Honeymoon once March 2011   challenge vegetarian Gluten free   Both times extremely accomodating knowledgable   We tofu sashimi hearts palm salad mushroom rice dish various rolls flourless chocolate cake never forget   The ambiance reminds urban outfitter mean great way   The service world class   Friendly appropriately casual approachable while also knowledgable     The food fantastic  <EOR> Was very excited nobu made advanced reservations  Service excellent food mediocre small portions very expensive  Another thing ridiculous barracuda sashimi $40  Paid less tuna which very funny because tuna should more expensive  wife three sushi orders app  185 00 price would much rather Flemings palms Ruth Chris  If want good sushi koi planet Hollywood  <EOR> If manage reservation PASS PLACE UP   best sushi ever outside Japan   fact actually fly fish fresh Japan every single day     My menu recommendations  ie three things don't bother going all  Miso Eggplant Yellowtail Jalapeno Cilantro Yuzu Sauce Thinly Sliced White Fish Ponzu Sauce   Though extensive experience NOBU menu opinion three dishes most outstanding options menu   Now when NOBU gorge myself ordering multiples just three dishes   I also recommend restaurant beer brand   lighter more crisp most Japanese beer fact tastes more Chinese beer me  <EOR> I'm sorry drop average number stars Nobu well least Las Vegas   high hopes place dining Hawaii   Total change scenery here   Very Loud casual   should known being its Hard Rock Cafe but thought people would step here   knock off star just ambiance price i dont mind paying high prices but expect total experience price pay Had knock off star food   Black cod Miso good but little slimy quite couple bones pick out  price caliber Nobu touts should no bones  The glass wine tasted old also      Luckily Yellowtail sashimi w Jalepeno still highlight     Not place full expect pay lot skip edamame bottled water that'll add 20 more your bill     <EOR> If only sushi Nobu would 5 stars me  But knock off 2 stars service  walked Saturday night seats sushi bar which place be  sushi chef's suggestions which Nobu's house specialties including new style sashimi  consist best fish sashimi style delicate sauces garnishes yellowtail jalapeno live octopus Peruvian chili paste whitefish salmon ponzu sauce tuna miso mustard sauce  Everything first class including Junmai Daiginjo sake   Then ordered bento box chocolate cake dessert  told would take 8 minutes cook  No problem bellies happily full sashimi  20 minutes later however still no dessert finally able flag someone down check it  Another ten minutes by  waiter then came tell mixup kitchen cake another table  He tried give plateful mochi ice cream tide over didn't over well last thing wanted eat plateful mochi ice cream then chocolate cake  Another ten minutes dessert came out  excellent but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half hour for  ask ed check while still eating   took another ten minutes   gave credit card another ten minutes by   waiter came tell credit card isn't clearing want give another card? point well over hour gone since dessert ordered just wanted leave already    When check finally arrived did charge dessert took over 30 minutes arrive table  When mentioned server he took right off bill  But miffed even ask right thing would take off first place   Too bad since until ordered dessert very pleased sushi wonderful chef served us  Even Saturday night Vegas service unacceptably unresponsive such high end restaurant  <EOR> I'm shocked high reviews place  Did one off terrible experience? December father husband celebratory dinner  good overpriced cocktail bar then seated possibly worst table place despite months early reservation  booth back server pow wow area cash register next massive table really drunk really loud patrons  Ok fine  Ordered many dishes including small plates entrees sushi rolls etc  father clear waiter he doesn't mushrooms pertinent later     Our 3 tacos come $34 worth tacos SMALLEST most laughable portion size ever  literally laughed loud when put them down  no bigger lime wedges I posted photo   Very good but ridiculously priced sized  Ok fine   The other dishes start come they're timed terribly  Sushi entrees entrees different times   I ate alone basically while companions looked waiting food  father's entree comes WRONG one  Finally when actual dinner arrives covered mushrooms  waiter never mentioned could problem when father placed order menu mentioned nothing mushrooms  Ok fine   My husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes also laughably undersized  Literally 9 pieces fish $80  When Morimoto Philadelphia $50 sashimi plate easily 3x amount fish it  Same quality  Vegas but joke  waiter never explained fish plate just left husband guess  last straw   Overall food fine but many other places serve comparable stuff way better prices  Nobu nothing special  hope sake other diners experience typical but enough burn frequent Vegas traveler  back  <EOR> One motto's feast Nobu whenever wherever Nobu nearby  just made up   Las Vegas Nobu did disappoint     The blue fin toro tartare ossetra caviar favorite caviar bomb admit ordered twice same meal  50 bucks serving wasn't cheap but worth amount ossetra toro dish    I also two uni shooters omg good   Monkfish pate caviar  YUM!!! Would probably skip next time more uni   Nobu crispy rice tuna point meal secretly unbuttoned pants stealth mode     And course rock shrimp jalepeno sauce   Next eating other person can't blame being glutton japanese wagyu tataki which craving since recent trip Japan  Melt in your mouth good   We both chef's daily omakase which outstanding finished light deconstructed cheesecake thing couldn't eat   THEN  didn't eat day   SO GOOD expensive yes but pay for!

Gotta respect integrity  <EOR> I've eaten 4 other restaurants admit food service very consistent   We showed 11 people 8 person reservation accommodated immediately   Drinks brought fast fee appetizers   Once all ordered dinners though thinks little downhill   two full plates sushi front almost 10 minutes before anyone else ordered   delivery food sporadic basically just took turns watching each other eat  1 point most memorable part dinner cheap takeout quality give your tongue splinters chopsticks!  cheap disposable splinters firewood?  Such cheap item upgrade instead totally ruined dinner table   it going good steak house being given plastic knife cut your filet   Two table somehow offered dessert while rest never even saw menu heard offerings 1 again lack service   Not much social scene expecting Hard Rock but still better options Vegas sushi    About half price Massa but sacrifice service little bit   Still better other strip options far quality food though  <EOR> Absolutely wonderful experience  Everything place really exceeded expectations    The ambiance food service staff    All waiters seem know menu upside down which extremely important   wonderful recommendations very friendly    I recommend Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer salmon crunchy roll horchata flan  few other things but everything seasonal might menu    Overall great restaurant  <EOR> Hands down best sushi ever had   other items amazing kobe beef melts your mouth   Honestly best meals entire life   ambiance spectacular service impeccable   waitstaff friendly full good recommendations   Hard Rock Hotel   Stick around might see Tommy Lee I did   <EOR> Five stars all around!  Amazing food fantastic service nice ambiance!!! would recommend restaurant anyone anytime if willing pay high end DELICIOUS dining experience  <EOR> Gastronomically exceptional  expecting more upscale atmosphere contemplating going elsewhere until head waiter Bijan came over    He professional confident exceptionally eloquent presenting dinner options  nearly 3hrs remained Bijan created multi course meal specifically tailored food preferences palates    It wasn't just every course blew minds but service incredible  Its probably best summarize going Nobu experience never forget  <EOR> Best Sushi yet!!! am huge sashimi fan usually play safe rolls but restaurant truly divine pallet experience!!  chef's recommendations well sweet shrimp husband likes Uni  tried Uni time before another sushi restaurant totally repulsed it  server urged try restaurant amazing! Everything absolutely perfect  Very flavorful fresh! only down fall could eaten more!  sure splurge restaurants when visit Vegas  <EOR> So many reviews state Nobu expensive  Yes but exactly expensive restaurant should be  High quality professional service top line food  eaten Nobu Hard Rock Casino Vegas 3 times now find excellent    My average bill per person $150  including $60 bottle saki couple $15 martini's  Without drinks wife probably would spend $100 $120 each  also without trying cheap  If wanted eat budget would completely possible order couple $12 $15 Sushi rolls couple $12 $15 skewers tab runs $60 $70  However opinion would defeating purpose because while budget yourself into turning place into typical sushi bar real goods signature dishes separate them rest more expensive plates    Their main signature dish yellowtail jalepeno sashimi  Definitely appetizer portion but very tasty if sashimi  personal favorite blackened cod butter lettuce wrap  last time listed menu but when mentioned knew exactly talking whipped us  Also appetizer portion but very different very good  fish literally melts your mouth  Another recommendation Wagyu Beef Gyoza  sort beef filled pot sticker cooked perfection  beef imported Japan Australia depending which decide comes incredible dipping sauce  little more filling order well  sushi rolls good but nothing can't another place good sushi  However recommend getting couple rolls yourself filled then couple specials order keep your cost reasonable    The service great  Then waiters waitresses good attitude know menu back hand  If just tell them you're feeling put together meal works you  someone coming fill your water bring another drink every time need all well trained communicate high end table    As much branch try new restaurants place always going hard pass when am town  <EOR> This first time ever dined three other Yelpers curious see where other reviews come in  Personally four stars little high but really enjoyed three dishes didn't dislike anything give four albeit unenthusiastically  I don't think ever typed longer word unenthusiastically    The black cod miso highlight  Kobe beef amazing but all misread menu when showed $192 I'd call hands down most overpriced thing ever eaten  scallops topped jalapeno third great dish  sushi fine though nothing spectacular   The ambiance surprisingly boring especially Vegas  looks way Japanese restaurant might if designed high school drama department all cheap bamboo reeds sloppy wood structures  service though efficient humorless  Any waitress can't understand genius asking if any beef based desserts off menu winning any points me   Still price minus Kobe totally reasonable especially Vegas  Matsuhisa martinis long way toward adding pretty good meal  <EOR> So Vegas looking somewhere eat isn't named TV show chef?!? place where food fresh all fried? would great place start Had dinner while town conference beginning month some business acquaintances town all three pretty familiar Vegas offer multiple aspects ! didn't wait big plus! server super knowledgeable fish served menu including pricing    The other two pleasure dining asked server recommend few choices he did all agreed allow expertise guide meal  He ordered few dishes great then requested just more he complied  texture flavor presentation amazing  sushi all over country rated top 5  flavors made palate insane !! 5 stars food !   So total 5 dishes bargain price over $250 wasn't including tip  Upon review receipt  dish charged three times mere $18 charge questioned server politely explained he took liberty ordering three orders each table could two pieces    sure he did  other three dishes average $60 ish each hmm     would thought he would courtesy pick variety dishes price point speaking highest menu courtesy ask if group budget price point verses assuming  tip alone paid internet bill month addition half cell phone bill    Out courtesy all reached cards slightly cringing accounting people going say when saw horrifically high dinner three other two decided would take heat cost    sure he going explain one    Moral story is always order your own food Vegas unless unlimited budget! Thus 4 star rating minus star common courtesy respecting client customer  <EOR> I only fan couple different kinds sushi  Not anymore  am fan array sushi!

When trying new sushi restaurants always order some basics foundation compare against other places  ordered sushi sashimi plates  Both decent very good fish but *great* except two big disappointments tuna really mediocre hello! take easy wasabi chef! Sushi chefs use much wasabi trying cover not so fresh fish they're just really good making sushi  fish seemed pretty fresh don't think trying cover anything which leaves        Maybe should've lower expectations when came maybe Nobu only good fancier dishes  But prices charge regular sushi sashimi just worth it   The service gets 4  decor vibe gets 2 5  if prices maybe 30 40% lower could easily given them 3 maybe even 4 stars  But I'd give them 2 5  But since yelp doesn't let give half stars I'd round off overpriced place 2  <EOR> BLUF   The dining highlight trip Vegas girlfriend dinner Nobu   third trip Nobu each time having Chef's Omakase Tasting Menu   Nobu's tasting menu thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki style sort themed meal seeks tie together individual dishes attributes taste texture temperature enhance overall experience meal   Since isn't set menu select price point you're willing pay Chef kitchen staff prepares appropriate amount courses using whatever exotic ingredients deem fit   both received 9 courses sake pairing    First course started Kumamoto Oyster wrapped smoked salmon topped osetra caviar served endive leaf asparagus boat accompanied sweet sour miso sauces   masterful start!  5 basic tastes tastefully elegantly captured together single dish!

Come vegetarians all time!!'    but then followed 'Well we're actually vegans     ' which waiter said 'Let check chef right back '   Apparently kitchen 'wanted challenge'     went!  Sat down decided order omakase meal  Usually consists six plates plus dessert but actually EIGHT TWO desserts one each two different desserts     say AMAZING?! food kitchen came AMAZING  actually stuffed time sixth course food came around and thought last! but TWO more came  time dessert served didn't think could fit anymore into stomachs  But managed Food service everything impeccable  Def would highly recommend visit  Worth every penny!! Very impressed came well  <EOR> I girls  service great  All wait staff men!   atmosphere bustling  ordered few maki rolls yellowfin jalapeño crab house roll  would opt house roll  Overall everything very fresh  tasting menu taking into account your budget your taste customize something you  Oh can't forget alcohol  some Nobu  If you're into Sushi   it's must least once  <EOR> Yikes happened?  Consistency isn't Nobu's strengths apparently which believe should priority if going charge customers much do   ordered cheaper $100 omakase again which believe good deal given amount food but quality fish gone downhill since last visit   The signature hamachi jalapeno?  Devoid all velvety tenderness   salmon sashimi?  chewing rug   maguro nigiri?  Stringy tough   On top all ventured tried hamachi kama   bad but terrible $20   San Diego same size hamachi kama every bite just if more succulent $9   no excuse honestly   If going charge $20 better sure single sliver white meat dry   Half fish but luckily dipping sauce keep meat being unbearable palate   Nobu isn't complete loss though   stated before omakase great deal price wise   comes famed bento dessert which even better remembered being last time   also tried miso almond cake edamame ice cream which great unique creative the taste quite honestly *salty* but all paled comparison flourless chocolate cake crowned green tea ice cream bento   Never tempted order different dessert Nobu   Ever   Same black cod   Yes small yes expensive if order la carte but worth every luscious bite   should must order if come it comes omakase but good should probably just order another    One item part omakase menu uni tempura set   Perhaps deep frying hides any flaws uni but could taste warm sweet flavor know associated high quality freshness   Gotta love juicy mushroom refreshing shiso comes too   set also accompanied set delightful salts all used enhance opinion needs no enhancement   Still nice look though some good pictures!  I also tried eponymous sakes impressed   Can't remember which but price reasonable   Wonderfully smooth paired well fish   highly recommend served hot   While maintain A OK Nobu doubt coming back   other places better Japanese food  and better prices  <EOR> Yum  best tempura so light crispy ever great desserts  Yeah pricey seats could more comfortable but still loved it  <EOR> Originally posted winodepot com  *** Date May 18 2007 Location 4455 Paradise Road @ Hard Rock Hotel Corkage $15 $20 can't bring bottle  list Cost $180 person including tax tip Phone 702 693 5090  Hummm     where start  recommended dinner companion when Ame palate trust  even many disappointing fine dining restaurants hotel properties figured would give Nobu shot  Should known better     Standard menu well two different tier omakase available $100 $135 if recall correctly  decided $135 version all three three cold course two hot course followed soup sushi dessert   Writing week later can't remember exactly weekend Vegas tends short circuit one's memory    Think started course Bonito sashimi which fresh nice flavor combinations  two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable very apparent since can't recall much details them  Moving onto first hot course which remember but wrong reason  Some sort white fish Cod Halibut done sweet sour stir fry style touch spice  Sorry but if am looking take money Panda Express any food court local mall  The second hot course steak filet cut   I think  Topped piece seared foie gras couple slices egg plant Shitake mushroom  Probably best course evening very few steak course enjoyed part tasting menu definite rarity  Soup sushi dessert brought conclude omakase menu all pedestrian nothing write home about   Not only food very interesting decoration space also seem kind odd  What's suppose fine dining restaurant really very cheap feel it  anyone thinking trying place think again avoid if possible  <EOR> Again place delivers food   new ice cream stuff pastries off menu item  serious crowd pleaser   tenderloin over wagu  better cheaper  <EOR> Had much fun first night SHOT show!

I would willing bet just anything menu nothing short amazing but favorites included Yellowtail Sashimi Jalapeño garnished cilantro which also offer roll Spicy Scallop Roll  Now cool things Nobu only know sushi but perfected number imported Kobe Wagyu beef dishes well  favorite Wagyu Beef Tataki which thinly sliced similar sashimi perfectly marbled lightly seared beef requires little no chewing   I'm telling literally melts your mouth! drink choice very refreshing Pineapple Martini which perfect balance spice much food selections  if sweet drink highly recommend it!  The atmosphere would call high class zen river rocks bamboo ambient lighting abound   and even more hip beautiful night! Vegas ton great restaurants but if find yourself sushi craving Sin City yourself favor rush over Nobu   and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish head over anyway   it's sure your best dining experiences city! <EOR> 5 stars all around awesome establishment  Groupon which paid $100 bucks Signature Five Course Tasting Menu Two People  Every single piece fish fresh delicious  could tell wasn't your average sushi restaurant    1st course tai sashimi dry miso FAVORITE DISH!!!! 2nd course yellowtail jalapeño roll two piece salmon wasabi salsa sushi two piece scallop tiradito sushi two piece tuna sushi 3rd course rock shrimp tempura creamy spicy sauce 4th course black cod miso  5th course dessert chocolate cake green tea ice cream mixed berries I zero no complaints courses offered  partner thoroughly enjoyed quality sushi place  fancy restaurant portions expected small  If walk expecting huge servings definitely picked wrong restaurant lol   We weeknight reservation service super quick attentive  ordered Peruvian Caipirinha cocktail which awesome kick ginger beer   Overall steal deal  paid additional $20 bucks + 20% tip $20 course  All all paid $140 delicious five course tasting menu  service also great  treated really well even Groupon checked upon multiple times throughout night  really impressed left feeling satisfied entire experience  I'd highly reccomend place any date night! <EOR> Ah sushi   Sushi sushi sushi   love theory but reality bit squeamish   However place off charts good   am connoisseur but far best ever had  <EOR> It doesn't any better could eat every week  yellow tail which must Pork belly Miso Cod lovely dessert  Ask your waiter good season disappointed manager staff really nice really top game  Super knowledgeable friendly  Can t wait back again <EOR> Forget hype    your neighborhood sushi place strip mall probably better   Sure don't Vegas scene but also probably better service similar quality whole lot more money left your pocket   only brief star night hostess stand   Friendly fault patiently waited entire party 6 full 30 minutes reservation time didn't punish poor table attitude   server fair guests table ask bribe beer delivered but expect Sunday night 8pm     hmmm   BTW restaurant noisy barely hear people your own table   Good luck  <EOR>
