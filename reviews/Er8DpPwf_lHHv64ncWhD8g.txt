As far portions reuben certainly winner sandwich practically bursting open   However don't think tasted amazing others described   certainly appreciated all meat but abundance sauerkraut very overwhelming think sauerkraut corned beef rather corned beef sauerkraut    Conversely tater tots just good hoped   could little crispier but  minor quibble   just wish more!  Even though service good enough round THREE HALF STARS rounding down specifically because price   reuben wasn't awful $16 but $5 00 diet coke?   ridiculous even Vegas standards   Next time just stick cup water diet coke comped tables   <EOR> Indifferent poor service  Very bad fish chips  High prices  only thing passable Henry salad  better places  <EOR> Ate while staying Cosmopolitan  ordered Benedict's Florentine  used canned spinach don't recommend entree  Potato pancake pretty good  Other entrees looked better latte great service great well  <EOR> Overall throughout weekend stay Cosmo LV JCK Jewelry Show Mandalay Bay ate all 3 mornings  would highly recommend Corned Beef Hash very good  egg whites side fruit instead poached eggs toast  fresh fruit lovely  did proceed second day  Now third day asked bartender he would recommend he stated Short Rib Benedict  amazing needless say did side fruit compliment it  only thing would changed first day food did come right service sub par  When sat bar last day    the food came quick service great!

Our table located right middle aisle too   Since checking bit cumbersome felt bags going spilt upon waiter   Also if checking cab restaurant located near front while lobby located back hotel   I think Henry Vesper Lounge should switch locations but really it   food nice hearty   would define full European breakfast best served brunch those only eat two meals day my recommended strategy when Vegas   <EOR> Our first meal upon arrival breakfast  ordered breakfast burrito short rib Benedict  Burrito big filling  Chorizo hash browns grilled inside flaky tortilla point  Accompanying salsa delicious   Short rib Benedict savory delicious  think rice base instead English muffin example topped short rib meat Demi glaze two perfectly poached eggs  Literally couldn't stop eating it   The service should unmentioned either  attentive much appreciate  <EOR> Have eaten Henry several times primarily extremely late nice activities within Marquee  place 24hr joints located within Cosmopolitan  Honestly bad option if you're craving something say 4am lol actually quite tasty  several things pancakes omelette tater tot nachos all meals solid hit proverbial spot   Overall I'd recommend place but bring your wallet costs bit more $ then most 24hr casino cafes      Pros Location Food Service Menu Taste  Cons Pricey Small  Limited late night menu <EOR> Phenomenal experience! Booked private room bachelorette party  service impeccable food point beyond reasonably priced 3 course meal drinks 15 people    The restaurant itself pretty casual lacked ambiance would liked  Another downside no bathrooms site walk through casino nearest one  terrible use bathroom several times during dinner outfit required assistance order so  Faults all still think should consider restaurant special occasion just darn fine meal  <EOR> cinnamon french toast pretty awesome   wasn't impressed omelet  <EOR> Centrally located strip beautiful decor casual but elevated diner meals all made great brunch experience    Last night more couple drinks strip thought I'd eat only little because stomach wasn't feeling it    I ordered most interesting item Brunch menu Short Rib Eggs Benedict  thought going much  When landed table perfectly proportioned stomach issue cleared good thing because thing delicious all around  best poached eggs resting perfectly cooked short rib bed hash browns underneath  ended breaking yolk mixed parts together could all goodness each bite    I want come back try more menu  <EOR> Hash eggs amazing!  typically something would order but limb glad did!!  Bloody Mary good but best   fresh squeezed orange juice tasty!  Next time go      mimosa all way   coffee lovers serve Illy   Love brew! <EOR> We tried Overlook Grill Cosmo morning before decided try Henry breakfast time  Located East Tower end near entrance off strip place open very nicely decorated hip bar dining restaurant  But friends place try breakfast morning because looked nice convenient  10am place wasn't crowded no line up    so seated immediately   Like previous morning ordered called Henry Breakfast     supposedly Specialty breakfasts  Again choose want your eggs choice pork sausage chicken apple sausage hash browns toast    I ordered egg white scramble chicken apple sausage time  friends ordered Croque Monsieur Omelet which filled Canadian bacon caramelized onions Swiss cheese breakfast potato toast side   The portions very generous server very nice enough kitchen split dish into two both plates looked FULL breakfast orders! breakfast excellent well worth $18 all food     of course bit expensive but Cosmo Strip    so did expect  If you're looking some place cheaper then sure there's Denny's somewhere within few miles strip    All say breakfast absolutely delicious     my eggs perfectly cooked smooth fluffy hash browns unique yummy chicken apple sausage sourdough toast just made perfect     and very filling     breakfast  Service excellent server helpful attentive friendly throughout  really enjoyed everything  <EOR> I love Cosmopolitan Hotel all other restaurants premise but late night eat just very ordinary quite disappointing  came 1am busy but lack servers  fruit bowl which lacking only grapes strawberries pineapple dry  tater tots overload everything    First bite good but latter intolerable grease  Overall regular diner food 4 star price tag  <EOR> Very nice convenient inside Cosmo  Wait long seated  Wait staff great  Orange juice super good! Food    ok  don't want judge turkey club just because hungry really mood eat time  But presentation good! Well definitely come next trip LV! <EOR> What fabulous spot great burger drink  located just inside Cosmopolitan open air corner near street gives sense being casino part action but just tucked away enough take breather minute  food drink excellent recommend burger  Noelle stellar bartender  <EOR> We decided try place staycation  Long line table but worth it  hubby said best eggs he ever had    he picky  Delicious hash browns coffee really good regular restaurant coffee  Illy  Yum! back! <EOR> We checking Cosmo but wanted breakfast before left! Being group five being seated right away noon wasn't completely expected! compliments Eddie waiter he very accommodating us! drinks wasn't all expected he something else flavor! He also extremely nice fun laugh many times he came see us! Thank taking care us! <EOR> Bottom line first nice place drawbacks   We arrived just little 11am  thought  reasonably early Sunday brunch but quoted waited 40+ minutes seated   almost into argument hostess when updated 10 more minutes when still wait double time mention seeing some parties seemingly able walk without being placed queue   Having said checked line Eggslut line wrapping around wall likely least 30 minute wait also    Once seated service very good  ordered immediately because obviously starving then  Fortunately both short rib egg Benedict Brioche french toast came fast   both very good although spectacular  latter gigantic ask box fit last 1 3    Aside convinced bottled water provided every table truly bottled slightly funny taste but free guess can't complain much    Tip Call 702 698 7280 direct line restaurant placement into queue  if they're busy pick phone    Just realized wrote review initially book reservation Yelp!  Downer no validation parking anywhere Cosmopolitan  Prepare pay $7 parking between 1 4 hours  <EOR> I meat loaf great  sauce glazed spicy  Rochelle treated amazing came Sunday night pretty big party  wasn't lot people she paid great attention us  <EOR> The only reason place two stars freshly squeezed orange juice  food pricey taste leaves much desired  think might better off finding 2 99 steak eggs rather spending upwards $50 breakfast here! <EOR> We wanted place great well just isn't  If coming food find another spot  If right seat see happening casino least know paying for  Next time gamble money food  <EOR> The henry nice expensive place breakfast  cost $160 4 girls  just meal drink  breakfast very delicious though waiter steve absolutely kind!   Steve highly attentive very kind he even gave advice best ways take cabs vegas since expressed having issues    Our food ticket lost wondering why taking long breakfast come but steve honest told gave free round mimosas!   I would totally come back here  <EOR> Fun hip relaxing place grab quick meal  Prices reasonable considering hotel   Easy fuel back fun  <EOR> We chose Henry breakfast morning because good reviews  pretty delicious! California omelette which came roasted potatoes done perfection your choice bread though if don't banana bread which phenomenal insane   omelette buttery perfect topped few slices avocado stuffed insane amounts bacon cheese  fiance Strawberry Shortcake pancakes side hash browns  hash browns absolute favorite  Overall bad place breakfast!
