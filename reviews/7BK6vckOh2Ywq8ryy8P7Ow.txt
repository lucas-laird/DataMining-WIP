But definetly  check !! <EOR> Yummy kids love food prepared fresh delicious  sweet potato fries good hamburgers huge  watched employee walk assist disabled person into car super impressed customers service kindness   back <EOR> I going Rumbi 2 years now across street where work  offered Groupons quite often lunch buddy always enjoyed fact tofu option she vegetarian  buddy moved away hadn't while  last week realized some little thing shave changed    I always order rumbi rice teriyaki chicken bowl large kind split into two meals  am used veggies bowl being slightly crisp time soggy whole meal  seemed extra saturated oil  little nervous when meal came only 2 minutes ordering when usually would take little while longer but would taste much fresher    I always order water used give big blue glasses now complimentary water comes around little plastic cup  guess used old way considered nice little touch fast casual place  may some people taking advantage free water cup when hog wild some soda    The customer service continues spot on  staff always welcoming accommodating  think enough spot again unless coupon discount because rice bowl ends being close $10 soggy veggies just do  <EOR> I normally ready review right going restaurant but definitely ahead here  purchased Groupon which gave $16 worth food only $8 Which today 7 11 13 still available!   Today forgot lunch decided lunch break ventured down Maryland Parkway restaurant  normally Cafe Rio nice change   Upon entering somewhat island themed restaurant really nice colors  really use past along dark brown wood seating  looked menu plethora different food selections could choose  Although looked all photos Yelp all look delicious decided volcano chicken sandwich regular French fries iced tea   The volcano chicken sandwich topped Swiss cheese cilantro Mayo pineapple salsa lettuce red onions  chicken itself seasoning rather large piece chicken  perfectly grilled placed delicious white bun  Now bun your typical bun delicious artisan tight bun perfect large portion chicken place inside along all garnishments come your sandwich   I work took first bite literally shocked  chicken tender perfectly cooked juicy didn't even put salt it  those know put salt everything even before taste very nasty habit LOL   regular French fries cooked perfectly seasoned really well didn't try  sweet potato fries  but looked delicious  opted drink cup bring back believe its only $0 25 refill next time come  chose iced tea lemon really liked tea tasted kinda hibiscus mango super yummy!!  I def reccommend going trying sandwiches also daily specials during week which include drink!! <EOR> This review two times visited Rumbi Island Grill  heard Rumbi's grand opening through BOGO coupon boyfriend acquired earlier week  decided try since nearby UNLV located just next Rebelbooks    ATMOSPHERE Outside restaurant someone passing samples some kind teriyaki flavored beef rice  Very inviting  Inside Hawaiian themed walls decorations nice all reminiscent garish colored Hawaiian t shirts   FOOD Kind expensive side if BOGO coupons  first time Cabo Fish Tacos Kahuna Burger  Both portions huge full flavor  well seasoned fish tacos some kind tropical salsa came coconut rice burger juicy pineapple inside matched perfectly teriyaki sauce  SECOND visit    good first visit however  time both tried salads disappointed flavor portion sizes matched $8 price  Aloha Chicken Salad almost no flavor unless drenched dressing which chose do  Jamaican Jerk Caesar Salad also bland would including chicken dressing    SERVICE service first week great  couple weeks later during second visit girl cash register very nice but guy manager seemed little bit hurried side when answering questions didn't feel welcome   Overall say stick recommended burgers entrees filling satisfying  Everything else small portioned expensive prices  <EOR> LOVE RUMBI! food always fresh delicious quick! Best part student discount long show your student ID <EOR> I picked rice bowl shrimp  home opened food started eating  rice cooked all hard rocks  wasn't edible all  ended throwing away whole bowl  Seriously sells uncooked rice bowl?

My only suggestion would smell there       buttery?  Oily?  something I'd want order enough notice   Perhaps cakes which sorely tempted gooey pineapple upside down cupcake signs   Next time! <EOR> Ok fire chicken unless plain grilled bland chicken   pork grilled sirloin if want amazing flavor experience   tried half sirloin half pork over noodles amazing   really am starting love place! <EOR> Love sweet potato fries burgers literally  staff really nice swift  love give stamp card 3 dollars off coupon especially if want save big time  recommend eating during your break work school  Shoot know because can't enough those sweet potato fries  <EOR> Loved place  Haven't gone while but used all time when would school near there  As soon walk walk counter order your food then pick your seating  They're very clean never seen food leftover any tables mess  They cook your food quickly let tell food great! bought 4 5 different things menu loved them all! I would definitely recommend place anybody looking good burger  fairly cheap! <EOR> Fantastic! Everything's very clean organized  tried teriyaki bowl Rambo fries  fantastic!! Definitely coming back again try something else  <EOR> I loved set small restaurant fact right across street UNLV   came lunch part fundraiser student organization  ended ordering tofu spicy teriyaki bowl $7 95 came white rice veggies fountain drink total $11 +change   customer service impressive first cashier abnormally friendly guy brought food grabbed fork  Even though cashier tried sell into buying pineapple cake dessert still liked guy    It wasn't until sat down realized duped! When asked drink replied simple yes  cashier automatically given large drink he sold though without knowing consent   hate when restaurants because feel almost unethical  Ask size want damn it! else just assume you're giving regular size  peeved but didn't bother saying anything because figured hey money going towards fundraiser  Remember specify exactly want if Rumbi's   Now food just okay  veggies overcooked i e broccoli lost all its green color squishy max  spicy factor asked seriously lacking  Last rice hard crunchy soft fluffy    I probably won't come back Rumbi's  restaurant 4 star rating but just didn't level experience  only giving place 3 stars instead 2 because grateful tofu dish employee saved trip getting fork  <EOR> First time experiencing Rumbi Island Grill give thumbs up! boyfriend Calypso Spinach Salad mine grilled shrimp beef sirloin YUM!  I ordered dressing side ended needing it  flavors grilled shrimp mixed perfectly   Great menu staff pricing!  Looking forward trying other items! <EOR> This cool somewhat novelty addition usual UNLV eatery rounds Chiptole Cafe Rio Cugino's etc when forget pack lunch lol  place especially helpful vegetarian options rice bowl tofu Jamaican Jerk twice now though tasted more teriyaki sauce least bit spicy    I still thought reasonably good! Another plus brown rice    Also late staff generous $3 off coupons  first time came gave two The only downside felt just much rice compared protein veggies which somehow made Filipino feel just teensy bit gypped! Nevertheless probably back see other options menu fare <EOR> I just first veggie burger today delicious!   Thank having cruelty free options! <EOR> First visit here  staff really nice  food ok  ordered luau pork n grilled chicken bowl  First thing noticed huge portion rice  pork really soft chicken very tender  Ill most likely return  <EOR> I should've written update while back but something called life   After initial review owner contacted right away apologized bad experience  honest but bad service received employee no longer anymore ruined whole experience really didn't care food tasted like  just wanted eat leave! Anyhow haven't back yet but apology follow concerns received really genuine planning going back soon  just kinda far but back <EOR> Food great but service bit slow side  If you're hurry then might want elsewhere  <EOR> I'm really sad say major FAIL me   came around 5 30pm Saturday night   No restaurant   2 employees working cashier cook    ordered BBQ chicken salad orange chicken bowl   Also rumba fries   groupon paid 8 00 16 00 worth food   pay 3 more dollars   took FOREVAH!! food served me   salad big tons lettuce much chicken   spouse served teriyaki chicken bowl   said isn't ordered    cook said Yes said Nope its    Spouse said she would just eat it   bite she says taste chicken    tasted didn't taste chicken tasted pork   brought back said wanted originally ordered     That took another 10 15 min   point 6 other customers came cook overwhelmed   Ridiculous    spouse frozen reheated chicken nuggets drizzled orange sauce canned mandarin oranges   She barely touched overcooked fries   No Thanks Rumbi Grill   Wont back  <EOR>
