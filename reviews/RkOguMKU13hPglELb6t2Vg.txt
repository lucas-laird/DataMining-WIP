Food questionable! Few selections during buffet hours limited Indian beer selection well  way hungry ate drank available  <EOR> This surprisingly excellent meal   Rio nicest casino Las Vegas but back restaurant   only clean quiet closed off Casino but staff helpful food superb   very accommodating when asked vegan options   nice respite chaos Las Vegas  <EOR> Service mostly     reluctant? Best word guess  Food merely ok  Everything ala cart no rice naan bread served unless want pay it  Never experienced Indian restaurant   Way WAY overpriced fir is   Another victim its own pretentious over inflated opinion itself simply because casino  Find someplace strip they're pretty good downtown  <EOR> I am pleasantly surprised experienced food here   chose buffet everything wonderfully fresh delicious beautifully unique seasoning without being heavy   way somewhere else Rio stumbled onto this   decor exquisite felt royalty when entered beautiful restaurant   All say no should pass up   You'll experience wonderful meal great service  <EOR> We ate quickly before heading into Penn Teller   chose Indian because vegan generally meat free stuff Indian menu    service stellar ambiance lovely   food much   Eggplant Bhata though asked extremely spicy governing flavor salt  nearly inedible   value few bites very expensive fail   would done better storefront Indian place    sons husband just okay food   don't need back  <EOR> This Gordon's Hell Kitchen experience     I came place felt robbed  over $40 USD per head less average food no favors clueless service they least bill right though    If don't believe am say just see restaurant 95% empty dinner even better dinner experience yourself be sure share =      We made reservation dinner Saturday May 2013 thinking restaurant crowded because its Vegas  checked menu before hand saw fairly expensive offering main courses $25+ vegetarian dishes $15+ reasonable expectations decent meal     When arrived 6 30pm see restaurant basically empty  There's only other table  felt something wrong but then thought may early Vegas people coming yet I wrong!    I debating Okra vs  Veg  Biryani asked waitress kind vegetables Biryani  She said peas   rice peas $19 00? What? even meal? OK ordered Paneer Appetizer Okra Lamb Curry main courses Nan rice which also rice peas but $9 00    The paneer came know shouldn't come  basically dry very little favor  tasted more paper cheese  When waitress came main course she blatantly commented she no idea ordered which dish only 3 tables!    Well could handled saying Lamb?   Obviously its first day  Though admit she doesn't many customers practice skills   The Okra extremely sour  tried very hard eat much don't time another meal due scheduled evening show  think ate may 1 3 Okra  sour dry can't figure whether rotten months someone washed feet Okra  Then tried some Lamb Curry wife's dish  meat tasted more goo source more puree curry just wrong thing  $26 USD small bowl may 10cm diameter not would want any more   rice below average couldn't taste much because sour Okra   Nan OK its only thing didn't mess up   In middle dinner another waitress came beer asked if ordered beer  did three tables time possibly mess up? Getting check really slow but don't care much that    The final bill + tips over $80 00 which most expensive meal Vegas until point worst many years  simply worse some very average Indian cuisine find California  We $130+ meal next day Eiffel Tower Restaurant which reasonably worth it    Finally say place fits exactly into definition Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen highly over priced clueless front house food lack favor above all no customers hemorrhaging cash  If don't major Ramsey over guys just going continue burn money close up     Don't here! some other reviews may decent lunch but am going try   <EOR> It over priced even better any reasonably priced ones   ate half dish when asked them box other half took left over never came it   When asked them happened gave something    just came home find wasn't lamb sag which but tofu sag which much much cheaper lamb   pissed   now know why weren't any other us  <EOR> Excellent Indian food  Nice surprise Rio  Server Aman very pleasant efficient  <EOR> Stumbled upon place because friend staying Rio needed find something could both eat  vegetarian Indian food seemed good option  place rather empty but took chance WOW glad did  am surprised place isn't packed every night  thought food amaaaaaazing  cocktails too  full bar moscow mules ordered made perfection copper mugs then while ordering waiter very helpful answering questions helped choices  two veggie appetizers Veggie Samosas Veggie Pakora   both great but Veggie Samosas better any ever had! big two order excellent  main dish waiter helped choose   and Navratan Korma veggie dish assorted veggies creamy sauce   it world! ordered rice came some peas course Indian naan bread  All around fantastic dinner back sure  <EOR> This place deserves 5 stars  dinner weekend while Vegas great experience  ambiance quality food service fantastic  ordered chicken curry tasted just homemade dish  also ordered samosas delicious  icing cake fantastic friendly service waiter Aman  definitely coming back again next time we're Vegas! <EOR> Pretty standard Indian fare great   raita soupy flavorless   ate coupon associated Penn Teller show   think only reason why place stays open   rice $9 00!

The absolute best part waiter never saw again nerve put 30% tip he included bill automatically!! bill over $200 6 people  received very little food large bill given    I recommend see food buffet rio if considering going here  simply worth it  horrible service small portions deal breaker    Never again  <EOR> Great service   to begin with    servers didn't rush order coz familiar menu   and knew would want order basin me  <EOR> Royal India Bistro located inside Rio Hotel Casino  formerly known Gaylord  Indian restaurant sports world class ambiance however average service average food quality  food priced right levels commensurate quality   Papadum opening starter generally unnoticed however served mostly soft rather crispy side attention  disappointment   Bombay Chicken Wings Tasted hints authenticity however most pieces tough chew rather soft succulent  Another disappointment   Chicken Tikka Masala dish highlight dinner  full Flavor spices released aroma authenticity  felt sauce curry runny side should more creamy presented  Better average overall   Chicken Tandoori Expected better presentation standard throw buffet quality chicken Tandoori pieces bed onions type thing  Average taste   Summary Food consistently failed match ambiance  Pricing acceptable  Service average  <EOR> It ok  Just ok  papadum stale waiter brought another plate but barely better  prices those expected hotel overpriced  LOVE Indian food but when order came temperature partially warm partially cool  it's supposed hot just cooked but disappointed really just wanted leave  waitress attentive but never back would recommend Royal Indian Bistro  Maybe because late lunch in between lunch dinner caught kitchen off guard   If could give 2 5 stars would being generous 3 stars  impressed elephant statues aesthetics yeah looked fancy but I'd take hole in wall kind restaurant quality kitchen instead because want good food  <EOR> I think important everyone know place charges $9 rice  literally speechless when informed this  never Indian restaurant and many where entree doesn't come rice  else supposed eat curry? Las Vegas its finest  can't even eat without getting ripped off   The food itself wasn't bad just unremarkable  menu pretty limited  better food strip mall  <EOR> Decided check place cause long time   Buffet lunch 11am 4pm   Arrived 1105am Indian couple walked just before standing behind them please wait seated podium   waited several minutes before male server turned he seated Indian couple them drinks walked them around buffet then disappeared   couple now back table eating when lady server saw sat me   Noticed both stayed back majority time   New customers waited several minutes front then ended leaving  Never drink refills service very average  Food selection smallish Indian lunch buffet   But quality good spice level also good  <EOR> $20 weekend lunch buffet good value considering options town  Minimal selections took forever replenish tandoori chicken unsatisfying meal  Slow service despite total 3 tables last visit  <EOR> The food ok  Much better finding Indian food all  raita amazing  <EOR> First off star reflection upon food quality taste  service okay server nice   The food presentation good please see pictures   food looked appetizing but failed any taste   We players recommended first timers wanted sample variety foods had  bland lacked true flavoring Indian cuisine  really disappointed lassi despite ordering sweet lassi salty herbs overpowered drink   The food overpriced  don't think would come back unless change cook proper lassi    Bottom line tourist attraction iron elephants front trick into going in  worth price  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised find Indian Restaurant tucked away inside Rio   restaurant bit small but very beautiful   nicest Indian Restaurant ever you're even greeted 2 elephant statues entrance   lunch buffet 11am 4pm   less $20 all usual Indian Buffet type food   There's good condensed mix veggie meat dishes which find common most Indian Buffets   food tasted great but wish bit more spicy   Usually Indian Buffets stay more mild end appease everyone no big deal   Garlic Naan amazing though   Probably most perfectly baked Naan bread ever had   perfectly crisp without being burnt anywhere just tasted amazing     If ever come back Rio again only place eat   definitely top pick food Casino   Especially if you're looking quick bite spend 2 hrs waiting major buffet line waiting restaurant reservation  <EOR> Came ordered aloo gobe split friend we dinner reservations but wanted snack Indian joints thing    ordered medium came hot sent back portion size came back $16 bucks    Really?
