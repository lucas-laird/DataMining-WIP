Best K Kaviar <EOR> Tonight chilly Vegas taste Chinese thinking war wonton soup orange chicken fried rice   driving home Mountains Edge Area noticed Panda sign which  led starving puppy into Albertsons shopping center   drive through little hidden once line packed I 9th 10th car que armed patience fact Friday no other plans but home chill fine!   Unfortunately did any soup offerings so    opted try 8 treasure chicken which flavourful little kick orange chicken which also very flavourful tangy sweet just right amount sauce nice crunch fried rice which milder flavour balance meal   young girl drive through window very pleasant well spoken friendly warm smile   Tonight's  Panda experience overall very pleasant! <EOR> Waited 12 freaking Minutes drive thru time ordered kids meal version terriyaki chicken  If wasnt child limited certain foods because allergies wouldve just drove away without getting anything even though paid  anyone business see anyway  star because cant choose zero <EOR> As parent just can't find much nutrition menu plus never meal like   being said   sons love place   Thick sweet syrup most entrees meals probably why  When beg eat elsewhere let them indulge <EOR> Rangoons cold rice dry old noodles   Worst all service very slow  <EOR> Felt 5 star restaurant Las Vegas Strip!  Awesome service staff especially Tasha! <EOR> I recently through drive thru Blue Diamond Panda Express location  When home opened food which supposed string bean chicken brown rice found absolutely repulsive  Old mushy rice  Wilted slimy green beans  Stuff wasn't even supposed dish mushrooms zucchini  absolutely ZERO chicken  obviously serve drive thru customers old disgusting garbage walk restaurant customers would never accept palatable digestible  food   reason why leaving review because first time happened location  Obviously practice serve questionable food drive thru customers most likely order reduce food waste keep costs down  When called spoke manager Summer apologize but offered no solution whatsoever  Perhaps General Manager location should  rethink he she decides leave charge should serioisly think re staffing restaurant because obviously staffed individuals think ok serve type trash customers  going happen somebody going end getting sick business going end being sued negligence  All all drove 4 miles paid over $6 bowl full hot garbage would ashamed serve dog  only reason why Panda Express location getting star review because no negative star option Yelp  think choose spend hard earned money Teriyaki Madness just opened nearby  would set foot Panda Express again if free  <EOR> Went Albertsons work last night decided stop grab some dinner  3 entree combo  Honey Walnut Shrimp Beijing Beef Orange Chicken  Comes your choice fried rice chow mein which any chow mein ever seen before  always experienced saucy vege mix dry crunchy noodles  closer lo mein  Wasn't bad though  Shrimp good beef chicken meh  fast food Chinese $10 bad  Would prefer real Chinese restaurant but those don't seem exist Las Vegas  <EOR> This location absolute best customer service! least once week know staff personable friendly! greet when walk overall great group staff members! <EOR> Love location because employees know fill plate sure pay  no skimpy portions here! food typical Panda fare but usually pretty fresh cook all day long  employees friendly there's drive thru which super nice  bathrooms dining room clean  No complaints  <EOR> Yet another terrible experience Panda    Lately husband coming quite often dinner food delicious quality quanity fair price!
