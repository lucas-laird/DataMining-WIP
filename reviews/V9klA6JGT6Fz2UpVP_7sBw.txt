Very disappointed!! worth money    Didn't bother buffet line twice  <EOR> Came Saturday brunch  food very good selection appealing me  clams butter still sand them   I guess place bad if you're only eating crab legs prime rib  However crab legs really small prime rib  okay  took last piece did really bring back until 30 min hour later   Service slow   Overall waste money  am glad Tix4Tonight good deal place  <EOR> Dinner Buffet As far buffets great very veggie friendly  am giving 5 stars simply because large selection fresh fruits vegetables  loaded plate fresh veggies which topped Mexican section sides mini taco salad sin carne broccolini etc  chocolate cake also delish  Overall really glad see veggie options  curry sushi great but chinese rice lo mein worth calories  didnt even try your own pasta your own mongolian grill stations  would definitely back here  <EOR> Paid $51 2 adult dinners sorry say lived its 2 star rating  want say food average but quite number things almost inedible  didn't help didn't great variety either  Drinks self serve  Halfway through meal refill 100% orange juice out came machine water hint orange flavor  EW!  The decor could better  felt hybrid between grandma's place cafeteria kitchen   I ended only two plates including dessert entire duration  Stay away melons! whatever reason sizzled tongues soaked some kind sparkling water except no taste  swear plate sushi during first round time around seconds plate gone much replenished  things good bland but least able keep stomach growling    Service friendly though but couldn't figure why made wait line seated when empty tables everywhere    <EOR> It looks buffet cheaper ones off strip  made just time breakfast cheaper prices $13  Yeah cheese omelet  Yum! food decent best ever but edible  Staff really nice here  Liked clouds ceiling pretty  <EOR> It's awhile since eaten Monte Carlo's buffet  smaller side there's less options  However staff really efficient quick ask if need refills really friendly    3 stars because sometimes food just sitting long  know when gets kind cold just sad looking? happens food doesn't touched    The food rotated regularly replaced pretty good  would back only if beginning brunch dinner  don't think want return middle  <EOR> I buffet comp  Free food! Place clean  Staff friendly     I dined $24 99 dinner buffet   There self serve drink station juices sodas cofees milk! no real server but busser  circles around unwanted plates    Food selection decent  Nothing stood out  Few items dry prime rib  enjoyed shrimp pasta bar icecream  wouldn't come back  experience horrible but price isn't worth quality food   Food=3 Service=5 <EOR> No  Did like  $56 2 dinner much selection  Crab legs decent but husband's Prime Rib disgusting!!! Save your $ Planet Hollywood  employees nicer too! <EOR> Not really into buffets but Vegas fam couldn't agree anything buffet was  More reasonably priced most buffets $24 dinner weekend fairly good selection food  Almost everything tasted good enough  didn't eat anything unusual if stick basic things chicken salmon salads pastas all good  pretty healthy eater liked good variety vegetable protein dishes  Dessert pretty good too  Nothing amazing but satisfied sweet tooth  sticky almond cake liked lot  Service good too  quick bring extra utensils give refills clear dirty dishes  bad  <EOR> We ate because heard while standing line TixForTonight  offer discounted eateries gave Monte Carlo's buffet try    For two people only paid $23  came during brunch enjoyed breakfast selections  middle changing food lunch enjoy lunch well! food okay quality  only thing stood Italian Sausage soup salad ravioli mashed potatoes gravy  corn beef hash but okay  prime rib dry  didn't even taste dessert section because looked unappetizing    Great service though! your own beverage coffee soda water etc  <EOR> Pretty inexpensive buffet quality food definitely reflected price  Selection wasn't bad but dishes chose all below average  Mac n cheese which personally think hard mess beef taco garden salad some egg rolls  egg rolls probably best thing tried but still didn't redeem meal whole  <EOR> I rule just buffet each time visit Vegas   rule overturned recent trip   Here headed Wynn when friend called ask meet some other folks Monte Carlo buffet   She said she picked because close where staying   next New York New York   some hesitation opted   to more social   Doh!  Okay company cool   But honestly surprised mediocre buffet was!  At $20 dinner you'd wiser elsewhere   Sure there's prime rib but only okay overall selection items quite limited   No crab legs shrimp cocktail   There's taco bar some prepared Asian food none which touched   lot stuff looked greasy oily   desserts weren't interesting mostly cakes cookies puff pastry type things   There's soft serve ice cream but doesn't begin salvage meal  <EOR> For price turned decent place   pleasantly surprised   ate Friday night believe cost $29 person   Weekdays only $25 person but sure if weekends more choices if just higher weekend price   Regardless vibe pretty much little bit more cafeteria    necessarily complaint since less expensive Strip buffets   your own soft drinks drink station there's no sitting around empty glass   did soda water option   Fill your glass squeeze lemon quite refreshing   Especially when come 109 degrees outside!  buffet area didn't look very large   However when started going through choices realized actually pretty extensive   much atmosphere items identified via grease pencil description written glass just focus food itself   say food?  Man really hard full buffet   Well let just say everything tried well prepared   wasn't dry sitting looking   Flavor decent   enjoyed food   didn't leave raving but did leave satisfied   fairly affordable buffet Strip  all needed  <EOR> The reviews see here   interesting   first visit The Buffet Monte Carlo Casino   came group 8 actually left pretty pleased   did arrive bit late 1 30pm Saturday lunch most tables empty   price?  $21 99 adults which wasn't bad all   First off  if buffet place anywhere want big bang your buck   see people reviewing shrimp much batter pizza   uh   yeah   primo items shrimp crab prime rib   If don't want might well specific restaurants cater want   If wanted pizza  I'd Sbarro's little food area Monte Carlo $6 eat $22 buffet     Anyways protein loaded and cholesterol level probably hates two things trip crab legs prime rib   Sure plenty other options they even offer made to order omelette bar but   love some crab   Lol   also some peel eat shrimp but felt lazy   2 hours buffet discussed buffet overall impressed options   They everything breakfast selections french toast sausage eggs bacon hash browns premade sandwiches roasted selections prime rib ham   also taco station asian section that didn't really eat but did see them course  the dessert table   The desserts actually pretty good some even coming own little edible chocolate containers   variety mousses something everyone even soft serve ice cream doesn't?    Overall pretty decent buffet brunch price wasn't very expensive   ended staying start dinner could probably eaten more   but full   service par plates picked regularly very important any buffet scenario    Would come back?  Definitely!    PS  the others group didn't crab load or did just much 3 4 plates had perfectly happy food selection   Even picky 8 10 year old nephews pleased everything there  <EOR> Underrated!

<EOR> We received couple free buffets registration Monte Carlo didn't want waste it  plus fresh crab legs something can't pass up   But no shell crackers no shrimp forks anything else use break into shells   server said hotel won't buy more because keep walking off   Well some cheap plastic openers Joe's customers least eat crab  Rest food passable but don't try guess salad dressing use  they don't bother label them you'll probably wrong one  Server bit angry overheard complaining other staff while she slammed dirty plates utensils when she picked them into bussing cart  Been done that   not again  <EOR> Let's face buffet competition strip fierce   Monte Carlo's Buffet isn't stand but serves purpose     Visiting Friday morning lunch turn over begin one favorite times visit buffet no line right in   Beverages self serve there's no need server ask want drink   personally because other buffets don't ask want drink until return food need something wash down eating few bites   Anyway breakfast pretty standard far selection taste although didn't see any French Toast fav   may late since 10 30am arrived but still    did indulge those mini boxes Fruit Loops   guilty pleasure sure     Breakfast pretty much filled didn't try many lunch items   table cleared pretty quickly plates set edge which always nice     In end place truly A OK  <EOR> Probably worst buffet eaten Vegas  Lots options but none them very appealing  Desserts looked nicer tasted I think best things key lime tartlets strawberry shortcake everything else tried wasn't worth calories   Saving grace crab legs weekends only?
