I usually come location cause nearest subway area  never any issue ever til awhile ago arrive around 2309hrs ordered two footlongs teriyaki new sandwich turkey avocado  Teriyaki perfect always but turkey missing avocado most important thing sandwich AVOCADO without incomplete dissapointed  didn't wanna come back beside already home didn't wanna another trip just decided call them multiple times let them know messed order but no answer  Hopefully next time better job! <EOR> Came wrong night apparently   Charged full price $6 footlong didn't realize until drove away    <EOR> Emily shift manager wasn't very helpful  saw use restroom then sandwich without washing hands  would highly recommend Subway boulder Russell  if look closely behind electric box  bums doing drugs  Which really worries would probably recommend eating Popeyes connected same building  <EOR> Just came ordered 3 subs chicken bacon ranch   sub no ranch chicken teriyaki witch nice long hair it   tuna sub well tuna sub   better employees before don't know happened <EOR> Employees very fast friendly place nice clean well  definitely return! Location busy corner  <EOR> Honestly place subway lets real reviews people  its anything but sandwhich everytime gone person making sandwhich asks if looks okay before wrap it  Poor kids work being open 24 hours neighborhood hard enough imagine many people messed begging food  thoughtful theyre probably having great day  never problem everyone made sandwhoch very nice whenever give them kindness return it  give everyone works props! <EOR> I've quite few times month Februany aka $5 footlongs anything except premium subs  Since closest spot home think time review   The service consistently fast food just fine  also no problems redeeming survey code free cookie if don't know check back your receipt next time   Preparation seems pretty consistent except occasion where might skimped bit chipotle mayo  kinda small but aren't all? Only things stopping being 5 star fast food chain restaurant white guy haven't caught name constantly tries upsell  He asks if want more cheese whatnot gets annoying   Note self keep getting sub toasted because seems $5 41 both toasted untoasted  <EOR> So here's deal    Subway subway  leave reviews chain restaurants mostly based location service    The sandwich chicken breast expect $5    The guys working back friendly fast  Very personable    There some homeless folks right outside shopping center pretty often always subway but vicinity  give them few bucks every once awhile   if gonna honest its annoying see same three four able bodied men week week  wish someone would kick them out  <EOR> Great experience! last week girls where really friendly! lunch break first time location! mention great service was! <EOR>
