What great find food great especially steaks would expect  wine cocktail list very unique coming iPad browse first well me  Decor service excellent would totally recommend restaurant <EOR> The only reason place merits star because tasty cocktail other deserves big fat ZERO   warned long review!  But don't remember last time received such awful service   stopped happy hour Monday night around 9 30pm   six sat lounge area waited waited waited some more no waiter sight   hostess asked if someone going wait if order bar   hostess very nice someone come 5 min later   waiter came no introduction asked if ready order hadn't even offered menu! could ready??  menu ordered drinks which only good thing during time restaurant   something called BBO spicy blood orange jalapeño infused martini very yummy   waiter came back took food order mine first he clearly wrote down saw him   food came everyone's food but mine   never chance ask food because couldn't find waiter anywhere!  No ever came back check didn't ask food never offered refills water nothing   Finally someone came around not waiter never saw again pick plates asked check   soon he came back asked sure crab cakes bill because never came out   He didn't say word just opened check back manager he could take he crab cakes off   Never apologized didn't say anything crab cakes coming out   manager came 5 feet away thought sure he would come apologize forgotten food   but he didn't   guy came back put he check back table again no acknowledgement food never came out!  all irritated overall service lack should say asked speak manager   sister talked he made some lame excuse being over busy under staffed  Really?? Monday night?  don't think trust busy all   Plus  no excuse   only good thing manager did offer pay bill  never back place shouldn't especially Monday nigh!   Oh did forget mention appetizers tiny need magnifying glass find them plate   Well could tell everyone else's plate course! <EOR> The address listed wrong couldn't check when because kept telling far even though sitting inside restaurant  But food awesome    Everything prepared perfectly  meat very tender juicy   definitely worth it! <EOR> We staying Aria decided roam around Crystals looking good restaurant  man of course being sweet guy he is! let choose place  Well  we ended Beso  Partly because pretty fireside hearth attracted exterior entrance partly because knew Eva Longoria's restaurant lastly because just plain hungry seemed best option time P   The decor pretty food good but great especially price service just okay  Btw ended getting crispy calamari salmon steak entrees  can't remember exact names dishes   All all wasn't super impressed but glad tried place just may willing give another future trip  <EOR> Went vegas friend's birthday made reservations Beso night also happened Eva's birthday  service fantastic everyone attentive would thought  only ones but not   Thought weird weren't given menu but then Chad restaurant manager came over sat down suggesting sangria which amazing then told chef's selected tasting menu   Each course 5 served introduced executive chef Matt P also came over sit down chat periodically throughout evening  much amazing food couldn't finish all! 1st Eva's signature guacamole amazing served spicy habanero chips  2nd crab cake little bit caviar top which light simple crab highlighted hidden fillers   3rd rare ahi tuna lightly seasoned served over stone ground grits  4th split dish seared snapper served over cauliflower puree topped crispy potato strips paired braised shortrib which soaked overnight red wine then slow cooked 6 or 8 hours served over mashed potatoes topped maitake mushroom  Both fantastic! fish perfectly cooked nice crispy exterior short rib tender just fell apart when touched fork melted mouth  short break to allow all settle Matt brought best brownie ever despite claims brownies suck !!

Hands down great meal but service sucked  point server asked question while he walked by   but he never stopped walking!  It just didn't feel 4 5 star restaurant  <EOR> Bucking trend celebrity endorsed major investor co branding overhype gone wrong Beso legitimately affirm its culinary semi prowess nouveau latin arena =overpriced guacamole mixing truffles tacos   Damn  that statement wayy formal but very few semi upscale places bring hungover daytime sunstroke mixed poolside drinking crowd  gonna leave happy full!   Whether Eva Longoria ACTUALLY anything conception restaurant aesthetic design concept menu I'd say she probably workhorse *team* did great job setup without introducing any visible celebrity gaudiness! Keep mind experience much better large group dinner two  only reason why say average party size seems 6 unless you're sitting bar alone wallowing your gambling loss induced misery     A word caution vegetarians pickings few far between  place whether sells itself such pretty much 'alternative' steakhouse  Sure order nice pan roasted filet Salmon half chicken but you're better off opting rib eye filet  being lover decent steak ordered latter which did disappoint    Standouts *Beso Beso Salad  there's something really good champagne vinaigrette ordering twice! *Pea Soup  kid actually amazing without putting 'geriatric' state mind  little heavy side but really done justice! *Tortilla Soup  another winner  single thing wrong this! *Lobster Mac Cheese  decadence MAJOR calories small plate  Forget club you're going straight sleep one    *Wild Mushrooms  tell waiter easy salt perfect accompaniment your steak   Other fact side 'creative' rice beans or something else characteristically LATIN some different sauces should added menu perfectly fits bill trendy steakhouse  Trendy Vegas = younger clientele better looking women expansive drink offerings more upbeat music   If you're looking creative take Latin cuisine Mesa Grill in Caesar's place you  <EOR> This place great especially if happen area   sure I'd way eat here      The atmostphere fantastic   wait sit food bit long but if right company fine!  Great drink options bread sides!  Lamb mac n cheese enjoyed both   lamb chops small but perfect if you're starving! <EOR> I really enjoyed dinner Beso! 3 other people upon being seated asked if celebrating anything at end brought churros served vanilla ice cream YUM! Beso quite extensive wine list which selected delightful Californian Zinfandel   Appetizers tasty but disappointed extremely small portion guacamole ceviche  Beso version mozzarella caprese flavorful but friend didn't enjoy it  bread brought table fantastic I LOVE some carbs!! For dinner fish specials totally forget kind fish was remember thoroughly enjoying it  Someone ordered short ribs commented them being rather dry   All all thought meal very good  left feeling very full 3 courses which Vegas sometimes challenge  know sometimes pay buttload $ small meager portions? Aside guac ceviche early thought portion sizes fair  service attentive never felt rushed  very relaxing luxurious dinner  would definitely recommend Beso food also sexy atmosphere  <EOR> La carne era fantastica lo staff gentile bello ed educato  Atmosfera romantica  Quasi perfetto <EOR> My wife couple drinks Beso 40th Birthday    martinis very generous beautifully prepared    wife's Manhattans tasted way yummy dark crispy black cherries   You know coolest thing though?   Apparently Eva Longoria both same Birthday!   W00t! <EOR> I would've probably given place more star if didn't try trick because used TravelZoo deal  yet also dinging them more starts because waiter nice tried best deal's shortcomings   The restaurant itself gorgeous  Situated Crystals the new shopping center beside Aria Beso definitely prime spot  restaurant's interior very elegant intimate table setting very classy  Overall give place A+ its aesthetic appeal   As seated given glass champagne start part deal but took around 15 minutes before given menu choose from  waiter nice but bit disappointed learn first all no foie gras available  something waiting try  don't know if ran night just did offer because voucher  Additionally voucher indicated could order main course $54 under  When initially looked menu prior purchasing voucher Prime Rib fit price restriction  However when going over menu restaurant surprise disappointment restaurant updated its menu allowed prime rib even when offered pay difference  Last disappointment voucher dessert  looking forward having chocolate cake learned end meal actually didn't choice pick from  only option churros   However when did meal everything delicious  beef tartare chile rellenos begin  chili fine but beef tartare really good  main course filet mignon short rib  meat both tender short rib falling off bone  If come would recommend getting those two dishes  dessert waiter ended giving both churros chocolate cake because pushed it  However would pass both  churros stale dry chocolate cake dense sweet!  Overall company wait staff salvaged night  did end having great time even given two complimentary shots! ask Raspberry Beso Watermelon Vodka  A+ book! when come Beso voucher sure reset your expectations  if you've willing drop $$$ am most certain restaurant meet high expectations well  <EOR> We just wandered famished perusing strip found happy hour gem!   It very pretty inside you'll definitely feel beatiful people if your experience anything ours you'll treated too!  We sipped very tall white cosmos nibbled fresh guacamole stuffed fried peppers   Both appetizers delicious definitely worth happy hour price tag     The bartender cocktail girl extremely pleasant friendly made feel super welcome  Happy hour far made but would gladly return another late afternoon nosh  <EOR> Great Vibe!
