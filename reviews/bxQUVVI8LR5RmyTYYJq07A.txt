Lemon chicken spot on flavor perfectly crispy because poked holes box lid  Good attention detail!  Moo Shu pork decent but favorite dish served pancakes reminiscent tortillas  Healthy seeming dish lots cabbage mushrooms other veggies  Menu also offers steamed veggie protein options those seeking healthy choices   But won ton soup  Lord  $5 bowl huge 6 plump stuffed won tons but broth star! Perfectly savory probably packed MSG topped ton shredded green onion  Perfect when you're under weather   EDIT Subtracted star lack consistency  gone back wor won ton soup broth isn't good wontons soggy despite being allegedly fresh made   Lemon chicken always solid though barbeque pork egg foo young really well done  <EOR> I live down street Pearl Wok finally decided try them  Typically only Chinese take restaurants offer noodles rice lunch special  Because only comes very plain but good fried rice ordered side plain noodles $1 50  total lunch came almost $9  say also your choice soup unlike most places eggroll    The food really good  Even eggroll which don't normally eat    If don't care various offerings plate place must try good Chinese    would highly suggest Pearl Wok also include noodles lunch  If did would give them all business vs  normal place    Also don't big family dinners  family dinners individual plates  much lunch <EOR> This first time ordered  Delivery fast  However food salty  ordered shrimp egg foo young triple delight  egg foo young worst ever had  triple delight better but way salty  <EOR> Ive few times food pretty good  wanted delivery today but guy phone obviously own world  ask fried rice orange chicken which he replied soup  said no want orange chicken friend rice  He replied lunch special said im sure your special all want friend rice  He said fried rice rice comes chicken  hung up  Seriously?

Needless say all garbage sure won't back! <EOR> I used yelp online ordering meal delivered since working couldn't leave  Fastest delivery ever  10 minutes if that! impressed  food great  ordered crab wontons way more then ordered die for  even egg rolls white rice I didn't order only complaint chow mein  expecting tradition but dehydrated noodles topping seperatly  sure if ordered wrong item if typical but ordering regularly! <EOR> Fastest delivery ever! food terrific price hasn't change since started coming 2008  Mongolian beef ribs pork fried rice all appatizers favorites  also special spicy sauce need ask should  simply can't wrong! <EOR> I've ordered twice first time pretty good  last order received definitely old reheated  chicken gummy wontons soggy everything else warm  only live 5 minutes place arrived 10 minutes ordered know wasn't anything end  give lot food though free eggroll any entree any order over $30 throw free fried rice chow mein  first time let combination chow mein but second time said chow mein rice vegetable only  very consistent if ask me  <EOR> The food good fast probably again try something different chicken general tsao wonton soup both hot fresh  <EOR> First time ordering heard place nephew  two orders Shrimp Fried rice spicy mild which labeled convenience  two other entrees free everything done 5 minutes! Food great especially general tso's chicken! Also no other Chinese restaurant given free entree free egg roll each dish order!! <EOR> Just moved area say best highlights being close restaurant! Also mall street isn't bad either  place friendly even though most workers don't speak English but just love ma pa shops your food way remember too  lunch specials cheap filling always some leftover later  Mongolian beef orange chicken kung pao chicken crab rangoons more but they're probably top choices since extra spicy way it  delivery sometimes fast! Occasionally takes little longer usual but  understandable delivery guy traffic other delivery orders  If can't wait I'd suggest picking yourself eating faster  Also love free eggroll meal lot places give more food ordered  Overall great place recommend much try! <EOR> Ordered delivery arrived 10 mins earlier promised which awesome  Everything ordered bag piece cardboard bottom keep everything spilling  Ordered Crab Cheese Wontons Wonton soup Sesame Chicken Combo Lo Mein fried rice  Bonus egg rolls vegetable fried rice because spent over $25   Most importantly food tastes growing up! even send hard Lo Mein noodles eat your meal which haven't seen until now  only complaints combo Lo Mein suuuuuuper fishy wonton soup overly salty oniony personal preference issues haha   Also if order fried rice your entree simply fried rice egg no disgusting frozen peas carrots!
