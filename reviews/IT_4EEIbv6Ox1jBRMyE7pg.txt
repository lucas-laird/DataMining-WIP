Winner winner Del Frisco's dinner!! <EOR> I though steak house everywhere kinda same ! always decided atmosphere       But simply place's food taste good ! We big 30 oz bone rib eye     taste really good    And next day jus ate last nite left over steak      surprised still taste goood   Usually left over microwave steak good flesh   realized steak quality really good !    We also order 1 pound big Alaskan king crab      yesssssss could feel real taste crab     Usually think Costco big rib eye king crab reasonable taste good       But place can't comparable wit Costco ! Lol   Service professional everybody nice    Everybody working nice kind !!!   Thank u ! <EOR> I'm actually sure begin just going start beginning let decide     Four choice steakhouse because only Vegas 4 5 stars  other high end spots max 4  Personally always fan Jean Georges Aria but booked tonight pick new spot made command decision highest rated  Biggest mistake ever made   Things started off behind  showed ok time reservation 800 only stand lobby another 10 minutes while mustered enthusiasm seat empty tables  order crab cake king crab salads start  Crab cake good  King crab okay  But then real insanity began  first came scallops plate smothered thick sort teriyaki soy blend paste powerful recoiled upon taste  Unfortunately wasn't strong enough mask flavor scallop which clearly few days old frozen very thick meat fresh scallop if choose scallops pair them within sautéed mushroom   why because canned caps same dense flavorless texture taste   Then comes Double Eagle prime strip which asked thin line Pink but friend hubby all meats Lamb Filet Strip rare  filet strip sent back once again specific instructions them just line pink  ****to fair never send back steak why? Because inevitably cook gonna take personally if we're insulting taste buds dinner gonna come back burnt   Before plate hit table could tell over cooked  plate radiating heat around 800*Fahrenheit leaving nothing more lump low grade dog food  Which talk minute The manager asks what's wrong  point say nothing because no longer interested playing game  just want but insist pick something else won't charged  ask filet box pick dog food puppy least benefit night out  waiter tells don't worry box we'll take care its all done happens filet comes drop off steal back dog food leave remains only meat came all night anything near real piece meat  But honest now home would rather brought dog food home  least know he would enjoy it  Because none ate feels good stomach  feel genuinely robbed!!!  Mind you   we've ready leave last 10 15 min but can't leave because no stops table anymore see we're doing  Finally going find someone myself ambush lemon dessert cake check   ***thats right check which still other two pieces meat undercooked well untouched mushrooms  $300 when look back try remember ate   I honestly can't remember  Couple bites bland lettuce  Half filet  two bites many food sauces disgusting wouldn't serve volunteer shelter good conscience   Come think would rather done spa day then watched Mayweather fight again before stopping chipotle  least then nails would done   I NO idea achieved rating must give away free meals elite yelpers because dare say if just 10 regular yelpers dine give ratings your 2 3 star tops only because average customer feels bad writing negative review   Ps in spirit full disclosure manger did come intention making right  intentions good  she gets thanks  But rest upsetting when think anymore it  <EOR> My husband came past Friday night   read reviews thought try it   decor entertainment live piano player great but food so so   definitely better Ruth's Chris Joe's Seafood Prime Steak Stone Crab    steak cook right but major lack flavor   tasted plain piece meat   ordered potatoes au gratin those blan tasting too   sure everyone else raving about?!  Perhaps husband ate off night? sure  All know definitely won't coming again  <EOR> Travis Chris Tony made excellent food decor really sing harmony  flawless experience glasses never empty glances never ignored  <EOR> Just returned boys trip Vegas where Del Frisco's agenda always   12 private wine room which fantastic private room if looking such 6th straight year every visit staff food spot on   Steaks fish appetizers all expertly prepared     After disappointing experience usually very good Prime Bellagio night before just sure Del Frisco's recognized execution   I've also eaten restaurant proper several times never disappointed  <EOR> The service great but food very overpriced quality  bone in ribeye medium  very little charring outside more rare wanted  meat supposed prime grade but steak very little marbling bought better Costco  wife 14oz  lobster tail which dry meally  Very disappointing meal  Save your money try somewhere else <EOR> It fancy restaurant!   one friends texas promised take most fancy restaurant texas look online found also las vegas well!!

Hy's Honolulu used favorite then Mastro's Steakhouse but King steaks   never steak flavorful juicy outside all way down bone   Normally outside juicy then toward middle steaks become tough but case here   live California unfortunately other Del Frisco Grill restaurants Irvine Santa Monica Pasadena carry steak only Las Vegas   guess restaurant every time am Vegas   If large appetite love ribeye's should your bucket list steaks try   $89 pricey but worth every juicy flavorful bite  <EOR> Steak Haus abseits des las vegas Strip  Sehr groß auch ohne Reservierung einen Platz brkommen  High Class bisschen unterkühlte Atmosphäre bisserl snobby  Steak war ein Tomahawk Steak Medium rare  Bei der Anlieferung des Steak wird man aufgefordert das Steak mittig zu halbieren oder anzuschneiden um sicherzustellen dass es richtig gegrillt wurde  Das habe ich abgelehnt weil ich das schöne Stück nicht Eile zerstören wollte nur damit der Steak Anlieferer seine auswendig gelernten Tasks erfüllt    Er schaute mich zwar entsetzt aber verschwand dann schnell   Das Steak selbst war ok nicht überwältigend etwas viel fett den Rändern  Medium Rare wie bestellt allerdings innen etwas zu kalte Kerntemperatur  Ebenso die Beilage Creme Spinach schon kalt bei der Anlieferung   Preise sehr gehoben und alles allem für die genannten Punkte zu hoch  Aber solide Qualität  <EOR> Found awesome steakhouse thanks handy Yelp app!

Note manager call your provider immediately!!! serious health issue your restaurant wrote note tab asked speak manager said available i return recommend your restaurant  may even call health department  <EOR> I wouldn't say best steak eaten life   But overall experience would say better steakhouses to     I'm usually blow big bucks steakhouse when usually prepare very good steaks home especially quality beef mail order high end grocers nowadays   Instead usually spend high end dining dollars restaurants multiple course tasting menus would hard execute home   Also steakhouses usually charge extra sides sky high markups wine usually don't take or really expensive corkage   However husband does most actual steak cooking house anyway does eat steak occasionally nice change all other frou frou restaurants frequent   I gotta say though place actually *gasp* decent value money especially Vegas where easily spend $100 single steak   friend split specials bone in Wagyu Tomahawk ribeye wound costing $45 apiece   husbands standalone ribeye steaks own no bone definitely jealous ours just much juicier more tender   don't think ever any other steakhouse where Wagyu much   steak perfectly cooked medium rare course! no complaints whatsoever   The appetizers ordered tuna tartare crab cake tasty well executed though particularly exciting   But then old school type place wasn't exactly expecting cutting edge   sides also pretty decent   I'm big fan potatoes au gratin but dining companions enjoyed mushrooms flavorful but did overpower steak   didn't order dessert since already stuffed all steak even leftovers   The drinks good reasonably priced well   started off signature cocktail   a martini like concoction pineapple juice   very refreshing good start meal   also very expansive wine list they better since don't let bring outside wine many great selections California cabs wine choice good steak   very pleased note special section devoted lesser known producers also more affordable   Unlike many other steakhouses tend push customer towards higher priced wines I'm looking Alexander's Harbour Sixty server very happy talk some smaller wineries list   finally settled 2007 Terra Valentine cab Spring Mountain one less famous Napa valley appellations which perfectly all steaks     The service overall extremely good   they asked beginning if show catch could pace dinner accordingly called taxi take back perfect time even showed James Bond table    definitely best service seen steakhouse   One best values steakhouse best values overall city   would highly recommend place anyone craving steak Las Vegas  <EOR> My fiance dined day Turkey Day   Del Frisco's short cab ride off strip   notice older crowd dines which nice change hoochie mommas walking strip   seated dining rooms lucky enough man flat screen showing game   cocktail while looking over menu ordered signature drink The VIP  pineapple martini where soak fruit days vodka all its juices   faboosh!    After taking some time menu fiance decided split wedge salad bone filet   sides lobster mac n' cheese along grilled asparagus   brought steak little bloody kindly took back cooked more   Once done served beef side now time chow down   whole meal great   No complaints me   staff more helpful cocktail lil tipsy meat put food coma   just wish devouring meal room dessert   always next time  <EOR> What started good dining experience ended great dining experience  Vegas poker tournament decided treat ourselves nice dinner  place great reviews wanted give try  waiter nice enough but seemed start getting impatient when asked questions menu  However manager made very friendly open personable demeanor  bit weirded why swanky establishment would allow patron bring dog leash service dog but whatever  staff members walked said Well 'dog' orders expensive wine  Yeah sure he does  did drop jaw floor when patron ordered ice water dog  Anyway digress anecdote  steak good but Del's Uptown potato world! glad able substitute $59 menu even though waiter seemed put asked if could because really made difference  Mmmm mmmm!  Now onto reason great dining experience  leaving needed stop into ladies room  heard music being played but thought music being piped satellite radio  However when back boyfriend pointed piano player lounge  ended staying additional hour half just listen Tyrone bar! fun evening! He played requests us  He chatted us  laughed sang  Wow! did hear once remodel July he no longer around that  if you're area see before he's gone! He's best!  So again food pretty good potato even better   Service good but made manager   Entertainment world! Overall dining experience Yay! fan  <EOR> If first balla steakhouse ever would impressed   The table ready brief minute   All staff friendly helpful   guy pointed restroom which somewhat hard find guy itself cool waiter put very well complete nonsense resident smart ass group even though he wearing baseball hat dressy restaurant   Overall ambience great if old school style steakhouses stuff would expect Chicago New York mafia type places    restaurant sectioned off into different rooms place does loud a real problem Flemings Newport Beach Manhattan Beach    Wine selection   spend much want here   could spend GDP small country   would say glass selection smallish impressive bargain end menu   am sure could find good bottle two if know your wines but am good   impression overpriced quality wine    Food   Ribeye steaks would expect good restaurant   However if LA think your steak overdone respect ordered it   mine medium rare but bit closer medium   still pretty decent Foie gras infused sauce   sides acceptable but impressive   mac cheese seemed bit al dente broccoli a bit over steamed sauteed mushrooms good but could actually replicate very easily home    didn't dessert because mostly dudes   Since website won't tell pricing give idea I memory since hosted dinner   Thanks host! Ribeye 16 oz  $40 Ribeye bone 22 oz $50 Carpetbagger Ribeye 10oz $30 Wine pinot Argentina? forgot name    Madderas? $90 bottle Penfold's Cab don't ask vintage! $10 glass Silver Oak Alexander Valley 98 think $40 glass Most wines glass $15 Wedge salad $10 Most appetizers other market price stuff $10 $15  Anyway really depends looking your expectations are   If New York top steakhouses hate place knock over table   But if LA might feel right home   I am LA but appreciate old school steakhouses New York Chicago roll   Jack Rose New York Smith Wollensky's Chicago   definitely shy giving slightly seared hunk prime beef   kind style   Besides raw beef horse liver fish eggs really no big deal me   A few other notes   pretty good groups we 8 nice large table could all sit instead pushing tables together    restaurant pretty much cleared around 10 30pm we 9pm reservations place pretty busy when first    If want quieter evening very late dinner   paitent if cabbing over here   took bit cabs arrive even though told them few minutes before left   Just stogie whatever hopefully isn't middle winter summer aren't freezing boiling  <EOR> Had feel tired old steakhouse even though anticipating visit Del Frisco's many visits LV past finally while visiting during last year's LVI tournament   Perhaps expecting much placing DF's pedestal once found chain already placed same class Ruth's Chris Morton's   No knocking any places but already wondered if going any good without being held under higher scrutiny would if located within large hotel strip i e  would more answer to      For such highly rated steakhouse expecting something fantastic but everything felt mediocre flat food service everything no extenuating wow factors could remember   remember feeling bit hovered over small army servers seemed everyone wait staff maitre d'hotel interested well meal going part script   When brought food did force 3 4 people likewise case when cleared table   reminded scene Back Future where all gas station attendants rushed help car pulled full service line   don't want sound didn't appreciate attention but bit overwhelming even patronizing actually   reviewer mentioned service obsequious understand where coming from     The food ok but  all   nothing wrong but all felt little ordinary particularly presentation   When ordered pair tomahawks  couple hunks meat plate each http

same everyone more following protocol actually having personal stake no pun intended asking     Actually don't recall if asked wife if she liked dish Beef Medallions chateau potatoes red wine demi

cheaper wine glasses silverware tables   seated right next bar which pretty loud night drew on   due no smoking ban Nevada now no more cigar room back   Totally restaurant's fault just bit dissapointing   little things fine dining establishment matter   If am paying $50 steak only should service food impeccable but should atmosphere   restaurant still good however all other well known

We finally seated friend each ordered Prime Strip which 16 ounces 1 lb  delicious aged beef   first served some great bread butter   also Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which really nice big filling   Along steak ordered sides sauteed mushrooms asparagus almonds   Both really delicious but couldn't eat very much because getting really full steak which intent finishing   main goal since didn't want waste besides fact tasted darn good tender right amount seasoning cooked perfection scrumptious!!  asked server prepared she told now hopefully replicate home sometime   It'll probably won't same however because never when try home   I enjoyed dinner immensely definitely come back again when Vegas when want  steak because right here   nice decor dark woods making ambiance really comfortable inviting   If you're looking good steak house highly recommend coming Del Frisco's because won't disappointed food service  <EOR> I personally think best steak house Vegas   prime strip steak man can't wrong cut   group all shared lobster mac n cheese onion rings mashed potatoes     If you're ever Vegas want eat nice mouth watering steak look no further book your reservation Del Frisco's     FYI restaurant off strip but far  <EOR> This steakhouse provides very nice ambiance welcoming unpretentious which always case other high end steakhouses Vegas    We sat bar while waited table since early reservation  Both house cocktail margarita tasty   To start tried crab cake everyone spoke recommended it   delicious  bake cakes instead frying them made cake nice light  sauce plate delicious  very big each order only comes cake kind bummer when sharing someone else   I filet special which consisted 8oz filet mignon spilt prepared two different styles  first crab meat asparagus hollandaise sauce top  second scallop wrapped shrimp top  Both absolutely delicious  When bring steak ask slice through middle sure prepared your satisfaction    For sides both sauteed mushrooms potatoes au gratin  au gratin great mushrooms just okay   In terms service server really nice provided great recommendations but few stretches when didn't see her  defense however she did large party sure kept occupied   This place more casual Yelp lets on  would say long wear nice blouse shirt nice shoes fine  more business casual anything else   I would definitely recommend restaurant anyone looking excellent meal am looking forward next visit  <EOR> My absolute favorite steak anywhere! wife isn't meat fan still raves bone in ribeye  Nice atmosphere very old school steakhouse environment  only complaint just common days no place old school waiters treat jobs profession really is  When waiter skilled respectable pro   your meal shines! <EOR> I Vegas once month hate give away spots only locals know          You see tourists love Delmonico's which masks its semi flavorful steaks potpourri spices   Tourists love N9NE which would NEVER ever ever visit again  N9NE overcooked steaks refused replace them   ever heard anything that???  neither   Finally tourists love whatever steakhouse magazine hotel room tells them love    If want real Las Vegas steakhouse don't want Morton's Ruth's Chris may recommend Del Frisco's   Located couple blocks off Strip hidden glamor grandeur touristy Las Vegas   Cab ride Del Frisco's say New York New York won't set back more $7 8   We reservations 9 pm it Final Four weekend wanted finish watching game    games ended early arrived 8 45 pm   seated very quickly quickly hardly chance grab some jelly beans some golf tees two giant bowls entrance   Remember jelly beans edible but golf tees NOT   You've warned   The steak great here   ordered Double Eagle New York Strip 26 oz cut bone   arrived quickly big juicy promised   meat just right amount marbling prepared properly   waiter then encouraged friend cut steaks sure prepared liking   listening Mr  CEO Morton's?

The seminar started off well least 50+ people all over Las Vegas workers private public institutions   But minds pretty sure everyone quietly chanting themselves meat meat   go meat meat    know wasn't completely focused 'cloud computing' 'server virtualization'!  After hour presentation lunch started arriving   started off basket fresh bread nice warm oven   Good stuff tell you!  started off Del Frisco house salad fresh lettuce cucumbers tomatoes fresh croutons two large slices smoked bacon   topped avocado ranch dressing   Great salad!  But definitely definitely health conscious side!  salad fresh large house cut croutons very nice touch   creaminess avocado ranch cut through saltiness bacon quite nicely   little fresh ground black pepper top salad excellent   While seminar continued background next course came out   choice 8 oz  filet mignon 12 oz  ribeye salmon   Needless say when steak house meatatarians do!  Salmon out   Medium rare ribeye in!  However when lil' slab flesh something amiss   noticed right away just look steak cooked correctly   Cut into it   damn!  near well done!  WTH?  immediately call over waiter tell ordered medium rare ribeye   He apologized profusely said he'll fix right away   wait extra 15 minutes ribeye but worth it   Waiter came back new steak apologized again said mistake kitchen previous order wrong table   Wow orders expensive cut meat well done?  shame tell you!    That steak buttah!  Well actually broiling topped pat butter well nicely melting top ribeye   tender!  juicy!  Seasoned just right salt pepper   No steak sauce needed when quality meat great!  ribeye also came accompanied some Del Frisco's chateau potatoes similar garlic mashed potatoes good well   Very creamy silky could tell potatoes lot butter them   took few bites but concentrated using all allowed calories day lovely ribeye   Done!  ribeye PWND!  Near end seminar dessert came out   treated large serving bread pudding   treated large serving GUILT   Calorie consumption day easily exceeded 2500 mark   But looked good!  would Tony Horton friends P90X say?  don't really recall but spoon!  bread pudding pretty good very sweet indulgent rum laced light caramel sauce   boy could taste butter!  four bites finally put spoon down   Whew!
