The steep prices given food court style place only downside but trust you'll happy paid $17 your roll!  Would recommend 1  Connecticut lobster roll the only warm sandwich menu which stuffed generous serving delicious lobster soft buttery bun    2  Lobster mac cheese   3  Cajun fries <EOR> Fast food lobster   only America   When saw also realized would staying Venetian recent trip Vegas knew try it   So random hidden away food court   almost hidden  while supposed fast food prices said Vegas $32 lunch 2! without alcohol!

I lobster mac cheese  wasn't bad  But quite spicy peppery    Mac cheese normally supposed mellow cheesy flavor but all could taste hot pepper  only small amount lobster all chopped ground up  mention served flimsy cardboard bowl plastic fork you'd carnival   Yeah lobster tastes good all But consider place ripoff  need cut prices half order fair value  <EOR> So  after many months same menu FINALLY bring back tacos !! Had trio  libster shrimp fish tacos  As see  put together sloppily served hot  Taste wise  VERY GOOD ! Really busy today  more counter help needed especially during busy times  Prices really high considering amount product actually given  <EOR> I cajun lobster roll recommended cashier good  Plenty lobster!!! even better lobster rolls fancy seafood restaurants  18 dollars lobster roll + cole slaw + chips steal  especially Las Vegas where expect everything overpriced!! never paid under $16 lobster roll anywhere!  The next day ate Bacchanal buffet Caesar's    But going lie would rather just bought two lobster rolls instead! would return again again again         <EOR> First time good people being very nice helpful  rolls stuffed! also some interesting drinks  Would come again  Cajun !! <EOR> Very good but very pricey   Heaps delicious lobster meat but 4in roll $17   it would more justifiable if 6in  Chowder fries awesome lobster Mac cheese okay   not worth it  Yes would visit again  <EOR> $15 lobsicle tasted burnt maybe dirty grill ? butter real?

As sides potato chips coleslaw          the chips pass on  sure if freshly cut fried but definitely light tasting all         kinda soggy if anything  coleslaw serving ridiculously small        it just pinch coleslaw size nut           but course sides  lobster roll!  Drinks kind expensive side           $8 bucks blueberry lemonade? I'd rather drink beer! Lol!  Overall neat little shop           the lobster roll I'd give very strong 4 but knock off point puny portions served here   For $71 35 3 lobster roll sandwiches 2 drinks       worth it? sure        <EOR> Wayy overprice portion get!
