The service Bombay really top notch generally find Indian restaurants reliable warm welcome swift attention  Bombay exceeded expectations   We first visited because holy moly Indian dinner buffet? Really? Game changer!  Alas first glimpse dinner buffet almost sent back door  Tomato soup? Yellow curry? trying court tourist might more comfortable idea buffet Indian ? When peeked under dishes almost everything covered nothing looked very good much see other Indian buffets   But parking dream something keeps away former fave Tamba fun going somewhere new own catnip  Plus Indian restaurants always clean cold water nowhere else  Bombay no exception  asked filtering secret but waiters just smile turn away    girls Don McLean song  We settled into big booth peered decor  Hmm former Chinese restaurant? Seriously does anyone know? kept staring photo mash Las Vegas Strip India suggested if exit Venetian just right you'll step into Taj Mahal   We started samosas  samosas want fragrance slight crispiness much dough spicy filling  Bombay satisfied texture taste plus two fresh tasting chutneys mint tamarind although could've done bit more fragrance  I say everyone except Kamal Palace Long Beach  ruined me! On second visit also paneer pakora  Fine dry fun try once   The list vegetarian dishes commendable but didn't see favourite shahi paneer  lurve shahi paneer much thinking name change  Hey would only consonant might help people finally pronounce name right  Indian foodies West seem tend toward healthly eating know uncouth admit but just adore adore adore creamy sauce  Shahi paneer aka royal paneer aptly named category   It's fair dock restaurant because don't carry dish  Then I'd no better those little kids only eat chicken nuggets  But almost every other Indian place town that like shahi paneer including little place Riviera food court wasn't boding well repeat visits  new things but also like   As long making confessions only really happy Indian main course if paneer it  know know  terrible admitting love shahi makhani sauces  Don't misunderstand squeal over aloo pakora kofta sure but paneer    cheese    bar set  Someone open Wisconsin Indian fusion restaurant complete   Paneer dishes Bombay include palak paneer alas only Indian food dislike right hate cooked spinach worst poster child vegetarianism ever know mutter paneer nice but bland overbearing amount peas paneer tikka masala  last option    The paneer tikka masala solid fare naan plain garlic rice although wording menu bit unclear over what's included  each visit ended paying separately both naan rice despite words Served hot eat bread rice above list dishes which would imply included  followed somewhat contradictory Add $2 00 entrees combo served Naan half rice order  asked but admit sure server said other sounded wasn't available  Hrm   Overall comes back word solid  transportive nor breathtaking but also iffy  meh  Prices run little high compared other area Indian restaurants Gaylord Origin excepted but right mark if reasonable Strip location  answer own question think haven't gone back just because other places where exactly want  But closures Kohinoor Saffron Flavors India not confused Eastside place Bombay solid 3 5 gets bumped four stars    Or 2 star buffet 3 5 star taste 4 star menu variety ambience 5 star service location parking  <EOR> So good Chicken Teaka masala amazing bit expensive if night but portions big enough share taste friendliness 10 10 <EOR> Truly most awful meals ever had  If fed buffet prisoners ACLU would start holding candlelight vigils writing letters president    Overlooked chana dal greasy frozen samosas palak paneer made Eisenhower era spinach rice was   well guess can't fuck rice badly  <EOR> Been looking good Indian restaurant around town decided give Bombay try  weekday during lunch asked menu but told only buffet available  didn't really want buffet first but since already figured why not  also noticed only non Indian person restaurant everyone having buffet enjoying themselves   The buffet fairly small consisted 8 entree items 2 different kinds rice minimal salad bar 2 kinds dessert  familiar Indian food am sure everything called although most signs above it nor did try everything  Some items looked little old like sitting warming tray while but items tasted warm tasted fine  worth noting tandoori chicken chili chicken pretty tasty  little disappointed did chicken curry which usually order  waiter friendly came pick plates each time back buffet also refilled water when ran low  He also brought basket naan during meal warm tasted fresh   The restaurant itself decorated nicely although felt bit warm stuffy while eating  Perhaps  need turn a c?

Expensive!! Expensive!!!!   Samosa rather bland  Paneer tikka masala butter chicken chicken Karahi okay  Among them liked Karahi most balanced flavor nicely  Daal makhani bland unimpressive!  Service HORRIBLE!! Took literally hour serve! waiter extremely rude  price $123 unimpressive food bad service! <EOR> I must say service excellent late lunch only other couple place    food tasty except no samosa buffet little pricey lunch    naan light  flaky plus mango lassi few $ more  Minus couple stars due cost granted all u can eat buffet    Parking easy right front but located back small strip mall    Easy miss if did see sign las vegas blvd   <EOR> Yes dinner buffet but even Indian buffet devotee bit pricey snuff visually  Everything same shade brown overall impression food decent amount time  Plus few vegetarian options  which generally favorite! Thus decided order off menu which rare occurrence when step into Indian establishment   The most impressive thing Bombay server  He impeccable  He worked another restaurant town brief period time he remembered name husband's occupation  He incredibly kind attentive  He recommended mixed vegetable curry paneer tikka masala  $2 extra combo rice naan which brings each entree around $14    When naan first arrived clear served reheat  soon said something server whisked away soon returned hot oven fresh naan  new naan good  entrees tikka masala definitely stand out  would order again  However mixed vegetable curry reminded Haldiram boxed meal  meals aren't bad but when eat expect bit more  Some vegetables canned curry flavor didn't seem unique    On interesting side note if you're looking big black leather booths seems common Vegas request them here  course fluorescent lighting Indian fare probably aren't really vintage Vegas    On Strip craving Indian? job done  <EOR> Great food great service   felt traveled Holy Land   Thank Bombay  <EOR> Where start? Bombay Indian Cuisine definitely Bomb  atmosphere comfortable quiet  waitress sweetheart because only eaten Indian Cuisine once before wasn't sure order but she patient helped through menu  ordered Shrimp Curry which amazing! spicy ordered level 5 which perfect  ordered rice which much better Asian rice perfect shrimp curry  also garlic butter naan dipped Curry sauce if all blended well  Highly recommend place visiting again before head back Alaska! <EOR> The rich red walls comfortable leather booths colorful artwork cozy place eat  friend around 5 30 empty  Usually good sign would turned around if plus did living social coupon    The wait staff quick welcome sat quiet corner booth  restaurant picked 6 but noise level minimal  busser came refill drinks cleared table dirty dishes promptly   The dinner buffet lacking $17  minimal choices some dishes room temperature  tandoori chicken nice flavor but dry  chicken curry flavorful meat moist  cauliflower curry sauce favorite dishes but wasn't anything else stood out  total 10 dishes line no problems trying everything  better Indian restaurants Las Vegas  <EOR> Worst service      dont enough people serve      And buffet very bad      <EOR> An average Indian restaurant located shady marketplace strip  ordered matar paneer n bhindi  okra completely dry n rubbery which made hard eat  breads just ok  <EOR> Oh goodness never eaten two restaurants same day before but did today!  evening meal Bombay Indian Cuisine which sits plaza shadow Encore very close wedding chapel two    Immediately upon entering restaurant hit lovely aroma deliciousness fabulous  6 pm Saturday only two other occupied tables   The space nothing special no carpeting no atmospheric lighting  two dining areas look exactly same hard black wooden chairs not most comfortable but serviceable bench seating wall side  bench seats topped high shiny black tufted backs   liked lighting used over tables except until meal served fixture blinking almost seizure inducing regularity  glad stopped would able eat table   The food deeeeelicious   started chicken pakora which actually wasn't anything special far seasonings but sufficiently enjoyable     I rice naan accompany entree lamb tikka masala  don't know why  chose lamb just didn't want chicken paneer   entree very attractive deep orange bright red color both rich satisfying photo uploaded   could done without meat altogether just sopped sauce naan good   I must say surprised gave burnt naan  ALL burned would sent back but only top layer pieces came way  didn't mind some crispy crackery but preferred warm soft pieces underneath and fan charred bread! The Bombay masala tea didn't taste very Bombay masala but refreshing  could Nestea Lipton all know  hot day would really enjoyed but restaurant cold enough kept jacket whole time   The service great servers very polite unobtrusive made sure well attended throughout visit   didn't give hard time when presented restaurant com coupon which appreciated     I'd no problem coming back here! <EOR> The worst Indian restaurant to  private party hosted restaurant buffet only $10 food tasted shitt serious no flavor no taste no salt nothing  dal curry tasted bitter lamb curry lamb only bones skin even tandoori chicken didn't taste good  mean way better indian buffets 10 bucks  regular buffet more expensive slight better this  But anyway lot ppl party where charging 10 bucks drinks should done impress people food come back another time but made food bad don't think any those people want again  <EOR> I've frequenting establishment over past 2 years seem changed ownership  once legit spot some Indian food definitely gone diarrhea status    Walk no greets us  Ok let slide even though place almost empty  use restroom see cooks finishing business proceeds walk bathroom without washing hands  Maybe he washed kitchen hope? chose optimistic but definitely great impression  Bring E  coli Hep baby  slather some naan Tika Masala    Fast forward lunch buffet which decent but nothing special  Server never comes walk over ask drink  Again place dead    The nice thing place quiet despite being vicinity convention  But don't think coming back anymore  <EOR> We just love love love restaurant   stay Bellagio but trip down dodgy area just delicious unpretentious food  <EOR> Tasteless food name Indian food!! Waste money disappointing staff behavior well Never recommend anyone  Nothing good write about   Forced give 1 star don't choice give 0 stars  <EOR> For local drive Strip Friday night try Bombay Indian Cuisine would think not  However restaurant conveniently located off I15 Spring Mountain Drive near Wynn most importantly food delicious!!    My daughter  started chicken samosas lamb chicken kabobs onion bhajis   chicken samosas well balanced flavor doughy   kabobs moist flavorful liked lamb best   Onion bhajis yummy just added some mango chutney some heat     For main course ordered chicken tikka masala mutter paneer both which would definitely order again   Each nicely balanced flavor portion     This sixteen year old daughter's first experience Indian food she back try more menu items   agree  <EOR> Stone dAl makhani   Very dirty bathrooms sink leaking   Feel bad server extremely nice professional but write review food poisoning last night eating <EOR>
