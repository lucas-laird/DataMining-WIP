The location perfect needs but unfortunately sat patio which halfway through meal interrupted San Marcos Square performances  loud anyway when add loudspeaker vocal performance talking question    The price decent you'd expect strip casino    I won't going back  <EOR> Extremely pricy   $17 12 inch Margherita pizza   Pizza awful! Margherita veggie pizza terrible    I don't recommend won't back  <EOR> Horrible food price   Salad looked crap no flavor   Risotto without much flavor   believe mess burchetta  <EOR> Good food   Terrible service   manager no idea she doing   Hey getting table complaining within 5 minutes 20?

Yes  would keep mind another special occasion  <EOR> If could give place any lower rating trust would   I can't speak quality food because service awful didn't even stick around order   When approached restaurant host front didn't even acknowledge actually way attention  Once attention she rude passive aggressive tone throughout entire exchange  She sat down table without word  Nothing  waited table server well over 15 minutes acknowledged once  don't even know server supposed because never showed up! Eventually decided would give people business money decided leave  Upon exiting passed same host three servers talking amongst themselves clearly adamant making eye contact us   I generally ALWAYS give restaurants benefit doubt when comes bad service never given negative review but experience absolutely ridiculous   We ultimately dinner restaurant next door Mercato della Pescheria immediately met welcoming easy going staff  evening Mercato wonderful food great  If you've made far into review don't waste your time Canaletto take your business neighbors Mercato della Pescheria  <EOR> Came Vegas over weekend celebrate 25th birthday just eat here  Hands down favorite Italian restaurant  favorites pizza Christina fresh oysters ribeye steak lobster spaghetti but linguini pasta instead   Service always great food always better  Counting down day until come back! <EOR> Amazing dinner  Swordfish carpaccio start  razor thin served capers red onions  was perfect savory prelude main event sea bass then finished off amazing meal shot limoncello   Menu options extensive five different risotto options uh wow! couple grilled rotisserie chicken entrees plenty pasta pizza  Service superb waitress great sport dealing shenanigans over served friends  Would def come back again  <EOR> Been few times when town can't ambiance  bread die owned Il Fornaio  seafood risotto everytime freaking delicious!

Bottom line never come back Canaletto!! Stick buffets if want eat good food!   Only reason given them 2 stars because waiter patient sense humor! slowness evidently control! <EOR> Food just ok $130 dinner but service far worst ever nice restaurant    Won't back can't recommend it  <EOR> We Las Vegas another couple own several Italian restaurants another city group four thoroughly enjoyed meal poor experience previous night tourist trap Giada   service friendly prompt  shared enjoyed every dish ordered group found extensive reasonably priced wine list  <EOR> I Canaletto last month while staying Venetian work conference  whole experience Canaletto great one  food service ambiance all magnificent   For dinner Scaloppine con funghi e speck which veal scaloppine topped portobello mushroom fontina speck think prosciutto all served grilled polenta $26   enjoyed every bite delicious meal  also enjoyed several glasses delicious pinot noir which couldn't tell you   Thankfully when Canaletto work dinner bill wasn't because bit pricey someone young 20s   I highly recommend Canaletto  <EOR> Awful experience    definitely put bad taste mouth   We group four expecting sit down nice dinner  other couple dined previously fantastic memory share thought would same experience   Interior We seated inside main dining room  looked around restaurant decor very pleased saw lighting wall treatments i'm interior architect deisgner    Service When petite server male approached table he asked would order  let know needed few more minutes he rolled eyes disgust said just something drink which respond looked over wine list yet  appalling rude terse he was  He walked away table disappeared 20 30 minutes no exaggeration   saw walking around restaurant  He would look start walk over then turn walk away  When he finally returned table all disgusted but ordered anyway  Perhaps food would cheer up? ummmmmmm keep reading   Food The food COLD  don't know if act rebellion let food sit line long time before delivering but ravioli icy when received it  heard similar responses around table  Another person mentioned theirs bland    This dialogue took place table  one reminds something would olive garden  two No think would insult olive garden  one think you're right plus olive garden comes better service  least would receive bottomless glasses water   This place definitely put damper weekend  say skip put your money elsewhere  <EOR> Where start gues saying location restaurant highlight however mario batali wolf gang puck close which much better choices   came high expectations recommended hotel staff   Ordered calamari bruschetta appetizer calamari decent but nothing special bruschetta probably worst ever had    bread ok but tomatoes salty warmed oven making mushy more salty yucky   enough said good   0 2 for entrees shared margherito pizza which pretty decent seafood entree   pasta hard very undercooked especially taste seafood plenty but taste sauce lacking    Dessert time italian restaurants usually decent desserts coffee tea ok but took while   tiramisu came 10 minutes before drinks didnt look appetizing all taste just bad looked   no flavor wow wasted 8 bucks lady finger cookies cream   Horrible worst world no but price Vegas many options   dissapointed Otto next door following night much better italian meal   wouldnt return place free wouldnt recommend anyone going   Worst olive garden   chef should ashamed food  <EOR> This restaurant must if Vegas! every time am town never disappointed! atmosphere awesome great people watching under venisian sky typically performers  servers super friendly most them Italy  Great place! <EOR> I ate dinner  pizzas pastas pretty good good amount food  caprese awesome very fresh even though amount quite little compared other restaurants to  Service alright  offer some dishes vegetarians too! extensive wine cheese list too! O <EOR> What great place   food excellent pricey   Although little stuffy reservation?     when waiters standing around tables open   Sit bar let Xavier take care you   great customer service     <EOR> Probably more decent meals while Vegas but still quite average personal standards    Nice atmosphere located right St Mark's Square   Friendly guy but extremely slow service! Water being forgotten can't place dessert order no refill olive oil etc      Not many vegetarian choices limited customizations because apparently food pre prepared mornings made order    Portions very inconsistent while some entrees huge others tiny! <EOR> Have three times due convenience  Unfortunately convenience does translate into good food service  Slow slow slow food worth wait  made worse last time watching everyone enjoying food next door Otto much also knowing B B right beneath us   Third time charm going back  <EOR> I admit when comes fine dining straight snob  But hey if know going paying arm leg anorexic portions so called exquisite food entire experience better damn worth it!  How am snob? Well know when walk into restaurant just look around only visually appealing but almost calls your senses saying eat here! sit nice comfy $375984 couch consume food costing $375984 just because know want to! thats usually good sign I'm saying wallet    servers only friendly but look friendly look actually want come back every 2 minutes check enjoying meal  bread  bread must impeccable because kind classy restaurant serves crappy bread?! If ever want test restaurant actually serve good food try bread  If sucks leave but sure eat all bread first even though sucks  If doesnt   well  whether want gip them complimentary bread actually stay rest meal    Anyway atmosphere restaurant probably most important thing me  favorite aspect Canaletto only partially open view public without actually sitting outside making perfect balance between intimate private date more relaxed nice dinner family friends but also situated right next would town square Grand Canal Shoppes  Several times throughout day opera singers jugglers people stilts parade around Shoppes  end show right smack dab front Canaletto  when lucky dinner free show    Now onto food  said good classy restaurant must delicious bread  talking upgraded hoagies buns butter mean freshly baked artisan bread some kind dip sauce  course unlimited bread basket  even though stuff face delicious olive loaf ciabatta sourdough slices still can't wait eat rest meal   For some reason every nice restaurant see fried calamari order it  calamari fried golden delicate crisp homemade tomato tartar sauce  bit both sauces calamari tart crunchy buttery perfection having party your mouth    I've many times actually tried quite few entrees  once ordered prosciutto cheese arugula pizza white truffle oil  only gripe prosciutto slices much big topping simple white pizza  Everytime wanted perfect bite prosciutto cheese arugula I'd entire slice prosciutto then wouldn't proscuitto left next bite dumb  also tried pastas which pretty standard nothing can't find every Italian restaurant but cooked aldente weren't overflowing cheese    So even though appeal restaurant more atmosphere service food delicious no doubt service always superb  <EOR> Excellent all around great service atmosphere food  coming back sure next time when town  Ask Italy wonderful waiter nice gentlemen he was <EOR> I really liked location atmosphere restaurant!   LOT seating available    place located beautiful Grand Canal Shoppes      also free stage show randomly passed by   People dressed costumes Renaissance!   After few hours shopping walking thought would great place take break eat   impression hostess new because she seated table move!?!  Then few minutes later couple nearby ended moving different table too   time afternoon lunch rush over dinner hadn't started yet but still busy   definitely wanted drink ended bar changed mind order food    seemed disorganized didn't comfortable feeling thinking hour lunch might turn into 2 hours lunch     Whilst still lot plans later   Drinks very expensive but  okay vacation only care enjoy time new experience    two bartenders friendly cool other jerk!!  guess he having bad day impatient when couldn't decide drink choice   Plus he made drink wrong he forgot put fresh Strawberries!!!  didn't say anything because tasted great good amount alcohol    when nice bartender came over ordered dessert    lovely dessert Bellini sorbet blackberries baicoli cookies cream very delicious    I'm glad did order food since first experience started off hostess server   paid left big tip hopefully both bartenders shared but knows ?  happy enjoying day can't help when others negative maybe extra tip % cheered moody bartender I love Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes practically came almost every day week vacation Vegas!   Hopefully next time actually nice service great meal  <EOR> We arrived Venetian Thursday dining Canaletto easy choice  location beautiful right center St  Marks square  does crowded times   Service good   Appetizers  Octopus salad Ravioli cream sauce  Entrees Grilled salmon  Risotto seafood Veal scallopine Giant prawns  Dessert  Zabaione Food very good prices where reasonable considering inside Venetian   Would definitely dine again when Vegas  <EOR> The rotisserie chicken dry  enjoyed flavor but difficult through because lack moisture  only factor review Canaletto would star  say service great  waiter friendly responsive  He made experience great even challenges main dish  <EOR> I'm afraid lower Canaletto peg   may just mainly ate time   Homemade light Minestrone Di Verdura Soup good Insalata Cesarina light Caesar Dressing excellent crusty Italian bread rolls really good butter   Roasted Potatoes very good well   But supposed piece de resistance  a whole salt encrusted Branzino  was just very moist but rather bland fish   once deboned reduced down smaller edible portion expected   Plus still wound 4 bones mouth different bites   Service otherwise excellent ambiance patio Venetian's St  Mark's Square electronic violins playing nearby very nice Crespelle Di Mele once again excellent dessert Colombina al Cioccolato very good well second sweet ending party four   But next time return mussels pasta! <EOR> Like number other experiences Las Vegas Canaletto restaurant which should offer top quality meal experience creative upscale environment   While found food quality good execution wasn't par price point restaurant   We tad early 6pm reservation oops didn't seem read note wanted sit outside     Oops didn't remember bring glass water without asking it's Vegas July heaven's sake! bread basket generous fresh served olive oil oops didn't offer balsamic vinegar like other tables received    asked latter mixed oil rather offered jar separate dish   painstakingly reviewed wine options asked 2 glasses off specials menu oops didn't tell none those available need choose wine list   ordered grilled polenta appetizer oops didn't think offer bit red sauce accompany it   main courses grilled free range chicken sea bass bronzino both very good served hot side spinach   I think would great place group room larger table sitting outdoors allows boisterous little details wouldn't matter much   However couples night found ourselves let down service attention detail   If does choose sit outside St Marks Square just keep mind when performers start quite noisy   Canaletto inexpensive think just expecting better overall experience   said still nice setting reasonable experience   4 food but 2 service overall 3  <EOR> I pear ravioli which sounded great 'meh'   Nice location Venetian but wouldn't eat again   much great food Vegas     Great service though   Authentico!
