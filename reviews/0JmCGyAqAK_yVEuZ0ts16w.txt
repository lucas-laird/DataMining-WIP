Used local bar friendly staff  Ive heard its gone down hill since change management big shame  <EOR> I've going Bilbos charleston 8 years love love bartender shes best  <EOR> I really want love place shuffle board pool table darts     including younger crowd some good beer specials  But whats point good beer specials when wait 20 minutes bar drink close annoying    service particular bar man awful he seems more intent drinking couple regulars rather actually doing job serving  <EOR> Tried Bilbo's first time weekend  Spent many years driving past work  Wanted try food since seen specials before   Upon entering must say place extremely CLEAN  Might cleanest bars town    The menu nothing special  No steaks chicken  Just burgers appetizers salads    Had Chef Salad  salad fresh  tons tomatoes which very happy but did any personality it  just average plate    Prices slightly higher would like  $16 sampler platter them seems bit high  isn't Claim Jumper    Service decent  under attentive overly friendly  But weak point    Maybe if want place clean well lit knock down some suds could your spot  If seeking dinner place  <EOR> Typical bar nothing spectacular   ordered wings some sandwiches   sandwiches fine but wings special   service okay but brand new waitress first table she waited   I'd back but just probably wouldn't way  <EOR> This place sucks   since still angry every time drive figure need vent write review   friend St  Patricks   Huge mistake   know know Irish themed    why would someplace Irish themed St  Patrick's Day   Because Irish themed!    Apparently only two bartenders decided show up   rest called sick   two bartenders working tried regale tale rest staff called sick instead taking order!  Finally when he done bitching he asked wanted   But course almost every single kind beer  I guess guy orders beer called sick too? instead making suggestion he just walked off   Needless say left never return   many better places Las Vegas    poker bar just needs close down become something remotely useful  Ok rant over! <EOR> We Bilbo's twice now fun both times   pool table shuffleboard sand table game 2 dart boards   tables other side people want waited on   but gone route   bartender same both times gone he always super nice me   even willing shots something yummy when wasn't sure flavor mood time   felt service good prices normal some beer deals if special   live close definitely back  <EOR> It gotten better since rid creepy bartender Paul   time thought he died back   turns he outside crying hour half   seriously <EOR> I guess your view Bilbo's depends you're looking bar  parent's house stopped couple times  Gordon Biersch Friday because wanted drunk beers watch baseball game except slammed  weren't playing baseball TVs   So came instead  handful people maybe dozen bartender greeted he knew served beer then checking other customers play pool chef   The thing would say seems mostly guys  many lesbians watching baseball other ladies men  wasn't uncomfortable though customers totally did describe lesbo girlfriend across bar  bad 'laid back' means quiet enough hear that  Sigh   Still if fantasy having 'Cheers' bar your own could probably place if come often enough  <EOR> I really wanted place  gave try once every couple months but every time would disappoint me  Sunday mornings perhaps two other people waiter bar tender spend more time watching whatever game TV checking see if want order drink food  When finally order expect wait until half time end game before asked for   I also gave Wall challenge well made point stop work three days row  Unfortunately each day couldn't find card start over third day gave just never back  <EOR> Finally stopped lunch driving 4 years!  Food good beer cold but service left room improvement   wanted love love local watering holes but bartender also waiting tables didn't work well Sunday afternoon   Otherwise I'd say 4 star joint! <EOR> Definitely local's joint  Lots sports viewing    Happy Hour menu cheap  definitely getting pay which isn't much    I didn't expect much Bilbo's but disappointed nonetheless    Why?  The service stunk   Really    We waited adequate amount time beer which spotted bar  yet server working didn't bring table  partner kindly fetched me  [I thirsty ]  Worse she didn't even notice hand when she brought tepid poorly prepared food  Fail   Advice Bilbo's drinks ONLY sit bar  If anything else its your own damn fault  <EOR> We planning going BJ's but wait bit long  dad friend hit place January he loved it  Knowing dad's tastes figured could some decent bar food here  right  salad nachos  Salad fresh but very basic nachos standard pub nachos cheese sauce all   Unlike other reviews found service pretty good but then only people sitting bar  also only ones regulars or think   review would higher except beer prices outrageous  $5 pint Smithwicks $4 75 Sam Adams Summer Ale    yikes   Looks would good place game lots TV's happy hour 3 7pm M F may worth it    <EOR> Even though bartenders waitress super friendly service really slow seemed just Vegas locals here  WHOA! Everyone knew each other felt place   That's visiting Vegas friends!  Oh   the  food? OK  ordered Buffalo Wings  think Domino's better  <EOR>
