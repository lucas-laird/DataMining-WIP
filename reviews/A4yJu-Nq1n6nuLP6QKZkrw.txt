Wtf kind salad without dressing!! Then last time asked some salsa he only puts 1 little cup   when family 4 ordered family meal!! place just rediculous!! management!! <EOR> Just came back El Pollo Loco      Love !  Pros * Juicy chicken  * Cilantro Cream Sauce bomb!!  * huge tostadas  * quick service  Cons * dirty bathrooms w no mirrors  * natural ice tea weird taste it  * don't carry Choco Tacos anymore okay  super old school but must outrageously good because remember ha    Overall El Pollo Loco when feel eating but attempt healthy same time   During visit ordered Chicken Tostada no sour cream plus side creamy cilantro sauce   cilantro sauce pretty thick consistency really doesn't seem healthy but couldn't resist   hard resist that alongside avocado salsa    What's tea?  can't describe taste but definitely some type funk ?  Egh nonetheless back more  ** 4 Celestial Spheres **  Tips * if actually looking count your calorie intake menu lists caloric value every item next you might squint bit   *  Opt cilantro dressing    trust one! * Odelay El Pollo Loco dollar menu!  * $9 99 Family meal deal special going right now <EOR> Absolutely awful  Service awful  Food awful  Worst Pollo Loco EVER  never order messed up  quality food AWFUL  wait line your food no less 30 minutes ever  Chicken rubbery  usually salads which comes complete wilted lettuce old pico de gallo warm salad dressing salsa cold entrees  can't express awful location is  am avid supporter El Pollo Loco never awful experiences location  absolutely refuse location any more  Don't if don't want waste decent chunk change your time piss poor meal  <EOR> I am fan fast food but husband likes chicken coupon off went   He three piece chicken meal which he always likes Grilled Chicken Burrito Combo fajita vegetables very pleasantly surprised   really delicious   expensive fast food offer suggest only going if coupon  <EOR> I love location  They're only El Pollo Loco doesn't mess order first time which plus  Super friendly staff!
