Yum  Gotta give try!  The line long Friday afternoon too  <EOR> Fat Tuesday far best deal all alcoholic slurpee spots Las Vegas    The first time tried hot summer day July  exhausted walking strip tried dodge into any air conditioned hotel could find  But same time Vegas wanted party    What caught eye Fat Tuesday colorful swirls going yardsticks  ordered mango daiquiri yardstick just $18  Super good deal! extra vodka shot just $1    The staff super friendly  give them credit dealing drunk people all day clamoring drink but managed keep cool serve everyone    In opinion taking picture yardstick Las Vegas pretty much mandatory  if you're going Fat Tuesdays best deal town  <EOR> We only drinks didn't anything chippery   sat watched zeus show the drink excellent  <EOR> You can't wrong Fat Tuesday's  Known frozen slushie style drinks flavored mixed different types alcohol depending get  lot slushy type places but best  let try whatever free too  bartenders usually help recommendations even mix flavors if want  discounted refills when refill approved cup many different sizes styles cups    Highly recommended  <EOR> Came great service first time  Then came refill other guy jerk    couldn't names but should all friendly look happy b work if dnt work  <EOR> Hunted down place seeing some awesome reviews here   Tried 44 Magnum which combination 190 Octane Cat 5 Hurricane  really good nice buzz going! Amaretto Pineapple bit bitter taste though  place definitely worth checking out! <EOR> Not great service No sign don't take cards under $5  Bartender helpful <EOR> When Vegas MUST least order Fat Tuesday    I cannot think better way heat Vegas  Pina Colado Strawberry Daiquiri amazing variety flavors choose from  favorites Hurricane Bellini mixed together! those can't stand taste alcohol perfect you  But don't let fool there's actually quite fair amount alcohol slowly creeps you! Also extra shots $1 more also jello shots $1! Such great deal  sizes perfect sharing ranging 20oz 100oz if want BIG   There many Fat Tuesday locations such Forum Shop Mandalay Bay Planet Hollywood MGM Palazzo few more can't remember haha  Don't travel far one!  Tip Bring back your cup discounted price You'll definitely back  <EOR> Go ham but only if handle  boyfriend Magnum flavor big yard cup  flavor less fruity other ones  personally liked but if prefer sip fruity drinks then skip flavor  Also looks safe cute slushy form but don't sippin whole cup once    Minus star guy helped us  He rushing through next didn't take time pick liked  boyfriend also paid 20 dollars it  But keep cup cheaper refills    I'd say try least once when you're Vegas  When you're holding yard cup down Strip lot people might give questionable glances  if you're boyfriend might seem silly holding giant cup around  But try once! <EOR> Fat Tuesdays excellent choice sweet fruit drink mug while walking strip  should keep your mug save few bucks refills  Also buy additional shots even better  suggestion if add additional shots 3 them put first two bottom layer frozen drink then put extra shot top  MIX before consuming!!!  Note try different flavors flavor combination suggestions you  <EOR> The perfect spot way more alcohol should!!! If young beautiful bartender named Leilani shift ready great day! gonna strong drink great service! Even local visit place again again! must if you're town! <EOR> Out all Fat Tuesday locations best!  Let's face all come alcohol look cool while holding gigantic cups daiquiri down Strip rating place purely drinks taste alcohol strength strong!!!  All weekend long saw people holding Fat Tueaday cups 88oz guitar drinks Hard Rock bar debating b t two    I'm glad FT because drinks DELICIOUS never would able finish 88oz daiquiri myself bathroom anyone?     I bellini which mainly champagne some fruity juice absolutely delicious coming lightweight  wanted sip all day long!!   My cousin 190 octane the strongest drink he gettin' pretty buzzed  both right before flight back home great idea btw security airport much more fun snooze through whole flight   Next time getting right when land Vegas happily buzzed all weekend  offer cheaper refills if keep cup if think start Caesar walk towards Mandalay Bay refill multiple times along way at Mirage Planet Hollywood etc keep your happiness level going strong all day  Yeah!!!!  Anyway definitely must try when you're town all drinks taste good can't wrong  second largest size good enough me  Only biggest size if you're ready sloshed  Good night! <EOR> So stopped just every Fat Tuesdays Vegas each review exact same copy exact same 5 stars because bad experience place place start poppin Vegas trip 11am 2am! not sure early open but 11am earliest started rager! They dozens drink options combinations all tastes good! drink fond much but into moment I chose $12 mug option which comes $9 refills considering club first night charged $17 50 Jack Coke $9 refills lasting good 2 hours pure joy!  the three drinks ordered were Margarita refilled 2x bomb com best slushy margarita ever! sour sweet alcohol arse good!   Strawberry Mango combo refilled 3x obviously favorite strawberry mango combo divine sweet punch alcohol oh good  Superman no refills least favorite shame being named favorite superhero! named because two drink choices share same colors Eye Candy blue believe 190 octane being red  i thought Eye Candy would blue raspberry flavor but over sweet cotton candy type  the combo wasnt favorite meh did refill this  you can't Vegas without getting crazy off Fat Tuesdays! <EOR> This place awesome! stop everytime town  Oddly enough there's guy works  Arvada CO he repeatedly asks why often    My personal favorite 190 Octane  slushy concoction partially frozen screwdriver vodka OJ then typically add 3 5 additional shots grain alcohol    IF DARE PLEASE REMEMBER MIX SHOTS 3 5 STRAIGHT SHOTS EVERCLEAR END!  That's very important step    These things cold straw freeze dead middle summer when 110 outside gotta keep drinking  careful though because they'll end hurry   They've plenty extras though various drinks stop by    They also 4 other strip locations try plan 2 stops your night jumping next    MGM Grand Stratosphere Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops always forget last one    damn  <EOR> My hubby shared 44 magnum which Cat 5 Hurricane 190 Octane extra shot vodka  bought Fat Tuesday souvenir cup refill because offer couple dollars off refill nice!  drink sweet very strong gives nice buzz enough share amongst two people   quite refreshing especially hot Las Vegas sun  <EOR> Ya stuff pretty dangerous     Located very end Caesars Forum shops hole wall  school night he wanted drink   They give 2 samples try various flavors mix match  cups glasses kinda $$$ but if tend drink lot or share multiple refills then bargain   You slurp stuff down slushy!!!  Drinking school night?!  That = TROUBLE    <EOR> Frozen drinks staple Las Vegas  many places choose but Fat Tuesday probably most widely known  mixer flavors always try strawberry mix mango similar flavor  let add more shots alcohol your choosing stir all well fruity frozen concoction must try Vegas! <EOR> WHOOOOO YAAAAAA everyone talks wants try  ended trying Caesar's palace even little show while waiting line! did walk through mall bit near Nike Factory store   When line pretty long but no time front  believe mango lemonade tequila? can't quite remember weekend blur but sure anything worth  drink slushy enough mask sting alcohol but taste it  did good level buzzed lol but didn't last long  long stick enough another friend share but cup mug sizes those don't want much  also carry around walk!   It's fun watching everyone else drinks think some guy yard! almost Fat Tuesday all big hotels they're everywhere strip  totally traditional thing try when you're Vegas!!   ** menu pic hopefully helps ya'll deciding your drink beforehand! <EOR> Maybe reason why love Fat Tuesday much because PA possibly second most restrictive state USA regards alcohol   but digress     This place AWESOME! expecting pay fortune when wanted drink Caesar's some standalone kiosks drinks over 50$   I'm even kidding until came across Fat Tuesday    They many amazing flavors chose Electric Lemonade  blue tasted amazing  Super strong well  bought 14$ refillable cup strong didn't need refill   HAHA   Fat Tuesday absolute must your trip Vegas! <EOR> One word BELLINI =]  Btw don't suckered into watching Atlantis show middle courtyard! LOL  business  <EOR> I've done fair share daquiri type alcohol drink experimentation strongly urge skip straight Fat Tuesdays when Vegas  Yes other places try lure create cups all shapes but drinks never fail all sugar little alcohol   FT down science great taste more you're bang your buck where alcohol concerned  mix flavors if want $2an extra shot 151 rum  Seriously place can't beat!! always tumbler just come back $10 refills  enough drink having carry ridiculously sized shaped cup down strip  Just trust first! <EOR> Omg  If you're looking big drink you're going here  If you're dumb don't deserve enjoy Las Vegas way you're supposed to  <EOR> Love FAT TUESDAY when VEGAS!  I've all Fat Tuesday location honestly location crappiest service ever! Did ask if wanted extra shot drink just poured drink paid  it  polite nothing    also location horrible!

Cat 5 Hurricane Bacardi 151   Despite still sure much alcohol actually there   I'd recommend getting least extra shot all those calories worthwhile  <EOR> I love Fat Tuesday's awesome  may visit them often would but current visit wasn't would expect  bartender did try sale which didn't like  only place wish would inform specials  fast do  plus  But extremely way locals   Which guess understand but wish locals location  <EOR> This place really good  really something everyone  Extra house shots slush drinks only $1 each    Their priced $5 100oz $40  slush drink prices  <EOR> Always extra shot   If raging alcoholic pretty much just slurpee   Pace yourself cuz stuff full sugar   Its good drink become bigger Tuesday   Hence Fatty Tuesday  <EOR> Buying drink Fat Tuesday part Vegas Vacation Tradition  Everyone walk Strip yard slushy goodness  daiquiri choice 190 Octane extra shot but fun try all flavors  could also mix them together  Once Strawberry Daiquiri mixed Pina Colada  would give place 5 stars but really sweet could feel film sugar form your teeth but totally worth taste buzz  <EOR> 1st time trying place  much drinker  hurricane Cat 5 whatever  good but regretting extra shot  am light weight just other drink bar sick next day unfortunately! <EOR> I saw many people Fat Tuesdays finally able find one  Half yard mango rum only $12  Add extra shot only $1   Great way start afternoon bring while shopping site seeing  mango rum tastes quiet strong warned ahead time all those 1 shot wonders   Seems lots people recommending 190 octane definitely need try next time back Vegas! <EOR> Who doesn't love alcohol slurpees?
