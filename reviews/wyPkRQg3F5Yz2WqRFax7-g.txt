The food atmosphere anything but boring! <EOR> Sometimes when desperate hungry cling closest place eat   arrived Vegas short unplanned visit funeral   often free comp rooms Harrahs Caesar properties lucked book night Octavius tower evening   However upon arrival before 4 pm checkin informed due convention town room ready   since 5 30 am only eaten half donut Starbucks coffee   After being informed room ready until when provided phone number called when was headed closest food area happens when hungry don't want busy food court but seeing prices menu should bolted   small place Caesar's Palace ideal conventioneers tourists wouldn't know better but quiet almost empty Monday middle day   The menu itself reflection name place Munchbar   some told funny name when checked @Yelp but really munchies fast food drinks   only gave place 3 stars because food itself which important good enough   asked medium burger I bbq bacon came perfect   service pleasant enough   What really good prices know Vegas prices but am sure burgers 16 dollar category even Vegas unless some fancy celebriturd chef looking Ramsay!

After walking whole strip fiancé cousin exhausted wanted quick bite before going room night    yeah didn't happen  First all server dry borderline snobby place all busy 3 other tables w people already basically done eating  why did take forever mere your drinks  ordered Bloody Mary quite tasty  even longer wait entrees came nachos absolutely no taste resembled some Taco Bell shit chicken Caesar sandwich beyond dry because excess bread lack Caesar dressing well lacking CHICKEN! seriously deli slice chicken breast ridiculous! might well cafe since pricing same $70 2 sandwiches nachos Bloody Mary  I no idea crackhead wrote other good revues but guarantee place joke!  I think think all people come drunk treat them however give them shit food  <EOR> Pretty good decently priced place eat Caesar's Palace  food court probably take just long receive your food but customer service munchbar way better  kosher hot dog chili cheese bucket fries which pretty good  Kind disappointed when returned some smores sundae sundae machine broken ran Blue Moon T T <EOR> A nice place grab bite if you're staying Cesar's nothing worth traveling but much better food court much more money   The restaurant empty but service still slow   I highly recommend cucumber gimlet its sweet strong   Also sweet potato fries great burger solid   The lobster rolls just bits lobster 3 tiny hot dogs I'd opt something else   Portions appetizers somewhat small price   From look place thinks its super hip but really its more your every day American food  <EOR> After great day crashed hard hotel room woke find everything pretty much closing down  city appears never sleep kind disappointing    We tired but hungry  thought walking strip find something but couldn't even bother leave hotel walking around bit find something anything open hotel settled upon place    Munchbar interesting view  If see scantily clad women dancing your dinner your place  tired interested sat elsewhere basically view slots but whatever  just wanted food   The waitress really perky late night  probably grumpy just wanted food but she didn't catch kept trying cheer small talk  Maybe she thought she wouldn't good enough tip if she didn't but all honesty just wanted job leave alone  still groggy super long nap little irritated slept long  don't come Vegas sleep!  My friend grilled cheese tomato soup chicken caesar wrap  two bites food both decided weren't impressed then thought maybe because tired ate some more unfortunately nothing changed few more bites  grilled cheese wasn't very cheesy  think cook only put slice cheese sandwich very weak flavor  tomato soup tasted tomatoes no flavors spices all    My wrap heavily dressed  hardly any chicken tomato all lot lettuce dressing because overwhelming amount dressing lettuce super soggy  Bleh  fries came wrap warm later became ice cold  couldn't even enjoy fries  ended eating half meals then going Walgreens see if could find something supplement bad experience  <EOR> Was Vegas work last week  long day finally caught break around 4 5pm  Didn't want far food but remembered Caesar's food meh soso  walk towards Forum Shops food but MunchBar caught eye  Nice branding location ambiance    Sat down waitresses very friendly  Saw guy next eating Roasted Chicken  Ordered it  um delicious! 2 pieces tender juicy chicken plus hella mashed potatoes lots corn  Don't know why no one's really mentioned it?
