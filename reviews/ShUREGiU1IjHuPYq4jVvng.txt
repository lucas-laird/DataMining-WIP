I met sister brother in law Vegas Christmas Flame Steakhouse dinner Christmas Eve  little unsure place considering location downtown really isn't known fine dining but reading reviews yelp thought sister found diamond rough  wrong!   For starters reason picked Flame stone crab which menu prominently mentions October until May  Christmas Eve clearly during period but didn't any when said wouldn't all weekend    So did started French Onion soup which bland nothing special  very little onion would say par would Coco's Denny's  entree shrimp scampi which again bland nothing special  could hardly smell any garlic all  better Olive Garden fraction cost  if bland food nothing special place you    Then service which completely atrocious! Slow inattentive would most complimentary things could say it  point sister made comment bad service only brother in law mention last time service bad also  apparently bad service standard here    At point would 2 stars instead just food edible even if bland but other element dinner  seated table adjacent row booths  woman booths somehow lost cell phone between cushions booth  bring maintenance man literally tear apart only booth woman sitting but booth behind well retrieve phone  incredibly loud disruptive took over half hour!!   I wanted take care woman help phone but expense disrupting meals everyone else restaurant  completely unacceptable  should waited until restaurant closed then retrieved phone    Overall bad experience never back  <EOR> As resident Lv am trying local steakhouses avoiding trendy overpriced designer steakhouses  Very good food here  Decent prices too  Sides huge should split cuz could stuff down more bite  Bar just outside door 2 1 martini menu during happy hour  two delish martinis $7  Wow! paid $22 strip one  Old casino but very clean personable staff  Winner dinner  <EOR> This decent steakhouse downtown Vegas  mind blowing gourmet many places strip but offers decent steak fair price  <EOR> On second visit Flame began nicely baked dish Oysters Rockefeller cooked oysters dressed fresh spinach Hollandaise Sauce Pernod    followed crock tasty cheesy French Onion Soup before enjoying Chicago Style Garbage Salad which small but very yummy boasting chopped Iceberg Lettuce tomato Artichoke Hearts Kalamata Olives marinated mushrooms Genoa Salami cucumber unmarinated mushrooms sweet onions Garbanzo Beans Cheddar Cheese light Lemon Vinaigrette Dressing     A large Deep Fried Walleye Pike snuggled inside light breading excellent entrée while dinner rolls just okay   Large sautéed Mushrooms very good crunchy Fresh Cut Fries instant hit   Scoops Haagen Dazs Chocolate Butter Pecan Ice Cream dipped whipped cream cool treat meal's end   Service good except slow pick consumed items   steakhouse ambiance nice refined   XXXX 1 2 overall particular outing! <EOR> We cocktail shrimp HUGE very yummy    Surf Turf which believe 8oz filet mignon looked could've 10oz 3 king crab legs any fresher would've pinched    He New York Strip baked potato also huge    also glass wine he soda   Everything came $90   I've paid more less quality   Everything extremely delicious fresh   Even complimentary bread felt tasted just pulled fresh oven!
