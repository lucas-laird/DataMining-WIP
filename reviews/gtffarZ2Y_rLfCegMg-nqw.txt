Don't wrong understand purpose controlling cost goods   more double portion Chipotle across town  <EOR> The food just good any other Chipotle deal lack training maybe? ordered twice now apparently don't know difference between veggie burrito burrito no meat  When order veggie burrito thinking should veggies it  built both times burrito no meat  irritated right now  Every Chipotle knows veggie burrito but one  avoiding particular now on  <EOR> There many Chipotles around valley but staff location beyond phenomenal! Smiles all staff members rush finish your order  Emily helped visit efficient well educated restaurant   Definitely recommend coming here! <EOR> I'm sure why location many negative reviews particularly because best Chipotle location far  work mall frequent customer at least twice per week because closest restaurant store  employees ALWAYS greet everyone walks through door they're super friendly  little stingy amount food put like come dude should more willing oblige someone willing risk getting E  coli eating but if ask them add more without complaint  actually gotten meal comped few times over months visited because often nice see big chains still willing acknowledge treat loyal customers  other reviews read complained incredibly long line but ever since whole E  coli debacle there's hardly wait anymore! Would totally recommend location if you're mall! <EOR> Absolutely horrible service! three times never satisfied  never customer Chipotle again  Twice messed order every time gave such measly portion  understand measured portion but served even less that  once charged dollar cup salsa less halfway filled  When asked least filled gave nasty attitude  Absolutely ridiculous! All ask decent service proper meal establishment never able provide that  Oh once totally ripped tortilla burrito! employee rolled tight ripped apart wasn't because stuffed measly burrito  still served way  wtf bro  But nah no more! Chipotle SUCKS!!!!! <EOR> Inconsistent service Chipotle  Attitude service employees probably use some work   On positive note food consistent every chipotle! steak pretty good maybe even little more medium rare side but steaks anyways! <EOR> Carnitas salad cheese sour cream salsa guacamole please!
