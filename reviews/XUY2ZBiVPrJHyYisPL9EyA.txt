Took 5 mins but 10 minute wait cuz during peak time  bad! Definitely coming again! <EOR> Very good hangover food  beef noodle soup $8 99 bargain compared all other overpriced crap vegas   bowl soup three separate occasions  Tasty each every time although portions seemed vary 20%   rest bin food looked rather mediocre though  If going 1side 2 item combos probably better look panda express across way  <EOR> O oh OH disappointment   Employees seemed ok but all There  Food looked good   BUT  The broth tasted funny beef noodle soup noodles tasted broth YUCK  The PHO terrible  Worst egg rolls ever   WTF deal no pork!! catering actually <EOR> I visited place last year parents when leave forgot take bag leave chair  When noticed half hour   So back bag missing disappeared  But very nice lady restaurant helps find it!!! She helps call security guy then decent gentleman bring bag back!!! Five stars good heart !!!! <EOR> I thought Wasabi Jane's just another fast food stand located Food Court within Venetian Casino Resort just doesn't quite measure rest stands  Having two kids tow family doesn't luxury sit through fine dining extended meals  food stands stopped dinner   The ordering process fine asked cup ice water proceeded charge 10 cents ice water  When inquired charge replied plastic cup   life could locate cup charge menu anywhere false advertising some type bad business practice which later report BBB   Their udon noodle just ok nothing outstanding but charge left sour taste mouths   Oh just your reference walk 10 steps Panda Express same food court ice waters yes plural extra plates extra napkins fortune cookies utensils all FREE! Never going back Wasabi Jane's  Another thing spell name Wassabi Jane's receipt  Anyone cannot spell own names properly really should operating any business  <EOR> Looks good but don't fooled! worst seafood udon ever tasted  Seafood tasted old soup tastes water  Horrible! <EOR> Don't eat here! Waste money! Beef soup no tAste! Broth taste water! disappointed! <EOR> Poor service bad food  Avoid place   am surprised something poor quality rude service business resort   people behind counter could speak english intentionally acted ignorant   If asked question price switching side dish would answer yes    If asked ingredients any dish would reply yes    When asked manager two different people could respond other then looking asking wanted order    stood ground eventually manager came over   soon learned she authoritative teacher rudeness   see other reviews comment upfront pricing quality varies   simply asked why don't people speaking english   NO reply   repeated question   She looked crazy asked wanted   am rude visitor restaurants most people working restaurants hard workers deserve respect   A holes  <EOR> Shit  Literally shit   I saw review guy said beef noodle amazing beef noodle soggy doesn't taste anything isn't spicy shows picture just plain bad  <EOR> There nobody line ordered won ton noodle soup  now almost 20 minutes later still waiting   would expect food court let alone soup  even busy  only handed other order since standing here <EOR> Disclaimer only poke bowls some other tasty looking cooked bowls eg Taiwanese minced pork Chinese pork bbq bowl potential    Food stopped poke bowls  Underwhelmed unfortunately flavors fish toppings  Positive thing portion size  Spicy salmon poke some variation hot sauce semi spicy really no flavor other that   Salmon poke fresh good cuts  Seaweed salad topping way salty Edamame cucumbers fresh Onion crisps hard bits crispy Seaweed salad sesame topping good  Space food court within Venetian Palazzo complex  Plenty seating nearby   Service fast professional  Price overpriced quality food but expected Strip   Skip spicy salmon poke  Try something else menu  <EOR> So walking strip hours finally took sites Venetian  now 5 star hotel but don't 5 star cash? new job player!
