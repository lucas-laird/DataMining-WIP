She then said she would manager call back took phone number    never called back report incident bank   am also filing formal complaint against Visa Merchant account since violated terms service acted inappropriately when error show them   So     If enjoy bad service management KEEPS your credit card gouges customers Fathers' Day serves food causes diarrhea Makino Decator place you! <EOR> I am  sure anyone given place 3 4 stars  Yes good amount food choose but doesn't any buffet? hot items almost warm almost warm mean kinda hot more kind room temperature  love sushi many AYCE sushi places definitely would sushi  Unless if think ok if cannot tell difference between salmon tuna when close your eyes because all fish tasteless fishy oh room temperature        Pretty sure raw fish sitting being served room temperature fact food safety violation am really hoping sick being dumb enough eat pieces plate  rolls ok actually flavor mostly due sauce however  All those say place good sushi probably also same people call california roll some roll mayonnaise cream cheese sushi not        place empty lunch time friday taste why is  staff admit friendly service would expect buffet food however nothing special  Money well spent  Quality lacking am really disappointed yelper followed advice some people obviously really care put mouth when read reviews place  last comment case did notice really did care sushi should just say if rating only sushi would given them only 1 star second star came because some good appetizer type selections such calamari pickled cucumbers seaweed salad udon kim chee along some others such edemame  Sorry others discriminating pallet ate here  first review am only writing because amazed far off reviews place really are  <EOR> Outstanding value money   Sushi all fresh   staff very attentive   selections beyond would expect!! <EOR> This review long over due  Service fast drinks being seated  Probably more decent ACE compared SD  hungry everything seemed good  <EOR> Pretty good quality buffet   Good value selection choose from     bit far strip parking hassle but otherwise pretty good spot <EOR> Makino much better Todai! many selections sushi always fresh when there  took lot friends they've all impressed yay! think also better other all you can eat sushi places because don't finish everything plate  hate places charge just because leave grain rice plate    <EOR> After having passed sign great sushi restaurant outlet center only find closed down  decided drive location Decatur  First off smelt bad outside place already didn't good feeling  inside its bad  People nice sat quickly  very busy Sunday night  food almost immediately think bad idea  None sushi cold  room temperature  Sushi hand rolls crab legs NOTHING  COLD  take bite yellow tail sure made smell but did NO THANK YOU  done point  husband having tummy steel continued on  Almost immediately leaving he starts saying stomach doesn't feel good  think sushi bad   needless say myself husband child sick entire night  place sucks  Worst sushi place ever tried  <EOR> I would choose Sushi buffet over Todai  lot more unique sushi varieites pieces bigger tastier  huge fan sushi but Makinos  tell use fresh ingredients stuff don't sit long  But beware Yelpers there   they couple location all same  would stay away Premium Outlet    that horrible  Totally opposite Decatur Blvd  dinner crab legs cocktail shrimps  Crab legs aren't bad depending season  cooked items may whole lot choose Todai because mostly focused sushi section but overall bad selection taste  Might earlier weekends holiday because wait  Definitely reservation larger party  <EOR> We regulars Makino Charleston Outlets but just found closed since last December drove Decatur location  sushi fresh but also love oysters grilled Salmon colar baked prawns steamed Crab legs Teriyaki Beef tonkatsu ramen Shrimp Tempura many more  Service fast staff kept drinks filled used plates removed regularly  <EOR> By far best sushi seafood Las Vegas! Just located 15 minutes away strip  promise won't disappointed! <EOR> One best Japanese buffets ever to  They've large selection sushi  They've dessert section well includes ice cream cakes chocolate fountain fruit  offer shrimp noodles orange chicken soups ceviche  Top quality food  only thing quite busy you'll sit close other tables  waiters very attentive  <EOR> I'm huge sushi buffet enthusiast because cheap love mass quantities food super excited head Makino's $17 lunch buffet  But pretty disappointed whole experience    First because we'd tried dinner buffet 9 pm previous night but turned away because taking away food  But managed glimpse gleaming heap oysters crab legs decidedly lacking lunch buffet    Second because all rolls tasteless bland seemed variations same thing  hate deceit!   Third because small selection fresh sashimi  love mackerel but sad see few paltry pieces corner   The best thing Makino dessert bar's chocolate fountain  Holy shit no idea fabulous thing chocolate fountain could be  Bowls fruit marshmallows long sticks yum yum yummy chocolate coating  But kind pissed off when turned off 2 30 half hour before stated closing time   All all so so  <EOR> Food ok  Price bad  But here's did when lunch today  put your check table when you're done just cashier pay  middle busy lunch time restaurant packed servers started taking all checks all tables later replaced them different ones  new ones $3 higher old ones! When asked why said cashier new she trained wrong  When told bad business show customer check then replace more expensive said sorry it! BAD BUSINESS! made mistake should dignity suck eat few dollars lost! Worst part no sincerity apology  <EOR> I eat often because across street office never bad experience  sushi good but best  Its acceptable lunch  service always great even place always being packed  decent selection isn't over priced  <EOR> Sushi heaven!! sushi amazing! sushi ready made pick bunch different rolls try  love cream mussels  Good selection desserts  green tea cheesecake delicious! hot food well different types salads  $18 lunch great price well  <EOR> Great buffet off strip especially considering many many options sushi along other great Japanese selections  They'll even custom roll if ya ask them!! prices low well <EOR> I loved place service great!!! came 12pm amd packed already long waiting line    waited 30 mins sitted but worth it   because food great    everything tasty delicious    Only thing think could put little more food choices buffet line lol    but everything else great!!! Thanx great service!!! <EOR> Great place seafood meats  highly recommend sukiyaki when it  Great variety! only negative ice cream station never manned  common sight see people waiting while before eventually leaving going searching four someone  <EOR> Broken Hearted!  going Makino's every week over 13 years loved every experience until lately   Something's changed seems they're going 'cheap' route   sang praises restaurant everyone if Sushi comes superb until now   Now just okay far where was   Changed some type rice dry cheap taste dishes wasabi changed disposable plastic   Tuna red appears color added   Since when put pieces carrot sushi rolls unless you're looking cheap filler?  many rolls cream cheese   cream chees but should slight presence sushi rolls   final straw 'cheapness' don't even toothpicks anymore   Okay when stopped offering mints but toothpicks important little cost effect   Looks end era  <EOR> OH GOD     What big disappointment      I've 5 times previously pretty good inexpensive sushi buffet   Clean well prepared sushi    actually enjoyed lot before   So came back again immideletly noticed quality food wend down MUCH  Now same level Todai   Mexican style sushi place  real sushi place  So bad     if u Todai then enjoy place   But last time eating hee  Yucky        <EOR> I buffet place buffet places strip   Love all sushi shrimp tempura gyoza      Yum!

<EOR> I am avid sushi go er past 10 years lived Las Vegas  tried sushi high end places places based location alone would probably never even dare try  safe say know sushi know when sushi good    and when good  Today boyfriend's birthday he also sushi lover  trying surprise somewhere new because while now gone same sushi place because KNOW good stumbled upon place Makino while searching top all you can eat sushi Las Vegas also didn't break bank account  chose Makino its high review ratings because offered wide range desserts unlike most other all  you can eat sushi restaurants only offer few my boyfriend loves desserts wanted wide selection birthday but most sushi places only offer few desserts     Upon walking must say quite ecstatic honestly entrance can't see much except dessert section boy did those desserts look good  proud myself when looked boyfriend's face saw he looked very excited dessert table both sweet tooths However gleeful period did last long  soon seated headed sushi section low behold array sushi  Based appearance expecting sushi taste wonderful because all looked pretty  initially bothered though no way tell each roll consisted of  no labels all above sushi told inside each roll selected based upon appearance alone  first roll tasted actually tasted pretty good  bit warmer would preferred sushi but still pleasant  jumped into next bit sushi plate thinking it'd just good but wasn't case  mouth immediately became overwhelmed fishiness not good subtle kind but kind when fish spoiled tried swallow down but strong spit into napkin  top being embarrassing since boyfriend right next eager all try anymore sushi however did try more piece just see if maybe time deal but nope  next piece put mouth some type fish blatantly dry tough swallow without choking down water well    I disappointed say least because main reason sushi because both love sushi much but when looked over boyfriend's plate he hardly touched sushi and he NEVER lets food waste especially sushi   Even though sushi pretty bad moved other food  Crab legs clams fried rice even chow mein tried pretty much everything because hungry figured maybe just sushi bad  But no  wasn't just sushi  stacked plate chow mein clams calamari fried rice salmon vegetables tempura etc  ONLY thing thought tasted good vegetables tempura and if bad would amazed because pretty hard something fried taste bad   clams mushy liked they'd overcooked fried rice seemed no flavor besides oil cooked same chow mein    Lastly gave Makino last chance last chance impress hoped badly least yummy looking desserts would delicious  both tried all desserts while weren't incredible weren't bad either  textures most them odd creamy appeared but rather more jello but neither minded because tasted good  cookies all fairly good chocolate mousse impressed me    All all if someone asked if would recommend place would say absolutely not  only reason even gave two stars ambiance because place relaxed even buffet other star chocolate mousse  usually critical actually never leave reviews but felt necessary time because think place all worth $60 spent $27 99 per person + tax   hope if try better experience maybe boyfriend just bad day  <EOR> This place expensive but seems worth most part  sushi very diverse bunch options haven't seen other sushi buffet restaurants   I'm sure compare other sushi buffet restaurants since if you've going other ones Todai while now gotten tired same old stuff then place great place try something different   However only once good experience but wouldn't necessarily recommend going place any sushi buffet restaurant all time  <EOR> I going Makino several years now  used least four eight times month during time  Over time realized going quite bit less but couldn't put finger why    Today again  plate when sushi three mexican sushi chefs loudly carrying conversation spanish  OK times tough first rate sushi places real Japanese chefs  But alienate your customers something place sushi restaurant?

But think if you're charging your customers full dinner prices $26 00 so   despite fact workers may want hurry home   maybe try catch late poker tournament    but if you're business hours says close 9 30pm    customer's eating getting rid all food pretty much pressuring your customers hurry eat leave 9 30pm   very poor business practice   They should've least advice 8 50pm all foods removed closing 9 10pm   Rather just charging full price then pretty much rushing there   In city where there's full buffets good restuarants   admit food bad   Todai quality    maybe tad bit better   but very bad business practice   if you're planning hit Makino's somewhat late   dont forget immediately 3 plates full stuff want    <EOR> Food just good Maintained high quality standards  Just better any other sushi buffet to  Servers really nice  Price just right  wish los angeles would eat twice week if one  <EOR> This best most fresh sushi buffet encountered  off Vegas strip but far  twice still crave everytime visit Sin City! buffet great if you're still looking more specific hand rolls just ask sushi chefs they'll you  They're extemely generous salmon hand roll filled salmon spilling salmon  overwhelmed  <EOR> Go during Luch time  Fewer people still great quality food!!! <EOR> Perhaps 3 5 rather 4   I've eaten few times well Premium Outlets say favor Decatur more   Been both lunch dinner  Selection more extensive Outlet location  Same food but more choose from  Sushi entrees delicious seafood meats soups rice  Always warm they're very quick replace something   Dessert could better though  mean quality over quantity but I'd love more choices choose rather just ice cream fruit 2 kinds cake   I'm fan though price comparable some AYCE sushi joints but Makino plus more! <EOR> Buffet style lot sushi more   poor quality food   seating tight   bathrooms smelly Asian comfortable   if friends aren't really your friends   great place!

Speaking barely tasting something would save money just order water instead iced green tea  first convincing myself flavor wasn't strong because food eating but when boyfriend tried he pretty much said paid $1 75 green water lol   I know buffet but same price AYCE sushi bars lunch really if you're craving sushi opt Sakana for nigiri Goyemon for rolls Umiya for ton appetizers   There's nothing wrong service here  would say could space tables little more felt less community seating   Luckily when towards late end lunch service starting empty but experiences past where practically bumping elbows strangers while eating    Honestly think done Makino now least until decide give annual pilgrimage old time's sake haha  <EOR> Omg dump  all eat garbage  feed vegas pig farm afterwards   should ashamed charge 28 95 this   Panda express would nicer <EOR> As sushi buffets  this gets top rating   Not your typical 'california rolls' buffet few odd things added in   real sushi chefs working behind large bar   sushi extreamly FRESH replaced often   Tuna just die nothing beats flavor fresh fish!

They offer all eat crab legs   The hot dishes hit miss   those all depend your personal preferences   Their wait staff actually pretty good prices very reasonable  <EOR> Mediocre buffet food  few vegan options but ideal all  Avoid if can  <EOR> Massive Japanese buffet    Big selection affordable    Just very good     The miso soup really bland think few times ran miso    just ended getting warm water     hot food ranges bad mediocre  sushi afraid eating buffet sushi    heard many horror stories people getting sick But hear OK here    Nothing special    Maybe little much rice but supposed fresh  Service fast efficient   wouldn't say staff friendly    But rude     The giant octopus sculpture thing amazing though   +1 star alone  <EOR> Great food beef little overcooked  sushi great looking flavors mouth watering love coming here  Its worth price! <EOR> I truly believe Asian all eat buffets only good  Walking decor space sort felt burger would pretty disappointing  However glad try   We arrived 12 30 Thursday 1 hour open all tables full  waited 10 minutes spot  place packed!  The first thing tried sushi  many choices lot rolls pretty generous portion fish! clear star sushi station clearly hand rolls! pick couple types fish they'll fresh hand roll spot! All fish really fresh said portions pretty generous! many different rolls but lot them seemed just variations each other maybe 5 7 distinct types rolls  all very good!  Next hot entrees  really unique ramen station where construct your own bowl ramen! didn't give try but seemed pretty cool  lot options teriyaki fried rice fish some veggie plates! All food kept nice temperature pretty flavorful! impressed   The dessert station pretty disappointing however  typical Asian buffet cakes  small little bites cake  but all pretty flavorless  blueberry mousse flan both sort rubbery didn't taste very good  cheesecake pretty good though!

Overall  Great experience friendly staff good food  <EOR> all eat japanese food more ask for? place busy very crowded  thats reason doesnt 5  food good  kinda wonder food when hear buffet all eat  but place  think bite almost everything but dish liked most spicy ramen  cant wait back  <EOR> I lunch some co workers mixed feelings   Let's way actually novelty all you can eat sushi buffets  seeing all food just picking want  appreciate being able buffets way faster made to order places and positive side effect others faster less likely you'll show spontaneously night figure Plan B because there's 45 minute line door    A big positive Makino variety  huge selection hot food including made to order ramen 10 types nigiri assorted temaki 14+ different rolls lunch  desserts well which tend small bites pleasant subtle flavors   Unfortunately where Makino really suffers fish quality  fish just mediocre  would actually avoid nigiri except fulfill particular craving  fish to rice ratio good anyway not much rice but very thin fish   Stick hot food maki  If your desire stuff your face nigiri I'd definitely somewhere else   Service very good  Waitress managed keep all drinks topped very friendly  Don't think water ever below half full which often challenge types busy restaurants   Ultimately think Makino those places where if you're into positives offer you'll really it  If aren't going wind suspect value proposition  <EOR> $19 95 all eat sushi crab legs! Makino strictly buffet Makino Chaya where could order charged leftovers  really liked food  smaller but just right opinion  also liked all drink cold green ice tea    I thoroughly enjoyed variety sushi sushi rolls had  love orange pickled burdock root use lot rolls   also ramen udon  even roast beef BBQ ribs which thought unnecessary kind place    Desserts good size nice variety  Overall would definitely again  wish Oahu <EOR> My family love place  Tons sushi ready eaten crab legs family favorite  Great quality pricing  <EOR> Overall very meh experience only very few highlights   Getting unlimited sushi seafood buffet around $17 should flag should temper expectations terms quality    The inside extremely cramped crowded   hard move your table buffet without bumping into other diners  larger back dining room area well but didn't seem using very much   highlight staff very smiley friendly frequently picking used plates refilling drinks   They large selection sushi rolls sashimi well crab legs plus variety hot dishes salads desserts   quality sushi sashimi fair but no means impressive   definitely did taste fresh but OK price point   terms hot dishes    chicken teriyaki dreadful   can't say if white meat dark meat chicken grey color   Yuck   tempura lacked light airiness tempura should instead heavy oily   shrimp inside definitely seemed frozen shrimp   fried rice dry   udon you didn't try though     They some decent desserts including ice cream small cakes   blueberry cake surprisingly good   crème brulee dreadful   top fully caramelized inside lumpy   Yuck again   If temper your expectations terms quality instead focus reasonable price may find Makino acceptable dining experience  <EOR> It's 3 1 2 stars   I don't know why keep coming back Makino since many other all you can eat sushi places Las Vegas   according many reviews sushi places lot more high quality food   Call nostalgia when freshman UNLV eating damn fine treat it first buffets Las Vegas fact don't fuss picking sushi list I just load plate knowing Mr  Makino himself looks cartoon character Cooking Mama game   wielding those knives both hands when he commercial back day damn hilarious!  Makino!  Yeah yeah all 'foodies' knock liking place Makino's   fact don't care   lot so called food hipsters spending your money latest absolute freshest raw fish   But know Japan many high end sushi joints DON'T serve sushi right ocean?  Many sushi chefs say flavor many fish sea heightens sat little while in proper condtions course    put your food knowledge book   Plus me?  enjoy no frills sometimes long gauge expecting   Morimoto?  meal lifetime maybe someday experience   7 11?  Damn well better know may SICK   Makino?  middle of the field player skills cream crop but more enough runs in   solid contributor     There two Makino's Decatur Las Vegas Premium Outlets which reviewed long time ago    prefer Makino Decatur since 1st Las Vegas just think food prepared bit better   Oh yeah plus now serve ramen!  Made order   hey doesn't love BIG @$$ octopus dangling ceiling asking some sashimi?  Nice touch     Yes lot rolls Makino sauce heavy many them remind your typical 'California' roll   Unfortunately less initiated sushi person give them something familiar probably try it   But course front row sushi some gems Ahi Scallop Clam Salmon Mackeral Eel  And few more choices depending catch Makino receives   more simple sushi raw fish rice maybe touch sauce wasabi   eat quite few these   also California hand roll much better regular one well spicy tuna roll   stress usually MUST ASK sushi makers if hand roll   Many times hand rolls won't sushi line   ask sushi maker nicely should receive   If you're getting few hand rolls though nice tip OK?    Another reason Makino because hot foods line   Sometimes really want more just sushi   WTH put damn fried rice theirs??  damn near addicting   also love when sukiyaki line   crack bowl   love much!  Thin slices fatty meat green onions tofu all simmering sweet broth?  Bring on!  admit more share stuff Makino   take noodle bowl udon bar overstuff sukiyaki   Damn fine eats especially winter day   But eat summer well   But only Makino Decatur able enjoy steaming bowl shoyu ramen pork ramen   lately kick Makino   Slurping some noodles some decent broth heavenly   welcome addition   Dessert Makino?  Eh needs some work say   hit miss   ice cream station ending meal some green tea red bean ice cream good palette   Chocolate fountain ok when pineapple SWEET   But those little dessert bites have?  Some good some good   tiramisu cookies cream bites but most desserts aren't very memorable   No biggie though since don't biggest sweet tooth     Price?  bad sushi buffet   Around $18 per person lunch less kids around $28 dinner per person   Dinner adds some extra hot entrees plus crab legs oysters   There's also some more expensive sushi items dinner popular uni when available    dunno but sea urchin still tastes slimy salt me     I've always decent service Makino servers unusually usually women but very courteous very efficient   No problems there   Hit Makino when want some decent sushi no snobby service but no high price either   when can't your damn mind want order those other all you can eat sushi places before your hour up   Pretty oishi! <EOR> Eat sushi ignore rest food  sushi some wonderful varieties great flavored all rice   rest food just fill buffet  <EOR> I'm probably biased Makinos since favorite AYCE sushi joint but man love place   Anytime every time Vegas know count visiting Makino locations sure!  For those read other Makino review located heart LV Fashion Outlets know variety sushi place just terrific!  If compare Makinos likes Todai Onami etc    telling Makino blow water!    So Makino branch Decatur'Flamingo suppose original Makinos set foot Vegas   those don't know Mr  Makino I believe founder Todai    then later when quality par he intended he decided sell chain create Makino Vegas instead keep sushi legacy going   So let's back track sushi part story       What don't want? can't get?  everything here!  6 different types California rolls 10 types fusion rolls 10 types nigiri few other deep fried sushi those loves anything fried    best part Makinos?  menu set changes daily    let imagination creation run wide sushi chefs! numbers approximations but quite vast sure! I can't tell which rolls good but sucker fusion sushi   I'm all into good old traditional styles definitely call biased that! majority them all very tasty! I just skip those cream cheese them because sushi don't taste right cream cheese mind try them all let know which your favorite!    Then those keen sushi there's lot more work with!  They've cold salad selections 5 kinds assorted hot foods choose ranging teriyaki chicken sukiyaki beef deep fried tofu steam fish miso soup beef ribs gyoza fried rice yakisoba steam veggies udon noodle soup clams mussels tempura veggies favorite them all tempura shrimp! shrimps amazing! would worth already if just sit down 50 them!!!  LOL! Lastly let's forget desserts!  decent selection baked goods available but tastier selection almond jello!  rich almond flavor   yum!  course can't forget ice cream parlor!!!  Red Bean ice cream way here!  Just simply delicious if never tried red bean ice cream! They also vanilla chocolate green tea occasionally couple other flavors such strawberry cookies n' cream So those sushi specialists really caring much much would cost 3 tiny plates sushi presented front definitely place you!  However if down good tasty fresh AYCE sushi won't break your bank Makino's highly recommend   does take little drive strip but compared usual buffets Vegas definitely well worth quick sight seeing trip! <EOR> I don't know why mom loves place why anyone loves matter  parents huge AYCE fans almost if think anything  buffet good  why family dinner 4 10 16  other time 10 years ago didn't hence coming back until now  give star dining experience food more star making Asian moms happy   It's off putting once walk door because crowd totally rude  Hey know buffet small space but don't pin against wall plate before can  Jeez aren't going run food!  Speaking food even good! Why many cooked tuna sushi rolls? really gross  raw sushi chewy did seem fresh  loaded sushi first plate decided stick crab legs after  Unfortunately also did enjoy crab legs  meat stuck shell almost every crab leg had  possible overcooked  also disliked chicken skewers but fried rice chow mein fine consistent you'll find elsewhere  then dessert! even serving here!?

So if feel escaping strip eating affordable asian buffet would suggest Makino  mean seriously   All eat sushi good price? yes please! <EOR> Normally words sushi  buffet together want run bathroom hurl   case Makino   eaten few times past few months quality food excellent   The sushi always very fresh   best soy sauce   add some crushed red peppers gives just little kick   All hot food gourmet quality   haven't tried desserts but look great   best sushi buffet restaurants Las Vegas if western USA  <EOR> Very good sushi price range  put more fish sushis ever seen  Very authentic Japanese restaurant very attentive service  don't sashimi lunch time though but good enough! <EOR> Thought food ok nothing special  Kinda Todai  your rolls sashimi Chinese food soups alittle seafood crab legs clams   Would think price would 9 10 dollars cheaper but Vegas  <EOR> I admit pretty much look down restaurants off strip hotels because don't know bad possibly could strip  guess being tourist kind ignorant places sometimes    Makino located typical town center see anywhere doesn't look standout ish would've never guessed good place was    Once walked Makino staff made feel ease very welcoming  Walking buffet heaven  wonder 'Wow all sushi only $25?!' EVERYTHING spicy tuna eel rolls california etc  many la carte ones well! only problem sushi rice isn't kept tight  If poked lightly roll rice fall apart easily   They even chocolate fountain thank God someone finally answered prayers! miso soup machine  Pretty awesome!

Granted still don't Asian buffets overall  But would say Makino probably prized gem all Oriental Buffets Las Vegas  at same time experience food encountered average   Ambiance 3 oriental buffet most which small  Makino presents pretty large spacious serving area seating space  Though seats bit overcrowded hard walking through aisles when place full!   Inside pretty casual  I mean buffet all!   Service 4 service received quick responsive  server attentive patient rather rowdy family hah! She always take away plates bring more water  table always pretty clean! She deserves gold star!!   Food 3 only food thats worth eating Makino clearly seafood  Though might best if you're still pretty good! sushi obviously way better fresher places fish  personally recommend but few rolls worth try if happen find yourself Makino!   What recommend eating crab legs oysters raw   Naturally everyone for!! don't disappoint  especially consider king sized cups butter crab dipping! just crab legs oysters  Hell good night because  all needed!

Update  downgraded 3 stars   last time good  sushi messy hot food refreshed quickly   busier last time maybe trouble keeping up  <EOR> My family somewhat likes place come quite often when visit Las Vegas   For supposedly sushi sashimi oriented place sushi sashimi same worse buy good Japanese supermarket   As hot food some wasn't very hot all  picked some fried oysters just put nearly gagged when ate because room temperature just soggy piece grease   The tempura shrimp always good though crab legs well   Now biggest gripe green tea ice cream  Yes good problem four times they've run twice  also pretty sure intentionally don't bring more back intentionally don't order enough satisfy demand  If keep being cheap greedy don't anticipate coming back  <EOR> Amazing service fresh sushi all time  All eat fills up! Amazing food people don't enjoy sushi people love sushi  100% recommend  dessert also amazing! <EOR> Just came fantastic all you can eat sushi bar second time   The assortment  sushi chichi other appetizers outstanding  Everything fresh well presented   fun being Las Vegas having rush Boulevard  <EOR> It gets job done terms having nice selection  Some items better others  don't think coming when think buffet sushi but family enjoyed it    Wait staff attentive which appreciated since don't usually see buffet  Ample parking far strip   I would again if invited  personal preference LOVE PAPAYA some available delicious! <EOR> yes good place  lots choices  fast alot room sit <EOR> It's always became traditional brunch family Makino mostly every month now  buffet parents favorite spot sushi would never try anything else  lunch price buffets $19 95 per person  sushi bar where your own wraps sushi ramen bar  mention dessert section your own shave ice    The food serve isn't your typical asian buffet but really good authentic asian food serve  favorite shrimp tempura  sushi pretty fresh sushi rolls pretty much all taste same but complaining  Really your money's worth but place mostly family gathering rather date scenery  going since open because parents favorite  <EOR> My family used frequent Makino Premium Outlet Mall Charleston looong time ago  stopped going mainly because just expensive  Recently dad decided give place try fell love all over again   Don't come great expectations because guarantee lead just disappointment  Come Makino without any expectations all just did haha!  The overall restaurant kind cramped  smaller compared Premium  big thumbs down me   Service They're okay  Some servers resting b!tch face  just come refill your drinks take your food away  probably really picky but having servers who'll actually say excuse while taking your food don't know   People who'll actually smile?    Food There's lot choose here  lot different kind rolls nigiri  If come dinner serve oysters crab legs amaebi sweet shrimp nigiri sashimi! also shrimp tempura udon seaweed salad etc  personally love food selections because don't limit amaebi nigiri  much want  can't find unlimited sashimi AYCE sushi restaurant    Price dinner price comparable AYCE sushi places town around $27     Personally find worth every penny  don't wait server take your order don't wait your sushi rolls come your table  just take piece roll looks appetizing before getting more pieces  No more ordering half rolls full rolls  btw don't charge extra leftovers <EOR> Didn't know ramen along wide selections tasty food! sushi just delish! come back sure  <EOR> So some sort sushi connoisseur basically going off well tasted good review   Went 07 31 14 Brian P  coworker  left probably most painful food coma life  Why? Ceviche! absolutely delicious! multiple servings tasty   Personally much prefer buffet style regular AYCE places because try single piece lot stuff rather whole roll  tried piece just tentacle something square rice  No idea animal  tentacle orignated but okay  No real flavor luckily texture imagined   I tried hand roll first time heavy rice raw enoki mushrooms strangely overpowering  Luckily unlike AYCE places long you're visibly wasting vast quantities food peeling off some rice leaving some things don't your plate won't result extra charge your bill   I enjoyed pretty much everything tried which three plates worth food  Desserts really good especially coffee jello tasted huapia  <EOR> Best place ever b day awesome everything fresh delicious hope more time awesome service mall family thanks!!! <EOR> Love everything place  Awesome sushi all fresh food very tasty ramen  definitely recommend place  <EOR> The nigiri ok typical selections did something different beef nigiri saba good yellowtail also  tuna sashimi all right   tonkatsu soup good usual  hot food very salty alot items   haven't year probably won't back another year  better place sushi but wife place eat sushi mainly its soup  <EOR> Wow LOVE place!  I'd heard lots good things place meaning try but never around it   But just back lunch family selection amazing!  good quality too!  much rice lots fresh fish great dessert selection   Kids loved chocolate fondue!  only wish left some room try more dessert but all other stuff completely tapped out   Friendly staff great value   totally come again whenever town   know come think most Vegas buffet totally outrageously priced now   EASILY spend $40 $50 per person other places   Compared Makino still only half price way better quality when comes Japanese sushi seafood category   Especially kids tow could add pretty good savings  <EOR> This Kind Place! Everything Fresh Tasty! Selections unique Just die for! <EOR> Amazingly fresh huge variety great service! Line forms outside 15 30 minutes before opening time just heads up!  My family arrived 11 am doors open 11 30am  5 groups before already line  Servers quick getting everyone taking drinks down  Food already prepared ready everyone  Everything tastes very fresh no complaints all food  section sushi section cooked foods like ramen fried rice tempura etc  then section dessert  Servers came refill drinks very frequently surprised top game despite busy is!   I recommended try place friend disappointed  <EOR> Good quantity sushi selections  Just  typical  sushi  NO special sushi though   husband said ask your own roll  Food good desserts ok  Didn't expect much compared buffets strip  ramen good kind ramen ramen places but good  server  nice she kept refilling hot tea soda  paid 19 99 per person   Worth it  <EOR> I really craving sushi while bf craving hot food items came across here  win win situation?   We arrived hour half before closing wait wasn't long all  seated right away   Customer service good  All employees really friendly nice  server said medium size sake good size bf wrong    since drink while eating   wanted large but she recommended medium    anyways food      Sushi 2 5  I'm fan nigiri  wide range nigiris rolls even hand rolls made order! But review nigiri only    quality ok  freshest best sushi ever but buffet  Can't expect much    haven't tried other sushi items can't say much it   Hot food items 4 5 5 They lots hot food items  made order ramen tempura roast beef more  selection big! liked pretty much everything  food didn't taste bland all  winner course snow crab legs!!!   Dessert 5 5 They also wide range different cakes also ice cream chocolate fountain! Way makino!!  I recommend place if big appetite but don't know you're craving want bit everything  would stay away sushi     but everything else instead! Might coming back stuff face more crab legs!! YUMMM <EOR> I still can't believe Makino's first time ever back September just recently back Black Friday   The first time came honestly NO idea Makino's was  only buffets ever usually ones serve while assortment food but primarily focuses Japanese food  only imagine excitement when first walked saw incredible display sushi especially favorite salmon nigiri  If dinner catch crab legs however quality them mediocre best   Besides sushi Makino's yakisoba chicken teriyaki ramen miso soup salad mussels shrimp tempura more  dessert selection okay  chocolate fondue foundation if chocolate your thing then knock yourself out  cream puffs okay but feel could TAD bit sweeter   lot say because don't really sweets much  love green tea ice cream  feel can't wrong green tea ice cream   All all big fan buffets anymore  However if am being treated treating someone else loves buffets  far cheapest yet better quality option even if dinner menu because crab legs  If you're looking good quality crab legs then might want look somewhere else  <EOR> Makino's good sushi buffet  lot people know place come often  heard some people complain sick eating but havn't problem  oysters crab everything  large variety rolls sushi sashimi's  rolls big your average buffet rolls    wish uni but don't  good selection hot Japanese food well   also chocolate fountain full icecream bar  place pretty decent worth trying going back  <EOR> Very popular place  variety sushi Japanese  friend loved even though she never liked eating raw fish before  all enjoy food price $30 per person bad either  <EOR> Food great even better Irvine opinion  Seating little tight  <EOR> Came extended family tonight dinner  Based abundance uni sashimi snow crab legs vast assortment other sashimi sushi items everything great price charged!  My wife says definitely more worth eating casino buffets  only eat cheap cooked goods but dessert selection wonderful  younger daughter true connoisseur desserts said she never encountered wide selection ice cream choices available Makino! <EOR> We usually outlets day shopping but found they've closed down! Thankfully Yelp pointed location   The wait lunch bad 20 minute wait given amount people there  Unfortunately no waiting room inside location standing cold bit  provide small heater near door but wasn't enough keep crowd people warm  didn't mind though more hungry cold    There's nice variety food choose bunch different sushi try! very fond different types sushi some labels would've nice sushi noobs myself  But every tried delicious didn't mind  usually don't noodles fried rice buffets but different distinct taste when compared your average Asian restaurant definitely worth trying! udon quite tasty well  tempura quick definitely while fresh! dessert selection great even some ice cream cone go!  Overall great place eat well worth wait  definitely back whenever town! <EOR> We came last day   just leave town when friend also drove told come here   Apparently he's coming ten years trusted him   I usually skip buffets [although there's all u can eat Korean BBQ  die Chinatown!] since don't eat money's worth but no problem here   Everything fresh refreshing   glad came lunch   Every time another plate [only three plates] would new item   quite exciting!  On way grabbed second ice cream cone   first green tea   second red bean   All milk lamp way home!  I definitely come again   all think other friend wants wedding reception here! <EOR> They such wide selection  husband loved it  nephew also enjoyed selection  tempura shrimp beef pork some tender delicious ribs wide variety sushi cooked raw  sashimi salad yummy! def back place  <EOR> We party 10 2 kids walked soon doors open @ 5 30pm ready some fresh sushi oysters crab legs shrimp fresh cooked food great selection   @ 25 95 pop dinner price down heighth kids12 yrs younger 5ft shorter prices on  Senior citizens discount too  Anyhow food really good sushi bar 16 different types creative sushi all made fresh ingredients fresh oysters crab legs salads made food section buffet offered 10 different made dishes ranging fried tempura chicken mushrooms but only ate baked prawns seafood melody sauce which point flavors   Last never made dessert tapped 3 rounds but dessert section filled fruit sweet goodies ice cream    The servers very good fast taking plates away keeping drinks filled  buffett west side strip but worth drive real good seafood sushi japanese cooked food buffet  experience fulfilling fun  buffet worth coming to  <EOR> I came when opening time thought hey may great! But when tried sushi wasn't fresh  believed already prepared hours before its open but some rolls pretty good  also lots different rolls sashimi nigiri  serve hot food well  bit pricy but lot different things  crab legs short ribs ramen station desserts chocolate fountain  better sushi buffet but wasn't bad  <EOR> 18 95$ lunch setting tight food good outlet which closed forever   Parking space easy find but overall value still better any other buffet LV  <EOR> I've fair share sushi restaurants all over country   also many sushi style restaurants Vegas  friend mine lives area took Makino lunch  Now buffet style which usually turns off  However best forum trying number different selections  fish incredibly fresh rice cooked perfectly   also number other selections non sushi eaters well  really wanted try scratch made spicy ramen soup but full! Best all price  $16 95    least expensive meal while Vegas probably favorite  <EOR> Chinese people love buffets Coach bags more anything    This place lots tuna salmon  variety isn't Golden Corral but its unique sushi buffet opposed All Eat Sushi Restaurant  number different rolls some sashimi shrimp eel salmon tuna   But rolls aren't particularly appetizing more done  didn't feel eating roll twice  didn't see any baked rolls either  price can't really complain  Tip If wanna eat just tuna salmon poke  more flavorful    The other food surprisingly appetizing  snow crab legs pork ribs good  green tea strawberry ice cream  I'd recommend avoiding green tea snow cones since give entire bowl ice snow cone    It sounds hating place lot but $20 infinite crab legs worth itself  sushi desserts just icing cake  <EOR> For buffet pretty good  taste fresh food see employees some fresh order  $28 95 adult Thursday night think  good deal given mainly seafood all you can eat  only very few items disliked  would come again recommend it   PROS + Sushi above average good + Other Seafood Shrimp Tempura Prawns + Dessert bomb especially green tea ice cream + Free parking plaza + Friendly service Attentive   CONS × May higher risk cross contamination because leave tongs 1 3 different food items  × Seating kinda terrible but buffet  tables cramped together people sitting chairs doesn't help  You're bound run into couple people  <EOR> To honest if could give place less star totally would  When walked wait snaked all way front desk restroom  Normally you'd put your name wait until your name called however place gives numbers instead  Therefore people standing line aimlessly  waited hour then finally seated   The food sub par much variety  looked sitting plate long time  Throughout time restaurant only saw plate being changed sushi buffet  non sushi food also pretty bad  crowding restaurant only added negatives    ALSO dead fly green tea ice cream  REPEAT FLY ICE CREAM  EW    TL DR worth price bugs restaurant crowded don't do  <EOR> Although time didn't eat crablegs full share sashimi  Soon good  Actually ate other stuff  Caesar salad really good  julienned carrots thinly sliced apple  Really good  Suggestion sliced sashimi slice little thinner more daikon along sides dish  <EOR> I am really caught between  3 4 stars place miss downtown location place doesn't seem selection layout other did  However lacked selection made terms service  Generally buffet style establishments never see your server other then bill original drink order  staff though top all  Drinks promptly refilled plates cleared every time up    While usually stay away sushi kinds places trust during lunch time when really busy turn over quite bit when first open its fresh  Many usual standby still present but did miss tempura selection other location used offer  Overall though still solid place  <EOR> Quick tips 1  Located very busy strip mall Decatur Flamingo! might park bit far one   2  request hand rolls made order sushi chefs!  3  request your ramen spicy!  As promised part post Vegas binge series reviews  shame haven't ever reviewed place considering old favorite family quite few years now  Since first time wowed place lot really changed except own personal tastes   The service fast friendly efficient  Normally family comes very early little no wait time between getting being seated  However noticed if more towards prime time dining should expect wait quite awhile in   As rest staff haven't really many problems waiters waitresses sushi chefs other cooks  Most requests met certainty waitress comes often enough tables pretty clean never really full dishes   The food divided into hot food sushi  just dinner last month review dinner sushi  dinner offer nigiri well cuts sashimi  noticed quite bit rice stuffed under fish but least raw cuts nice fresh  far favorite mine salmon skin nigiri accompanying rolls    As your way around sushi area you'll notice many various types rolls  tried most them except deep fried ones because seemed heart attack waiting happen  Anyways rolls considered common rice vegetables questionable types fish covered some thick sauce  Overall rolls fine though filled bit much rice   One things always enjoy handrolls  premake handrolls leave them grab your own however if special request different type fish always ask them custom hand roll   For hot food various normal types things would see Japanese buffet such chicken teriyaki fried rice calamari salt pepper shrimp like  also put shrimp tempura veggie tempura delightful ramen station made order  suggest trying spicy tonkatsu ramen! also serve udon around corner well Korean style galbi short ribs   For dessert pretty big selection cakes ice cream frozen yogurt well chocolate fountain  When however chocolate fountain looked wasn't smooth other places  fact making chocolate fountain home sworn off using them  because massive amount oil into making chocolate run smoothly  wasn't really impressed desserts because cakes pastries cookies all run mill offerings would expect any Chinese Japanese buffet   Overall still favorite spots stop because food affordable insanely priced most rest strip  hope chance check Makinos soon! <EOR> GREAT Sushi pay  For amount sushi variety buffet its extremely great value  $22 dinner 15 lunch think  The sushi may best cuts but fresh tasty  Great spot group people family  Lots people but plenty seats  <EOR> Great selection   People nice  wife said foods aside sushi very authentic tasty  Sushi fresh large pieces fish  Much more selection rolls sushi  HUGE selection rolls  Only negative overall restaurant could cleaner  <EOR> This place almost perfect  only complaint waiting 30 minutes lots other people when closed third seating area  Why when middle your busiest time? But food just good giving them extra stars  why 4 stars  back when come back Vegas <EOR> I enjoyed glass noodles maybe sashimi but mostly creme brûlée   I idea sushi buffet Asian buffet all one  Sunday night quite busy but digress say most food salty didn't enjoy myself   opinion think Makinos overpriced opposed quality food daughter 2 never touched food but unfortunately because height she's tall girl father tall man pay her   I've location 3 different times unfortunately all experiences unsatisfactory   However Las Vegas Outlet location pretty tasty  think hit miss  <EOR> We came 114 degree day   much waiting area lot people waiting right front area   big place but many variety food   many different variety sushi   also made order ramen udon   constantly pick your finished plates won't stack plates your table   Drinks included  <EOR> Based last only experience place bomb! array freshly made sushi's   even hot stir fry items green tea ice cream chocolate fountains! would back! <EOR> This place great!!!
