I work just few blocks away Johnny Rockets never before Husband picked today lunchtime lunch  literally sat down less 20 seconds didn't even purse off shoulder before server hounding drink order  Having never quickly glance menu which listed Pepsi products ordered pepsi  She then tells only Coke products  ?? Coke fine   She returns minute later ready take lunch order proceeds explain Manager's special The Original    Again 1st time order special she asks if would everything burger   Everything BUT mustard tell her  Husband orders patty melt   Food arrived literally mustard soaked burger   tell manager apologizes although feeling sincerity but rather obligation offers another burger   But explain am lunch break enough time wait another burger prepared eat travel back work   server also then comes over apologizes   Fine   ate less 40% burger least amount mustard it   much literally rings fingers yellow no joke!  Then bill arrives couldn't believe no offer discount whatsoever   poor first and last trip Johnny Rockets   Ugh! <EOR> Gegenüber dem Hard Rock Hotel gelegen ist Johnny Rockets eine super Empfehlung für den typisch amerikanischen Snack zwischen den vielen Casinobesuchen  1986 eröffnete Los Angeles das erste Johnny Rockets  Seitdem begann eine beispiellose Erfolgsgeschichte  Mittlerweile gibt es Johnny Rockets Restaurants über 20 Bundesstaaten  Allein Las Vegas sind es momentan 8 Filialen  Jedes Restaurant ist im Diner Style eingerichtet Rot Chrome und typische Accessoires eines All American Restaurants  Auf jedem Tisch steht eine kleine Jukebox  Die Karte hält alle Sünden bereit Hamburgers Sandwiches Chili Fries Shakes Malts Brownies Sundaes etc  <EOR> Came Australian friend ran into wanted whole American diner thing boy fun   Very warm welcome Brit Aussie instantly hit off staff laugh   Food superb LOVED chilli cheese fries very hard find over actually enjoy  Chicken Philly cheese steak great really well prepared quickly delivered  Prices fantastic service efficient friendly  I'd love come again lunch  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  extremely short staffed food terrible  broom dust pan sitting table dead silent no music ambiance restaurant    My sons grill cheese hard rock send back he couldn't even bite into it  frozen fry chili cheese fries never brought second order fries  Also restaurant cold contemplated leaving before food finished    My sons meal came drink upgraded shake which she charged full price since sent back food  ended just paying just wanted leave  EAT HERE  <EOR> We Memorial weekend lunch pretty empty  that should said enough   staff young increadibly inexperienced spoke very broken english made feel burden  am usually cool cucumber when comes restaurants staff but something really off location  If manager did show  root beer orange crush just stuck water  4 6 glasses filthy asking if could new ones immed  treated thought royalty  few minutes later look directly cook  Thats when asked fam if would rather walk across street Hard Rock  Needless say maybe staff location should lunch HR cafe see things should be  really try leave negative reviews but Johnny no deserves two  <EOR> I'm surprised read all negative comments star rating place   couple friends around area wanted grab quick bite before explore hard rock! Our first impressions when walked place really  clean jukeboxes playing 50's music  I ordered regular hamburger well Oreo shake which recommended server  Our food arrived five minutes wow your average hamburger!!!!! It delicious! shake thick well worth money   only wished hamburgers would come fries all separate but considering yummy everything tasted doesn't matter!  manager fact person served food she very nice Russian accent   She nice enough even split checks 3 ways receipt told forgot mention separate receipts  If am ever around area would def come back  <EOR> I sometimes switch burger selection n going Johnny Rockets  nostalgia 50's dinner always cool atmosphere burgers shakes  typically bacon cheese burger which comes always cooked temperature  Occasionally fries onion rings just average due abundance grease over cooked but shakes it  three star more three half  <EOR> Went Sunday 5 waited while  wasn't busy but tourist location needs TWO servers! Only server doing 4 tables counter  happened quality customer service full staff  Hey Johnny! your homework! Backup staff Location knowledge equals succsess! <EOR> overcharged bill  the food however pretty good but better places just good food elsewhere Vegas   No wonder place always empty  <EOR> i paradise harmon  Servers really inexperienced stupid  sister asked if split check said yes course  charged sister correctly but charged twice  didnt even guts let know mistake  until home checked bank statement said Johnny Rockets twice!  I hate when people mess money Im never coming back place    But food its ok bit messy tho  Servers completely trained well   And leaving nobody even said thank goodbye anything  Shouldnt given them tip  place joke  <EOR> After staying HRH multiple times seeing place across street decided lunch instead eating hotel   refreshing walk here   When seated ourselves server came over made feel welcome home though hundreds miles away home   enjoyed being 1950's diner vibe because those better days food service compared more corporate feel today   So when came time placing order friend each Rocket Doubles side onion rings share bowl chili myself   first thought didn't order enough food then showed began eating it   Toward end meal realized definitely lot food really hungry when showed up   barely finished burgers then last onion rings which then left bursting seams   Overall food really good something different offerings HRH   think total came $30 tip wasn't expensive compared would most hotels   Anyways definitely coming back! <EOR> Service awful  burger arrived 10 minutes before fries  Shake never made meal  good experience  <EOR> We gave them another try  time 9pm dessert  wanted play some music requested some change told juke box system does work  guy tell just run Pandora list some crappy old music it  friend asked still dance told No don't dance franchise real Johnny Rockets  <EOR> Food good but la carte no fries those burgers  Also if UNLV no longer take Rebel Cash  Milkshakes good thick  <EOR> The Manager's Special catches anybody eyes budget  $6 bucks burger fries  Drink separate!!! prices    I am sure if fries refillable    want more fries just ask!!! The service slow considering n o restaurant  <EOR> First off never food can't say if  any good    Walked waited 5 minutes before just sitting down table no greated us  Another 5 10 minutes before menus showed up  Waited another 15 minutes server realized people waiting when still waiting someone take order   Got left  Half hour without even talking someone  <EOR> We came vegiburger  it best found yet LV  Sure its bocaburger tm nothing special but made care grill put big bun all toppings  tastes great its much better could done home  One tasty vegiburger fries orange soda happy girl! <EOR> I always enjoyed old malt shop feel themed burger restaurants  Ruby's Fatburger although themed Johnny Rockets  first last more restaurants then fast food however    I recently visited Johnny Rocket's across street Hard Rock Hotel always thoroughly enjoyed time  However some posters stated pay premium atmosphere  quick cheap burger McDonald's but more experience  Something may only once every two months    The woman helped kind courteous wish could remember name  She quick attentive top game when came refilling drink  last eatery Chicken Club Sandwich 1 2 1 2 fries onion rings  Splitting rings fries great but sometimes wish more rings maybe next time rings alone    I also noticed some new menu items at least new   items cobb salad see big seller if people aren't interesting eating red meat or turkey burgers     Overall good experience Johnny Rocket's continue future  <EOR> Best burgers fries!  Love ambience servers course shakes!  first time took 7 year old daughter she loved sitting counter    bit spendy burger joint but all around good food  <EOR> Yelp 365 Challenge Review 013 365 8 13 2011 My friend reallyreallyreally wanted check UNDFTD during last trip   Since lunch time time walked just few feet away Johnny Rockets located same strip mall   It first time eating here   If recall correctly only customers but waiter polite efficient during entire meal   ordered Coke chocolate flavor shot tuna melt sandwich I don't eat hamburgers    Coke interesting concept but chocolate only obvious to both friend I aftertaste   tuna melt edible but extremely small   also tried onion rings french fries combo friend ordered   Both them decent   On completely different note and no fault any employees 50s music started drive crazy halfway through meal   end visit though seeing pretty cheap tab needed pay for both us more made any audial dislike experienced just short while before   Three stars JR definitely favorite fast food LV but definitely worst  <EOR> Came into Johnny Rockets first time other night   Sad say but last time come here  boyfriend ordered smokehouse double beef patty no taste whatsoever  Completely bland if cook did season salt it  ordered bbq chicken melt bacon cheese fries quite frankly tasted plain boring   if could've concocted something better home   Needless say shakes best thing  Ordered strawberry Oreo crumble just right consistency Oreo chunks weren't big small sweetness strawberries just right   If anything only back order deluxe shakes   famous burgers   <EOR> Not Good    BAD    Stay away!!  I never Johnny Rockets before  group 10 stopped Saturday afternoon when only 4 other tables occupied   Most drinks came wrong    Even waters wrong people  Milk shakes served dirty glasses  food ordering disorganized  Then food came some 10 minutes later others 35 minutes later  Many orders wrong   One person ordered No Onions   burger onions  She asked another no onions    scrapped them off gave back her    could smell it    honestly insulting   I really assumed national chain located across street major resort would some standards and or some self respect but no    really just did care anything presented   My chicken club featured pathetic piece meat charred bacon flavorless tomatoes  sandwich around $8 included no side no even pickle   Not vulgar but bathroom right leaving    something sandwich no clean very natural   I would return if offered free meal  bad  Maybe should close good place open otherwise decent shopping center  <EOR> Upset say but part childhood spoiled tonight  kid growing Johnny Rockets favorite place to  always loved hotdogs burgers shakes chili cheese fries!!!

Went doing some miniature golfing seated waitress promptly took drink shake orders  She came back awhile later asked wanted eat all while asking again shake drink orders were   She then brought shake orders every 5 minutes but any rhyme reason  She took sniffing every milk shake see which which still giving wrong ones  which little scary cause someone allergic bananas friends ordered chocolate banana shake     One glasses food inside asked remade but pretty sure just dumped shake cup added new whip cream top    Then came orders     fries came before actual entrees people getting wrong burgers  Some didn't even burgers waited hour  only two other tables taken hardly anyone   brought order onions which said can't have sent back  brought back exact same burger! All did take onions off! Seriously? can't remake things right?   By point enough sent back three burgers cause wrong two people still hadn't gotten food    On top just dumb staff didn't know doing  wish things could gone better could liked food but all really doubt even give johnny rockets second glance  <EOR>
