The novel fusion specialties definitely worth 10 minute drive Strip  If lived Vegas would definitely inclined try whole menu Trattoria Nakamura Ya P <EOR> So impressed  5 star quality beautiful atmosphere unbelievable taste  worth experience  Hands down best food ever life  <EOR> Been coming long time  Love place concept Italian Japanese food  Service always good fast    Before place never any kind uni life  first time uni pasta  feel $27 pasta expensive but delicious worth every bite!

The dish itself looked very interesting since pretty much pitch black not something see everyday!   terms taste ink contributes slight bitter aftertaste but very mild  kind disappointed since tasted regular pasta use good amount oil see taste well  price charge squid ink pasta worth trying dish but if friend decides order ahead just try bite  novelty wears off pretty fast actually didn't finish dish because ink does stain your lips teeth  unless super comfortable people eating would avoid dish i e  first date lol     I also ordered garlic bread which number 4 popular menu list dish pretty good  would recommend ordering but warned lot garlic bread soaked oil  Kind disappointed price pay order doesn't really reflect quality quantity   My friend ordered pasta uni which number item but he didn't really seem it  bite just really creamy didn't really taste much uni  Let's just say glad squid ink pasta over uni lol    I also try 3 dessert sampler enjoyed 2 3 items gave  didn't green jello looking which assume supposed taste green tea  tasted bitter mix green tea coffee weird aftertaste  friends described stale ube she's apparently before lol! would recommend ordering item    Overall would recommend place those want try fusion place but work dishes bit  Just don't come high expectations did maybe better experience  wait staff very attentive friendly made experience really nice  kept checking refilled drinks without having call them over  <EOR> Fusion places become increasing popular Las Vegas  When heard new Japanese Italian fusion restaurant curious check out    The restaurant located same shopping center Raku Monta Noodle Big Wong great company  small nine tables bar  ambiance simple modern   I ordered ginger ale wasn't regular stuff buy supermarket  Fever Tree Ginger Ale good!   The buns provide appetizer fresh warm delicious  I didn't chance take note proper names menu items pardon if don't names correct  started off Jidori Chicken which translates organic chicken per waitress  good but memorable    My husband ordered Miso Carbonara $13 95 he enjoyed it  ordered Fettucini Baby Scallops Tarako ? sauce $18 95   Again apologize if names wrong  really enjoyed dish  pasta cooked perfectly scallops sauce indescribable  really tasted Italian Japanese influence dish   For dessert shared Tiramisu  good sweet but wasn't best Tiramisu ever had   I would give service 5 stars because waitresses very sweet attentive  wonderful explaining menu items glasses never empty kept table clean   I would suggest sign e mail distribution because change pasta menu every few weeks  can't wait see else offer! <EOR> Another gem same plaza Monta Ramen Snowflake Sweets Raku Curry Zen?

Even when more customers came little busier getting checks paying done quickly efficiently    The pricing little questionable when comparing individual items menu another  friend's Linguini Jidori Chicken ended costing $8 when Jidori Chicken Kinkoku sauce no rice included cost $15  could because Linguini hardly any chicken but  really good thing either    Overall restaurant offers good food splendid customer service  could easily 5 star place if pricing more consistent  <EOR> After Jabbawockeez small group yelpers decided Trattoria Tony made reservation 8 people    Earl just going head home since work night   walking Luxor but stopped say bye Teri Reggie when sold joining Uni Pasta Trattoria half usual price due 2nd anniversary celebration   Teri Reggie told same thing Tony Nelson already told earlier but T R quantify it   the usual uni pasta 26 bucks but tonight 13 50   course logic kicks quickly told Earl Let's go  When arrived people wanted table   Wow am glad Tony made reservation   Those people then ordered food quicker did   But  alright taste food right when comes out   Earl ordered uni pasta squid ink pasta   killed uni pasta within matter minutes looked over right Tony inhaled way ahead us   Then came squid ink pasta   good but uni pasta good   overshadowed squid ink pasta   While Earl shared both dishes Teri Reggie each Uni Pasta shared Squid Ink pasta   Nelson consumed both uni pasta squid ink pasta  Tony T consumed 2 bowls uni pasta   Sylvia loved uni pasta but didn't eat very much saving rest following day unless Nelson decides eat midnight snack    Moral story try uni pasta sure where room give squid ink pasta go  <EOR> We thought would interesting place try because Italian Japanese fusion aspect!

All say squid ink Uni tomato cream  Just follow board can't lose    Tiramisu wasn't anything special  <EOR> What random lucky happenstance!  husband randomly saw place plaza getting milk tea   Japanese   and Italian   foreign concept   We decided return next day during happy hour try heard great happy hour   As starving decided order Uni Tomato Cream off regular menu some appetizers happy hour menu   3 types Brucetta fried oysters     Everything delicious!  Very memorable unique   If more stomach space would definitely try squid ink pasta   wish more Uni pasta dish     The fried oysters point!  happy hour prix fixe great deal if chance try instead   But more selective pasta selections really wanted try Uni dish   I would return next time back Vegas  <EOR> Love tiramisu!  I'm big fan place Japanese inspired pasta dishes just fantastic  especially enjoy mushroom meat cream sauce  <EOR> I love place    lots reasons!  First food phenomenally inventive high quality   rarely eat Italian since option just seems played most places  here!  flavor combinations really pop   admit would never thought Japanese Italian would work but now am wondering why only seems one?  Service always great   Its only ten tables but always felt attended without overwhelming intrusiveness some places substitute 'great service'!  Trattoria realizes sometimes less more   Another reason?  Perhaps due small place relatively plain interior seems really intimate   simple look feel allows focus food company     Lastly?  price   cheap   But quality both ingredients execution?  place culinary bargain!  Almost hate let others know case getting reservation gets difficult    but really need place stay open     Give Trattoria Nakamura Ya try your stomach friends thank you! <EOR> High expectations place based reviews  Although service nice  all food food bad  ordered cabanara which watery sauce noodles really under cooked took bill  wife ordered linguine creamy sauce but watery  Fried oysters good   overall didn't meet expectations  <EOR> Didn't think Trattoria could impress more already did  but did prove wrong! Coming back several weeks later glad quality in both service food remained high    Consistent great service which especially hard find Spring Mountain  server very attentive all tables very quick efficient all requests  But differentiates service Trattoria continuously act manner delight surprise guests  asked lemons squeeze into water cups surprise she would bring small plate extra lemon slices every time new glass water  small gesture but VERY impressed   Was able try several different dishes time around Italian Spring Roll Basically antipasti plate egg roll  tasted WAY better looked because thought going taste fried but wasn't! Plus cheese prosciutto ratio point   Fried Jidori Chicken Upgraded popcorn chicken  way appetizer described seem only couple pieces chicken but actually pretty decent sized bowl salad fried chicken cherry tomatoes vinaigrette!  Spaghetti Manila Clam Asparagus PERSONAL NEW FAVE  Thought nothing could surpass love Linguini Clam Shinso White Wine Sauce but Garlic Anchovy Cream Sauce just hits spot!  Overall great if best fusion restaurant book! Highly recommended!!!!!! <EOR> Love Japanese style Italian good expected! Loved Uni pasta even didn't know price quiet high $29   took off 1 star based price lol  Went back another friend still enjoyed <EOR> Loved it     Had beef carpaccio roasted vegetables bagna cauda most favorite Italian dishes which rarely see menu    Also tried jidori chicken appetizer    sadly 3pm Cafe's chicken better    but place service style work ethic heart vibe 3pm never achieve   bless hearts      We shared tomato uni pasta  could died gone heaven     Wine prices incredibly reasonable    Don't byo   it's problem them   problem me     Dessert she raced down street around corner candle put because friend insisted only ok    panna cotta balsamic glaze berries    stiff    that's she said    Anyway same folks operate Kabuki off Maryland Parkway Flamingo  knew?   near office   if they're doing any dishes near office I'd love it     Lots more try menu can't wait back     Show them some love    Max Jacobson's review says don't call them fusion   and I'd wholeheartedly agree that    some best Italian food town   accented when appropriate traditional Japanese ingredients   Super high quality brilliantly executed    <EOR> This would second visit here  first time impressed carbonara    For second visit ordered plethora food taste   3 way mussels interesting since presented escargot dish prepared three styles  variety flavors favorite butter parsley  did 2 small mussels would preferred large mussel    Uni Tomato Cream Pasta Uni enough  tell uni some pieces pasta but taste strong enough  could only tell some uni taste left mouth  Maybe sauce creamy? tomato more accent flavor    Kurobuta Tonkatsu sat tomato sauce which made Italian  tomato sauce did bring anything dish rather texture color  tonkatsu itself great because lightly battered pork tasted thin layers juicy pork     Soft Shell Crab balsamic fried light  thought balsamic would overpower crab but didn't  vinegar added small tart taste which brought fried fresh crabby flavor   Salad also ordered salad round dishes add some greens  straight forward good but memorable enough describe more detail    I know suppose specialize pasta Japanese Italian style but don't buy it  would only come back appetizers try desserts  <EOR> Happy Anniversary better fusion concepts around town!

Walking inside fully Japanese staff greeting door wonder am really Vegas? Does Vegas places this? ambiance decor definitely lean towards Italian restaurant but can't deny Japanese influence chefs being visible behind counter like sushi bar! unmistakably non Italian ingredients incorporated into appetizers entrees pastas   My favorite example meeting two cuisines when ordered specials branzino  waitress asked would prepared carpaccio more Italian style sashimi more Japanese style  really liked flexible versatile chefs able offer both options    We ended going branzino sashimi addition ordering garlic bread kurobuta shabu shabu salad miso carbonara eggplant linguini kurobuta tonkatsu  shared family style three entrees two appetizers two orders garlic bread plus regular bread! enough reasonably fill 5 people   All dishes came fairly quickly everything flavorful! Japanese Italian aspects all dishes came together very well  Especially creative delicious kurobuta tonkatsu which tonkatsu cutlet but mozzarella cheese inside um say amazing!? miso carbanara eggplant linguini good boyfriend mentioned he probably could've downed whole pasta entree himself   One only minor things didn't catch salad orders left wondering if ever going come out  featured wine day also bit bland particularly worth extra cost  However overall visit positive staff welcoming friendly prices exorbitant would come back again try uni squid ink pastas known and maybe some dessert ! <EOR> If order pasta you'll big portion  However if order everything else  pasta going fill up    My sister ordered squid black noodles  FYI your lips look smeared mascara all over it  come off but recommend going straight home after    The tomato uni pasta rich taste  Definitely lot cream but good  <EOR> Trattoria Nakamura Ya recommended good friend definitely lived expectations  bread rolls but bread rolls absolutely amazing! Perfectly fluffy just delicious  But people really come though would come back exclusively bread rolls if didn't live far away ordered clam linguine wine sauce miso carbonara  linguine very light yet really great clam flavor broth delicious made sure leave drop! miso carbonara other hand rich creamy though sauce slightly soupier consistency which caught off guard first but which really ended enjoying  flavor again wasn't overly powerful but nice well balanced    This really great meal paired very attentive friendly service  look forward coming back next time head vegas ! <EOR> Wow  Italian Japanese restaurant  Yes two completely different types cuisines fused into place dine simply delicious! Come open mind!  I remember first time coming few years ago solely uni tomato cream spaghetti but memory's fuzzy visit  only thing remembered eating uni spaghetti dish falling love  that! If you're fan uni all I know uni type dish  hit miss    MUST try  rave dish because just delicious remember it   falling love SECOND TIME!  I love eating uni itself sushi places but dish something  second hits your mouth you'll taste uni but overpowering  creamy rich flavor mixed some subtle hints alfredo ? flavoring  hungry thinking it!   Now comment other foods Beef carpaccio great! also shared octopus carpaccio  beef carpaccio better but then again biggest fan octopus  but love beef more   We then tried steak dish where dip beef into green tea salt  really enjoyed very juicy meat but dish itself nothing spectacular  green tea salt unique feature but does actually add *wow* factor dish itself   The squid ink pasta better expected but nothing rave uni spaghetti  dish would great seafood lovers squid ink very seafood flavor enjoyed  Warning dish your lips tinted black! Take pictures!   Lastly tried risotto sausage mushroom  very rich texture very amazed tasted  loved but getting very full last dish served   We able share 5 dishes between 4 people kind tapas style   Side note bread actually very enjoyable! bread being edible Italian places could break restaurant me   Overall love place would mind coming back  Anyone bring MUST try uni tomato spaghetti!

Well would've thought uni would spotlight main ingredient dish would try compliment every way possible would show uni good light  However tomato cream kind negates     instead complimenting uni balances uni almost cover completely    I'm kind glad shared dish friend  Otherwise wouldn't finished all  Anyways maybe next time try something different menu see goes  <EOR> What interesting place  never expected try ravioli not mention delicious sauce Japanese Italian fusion restaurant  Needless say delicious  place fairly small but didn't bother us  also some tiramisu black sesame pudding which both excellent but enjoyed tiramisu more   Give place chance chance if want something different  <EOR> This place awesome  last two years row since visited Vegas both times great    Last year group 6 did set menus which fun bc everyone ordered different things try lot menu   can't remember everything time over year now    This past labor day weekend headed Vegas again suggested going dinner  lot people group 23 already interested going called reservation   super accommodating worked put together set menu would something everyone    We mushroom salad caprese salad kurabota sausage fried oysters appetizers Tokyo style Hamburg uni tomato cream pasta mimiko meat sauce pasta entrees  Everything served family style    I'm honestly fan uni except when Japan but very seafoody when mixed pasta   still cafe mami Hamburg set better might just nostalgia but pretty good meat sauce pasta interesting  could taste meat but well blended wasn't chewing chunks meat  boot vegetarian group doesn't eat eggs she couldn't eat any entrees made special risotto she said delicious    Service awesome both times  Never once ask more water anything always top game    Go here  Even cab fare roundtrip better cheaper any where strip  <EOR> I need hit gym more often if keep going plaza food tours  fair gym then needed place chill until Katrina M  off work  stopped Big Wong some appetizers then came dinner   For four parties almost many servers  good because attentive service  water glass consistently full while dirty plates silverware exchanged constantly    The prices mid range most expensive thing costing $24 fine dining style service nice  am sure why but every Asian Italian fusion restaurant came across fond cream based sauces  would loved try pasta dishes but only stomach much cream  Instead Fritto Misto $10 95 because fried foods infinitely better you  dish comes two skewers calamari two pieces octopus four shrimp four pieces zucchini all lightly coated panko fried crisp  come hot watch your mouth  marinara light chunky perfection  also comes tartar sauce  entree split Fresh Oysters Watercress Risotto $14 95   creamy rich decadent ratio oysters watercress jaw dropping  only criticism aftertaste  reminisce mayo lingered  faint enough overlook  stopped eating because full due taste    If regret night having room desserts  <EOR> The menu many items   bit overwhelming   ask recommendations   Carpaccio appetizer delicious   Interesting take Italian Japanese dishes   Wait staff very friendly knowledgeable    We Friday night 8pm   Surprisingly empty   Think holiday schedule locals    Definitely place locals    Located small strip mall  next all other famous Japanese restaurants   Raku etc  <EOR> This place sounded really interesting but all honesty just OK me    My friends came conveniently during HH hours 3 5p which some really great selections but all ventured other items regular menu anyway    I opted place's prix fix menu gives option appetizer entree specialty beverage i e  beer wine select soft drinks    ordered Soft Shell Crab appetizer Spaghetti Mentaiko Carbonara Limonata Pellegrino drink   Soft Shell Crab appetizer probably best part meal  wasn't overtly salty deep fried just enough covered grease  mentaiko carbonara other hand pleasing  white sauce pasta dish fish roe top  roe great but pasta way rich liking  cream sauce way creamy sick while    My friends also sold entrees well  place commendable valiant creative efforts bringing Japanese Italian cuisine into but cup tea  Appetizers decent would interested try other appetizers if return again  <EOR> Thank youuu Cindy C  friend fellow Yelper girl weekend Vegas roomie fellow foodie making reservations dine when Mother's Day weekend  just swim pool Uni Spaghetti already please?!
