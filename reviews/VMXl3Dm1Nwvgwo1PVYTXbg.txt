I live Santa Monica currently known Silicon Beach worked actual Silicon Valley San Francisco yet none places which teeming tech employees entrepreneurs work remotely come around brilliant idea opening free welcoming space those work remotely use free wifi outlets plenty seating exchange use full bar full food menu some cool party games thrown good measure  Instead constantly being guilted staying coffee shop late fighting someone outlet restaurant    Why don't more people realize if people comfortable while they're working they're going want stay spend money?

By way bartender's name Heather  If you're Gold Spike Heather behind bar taking your drink order would think twice before assuming service friendly! <EOR> It's funny previous 1 star review taken down  Fishy     The cashier entrance Saturday July 9 around 11pm terrible attitude treating guys crap no reason  surprisingly another reviewer Nathan R  mentioned too    On other hand security quick efficient  weren't warm but weren't rude either   I used enjoy coming but because cashier's nasty attitude pals would rather PT's any other bar downtown feel welcomed  <EOR> We came friends bday Saturday night WORST experience  mind boggled  2 guys 4 girls  weren't drunk being obnoxious  front 2 guy friends just fine but waiting inside 10 minutes wondering happened girls  outside saw dispute manager  Apparently friend couldn't because ID didn't look her  She other identification cards clearly fact manager audacity say nope yet he's phone probably letting underage girls in  disappointing because friends birthday  We're little kids we're late twenties Pete's sake!

The interior place pretty chill low couches lounge areas good music fun people watching   Drinks reasonably priced vibe really casual   early b c line gets long quickly  place perfect large groups friends looking soemthing entertaining budged   Great spot definitely become new hangout! <EOR> I come ALL time spend decent amount money each time   the more drink more money likely spend I'm shots everyone type drunk   usually fun drinks reasonably price  Bartenders back pretty awesome  front bar  problem security  don't know if head inflated because Real World season but staff looks hate jobs  sure train staff customer service  worked retail don't necessarily believe customer always right but common courtesy every customer deserves least  literally talking very LEAST smile bartenders you? Everyone looks miserable hell unless talking each other someone know  <EOR> One absolute place hang Down Town    Gold Spike always comes fun events ideas people attend   Good music fun crowd plenty fun  <EOR> As old time Vegas resident very good view downtowns transformation Gold Spike quite possibly most visual representations that   I never knew describe Gold Spike until friends called adult clubhouse which perfect  When come gold spike there's everything play  Inside there's DJ booth dance floor bean bags giant connect four pool table giant shuffle board  If  enough there's whole area outside  While inside DJ booth outside its stage area where bands play there's seats groups ice rink which may may temporary GIANT BEER PONG!!!!! Gold spike really those places come become sort meeting grounds all downtown  never bad time if different part bar whole new vibe PS if ever need quiet place hang during day gold spike very good that  ridden bike before midday just grabbed few drinks just relaxed <EOR> There really need two listings place service pricing food drink quality venue ambiance  Since aren't though those first few things drag down venue ambiance score solid 2  would 3 but according Yelp means A OK  Meh experienced better really seems fit best here  If service consistently good drinks priced more reasonably downtown spot least 3 would warranted   I never expect stellar experience especially early afternoon when almost no but clear should customer facing job shouldn't   Our group 5 walked ordered few drinks bartender Oscar  friend asked if could also order food him  He said yes she asked garlic fries all five heard repeat confirmation  brought drinks nearby table wait  Meanwhile server came give some menus see if wanted order anything else eat  few people did put orders  handful minutes later first orders fried mozz zucchini started coming out  couple minutes friend's sandwich came but still no garlic fries  asked bartender if he'd heard back garlic fries  answer didn't order any food me  Really? would understood if he just said Oh did ask garlic fries? sorry must spaced order put right away  But he just flat told didn't order food even though all heard order give verbal acceptance  Meanwhile server Angelina very nice personable accommodating apologized behalf   There also questionable handling drink tab Oscar another female employee appeared least shift manager  guy friend bar settle separate tab asked Oscar if he could put different card handed beginning  He didn't know other woman just said No  asked again because we'd never bar where can't transfer your tab another card when cashing out  going around few verbal circles woman explained would still pending charge first card would couple days before disappearing  Great yes know  understand authorizations work  Assuming didn't though why wouldn't just offer caveat begin instead just flat out saying No? Anyway experience isn't necessarily indicative every Gold Spike but most mediocre  Coupled over priced drinks even during happy hour which only applies few things anyway even giant games can't outweigh meh ness place  just damn conveniently located though we'll still end random mediocre lunches future the garlic herb fries still call all   Hopefully Angelina much more bearable  <EOR> Cool spot younger crowd no gambling just bunch oversized old skool games super bowl 90 00 all drink n eat 1 5pm talking top shelf liquor house booze pretty good spread food well <EOR> I remember when place actually rad   now turned into YMCA tools Vegas  happened gem? <EOR> This become regular haunt myself friends  normally hang while bartender Joe working  He best bloody mary maria mix you'll find miles  staff friendly venue cool drinks food great reasonably priced  friend sat bar hours didn't even realize  asked if any unique hot sauce chicken wings proceeded bring over 20 unique bottles all over place  regular long here! <EOR> Gold Spike great place group friends looking fun time  Seems bar would fit right San Francisco Bay Area geared towards younger 20 something year old crowd   Drinks fairly priced around $10 give take  Some nights cheaper drink specials  Food's tasty nothing special bar though   The main draw though all things activities do  Inside there's usually DJ night always cornhole addition arcade carnival games  Outside where action's at oversized beer pong jenga four square plus live band some nights   Gold Spike pretty hectic  night but good time  I'd recommend rolling through big group  <EOR> I patronized Gold Spike twice space twelve hours   The first time evening when vibe loungey  DJ playing Living Room where people reliving childhoods playing Jenga Bean Bag Toss  stepped into backyard bit where band playing while more guests playing some schoolyard type game couldn't quite figure out   I returned next morning Grill order redeem underwhelming breakfast Garden Court Buffet see review well benefit free wi fi  very tasty order Cinnamon French Toast  two servers even chef very pleasant chatty me  morning slow didn't mind catching some business laptop    I would definitely return night some friends enjoy music recess games  I'd also come back breakfast  Whatever mixed reviews posted staff couldn't two mature lady servers African American chef met  <EOR> I'm big fan DTLV wasn't super motivated check Gold Spike hearing comparisons dorm social rooms but ended friends big fans played nice    The ambiance odd  Kind reminds dated living room but nice time playing board games having few drinks  think due company more anything else  Once started getting crowded louder band started fill decided head out    I see place would appeal but just me  <EOR> We monday avoid crowds  playground awesome! service slow over priced drinks  security cleaning staff walked around attitude looked pissed off empty glasses bottles everywhere  ping pong tables pretty raggety but life size beer pong change your life! Also 4 square great game  Very fun place  <EOR> So other day put review horrible experience security   manager Adam contacts directly tells call explain situation little bit more   then call he super apologetic very professional gave explanations   He then told back into goldspike if any issues security call directly !   Adam thank following being professional understanding side story   sure friends keep going over refer all friends over good time ! <EOR> On Saturday 9 July 2016 approximately 11 40pm Nate walked front door where first Polynesian Male Security Re Entry very kind informed which line needed Male General Admission  moment greeted all security personnel complied all uniform security checks myself am Security Manager Beach Club Nightclub strip but return greeted rude forceful directions followed forceful slamming stamp bottom right wrist  Upon looking why she rude she returned reaction belittle feel should come in  Moving into next phase security procedure person checking contraband and or weapons didn't even attempt give directions he just forced around  Moments later found group friends table near bar no further incident   Note Sad enough say place used favorite place downtown during weekdays since could never because manage nightclub but without doubt if could give place negative stars would 5 star rating door  Bartenders other hand very nice all aspects granted only bought drank two alcoholic beverages   End <EOR> I they're trying which hip cool hang joint adults  There's lot places chill if you're lucky might even bed relax on  germaphobia begins kick avoid attraction    I feel there's lot potential place  Maybe need during night time fully experience joint because every time there's hardly anyone there  mentioned there's lot space sit but then there's also lot empty spaces  Maybe some sort dance floor?   I think could add some more games too  There's connect four darts inside  Outside there's plenty things Twister life size beer pong tetherball life size chess more  see why place would fun but think needs lot maintenance  Many chairs games looks worn wonder when last time bothered deep cleaning any materials?   The drinks okay  much drinker don't think best candidate judge alcohol but price bit high side  Last time watered down alcohol charged $15 it  Talk buyers remorse  wish drink discounts but if no sign anywhere    I'm always bit hesitant but pretty fun if don't know else around downtown  if want good time enjoy free games sip some drinks  But again just wish cleaned stuff once while  maybe replace them overall! <EOR>
