My friends checked into TI traveling Boston JFK STARVING decided check Kahunaville  food wasn't bad but service TERRIBLE  server took forever 3 tables filled where were wasn't congenial all  ordered peach iced tea clear which kind freaked out  tasted syrup never ordered another one  While server hiding somewhere asked some staff if eating  told them ordered food but hadn't received yet  told move seats different table because setting projector something  Instead grabbing new silverware least telling where sit just told grab stuff move  only time smile when bill dropped off  I'd stay TI again but definitely wouldn't visit Kahunaville  <EOR> 40+ buy free drink coupons brought here  drinks awesome good prices  location sucks food wasnt great thats why im holding off 5th star  only if coupons <EOR> Had great time k ville essie awesome flair bartender   No food just drinks today but il always give 5 stars when where its due  <EOR> Not greatest service    little slow but good prices Vegas food good! Really good burgers clam chowder!! <EOR> Dropped grab quick bite before hoped would long tournament poker room   quiet time day   seemed lot more lively when passed later   kept cheap lunch special 4 mini sandwiches   Three them good fourth some sort mushroom sauce didn't like   Best part fries!  Best fries while   Thin crispy seasoned well   always fry fan but finished whole pile   3 5 stars great fries getting $14 tip  <EOR> Order Secret Menu!  Ask Dr  Kahuna Burger! Turkey Burger Grilled Pineapple topped Teriyaki Sauce!  Okay kidding     secret menu but totally let it!  Food took longer usual but worth wait!  Vegan Sandwich Add some zucchini mushrooms anything filling because kinda skimpy!   Upside down pineapple cake must! <EOR> Poor atmosphere poor service   Careful your receipt guys overcharge credit card  <EOR> this place hawaiian  food presentation poor    but since waiter manager made effort accomodate friend's pickiness sometimes worse decided worth 2 stars   ordered coconut shrimp she ordered chicken both which $25 each  u would think good    i hope others didnt buy groupon did    disappointing  btw   get window view bar dining area shitty  some tell water show great  NOT! turn sprinkler home better <EOR> Kahunaville another favorite places take town visitors  would strongly suggest going dinner sure seat bar area back restaurant  flair bartenders absolutely amazing! put fantastic flair show hourly  seen show probably 125+ times  Every time see am impressed!   The drinks very touristy moderately priced restaurant strip  food good! would personally suggest Nachos! Its gourmet but take island food decent   You definitely agree seeing show worth time stop through few drinks! <EOR> This restaurant laid back delicious!  awesome waitress name Jules she amazing  came Groupon deal let tell worth it!!  definitely going back even without Groupon  both teriyaki steak sauce side jasmine rice veggies!!! AMAZING!!! Order medium rare good side shrimp all under $30 which would cost without Groupon    boyfriend drink tasted piña colada but all sorts rum it    good  wouldn't recommend wine but everything else good wish would've gone first night  Definitely give try!  The only reason why am giving place four stars five because wine selection wasn't great wine steak  Other definitely place try  laid back sports bar bartenders fun!!! <EOR> So place Kahunaville pretty much just Applebee's TI   only difference would atmosphere slightly better   same unoriginal menu overly salted food served fairly unpleasant person     If wasn't super hungover close death would made effort eat but being usual self over did significantly night before   review food wifey both wraps way much salty sauce them some OK but super salty fries   margarita very sour comes extra shot Tequila gummy worm it   suggestion them would forget frills decent drink   service some worst experienced Vegas overall cannot give place sort endorsement  <EOR> Came dinner boyfriend  Vegas locals often come down strip try new restaurants  say Disappointed understatement  server's name Diane  5 30pm reservations but arrived 20 minutes early  restaurant pretty empty hostess seated right away no problem  3 minutes seated waitress arrived asked if wanted anything drink without much hello  She then asked if ready order  told would need few more minutes  Literally two minutes later she came back take order  Once food arrived didn't see again until ready check  Overall she seemed very inattentive  food wasn't great way rushed assures won't back  <EOR> Horrible hospitality  Don't dinner show if want time anything else planned night  Told 15 mins early kept waiting over 30 minutes  also didn't even bother communicate crowd  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised place  Didn't any drinks see any live entertainment just dinner   Yes cheesy looking touristy looks wannabe Rainforest Cafe    But give 4 stars only because food really good because given $20 off coupon casino  Otherwise probably wouldn't wanted pay full price restaurant   Woulda rather gone somewhere nicer if case  But regardless good deal service decent  think called cajun chicken pasta  VERY good serious pasta lover  boyfriend steak shrimp mashed potatoes he enjoyed it  Came purple orchid plate  put hair when left  D Total coupon came $29 00   As mentioned before place little touristy liking would elsewhere drinks unless don't mind cheesy atmosphere    But food really good didn't wait long great deal  Definitely if $20 off coupon   Otherwise might little pricey  <EOR> I don't care if you're hurry you're tempted cheesy decor  better late night bites  Ignore coupon girls  $5 per dish late night doesn't require coupon normal price   It claims bar blasts Top 40 music videos especially remixes but least before midnight you'll just see people sitting around wondering why can't find waitress take order   If insist eating skip chili dog just split nachos quesadillas  <EOR> Typical chain type themed restaurant   Friendly staff nice atmosphere great service   cocktail good food good side salad awesome huge   Would definitely eat again even without groupon <EOR> I always fun Vegas but last weekend best time ever Kahunaville  Treasure Island play blackjack biggest heater  collecting winnings throwing 10 000 high fives  celebrate instead going Ruth's Chris across street friends wanted eat Kahunaville continue party pool  made right choice  Food great waitress Barbara highlight experience  She kept party going made sure everything perfect  Most party ordered steak wasn't Ruth's Chris but sure easy wallet  recommend Jerk Satays shrimp appetizer  girlfriend really enjoyed burger fruity drink  Keep them coming Barbara! <EOR> Eh  Checked because boyfriend two for one drink coupon  8pm few families having late dinner young couple having drinks dinner absolutely no bar area  waiter polite but frankly seemed embarrassed give menu which laminated full drinks contained Kahunaville party rum and or Monster energy drink  party rum comes many flavors  something but all them sickly sweet     When coconut pineapple party rum Monster margaritas extra sugar or whatever ordered arrived full maraschino cherries pipe cleaner palm trees stuff  well laser light show music but guess just wasn't spirit    The verdict might ideal bachelorette party but probably best start your libations unless choosing precisely because Margaritaville seems might classy  <EOR> I came family because buy 1 1 coupon but rip off  capped coupon $10 only sandwich value  <EOR> Awful food service  waitress barely checked she smelled grease  spinach dip okay but club wrap tasted bad tuna  <EOR> A friend mine staying Treasure Island  few weeks back she invited lunch being turn down free food decided head down ol' TI pick up  really hoping she would open dining Off Strip but alas when met she pulled coupon pocketbook  Oh lordy!  She 2 for1 buffet coupon well those pesky Kahunaville coupon strips girl Hawaiian getup hands bottom parking garage escalator  voted buffet but she wasn't hungry enough eat buffet she assumed she three trips stuff herself tourist mentality sure   As headed into garish Kahunaville restaurant hostess asked if would sit inside outside pool area  chose latter   The first red flag should fact escorted table but rather told turn right walk down hallway then turn right doors  outside patio covered misters which plus   After waiting table order taken drink refills another table a good 15 minutes finally asked waitress would drink  told would use free drink coupon which she said fine but wouldn't able use any other three coupons during visit  stunk especially because wanted use Buy 1 entree 50% off coupon well   After another 10 minutes drinks arrived  Mine 10 melted ice cubes tasted watered down blue mess  complaining drink waitress explained Oh depends bartender day  heck kind answer fix apology that? Then waitress finally around taking order Did decide want? Obviously since 25 minutes study entire two page menu!  The food okay nothing rave same price you're better off eating hotel cafe  waitress made no apologies experience blaming anything complained bartenders cooks  couple next even addressed fact service horrible   While friend picked tab still felt cheated  <EOR> Avoid! very rare write review but experience Kahunaville feel others should warned  boyfriend excited give try vacation finding Living Social deal  menu looked good sounded fun  start experience seated dirty table  hostess apologized oversight washed off but rag looked dirty well  then waited 5 minutes before waiter acknowledged said he would back 2 minutes  10 minutes later hostess saw still sitting came over see if helped when said no proceeded take order  could service waiter but let's move food  know Vegas food pricey but quality terrible! boyfriend's chicken tasted frozen marinara tasted can  coconut shrimp tasted stuff freezer section not bad but expected more price vegetables overcooked blaw rice rice   If hadn't gotten entire meal 50% off would've upset paying full price such terrible meals     The only positive experience mixed drink the Vacation believe name which really very good!  recommendation stop mixed drink appetizer if really want check but many better choices area if want tasty meal  <EOR> The show did meet expectation seen much better  same 4 girls n boys perform whole show more entertaining performances kept singing !!  Food mediocre didn't care cold bread dry fish n plain rice no flavours boring SWEET stir fry full broccoli ! Come better stir fry   waste 80$ recommended  <EOR> where begin? dont even want give 1 star because doesnt even deserve that    First off no idea where check table standing around 15 minutes finally approached then she told wait another 10 during other people walked she seated them right away she must forgotten us    seated looking menu which maybe 10 things left because prices way tooooo high drinks even higher  RECOMMEND ALL  <EOR> Awful service waiter didn't check even once  ran tiny juice drinks second holding hands 20 minutes still no attention  Breakfast so so portions big coupons just joke  <EOR> We Kaunaville 2 years ago loved it  flair energy every thing   Went back week wow difference   No late  food no flair  no energy  no fun  wonder much business lose each night   saw 10 people without spending any money leave because boring   Excellent bartender though   Hopefully he'll job elsewhere some money because can't imagine he ends meet now  <EOR> We received some complimentary tickets night show  option dinner while watching show but already eaten hour two prior show  waitress VERY rude  She first asked if doing dinner once said no she took off without even asking if wanted drinks  chase down another employee drinks ordered bottle wine  When came time pay bill looked automatically included 18% gratuity Large party even though just wife I  usually tip 15 25% anyways big deal amount  bothered she getting tip doing anything us  name Tammi believe  reason still give 3 stars because just person service prior morning breakfast good even management came over sure things good during breakfast  think need same amount attention during show  <EOR> stopped NYE grab tall glass margaritas before hit strip   vibe atmosphere pretty chill live band playing   place pretty small crowded   least 4 bartenders working night tall cup jiffy without waiting line   bartender pretty generous which always plus   liked top off bunch cherries gummi worms   and mean bunch! plus 4 extra test tube shots  wow!    i think just cuz took look other people only 2 extra shots 3 gummi worms cherry   $25 one  which wasnt bad guess  <EOR> Been twice now give nothing special certainly no bargain   Overpriced food insanely overly salted fries decent drinks   $20 basic chicken stir fry only tiny bit chicken just nothing great here   Lots other great places strip much more satisfying this  probably bother going again  <EOR> Food fine   Large breakfast around $7 coupon TI   Service atrocious though!! slow!! Waitress tried blame being really busy but when all kind laughed said the place mostly empty! she said it'll busier!    Ummm ok does right now?? Even trying take money painful! <EOR> Sehr durchschnittliches Restaurant  Keine Überraschungen beim Essen weder nach oben noch nach unten  <EOR> I'm going start off saying food great! loved entrees dessert but service sub par  server extremely rude  seated uncomfortable chair person party because person recently back surgery needed switch booth Our hostess dropped menus look off before could ask no around other table dining room moved booth accommodate disabled person party  wait 15 minutes service someone service Meanwhile server waiting table 3 tables away cleaned off table 2 tables away impression being ignored because weren't area  Then someone she came table BAD attitude very nasty off moving because section closed  appalled She no nametagon but found asking another server name Tonya  She did introduce herself because she busy insulting us  Once she stopped attitude end meal told reason moved medical purpose she apologized misunderstanding  made very uncomfortable experience entire time there  Our problem way she acted wait  Its also OK explain disability situation staff member calm down because thats personal business would rather explain relive  every time restaurant  <EOR> The food awesome! sampler platter AMAZING!!

Also drinks bad either  ordered margharita specifically way skinny girl style made perfectly  friends also enjoyed speciality drinks menu while there    However    The speciality drinks way overpriced  Also while dinner friends same mentioned above confusing baffling experience which brings rating place down mind  friends pregnate therefore watching she eating  night she ordered nachos which she craving  When placing order she requested peppers olives side  Also she asked gouda cheese included  When dish came exactly described menu but she ordered  Good thing she husband also ordered plate chicken wings  waitress wonderful take plate nachos back kitchen order corrected  BUT she then returned w   strange news kitchen refused change order    I never restaurant would willing give customer wanted  cheeses apparently pre mixed  No problem friend  But kitchen still refused serve peppers olives side  friend canceled nachos order instead decided french fries  half hour later rest a total 6 people party finished plates fries still arrived  When all said done friends paid more 1 speciality drink they free plastic cup whoopie! meal  plate chicken wings   Therefore give restaurant 3 stars Great calamari margharita Horrible kitchen service overpriced drinks  Oh yeah plastic cup tacky well    My advice only appetizers couple drinks but nothing else  <EOR> Good fan place visited dinner For price we 50% off coupon good choice    Got steak shrimps potato puree + greek salad made pretty decent tried better but again price range pretty good     Nice music loud enough keep mood quiet enough talk    Barmens periodically doing performances bar general place full energy   The downsides drinks relatively expensive $7 bottle Corona huh   drinks served plastic cups waitress super welcome probably due fact 18% gratuity automatically included bill   In general price paid bad place would probably rate 3 stars if paid full price <EOR> NOT Kahunaville just few years ago!  86'd Flair Bartenders which really nice touch added tremendously party atmosphere   I called made reservation party 10 birthday surprise   asked call back number careful give only CEL number since live surprisee     45 minutes later HOME phone rang   Kahunaville confirming reservation   Apparently used number caller ID given them  Kind sneaky Fortunately grabbed phone surprised wasn't ruined  Strike one We arrived 5 10 minutes early then wait almost 20 min them table ready   waitress arrived took drink orders   Only person the guest honor ordered alcoholic beverage frozen margarita   sodas arrived quickly   Over next 20 minutes waitress came back 3 4 times say margarita would right   Strike two The food arrived SMALL groups  3 4 items spread over nearly TEN MINUTES!!  Several cold food waited everyone served   Two orders wrong sent back  NOT kind service would expect Featured Restaurant Major Strip Hotel!  STRIKE THREE! The food mediocre best   partially due stuff sitting getting cold while waited service completed  Cold coconut pineapple gravy atop barely warm piece chicken just ISN'T very tasty!   ordered Teryaki Flank Steak cooked medium   tough impossible TEAR some apart let alone try cut dull dinner knife    time waitress returned check many people finished eating    told waitress condition steak   She asked if wanted re order    wanting whole party wait watch eat myself declined   last heard until quick told 'them' steak check arrived   hadn't taken off bill nor did offer any other type compensation  A small dessert even scoop ice cream Birthday Guest would nice gesture   NOTHING    The next day called spoke Manager   She listened complaints first comment 'should said something manager table   when COULD done something it'   told no except waitress come table   Finally she said she would 'look into it' back few minutes right She took phone number but don't know why   She never called back   No problem know ten guests and everyone tell never back! <EOR> Not first choice but 21 year old twins took LOVED mom aunt entertained give few props    First off Flair bar  Before getting all Office Space means bartenders sling drink bottles around all fancy Tom Cruise Cocktail mix horrendously sweet undrinkable concoctions which auction off some nights contest some sort  happened such night    Pros The DJ took requests extensive 80s collection Nobody minded some party falling all over place My frequent requests water met smile   and eventually  BUCKET filled ice water We 21 year old twin girls result many drinks table couldn' t finish them all It hotel carrying said falling over person back room painful could been  Cons Flair  Bartenders  Need say more?

Disgusting   After show DJ started party  where things downhill even quicker    there group guys stupidly drunk  felt bad them because acting stupid but horrible barf fest hangover surely way sugary drinks   And then group four Cougars laying wait drunk pups come wondering over side jungle  horrific site forever burned into retinas   ugh!!! gave dirty dancing whole new low   and mean low  am still suffering nightmares   I know know   to each own  But YECK!!!  Our food server   super nice! She even asked manager if could wine instead diabetic coma induced drinks  She succeeded!! Kudos back  <EOR> Our first night Las Vegas girlfriend's birthday trip cousin suggested place  Cousin cousin's husband arrived night before walked past Kahunaville heard general party atmosphere commotion coming within determined might good spot spend some time money  Boy wrong   I don't know happening night before but when came dead  Granted early only 8 00 but Friday night wanted fun  atmosphere cheesy reminded Rainforest Café but more sleazy first thought Rainforest Café ha ha ha      We sat down bar bartenders outnumbered us  Several them seemed busy serving few customers other around bar  Then bartender came over didn't appear any customers yet would think he'd happy business but instead gave attitude disrupting relaxation time  girlfriend asked he would recommend drink menu which MO she generally doesn't bother making decisions unfamiliar territory relies employees like  Instead naming off few drinks favorite heck most expensive thing menu because if he'd brains say she probably would just bought he made some snarky comment reading menu  Okay dude clock right? your job right? she ordered shooter margarita which overpriced she said wasn't great  cousin ordered flamboyant purple drink came big fishbowl souvenir cup smoking dry ice  looked really cool big hit but course overpriced  Don't know husband ordered  part ordered Monster which cost $7 00  Outrageous    On top he mocked GF's cousin when he asked we'd bill she clearly stated gestured she husband would together  hearing impaired could hear say two people down bar  He copied gesture said don't know means all snippy  All four looked each other What's guy's problem? Did mistakenly end Dicks?  literally only customers! guess he having bad night just doesn't making money  He didn't any ours   It awkward left  guess angry bartender night off previous night because he clearly bringing party Friday  somewhere else  None back  <EOR> We really weren't intending eating here  tried couple other restaurants beforehand but being told hour wait them kept walking  seeing Cirque du Soleil's Mystère Kahunaville right near entrance figured would give shot   We told would 15 minute wait welcome drink bar while waited table  couple hands almost broken booze covered video poker bar 20 minutes later enquired table told called name hadn't answered  knew bar only few paces away couldn't tried hard find us  minute later group sitting next bar exact same thing happen   After table cleared couple minutes later quickly ordered couple margaritas which came snake lollies them quite nice! few more we'd forget issues getting table  Unfortunately service very swamped getting more drink let alone few more almost impossible    Foodwise wife Summer salad seemed almost impossible without meat but huge quite tasty  pretty massive burger of course did! though really can't remember which now visit quite while ago now    All all Kahunaville made okay choice rushed dinner little other options around but doubt we'll return  <EOR> The best restaurant bar pool  server Barbara Vermillon best she made sure everyone taken care off  first day she working alone made happen  She always smiling engaged customer  planning next Vegas trip definitely looking Barbara  <EOR> Every vegas trip take always sure stop kahunaville its time review    So far restaurant part its deff best experience     servers always seem attitude nearly impossible track down once sat down  Food mediocre altho serve pretty big portions    sampler always fun order tho great 2 people awesome volcano display    And now bar part!

We came sat ourselves  didn't realize stopped serving dinner 10pm came little 10pm  waited over 20 min the only reason stayed long because groupon place   saw waitress passed ignored while tending other table  finally flagged down ask some dinner menu when she told kitchen already closed   I wouldn't pissed off if only she acknowledge when sat ourselves least warn kitchen being closed passing table whole 20 minutes! I can't rate food but service definitely zero star! <EOR> Fun atmosphere unique tasty potent cocktails  Haven't eaten but would recommend bar area date night group event night friends  <EOR> Ugh   good food   love good service   place provided neither unfortunately   food average best   breakfast burrito guac salsa both clearly straight grocery store   coffee tasted poorly made Maxwell House oj definitely wasn't fresh squeezed   service took forever wasn't worth wait   Maybe stuff better when you're drunk hungover?  When totally sober should definitely opt something else   Even just sticking Starbucks would much safer option and cheaper too!   <EOR> I love oxygen bar here! every time come vegas  $20 gets oxygen cure just any hangover headache Vegas dish out  also gets vodka monster drink back message! recommend place EVERYONE! <EOR> I Absolutely Love Bar!

As staying TI thought we'd check which on site bars would best start evening  Just 60 seconds elevator stumbled across Kahunaville  Blaring live music whooping crowd chants shot shot shot! drew straight in    Each night before headed down strip came drink two  live band Friday Saturday nights Atomic Milkshake great way kick off night playing everything Ray Charles Oasis  Really talented very entertaining    The drinks little pricier we'd hoped around $10 single mixer but seemed Vegas way  Also free shots around every corner could hardly complain!  But when party's over?

Lets say even groupon tad overpriced  food bad but total would 80 bucks 46 groupon worth it    Portions big but lacked any thing more just good  alcoholic beverage just ok tasting but price expected more    If cheaper I'd say good place go    but prices set  service kinda crappy    Overall 2 5 star  <EOR> Disgustingly poor service  appalled shocked attitude received waitress all four looked another left immediately she took order   The wait very deceiving first all  fooled  decided try Kahunaville breakfast seeing wasn't line  host asked many then preceded walk halfway thru restaurant REAL waiting area which approximately forty five minutes   Once seated looked over very small but extremely affordable menu I think 8 total breakfast options? happy saw  unhappy middle aged ex stripper waitress walk table frowning just stood pad pen  greeted Good morning response What's your order?   all kindly gave order husband finishing when she walked off  problem he wasn't finished order  He hollered Excuse miss?

fruit fine its own  wants taste alcohol when amount appreciable enough buzzed? feel should least mentioned menu    I'm sure place other meals but inclined give another chance  <EOR> Watch living social groupon voucher available place  2 frozen drinks 2 salads 2 entrees  <EOR> Wouldn't suggest food had artichoke dip consistency paste but dude!  drinks amazing!!! <EOR> Very good food great large parties    came lunch dinner during Vegas trip    nachos gigantic tasty   cocktails deelish    bar area shenanigans flair bartending exciting watch <EOR> I'm really conflicted many stars give  ate bar food great but drink worst ever had  never history life sent drink back  drinks great  drinks didn't much care for  disgusting  couldn't drink all  only did send back exchanged water because didn't want risk having another drink same bartender  manager come register void drink ticket she obviously knew going on   She never looked acknowledged any way apologized dissatisfaction   nothing  although really did food way overshadowed undrinkable drink terrible customer service  <EOR> They handing coupons front restaurant buy entree half off bogo drinks   If want use both walk bar your drinks double fist them  five four stir fry using coupon full priced crab cakes awesome   Everyone loved rice service  total bill just food $100 drinks $10 50 long islands but hear price might vary bartender   Overall great price  <EOR> Where even start    Walked waited few minutes seated breakfast  Waters took forever delivered  server abrupt kinda rude   food took more 15 minutes come  following items ordered 1 steak eggs steak overcooked 2 breakfast burrito good nothing special 3 eggs potatoes potatoes delicious 4 panko crusted waffle only offer strawberry which allergic no whipped cream since ran no other option offered big fail! Coffee good  orange juice took few reminders before even being delivered  lady delivered food lovely  Unfortunately couldn't enjoy meal since constant bickering kitchen  don't think coming back even try dinner  <EOR> Good place hang both bar restaurant  great pina colada waitress gave each free shot since wait awhile drinks  Later restaurant great salad! Good food service  <EOR> I totally impressed bartender  friends informed bartender does regular show mixing tons drinks all same time front lot drink aficionados he would serve all them afterwards  lucky night when Kahunaville because he did routine  awesome  free drink birthday too! Fun tastic! <EOR> This first place upon arriving Vegas terrible welcoming  found coupons hotel decided try it  didn't know order decided mini sandwich sampler  all pretty terrible except french dip  friend ordered crab cake sandwich no idea reason  stupid order crab cake desert bad you'd expect  pretty expensive inedible  boyfriend Cuban confusingly bad  dry but oily? cheap asses took home better cold dipped ranch ketchup   The only plus bartender let use second coupon free drink  bad drinks   <EOR> This honestly worse place ever eaten las vegas  every other restaurant 30 45 minute wait treasure island saw place tried stop quick bite  think must 2 servers because bunch open tables but yet still 10 minute wait  Because starving bar where waited 10 minutes before even getting glass water  making clear bartender ready order hungry he took time over take order  Now food disgusting  ordered mini burgers which basically 1 burger cut into four pieces put little rolls  mean cheap you'll cut burnt  burger call sliders??? also spinach dip  literally driest dip yellow tint it  Finally when ready leave bartender left bar 20 minutes never came back  took another 10 minutes ask waitresses print bill  food disgusting within 20 minutes leaving hotel sick because stomach couldn't handle fowl food was   place should shutdown  least needs health department come in  <EOR> This inside Treasure Island across Theatre   often coupons BOGO   ordered Surf Salad thinking would real small side salad but huge enough two people   Great flavor spinach nutritious greens   also ordered pulled pork sandwich which very tasty but needed some bbq something   Overall good tasty food   did interior looked liked dive bad furnishings bit noisy   salad!!! <EOR> I've several occasions left several reviews but time around ate breakfast say best breakfast hands down very generous  love drinks Latin dance night Saturday  <EOR> During three day trip Vegas ate food Kahunaville   three times! day family spent day pool T I  cabana convenient order breakfast lunch place   breakfast eggs benedict hollandaise sauce side  Decent  lunch Cuban Sandwich  Again pretty good  best part gave MOUNTAIN fries sandwich  Nothing reminds weak eating enormous serving french fries while looking tiny girls tiny bikinis  Oh well   The next day Buffalo Chicken wrap really disappointed  Buffalo sauce some weird tang' very unnecessary  Also server day quirky guy named Rodeo refilled drinks bringing new glass but poured liquid into glass table  dunno think  weird   Nonetheless when Vegas want Chili's Applebees quality food drop Kahunaville  <EOR> Beware  they lure COUPONS       Other nightmare airport experiences getting leaving Vegas Restaurant probably only other bad part trip Vegas    Im usually pretty liberal when comes rating restaurant taking into account service cost taste experience etc  Mr  usually pretty easy guy please! however place off wrong foot  First all think instantly turned off Hawaiian themed restaurant 0% Aloha menu    I mean wasn't expecting authentic hawaiian meal but thinking would some sort commercialized Panda Express Bahama Breeze attempt it? even few Musubi's would shut when comes questioning why place Hawaiian theme    but seriously only Aloha place jungle print menu   that being said could add few more fish tanks called place Rain Forest Cafe  However two reasons why ended many times 3 times exact did thats because staying treasure Island coupon    I've plenty restaurants where service non existent doesn't bother because usually some yummy food more it  understand why some places may best service reasons such being understaffed cultural differences In some cultures if waitress constantly coming your table means want leave rather enjoy your food chat your party just simply well trained  However when comes Chain restaurant Casino would think basics courtesy would standard? 2 3 experience  My first experience waitress seemed be    off own world? place wasn't busy all but she seemed preoccupied something     just sure was  plastic cups beverages kind turn off well  Chicken burger super dry all kahuna bbq sauce world could save it   and believe TRIED HARD! lol  The 2nd time came drink bartender literally took 10 minutes because he dancing behind counter? place dead only 3 people sitting bar  When bartender finally took drink order he totally wrong because wanted those cool long margarita glasses instead 10 oz disposable cup      fail      My last experience breakfast pool    this experience lot better! food good server actually happy see made effort feel welcomed   all all last experience only reason place two stars instead one    however if don't coupon better places strip spend your money  <EOR> We came several years ago awesome show bar  Now its just every other bar strip without flare show  GREAT service but nothing special without show    Scuba steve still did little flare but BRING SHOW BACK! <EOR> Okay let admit shocked food good  outside looks crazy loud bar flair bartending   great if you're looking but wanted dinner before Mystere which everyone should see   pretty amazed taken table separate part restaurant where noise tolerable level where could eat comfortably  ordered Halibut scallops plate because wanted something light  Well    YUM! fish excellent sauce delicate tasty jasmine rice good eating own  Really best meal Treasure Island hotel price etc really blown away  definitely recommend one  <EOR> Smaller most clubs lounges but very energetic   You'll find people don't crazy crowded meat market overpriced cover come drinking dancing bar usually some sort free drink special band entertaining   nice break techno house remixes find everywhere else Vegas still manages please most musical tastes   drinks very pricey though take advantage specials don't feel completely taken advantage of   They late night happy hour pints $5 apps its bad late night  <EOR> Oy  Where start? fact constantly given coupons already gave preconception tacky bar before even saw place  place was  Think Rainforest Cafe without children oxygen bar I still don't Vegas' fascination those then add many different random aspects are    So anyways used 2 drink deal mom margarita while bottled beer  bartender very nice tried conversation seeing Missouri do look Mizzou?!   He also did some flaring which entertaining watch I rarely bar where flair easy   However quality mother's drink meh  looked he just opened frozen mix plunked without any alcohol  also came separate shot tequila which think didn't try mixing anything  beer good but  because didn't handle outside cracking open     So overall would say avoid think them when think want good deal Vegas  <EOR> this first place ate while vegas place nice  coupon buy half off made really good deal     only 4 starts because because service took alng time but overall very freindly food good!!! <EOR> Very bad experience last nite please take your belongings while place  big size drink disappeared couple moments when dancing  wife  called security staff but yell us  <EOR> I REALLY RECOMMEND PLACE  HATE GIVE bad review   I quick dinner  before Mystere show   It took 40 mins bring sampler dried ribs wings <EOR> Lunch Dinner Food terrible   Server recommended ribs tasted terrible chunks cartilage something  baby back ribs plenty times but never did much random chunks bones cartilage  Maybe just poor cut ribs  could only eat 1 5 ribs before just gave up   My company ordered miso salmon enjoyed it   An hour later both extremely sour stomachs  <EOR> We stayed Ti Kahunaville where ate last night  did come buy drink frequently though  HIGHLY recommend trying Otter Pop if here! good!  Anyway Gluten Free Chicken Parm good! portion HUGE two massive chicken breasts giant plate spaghetti  whole meal next day! husband burger which he enjoyed well  waitress great very accommodating   *Just warning though if large party want split check permission management so  waitress did split check which great  <EOR> Not bad touristy hotel restaurant strip but really dinner quality  food tasty but exactly island style  huge drink menu almost big but good reasonably priced well  <EOR> Horrible Horrible horrible!  We came because buy dinner entree free but honestly don't even think worth it  seated right near hostess server didn't come table 15 minutes! She completely she just rolled bed came work didn't write anything down course she forgot things   The food just okay ordered chicken teryaki jasmine rice but smothered huge chunks vegetables pineapple pieces  wasn't wowed meal but least entrees free! <EOR> I came large group 10+ people dinner  Service excellent considering server helped able satisfy requests just everyone party  food really good visually outstanding decorated very island esque  wish little bit more variety menu but guess confidence anything choose because few items delicious!

Waitress completely absent   very busy night them sure but management needs more people working tables sure people happy   probably would ordered more drinks if waitress would've ask if wanted any!  advertise having great bartenders tricks whatnot but never saw drinks ordered made competant bartenders    Overall just seemed completely disorganized regards handling UFC event     2 stars simply fact table near tv screen food ended being edible because wasn't over $100 per person  Meh better 2 stars describes feelings perfectly  <EOR> Hate doing but no choice  Stood front 2 minutes no came seat asked girl saw working seat me  She called over someone but person quickly book event people behind waiting seated  same lady saw told if cool if sat bar did  Starving waiting attention again time bartender  even glance any type service woman behind bar  literally sat 10 minutes looking menu grabbed side bar  walked never eat again  First time ate spring 12' wasn't memorable    There plus though if actually service bartenders flare bottles some pretty cool tricks   only thing  awesome place  <EOR> Every time come Vegas boyfriend come here  really enjoy bar  service great fast friendly  ate Friday night OMG ate chicken pasta fabulous! would highly recommend going enjoy it  <EOR> We travel zoo deal which great value  didn't know all bartenders did bartender flair thing all time but very cool see them flip juggle bottles  All drinks very good  sat bar enjoyed show played video poker good two hours  highly recommend going drinks  <EOR> Use coupon else!

My check came $12 change I don't remember actual amount   paid  $20 she brought back even $7  She just kept coin change  only quarter something small wasn't big deal except just very rude possibly illegal   So rating only food would give 3 1 2 stars cause food good enough price Vegas Breakfast special good especially when compared other food places TI but rating service negative 2 might generous   There lot other places eat doubt seriously back  <EOR> So kitschy touristy basically Rainforest Cafe whole lot more liquor involved  said Kahunaville still holds special place heart   The drinks pretty overpriced but decently alcoholic really liked mojito they're generous limes mint!   When Martin M cutesy little date and cutesy mean even pictures taken some random photographer actually bought print crab salad  comes little plastic coconut shell just exuded island themed party   tasted pretty good even though crab pretty obviously canned variety   Recently came back double date four split bunch appetizers appeTEASErs? hehe   sliders awesome fried calamari which comes red curry sauce  nachos weren't really thing but did them peculiar resemblance chili cheese fries fresh pier  server hilarious wish could bought drink!
