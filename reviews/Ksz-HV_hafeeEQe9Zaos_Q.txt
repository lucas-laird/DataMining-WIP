The vibe when first entered very mellow much going which good thing!  I tried Wold ramen bowl think called great  lunch back dinner too! lol  Please stay business since know alot business tried stay open closing  REALLY guys better anime ramen any others previously  <EOR> Much Private Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue's obsession shrimp movie Forest Gump World Noodle but singular passion Noodles!  You reasonably priced noodle dishes almost every region Asia    Craving Japanese ton kotsu ramen? Yeah it  Korean budae jiggae? Check  Thai khao soi pad see yew? Yep    Look  probably slightly better versions various dishes restaurants specializing only regional cuisines  Ton kotsu ramen looking *monta ramen* *cough*   But where World Noodle shines huge variety noodle dishes offers  something everyone  <EOR> We walked into empty restaurant 1230! stayed empty until left   Thought busy but sushi bar next door   Ordered noodle dish   Duck shredded   picture   Ordered ramen vs rice noodle   Charged extra dollar that   Soup bad could only eat half order because soup strong   Chef server nerve ask if duck noodle before   knew Hawaii   doesnt eat duck noodle Hawaii!  Dont recommend  <EOR> Love thier noodles  Its always empty when which surprises because think food awesome waitress always nice  price fair   Around 20 bucks two people  <EOR> Formally Anime Ramen now better World Noodle  place doesn't need gimmicks  Bossa Nova music playing which plus me  prices very reasonable too! Most plates $6 50 which cheaper going panda express  Tried pad thai yakisoba noodles delicious! waitress friendly always checked too  back try some more items  <EOR> This place deserves review stays business because need to! I'm always craving combination spicy touch sweet sour noodle bowls hit spot! 3X last week    This new place should mistaken used which anime ramen which then turned maid ramen  Unlike former actually good food there's two sizes small large    The Thai boat noodle roast duck noodle really good  tried ramen only ok  Seeing Thai owned restaurant opinion I'd recommend sticking Thai dishes  Note roast duck more thai flavored   not would find Chinese restaurants    Since can't LA SF fix closest come eating Thai boat noodle Vegas  comparable  usually 8 which just perfect me  Looking forward trying 10 next time which real soon  <EOR> I wanted give place 4 stars but     new business lady served nice enough want them well   However World Noodle really nothing extraordinary even competitive offer!   They more Thai Chinese fusion cuisine which seems next big thing nowadays   Thai dumplings wrapped cooked mochis taro chives bamboos   tried all three prepared fried good try if cooked mochi somewhat authentic dishes     I special noodle I can't remember name now think World Noodle? decent   exactly expected but bit sweeter thought should be   bf ordered duck noodle much sweeter thought should since soup more soy sauce base     To bit more harder give more stars want only patrons when arrived little past five   still only patrons when left 40 minutes later     Like said if you're looking venture into new restaurant sake going new restaurant all means grab bowl noodle World Noodle   But if you're mood some comfort food noodle World Noodle may you    <EOR> Was 11 pm Fri 21 Feb  Thai Boat ?
