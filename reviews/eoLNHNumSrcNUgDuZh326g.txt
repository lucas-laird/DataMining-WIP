It's best Indian food but price good service friendly family owned   decor doesn't feel quite Indian restaurant but more diner  fun mismatch  Even weirder also Filipino food menu! Strange combination but it!   I've only ever buffet  Some items hit miss but tandoori chicken yummy aloo gobi also very enjoyable  owners don't always same thing buffet always nice surprise see they're serving day  paneer naan delicious could happily eat only rest life  <EOR> Boo place business  <EOR> the turdoori chicken good! place clean staff friendly! rice wasnt liking but wasn't bad  Also bf lunch buffet deal which ot wasn't bad  9 99 he rice lamb chicken some dessert thing bread oh rice  soup  See! bad deal! lol  go  place sort old school looking black white title pinkish decor but said very very clean  Oh meal also 9 dollars  Wasn't cheapest but meal 2  still full! <EOR> Dagnabit  around bragging much love Indian buffet carrying heavy obligation revisit some places used haunt before became card carrying Namaste fool! can't just tell everyone much love Indian buffet then them roll profile only find Namaste review 15 updates but friends just may future holds  only curb addiction long    Back day like 6 months ago India's Grill buffet hang  would least once week take advantage smallish but tasty most importantly cheap offering  Back then buffet $6 something included drink completely okay fact only 5 main curry offerings total  tasted good all well   I ran into Rob P other evening reminisced India's Grill he just great dinner there  back India's Grill train headed back buffet yesterday    The atmosphere odd more pizza parlor Indian restaurant but service always incredibly helpful kind  appreciate sink directly next buffet  If germaphobe might solution your buffet nightmares  wash your hands immediately before serve yourself without having into bathroom! I don't btw  swear don't  However once all spic span find smallish buffet now $9 something  only 3 vegetarian selections spinach option did excite taste buds  dal little soupy but flavor solid just hint spice  pumped because carrot dessert covet but more sour sweet finish  Man  made sad  definitely think if want experience best India's Grill offer should follow Rob P's lead restaurant com coupon dinner visit  know past visits food potential pretty delicious but now buffet really showcasing strength  Next Namaste buffet update  <EOR>
