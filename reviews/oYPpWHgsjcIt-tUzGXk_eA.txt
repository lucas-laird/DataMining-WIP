Oh Sammy baby   what happened you?  I bragging boyfriend big fan anything Pastrami finally time stop grub on   eh hem mean attempt to   We walk place order two LA style pastrami sandwiches order garlic fries large soda  He says $30 dollars am handing two coupon he says ugh then says OK $20 dollars  Yes shit he actually groaned UGH presenting coupon   Anyhow bad feeling start  guy sweating buckets he blinded sweat eyes he drops cup dirty ground picks fills it  Wow! He hands drink says 20 minutes    He did bother washing hands just handling money he begins throwing stuff grill order before ours This guy clearly did want working sure!  We stand side building where door kitchen open bad mistake bf started add all health violations    I embarrassed experience picking food previously world difference  Where mature sweet couple smiles behind counter at? people full life excited explain suggest menu items? thing past suppose? I swear waited 10 minutes still order started point all could think bad guy needs shower throw if see touch food bare hands seeing break health code upon health code violation   The kitchen disgusting once did see guy wash hands  behavior odd well he clearly angered having work seemed he slamming stuff around kitchen    We waited   waited   waited    and then point just flat disgusted walked right said would money back decided dine here  He said much give ? replied 20 00 he reached into pocket gave 20 00 nothing else said  He actually seemed happy he did bother making order   The end     What disappointment sure if sold business however tell beginning end them if keeps up!  I never back fact could pay come back hot mess once great operation!!!   So sad    <EOR> Another reason trust reviews Yelp trust those shows Food Network Travel Channel   starting question those shows   required say food world if place featured show? still scratching head over joint being top 10 Travel Channel's Food Paradise  fiancé saw show wanted try during trip Vegas last month     The food isn't bad per se but wasn't good enough where come back again   food way overpriced portions weren't big enough justify prices   sandwich each each shake shared garlic fries bill came $36?!?!?  mom pops burger joints SoCal offer same things fraction price   Seriously??? Nothing new here     The guy behind counter only person running joint due coworker being injury give major props being personable hospitable despite being busy himself   Thus 3 stars going above beyond customer service  But otherwise honestly I'd rather eat Hat back SoCal     I'm really starting question people's taste buds   SMDH  <EOR> Went Sammy's LA Pastrami work coworker he wanted try place based mostly positive feedbacks Yelp   driven past place awhile but just never urge try food served basically shack strip mall   Anyway when arrived few patrons already also lady line front highly recommends Cherry Frozen Lemonade   each order try ourselves I Strawberry coworker Pomegranate didn't think Strawberry flavor ordered any good but Pomegranate flavor good   For food Pastrami Burger single patty he ordered Pastrami Fries   burger itself just okay pastrami lacking flavor place features name restaurant   Pastrami Fries comes considered pretty good fries but lackluster pastrami kind killed me   end consensus agreed upon food better most fast food restaurants but below most diners   Seatings outdoors under umbrella which fine when weather super hot right now but can't imagine hanging long under hot sun during summer   So give 2 5 stars but still option but just 2 stars would low   generously rounding Sammy's LA Pastrami gets 3 stars me   But doubt would back anything other occasional Pomegranate Frozen Lemonade which know easily home just quick trip supermarket  <EOR> I don''t giving three stars but        goes   place kind scared when peeked place order person making everything looked messy kitchen area   can't really explain but reservations place   saw yelp pics thought maybe daughter give go   both thought pastrami best okay   lot great pastrami places LA  since LA signage thought must great but       nope wait back frequent visits LA pastrami fix   sorry Sammy's        Happy Yelping xoxoxox <EOR> Congratulations Sammy's officially earned another star me!
