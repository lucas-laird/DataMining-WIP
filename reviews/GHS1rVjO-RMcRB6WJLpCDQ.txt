Location easy find! <EOR> This favorite outlets United States   quite few high end brands selection great volume sales mean new stock comes all time   also new clean   Parking decent 2 big structures open lot also accessible via public transportation   The only drawback uncomfortable during summer winter due fact outdoor mall  <EOR> Okay love many different shops pretty day good weather its fun place be  Hate parking! Drove around 15 mins trying park tiny spaces traffic running everywhere  Its ant brigade waiting line park    They offer valet perhaps would better solution  Other wise think stick town Center fashion show  Every mall busy but takes cake worst parking set ugh!

Which don't quite understand age Uber  Plus taxi's line waiting customers again don't know line for   The real drawback place outdoors  many other people know LV temperatures each end spectrum  During winter gets pretty cold ideal  During summer its boiling! some mist sprays but doesn't help much  <EOR> Recomendable al 100% y no olviden hacer su check in para obtener una cuponera mitad de precio que es muy útil y aprovechas para ahorrarte unos dollares más todas las tiendas son muy buenas y en el área de comida aunque hacen falta asientos encuentras algo que te agrade  Visita y compara precios y trata de llevar ropa cómoda  <EOR> 6 18 16 I wanted check hype over Las Vegas Premium Outlets see if really great told  basically mall mid to high end stores discounts generally see stores    This place mostly outdoor mall which awesome pretty day much when blow dryer hot Vegas gets misters situated around shopping plaza    The food court okay nothing special but isn't place when want fine dining  All and all bad outlet mall  <EOR> A variety wonderful stores amazing people watch  Nike under armor asics adidas puma reebok great prices sportswear  Feeling hungry? chipotle spacious food court those love eat   Clothing? bit pricey no h m but Calvin Klein Columbia polo here  No more Kenneth Cole female attraction clothing    Auntie Anne's?

Only bad thing weather!!! Vegas! Why hot?! D <EOR> This place really far Vegas strip yet offers slew high end outlet stores Burberry Tory Burch Kate Spade etc along more contemporary everyday selections  Tip Traffic pretty bad around popular dates times I during Thanksgiving weekend Uber only drop off pick certain areas strictly reinforced! <EOR> I didn't find prices match other outlets same company  Premium Outlets Gulfport Ms much cheaper seemed more retail prices  But Vegas expect fork extra cash everything suppose   The parking made want jump off top garage  highly suggest installing speed bumps people driving all sorts crazy PASSING other vehicles high speeds garage security guards segways directed traffic no reason bottom floor  <EOR> The mall just imposes $5 parking fee residents cars  If happy unusual charge avoid mall  <EOR> Not best Premium Outlet but did most things looking for  Levi's Kids located branch south told   The shops located outside which nice when trying avoid death air conditioning  Sign ahead time VIP program on website free coupon book extra savings  Otherwise buy book few dollars  really worth though   Small food court but eat? Unless Cheesecake Factory <EOR> As far outlet malls far best within 100 miles! Before opened LV Premium Outlets Downtown used travel all way Primm any outlet shopping  Now just hop I 15 going other direction boom! am there!  Another great things LVPO variety high end stores  Personally means more girlfriend then does me  However happy girlfriend = happy me  <EOR> This place called outlet but junk   Prices same shopping regular stores   Nothing found   <EOR> I've worked stone's throw mega mall 10 years but never go  Well used until crowds much   I enticed return VEGAS mag sneak preview brand new Neiman Marcus Last Call store which within mall's latest expansion  major renovations mall since last visit years ago  addition Cheesecake Factory certainly increase number visits! Nice selection stores but don't find prices true outlet pricing much bargain  used true Outlet Malls past where bargains aplenty  course some stores good deals isn't half fun hunt? <EOR> It lovely day shopping las vegas outlet mall  time friend finished shopping visited bathrooms next info center awfully hot AC all therefore where also smelling very badly  strongly suggest people wait bathroom until different location  Hopefully whoever responsible fix because absolutely ruins nice day shopping! <EOR> Las Vegas North Premium Outlets outdoor outlet mall located just few minutes away Downtown Las Vegas Strip   Why outdoor malls desert?  Well beats because couldn't bear heat when outlets August shopping trip very short lived   imagine would more money cooler winter months because when once November spent almost entire day there   nice thing though outlets water misting sprays scattered around mall cool down heat   water spray light doesn't help whole lot but better nothing   last time also shave ice snow cone truck called Kona Ice help cool down              Despite mall being outdoors normally enjoy shopping here   lot good stores including Tory Burch sometimes store gets really packed people form line outside wait Rue21 Zumies Michael Kors Guess Factory Store Bebe even outlet store sells show tickets   There's food court few snack kiosks well       Overall timing everything outlets   If during summer find way tolerate heat   multiple parking lots structures but sometimes outlets busy may hard time finding stall   first time shopped no trouble finding parking   second time shopped circle lot few times find open stall   operating hours pretty good usually close 9 pm open major holidays Thanksgiving Christmas New Year's Day shorter hours   <EOR> This top outlets USA! come every time am Vegas always find some great deals  big selection stores men most notably Diesel Calvin Klein Kenneth Cole Energie all fitness brands Nike Puma Adidas DC Shoes  lack food options but don't come eat  come buy clothes! bonus new ACE Gold Line comes Strip! <EOR> I've both Premium Outlets North South trip found North wayyy better  back South  North Outlets newer better stores alot visitors shop there  sales people also nicer  North outlets outdoors open mall sucks when its really cold hot difficult follow map find stores sometimes  alil confusing navigating around  but its worth it South enclosed but just sucks all way around  older mostly locals shop alil more urban if know mean  Also both outlets carry different merchandise when same stores both found nicer things North Outlet  <EOR> Deals every store around every turn never gets old  Lots variety shops good mix luxury brands popular labels  Super easy stripe tons taxi available   Impressed restaurants opened nothing wrong food fair  but nice extra variety  <EOR> Great place quality stylish goods discount designer prices! <EOR> Great deals here!

Another thing mall fact overrun kiosks South outlet mall is  am fan mall kiosks begin with  all kiosk employees but decent number them jump yell carnival barkers  Try new hand scrub!

I managed find several great steals found prices comparable premium outlets back home yayy no Vegas premiums  many outlet mall staples including Coach Kenneth Cole Diesel Burberry Dooney Burke Guess etc  Pretty extensive food court mall setup out side plenty little rest areas throughout    The only caveat few stores didn't Premium Outlets home DC if near you're time pressed skip it! <EOR> This place HUGE! Apparently largest outdoor mall U S    I've coming many years everytime stop MUST check FCUK but closed down! = sad  did FCUK Fashion Show Mall but just same   Many top ends store awesome Hookah kiosk which almost suckered into buying Hookah  <EOR> This rating based stores but based parking    Unless you're Nevada resident pay parking  may only five bucks but why fee??? other mall Primm same great stores don't pay park   also its indoors keep cool while shopping <EOR> Outdoor outlets no fun summer heat   Great store selections   Lots good restaurants mall don't drive somewhere else eat  <EOR> I'm big fan outlet malls but enjoy location time time  outdoor aspect location  worst part mall parking  never seem able find anything close parking structures always nightmare  try park uncovered parking any cost    There few stores enjoy especially Coach Kate Spade Fossil Gap outlets  don't come often usually when friends visiting town when doing some last minute holiday shopping    All all pretty enjoyable shopping experience especially during weekdays when less busy  <EOR> We come almost every time if staying Vegas few nights   wife find nice gifts bargain prices   hardly ever leave empty handed   plenty stores parking   The best time come during middle week when school still session   less crowds better deals found   I would give them 5 stars but because outlet outdoors subtract star   summers unbearable here  <EOR> Wow outlet mall to!  Everything need probably have   Some stores no deals don't think purchase something just because outlet mall know may able better deal regular department store online   being said able find some great deals here   wouldn't normally 5 star rating but every employee ran into whether store outside very helpful pleasantly courteous   Very impressed  <EOR> Like all premium outlets you'll need whole day shopping   plus stores located buildings which close each other opposed being separated roads ALA Gilroy Premium Outlets   However no Mickey Ds Sbarros your burger fry pizza spaghetti fix going! <EOR>
