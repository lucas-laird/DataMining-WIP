Regardless really no excuse ungodly amount time took grilled cheese sandwich tomato soup  When food finally arrived sandwich tasted sitting kitchen while  Room temperature really unsatisfying especially waiting long finally eat  Needless say left irritated unsatisfied still hungry  <EOR> Food ok  Saturday morning waited 25mins seated  Once seated server extremely friendly explained all food options different choices ease  However price compared portion size great  Paid $14 small waffle didn't end filling didn't much flavor  hash scramble serve ok but warm upon arriving table  <EOR> I stopped Pantry mid afternoon snack Handcrafted Donut Holes Potato Wedges  donut holes excellent!!! 5 stars worthy wish I'd taken picture  Expertly made soft fluffy perfect amount sugar all around  order much bigger expected    good bang buck  wedges also good but ended being much food   On another visit ordered White Chocolate Brioche French Toast which excellent presentation mixed berries berry compote touch whipped mascarpone syrup  Unfortunately taste didn't match looks  bread didn't taste cooked fully berries didn't mix well syrup perhaps season French Toast didn't White Chocolate flavor advertised  waiter said bread lightly dusted white chocolate but if wanted actually taste chocolate should ordered chocolate pancakes  Question why use phrase White chocolate French Toast? plus side well portioned decent price a few other things menu steeper price category   I'd give dish 3 stars  <EOR> Top notch breakfast   Possibly best pancakes ever had   Smash Browns money   Fair price   Ate counter  Good service price fair considering your mirage   Didn't try lunch but breakfast give try  <EOR> Excellent spot brunch Vegas!

Open 24 hours day its convenient any staying there  me   My friend walked brunch  did wait long seated  just add fell love Pantry's decor  feels if walked into someones home  The service great but food     Food yummy  friend order soup day which sausage potato soup believe  Let just say regret ordering soup myself  taste wanted steal friend  good  corn beef hash yummy  Poached eggs slow cooked corned beef potato grain mustard hollandaise legit lets forget mimosa  happy camper   the only dish much fan BUT looked delicious look seared salmon  Roasted young potatoes vegetables arugula salad lemon vinaigrette Soup day   the lobster bisque ordered room service  salmon lacking flavor poor dab lemon vinaigrette tasted more mayo  potatoes also lacked flavor bit undercooked  lobster bisque lacking lobster  lobster bisque past pieces lobster soup  case soup  wasn't all bad but needed more lobster flavor  <EOR> This amazing    Started pretzels   waffle fries  buttermilk pancakes  the service great restaurant clean new! <EOR> This place horrible service  husband waited over 25 minutes shrimp grits  When party 5 showed served same time us  only 10 minutes  wasn't ready order  told husband ahead  waiter never came back us  left hungry husband dinner  <EOR> It's convenient because they're right next guest elevators Mirage they're open 24 hours  also two different happy hours which late 2am  However don't really large variety options  chicken wings but they're weren't impressive  bartenders happily whatever drink ask though good! <EOR> Great welcome addition Mirage  Just resort needed real 24 hour dining place  Carnegie Deli    Yes Vegas become very expensive dine reminds NYC South Beach place isn't cheap over top  $15 omelettes ain't bad version hash browns smash potatoes good  Perfectly cooked nice crust lots butter    Decorated nicely all white  Lines seem long but rather quickly  Service okay too    Good place diner type food  back  <EOR> I needed place pinch grab bite eat lunch before left Las Vegas  Staying Mirage only couple options choose we're still open  Carnegie deli other just didn't sound interest me   decided give Pantry try   say menu sounded good normally but couldn't find much time said gotta that   Instead Chicken Waffles basically 3rd time four days   wasn't bad   chicken little overdone but certainly very enjoyable   also priced very reasonably especially Vegas  While give three stars wouldn't hesitate recommend someone  looking fairly quick meal  certainly can't hold other more fancy restaurants but bad price especially if burning desire chicken waffles would recommend Hash hash over pantry <EOR> Had great dinner great drinks  dessert amazing too  Janel server she fantastic  she made night friends  if can't decide restaurant Mirage strip  <EOR> 4 stars food but good service if they're busy  actually just paid coffee left  did best sit everyone line but apparently cooks couldn't keep older waitress gave total attitude when said just wanted pay coffee leave  seen people came before still waiting food they're waitress told them 25 minute wait food  Wish would told us    plus waited over 10 minutes waitress even take order  worst attitude when said needed go  We'd eaten twice weekend but last trip want return  Now sit Starbucks    TI    eating delicious plastic bag pastry before 25 minute wait time would up  <EOR> Came around 11am Saturday wait 15 minutes prepared   ordered brioche French toast chefs omelet   French toast very good maybe even little rich   potatoes excellent but omelet little dry nothing special   biscuit excellent well   Giving 4stars eggs wait water even asking few times   defense always seem busy  <EOR> We came late night bite around 8 00pm Saturday night  comp wanted try variety dishes menu dessert but oven broken could receive warm caramel cookie skillet ice cream dessert   However ordered chicken waffle okay   Although wasn't entirely busy food seemed took awhile come out   also little difficult hear conversation noise hotel different conversations taking place inside restaurant almost drowned voices   However saving part place televisions behind bar   Now if come breakfast line long  Other restaurant fun nice place grab quick meal before heading upstairs your room  <EOR> Ask Janel caring nature expert waiting skills win over   your big sister

If come around Vegas morning time 11am prepared wait line  <EOR> Food pretty good but don't expect good efficient service  weekday really no where busy witnessed mornings weekend days  being seated quickly table waited 10 minutes before flag down looked manager  politely told long waiting no acknowledged she left take care it  She came back story waiter should servicing serving large group another table  Ok    when does mean ignore other tables your section? She proceeded take order  Later she came back admitted misunderstanding woman serving tables directly behind waitress  Lots excuses     Coffee good served pot your table  husband shared bakery 3 $10 deal 2 bagels mini donuts plus side bacon  waitress ultimately took care very nice just wish hadn't taken long acknowledged  mention those items came $28! Everything expensive strip   Interestingly enough man seated table next also being ignored told he eaten before service very poor slow    Maybe it'd better different time day but I'd say take walk Pool Cafe Mirage  better service better atmosphere! <EOR> It's food fabulous! server Maria best ever! She remembered day next very attentive! skinny egg white omelette delicious chocolate pancakes die for! <EOR> My husband along friends enjoyed few meals while stayed Mirage  Food delicious service friendly  French toast great appetizers  We'll back then next time we're Vegas  <EOR> Looooooove Pantry 24hr Kitchen Vegas!!
