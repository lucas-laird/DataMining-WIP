Ordered 2 med pizza's today 5 30 delivery didn't till 6 35  Slow delivery   even 1 4 mile away  Wouldn't pay it  <EOR> Ordered pizza wings few hours ate stomach churning pain  Long story short toilet best friend couple hours  Thanks papa johns <EOR> Worst pizza ever  Cheese came cold but when heated never did melt  use? Never again <EOR> I ordered pizza today always order well done  don't raw mushy dough under cheese cheese nice brown  online order quoted 31 minutes 2 10pm  order arrived time taste call store complain 2 27pm    The cheese white barely melted crust white dough middle raw  called store complain course offered remade pizza   Unfortunately didn't time wait really frustrated anyway    I told oven isn't working when put oven well done comes burnt can't it  Well serving raw pizza isn't really exciting either   Why does pizza shop clearly requires working oven ovens work?  why would just assume would ok eating something  ordered?  If put pepperoni would just send pizza chicken?   Also can't help but wonder if true they're just paying attention?  did online order transmit prepared cooked boxed drove upstairs third floor apartment signed bill inside grabbed drink sat down opened pizza saw pizza still tasted called complain less 20 minutes?!?  The clerk answered told he'd put name log free pizza next time  Great know already looking forward next pizza NOT!  should just refunded money credit card  Why would want order again store where doubt truthfulness?  if telling truth why operating broken oven anyway?    Papa Johns suffering y'all  Looks they're following same path once tasty Pizza Hut Dominos  guess happens big can't manage quality anymore  Might time look next great pizza chain     maybe just stick local place  <EOR> Got pizza few weeks ago   went new one   still doughy   phone guy wasn't really nice   I won't back  <EOR> Ordered Medium Crust Spinach Alfredo Pizza Chicken Onions Chicken Poppers  Food delicious thank goodness because first time  delivery guy very kind well  Overall good experience  <EOR>
