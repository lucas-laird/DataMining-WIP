Honestly unless speak Chinese store basically point want prepare frustrated ordering phone! <EOR> This place should glad good food  worst customer service  when restaurant China Town don't know Mandarin things difficult  But only place where half staff can't communicate English  reason sucks because if need attention rather someone help just ignore you  wife just put off place because this  food quality no longer justifies crappy service   but if speak Mandarin would suggest here  <EOR> When want ear somewhere reminds home come china mama  Just assume everything perfect  just list favorites Ra mein szechwan sauce Pot stickers Juicy pork dumplings Fried rice cake spicy chili Green onion pancake Steamed red bean dumpling dessert Mapo tofu I don't tofu even LOVED dish Chicken veggies Szechuan hot pot Beef roll Pork tripe hot spicy sauce  It all good even better left over  <EOR> I heart Green Onion Pancakes!

If haven't tried suggest ASAP!! boyfriend beef roll soupy pork dumplings fish spicy garlic sauce!  Everything amazing!! returning very soon! <EOR> I called order beef noodles wide noodles beef rolls  picked 10 minutes later already done! Prices bit high side compared used     $9 99 per item  beef rolls decent think pancake wrap beef bit thick strong hoisin oyster sauce flavor meat  liked beef broth but wide noodles clumped together when home tried eat eating dense ball noodles  wasn't pleasant all    The restaurant itself lot seating staff friendly but next time dining instead ordering take out  <EOR> did enjoy restaurant all   food very bland    felt fast food chinese restaurant  won tons small little meat tasteless   much better choices china town  mike s henderson <EOR> Last night 23 dinner China Mama's most first time   loved it!

The Pork Chow Mein different taste most unusual orange color   favorite     Shrimp Fried Rice uses all white rice very little seasoning   Very few shrimp  order   Won Ton Soup just okay   much flavor but still good   would recommend other soups   The bowls dry noodles passed around table upon seating I guess supposed dip them plum sauce very stale    No matter wanted FOOD     All all agreed food excellent no EVERYTHING menu   all would back again sure since we're locals   way service all 23 party received exceptionally good  <EOR> Not bad!  famous Xiao Lung Bao worth its reputation least when went   filling good burst hot broth inside cool novelty fresh ginger side even better   also ate pan friend Shanghai dumplings which nice green onion flavor along cripsy fried dough taste   didn't blow mind but fine   wouldn't drive across town them   ate spicy pig ear appetizer which offers something fairly unusual nice price less $5   heaping dish cold slices stir friend pig ear which crunch reminiscent tripe drenched chili oil I think sesame oil   fun eat pig ear but flavor little boring   think better quality chili oil could difference   Last least ate salt and pepper squid which came deep fried fluffy tempura like batter   salt all right but sure if any pepper   also some fried garlic green onion   kind boring but least squid nice tender hard chew   Everything fine staff nice there's nothing really bad say it   just didn't rock me   saw some people getting huge dishes Kung Pao chicken other whitey treats know give your money's worth   If I'd recommend bring friend few smaller dishes dumplings etc instead full on entrees   Also try sure don't many dishes rely green onion flavor because China Mama seems pretty crazy green onion don't want end having private green onion festival your table  <EOR> Soup dumpling okay  Didnt really taste soup but just plain porky broth  ordered some salt pepper shrimp thinking would 12 13 bucks  But came 20 dollars  fairly good shrimp but surely worth inflated price  Overall see place slightly better quality then run mill chinese joint  But definitely proportionate way doubled pricing justified  <EOR> Last night family dinner  When arrived empty dirty table which took waitress 20 minutes clean  time arrived table ordered prices more expensive SGV  food phenomenal but service should improve  <EOR> This def favorites

Asian restaurant doesn't give rice entrees?!! top all off food terrible  should've know when whole bag soaked oil  Never again! No rice    seriously? <EOR> They just written awarded NPR magazine rightly proud  busy juicy pork dumplings green onion pancakes but still wildly impressed kung pao chicken sesame pancake beef noodle soup  dining companion thought soup looked scary but still loved it! Can't wait back  Why Scary? Dark rich concentrated super tender beef slices fresh green leaves really looked no other soup seen Las Vegas chinese restaurants  Charlie really great waiter too no Amex accepted <EOR> Not good Chinese food!  The fiancé decided check mama china featured las Vegas weekly soup dumplings    We past Sunday night  restaurant itself nice enough few other tables dining besides ours    We immediately put off 3 menus handed us  3 menus? Red flag right there   should've known better right then but already decided give shot  We ordered soup dumplings beef roll hot n sour soup hot n spicy chicken shrimp fried rice mapo tofu   The best thing shrimp fried rice   actually enjoyed it   mapo tofu ok   fiancé liked beef roll both found dumplings very rich melted pork fat pretty flavorful   best but worst either   hot sour soup tasted watered down!  Maybe if another few hours reduce might tasted better  spicy chicken dish which recommended waitress straight nasty! Unedible   little bits breaded chicken fried tossed mound red chilis   Oddly though chicken itself spicy   fiancé literally tried piece each did touch that! tasted cardboard am exageratting!  Needless say ton leftovers did take home us!  There nothing wrong service just food problem!  left feeling pretty nasty all sodium grease fat consumed didn't even eat much!  Yuck going back! <EOR> Definitely best dumplings had   beef noodles really good though! <EOR> The food fantastic tonight but zero service  seated ourselves waiting 10 minutes no eye contact staff   notified waitress seating ourselves   She brought menus food then sat sat waiting check when finished   husband ready walk without paying when finally just walked over waitress again told needed check   Honestly many tables plenty wait staff but whole timing way off   couple next ordered food long but ended just watching eat food never came   would just walked out   left before ever served  felt bad them!   Next time we're town we're trying somewhere else   search another soup dumpling place once again  <EOR> The best Las Vegas?  sure happened  ordered Mongolian beef combination chow mein  beef alright but noodle dish inedible  sesame oil used made noodles taste vomit dish's overall orange color only helped cement analogy  never back  <EOR> Beef roll chicken three sauces basil bok choy mushroom bamboo shoots  All amazing  First time eating stoked everything  <EOR> Worst establishment ever to  Broccoli beef salty  Garlic basil chicken smell burnt  Forgot 2 orders try charge bill  When bought them  said cooked already  told them no guys didn't bring please take off bill  Staff clueless restaurant service  going no more  <EOR> Food good  Service sucks  soup dumplings OK  spicy hot oil numbing fish very good  food but don't expect any service  Price higher other Chinese places  <EOR> Personally blow away food here   decent small Chinese restaurant   beef rolls   mildly sweet definitely highlights   didn't specialty pan fried buns much because tasted little bitter but kind enough only pork buns since am allergic shrimp   I pork chop rice which little bland   may try beef noodles next time   The reason gave 4 stars because dad loves place   He raves combination noodle bowl saying nostalgic made feel own cat ear noodles pretty good   Service good you'd expect Chinese restaurant    <EOR> This favorite chinese food Las Vegas far!!! Xiao Long Bao must order everytime  <EOR> Loved environment food  Especially management took over   Definitely making regular spot me  <EOR> I say food good but service really bad  worst service ever received  first waited 10 minutes seated even though tons table available  Apparently waiter waitress busy even noticed us  Then ordering process painful because waited another 15 minutes before waiter waitress could come let order  did even bring any water us  Finally deciding which dishes order two people talking waitress same time waitress just told us shut up! need speak one  say never experienced situation any waitress told customers shut ! would definitely recommend against place especially when Las Vegas already many other places serve good Asian good  <EOR> try xlb beef noodle soup onion pan cake shanghai rice cake food service par price little high compare some others valley portion small too <EOR> I China Mama every time LV which couple times year  very authentic great value  Most time great service once while service bit slow  If decide order soy milk ready wait fresh takes least 30 mins! big bowl individual serving   Pretty much everything menu good  deep fried intestines best!

We headed over seated looked menu server Shanghainese man seemed quite pleased speak home dialect me   They don't salty soy milk if want sweet soy milk add sugar yourself  bring bowl plain soy milk  which fine because added some vinegar soy sufficed  best but worked   The XLB arrived right soymilk immediately knew wouldn't very good  few pierced through all juicy liquid oozed out  picked XLB put thing mouth dipping into vinegar  hmmmm   piece meat dense  definitely good enough come back just but followed turned really wonderful surprise   Potstickers arrived biting into completely sold! some most perfect potstickers ever  crispy bottom still succulent everywhere else  wrapper wasn't thick filling small  pretty damn good!  Sheng jian bao don't know called English little buns which contain pork  anything perfect US  bottom crispy top perfect pillowy softness bao  Most places would steam bun first then fry buns when order  wrong way cook these  name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying bun its raw format  fry raw bun pan add liquid close lid 'steam' bun cooks filling top part bun remove lid wait until bottom dry remove serve    And know done correct way? Well certain crust forms bottom around bun ones it  other sign bun part pillow when bite into them hard dense those might find dim sum where steam buns then pan fry them   Definitely some best sheng jian baos ever!

Plus bf really wants order squirrel shaped fish dish just see heck means     <EOR> Ok first off food ok good   only reason why give restaurant extra star  service horrible when went! First all only few families other should no problems getting food cooked right? Wrong! forgot fried sesame balls almost done eating when decided enough  called waiter down asked it  Before could even explain though he just hurriedly said yeah yeah cooking rushed over help new just entering customers  Did he even know talking about??? Then actually saw male waiter talking another waiter probably how they forgot menu items  basically done eating already decided just leave ask check without sesame balls  But waiter just said wait! coming coming just hand takes while  YEAH RIGHT! almost guarantee don't mix flour then them right kitchen  More forgot order! If busy might more tolerable  However hardly any people now know why  Finally very end all pretty fed them already but made pay iPad   bad part  fact stood over shoulder looked many tips left them  iPad forces pay least 15% tips them  LEAST!
