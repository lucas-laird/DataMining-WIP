heavenly all way through   I also lucky enough try Michael K  ordered  actually started off those first taste being nice piece apple pie he requested topped green tea ice cream  delight use puff pastry fuji apple two favorites quite possibly best apple pie you'll find around Vegas  believe described really really good  also tasted bit custard atop thin layer sponge cake which also very good practically half cannoli crepe which overly sweet but still treat ricotta cheese crunchy pistachio bits semi sweet chocolate pieces  Finally tried green tea eclair white chocolate topping almost could white chocolate touch green tea powder itself   I few more treats fridge waiting recover food coma confident enjoy those well  UPDATE 4 30 14 custard pudding awesome yuzu panna cotta relatively restrained yuzu flavor  won't qualify recommendation sweets whatever Suzuya must try period  <EOR> This place just nice day  coming something someone else cause know they'll happy    everything before being Asian always favor towards asian ingredients green tea azuki bean etc   love close house only thing don't wish open earlier sometimes! <EOR> This place amazing  takes back all wonderful patisseries Japan  especially love tiramisu sake macarons but everything tried excellent   love having piece Japan right Vegas  <EOR> I love Suzuya could eat every day  All staff really sweet just pastries  hands down best crepes Vegas  crepes soft melt your mouth all ingredients taste high quality  definitely recommend Millecrepes my personal favorite Green Tean Anko Rocky Road crepe chocolate cake  All desserts sweet if aren't dessert person sweet tooth you'll still enjoy bakery very much  desserts aren't costly serving just right  Suzuya absolutely perfect! <EOR> Suzuya bit drive strip but being only Japanese French bakeries town well worth making trek here!  Each pastry speaks themselves only pretty look but all delicious well   You never wrong pate choux cream puffs offer variety different flavors green tea matcha being favorite but often walk into pastry shop slice mille feuille crepe cake   know much work into constructing crepe cakes?!?  literally layers layers paper thin crepes each separated brush French pastry cream   When place Suzuya offers many different flavors strawberry matcha tiramisu mango etc   you literally hit jackpot!   I seriously wished Suzuya closer home order them all time   Thank making tummy smile your wonderful elegant desserts  <EOR> This japanese pastry shop tucked away southwest Vegas but worth drive  What's great Japanese pastries confections typically sweet most other places   It delicate balance such delectable deserts but well  <EOR> Intrigued idea Japanese crepes vs French crepes tried today original brunch locale switched only serving brunch Sundays   We tried savory ham cheese crepe strawberry crepe  Both very tasty  crepe itself light cream delicious  I'd liked more strawberry flavor but good   No bakery could tell difference between 2 versions suppose doesn't really matter but why just say crepes instead adding location?  We took hope 4 pack treats give town guests tonight   The down side? bit pricy hours city never sleeps bit off personally bit schlep  <EOR> we've pretty regular customer Suzuya but lately impressed   decided try whole bean coffee try other 3 cafe shops where bought other coffee bag always offer complimentary brew coffee any coffee bean purchase but Suzuya doesn't it   mean much does cost them just brew coffee especially regular customers? also price written coffee bag board different coffee bag says $13 but board says $15 when asked why difference price said cheaper price wholesale price maybe should consider update price bag doesn't confuse customer   much love dessert feel customer service more important anything  <EOR> Literally walked 4 00pm still ton pastries people ordering lady literally called sorry we're closed! WHAT!!! Really!? 4 00pm dot still plenty pastry people your turning away!?!?? Clearly don't need business cause more enough  NEVER COMING BACK! <EOR> This place AMAZEBALLS!
