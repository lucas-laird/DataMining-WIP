This place amazing! Tons food price fried ice cream die for  would highly recommend  <EOR> Went tonight husband  Chips salsa brought table quickly  chips good thick came nice sized bowl which good because refills bowl cost $4  never Mexican restaurant where extra chips cost money  happen love chips salsa but paying $4 it  salsa chunky spicy without being much couldn't eat I'm pretty wimpy when comes spice!   should mention thinking ordering nachos share appetizer but cost came almost $20 full order add ons beans jalapenos chicken steak  guess $11 nachos themselves just chips cheese? upcharge meat but charges beans jalapenos? decided against it  Both hubby ordered fajitas  He steak fajitas the menu said marinated which waitress told tri tip  chicken  ordered them well done  well done meats especially love vegetables well done blackness  fajitas come soup noodle albondigas soup which vegetable soup meatballs salad rice beans sour cream guacamole $16 29  husband salad  salad very small  came plate another restaurant would bread plate  He blue cheese dressing said good but nothing special  LOVE albondigas soup that  soup came bowl which much larger comparison salad plate  Weird proportions  soup looked great but very little flavor  Another big disappointment  Finally fajitas  cooked perfectly! vegetables blackened both steak chicken well done  very pleased because order well cooked vegetables EVERY Mexican restaurant seldom cooked way like  couldn't wait eat! Unfortunately next BIG disappointment means won't going back  meats vegetables while cooked perfectly seasoned ALL! whole point fajitas fajita seasoning  Remember menu said marinated? know because checked tasting food  If steak marinated then I'd hate taste unmarinated meat! steak tasted dried liver  Yeah asked well done dry risk take but liver flavor? No sure did taste tri tip me! flavorless asked A1 steak sauce edible! chicken marginally better but again no seasoning  sour cream guacamole came small bowl but seemed good sized portion each guac tasty even though didn't see any chunks tomato onion  No cheese came fajitas which surprising  rice refried beans standard  don't happen can't speak good were  almost gave place two stars way cooked fajitas but just couldn't because flavor lacking  service fine  waitress prompt taking order but didn't see again until check  However least three other staff members bidding fill water glasses give napkins bring steak sauce etc  didn't feel loss  sad can't find fajitas flavorful cooked way like  search continues  El Burrito definitely crossed off list places revisit! <EOR> On LAST FINAL trip bought groupon decided take mother there  ordered 2 rolled tacos al carte mom chili relleno al carte both approx $6 each chimichanga al carte approx $10  manager owner very cold couldn't  seemed bothered  rolled tacos average when he dropped off plate flat chili relleno warned mother SCOLDING HOT plate was! When she tried move plate closer she actually burned fingers  almost didn't believe hot when touched myself  crazy owner manager actually heard say Ouch just looked then just walked away!  The relleno flat bland 2 rolled tacos minis price both very disapointed  chimichanga father when brought home he actually took 3 bites couldn't eat anymore  Said pretty disappointing bland well      KICKER     owner manager actually guts charge mom mandated gratuity approx 18%! husband purchased couple groupons particular restaurant never charged before  ALSO looking fine print said alcohol gratuity included  No where did say would additional charge over 18%! When bill almost 10$ higher   asked come back over charge ? He told mandatory always charged groupons  told never charged before he actually told wrong should charged  bought phone actually fine print right read where said alcohol gratuity included  He started argue very rude asking see where said pay ? please don't wrong tipping believe its over tipping     Especially am tipping business myself then he very snide said well ill take off time he call groupon sure add fine print when he couldn't find when he grabbed phone looked well!
