If your feeling daring want try something different Mango Roll which sweet refreshing  if want something little more familiar tempura roll maybe you'll want something  artery clogging goodness deep fried roll? I recommend getting half orders try different rolls without getting full! sashimi fresh presentation beautiful side dishes range spicy udon noodles baked muscles  Desserts also really nice way end meal  Ice cream mochi cheese cake ice cream 2  Music  personal preference but don't when restaurant silent  When restaurant silent if feels weird talking because sounds loud  music ranges K Pop todays hottest hits little bit everything if may   3  Staff  people really great  feel whenever someone's eating AYCE place maybe someone runs water  generally would REALLY hard flag someone down because they're busy other tables  But really amazing being really nice attentive  generally all orders nothing gets forgotten if happens really rare    Sushi Kaya little pricy but great food catchy music awesome staff  believe worth try  <EOR> Came walking Jjanga  Good service decent food  Won't regular here  Even sushi mostly good some rice tasted old cooked right didn't stick together properly also didn't feel right when chewing  couple rolls funky spicy fish weird texture off putting  rice texture other things mentioned back  <EOR> Although All EAT sushi joint fish quality actually pretty good   head sushi chef knows he doing   selection crazy AYCE definilty place eat some rolls nigiri great price   I ate sashimi plate some highest quality fresh fish Las Vegas   quality    The service OK nicest people world always put off bit when nice people work sushi places   C service  The worst part place music   Some worst heard while     Overall palce nice find Chinatown  <EOR> AYCE well worth while   All food good   Sashimi Poke great!

<EOR> Extremely disappointed  totally letting quality service received outweigh food  If you're mood good food don't mind crappy customer service then place suit just right    I've sushi kaya many times past wasn't always impressed customer service  main reason come back decent pricing good food  even birthday dinner last year  sushi selection good AYCE menu variety appetizers tapas  can't remember much lunch AYCE price but dinner $25 which pretty competitive compared other sushi joints around town  Aside food service totally way ruined likes place  They're open until 3am but last call 2 15am  opted AYCE because 2am 15 minutes definitely enough time order crap ton food  ended getting stuff regular menu kimchi fried rice $8 95 four pieces agedashi tofu $5 95 while couple friends did AYCE  While friends ordering waiter kept interrupting them saying allowed share food myself another friend since ordering stuff regular menu  could tell he happy doing AYCE right before closing time  just huge disappointment  If you're gonna offer hours service until specific time decency honor uphold it! pretty quick bringing food but  probably because only guests aside couple seated little before us  Near end meal came ask doing  friends missing couple orders check  waiter argued received orders already defaulted blame server excusing because she's still training  Regardless fact she new he should argued us  professional any means  finished eating continued sit chit chat but noticed extremely cold around 2 40ish  sure if cranked a c if just door open  paid bill still 20 minutes left before closing time  probably should left right away since knew closing but middle great conversation which interrupted waiter  He came over tell leave because closing  totally understand but very awkward  He didn't walk away table until leave  gonna camp all night   I wasn't happy walking there  probably come back again but definitely first choice  <EOR> Accidentally found Sushi Kaya turned amazing gem    Best sushi buffet ever <EOR> This AYCE Sushi restaurant favorites  sister brother's spot if hungry want meet since very central all 3 us  service quick attentive  SOME favorites white tuna yellowtail tuna nigiri Jose roll Shrek roll baked mussels  great place chill talk especially if need catch up  recommend place everyone because service food always consistent  <EOR> Las Vegas lot sushi restaurants range very cheap AYCE top end al la carte   always true pay for   Having good fortune travel all over Japan work 25 years experienced lot authentic Japanese sushi   Now living Vegas am frequently disappointed many valley sushi restaurants   Sushi Kaya SURPRISED IMPRESSED me   dinner last night chilly rainy night restaurant crowded other Yelp reviewers reported   atmosphere comfortable inviting two hostesses wait staff chefs all made feel welcomed   menu mix traditional American sushi all good way   But want report sushi chefs know respect fish   Its temperature refrigerator cold actually taste flavor fish   same true rice tell recently prepared fluffed   don't enjoy old rice packed mortar    The last thing want note many rolls order half roll   great if want try several rolls don't want fill few   Sushi Kaya offers loyalty card repeat visits earn free AYCE   Nice but necessary sushi restaurant return enjoy more great sushi fix     For dinner price $24 95 Sushi Kaya more paid compared many other valley sushi restaurants  <EOR> Beware woman's toilet left  doesn't currently work  didn't work when 4 months ago  <EOR> Kaya bookmarked list some time now  large selection rolls but majority them listed spicy contain mostly same ingredients  nigiri selection decent fish pieces huge    AYCE dinner $27 think would enjoyed myself bit more if sat table rather sushi bar  Servers grab orders off top bar lot hustle bustle shouting interrupts dining experience  big deal since sitting bar meant having wait long but something consider    Sushi pretty fresh but didn't anything really stood out  actually leaning toward 3 5 stars because Kaya solid sushi spot   just nothing special opinion  <EOR> Yeah  Don't come especially all eat   service godawful   First round waitress simply ignored me   Subsequent rounds crap shoot whether food   ordered grand total seven items two them before talking manager bugging out  <EOR> Ate last day Vegas trip wish found place sooner   first thought order pay kind place which would kind expensive but surprised all your eat Sushi place   lunch 19 95 all eat lunch!

Gracefully grabbing cash hand look despair silence concluded query!!   One great thing town friend free horrible lunch which don't mind paying for     <EOR> My kids turned place friends ours locals   sushi superb variety endless  also good price all eat sushi especially lunchtime the price dinner    only reason Sushi Kaya gets four stars instead five because always wait but much room wait because when busy hard attention server more dishes while eating all you can eat  <EOR> This place fun always pretty busy  waited over half hour eat before prepared because small side    The food really good favorite roll sex bomb  menu very large many choices lot fun rolls unique flavors them  When group order half menu fun try bunch different items    I'm new sushi still experimenting but mostly everything except some raw choices spicy tuna mushy me    Dessert also great favorite ice cream almond mocha!!!!!!!

Parking might hard find if you're during busy hours since same complex other great restaurants  <EOR> Convenient location located close Strip right next main Chinatown plaza  Although live NW side town still convenient given often drive inner city    Fast friendly customer service bf around 6 30 seated soon approached reception desk  Food came quickly well since assumed wouldn't because bar looked full time  first time servers answered all questions regarding specials appetizers   Creative names nice presentation sushi rolls did enjoy reading through names most sounded very appetizing  would've taken pictures but time starving wasn't really mind  would definitely return try more though   Spacious nicely decorated restaurant personally think menu look should updated suit restaurant's authentic environment  High ceilings traditional Japanese decorations really nice look at  Compared other sushi restaurants amount space between tables more enough burst your personal bubble    So 5 stars everything except parking lot but  Chinatown right? <EOR> All eat sushi heaven  Soft shell crab galore!

They did couple unique rolls couple unique appetizers   your daddy which order no cream cheese no yum sauce eel sauce joke took normal piece shrimp which pounded thin split into 4 pieces wtf? know trying save cost fill u imitation crab tempura batter + rice but quite unnecessary  I would never back but don't regret going there  Blue Fin    <EOR> I called ask whether crowded  person spoke said no would crowded because Wednesday night  drove all way over 30 minute wait  would've preferred given accurate information over phone  daughter tired then drive all way over Sushi Way  end day Sushi Way fantastic  Good food fast service  <EOR> This place came 2nd otherwise would given 5 stars  always pretty good service food did try few things didn't but overall still very good    It just little difficult lately because stay away raw foods but overall    However place does come order sashimi per person which nice because haven't seen very many places that! <EOR> I've fan sushi kaya good few years now they're three sushi places frequent take friends especially late nights  quick service course great food    I figured write review few weeks last visit because hope if already fixed issue  meal while finishing noticed little cockroach crawl bar next friends hand  Now grew third world country things type things nuts  quietly grabbed little bugger napkin told busser it  He saw apologized left   Now point expecting manager come apologize  didn't  Again used bugs being around dining table growing friend continued enjoy afternoon big fuss it  paid bill left    It wasn't until car when realized should done more  Spoken manager something that  did call them told manager exactly happened  even told them don't worry we're making big deal want free meal anything just want something it    This happens August 12 11  <EOR> This place nice  roomy great big groups  service A OK  rolls good although when daughter's california roll served couldn't believe much rice used roll she  hard time eating it    This place also clear waste food even rice your roll sure eat order! not said anything since ate everything    Everything good except roll ate tasted kinda fishy  Fish shouldn't taste fishy quality fish questionable    I 2 hours daughter don't think time limit?  I would back because love mussels Jose roll  = <EOR> I long day work super hungry  greeted girl she all smiles good  quickly drink started ordering  all eat price $22 95  thought reasonable  ordered mostly appetizers since look more interesting then sushi selection  admit most food spicy really spicy  Which turn off since bite mouth numb couldn't taste anything else that    After first round food gobbled still very hungry needed more food right away  server asked if she could anything replied yes would order more food  She smiled off another table  sitting 30 minutes know coz timing this  same girl came asked if wanted some thing else?  point beyond angry started telling off  Then she nerve tell well now would like?   Right then asked check!  Then she asked if already full?  thought self r u kidding me!!  service restaurant embarrassment especially economy  All she apologize sincere instead she give lip  Well spoke manager she said she sorry didn't feeling she sincere about  feeling happens all time routine situation then  manager ask if wanted money back?  because felt nobody sincere said yes please   if giving money forget it  even keep speaking it  Well another thing coming  kind situation should never happen servers needs trained properly  <EOR> And winner very first review to    PLACE    Why? very first AYCE sushi joint consistently gone over past two years discovering despite lack check ins course because really come love specialty rolls appetizers nigiri here   Like any sushi place tried end loving most awkwardly named rolls say loud menu Sex Bomb fave here  other usuals Brooklyn Bridge Wall Street Mango Style  Salmon nigiri always refreshing well white tuna  fallen into habit getting side garlic ponzu sauce dip them in  Spicy garlic ponzu sometimes too! BEST beef skewers tender flavorful but infamous *one order per person* list I LOVE PLUM WINE ICE CREAM  End story   In general actual restaurant nice decently spaced  tables would think receive lot neglect because its placement don't! all call buttons press prevent happening  decorated nicely pretty Christmas lights year round funny Japanese masks laugh if stare long   Service pretty speedy except when busy but  expected  Good price AYCE stamp cards! All all better end sushi places Chinatown area Vegas  Recommended sure! <EOR> I am loyal sushi spot    recently ended because open until 3am Friday night  check out  Price wise standard AUCE places  thing place service  your typical pay kicking ASAP type sushi place  small wait but worth it  5 stars service alone  quality food itself top notch even 1am !! Def give place shot next time craving late night sushi  <EOR> Cons 1 Fresh sushi 2 quality service so 3 smell restaurant good   Pros 1 welcoming kind song never see before  <EOR> I've quite few times since first visit mainly because stamp card keeps getting filled groups with   The price pretty good deal  $19 95 lunch $22 95 dinner includes list special rolls appetizers nigiri even dessert    The service actually gotten very polite friendly fast since first visit which why giving them another star    The sushi may BEST town but definitely good appetizers even better    I really place gives stamp card big incentive keep coming back  restaurant also very nice clean which always plus  Whenever bring visitors town they're really impressed because hard find places ayce sushi along appetizers SoCal    I'm glad place improved since first visit  sure keep coming back  <EOR> Been coming 3 years now service recently just past year terrible  today put names down party six hostess more later took down number incorrectly  waiting outside called 30 minutes since waiting area unbelievably small decided check wait time she said she called number gave five times knowing she took down wrong  waiting inside another 20 minutes she decided give table  say decided because over heard tell server she only gave table soon because kept bothering her  First all rude unprofessional say anyone let alone customer  Second all literally only job seat people she couldn't even right  returning because hostess  big family lose some good business  anyone reading recommend umiya sushi prices lower less crowded service great! Doesn't hurt sushi also really good <EOR> But all u eat comeon now ?   best deal far sushi very fresh tasty     heart china town strip mall Spring Mountain Arville   sushi fresh well prepared spiced enough but much drinks cold   Solid stuff value   some! <EOR> We came friends 21st bday lil packed Tuesday night  20 minute wait  Service decent bobas while waiting told couldn't them normally but didn't see them let keep them  let friend eat all eat herself while rest al la carte which thought cool restraints don't normally that    It pretty busy night servers seemed really busy  food 10 15 minutes which bad busy was  Chinatown restaurants always quite busy just cause such small area best Asian restaurants usually here  place lil pricy bad  came because couple friends recommended it  But think lil over hyped honest    There's another sushi restaurant area called jjanga Japanese restaurant great sushi great price  lil off spring mountain china town crowded  <EOR> I've tried many sushi places around town  can't say best but definitely best  hadn't awhile until today realized missed more knew  usually fill more appetizers rolls  favorite appetizers are seaweed salad bacon asparagus skewer baked mussels shrimp tempura cajun albacore seared tuna i order side ponzu sauce dipping favorite rolls Amigo!!

Don't spend lot good quality sushi AYCE <EOR> Can't speak others but would give establishment 'No Star' rating if could  rather undemanding customers enjoy dinners restaurant own pace expect servers run around frivolously tips least 20% if more   pick any restaurant if simply OK  But unbearable simply cannot hold back opinion someone works butt off customers living  music loud some sort Korean pop music rather fast beat  Sushi very Zen food which supposed enjoyed rather serene environment isn't it? service absolutely horrible busiest time night several empty tables many servers running around but nobody came hand menu nor asked drink orders  wanted leave but diabetic husband started showing signs low blood sugar going another sushi restaurant just beyond moment  number failed attempts server finally them decided stop took drink order right he left another server decided hop asked again drink order  sat Sushi Bar Sushi chef standing right front but instead starting take orders he completely ignored us  waved several times he finally reluctantly came over said' give your orders your server you  WTF??????You've bureaucracy going when most if all other sushi chefs take care customers sitting front them directly along servers assisting drinks  drinks finally came server ready walk away without asking we'd want food  strange asked if he should would take sushi orders he told sushi chef would take order directly since sitting sushi bar  Ooooookkkkkk  Seems sushi chef spoken server no clue if lying us  Then chef server conversed between themselves front Korean server then took orders walked away  told doing AYCE  expecting orders should come gradually but man o man servers dropped all orders front same time   at sushi bar!! very embarrassing all plates spread spaces next thank Lord no sitting next sushi bar  yakitori tiny but OK sushi rice soft sticky if put much water rice when cooking which no more just being edible  ordered two orders Uni sushi each uni OK  came insult  the chef told allowed only order per person   wasn't freaking menu? never wanted order another round because 1 uni delicacy staple 2 expensive ingredient AYCE fellow business owners certainly understand matter numbers don't want restaurant lose money!! chef way give freaking 'warning'?  did order second round other sushis rolls   a server wrote down all orders piece paper ran back  orders never came! flagged down another server follow orders answer did orders!!!

Duramos mas de media hora esperando que trajeran el sushi los primeros platos rapido pero despues de ahi nadie te hace caso la manager dio muy mal servicio al cliente no regreso jamas <EOR> Let start saying love AYCE places however never good AYCE sushi until Sushi Kaya  While positives let begin fact most rolls REALLY GOOD best advice would half rolls way try different rolls Also little ice cream end pretty good   Now let's talk reasons why might returning place  First all service somewhat slow friendly It may just language barrier if water empty more 5 minutes then issue  Second when rolls started coming play guessing game trying figure which which since server just dropped them off without saying word gets frustrating while since several rolls look really similar   finally probably biggest negative place cracked chipped plates  other reviewers already mentioned majority plates cracked chipped scared food safety perspective especially when talking uncooked meats sushi    Overall good place try once but probably won't back  <EOR> I going Kaya 5 years now wow didn't think long   fell inlove first time went!  $20 $25 all eat sushi wonderful service! always least 6 people running around helping customers even if table section assigned    Only down side would say place kind small busy definitely think should expand!   Other tables spacious comfy again amazing service food DIE FOR!!

REALLY???  pay much least 5 pieces more everywhere else   guess because posh think three enough two people   should've ordered more may fault   Twenty minutes later plate comes lots chicken pickled radish mixed carrots shredded cabbage heap ketchup mayo latticed top  see pic Interesting but definitely korean fried chicken   mean technically because where bought but terms prepared came definitely not   The chicken fried DEATH  leather easier chew   crust very crispy but won't save leather within   love picked radish but there's definitely frozen thawed somehow before serving because ton ice left dish mixed radish   Freaky   never seen restaurant use frozen daikon maybe first caught   way made somewhat challenge eat because radish soggy chew which honestly gross   The salad basically  when mix ketchup mayo  thousand island dressing salad but don't dig ice cabbage either   We tried sushi which decent such cali roll but tuna looked freakishly pink assume purchased dyed fish   know ones dyed purpose lose color when degrading?  honest business but kills flavor fish   Overall think if want AYCE sushi stick when coming but terms anything else menu I'd weary   fried chicken experience top sushi small appetizer left sad   hate leaving full but sad     I'll try place again six months but now refuse walk through those doors again  <EOR> Pros restaurant maybe best selection sushi ever seen   Great atmosphere great service  Tables small button table call over server   offer unlimited sushi standard price if buffet style   Love it!

But kinda seems all rolls close same ingridents   defiently woul recommend tho!   Con  No fresh oysters <EOR> I read through reviews intentions being treated terribly employees having wait table plus first time trying sushi expecting smell ocean fish  Therefore extremely low expectations proven WRONG!  We name list 40 minutes given call  wait expected but tea shop right next sushi place boba while waited  waiter helpful suggested few things  ended going all eat which she suggested  party 6  bill only came 55 15% tip included  order 6 different types roll shared between everyone  enjoyed lot rolls yet choose them preference familiarity ingredients  stayed away foreign to us described items    enjoyable  atmosphere very intimate dimmed lights Asia decent paintings decorations spacious  all fit comfortably booth  also sushi bar faster service  <EOR> Food excellent portioned correctly but service horrible slow rude clueless bad enough care food quality  <EOR> This place great! The fish fresh nothing overloaded rice lot AYCE places  Nothing better quality fish specialty rolls very unique   The only two things keep giving full 5 stars  a] service bit slow attribute busy are b] way bar set don't interact sushi chefs which wholeheartedly enjoy   Still quality joint  <EOR> Came lunch while woman pho down street   Ends pho Pho Kim Long liking   Anyways ordered AYCE deal lunch price cheaper dinner    Sushi rolls pretty good considering AYCE less $20 includes ice cream   Place busy felt wait orders bit long  Overall very pleased   hungry craved sushi   Why oftentimes eat only meal day when Vegas?  If gone regular sushi joint ordered same amount food bill would $100 5 times paid    Would come back?  Most likely but definitely want try other AYCE joints Vegas first  <EOR> Very good acye sushi! believe Korean owned least greeted Korean when walked in   some AYCE sushi places feel if you're overstaying overeating your welcome but place did vibe   Great place visit again when return Vegas! <EOR> With being plenty mean PLENTY sushi places choose Las Vegas sushi Kaya happens favorite spots!! those who've never experienced all eat FRESH order sushi then lived!! provide some best tasting options extensive menu provides HUGE selection dishes choose from! fact if plan coming regular cool punch card provide everytime eat working toward free meal next time dine them! located pretty busy intersection Spring Mountain Arville parking sometimes pain but other sushi places eat list sure!! <EOR> Love AYCE sushi!

The only reason didn't give five because service  But hey any shop owned Asian staff speaks less 80% English hey your bound run into bad service  Ok if put minor rudeness then you'll experience delicious!  Our group friends came little experience hearing mixed reviews place decided check any way  price good AYCE compared sushimon which almost $30 dinner   gave quick glance menu decided stick appetizers nigiri sushi    Ohhhhh boy ordered White Tuna Nigiri OMG! most tender fresh piece fish ever! having burst flavors melt your mouth  felt exotic rush idk but feel raw fish exotic  Weird right?  Seared Albercore Nigiri OMFG!!! Another melt your mouth sushi idk but just tantalizes tongue always saying give more!  Yellowtail Nigiri Also definite must! fresh everything just meshes well together   Bacon scallop Skewer find rule little greedy seeing only skewer per person  smallest strip bacon tiny ass scallop you've kidding only limited one? Well whatever     the taste skewer amazing  juices scallop burst if your mouth along bacon  sad  tiny heck   Shrimp Skewer again tiny heck but deliciously oozing muCh flavor  Whoever came skewer rule cruel  Leaving person something amazing limit   Oysters never fan raw oysters somi bit surprised when it  under impression baked but should've known  don't come sushi place expecting something cooked   Salmon Skin roll surprisingly good usually hand roll but surprised consistency rice  sticky wet just right   with right amount stuffing   Calamari Fried crisp served special soy sauce served fancy looking bento box  Nothing amazing but worth try   Spicy Rice cake More seet sour rice cake interesting but nothing special   Green tea Ice cream sweet but green tea tasting  sad didn't fried tempura ice cream  Ohh well there's always room improvement   This good sushi joint worth pit stop  before 7 if you're coming dinner  gets pretty packed  <EOR> I always come AYCE  think its worth since hardcore eat sushi  large variety bound something like  recommend Amigo Roll Ryan Roll Ichiban Roll  Spicy Yum sauce great too!!! True waiters hard hold sometimes search them which why order everyTHANG start  mochi fire  Not mention open late there's KPOP all time  great experiences all times gone friends  <EOR> This second visit much more pleasant first visit! First all I'd say changed most customer service  came dinner first time time came during slow hours which between 3pm 5pm   ATMOSPHERE Good relaxing extremely grateful A C which wasn't blast making cold most restaurants nor hot  Hey  important! Just saying = interior typical classic Japanese sushi setting very subtle wood black colors interesting pieces Kabuki masks Japanese paintings   FOOD good good good! enjoyed all nigiri ordered which entire AYCE sushi experience consisted of  don't really getting complicated rolls prefer taste each ingredient its beautiful simplicity  White tuna nigiri favorite although hasn't best ever still pretty good  Other nigiri recommend Cajun albacore salmon amaebi sweet shrimp surf clam eel yellowtail  Stay away tuna tako wasabi respectively dry slimy   SERVICE great service wish remembered Asian male server's name  He way better rude Spanish guy during dinner first visit  Also girl Skrillex haircut pretty cool nice  Definitely much better service  Keep back = <EOR> This place may the best AYCE town but no doubt WORST service town  Sure seated immediately but wait 15 minutes even served drinks  ticked off most 2 3 servers walked past table several times glanced bare table  even someone serving shortly any form acknowledgement just table glancing  Despite servers passing table plenty never approached  heard reviews place would hot busy but sushi bar full some empty tables wasnt busy yet still ignored! Ignoring place FOREVER ignored presence  <EOR> Another AYCE sushi buffet Las Vegas   Once try handful them start seeing qualities different rest     First all location restaurant very convenient good area near Strip  However parking extremely hard    Secondly service very fast efficient   manager constantly walking around sure all your orders completed   He even followed few orders missed heard tell staff hurry order   Third all restaurant spacious feels even bigger very high ceilings   tables quite large enough hold all food soon order    The sushi bad nothing really stands other AYCE sushi places pretty much par terms quality selection   Definitely AYCE sushi places try  <EOR> AYCE everything  great here   Food alway perfect   Ordered salmon yellowtail spider roll   Delicious!

Usually when lunch time busy service right on  wish could put good word server but don't believe name tags darn   Anyways waitress short hair attentive! She always asked if wanted order more always checked which odd because never happened last 5 times here    For AYCE restaurant quality fish okay wasn't excellent though  yellowtail nigiri kinda warm side gross but very generous size fish amount rice  Big piece fish top little stack rice perfect! would recommend everything menu especially all baked rolls Tornado Sweety roll  only thing would recommend baked mussels  put way much cheese cook long cheese all burnt tuff ew   <EOR> Late night food   All eat sushi $26 bucks   quality great taste yummy only thing  don't only 1 time repeat 1 time order sashimi love love love sashimi!!

Mediocre   It's redeeming quality its AYCE couple bucks cheaper other places  <EOR> We've made back Sushi Kaya couple times first review unfortunately place slowly gone downill but prices sure haven't   Our most recent visit past Sunday   Granted Christmas night place busy but few empty tables  did AYCE option started ordering off bat   Each time server took order she would miss couple things then would later excuse of 1 ran because busy tonight! Whatever 9pm you're open another 5 hours lady gonna then?!? 2 The kitchen really busy  Is really problem? 3 simply just ignoring request smiling instead  Sorry lady late play no Engrish front me   In total she failed SIX plates due above reasons   Sorry  going cut took tip   Arigato Sushi Kaya   or should really say Annyonghi Kaseyo sp? great while lasted but off find better AYCE sushi spot LV  <EOR> This place hands down BEST sushi ever had!  Some girlfriends Vegas friend's 25th birthday weekend party planner recommended if wanted sushi come here   She said all you can eat sushi soon heard sold!  I miso soup cucumber salad calamari 2 12 piece sushi rolls all $20! soup salad appetizers also included $20 all eat price which awesome!  Everyone must least once! 8 girls service super fast even though ordered lot! <EOR> Love place great music good atmosphere great menu lots Items choose from!! <EOR> This place really good quality fish! tuna roll yellowtail roll could tell fresh was  Also garlic edamame which kind spicy but really good  Next time all eat because seems worth since each specialty roll over $12 2 rolls same all eat  The service really good felt well taken care all very sweet accommodating  Definitely return!  Update all eat little overwhelming since many specialty rolls choose but everything tried delicious definitely new all eat sushi <EOR> I place  take few extended trips Vegas choice dinner most often  buffet price fresh items choose menu  Seafood quality very good presentation ok overall quality excellent  cannot place price  place those sample variety raw items  <EOR> Awesome sushi place! all eat $27 but choose whole menu which lot different yummy foods choose from  Absolutely best service gotten anywhere she made half orders did easy rice  Absolutely loved food service  Highly recommended! <EOR> I small plates more anything AYCE   Good robata skewers I gizzards bacon wrapped scallops best but order them all ahi poke good love fried soft shell crab eat bunch those critters! Bulgogi flavorful    Kaya spicy albacore rolls favorites but really roll person favorite doesn't equate fucking fantastic but just good  wish did half rolls some rolls ordered just okay didnt really want eat whole something wrong    Nigiri hit miss few times okay some days top notch freshness still decent spread skimpy fish rice heavy  seems though fresher times while back when first started AYCE since lesser quality    We've gone during quiet times near when open 5pm sometimes even service hit miss then  just wave down sometimes she'll off doing something but major neglect just gotta assertive sometimes let them know need something    Docked star hit miss service star no half rolls also each time gone more more items become order per person    almost all robatas except potato ginko garlics 1o p p  nigiri quality wasn't good last visit    It place I'd say good but now stands A OK looking better place AYCE  <EOR> This definitely best priced AYCE sushi joint town sure   agree some reviews quality however review most specialty rolls being variations California Roll      big plus place non Sushi items included AYCE menu   basically going upstairs Ichiza another great restaurant complex but only paying flat fee     Service wise place some best service ever seen AYCE joint   alone justifies visit here   Plus AYCE sushi availible until 2am   Also ambiance restaurant very cool   Physically lay place 10 times better any AYCE sushi joint to  So if late night craving raw fish    KAYA PLACE! <EOR> Love sushi here! Only wish bigger wait wouldn't long  Sticky rice good! <EOR> My absolute favorite AYCE sushi spot Vegas! introduced many people Sushi Kaya love every single time  probably used 5 stamp cards because often  LOL   I highly recommend Cinderella Roll Brooklyn Bridge Japanese lasagna roll  also love nigiri  Amaebi yellowtail salmon faves! appetizers also delicious  Bbq beef skewers beef tongue bacon wrapped asparagus baked green mussels kimchi fried rice omg on  Oh don't forget dessert! don't *one order per person* limit desserts order your heart's content  usually order red bean ice cream green tea mochi  obsessed red bean ice cream!   The only downside wait times place usually 30 45 min wait weekends since ALWAYS packed parking lot well since right other popular restaurants such Tea Station Ichiza  Ugh wish would expand parking lot  However quality food outweighs wait times parking situation    Definitely check place  <EOR> Shrinking menu?

Came late night AYCE sushi last night Vegas yelp friends Nelson F  I few AYCE sushi experiences Vegas over past 2 months say    wasn't very amused   First off    really wanted seaweed salad out  No mochi ice cream ahi poke horrible! quality fish very low   Sexy roll tempura crunch roll seared ahi nigiri tamago okay   They did ask clean all plates    careful when ordering! Service decent   I wouldn't back   2 stars good location late night hours   Casual dining  Indoor seating only   NEXT!  <EOR> This used AYCE but 3 months since coming now find myself highly disappointed dissatisfied  always service good  punctual gear take orders refill drinks clear plates  But service disappointed quality food  Much fish served precut unfortunately getting slices ranged fresh looking tasting old tasteless  amount rice give nigiri crazy  rice slight mush little flavor  worst masago smelt roe scallop  Masago mushy didn't any texture would expect fresh fish roe  scallop clearly premade hours before left sit  air whether am returning not  <EOR> Sushi horrible  first time come here  sushi use good  Super white tuna warm tasted melted plastic  even tried cooked items menu ordered all could eat  Nothing tasted good don't know happened  never return! Hope don't sick! only thing good water  <EOR> Nothing really sticks place other small environment   The sushi itself alright AYCE sushi being $25 dinner  menu opinion mediocre  all your basic sushi anywhere  If you're going big group sure call reservation  If enough people maybe able place your party private room   I guess if you're near Chinatown can't decide sushi restaurant eat give place try  <EOR> I should listened cousins review before going here    A good friend mine recommend place she raved good naturally excited  six wait table set which no problem  Once table server quickly asked would drink if doing AYCE  Things going pretty well enjoying food service till hit 30 dollar mark  Once hit mark if invisible! waited ten 10 15 minutes another order wait 30 minutes rolls! most annoying part waiter often looked empty table never said thing! mention hostess kept looking table if should leaving!
