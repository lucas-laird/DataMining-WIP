very flavorful pair great toasted bun  wish came fries but can't win them all  haha <EOR> Let break into couple categories understand lower rating good restauarant Price main reason 3 stars   3 burgers 2 milk shakes order fried pickles came $57 dollars   when milk shake $6 its served 8 oz plastic cup its way overpriced   Food Burgers fries good but lot good burger joints town many them cheaper here   Location Yes its Town Square but unless going Valet Parking back its hard find  Its behind Yardhouse almost seems overflow when Yardhouse full  Saturday evening 6pm only table joint   few folks started walking right when leaving   Decor Cool chalkboard paint walls everyone encouraged draw but nothing made stand out    Overall would back again since Town Square quite often but probably would need groupon  <EOR> They facebook promotion free classic burger decided give place shot  Walked greeted general manager  He very kind girl took order  added some Nom Noms which mac n cheese balls fried  food pretty quick maybe ten fifteen minutes considering place pretty busy seemed pretty impressive  burger itself looked absolutely amazing  bun beautiful golden brown looked if baked location order  patty nice medium rare which just it  Perhaps am spoiled little bit In and Out toasted buns super fresh crunchy veggies  really missing burger  bun super soft doughy although thin layer lettuce tomato just didn't any crunch texture it  patty decent but just wasn't tasting anything special  cheese nice visual but offered nothing terms flavor  nom noms    pretty tasty  Primarily because cheese dipping sauce  wish given enough use burger  guess bottom line place if Town Square want burger 6 bucks then it  wont blow away but hold over compared lot expensive places located near by    Good Service good quality lacks any type wow factor though  6 bucks classic burger which single patty cheese lettuce tomato    Personally sticking burgers Yard House Happy Hour Town Square dining  <EOR> This place awful  staying Venetian Medical conference  last day hungry did want fancy sit down decided give place try  entire place empty  fairly large restaurant  ordered Chicken Burger Onion rings diet coke  total came $28 00  talking place Habit Burger  sick eating place strongly feel should refund  hate write negative reviews but place even two stars me  understand its inside Venetian rent higher thus prices substantially more regular place but no excuse bad product especially when charge $28 00 tax  comeback place  sadness place gets first ever star review Yelp  would think 100 times before coming back  waitress nice but never checked see if everything ok  <EOR> Yum!

I Oregon Trail burger which according menu consisted of ground buffalo aged cheddar lettuce tomato red onions roasted garlic aioli all between whole wheat buns    When burger came actually little surprised small patty even tomato looked bigger actual burger patty ! Whatever    aroma tantalizing senses just wanted dig in!  The burger cooked medium really juicy filled savory flavor lean buffalo  bun tasted little dry but wasn't sure if bun being whole wheat made taste way  juiciness burger made dry burger buns wasn't bad   The sweet potato fries burnt perfect sweetness tastebuds happy  feel give lot fries but maybe size burger fries look bigger portion   I little branding restaurant name top burger bun nice touch!   However wasn't enough completely win over    From place specializes burgers expected something more  don't know if worth because burgers left underwhelmed   I Love Burgers dub thee    average  <EOR> I eat love burgers 2 3 times week since work town square offer generous discount employees  Some items little pricey compared fast food but don't consider fast food joint  more fast casual diner  grass fed beef reasonable price  bought grass fed beef whole foods know cheap    I am always greeted employees when come in  fact Sandra works register knows name knows order  She always gives great service  managers always come ask meal if anything else  see care providing great service food  am sure if problem suggestion would take seriously  Hence why always reading yelp reviews    I pretty much everything menu  BBQ chicken salad  BBQ burger good  caprice very good burger if tired same old burger every other place offers  biggest surprise found turkey burger comes some really tasty stuffing  If beer drinker am sure would more beer specials here  <EOR> Left Vegas ended mall called Townsquare  no idea where going ended parking weird parking spot vallet saw place  name outside cute soon saw shakes beer in  When saw 2 other customers very flustered manager would assume register  only ordered shake because looked storm moving long drive back California  ordered Triple Chocolate Shake which over $5  instantly thought quote Pulp Fiction  Anyway sat down waited shake  manager very all over place she middle taking someone's order employee came she straight into conversation totally left customer waiting  Behind counter where shake should made no doing anything  waiter socializing doing much anything else  Finally manager letting know ordered MILKSHAKE over 15 minutes ago  She then told waiter he looked order screen said oh yeah you're right then he aruge another employee if wanted not  Then girl yelled across restaurant asking if wanted go  shake wasn't good 12oz plastic cup! Very unprofessional am very disappointed probably won't back   <EOR> Just OK book  Food did taste fresh  $35 00 2 burgers fries  Table clean  Portion smaller fast food place pay dearly place being area in! <EOR> If you're going FastFood type stuff much better alternative then Jack in the Box Carl's Burger King McDonald's Wendy's really comparable  Great all beef Angus burgers wheat bun best love any place serves tater tots!

The fries sweet potato fries both good husband both liked burgers   There bar side looks some decent specials weekdays $2 50 beers   Also 2 locations 3 they're opening Fremont locally owned boosting them 3 stars  <EOR> Not great value price pay little burgers  say 1 3 pound patties but more paying $10 slider  could easily eat 3 sliders still hit McDonald's way home   The fries don't come your burger  Instead pay $4 combo $4 side fries  What's difference?  Online says happy hour around usual happy hour time 5pm however actually happy hour 2 4pm  Sounds more kiddie hour me   The $2 cheap beer only decent thing here   Everything else over priced filling   I could lack service great deal confusion faced when coming but spare part review    One star gut review but decided give them benefit doubt submit 2  You're welcome love burger  <EOR> I mood yummy juicy burger begged boyfriend if could come 30 dollars 2 burgers side fries  gave 2 stars only because girl took order cashier super nice being boyfriend always indecisive she didn't upset taking long     waited food walked around cool giant chalk boards draw on    Fries good  Cheese sauce decent   My burger wasn't nasty but wasn't juicy burger hoped stick Johnny Rockets  asked hard fried egg but runny egg  boyfriend asked well done burger pink middle he runny egg well      BAD       He complains tell they'll new     ever told couldn't well done because he love bacon burger meanwhile no pink found burger same exact !
