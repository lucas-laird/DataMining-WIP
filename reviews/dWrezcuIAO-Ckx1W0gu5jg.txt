Or maybe its because Im Italian NY Vegas never 5 star pasta <EOR> Fresh Homemade Pasta + Luxurious Sauces = Delicious Decadence   I driven past restaurant hundreds times way Trader Joe's thought just deli  Boy wrong! knew behind those unsuspecting doors full service restaurant addition counter deli mini market?!  My husband lunch some town guests   and Chef Marc crew did disappoint     I ordered Spinach Manicotti winning dish   homemade pasta enveloped around spinach topped mozzarella blanketed perfect pink basil sauce perfection    My husband ordered Parpadelle Bolognese shared toddler daughter both them practically licked plates clean   husband also ordered side hot sausage which absolutely delicious    My cousin originally wanted lasagna but run waitress recommended Baked Pasta Fazoletti which deconstructed lasagna   favorite dish day order all myself next time    My cousin's husband could decide many delicious sandwiches he ordered 2 half sandwiches very pleased both     The service OK  wasn't warmest but attentive iced tea glasses never empty counts   Besides food alone worthy 5 stars can't wait back try dinner menu   glad ventured because now added list faves! <EOR> I no clue why place such good rating  wonder if paying people write good reviews    I girlfriend mother very disappointed  When arrived instructed seat ourselves which problem because way done New York place this  even added authenticity restaurant    We given menus figuring wanted order host came over took them but without taking order  waited another ten minutes before waitress came over without asking if wanted more drinks might add    We ordered beet salad some veal raviolis mushroom pasta sausage raviolis table wanted share  only thing close palatable sausage raviolis  However could only bear eat couple over salted  All pasta way al dente taste maybe even being undercooked  mushrooms wild mushroom pasta obviously dried fresh  could tell because seemed didn't cook them long enough very chewy  veal raviolis worst part  bland fatty along pasta being undercooked    After finished beet salad plates just sat table taking space until just before entrees came out  kind thing very bad form restaurant    After decided place just horrible wanted leave ASAP  yell waitress across dining room check because she having very extensive conversation paying attention any tables  then explained satisfied veal raviolis  credit she did them taken off bill but before talking bunch toddlers throwing fit  still sure if she being sarcastic she genuinely thinks people enjoy being talked that    Overall place disaster  absolutely recommend eating here  <EOR>
