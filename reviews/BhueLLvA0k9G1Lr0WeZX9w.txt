Really blows away walk places put TIP cup but absolute minimum service   If lady manages place actually sees being nice giving customer service might actually people return!!! <EOR> Let start saying really Zupas whole  However easily worst location ever to    The staff all behave 1st day job  No seems know they're doing all seem very uncertain everything happening   The food itself seems   off  portions fruit salad nuts berries seems much lower normal  lobster bisque insanely watery contained absolutely no meat not case other locations     Personally I'd drive extra 5 10 minutes different location if really jonesin some Zupas  <EOR> I love food but honestly hate coming here  Staff unable retain lot information aka remembering salad dressing ALWAYS messes order  Manager mustache super creepy super fake SUPER RUDE  staff uncomfortable drive farther avoid location      <EOR> For quick service nice fit me  Good clean processed food   close home gym etc   salads freshly made  portions just enough  <EOR> This place pretty good  digging infused waters teas  also chocolate covered strawberries every meal    Today turkey artichoke panini red pepper lobster bisque    The soup fantastic expected just lobster flavored but there's noticeable amount lobster there  came chunk baguette which wish little crustier     The sandwich good but made gringos thankfully selection hot sauces I settled chipotle Tabasco   also little mayonnaisey taste I don't hot mayonnaise but somebody else might it  still good mind just great    I didn't issue portion size perhaps corrected   kinda muscley typically big eater satisfied as second lunch The staff super nice if they're still happy few months they're service culture manager pilfered Disney  Seriously service standard fantastic    In end we'll back however food Panera little better  <EOR> I'm sure why location gotten such bad ratings far  Yes newly opened staff new but when service very fast everyone knew doing food good!  It very busy when line moves fast  main thing bothered place cramped  Most people walk front door but tables really jam packed hard back line  also side door would more logical entrance but think most don't know there   Also ordering most people turn right walk away which puts behind drink station  then walk back around which many cases walking across people walking which again trying walk past people getting drinks  think should put big sign front door use side door entrance use front door exit  If place continues busy think would control flow traffic much better  could turn drink station around which think would great idea but probably question   As far food prices very good if don't overboard add ons which $0 69 each  But sandwiches less $6 each small but size equal its price IMO  tried Cubano Turkey spinach artichoke TSA Turkey bacon avocado TBA Chicken salad  best Cubano  most amount meat pork really tender  same pork what's used Pulled Pork Cilantro Pork though yet try those  runner TSA refreshing yet satisfying   Every order comes small chocolate dipped strawberry  If  enough dessert several house made desserts VERY sweet!  Soups also very tasty  tried lobster bisque clam chowder  lobster bisque better  bit spicy kick it  clam chowder big chunks clam but little salty side  <EOR> First timer! during lunch super busy but even though line really long pretty fast  Once front line greeted energetic friendly man explained things worked took salad sandwich order   If haven't before its very similar paradise bakery  order your salad and or sandwhich first then move down line soups  service itself fast friendly  end all your food tray met delicous looking home made brulees  OMG! Its hard resist   We tried California chicken sandwich lobster bisque turkey avocado sandwhich Maui tropical salad    Loved salad   so refreshing delicious  5   The lobster bisque little disappointment  expecting creamy lobster pieced filled soup other restaurants  more mass produced bit watery based no lobster soup  probably through gallons soup can't people chopping fresh lobster back maybe u expectations little high    I'll back try rest food  there tons choices  <EOR> Finally made way try place  wanted something quick casual craving soup sandwich  ordered New England crab sandwich chicken chili combo cherry chicken salad lobster bisque  Didn't really hit spot food mediocre wasn't great wasn't bad just    Mehhh  Yes probably back again wouldn't crave place but infused waters  Besides nothing else really impressed here  <EOR> I heard great things Zupas coworkers but expectations even close being met  atmosphere quite poor line long between 5 people assembly line lost confused order three times  Tomato soup good but  grilled cheese flat tasteless it looks much better pictures online menu   If pick soup salad place would pick Jason's Deli over Zupas any day  Wont returning recommending  <EOR> First thing    entrance inconvenient  Walk door maneuver around all tables counter order   Perhaps side door would best but did check if open     Food came great   good price meal filling   Combo soup sandwich comes bread chocolate covered strawberry     My first time try pomegranate green tea   lovely!  Lightly fruity just enough honey refreshing yet slightly sweet iced tea! Haven't elsewhere  could something would keep coming back  <EOR> Food delicious place nice spacious  only reason didn't give five stars Wi Fi <EOR> The staff rushed  place order  seemed only thing mind speed  instead quality service very cold helpful all  Food good but staff awful except   cashier she  kind smiley! <EOR> this new favorite place list yelp bookmarks pesto chicken sandwich salad tomato soup super good returning faithfully <EOR> Love love food here!! around dinner time line wrapped three rows deep  crew worked quickly possible good attitudes  took 15 minutes line food but well worth wait  being busy seating extremely limited inside but able enjoy weather outside while eating  <EOR> Not bad cheap lunch  don't recommend anything seafood because pay for     Cute place clean fast  Food taste fresh     good selection soups salads sandwiches  Those chocolate dipped strawberries nice touch  reason actually why come back!

I Zupas but won't again  greedy staff unprofessional  Place could fancy but ZUPAS rainbow sure quality clients paying given <EOR> Food pretty good here  Staffs nice  Loved soup salad  pretty good  come pretty often  However am sure if just every time come portion just gets smaller smaller? honey bacon club just flat  bacon just half strip side club  Really? chicken asian citrus salad fresh today think tasted kind funny  might start consider another option salad bar Sweet Tomato  sure feel this  <EOR> I've eagerly waiting opening new Cafe Zupas location Westside  We're bit spoiled Vegas all great places having multiple locations every corner valley wanted shave off 10 minutes driving Lake Mead location    With every new restaurant opening sure some growing pains as other reviewers pointed out but think location still same great service affordable high quality food options friendly atmosphere other locations to  always other locations mushroom bisque nuts berries salad husband picks delicious honey cilantro carnitas whatever soup looks good day  husband picked some food other day he said place packed even sent picture line aware if going during lunch hours  He said line still rather quickly food still hot neatly packaged upon arrival  really appreciated salad dressing put side greens weren't soggy  coming lot part commitment trying eat healthier but we'll see long holds year  <EOR> I always wanted check Cafe Zupas  When lived other side town just off Eastern would end going Pin Kaow BJ's Brewhouse Beach Hut Subs Griddlecakes Smashburger Taco Y Taco  just bad luck being same area ALL other dining establishments   So when saw opened just street new house knew definitely going check out! Sure enough just other day experienced Cafe Zupas first time took away it     Pros  Fair prices get  $8 79 choice 2 3 Sandwhich Soup Salad  Employees very nice friendly  explained whole process answered questions had  Sandwiches huge but combined soup quite filling  Italian Club very tasty but Chili Enchilada soup incredible! want large serving next time! The restaurant new course very shiny clean  Chocolate covered strawberry each meal nice little touch    and yummy   I loooove strawberries!  Cons  It 45 degrees raining when dined blasting A C  Ummmm am freaking shivering please kill A C while eat?? am sure awesome July but first week January? think not  As others stated when first walk through door walk through bunch crammed little 2 4 seaters line  Must awkward hell busy days  definitely need fix that   Other tidbits  Fountain machine serves Coke products including Coke Zero! Yay! Nice little outdoor seating area front few table settings under umbrellas facing Rainbow Blvd   I very happy first visit Cafe Zupas definitely see many return visits future!  4 stars  <EOR> This fiancé I's first time Cafe Zupas little bit different expected  looking somewhere salad soup lunch New Year's Day however when Jason's Deli closed  remembered driving Zafe Zupas seeing open decided try out  When first walk restaurant looks amazing! However when walk order rather confusing  sure where line started ended where menus besides wall order etc   Once did order staff nice very helpful  Upon getting food pleasantly surprised receive complimentary chocolate covered strawberry fiancé loved it! When find table tad confusing since food court seating must pass drink station before finding your seat   this leads nearly bumping into other patrons both when sit down refills  food decent say because soup salad amazing but panini alright which evens out  Overall pleasant enough experience however would place top list return  Hope helps happy new year! <EOR> What's love Cafe Zupas?! Everything always delicious favorite lunch spots  love veggie chowder crab sandwich  awesome always give fresh chocolate covered strawberry?! particular location amazing staff kind patient way help sure want  super organized there's never long wait  Cafe Zupas doing right! <EOR> This place amazing other locations best tried lobster curry world yum yum yum! Only thing don't way desserts open case but other doin things right! Thanks lunch! <EOR> Food average best  ordered panini  sure didn't look picture menu  small side  Chipotle chicken salad okay  don't see all fuss about  won't coming back anymore <EOR> Well place disappointment say least  basically subway meets chipotle style restaurant which thought would enjoy   The lay little odd walk through several tables line which wasn't chained off no idea where actually go  Then when ordering service subpar opinion  Yes new place very busy but smile long way  none business happening behind line things being discussed coworkers shouldn't been   The food decent  Nothing rave about  panini tiny squished greasy  garden soup pretty good    Now reason star     spent rest day night sick stomach minor food poisoning  Still write stomach gurgling knots  never back again  <EOR> If don't mind repeating your order four times four different people love place   down line greeted someone asks your order   call some then your salads   Then come soup line someone asks if any soup part your order   then proceed dessert case where someone new asks repeat your entire order then cashier surprise asks your entire order if want any drinks   As family four most annoying process   Can'y write down electronic order system don't need ask four times?  Also prepare least your items wrong need ask remade     The food ok housemade drinks   Oh walk door almost hit table   want love place but few visits last few months am over it   good luck finding parkin during peak hours  <EOR> This 3rd time here! Love it! Every time walk its clean welcoming  only concern way line order walk through tables order your meal  Besides customer service wonderful everyone very attentive clientele service!

But didn't stop them being very friendly while efficiently moving line along  almost turned around left when saw busy but glad didn't because great meal  did try 2 combo Cuban pork sandwich fave salad cherry balsamic chicken  Both delicious! highly recommend! <EOR> I hesitant going seeing 3 5 star rating Yelp but pleasantly surprised quality food here  House made healthy soup salad sandwiches served affordable price   Though did food thought service just odd  assembly line where each staff seems set station but extremely unorganized inefficient  also think ordering system plain confusing  don't know if just but hard time figuring order get  Also didn't help because station ordering sandwich staff soup station already asking soup ordering  Would some soup today?     Sorry still deciding  Then 20 seconds later Would some soup today?  WOULD SOME SOUP TODAY?     Holy moly many times going ask me? Calm down soup server  ready yet   guess fault knowing want first visit? Then come register met rude cashier  Ugh   On bright side food fantastic  kale quinoa salad cuban grilled pork panini sandwich wild mushroom bisque asian citrus chicken salad  Salads drenched dressing did much  However did enjoy sandwich mushroom soup    Cuban grilled pork smoky taste it  Panini thin sandwich small portion but loved flavor  Small bite instantly love  bite kept wanting another  Mushroom soup rich creamy wish more mushroom instead few small pieces  try sample tomato basil soup best soup had  Wish sell gallon    Unpleasant service but enjoyed food  would come back heartbeat especially now know here  <EOR> I lived NYC couple years healthy soup salad sandwich places available everywhere lunch  always complain aren't those quick salad places Vegas seriously excited see place open far office  Additionally younger brother recommended me  He tried Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich claims better carnitas Mexican restaurant   While give place another chance am initially fan  looked menu online wowed salad selection affordable prices! try eat really healthy during week know salads aren't always healthy seem searched nutrition information which nowhere website  headed anyway 3 21 16 decided ask staff   When mayhem  super busy large lunch crowd  approached line friendly staff member asked if ever before  When said no he explained menu me  asked nutrition allergen information he told would front line order  asked order? which he said let you  He came back said he unfortunately mistaken information  What?! Okaaay      ordered Asian Citrus Chicken salad Asian style salads usually healthy option anywhere  half size $5 59 full size $7 59 opted full size very happy fact would having lunch under $8   They rush through line  When ordered salad told okay front line you  figured would let customize build your salad? told guy please leave off wonton strips before headed front line  don't know size difference between half full size but wow full size portion small  If your salad put compartmentalized plastic container just fill 3 compartments leaving 4th largest compartment empty  enough food lunch very disappointed  flavor okay  mandarin oranges mushy but dressing flavorful  chicken plain chicken  missing sesame seeds cucumbers cashews salad which didn't notice until already back office  sucked  give bread chocolate dipped strawberry your meal  would rather more salad   I'll give another try someday would really love quick salad place nearby work lunch  But right now meh  hoping just those one off bad experiences  <EOR> So goooood! sandwiches soups always delicious tasty  service super fast  If want soup salads sandwiches your meal def place go! <EOR> Drove SoCal day didn't want fast food  Wife California Turkey Honey Dijon panini  delicious loved chocolate covered strawberry meal!

WAYYY many tables place  Whoever charge design needs lesson feng shui   no clear path area where line you're always trying shuffle between people eating tables very close together   only 6 feet front when walk door before hit table people eating  first thing notice every time walk in     It's pretty obvious Café Zupas trains employees things VERY specific way  God forbid them stray training plan  They're usually very young very robotic don't know maneuver when off request  example today asked cookie soup girl looked absolutely crazy  She said sorry would've place catering order don't cookies soup  said 'do sell cookies?' She said yes  said okay we'll I'd buy cookie        <EOR> I LOVE place! thing missing Las Vegas hot soup sandwiches  aren't many options glad found place!

The saddest part? They're close Sundays unfortunate  <EOR> I am really disappointed cafe zupas  deliver consistent customer service   3 locations Las Vegas areas previously NO issues substituting ingredient sandwich  informed last visit NO substitutions allowed sandwiches even if willing pay upcharge  Customers only allowed remove items  simply asked spinach leaves instead cheese sandwich  find policy very troubling those food allergies would alternative ingredient sandwich  employees behind counter rude tossed to go bag without giving any eye contact  called another location verify policy which confirmed  support return zupas anymore  <EOR> Don't salad won't give same amount if eat dining room  asked them add more lettuce least just said no  should returned salad  <EOR> We turkey artichoke sandwich clam chowder chicken pesto sandwich Cobb salad  All delicious! also tried coconut pomegranate green tea raw honey lemonade which amazing refreshing  portions along bread roll even chocolate covered strawberry dessert great price  enjoyed everything everyone friendly! Definitely great experience all around! <EOR> I love quality food but price simply isn't worth it  several times now    This past time husband ordered 1 2 soup full soup drink paid $16  Furthermore don't even both filling containers top  simply put ladle full 1 2 two full  always order just worth money sit refill drink    It's shame because food delicious  tomato basil soup best had  salads very well crafted well  another reviewer said very consistent them much on  love include roll chocolate covered strawberry each order but still isn't enough warrant high prices    Also every single time come tofu more  If case why just prep more every day? <EOR> I hesitate trying place beginning  But since live close it  decided try out  why didn't try earlier?!?! admit am soup salad sandwhich person  But say your food fresh!! am hooked your chicken glazed salad! also think strawberry chocolate just added bonus meal  <EOR> Visiting sis Sin City place highly recommended  many sandwiches salads soup choose place Soup Plantation steroids  Everything sounds tasty gourmet item making selection difficult  Luckily allow sample soups  Since late weekday werent many people line  staff extremely patient sampled 6 different soups  When dining try order things aren't routine leaning towards meals new pallet things would ordinarily cook  torn between brothy soup chowder  gal behind counter recommended cauliflower soup once cheesiness hit taste buds sold! paired kale quinoa salad  $8 99 pleasantly surprised also came bread large chocolate covered strawberry  salad hearty good mix fixins just enough kale goodies ratio  sister ordered crab avocado sandwich which sample  delicious warm panini bread I'd order next time  am Zupas head! <EOR> Clam chowder different but good drank it They need start serving dill pickle side sandwiches shit would perfect  Turkey spinach artichoke panini great all but small still hungry McDonald's filet o fish hashbrown  Also don't think ever seen such small ass skimpy chocolate covered strawberry oh  why give them free see <EOR> This place exceeded expectations little hesitant due low reviews  Glad ignored anyways  ultimate grilled cheese roasted red pepper lobster soup  grilled cheese exceptional soup equally good  definitely going back  Resturant long line which made nervous  Everyone friendly quick!! <EOR> First time here!!!  soup salad place serves panini sandwiches   really looking forward chicken Caesar salad!!!  No Caesar dressing offered   second option recommended Italian style dressing   While dressing jus ok standards   asked soup salad combo that   clam chowder soup style creamy traditional clam chowder   While everything very fresh just didn't me   buffet style ordering seemed very rushed      don't know       Just place me  <EOR> Wow don't know didn't try place sooner! recently came parents since mom raving soups she had  always down anything figured why try out   When walk order counter prepare everything right front you  You're also able sample soups before decide flavor which nice  chose Turkey Spinach Avocado TSA sandwich red pepper lobster bisque  meal also came complementary roll chocolate covered strawberry  Um yes please!

Basically sandwich lacked much needed texture seasoning  Even addition salt pepper still just okay   Honey Bacon Club Panini Turkey ham bacon tomatoes Muenster cheese housemade honey mustard  Again bread lacked crunch  Its flavor decent honey really stood without being overwhelming sweet  also didn't need additional salt  didn't love sandwich but enjoyed much more other panini   Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Soup neat combination two ingredients love lighter its described creamy   nice lobster fragrance could really taste several pieces lobster though odd texture   However just okay    Chicken Enchilada Chili Red green enchilada sauces chicken black beans Southwestern vegetables topped tortilla strips  bit thin chili since more soup stew but flavors good  would order again   Asian Citrus Chicken Baby field greens housemade yuzu miso vinaigrette chicken sugar snap peas edamame baby cucumbers tri color peppers mandarin oranges cashews wonton strips black sesame seeds  pleased salad wasn't overly dressed vinaigrette I hate drowning salads thought decent  mandarin oranges super mushy but fan them salads anyway   The sandwiches small but soups salads generous  accompanying bread pretty good though would much better toasted and butter forgot butter ! didn't eat chocolate covered strawberry time but remember being good Belgian milk chocolate    I'm overly impressed food  wonderful everything housemade but quick serve model compromising end product soft paninis soggy ingredients   great option healthier food when you're know  thing but prefer made to order product may take little more time  <EOR> Zupas restaurant located rainbow Las Vegas  thought good place eat    discovered Jason's Deli beats them 10 1      1  More product money    2  Much better customer service  Except Mike he he's pretty good manager  3  No matter nationality treated respect   On evening September 28th 2016 approximately 6 30 p m  into Zupas buy salad greeter standing greeted everyone else but me   just let know only African American store time   I felt discriminated against return Zupas ever again unless change some store policies  <EOR> A little upset location  seemed if staff rushed when restaurant hardly busy  weren't super helpful friend never weren't nice staff eastern location  mention half cup poured instead actual cup which paid for  Maybe next time? just drive way    <EOR> When think Café Zupas three things immediately come mind    1   soup salad sandwiches bit pricey    2  portions small opinion    3  Pricey + Small Portions = Leave Hungry    I've visited Cafe Zupas number times  think service always point food tried very tasty  location always clean no matter busy are    For downside definitely small portions  observed careful attention detail into making meal  notice small portions consistent  Each item added salad carefully measured portioned    While really enjoy service food simply can't square price portions  <EOR> I love Zupas! food always fresh servers always upbeat happy serve you  just wish weren't stingy meat! ordered chicken salad baby scoop chicken  Probably 7 little shredded pieces it  Lol <EOR> Amazing spot fast staff ever experienced very generous portions big extremely affordable <EOR> Always crowded because your food prepared quickly  Perfect spot healthy eats even healthy eats because few different desserts  Every meal order comes chocolate strawberry  bisque soups favorite  taste freshness meals  fusion drinks awesome too  <EOR> I Protein cobb salad  Very fresh zupas Very fresh brown salad   <EOR> I area Monday week seen place finally opened  decided drop see like  definitely busy lunchtime area  work home don't usually lunch much  Anywho lots salads soups desserts menu  combo where try half selection combine another half something chose half garden chicken chop salad cup lobster bisque  did end eating bisque don't know tasted  homemade blue cheese dressing excellent though  every meal comes chocolate covered strawberry made back restaurant which see them doing cruising through line getting your fixins   Also added bonus folks skilled handling rush lunch super fast   So if salads soups combination those well      definitely stop give them try  <EOR> I start off saying love Zupas but NEVER come back location off 215 Rainbow again  SEVERE ALLERGY quinoa before placing order let employees know asked items NO quinoa cross contamination  said would sure food didn't touch any quinoa  ordered sandwich whole wheat bread  two bites started feel face itch swell asked 2 employees register if bread quinoa both confidently stated no sat back down thinking itching just head  few minutes later employees came back saying quinoa bread!

Super delicious food customer service <EOR> I Cafe Zupas few other times  seems very consistent across board all locations tried food same service same which good thing know your getting! Decent food decent price good service   I'm big fan Honey Bacon Club  don't care salads  soups pretty good but wish hotter when them eat just warm if don't eat fast enough almost cold  rather take home if heat bit  Love Garden Chowder its thick heavy chowder usually is   fan Wisconsin Cheddar smooth enough  Enchilada Tortilla soup pretty good  Red Pepper Lobster could use more lobster  think soup toppings rip off price  69 but sometimes can't resist adding some cheese soup  free side bread your order chocolate covered strawberry yum! Cakes dessert bars good crème brulee isn't real never again  I return Café Zupas where ever may be! <EOR> Had Turkey Bacon Avacodo Tomato Basil soup everything good tasted fresh similar quality Panera come back  <EOR> I must say use love place when first opened  But now raised price little feel portion size dwindled down extreme  More to go portions  Kale quinoa salad wow little is  paid $12 10 soup salad    As see picture added chicken Kale Quinoa salad  paid $1 79 extra chicken  pay sad amount chicken salad  even full size strips chicken bits pieces almost $2? usually don't complain price  But goodness little stingy portion almost $2 extra chicken  know restaurants try portion food food cost  would know use Sous Chef  But price food really think portion sizes should looked little more carefully  personally think paid for  stated earlier use love place sad say give 2 stars  sure hope take criticisms into consideration  <EOR> I eaten several times since opened Rainbow  food fine if over dressed salads over sauced sandwiches   problem PUSHY service style employees' faults obviously corporate mandates  want order food peace   want read menu myself   hate pushy employees act  only when picked friend  would never inflict style service anyone hate Zupas it  <EOR> Best soup salad sandwich place! Fresh veggies fruits amazing ingredients  ordered mixed berries mango salad  Both top favorite salads kale spring mix  also ordered veggie sandwich wheat bread which best veggie lovers  also love always give chocolate strawberry your meal  <EOR> Great selection salads soups sandwiches  All fresh made order  process works well oil machine even though only open few weeks  kale quinoa salad quite good  chicken tortilla soup could little spicier  back  <EOR> First off don't scared if long line people trying order  actually pretty fast  takes long customers being ready order  Once order takes no time all prepare  Their SPECIAL isn't bad order sandwich half soup half salad $8 change  honest sandwiches kind small side but lack size FLAVOR  usually order ultimate grilled cheese dunk tomato soup which freaking AWESOME  Also cherry balsamic chicken salad BOMB DOT COM! Both must try  also nice assortment fruit infused waters which delish if your tired regular old fountain soda drinks  orange infused berry favorite  also yummy looking desserts which haven't tried yet because usually full which consist cheesecakes brownies  But all orders come chocolate covered strawberry which nice touch  <EOR> My boyfriend came first time week ago wondered why haven't tried any sooner  store clean ample seating  normally Panera if we're craving soup but wanted check place since nearby  ultimately say place way better  bigger variety bigger portions  difficult choose soup because allowed sample however many wanted all very delicious  settled Red pepper lobster soup crab avocado sandwich  Both delicious came bread chocolate covered strawberry  <EOR> Love place!   Honestly quick clean yumma affordable!!!!!   Chicken Pesto panini lobster bisque soup chicken barbecue salad   refreshing don't leave feeling all stuffed lethargic!! <EOR> I'd give place 5 but customer service ehh  came during lunch rush could tell staff bit overwhelmed   The salads good! really thinking laced crack because addicting  only wish large salad large salad  large salad option small  when ask extra chicken which pay extra extra 3 pieces   The place very clean lots seating  Plus chocolate covered strawberry which favorite part meal  <EOR> Love place!!! happy now close apartment Rainbow  used drive before Henderson only soups  Love it <EOR> The manager sean dope!! He's red shirt mustache cool dudes  <EOR> We dining Zupas good 3 4 times week especially since close now new location rainbow   Quality food excellent however staff all same page could use some serious training ! toppings salads which supposed measured vary quite bit depending serving   Sometimes buy 2 extra topping just normal amount ! Last week picked   slow   4 people working 2 salads probably necessary ! confused   come home realize husbands salad also drenched vinegar asked mine along side ranch   4 kids couldn't run back redone over $8 salad trash ! next night let manager know happened didn't even apology ! Tonight prob made most mad portions vary much just 1 serving chicken husband request 3   large salad 7 toppings he 1 left then paid 2 additional   girl decided she would  charge 2 additional proteins instead regular toppings which $1 more each then regular   place needs game plan! If want ration toppings maybe need real scooper serving size instead tiny Spoon whose portions vary person dishing them ! <EOR> The sandwiches kinda small but price can't really complain  tried four sandwiches Cuban best  most meat pork really tender  If stick sandwiches small cheap lunch  But if soups salads add all add ons charge 65 cents each   I liked Cuban much ordered more sandwiches later  screwed order gave away sandwiches  gave dessert trouble  Million Pound bar something that  If eat whole thing sitting gain million pounds  very rich  Gf liked but took almost week finish it  Coconut chocolate chips peanut butter some kind brownie graham cracker base  free chocolate covered strawberry enough me  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised cafe zupas!   The pick two option amazing deal  am  used Panera serving size delighted see pick two came whole sandwich generous portion soup    I pesto chicken sandwich only negative thing say really wanted more pesto  bread crunchy soft chicken smothered cheese topped sprouts  Very good!   I choose cauliflower soup oh goodness know cauliflower doesn't sound great fantastic! Creamy cheesy seasoned well!   My husband opted cheddar bacon topped soup which made much better!   The pick two also came slice baguette bread soft crusty bread chocolate dipped strawberry    We back sure! <EOR> Cafe Zupas finally opened southwest side Vegas! time alive  Both exterior interior very modern industrial high ceilings mix wood metal accents  organization bit strange seeing enter through single instead double door awkwardly snake your way through dining tables order line  should followed Chipotle's footsteps separated section against wall line    There plenty seating even though line long moved very quickly  Employees MOST efficient but many them inefficiency negligible  much signage menu options seems little confusing daunting first  Basically order your salad sandwich first order soup dessert later if want some    My parents opted share two preset combos although order everything separately salads custom made    Conclusion? Price stellar food much healthier most fast casual restaurants there  There's great variety choices but find all flavors strong salty sweet much sauce   could barely finish kale quinoa salad because drenched sweet dressing made sick  just ask dressing side next time  sandwiches kind small dinky looking though  little chocolate strawberry nice touch   Great place stop quick lunch   Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 [3 100] <EOR> This first time restaurant say very pleased  really good food nice clean restaurant   bit pricy but over all good experience  <EOR> Strawberry Harvest chicken salad Italian cold sandwich combo half half excellent die for <EOR> How possible yet review Cafe Zupas? favorite places lunch just specifically location all excellent  much variety fresh salads soups sandwiches  salad bar your dreams  Ive even used catering few times work service outstanding  <EOR> DEFINITELY fan  kind bummed they're closed Sundays though    I love getting Try 2 Combo  usually opt half salad half soup  love clam chowder but fan theirs  most likely cause celery  Prefer Panera Bread's clam chowder    I'm cycling through all salads slowly but far California Protein Cobb winner  long way until done trying more menu expect update future but now highly recommend especially if just want feel healthy when eat   <EOR> Always solid no matter location  People very friendly  Take your time! Customize want many choices desserts hard say no to! Feed family four under $30  The tea water drinks yummy  <EOR> cafe Zupas great concept lot verity's fro salads soups sandwiches kids meals great healthy side which good he'd find healthy choices no days kids  pesto chicken sandwich soup French onion which little salty but ok  sandwich amazing next time going sandwich salad combo  But other then soup being salty great experience thanks Cafe Zupas <EOR> Love food but portions service horrible! asked if could few more pieces lettuce because 8 leave does cut when comes salad only told no but wasn't even option buy more??? don't know love food but just seems everything thing else seems going downhill fast  Sad say last visit but if want amazing side salad $6 it! good note mushroom bisque world protein cobb salad can't beat! <EOR> We love coming one  location doesn't seem busy henderson location no matter time eat  Food always fresh service always pretty good  only thing don't parents high chairs lock wheels  always clean high chair choose  restaurant always clean but should spend little more time cleaning high chairs  Kids spill things odd places  Other then that  Pretty great place   <EOR> This place should 5 stars across board  Extremely affordable healthy  whole sandwich half salad still nice amount right under $9  eat least 2 times each week minimum  <EOR> I really enjoyed visit cafe zupas!  5 5 Cleanliness 3 5 Soup 4 5 Salad 5 5 Atmosphere 5 5 Customer Service  It pretty busy when came but line pretty fast  concept pretty cool  chipotle salad bar choose sandwiches soups  pick two combo but hard decide  girl front line really helpful! She suggestions answered all questions   The food pretty good  Healthy food good food  also natural drinks which cool! give piece bread chocolate covered strawberry  Yumminess  Overall good quality salad sandwiches  only issue soup wasn't hot when eating it  But other I'd definitely suggest cafe zupas! <EOR> This first visit Cafe Zupas say decent is   I wasn't love panini neither mom probably steer clear those future just stick regular sandwiches soups salads   My mushroom bisque delightful  Creamy rich right amount mushrooms  would come back just soup when mood again   The only thing didn't care restaurant layout  All chairs ere huddled closely together made pretty difficult people navigate around restaurant since no clear path ordering line trash drink station  Everyone kept bumping into another became quite irksome  Since just recently opened sure small tweaks made improve learn    The staff all very new well slightly more difficult order should've given fact repeat order three separate times moved down line  Might little easier if could just say once someone could write down  hard ordering item but when trying remember everyone party wanted every time repeat entire order became harder recall each subsequent interaction    Otherwise decent quick eat spot bites go  <EOR>
