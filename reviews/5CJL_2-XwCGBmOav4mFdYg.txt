My main reason mediocre rating #1 prices #2 just don't place   I think having stage cheesy Thai restaurant  Thai's know down karaoke sure everyone's family machine home but unfortunately talent choose restaurant entertainment definitely just home   The Thai videos playing also just cheesy   And please turn some lights night most diners drunk can't see   I've couple times  first time when friend visiting state he's chef's son   bit discount even free entree but price Thai food    It nice establishment far decor isn't little hole wall but add mediocre service equation just doesn't me  Maybe  voice Thai mom left instilled head food always better any restaurant cheaper  Krung Siam doesn't prove mom wrong   I've grilled beef salad version combination pho pad se ew yellow chicken curry   Pho definitely mediocre beef salad really good quality side sticky rice microwaved much pad se ew good yellow chicken curry lot filler   Their Thai tea sucks too   Overall just convinced there's anything special place any category  food decent prices understandable service medicore   I'd only back late night craving most Thai places closed late night  <EOR> i reluctant try place because reviews but friend mine told good it  Green curry duck  put simply THUS FAR best green curry ever duck  flavorful  order order DID give things order needs ONLY reason why didn't give them 5 stars because rice container wasn't packed everyone else does  order cost $17 but man o man some good stuff  advice DON'T pay attention bad reviews place good  back fo shizzle  <EOR> I only give place 2 stars because staff great   food looks amazing but  all  flavor just wasn't there   husband's pork looked over cooked bacon slabs  paid extra shrimp scallops which both rubbery texture totally tasteless   Save your money try someplace else if you're wanting Thai food Vegas  <EOR> One fav getaway spots Vegas super big chill everyone incredibly friendly   across China town away strip when need breather two   But only $5 7 when uber strip  Yes please don't drink drive!!!

Check  Solid Thai flavors? Check! dining Krung twice food does disappoint but am sure become repeat eats  sampled tom kha gai tom yum soups red curry dish simply called Broccoli  bowl soup quite generous both soups rich pleasing flavor  However also come served lots herbs roots contribute flavor which mildly frustrating if you're chew down lemongrass galanga  admit may white girl thing but end putting all those things side because seem tough chew  Am wrong? I decided Google thanks Kasma Loha unchit article http www thaifoodandtravel com ingredients lemongrass html learned soups lemongrass serves stock ingredient flavor broth tough pieces meant chewed eaten  Thai people usually strain them before serving know eaten cannot some suck lemongrass pieces delightful hit flavor  So more authentic way serve soups am just being baby    The curry good  Broccoli great wok flavor but sauce little light steamed tofu isn't favorite   So why won't repeat eat? most likely late night destination given its hours fact during day some fave go to spots  late night live entertainment which created less ideal dining environment  simply gentleman guitar semi karaoke set but little loud prone drunk hijinx  If also drunk wildly entertaining but if just hungry boozy lady sitting stage doing best belt Bob Dylan other songs guitar man simply just doesn't know close 20 minutes simply frustrating  don't even know if supposed karaoke if she just decided she right sing  appreciate well done Thai karaoke throw down but happening here  suppose restaurant isn't completely blame patron's less ideal manners but kept hoping someone would kindly escort back table lure some free delicious item   If walk door see man stage probably decide meal given opportunity microphone takeovers  However don't think you'll disappointed food service acceptable  Definitely worth late hour when you're running options hey perhaps danger late night karaoke your thang!
