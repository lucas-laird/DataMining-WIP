Hmm lets see     I ordered #10 which Pho pretty much everything rare steak brisket tendon tripe flank also ordered Iced French Filtered Coffee condensed milk   First things first taste broth good  nice clean taste but lacked fragrance probably due lack spices herbs  enjoyed all meat especially tendon big slices rather small bite size pieces used to  brisket tender fatty tripe tender too  give good amount rare steak wasn't freshest but still all right  servers nice enough give extra side bowl hot broth cook rare steak  particularly liked noodles thin soft soaked broth well  looking fish sauce but wasn't table! Whaaat? Vietnamese restaurant without fish sauce?  blasphemous! asked server stored fridge  close! ready give 1 star if didn't any   For six people definitely didn't give enough bean sprouts basil  toss entire plate which did plus some more because couple friends against bean sprouts basil   I waited waited coffee filter through into cup when took off filter barely half full    Plus bottom condensed milk! Uhhhh enough especially when running fumes  When poured coffee into ice thick! mostly condensed milk bit extra strong tasting coffee  failed sorry   The service good  army people just standing waiting serve! attentive refilled water brought whatever needed timely manner  Also food came quick   Overall coffee complete failure but did enjoy pho  receive good amount meat decent size bowl Pho  favorite tendons thin noodles easy eating slurping  broth light clean but lacked fragrance  Would come back next visit?

No way but figured Vietnamese friends would know better me  ahead separate review into two parts food service    Food pho just ok  Pho bo vien which Pho meatballs  thought soup little bland me  portion size decent lot meat mine which good  price little higher used but its Vegas Cal bad guess The question asked myself would come place if located Cal  question probably not  food very average nothing made stand out    Now service order came pretty quick which liked however thats where service interesting  ask napkins seriously restaurant doesn't give napkins start off ? Someone group ordered rice pork chop looked good but ask 4 5 times knife  Overall service pretty bad asian people    I told Vietnamese places ideal good food fast care service  certainly true place except food just decent  <EOR> Stepping into restaurant gives perception food going taste good because aromatics place  But Abercrombie store smell deceiving    The pho satisfactory  broth came hot but nothing special  Noodles flavorless well    I sad see bánh hi dish butchered  rice vermicelli woven just fine but choice meat just bad  meats off skewer find American restaurant  proper way sautee meats some onions sauce  meat just lacking any real flavor  much failure such traditional dish   Like most Asian restaurants service? sit down order eat ask check pay leave   While Pho satisfactory issue bánh hi disappointing  many other comparable Vietnamese places might well those other places instead  <EOR> The spring rolls really delicious! food good too! only bad thing service   they ignored dad basically waiter! <EOR> For lunch shared bowl pho tai rare steak accompanied fresh basil herbs lemon bean sprouts   liberal skirt Sriracha chili happy   also shared delicious order goi cuon steamed egg rolls shrimp noodles veggies peanut dipping sauce  Highly recommended anything ails you  <EOR> 3 7 18 OPEN again place looks pretty remodeling wonderful staff still friendly nice food still great always Glad your OPEN <EOR> Stopped going because owners give attitude when try use card pay  because Vietnamese them ok ask Vietnamese person pay cash so keep off books pay taxes more money which causes huge inconvenience customer  would never ask white guy pay cash if he wanted use card  2015 people hardly carry cash anymore! isn't Vietnamese community Westminster where commonplace  sure guys already underpay your workers can't believe going nickel dime customers well  Luckily lived almost year now discovered plenty good Vietnamese restaurants popping everywhere  <EOR> Food generous portion   hot tea good warm heart  Server friendly listen special request order    Other waiting while find menu everything super   Pho' 8 dog house  Pho' 1 comes front now  <EOR> I've eaten lot Vietnamese over years  am impressed place all  table where sat weren't clean  tea tasted cup used holding soup   chicken tomato ordered tasted imitation Peruvian dish  <EOR> You know Pho when pass many buffets Las Vegas jump car hot bowl goodness   current buffet prices pho steal deal   Pho 1 doing great job   experience pho limited San Gabriel area Los Angeles   I'd admit pho really tasty all regular add on's Los Angeles Onions one   One thing disappointed spring rolls   tightly wrapped dipping sauce very good   ended dipping spring rolls fish sauce instead   They good job Vietnamese coffee too   Skip rolls Pho   Just know place strip stretch Spring Mountain road packed Asian restaurants yes massage parlors   tons options explore   Just remember happens Vegas     stays Vegas  Except pho telling about  <EOR> This long overdue review  many times but never left review gonna super looooong novel    We usually come once week every other week order giant bowl pho pho Xe Lua meaning pho XL size regular pho    We broth  husband hated pho because first bad experience but he really likes here  don't noodles substitute flat rice noodles which more similar actually use pho Vietnam    Service just okay even less average  drop your water your food never come back  might back ask if things okay if lucky  Sometimes service bad today example  giant bowl looks pathetic feeling just put same portion regular bowl into XL bowl pour lot broth it  just even close amount usually get  When asked manager supervisor good thing speak Vietnamese argued back forth eventually he said did look less normal gave more noodles meat though    The charbroiled pork noodles #47 #48 good too  Sometimes sauce little salty put much fish sauce don't fish sauce much    Another good dish #80 grilled marinated beef wrapped lettuce noodles  only thing grill wrap yourself table  But very good really popular dish here    #91 grilled pork meatball little sweet dry taste  enjoyed first few bites but eventually tired dryness    #63 Bun bo Hue very flavorful  If don't pork blood ask substitute more beef    #95 just ehhh  bland  wouldn't recommend getting all unless pour bowl fish sauce more salty    Overall food gets 4 stars service 2 5 stars  total 3 stars  <EOR> If could give lower rating would  Don't wrong food good BUT waiter served dish didn't order  naturally friends poked around food until waiter realized he served wrong table  he takes dish table re serves people next us    can't even believe just witnessed  <EOR> Their pho best find Vegas far  However rest menu only ok  meats very dry  7 friends all said meat dry  I'd only come pho egg rolls   it  <EOR> This favorite place pho  can't say best because down through years but still best me  only other option #8 street heading west right before Jones  friends coming place last 15 years  used true hole wall holes wall then upgraded joint LCD tvs then removed LCD tvs  guess decided showy  charge those prices then renovate marble floors countertops LCD tvs pretend affordable???
