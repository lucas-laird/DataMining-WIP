I eat least once week  best BBQ Las Vegas far  best coleslaw ever eaten  pulled pork amazing  Juicy tender very tasty  St louis Ribs really meaty  also excellent sauces depending your mood  Always very good service  <EOR> I didnt actually visit location but tried booth BITE Las Vegas I love Famous Dave's favorite BBQ places but festival things little overdone  see pics ribs little crispy I 4 BBQ Ribs  But BBQ Pork Sandwich right point I love pork BBQ sauce  Somewhat disappointed ribs but $5 4 $5 sandwich bad deal  <EOR> Yesterday third visit location because unlike other location mall great service here  Even when came fathers day great time awesome service   Yesterday completely appalled management   or lack thereof    We sat booth clear shorthanded  five tables sat once poor two servers floor  table five sat once very large party teenagers few more tables coming after  Therefore took few minutes greeted  Now worked restaurants 16 years including management beyond  know things run  older man table near came over asked if greeted said no he walked away  assumed he another customer told waitress when she came over realized just huge hit wanted look over menu anyway didn't want jump weird guys bandwagon if he causing fuss front  She said no he actually someone corporate  Ahhh ok  why would he drink order instead going off delegate people greeted because busy causing wait additional five minutes??  So order food whole time man wandering around staring tables notebook making notes  He comes table few times staring empty glasses  Again place slammed see everyone scrambling around doing stupid BBQ presentation EVERY table  asinine  guests waiting service but still insist your servers through long ass presentation every table??? time efficient?   Now since corporate guy doing nothing help any situation wave down ask since server busy if he could help some  refills  tell face he used being asked anything physical  He looked crack said GIRL right away  immediately flashed back plantation days   the girl? she going come over poofy white hat say yessa massa? She server  wanted walk moment   He DOING NOTHING but still refused lift finger refills  Instead he wandered find manager waitress them it  IF above pouring drink restaurant then should working any aspect if Famous Dave himself he better refill   GUEST SERVICE  servers did need someone write note greet take care guests know that  needed extra pair hands  Standing ordering them around going more servers appear them faster   sweat shop mentality  man should ASHAMED   As manager any respect he should helping greet tables  Why would walk away table yet greeted try find someone already slammed beyond comprehension? Why would greet them yourself? more important write notes know busy?   In customer service business no above doing anything  manager should never afraid bus table  no reason someone works Famous Daves should walked away table without greeting themselves  no reason should gotten FOUR rounds refills table because yelled manager server someone else  literally received three waters each mom three cokes  All because asshat corporate could bothered lift finger  run business?   I hope someone high reads am emailing them well does something because whole visit BS  watched YOUR corporate guy SIT TAKE NOTES  hour half dissatisfied guests lack service TRY them happy  SHAMEFUL  <EOR>
