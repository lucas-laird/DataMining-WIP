<EOR> I'm trying hard write review without using curse words profanity  sum all place location sucks!!!!  The lady took order very rude short  Before she even took order she phone back didn't even acknowledge until 6 minutes waiting register  asking all came honey ham swiss wrap she pointed said everything picture! rudest service ever experienced   So just ahead ordered flatbread sandwich banana 24oz mango smoothie  flatbread sandwich dripping some kind weird honey dressing she only gave napkin already soaked sauce leaking  banana bruised smoothie thickest drink ever had  Literally brick hard! no way possibly consume smoothie through straw forced eat spoon   Overall EVER EVER EVER visit location unless want $10 throw away lunch break  am upset myself that  Tropical Smoothie never money again! <EOR> This nice place when you're waiting around class start across street class early  frequently toward end Spring semester warmer   The food smoothies good but sometimes smoothie feels meal  I'd much rather Starbucks  healthier don't away feeling need nap  <EOR> This place smells horrible fruit bar doesn't look clean it   Left Jamba Juice only couple blocks away  <EOR> I'm upset hat discovered today   usually don't order online pick through drive thru  walked into them making flatbread stuck microwave  Now suppose healthier choice   If wanted microwaved food would myself ! Microwaves kill any nutrition food ! now eat nothing but filler   Tropical smoothie owners really need throw microwave away use oven! gross disgusting! <EOR> They recently renovated location looks great definitely need it! But service remains inconsistent  very timely lines long  Sometimes id wish id gone Red Rock food court instead  Ive also unfortunate mishaps location  <EOR> The best smoothies ever had  i few times week  try berry blast island intensity  its loaded bananas strawberries blueberries  also acai pomegranate juice  they also sandwhiches wraps soups  the soups muy deliciouso! <EOR> their vegetarian meat place good! fails though always only employee working absolutely no sense  couple times veggie meat wait 10 15 min before telling another time kid gave actual chicken  Now just sure ask right away wish would pull together bc wraps flatbreads amazing 24 7! <EOR> Visited location few times every time just smells bad  All counters tables dirty only person working  location gets business customers but experience ruined waiting long person behind counter touches face doesn't wash hands after  Never again    <EOR> I stopped frequenting much used but few times stopped since remodeled smoothies tasting better! mobile orders ready when promised but most importantly taste great worth money  Truth told most times place orders online BF pick them can't speak customer service itself but long taste great happy  <EOR> I always come late night island green smoothie fix  staff always friendly tonight no exception  young lady counter sweet smoothie hand minute ordered  Love place! <EOR> I've never bothered writing review but would agree other reviewers  WORST LOCATION!  couldn't order right food came cold cheese flatbread wasnt melted employees didn't close smoothie lid tight   which caused HAVOC new car!!!! Even if place close house   I'm NEVER GOING BACK!! <EOR> Dude c'mon   First all only reason giving them 3 stars because guy working w running circles around girl  She first all didnt smile hunched over looking miserable  She made smoothies which when other guy took two orders made 2 smoothies sandwiches she still didn't smoothies   When she finally finished soaking wet other guy hand them us  Unmarked could tell he hates working cos seriously gllooommmyyy there  karalynn whatever think need change occupation  <EOR> We love place! favorite avocolada  Definitely overpriced don't offer smaller size option  But keep going back because such good flavor  <EOR> I given wrong items   When finished making smoothie sandwich didnt even say anything   just left counter   didn't smile   ask if Chipotle chicken wrap   girl no clue   then asked another guy twice   He said um   Then he said yes     Well wasnt   Employees don't smile   Muscle Builder smoothie without protein     1 star  <EOR> Went first and last time few weeks ago while visiting Las Vegas  NEVER again   Only person working counter noon hour very slow service   Ordered fish tacos two $4 99   very nice pictures window over counter good sized tacos filled brim   tacos smallest things ever saw bite each taco mostly shell   ripoff   even tasty either   Don't food items if here   also saw them making smoothies other customers   Looked 90% ice each one   Probably best avoid them altogether   corporate office isn't any better contacted them never responded  <EOR> My review owner waited line 30 mins because only person doing all work 12 17 2015! no way run business! never come again don't recommend anyone else either! <EOR> Bought 6 dollar smoothie payed 20 but then cashier walked away without giving change when brought she laughed said sorry trying keep tip mention bad smell  roaming room    want drink your smoothie <EOR> We order location all time because love avocolada smoothie order same thing every time 2 years gotten right ONCE! Unbelievable! certain every cannot read take direction! You'll better quality service McDonalds location! <EOR> Why only employee working place EVERY TIME come here  Smoothies great food but really need hire staff  worth waiting line 30 minutes another 20 your order  joke!!!! <EOR> Walked 5 00 am late night wanted check place out    Wish could give review based service food drinks but can't because neither     I work Starbucks totally understand need prep day but lack service unacceptable  person working back glanced multiple times did nothing  No acknowledgement no right   NOTHING     Just hid back if weren't standing right front register   Why keeping employees payroll if hate lives why waste money keeping store open 24 hours if turn away customers anyway?! just don't it     If could give zero stars would  think workers should some coffee because need wake fuck up  <EOR> Chicken flatbread burnt dry smoothie mostly ice watered down  order same things every time any Tropical Smoothie couldn't even finish food  Disgusting  <EOR> AVOID LOCATION PLAGUE  gone few times purchase smoothies without any problems  Unfortunately last time LAST  bought four wraps three smoothies myself family  specifically asked cashier Darren if he could split transaction between two cards because knew did enough entire transaction accounts  The total $32 99 asked run $31 00 first card remaining $1 99 second  He looked bit confused because think he properly trained handle transactions between two cards    He ran first card said cleared $31 00  When asked run second card he said worry because totaled $31 00 did owe remaining balance  left store thinking much it  next day when checked bank account noticed Darren run entire amount $32 99 card  Due caused account bounce charged $35 00 NSF fee  upset but thought Tropical Smoothie Cafe would take care since mistake  WRONG!  I back Tropical Smoothie Cafe asked speak manager  spoke Darren again apologized mistake gave manager's name number  His name George Aranda way Darren said he hoped George would able issue refund NSF fee charged  When called George he defensive said he would speak owner order refund  week spoke George texted George picture reciept well print screen transaction back account showing mistake caused account negative  heard back since    I called back again hoping reach George store  spoke Nicole said she heard issue occured experience store  She said George sent email telling all employees no longer accept two card transactions  Wait   if reason screwed $35 because your employees properly trained split transactions between two cards but instead actually teaching them procedure correctly just going avoid altogether? NO SENSE    I filed negative report Better Business Bureau contacted corporate office twice  continue contact corporate office until hear back someone regarding issue    George owner yet contact right  pray location business because terrible customer service  People should treated way  noticed first person given location star  <EOR> This spot reminds Jamba Juice but u also order other things such sandwiches  Sits next movie theater   <EOR> One star  If you're owner manager you're getting lone star because some your staff sucks  won't say all because don't spend all week coming back hoping better customer service but recent couple visits its fairly bad   Instance one Young brunette girl way more interested chatting other girl back then focusing orders  line people waiting yet somehow discussing snapchat main priority  Always pleasure when someone tells nice day back turned   Instance two New guy overcharges order free boost sunday  Thats ok he's learning he wants right customer offering extra boosts compensate  problem he's clearly having difficulties processing orders making smoothies other guy pre occupied being fake busy offer help  cashier new off your lazy tail help goodness sake    Instance three won't one  Krayvings down street pay extra $2 better service  <EOR> Awful service served everyone before me  When finally received smoothie mostly water  Threw card counter hostile towards everyone she served  March 26 2017  <EOR> THANK CHARLESTON LOCATION KNOWING PINEAPPLE TWIST! miss drink menu! <EOR> With couple dozen locations scattered around Las Vegas valley Tropical Smoothie Cafe probably store near good place stop if you're mood refreshment   You'll find standard assortment fruit based smoothies menu well superfood smoothies fruits high antioxidants greens supercharged smoothies featuring added proteins indulgent smoothies options include chocolate peanut butter coconut coffee   trying Sunny Day Kiwi Quencher Mocha Madness seems they're all consistently good   The menu also includes light foods wraps sliders sandwiches salads just name few items they're open all day   menu items every meal even kids menu!  The restaurants all clean service friendly order prepared quickly   Consider giving light food items try but sure chain named smoothies   Delicious hot day workout! <EOR> This probably worst tropical smoothie too  4th time coming location because close home but disappointed every time  workers rude honestly feel more frustration because always behind doesn't seem enough staff keep demand  location dirty restrooms mess  Would hate see kitchen area is  Guests ignored counter greeted when come in  never waited less then 15 20 mins smoothie  food items always seem off  Seems don't follow same recipe all other tropical smoothies follow  hard believe management turns blind eye location all bad reviews  When yelp rating 2 stars overall literally scream location needs help  No standards leadership found location  Doesn't belong Summerlin area  <EOR> Ok where start? smoothie sunrise sunset Splenda really good  protein essentially lunch  bad 260 calories whole thing! However don't many other healthy options including wraps salads all extras thrown in  low carb but weren't sure if wheat  people register weren't very friendly patiEnt answered questions but seemed rushing getting frustrated questions  I'd surprised if nobody else ever asked any questions     <EOR> The workers friendly food came quickly tasted delicious able study few hours unbothered!

Would definitely back <EOR> Ordered Uber Eats while work order wrong three different ways sandwich wasn't edible  attempted called location several time ask them redo sandwich no answered phone even though still open  Left message without call back  <EOR> I just ordered tropical chicken salada sandwich cause just fav sandwich world just because toasted but helloooo just toasted then  remember just freaking lazy guy working shift just because dont want turn oven send awful sandwich he didn't even cut half disappointed <EOR> We today  over 15min wrap  Then another 15 Min more drink  feel bad girl works there  She all herself  Everyone happy  need cashier person food drink  gross  She touch all money then turn around food  Please hire another person help her  person whole place bad  money drink already  sure hire another person  <EOR> Tropical Smoothie some tasty menu items other smoothies but today smoothie  main problem very tasty beverages added sugar  fact if want them less sugary choose Splenda version  fruit needs no added sugar fact add sweeteners place rarely visit  healthy fruit smoothies home    For occasional treat hot summer day Tropical Smoothie definitely hit spot  Also If people and dog watch nice place few shops sharing decent sized outdoor seating area where families enjoy some time together people bring pets hang shade while  <EOR> The smoothies always very delicious here! Very good customer service especially Brandon! <EOR> Baja wrap doesn't avocado even though says menu  man rudely adamant gaslighting when pointed menu saying acting mad irrational it  don't think more irrational menu saying thing employee saying another thing    Food OK but smoothies taste oddly diluted  <EOR> Worst Tropical Smoothie ever to  think any positive review received location mistake supposed across street Red Rock Casino  prepared wait excessively long time them serve person behind before you  place embarrassment franchise  honestly first negative review written Yelp but deservingly written  <EOR> I keep coming back because food smoothies good!!!  This location always tricky parking because there's many store fronts facing all 15 parking spots  But once you're inside always plan waiting because menu items made to order    No drive thru here  No more punch cards  But LOTS covered outdoor seating which always nice! <EOR> Great variety smoothies coffee chocolate peanut butter options too  usually some new limited flavor which lucky special deal $2 often  Just join loyalty club enjoy periodic $2 smoothie $2 99 new food item deal  store near Starbucks expect parking sparse  wait but always enjoyed smoothies here! <EOR> Staff friendly enough 1star smoothies ok 1star   Forgot smoothies literally 20 min later    guy break busy flirting girlfriend came other tells another customer slow  stand he waiting something?      reply yes smoothies tell ordered wait all over again  <EOR> Absolutely terrible service   ONLY customer store still wait over 15 minutes smoothie while employees socialized   Then given excuse the smoothie remade which blatant lie   Avoid all costs! <EOR>
