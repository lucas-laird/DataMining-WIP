Unfortunately food fairly basic few cases less than   some Turkey but reach over counter add gravy wanted   Odd setup   sandwiches which guess OK but want buffet   pool bar that   The chicken dry soup salty all all just basic   smaller buffet don't expect ton choices compared Strip buffet's but wouldn't mattered food amazing     In end served purpose which filled afternoon could gamble more   back hard tell but would probably want 1 2 off coupon  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would! 21 99$ seafood more buffet the only dinner have   price thought would big selection  cold shrimp muscles oysters water ice looked sitting least 5 hours  Eek  gross! would spend extra 5 6 dollars rio instead more food defiantly safer eat since take more care far temp  Goes! never back buffet! guess ppl call toilet bowl buffet!
