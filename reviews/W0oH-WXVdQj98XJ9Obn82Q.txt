You tell nothing fresh  ranch bland  Everything tasted manufactured    Not once dad ever offered another beverage  Mai tai   such easy way bill higher no even thought ask    The hostess? Non existent  when she did round zero personality positivity    We ordered couple burgers   fresh baked buns? Maybe them because bun actually brown color  other white    To top all off right rate place 2 stars random bad attitude hostess comes table auctions off ribeye steak  told finished meal she stood blankly moment just respond Oh  <EOR> Got lil before 3pm only 3 tables  Slow day  When bf beer BUG it  Disgusting!!
