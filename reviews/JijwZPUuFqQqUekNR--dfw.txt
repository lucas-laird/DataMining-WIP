splitting escargot appetizer which included mushroom caps stuffed snail garlic butter then baked puff pastry   Reminded being cruise ship b c thats probably only other place tried escargot   wasn't choice but enjoyed it   menu states use prime grade beef anxiously pleased   Tried smallest cut prime rib @ 12 oz alright   Nice texture flavor but mine little more done med rare ordered but didn't mind much b c 1 hungry 2 plate under $20 score value   serve generous pour red wine glass conservative selection most being around $7 $10 score value again   So place quite memorable steakhouse but also quite above casino coffee shop   fairly satisfied paid   if wasn't brought probably would never set foot but when traveling just flow see where takes Vegas usually better not  <EOR> Great Western
