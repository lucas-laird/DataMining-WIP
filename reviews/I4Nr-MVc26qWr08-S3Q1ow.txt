Without swiss cheese sauerkraut sandwich pretty dry even mustard nearly big looks pictures  Next time going reuben beef cheddar melt! <EOR> Las Vegas food options seem overwhelming sometimes but actually really difficult find simple yet affordable food  Greenberg's Deli inside New York New York perfect place extremely filling sandwich fairly reasonable price! People rave Earl Sandwich but found nothing special aside low price  However Greenberg's some really quality meats don't need ton dressing before inserting between two slices fresh bread  ordered Greenberg's Reuben marbled rye came pastrami piled least two inches thick well generous helping sauerkraut  love combination savory meat sour cabbage but only half sandwich struggling down other half! size sandwich insane but definitely don't skimp quality all  If you're looking quick meal pad your stomach whatever you're doing Vegas Greenberg's definitely place go! <EOR> Yum   it rocked very tender meat!! Cafeteria style service but suck butter cup food good  <EOR> As far sandwiches place offers pretty good sandwiches  biggest sandwich person but since planning doing buffet dinner wanted something light   sandwiches definitely lighter side! huge!   I ordered regular toasted turkey sandwich hubby club both wheat bread  shared water total came $25 pricey but delicious    There very limited seating right inside shop but plenty seating right outside little street area    Definitely recommend place  sure if compete Earl Sandwich but if area strip come back! <EOR> Walking around strip looking something fast tasty eat  Look no further place   I staying Excalibur last week decided grab bite NY NY found Greenbergs right behind times square bar  didn't huge line decided two NY sky rises lemonade potato salad  Fantastic!!!!! bread nicely toasted meats fresh hot coleslaw mild but gave great crunch thousand island brought whole sandwich together  Potato salad prepackaged but still good  Lemonade no much    Only complaint ordering system bit confused especially if multiple people waiting samething  would use ticket system personally  Workers rather    charmless    Loads places sit around  paid 10 each sky rise 1 75$ potato salad that's right 3 lemonade  decent prices something good  great place decent lunch carry dinner beyond    Definitely worth stop  <EOR> I very surprised! sandwiches dinner quite good    There LOT meat sandwiches but despite over flavorful salty all    It simple meat easy chew order easily fill two people up  Definitely must try when LV  <EOR> I randomly stopped Greenberg's Deli sandwich while walking through New York New York casino  ordering process cafeteria style  Grab tray line end order pick your sandwich pay other end where exit line  decided simple Reuben $10 95 pastrami rye standard fixings swiss cheese sauerkraut thousand island dressing  Similar expect deli's NY meat sandwich sliced fresh right front you  Looking process thought would standing line long time but person behind counter worked fast kept line moving steady pace   The sandwich itself very big but could considered decent lunch sized portion  decent amount meat but its its piled sky high  going itself taste which really good  Definitely among best had  rye bread toasted perfectly  pastrami high quality its taste eclipsed sauerkraut thousand island dressing but shines through each bite  price also right considering strip Casino  Overall liked ate would problem stopping next time town  <EOR> Deliciousness biggest sandwich ever!!
