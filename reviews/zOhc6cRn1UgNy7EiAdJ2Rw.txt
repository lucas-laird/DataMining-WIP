So littlest 3rd Birthday yesterday course trip see Chuck E necessary  Friday night Las Vegas would thought place would mad house! definitely understaffed place disaster! bathrooms dirty scared use them! Needless say birthday boy didn't notice any he just wanted fun he did! Thanks Chuck E! <EOR> We used online coupon large pizza but medium  always busy  son doesn't seem care  But need more workers front prize stand  Prizes complete crap  But wouldn't expect much else  Every time take son he ends sick  cesspool germs always smells sewer walking in  But said son enjoys it  Unfortunately think may stop taking since he always gets sick  worth health  <EOR> We booked son's 3rd birthday party here  arrived party 5 50 party 6 00 Monday  greeted front all hands stamped  lead table host  Never seen spoke word again until 6 30  Kids all table finally host came took order tokens food  She took forever them too  did tokens until almost 7 00 food 7 30  slowest service ever  ask plates adults when food came out  She hardly table  did done cake until 8 00  party finally done 9 p m  never balloon table crown son  When leaving ask it  paying $159 small birthday package NEVER come again  manager front no help  busy other parties  ordered salad bar people going back salad bar dirty used plates manager didn't stop them  place gone downhill never return <EOR> It's run down most CEC's before there's lot parking even creepy back alley parking spaces don't park there!   being said just can't stand place  loud food terrible unless salad bar most games order does anyone watch kids??   I see allure birthday parties stop shop  show everything you  mean party isn't complete without dancing rat obnoxious party host? Kinda generic if ask me  You'll better off going Mini Grand Prix Pump Bounce U Discovery Museum far better experience  But much chagrin can't deny kids love suckered into taking them  hope they'll change mind place soon but until then guess suck up  Sensory overload ugh!! <EOR> This review specific location   many Chuck E's Vegas location usual being Henderson   first time maybe because Saturday night insane   place packed tons tons kids   Several games did work stole tokens but very happy different selection games seen other Chuck E's   Also seemed divide toddler appropriate games side games more skill orienated other side   When able locate worker tell them certain machine ate token would give few extra maybe because secretly knew would lose many tokens machines night    tricky part token stealing machines would take your token once let play then when decide want play again would steal token   did stand line prizes because just many people   soda machine ice but all eat salad bar usually always freshly stocked usually someone give new plate which used required law but noticed sign health department requirement removed all Chuck E salad bars    gate check guy he just left when arrived leave wait 2 minutes but he very apologetic   fight parking lot some individuals just left child's birthday party   rather scary some individuals argument cars obviously small children running parking lot     I would probably try location again but Saturday night  <EOR> Took son Chucky cheese birthday party he's two years old first time    first he seemed little freaked especially big mechanical rat think he thought wanted eat them   hour later ice cream cake smeared all over face  fact he cracked some girl head ski ball think he enjoyed himself  Some people call rat chunky but you're okay four stars <EOR> My son loves place!
