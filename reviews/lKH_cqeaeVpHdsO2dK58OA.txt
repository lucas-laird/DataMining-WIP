Well but gets end just bit expensive is  don't think walked away register without costing less $14 meal which think bit steep fast food burger meal  where In N Out wins over every time although lots people argue flavor better here  somewhat fence but if choice spending $6 double double meal $14 Smashburger meal no brainer even long line  Still lot people speak quite highly burger good meal no matter if you're willing spend little bit extra then all means indulge yourself  <EOR> Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!

SmashBurger also serves hot dogs few other options if something wrong some reason don't want huge wad man meat your mouth!    please don't try compare n across street two very different burgers very different places  each own incredible qualities  take star off little steep price hours only open till 10pm  <EOR> This awful! order completely wrong! Items missing  postmates menu items no longer menu  Such waste time energy  Patty salty theres maybe 3 thinnest slices mushrooms mushroom burger <EOR> If don't know order pricey little burger  However play your cards right worth it! think best bet build your own burger  regular size plenty big unless huge appetite  Any sauces veggies free choose many want  Cheese toppings bacon avocado grilled mushrooms extra $0 70 over $1 choose wisely   Personally goat cheese lettuce grilled onion pickles tomato smash sauce  Instead standard thousand island ketchup mayo combo In N spread signature sauce seems part mustard part mayo  Doesn't seem heavy don't feel bad eating burger  shouldn't anyway  doctor said cholesterol high      Anyway compare burger which less $5 say N across street? different larger def more options  But say compare much more pricey burger Ruby Tuesday Red Robin? Blows them park! Less half price those sit down places tastes way better too  Plus service much quicker cheapos don't really tip unless want to   Now if chicken where gets pricey  Around $7 yucky grilled chicken breast sandwich if going fried chicken patty well may well just all way damn burger! salads?

Anyway chose BBQ burger bacon cheese  Regular size  Also side haystack onions  Order done quickly took go   Okay here's opinion burger   liked bun nice change typical fast food bun nice   bacon nice flavor thought burger itself well balanced terms BBQ cheese onions maybe bit low onions but bad    Here's bad part burger pink places  asked wanted cooked definitely would well done eat hamburger meat ANY pink whatsoever  and yes burger cooked well done without drying if home myself professional cook ought able to    unhappy grossed pink areas  Various people said food greasy   didn't find problem   fact burger bit grease sheen plus me  did find haystack onions salty side   horribly but bit more saltiness would was rather thirsty finishing meal    meat itself burger didn't taste all wonderful   Just bit more quality typical fast food McD's type thing but much knocked out   bites just didn't taste wonderful   every now then haystack onions bit off flavor also like old oil    Would again?  Probably not   If lowered everything menu dollar maybe   understand aiming somewhat higher quality burger fast food but until cook burger without leaving pink would never eat again   shame because right track somewhat but many places aren't quite economy leaving bill over $8 00 person two items probably going bring back lot people   seemed friendly way greeted no complaints but say early day no else there   I'd them succeed but lower prices fully COOKING meat then might loyal customer <EOR> Food good fried disgusting service Pour tv  menu broken bathroom holder broken  Won't back <EOR> Good burgers but priced higher other fast food joints out  close work when mood hamburger <EOR> The burgers aren't bad fact quite tasty  part meal want complain side  sweet potato smashfries such small portion ridiculous  fries also extremely greasy limp  don't know if oil length cook them but just heavy inedible  same experience smashburger work think same all them now  much cheaper meal going across street much tastier side fries IN N OUT Burger meal  <EOR> Excellent!!
