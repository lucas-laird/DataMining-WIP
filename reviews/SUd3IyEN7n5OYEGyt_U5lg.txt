Right Jefes  taco! quickly realize mistake but tell home now tired working all week going back out  surprise he says should called   Well thought closed down didn't think look your number    Because closed mind  Then he says well email all info when ordered finally delete system then   thinking talk new customers? If I'd say ok man we'll catch next time   realize he probably upset he lost product but single torta sure isn't first time someone couldn't find them  Don't value new customer more single torta? If going operate gas station should probably expect lose little business due location  Plus yelp profile even website don't clear located Sinclair station shell  If would abundantly clear which gas station located just minimize customers might lose due being hard find  Im sure food good but due bad attitude won't trying them again  haven't missed place 17 yr don't think going forward either     Jefes also aren't clear website located Sinclair  Due difficulties finding them would suggest abundantly clear website Yelp where are  surely don't want people turning away because can't find them  <EOR> This place good since moving vegas haven't found good mexican food until Jefe's   Food bomb green salsa good wish could ordered some definitely dont judge book buy its cover walk inside wont regret it!!! <EOR> Great staff above beyond sure happy  Ben sure happy content service receive  Love fact Ben actually sat down made feel more just customer  Throughout whole meal he talked know us  above beyond standards! <EOR> We originally Southern California standard Mexican food pretty high little picky   always looking something yummy area    At first little apprehensive based location but love trying different places  Man worth it!

He recommended something else said next time if he doesn't ingredients something accommodate us    When want good burrito every time  Hands down  <EOR> Random joint gas station cool dude named Ben bringing SD Mexican food legitness Vegas  Awesome customer service along some proper grub  Try al pastor fries if need switch usual carne asada won't regret it <EOR> You think gas station food automatically think gross  think good food must hundreds people rate 5 stars  ordered AL pastor burrito 2 pounds yum pork bliss  Wife ordered Carne asada fries heavenly well  None garbage meat Robertos such serve all high quality meat here  Definitely some best mexican food around  If food quality nice seated restaurant you'd no qualms paying twice much  <EOR> Props place being able ridiculous amount business being gas station  always seen online posts but never knew exactly where located   We specifically street tacos disappointed! guess owners San Diego little flair cooking style  each carne asada al pastor chicken street tacos  $2 taco minimum 3 order steal  al pastor good! far favorite  green sauce spicy red sauce even spicier!
