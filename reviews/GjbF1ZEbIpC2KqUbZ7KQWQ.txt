I off work wanted grab bite eat around 8 15 8 15 doors locked!   I find kind odd seeing advertised time Yelp 9 00 also large banner posted outside store saying they're open until 10 00   Kind odd right?  *Edit* called multiple times 12 03pm over hour open place pickup order but doesn't seem open yet    so heck your hours Dynamite Grill? <EOR> Just left having lunch   Walk putrid smell sewer all over restaurant  waiting prescription filled Walgreens across street options limited    Guy taking order acted he really put there  Bf ordered 3 items total vegetable tempura avocado roll cream cheese chicken beef lunch special   $32 00  Seriously?   While waiting used restroom which even WORSE sewer smell  Food arrived  Immediately fruit fly flew into soy sauce  Bf's lunch special huge mainly more salad meat  avocado roll consisted 5 slices big circumference couldn't eaten bite thing falls apart each bite  Barely any rice tons avocado speck cream cheese  Veggie tempura barely any breading veggies still crunchy  all cooked    Only other table place when left same employee let table sit dirty least until left  Needed box retrieve back place where he sitting table ask one  parting words were just leave stuff table   coming back  <EOR> I really enjoyed food  Happy new option neighborhood   menu could use some work but staff helpful much issue  <EOR> I shrimp really good flavor special sauce die for!

Before Dynamite Grill opened pretty limited Kazuki Sushi across street  place just okay  favorite  But boy am glad Dynamite Grill opened up!   My first impression coming wow clean bright organized  Often times sushi restaurants barely read menu because dark  people own restaurant just sweetest people ever met  They're gracious feel they're happy restaurant    At first expected small sized sushi usually would see other sushi restaurant used to  But when opened box home surprised big size rolls  ordered Jerry's Special Caterpillar Roll Crunch Roll  Usually order least 4 rolls eat all other sushi restaurants  couldn't even through 2 rolls! Everything fresh flavorful  definitely new favorite place sushi! <EOR> Excellent food service  Huge portions great value  Kids adults enjoyed meal  Highly recommended!!!! <EOR> This place unbelievable service superb  girl front sweet helpful  food amazing! ordered crunchy roll wow awesome also ordered fried rice seriously absolute best fried rice ice ever had!

Gross!!!! <EOR> Finally checked Dynamite Grill tried several rolls spicy crab California rolls very good tempura perfect bad neighborhood  food joint  <EOR> I hate giving bad reviews going hold opinion until try place again couple weeks? months? however long takes them really ready open    I love supporting locals business whenever possible but just soon business  Rolls expensive veggie tempura pricey raw! Menu no description rolls ask chef explain  styrofoam plates boxes cups made all feel even cheaper    Plus toxic environment  <EOR> Great food  Fast service  Friendly staff loved food  Dynamite delicious  Poki spicy but good <EOR> I try teriyaki bowls  ordered chicken bowl all white meat  thigh meat  gyoza pretty decent  place clean but better food found elsewhere  Very average  Samurai Sam's does fast food teriyaki thing much better  <EOR> Horrible won't returning   outside media leads believe decent sushi place but don't fooled   fish fresh tasting sushi sloppy well done any sense word rice even sushi rice   prices charge same premium sushi restaurants   waste your money just your favorite sushi place thank me  <EOR> Overpriced bland chicken Katsu doesn't come dipping sauce  Thats  75 cents extra  can't fried rice side thats seperate made entree  If you're die hard asian might regardless  rest world  its below average expensive  <EOR> Hmm where start  driving back school today corner eye saw DYNAMITE SUSHI!

Also staff needs learn menu  new restaurant expect everyone ask questions especially when aren't any description menu educate your staff! girl couldn't even pronounce udon correctly    Scary!  Also combination fried rice totally burnt food slow come out  don't think expedite food well  Seems cook food time but rush because burnt weird right?

I excited when first saw establishment under construction could wait open  But boy   what tremendous disappointment!!! am Southern Highlands resident dinning options very limited neck woods!!  First decor As bland plain vanilla gets without hint ambiance!!! uncomfortable hospital environment  could only imagine Joe Bastianich Tim Love would say if episode Restaurant Start Up!! Plain walls no music no   style!! place felt ran money drastically cut corners had  If weren't signs would no clue Japanese restaurant!!   Prices Overpriced get!!  I ordered teriyaki chicken n beef entree  paid $16 dollars felt cheated amount food received! don't mind paying food but give money's worth!!  pieces fat blubber beef hardly any chicken!! food bad   but better  impressed   just   ok   2 Stars The wait bad order come out  10 minutes  ordered go  young girl counter very sweet nice  Great customer service   Bottom line Save your money elsewhere  Champagne prices beer quality restaurant plain vanilla ambiance!! <EOR> Ate first time yesterday   staff super friendly place completely empty   Tried Katsu surprised didn't use panko breading   end result heavier katsu wasn't terrible but wasn't expected either    katsu sauce good     threw out   Let's talk price!  husband katsu plate katsu bowl shared 1 sushi roll     $32!!!!

Only food found change your rice fried rice additional $3??   Umm $19 combo plate     ouch ! gotta step your game up   portions small   Use real plates instead paper serve restaurant style because doubt family orientated neighborhood going pay over $20 bucks 1 person eat   Let money's worth   Variety Food The name sushi express you're thinking variety sushi but much menu   Also no descriptions any rolls would need ask them it   Maybe suggestion would adding bento boxes lunch specials people combo hibachi sushi instead paying full price if want both      Atmosphere Seating limited if large group stay away   No music no decorations hear everything everyone    I hope change some things because love seeing new places succeed !!! know neighborhood excited something opening    now if want chicken teriyaki bowl would down street teriyaki madness 7 bucks if want your sushi fix your favorite sushi restaurant because you'll paying same price! <EOR> Hmmm start interior pretty bland lot seating more 2 people time  miso soup $2 50 pretty large bowl  definitely didn't skimp tofu but no seaweed it  really missed that!   Crunch Roll delicious  great presentation lots avocado  Usually there's tiny sliver inside but didn't skimp anything roll  $10 95 tho!!  lot small casual joint  husband doesn't sushi he going chicken teriyaki but when he saw prices he next door tacos instead  try again but probably just take roll  <EOR> Decided support Southern Highlands newcomer   Food awful guys   maybe bland side but  way better overly seasoned  wife food but see other reviewers saying spartan decor  Owners take 5 minutes put little love design  hard put some tunes   it'll help guys when you're working well    Then saw bill  Listen Southern Highlands considered remote neighborhood  Places Off Strip set standard pricing remember Italian restaurant tried match pricing except big difference  Off Strip gets didn't  business  Owners cautionary tale take seriously  can't charge super pricing type food  know know already your flyers printed    but guys  cheap replace  also digital menu   changing easy  Wouldn't rather lower prices more people trying rich off few?   I believe guys come rooting you  improve decor food quality pricing Southern Highlands come  <EOR> This place amazing twice only open 2 days   create yelp page could let everyone know  <EOR> All ambiance dmv none character  Teriyaki chicken weak no brown rice option over priced cook prepared speed smell  Good luck! <EOR>
