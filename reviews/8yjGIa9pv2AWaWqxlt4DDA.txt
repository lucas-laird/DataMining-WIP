Did she wait 20 minutes put order? People around getting food    The first dish arrive mini chorizo corn dogs  Flavor terrible no spice all  texture even worse  Next received item substituted salmon which crab ceviche  Completely over salted more tuna crab    Finally 3rd dish arrived hirame ceviche  When waitress described she mentioned special night which came salad  no salad  No greens  Nothing  least slightly tasty compared others but wasn't amazing  contemplated dessert but couldn't justify giving establishment another cent    I very glad some people planning dine couldn't it  would hate them suffer through meal  awful  Service poor food poor drinks poor    I say however place decorated nicely  Wouldn't bad stop beer before movie  just wouldn't eat  sure place stay open long pretty empty when words hostess reservations aren't really needed  <EOR> This review food but hosts  early dinner  arrived told hostess cannot seated inside since place booked very large group  asked if comfortable area outside since still cold seating outside shade very windy day Blue Martini    We're told worry since we'd sheltered wind  outside asked sit only table located sun    As looking menu finally warm hostess comes back table asked move another table shade since apparently table sun going used big party  Which way yet seen    We decided leave  Very unhappy    We ended going Nu right downstairs seated patio right next very pretty warm fire pit  <EOR> A friend recommended tapas spot absolutely enjoyed apps except one    We ordered meatballs hamachi beef tenderloin calamari all great  also ordered Cevichi mushrooms but only fail things ordered cuz very citrusy bit sour sent back waitress recommended spicy tuna very good!

Hamachi ceviche those rookies me    this sashimi fish cooked citrus acid  never pickled hot peppers but its sweet hot tangy awesomeness  is obvious professional reviewer? Shrimp chicharran sauce crispy shrimp they use 3 flours little bit pop    Short ribs  large short rib guava glaze  Its probably best bbq sauce rich slightly tangy but smooth flavor  meat fall off bone tender    Piggy back dates  must have  dates wrapped bacon almond inside some pop then bed white mousse  Come on!  could eat coach all day   Best dish  must have  Mojitos admit didn't but 10 people mixed drinks variations mojito shocked people  sweet most    Lastly service perfect you'd expect timing each dish difficult    I want sit outside next time but packed wasn't possible but seem best view town square    Gun head I'd say didn't chicken skewers but turned missing rum glaze reason    I think loved most just variations every dish  Yes corn dogs but chorizo  Yes mac cheese but its habanero it  Piggy back dates almonds white mousse? picture taste like? There's something everyone here  Ceviche mac cheese shrimp pickled jalapenos bread pudding  joking place reminded dishes Nobu said friend just saying but might best meal ever felt trying find something didn't find mindblowing seem credible when told friends it  asking locals malls if been  wait Cana NYC open up  <EOR> Just received nice message Cana management just wanted take moment say thank taking time write review restaurant Caña   really appreciate hope see Caña again soon   Please introduce yourself may say hi   Regards Cory replied some request new additional drinks         Since Cana uses Rum Sugar Cane majority drinks why add some Polynesian drinks?
