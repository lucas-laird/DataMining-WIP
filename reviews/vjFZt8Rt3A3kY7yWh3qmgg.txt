Just some reasons better Palace Station which infamous long wait times   Its also very modern design it   Service very friendly cheery combination gumbo crab shrimp only omitted lobster its only small bits pieces rolled legs spice level 4 perfect good amount heat but still able taste flavor gumbo   good remember Palace Station but then again omitted stuff other time first time but still Very VERY good   came nice slice toasted buttery bread scoop rice   good but must getting older because couldn't finish whole thing   wonderful breakfast next morning!  Oyster bar Santa Fe Station Vs  Palace Station  Santa Fe Station Pros No or shorter lines during heavy hours More seats including tables More modern middle casino under 21 eat Cons Further strip open 24 7 Don't Étouffée other Oyster Bars offer individual steam pot front each seat for show but its still made individually its own pot cooks work station its just more efficient guy them all place move station station  so its pro efficiency con showmanship Despite having Étouffée coming now rather Palace Station   maybe try Texas Station which few $ cheaper but really casino modern feel Oyster bar  <EOR> Oh god  Im going die   I am stuffed mouth fire    combo pan roast 1 3 amateur level heat scale    I am wuss!

This time b f shared combo pan roast shrimp lobster crab since decided past forays Oyster Bar where each bowl much bulking season end sometime  Plus also shared bowl clam chowder Mel oysters Moscow Mule maybe bulk isn't over   Anyway pan roast just good Palace's even more lobster crab shrimp   clam chowder came pan roast because waitress forgot ordered but she very apologetic comped because oversight chowder great too   only disappointment bread serve since they're basically toasted hot dog buns bread rolls   definitely return Oyster Bar now pan roast fix  <EOR> This location same company PALACE STATION but food good  oyster bar palace station probably favorite restaurant Las Vegas but hate 1 2 hour wait while watching everyone else eat  idea oyster bar no line sounds amazing me  place located Sante Fe yes no line when came  more bar seating even few tables  First thing noticed chefs cook food front palace station there's barrier between people sitting bar seats stove  Food just did taste same  may biased because compared same food palace station but if you're same restaurant wouldn't food also taste same? Also service very slow  just did feel priority probably waited least 20 25 minutes just pay check  Overall place okay but rather wait line palace station some toast here  <EOR> The wait hit miss  If lucky no line seated seconds  hear Oyster bar palace station usually longest wait at least hour   My husband regulars tried everything menu  main cheff AL  He really loves he does  Last time which two days ago AL help another cheff but think AL puts touches food better   My favorite oyster would Stellar  love mussel steamers lemon garlic butter sauce umm! pan roast awesome  shrimp scampi could little more flavor  fish chip very good  Clam chowder best town  really enjoy meals here!
