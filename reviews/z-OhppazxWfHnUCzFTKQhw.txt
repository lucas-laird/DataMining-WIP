Lol jk Wide selection beverages that didnt look into small menu Bingsoo korean shaved ice dessert                                    Caramel Apple Bingoo $11 95 Homemade caramelized cinnamon apples fresh apples toasted pecans ice cream  Fresh Strawberry Bingsoo $10 95 Homemade marinated strawberries fresh strawberries strawberry ice cream  Sweet Mango Bingsoo $10 95 Mango chunks mango ice cream  Chocolate Brownie Bingsoo $10 95 Brownie chunks french cocoa powder chocolate swirl wafers coconut flakes chocolate ice cream  Roasted Soybean Bingsoo $9 95 Roasted soybean powder sweetened red bean sliced almonds rice cake vanilla ice cream  Redbean Bingsoo $8 95 Sweetened red bean petite rice cakes vanilla ice cream  Crunch Oreo Bingsoo $8 95 Oreo crumbs vanilla ice cream                                    Because recently came back trip Korea craving some korean bingsoo specifically Sulbing   korea Sulbing roasted soybean bingsoo traditional version   remember recongizing soybean powder korean drama series Heirs always wanted try it  Lol SHHH We picked roasted soybean bingsoo try  Apparently pick window but realized  workers brought table  Oops? XD Good service least? Lol   As mentioned previously shaved ice topped sweetened red bean sliced almonds rice cake roasted soybean powder VANILLA? ice cream  Reason why said VANILLA? because definitely traditional vanilla  Though couldn't really tell flavor slight brownish color  I'd almost call borderline soybean powder ice cream  Lol delicious least? Rice cake soft chewy  Sweetened red bean mushy but fairly firm bite which surprising nice  Oh also small pouring cup condensed milk which fun drizzle over everything  Hehe P Whats nice its just pile ice but small pile some powder then more ice  Attention detail right? Lol   Unfortunately unlike Sulbing korea shaved ice shaved milk  sad face  Overall still very tasty would love come try other ones! Mango strawberry looks delicious  Hopefully place last more known  Noticed hours doesnt open late  Might bad thing but if product good they'll still business hopefully   <EOR> We tried tiramisu snow white latte cinnamon which really great tasty  Moreover really athmosphere which relaxing stylish  Service great too  Definitely come back  Thank guys <EOR> I usually LA bingsoo fix but time happen Vegas area  place definitely does disappoint ! Loved ! Great service great ambiance fabulous dessert! <EOR> Love option build your own  Korea where first bingsu you're stuck w whatever each store serves  Today vanilla bean icecream Oreo fresh strawberries marshmallows  first cold treat year warm day  Try them you'll less calories    <EOR> This somewhat regular hangout spot church  cute little spot good variety drinks dessert  Usually tables push together larger table fairly large groups  sure they're usually busier night large group would probably ideal but could probably hang outside if anything  Most drinks desserts easily taken go   I've green tea snow mixed reviews it  first time matcha something extremely bitter no matter much condensed milk put still bitter  Bad first experience  But today again tasted way better! Much more subtle sweet all   I've also lychee iced tea which was    okay  overall consensus church people seems most drinks seem pretty good  think cold brew they're known but can't attest since never personally tried it  <EOR> Figured I'd grab dessert kids since already eating nearby restaurant 100+degrees    decor modern rustic just teeny tiny touch if Disney you'd miss if blinked but perfectly decorated    ordered Strawberry Dessert Chocolate Brownie Dessert   Both came table first thought serious? $15 ice fruit    But started eating 'snow' started melting creamy ice cream fresh fruit chocolate started merging simply delicious delightful experience! did someone even think that?   2 people easily share dessert plan coming back bringing people surprise!   didn't try any coffees menu but there's always next time  <EOR> I ambience cleanliness  Customer service great snow desserts came very fast  chocolate brownie snow very good  never such unique dessert enjoyed it  Overall great experience  <EOR> This place amazing! cafe itself set super cute nice lights decoration  cashier lady very friendly helpful  She told drinks desserts recommended which add ons get  taro milk teas Nutella milk tea sea salt caramel  All AMAZING!

The cold brew best cold brew any other place Vegas  opinion   Staff great genuinely friendly very professional  <EOR> I say interior decoration super cute relaxing  definitely cute place first date!   My friend ordered small strawberry ice lavender white latte share since both still full  Before ordering lavender White both curious see difference between lavender white latte lavender white mocha  asked person ringing however he couldn't tell difference because he pretty clueless himself  UM ? know your menu work there?  The ice arrived super fast however latte wrong  Instead lavender made vanilla latte but since weren't picky decided vanilla  worker said she could add lavender syrup coffee just option   The ice unflavored topping way sweet strawberry jam   However balanced nicely unflavored ice but much rather preferred actual strawberry flavored ice  Latte disappointing barely tasted lavender flavoring   Overall didn't high hopes place glad didn't else would disappointed  Perhaps come again if really want unflavored ice  <EOR> My friends came cafe some cold desserts hot afternoon  When first walked fell love design place! cute unique compared other boba shaved snow places to    I glad small shaved snow option $6 because all full lunch  small portion decent size  think would normally small portion  There's also large portion costs $10  If want customize your shaved snow order large    I ordered green tea while friends ordered tiramisu chocolate brownie  really liked red bean almond pieces green tea  actually really excited rice cake topping  think rice cake covered soy powder made rice cake really salty  jarring didn't mesh well dessert  shaved snow isn't really sweet rice cake salty comparison  shaved snow itself very light airy  actually resembles texture real snow   I prefer shaved ice creamier similar ice cream sweeter condense milk? which less likely come here  otherhand if your dessert less sweet airy Snow White place my friends reaaaaalIy liked place   <EOR> This place amazing come very often whole family   daughter first find when she brought fell inlove consistency snow tiramisu boba! <EOR> 1st time ordered small snow cake mango grapefruit  under impression snow cake just snow cone but water based more shaved cream  delightful  known cream based would gone different topping however still quite delicious  place great especially hot summer triple digit weather kind day  <EOR> It's magical  want wow factor  You'll find here  Amazing  Definitely must visit over top dessert  <EOR> The Goods 1  Korean style shave ice milk!  many choices all good!  2  Also does soda coffee iced coffee  Service  1  Friendly smiley love it 2  CC cash ok 3  Parking packed but during peak times   Ambiance  1  Cute esp bathroom might wanna check out 2  Feels little dwarf dwelling little figurines feels cozy   MoJo 1  tiramisu matcha azuki!!   2  catch friends <EOR> I snow mango side condensed milk   Let say condensed milk runny meaning probably watered down   If you're cheap enough means quality means nothing you  service okay nothing spectacular  snow mango okay  $7 wasn't great portion tasted shaved ice bit cream bits mangoes top  mangoes ripe good wish richer sweeter  friend ordered drink wrong didn't taste great either   think presentation you're paying flavor lacks had  <EOR> In world shave ice Snow White Cafe takes unique twist  ice shaved more fine then 808 style grew life  only way cut ice but presentation truly artwork  only eye appeal details the  bowl serve ice chilled chilled bowl served tray sauce pour over top kind scared break all down  just food really interior whole snow white concept going mirror vibe place very laid back very chill spot    It first time but thankfully came Suzy H first time  explained way all works  size large bowl might look lot recommended two  really could eat whole thing  only ice  Lol  green tea ice cream top!! Unreal good!  could whole bowl it  Then add shave ice then topped some adzuki beans reminded pounding mochi new years filled some adzuki beans  Onolicous!!! mochi rectangle pieces around top perfect compliment  If fan all things green tea bowl brings best color green green more green  really look forward trying more shaved ice    I also notice Lychee smoothie menu  Different never smoothie flavor  impressed  nice strong fresh lychee flavor nice blended slushy smoothie over sweet  also serve coffee pastries refrigeration section drinks  If looking place small quiet chill environment great shave ice looking relax coffee great book great conversations friends  Snow White Cafe great spot!*!*!* <EOR> The mango shaved ice probably best found Las Vegas  Since ice monster Taiwan didn't think any ice dessert would come closed it  But say place did  try strawberry  brownies ice  Both good but favorite mango  last 4 time running green tea ice looking forward try out!!! Highly recommended <EOR> The decor clean rustic  restrooms clean very impressive  only Snow White theme store name drinks  wasn't impressed drinks because all ice barely any beverage cup  worth price  only 1 staff member working night wasn't busy weekend but overall friendly staff  <EOR> Came Sunday afternoon family 4 total wasn't busy all  inside really clean cutely decorated Snow White themed paintings mirrors all throughout store even bathroom! We couple large bingsoos $9 95 each standard mango other custom asked for! custom choice sauce 3 toppings cereal toppings scoop ice cream! mango sauce mangos strawberries red bean fruit pebbles vanilla ice cream DELICIOUS! fruity pebbles  add nice crunch might little overpowering other flavors times but don't throw much all good  Each bingsoo comes little side condensed milk don't worry if don't see menu some!   Also ps no longer green tea available ice only plain flavor now! <EOR> We strawberry shaved ice kids loved it   myself fan sweets all much however took tastes tasted good   overpowering sweet  <EOR> Was looking light refreshing dessert Snow White right next restaurant dinner at  cute spacious inside shop    The girl helped wasn't actually listening questions looking phone while looked menu  asked she thought tiramisu flavor she instead list most popular toppings  What? happened again when asked whether face picture order free tea offering Yelp review  didn't even bother doing because never straight answer  Something check ID? case why need face Yelp review? Idk    We large snow strawberries mangoes vanilla ice cream  came side condensed milk  felt though $10 pretty pricey just fruits syrup snow ice cream scoop  fruits sour side mangoes being chewy not ripe rather soft  told small size doesn't come ice cream but could add $2  Again really pricey imo single scoop ice cream if decide small since small $6 ice cream $8 might well buy large anyway    Presentation nice but honestly wouldn't way come here  Snow just meh Stumptown coffee Whole Foods  <EOR> EDIT almost immediately posting owners addressed issue offered free drink try compensate  tried matcha latte little less sweet  said little difficult alter sweetness due powder being already pre sweetened but would try making little less powder   The second drink bad lot better original still slightly little sweet but much better  They said would note previous mentions first review  Although sweetness still little more usually prefer service addressing issue lot   Service 80% business success imo readdress very much appreciated gave change heart   They also gave free ice cream well really shows care business satisfaction customers   **********************  You taste heart drink heart less Kanye west paparazzi   I mint mojito favorite mine but just felt extremely disappointed  First things first really dislike when people give 3 4 ice coffee drink  Number dilutes drink number two just plain cheap   The mint mojito Snow White just mint pieces tossed ice plain watered down coffee  The premature coffee beans made brew taste super sour when wanted earthy fruity sweet minty freshness  mint practically absent chopped into large pieces   If muddled mint more instead quickly few careless chops mint flavor would more present complimentary  Also please please use coffee beans aren't prematurely picked!!! can't stand sour coffee unbearably sour coffee  handle lemons but just plain depressing   Also maybe little cream half half anything would nice even if could just put over counter could pour self serve style would nice  only option available though 4 options sugar  didn't even see napkins side counter felt waste space   The only redeeming quality though clean tastefully themed Alice wonder land theme +1 star  I may considering changing review if find redeeming drink but second time item disappointed me   I just don't ever see myself saying hey let's Snow White guys! Which presents 2 star rating  Also lately would nice warm welcome cafe  weren't rude but more like   should say?   uninterested   No hello  welcome   just want order? Uhh okay straight point guess  But still also made want ask any recommendations fear suggestion might cold greeting  Maybe next time come again see if they've improved any change review but now  2 5 me  Aka big fat MEHHHHHHHH <EOR> Perfect dessert spot   Shaved ice light fluffy   Decor cute interior spacious large groups   Large selection also plus  <EOR> Snow White decently priced definitely tasty!!! tried Oreo shaved ice enough fill 3 us  Plus workers incredibly friendly  <EOR> First time big disappointment  Silverware dirty asked another spoon politely she threw attitude  Desserts weren't all great drinks watery  Customer service horrible  DEFINITELY WORTH HYPE  <EOR> BEST snowflakes store VEGAS ever!!! The owner super attentive friendly Green Tea she recommended amazing!!! try! LOVE IT! <EOR> The inside little cafe really well done  tile floor great tables chairs plentiful windows let lot light  serve Stumptown Coffee but shaved ice real star show here  Unlike most other shaved ice places Snow White uses plain ice uses all toppings sweeten up  Most places flavored ice experience but all toppings  brownie sundae dish really enjoyed it  shaved ice drizzled sweetened condensed milk dusted cocoa powder then topped brownie pieces cookies  milk cocoa powder made shaved ice taste just chocolate ice cream  brownies tasted fresh cookies added good crunch  very happy  don't think spoke until finished just kept eating  If shaved ice should definitely try spot out  They're doing some creative different things here  <EOR> this place cutest! theme place just grand! snow fav  also boba great too! recommend <EOR> Top kek place  Great tea coffee well signature shaved ice stuff  come often dinner  Its conveniently located Chinatown near lots nice places <EOR> The snow cakes perfect dessert if you're ever mood something sweet  snow cakes fluffy texture between shaved ice shaved snow  soft melts your mouth  sweet add your own toppings such fruit syrup fruits cereal  also add scoop ice cream if decide order large size   The prices bit more expensive Snowflake  small snow cake costs $5 95 large costs $9 95  price large size Snowflake  only difference shaved snow Snowflake Snow White Cafe bingsu Korean shaved ice condensed milk mixed in   slight difference between two but always add condensed milk your shaved snow topping essentially same thing   Parking difficult especially if you're coming peak hours because located same plaza District karaoke bar    The comments all deactivated off yelp page now because offering rewards guests wrote them five star review  Honestly many other businesses done same Las Vegas but haven't reported  don't know when they'll back again but sure reputation harmed because this  <EOR> Honestly impressed drinks here  Tried two drinks    Jasmine green tea Coffee Float espresso ice cream  Jasmine green tea lacked flavor didn't taste any hint jasmine  super excited try coffee float but such disappointment  Paid $8 4 oz drink    Took two sips decided wasn't cup tea  Would probably return try dessert menu but definitely no more drinks me! <EOR> 10 10 recommend place!
