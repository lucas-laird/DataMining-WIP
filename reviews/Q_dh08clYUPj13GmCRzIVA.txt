They really new don't want say never back but if hope better  definitely potential    Oh time finishing meal place became packed  <EOR> Yet another Filipino restaurant prolly business lacks consistency   day everything delicious many options choose some days very unfamiliar dishes worst portion control   Why chicken pork adobo everyday?  chicken Tinola choices contained mostly chicken parts skin bone cartilage mind lady took time filling serving container appeared selective   Why can't just take big scoop place bowl  <EOR> This place simply ok  first question owner bankrupt turn ac place? Some middle desert no humidity manage create somewhat amazonian environment inside    hot humid hell  Compared other Filipino places town place for us done type place  Doubt if we'll ever back  called street food mediocre best  Try don't try no difference anyway  <EOR> Best filipino food restaurant Las Vegas! wide variety filipino foods street foods silog serve all day!
