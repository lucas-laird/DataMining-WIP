Fast service! But dear lord don't eat chicken wings r over crusted  although r thoroughly cooked almost rubbery u can't chew them all  Sadly won't back food ate today just right through ! <EOR> The phone number listed Yelp page official website Meadows Mall location fact used fax machine  good luck trying reach live person over phone see time close  I check business hour Meadows Mall day avoid arriving mall already locked day  But far guest experience location compared other Las Vegas Johnny Rockets locations tried thus far light years better   Maybe way particular location setup counters sit orders taken right instead walk counter all other fast food restaurants where place your order come back later pick your order  course if placing order cash register ideally spot head initiate transaction   if choice between various locations throughout LV location much further away then all means come here!  Even though read somewhere menu limited believe case based remember seeing burger menu vs full burger menu found official website still usually just Smoke House Single Double Hershey's® Chocolate Malt   limited menu want still available thus made no difference whatsoever   order came quickly only able distract myself Clash Clans Snapchat minute   On most recent visit during Christmas shopping period mall bustling only handful open seats JR counter   place busy   But young man took order point entire crew handled holiday rush badasses   The price point only downer JR   Which main reason don't stop half often number times shop Meadows Mall   Groupon promotions good but might well share some marketing dollars Groupon receives lower price all customers   Anyway  Decent burgers good shakes malts efficient friendly crew Johnny Rockets   would come back future  Just sure soon would be  <EOR>
