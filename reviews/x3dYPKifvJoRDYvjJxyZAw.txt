When squeeze into same window customers ordering when attempting pick burger problem  Also seemed person 'shouting' order numbers couldn't muster enthusiasm actually call numbers loud enough customers hear which caused some confusion   And top things off put down asking napkins  Apparently s'posed know napkins fartherst corner food court  Shame knowing  deserved condescending attitude treated moron    Never again  <EOR> This McDonalds freaking life saver when girlfriend arrived checked in Luxor 1 AM!  Service night suuuper slow    sure if its all drunk people ordering made slow understaffed but 10 minute wait seemed 30    Came back 8 hours later breakfast swear everything changed order literally done within 20 seconds actually placing order!

The ordering line moves relatively fast  Then wait short handed staff take sweet time making your food incorrectly like bacon quarter pounder no freaking bacon! only ready five people behind already food  Then pick soda filled time your order  Warm flat iced down soda just well every meal doesn't it?  Everyone waiting looked super frustrated  really need beef night team    no joke  know most clientele time night stumbling drunks but still paying customers probably MOST eager food run back hotels  Better service deserved!   Unfortunately guy passed table while waiting food probably never even meal  He only leave memories waking random food court  Tears   Ronald real together over here! <EOR> It is   busiest food joint food court   Can't really say much besides quick getting food   Everything whatevers  <EOR> After 2am wait horrible!
