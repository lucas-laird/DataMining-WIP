As sushi only tried some rolls but considering labeled house specialty expected decent  Nothing special better off strip mall  Keep mind only rolls few pieces fish present good  example I  Philly offering cream cheese should additional component add texture main element compensate lack anything else   Considering price location expect smaller portions least above minimum quality   am picky but just disappointed enough feel should leave review   On second thought sleeping deserve 2 stars  <EOR> Way over priced     Good food but really $19 rainbow roll small all eat?!?!?! Won't back      Rather take  trip Tropicana Sushi       <EOR> Wow such disappointing dinner  Completely trash place  Mirage needs look into restaurant because damn they're waste space such wonderful casino  course place beautiful inside drinks good but anyone that  Now food honestly say disgusting  don't say word much all but literally gross  Embarrassing Japanese sushi well  rolls sad cut into 6 huge pieces which just enjoyable all  huge full rice! just California phile roll ordered can't even imagine others  Now onto main course which ordered seafood soup chicken rice bowl  First off rice just almost rotten flavors it  rice taste bad? But cook flavor knows but just right  chicken battered burnt crisp  top off huge bone sticks side chicken piece which just classy because once cooked all nasty redness turns into black mushy around bone piece  Seafood soup just okay broth bland put few pieces seafood gone literally three bites  appetizer calamari only dish actually good  batter perfect cooked perfect flavors added sauce plate great  believe wasabi type sauce  brushed side plate compliment calamari  BUT course there's but portion small tiny couldn't help but count many strands calamari plate which turned 13 tiny little pieces calamari  table four plate gone within 1 minute  bill turned $176 00 just those items  would perfectly fine if food great expected strip inside great hotel Mirage  highly recommend really hope some changes because picky eater all  But food rice bowl didn't even finish made mouth water bad way almost wanting throw up  Sorry say but truth hurts pay such sad dishes  <EOR>
