They'll rip off! I tried order 3 items off menu delivery  delivery charge tax order should come no more $19 25  person phone immediately stated order would $22 01  ?? $22 01 said?  wrong  He seemed annoyed  then quoted individual prices items ordered he said Well delivery charge $2    then asked why delivery charge flyer send says delivery $1? Oh ok he says  He then quotes price $21 01  ?? Where prices coming from? quote prices flyer again items ordered he then says Ok well $20 !! even adding stuff up? If why constantly going down price? BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING RIP OFF ORIGINALLY WHEN QUOTED YOUR FIRST INFLATED PRICE!! finally just tell forget order hang up  think your customers stupid? really scandalous practice attempting overcharge your customers  beyond simple mistake  pure greed  NEVER order them again <EOR> Singapore rice noodles delicious! Haven't dish good since dads cooking!  Will come back <EOR> I've never here  review based experience ordering delivery through Yelp Eat24  said pics posted looks typical can't throw a dead cat strip mall Chinese place  menu standard typical beige   BUT  Everything ordered cooked fresh seasoned perfectly none those gunky gooey sauces usually associates strip mall Chinese places  tentative judgement among Chinese delivery restaurants available Eat24 comes first! cost very reasonable portions generous   Out all ordered think enjoyed wonton soup most  wontons light chewy filling perfectly proportioned heavy all  But broth lovely clear golden broth fragranced rather flavored  Really delight!  I enjoyed lo mein well  reason chose restaurant tonight  fan if chow mein chow fun reason another Happy Wok only place could find it  lo mein touch greasy but annoyingly while didn't reek garlic came through very nicely  tad short chicken perhaps   Chicken snow peas mixed vegetables chicken fried rice also buffet table all executed skill  usually find fried rice bland add ton soy but wasn't case okay added touch but whole package  chicken white meat generous chunks tender dry  snow peas still al dente very nice assortment veggies mixed   I'm sure better more authentic Chinese food found many establishments line Spring Mountain Ave some really good but pricey Chinese food Strip but delivery heartily recommend Happy Wok!   Oh China just call food! <EOR> The food decent but customer service abysmal best  Just lunch guy rang when ordered comes knocks car window saying didn't pay meal  told him he rang he said no he did lady took order table need come back pay  another exchange same thing being accused dining dashing showed receipt pocket  He yours? he refused accept telling truth  No dumb dumb found ground put pocket  Oh way thanks calling liar accusing stealing  never give place another cent hope no else does either <EOR> thank order 15 minutes ago food table all sauce food hot wow love back Chinese delivery Las Vegas thank Happy WoK # 7023682888 <EOR> I just walked really hungry son's school down street  ambience very fast food like  egg drop soup tasted cardboard chow mein blander used but garlic pork good  <EOR>
