I definitely back check place further detail    Enjoy <EOR> The Ft  Apache location Thai Style Noodle House may sister Chinatown original but hail different mother   To sure food almost good more popular sibling but no surprise assuming recipes passed along birth  But  where similarities end western valley reproduction well loved Chinatown eatery which sad news those live western valley    In review original bemoaned absence accommodating server could provide suggestions crave when maiden voyage  fair assume language barrier played significant role but server did excellent job everything else Yelp help suggestion portion   The same could said Ft  Apache location  only no perceivable language barrier but only customer during lunch rush server presented ample opportunity showcase skills  where he failed monumentally   It's hard describe feeling invisibility especially if reader never experienced such loneliness felt overwhelming desire Huckleberry Finn fence post  especially difficult imagine being ignored when only customer place  Suffice say nearly cry anguish EVERY time needed anything placing order requesting refill procuring check   Not only did server care presence establishment he seemed perturbed rare interaction he did me  add insult massive injury response credit card and quote Don't cash? picture Paris Hilton discovering rental choices did include pink Cadillac Escalade  I half expected bill arrive some minimum $25 charge some restaurants wont threaten little placards next register    I delighted see server only charged card exact amount bill sadly highlight visit  <EOR> 3 stars food minus 1 service equals 2   Called explanation menu but guy other end busy explain  Asked different curries but instead he rattles off colors  could sense impatience he voice  Already ordered fried rice very tempted cancel but since sons kept it   When place empty except 1 table why couldn't he explain some menu me? He said MAYBE he couldn't hear me  told simple solution turn down music dah!!!! There other Thai restaurants area  Don't need put kind service especially since giving them business  <EOR> It seems owners Thai Style noodle house compete other Thai restaurants  location Chinatown surrounded Thai places Fort Apache theres abundant amount Thai places  don't think TSNH knock other restaurants its competing against but its cheap   The value items order great bang buck large variety noodles  Although always weirds when see Thai restaurant sell won ton noodles    Sometimes wait time bit long I see elderly thai lady working kitchen which good bad thing   If come party would probably skip chef specials because they're good but because you'll probably waiting another 10 minutes while your friends grubbing    Oh yeah find little weird all drinking glasses same color  think its little weird when 7 waters 3 clear glasses while other 4 red   The service nice though never really problem any orders   THE SUMMARY cheap variety long wait weird cups decent service  <EOR> My go to Thai pick place!
