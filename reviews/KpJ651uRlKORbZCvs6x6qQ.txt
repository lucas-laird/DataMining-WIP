The Tropicana done itself! Nikki Beach Day Night Club  beautiful white oasis! came  Day Club   nice vibe DJ tapped into very well   beers $8 each $30 quesedilla prepared sticker shock   good news delicious large enough portioned sharable  pool small but way kewel since forced more social  staff beautiful remembered hire hot guys too! August 7th bartender friendly attentive serving drinks freshest ingredients!  crowd sexy eclectic diverse mix ethnic age social backgrounds   hope stays way  <EOR> Best place some good ole' fun!! recommend anyone visiting Vegas   Ant Tropicana looking good boot! <EOR> Not impressed  chicken satay 2 recommendations servers   it bland tasted mostly peanut butter  portion small finished few minutes  didn't think worth free meal  couldn't imagine paying full price $22 being happy! <EOR> The pool really small  really no fun Beach Club  Besides pool whole setup cluttered put together look intimate  White sure color sun but overall MEH The food very average drinks    servers very friendly service over all great  <EOR> So day before friend decided hit Nikki Beach texted host contact mine guestlist  Score! Since going Thursday industry day he hooked daybed  walked into Trop immediately confused turned around everything looks much shinier newer ended Cafe ask directions  Security decided escort over indoor entrance so wouldn't outside just yet which further back pool gift shop  several hosts around all whom very friendly  them checked reservation confirmed comped no F B minimum  Yay! hour half past opening place pretty crowded  glad daybed because those closest areas water if don't daybed cabana you're pretty much sitting low walls surround area  server very friendly but service little slow since many people around  thing friend noticed actual pool depth  majority water MUCH deeper lot other over 21 pools  most part everyone pretty chill friendly crowd definitely different usual fist pumping group they present course but more variety   pool bit small but definitely cleaner looking Bare Tao Beach  whole area bit smaller well but did much more intimate hidden space which really liked  Overall great experience back! <EOR> Best dayclub experience ever!!  Okay 110 degrees but  Nikki Beach's fault taking away any stars account that    I previously written off Vegas pool parties festering puddles STD magnets  Nikki Beach keeps relatively classy though term used loosely pool party Vegas afterall but brought experience over top high quality staff drinks decor great diversity people    I've never experienced such accommodating level service Vegas club  cute security guys entrance awesome bodyguard moved freaking heavy umbrella whenever sun moved lovely girl taking drink orders everyone some serious A++ training customer service Nikki Beach! Yeah sure reserved daybed some cocktail pitchers but treated more royalty  awesome know folks Nikki Beach view all levels patrons highest regard    Our group girls ordered pitchers rasberry white sangria strawberry mojito  drinks refreshingly bomb mostly because fruit ingredients actually FRESH! particularly strong but didn't want something high alcohol content anyway since hot would've just zapped any all hydration right me    The pool area okay know  supposed biggest draw pool party but small crowded water really warm  better low key time upper tiered day bed near bar misters  But if you're into wilder pool party thing small pool full beautiful people probably your ticket   Lastly big kudos Nikki Beach attracting such diverse crowd  Love place where see all different types faces having fun together = <EOR> This place kiss ass  Don't try sit down million empty tables  try kick out  Order glass water  $7  really? $10 drinks? Eat it   avoid all costs <EOR> This place awesome  VIP bed treated kings  Thank Michael Sin hooking up! Lots highly attractive folks hot weather cool pool amazing DJ  <EOR> Club Nikki! Surprisingly nice club! would thought Tropicana fun night? sure didn't!   I didn't witness angels descending ceiling serving drinks but see place could rockin' if more people discover it  guy drums really nice touch  Every club should drummer controlling bass! club really small but lot potential  Britney Spears supposed party weekend  just barely missed her! <EOR> Nice pool club  Decor nice  Pool's bit small  during day Friday crowd pretty mellow jersey shore some other places  food good but thought little bit overpriced  Drinks however quite cheap Vegas standards beer cheaper water   Chad Noyes took care girlfriend great deal daybed  definitely would return here  <EOR> The day before attended pool party Hard Rock let say set bar pool parties Vegas    Here story its just story but left bad enough taste mouth leave review   We show 11 45am pool opens noon  15 20 people waiting  saturday   Line forms nice enough staff point  Free admission no problems  slew 10 12 bouncers now text messaging crazy entire time waiting which if you've Vegas just obnoxious but its part job   My wife stopped front conversation takes place   Bouncer smile please? My wife laughing Really?  Bouncer isn't first time checked ID miss sternly I laugh hand ID continue pool   rest party follows   The club area walked through looks pretty cool nice decor etc  No complaints this   First thing notice pool size nice health club hot tub  its stadium seating day beds  If want lay suppose pretty good but advertised pool big pool party    We nab menu figure should order some buckets beer    Nope but $70 buckets some fruity drink     And walked  end looked potential but setup compared hard rock EXTREMELY weak  highly suggest check more popular pool scenes Vegas  <EOR> We girl Sun 7 17 great time pool!

This first Vegas pool party experience  Thursday pretty early 12 30 kind dead  some list both free but am pretty sure everyone free  mentioned daybeds just spend $50 but boyfriend doesn't really drink wasn't sure if would worth it  Since pretty empty found place put stuff fine   The pool TINY   size pool apartment  actual place pretty big rows daybeds didn't fill but assume may because Thursday just doesn't busy here  Drinks average Vegas prices  chilled pool few hours  crowd fun   very mixed! DJ good  both played hip hop all day   Fun atmosphere beach balls people just hanging out  Since pool small felt easy talk people friends  Encore beach its big spaced totally that  great time but def want check rest pools before season over! <EOR> Came last month private event invited to   can't comment advertised pool parties see some reviewers complaining but nightclub place during day drink chill mingle place awesome   fact party special menu made especially really sweetened experience   space gorgeous   cabanas day beds tipi structures different tiers leading down pool people watching great    pool definitely smaller side but really gets water anyway?  advice if want Nikki Beach during day social scene swimming   If really want swim back hotel you're staying because know no going Nikki Beach staying Tropicana anyway   staff super friendly accommodating   Can't wait back! <EOR> Okay    when cross $500 table bottle service Michael Jackson impersonator half naked transsexual dressed very convincing more disturbing Joker ala Heath Ledger?
