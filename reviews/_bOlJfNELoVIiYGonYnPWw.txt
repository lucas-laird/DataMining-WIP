They offer All Eat AYCE sushi both lunch dinner  personally haven't done AYCE but ordered countless times  tried almost all sushi menu always turns yummy fresh  Prices seem same range other AYCE restaurants well   It's go to sushi place but great joint when you're craving something quick you're area  Plus far where live wouldn't travel all way restaurant compared other authentic Japanese sushi houses   Staff very personable when comes customer service which may come off being unfriendly some  But doesn't really bother since only food when area visiting friends   It's great place try when you're looking formality eatery when just need feed your tummy good food  lol  *Since Aloha Sushi House establishment but known two different names written same review both check ins* <EOR> This place right down st me! always China right next door figured I'd give try  immediately seated didn't wait long that  Once made order took waitress 15 minutes appetizers seaweed salad kept bringing wrong orders 30 minutes into being seat finally brought 1  ONE correct roll! waitresses waiters kept going back forth restaurant another place particular owns 3 different restaurants right next each other! All orders coming tables seemed wrong  very disorganized no seemed going on  45 minutes only 2 rolls brought table  eventually couldn't wait any longer decided leave   The only reason why might give them second chance because owner apologized only charged 10 dollars some drinks rolls ordered let take them go  But definitely need more help organization before give them another chance  <EOR> The food decent lot extra salad needed service great but least time  asked poke recieved squid  must tries supreme salmon extasy rolls along superwhite tuna garlic salmon niguri  21$ steep price lunch  <EOR> For now rate them 4 stars   place just need come name   all conjunction China Aloha Sushi House   Just stick name!  I knew spot where served Island food some sushi rolls now they've expanded Chinese All Eat Sushi Boba which good Eastside     I skimmed through Sushi menu Lisa Lisa roll caught eye ordered Seafood Combo Mahi Mahi Fried Shrimp came Meat choice Short Ribs    Lisa Lisa Roll common most sushi joints never really care but place think won over crunch top   Something it   packed tight top roll like     packed snow   fluffy ice!   made different other sushi place fluffiness flakes   taste good   Plus ingredients roll look well proportioned   As fish shrimp short ribs okay   Wasn't fan shrimp fried because biting into super crunchy   Let's compare Panda Express crunchy batter around but tender bite shrimp  here   More crunchy over cooked shrimp   short ribs Mahi Mahi just ok me   Mac Salad wasn't impressed with   little runny liking   As waited order quickly skimmed through all eat sushi menu which looked decent enough give try   AYCE menu decent price which think matches serve      So being said Happy Eatings until next time! <EOR> The food ok price  guest service horrible walked placing food order ignored while talked register even though literally 3 inches away place tiny   asked eel sauce spicy mayo charged dollar each wouldn't mind paying if actually would gave good side instead gave happy full little container which told them nvm paying dollar each when other places give free more amount  waiting order finally reviving wanted check before leaving girl said all umm ok still want check hello  sign empty should given big clue its bad service but decided try anyway  Learned lesson returning  <EOR> I came thinking a sushi house east side must taste crap    wasn't bad thought would be    But still pretty bad  Some rolls good but most okay  MOCHI  gross   love mochi! But couldn't force myself eat it  came little plastics fortune cookie    Since china Agogo sushi house aloha Agogo all connected servers confused lot  Servers trying though! <EOR> I love order sushi always delicious never forget put chopsticks soy sauce ginger bags me  However when walk door no greet you    standing around five ten minutes forced yell assistance cooks   who ignore then magically someone doesn't work kitchen pops take your order  If customer service better would 5 stars <EOR> This place awesome! food great yum yum sushi! give sushi 9 10 its very good! greet when walk in  highly Recommend Pastel sushi roll  service good but its understandable recently opened waiters starting know role become better serving  give them props trying  recommend place  <EOR> Had All Eat Sushi Lunch $19 95  wonderful  They even allow order 1 2 rolls more variety   They best seaweed salad Vegas   Simon server  He friendly no problem explaining  things us   BTW lunch dinner all eat also gives appetizers others items pick other just sushi   Lunch All Eat $19 95 60 minutes  Dinner All Eat $23 95 90 minutes   No sharing  But why would want to Remember order 1 2 rolls sample different things   They charge extra uneaten food  order think you'll eat less then place second third even fourth order   Will certainly back  <EOR> So glad place opened up! nice sushi place 3 minute drive home! We're major sushi seekers would sushi every day if could  2nd  favorite sushi place city  quiet intimate very modern Japanese decor  AYCE good price don't pressure eat fast actually showed 2 hours before closing expecting them rush but really relaxed  Everything very fresh some pretty unique rolls  Really only reason giving 4 because they're open late enough  used sushi places stay open until 2 AM  If chance try yellow tail nigiri MUCH FLAVOR! <EOR> This place great  Decent prices very good food actually! sushi combo salmon specials good!
