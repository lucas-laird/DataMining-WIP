Because love place but last night service bad give 2 Stars   The Better Half enjoy going places offer flights wine   enjoy sampling different vineyards without cost paying full glass wine   Grape Street place this   Normally dine table enjoy full meal flights   However last night decided bar because didn't plan eat   mistake   The bartender's service horrible   own menus   each ordered flight Zinfandels glasses water   Once she poured flights wine she didn't bother tell anything wine   Normally tell which glass contains which wine give brief description taste flavors   She more concerned guy sitting bar   Keep mind only 5 people bar including Wife when arrived   Within 20 minutes only 3 remaining bar     she spent all time chatting other customer   Meanwhile glasses water sat empty   I finished flight before Better Half finished hers     that's always case   interested having another glass considering Cabs    however she nowhere found   bar left unattended knows where she went   Finally she appeared food other customer   waited until she delivered order then flagged down    she says Just second      then she bolts bar     what ??  watched she walked around restaurant she came back empty handed     what freaking important couldn't take drink order customer bar?    When she finally came over asked if could sample Cabs before made decision      she said sure poured small sample Cab requested   Then she walked away something else back     didn't she want know if wanted order full glass?  Come on!  time Better Half said screw this     let's glass wine somewhere else where served   A server restaurant came bar looked over could see irritated    asked if needed anything said Check Please   She back found bartender    who came over said Didn't want another glass wine?       ha tonight your crappy service   paid check way another place   I didn't bartender's name but she dirty blond curly hair     I remember she because when come back sure avoid bar if she's working   This place use much better this   don't know what's going on   Will return?
