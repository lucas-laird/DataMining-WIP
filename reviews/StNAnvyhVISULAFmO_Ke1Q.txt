  against? insane! know everyone own opinions including but 70+ burger places eaten town I'd say 95% them better this  hell voted? other places against? Come on!  The restaurant interior typical strip mall fare griddle deep fryers right open  menu features hot dogs sausages burgers sandwiches fish   you name it  key words menu are frozen premade generic Boar's Head  Think generic pre packed sausages dogs frozen patties frozen fries    Sitting counter griddle witnessed them pulling sausages Boar's Head packages frozen patties thrown right griddle generic frozen crinkle cut fries dumped right plain grocery store bags into measuring bowl into fryer  While sitting near griddle only 'fresh' items noticed pre cut veggies pulling fridge throw griddle   My frozen burger patty dropped right grill overcooked everything else there  meat very generic flavorful definitely winner any 'best of' contest think of  huge piece tough thick lettuce burger small amount mushrooms could barely taste well melted swiss cheese couple thin tomato slices  bun grilled well but extremely plain non existent  Nothing burger stood other fact could find any backyard bbq overpriced crappy food stand any sports event   The thin overcooked generic fries exactly that  can't stress ridiculously typical meal was would give fairly negative review just all but combine 'best burger' claim infuriates me  top off meal came $13 26 which equal more plenty other fantastic burgers eaten all around town definitely worthy some best burger claims many categories  can't recommend paying eat anything because could purchase pretty much same ingredients any grocery store your backyard  Argh  <EOR> This place super close house coming years  If your looking yummy comfort food then eat here! staff super friendly always recognize when come in! always sit bar watching food cooked!

We'll come long guys here!!! <EOR> Wanted try place seeing all favorable reviews Yelp  thinking Chicago dog would pretty awesome took daughter lunch give shot  ordered kid's meal hot dog crinkle cut fries draft root beer  the tap handle says Death Valley Root Beer which phenomenal concoction but server told actually Chicago Brewing Company Root Beer serving head's if matters you ordered Chi dog ala carte because always pick kids' food anyway  yah roll that!  Her hot dog did snap mine did obviously different hot dog kid's versus adult's no big deal  assuming kosher dog which menu denoted having no snap  best Sherlock Holmes deduction       anyway          The crinkle cut fries crisp served hot salted all  Which fine everyone different sodium needs don't think fries should come doused salt takes 2 seconds salt taste    The Chicago dog stupendous! poppy seed roll those little peppers bright green relish giant slab dill pickle across top great! kid's hot dog meh wasn't anything write home but edible nonetheless   The root beer delicious serve no ice know serve draft root beer  creamy just enough bite isn't overly sweet    And just note previous reviewer mentioning saw chef using Boar's Head meats  WOW really Sherlock aren't considering Boar's Head Served signs entrance all over inside restaurant great powers deduction really quite impressive! LOL  I would give place 5 stars if could just walk counter order your hot dog sit down eat but must served instead  say server very polite attentive personable isn't issue all  just hot dog joint should cheaper quicker side eating when being served those attributes aren't really going attainable unfortunately  know take order but sometimes I'd rather eat car especially something messy Chicago Dog    Try too! <EOR> I've gone twice both times very satisfied! First time order chili dog cheese jalapeños delicious  Second time order cheese burger bacon amazing  write review because both times food 10  would recommend great links anyone  Also both times  restaurant nice clean felt very comfortable dining in  <EOR> When looking inexpensive calorie filled food place stop  chili cheese hotdog wife tasty  mushroom swiss burger well cooked huge amount mushrooms almost much cheese  French fries good tater tots which don't normally enjoy perfectly crispy actually hard put down  chocolate milkshake large just right thickness nice amount whip cream  <EOR> Great Links haven vegetarian junk food lovers Northwest side town   Let tell offer vegetarians vegetarian hot dogs vegetarian chicken vegetarian Italian sausage vegetarian kielbasa vegetarian beer brats vegetarian bacon vegetarian chili!!!

Place clean service  Met Guy owner chatted bit   Nice person known years  bringing family lunch dinner soon  <EOR> My kids grab some take just couple days ago  The pro's The Italian fries tasty  Parmigian garlic bit oil  The chili cheeseburger good    but here's thing  The con's shortly arrived placed order manager owner well within earshot telling    yelling former? employees he f'ing fired!   Extremely loud  other employees seemed bit shaken maybe explains quality food  The chili cheese dog ok  seemed under cooked  Again maybe  situation   Definitely willing give place another chance seeing favorably place reviewed     <EOR> I know place keeps winning awards burgers keep meaning try but always end getting hot dog favorite toppings bacon cheese grilled onions because delicious   use good quality products little tricks putting lid finished dog steam softens bun all toppings melt together into gooey deliciousness   Prices reasonable more variety menu then ever around trying     Also people could nicer owner manager way sure happy food could be?  Best hot dog Vegas Baby! <EOR> Was really excited going here  close house enjoy hot dogs  took cashier couple minutes come over just ask if where ready  She seemed annoyed  told first time we'd look over menu first  When where ready she took order Chicago dog Louisiana link cheese fries house salad  $20 all  Seemed pricey me  where asked if wanted eat here  really would loved to  But overwhelmingly hot there  felt sauna  know today probably hottest days Vegas 114 6 7 13 but when want inside summer day outside shouldn't hotter  took food home  Chicago dog tasted good soggy all juice toppings where Just added it  hot dog tasted good them seem good product only problem restaurant hotter dog  Louisiana link good  Spicy! No complains there  cheese fries would suggest getting  where soggy  almost seemed cheap frozen fries grocery store microwaved drowned cheese  where only able eat half because other half wasn't even removable paper wrap container  Salad couldn't tell because didn't include dressing  experience didn't really feel going back  don't know if would received better food if ate not  weren't pleased  Won't goon back  We'd rather weinersnitchel  seem good thing going on  just weary if in  <EOR> In fairness never done take Great Links last night won't take again   The brand new employee thrown phone orders dinner time worst phone skills any adult I'd ever met  took 10 mins write following order 1 onion ring 1 crinkle fry 1 veg ck patty buffalo sauce minus dairy  1 veg patty mushrooms no dairy  requested extra raw onions  10 minutes telling uh hold while he wrote   P u time 20 25 mins  arrived 15  food already bagged waiting  took home 10 mins took inside put food plates fried food saturated paper bags bottoms fell out  burgers sucked   I never take pics food reviews but pissed off spent 24$ quality food 2$  tip  No onions all burger best 5 slices mushrooms   The previous time ate roughly month ago extremely short handed cooks made serve tables  same order above did take them 25 minutes which crazy long  chefs trade know being short handed kitchen   happens but seems Great Links trying cut cost turn they're going lose business   We love going near house hope Great Links gets stuff together  <EOR> Since discovering Great Links year ago husband son eat least 2 3 times month it's go to place Saturday Sunday afternoon   all times eaten still haven't even scratched surface menu!
