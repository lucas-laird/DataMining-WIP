 It took long time anyone take order even longer food come out  When food finally arrived huge letdown  flatbread extremely greasy soggy result   My friend ordered calamari said very chewy  She also ordered salad which she said nothing special  steak undercooked chewy bland  worst part hair plate!! GROSS!  After hearing all rave reviews disappointed place  Overpriced mediocre food snooty service  No thanks won't coming back won't recommending anyone  <EOR> I last night let say wow! decor beautiful homey  loved play old movies well  sat bar bartender Jose adorable attentive  ordered black dragon also known blackberry mojito  He made especially liking less sugar   also tiramisu let say far best tiramisu ever life  hear food amazing look forward trying soon! <EOR> Everything place absolutely gorgeous!! love much back husband nights  food pretty pricey being off strip but worth because everything delicious! only little complaint forgot free birthday dessert! Lol! No biggie! don't attention anyway! <EOR> Tasty food great wine selection perfect service! We definitely back try other tasty dishes menu  Nice ambiance special occasions date night girls night out  <EOR> Located inconspicuous office park Summerlin Vintner Grill favorite dinner spot mine few years now  Looking address being familiar most restaurant locations Vegas off strip would assume entrance facing directly onto Charleston Blvd but would mistaken  Once finally locate entry amongst your standard setup covered office parking spaces back enter space rich modern design accessories  might tad cluttered but really space always loved everything eaten dinner  first time lunch jumped chance when saw burger menu  But did stand well dinners eaten?  The short answer no  said really never any complaints anything dinner but found several things wrong burger  First off bun meat ratio bit high just more bun needed  didn't help quite dry really distracted meat   which turn good thing because even though ordered medium rare always way over cooked  burger still surprisingly juicy even being more cooked I'd yet time last few bites very dry  Overall meat little flavor but char flavor did outside quite good  bacon really great smoky flavor cooked properly nice crunch it  'homemade' pickles also great flavor but bit lost burger   The fries another disappointment  Typically everything included meals Vintner down sides always great yet fries very little flavor just seemed bit uninspired  would expected black truffle touch something them but no such luck   Overall burger did good flavor but dry bun boring fries didn't help overall experience much  While wouldn't necessarily recommend going burger would definitely recommend Vintner Grill any time great date spot just nice dinner  <EOR> A OK     Packed button down big watch guys cougars   Felt set Reallife Housewives OC   Food well priced good great some bad some good  <EOR> Been twice company dinner   First time calling reervations  whoever answered phone cold greetings!
