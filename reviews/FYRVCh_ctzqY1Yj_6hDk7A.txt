First off customer service place great  I walked mac shack wanting hoping warm cheesy goodness would next new level mac cheese arsenal  so ordered smoke house mac cheese which description menu sounded ridiculous  pumped thought self man going epic!!! also garlic bread because love some good garlic bread so sat down very well done restaurant area Then short time soup   I mean mac     well could passed soup  looking stomach rumbling take bite instantly overwhelming taste very sweet bbq sauce hit taste buds hint smoked gouda promised menu   The dish resembled vodka sauce mac elbows no cheese much soupy sauce could soke garlic butter covered little Cesar's style bread sticks  after 6 bites gave abandoned dish  I really wish would better experience fast casual restaurant  maybe cook needs retrained replaced way wont getting any $13 lunches me   to first impressions everything should be  places food did impress slightest  <EOR> I ordered chicken Alfredo mushrooms  okay  Compared other location Warm Springs Durango seemed stingy ingredients  also upgraded mangia barely chicken mushroom  fan Mac Shack's chicken general something off maybe little dry me  flavor wasn't strong I'd maybe penne thick don't know  pretty fast service friendly place something quick mediocre  garlic bread free when check thank goodness because definitely worth $2  Probably give them another shot but any time soon  <EOR> Had cheddar Mac Philly cheesesteak Mac   Food fantastic!

   so left    sorry     don't care if ive missed best food earth  they never receive business  <EOR> I bought Groupon good $25 take food   Rather wait until Groupon ready expire used within few weeks buying it   I read concept place Yelp studied menu   wife told she wanted knew also   Off was   Since Groupon $25 made two meals manga size which extra $2 99 larger serving   wife pomodoro fresco angel hair pasta tomatoes marinara parmesan Romano cheeses   Crazy Alfredo which fettuccini chicken Italian sausage roasted red peppers shrimp sun dried tomatoes mushrooms jalapeños   also side sweet corn creamy parmesan sauce   Since already getting deal Groupon didn't double dip use Yelp check offer free garlic bread   Next time   The meals packed aluminum containers way less 10 minutes time walked door   Manga size much large us   some night rest next night leftovers   wife commented really enjoyed that! tried some dish good   fettuccini filled lot add ins Crazy Alfredo but fair amount chicken sun dried tomatoes   could used more jalapeños  personal preference   big disappointment corn   size serving just opposite large main dishes creamy parmesan sauce wasn't exciting   This interesting place quick pasta fix see myself stopping now then when don't want cook   A OK  <EOR> When first discovered place month two ago would given 5 stars  am glad waited review since 3 stars much more accurate reflection food service provide  Please keep mind review gluten free dishes only which means modifications made some sauces just pasta   First all if you're looking should order Baked Rigatoni $8 75   several times each time being phenomenal except yesterday when ordered disappointed wasn't much sauce   always gluten free not choice but necessity don't charge extra  LOT pasta! gluten free pasta tastes pretty darn close regular pasta yet sick meal which tells take food allergies seriously  A++ that! also GF versions Cheddar Mac $7 75 Pomodoro Fresco $7 75   Cheddar Mac absolutely delicious GF loves well Baked Rigatoni just much do  also enjoy Pomodoro Fresco good dish when want lighter pasta  Also enjoy very reasonably priced Green Salad $5 50 balsamic vinaigrette   Now disappointing ones Broccoli Pesto $8 50 Chicken Alfredo $8 95   Broccoli Pesto isn't anything write home but really dish huge disappointment chicken or lack thereof   chicken bland literally give few pieces whole dish  Additionally really bad experience Chicken Alfredo  only ordered once unhappy sauce runny none stuck noodles  approached appeared manager he dresses differently other employees explained  Now noticed before he isn't friendliest guy never smiles but other offers competent service maybe  just natural demeanor but thought he could better situation  He explained because gluten free sauce that  explained understood even though hard sauce thick without flour but still unhappy it  He offered no apologies but he did say he could put more cheese thicker said okay  came back barely improvement but wasn't going bother again  What's more only few pieces chicken dish too  Lesson learned order again  Quality doesn't sacrificed dish gluten free  would much happier apology offering another dish  hoping review helpful business owners management  place potential 4 5 star joint   With said continue repeat customer because other dishes enjoy! rest staff super friendly helpful  Service fast done smile  Much appreciated!  TL DR Affordable prices yummy pasta good service  recommend Baked Rigatoni Cheddar Mac Pomodoro Fresco  Don't order Broccoli Pesto GF version Chicken Alfredo both disappointing stingy chicken  Salads good! <EOR> I decided order off Postmates because offering special where order Mac N Cheese free just pay delivery   What total disappointment   I honestly felt Kraft Mac N Cheese would've better watered down crap got  ordered Cheddar Mac might well just eating plain noodles   The only good thing place Caesar salad even nothing write home about     I am just really shocked bad food because lot positive reviews    would hope just caught them bad day but feeling really bad all time just sadly over hyped Yelp   Smh  <EOR> I am hesitant call place real restaurant semi fast food cafeteria opinion   counter where pastas lined window order  minutes bam   your pasta arrives your table   trying keep perspective  would liken Fazolis something that   My wife spinach artichoke mac cheese while shrimp scampi   say wife liked but totally underwhelmed since she ability write own review experience   very disappointed when pasta showed salad shrimp   just vast gap between expected arrive those salad shrimp showed up   never seen them used shrimp scampi before must say think huge difference taste texture   Needless say experience highly disappointing don't think back feel could lot more value money elsewhere  <EOR> Mac shack pasta attack!  First time  impression east coast theme if Boston New York   Ordered off menu couple favorites quite please  Crazy Alfredo bottle service   Everything cooked fresh took around 20mins take away   For sure place  come back try something else out   Overall Price $$$ Food 4 5 Service 4 5 Come back yes <EOR> If more tan four pluck siting together if someone only table  whole wheat pasta anything long penne  <EOR> So yummy!!! bought groupon early dinner mom son  young man greeted friendly nice 100% knowledge menu vegetarian  food came great time fresh hot good! servers cashiers came check which love! restaurant cute clean great selection music 90's today! pretty much only ones there  Enjoyed time together food!

There's few times come can't order beer fridge staring wait 20 minutes them find manager  Plan schedule your employees accordingly   Last time swear holy potato EIGHT tables empty trashed  No cleaning up  Luckily drink machines self serve but friend sat talking almost hour half person come take away dirty dishes offer to go box  done past know something trained when refill soda saw two employees sitting texting cellphones  Maybe break but no else around clean havoc mess place in   As good pasta dirty environment lazy workers worry sanitary conditions food  Probably won't visiting much anymore  <EOR> Solid choice lunch although wasn't impressed overall   Came lunch special only find only most BASIC pasta choices sauces   instance Smokehouse Mac wanted order could substituted even higher cost   should allow premium choices add couple extra bucks per topping desired   So because ordered Pesto Penne $7 99 Lunch Special Comes Breadstick choice Soup Salad Drink  bad! Wish breadstick tasted fresher perhaps should added something else mix   like meat choice cheese something since pretty basic lacking depth   For soup choice Chicken Noodle Soup $3 95 but included w lunch special   Good but great   I'd recommend trying other choices    And because came mac first place ordered separate Smokehouse Mac $8 95 Smoked Gouda Cheese Applewood Smoked Bacon Barbecue Sauce  HUGE portion super rich HEAVY  am gouda LOVER but bit much eat   Another small qualm called initially ask if free wifi    I told yes   When arrived could work laptop phone   asking multiple employees some said did offer it   some said no   nobody able help working   Good luck! <EOR> I ordered fettuccine lunch special $7 99 came pasta choice side salad bread stick drink great price portions  added chicken broccoli pasta still under $12  definitely going back try Mac cheese  Good food good prices Lucas took order via phone very pleasant which always bonus  5 star happy when deliver <EOR> oh dear       mac shack really wanted better     better actually aspire be    Next time silly notion occurs house person clubbed baby seal  yo really just good    suckered exhaustion toiling mines all week taken twinkle groupon which actually fool wink did dirty deed ordered online two pastie dishes side cauliflower gratin scheduled pick hour later      what unpacked   was sad sad poor excuse spending money food worse than    well better jail but par hospital cafeteria    alfredo sauce oily pooled mess container instructions pack chicken separate arrived container side pesto sauce  oh cauliflower  great idea terribly executed  cauliflower even cooked bit gratin crust also oily cheese separated     hopes dashed   sit extra groupon taunting glee  <EOR> Self proclaimed mac cheese lover here   Can't believe just heard place now    live down street *palm forehead*  After drooling over all Yelp pics hit Mac Shack ordered Smokehouse mac shrimp scampi garlic bread     LOVED! Smokehouse   freakin' good those bacon bits which plentiful btw sweets lover well cheesy sweet bbq sauce money     Shrimp scampi little sour acidic   first bite intense weird flavor rush   sauce good    but okay enough eat pasta dip bread stick in   liked mini shrimp   Garlic bread alright   Nothing spectacular   totally Albertsons buy bread yourself   very soft though   super garlicy   This place gets stamp approval but call yourself Mac Shack only 5 mac cheese dishes??  plan try Asiago mac Crazy Alfredo next time  <EOR> I such high hopes place   drove way Warm Spring location only find closed couple months   drove Charleston location   am GF difficult find GF pasta anywhere didn't mind driving   did mind terrible food served   First pasta made corn   All GF people know cheapest all choices   spikes blood sugar difficult cook no nutrition flavor  What's wrong Brown Rice???  Anyway lunch awful undercooked because corn tough must over cook done guess don't know this   starchy stuck teeth   veggie garlic oil chicken   food swimming oil I indigestion just awful   tried eat starving adding salt cheese but no avail   left 90% plate  I won't return   Sadly continue cook CF brown rice pasta home <EOR> Mac Shack new experience me   hear through wife offered great pasta dishes competitive price   thought why not?  enjoy pasta offer gluten free option keep wife happy   Wonderful!

Great!  honestly did enjoy pasta dish chosen   nothing wrong just wasn't enjoying flavor   brought back front few bites   customer service stellar!  offered replacement no charge   second choice really good!  made experience great surely return! <EOR> Good pasta but bit expensive  broccoli pesto food good but did skimp pesto oil  finished bottom bowl still full oil pesto  good but aware may more expect! boyfriend baked rigatoni thought pretty good except sauce bit bland needed more spices  also meatball side garlic bread side  meatballs pretty generic okay but great but did garlic breadsticks all  seemed just dipped garlic powder didn't authentic taste it   Overall gave 3 stars because pasta good chicken broccoli dish cooked very well  aware prices though 2 pasta dishes 1 side the garlic bread free offer 2 fountain drinks $26 kinda expensive when essentially pasta restaurant few extra additions dish    Worth trying really want come back try mac cheese if called mac shack better delicious! <EOR> Love place  tried few things off menu   all pretty awesome  add any ingredients into pasta tons pasta types choose from  lunch special great deal  Nice decor food always table within just few minutes ordering  when order always really fresh  penne vodka sweet corn soup among favorites  just never crowded  <EOR> I always drive past place whenever Summerlin area finally decided try out  place reminds Panera Bread but pasta only version    I ordered Crazy Alfredo because  saw people rave most Yelp  $10 some change thought portion size more enough  LOT wasn't able finish whole bowl    My boyfriend did create your own pasta option which starting price $7 99 but 1 25 extra add ons  He's plain Jane he basically ordered fettuccine shrimp Alfredo but he liked whatever lol   We used free order garlic bread offer which order 2 garlic breads  pretty good  Nothing rave but nothing complain either   I'd recommend going during times lunch specials  $7 99 your choice pasta garlic bread drink  All all really good place filling inexpensive lunch  <EOR> Good wide array pasta quick  Portion size good  created own but next time try own craztions  basically Chipotle pasta  <EOR> Ok  grilled Mac cheese bowl chicken noodle soup  Heaven hubby farmhouse loved it! <EOR> Be aware when build your pasta add chicken $1 99 consists pre measured 2oz if your hungry suffice however portions famed Crazy Alfredo huge tasty  drinks bottomless service behind counter   good waiters   a bit subpar  recommended place friends following night dinner weren't able try Zoodles because Mac Shack ran out! Please prepared feed people what's menu walk 100 yards Whole Foods restock    SMH <EOR> The barbecue salad huge  Lots flavor  also gotten broccoli pesto pasta  broccoli ground into fine pesto no large pieces veggie  simple cheddar Mac cheese great choice too! <EOR> Mac Shack creating your own pasta meal breeze because all pick your pasta sauce toppings  There's many different options really made think wanted     I chicken pesto fettuccine mushrooms broccoli  also side cauliflower gratin   The pasta more al dente side but think prefer pesto dish  only thing didn't fact pasta sitting oil  understand some pasta dishes oily but swimming pool oil bottom bowl  really appetizing if there's oil dripping off noodles  Don't wrong still good had very rich pesto flavor but think really heavy oil   The cauliflower gratin amazing though! creamy cheesy same time bread crumbs little crispy which added even more texture flavor  surprisingly filling guess made extremely oily pasta     I think Mac Shack unique concept  give good portions your pasta okay price  I'd definitely suggest if you're looking something heavy lunch dinner  <EOR> This place great possibilities endless  Great choices all  food taste good don't need add any extra cheese  Great service very clean   Very good selection ambience music perfect volume    <EOR> Tried call ahead today order food told no need because food should five minutes   took them eight minutes tell all steak frozen original order   then took next 15 20 min redo order   Needless say did eat since entire lunch break used waiting food! <EOR> Not only food AWSOME! decor very cute creative  new fave mine  back most definitely!!!!! <EOR> Great pasta great choices!
