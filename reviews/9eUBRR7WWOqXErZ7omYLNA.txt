Well thought food good atmosphere great  Service ok but problem autogratuity 18%  point? Basically im forced tip even if service terrible? No thanks  <EOR> Lots eye candy however  it  Auto gratuity  equals terrible service  bartenders attitude boot   would given star but food good drinks strong  <EOR> Ordered drinks    took almost 20 minutes them then she wrong forgot hot can't anything around bar bartenders bad mood fell nice them don't even smile look when ask kind drink need $120 night back t j cheap joint people need CD training expensive forced tip? SMH <EOR> We came eat lunch since such nice day  brought some food 8 Noodle Bar waitress didn't mind which thoughtful her  just virgin strawberry mojito  good just hard drink big clumps strawberries would block off straw  need mince strawberries smaller  also tried some quesadilla Aunt ordered  really rich heavy kinda oily  overall just ok place  <EOR> Awesome poolside bar located inside RR  Gorgeous servers tasty drinks  yet try food but usually swim drink lol  Great meeting friends people watching just working your tan ice cold beverage  Chill vibe which like  Always fun experience here    A Must Try Piña Colada served inside pineapple doesn't more summertime that! #instagramworthy <EOR> Came twice convenience   first time ordered ceviche 3 5 ahi tuna app 1 5    probably worst ahi tuna ever had   could see tried making exciting flavors chose but everything felt war zone mouth    good blend all!  ceviche typical nothing rave about   The second time fish tacos few pineapple express drinks   time around food tasted MUCH better drinks pretty tasty also   Yes cost pretty damn high which really frustrating since your only option eat around pool   If changed policy allow outside food would bumped 3 stars   Instead taking star off purely because GREED  <EOR> Pool area service just ok  bad but great  Odd feeling somewhat lack emotion staff  Drinks strong plus <EOR> If could give place negative stars would  food only less impressive but made sick  charge 18% auto gratuity service best so so  Disgusting!! Save your money eat elsewhere!! <EOR> I came scorching Vegas afternoon enjoy some pool time  ordered strawberry margarita then frozen mule later  Both delicious although didn't seem strong hit spot hot day spent pool  only downside  bartenders bit slow take order both times  busy day but just surprising because 4 them behind counter  sure why took long someone even acknowledge but wasn't big deal  All all very cool place drink chill pool  I'd come back! <EOR> Been Sandbar bar few times bartender Brad very good job! He engaging friendly service top notch  He killer Long Island iced tea even remember wife drinking second time came  recommend see if want fast friendly service  <EOR> Like everyone else so far am leaving review concert attended because stayed Red Rock Casino pool food drinks    I actually did eat drink anything while show Lauryn Hill formerly Fugees formerly sane human being but offered marijuana fellow concert goer    It relatively strange concert venue  noted assigned seating chairs closest stage rest remaining venue GA SRO FLOOR  Would better use facility all GA? course  Could set some risers those 'special' people cannot handle GA? Definitely    In other words unnecessarily cramped especially considering prices charge tickets fact other poolside venues tons clear lines of sight?  decide if show here  just 'A OK' venue even though L Boogie set tremendous although cannot recall if where she fell onstage not  many Hill stage mishaps keep track without dedicated chart  E <EOR> The concerts Pool Red Rock great!   Gorgeous setting sounds good intimate concert feel unlike large venue    I expected weather hot but perfect every night  light breeze surrounding pools drop temp down just right summer night Vegas    Dress comfortable even dip your feet water if want to   3 concerts far plan going few more before summer ends  <EOR> Went Sandbar grill Red Rock Hotel Casino since $30 food credit during stay   place great takeout meal!  But least servers bikinis   The grill short customer service   sat empty table near bar menu hand ready place order back room   Waited 10 minutes no response anyone working!  move actual Sandbar 'bar' someone help me   Placed order Pool Burger Turkey Club   Then proceeded wait even LONGER   bar another good 30 minutes!  unorganized food tickets!  Luckily ladies working politely asked if still waiting food   Literally less two minutes later order arrived   Packed ready just sign order room   bill?  $39!!  Holy schnikes!  Turns Pool Burger $16 damn Turkey Club $15 then add tax AUTOMATIC 18% gratuity!  Ridiculous!  Poof food credit then some   I thought food better good   back room did unboxing   Food looked pretty MEH me   burger   club sandwich   damn turkey club wasn't even cut four triangles toothpick each should be!  damn turkey club didn't even come fries!  Argh!  Silly   Even worse turkey club bone dry!  No mayo!  no packets bag   kid liked pool burger cheese but again dry!  No mayo mustard ketchup top   If guys gonna why include some condiments bag?  Being 16th floor sure didn't feel going back down some   But least burger came FRIES   But mean doesn't include some damn ketchup if there's fries??  Total pisser   Mediocre overall still foot $9 food credit!  Shame shame   could cooked stuff myself better home   The +1 star pretty girls teeny bikinis workout!  But don't think many them even really swim   must also used distraction pool fooling customers into thinking Sandbar grill food best thing since suntan lotion   Touché Red Rock touché  <EOR> Got primo shaded spot pool didn't want leave ordered kid friendly lunch bikini clad server Hummus yummy came nice variety veggies olives pita  Chicken quesadilla tasty guacamole sour cream salsa Chicken nuggets flavorful came carrots celery mustard ranch Total $50 tax tip    Kiddos ended eating all hummus few bites quesadilla hardly any chicken nuggets   go figure  Adults enjoyed meal cleaned off  Overall surprisingly better imagined  <EOR> Great lunch! Broccoli salad perfectly poached chicken breast  Broccoli salad peanut dressing fantastic grilled broccoli  heavy hot sun but 6 7 ounce breast chicken  Chicken Caesar salad also terrific  Kid said burger great served brioche bun  She said juicy delicious  Service friendly prompt  great poolside restaurant  <EOR> Ok Sand Bar kinda boycotting  When there's concert going getting drinks pulling teeth  There's many people some bartenders know hell they're doing  if drink     be prepared wait line while  Unless they've gotten shit together  Personally don't think setup smart  bar off side while you're waiting line there's obstructions trees stuff your way hear concert see it  least put some video screens dude singing right? <EOR> 09 16 11 TEARS FEARS CONCERT   After attending thousands concerts most miserable venues ever encountered show  If could give zero would   First off WHERE did advertisements state SEATED vs STANDING tickets available? cordoned off section directly front stage then surrounded security goons  light board literally where shouldn't middle directly across stage but COMPLETELY BEHIND SEATED section poor folks couldn't into SEATED section which BTW ONLY HALF FULL entire evening stuck trying negotiate ANY remaining sight lines   And then when comes getting ANYTHING drink forget it  bars but virtually impossible walk around due all pools way  very surprised no fell considering DRUNK OBNOXIOUS crowd little amount room wander  did drink thing entire show 9pm until just 11   And crowd  OMFG WHY CONCERTS THEN SCREAM TOP YOUR LUNGS FRIENDS WHILE SHOW HAPPENING? WHY F**K EVEN THERE? Now said beginning literally thousands shows experienced many times  But CROWD takes cake obnoxiousness  nearly encountered fist fight between group drunks directly next caused a**hole couple shoved front 2 nice folks standing next first 45 mintues which if diffused would've ended domino effect getting spouse thrown into pool then believe DEATH SPOUSE would occurred!  And then actual people WORKING venue  NONE them seemed want there  DO BLAME THEM? thugs literally shoving people way escort special people SEATED section  Again surprised no ended pools  I overheard someone say fact Gee NO ended pool time! So advice is If show advertised venue unless those SEATED tickets  just isn't fun enough deal with  even THEN expect overcrowding chaos a**holes both w mgmt patrons   I moved Vegas last December  enjoyed EVERYWHERE tremendously  am Strip patron non Strip patron  free concerts Cosmopolitan shows punk venues Double Down Beauty Bar even shows Railhead inside Boulder Station all pleasant well staffed easy fun  first time 9 months being local where started thinking maybe made mistake moving here   Next show Joy Formidable @ Cosmopolitan Pool  Can't wait  Saw them Thursday night there  already bunch shows  <EOR> One Las Vegas's newest hot spots Red Rock Casino Resort Spa   review based Sand Bar entertainment events host pool   Arriving into desert A Tribe Called Quest  setting huge outdoor pool giant beds outdoor lounging   If hope score beds enjoy your concert experience expect early   definitely hard come by     With alcohol sold poolside still bring your previously purchased drinks into concert area  They'll pour your drink into plastic cup  all  A stage put performing artists its general admission feel free close personal making your way front   If arrive late plan spending time way back   pool being right middle venue your only options front sides way back     With being September headliners hitting stage 9 pm wasn't hot outside     Overall Red Rock Casino Resort Spa pretty cool place   Locals tourists frequent place off strip readily accessible those don't know it  <EOR> Ordered food drinks while hanging pool  Plenty servers walking around pool area serve you  Very convenient when don't feel leaving your spot poolside  Prices high but expected casino eatery  food surprising pretty good  turkey club jerk Chicken sandwich  Both came choice French fries sweet potato fries fruit  Sweet potato fries definitely great choice   Turkey club big enough 2! jerk chicken pretty good flavor well  Pitcher pineapple mojito refreshing  also off menu desert dole whip!
