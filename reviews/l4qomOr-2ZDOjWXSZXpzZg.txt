Does privileged good looking guy really want lower standards eat amongst obese alcoholic bottom feeders Summerlin?   Anyway   PHO ROSE gets 5 Stars being best Pho NW  <EOR> The hostess waitress clipping nails cash register should first clue turn around find different place eat dinner  But just moved Las Vegas hoping find new pho joint willing actually try food first before passed judgement   Unfortunately first impression correct   good  <EOR>
