Anyhow food tuna tacos octopus appetizer  Honestly expected more but very mediocre especially tasty flavorful  entrée ordered lobster which AMAZING  lobster came mashed potatoes brussel sprouts paired well lobster   Would recommend restaurant? Probably but if trying into Omnia yes think great deal  <EOR> We tried Searsucker fourth July weekend really honestly wanted it  did research excited try several menu items  greeted two completely unenthusiastic hostesses taken table  server Tammie knowledgeable when came menu drink suggestions  husband wasn't thrilled unbalanced rather sweet signature old fashioned  But being Vegas both still looking forward enjoying dinner     We seated open kitchen area which love! shocked watch chef touch every raw garnish every plate food then wipe hands apron less pants face phone  appetizing least  then watched manager at least  think manager touch every bit face eyes nose lips then proceeded touch raw garnish dish before sending along food runner  Obviously once saw few incidents began notice even more them  Kind train wreck just can't look away!   My husband both work industry sensitive some issues   never table unhappy without merit reason but found ourselves being irritated compounding service issues  Everyone phones almost entire time! don't say write lightly   chef manager woman assumed assistant manager phones significant periods time constantly texting  all lives communicate constantly but step off floor send your quick text but stand openly dining room 5 plus minutes your phone no sense unacceptable   The assistant manager younger woman did put phone down once seriously once entire evening  laughing end night  something never seen before   Neither food nor signature cocktails saving grace unfortunately   tried few appetizers wanting good idea concept Chef   started couple jar dishes first crab very note   crab hammered Sriracha mayo gargantuan pieces Avocado   Next tomato burrata jar perhaps best appetizer but burrata itself begging pleading salt which offered tables lol!   We also ordered bone marrow pork belly both which incredibly sweet   didn't even touch third bone because sweetness overwhelming which honestly saying something because both huge marrow fans   only thing remember pork belly sweet was     Lastly ordered grass fed NY steak two sides   ordered strip medium rare came BLUE completely cold middle   took 5 minutes contemplating sending steak back realized also missing sides     We NEVER send things back kitchen but point rather frustrated wanted least finish meal there  steak returned warmed through healthy rare but least edible   When corn finally arrived far best thing ate night   nice balance smoky spicy creamy  cauliflower good first but quickly became rather vinegary note    As last note while manager Chef steps away entire 2 plus hours having dinner neither them bothered acknowledge greet check in chat smile honestly look us   Why even open kitchen if aren't invested engaging dining room????   This LEAST expensive dinner ate trip MOST disappointing far  IMO service awful food mediocre   All all left feeling frustrated wasted evening trip Searsucker bummer! <EOR> The ambiance food good  ordered many small plates share calamari steaks octopus hamachi duck fat fries brussels cauliflower bone marrow  Everything OK nothing ate would say exceptional  However everything did look pretty tasty while did taste good again nothing special   We ordered grilled cheese couple salads tuna tacos some sliders  would say grilled cheese best all selections  Nice presentation really tasty well   My gripe experience waitress she seems over before wine even came out  bummer because truly believe experience huge part eating at least   She dry emotionless seemed annoyed overall which put damper experience unfortunately  Also place pretty empty which weird Saturday night Vegas 9 pm    I think prefer Herringbone Las Vegas   but probably wouldn't turn down coming again food decent enough try again  <EOR> One favorite experiences  friend invited late everything almost completely devoured  left able eat incredible   Woooow  visit again  <EOR> It first time more amazing heard  Servers upbeat wonderful  Desiree awesome great knowledge menu  Definitely coming back more  Ermahgurd!! <EOR> This place located right next door Omnia  came dinner plans nightclub afterwards  food surprisingly delicious! ordered bunch different items share amongst group whole lot cocktails party started early  tried friend's Fizzy Lifter cocktail light fruity yummy! would recommend any girls fruity drinks  favorite item everything ordered spicy hamachi avocado! don't usually spicy food but dish very tolerable  guys also 36 oz ribeye tomahawk  Let tell you  that thing massive!!! couldn't even finish it  Overall wonderful dining experience  <EOR> Happy Hour Review Skip humous order sliders duck fat fries bruschetta   Don't order martini honey blue way sweet  <EOR> Amazing drinks delicious food great atmosphere perfect combination relaxing enjoyable dining experience   tried place because liked menu online live SoCal options near home good way try some yummy food may also able try when home   trying restaurants near home sure too     The service solid but also during Happy Hour slight slow times but over all very solid   We during Happy Hour collection share table try several different options   Hummus very flavorful bread delicious alone but hummus added to It   Potato fries anything fried duck fat going amazing did disappoint   prosciutto dust added flavor   Slider perfectly cooked nice spicy them   Tuna taco fresh flavorful <EOR> Cocktails food delicious great atmosphere   would give 5 but steak came well done instead medium rare first time but corrected grace   Definitely come back  <EOR> Stopped happy hour before show   Nice atmosphere decor   Hummus excellent pita bread housemade   Tuna tacos also very good  <EOR> Just okay  Service pretty annoying  wouldn't leave alone could finish certain items ask every little thing  bugged constantly ate then literally disappeared 15 minutes finished  cannot stand bad service when paying high price point    Best part Short ribs horse radish mash  good  Worst part over cooked New York waiter held 'better light' over friend's head show 'what ordered ' unprofessional quite rude  husband much more forgiving just ate since waiter argued degree cooking  sharing actually didn't eat any steak  Thankfully friends shared short rib me    Pear goat cheese salad good  Kale Ceasar good  Mac cheese good  Butter potatoes good  All just good  Vegas Ceasars Palace Saturday nights    I want great amount money paying    I won't back  100 other options 1 mile radius  <EOR> Being good wife am took husband dinner Searsucker   Having dined before knew he would enjoy tasty dishes     I originally just wanted stop happy hour but since event going bar area stepped full dining experience   Service great!

She knew whole menu she never missed group   Drinks When Doves Cry Two thumbs up Snake Grass meh  sweet didn't taste any alcohol it  We taste syrah just terrible  Maybe open long maybe wine just bad   We more cocktails quite few wines but don't remember enough them post anything   Food Braised Pork Butt Tasty more enough food itself! Scallops Great definitely worth ordering Bigeye Tuna Very good though could used little more flavor kick notch Tacos looked good but itty bitty  Some smallest tacos ever seen  warm spinach salad looked little small side too  Though spinach really shrinks heat maybe why   Also those wondering   the things listed under 'Jars Sliced' literally come jar  great if sharing but fun if just you   Overall great option dinner close strip! <EOR> Inside Caesars find gem  Loved decor! all shared huge 36oz amazing tomahawk steak feed 6 people  Mac n cheese bomb!
