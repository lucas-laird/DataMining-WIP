Alcoholic Milkshake fried Oreos top! <EOR> Can't comment food because security wanted strip search before could door  establishment apparently contiguous nightclub sufficiently concerned its own clientele feel necessary pat down everyone steps through door  hungry but ravenous couldn't choose restaurant doesn't search before eat  <EOR> This place nice ambiance  inside Gold Spike plenty games things do  However food mediocre  order Shrimp Poor Boy coated shrimp Panko breading becomes really hard cuts roof your mouth  Unicorn Grilled Cheese way sweet very unappetizing  <EOR> League Legends main reason why even considered coming ironically crows sitting trees outside lol  From outside place almost invisible if wasn't back door which labeled would completely missed spot  through goldspike club then aimlessly wander back where stumble right into it   As unimpressive outside inside may seem    whatever reason food outstanding   3 egg omelet substitute meat other veggies surprised filling delicious meal turned be  came side potatoes which very good well French vanilla cappuccino   The price sat higher side things over $11 omelet   other place wasn't bad find all  <EOR> It co workers suggestion check new place birthday honest bad feel perhaps still working details few dishes   The nachos plate hit everyone portions perfect seemed first dish disappear before even touched own personal dishes   Presentation all food nice appealing creating anticipation bite in!  Caprese flatwich just right overwrought many topping leaving bread soft rightly portioned still crisp!  Fish tacos Alaskan cod tacos great light crispy battered cod filets topped nice slaw cheery tomatoes  good but could use perhaps mild aioli maybe slight kick  Just some feedback Chicken waffles chicken very good! breeding crisp chicken nice juicy  happy waffles  seemed flat soft when cut into them actually came part perhaps crumbled may better word    Most dishes served side potato tots Nacho hit also!  I'm going come back later time give place another chance    Lastly able try milkshakes super delicious!! Try Dude chocolate y yummy! <EOR> Came specifically Unicorn Grilled Cheese well worth it  Also ordered chicken waffles unfortunately did meet expectations  just okay  amazing service though! put bacon when asked none happy remake food well gave two cookies apologize inconvenience  cookies really good super happy service <EOR> Best French dip years seasoned Au jus  tons flavor big portions excellent au jus most restaurants weak au jus just colored water place worth going downtown just eat here <EOR> 1st time place  Rad!
