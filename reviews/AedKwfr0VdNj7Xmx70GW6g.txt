Tonight supposed grand opening flight beers all those over legal age  Arrived 5 30 into bar  Didnt server table until 6 gave wants free flight   excited try brews sat another 20 minutes never tasters    Just wanted support new local non chain company  <EOR> Save your money! Though selection beers impressive food slightly better mediocre  17 99 Ginger Salmon decent but brocolli both mushy hard same time! When asked chef he did he replied didn't look good but he could use fresh stuff if wanted more!!! <EOR> I don't want premature writing restaurant only because Old School Brewing Company seems open prematurely   mentioned other reviews no character ambiance yet   some point something bare brick walls but time only two flat screen TVs   menu odd   ordered chicken sandwich which comes tator tots BBQ sauce on side    Tator tots fine   sandwich nothing more grilled chicken breast nice bun lettuce tomato     could easily bland sandwich home   son ordered chicken wings   Really nothing memorable them   certainly usual battered wings come expect appetizer item would order again   wife ordered Margherita Pizza which lists basil ingredients   No real evidence basil   really great pizza just average   clear restaurant trying fit into its skin   Beer brewing seems real focus food   all call themselves brewing company   think time menu tweeked necessity restaurant more inviting families especially those neighborhood used bring families old pizza joint occupied building many years  What's missing carpet video games kids now just concrete floor all cracks repairs    covered something pay few insurance claims slip and fall lawsuits! When figure serve tator tots maybe burgers pizza popular place all local sports teams dads moms want great beer   beer GREAT!  spoke manager permitted smoking bar   He stated new ventilation system which keep stench restaurant   hope sake he right   No family subject kids foul odor cigarettes if owner can't isolate pet project beer bar!  wish them luck   We'll try again someday but now know where great pizza great wings   We'll give them chance figure works best then drop again second try    <EOR> I wanting try place awhile since under construction such long time  didn't when first opened but finally around earlier week when friend suggested instead normal Porchlight Grille   I say employees very nice welcoming! Since only 2 other people bar area around 530 very attentive really liked bartender   They also beer pong which people actually did start play later evening   That being said food brought 4 star 3  new happy hour 4 7 half off appetizers  pumped called wife come some food well   We ordered Buffalo wings w buffalo sauce 4 5 good sauce great wings  Buffalo wings w Kiss death sauce 4 5 interesting very spicy sauce if want ton kick should get  Cheese curds 2 5 pretty bland  can't really wrong cheese but batter used anti flavor  just made whole plate pretty meh   Wurst n tots 2 5 Same deal  wife German she's generally skeptical when order anything bratwurst related but same problem cheese curds   just lacked taste  tots very good but bratwurst very bland it's also fried same batter perhaps  problem? The service food also pretty slow which assume kitchen because bartender seemed pretty top it  ordered mostly things just drop fryer but somehow some things took 20 30 minutes come all appetizers btw      ambiance wasn't bad little empty but wouldn't noticeable if weren't few people there   All all may back time time the beer good but when porchlight grille right next store hard time going there  <EOR> If only negative ratings choose still wouldn't show horrible place is  came last night eat some beer guess brewery WITHOUT ANY BEER! read right no beer whatsoever brewing stock  say come back tomorrow well since DMV decided give another chance  says open 11 but nope open  should just board doors call quits    <EOR> I really really want place  really do! love support local breweries hope come back support one    Like many other users left review also came grand opening  offering free 4 X 4 oz flight beers 5 pm 10 pm  Luckily early able table    At 5 15 bar area only being half full already struggling flight orders  waiter seemed panicked rapidly took orders  He didn't really give any recommendations history brewery  some more people join around 6 30 pm ended waiting bar 20 minutes place more orders  point SUPER obvious staff just plain annoyed promotion decided offer weren't shy voicing it    The beer itself OK  Stout Red best  wouldn't advise ESB if aren't familiar taste  Hef Vanilla Stout little light side  think all ordered multiple Stouts Reds throughout night   I little saddened staff  know Grand Opening busy night but your chance gain some loyal customers share your brand world! should exciting!   I plan giving place second Grand Opening night  <EOR> Will update rating once fix beers  Live area porch light lot  watch place remodeled saw brewing getting installed which super exciting  Denver Colorado lived LV 2 years now looking new place some craft beers  looked around no character design  TVs tables no photos anything walls  Sat down put some money in  Asked beer  came warm   why? asked bartender hurt it  Still drank it  next door porch light cold beer!! Woke stomach ache bad beer! need figure problem out  Properly close tell don't loose much street credit    <EOR> Rating based beers alone Love beers Old School! Everyone them quality brews just enough twist them unique  did anything eat cannot comment quality food but menu looked offerings step typical bar food  All being said really need some work atmosphere decor service all other things required place success  location isn't best another bar right across lot  Exterior signage needs some work  Right now want come here  sure much passerby traffic get  relatively new place understand takes time money build success  Let's hope case Old School  Vegas needs more places where taste quality microbrews! <EOR> Just stopped quick lunch while working  stout     it good would two but working ordered chicken fingers w tater tots     tots ok standard frozen deep fried stuff  chicken fingers more nuggets but fresh breaded tasty! BBQ sauce bit spicy side but liked same With honey mustard  Over all pretty solid spot coming back <EOR> The beer better when Jim brew master here   food OKAY but service terrible   place much potential bad  <EOR> I really hate giving bad reviews but unfortunately prepared big crowd   advertised grand opening offering free flights beer however dropped ball customer satisfaction  beginning end service extremely slow  took 15 minutes order drink   Most staff really did care above beyond duties  bartender kind rude pretty much ignored most time  Once placed food order screwed wait long time it  partial order 40 minutes later!!! personally did care beer selection even though beer affectionate  However if dark coffee beers girlfriend recommends porter  sad terrible experience place might potential but worst experiences long time  worst part people around same experience struggling food drink order    Oh did mention toilet seat covers!! Come America! traveling back home! <EOR> I really wanted place LOVE local breweries!  Unfortunately beer warm likes warm beer?? warm put ICE it    meal mediocre  husband ordered medium rare burger which came well done hockey puck  ordered sandwich off Chef's specialties grilled ham cheese sauce which bad  took 3 4 bites queasy    ended throwing twice before left!   I say beer good once cold  server explained cooling mechanism broken parts order but won't another 2 weeks!  brewery ok serving WARM BEER almost 3 weeks?!    Also tots served burger sandwich tasty!   My guess should realized food may off when walked 6pm Thursday night place completely EMPTY  <EOR> Keep goin' Old School  classy clean  Almost ZERO cigarette smoke smell  You allowed smoke      But place itself worth visit  Nice people!  if want chill its nice place  P S  Christine bartender DELIGHTFUL!! <EOR> Wow if your local gamer thinking stopping maybe your local spot    don't bother    bartender service bad <EOR> Food good service friendly but thought expensive portions small   place also empty didn't look business going good   son said beer ok nothing rave about  <EOR> Double c tacos awesome!
