Hahaha omg best decision ever  called advance sure would room  Once showed medium large room choose decided medium room  around 15 20 fine! friends blast  4 hours price wasn't even bad anticipated!! definitely recommend come Bazic karaoke!! <EOR> Maybe just didn't come right type mindset wasn't rowdy group weren't drunk didn't karaoke  Regardless place dead late Friday night    Food isn't bad but hella overpriced  just wings they're even great  They're small but quality does justify prices here  No reason spend $15 10 wings $15 shareable size shaved ice dessert    Service nearly nonexistent doesn't speak much English  Menu difficult understand looks middle school student put together ClipArt forgot use spellcheck  <EOR> Good place karaoke night! 20 hour but if spend over 50 10 bucks off  place nice song list clean rooms  servers very nice quick  never wait room  If chance def try monster fries! <EOR> I've multiple times over past 9 years always loved it  just left because almost 40 minutes couldn't even drink large group just two people  flag down waitress she said because the drinks ordered hard grinded   ordered those drinks before course did take 35 minutes   Also place near empty when arrived  Any yelp users know good Korean bar drinks? advice would greatly appreciated  <EOR> Late night random karaoke nights best!   We decided come because Zizzy wasn't very welcoming  did small room $20 hour but when spend over $50 $10 off karaoke    We 2 am til 5 am! blast gentleman working very attentive  He gave two free sakes because he forgot  extensive song list sound system pretty bumping too!   Definitely come back again! <EOR> I karaoke place some friends recommending place  busy street China town but place  love room karaoke because accommodated 10 friends  Definitely coming back  <EOR> Great place come Saturday night!! Aside amazing drinks food fantastic including best Musabi tried Vegas  Thanks great service always Eric Saehee! <EOR> I come often various friends family far best karaoke joints town  also often recommend business many others well! However last visit very disappointing  visited website coupon under Promotions tab stated if $50 tab higher deduct 50% off total bill  did honor during last visit even though coupon did expiration date listed website  <EOR> Been few times watermelon soju always bomb  Also if something quick greasy cheese corn always good thing for  <EOR> An evening fun getting celebrity on   night few celebrations meanings   first time karaoke joint where parties given private rooms belt including laughter plain enjoyable!  Simba courteous server throughout event   Actually another lady helping but didn't catch name   Apologies there    But Simba gave quick tutorial equipment explained food items before taking order checked frequently throughout night     For friend Clarise's new job he gifted watermelon paradise   Really cool them!  prepared pretty artisticly display centerpiece see pic    I'd say good 4 hours less eat drink sing   Pricing per room hour per person   think  better   Since place also serves drinks bar items appetizers food plates   idea offer way   establishment also available dining without karaoke bar hangouts   One thing question yelpette friends pointed whether shells rocks restroom sink sanitary   Similar thought while washing hands eeuuuw all germs wash down don't touch them although stylish   friend right    Looks needed bleached washed cuz around edges inside sink looked little filthy   Anywhobees new management name now a18   Still recommending chance your few minutes celebrity vocalist status behind closed doors here   really fun! Book bunch people   some drinks clear your throat belt those octaves! 4 5**** <EOR> Fun place! Friendly staff soju daaaays  Food over priced IMO  Drinks priced relatively good tho  CHEERS! <EOR> Came night large group friends karaoke   quite busy   Drinks plenty especially yogurt soju beer   song selection entertaining good time!  Only sample few food items fries wings can't really judge them food but good enough few hours fun service excellent we'd definitely return next time  <EOR> Staff very attentive when walked into place  big group rooms where karaoke in  song book very extensive rooms disco ball   food really good wings other extras  great selection drinks choose good prices  Would recommend place people looking fun time  <EOR> My friends decided spur moment karaoke night ended Bazic  only largest room available which more money per hour but when came time pay bartender gave standard rate! all really appreciated that!   They good selection songs sadly no Ice Ice Baby though machine more even listed book  difficult use remote first but once knew doing breeze    I would totally come back! <EOR> Bazic pretty good alternative whenever Qkaraoke fully booked which happens quite often weekend nights    The song selection par song selection Q  pretty updated includes both old new songs various languages    The service friendly enough  buzzer room customers food drinks technological assistance whenever need it  Else staff usually bar    The downsides Bazic rooms aren't all clean  fact would far say some rooms dingy side  smaller rooms particular very badly lit difficult read song selection sometimes  <EOR> I absolutely love place!!! music selection great only lot oldies but goodies but also bunch new stuff!!! staff great chef awesome prices even better! Best spring rolls life place!!! ny kareoke spot  <EOR> Great place fun group  8 private room good time  Liked soju  Drink prices good  didn't eat but food seemed bit overpriced  defiantly back again  <EOR> I reserved room karaoke twenty birthday great time  people under 21 didn't really host but everyone enjoyed themselves  No showed use machine but figured out  served water which nice  great selection music including newer stuff   We did order drinks bar thought very affordable  bottle soju $20 which 6 shots liquor    The room affordable amount people  believe $40 hour but cheaper rooms less people   Overall staff nice bathroom clean would definitely karaoke again  <EOR> The rooms food liquor overpriced imo   gambling bar getting drinks free singing free well   bad place all   If prefer private rooms blast!  those people  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!!  So felt doing little karaoke birthday friend recommended try place! first time soon walked staff cheerful friendly  attentive all night made sure enjoying ourselves  Sadly didn't try food but people party definitely kept ordering all kinds things    believe saw someone chowing down Ramen? Soju other hand     yum yum yum!!!! friends definitely back! TWO thumbs <EOR> No star!!!!!  It WORST experience food ever!!!!   I ordered wings but gave legs uncooked BLOOD chicken  Also cabbage which comes side very bitter couldn't even give bite!!! could't eat any place but pay all food!!!   If fry shoe taste much better food place!!! <EOR> This place far exceeded expectations!! Saturday stayed hours! Very cool place staff takes very good care you!! drinks very good nothing over saturated anything! song choices amazing! Once your playlist just sing away  scores end good feeling getting 100!!  Try Yogurt soju favorite everyone!! Seriously everyone tried it! <EOR> I always great time here  don't always come sing  Surprisingly enough most visits happen long night work winding down some bottles soju some comfort Korean food    Both Yogurt Soju Peach Soju top flavors above all  sure sample those before trying other flavors but BEWARE drink sweet easy shoot sure keep yourself hydrated since you're more likely going feel later LOL    The food definitely complements your palate couple hours drinking ranging soups rice dishes everything between pretty standard late night Korean menu  loved everything tried if you're eyeing item order it! Chances you'll satisfied your decision   The karaoke rooms clean spacious while song selections quite date  larger your group better  way everyone rent room battle each other karaoke style order ton food last supper massive amounts Yogurt Soju around hours  Good night indeed  <EOR> Bazic recently hired new chef Michael he legit  kalbi ribs popular but volcano corn comes side absolutely addicting  <EOR> There management change some pros cons  mainly Bazic fried chicken karaoke in order   newer changes karaoke set upgraded now wireless microphones don't knock over drinks table wired versions  fried chicken subpar though  Chicken should floured fried crusty crunchy outside but new chicken dipped seems very liquid batter  the kind would find fish n chips  C'mon no should batter chicken wings that  If when back going forego chicken  stick other menu items  <EOR> Cool Karaoke spot Chinatown  private rooms plenty booze keep liquid courage going  Only 1 person room knew work remote he dictator karaoke room  didn't try food but everyone seemed it  <EOR> I've only Bazic drinks  never ordered any actual food here  only thing eaten Bazic sampler appetizer platter fries tots etc comped during night drinking  think gave apology having anything wanted drinks wise   HAHA    The owners staff really nice here  sat bar night awesome conversation owner  planning trip Korea he some really good advice when go  He also told Korean boyfriend Korean sounded foreign probably ripped off  Thanks boyfriend! HAHA    I always tend order some cocktail soju because yummier regular soju  Also cocktail soju can't found Korea  guess very Americanized thing  LOVE yogurt soju which pretty much soju mixed yakult those tiny yogurt drinks  lychee peace soju equally good well  did watermelon soju ALL! also tried mixed drinks    lot them really sweet would probably just stick soju    He also lets sample soju if don't flavor don't take it! But okay  alcohol  Just chug it!   Great service  Great drinks  never pricey whenever either  Super thumbs up! <EOR> My friend raving good chicken wings since Vegas   so course stop here  Sad enough place huge disappointment  According friend   the wings used huge if chicken steroids but came tiny little wingstop wings  ordered 20 chicken wings expecting table 4 full off but didn't happen  3 flavors available wings original no sauce soy garlic kinda tasted Chinese soy sauce wings spicy guchujang sauce   personally preferred spicy all three flavors but all just okayy wings  Additionally ordered watermelon soju but didn't arrive till everyone finished meal    Overall service incredibly slow wasn't anything special unique food  <EOR> This place alright  terrible smell smoke fan didn't protective cover it  words beats didn't match song consistently noticed lot errors lyrics  If you're drunk look past then guess place would fun  provide water  Also when pay sure front buzz host  easy miss check area  haven't tried food don't think returning try future but overall okay experience  <EOR> Bazic very nice atmosphere drinks always come time  Rooms almost always available song selection superb  Waiters waitresses always friendly willing assist    7 7 <EOR>
