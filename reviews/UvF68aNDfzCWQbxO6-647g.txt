Lee's mall across street open 24 hours they're much more friendly there  <EOR> How ironic 200th review Terrible 2 star review    For sure planned when wanting try new spot lunch today My first last visit am sad report Mr  Sandwich chance did satisfy shall continue affair Lee   I tried grilled pork bahn mi two shrimp spring rolls    The bread DRY very little filling inside sandwich where pork? Also no extra house mayo added requested   The shrimp spring rolls good enjoyed sweet dipping sauce came them   When order ready asked Sriracha guy handed tiny little plastic cup lid pointed dining table said table   odd very friendly type service am used elsewhere   I won't back however least curiosity cured gave them shot!  Totally disappointed Lee baby come! <EOR> This whole wall good banh mi    bread yummy doesnt hurt upper mouth region when eating   As group springrolls eggrolls those also good   The boba decent 2 1    I cheap eats yummy everytime  <EOR> Instant hit! all starts baguette itself!
