Celebrating bday couldn't gone better <EOR> Went Chayo last night while entertaining some business friends    Saw long tequila list line thought would fun taste bunch    Asked waitress list she none she said over 100 but known her     Drinks came all waitress did remember ordered drink    Same happened when food arrived    all passing plates around right person     Food overall good    Guacamole tasty all tacos      We continued drink some high end tequila throughout dinner      This where bunch tequila irritated Check arrives hand written bottom says suggested 20% Tip = 76 90 Thank     Not happy note manger he said sorry     waitress asked    Did restaurant your choice?    short dialogue she said idea write it      6 non rowdy business people    She would received  more then 20%    She less  Food Ok but service unprofessional trained well    many places eat Vegas     Don't bother one  <EOR> Came 1 4 14 rather large group dinner without reservations  From  outside looks great! Stone front heaters outdoor seating  Once inside very intimate setting dim lights fine dinning   place mind brand spankin' new! Even new smell  far good right?   Wellllll starters group ordered pitcher Mexican Mule  Took awhile recieve pitcher when did receive happy saw  First off bring several glass filled ice straw course  Secondly called pitcher imagined traditional beer pitcher but oh well  Thats really problem  happy fact pitcher more half way filled ice mind already ice glass brought   Basically pitcher really ice ice! Equivilent 3 half drinks! drink good give them that  But remove ice pitcher poor rest cocktail into seperate glass because ice pitcher kept pouring out   Now food  ordered Flank Steak Yucca Fries Chimichurri  just just fell short  steak cooked well done but no taste  Even though says chimichurri those flavors nonexistent  only tasty thing plate yucca fries  Boyfriend ordered Pork Sopes which did fact try chorizo way overcooked greasy  Very unpleasant say least   Our servers great cannot deny that  Overall Chayo's food very bland under seasoned pitcher drinks worth all  <EOR> Surprisingly good breakfast  Good service waiter  Masih well  pleasant surprise  <EOR> My first time Chayo server Christina perfectly attentive accommodating! She did great job!!! highly recommend Chayo! Fun atmosphere! <EOR> Worse hostesses  bad service terrible food your better off going Roberto's treated fast food joint two thumbs down save your money elsewhere!! <EOR> Had nachos   probably but cheese sauce different   bad just different   plus side jalapeños yummy fresh <EOR> Great prices drinks  Chips salsa house! Would highly recommend place reasonable drinking  sangria fabulous white best   Excellent service  <EOR> I looking forward trying restaurant but ended leaving because requesting high top table left standing around 10+ minutes never seated  hostess clearly pleased request very rude telling would wait high top cleared  place busy all table hardly dirty should only taken someone 2 minutes clean reset it  standing between table bar when hostess came told move closer bar because health code violation stand next table  Maybe  true don't know but literally only moved 6 inches away appease her  meantime several bus boys wait staff circling around but guess important enough clean table only two empty glasses it  standing around more nobody acknowledged again left  Terrible terrible customer service  <EOR> Awesome place    Great food  Waitress Christin best   !! point grub Drinks  !

Food very good loved shrimp tacos! <EOR> So sick coming restaurant bar playing same music swear repeated same song 10x whole night !!!!!!!!!! <EOR> Loved Chayo's breakfast  huevos rancheros amazing  Service great server Reno very attentive helpful menu selections! Would definitely come back! <EOR> Good spot few drinks  mechanical bull going DJ playing nothing but good music  Service its alright but definitely recommend it  <EOR> Beyond over priced terrible service  almost ready leave due NEVER getting water   remind waitress over 3 times everything      water     flat ware     napkins   all stuff should just standard restaurant anyways   Food ok but definitely  $$$  WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND coming here  <EOR> Okay maybe watched many episodes Bar Rescue Restaurant Impossible  no longer enter dining drinking establishment without wondering John Taffer Robert Irvine might say it  Unlike everywhere else world Las Vegas seems if establishment enough foot traffic keep books above water doesn't really matter right wrong  location Linq would assume Chayo enough foot traffic hapless unknowing tourists don't worry doing everything or anything right least little while   My friends all locals decided brave strip rare night town  Linq seemed fun spot eat drink chose Chayo dinner  No complaints service fast efficient friendly the fact waitress acted if she'd never asked split check notwithstanding   But immediately found myself confused overall theme  Loved colorful Mexican folk art masks adorned walls warm dim lighting set stage chill dinner among friends  music other hand set different tone  Iggy Azalea other dance pop artists boomed speakers making difficult conversate without lot Huh?  sorry what? Maybe some people particularly partying strip going crowd into can't judge them harshly but selection seemed stark contrast traditional Latin décor  Tapas plus Iggy   confusion  Tapas plus fun flirty Latin tunes   awesome    Further confusing factors? mechanical bull somewhat centered dining floor  Sure fun watch some crazy folks tossed unapologetically wild fake bull but exactly I'd call dining entertainment  trip bathroom incredibly drunk girl sink asked going ride bull?  No tonight   C'mon why not? She asks  Followed You're Vegas! because Vegas am required indulge every stupid gimmick throw me? mention getting whipped around ragdoll filling tummy sangria spicy salsa cheesy enchiladas doesn't sound good time ALL   And now let's talk food  love tapas  love love LOVE tapas because never decide want  Tapas gives opportunity neigh RIGHT taste everyone else's food  If you're definition tapas small plates then only sort nailed it  experience great thing truly authentic tapas experience each dish just enough taste share cost each dish reasonably reflects get  Here's thing no idea Chayo considered tapas style because each dish between $18 $24  Perhaps am incorrect estimations but merely portioning food increments four 4 tacos 4 enchilades 4 pieces street corn while still charging same price would personal entrée isn't truly tapas   more I'd call family style except isn't enough whole family without completely busting your bank    Between husband chicken enchiladas shrimp tacos  enchiladas 4 tiny hand made tortillas filled I use term filled loosely tasty meat generously coated traditional red sauce  Good but outstanding  first thought I'd order beer battered lobster tacos because sounded good theory but then thought right mind would beer batter deep fry lobster? thing? Good fresh lobster stand beacon hope without much ado nothing  Battering deep frying feels deception  Instead opted grilled shrimp tacos  Again four soft corn taco shells stuffed generous amount shrimp very lightly seasoned cooked quite nicely  tacos came side creamy pinto beans seasoned bacon dollop forgettable rice  standout plate side beans  bad? No  But $18 each expected if larger portion more immaculate flavor  forget Sangria  easily kill pitcher good Sangria own but opted share $32 pitcher some friends  Tapas right? pitcher 80% ice enough 4 glasses  Deep glasses yes but glasses also 80% full ice  only drank 1 glass  Why? Because tasted came premixed bottle  No chunks apple other fruit  Just ice watered down flavored wine   deeply disappointing    Ultimately most restaurants strip save those run big wigs Chayo lot hype loud music party vibe  food drinks? Save your money food trucks downtown where focus food drunken idiot mechanical bull <EOR> Horrible experience!   Food tasted meh  asked chicken steak burrito  Waitress said chicken burrito inconsistent watery sometimes bland  steak burrito full rice little ground steak some cheese beans  margaritas tasted good least    Disgusting service! ordered champagne when first sat down  didn't until meal which took over hour  complained reminded several times  30 minutes waiting drinks fiancé asked where drinks were  He wanted bottled corona but she didn't bottles  He said dos XX bottle would fine she continued pour draft  He said no bottle! She said fine take this  She terrible attitude    They took 50 cent sour creams off check hour late glass champagne comped dessert which actually tasted okay  Flan tasted cheesecake    Bathrooms GROSSS  Trash overflowing NO TOILET PAPER!!   Ps  Definitely worst place Vegas  can't believe Linq allowing horrible restaurant stay hotel! <EOR> I reserved restaurant company Christmas party 6 weeks advance  hostess toured upstairs private party room reserved room  35 people party  day before decided double check room confirm final attendance number   introduced manager proceeded tell could still come but would provide private dining area  She nerve tell owner reserved would ok seated Restaruant  No place musicians no private sound system she basically said bad deal it    Never again visit Restaruant  told entire company terrible experience manager moved party Giada's happily accepted us  <EOR> The Verde omlete probably best omlete ever had!  Huge chunks pork!!!  also took advantage bottomless mimosas!  bartender Corbin super friendly made sure glass always filled   definitely come back!!! <EOR> Chayo great food even BETTER service  server Christina hilarious attentive sweet  some margarita pitchers some delicious guacamole  ambiance great made even better amazing service  Vegas made better when your server your friend! Thanks Christina! <EOR> Chad very pleasant waiter checked periodically everything needed   ordered much food chips salsa guacamole pork rhinds pomegranate seeds top steak fajitas cactus pieces found mix came sizzling piece corn cob enjoyment! tortilla soup  just so weird flavor small portion definitely worth $8!  Overall food good but bit overpriced but hey Vegas right?!   <EOR> I really wanted place  basic Mexican food guacamole carne asada tacos  Both largely under portioned extremely over priced  honest don't care much price long getting quality food  Roberto's taco shops serves better carne asada tacos only when drunk hungover! server friendly location good decor okay  rooftop patio but until better quality food lower prices won't back  matter time before place shuts down  Hopefully next year new restaurant good food! <EOR> Eddie server he excellent  apps shrimp Ceviche Guacamole chips  Tried 3 margaritas Chayo cucumber pineapple habanero  Thanks Eddie! <EOR> Terrible service!!!  Ordered $18 bacon cheeseburger only no bacon cheese!!!  Seriously?!   only did wait half hour food wasn't ordered it   annoyed place! coming again  <EOR> We only tequila beer can't comment food  am really just writing review bartender Leah   two nights row seeing concert Brooklyn Bowl   Leah AMAZING!  She hardest working bartenders ever seen   She made experience quite enjoyable  <EOR> So getting ready next trip vegas still haven't heard back management email sent them  apparent don't care customer service  travel lot bring friends really creatures habit unfortunate put place never again list  <EOR> Dissapointing service  Server inattentive  Asked if everything ok far      hadn't even taken order  Skinny magarita disgustingly sweet  <EOR> I could see why anyone would eat here  service awful manager offered nothing when things wrong  friendly bar drinks refilled because waiter nowhere found  When service bad no accountability never mean never come back!!!!! Places business then wonder why? Great location lots foot traffic decent food but worst mean worst service manager  <EOR> Made reservation Opentable but when checked host stand said nothing group but sat right away  place extremely slow service  waitress disappeared long periods time sat empty glass  Table ordered second round drinks before entrees came all finished plates before drinks  Food okay nothing impressive  <EOR> I thought food very good service bad but outstanding either  waited while longer should seated before anyone approached then waited bit longer ordered first round drink but things fine waiter point on     I ordered shreded pork enchilads fantastic  smothered cheese sauce some places just enough sauce cheese overpower all other flavors going on  ordered guacamole some queso fundido appetizers  guac very good nice amount spice pomegranate seeds made different unique taste  queso fundido ok much better    All all good experience would definately return recommend friend  <EOR> Bad food even worse service  Waiter very condescending tone when asked chips salsa  He said several times No strip when asked specials  Ok but all asked specials   Never came back table refill waters either  Black beans tasted just came rice very chemical type aftertaste  least Ahi goodish  Fly far far away happy hour Border Grill great specials strip    lol across street  <EOR> Christina best waitress Vegas  first time staying mom starving  saw Chayo looked awesome came in  seated Christina's section she friendly right off made feel very welcome took care brightest smile  Please don't let unrecognized! <EOR> Chef Melissa crew did wonderful job meal! Looking forward enjoying meal again sometime  <EOR> The food just ok but service absolutely horrible  never back  seriously joke because usually count having pretty good dining experiences strip  place does even come close nearby restaurants  just slightly above taco bell quality mexican food  ordered nachos weren't awful but very good  If want good nachos Guy Fieri's ! Then chicken tortilla soup    likr campbell's tomato soup chicken ans then some tasty cheese tortilla strips  chopped salad    pretty tasty but nothing crazy good  Roasted corn enchiladas inedible  Refried black beans delicious give them that  husband chicken tacos said okay  Service terrible    other taking order didn't see all  saw ask if she could bring another round drinks  She did but seemed really bothering asking  still tipped 20% because used work tips hard    but seriously if tipped based service just percentage she would made anything off table  <EOR> It bad enough really mediocre food but your best gift CNF Charge Concession Franchise Fee bill?  pretty sad  <EOR> I loved place  waiter food  awesome  Fajita steak nachos shared boyfriend  steak very tender dry all  Would definitely come back next time im vegas!!! <EOR> Ask Randy Christina!!

It almost dive bar feel very small enclosure but being NFL Sunday did seem house quite mass people  Atmosphere wise certainly popping but draw back street performers right flamingo charging pictures parrot  Can't say hearing those things squawk through entire meal feel high roller!  Foodwise sold lobster tacos  They came quantity 3 more towards street taco size but did find them well worth it  The lobster itself came battered fried which oddly enough worked tortilla itself did light feel wasn't left heavy meal concluded  Our server seemed bit off though liners met crickets he didn't take kindly wanting try specials night  He wasn't quite joking self when passed ordering highly recommended chicken steak burrito  It almost if abusive relationship allowed order myself when came down it   Overall look past weird waiter just say would give another mexican craving walking around Linq  Maybe next time drive take alky review well! <EOR> I almost feel bad giving place star because service good manager really nice but even can't overcome bad food was  fiance cheese quesadilla chicken which almost no cheese grilled shrimp burrito barely edible  shrimp mushy hard tell apart rice  picked shrimp fork literally fell apart landed plate  Food really bland overpriced  margaritas good but $15 might well spend $36 huge margarita Guy Fieri's less block away  way better and serves 3 4 people   honestly better Mexican food El Torito  If you're looking good Mexican skip place  worth it  <EOR> Christina amazing server!!

The chips salsa very good  salsa thick spiced just right! <EOR> Restaurant Linq hotel   starving needed food quick   service good first round drinks mojito margarita great   But second round seemed really sweet little alcohol   being said food pretty good   salmon tacos recommended highly server best grilled salmon entree being ok   only complaint would number flies   sure but annoying hour  <EOR> The food decent  asked lobster tacos grilled came over cooked fried which wasn't happy but when you've drinking all day being upset sending back wasn't option anymore  ate still unpleased but thankfully friends ordered steak tacos happy that    The carne asada peppered steak cheese super yum  end result stomach full able in    I also came next day ordered 2 1 happy hour special super crunk!

Looking forward trying taco Tuesday's waiter recommended! <EOR> We just past Sunday lunch first time   Looks very appealing outside   loved decor atmosphere but food bland   husband pork enchiladas wasn't much far taste presentation   step daughter nachos ok   Mexican Mojito wasn't good worth $14!! Service good  <EOR> My wife visited Las Vegas last week final day city quick dinner here   positive side food delicious!  enchiladas wife chicken tacos   Having said honest say portions quite small given prices   The service left something desired   When server's attention he great   But during visit spent long periods time no sight three occasions ask other servers basic things cutlery eight minutes food arrived   Not sure if because lack service but server did comp two helpings chips salsa ordered  <EOR> Really bad service great food  Pretty much ignored bar area order drinks   Ordered queso which ok little runny taquitos which little mini fried tortilla shells barely any meat toppings enchiladas tasteless barely there   atmosphere great DJ playing songs but just worth money time spent there   Just bummer such cool place  <EOR> Came late Saturday night  already Linq Promenade meeting some town friends family members  all agreement just stay Linq since mood drive elsewhere  just wanted find  place few drinks party little since birthday girl group  recommended Chayo since don't San Diego everyone already familiar Yard House  Good point  trying new places   The food ok but great  job if hungry but best tasting worse Mexican food ever had  ordered steak quesadilla beans n rice chicken nachos  Huge servings  Enough food 3 4 people share nachos  chicken bit dry though  Overall food 6 scale 1 10  Just ok   nothing special   The margaritas other hand way sweet liking  ordered pitcher 4 sips sugar buzz kicked in  No bueno!! added much orange juice mix where margarita orange hue instead green hue limes  good $32 price! Minus two stars!!!

Don't expect really good Mexican food either  Food just   ok  <EOR> Christina made day amazing  We ended having absolute WORST experience Guy Fieri's place  smile professional service totally turned experience around   Food great! Would definitely recommend place anyone visiting! <EOR> We ended going twice during stay Vegas   The seating biggest problem both times  Although many tables free wait because communication needs lot improvement between waiters waitresses hosts    The food though very good  Both times   We cobb salad chicken mole steak burrito all delish!   What did understand first time chips salsa complimentary the second time order them    Anyway also raspberry margarita which very tasty    If don't mind lil confused service won't wrong one  <EOR> While hanging Flamingo all weekend convention ventured found Chayo  Awesome atmosphere really nice employees  tad pricey but strip expect that  ordered two apps chorizo queso chips quesadilla   Ordered everything only no veggies quesadilla add protein case chicken   It little wait but server checking me  When food retreated back area dismayed just cheese quesadilla    no chicken  specifcally needed protein big disappointment   The food itself pretty tasty nice crunch quesadilla silky yummy queso  Next time I'd try other menu items just apps  <EOR> Chayo now favorite places Vegas   We stopped Saturday night last hurrah Vegas  friends walked night before search food said looked lot fun decided give try   The place two stories small space bar bathrooms upstairs   But downstairs where fun at   We around 11p still serving food which nice   We didn't any food just ended ordering some drinks bar   The bar doesn't overly crowded which nice drinks fairly priced   There mechanical rooster smack dab middle floor  Yeah read right  2 friends nothing but pure entertainment watching everyone else give go   Music perfect there's outdoor patio doors stay open there's nice break heat every now then    Definitely would return  <EOR> This place upbeat lively  Came Saturday night approximately 11pm  first little slow but quickly picked more people entering venue   They mechanical bull center restaurant which people ride $10   Cheats good extremely cheap  bought Michelada margarita $18  price great quality amazing  They also serve food here  music fun! would definitely recommend place   No dress code  But shoes shirt  <EOR> Had great service waitress Christina  She very kind provided great service making time much more special  Thank Christina!! <EOR> Tasty chips salsa   ended there   steak fajitas overdone chewy rubber   Service nice but don't food <EOR> 3 28 15 1am Good food!

Per reviews most people recommended lobster tacos but truly weren't good  tacos very small nothing extraordinary  drinks good but bit overpriced service well service terrible  restaurant enough staff take care everyone but employees just talking each other! restaurant nice decor great location but would recommend it <EOR> Christina R  AWESOME she noticed seated 15min without service came right over take care us she friendly knowledgeable cool all around  Loved dining Chayo but felt home because her! <EOR> Can't split service food gets lower two  Tacos bleh beans can  <EOR> Ricky Ricardo waiter bomb very attentive  ordered pitcher blood orange margarita but no sent back   golden margarita patron bomb little more expensive but worth it   Now let's talk tacos shrimp steak chicken nasty don't bother pork picked over mahi mahi kind into whole corn taco thing could done without   sent pork tacos back being satisfied rest  but chef said didn't try them he couldn't take them    The atmosphere nice quiet little dark    That cock rode hilarious never done before very good experience   Holding dear life!

Thinking getting juicy plate fajitas skirt steak melts your mouth but childish dream when real thing came out  fajitas absolutely bland having absolute no taste them skirt steak incredibly dry no flavor  Chewing t shirt would've easier disappointed tastebuds teeth  flavor much potential but chef lacks vision  Such travesty very very fantastic location  place remains opens seems but many mysteries world exist  best bet alcohol rooftop bar keeps them open  food ? Perhaps mistaken when food meant served humans maybe next time bring dog eat when want take out  But then again means she being punished  Awful <EOR> This most bland tasteless way over priced Mexican food recent memory   girl mood Mexican while reservations place agreed give try   Oaxacan  chopped salad while presented nicely visual appeal good got    still trying figure could many ingredients lack any taste   Even grilled chicken bland   even slightest hint salt pepper  enchiladas basically tacos drenched red sauce  drinks good if primarily come would few rounds while watching people take turns mechanical bull would likely rated place higher  But didn't won't   Drink but eat elsewhere <EOR> Christina AWESOME!!!! She probably most attentive server ever had  She knew menu completely accommodated gluten allergy  wait come back  Bonus    food AWESOME! nachos carnitas die for  <EOR> Christina amazing definitely coming back asking her  personality really stands n very attentive she's far BEST servers ever had  <EOR> We stayed Linq naturally came looking food hotel  place disappointment  chicken burrito  stuffed shredded chicken but much couldn't enjoy other ingredients  meat also no taste  wasn't seasoned well all Mexican restaurant  disappointing  boyfriend enchiladas same problem  Solution less unseasoned meat more fresh ingredients  <EOR> Stopped couple times when walking hotel just drinks  Did eat   Menu looks pretty $$  Good mojitos but again pretty $$ but location it  <EOR> SLOWEST SERVICE EVER!  Ok giving 3 stars because atmosphere fun food ordered good rooster ride free but honestly waited everything long workers around   We around midnight some drinks bar app see if could drink courage ride rooster    I ordered blue moon $6 friends peach margarita $14  also ordered round tequila shots  Apparently house tequila $13 Sauza $10 NO THANKS! house tequila saved hangover   They brought drinks waiting while never brought any salt! waited someone come over but no came eventually walked bar asked bartender if could salt shaker   We also ordered chips salsa $3 queso dip which $12 14 can't remember  chips came server said he sorry supposed come sooner but waited another 5 7 minutes queso dip  point nearly 25 minutes    We ended riding rooster which fun! If you've ever wanted ride bull but didnt courage front large crowd place come Saturday night  weren't many people around everyone having fun   If service wasn't terrible maybe would come back try dinner  <EOR> Food ok but service mediocre staff tries rush door   Music way loud play electronic dance music    definitely first Mexican restaurant   server didn't add TR points being asked twice  <EOR> This place terrible food service ambiance  Fail ALL around!  We came 10 PM Saturday club restaurant which fine  But people dining everywhere no dancing random women jumping cow thing shaken around thrown off  Still fine  open menus order drinks  waiter trots off comes back tell he doesn't any drinks two red wines ordered stock beer  OK red wine have? Ummm  don't know  He trots off again comes back tell he pinot grigio  RED WINE  Oh ok he trots off again tells some SMH   Ok fine whatever  We'll take it  Then he disappears 20 minutes there's waiters EVERYWHERE but no take order bring drinks  FINALLY waiter comes back takes order also ask drinks oh he forgot  30 minutes later food comes flavorless kind gross  Queso Fundido used wrong kind cheese I think used Mozzarella thin more soup dip just cheese   milk think  very tasty  tacos basic impressive friend's expensive salad blah too   Get together  <EOR> The food great service great drinks great  only turn off security front having anti gay comments gay tourists walking by  gay client found offensive hear offensive jokes  would give 5 stars but security personnel comments left bitter taste experience  2016 there's much hatred going world hear types comments before getting seated unacceptable business Las Vegas  gay community over $800 billion market share time diversity come to Jesus meeting individuals making ignorant low class comments  Yelp app evaluate services evaluate prejudices against communities individuals  <EOR> Love Happy Hour   taco Tuesday half price tacos   tacos very good   Chips Salsa also very good   Fajitas worth price lot meat    day next changed menu raised prices   Would've liked see someone ride bucking rooster  <EOR> Well say   Having fun wedding same hotel restaurant  Bought drinks 10 people  then place buy food more drinks celebrate bride groom  Nope apparetly against rules   Can't brink drinks kicked out  Same hotel??? So if don't play rule somewhere else did  <EOR> Salsa wonderful!  But nothing else   Chicken enchiladas tasted stewed chicken sitting pot all day then put small floured tortillas added bland sauce  4 5 18 bucks?? The 3 crispy fish tacos over cooked no sauce them stale floured tortillas     We disappointed   Atmosphere nice  <EOR> Service great food wonderful! lobster tacos pleasant surprise chicken taco better expected! <EOR> I never heard place but meeting couple friends town convention  pork rinds no better those purchase  99 gas station Bombay Tonic tasted very watered down  music little crazy each song repeated 3 times row   ordered chicken fajitas corn tortillas wait several minutes everyone table received orders before remembered ordered corn instead flour tortillas  Once arrived surprised small were   impressed portions though   only able eat 2 before needed box server actually took plate back box brought bag   following day decided eat left overs realized stuffed corn tortillas into tiny circular dish all tore center no longer useful   also surprised find server only boxed approximately 1 4 plate to go box   think when someone pays entire meal cannot finish server should give all you  really impressed all  <EOR> Went breakfast Saturday  Someone group craving good breakfast burrito place right outside hotel  decided sit patio people watch seated right away but pretty early  line seated rest time there    Food okay service literally terrible  Two classic breakfast eggs bacon breakfast potatoes english muffin  Mine fine potatoes good  friends eggs literally undercooked gross she told server he just stood looked until she some new eggs or   ? He barely nodded then walked off  He came back when everyone basically done eating entire new plate breakfast which obviously just really unnecessary should taken less five minutes just new eggs bring them she could's finished meal everyone else instead just ending bunch wasted food    The breakfast burritos actually pretty good guacamole super good    The waiter just kind useless  water glasses empty most time really needed water mean come Saturday morning Vegas  He brought pitcher refilled water glass walked away leaving others empty before could say anything??

Christina amazing!! She welcoming remembered drinks  great experience! <EOR> I would love give place star but know fault currently live trump administration era where ignorant racist idiots flock groups 8 ruining peoples taco eating experience Mexican restaurant time  actually super impressed managers ability calmly remove them rather then forcefully kick them which sure whole restaurant would preferred! Any overheard    group 8 morons aggressively displeased sever 4 fingers instead 5! Because apparently gold standard severs ableist discriminative world 5 fingers  guess when requested 5 fingered server displeased managers decision kick them out? Rightfully so   then which idiots loud rude COMPLETELY ruined Fajitas now taste deplorable! bigots nerve say server belongs back mopping floors     which logic wouldn't sense because if he disabled serve food then he probably disabled mop floors? Right? don't know? ableist don't really understand! Any way margaritas delicious  <EOR> The highlight visit drinks   all very good however food service just meh   all some variation tacos all very dry   all need little more sauce drizzled each respective order   may want ask extra guacamole sour cream   would back margaritas guacamole but  it  <EOR> If want GOOD food LinQ Brooklyn Bowl    If want GOOD Mexican food great service patio    there's place Fashion Show Mall  awesome     or if  don't care much   Food okay    a lot filling portion size cheap ingredients onions the fajitas 40% onion cabbage the shrimp tacos 50% cabbage even though cabbage wasn't mentioned menu while sprinkle green onions was    The service     don't come if you're hungry   You'll wait Loong time   If your server gets your order wrong because music loud she can't understand your friends done eating time your meal arrives    only reason isn't 1 star because manager comped meal wrong     but still came fries instead rice  <EOR> We loved restaurant    Saul chef soon good  Some vegetarians  He specially came meet made veggie quesadillas us  <EOR> Holy cow service really slow here  Took forever find attentive waiter  all good when bull riding show available distract but other wait wait  Food okay but margaritas actually better decent   Giving two cause service important blown  <EOR> Good great margarita  Guacamole very fresh   Very friendly staff good service <EOR> Party twelve   Birthday party  Reservations days out   We its two separate tables    birthday party adult table child table  Takes peeps while there  Once everyone gets place order all same time  food comes three plates time over hour half period  Food Mexican even little  Food basic AF  No spice no flavor kinda cold  food all WAY expensive all LEAST $18 plate  furniture blocky quite uncomfortable menus looked NEVER wiped down short lives  Never sorry waiter but did several acting manager whoever is      After all ridiculousness 50% off bill some didn't even food  BTW chips salsa included w your meal  WASTE your money place  wanted Yardhouse but don't reservations 5  Terrible mistake Chayo's  <EOR> Meh  experienced better  definitely right way put it  Came cousins happy hour which actually decent  Decor atmosphere nice but food prices isn't going keep going here  Way overpriced pay especially entrees tapas  <EOR> Great service  James hit all marks waiter should  best items tried soup day  cilantro cream  and chorizo sopes   cocktails very tasty but very small price  Also  what heck going  drinking  water? tasted chemicals  All all very nice light meal  I'd Def back try dinner  Ask James  <EOR> After attending Rise Lantern Festival boyfriend decided walk around strip little hungry  came across restaurant seated quickly  seated outside server came table pretty fast  He very polite very attentive  atmosphere pretty chill mechanical bull night am sure if always but funny watching people ride it  wasn't packed all arrived around 11pm  only thing okay? dance floor empty yet music REALLY loud  eventually lowered music  food good  little pricey but its Vegas everything pricey lol <EOR> I really surprised food place! Ordered chicken tacos amazing  service good  <EOR> My wife celebrate two year wedding anniversary  course expecting awesome experience such special occasion but unfortunately thoroughly disappointed!  Upon first entering restaurant pleasantly surprised modern decor atmosphere  hostesses nice seated promptly  waiter table immediately asked if interested drinks wife needed few minute look over drink options waiter did any recommendations  asked kind beers available he stated Dos Equis Amber Lager Lite wasn't unaware Dos Equis Lite version thinking something new ordered more later    The waiter returned shortly drinks chips salsa which okay laminated menus    yes cheap one sided laminated menus restaurant charges $25+ per entree  menu did many items expected descriptions each item extremely vague  decided start chorizo sopes Mexican street corn  Both items brought table 5 minutes both actually pretty tasty but mind blowing  Now back Dos Equis Lite actually given Lager when informed waiter ordered Lite he said Lager lite  WTF right?  Shortly appetizers delivered waiter returned entree order  He didn't seem know much items no recommendations  ordered chicken torta wife ordered beef filet fajitas  There's item called Yucca fries when asked waiter those he said think they're sweet potato fries  decided order those well   The entrees didn't take long come out taking first bites wife wished never come out  chicken torta consisted flavorless chicken avocados way much black bean paste served spinach side    just plain spinach drizzle some unidentifiable substance which wasn't sure if supposed put torta eat salad  wife's fajitas equally flavorless beef extremely chewy  fact if such thing negative flavor dishes would qualify  Oh Yucca fries which waiter thought sweet potato fries just regular steak fries also no flavor   The waiter came ask food tasted let know thought food flavorless which something never done but food bad felt compelled so  asked if he could bring some hot sauce something add some flavor even salt pepper would've improved dishes! He stated all Tabasco  Now supposed Mexican restaurant which means should its own house hot sauce least Cholula Tapatio but nope just Tabasco   Apparently displeasure upset waiter he rude remainder dinner fault food bad! promptly asked overpriced bill left absolutely no tip also something never done   I highly recommend NO SHOULD EAT HERE! honestly would've rather eaten Chevy's  <EOR> This restaurant all potential being great place spend some time enjoying promenade Linq getting bite eat  space open high ceilings plenty high top bar tables people watch  food decent good presentation well  Where really need improve area customer service attentiveness  three separate trips Las Vegas stopped because its great location its inviting look  Each time however service remains same  Once gotten seated friendly hostess wait upwards 15 minutes someone even offer drink acknowledge presence  talking packed restaurant situation either  Maybe 10 15 tables guessing 75   The servers unfailingly apologize long wait friendly when show which definite plus but guessing little time management training someone lead example  food takes little longer your typical Mexican restaurant but tastes good no worries there  Try your check 15 minutes before want won't frustrated having wait someone collect bring back  All all decent food less stellar waitstaff  Would back armed knowledge all this? Probably <EOR> Appetizers good tried queso fundido sopitos empanadas  Sopitos empanadas come three per order  main courses where bit miss nothing really special here  wife send back ceviche because salty which gladly remade  ordered diablo shrimp which spices but much else it   My kids tacos de Asada chicken burrito enjoyed them both  least didn't hear any complaints   The location nice service prompt sever Armando very courteous welcoming   I felt meals bit pricey side maybe good place drinks appetizers  <EOR> Currently seated service far terrible  Waited 10 minutes being seated just drink order  Waited another 10 minutes food order taken  ordered chips salsa few chips top big pieces rest crumbs  flag down server better chips since complimentary wanted decent chips money not complimentary no biggie but crumbs when paying them okay    Okay finished eating   The food just okay  Nothing write home about  dad thought carne asada dry  moms vegetables grilled sautéed she ordered  dad thought beans watery however bf enjoyed them  ordered Sprite half through meal flat    Service never any better throughout meal  server never checked us  ran water no ever came offer refill even noticed low out  attention  Overall would come back here  service itself ruined meal food good enough bring back   Update haven't received check done eating 15 minutes now just sitting waterless he still stopped table  <EOR> Our waiter training new guy which normally fine   but service completely horrible! Sat 15 minutes just waiting water take drink order which took another 10 drinks  Food average nothing spectacular  Fell screwed waiter   hopefully better servers then had! <EOR> I highly recommend trying place happy hour believe hours 3 6pm  only upstairs patio area $1 Coronitas $5 Margaritas  arrived only 20 min happy hour left place packed expecting drink special most  Luckily found seats right bar Cami help us  She awesome! best bartenders help strip  able order plenty drinks food within remaining happy hour time  definitely returning during next Vegas trip! Service atmosphere drinks all A+ !! can't prices  <EOR> Second time good first! Stopped late dinner wife decided Nachos  server Bryan awesome enough tell HUGE was  sampler instead happy choice    Great food atmosphere  only downside MGM property  Otherwise great place  <EOR> If possible give 0 stars would    Our waiter absolutely condescending entire time  Every response came exaggerated smile  Also don't tell you're busy when ask service  Screw Peter    We ordered 5 margaritas  No table swallowed first sip  Pre mixed Splenda soaked fake lime tequila juice something expect Mexican kitchen  The queso fundido horrendous  threw block curdled cheese into mini cast iron pot  What??? mean tasted cheese wasn't nasty  But queso fundido  The rest food palpable but close memorable    Sean manager poorly handled concerns  Also don't stuff your face cupcakes your makeshift banquet area  classy    Eric runner amazing  If $100 bill I'd slip pocket  only person hustling entire time  He literally broke sweat while everyone else wading though molasses  Thank you're amazing! <EOR> Went Saturday  live DJ he playing good music  mojito good  Ordered lobster tacos  lobster meat kinda cold tough very salty   tortillas housed tacos cold strange gummy texture   rice Mexican rice but rather just plain steamed white rice which ok but strange  pinto beans meh   No chips salsa given but did see other tables don't know if waiter forgot if request   <EOR> I've eaten several times used fav spots promenade  However tonight's experience won't back  No smiles all hostesses  Between three them couldn't crack smile  wouldn't seat until half party even though said would seated begin ordering drinks  few minutes hostesses asked if would sit bar until seated  Sure said  bar maid came took order drinks  party showed neither drinks made yet she process making house margarita which took table  told order pina colada table  Then just south  waiter very unfriendly difficult understand because heavy accent  tried ordering pina colada he argued wasn't good drink should margarita  pina coladas many times enjoy them very much  He took everyone else drink order upselling everyone margaritas  table received all drinks except pina colada  buddy ordered margarita which turned awful  He sent back pina colada  still hadn't even gotten mine  told ladies worked she informed manager  manager tells waiter then some kind explanation why didn't drink flinging hands around  food 'ok' terribly overpriced which par course being strip  Then when check came he refused split three ways leaving figure add figure tax! Ridiculous! manager told situation he took check split three ways  no intention tipping because service just plain awful  But because party 8 added tip OVER 20 percent!  I can't recommend place anyone stay away! Save your money Denny's  greet smile over priced  Plus pleasure tipping some they're worth being charged service didn't receive  Chayo if your service good give your wait staff raise  Otherwise quit over charging your patrons especially locals already pay parking  won't back  Steer clear! <EOR> It really pains give Chayo 2 stars   last week Yelp Elite event all food great service incredible   walked last night ready give Chayo 5 stars   Based service quality food   I just couldn't it  I walked friend mine hostess table outside   where no also no sign indicating another hostess station   One servers noticed standing escorted hostess station where told would 15 minute wait   restaurant wasn't super busy few open tables  but some people reservations some people before time call arrival   However   the girl hostess station very unprofessional  My friend made comment told wouldn't problem table when called she said Well wouldn't say that  She took name said could wait bar   Her attitude  left much desired really put friend off lot   He extremely upset fact she rude   choice attire also very unprofessional   lets just say could see side tattoo could tell she feeling little chilly if catch drift    We sat bar good 5 minutes before bartender asked if needed anything    Shortly thereafter general manager Scott came over asked if waiting table    He very polite sure enough   we seated 5 minutes later   So whole reason came last night because saw website Taco Tuesday which half price tacos 2 1 margaritas   didn't end drinking last night because $14 2 drinks little spendy me   although if drinks made same last week worth it   We ordered chicken lobster ribeye tacos   3 each normally $12    I wouldn't order $12   come back Tuesday pay $6 them no problem but worth $12 3 smallish street tacos   *It should noted now asked if tacos come any avocado guacamole since am allergic   server James REALLY wonderful said no     The wait food bit long side   really impatient person but street tacos   the wait shouldn't long was   Presentation wise tacos looked wonderful   plates couple slices lime which thought nice touch   enough all three tacos    The lobster taco mayo sauce side my friend hates mayo     They good   lobster bites deep fried honestly pull little piece lobster away rest taco enjoy lobster taste but liked them   personally really liked mayo sauce   The ribeye taco Meh   first bite piece fat swing taco hit face   WAY fatty   second bite better but   meh   Probably wouldn't eat again  The chicken taco far favorite three   first taco full flavor really really tasty   second honestly little more bland chicken hadn't seasoned same way throughout     After finished those ordered carnitas tacos   Those took long time longer 3 tacos should have   These worst night   Number one   they avocado them listed menu  I also asked before Second friend squeezed taco 3 times plate fingers COVERED grease   Ew Ew Ew   No thank you   The good news only really stellar  part evening server James   First all weren't even section but he saw sitting asked if anyone taken care yet took table    He personable sang along songs playing made jokes us   and he removed carnitas off check no questions asked     I back give them another try   sure they're still growing opening stages going through some pains   really want place but last night made difficult  <EOR> One star pushing it  If easy into place there's probably reason  Food wasn't even mediocre  just bad  Service worse  If fail did reservation ahead wait 20 25 minutes experience  indigestion  <EOR> We came year ago May 2017 absolutely loved it! Shrimp tacos delish anyway don't anymore    Restaurant many open tables host wait 10 15 min   Chips salsa    just fresh all salsa tasted tomato pasta sauce   Appetizers plate waste !!!

Per quanto riguarda il cibo è buono anche se le patatine con salsa erano poco salate per miei gusti e non solo miei!!!! Il servizio è abbastanza lento   È la cameriera che ci ha servito mi stata abbastanza sui nervi perché ogni 2 minuti era chiederci se volevamo altro se andava tutto bene   Per carità cosa positiva ma troppo assillante!!! DATTI UNA CALMATAAAA!!! La presentazione del piatto è molto carina!! E ripeto si mangia bene e si spende il giusto!!! Noi ci siamo stati di mercoledì è quella sera il loro Margarita e tacos erano metà prezzo non se fosse il giorno abituale ma abbiamo avuto fortuna!!! Sicuramente se avete voglia di un tacos andate lì!!! Ma siate pazienti per quanto riguarda l'attesa del piatto e con camerieri che sono molto molto mooooolto presenti!!!! Ah se cenate qui conservate lo scontrino che il gioco sul toro gallo è gratis!!! <EOR> I wish liked something here    Actually beans really delicious  ordered chips salsa guac round drinks 4 orders tacos  first chips stale second few came guac really good but second set little stale too   drinks took forever came seconds before meal   food actually came pretty quick but messed orders tacos  refire actually took longer come then original meal  Everyone finished when new order tacos came out  salsa average best  ended eating any salsa hardly any stale chips  kind expected them comp something pretty bad experience but even charged $3 child salsa basically didn't even eat  Needless say all other options won't going back  Save your money Cabo Wabo Planet Hollywood instead <EOR> Went large party 30  able handle it  Service slow drinks poor food mediocre  Orders wrong some left without food hour more  top expensive  more food better time Fogo de Chao previous night less  <EOR> Closer 2 5 stars What really say Chayo? ok  Being border city living San Antonio really picky Mexican Tex Mex Mex Fusion cuisine  If service better would perfectly adequate  dinner colleague Monday evening  pretty hungry thought might good option   Our server seemed little came table few times without even taking drink orders  He instead waited until decided food order before accepting drink orders  ordered paloma  beverage choice anywhere claims tequila bar  Tequila favorite spirit such really expecting wowed semi overpriced cocktails  wasn't  only reason know tequila because menu said did  tequila cocktail want taste tequila judge strength but rather enjoy pairing flavors between agave bitter grapefruit tart lime  Unfortunately basically drinking glass watered down warm grapefruit juice  Yes dear reader served over ice but wasn't even cold  GROSS!
