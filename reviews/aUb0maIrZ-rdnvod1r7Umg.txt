Food awesome coworkers agree  <EOR> Got bacon crust pizza hot ready upon pick up  Ordered regular pepperoni couple days later again delivered promised  <EOR> There REASON WHY pizzas $5   All takes bite     But kinda agree other review   would great meal if homeless  <EOR> The customer portion location TINY  Perhaps 5 people fit before feels very cramped  small portable swamp cooler placed entrance keep getting warm which finger leaking dam   The cashier seemed aloof did pay much attention asking regards order  She would ask cooks where pizzas different combination toppings ours confusion  Then turned right around told pizza would ready shortly   Fortunately food came correctly which nervous about  tasted Little Ceasars pizza does  Nothing overly great but expensive meal two  <EOR>
