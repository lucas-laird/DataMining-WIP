I recommend signing Fin Addict rewards program earn points pre tax food drink !  All all highly recommend Sharky's Summerlin! <EOR> Sharky's new Woodfired Mexican Grill opened few months ago west Las Vegas  place great good clean food  use all fresh ingredients including organic local greens wild caught fish all natural beef chicken no antibiotics hormones  Non GMO corn oil  Organic beans rice quinoa tofu  Everything good really taste difference  only problem don't think lot people know place  Most people talk never heard them don't know there  Hopefully word gets busier soon  would shame if closed down due lack customers  Maybe few months heavy radio advertising would help spread word  Anyway food good healthy guys should try it!
