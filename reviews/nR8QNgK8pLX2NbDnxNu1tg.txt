I ate dinner recent trip LV  Peppercorn steak yukon mashed potatoes  steak cooked just right mashed potatoes incredibly tasty! <EOR> Okay if comped staying Sahara but would way again   Because some comps building used some them dinner here   Sahara most kept casino steakhouse reflects this     The waiting area small fountain high ceiling   room itself kind mid east decor okay looking but obviously dated   The greeter pleasant English accent seated minute wait during peak dining hour during week   service pretty good but restaurant less half full service could better     They bring bread basket only crusty sour dough rolls   Even Broiler Palace Station least 2 types bread   We both steaks large filet mignon 20 oz  ribeye   Both cooked precisely pretty good although could tell wet aged   Wet aged okay   Dry aged rules!  Her steak fairly tender but great flavor which typical filet mignons general   can't give take points away this   ribeye fairly good but outstanding   Marbling perhaps bit above average but prefer more char outside   Anyway addition steaks fingerling hash mushrooms creamed spinach   Mushrooms listed sauce but more side dish   creamed spinach worst ever any steakhouse   Bland plain   potato leek pancetta hash pretty good    Mushrooms split vote   thought came sweet but girlfriend thought exceptional value   $3 good sized helping included morels which normally quite expensive   If morel lover hate spending money them major steal   didn't think sauce tasted very good   We didn't any dessert coffee because wanted leave fairly quickly   atomosphere bad but nothing deliberately linger for   Without comps would eat again but once total gets big use them nothing gift shop elsewhere would Sahara   Maybe should concentrate play more instead rambling all over town  <EOR> The bartender Sahara recommended House Lords but buddy wanted eat Encore night instead very expensive average meal  buddy left next day l back myself next day  ordered prime rib far best l ever had  hope l back before Sahara closes take wife she let know if l ever come close perfection cooking Thanksgiving Christmas Primes Ribs  Oh way 16 oz cut more 22 oz best baked potato lve long time bill came 28 11  Thank bartender great recommendation  <EOR> DO HERE!
