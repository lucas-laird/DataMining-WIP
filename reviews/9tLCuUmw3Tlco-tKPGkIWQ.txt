She literally yelling point   said When picked rice fork look nothing but white clumpy  fried time she saw sitting almost hour teriyaki sauce soaked into rice turning brown  so understand confusion  but regardless certainly fried   She said Well then maybe wasn't mixed together enough but fried!!   Um? Fried rice starters FRIED brown color bits egg added  shouldn't white clumpy! shouldn't mix up!   Stunned angered attitude yelling finally enough abuse walked restaurant  never apology mistake given nothing but attitude problem offered both properly made bowls deserve  knew better insist them remaking them then no doubt would gotten spit food point   I would apology manager unbelievably rude customer service credit issued debit card both teriyaki bowls gift card equivalent 2 teriyaki bowls that use another TM location!   Regardless whether staff thought bowls made properly behavior exhibited absolutely unacceptable  politely requesting exchange  not even refund just exchange  and treated horribly  am happy edit review should appropriate action taken  Upon scrolling through other comments Yelp though seems am alone when comes poor customer service should hold breath  <EOR> Very clean new looking   Brown rice option no extra charge great option   Chicken breast bowl nice moist veggies stir fired lite teriyaki sauce but still crisp bite   Lots extra sauce each table   <EOR> After mattress shopping stopped Teriyaki madness lunch since area  first visit but menu pretty straight forward  Choose protein type rice if want vegetables it  ordered spicy chicken bowl white rice stir fried vegetables go  ladies took order nice food didnt take long  When home eat wasn't great wasn't bad  Just plain  chicken nice spiciness but nothing rave about  Meh  Ive better chicken teriyaki bowls other places but still game trying something else menu next time  <EOR> Delicious salmon bowl brown rice veggies  Super filling tasty!!

GOOD COUPONS    I haven't cared read other people think regarding Teriyaki Madness' prices  But take place cheap  seems everything additional dollar add making rice white brown chicken white brown simply adding vegetables  When am already paying 8 9 bucks tray food blame being hesitant add anything already expensive meal??  I complain prices all want but fact food itself mediocre  chicken katsu often dry teriyaki sauce tastes many BOTTLED teriyaki sauces someone else said teriyaki tasted Yoshida's CANNOT agree more!!   easily leave Teriyaki Madness paying 11 bucks single meal still somewhat hungry plate empty  Did mention macaroni salad NO flavor whatsoever??!! didn't think anything mayonnaise could bland!
