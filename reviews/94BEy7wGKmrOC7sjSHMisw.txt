Great selection flavored vodkas well <EOR> This review based handling private event  attended dinner seminar server very nice but service wise she failed tremendously  big group started gather around 530 because dinner supposed start 6  She took handful people's orders mine included before most group even showed those ordered soup salad already  made awkward while people starting arrive we're eating  Next she started take orders people but scattered because everyone sitting order even drink  Once presentation started entrees arrived before other people could put order in  Again awkward  Before presentation ended least 45 mins later rest most attendees order food  colleagues missed completely still ended getting order because forgot AGAIN  don't know place  server should alerted manager if she couldn't handle manager should made appearance midway sure all good  least peak sure all going well   Food wise ok  salmon mashed potatoes  side house salad presented very well  <EOR>
