stanchions just leave guaranteed 20 30 min wait don't utilize other register unless really want Barbacoa  queso only superior items over other build your own burrito mexican places   Run meat Chipotle across 215  Don't reward them bad practices note tell them nicely leave   I want say change management would improve place much which sad because think they're relatively nice people   Also please

no idea said but heard woman speak nearly 10 mins waiting phone order   time able observe environment   Your store beyond dirty even filthy kind word describe it   If she hadn't already rung card would just left   also never seems anyone over age 16 working no manager could find   finally receiving food getting home yet again disappointed  Pork salad barely above room temperature   odd taste couldn't pinpoint numerous romaine cores pick around   chips queso cold soggy   received side salsa fresca instead jalapeños   Due odd flavor salad didn't dare eat more few bites   You've made feel wasted money  <EOR> Worst cafe rio ever to  Consistently something  hasn't single time gone they've everything asked for  food quality good missing ingredients aside    The customer service also atrocious  first time attitude wrote off girl having bad day but consistently way   If another close house would never cafe rio  <EOR> I love love love steak tacos! mint limeade world good  eat few

understandable worked fast food service before  particular teenage boy cleaning around food looked didn't say anything but continued keep cleaning  stood 5 7 minutes before someone peeked behind door told help us  He stopped cleaning wash hands cracked joke them being closed already  Which made feel very uncomfortable unwelcome left without ordering  very rude unprofessional  shame because used

issues locations customer service charged items didn't order given difficult time orders made past employee haven't seen while    Poor customer service poorly prepared rush times  I made clear husband

spot  <EOR> 3 5 Star I'm usually huge fan mexican food chains but sweet pork delicious!  chicken enchilada sweet pork burrito 2 drinks which came roughly 20 dollars     The chicken rather dry nothing write home about   pork tender sweet   would definitely back that   big gripe Cafe Rio wall between CR staff way tall which ordering very difficult   Especially those vertically challenged =P <EOR> Waited 20 minutes line $12 salad  Staff unfriendly crying kids everywhere  NEvER again!!food mediocre worth money definitely  worth time  <EOR> This place gives BIG portions fill day if eat between lunch dinner    recommend Pork Barbacoa it sweet     use Coca Cola recipe salads wonderful creamy tomatillo dressing   husband loves enchilada style chicken burrito   may little pricier other burrito joints but healthier worth it! <EOR> Worst Café Rio planet slow service no drinks suck save your time money centennial Café Rio much better  <EOR> We several locations  food consistently good staff friendly  <EOR> Cafe Rio favorite food places but last few visits haven't impressed location  don't put much salads doesn't taste fresh  pretty nice customer service but food impressed with  <EOR>
