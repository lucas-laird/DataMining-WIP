Chicken teriyaki dinner good also dinner plate hibachi style veggies zucchini carrot onion asparagus  Chicken yum Hangar steak good asked medium rare came rare but quick fix fast delicious  Unexpected vinegar kind mignonette sauce but somehow wanted more did try some extra soy brought buttery taste steak which means probably needed more salt Overall its umami expecting being avid Japanese cuisine lover but definitely more authentic comparison average sushi place  FYI its Japanese restaurant  ayce sushi place  <EOR> I tried Umami daughter's since area great reviews   and rightfully so   few sushi rolls short ribs tempura udon   All excellent service great   back again tried few different rolls but ordered short ribs again!  impressed again even though ate just few days ago   Its nice upscale restaurant without any AYCE buts its worth every bit    <EOR> This place awesome!

I'd give ten stars if could  Every item menu tried beyond delicious  Chef Kim no longer but Chef Joon fantastic! <EOR> Living NW Las Vegas means when you're hungry taste buds saying Udon! Ramen  Bento  sushi  means 13 mile trip into Decatur  Jones  Spring Mountain Asian Food Triangle       chance wanted visit T Mobile store located Durango 215 exit     when pulled into parking slot noticed store almost front big sign reading UMAMI and means tasty good Japanese    they sidewalk billboard words All Eat Sushi    We looked menu included Bento Ramen Udon Teriyaki grilled  fish  Wow        we ordered spicy  tuna California Roll   and both tasted freshly made using good sushi  rice  wife ordered Tempura Udon ordered Tonkotsu Ramen     the udon tasted delicious ramen original unique establishment   and  tasty    come back place when don't want drive into town  Japanese food <EOR> Very good  little high priced considering few Sushi places all eat  all great but few exceptional lot cheaper this  Lobster Ramon excellent very spicy but good  Sushi Rolls great far ordered  Oysters very small small price  Sushi good but cold  Raw fish should cold room temperature  Staff great bus boys awesome  Hope share tips because really take good care you  ! Nice side town no doubt back  <EOR> Umami Jewel now every other mediocre sushi place disappointed new management ruined great experience behind host podium put Togo service station now clutters sushi bar  also crudely taped paper announcements walls  food used really good today terrible lunch Roll combo served salad iceberg lettuce couple pieces spinach julienne carrot squeeze dressing center coating piece lettuce saturated water  tempura greasy miso soup don't know more dish water! spicy tuna roll mushy sushi rice seasoned  When moved North West excited restaurant frequented often today last time! old menu well written thoughtful customer new menu just every other place around nothing special  <EOR> Finally tried Sushi joint still fairly new Centennial area  Prices portions weren't bad  Modern decor  Waiter great! couldn't give all 5 stars because could all eat sushi down street approximately same price give take few dollars  However ramen did try  would back try eventually  If don't eat enough sushi pay he all eat price  would definitely check place out  <EOR> There many Japanese cuisine NorthWest side Las Vegas close home  Great food service staff management very friendly  wished AYCE  But otherwise highly recommended place to! Try champagne cake dessert! <EOR> I'm sad give Umami low rating  reason because under new management pretty disappointed see entire new menu when walked in  boyfriend before management change absolutely loved when back already knew wanted only find those items no longer available  now all eat quality really gone down  If hadn't already ordered drinks would left based different menu is  very off putting same name but everything different  If never before give try since don't original compare to  say attentive making sure everyone taken care good! However if before management change highly disappointed  am sure see other reviews  don't see coming back  <EOR> Thrilled now Umami restaurant choice    We several times   Raman bowls which filling excellent   specialty roles well worth price fish always fresh   garlic edamame very good  it some kick   both cucumber salad house salad both great inexpensive price    They offer wide selection food choices including sushi regular dinner choices teriyaki choices ramen dishes   prices range low high depending dish    This fast food restaurant better dining  few BIG booths larger parties which nice if lot people share sushi dishes     I recommend restaurant service food consistently great  husband degrees culinary arts chef he's pretty picky   He applauds restaurant   try some more expensive sushi specialty dishes worth money  <EOR>
