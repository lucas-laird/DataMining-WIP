Main dishes arrived overcooked bloated noodles non authentic broth  Beef boullion acceptable substitute Vietnamese noodle soup broth  Further observation revealed blatant health code violations such servers going into kitchen preparing handling food without washing hands employees using fingers instead tissue wipe nose right before handle food! Lastly asking waiter relay message kitchen he admitted language barrier between front house staff kitchen crew don't even speak same language! <EOR> My first time probably last  excited come coz its near house just move vegas but am disappointed quality food service  serving postion totally different pictures menu  wayyyyyy less meat but lots broth   Yelp should start adding 1 star <EOR> After grocery run VONS   pretty hungry    decided try place out   Since its right next door   pleasantly surprised!
