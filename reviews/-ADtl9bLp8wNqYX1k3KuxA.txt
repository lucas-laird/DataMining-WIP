<EOR> Tonight tried Ichi third time   it last   trying open minded try different dishes see if would pick up   but tonight biggest fail   Creamy tonkatsu lacking flavor   additions sparse   chashu thin flavorless   broth bland   tried chicken broth last visit bit better miso tonkatsu creamy tonkatsu   Overall overpriced bland flavor unfulfilling meals   You're better off going Ramen Tatsu Monta others Chinatown area  <EOR> I always vegetarian ramen delicious! broth great flavor tempura vegetables give nice crunch  highly recommend place  <EOR> Pretty good!  Probably only Ramen shop 3 5 mile radius Centennial glad they're here  ramen delicious tell take pride broths  nice lunch combo which tried  Nice spicy tuna rolls  Tried octopus balls delicious!!! Chashu moist tasty though little skimpy portions   Food came fast  Service good friendly  dining room isn't very big 15 minute wait not bad during lunch rush Thursday    The only negative mochi ice cream  Something shells crumbly soft chewy   Frozen sure but maybe thawed it?  I'll back sure  <EOR> My hubby stopped feeling well because close home thought bowl ramen would good  wonderful experience  place very big might wait while but don't think disappointed  combo chose black garlic mushroom ramen salad ginger dressing which quite tasty well crunch roll  hubby salad fried rice combo  lot food ended taking half ramen crunch roll half fried rice home  prices reasonable your money's worth  Took son when he visited Christmas he said he really liked probably places he next time he visits  fairly new place but looks getting very popular  love place phone order pick quickly  Staff efficient very attentive never empty glass sure happy food order  <EOR> This definitely family favorite! 4 year old specifically asks noodle place every week! garlic noodles favorite!

While waiting observed almost every little thing  guest  waiting check bar area since waiting seated  Dirty dishes bar counter left nearly 25 mins Two servers served same table while three tables they've sat waiting serviced  3rd staff member arranging take orders  Why take care order other runs food other cashier orders  But instead two them doing same no took any orders  wonder if even noticed left  Even give water start while looked menu  Nope didn't happen    Ramen joints usually quick because several fast  Service top notch too  All broths toppings pretty much prepped  matter just putting together  need themselves organized situated gonna problem  all customers guests restaurant worker pretty much common sense provide service  all eat somewhere pretty much know what's expected  step step process  reviewers photos ramen sure looked good but sorry lost opportunity  all star no ZERO lol! <EOR> Ordered togo today  know just opened going give them chance hang things  ordered creamy tonkotsu ramen tempura veggies shrimp  super packed didn't  awhile  already ordered advance phone but did name number  caused confusion other orders ask other people orders were  picking noticed soup spilled all over bag car  soup container holes it! Thankfully some left eat  ramen broth very good BUT missing corn which listed part creamy tonkostu ramen  Corn favorite additions ramen upsetting  back sure since food good  They'll probably tighten soon     ** Update 10 16 17  Ate restaurant time  Good service great food! near closing time no long waits anything  Definitely new to! All ramen restaurants seem small  sure if supposed part ramen house experience what? lol Wish bigger  back sure  Love right down street me  <EOR> We brought girls lunch fabulous! small wait tell becoming very popular but completely worth it   Everything ordered extremely fresh flavors delicious  back try more <EOR> Great ramen noodle soup plus sushi dishes  Perfect cool winter's night! Excellent service  <EOR> We pretty excited Ramen restaurant Centennial area but left slightly disappointed  came  little dinner rush place still fairly packed  Waters came quickly but wave someone down take order sitting menus closed 10 minutes  server said he'd right back take orders when he brought water   Service Poor pretty much non existent taking initial order  No check ups anything waiting over 30 minutes food come out  water cup empty did bring water until food arrived  could've used refill during lull  servers don't specific sections receiving overlapping service   Food Ordered Agedashi Tofu bad  Instead traditional thin layer crispy starch deep fried tempura batter  ramen Miso Garlic Oil ramen decently portioned price  include half egg spice no additional charge  egg however seasoned just plain boiled    Overall Truly deserves two stars but nice since brand new still going through growing pains  We're still thankful Ramen shop near home back! <EOR> Let just say first time here  waited 45 minutes when server said 15 minutes tops  When sat down server very respectful nice recommended choices  reason am giving them star fact all food cold  ramen warm but people next steam coming ramen  Second popcorn shrimp more bread sauce no shrimp  place very inconsistent could 5 Star  really embarrassing recommended place friend happens ramen lover embarrassed inviting him  Another issue lack spice really anything flavor broth  <EOR> Excellent ramen Northwest  open almost year don't know why took long here  wasted year life  would given 5 Stars however little skimpy seafood meat  chicken karaage so  wife Tomato Seafood Ramen Taste excellent but only shrimp oyster  black garlic Ramen also fantastic but could used little more pork   come back again again  Oh service excellent well  <EOR> The food good  wait sit which fine small   But service sucks rush rude second time going  probably last other places go <EOR> Very family friendly although booths doesn't really accommodate more 4 table  Food amazing authentic! must those wanting something off beaten path Las Vegas! <EOR> Food service great could see staff worked well team    wish restaurant bigger but hopefully they'll stay close if find bigger place! Would completely recommend eating here! <EOR> Busy yes  Limited seating yes  Which could why appears busier alot more spacious there  many ramen houses only valley but ramen houses Japan   and honestly they've all pretty limited seating  Does suck having wait brrrr because verryy verrrry limited seating area waiting area? Yeah  When busy those waiting tend stand behind those seated bar  If eating people standing behind me   it'd ruin vibe real    None the less wait good 20mins before being seated thankfully bar  don't really recommend place if large group 7+ because your wait could even longer most likely you'll separated  think alleviate lobby should seriously consider beeper system people don't feel worry missing name being called    I appreciate fact when waiting area crowded hostess around asking if everyone's name jotted down jussst incase know  There's always person enters that'll just stand disoriented all busyness  Lol   Each visit stuck order crispy rice tuna black garlic ramen  first time crispy rice tuna crispy did break while picking chopstick  While bummed that   it still good point tis all mattered  Besides crispy rice merely texture  next time visited crispy rice point  tastebuds amused   If gah lic all   the black garlic ramen way go  delicious each visit ramen noodles cooked fantastically garlicky essence present annnd yet experience bland salty visit  Lol  broth came nice temp warm chest sniffle    It could easily 3 5 star experience many but 4 stars because going compare other places  ramen joint NW y'all  Appreciate because it'll save drive  area slowly but surely picking food vibe  Parking much easier alot other places staff busy but neglectful friendly    Keep stroller home parents  high chairs! Definitely recommend giving them shot especially if you're area  find worth try  appreciate fact prices doesn't seem inflated because its advantage being only ramen spot vicinity    Enjoy! <EOR> Absolutely delicious!
