You kidding! if Las Vegas needs any more contributions notable lack culture authenticity overall blandness  place touting new kind BBQ Las Vegas Style   Now if saying Vegas Style BBQ means nothing actually barbecued then Sassy Sal's accomplished great things  Now know sounding bit LV hater but not  just believe reputation Vegas cultural void need enhanced anymore  When walk into restaurant or outside matter smell any food cooking good sign  When walk into BBQ restaurant don't smell any food cooking more importantly any smoke other aromas define style definitely trouble  say again nothing Sassy Sal's actually barbecued  Let explain  ordered sampler Ribs Pulled Pork Brisket Hot Link 2 sides plus 1 4 chicken  Cost around $20  bad except $4 leg chicken thigh  watched cook pull some ribs hot link cooler put them grill  Then other meats re heated somehow probably microwave then sauce applied  NOTE Just putting BBQ sauce something does BBQ  all know many great styles Memphis Dry Rub use sauce all  ribs pork decent texture but obviously baked boiled first then heated back no rub no marinade other seasoning   brisket terrible  Dry almost jerky though jerky would much better no smoke ring no grill flavor any Texan would appalled   chicken never even saw grill Cajun style seemed boiled then broiled some pre mixed seasoning sprinkled top  give nod potato salad because used nice red potatoes fresh veg but quite salty unbalanced  staff friendly service quick  best items Hot Link Beans  However does take culinary genius buy some decent sausage open beans  way obviously canned beans only thing any smoky flavor whatsoever  Last but least 3 mini buns included sampler  figured hey  nice touch maybe some small dinner rolls slider buns use pork  TOOK HOT DOG BUN CUT INTO 3 PIECES! Now could but please if going promote something called BBQ then you'd better Barbecue something low slow smoky fast hot smoky don't care   If least could include flavor step such spice rub marinade maybe even some liquid smoke if to  Just give something pretend care  could show actually give damn offering  could help positively contribute local food culture instead robbing people experience all while arrogantly claiming creating Style   story on  Three Thumbs Down  <EOR> Sassy Sal's does some pretty darn good BBQ value price  sandwich side 6 bucks ain't bad economy  BBQ good combo sweet tangy leaning more towards sweet side  Psycho fries indeed inSANE! normally don't dig spicy food but all over these  Unfortunately also tend end all over me  coated two kinds sauce kinda messy    Two reasons why giving five stars number last time wait ungodly amount time food because someone messed fried pickles  which kinda so so anyway food still came hot thank goodness but awful long wait   The second reason because took tables  fiance used lunch he works nearby but now no place sit we'd eat car find some place ungodly hot outdoors eat  Bleh  <EOR> Am pleasantly surprised food really good!  far chicken wings lemon pepper wings awesome!!  Beef brisket nice tender flavorful   pork ribs okay   think if add more tasty BBQ sauce completely cover them I'd love them much more   just tried classic burger husband stole me   He loved flavor patty he didn't smother thing mayo mustard he does most burgers he tries   Am glad guys right down street where live   definitely coming back regular basis  <EOR> Tuesday Buck Rib day purchase medium 2 small sides  Limit 24 So decided give place try walking passed way favorite place Vegas   Retro Bakery   You know people always say really wanted place ?

Though Sassy Sal's everything fresh when order does take good while  order two took least 10 minutes arrive  Nothing cold all served nice hot fresh kitchen   I did deduct star slow service parmesan debacle  Regardless certainly stopping more next time am town  <EOR> I say hated EVERYTHING just ordered  am offended fact place eve DARES call itself bbq joint  potato salad filled UNCOOKED potatoes  COME ON! can't POTATO SALAD RIGHT??? Then give collard greens flavorless CRUNCHY??? supposed TENDER FLAVORFUL! Now spectacularly bland suburban dry touch called cornbread  UGH!
