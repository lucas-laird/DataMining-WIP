My family call Sunday's Best because we're almost church enjoying refreshing all natural boba tea   Red bean Taro Fresh Lychee Coconut Durian flavors fave  <EOR> It's 115 degrees F outside you've burn marks your butt sitting leather seat your car trying Chinatown through underpass fast can  There's traffic  Damn tourists everywhere! mutter underneath your breath  think waiting light change Paradise underneath monorail shade might just help    especially since your a c other day  But traffic pushes just barely shade into blazing noon sun  cry pain Dang sucks! keep saying dry heat   but still hurts  Solution? need cool refreshing fruit slushy boba    and need fast!  As far boba goes    I prefer mine fresh fruit  don't subscribe powdered mixes some people prefer b c find them far saccharine  Even other boba shops purport fresh fruit slushies far sweet tastes  If you're non descript unassuming little shop inside Chinatown Plaza mall just right 2 stores down entrance some absolute best fresh fruit slushies boba ever bay area NYC Houston elsewhere prolly near perfect 10 me!  The boba itself done right hard soft  comes bit warm all places which then melts fruit slush bit more    tempering sweetness even more  extensive menu choice fresh fruit mango watermelon etc  Just look side shelf you'll see all fresh fruit buy creations! even run seasonal specials look signs near counter  fave? watermelon boba  Otherwise kiwi honey dew melon close seconds!   This totally mom pop joint some bubble tea mecca Tea Planet just few doors down  much space sit in   but just order couple sit steps plaza near entrance cool off Las Vegas summer heat  or walk around peruse store next door some pretty kitschy stuff once saw belt buckle LV sign saying Welcome fabdau Las Vegas    awesome   I don't coffee black tea versions boba  I'd elsewhere TP seems best but thing better those other places cheap fresh fruit slushies aren't sweet  5 stars No  1 Boba ! They're fabdau ! <EOR> This place seriously best place boba  boba pearls always fresh warm prices cheaper compared other places  find place right inside chinatown mall  place  fairly small remember only two sets tables  But doesn't seem people hang around almost always table sit around at  Heck if just browse around other stores! Sitting's overrated anyway  xDD <EOR> the best BOBA town  they use fresh fruit all smoothies  the boba cooked perfectly soft hard spot on! and much either  the proportion drink boba exactly it   gotta say small mom pop joints still far better all franchises  <EOR> Having obsessed boba tea last month never ending quest try every boba tea joint Las Vegas lead here   Although place called Sesame House would never know it   Its inside Chinatown Plaza mall area where sign outside just saying No  1 Boba      I would say probably second best place next Tea Planet but prices better here   much atmosphere though   But fruit fresh quite selection dried fruits etc  <EOR>
