Disgusting abominations sugar top sugar dense bready thick dry stupidly huge called donuts    Husband downtown early sat some try since heard place being great sell   Yeah ok  All first timers tourists repeat customers I'd sure!  2 days later still sitting counter most untouched tried tasting few them      house full kids which teenage boy if tells anything! If won't eat KNOW bad! Lol!  The cream brûlée best seller!?! Ugh! disgusting  Tasteless hard coating topping sticks your teeth top basically bread literally teaspoon amount supposed Bavarian creme also made fresh definitely can   Ick! Every tried exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread dough  would compare very much French bread loaves Walmart $1 topped filled multiple variations whatever disgusting sugar concoction think of  Frosting any them nothing special entirely pointlessly overdone tastes store bought cake isle  Apple tart topped bacon dry as all them due bread dough use   sure world apple filling tasteless but did it! Dumped straight can  Super disappointed since looked most promising  pop tart one    Well still sitting untouched counter  Just grossly huge pop tart wrapped bread filled some sort sickly sweet jelly topped more sugar type topping  Oh! sprinkles! Puke! kids wouldn't even touch it   There also sponge bob decorated gross frosting 7 yr old didn't event attempt it   Basically clear object place things look interesting enough buy but absolutely no attention actual taste quality ingredients  Nothing even remotely tastes hand made fresh  Everything ingredients buy cake isle and bread isle grocery store yourself  Blagh!  Hey #donutbar   You stop saying #bestdonutsintheworld now please!

Coffee also really good  cute place breakfast date  P s  theres outside seating back  <EOR> This review Creme brûlée donut  Texture great   crisp caramelized sugar glaze creamy center  However taste very lacking  caramelized sugar tasted burnt slight bitterness it  donut itself creme barely any taste  wasn't sweet which bonus but wasn't ANYTHING  Im kind disappointed definitely better donuts cheaper prices  positive note very cute inside service great! Parking bit tricky  the parallel parking available near store all pay to park <EOR> So mother came down because heard doughnuts unfortunately wasn't super impressed  good just price gotten strawberry splits doughnut little hard top cream little stiff  also creme brulee which more expensive doughnut wasn't worth price  <EOR> Tried Donut Bar yesterday based reviews really disappointed  Paid $26 50 dozen donuts only nearby parking available pay park  few spots front store side no fee but no available spots  few donuts purchased tasted good but most them greasy tasted made day before  did purchase couple big donuts but really worth price  Should price dozen specialty add ons  Probably won't visit again much cost but quality  <EOR> How give place 3  1 2 star?

Very nice thoughtful  never donut place offer free kids donut  However say donuts little more expensive side but most bigger your average donut balances out    The Big Poppa Tart definitely big enough share  Strawberry one  made look oversized Pop tart  cool thing entire pop tart inside Big Poppa Tart  donut itself very good tender  also tasted amazing strawberry jam top  Now honest say didn't care much Pop tart inside  chewy little stale tasting far texture  didn't taste regular Pop Tart  guess something changes donut heated fried  Overall Big Poppa Tart pretty edges taste really good  husband ate entire half Big Poppa he never said thing Pop Tart guess didn't bother him  He just said he couldn't taste it  *Shrugs* guess more personal preference   The Strawberry Filled tasted pretty good  didn't taste because husband killed but overall good he said  He said honestly didn't taste anything special different any other Strawberry Filled Donut he had  say smaller donuts  If order circular shaped donut then bigger ones   I also didn't taste daughter's donut but husband did  He said tasted regular donut  guess she liked because she ate all  just donut shape candy cane white red glaze top    Overall Donut Bar cute fun! far taste don't think anything special  pretty average  say creativity donuts some flavors unique but other taste just any other donut shop  <EOR> While trying decide which many donuts would order some girl phone saying aren't regular donuts fancy ones'   pretty much sums up   donuts legit creations just glazed fruit loops sprinkled top   Some donuts pretty large pretty filling   don't call Big Poppa Tart no reason  <EOR> First timers Donut Bar tried creme brulee first time really good say best nights long time recommend place highly little busy but really good  <EOR> I love hate relationship Donut Bar  Unquestionably donuts good  worth $5 piece? Definitely not    Donut Bar excellent variety without doubt grade marketing  literally scrolling through Instagram see photo donuts instantly begin prioritizing need drive all way downtown pick French Toast donut    In comparison other donut shops throughout valley Donut Bar offers variety vegan donuts made order options some very creative choices such Big Poppa tart donut literally stuffed pop tart  quality arguable  Yes open super early obviously if later day won't fresh but hey if getting stale donut seems obscure pay $4 $5 it  Definitely think need price adjustment    Flavor 10 10  all times donut bar honestly say never loved taste any donuts  most favorite would strawberry shortcake Oreo birthday cake both absolutely delicious!   The employees also very kind very quick give recommendations  super early opening when just sold always experienced exceptional service    Overall Donut Bar great I'd just recommend early arrival preparation pay upwards $30 half dozen donuts  <EOR> The donuts just purchased The Best Door Opener business referral source   I'm bringing family well!
