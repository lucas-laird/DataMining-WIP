Don't wrong place nice but $170m nice  expecting club would raise bar all clubs Vegas but instead just seems cheap knockoff all other clubs here  Definitely doesn't same wow factor XS when first walk sound system doesn't even come close Marquee  Ya good dj lineup but most them already Vegas couple years nothing new innovative category either    also understand want look busy outside line really slow but waiting hour into club then realizing club practically empty once you're inside pretty disappointing    All all club isn't bad  well  Just fell kind short promoting before opened finished product turned into  <EOR> Went bachelorette party  music best ever  crowded VIP  would def next Vegas visit  <EOR> The worst club experience life  pay $50 only way see DJ table  basically stuck staring wall  All views stage reserved tables  bouncers incredibly rude  smallest water bottle you've ever seen $11  Additionally outdated club doesn't even outdoor area  Golden Nugget nightclubs  Outdated horrendous  Spend your money place actually worth AKA anywhere else Las Vegas  <EOR> I never give bad reviews but place deserves it  came 3 girls through guest list see tiesto  big Dj lot people come see but seriously needs max capacity  many drunks sweaty people touching packed sardines party there  Even when want leave can't  pack much don't even room move leave!!!

I lot  EDM music festivals am typically big clubber even through live major metropolitan area  However chance party Tiesto lured in  found whole vibe largely entitlement arrogance which very unlike any rave scene ever in    did converse some very nice people but few far between   The piece de resistance when hour getting groove minding own business     suddenly young lady next obviously rolling started jumping thrashing about  held bay trying squirm way safer spot when she suddenly came down forefoot full force stiletto heel  pain excruciating  tried confront tell happened but she just looked wild eyed slithered away   What followed escape attempt party through throngs people barely able stand almost tears  tried attention security please help but ignored  few minutes made tears limping  Thankfully no fractures but foot severely swollen bruised impacted ability job everyday activities  am those ugly post op boots couple weeks   I agree no could predicted responsible behavior young woman  However crowding dance floor degree just invites types incidents  Its common knowledge rave environment lot people prone doing molly coke other rave drugs  Therefore staff should prepared respond injuries when occur  shudder think outcome would if serious illness injury other need quickly evacuate    When arrived home Monday wrote long letter club management experience responded all  Guess shows much care   My advice if wear steel toed boots suit armor  better yet skip club save your $$ come join music festival where enjoy totally different experience without attitude  girls    those stilettos only extremely bad your feet ankles but dangerous weapons  <EOR> Always fun time Hakkasan love seeing Dada Life Calvin Harris Tiesto   But most all Dada favorite DJ's see Vegas  club lines bad through promoter  Drink prices high but expect its Vegas Baby   Cool couple bouncers always look out  know Steven works front stage always looks banana crew seems enjoy he does  <EOR> Shouldn't pay tap water  Any restaurant responsible giving water clients  Omnia better <EOR> Went Hakkisan because Omnia closed they're apparently owned same company  promoter list there  shocked read many people pay in!

OK! area packed bouncers try control many people dance floor  table service both areas  Overall first experience good would come back eventually  <EOR> First Vegas nightclub amazing experience!! girl free club vibes top notch <EOR> Hakkasan absolute favorite places Vegas  Great vibe good crowd nice staff  However your crowd control rules ridiculous  Calvin Harris if use restroom weren't allowed back lower levels  can't take away bathroom when people drinking expect everyone peachy keen  Build another bathroom downstairs those tables dance floor area use  rerouted your ramps downstairs access your preexisting bathrooms   Otherwise drinks priced fairly comparison other clubs  <EOR> I came new club expecting great things  greatly disappointed staff treatment  line hour wait guest list staff didn't know much information talking guests rudely  actually punched face accident staff member ignored kept moving pulled aside yelled staff hit accidentally appalled statement running into hand kept moving wanting any drama wanting leave soon possible   would recommend club anyone Marquee still best club Vegas  Don't waste your time Hakkasan  If could give place zero stars would  <EOR> Me 4 other friends came party Saturday night  $50 ladies $100 men Rip Off The club packed!! Crowded  can't even dance dance floor  People pours drinks top your head   crowded was! enjoy but hour decided leave   I understand Saturday night but should some kind maximum capacity persons only come good time  people keeps going everybody drunk pouring drinks each other stepping foot bumping grabbing everywhere  very cool   I definitely never back place  Id rather Marquee Club again  <EOR> This club okay  group came guest list didn't end waiting long helps all girls dance floor fairly small however  came Calvin Harris night  love Calvin! Anyways asked security guard around restroom no idea why ended outside club! LOL in clubs defense pretty drunk security guard didn't kick out  He pointed bathrooms least thought he did haha couldn't back in! wasn't mad though  bar across made friends! But just little heads everyone! Keep your eyes open restroom end outside!   However! did blast night! didn't realize club huge!! <EOR> This conference party review where conference rented whole club   First good   lounge two dancing areas one much larger other upstairs chilling area gazillion bars   afraid bars would backed all people but never did   never wait drink and open bar    amazing   The different areas made nice spread out   could find quieter place definitely quiet all relative other areas club talk dance wildly floor   saw people start dance lounge area too   lot but couple brave souls   The other great thing buffet here   When first conference buffet spread dance floor ton sitting areas   Even though didn't eat thought pretty cool     They also acrobat act dancers lights hula hoop artist   let dance elevated platforms   cautious person thought oh geez accident waiting happen but everything fine added fun     So bad crazy crowded main dance floor   able turn around crowded   might fault all wanting main dance floor but should regulated that   many people really enjoy dancing     I can't say know normal night but if having conference I'd definitely suggest renting place out  <EOR> I'm more 1 1 2 stars but being generous    As far Vegas clubs okay because most Vegas clubs lame   bathroom attendants wore suits which thought nice touch made seem little more market    It 'Very Vegas' terms lay out  part dance floor walk way around reserved tables similar strip club  women would dance high guys sitting reserved tables could watch  doesn't exactly scream classy bathroom attendants would imply    The main problem? bar tenders  only two each bar  wash't line drink but took forever served  Okay Hakkasan many people going spend $18 drink so understand understaffed bar but those SERVE THEM QUICKER!   Bottom line great club if most impressive part bathroom attendants attire  <EOR> I see Tiesto February 28 2015  line longest line ever seen into club thank god bought tickets advance because into club within 5 minutes  Tiesto incredible light show sounds confetti       Incredible  only reason club should 2 stars  dance floor surrounded vip booths security bouncers beyond rude impossible  dance floor  club over crowded bouncers don't want stand near vip guest  knocked around all over place until found little corner  only stayed because paid ticket online because Tiesto  amazing bu became unbearable  regret leaving before he left DJ booth but couldn't take any longer <EOR> Went club girls night  Bought tickets groupon expedited entry 1 free drink ticket each  friend having great time until nowhere bouncer came said leave  no reason literally standing spot doing anything wrong  sure if he mistaken party girls beside quite rowdy intoxicated but shocked appalled treatment received  tipped bartender well $20 drinks tipped lovely bathroom attendant service  would 5 star review until unnecessary removal  understand if rowdy unruly overly intoxicated but none these  would recommend place anyone  Save your cash find classy place good night  place overrated tell everyone know avoid it  hundreds better places won't leave no reason  <EOR> My girls came Friday night see Deadmau5  Thanks promoter relatively easy in  BUT once inside mess  started 5 flights stairs main floor once crowded could barely bar  Now cheap anything but jagger redbull cost $21!! Needless say would last drink  Because crowded lost 4 friends pretty quickly  Here's biggest gripe   stairs! stairs everywhere  can't even look people cause your eyes focused ground  saw couple guys trip them  next night XS my fav club vegas much better time  <EOR> This club blows getting some guest list promoter named Luis Moo stood line ever  having 3 girls no guys  Even tho suppose free ended even being able because line literally 10 minute walk through casino outside some sketchy alleyway    Felt super bad recommending sister birthday  Especially being first time clubbing visit vegas    If value your time want spend actually going clubbing don't bother setting VIP list  guest list VIP longer regular list  <EOR> This place awesome! met promoter casino hard rock hotel he free gave free drink tickets  venue beautiful music great  good mix male female dance floor  best nightclub far  Much better Marquee  <EOR> SO glad boyfriend Hakkasan  definitely experience never forget!  TIP find promoter guest list! used Chris Hornak  which amazing!  It VERY crowded  Even if guest list around 11 line over 30 minutes    Hakkasan hottest club right now strictly because amazing DJs Calvin Harris Tiesto Steve Aoki DJs don't come stage until around 1am usually   With being said its all EDM don't surprised if aren't hearing Top 40    As night gets more more crowded body body everyone but energy contagious! <EOR> Despite online instruction club opens 10 30 waited over 20 minutes doors open  Then waited another 15 minutes once inside  When inside no music    The line bunch riff raff    Hugely unimpressed Vegas club   <EOR> Do trust VIP host named Nate  He mislead lied me  friends planning going but when met Nate changed mind  Claimed he left phone somewhere blah blah then he said he way never showed returned text  man only good word word no good  Going blow money somewhere else  <EOR> Hakkassan over hyped! No space over crowded  no capacity limit awful place  Apparently only way good time pay thousands dollars bottle service people can't step you   Under Decorated no ambiance if any wouldn't notice because over crowded  You stepped pushed even kicked out  Yes group kicked pushing  Less 2 hours $200 00 dollars worth drinks later Just Husband's bill    Everyone pushing because no room even stand let alone walk by  didn't even chance see main DJ    Security garbage! roughed because weren't leaving fast enough  could we? couldn't even walk through over packed crowd  just kept shoving us  4'11 110 lbs  no need extra aggressive me  tears time all security did yell tell going    A guy outside club tried console me  Told every night open  randomly throw people pushing fighting bring new bodies in   Thank god decided against buying Wet Republic tickets  could see pool window sardines   Go OMNIA Caesar's Palace XS SURRENDER Wynn instead those clubs awesome worth price! <EOR> Went 21st night birthday following night  birthday night AWESOME  Would absolutely give night 5 stars! Bingo Players performed night although aren't popular some other DJs into Hakkasan still FUN  ambiance awesome Bingo Players put great show confetti smoke everything point beat    great    The second night AWFUL  Calvin Harris felt again!  Calvin great but OVER SELL TICKETS  all could dance could hardly walk felt could barely breathe!!!! NEVER such full club room general  AWFUL!!!!! wanted leave within 5 minutes  Also friends yet SINGLE drink told he could enter night because he looked intoxicated   He ENTIRELY sober  security guard some british guy talked rude too  OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE because thanks probably wont returning  <EOR> Saw Tiesto last night awesome time!  Hakkasan little bit larger average Vegas nightclub ambience par rest  lighting overall design all excellent  multiple bars multiple floors  DJ lineup never disappoints!! Tiesto began set around 1 30am opening DJ place going wild!  I'm definitely coming back Hakkasan during next Vegas trip  <EOR> Went hakkasan last night 10 2 15  able guest list no problem  But horrible inside  bar packed  Drink expensive only gave star because bartender made adios made very strong good  dance floor pack hell security kept telling people move stop blocking certain area   uhm where want people ?? Floors pack  whole place pretty much bottle service table but no them  upstairs empty but don't view bottom since they're all reserve bottle service  left 30 min  first time hakkasan    definitely last time    Heard club popping    turns its nightmare club Thursday night     can't imagine crazy Fridays Saturdays  beginning think all vegas nightclubs overrated expensive drinks pack dance floors  <EOR> We waited almost hour well its acceptable  But told fee $50 increased $70? Its fair but pretty sure waiting hour cant just leave it  Smart Strategy though  its super packed  did drink Had worse hangover day before even did want think it     Music great  course Calvin Harris  only because him  stuff rude Id may be  sure  <EOR> I came see Kaskade amazing  Yeah bit expensive  think $30 girls $50ish guys but  Vegas  guest list free    The club multiple floors which fun check change scenery when you've dancing while  rooms strictly hip hop  great hip hop edm available all same club  Great venue dancing  <EOR> My cousins birthday February 2014  All say its pretty big 5 Levels  just did place though its way crowded which know Las Vegas clubs cant crowded but place uncomfortable crowded second 5 levels very easy lose someone lastly its overrated    Overall wouldn't come Ill stick other clubs   Tip Ladies prepare walk LOT stairs!!!

Once inside over crowded despite fact several levels  pack many people place actually safety hazard very difficult navigate through explore different levels place  many stairs if tipsy slightly drunk could've easy broke ankle  elevator but waiting line all over again  dance floor SUPER PACKED  heard some horror stories dance floor being place where people stuff stolen   Steve Aoki guest DJ however never chance see because dance floor packed stand back  would recommend getting bottle service just because price drinks very expensive but Vegas did expect!!   I can't say place all bad  music surround system nice loud couldn't conversation  lasers really cool kind amazed lol  Everyone dressed really nice including myself lol really classy place  Next time Vegas try place again least know expect! <EOR> I wish zero stars option  place needs stop recruiting security guards flunked Police academy  only party treated disrespect  kept searching if trying find something  When didn't upset look someone stole candy  <EOR> This place pretty standard night club thought  some impressive pros some major NOs    First $110 male entry wtf? would pay that?

Yes read right  If you're dehydrated breathing all sweaty air $8 kids sized Fiji water    If mega clubs your thing you're willing deal hustle pay big money give shot  personally taking business elsewhere next time town  <EOR> I would given place 3 stars under normal situation but 3 5 girls phone stolen  While no fault Hakkasan just mood killer  Closed purses no match thieves girls beware  The club itself kind crazy shit show cannot walk around all freaking crowded  You'll dancing guys girls all kinda bc there's no space  club itself cool but just small <EOR> Shittiest club planet  Event though top vip list bouncers where worst   People dance 'floor don't event dance just stand trolls   absolutely hate club created biggest parties all over globe   Don't waste tour money  <EOR> This few clubs open Sundays!  Before night friends walking along Strip when promoter approached asked if wanted see DJ Fergie night! We said yes! awesome among Strip always multiple promoters promoting events    Because did pay cover   Well MGM bit process inside  first line where ask if guest list once confirm give ticket  Then different line where take ticket  Once through line through security    When inside through elevator club  true five floors but those 5 floors just five different floors where dance same music   I think great five different spaces dance because first floor get's extremely packed! The first floor very fun because everybody pretty pumped Sunday! The only downside does packed enough room dance    The music play ONLY EDM! If EDM enjoy club   Overall good time <EOR> EDM all night long  Told hip hop room would available yet closed night Saturday night   Booooooooo <EOR> Went Calvin Harris Jan 27th or weekend    caveat very very high expectations   hearing rumors place didnt really know expect outside if time life nothing but gorgeous women dancing best music best sound system   None delivered   won't much into crowd bit add perhaps im used homogeneity DC crowd   club expected insanely crowded much room enjoy yourself until much later night   That being said sound system first floor only insufficient but downright unpleasant   Maybe just Calvin Harris lack attention detail   The worst part MGM grand which now feels run down place many ways  <EOR> Was halloween back again any given time  Small crowded rude staff expensive drinks bad service say least  Charge $10 small bottle water where other clubs free water  Rip off taking advantage people trying good time  <EOR> Lots pros cons club   Pros beautiful club lots people Travis Scott performed free entry if guest list free drinks ladies until 1130pm  Cons extremely small dance floor amount people come same boring music played repeatedly Travis Scott 2am left before 230am I know beyond club's control but better music would compensated walk 4 flights stairs heels in  Overall good time but repeating same music boring just chilled outside while waiting TS perform  <EOR> We Thu night main club closed only Ling ling open which bit ghetto can't comment experience main club seen yet   We found pretty good deal website  bought $200 VIP card two guests which $200 drink credit  think pretty good deal considering fact Hakkassan elite night club  However bit careful  Bartenders kept saying card no money it  insisted inside said needed activate card  Really? Somehow felt bit fishy  <EOR> Not really favorite club bunch Vegas but bad   place small there's lot stairs  much Marquee but still lot girl 5 inch heels walking around   dance floor gets packed quick unless you're early   pretty much won't able see DJ very easily unless you're bottle service walkways  saw Tiesto pretty cool gave glow bracelets lit different colors music   all synchronized too!  When he played Red Lights all bracelets glowed red hue!  Haha pretty entertained   Aside having big name DJs probably wouldn't prefer come back since small dislike there's no outdoor area cool down take breather at  <EOR> The thing love Hakkasan very thoughtful table placement size   would say aren't many tables pinned awful space independent VIP host  important   client may doing low minimum satisfied table even though he's sitting dancefloor table because all tables great   rooms beautiful design top notch   personally love venue  <EOR> Be careful everyone around you  friend pick pocketed  Stolen wallet phone!! <EOR> Finally chance Hakkasan couple months ago nothing but amazing things say experience!  line outside seemed organized just lot upset people if didn't way VIP Bottle Service trying sneak bribe  right easy security then table service 5th floor  wanted main stage but seeing spot actually great location great view    I'll definitely returning thank Hakkasan staff making night great one!! <EOR> One female beautiful friends let no reason  From 1 2 friends 5 min purse stolen  Never seen such shitty club brainless bouncers <EOR> Worse nightclub ever  To many people inside friday night small hallways really nightmare   Inside looked more maze nightclub  would never place ever  <EOR> Nice ambience but overcrowded no where sit unless your vip oh mention $17 drinks lol! approached many club promoters strip ask your # text all club info such where meet  guest list  promoters all really nice work commission amount people bring but also skip 2hr line free  Which pretty great however walk club 5 inch heels 5 6 flights stairs! Could more but horrible!  No offered elevator course no where sit unless pay vip  Dance floor crowded music wasn't good  said house music but wasn't real chicago house euro dance  Drinks over priced which guess expected since strip <EOR> Small dance floor population control nearly nonexistent overpriced drinks bad song selection overall negative experience  Would recommend anyone even mortal enemies  <EOR> We paid two bottle table  seated 2nd floor  club nice music good well table service  would complaint beside horrible treated security guard accused throwing limes people  off balcony WTF? explained no clue he talking about  He basically called liar said arguing aggressively grabbed  arm pushed towards exit elevator  asked if cameras review he said did but he going off word someone else   really? Just point someone kick them just word guess roll   most ridiculous experience ever club especially paying table  Worst customer service security guard would back! <EOR> I've Xs Tryst Surrender Marquee club inside Eiffel Tower Paris most low quality club ever Las Vegas   try lack luster appearance spend all money DJ's none Decor  Garbage 100%  Want unforgettable night?

This circus circus Las Vegas clubs  <EOR> With amount marketing advertising put behind place think would some money hire better employees  many before mentioned treat cattle! waited line over 2 hours expectation would worth end  sadly mistaken  Even being guest list wait long time made club completely sober decided stay way price drink $20! security indoors pushy inconsiderate know don't greatest job dealing drunk people all night but still don't act killing so  left being club 30 minutes because lack space dance even move around both DJ rooms  Don't fall hype yourself favor choose different club <EOR> It gets 5 stars based just off bathroom attendants  good time all but bathrooms give 7 star service  Promote those men <EOR> First let's talk rude! Most bouncers rude  see Calvin Harris 26th July  guys group bought tickets guest list  showed 8 45 line until 12  when guys fed us  birthday boy then proceeded explain main security guy happened promoter ect ect  He wasn't having it  Finally he said if pay girls in  course all agreed window pay but already confirmed guest list little paper free    In club overcrowded  guy next group guys ended punching instead  Security never showed but did show hassle guys cigar but people next smoking weed received no such treatment  Finally! group next left only replaced couple no self respect! Kept putting faces each other's crotch  Once again security no where found Ultimately Calvin Harris amazing! beginning night though sucked! <EOR> Lotsa dislike club  thought awesome  Place packed bouncin some peeps may especially when u trying dance floor just bumpin into other people  But lights music atsmosphere great  Now dont know large groups reservation tables but close w promoter  <EOR> WAY EXPENSIVE  Unless you're VIP don't bother  Place WAY overcrowded    **Standard drinks available $14 pre tip!!! they're 10 oz mostly ice  RIPOFF!**  FOR GIRLS note **THERE ABSOLUTELY NO SITTING ALLOWED**   My girlfriend's feet hurt because shoes told security couldn't sit lean anywhere unless VIP      SUCH RIP OFF!

Why care if drink tap water bottle already paid for? layout completely wack  close off dance floor if gets crowded then people standing tables surrounding dance floor completely block everyone's view  no problem dance floor being closed off just where once closed? Everything tables everywhere  actually felt bad tables lined along dance floor though  view almost completely blocked people standing tables people between isles pillars supporting structure  sound also does carry very well tables back  warned those tables back dropped least $10 000 blocked view stage sound average best  tried see if could better view top floor but balcony lined tables well  end opened dance floor back Deadmau5 able down watch  Stairs ramps everywhere  saw 4 girls slip fall throughout night  Two them ramp going down dance floor other two slipped stairs but caught themselves before completely falling  careful girls   The Good The Talent  past 5 years seen Steve Aoki total 11 times  amazing watching music sets grow now  epic set he absolutely killed it  Deadmau5 also absolutely amazing  He played lot new chill tracks first hour  Then he put gold mousey helm started rockin old stuff  guys only reason there  The people everyone met really friendly dressed 9s 10s  The energy level crowd during Aoki's set  But any top clubs Vegas   Summary The amount money spent myself everyone around should more enough fix quality drinks lines attitudes people working there  100% management problems easily corrected  want Hakkasan enjoy idea there's upscale club favorite artists playing every weekend  But can't recommend anyone  think we'll wait while before returning   Side note saw Tito Ortiz there  checked Twitter account looks he shaft well table service  He waited hour charged 40% gratuity didn't let half crew in  If guy Tito gets bad service going get? http tinyurl com qgm5vn5 <EOR> Horrible experience here  I believe problem MGM managment or whoever manages both Hakkasan dayclub counterpart Wet Republic because friends Cinco De Mayo weekend Horrible experience Bouncers both clubs   Wet Republic Line girls we 8 girls guestlist over 2 hours  Line guys 3 guys bought presale tickets over 1 hour  Bouncer tried kick two girls line being 'drunk' when reality everybody f ing sobered then cus already line over 2 hours   Enough Wet Republic since review Hakkasan   Hakkasan WORST BOuncers EVER  To fair didnt even inside Hakkasan cant say club itself but REASON didnt cus doucehbag Bouncers  Generally unpleasant attitude unhelpful seem want just ruin your night primary goal   This douchebag bouncer would let girls group he thought 'fake ID'  retard clearly doesnt brain process images eyes seeing because she CLEARLY person ID licesnse Clearly FAKE she 26 years old weve vegas countless times no problems all    The guys guestlist yet STILL required pay $100!!!! just in  ARE U kidding presale tickets $75 u charge $100 GUESTLIST price?

No idea haven't eaten there  only plus Hakkasan multiple restrooms    <EOR> The hype place why came here  Even though am fan EDC music wish knew where hip hop room was   because walked all areas all trance music   ladies heels weren't fun walking down all those stairs     The line wasn't bad no need pay pre tickets if find promoter unless popular DJ celebrity  But line quickly just waiting elevator made line feel long    I would suggest buy drinks $15 per person all watered down   I think need same thing TGIF caught for   Not worth money  However if table then different story  service great   The club reminded Studio 54 really much changes  did outdoor area where standing tables talk relax maybe sit some rocks take off heels bit heal little excruciating pain blisters     I want thank group Rudy's let sit drink them! sweet let lot girls sit down when heels killing us  =] Much appreciated!

Especially if dancing crowded space need water  might just though way if water pricy already know drinks even more   Second which think most important tip    find yourself promoter  everywhere honestly hard find always looking people help visiting trying fun  girls you'll free pretty much anywhere  guys sometimes give discounted price depending if nice not  If then pay full price in  Although always bad thing because say your girlfriend least won't pay right? Lol   The hype club real in opinion multiple times always nothing but memorable nights  If you're contemplating club between another Vegas Hakkasan  <EOR> Hakkasan located inside MGM grand  GL GL line free before 1am hurry asses there! made free thank god! Anywayyys bouncers nice made transition inside club pretty smoothly  Once immediately noticed SMALL was  dancefloor tiny! When finally made way over could barely move dance  literally body body     day where there's NO famous dj ing! imagine bad crowd would if Tiesto Hardwell      wouldn't wanna there!   But  all really say because super messed can't remember anything else  Only couldn't dance all because no room parts where kinda open security made move <EOR> The Hakkasan SUCKS!!  dance floor ridiculously small  leave sore throat burning eyes because all cigarette smoke  wait bar 30 minutes very expensive drink   We Saturday see favorite dj Hardwell way absolutely amazing  Since couldn't dance floor dance way over priced bottle service booths  people paid booth arrived late didn't stay very long didn't even put dent bottle Grey Goose paid for  Anyways saw boyfriend dancing all night when leaving invited ourselves drinks vodka wouldn't waste  thanked them left  even 5 minutes later guy working booth came literally took drink hand told couldn't it  told people told finish good night  response don't care can't it  Totally rude unprofessional  much money paid should treated that   We never going greedy place again  only reason even gave them 2 stars because big name djs play there  <EOR> awww man packed sardines  first vegas club all  ive where crowded but just wayyy much packed especially big club is  lines long even being guestlist drinks man! paid $150 7 shots just well tequila  ohh burn throat worse wallet smh  <EOR> Ive share nightclubs vegas some good some bad but Hakkasan definitely good places go  place pretty popular if want no major issues suggest arriving midnight  friends past Friday see Dada Life line 30min going through guest list line  promoter Richie Laynes he definitely made sure would any issues door  Thanks Richie!  Once inside insane! said club popular once enter dont shocked if immediately jammed room full people wall wall trying move all different directions  some point even lost part group because 1st room enter Ling Ling Room some thought main room  Nope! main room more floor up  But once found all friends able way main room no problems   The dance floor packed balcony watch Dada Life  Best decision ever! Even though balcony area full people still room dance mingle  Getting drink bar wasnt bad however advised drink costs still $10 20 range    What really made good impression friends though Hakkasan staff specifically security staff  Ive nightclubs before where security staff thought best people Earth but Hakkasan security guards just regular people  opportunity talk few them night progressed cant say anything bad any them  Every security guard talked just some most genuinely nice individuals ever met and if you've ever vegas nightclub know quality hit miss pending location because there's lot fake people vegas   Elaine Codilla security staff thank making sure friends safe whole night taking time talk us!  In end recommend going Hakkasan least once while you're vegas  If anything just DJ lineup! Tiesto Dada Life Danny Avila Calvin Harris Fergie Nervo Moby Steve Aoki Hardwell?!

Heavy EDM scene nice light show  ended going because walking strip find abundance Hakkasan Omnia promoters  weekend both ladies gents zero dollar entrance  Since case took advantage lol few drinks later few walk arounds left  <EOR> So ever since hakkasan announced open anticipating being best club Vegas ever seen  finally made last Sunday say lived its expectations  host Ulysses excellent reason whole night amazing  treated VIP's beginning until   club closed which girls didn't like   Everyone group agrees back very soon  Only gripe kind dead but other excellent  <EOR> Hakkasan far best club restaurant Vegas   I four days partied twice   exceptional service food drinks  Mike Tran VIP host point all times super helpful  I'll never stay anywhere else!!! <EOR> This club awful  set 21st birthday  He set light night before amazing  even comparable light  never back never recommend it  Before experience MGM favorite hotel say changed opinion entire hotel  <EOR> Amazing!!

Der Klub ist maßlos überfüllt! Wir konnten uns nicht bewegen und standen nicht einmal auf der Tanzfläche  Etwas dieser Richtung habe ich noch nie erlebt! Um 24 30 Uhr haben die Türsteher die Tanzfläche abgesperrte und es war nicht mehr möglich auf die Tanzfläche zukommen selbst wenn es noch platz gehabt hätte  Der service der Bar war einfach unter aller Sau! 3 Heineken kosten $46 und man muss froh sein wenn man bestellen kann  Der Klub hat sehr viele Stufen und ist meiner Meinung nacht nicht sehr übersichtlich  Zum teil sahen wir nicht einmal den DJ  Frauen aufgepasst mit High Heels! Das Personal behandelt einem wie ein stück Sch**** die Türsteher waren sehr unfreundlich   Der Klub ist sein Geld nich wert  Geht einen andern Klub  <EOR> This place would great if wasn't fact victim own success just darn busy all time Want drink? 20 minute wait  Want dancefloor?

Horrible    Oh sister ended leaving 1 30 still no Tiesto  <EOR> I 5 16 which Thursday reading some reviews hesitant give shot  First would say its Vegas most places don't table chair anything else sit unless buy bottle service   case just any club Vegas  Second yes drinks expensive any place strip any clubs    For atmosphere definitely gets crowded club more venue imo see top DJ's  If trying somewhere dance isn't place you  If going see your favorite DJ just want jump down such your spot  would definitely recommend getting early buying pre sale tickets right in  line ques already long 10 30 vs presale line which wife ushered right in  only complaint main act NERVO didnt show til 2 00am which pretty late imo  All all great time would visit again  <EOR> I usually don't review but really point here  security hire very questionable  friends very uncomfortable handled set terrible experience rest night  <EOR> My favorite club Vegas right now!  pulled all best djs world   love hate big club is   definitely lost all different levels   However love dance floor big way bigger Marquee    No outdoor area little claustrophobic   Several bars each floor   I saw Tiesto recent trip probably best time dancing Tiesto!  He great lighting performers   Make friends promoter show early pre sale tickets if want bypass lines   table above dance floor best view  <EOR> I knew reading reviews but still exhausting  Labor Day weekend three hours waiting hundreds people even though came early tired when finally inside super crowded way smaller expected annoying little pathways due tables everywhere  wanted friend see least club staff horrible described other reviews  Overall did see all why worth standing even ten minute line  Europe every second club looks bigger  Some people seemed enjoy if funny group three hours fly sth else next time  <EOR> Watched above beyond here  music amazing but club not  such high expectations based publicity   It's Sutra Orange County x 10 douchiness   CONS There's no space dance bottom floor  Everywhere occupied booths  cant dance front booths crowded bouncers keep pushing   cant really dance behind booth bc theres all ppl dancing top areas behind booths  Theres no view DJs ANYWHERE unless youre right front  hung some people private booth upstairs  sad kids paid close $3000 but stuck cornermost space  while awesome privacy no crashing into them booth couldn't even see DJs see cool visual displays  lame! Oh yea opening DJ Fergie also played same generic crap over over until 1am  Yawn   PROS bought tix advance barely waited 5 mins line    Conclusion never come back here  <EOR> I haven't disappointed since found Santa Claus wasn't real   Hakkasan lackluster combination Tao Marquee's Godawful stairs   except more stairs passageways labyrinth club  If you've ever clubbed Grand SF then should familiar circular lay out  almost same referring EDM side only except extra floor so  plenty bars spread around itself gets star    Speaking bought drink bar right corner turned head see seemed 200+ lb black guy swapping mad spit skinny little white guy grabbing each others   ugh wtf!!

Beware only exception T shirt wearing only if you're wearing anything related headliner evening dress code enforced! people EDM event Steve Aoki dress shirts dress shoes? still cannot figure out  <EOR> The club huge massive cavernous damn near impossible explore just visit but everything venue next level   lighting sound next level   DJ's booked next level   service next level   Case point host Mary Lind   worked past another property she way sure Hakkasan experience amazing   looking forward next Vegas adventure explore more venue specifically restaurant  <EOR> I Thursday night being lured illusion all floors would open hoping different music playing all floors WRONG  Worst DJ ever music really sucked full old people  decided try again Friday since some friends weren't able hang Thursday night waited Hour line nothing  Security decided boyfriend did look picture ID  Well course morons  ID picture taken years ago when he younger  actually thought knew doing 6 people look only help come conclusion security Management sucks  really wish remembered bosses name total arrogant prick  club sucks  glad didn't worth any money inconvenience gave us  honestly believe worst clubs strip  should really requirements job more strict  no idea heck doing  disappointment  <EOR> Disappointing   That's takeaway here  If didn't steal all big name DJs next 1 5 years would no coming  Since wasn't built scratch tell age  no outdoor area which feel new standard Vegas clubs  Everything small enclosed  drink prices standard Vegas but charge $9 smallest bottle Fiji water refused acknowledge free water unless specifically say give tap water    The dance floor small when performer comes don't much view although DJs don't really much guess  ok  Also main headliners don't come until 1 30AM aware that  came Bingo Players crowd probably little thinner upstairs 5th floor bar table area pretty spacious ended there    The feel vibe place more Haze Tao  definitely prefer Marquee XS Surrender because outdoors  Really wasn't terrible club but given all hype waiting cost tickets very disappointed  Once headliners off contract move imagine place old news very quickly  <EOR> Worst night club to  experience started off fun but once nightclub became crowded around 12 30 hard move around many fire safety codes being violated  let many people in  Besides error management VIP waitresses shove if near VIP tables when tell them touch your face tell F**k off  Then bouncers jump act instigator  Overall back if any problems moving around call Las Vegas Fire Marshal he shut down club cost them $40 000  702 455 7311 <EOR> Last minute decision clubbing saturday monday trip XS saturday didn't want back decided hit Hakkasan W W friend said would kind music   Bought tickets day $30 guy while girls guest list   three showed around 10 30 promptly into club   Granted 10 30 literally only guys   Seemed kind sad time   DJ's doing thing but dance floor empty   This second time Hakkasan didn't much first time mostly because there's no outdoor area club   past weekend however exactly looking deadmau5 XS   outdoor areas XS during summer ridiculously hot    pushed towards Hakkasan personally   If gonna crowded suffocating least let some A C   Anyway whole thing turned lot fun   Though all drops sounded similar W W turned pleasant surprise much Sultan Ned Shepard if read other reviews   Yelp turning vegas blog me   Didn't pay single drink which still feel pretty guilty can't comment price   thing say Hakkasan though girls dancing sides really experience lot more fun   No ones crazy lights all over bodies those cool but ones sure put next DJs those tables   Every single them attractive no guys those tables   mean yeah MAYBE could happened group girls table next DJ for 10k+? but come on   really come on  <EOR> Let start saying recognize am old kind establishment take into account when reading  Came 2 nights ago bachelorette party   some VIP list which never really means anything opinion but somehow made into ENORMOUS overwhelming club little waiting no cover   Tiesto spinning night understanding kind big deal   Well Tiesto may all rage but if club crowded can't move walk dance then opinoin EFF cares spinning??   Anyway spent most time standing line walking line waiting elevators while Hakkasan can't say good experience but say 3rd floor where play hip hop 90's music little less crowded little less stupid   spent most time disregarded Tiesto 4th floor rating would likely higher  <EOR> This place made Vegas trip! without paying cover because ran into promoter  enjoyed second floor Pavilion best  over priced drinks which why am giving 5 stars but definitely recommend going Hakkasan  <EOR> Don't wrong love crowded club but worst designed places ever to  oversell shows literally no room walk around let alone dance  Getting dance floor nightmare say least getting off if even let you even worse   Sure always ball table all means just good luck getting it  Stairs everywhere just no where stand enjoy yourself   Two stars talent bring production value but XS wins best LV club hands down  <EOR> Hakkasan actually pretty nice club  5 flights stairs which heels probably nightmare especially black without lighting   The other complaint wont give water only $7 Fiji bottles  2 dance levels nice design while its busy its crowded  <EOR> I came Las Vegas girlfriends Super Bowl weekend  Hakkasan blast! free  used free service called jackcolton com  Line little long but saturday night could tell very busy  early! <EOR> Huge place nice Music Food bad <EOR> This place inspired elsewhere!!!! Customer service forte nor good character  handle crowds other peoples sweat overpriced bottles name Tiesto but attitude theft unacceptable  <EOR> I opening night friend mine  line very long but didn't wait because somehow convinced friend hold spot while gambled  Deadmau5 playing right he on  entire place amazing definitely top clubs LV maybe world  great ambiance just put good mood  expensive though  Cover $75 ea drinks $13 ea  If you're looking awesome one of a kind experience check place out    but couple drinks beforehand don't broke  <EOR> We came see Tiesto wasn't bad  purchased tickets online able skip lines  lot climbing stairs trying figure where want be  drinks expensive but expected  bar bathrooms easy no lines wait in  Once show started moved down dance floor wasn't super crammed  able move around dance without spilling drinks   when time leave able easily! No pushing shoving! hate crowds but Hakkasan spacey enough didn't annoyed able enjoy myself  <EOR> I hated entire experience  Uncomfortably crowded  Rude people  Tiny dance floor  Steve Aoki didn't come until 2 am time patience run out  spend club if free much less $70 person  <EOR> I've Hakkasan twice  First time great see Tiesto Friday May  Packed but badly overcrowded could actually down dance floor end night 1st row right DJ booth  Ended going myself see Tiesto since happened Vegas night  Purchased presale ticket without much wait around 10PM  wait 3 hours until Tiesto came since big names start around 1AM close    Second time Saturday July  NUTS!! husband guest list right time since around 12 20 closed guest line right behind us  wait 20 30 min in  Then around 1AM ridiculously crowded couldn't move  don't allow stand stairs obvious safety reasons but nowhere else go! Where supposed go?? let but then couldn't stay anywhere close dance floor which packed allowing anybody anyway  Tiesto came excited but couldn't even see all spite high heels   crowded was  kept getting bumped into wasted people only around 1AM   Decided check upstairs  can't anywhere close viewing area unless table which run several thousand $$   No screens no experience nothing  incredibly packed decided leave only around 45 min  BUMMED  Vegas just listen Tiesto drop some beats which he amazing but club having trouble handling crowds    Just don't allow many ppl in!! know big $$ but sure club way beyond safety capacity night in  just nuts  could barely stand without moving  No room walk around much less dance drink   Everyone seems OK long don't purchase table  sorry but if going pay into club I'd least some kind experience club owners show some respect clubbers   Worst part know back because awesome DJ line but try getting several ppl maybe book table  last time just miserable  <EOR> The best club Las Vegas  really enjoyed different rooms bars deejays  room more hip hop rap other edm club music  Loved both rooms  Thursday night all rooms open but best experience Vegas  definitely returning  <EOR> Our promotor guy employee guestlist free both hardly any wait go early! Hakkasan notoriously popular right now being GENERAL guestlist long torturous wait guys still pay    Liked cool entrance into club look music fact bouncers kept floors clean clear  However felt stuck beehive! crowded could hardly move anywhere  things worse annoying girl drunk off mind dancing jumping all over  She inconsiderately pushed elbowed everyone around kept harassing bouncer didn't kick out! Next guy standing chain smoking youth away mine  lungs burning afterward    The people ruined experience but club itself seem great  conclusion I'd give second chance but hope just don't physically pulmonarily attacked next time   Feel free ask if need promotor contact info  <EOR> HORRIBLE   My girlfriends jetted Vegas friend's birthday COURSE hit nightclub circuit   We ended promoter's list helped avoid insanely long line well long promoters line   sailed immediately despite inexplicably CRAAAAAZY long lines   When club extremely claustrophobic PACKED gills people smoky could even IMAGINE whatevers generic house music   worst two features blast smoke machine stage inexcusably crowded venue   horrendous machine blasted smoke chalky substance all over dance floor every 30 seconds     It literally crowded couldn't move ANYWHERE   Instead agreeing seated table guys decided HECK OUT!!!  Our entire group girls agreed would NEVER ever EVERRRRRRRR back   Even free no wait it   Why people wait pay beyond comprehension  <EOR> I recently Las Vegas celebrate 21st birthday   turned 21 week before spring break two girlfriends planned trip Las Vegas   wore birthday bash proudly entered ? nightclub fun evening Thursday March 15 2018   last night Las Vegas  As evening progressed friend use restroom   long line woman's room waited patiently   When turn friend entered stall together take care business   exited stall met two security guards   did ask any questions but accused using cocaine   took private stairwell told told could use bathroom together when came in   never told entering club nor did see any signs posted effect   matter clubs since just turned 21 week before   rules made spot whenever convenient? My friends students Indiana University Bloomington junior year   nearly perfect GPA   did far following rules being confrontational authority   told security people if suspected doing cocaine should test us   Obviously did this   asked leave   Humiliated left without causing scene  Do think right?  Where rules posted?  accuse without being able prove?  told when entered club?  usually dictate girls use bathroom?  If security footage please review bathroom stairwells   felt unsafe being stairwell two huge guys   need office security personnel take people talk stairwell    I sure people especially girls know tactics need re think visit your establishments   Your security personnel need better trained instead using bullying techniques  <EOR> Aside overly RUDE bouncers    still think top 3 favorite clubs Vegas    It also gets really crowded best way ultimate time your life table some space breathe  really club because hip hop room always fun!! need really check some hip hop clubs Vegas  Anyone know good place? Let know! <EOR> HORRIBLE stairs galore!

I'd come back but only depends which DJ performing night  Tix little pricey but totally worth it  <EOR> This cavernous thematically ambiguous only half hearted flourishes towards China venue reminds warehouses 90s raves  locked DJs moment excellent  Max helpful  squarely fan open air and thus less sardined thematically Tao least aesthetically XS congruent venues best business including Drai Marqee Tao gang shifted standard to  <EOR> Ok first off if don't big DJs Tiesto Aoki Calvin Harris step into place!! Staffs treat shits! Only if money spend big once then kiss your ass! Guest list stand front club two hours then when step tell pay cover  even reasonable price either  stood helped promote club free didn't even in! If cut off guest list line should least tell right time cut off but let stand two hours them look busy  selfish greedy cause times wasting could time think where find another option them  staffs ignore completely if act don't wanna pay cover  saw some people excited night turned down just that  meant tourists want memorable nights but all them afford spend 5k more night only two people couples  But maybe spend $500+ buying small drinks bar friends ladies  all assholes seriously! friends then left XS actually welcomed better staffs XS always best service! just use cover fee money supposed pay Hakkasan buying drinks XS even spend more that  great time good decided open bottle service very night  cheap but discriminate people plus treating people need spread news knowledge people treated expect if want visit place  try yourself understand why am upset over this  If Hakkasan's staff still stuck held nose high then wish business just way treat customers  Peace! Luv XS Marquee!! Always night!! <EOR> I visited Hakkasan Nightclub see Tiesto birthday celebration performance  never Hakkasan fully impressed!   Like most things Vegas venue extravagant entrance  Upon arrival greeted overwhelming line! least were  Surely expected if coming see Tiesto! wouldn't any other way  two lines VIP GA General Admission   four group  2 VIP other 2 GA  split but lines very quickly met inside right around same time    The place much fun crowded  people everywhere  mention 3 4 floors visit  didn't until little midnight  Probably took hour walk through all floors pit  cool found ourselves literally right front Tiesto arms length away!   Hakkasan fun venue see him  really enjoyed myself loved Tiesto stayed played til 5 am! Can't wait come back see another great show! <EOR> Now am flying back home Miami full review Hakkasan     THE LINE      First if VIP Guest List told simply tell them put long ass line least 800 people deep   Thursday July 3rd Tiësto night  When line 10 35pm wrapped doors near some restrooms total time line people actually checking guest list 1 hour     Your ID *will* checked depending young look maybe few times  Saw someone kicked line having expired DL sure good one!  people line tickets night $30     doesn't any faster FYI    DRESS CODE     Guys    sign states dress code strictly enforced  knew good    Figure if dress appropriately everyone else should right? WRONG! guys line wearing cheap solid color t shirts sleeveless t shirts even tank tops  few wearing polo shirts borderline high end club if ask    Guys wear button down shirt goodness sakes!  Ladies mostly dressed appropriately scene but haven't many clubs where ladies know dress    GETTING INSIDE     After checked off guest list approach another final ID check  Your wrist stamped second time ushered register pay in  Yes guest list didn't pay night people check off earlier line issue pass telling cashier many males vs  females your party   turn paper handed receipt then ushered into bank elevators which pack shoulder shoulder    Ugh!   ONCE INSIDE     The elevator doors opened 4th floor hallway leading couple stairs dance area  first thing noticed relatively small read packed dance floor   dance area surrounded VIP tables booths  few bars around outskirts floor VIP area  decor well    think friend put best reaction video posted Instagram    looks black box lights inside!  If smoker beware smoke your face place  Sometimes walking along poof! walk into cloud smoke thanks another patron    We also explored 5th floor figuring could look down dance floor below see DJ etc  Another disappointment here    Once upstairs only way look down floor see DJ if VIP tables booths there  Otherwise least 6 8' back overlook can't see anything really    BAR     It's Vegas figured would around $14 16 drink here  Ordered 2 goose pineapple = $40 including tip  glass tumbler plastic cheaper clubs serve actual glass guess place can't afford glass???  alcohol mixer content would say average  terrible but $20 worth book    BATHROOM     You would think place size would decent restroom facility  am sad say NO doesn't least to   Once inside bathroom attendant pretty much keeps things check and assigns urinal stall based availability    Sound great except only 3 urinals two stall remember seeing  Once done attendants extremely courteous job really well tip them may only thing actually worked well!  OVERALL     I would again unless special event going where know see favorite DJ  Even then would hard pressed pay ticket VIP guest list  only way place right probably table understood definitely thousand$    Can't wait back Miami real nightclub! <EOR> Just don't here  worst  waited see Calvin Harris three hours spent stupid money well drinks then pulled spot floor zero reason  Honestly still confused why happened every single staff member less less helpful  all sober purchased full price tickets tried any rationale happened no avail  Just don't here  Ever  <EOR> Best nightclub strip! Three floors great Dj's friendly staff management  Third floor open format while main room Dj's Tiesto Steve Aoki kaskade zedd  Lots security sure everything operates smoothly everyone safe  Great atmosphere <EOR> Calvin Harris  SUPPOSED SHOW BUT CHANGED TIESTO WITHOUT NOTICE _ REALLY PACKED OVERALL  bunch chicks walking heels hands since don't even let them sit edges counters  DJ lineup pretty good but worth high cost enter  guest list lines ridiculously long but in   why would pay $100 guy around $60 girl if they'll eventually let in? DRINKS EXPENSIVE   They say no kicks tees hats      YOU KNOW CASUAL CLOTHES but times when there's gang under dressed people kicks plain tees hip hop room  guess  must slip them little dough them let your regular clothes??

That being said Calvin Harris Tiesto Don Diablo play great shows some newer talent looks interesting too  there's reason why club always busy great party   If want table VIP walk in past line contact 510 386 0233 Ryan take care you  He super friendly took care friends all week  <EOR> Visited club last weekend EPIC! Great club great host Eric Yano ! <EOR> We saw Tiesto lastnight pretty disappointing  reviews correct regarding outrageous drink prices being 3 times would normal prices but wasn't really issue   Vegas  worse layout  literally maze  completely irresponsible capacity  saw Tiesto lastnight amazing always but literally could move  People rude drunk physically fight crawl forward but stand your ground tell them no usually back off  Capacity 2 thousand kid easily least 3500 people shoved inside  VIP joke well  People paid thousands dollars view blocked girls security let stand risers  Some VIP areas TVs right front viewing stage?? would recommend club big headliner only if okay wasting thousands don't care getting lost awkward maze Hakkasan  Tiesto filming lastnight well everyone paid ton money screwed over fan girls all granted access overrun VIP areas filming  Biggest tip Research your headliner if filming your VIP ruined because staff management genuinely don't care  <EOR> Since MGM mix people  saw few cougars wanted feel young again which cool  Sunday night isn't bad since Sundays don't really much choose when comes clubbing  Resident DJ's decent not sure Bambi but Deadmau5 Danny Avila Tiesto Calvin Harris Steve Aoki   Updated Review Labor Day weekend <EOR> Was guest list still waited hour before actually in  When finally did EXTREMELY packed  could barely move felt getting pushed every other second  group wait 10 min before actually being able dance floor because packed was  left 30 min being there  music awesome just crazy packed was  <EOR> Was guest list confronted extremely rude supervisor booted line because friend weaving even wearing heals      she kindly turned showed heels    grudgingly agreed alternative could return hour two when friend maybe sobered up  dude    confronted same supervisor rudely booted line again lied he never made any assertion may able return challenged oppose him    None friends frequent Vegas nightlife scene positive experience Hakkasan own terrible experience don't plan recommending club any friends myself  <EOR> After all hype Hakkasan couldn't more dissapointed  club definitely nice djs great but SERVICE HORRIBLE  never club security attendants rude   My friends able table promoter which awesome first  Because getting table told 10 4 hours before Calvin Harris on standing various lines multiple check ins finally club table  However 20min security guy came told 2 guys 12 girls just paid $100 each allowed sit table    saw another group being told same thing unless specifically paid your table guys allowed which made no sense   30 min before Calvin Harris came another security guy another man clipboard came table flashing flash lights demanding leave allowed sit table move yelling continuously telling move absolutely no explanation why  arguing man demanding he least tell why he told owners friend bought table he give them 'or else he's lose f******* job though fault    I know unusual clubs asked leave free table given promoters when someone afford buy comes along but workers RUDE though snuck into table stole alcohol   After leaving table down into crowd which crowded friends literally stuck same position 10 min absolutely unable move same time bottle service attendants shoving behind remember asking them carrrying large stack cups table push which he responded he'll push if he then did    Another friend repeatedly yelled threatened kicked because she leaning against surface close kinda connected tables back turned Dj crowd clear she just needed somewhere sit bit  In addition water bottles 8oz fuji waters $8 dollars each redbull $9 made 4 hours early because table all sobered pretty fast which meant spend cant imagine much drink bar   which costs lot!  Overall would never back club itself definitely cool but workers all seem power highs working hottest club vegas its just worth Las Vegas multiple times lot different clubs but never experienced such arrogant pretentious servers security  literally ruined night  I would recommend Surrender XS any other clubs! They're cheaper less crowded still great djs actually treat customers uninvited guests   If you're ready drop 5k table chose somewhere else go  <EOR> Came two nights row bunch friends   The first night Thursday see Chainsmokers  free promoter free table  definitely way go! wouldn't let until over 5 people bunch people running late  Line ridiculous  Took good half hour  Super unorganized! friend ended losing phone first night  She called right she realized she lost already turned off  Checked lost found never recovered  Greased valet lady $10 she let valet car since hotel guests only night  Also huge free parking lot available well!   Second night Steve Aoki ridiculous  sure presale tickets online avoid paying $50 door! wallet ended getting stolen even though cross body bag never left side! Luckily MGM next day  Missing all cash course  Even took coins wtf  Steve Aoki put amazing show! even huge fan but knowing he does every week crazy genuinely happy excited he seemed there  Flavor Flav well! friends ended getting frosting all over suede shoes another friend stepped literally BROKE shoe wtf! didn't even know possible! Don't wear your nice shoes here! Lots ladies heels all ended barefoot halfway through night    This place freaking huge  feel ended alone 80% both nights here  Once lose someone its hard find them again! amazed ever able find any friends again  $20 shots $8 water they're allowed give free water $10 beers  shots better deal since use premium liquor Belvedere Patron vs $10 Budwisers  Easy table if you're girl  People offering friends drinks table all night  definitely drank sink couple times hands first night  Whatevs  chronic thirst    Protips People constantly abandoning tables 20 bottles Fiji water just sitting when leave  before staff takes back! Also watch your shit  lucky enough wallet back but know people just straight snatch your purses bounce  Try lose your friends  didn't care way but amazed every time actually able find again  remember being Asian themed room confused thought drunkenly wandered into another club but just another area Hakkasan  <EOR> Location located MGM casino  I don't know if you're familiar people stand outside nightclubs try Luer give say give  discounted  special deals tell story then waiting long line over hour you'll different story different price when comes time pay stay away BS totally misrepresented whole thing save your time enjoy your time somewhere else somebody won't miss represent whole thing joke man stay away  <EOR> Was really excited finally give club try but extremely disappointed! First all didn't seem enforcing dress code    some outfits people wearing something thought would allow in  Second really really crowded  dance floor itself quite small but kind expected that  Third most importantly Dj sucked ! came 11 9 17 Dj all over place music choices  He would play something good for 30 secs then switch something completely different annoying! music really ruined experience us  Definitely returning recommending club  <EOR> If wasnt Cash Cash would left  1  guest list stood line long time 3 stamps IDs checked least 7 TIMES! closed loop line sure ID would changed  005 seconds   2  $20 drink $11 water robbery    3  definitely over capacity  sign outside said 880  place packed could barely breathe    4  If charge $20 vodka soda definitely afford ventilation system  smoke bad cloud no way escape without leaving   5  CASH CASH great  came 1am left 1 hour later still playing   I would back  way many other clubs worth your time  <EOR> Wow  Based first 30 ish reviews haters really gonna hate aren't they?  Came Saturday 4 27 Hakkasan's opening weekend  place seriously amazing many reasons 1  Girl guy ratio probably 10 1  Basically club full girls then small minority guys could afford there  Awesome   2  Such pro staff  Showed wife 10pm  No reservation  No ticket  Line least 700 deep just wasn't going deal with  Bless Drew referred Dave handled situation vet  2 line jump passes later door    3  interior awesome  Three different levels  separate room hip hop Pharrell celebrating bday   incredible light show throughout   4  bottle service booths couches well monitored looked super comfy plush    Calvin Harris Tiesto came on  J  Lo Kevin Federline dude stage    Overall best clubs ever to  many   Regarding some other comments read 1  Yes alot stairs  saw least six girls tumbling down them  Well is  Don't wear 5 inch heels if can't walk them   2  pricey? Yes  know what? Deal it  don't  But don't come expecting Ferrari but only pay Ford   club   3  agree let few many people in  dance floor suffocatingly packed hard actually dance   But overall great vibe pro staff really killer layout design   I back Hakkasan  definitely back! <EOR> Hakkasan better XS   comes down when you're talking Las Vegas bottle service industry's best Electronica Dance DJs   MGM did great job contracting world's best DJ's Tiesto Deadmau5 Calvin Harris etc  bring music whole new type space multi deck arena!  We table Ling Ling room forked $2k multiple bottles but price relevant artist demand  disappointed music Ling Ling main stage artist playing  But all worked because could mix night exploring different rooms   able mix drinks wonder down arena back Ling Ling  would think twice going without bottle service just way this!  Keep classy Hakkasan! See next time! <EOR> It's Saturday 1 3 floors open   guest list promoter still 2 hour wait   Guests leaving club saying most miserable  clubbing experience lives   forced move even though don't want ttp cause no room people pushing around  <EOR> When come Vegas clubbing only types songs ever expect hear any club EDM  surprised when came here  spun HIP HOP! mean love EDM much next person but every now then don't want just fist pump jump around   Entrance super fast  friends essentially just walked right in    Separate floors each type music   The hip hop room stayed packed but never crowded  bar line never longer two people bartenders attentive drinks pretty good  Played all good bump beats could really down it  bouncers well least only talked super cool  wanted just sit dance next DJ  VIP ish area he yeah sure no problem  Thumbs him  layout room great too  your walkways side dance floor right front center  Never crowded where shove people where needed go    The electro room way packed likings  only spent 15 minutes but assuming awesome   Overall didn't mind paying $100 COVER cause guy VEGAS  <EOR> Do yourself favor pay $30 online presale tickets avoid massive wait line  couple friends decided pay presale ticket price ended wasting 3 hours line just denied front line due reaching over capacity limits   Other its your typical Vegas night club  Beautiful surroundings beautiful people high priced drinks nice beats good DJs  Calvin Harris night went  Over all good time  <EOR> I came last night roommates possibly worst encounter staff management past experience  only did staff waste over hour time night but also treated highly unprofessional way disrespectful throughout wait time  don't expect security treat VIP level however if going Vegas enjoy time girlfriends unacceptable ANY them would personally attacked management club   We around 10 15 early night due tips promoter no line  told club wouldn't open until 10 45 group stood staff guest line talked amongst ourselves  half hour later told roommates wouldn't able because she intoxicated even though none drinking half hour  funny didn't mention anything intoxication when first arrived  didn't realize girls could become intoxicated just standing line shitty club   Long story short asked come back hour until friend sobered   When came back adopted sincere facade graciously allowed cut line only kick friend again because she walked into wall way in  Ok sir try walking 4 inch heels trekking down strip  guarantee you'll probably crash into wall even if 90 degrees away your line sight   When leaving heard another staff member saying she couldn't even avoid wall! while laughing another employee  But way friend acting most definitely intoxicated  She walked straight line past entrance moreover did near any walls   We all excited experience Vegas clubs more outgoing usual sad Hakkasan does accept vibe  If want good club XS Wynn  night before much better experience whatever crap was  <EOR> Best experience ever! Drew hooked two nights roll  feel he's best promoters met  Very genuine polite down earth  only he way sure taken care of  He always texts sure having good time even invited promoters table!  night where friends invited DJ's spinning table drop above beyond   Overall give Drew's service club 5 stars <EOR> It's global chain said some winner duck salad  Every location very sexy  neat jeans  hip cocktails AMAZING  Drama drinks best enjoyed bar but dependable but perfect  Hakka noodles woefully over cooked but still tasty Vegas  London Vegas locations  <EOR> I thought club great  sure if again experience could complete 180 recent visit club   We Friday July 4th weekend waited line less 1 hour getting around 10 30    Inside huge many rooms but believe only 2 dance floors  area featured guest DJ Tiesto other room hip hop Top 40s  music good which really main reasons going dance club right?  Drinks expensive might expect more crowded night on  Overall really good atmosphere  <EOR> I during 4th July weekend saturday see tiesto way different expected  place way small overcrowded dudes  sausage fest maybe 4 guys 1 girl  could barely move around everyone kept shoving even when shoved into bouncer bouncer gives dirty look something wasn't even fault  If could give place 0 stars would  Don't wrong tiesto amazing but guy girl ratio terrible  <EOR> Calvin Harris Tiesto Aoki spin regular basis   Need say more?   Beautiful venue! <EOR> Alright Ill start prefacing fact going clubs very long time includes great deal Vegas clubs   don't buy tables getting average citizen experience review Summary place HORRIBLE every level except music lights   First all LET WAY MANY PEOPLE am going vegas standards   CANNOT MOVE 12   two dance floors maybe should call them stand floors  mean most clubs overcrowded but takes cake   Second all bouncers WORST   mean won't even let stand place if its ANYWHERE NEAR walkway   Did mention everything walkway if its dance floor?  where am supposed go? pool people dance floor where trapped forever?  Oh wait can't because bouncer already blocked main entrance floor      because its crowded       guess just constantly scoot around shoulder shoulder hundreds people     Third venue way overpriced small maze like marquee XS much more open actually places chill relax talk dance those other venues   Only consolation music lights special effects good but nothing special compared other big clubs vegas           My advice avoid overblown attempt making money small standing cave call nightclub  <EOR> Please don't contact purposely offering VIP concierges bad experience  stuff just worse  Why trying offer bottle service rather apologizing hakkasan? 1 star  <EOR> I wish could give them zero stars  group four husband two friends visiting us  around 11 pm but didn't stay long  grab beer way back same spot security guard blocking way down ramp dancing area  He left two girls pass approached ask why could pass everybody waiting he told table  okay sense stayed waiting but little more forward he wanted apparently bc he didn't tell where supposed be   reason he told step back if don't want piss off   WTF?!? started telling he rude he should show some respect since customer  He said he would kick put hand face twice stop talking him  said wouldn't care if he kicked he wasn't nothing else f    rude security guard   Well he called another security guard took friends stairwell making questions happened then boss brought stairwell he told version which couldn't hear bc he didn't let me  boss told follow kicked claiming touched security    WHAT?!?! SERIOUSLY?!?!? SHAME YOUR STAFF HAKKASAN!!! UNPREPARED RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!  Never back there! <EOR> I need preface saying big into clubs  takes more loud music mediocre drinks impress me  being sad Hakkasan worse most   One friends made sure guest list ahead time  She even confirmed earlier day but when arrived couldn't find anyway  girl checking couldn't made more obvious if she tried she didn't believe us  Gave bad first impression before even door  ended getting line figure wanted another doorman ended letting in   The idea Hakkasan actually pretty cool  5 story club different music styles each floor  novelty wears off pretty quickly though when realize just big club  top floor where main dance floor is crowded could barely move  Everything blocked off VIP fences leaving only 2 ways off dance floor  made somewhat nervous would happen emergency   The middle floor much better  music easier dance less crowded  However drinks all floors super expensive  Needless say happy call night before last call  <EOR> Tiesto?  Friday night July 4 weekend?    Our friend said guest list  said Did tell them there's guy?  going wait main line am I? friend messages promoter again he says Sure problem but guys standard $100 cover in  The girls shocked   $100?

DJ booth area looks unimpressive rave festival stage  VERY amateur aesthetics say least  especially baffling given Hakkasan expects 90% clients i'm basing number off tablespace dancefloor ratio buy table  Why would anyone want spend unnecessary amount money super trashy room?   How expect compete Marquee XS Light when venue tacky ugly    and case you're wondering overall appearance crowd matches Hakkasan's interior design    Also ordered CLUB SODA bar because extremely parched mood drunk such underwhelming environment bartender took 15 minutes then charged $7 plus NO REFILLS  Seriously Hakkasan?? no class shame all? mean know spent wayyyy much money signing all those bigtime DJs  you're super worried recovering expenses but c'mon just pathetic   More complaints dangerously crowded absolutely NO SITTING allowed anywhere even few spots where would perfect sense allow people rest feet i'd very amused if rule safety bc quite certain we'd all die emergency evacuation no matter bc club confusing overcrowded labyrinth $75 cover guys aka  shoulda bought those $30 presale tix online bc promoter said he'd give guys reduced cover totally lying! subpar gogodancers main act came 2AM obnoxious emcee narrated pointless costume contest puzzled crowd 10 minutes long   Never even if you're curious just check first time which mistake   no even amazing EDM residencies offset overall negative experience  came FREE see topnotch DJ STILL offended want time back  club kills good vibes   Hakkasan certainly lasting nightlife institution Vegas  XS Marquee Light must relieved  <EOR> I'm right reviews unless service phenomenal horrible   see horrible worth your time money   Only good thing pre purchased expensive tickets fast   But many said prior reviews extremely pricey even more $$$$ VIP table   Being many EDM clubs raves etc   gets crowded just any other club LV ok fine but pack sardines literally can't dance all screw that   worth don't waste your time money   more fun bar hopping dancing several little spots around strip  <EOR> I visited club last night first all made big deal CA ID?

Starting bouncers very polite professional just normal asshole bouncers  club immaculate drinks stiff 16 year old virgin prom night  Definitely buy pre order entry tickets though! would definitely recommend place! <EOR> This review long overdue   would give place negative 5 stars if could   see zedd wife   First charge $25 women $40 men   even sure legal  Especially 2018   LGBTQ community should outraged based discrimination   Two men would paying $80 two women would paying $50 exact same experience   matters worse line wrapped around place didn't move hour 10 PM   walked front line asked security guy when Zedd playing?  He said 1AM opening act DJs play   asked if could just come back 1AM?  He said if did come back then he wouldn't able let because place would full   basically sell more tickets then space people   Again sure legal   Once inside price drink any kind least $20 place over crowded bunch kids mind altering drugs   Worst experience ever   Complete rip off  <EOR> 3 5 STARS  We came Vegas absolutely no plan which clubs would to  new British friends mentioned heading Hakkasan see Tiesto decided go  Even taxi driver earlier day suggested since top club Vegas right now knew see all hype about   My cousin guestlist thank Dustyn! getting into club easy lines weren't bad  would early highly suggest getting guestlist! club packed around 11 30   Much TAO decor Hakkasan left wanting more  definitely spacious but no wow factor least me  did love all lights confetti though! 5 different floors but stayed main floor Tiesto  Ladies wear wedges bring flats because absolutely no place sit! hate wearing flats dresses but sake already sore swollen toes bust TOMS haha    Drinks expensive! Two drinks ran $45 since Vegas' newest club pricey drinks expected but  just ridiculous vodka redbull  tons VIP tables surround main floor also other top floors   Though great time Hakkasan Tiesto amazing sure I'd back unless another DJ wanted see table service  However definitely worth shot if want try something new! <EOR> Wack asan clubs nickname now sense   I terrible experience omnia two years ago now know both clubs owned same person sense club exact same    Also please note clubs designed made bottle service high rollers only         The only spots actually see DJ any kind view bottle service tables unless want smashed sardines people dance floor even then saw security guard charge people past into pit  only security care guarding bottle service tables vip guests   And could give two shits if see someone into fight hurt  table area    The drinks Vegas priced which means prepared pay $15 20 per drink $9 15 dollars water depending your bartender if you    Also beware some men club dance floor  predators specifically overcrowded dance floors molest girls packed can't move around  girl crying bathroom because man aggressively touching because overcrowding she couldn't away him     I honestly still cannot believe some things saw experienced last night    Stay far away hell hole can  <EOR> I don't bad reviews see here  Maybe fact birthday weekend just made more fun but here's input Location IDEAL  MGM Grand central Strip Across Marquee  heard story owner Hakkasan denied table Marquee he basically said don't know you've started boom!

Don't price? some off strip nightclub come weekday    My opinion set your expectations high you'll walk enjoy your night  Keep your things together great group friends friendly security guard workers hey job almost every night! enjoy Vegas!! <EOR> Saw Tiesto BEST show ever seen nightclub!!! Having said still give 3 stars    some friends into club free cuz guest list through street promoter  Since around 10pm actually didn't wait long all found pretty early   sucked MANDATORY coat check entrance 5 bucks item then inside saw several people coats blazers   Inside place amazing even though Tiesto didn't start playing until 1am  service horrible!!! tried ordering some drinks idiot just kept blowing off table customers sure if only buying 2 beers bad thing paying $10 pop  Don't expect dance much cuz place terribly packed not bad if just wanna enjoy great show     Overall show f***ing amazing but horrible service think twice getting wasted before getting club haha iiiiis little overpriced but when Vegas doesn't flush money down anyways? <EOR> Thanks Guest list Las Vegas free saw Cash Cash   only thing drinks expensive little over priced but course its Vegas F*** lol ! <EOR> Not sure would rate maybe came wrong evening something just straight bad luck   pretty high expectations place barely met  must admit place pretty nice  But initially thought club two different sections but unfortunately other closed  day Travis Porter's performance he late! crowd understandable though couple fights but hard dance when there's bunch people  <EOR> We purchased pre sale tickets weeks advance see Tiesto  Overall very negative experience disappointing   The club poorly designed accommodate large number people  poorly lit stairs everywhere which led lots people stumbling tripping  super dark hard see anything let alone communicate others  main dance floor surrounding areas packed took forever anywhere hard anything but just stand there   I've many clubs busy weekends Vegas but very claustrophobic uncomfortable  emergency group leave immediately but staff saw going refused help any way  Very sad see many staff members hated jobs rude disrespectful us  <EOR> Before start say don't clubs  34 years old single    there's no reason there  said review no way influenced fact   i huge raver circa 1995 2001 starting deep house around 1994 until eventually becoming total 'hardcore gabberhead' raver would wear masks word house circle line thru it    even though don't currently listen EDM leisurely still enjoy appreciate 'scene'  years still when certain friends want night   And know deal loud house music leaves your ears ringing days i used speaker hugging Gabberhead super tightly packed groups humans hot sweaty lots pushing shoving uninvited contact sometimes control emotions   But still    Hakkasan? Holy shit    maybe because Im mid 30s father now think more fire hazard before think 'energy'  But all could think if needed fuck outta NOW we'd all trampled huge bloody mess    but still able SOME fun  But  also because chose to     It's real easy lose your cool place let ruin your night  chose just it    majority party didn't same thought tho  Understandably so     All reviews you'll read place spot on no doubt it  probably brought 20 times last night when attended Hakkasan   Yep reviews all said it'd  Yep totally expected but even all STILL shocked   They pack people CRAAZY! mean packed NOBODY chance INCLUDING staff INCLUDING VIPs nobody  bad feeling sorry staff thinking holy shit think people EVERY night?! god Id insane     elevator attendant even said Bro dont even wanna know said Fuck NO dont wanna know seen enough! know haven't really gotten real review place yet but look    is  Its SUPER packed  Jameson soda $16  There's no place walk sit BARELY stand  touching LEAST other person all times whether know them some moments people might even mistake brick wall just lean entire body weight you   I think STILL salvage your night good time if already EXPECTING this  Because believe won't disappointed! But still gave 1 star because well    place sucks haha   Oh dress code wear sneakers  way better chance if your sneakers paired collared shirt some type creative hipster ish outfit  Use your best judgement  know bouncers same attitude authority TSA agent look people   And yes forget General Admission Guest List etc    buy presale 10 you'll super fast chance enjoy place for 45 minutes before gets dangerously packed  didnt any asshole vibes bartenders staff relatively cool especially work environment worst thing people you'll deal drunk douchebags dance floor   If plan dancing plan dancing fixed spot most likely just jumping straight down without bumping someone constantly  Don't dick when you're MOVE if people trying POLITE when YOU'RE trying by  Remember nobody else happy except DJs cash $16 Million paycheck lol good time if just allow yourself to   Still tho 1 star    fuck place haha  Dangerous hell     expensive hell    Vegas big squeeze into little hole one  <EOR> I really did care atmosphere  entire place dark foggy seemed someone could pull into corner no would see  didn't feel many open places dance just lots corridors staircases  no free water entire place  bar only offered bottled water $9 bottle which found quite unsafe environment promotes drinking excess  way more fun Surrender XS  <EOR> Huge props decor   the layout LED screen light design Hakkasan visually stunning when main dance floor   From visuals only much keep entertained especially when there's crowded dance floor mixed both live crowd others just stand around  music being played lesser known DJ's until famous local resident DJ performing night Tiesto hits stage but its only entertaining assuming you're into type music being played  Luckily myself Indie house music but old fast   If you're tired area bars move pretty fast I'd recommend stocking drinks exploring other floors Hakkasan offer  friends Ling Ling Club third floor Hakkasan where fun was  Lounge areas those paying much better variety music ranging 90's current hip hop techno  crowd area lot more energetic crowd main floor well  stayed hours until tapped sore legs feet   We urged arrive early 11pm because lines pretty hectic when DJ such Tiesto set perform  Lines did crazy but warned early arrival waiting while famous DJ arrive rock house if  your sole purpose going   which prompt exploring lose your spot dance floor just stand corner twiddling your fingers    This experience ok  I'd come back but rush so  feel main floor should blast comparison Hakkasan's secondary third floors  Especially tickets being expensive only because Tiesto performing  experience could received any lounge bar cheaper price free  However still believe place looked awesome if anything  you're paying for   the scenery   Hakkasan 4 2 2016 <EOR> Crowded expensive terrible layout  Would again  Glad just help others future know here  <EOR> Came large group friends Friday night because guest list  Really wish wouldn't wasted night here    This place packed beyond belief  impossible walk don't even think dancing  even more impossible stairs all over place! drink tickets only work upstairs bars expire midnight which nobody tells you  sure first thing because each drink take 20 minutes    I would never recommend club  Pretty sure violating some safety regulations  pack double past capacity convinced  club could potential if bottle service but don't even want think pricing  If you're looking dance you're coming more person look another club  <EOR> The club TINY  music Sunday 3 27 16 terrible  glad didn't pay in  less 1 hour  won't going back  <EOR> Can just say Effin' WOW!! awesome time when Nervo rocked house!  dance floor packed tighter sardines but bouncers did amazing job keeping people moving around other areas   Shout big Mike let date stay spot right front DJ!!  agree some other good reviews bouncers guys all great!  yes older guy shaved head does hand mints!!

Bartenders good just moved around until found really liked then kept going back tipped heavily each time  Some bad does extremely crowded ladies watch your step those stairs saw few high heel tumbles lots drink spills  <EOR> Saw girl fingered club Friday night   Just realized noting trashy event might draw some people effort visit club   Well very last time going club   disgusting none security guards bothered say anything   Probably enjoying view   Water don't provide tap water bars   order bottles water though but charge $9 each 350ml Fiji ones   think part absolutely ridiculous  I wouldn't mind high price tag if least kept trashy porn action outside club! <EOR> Calvin Harris!! excited see while Vegas weekend grand opening Hakkasan   We bought tickets online $35 each   When around 11 30 something massive line outside   separate line probably within 15 minutes    The layout Hakkasan kind strange because stairwell onto dance floor VIP tables won't let use   all way back towards DJ booth down dance floor way    group 8 girls someone bound lost   Good thing lost other person myself   finally found group 45 minutes searching   The place crowded but great time   awesome music fun lights throughout entire night   Drinks expensive obviously   bartender making drinks most night AMAZING! Loved him   only he entertaining sweet he Massachusetts    Boston love   Anyways only annoying part night little snotty chick table kept glaring friend off little stage area dancing because SHE wanted it   she lied kept talking trash saying part table paid for  LIES   But overall great time Hakkasan back! <EOR> Absolutely hate club! Hakkasan twice pleasurable experience time  waited hour + guestlist line extended outside hotel damn near wrapped around block  seriously waiting line Disneyland  top off people rude tried take cuts  Then once inside overcrowded no breathing room whatsoever  barely walk dance without people bumping into you  should definitely maximum capacity   also really strict   While VIP security kept stopping girl dancing guy friend  told couldn't smoke e cig only real cigarettes allowed  <EOR> They approached  free  Charged $60 THREE drinks  2 greygoose mixers Jameson = $55   I asked vodka bartender threw 2 options neither which well     Gimic what?   Classy way handle your guests  financial analyst I'd guess if they're trying screw customers ambiguous forceful pricing bc they're trouble    Management supported tactic if investor I'd ware   something amiss    LOL upscale place prices aren't justified  Vegas scam staff coached upsell customers unethical way  glad pay $55 3 drinks if venue warrants it  joke  Smoke mirrors quality Vegas   16k reviews less 3 stars  Earned  <EOR> Came late March bunch friends may say entire experience aggressive! Early just getting elevator hectic  staff communicative getting table major ordeal fighting through crowds people only told entrance other side   I very much believe vibe service staff give off affect vibe party people act no exception  men trying literally pull table much pushing shoving very intimidated idea going bathroom which usual am fairly experienced partier   Overall would come small group especially if you're female  There's strength numbers! <EOR> Bottom line club MISERABLE if don't table  guys no big deal  jump around just fine  girls gorgeous blindingly painful high heels problem    There ZERO space move walk around  If find spot hang your hat bouncers tell keep moving  Other reviews say if girl hope some guys invite table  Chances 100 girls hotter Vegas definition club    seen them own eyes there  girls work also fit into category   Hakkasan most incredible DJs headlining no doubt  only reason why people go  Unless hard on Tiesto dying see like would pick another club  pleasant clubbing experience without table here    I also problem bartenders  see used bartend always count pours each club to  surprised she pouring 4 count 1 oz drinks $16 apiece  would expect least 1 25 town  When asked pour she told 1 5 asked why she pouring ouncers instead  unacceptable  But she's hot bitchy booze guess ends being right? still tipped her   If your time limited Vegas recommend going XS Drai's fun experience more room   grateful free but even free again Steve Aoki Calvin Harris headlining wouldn't come back  beyond crowded just fun     Just Hakkadon't  <EOR> Hakkasan sucks  Over crowded over hyped extremely expensive u don't u pay for       ONLY good thing going them tiesto resident dj there  should kept Lions instead  <EOR> Racist af!!!!!!

My favorite part club back room believe be 4th floor may third floor   Gorgeous ferns garnish walls thin waterfalls separating each individual plant   design gorgeous plants halls smell you're walking through tropical rainforest       The main dancing floor houses DJ booth which definitely highlighted main feature   Wooden designs carved throughout walls ceilings   dancefloor bit small opinion reminded Tryst   We walked through entire club stopping almost every bar along way   could see bars being hard if busy night the largest around 30 feet length      The sound probably best quality heard club Las Vegas   VERY impressive lineup DJs   Calvin Harris Tiesto Deadmau5 list on       I'll looking forward opening restaurant   back this   If you're considering Hakassan would highly recommend reserving table   Every table saw club good spacious comfortable     If don't end reserving table areas overlook dance floor hold miniature countertops if need rest your drink can  I definitely rank club above Marquee   If you're into outdoor club scenes like Surrender XS Hakkasan your best option while Vegas   I'm looking forward coming back  <EOR> The club interesting but very cramped   Packed full people hard drink dance bathroom   nearly no way some open space minute breathe   very similar other nightclubs strip   Nothing particularly special it  <EOR> Another amazing night books   Night two Vegas  girls Hakkasan Nightclub  before  always Hakkasan dope  surprised performance Lil' John  night  club packed wall wall  vibe great  Everyone dancing  bar flowing  friends dancing stages someone some point lol  energy amazing  Definitely night remember  definitely come back!!!!!!!

We early guest lists pre DJ music really making fun us  right down middle club DJ booth shorter longer crowded out  Another downfall women encouraged just guys bottle service just free drinks  guess appealing men but just didn't really that   Some cool things confetti dropped multiple time throughout evening  'undercover' security everywhere! did look obvious but people watching little bit could totally tell security  need pay unless going special DJ something  any old regular night try take walk through MGM Grand some other hotels owned MGM find promoter!

Tiesto Calvin Harris Hardwell name few    most recently saw Nervo few weeks ago   waved them dance floor Liv waved back us!  cool   where superstar DJs play sure  3 staff bouncers security guards etc all realllly nice!  think Hakkasan did great job training staff I definitely pick choose nights Hakkasan   usually certain DJ if friends CA going Hakkasan   don't think feet heels survive many visits row haha  <EOR> I club once before time would given club 4 5 but time atrocious   My wife arrived around midnight crowded but music mediocre  Security kept bugging where stand throughout night think told 52 times where can't stand move somewhere else  Very annoying  Dance floor packed people just looking each other even actually dancing  If people just want walk around then TREADMILL  drink ordered which jack coke watered down    Unless Calvin Harris coming back here  <EOR> Hakkasan your DJs your venue club  Otherwise prefer everywhere else other here   The venue beautiful  Although troublesome all those damn stairs dome roofish top all those lights venue pretty awesome check out    There hip hop lounge called ling ling room if EDM isn't your thing  There's also occasionally hip hop lounge open which bit more chill if wanna away craziness  FYI drinks costs arm leg  think costs more Light XS!  But main hate club isn't any those things  venue DJ  even very fond host     It really just takes guy  guy same guy friends always deal with  Its guy works table line checks your tables  YES GUY  He no order he just lets friends then everyone else wait HOURS  if late hour 30 mins claim table sure wait hour fault  But freaking kidding me!? When we're 30 mins early    still wait hour!?!? There's plenty more stories put but then you'll see 5 more paragraphs angry rantings  <EOR> Meh right     Came busy Sunday night see favorite DJs Above Beyond Getting no problem  comped cover which cool think its because guest list all local IDs  much smoother operation then 1st time ever came where door guys tried hustle all $100 each even though bought tickets see DJ    Once club its mayhem  Theres no rhyme reason flow place  found crowded space very close bar pretty much stayed all night  attempted dance floor once mistake  literally could move  no bouncer anything keep track busy dance floor its free all    The drinks    mean $18 glass wine? Terrible tasting wine that   couldnt believe it  growing Las Vegas when expect pay big money drinks  But just plain ridiculous  few rounds decided switch water because DD  bartender asked glass water  He pulls small Fiji bottle said $16  thought he joking    few seconds realizing he wasnt told wanted just cup water  He refused said only bottled    Im cheap Andy spend ridiculous money ridiculous things but just couldnt talk myself into spending $16 9oz water  tried leave club grab water outside bar informed if left no re entry until 2am  only midnight      I came back little spot tried enjoy rest night  Then happened    full disclosure Andy tend little handsy when weve drinking  Nothing inappropriate nothing wouldnt front own mother but play around  When kissing bouncer came over told stop  seriously could believe hearing  sharing just simple kiss nothing insane anything dude nerve come over tell knock off    We left shortly NEVER return  only 2 stars because DJs amazing  many other options Vegas Hakkasan radar no matter whos spinning  <EOR> Hakkasan definitely hottest clubs Vegas right now but means $$ unless you're lady! CROWDS galore but also DJs Calvin Harris spinning  liked room playing hip hop although dance floor small gets crowded quickly  However some elevation dancing platform areas between some booths if you're lady   stairs side down  worst parts Hakkasan you're packed sardine dance floors takes forever overpriced drink horrible cement stairs almost two flights hip hop room EDM room! Your feet killing long before end night  Take advantage elevator if can     I would highly recommend getting booth if possible place sit escape crowds although cost $$ well  If you're doing girl's night Vegas promoter's guestlists since free admission until 11pm line isn't quite crazy long  <EOR> I thought club pretty mediocre expectations pretty sky high   really expected club next HUGE club but pretty wrong     The electronic music pumping but dance floor walkways dam crowded people literally stepping each others toes   If you're pervert wearing steel toed shoes might benefit but others kind sucks   Letting many people club also led spilled drinks while people shove through dance floor   shirt literally Thai dyed all dam liquor mixed drinks   Given must repeat electronic music pretty good DJ Trash knocked park     I didn't mind million flights stairs club but lady's wearing high heels better doing your calf raises prepare   3 stars  <EOR> To everyone complaining packed inside Hakkasan KNEW going crowded packed newest most hyped club Vegas   If wanted check place without crowd then don't come Saturday night!  We came Friday night very happy disappointing trip Light   enjoyed time Hakkasan because bottle service 17 girls main floor far dance floor   bottle service area spacious shoved against another table   low platform area extra seating dancing  hostess really nice even when girls accidentally knocked over bucket ice made sure tip them extra cleaning mess!  I especially enjoyed hip hop room downstairs!   hip hop rooms Vegas always smaller main rooms Hakkasan no exception   room itself big but majority bottle service tables only   dance floor really small but platforms throughout room dance top which where some good portion night mainly away super packed dance floor still enjoy music   However girls did lost think there's only way way when you're drunk easy lost inside!    Thank Hakkasan being highlight Vegas trip! <EOR> Came see DJ Tiesto  Tickets Sunday night much cheaper guys Friday night $30 vs $75   Compared Marquee place lot smaller  Although 2 rooms hip hop bottom edm top still enough fit amount people see world renowned DJ's  Common if you're building new club Vegas build big    Furthermore isn't even outdoor area here  Although did good time would much better if club bigger  <EOR> Do waste your money going see big name  Way oversold way crowded way dangerous  see Steve Aoki tonight party leave during first song  wish fire marshal count bodies  willing bet double legal amount people allowed  being crushed everyone very rude because tight quarters  dance floor became crammed tried seek refuge elsewhere instead literally stuck stairs  don't know anyone could enjoy themselves environment  awful experience waste money could've spent venue values guest guests' safety  club could easily those plastered newspaper some emergency which no could out  Pretty club pretty lights horrible management  kind people would only act care people hurt because greed  <EOR> Hakkasan amazing nightclub!  It's new modern several floors cater your type music   would consider best nightclubs attended years   Then again don't clubbing much used to   However sure definitely more well laid clubs     Overall definitely enough space large crowd   favorite bar staff well done   Drinks popping left right before finish BAM another hands already    When flows fast people generally drink more funny thing know spent some $$ but where'd all drinks go     Needless say atmosphere music gets going just kept buying drinks everyone else!

Forget people saying uncool arrive club early  Sure you're uncool but you're also unstupid aka smart  first timer think would very back hotel waiting line if gone around 10 30pm  Ask around your network promoter Vegas  Going through promoter offers possibility discounted cover free cover etc   TL DR chill  <EOR> Great night club but over zealous over serious security staff SREW ambience you  Must visit first timer Vegas though  IMO lil over rated club is <EOR> Had amazing time closing Las Vegas weekend chainsmokers  Hakassan's VIP host Brian Pfeifer 773 459 8133 very helpful table options prices walked soon there  club amazing bottle service staff super friendly took care everything guests needed  <EOR> No outs no place sit stairs everywhere   rate Hakkasan gonna cockest   You really don't think girls travel miles country even Las Vegas going venue 8 flights stairs you? don't think they're going want wear flats instead heels just accommodate club you?  If you're smart girl you'll bring to go flats switch night  BUT  unfair girls can't don't bring them   PROS Some best DJ lineups REALLY good lighting main room Extremely good sound system probably best Good ventilation 2 rooms main edm house room smaller hip hop room played some good hip hop music   CONS No outs No place sit won't let girls sit side booths   Ugh excuse security guard want try wearing heels next 5 hours dancing?? Stairs everywhere = DANGEROUS drunk people   Only people bottle service allowed use elevators which minimum $6 000  No outside  So maybe good place another EDC rave but drunkies beware   saw guy miss step fall spill drink   He embarrassed  But sir shouldn't be  If didn't leave club early being over club sure would lot more falls Stairkkasan  <EOR> I received message management  really appreciate fact listen say!

The venue pretty big many side sections groups together if they're already table service  young attendant btw exceptional  He kept glass constantly full great conversation really looked he enjoyed working there    The DJ kept pulse well into night even though dancing seemed capacity main floor  Talk being sardine can   shoulder shoulder derrière derrière rubbing down    There string provocative dancers holding sparklers parading around sexy hot pants bikini tops honor celebrants during night  would them come over but $500 less 5 minutes limelight didn't exactly win over     I noticed lot bouncers everywhere seemed tightening security getting rid all hot mess  always some kind entertainment when Vegas  Know your limit people!

Unsafe environment  Security said common unwilling anything  Said cameras things if people fall   Never again   go elsewhere leave your valuables home  Las vegas iPhone trafficking ring BEWARE! NEVER AGAIN <EOR> Sadly always disappointed when visit Hakkasan   such awesome lineup guest resident DJs artists performing but every time plan spend night Hakkasan totally dread it   lines always ridiculously long even group 10+ cute girls   service definitely lacking   plus side really easy VIP list because many promoters everywhere go   But still flow club just greatest stage really small     When actually big DJ performance don't usually come until 2 30 am time tired drank much already just don't care anymore   same scenario happened last time Steve Aoki ATB another trip   There's also no outdoor space which kind kills me   Unlike XS Marquee there's space wander some fresh air you're just stuck super overcrowded room Hakkasan    Definitely favorite only if all other options lost   sad because love artists perform here  <EOR> I'm giving 1 star because security doesn't job when comes searching people  club experience great everything but made feel bit insecure due all shootings around United States  searched but then girls didn't searched even metal detector  think girl freely walk gun God knows would next  would think security would more strict both sexes  If don't want males searching women then hire females so  Because until something happens  when Hakkasan act might late  <EOR> Bottom list when comes Las Vegas mega clubs  Staff rude security joke overcrowded lines long drinks crazy expensive    First off $18 vodka sprite just sucks  only pay doors but then pay hefty price every drink  2 drinks 2 shots paid nearly $80  If you're going come drink before walk doors  don't expect friendly service  just doesn't exist here    Next    security  Just awful  bathroom stopped way security  Apparently because white residue floor stall used  Yep! Trust absolute shock  never life touched drugs think people them absolute fools  Yet somehow security decided accuse it  no doubt trashy girls clubs snort drugs god knows else when night Vegas but type girl infuriated accused kicked out  Never ever kicked club  whole incident mess  very unprofessional rude cruel  even allowed them search purse prove innocence yet continued jerks  even spoke actual police officer outside club he even told didn't seem type girl drugs wasn't even intoxicated he even apologized security officers treated me    Avoid place  Security act they're entitled treat people no respect courtesy  Why spend lot money place treats crap? There's plenty other nightclubs Vegas to  Try Surrender Drai's music better anyways  <EOR> Front desk Lloyd Garcia racist discriminates based your religion  Disgraceful Hakkasan  Shows very poorly establishment  <EOR> So packed almost died getting trampled death  Security worst pushed much  Drinks WAYY expensive mini water cost $10    <EOR> this club doomed start  5 level club said! hottest club vegas said! only thing hot club actual room temperature  many people packed into 2 floors actually sweat just standing there  save your time money day clubs  <EOR> We first arrived around 10 30 PM  Stayed until 11 30 before momentarily leaving meet friend outside club  stamps wrist told if rentered same way exited would able successfully reenter  being gone 27 minutes trying re enter  said could reenter jacket that first time around   front desk told could only check jacket if gust hotel which wasn't    staying AIRBNB When returned back line told hadn't followed instructions would allowed in  know follow protocol  But need someone actually listen case case because unjust resulted complete ruin night   Sorry gramátics   English second language   <EOR> Ugh  say hasn't already spoke on  Super freaking disorganized dance floor F'ing packed literally cannot move  Anywhere stand outside dance floor you're constantly being told move stand somewhere else    Seriously they're herding freaking cattle  Bar stupid packed drinks stupid expensive  Don't even started music   I some people eat breath shit EDM but just isn't me  tried hard good time but honestly just couldn't wait leave  only reason first place because some friends cousin pleaded promised would fun  Meh   Plus stairs  many stairs  hallways lead    where?

Hakka hallways Hakka stairs Hakka overcrowded  Hakka never coming back again  Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo <EOR> I visited Hakkasan group all girls night Calvin Harris performing during EDC weekend music festival just north Strip   didn't arrive until 12 30am they generally stop letting people 1am massive Guestlist Overflow line basically stretched casino  Luckily promoter picked escorted into club didn't end waiting any more 20 minutes thankfully  Huge benefit being girls only group! The layout club itself fun explore multiple levels several staircases hallways overlooks feeling bit underground but not crypt  downside layout however there's massive overlook 3rd level? isolates area tables such cannot see DJ dance floor  If you're getting table hope see DJ easy access dance floor consider layout issue! seemed bathrooms every floor which good convenience divide usual lineup women still long lines but moved quick   didn't spend much time hip hop room can't say much that    Drink options standard find Vegas lasers confetti drops nice also standard Vegas  <EOR> We good fortune experience excellent service Hakkasan Lounge second floor drinks conversation   Then when ready 4th floor second level Hakkasan Night Club   We could see over dance floor DJ entertainment above   enjoyed people watching while then decided down large but crowded dance floor   high rollers night club don't come if don't money spend     * service 5 stars  * Entertainment 5 Stars  Great way spend night friends    <EOR> This place bomb   Music loud   Drinks amazing   Quintessential Las Vegas  <EOR> Guest line long BUT moved fast   Just Omnia crowded but better because least able dance  able move    Music main floor great because Calvin Haris   They another room hip hop but small room   RECOMMENDATION OWNER please allow smokers dance floor dangerous stupid  People drunk pay attention smoking not  <EOR> I last New Years past Saturday  Always good time here!

Lil Jon guest DJ dude 5'5 maybe 5'3 surprise cool he passed champagne people dance floor   Nice club drinks pricey but yeah  given     Dance floor pretty big + several  areas w different music match your vibe    I don't think really need bottle service here  mean really isn't any place sit without table but you'll fine without table far having great time meeting people So many people just spit ya game playa! Definitely top 2 clubs Vegas right now maybe top club?

I don't know write review without going into details night girls 4 20 opening weekend     but memorable one!!!  Pros x Lines move fast  think  little tipsy  x Bouncers security aren't rude douche bags  x Temperature perfect all times  Yay no sweating  x Good lights sound great sound system x Elevators x 3 different ways enter exit dance floor x contracts top DJ's always expect someone good spin no matter week go! x Areas away music breather   Side note wish could comment bar area service drink prices but don't quite remember part night P JUST BEING HONEST don't judge   Cons x Confused hell where every time going down stairs  No signs  x Some tables all way back barely see DJ  x  Dance floor bit small opinion    In all great experience here  Good review let's frank here    doesn't matter venue people follow DJ  place good overall    Ok having insane Vegas withdrawals right now  <EOR> My girlfriend ran over security guard she falling she grabbed she wouldn't hit ground  He kicked touching   Horrible hospitality staff wouldn't listen story  <EOR> Worst customer service ever experienced all because snooty check in girl bouncers think they're almighty just because work newest club Vegas    A misunderstanding guestlist rules between check in lady promoter led group 4 girls wait 2 DAMN HOURS lined time 11  Promoter assured could fine showing entry people text message  explained lady but she kept repeating No your promoter told wrong BS doesn't work way   girls under boyfriend's name come check later she said massive attitude No TOLD can't   Uhh hell problem? everything need still can't in? Even when ran into bumps getting into Vegas clubs workers always polite showed sympathy   but chick must period something    My promoter Lois very nice helpful rushed over straighten things out  He things fixed told calmly should showed girl text which DID DO  Looks she didn't even tell whole story she wouldn't look fool  She ended having let came over defeated attitude give comped ticket  Yeah well time club stop taking people stopped entry over hour    Thanks lot ruining night D list workers  includes guard didn't even common courtesy listen walked away mid sentence  I'd much rather take business elsewhere XS Marquee treat club goers respect  actually room dance space relax  <EOR> I clubbing lot Vegas finally able Hakkasan last weekend am totally love!

If could give zero stars would  <EOR> Bait switch promoters management place    If planning Hakkassan Saturday Sunday guest list promoter talked tip advice 930 latest 10 to stand line hour just early enough blow least 20 00 drink until Tiesto whatever resident dj night comes 3 AM    reason guest list people 10 11 pm blow money   If don't early enough mentioned line 1030 11 wait 2 hours door then told 100 00 enter even though your guest list    don't let people know when multiple d bags working walking around lines could tell line if don't want pay but instead would hope pissed waste your time once door just pay   tons clubs Vegas Hakkassan cool inside but worth paying waiting line for 1oak better management better music less dbags  Watch Eric manager something Hakkassan he's very rude doing bait switch!  Really strange because he wouldn't strike type nightclub manager Vegas lol really weird he's face Hakkassan remember   yourself favor different club if thinking going most same experience once inside WET Republic better see Tiesto anyway he plays if staying Mgm <EOR> Probably most racist club  friends see tiesto guest list follow dress code all look good  Anyways friend wear long sleeve due healing wounds arm she rocks cute pink slightly furry jacket  ALMOST into club surpass least 3 checkpoints tell she can't cuz jacket friend black  She tries reason them but she gives however minutes later see white girl let similar kind furry jacket  Wtf right? Anyways club way crowded drink 20+ dollars tons douchebags just overall fun if you're living off daddy's trust fund  Save your money somewhere else  <EOR> I would say hip hop room managble except 50 year old ladies speakers hahah but more power them sure the main roo  tiesto absolutely no room move around let alone dance  lot stairs girls actually nearly spacious thought  If guestlist come early ad wait over hour <EOR> WORST CLUB EVER! If only 0 stars existed  Las Vegas friends celebrate sisters birthday  Purchased tickets home San Francisco showed ready party! line very long but literally 2 minutes  club beautiful inside but man place small full douche bags sluts  girls could sit anywhere because if don't VIP booth then can't sit anywhere    The dance floor cramped! bouncers literally push more people fit  don't legal  people dance floor couple almost having sex  guy kept dancing fingering girl she hands down pants she unbuttoned shirt  bouncers saw acted though nothing going on  watered down $25 drink ridiculous bass music system nonexistent!   My sister pissed off shitty place she asked head out  didn't even see DJ playing night  headed another club Piranha no cover some very good drinks danced til 4AM  being said NEVER RETURN CLUB  EVER! <EOR> Really nice modern club! everything you'd expect     best DJs huge dance floor  Somehow still really really packed     but guess  vegas    The upstairs where     less crowded but still fun  Getting issue times but  same everywhere else    Drinks pricey but  Vegas you  <EOR> Absolute utter crap  Low class clientele  No dress code  Overpriced drinks weren't good tasting  workers rude  When asked them where exit gave shocking telling Can't see where says exit? <EOR> I now use word Hakkasan adjective when describing douche bag events   example if someone cut off line you'd say Don't such Hakkasan asshole! Now let begin night   Stood line 2 hours   During crappy wait opened another line people stupidly willing pay double cover charge  Hakkasan!  happy didn't   Granted made friends cool dude L A  ended taking heels off while line   time into rat cage club really over it   climb stairs you'd find any building emergency stairwell   Except all black dimly lit your falling pleasure   Ladies and some men wearing heels isn't smartest idea   Unless willing fork over $3k some VIP tables your ass standing whole night   There's nowhere sit down   Due waiting line long thirsty drunken whore kind way want H2O   bartender serves water half glass filled ice brim $5   tap water!!!!!!!!!  Hakkasan!  The club didn't really enjoy much because time paid cover place should allowed enter   packed beyond capacity   People almost walking all over each other   afraid dying hallways where elevators located   can't walk pushed scary being heels dehydrated   Those Hakkasan clubbers don't care just want beats while E   main room super awesome eye but just couldn't chance enjoy glory   Over packed brim     This club much if stamina best luck you   never again!  Hakkasan! <EOR> TLDR horrible promoter boring people inside long wait elsewhere   This would star except venue DJ both super cool super fun  First all use Richard promoter if  you've contact with  group 25 girls all early 20s you'd think exactly he'd want fill club once texted arrived night began downhill  First hostess line lord whatever incredibly rude  When tried check she useless telling she couldn't find reservation even texting promoter  Also fancy club she dressed incredibly unprofessionally cardigan night club 11pm  Once finally when even more issues  led inside wait promised table bottle service Richard promoter stops texting back  waited almost hour finally found manager texted Richard all but dragged come talk lead table  Once he he told he now only room half group told just send important ones   Long story short only table hour bottle service drink  Then very rudely kicked out  Other that scene much older anywhere Vegas lots 30s middle aged men tables bottle service interested talking anyone  <EOR> 5 stars having some favorite DJs rotating residency  There's nothing being able see Tiesto Calvin Harris night night free  Thank hiring less creepy looking people your street team  don't appreciate guys bugging while trying stuff Earl's Sandwich down throat  Keep Strip  13424253453 Stars stairs   Sweet baby Jesus  Thank goodness remembered experience  Girls take off your shoes before decide climb down gazzillion floors Mt  HK  heard many horror stories women breaking legs spraining ankles  cool  need more elevators open people going need install escalator just conveyor belt around    Bring flats  Ain't no party leg cast two weeks partyyyyyy 'cuz leg cast party don't end nothing but wheelchair    The only places stop rest smoking area  Great thanks lot guys  mean privilege people blow smoke face? Urgh  Even Marquee couch  throw down few thousand dollars table service just sit though people definitely wanted 30 minutes in   There's hip hop room main room  Guess which stayed in    +1 more star getting guest list 3 nights row  also share star fact somebody cleaned vomit line within 2 minutes      So if math doesn't work out   3 Stars  <EOR> This review only club  This new club quite line DJ's weekend Tiesto spinning Sat night! Being he among top DJ's planet figured would packed course turn fellow Yelpsters advice    Let confirm clear few things now there   First nerve wrecking stairs 5 story spot but club only 3 stories  enter main floor if EDM stay no stairs  main floor middle if hip hop downstairs now see problem  Second non VIP seating policy actually places sit non VIP  If downstairs damn stairs! two directions bottom straight main room 180 walk down hall  back room open seating least until promoters sell seat VIP but seamed place sit all night  Plus those bartenders way less busy hoooook up! Third nice staff true! without doubt nicest bouncers bartenders ever dealt clubs SF Ibiza  much better feel normal steroid staredown most clubs Vegas   Fourth dress code normal Vegas smart casual  previous post mentions flip flops did see any but let's face dress code 99 9% guys maybe she did sneak them on    Fifth music hip hop room posts gangster rap probably people did stay down long enough really felt good mix many genres hip hop but Tiesto! Last dance floor prior posts accurate little no dance floor club holds 5000 people  main dance floors packed becomes more collective fist pump rather dancing  found upstairs better place dance  open area while technically dance floor sure turned into one! Oh see DJ booth if look through VIP's lining rail   The lack dance floor space reason knocked star off  All all great club DJ's Tiesto wrong  <EOR> So racist!! guest list turned away Halloween boyfriends costume three white men wearing same thing  When mentioned race thing said never going allowed again  Awful  If could give zero stars would  <EOR> im pissed off why would elevators if no use it  seriously paid money walk stairs really? better your shit together! <EOR> if could give no stars would  place should called Hakkastand because all stand waiting line  friends bought presale tickets see Calvin Harris Saturday  arrive around 1130pm  No directions where line bgeins since 15 different lines no signs either  ask someone worked he pointed said he thinks its over   line wait 20 minutes stamped  Then proceed ANOTHER line show tickets wait another 20 minutes stamped again finally way into club  Stairs stairs stairs  cant imagine many drunk people fall down these  Walk stairs come halt yet ANOTHER line people just trying cram into club  Thinking maybe just crammed because its small hallway people waiting would more room once inside actual club  Boy wrong  Some people literally looking seeing stuff people wall wall place saying cant   club just crammed if more crammed hallway  inch way through massive crowd  If invade people's personal spaces rub them just able move around then club you! awful  Could barely see anything yet alone move  claustrophobic but Hakkasan soon turning way  10 minutes friends decided GTFO  down hall claims exit huge red letters soon way down through mobs people woman says cannot exit way back through mobs out  asked if could pay leave way half joking  desperate was  made way through crowd down numerous flights stairs  knew should've believed bad reviews place but naive  learned lesson let everyone know trapped same mess was  Don't probably reading thinking sure bad can't crowded  Believe is  place giant fire hazard?? <EOR> Totally screwed security check in  No idea run club stay  away find somewhere appreciate customers MGM why losing market share nightlife train your staff deliver decent customer service  Fight line in seriously?? <EOR> Never again!!! 2 1 2 hours waiting guestlist we arrived 10 15 unfriendly employees f**king overcrowded area!

Probably not  Nothing special drinks pretty pricey   Not sure if club MGM justice since MGM pretty up  Also hearing stories cell phones being stolen club sound ghetto  <EOR> If EDM its great place otherwise recommend it   only same type music alcoholic drinks rip off   $20 00 drink $10 00 dollars bottle water? Really? Its also big inconvenience take elevator club   leave place younger crowd full energy does mind sweating expensive water whole night  Pass  <EOR> Horrible service 200 door  sent several people basically embarrassed    host pushed booth riff raff  humiliated front brother state  Anothny super amazing he runs all clubs  Super cool but some those other guys  Shame shame shame    <EOR> Loved place     Came night when Calvin Harris spinning still without glitch girls did come early though     I wish I'd read Katie B's review earlier though did cell phone stolen well   being said however club nicest bouncers EVER   basically bugged ALL THEM help find phone all super nice it     Notwithstanding friends great time   don't think place ever crowded which huge difference when saw Calvin Harris spin XS    literally thought going trampled death left within 30 minutes      This place kind small compared mega clubs XS Marquee but enjoyed time lot   wish hadn't lost phone but huge thumbs having nicest bouncers town  <EOR> This club doesn't even deserve star!!  reviews all accurate     We contacted via Instagram promoter put guest list   arrived spoke security person directed line  Once line approached another security person asked if guest list responded yes he pulled line redirected us   arrived new line only told back other line??

Giving them two stars playing some hip hop music over charging night considering 4th July  <EOR> Had such good time watching Tiesto    It gets full arrive before 12  Drinks expensive four jäger bombs $75 but expect Vegas!   The venue pretty big there's plenty room dance   Danced throw drinks still good time   good time you'll here! <EOR> Don't even bother going through guest list  waited over 2 hours half  hot humid weather cause line door  9 30 obvious wouldn't guest list Ends midnight but luckily knew someone in  literally could move  extremely packed hot  <EOR> I think could amazing night if Hakkasan did ignore criminals operating theft ring club  girlfriends pick pocketed along several other girls met specifically cell phones   security could care less everyone left night feeling violated  would say if want very cautious  all purses zipped clasped secure etc    I'm under impression Hakkasan only able set itself apart amongst its competitors headliners Tiesto Calvin Harris Tiesto great night   venue itself nothing special higher expectations  photos represent club accurately any way  your typical Vegas nightclub treats herd animals  If again would only see Tiesto again but also having valuables safe clasped purse where belong   not being pick pocketed professionals    I've many nightclubs Vegas never experienced witnessed night  expect into nightclub good time cesspool thieves  <EOR> Loved great when calvin harris deffinetly worth packed but great!! <EOR> I Hakkasan plenty time past past experiences absolutely mind blowing  Literally having best night life! only time club when Calvin Harris performing  I am huge fan btw! I recently Las Vegas past weekend Valentine's Day weekend nightclub Friday  Going inside club very smooth people work very friendly kind  boyfriend unfortunately pay $110 inside club  I think  bit ridiculous honest  inside guest list free  When bit slow because people just getting there  never issue before but specific night boyfriend overwhelming  BIGGEST complaint felt security wasn't managing people going main dance floor  WAY MANY PEOPLE dance floor  Literally boyfriend push shove just dance floor  way overcrowded dance floor  getting pushed shoved elbowed stepped on  people wanna drink but feel should no drink policy dance floor  reason say because people now days disgusting literally just throw empty drinks floor  kick 5 empty plastic glasses way  Oh some people just dance crazy drink tend spill everywhere people  Last well suggest well should no cigarette policy dance floor well  idiot super close smoking right next flicking cigarette all over place felt he going burn me  am all safety first felt SAFE dance floor  feel management team needs some changes  its VEGAS but feel no should risk because security can't manage crowd control  Something think Hakkasan Nighclub  Other then boyfriend great together but Hakkasan great night  <EOR> Ugh  Seriously least favorite club Vegas all ones to  There's many people edm floor always crowded see DJ came first place  ' Tiesto Calvin Harris W W didn't really experience any those times    Tiesto slight exception because friends table hip hop room  would definitely 1 star review if hip hop room more fun especially because crowded!  This place also suuuper expensive guys usually $75 good DJs free girls guest list though glad girl lolz but sucks guy friends ! Sometimes GL line gets insane though friends waiting neear door leading outside before pulled another group girls PRAISE DA LORD try arrive early least time your promoter says! <EOR> I wouldn't back  pack people sardines  Couldn't even move  Tiesto used awesome  Followed music early beginnings  However he wasn't even playing  He'd take headphones off during mix  put them backwards  understand pre record time lights better experience but mix music subpar  If premixed there's no reason shouldn't brilliant  top 40 radio station mix  listen 105 9 Saturday night comfort California    dance floor constantly elbowed pushed people tried push past closer although no where go  just decided they'd run over people  5'4 big guys pushing over right front because apparently think they're better then anyone else should able push shove way upfront  Pigs     Not only club fire hazard  couldnt move anywhere no can  If fire youd never out  dont know fire marshall okd this  Kids save your money  work hard pay 100 plus bucks just wait line treated cattle dj isn't playing crowd subpar music    On plus side heard omnia better  try next time  <EOR> Freakin' small   It's actually pretty spread out club meaning halls nooks but far dance floor goes   small   Prepare your ass knocked down if try your way dance floor  Since everyone drunk going wild floor knocked down  fact fell twice no men helped strictly reason falling over disgusting me   The bathrooms well kept though  experienced lot nasty club bathrooms especially Vegas but surprisingly very clean   I actually kind fact wasn't normal layout club wasn't huge high ceiling one big room club  kind maze  Upstairs downstairs hallways isles  But dark very dark especially upstairs  lot more men expected though probably even ratio which surprised me   The music good though DJ never stopped he played intense set whole night  spent lot time upstairs because see most everything wasn't near crowded downstairs   The drink prices f ing crazy  but guess  Vegas  <EOR> One most hyped clubs since last year Hakkasan  When WMC year Miami saw cab cab advertising place  month heard many reviews both positive negative thought only way find see myself  particular trip doing preview comparison between two newest mega nightclubs Vegas built cater EDM crowd   other review Light Mandalay Bay    Located MGM Grand prime real estate serves convenient spot South end strip dwellers  Most younger crowd ends staying hotels around area close all clubs without spending fortune cabs   didn't checked into hotel Platinum Ballys until 9 30 somehow enough changed Vegas bests tie vest whole 9 yards still club 10 45   fairly good ratio females already texted long time host which worked Wet Republic Thomas in   As approached club zoo surrounding place  Also guest list line wrapped around building into hallway where stores are  Finding Thomas almost impossible especially when he caters mostly higher end clientele probably busy seating 25K min tables he sold particular night  Thomas directed someone else worked ropes front he able group ladies smoothly  process getting past ropes didn't last more 5 mins bouncers checked your credentials entry    I physically set foot club 11 15 PM dance floor still crowded  managed quick tour entire place found few sweet spots where bass hit very well  Surprisingly sound dance floor itself loud second level  Another thing notice crowd tends flow right side dance floor  If entering dance floor would probably easier time staying left without being bumped into   midnight all bets off free movement dance floor    One gripes read lot other reviews many stairs  did find issue all  If comparing stairs Marquee just baby steps  also elevator takes two places exit downstairs hip hop room  guys working elevator specifically tell where going sure take right one   So finally decided enough getting bumped into sub standard opening EDM acts hip hop room Chris promoter Light met night  took elevator down heard nothing but ratchet music tons smoke  People definitely getting party on  hip hop room actual dance space seemed crowd able more fun  spent good 45 minutes down before almost time main act come main stage   When Dada Life finally came seems lighting volume increased production value up  production mean more confetti ever before  Dada played very expected set  wasn't haven't heard before other festivals clubs  think problem signing resident DJs play every other week tend lose interest changing crowd  probably more problem Vegas now days anywhere else   The night came went  can't say let down  also can't say mind blowing   think owners really focused keeping restaurant element Hakkasan left few essentials probably help put place over top  overcrowding issue tends occur clubs converted restaurants  I e  Tao nightclub almost unbearable most nights full house  Hakkasan does few places take breather only if know where look  would definitely come back    PS  met favorite day club hostess Danny Wet Republic  its own made night   You read full review pics http bit ly 13EMT94 <EOR> No wonder shit 2 5 stars why fuck would mix Kendrick edm music sucked crowd sucked ! Don't trust Cali know what's lit ! Trash ass fucking music <EOR> Being girl just great especially when Vegas  Girls all first timers your homework before head strip  should paying NOTHING when club despite hyped club which artist playing always way    During Bachelorette weekend club Hakkasan  Located MGM Hakkasan received lot popularity recently being pretty new having variety popular EDM DJs performing  help some scoping Instagram asking around able connected promoter placed VIP list in    Here's thing going clubbing 3 day weekend where everyone mom decided want Vegas crowded shit! sure come early won't mind getting your shoes stepped getting consistently bumped groped both intentionally unintentionally strangers  clubs Hakkasan sure arrive lot earlier allotted times sure actually before cut off time    Upon entering Hakkasan found ourselves faced series stairs  club itself large but rather bunch rooms stacked top each other  Stairwells dark steep no signs indicate each level holds  elevator but areas poorly marked getting into almost hard getting into club itself  Keep your ears peeled decent hip hop room    Let emphasize again tiny venue point night standing still middle crowd because just where no possible movement  Based other venues nothing really stood decor yeah your booths tables dance floors but  really it  If good DJ you'll hear great set but nothing really fawn over    My biggest pet peeve night amount people lighting great cool you're smoker but really necessary blowing your smoke already crowded hot area? terrified walking around club seeing butts everywhere fear would side swiped firey ends    Yeah fan  Overly hyped venue maybe worth revisit once hype dies down crowd moves next shiny toy  <EOR> All saw gorgeous women finest men top billboard DJ's  could anyone underestimate visit Hakkasan Nightclub?   This first Las Vegas nightclub course blast! But mindful thoroughly packed when big DJ such Tiestö scheduled spin during evening  couldn't believe big nightclub believe three four floors! Drinks slightly pricey side but Vegas expect?   Get line early possible lucky able front line 10pm  Ladies free but understanding men charged $50 entrance    Wear your finest dresses falsies all out! Don't forget bring pair foldable flats ladies you'll dancing your lovely tush night away hours end x <EOR> Worst place Vegas  worst staff possible  try bad life  Made wife buy crappy $20 plastic shoes cause didn't straps  Staff combined IQ moldy cheese <EOR> We stayed MGM grand Hakkasan second night Thursday  told best night was! watched R3hab perform place packed  great dancers foam glow sticks confetti    We given few drink tickets 4 females but end night someone bought vodka red bulls $21 each  Yes  Ridiculous but guess  Vegas  heads there!   The lounge top 40 lounge different levels club clear seem ads  house music all over club  <EOR> Don't bother guestlist if you're trying see big headliner just buy presale don't wait hours just in!  It's great there's always good headliner DJ playing every weekend Vegas thanks resident lineup but biggest problems layout management   The layout and down maze  steps always overcrowded people watch your step you'll playing dominoes human form  If want avoid crowded dancefloor and getting stepped high heels nonstop good escape upstairs but really isn't area dance  good view fancy lights effects   The management pretty bad  past experiences dealing promoters pretty rude just inadequate helping into venue without some catch  <EOR> I last weekend first Vegas experience 21 year old  wanted hit all most popular clubs Hakkasan being them  came see Kaskade w Illenium  Music good people nice but club itself sucks   The club 3 different lines General admission Guest list Staff guest list  staff guestlist check took 2 minutes top then climb bunch stairs club  first set stairs arrived hip hop club super small but seemed nice  Upon going ANOTHER flight stairs made Hakkasan  Let tell you   dance floor itself small block off people don't sneak into reserved tables  Now if aren't able dance floor places stand watch   Walk ways  AKA stand against divider until people pass dance again   We left half hour into Kaskade's set  could cool experience if able dance crowd  Don't wrong club potential but caught selling tables General public can't dance  <EOR> What better way celebrate 29th birthday try live turning 21? many reasons why don't frequent ultra high end nightclubs anymore but guess lucky day  first time guestlist comp tickets actually free  No cover guy Vegas?

How much does place suck? Let list ways 1 many stairs  Stairs into club  Stairs bar  Stairs into other room  Stairs bathroom  serious? your club ground floor minimal no stairs  wind knocked right trying into main room  just bad way start beginning your evening breaking sweat trying into club   2 Bottlenecked hallways pathways  someone say fire hazard? love clubs understand packed areas part normal protocol  But Hakkasan test your level patience cramped gets going area another  even because club being able accommodate crowd letting in  just bad lay design hallways people need where want be   3 Dance Floor lack thereof  club huge you're designating 1 20th venue dance floor  just no sense! Especially when hottest dj's world playing everybody wants dance floor  Well bad there's many people little dance floor accommodate everyone  why don't just stay cramped hallway stairway somewhere cause  lot of   4 can't see DJ  whatever reason impossible see DJ here  Once again poor design layout club  designers just did take into consideration when building venue  Being able see DJ important part experience  Trying view DJ just something person should worry about  Totally kills mood   5 Poor design aesthetics feel  Upside down parasol umbrellas hanging ceiling blocking off lighting light system should hitting dance floor  just no common sense all installing fixture  Bartenders bus boys wearing ninja suits servers wearing shanghai dresses? just tacky borderline racist   Calvin Harris Dada Life Nervo Hardwell some favorite Dj's waiting residencies end rather come back club  even worth check first time  Seriously! Save your money time XS Surrender Light Marquee instead  <EOR> You must bottle service If here   extremely packed but  hell fun time     The music great     The tables sections store your purse charge iPhone which great    Be sure not  order bunch water charged 200$ Just water   Note bill add crazy ours totalled 6k did drink very much     Either crazy bill dance floor insanely packed but great time waitress awesome bathrooms clean!

Although loved music packed enjoy  made way Pavilion try find spot watch Calvin Harris which impossible! Again crowded! lucky find spot side thoroughly enjoyed ourselves light sound system AMAZING!!!! New Years celebration! Although wife stand all night seek slim spot stand still really enjoyed it! If paid much tickets drinks I'd see DJ least!   1 star decor overall atmosphere  2 star music light show 3 star drinks although expensive strong!   Negatives many people!!! many People!!! Nowhere sit barely could see stage Calvin Harris <EOR> We corporate outing where rented entire venue ourselves  appears huge club place TINY  staff nightmare  If you're happy wearing teensy little miniskirt serving free drinks tips then perhaps should industry  Rolling your eyes paying customers cash burn probably isn't great business decision  If worked you'd looking new job       the bathrooms very clean  There's plus  <EOR> Went Vegas business trip decided drop some nightclubs evenings  kinda whack    I ended getting guest list but then realized 100+ other people same guest list line resembled probably exceeded TSA line airport  Pretty whack   When most club area closed which kinda whack  12 dollars BEER? Whack   They pretty cool chill lounge area little before entrance played old school hip hop  definitely whack didn't give 1 star   Anyway should prolly called WHACKKASAN  <EOR> I love promoter all hook ups arranging everything but am sure if would come back  Maybe if favorite DJ's here    Like many other Yelpers bouncers staff weren't friendliest  start conversation asking them night going  if considered busy night them  friend pretty dead weekend where even some promoter friends vacation PLUS Thursday!   mean sympathize them deal drunk princesses folks town rowdy however Vegas  when being rowdy obligatory    The DJ night playing mixture hip hop EDM  Don't wrong love both but transitions awful  moment nodding Two Chains next moment slow dancing deep trance  am sure off night other nights other DJs much better  just expecting little much first time Hakkasan    Please correct if wrong  reason why don't offer tap water Hakkasan because water system Nevada general sucks butt  am spoiled Bay Area water free tap water seems natural    I felt club little smaller expected  Nevertheless let's give another during busiest time season  EDC Weekend  <EOR> OVERRATED! waited 4 HOURS see HARDWELL isn't even big Calvin Harris Tiesto guess WTF happened?

DJ high friends put shoulders see Tiesto's whole face haha  block off decent amount side serve space line hard squeeze dance floor since everyone side  if dance side dance floor people always trying past you  think leave decent amount room tables back   Also there's nowhere put your drinks dance floor everyone puts them ground  Thanks being very considerate  Since gets packed sometimes spray cold gas us  Thank goodness    gets hard breathe short ones!

The club itself really nice absolutely love interior design  definitely those higher end kind clubs drinks really expensive  workers amazingly nice just great experience overall  right front DJ booth night all decided wear red coincidentally Calvin Harris played Summertime Sadness  friends also became friends security front allowed put shoes right under DJ booth  He really nice overall just great night  <EOR> For past two Vegas trips least night where stopped Hakkasan  treated awesomely both times   The first time group girls Thursday  arrived early little no line  free drink tickets vodka drinks  don't remember DJ night no spectacular   We stayed late danced butts off  met new people great time    Hakkasan always top DJs built beautifully  always awesome dancers light shows front  dance floor big but never big enough   The second trip made came only because Rose Rabbit Lie closed 3 am but knew Hakkasan would still open  didn't until 3 15 3 30  hesitant let but because girls did    Obviously DJ left then  don't remember but Saturday night someone good    When dance floor cotton everywhere! hell?! pillow fight happened think!

Took 30 40 minutes in  Probably ID'd 3 4 times   As soon friend order 1 drink $28 later realized spending some cash  immediately made way dance floor  Cluster fu*k! could even move! more bunch sardines vibrating eachother  Everyone else tried stand constantly told move    We left Piano Bar Coyote Ugly   MUCH better time!  XS Marquee Haze still favorite clubs Vegas! club won't last don't waste your time  <EOR> Was memorial weekend blast! Saw Calvin Harris extremely crowded security great! perfect view drinks pricy but we're generously mixed  Dress code pretty common far wearing skirts dresses    men anything button great! Saw some guys wearing suits well! Anyways coming back Labor Day weekend can't wait ! <EOR> Came see Tiesto Friday night   Place beyond capacity talking least 500 people over should allowed in   Paid $85 ticket disclaimer said Guaranteed entrance before 11 p m     Tiesto didn't play until 2 30 a m     I'm paying $85 ticket   least reserve spot people paid money advanced  I am aware growing trend among clubs   which total bullshit!!! Anyways realized way crowded to point where almost touching hands whoever next you walked towards back club   Even though little bit better spots right behind bottle service tables   people bottle service stood seating area totally reasonable paid it making impossible anyone near back see main stage     Overall pretty terrible experience far place set up   sound systems weren't set well sounds piercing times   Visual effects extremely mediocre  8oz bottle water half your normal water bottle $9    1 star Tiesto  <EOR> Don't let great DJ's overlook review!  I don't understand designers thinking sometimes  Hakkasan MGM much going it  hot new club strip incredible resident DJ's people want there  But done ignored normal party goers catered wealthy spend big bucks table    I'm joking if don't big $$$ don't waste your time  entire 4th floor basically tables VIP  normal folk funnel dance floor through staircase used enter exit dance floor  Good luck getting off once fills up  Took 5 minutes pushing shoving politely might add move 20 feet  dance floor itself feels 6 6 box try jam 500 people just no space anyone  Dancing non existent just try stay upright hoards people  Then once think room enough maybe move bit someone pushes past shoving match ensues again  Also heard theft issue because people jammed tight would tough notice someone grabbing your wallet phone  Someone next phone stolen  Needless say before wife chance see Hardwell left    I feel club really missed mark  only survive being hit Club long  But club built minority people willing spend thousands tables those willing shell hundreds just stand no where sit rest your feet BTW  don't think stand anywhere outside main floor see DJ no such places  Non let stand anyway people tell move if try  Won't long before people street begging come here    Oh wanted charge $23 Red Bull vodka  laughed walked away value money bit more that     It's shame because really beautiful club really nicely built awesome lights but just no room  Big missed opportunity   This review main dance floor 4th level Hardwell Tiesto Calvin Harris don't let review dissuade going trying something else there     UPDATE Hakkasan credit contacted asked come back try club again  declined don't feel return trip bring different experience unless layout changed  Plus live Utah  I'd say found staff interacted mostly friendly other bouncers  <EOR> I'm disappointed! pre bought Tiesto tickets but guess NO during entire process buying tickets actually getting club told Tiesto would 4th floor! waiting until 3 A M  then someone said oh Tiesto upstairs but he gone  Ok guys know which floor performing but can't let guests know getting stamps stuff  don't being uninformed shows poor management people promoting actually conducting business  Totally uncool! <EOR> I understand why all ladies hate club but LOVE IT    WHY?! HIP HOP ROOM  hip hop room plays top 40 hits old school music well  think best thing happen Hakkasan  honestly just hip hop room every time am there    The stairs bit annoying but elevator ladies! Bottles? necessary? Yes no  depends where it  If main floor in back area looks bit lonely if don't many people around you  recommend bottles near DJ hip hop room    I love Edm music but when comes Hakkasan only want area hip hop    Always buy your pre sales beforehand line moves easily  no trouble bouncers getting in    The only don't club cannot 'in out '   Overall love club because hip hop room much bigger Marquee  hoping more clubs bring back music  <EOR> All b s  aside experience taught really check yelp reviews people liars over 800 negative reviews! Wanna treated garbage here   The three times prior last attended once dj'ed anyone directory no b s  always some no one spinning   We ownership members signature towers which getting dated sadly    took dates down mgm nightclub which owned operated mgm resorts group which most likely why does bad customer service   As ownership discounted rates enter night club showed passes door man two petite little women told needed check coats prior entering  am sure if anyone reading aware vegas cold place especially doors   I let door man know thinking over coat check issue inside only hear two unhappy cold women banter me  door man asked step over waiting line block entrance no biggy moved over  3 guards immediately surrounded started starring down me  'DO FUCKING PROBLEM' Mark senior guard barked me  No stepped over when asked thinking climate prior entry    It experience many Las Vegas if club owned managed resort happy place      If read other reviews see am pass fail type always try situation better always possible  club trice before due convenience returning last night  <EOR> All gotta say NEW FAVE nightclub Vegas!!  Went Saturday opening weekend lines weren't bad since group girls directed early early 10 1030 promoter host Kevin    There 4 levels club but don't count 1st floor  The second floor hip hop room dancefloor middle tables bottle service each side along full bar each end room  QuestLove DJ'd night pretty siiiiiiick  The third floor main floor    meaning whoever headlining night which ours Bingo Players where set 'unz unz unz' music!  The fourth floor where lil lounge area more chill music more seating ONLY bottle service more tables surrounding balcony like area overlooking 3rd floor   I much fun would totally recommend everyone come check out   I gave place 4 star though because NO outside area    little NO places sit  <EOR> I club couple times  always fun each time there  table service great sanitary professional  There's always large crowd whenever there  DJs always awesome well! <EOR> Awesome night club awesome current past hit mixes  Three levels two different DJs spinning simultaneously  pick your genres  Bottom level more mellow highly recommended upper level  <EOR> Where begin   I took group girls friends Bachelorette party heard rave reviews club  working directly promoter all see Tiesto free  Also promoter gave VIP passes back where DJ booth area was  share table another group bottle service  even list   Well hour waiting check table bottle service line separate huge guest list line into club  Needless say irritated waiting hour just check but still very excited in    The ambiance club actually pretty awesome  DJ booth lit whole light fixture behind DJ booth changed colors light designs very cool ! Here's where problems began   this club although huge felt tiny because jam pack full people  nowhere stand let alone sit  see where people say fire hazard because frankly is! soon find clearing people stand bouncers moving along you're blocking way other people  dance floor tiny compared other clubs XS Marquee  Also good mixture people there  hate word way but Asian invasion   I no problem certain race ethnicity but come bring mixture people!  After initial overview club headed towards VIP area  handed slip paper granted entry area only denied   The bouncer apologized said many people VIP area already couldn't unless some people left  Wow! irritating  would say if group overweight under dressed not so cute girls okay maybe didn't want hurt image  But dressed hair done makeup done heels we're all very cute must say! hung around bar see if anyone would leave although found would unlikely   many people crowded around bar being pushed around some guy spilled drink friend because he drunk stand overall just many people everywhere  We're all frequent club goers many clubs before but hands down worst  shame because atmosphere cool but need stop letting many people into club keep more exclusive general    I probably won't again  shame because many favorite DJ's residencies here  stick XS Marquee! Note Hakkasan employees learn better customer service accommodate amount people come through club  <EOR> Over rated crowded  many people running into me  still fun  If free its worth but don't pay money in  <EOR> I think only 1 star review given out  Sadly enough based customer service service value  seen ABSURDLY expensive bottle list packages circulating internet upload picture seem proud of  cheapest starting $12 000 $500 000!! half million dollars 4 hours impressing your friends co workers Vegas hotties wasteful be  second thing rating them service  showed check hot new club group 11 friends 7 girls 4 guys  First required $10 000 bottle service let then over hour waiting getting closer 1 am came down just cover $150 per guy + $50 per girl + $300 door guys pass line  Sad thing could easily afforded $10k table if wanted but way treated demanded acted though waste time  ended grabbing huge limo hitting another great club strip    I really looking forward checking club now could care less  friends even General Manager when he answered cell he said no time no tables then hung me  guess list famous enough warrant time  Sad day Angel Mgt group!!! really supported all around town still enjoy your other locations  <EOR> It fun night but doesn't glitz glamour other clubs vegas  <EOR> best club Vegas given yet Ghost bar   DJs awesome dance area massive  two maybe 3 levels club couple different DJ stands  lots lounge areas before into actual club  but little known secret if spend money restaurant into club free  guest list usually expansive line in  its really only club Vegas ive seen more hott ladies dudes  guess theyre really good recruiting guest list <EOR> Horrible customer service hospitality  lady took money door pleasant  understand working bar club isn't easy especially when owner packing many people bad practices    The girls thirsty wanted water  dancing drinking sweating  won't give tap water  $10 12 ounce bottle water  understand thing being little more expensive strip lived whole life but ridiculous  When ask cup ice $10 water bartender stated very rude tone mean $10 water didn't buy  21st century am gay man women don't need man buy them drink  If he gentleman he could nicer refusing tap water  Granted understand being happy serving customers aren't nice but said please thank tipped nicely all servers less spectacular   Then when going back dance workers slides front everything stop myself bumping into him  When bump he gets mad look face complains bouncer actually decent enough realize when pack 500 people into space meant maybe 200 include alcohol people going bumping into people    Of all clubs visited worst experience ever had  drinks expensive everywhere strip but staff most other places actually practice hospitality  sexist nature place appalling  never club where being guest list meant guys still pay cover big deal originally planned paying full price but friend guest list saved $10  visit any more clubs restaurants owned group  <EOR> Worst nightclub ever to  Overpacked oversold no way move walk breathe take drink hold drink especially dance     which reason there  Nope nope nope  Kick rocks Hakkasan  <EOR> I'm sure rate place    Got free   Guest list through two lines   Tip before 11 10 isn't bad idea didn't through crazy wait  for guest list least   friend said she waited 3 hours time didn't sure why anyone would wait long but yeah   Second line id check stamped then guest list check stamp then window booth thing inside like movie theater Experience just weird into elevators on     What expect classier LIGHT nightclub terms outfits not all but much leggings crop top kind place guys more well dressed   Atmosphere more LIGHT but terms music might liked LIGHT more wasn't fond here  EDM but didn't feel great   BUT  Theres HIP HOP floor downstairs! loved it! Some people mixed feelings some songs great some bad   It's less crowded down EDM floor bit more intimate way though     CREEP FACTOR not regards club but attendees Just night didn't deal anything LIGHT felt guys nicer way entirely    I really liked hip hop floor met random girl guys we're all dancing together  way but each other    cool    But guys arguing EDM floor if knew random stuff   DUDE you're trying hard   don't guys   weren't touchy freely but didn't leave alone      There still drunken bimbos everywhere though classy   spilling your drinks stuff      Bar I only drink lemon drop shooter cheaper martini felt bartender   she can't drinks   just thought    Tip Bar upstairs still EDM floor less crowded first floor EDM    Bathrooms have lot 'specials' perfume lotion stuff   interesting   <EOR> Methinks not  Drais Marquee Paris anything   Crowd OK  packed but really all people prowlers  Guest List offer free entrance but come extremely early when no point youll just bored ready leave    Theres better spots LV  Live find them elsewhere  <EOR> Not fan    Hated stairs  Hated fact no seating  mean c'mon girl needs place rest feet    Overall just horrible experience  bestfriend's 21st birthday ended leaving 2 hours party somewhere else    I would definitely skip club when Vegas  just wasn't worth time  <EOR> Hakkasan LITERALLY all best DJs    means BIG LINES! suggest going really EARLY if you're guest list don't come all  Your best choice table no wait plus doesn't want table?

I also noticed wristlet tugged multiple times  lock every time felt tug lock removed  checked cards cash  debit card cash stolen  Wow    Later into night noticed more girls started calling names  guess man touched apologized gather gang people start hating me    I really wanted leave but didn't want ruin boyfriend's night seeing Hardwell  stayed   Upon leaving club noticed scum pick pocketing guys    I REALLY wished better experience but rude unprofessional people staff  Mind majority whom visited night looked 30+  Ugh    Leaving casino heard names being directed left right all because jerk thought trying feel     For 1 star  Worst club ever  am never coming back  But review another   If plan visiting recommend 1 Wear flashy flats small heels if possible  bring pair wear before all dancing standing no place sit 2 Honestlly if lock broken multiple times clip your bra sure you're covering access opening your hand   3 Don't bother drinks  completely water down  I'd just spend your money water  Even though small hell   4 Bring pepper spray guys harassing you  <EOR> I expecting good service management club  But suck completely management sucks balls  They'll try drain your money while giving shitty service  <EOR> I decided needed vacation over birthday seemed fairly logical delightful  arranged trip Vegas almost 6 months advance boyfriend spend week town m f    Since birthday week mine decided tickets Hakkasan see Tiesto because boyfriend huge EDM TECHNO fan   Boy did plans backfire!   We Thursday night arrived nearly half hour early fearing lines all heard dreaded  No lines formed yet but stuck around tried figure which line needed pre sale tickets  Bouncers hit miss if cool not   little testy when we're trying find line touched sign but he chilled when he realized lost helped keep spot first line once people started show up  women behind very displeased decision  made point being super pushy close while line trying show should first  club didn't open until 10 pm guest list attendees first to expected but all other lines waited stamped 2 times while waiting line  Finally started let around 11pm  Bouncers quickly scanned any clutches females but men heavily scanned pat down   Needless say boyfriend more soured outlook security staff do    Thank God boyfriend convinced wear flats night   would crying time in  also suggest wearing your best shirt suit jacket men lightweight dress women   Basically dress impress because many wearing bodycon $200 dress Armani suit  wore nice bodycon dress Ross acceptable boyfriend nice polo   He felt rather underdressed both felt little place  others but few far between    When finally passed security elevators waiting  ended sharing 'favorite' people night aka girls behind us    dance floor wasn't packed yet fact few people where all even vip tables relatively empty  bought drink $18  small 8oz rum coke filled mostly ice   rum coke come $3  only thing bought    We made way front which still completely open   couple bouncers stood watch front keep people away rope keeping LCD screens significant damage  larger white guy bald head very chill friendly   He would even dance if danced direction! Lol  Around midnight very packed but some dancing   bumped stepped many stilettos white Latino waisted girls barely old enough drink scary   when bumped into self entiled daddy's girl attitude made 'bad guy' fault waisted couldn't fun   just looked hint wasn't putting tantrum  each girls traded each did nearly same routine  hilarious sad same time  only 25 saying feel crochety old lady   Maybe just didn't enough alcohol drugs feel sympathetic situation    Tiesto came around 1am  boyfriend acting shield all night am  sure only relief night  He tall enough see Tiesto behind front even some footage pictures share friends back home  Almost half hour into performance nearly panic attack because twice many people dance floor before just look Tiesto already sardine style before he stage   only before life over guy tried assault years ago  boyfriend could hear over music ghetto earplugs made stripper cards picked s's g's but he saw face tried drag there   back dance floor couldn't out  took refuge women kneeling wheelchair nearly 4 bouncers around keep safe people if VIP seating  able calm down find some composure but just enough finally 2 30am Tiesto plays till 4am  could enjoy Tiesto's music awesome   If wanted attend mosh pit would found something actually stated mosh pit reason bludgeon people next me  feel no need return Hakkasan anytime soon highly suggest anyone contemplating going first time seriously soul search going enjoy your attendance  <EOR> We failed experience Hakkasan Nightclub   rarely give 1 star Yelp reviews but think situation warranted it   friend guest list nightclub which seems all rage days Vegas   club promoter put guest list assured would able before midnight   line around 10 30pm proceeded stand line 1 5 hours   Even guest line ridiculously long no updated long might take   finally section line where promoters came over talk us  around midnight point club promoter told guest list now closed  would nice know going close guest list sometime 1 5 hours standing line   all pointless   club promoter said could still if each paid $50   price guys $125   Um no thank you   lot more $50 nightclub Vegas   always gotten into other Vegas night clubs free   friends assumed getting guest list day advance would ensure that   But nope apparently does not  Some ended leaving 3 friends decided suck stay   wait line additional 1 5 hours left didn't actually until around 1 30am   did watch some Calvin Harris' performance but only hour two   Definitely worth $50 per person!  glad decided leave and lot others line made same decision made    We ended going elsewhere   doubt I'd try visit again place disorganized guests really treated courtesy  <EOR> The bf holds relatively deep resentment club trying guide blacked out down 4 narrow flights stairs   I thought remembered entire night Hakkasan until realized huge lapse memory and enough pictures taken     guess 3 LC's   Hits * Cool beautiful crowd    remember * Great staff  heart to heart security guard manning entrance line while waiting promoter * Spacious restaurant club 5 floors  3 dedicated nightclub Hip Hop room floor #3 EDM room floors #4 5 * Don't remember part but heard CO2 effects made lasers look really cool blew down directly crowd    glad didn't pass it * Decent drink prices Vegas nightclubs  $16 LC's much better EBC's $23 vodka red bulls * Instant entrance those pre sale tickets  boys waited good 15 minutes while getting promoter situation straightened out  Lessons Learned * Dance floor small club many tables much dead space between tables  guess club designed promote booking tables    wish $8k shell table dance floor * No sitting leaning against railing! Unless wanna yelled security  * million stairs  wear sexy but comfy shoes heels  I'll come back consciously experience club again  <EOR> Don't wrong amazing dj's ONLY thing place    This place always overpacked crowded  should limit many people allow inside because literally feel pack sardines    There absolutely NO space dance    The only way really enjoy yourself if reserve table which course expensive  only way would ever come back   If decide come guestlist crap  recommend buying presale tickets instead arrive before 11 30 because place gets pack around 12am    Since place packed suggest staying spot entire night because easily taken if leave buy drink take bathroom break  friends save spot you    If plan being floor recommend being front middle group friends avoid people going getting your way if stay very back  really frustrating entire night  <EOR> We presale tickets line moving along well but god damn prepared ID ed least 2 3 times! venue interior designed amazingly!!! Everything looked different compared pictures took place! various floors attend but main floor small crowded maybe cause all tables surrounded it!  I give place 3 stars because DJ night basically played same over over! Everyone waiting Dada Life but he didnt come until almost 2am when he suppose midnight = everyone exhausted then   Girls watch your purses  Two friends phones stolen friend almost did! <EOR> Ok  talking about  place exceeded expectations  Sorry haven't updated review sooner   bf back weekend Jan 17 Ailyne H birthday  VIP list  immediately called contact let know outside club   She quickly greeted escorted entrance club next thing know inside no wait complimentary drink tickets hands  SCORE!

Haha chocolate waisted    The BF agreed place bad all  come back? Probably yes! Oh now outs which complain last time   The dance floor super packed  expect its Vegas all   Vegas knows party! <EOR> Overly crowded taste whatsoever  let anyone long breathing  EDM ok times but stuff playing just horrible  Tiesto supposed which why wanted go  already 1 30am tired waiting come decided just leave  Thankfully did pay because worth it  many guards aren't even allowed stand anywhere  very disorganized  hyped because new Tiesto resident there  wouldn't come again  <EOR> Way oversold  place nothing write home about  Drinks entirely overpriced $60 2 drinks 2 tap waters  curious optimistic! But left entirely disappointed  Staff confiscate any outside food drink even if sealed  management condescending inconsiderate  Don't waste your time  <EOR> Drinks SUCK here  They're really really pathetic  Every time new drink hand could tell bartenders really light handed cocktails  <EOR> Hakkasan left unimpressed  supposed world class club some incredible resident DJs expected much more   It over crowded lights sound quality just average check in process haphazard   I thrilled see Tiesto but club itself bit letdown  <EOR> I vegas few nights ago decided try hakkasan  friends knew someone could supposedly in   walked right front   showed guy door ID which should mention 4 years ago before colored hair   also hawaii obviously questioned because horrible superbad movie ID  first guy asked another form ID all debit card but told school state ID room  handing ID 4 different guys decided ask questions  asked when birthday year graduated high school old when graduated high school address   Obviously answered every question correctly   because really me   Then handed ID said can't help   spent much money come vegas 21st birthday such disappointment   spent much money staying MGM drinking eating gambling could in  Hakkasan unprofessional don't recomend anyone going there  Take your money elsewhere you'll much better time  <EOR> I fun Hakkasan but only because Tiesto performing night thoroughly enjoyed set  Other would rate experience meh  just stupid crowded everywhere went  can't walk without grinding other people just standing looking right eye making things super awkward your balls brushing against ass something      While trying find good spot camp where unobstructed view stage constantly shooed away security guards flash lights shooing away annoying fly  Here's crazy thing LOTs other people standing places blocking doorways walkways didn't shoo those other people away  Sure shoo away good looking people! Lol  place huge fire hazard if ever one!   Drinks mad expensive expected any place Vegas isn't casino    All all other reviewers said experience it  If you're going see Tiesto Calvin Harris you'll good time  listening sets but everything else     ehhhh let judge    <EOR> Beautiful night club BUT       definitely fun coming here  Seattle came twice  first time girlfriends second time friends boyfriend  Both times club SUPER packed suppose good thing right? But absolutely not! dance floor small many people constantly pushing each other spilling drinks stepping all over your poor feet ouch if you're girl heels sandals kind sausage fest club well lol   I would never pay club let alone any club but especially because just worth it  no room space enjoy music! drinks way over priced too  Two Coronas $24?

Vegas you're killing me    Definitely dress impress wait takes forever because take elevators up  booth if otherwise don't bother wasting your time here! <EOR> A good hospitality experience feels warm welcoming puts free space making easy forget any inhibitions enjoy yourself   Unfortunately Hakkasan hasn't 2 times there  extent experience includes table bottle service both times spent whole night venue friends being observing atmosphere   A consistent 90% interactions staff left impression could care less at best   Several interactions both experienced myself observed security forceful bordering violent totally uncalled senerios telling people where stand ect  But then totally missed boat others failing keep random drunk dudes table letting people smoke dance floor    The bottle service girls okay always good positive experience bathroom concierge saving grace    Over all experience staff very unfortunate contracted  know hard job dealing drunk people violently loud mess chaos every night but plenty nightclubs right  Save yourself some time skip Hakkasan  <EOR> Hakkasan Nightclub gets three stars go go dancers awesome DJ 12 30 2017  Those ladies work hard really know put show    I've visited Hakkasan three separate occasions every time its only dance floor open  read reviews friends told freedom different rooms club enjoy variety music but never experienced it  Every time they're always closed   The floor visited nice but crowded quick  plenty light around bar area see dance floor always lit nicely   bartenders awesome!   Drink prices range $15 beer $20 $25 Jameson coke  guess all depends night   VIP tables available great view dance floor personal server refill drinks etc but why confined area when dance floor    All all experience Hakkasan okay  would explore other 2 rooms but great time friends  <EOR> Why impressed why won't back   I am impressed magnitude scale spectacle place   truly spectacular worth visit just see   times felt watching live concert big name DJ times felt watching lot people popping Mollies while watching live concert big name DJ times just caught myself looking around sea people 4th 5th floors   Seriously many people does place hold?  5 000? 10 000??  couldn't really tell   So why won't come back?  Simply put just don't feel safe place   Here's deal am sure Las Vegas nightclubs codes regulations wazzoo Hakkasan folks followed them T   being said scale magnitude never seen before   think own common sense observation main floor if something wrong would lot trouble trying way exit along deluge humanity enclosed space   light show made wonder risk fire amount people space made realize weren't searched security when came idiot gun away chaos   Maybe am completely paranoid but really thought just based common sense could easily end dangerous situation place   So all all glad once seen Vegas one itself once again but think I'd very apprehensive risk going back  <EOR> Went some friends see Calvin Harris   really into clubs no clue Hakkasan Calvin Harris was   No table bottle service   My buddy bought presale tickets line less 20 minutes   agree other reviewers when say if don't stuff together ahead time expect long wait   unreasonable roll general admission newest clubs Vegas expect wait long time   The club itself dark cavernous full stairwells   lost couple times but overall club pretty pleasing eye   If you're good stairs don't recommend place you   Calvin Harris started 1AM till no idea when   left 2 30 going assume he did thing till 4   DJ booth elevated over main stage balcony type thing above it   DUring parts set dancers would come some crazy cirque du soleil shit   Overall pretty entertained 4 hours   still ringing right ear though   The crowd fairly diverse but probably leans more affluent douchier demographic   When Calvin Harris turn tables everyone into music energy high pus   Read review some bias since very little compare to   If you're club aficionado apologize being 23 year old chicken head  <EOR> I came Calvin Harris show Sat Feb 15   Fergie dj opened him   other reviews say   lots stairs haha   lots fun!! Calvin didn't come til 1 30 am think   really late night but awesome overall   A couple negatives Overpriced drinks    overheard girls front ordering 2 drinks think said $35  drank beer think $10 each maybe  Also pretty sexist Calvin tickets more double cost guys girls!  Even couple negatives still amazing time would recommend anyone   but you'll splurge bit! <EOR> Hakkasan!  fortunate enough night club huge work event   all say if love dance great time then need try Hakkasan!  BLAST!   ears still ringing!  DJ staff awesome! <EOR> Too many bros here! Serious cockfest guys also annoying kill vibe! <EOR> Hakkasan does better lighting Marquee meaning does blast into your eyes but music still could better! <EOR> If could give Hakkasan 0 stars would   My disappointment Hakkasan due clubbing experience layout price drinks  Nope all around amazing time Hakkasan during recent Vegas trip  1 star rating due being misled bottle service Marketing professionals refer Z  group paid total $150 00 advance tickets Hakkasan Sunday January 29  Upon arrival met Z tried persuade into buying upgraded bottle service  small group but didn't mind paying premium better experience  Chinese New Years all some extra cash Vegas whynot? But since already paid $150 asked if amount could towards table service bill see text   Z said no but suggested definitively could refund tickets  Based information chose bottle service   The following week contacted Hakkasan customer service ask refund  request denied even showing representative text Z  some back forth agent finally offered provide comp tickets next visit but insisted refund  agent reminded non refundable policy adamant giving refund despite evidence intentionally misled    And because story ended am giving Hakkasan 1 star never patronize business again   I don't want sound petty but am writing review based principal  $150 really just drop bucket considering fact spent $2k evening would selected upgraded bottle service even if Z did suggest refund  message Hakkasan management = understand Vegas nightlife competitive but your agents should resort unethical misleading practices hit quota  <EOR> As 44 yr old guy grew 80's advent electronic music 20's ushered Rave movement enjoy EDM  myself looking hip hi nrg posh nightclub where could just enjoy music ambience  Hakkasan didn't dissapoint    You come right attitude  Expect pay lot drinks expect ass elbows dance floor expect pay expensive cover charge  Also expect awesome lazer light show changes your whole perception room  Expect some good fog machines skilled dj's   This place exactly expected well worth couple 100 spent there  left early but enjoyed every minute experience  When old knees tired plenty places away crowd  definate must see if want enjoy some relevant music without pain hip hop top 40  <EOR> Nope  once bad experience  People work RUDE gets wayyyyyy crowded  Sorry but just into it  tempted back nights Tiesto Above Beyond playing but never talk myself into it  Don't waste your time here  <EOR> I rarely clubbing pretty much first time clubbing huge place vegas!  must say pretty big place gazillion stories!!!  friends ran into some promoter he hooked 7 girls free tickets   only catch 10 30pm!  luckily made time 5 minutes spare running Thunder Down Under Excalibur MGM   waited guestlist line    and wasn't bad   waited total 15 minutes     Be prepared  LOTS STAIRS!!  inside still pretty dead but minutes passed super crowded   stayed mainly hip hop room because way packed everywhere else   girls actually walked stairs danced platform!!  Way better being down crowded touching sweaty people!  Dancing platforms gave lot room dance around basically first come first serve basis   Drinks pretty expensive which typical wouldn't complain that   pre gaming for!!  Overall great night great drunken memories!  NOTE Invest Dr  Sholl's Fast Flats!  You'll need it! <EOR> My friends Hakkasan MDW see Deadmau5  friends works said he could group gratis  When arrived guy told lone male group cover charge $100 dollars damn! He paid he going do less 15 minutes  The place swanky! Yes ton stairs but luckily planned outfit accordingly wearing flats  group love dancing till wee hours knew come prepared    We around 11ish danced while before deciding bathroom  point weren't letting anybody else dance floor made point reach employees standing guard leaving he said sure no problem   We didn't realize but Steve Aoki going first before Deadmau5  heard Aoki but since clubbing EDM really scene didn't know expect  Holy cow guy crazy! He really knows work crowd! He threw cakes ground rode around raft crowd carrying sprayed champagne all over place     glad front  He also great light show cool dancers him  tell lot thought into performance  just read even servers outfits designed him  also played some crazy videos partying felt watching Behind Music Guns N Roses  Without doubt DJ's new rock stars    Deadmau5 came 4 he started kind slow  all kind pumped Aoki's antics took people while going again  left little 5 feet super tired but very happy  surprised much enjoyed myself  would definitely return see Aoki  <EOR> DON'T HAKKASAN! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! WORTH IT! WASTE TIME MONEY! I wish negative stars give     5 5 13 Cinco De Mayo see Tiesto experience Horrible beginning lot ass hole bouncers don't really know job right chubby short white bouncer checking ID California's Driver's license he didn't THINK valid!! he tried act all tough smart ass front ticket girls he wanted see another ID didn't want give another ID because he didn't any sense he asked step outside asked boss then manager let right away he saw ID he even asked bouncer what's your problem     That just beginning then going inside stairs 2 levels sure fun everybody buzz specially girls high heels then inside club different story club small all advertising DJ line those DJS deserve better venue no matter where won't able see DJ unless made dance floor through all squished people mostly made bottle service tables all around club can't stand anywhere see whoever spinning unless dance floor dance floor super packed point can't move muscle dance bouncers keep pushing people keep them off bottle service tables!!  couldn't stay dance floor more 5 mins then anywhere  there's bouncer asking keep walking where didn't know second floor though might better place see Tiesto spinning but also all surrounded bottle service tables also second levels speakers weren't working!! only listen music playing main floor!!  I also cigar asked put saying can't smoke cigars but smoke cigarrettes!! never seen heard something any where world!! Even Tiesto when he stage he didn't look happy all probably cause he stuck residency without really knowing he getting himself to    Tiesto different Venues Vegas LA hes always smiling good mood club way CROWDED anybody enjoy guess even Tiesto himself   couldn't stay more hour then friends left   So far nothing beats XS Marquee   I'd never back Hakkasan even if free!!  bad experience was!! <EOR> Honestly impressed especially prices charge smh would rather spend $$ Tao Tryst  house head type venue should blowing mind!!!

Bullsh*t! <EOR> Hakkasan hell lineup terms DJ residencies club beautiful but space just way small shove ridiculous amount  people there  definitely huge fire hazard    I've club three times now  for Dada Life Tiesto Calvin Harris  Long story short unless table your experience pretty much pushing your way through anywhere being pushed whilst defending your standing space  point literally pinned middle crowd people walkway damn herd cows  also pretty miserable ladies because unless roll flats like that'll happen come 10pm willing stand your pumps until headlining DJ comes 1 30am you're gunna crappy spot likely back club off sides  hip hop room just packed lower ceilings    Don't wrong doesn't sound unlike any other clubs Vegas but if Hakkasan gunna #1 club city need work spacing issue  <EOR> The security extremely rude doing something  sketch shove crowd tell MOVE literally rude avoid place free but still felt owed refund time  Marquee instead <EOR> I'll keep short but rude management    Just 4 girls through Guestlist line really fast once ID check  when horrible  very rude bouncer checks friend's ID does believe hers  friend 24 am other 2 friends 25  WTF?

Freaking ridiculous    I heard such horrible things friends recently coming here  If want keep business successful better management  <EOR> Honestly prettiest club ever too  Also some best Djs there   personally don't mind crowds  However if claustrophobic watch its super crowded there! <EOR> SO saw Illenium Hakkasan 08 06 17 man great night!  Hakkasan MGM Grand hot spot many big name DJs   entrance usually somewhere around $50 men $30 women unless guest list which requires early around 10 30     However if buy VIP ticket costs $100 entrance but give gift card $100 bar basically free!  thought great deal!  venue itself great Illenium put great show   limited people dance floor wasn't packed many places could really great time!  great experience definitely returning when favorite DJs playing there! <EOR> [Note review DJ Moby Sat  Feb  8th ]  Coming into Hakkasan interesting experience   hand club lot going but attitudes tight space may turn off     That isn't say everyone outright mean   staff super friendly at least beginning night helpful people off dance floor bad most part getting wasn't much pain pre paid ticket $30 guys    complaints people come into some really pushy guys girls along just some mean spirited acts   instance guys come saw someone front 'dropped pencil' routine try fondle girl behind   classy cool giving bad rep all guys there   volume music way pretty loud aware if sensitive ears   Additionally drink costs course high always note don't serve tap water buy bottle $9  [thumbs down]  other note dance floor really tight   Expect squished your feet stepped upon no matter careful are   Also take care your belongings cases     So all cons what's left?  think where counts Hakkasan pretty amazing   Big kudos DJ Moby he much energy where he gets top DJ booth people hyped sounds your face bold   Bigger props Mark Etson DJ before Moby really held fort down   many clubs where first DJ trouble establishing much groove excitement but Mark handled time main act   Even though exhausted end night experience dance floor worth it   probably also helped smart lighting 'living ceiling' which seems lights protrude ceiling blood vessels couldn't think better analogy    There's also few other floors supposedly night only Ling Ling Room hip hop there   Smaller dance floor atmosphere very very different but cool see contrast gives options versus some other clubs     I did think Hakkasan little pretentious begin space area stairs elevators reminded Marquee dance floor squished people around aren't exactly friendliest bunch   However music atmosphere aesthetics really made where counted  <EOR> If could would give ZERO stars  Female manager rude helpful despite informing contacted guest list     attempted talk but VERY off standish <EOR> I totally loved place  Hakkasan first night Vegas Thursday 1am no line 20 dollar cover Tommy Trash performing  crowd little overwhelming especially boys can't handle partying very disrespectful  But venue itself lights screen dancers DJ booth tables amazing  next night table Laidback Luke Amaris Arthur handlers service GREAT!

Hope you've working stairclimber gym!  And final warning hold tight those purses constantly check your pockets  Pickpocketing still rampant here  friend's two friends both noticed purses open phones gone just past weekend   The only thing good Hakkasan MGM good DJs residencies always party if nothing your pockets some rando steal  <EOR> Terrible experience here! Let's start off ridiculous long unorganized lines  Waited long just told couldn't because didn't look myself drivers license  wanted something else name showed them debit card  enough made write signature six times  Nothing! Very unprofessional bouncers rude no respect women walking in  would literally extremely obvious checking them out  even bent head really low look under girl's shirt dress! Anyways prepared take every form identification own  You'll need it  <EOR> This place few levels which pretty cool  feel club more bars others least drink way faster other places!  The drinks pricey but expect?

XS still favorite club though but place considered would love coming back party at  <EOR> Saturday Deadmau5  Here observations Extremely hard walk inside many people see DJ better table cost least 3500 dollars 21 dollars drink If women can't walk high hills all night forget no place seat unless table Next time XS older place but 20 times better  <EOR> Even though checked everyone's reviews Yelp opinions friends check Hakkasan myself  didn't really any trouble line because host came check guest list  escorted fairly quickly snake like line through casino    It probably only 10 30 when arrived fairly empty  visiting Vegas many times accustomed being offered drink tickets open bar but none here  friends felt hiking all stairs inside thought going fall off   Once little more crowded music didn't any better  check hip hop room since prefer music over EDM but lounge tiny since main hip hop room closed  no room dance all ratchets around us    We left around 12 back XS did regret all  <EOR> Just wanted update review apologetic response Hakkasan management  Though service night definitely poor hand team reaching personally everyone complains  huge customer service girl meant lot me  Hopefully chance return experience improved much they'll couple more stars top two! <EOR> I'm big clubbing but husband wanted come birthday see Tiesto decided check out  would say first half night five star experience  lines super organized which really come appreciate going other clubs strip  free thanks promoter found great spot dance floor  music great danced least couple hours no problems  However once little later club became completely packed  couldn't move anymore  Maybe NV doesn't same kind fire safety laws CA because all kinds fire hazards going on    We stayed dance floor long possible because really wanted Tiesto but became unbearable  club decided good idea throw bracelets into crowd when full capacity people jumping all over place trying catch them  very large man landed foot jumping shortly hit top head twice  pain much off dance floor which near impossible  literally elbow people through  Once back stairs shove people even more  awful  if seriously injured? really disappointed way night ended because having much fun  ended going higher levels watching Tiesto 10 minutes  Definitely bummer    Coming catch 22 if want see headlining DJ night  early hold your spot dance floor long possible wait til later when lines long fight even down stairs  sure if we'll back  If we'll leave before 1am don't trapped overcrowded dance floor which sucks because main DJ doesn't come til 1  <EOR> I long ago  place huge  Calvin Harris playing man sound great! again sure  Five stars! <EOR> $9 bottle water   Enough said   This place way overpriced crowded worth long wait in  <EOR> Went Thursday definitely latest mega club Vegas!

No  Way   Note Hakkasan Management August 9th   may wish discuss young lady lack professionalism non existent customer service skills  <EOR> First time club last night! Omgosh love club already  Calvin Harris awesome! He's pretty  Dance floor kind small but alright  super great time  Awesome nice people minus maybe hand full  We're all just trying good time   Great ending bachlorette party weekend  <EOR> I insisted coming Hakkasan see Tiesto  Little did know he literally plays 1 30am  an hour half before closing    My group promoter's guestlist   but when arrived MGM line absolutely ridiculous  Another promoter approached offered put different line pay reduced cover wait very long  group 3 girls 1 guy paid $120 in  opinion wasn't worth because inside club literally clusterf***  club multiple floors literally just pack many people everywhere just plain uncomfortable  back  <EOR> After reading all stories building club finally past Sunday group 7 friends  host Thomas Gorman previously helped other AMG establishments Pure really above beyond hosting group great table location elevated dance floor table central all action    We arrived little earlier usually Vegas club around 11 but club already buzzing  midnight place packed everyone having great time  R3hab spinning night  Both set accompanying light show impressive    Because Sunday Ling Ling room open only able check main room  dance floor huge definitely bigger Marquee although packed traffic seemed flow better some other clubs  know some people complained crowds but I'd rather packed club moderately full especially if booth own space invite people over drinks     I tend visit Vegas least every other month  Hakkasan definitely added rotation clubs future  <EOR> Went second time much better time first  Its beautiful club time staff definitely more friendly   I would still recommend Hakkasan some non VIP seating but maybe its because Im getting old feet hurting  <EOR> One favorite spots Vegas  Bouncers professional venue awesome girls beautiful  Bartenders hit miss quickness bathrooms very clean lights sound sweet   I recommend going if your staying MGM nearby  Take advantage promoters guest list oppurtunities saved friends lot money  Tickets range $50 $150 easy    <EOR> I stoked heard much club huge pretty nice  June weekend tiesto playing  group 8 girls  promoter hooked all free guest list  Most people know pay $50 door  yay more money drinks    We 8 shots which came $145 which quiet pricey but didn't complain because all free  first down stairs hip hop room which pretty average size big  kind started getting crowded main stage where Tiesto play  early started drinking getting buzz on   The main stage huge but Tiesto only coming 1 which quiet late expected earlier  when he actually show way passed 1  kinda mad because half girls super tired wanted leave   ** Biggest down fall place amount stairs have  Its really good idea many stairs club especially when people drunk would trip hurt  would extra careful just because girls all wear such high heels  Its definitely safest club there   I wasn't much love place but would definitely back if any amazing djs play  sucker house music love djs <EOR> Went last weekend man excited! Vegas friend's birthday he did great job pumping R3hab which I'd never seen before    The 1 star due atmosphere  We're thirsty little while bar ask cup water  We're informed club doesn't if want water spend $9 300mL bottle Fiji water  drank some water tap bathroom attendant threatened kick out   for drinking water!!   I talked some bouncers every single them looked unhappy sounded unhappy  told only 10 min breaks no lunch just stand 8 hours  apparently don't free water either    I'm sure lot fun but treat patrons staff alike abominable  Marquee magnificent staff actually smiles all water possibly want! <EOR> I beg differ negative reviews Here's two cents Music no doubt mind Hakkasan best residents DJ's game right now Calvin Harris Hardwell Steve Aoki just some many play there  came two weeks ago Bingo Players definitely happy camper  Although he well known others he played really good set! However also want commend Eva Shaw set well  She DJ prior Bingo Players she good confused work Bingo Players point  Overall really happy music aspect      Venue dance floor pretty cramped others said does feel packed sardines  But if stand towards back where tables then should more room dance   Wait time Guest list promoter particular very accommodating into club no problem! promoter recommended arrived group 10pm line actually moving steady pace  think able within first 30 minutes club opening  *** Guest list line near Rainforest Cafe*** Bouncers Security Let warn advance security HESITATE throw kick line if drunk! Enough said   However appreciate fact cut some slack let re enter line club specified time  group particular sit outside hour before allowed re enter line   Although know club lot mixed reviews still think worth giving before throwing towel! <EOR> Hakkasan! Hottest Nightclub Vegas where well known DJs house residents!  We came Thursday night knowing Hardwell would spinning tracks unfortunately only able table 3rd floor instead 5th floor main floor all big name DJs play   hostesses extremely friendly bussers bust butts  cranberry pineapple juice sprite never low close empty re filled quickly  security attentive but chill laid back long shit didn't happen   Upstairs 5th floor hardcore! Don't expect much standing room mainly designed bottle service! You're Vegas hot nightclubs Hakkasan expects wants drop dough $$! Unfortunately didn't stay long since table downstairs bottles waiting drank!

I don't exact number but spoke least 20 girls pick pocketed past Saturday night 6 which group friends many lost such valuables cell phones wallets including IDs which means Vegas hopes dreams pretty much sunk soon ROBBED under watch Hakkasan Management   Anyways know shot dark may never even read but off chance PLEASE bring attention Hakkasan management type thing doesn't happen again  just don't want thieves running around Las Vegas ruining anyone's good time    Thanks listening keep making beautiful music   YOU MAN!  Love Mike <EOR> Want great time Vegas? Look Omnia XS   For nightclub supposed all rage top headliners Hakkasan falls short  Sure Hakkasan great lighting frequently great DJ's there  But point nightclub if don't space dance good drinks decent customer service?  After going few times evident promoters bouncers emphasize importance getting early avoid being turned away due reaching capacity  couldn't farther truth  If want nightclub fire hazard then Hakkasan place you  always super SUPER packed  exception few groups managed table no room dance breathe without interjecting yourself into someone else's personal space   That said point paying $40 cocktail if bartender doesn't even know he doing? Worst experience asked 2 AMF's a very well known drink every reputable bartender should know instead serving drink made different alcohols the whole definition Adios Mother F's bartender thought okay poor bit 1 vodka splash juice top off curacao gives blue color call day  Excuse but what? yes still audacity charge AMF    To add Hakkasan experience bouncers venue always sure disrespectful guests even when VIP   some odd reason gentlemen forget paid specific job happens include providing customer service  behooves why respectable resort MGM would employ individuals more interested looking good each other doing good job making good impression guests   If can't resist want see fuss all sure grab cocktail beforehand  You'll need it  <EOR> Sad ghetto club! crumbs Vegas world illlegal bouncers hungry buck pathetic  If poor budget your shit hole <EOR> Not sure why everyone complaining lines just grab set presales you'll ok even if don't know promoters  could see place being amazing if still early twenties but there's only much house music person take before gets repetitive    That said Hakk great venue lose star due smallish dance floor main room definitely vegas thing   Tables private booths fun but chasing off bottle vultures chore sometimes  Biggest Protip? Cash tip grease your security guard hostess BEFORE come your bottle prompt attentive service   Not sure if back again since already seen entire 2015 roster care Hardwell Harris Tiesto Nervo but wouldn't worst thing world if return  <EOR> A really nice club cool lighting few different rooms explore  However just small cramped large crowds let in  you barely move dancefloors constant struggle stay afloat people bump into every few seconds  Merp!  We free discount promoter early but still wait long time deal hella lines in   expected such popular club sure but usually don't such long wait Marquee   Pauly D DJs lot does excite anyone? <EOR> Probably dumbest clubs ever in  front door guy said could pay back entrance people skip line which did  hour packed move guess some girl jealous guy standing next friends accused being prostitutes kicked club!  I can't say anything else club since packed even move around didn't any tables buy  next <EOR> Finally made over Hakkasan trip! pregamed over Centifuge which next club highly recommended! expensive once inside club   purchased tickets online just presale line 7th line! scanned tickets phones then checked IDs  guy checked ID made smile because picture no glasses long hair now glasses medium length hair  Mind ID says corrective lenses but okay   luckily once smiled he whatever stamped wrist  let 10 45 club officially opens 10 30 Sunday's actually first people club good look club itself! take elevator main level let off  Walk DJ center surrounded dance floor smaller booth VIP areas  honestly beautiful club awe  DJ looked fake Calvin Harris wish but he doing show elsewhere moment played amazing tracks! air blowers confetti crazy lights  towards front people pretty fun until 1am! crowds worse bouncers literally blocked only exit through sides  Many people pregamed super thrashed  People starting buying drinks which avoided because little expensive! $25 small shot glass sized mixed drink  worth it! Unless you're doing bottle service avoid it! Bottle service ranges $1k all way $10k believe depends promotors where sit  really worth because unless stand table can't see  bathroom well wanted check rest club only way walk through VIP tables sides  best friend literally many people trying stop wasted them  stopped maybe pimp   he's join table! just kept walking  finally made bathroom attendants try sell flats $25 credit card no debit even though run debit card credit $20 cash! cheap fold flats usually cost $10 711 party store bring your own they don't check bags coat check ask if other options! cheap sandals few bucks tip! couldn't hip hop room cause couldn't find upstairs side lounge strictly VIP more tables main level   The main reason why leaving review 4 stars because bouncers! least bit helpful should've thrown thrashed people just managed crowd better  thrashed mean people falling over those looking gone puke  actually let those people club which no no  usually okay if thrashed club but actually allowing people crazy  people didn't really show until 1am Above Beyond still hadn't come on  Because wild left 1 30am  bouncers weren't able really direct if question where something was  just said keep moving! also fenced ropes main floor pain  nicer when enter club but inside rude   We stayed while such blast!!! But recommend getting super early! Great music overall! Would love see Calvin Harris honestly stick that! <EOR> Take party girl Hakkasan Vegas' commuter club  check because new some awesome DJ then leave when realize great  Amazing DJs but club itself ergonomic fail design    Unless you've bought VIP table club probably isn't you  Guys you'll good time  Girls don't much  most Vegas clubs where random people meet start drinking together  club setup inviting experience    My 4 girlfriends Tiesto last Friday  Tiesto amazing best sets heard him!    but ended leaving club before close which never do because Hakkasan itself  girls live stuff wish wish could said something good it     Where fails 1 missing experience   When walk through Hakkasan most people walk aren`t smiling weird  reason experience missing  Everyone club should able experience ambience atmosphere everyone partying having good time  Hakkasan doesn't offer this  Unless you're VIP table willing smothered sweaty bodies waaayyy over packed dancefloor enjoyable clubbing experience because can't see anything! can't see DJ main room because design layout you'll stuck wandering paths dancing overflow area    2 You're always looking down because can't feel comfortable walking around   First there's many stairs random levels  Second overflow room raised platforms visible crowds  result many girls taking tumble because poor design lack  area guards bouncers didn't anything it  ridiculous  Third floor pattern misleading gives illusion white steps when not  girls kept thinking steps felt always cautious    3 If you're VIP you'll feel second class citizen  girls we're usually used being treated well Vegas clubs but because Hakkasan isn't designed mingling meeting new people girls left behind    without view DJ not even TV screen anywhere without single place sit wandering around aimlessly  result leave  Hakkasan known girls leaving  staff know why Vegas commuter club   It doesn't offer glamorous Vegas nightclub experience really disappointing   Here's some suggestions better TO HAKKASAN OWNERS 1 Overflow Room  room offers no experience  remember people come DJs even if they're main danceroom need give them experience  Add massive LCD screen showing DJ playing along side balcony  Also can't girls falling all over place! Add barriers corner areas platform safety    2 Waterfall back area  need let girls sit otherwise leave  idea people pay sit club but just ridiculous  need let girls rest feet sometimes  Marqui allows certain areas should you!   3 Upstairs small suggestion  If you're VIP noooo experience therefore waste space  Give people experience  Add some small LCD TVs everywhere people feel DJ  People create own fun front TVs     4 Upstairs big suggestion  Because openings VIP booths opposite DJ stage guys VIP facing DJ stage  Therefore when girls walking behind they'll never noticed  think another tier few steps lower VIP area should wrapped front non VIPs  way guys VIP physically see girls tell them join them they'll feel more VIP more people seeing them  Also regular people actually view    5 Dancefloor  Having 2 entrances dancefloor ends stage inconvenient exiting  Add two more paths enter dancefloor Marqui    These problems may seem petty but Vegas exactly all about  Someone s missed mark here  Hakkasan needs some work big time  won't back unless something changes  <EOR> It's gorgeous club no doubt that  But amount people packed into place completely INSANE can't safe  Couldn't even move dance floor sweaty drunk people rubbing me    YUCK    Be prepared walk 5 flights stairs 6 inch heels just enter wait 20 mins damn elevator   Since no seems mention DRESS IMPRESS!  might if don't but you'll feel place  98% people dressed nines  Seemed good mix people 25ish late 40s   Bottle service over 1k people swarm your booth once DJ set starts  sure if ever come back    Well maybe  Some DJs absolutely amazing all worth it! <EOR> Considering level rude most club employees isn't bad  Perhaps Golden State Warriors outfit made security little friendlier usual  Same inside bouncers waitresses  seemed calmed down request people continuously walk around circles instead leaning against area tucked away  only complaint dance floor  clostrophonic seems though way way out  if dance floor just know you're awhile  <EOR> It's huge nightclub lot space but course made dance floor super small  lights dance floor nice  most said stairs everywhere  Even though there's bouncer flashlight still pretty brutal especially end night  least there's elevator takes directly exit  don't see best club Vegas prefer some outdoor air breathe  <EOR> came calvin harris night presale tickets $75+fees online   this place lacks outside area where chill talk  wasn't worth hype  <EOR> Crappy music  Rude body guards  Drinks barely contain any alcohol  Lame  would definitely recommend changing DJ  potential  <EOR> Good If pre pay tickets line very quick non existent   Nice Hip Hop Room but small  If you're trying some exercise two stairways climb main room   Feel bad girls high heels   Bad expecting main room epic terms space but same size dance floor any other club   wanted something size relative Rain Nightclub but same ole crap   club last   EDM crowd when don't capacity it   Half ppl dance floor probably don't EDM     On thursday Hip Hop room closed around midnight wtf   does that? said would take 5 6 years pay club off say club close less 3    Look stars ppl many ppl hate place  <EOR> I'm local first time night club friend blast! <EOR> Went clubbing Sat night waited 2 hours just inside freaking club _ guest list 7 girls 1guy although everyone free wait just ridiculous  tried contact promoter but he just didn't respond    Once inside all saw guys everywhere   point guy even asked if he gay club  Oh crowded point where couldn't even dance floor each level  Then fight broke party decided leave span 30 mins?    Wish didn't happen especially being friends 21st  <EOR> 1  Unorganized 2  Workers rude unprofessional 3  crowded  When first arrived whole thing totally unorganized! many guest list tickets given which made event overly crowded  guy checked ID also didn't believe photo ask someone else  When OTHER guy approved immediately turned around saw he did several other girls well    C'mon trying check them give them hard time purpose? POOR work ethic dude  he's just really bad job    After getting into venue admit pretty big due different floors one star that but won't fully enjoy if can't even access dance floor because crowded is  Unless bottle service think twice coming here! <EOR> Sorry no love Hakkasan    it Vegas way better sources entertainment clubbing Hakkasan     After numerous failed attempts clubbing finally chance club Hakkasan Easter weekend 2015 close two years trying here   recall ever hearing anyone say good thing Hakkasan besides awesome dj's pull   could all bad right?

which less crowded blast  don't think back hakkasan if don't need to! worth it! <EOR> I've Hakkasan twice two very different experiences  Unfortunately worst most recent believe club gone downhill quite bit since first visit   I Hakkasan see Calvin Harris New Year's Eve 2014 2015 three other women  started line regular tickets but almost immediately singled ushered into VIP line right away  Calvin Harris amazing Hakkasan put great New Year's show midnight  Plus while crowded wasn't insanely so   Fast forward past weekend when see Chainsmokers Hakkasan  Three two girls guy bought VIP bar card tickets other three one girl two guys just regular admission tickets  basically cattle call into club took least 20 minutes find someone would even tell where needed bar cards  Along way talked two hosts INSANELY rude  only helpful blonde guy  rude ones even yelled group move way   when stuck behind crowd people moving  honestly never treated awfully club Vegas before alone won't back Hakkasan   The funniest part despite VIP entry those VIP into club maybe five minutes before friends didn't it  bar card made worth opinion but still frustrating obnoxious  didn't big problem getting drinks bar but dance floor crowded couldn't even anywhere near it  Thankfully open area back club allowed stand around dance together but wasn't same actually SEEING Chainsmokers which again never because couldn't within twenty feet dance floor and trust tried   definitely more crowded New Year's Eve honest think way many people club general   On top wow bathrooms hard find doors aren't lit ALL  back Hakkasan because good first experience but don't think giving third chance mess  <EOR> You know saying everything better when free?  Well say did apply visit Hakkasan Thursday night   Free bottle service   oh perks having friends Vegas know people   But heard mixed reviews place little skeptical even perk   Lines definitely long even bottle service line long but may because club doesn't start letting people until 11   then pretty easy breezy that   Hakkasan beautiful music great Daddalife Fergie DJ staff awesome   bottle service girl sweet staff attentive definitely kept checking replace mixes take away empty glasses   noticed more Body English Tao must say where experienced kinda shared bottle service experience   Also ladies loved guys stairs would shine light could see where your going your walking down them offer hand well   this should must every club!  DJ line amazing must say   XS Marquee stiff competition   I've Hakkasan SF just restaurant obviously must say just Hakkasan Vegas clubbing skip overpriced Asian fusion food   hope next experience just great even without bottle service  <EOR> On weeknight allowed because said shoes weren't right  some reason bouncer wrote down name date birth refused give explanation paper he wrote on  Beware shady staff  Identity theft? <EOR> As vegas local far very least favourite night club all vegas   I remember being invited opening night if years back believe 2013 It madhouse lost everyone's reservations   I recognise everyone showed everyone Las Vegas but no could tables because everything chaotic everything lost That only first time eventually did but only stayed 20 minutes  The last time just cesspool ugly people tourists music absolutely terrible   I think mainly part because located NGM now charge parking valet but everywhere hotel huge just club your feet going kill going wait huge long line doesn't matter if table some reason very picky let in   So always good hour just place very disappointed   Any time friends say want always meet them afterwards drains elsewhere  I just never good time club between people way run just crappy  think drinks way overpriced comparison other nightclubs Las Vegas don't know place still running  <EOR> A nightclub experience girls made fun classy night remember   The layout place awesome  When elevators door open walk into main room its POPPIN'   ventured into different rooms blast hip hop room awhile  room small but music fun oldschool brought back many memories!   As night progressed met friends table upstairs looking DJ  could see entire club dance floor perfect view Calvin Harris  Sitting table nice because gets super packed able rest feet enjoy cocktails show  confetti smoke blast galore! tried dance main floor once but much me   but expected labor day weekend  Another big plus ventilation place never felt hot!   If you're area think worth trying   <EOR> This review long overdue since rating visit last year  wanted since heard rave reviews friends  wanted see Hardwell knowing would crowded bought tickets ahead time  Unlike other reviewers waited hours no line immediately    The club overcrowded hard move around hard breathe because way many people  clubgoers ratchet rude  trying good time dance but people kept pushing shoving without apologizing  fed when girl pushed way shoved back  Mind person color Asian she group white  She group friends mad kept glaring giving dirty looks  felt entitled even told security hahah seriously? You're rudely pushed don't blame Asian  Even group black women saw happened even asked if okay   As Hardwell never even saw because pissed off club experience couldn't deal crowd  left early wasn't worth it  XS if want actual good time trash excuse nightclub  <EOR> Had best time here! Didn't wait line since promoter walked in  multi level club elevators take down  aren't able gain entrance freely among all different rooms some reason  couldn't into hiphop room where other group was  confusing  club lot VIP tables 2nd floor ? some guys invited table  played great music all night dancing booth tables always fun  Bathrooms clean easily located  <EOR> Worst Vegas nightclub ever!!! staff rude obnoxious simply s*** show! accused doing something asked leave! wasn't doing anything club but sitting down lounge seating hip hop room enjoying music! When told them wrong person placed formal complaint head security said sometimes right person sometimes don't sorry if you're them !!!! Such coward response he blew off whole thing   I never humiliated life! He did care blaming customers said sometimes things don't work favor       yet he invited back!!! Wtf??  The drinks ridiculously priced security works bunch arrogant clowns trained monkeys could better job  most humiliating insulting experience   I never step foot place again don't care famous DJ playing       no deserves treated especially when didn't anything wrong!  Think 10 times before choosing your Vegas night club destination!!!! <EOR> Absolutely beautiful Night Club! Home world famous djs Tiesto Hardwell many more!  I attending private party last night  received entry bracelet drink tickets before arrived  Everything very smooth   All employees helping friendly curtesy  Bartenders working very fast!   The night club round shape  believe 4 levels all levels 2 full bars   Lots seating areas booths tables  reservation seating bottle service  The dance floor huge! The lights lighting system truly state art!  There lots stairs everywhere almost impossible see them dark  please careful!  Also convenience elevators club   Restrooms located second floor!   If planning attend any famous djs nights sure arrive early! line club HUGE! Plan ahead! good know some host hostess faster services! <EOR> Overcrowded!!!!!There no space stand walk Drinks horrible Very unorganized Wont back <EOR> The club good layout decor but just way crowded   many other crowded clubs but when mean crowded point sandwiched tons people pit difficult situation finding friends getting drink bar   can't timid if want around use your arm move people your way courteous possible but assertive enough where need go   line long moves slower line Disneyland you'll spend 30 40 minutes GA     Tiesto playing $100 night   price problem since world famous DJ playing inside smaller club instead stadium   But whole being crowded thing doesn't money well spent     If really want see high profile DJ such Tiesto $100 Wet Republic best experience GA   able right away waited line only took less 5 minutes front   never problem crowd day party able stand front section see Tiesto close without fighting any crowds   all space didn't shoved fight space good view walk around find friends drink bar   Wet Republic felt more VIP experience because still packed feel party but still your space walk around  <EOR> Super crowded no outdoor area admission very pricey long lines if VIP just overall nuts     if don't some sort VIP access if big DJ then forget getting in! Luckily apart group package weekend then Tiesto decided come worked great but he didn't come until 2 30am  Which Vegas main DJ's come later but told latest 1 30am   Sunnery James wouldn't shut heck up!   Another huge annoyance   packed dance floor  no room even when busy  UGh  <EOR> I bottom service birthday  promoter gave 2500 minimum quote but when front manager approached rudely told we'd minimum 3000 out  tab came 4500 tax gratuity some LET fee  Management security very rude  bottle service girl very nice smokin hot  name Lana   The club pretty packed Calvin Harris DJing but overall Hakkasan really needs work customer service    Light still favorite club EDM far <EOR> Great nightclub  escorted directly promoter friend friend commenting entry   Dress code standard club  look cute! #DUH  Hiphop room downstairs WAY small  WTF! lol  The only thing don't if don't table no where sit take break dancing  Also upstairs portion can't even really look below main dance floor because design booths ALL way around it  stairs really throw off too   I see being disastrous people can't hang partying  offered table $1K incl 2 bottles but passed because really just wanted check hang bit before venturing another spot   Other typical standard new club great sound system lighting lots people  <EOR> Swanky fun   exit signs mislead mens bathroom! beware <EOR> Hakkasan fortunate able secure Tiesto Calvin Harris its resident DJs   Other there's nothing really special club   I'd describe little bigger Light     Plus bouncers extremely rule   mean understand all bouncers Vegas put front   part job but Hakksan seems escalate notion higher level   instance saw person General Admissions line asking legitimate question bouncer purchase pre sale tickets   Granted while legitimate question agree question wasn't probably smartest question ask particularly existence internet   However thought bouncer could little more helpful least acknowledging person asking question instead just flat ridiculing being GA line  <EOR> Perhaps its goal Vegas clubs encourage people table service but just seemed always trapped  limited bar space limited free space rearlly no central location where people hang out  If fight your way dance floor there's good chance you'll stuck while   just felt trapped table setup isn't conducive walking around hanging bar even going dance floor dance  essentially just want pack people them drink dance place didn't it  crowd wasn't very attractive music something may enjoyed 10 years ago but now truly pots pans music  Again considering table minimum $2 500 I'd consider other place first but maybe just over scene perhaps opinion isn't same 24 year olds   <EOR> My night included group 8 girlfriends heart radio weekend Calvin Harris spinning  bottle service hip hop room  First off venue beautiful really big  service table great  really friendly top it  said tables started $3k!! Even venue being cool    $3k cool! Instead no cover kept touch promoter  hour able table $1500  Still crazy high price but busy weekend  Despite things club going good service nice venue couldn't fully enjoy lame music insane amounts people  hip hop room no variety hip hop being played  just boring while  crowd insane  Literally push through bodies anywhere  sure place nice when packed    But night there  <EOR> I trolled promoter line 8 45pm because Heart Radio concert also MGM night she said would super popping  friends hesitant because arrives club early right?

Decor ugly music subpar no dancing including terribly dressed go go dancers It's pretty bad when even hired dancers won't dance    The worst part Hakkasan clientele  definitely opposite upscale club  Picture drunk botox filled late 40 somethings mixed dirty cowboys mixed girls couldn't into hotter clubs    I 6 good looking girls left dump XS within 30 mins arrival most epic night  walked Hakkasan bouncer actally told hurt feelings because leaving already    Word advice Save your time sexy outfit  Any club housed 5 star hotel strip better choice one  <EOR> Bartender refused give cup water told buy bottle water leave club into casino water  Total bs <EOR> A 1 star more would give  far worst night club ever plenty  workers EXTREMELY rude no reason  Couldn't even stay more 2hrs  Don't waste your time your money! <EOR> Ugh  Hakkasan those cases when learned trust apprehensive instinct going kind places instead paying extra amount money check curiosity   price extremely over hyped club requires spend quite bit money order truly 'fun'  First off many stairs walk around understand why absolutely NO places sit down rest unless table service Even when friends managed find area chill take off heels guards your case wear your shoes back dance floor    Really?  Despite all electronic music main floor actually enjoyed being down hip hop room but did appreciate trek going down stairs    Despite guards telling stand most them pretty nice welcoming when entered club    Word advice girls Unless table service sure extra pair flats wear because taking off your heels rest your feet cut it! Better yet somewhere else  like Marquee Light satisfy your clubbing experience!  Word advice guys Take moment SERIOUSLY consider whether worth your money pay nearly $100 DJ  probably over hyped point  <EOR> Went Hardwell 8 16  Buying tickets advance must! crew 11 45 only waited 10 15 minutes instead insanely long regular line  4 levels club prepared workout  club really nice itself however expensive drinks such huge crowd inside since newest clubs around  Its hard good time unless stay away dance floor  regular lineup includes big name DJs such Tiesto Calvin Harris etc  Warning people looking inside dance floor even front stage  People rude slightly shoving elbowing through crowding  Unfortunately put EDM stage all way floor 4  prepared walking huge crowds! <EOR> Was guest list moved different lines least 5 times before correct line then moved 3 times waited hour half line find cover $100 guys  Total waste hour half Saturday night  <EOR> My review may bit bias because personal experiences great partially due fact am involved industry  music mainstream EDM although its thing remember Las Vegas if want spiritual musical journey hippy rave desert wont find here  said don't think greatest time visiting club if don't plan paying bottle service  alone break your experience  Again thats something complain Las Vegas people visit strip celebrate blow money  Its really tough if group friends willing pitch commit night  Otherwise you'll probably spend first half your night waiting ridiculously long line second half night spilling your drink yourself security ushers tight corner club next  Great place if know you're getting yourself to  <EOR> Went Thursday night which 4 5 experience  Fast line great fun  security people really nice funny    Went Saturday night Chainsmokers show  see them if chance great! club much  2 5 experience  table if want really good time  Might just Saturday night but guys overly aggressive compared XS omnia  Also probably because big fight way many guys compared girls  <EOR> I am working another club trying another club  SERIOUSLY warning if want terrible night club far overcrowded rude staff feeling keep moving around cattle then should here  never worse set bar  oversell shows nowhere dance  What's far worse nowhere stand  If  stand same place more three minute bouncer comes yells  keep moving  only place stand table if pay over $2 000 it  amazing terrible place is  stay business completely mystery me  But do  beware  warned ahead time plopped down money come show  most horrible club going experience ever had  Read other reviews agree me  You'll see can't all making up  Please club! <EOR> After recent visit must say probably best VIP bottle service experiences compared other nightclubs visited same service  ease entering quick convenient  didn't even wait line  fact right when nightclub opened whisked away bouncer acquaintance that works Hakkasan whom both led behind ropes ahead every person waiting line  some awesome personal service right there  ID's checked hands stamped twice all led elevator surprisingly large enough fit big group   Excited unaware floor level being whisked away all remember simply navigated through crowds booth which conveniently located between entrance room bar  Hip hop music being spun soon booth servers hostesses began preparing table would long night heavy drinking non stop dancing everything between    We given 40 drink tickets use bar top already table  time progressed crowd grew larger but didn't stop group having good time  music good all throughout night tail end dancing away top granite tables along center booths because constant drinking good music rotation night good ignore  server top game always making sure drinks filled  Every time would try pour drink myself server would take drink say take care it  would like?   Let's just say she good tip night    Grabbing drink bar never hassle  Every single time approached bar bartender always attentive  never wait line order despite busy seemed around area  restrooms decent conveniently located near entrance room  club definitely spacious different rooms wander through explore  glad all decided instead XS  know everyone's experience different honestly really wasn't expecting much even hearing all good things club but having experienced VIP bottle service other clubs Vegas I'd say Hakkasan reigns supreme over rest  DJ's music spacious venue restaurant nice bouncers servers bartenders elevator dudes acquaintance even crowd definitely made experience memorable!! Thanks hooks homie! know are! Good positive vibes all around! <EOR> BAD Guestlist lines confusing ridiculously long  There's ladies general don't know which way want if girls first need stay guys even girl guy ratio  Stairs EVERYWHERE mean it  only long ass dangerous concrete stairs connect 3rd 4th 5th floors but 4th main floor down steps all around back  Unavoidable  means if want drink bathroom walk steps  No wonder sell flip flops bathroom  No outdoor area  Other popular clubs XS Marquee Tao Pure? all outdoors area chill hear music see Vegas view  Hakkasan lacked which meant stuffy smokey hell  whole place dark feel you're dungeon whole time  Wouldn't surprised girls fall face steps Small main dancefloor  #1 come hire such good talent charge guys ridiculous price theres really room see dj? floor maybe little wider left right Marquee but long front back way   if sense  wouldn't whole stage view if weren't front middle back middle  left right entrances dancefloors poorly designed because 1 3 into tables area ppl would fall into flimsy railing area know which way go  least Marquee clearly designed wide walkways leading into dancefloor half wall left right won't fall into table area anything  Little room see dj  floor because theres enough room walk left right walkways crowded I'm sure middle dancefloor good space because ppl give midway push way back  But there's no other spots see dj because everyone tables surround dancefloor fucking standing blocking view  little down steps back? good thing people lean against railings theyll view  ppl pouring over every railing mini balcony half wall behind tables areas just see dj  most upsetting because all came see talent people settle standing step leaning railing order a good spot  Marquee considered small packed but least wherever see dj blcoked people standing tables because all tables front middle  5th floor balcony definitely can't see stage because all tables front railings blocking regular people standing back  No water  $10 small Fiji bottle no tap water no water fountains  Bitches trying rip off  Complicated layout  Stairs 3rd 4th 5th floors near each other no signs no way know where where anything is    GOOD Sound system lights background stage designs good  Dj music good expectations  Did Tiesto play 1 4am maybe longer? Bouncers nice kindly directing stairs bathrooms which very important because confusing layout  must asked them question 10 times patient  3rd floor hip hop room played late 90s 2000 era pretty good  But does close 12am? Sigh   TABLES  only time hakkasan SERIOUSLY if table  best views many sit  Basically people tables ruined rest because would block all views opinion    CONCLUSION Hakkasan trying appeal richer crowd people willing throw down money tables  If don't don't dancefloor early may enjoy yourself  <EOR> Was excited see Tiesto Saturday night   Club opened 9 he didn't come until 1 played until 3 even though club stays open until 4   Unless you're VIP booth nowhere sit VERY over crowded   Great music but did annoying constantly being moved around crowd control   Drinks started $15 but didn't stop people getting overly drunk spill drinks   creating extra sticky floor   loved confetti favorite part smoke released high pressure when best dropped   <EOR> The staff unprofessional! Specially VIP host comp table bottle through host not saying any names but we'll just call B   He made everything sound really good reconfirmed everything day said all set before 11 15 pm  11 pm! Texted told already 5 min passed no answer called no pick up  already knew he looked he but ignored call text  trying attention but instead he sent other host tell wasn't VIP list  showed text msgs confirmation still said wasn't list! Instead being rude nasty towards sent guest list  Later found reason B did because 4 heavy set girls group! discrimination! Vegas local appalled this! DISCRIMINATION its finest! HAKKASAN RUINED 21ST BIRTHDAY! <EOR> The most horrible club experience ever   Over capacity overpriced huge stupid line  honestly feared life moments because  overwhelming crowd  no place stand dance drink   guest list but still waited 30 minutes line  awful hope fewer people experience did future  <EOR> I really enjoy food! short ribs calamari apps spicy noodles Seabass     Ambiance fantastic!!!!

As negatives  layout interesting many said TONS stairs  But elevators which taking advantage more often now! main EDM room always packed let many people come different rooms all same time  times when club overcrowded hot seems barely breathe! Talk fire hazard! Expect typical Vegas prices drinks Grey Goose Redbull 28 00 water 9 00 come across = <EOR> Unfortunately other reviews true!   I rate club 2 5 due its layout  Basically dance floor super crammed tiny which because tables surrounding it   Furthermore every vantage point dance floor where would usually stand place drink ledge also taken tables therefore leaving walk down club looking place stand watch because dance floor packed   Hakkasan please read this! Remove some tables!! told don't cost much anyway just price something   Club potential but unfortunately recommend people avoid place regardless DJ won't enjoy it   Nath <EOR> So came last night Calvin Harris   horrible    Calvin great  I think   we didn't anywhere close stage   was he even playing music?  It's Grossly perverted sausage fest   well  kind mean  but upset       Okay first things first    way tooo overpacked! Second confusing   the layout meant many people    drunk people   way many freaking stairs everywhere    I sober ate concrete 3x    what heck   are cereal   ow leg fail   I just feel Hakkasan should really organize Big Dj events having better crowd management sell tickets everyone   like everyone mom there   sounds fun? No   its stressful  Small clubs should promote events big concerts pack everyone inside   so uncomfortable   after experience coming back Hakkasan     Thank but nooooo thank you   <EOR> My girlfriends really awful experience during friend's bachelorette party   promoter put list once inside everything downhill   impossible onto dance floor because jampacked struck serious design flaw place where people typically to    know    dance?!  wanted water paid $12 water bottle which outrageous but sadly unusual Vegas club if only thing wrong place wouldn't complain much   know spot different DJ's depending when go but say whoever playing night decided Hakkasan playing nondescript repetitive untz untz untz music made ears want bleed little   untz untz untz music but hey something girl dance to   We located second dance area bit more manageable while dance party mode actually great time   When tried leave proverbial crap hit fan   The system club set allowing guests exit club recipe disaster   If place caught fire people would trampled die   First off could find exit good long time   When did locate exit joined herd human cattle attempting into overcrowded elevators out   figured might able find staircase exit skip elevator crowd but bouncers notified could exit via staircases wait elevator   waited seemed eternity probably 45 minutes hour turn ride elevator club   turned friend while waiting line said feel purgatory!  place?! When finally friends burst into tears because experience traumatic   truly understand took longer took in   place does value its customers   treated worthless piece meat don't waste your time  <EOR> We ended having pretty great night thanks meeting super fun group guys   but few detractors actual club I know Vegas California but smoking inside club just cool  more guy came very close burning friend cigarettes because dancing drunk paying attention  Another person left lit cigarette stairs  If someone chose terrible pair shoes which sure never happens right? took them off during night could hurt  just unsafe  Okay turn mom voice off now   The headlining dj doesn't start until 1 30am    I lied mom voice back on  needs water station somewhere  know want drink pay expensive bottled water ecologically irresponsible Hakkasan! But people plenty own bad decisions regarding drink  least give them option being smart re hydrating some point night   Goodness maybe getting little old clubbing scene     nah few years left yet  <EOR> Meehh gotta give Hakkasan getting easily without glitch couple drink tickets each   Came random Thursday night but apparently some famous DJ spinning   heard line always great but just overall experience   i'd say pretty awesome if existed like   7 years ago   But Light right down strip i'd rather visit XS Tryst venture outside Wynn  <EOR> The music cool  When tiësto Dj love it  But club over crowded  Most important please wear formal shoes allow anyone sport shoes  <EOR> So pissed turned last night never problem all! damn security kicked getting cigarette burn because complain drunk person there  don't even want give star  <EOR> If could give zero star would   I NEVER discriminated life any business until here  group friends check nightclub upon entrance bouncer pulled aside asked name where lived then ACCUSED being drugs cause eyes big  natural big eyes  Next he ACCUSED being fucked never enter club again  sober told breathalyze drug test test negative  He refused just kicked out  He said walking weird pidgeon toed!

We pretty early between 9PM 10PM still pretty relaxed atmosphere  bigger looks second bar tucked over far side dance floor  never personally found terribly overcrowded  margarita cost $14 eeek Vegas prices    We did unfortunately lose table because apparently many guys sold table away another party  Without warning first so far know anyway   little upsetting but city where having vagina trumps all? point during night guard even physically stopped boyfriend approaching table put hand shoulder held back table only explanation guard many guys there  Even though he original guys group table reserved with  <EOR> First off would say place great DJs great light show set up    However many reasons why would want come back club  many clubs Las Vegas including Marque XS Tao lights  Vegas 10 times past 3 years know pros cons clubs    First bouncers friendly  try start conversation ignored polite all    Second venue really crowded no standing room  If bottle service then place you     Third Water 8 dollars guys don't offer tap water? just spent 100 dollars drinks can't even glass water?

Me Suddenly worried But bad reviews? Friend Nah all related people having trouble getting in  Me Yeah won't those issues! know host!   The host surprisingly tells late follow advice way past 12  ticket admission line side guest list ladies lines other  first guest list area line because point rules don't apply everyone themselves pushing front trying unsuccessfully catch someone's attention  When doesn't anywhere move ladies' line but no difference  Everyone guest list almost everyone  lady because 1 5 hours waiting saw 1 5 guys average in  But more later     We see host know tells he minute but right now no getting over capacity etc  etc   hear other hosts tell other girls same thing could anywhere 15 50 minutes in  But once while see only certain hosts people in  late night form conspiracy theories analyze hierarchy just keep waiting  long while passes when some hosts start changing stories telling people might well leave because getting in  host comes hiding just ask honestly tell if getting he assures just few more minutes    Meanwhile decide into bar adjacent Hakkasan  When come bar just happens area where all hosts hang getting closer access  point story still stays same anywhere 15 50 minutes  gets ask? People meeting people tables seems general response  Mysteriously those people mostly girls few guys sprinkled between   group girls waiting long time host whom seen getting others in  talk him  Same story 15 50 minutes  those girls just ask? friends Calvin Harris host says  doubt any real friends Calvin Harris waiting line hour but OK whatever   finally talking yet another host knew point disappeared  BUT really made whole experience unpleasant constant lack clear answers   If we're getting just TELL US!!  appreciate honestly night  Yes your strategy keep people outside your club seem hottest place earth but don't want puppet outside making club look good while wasting precious time knowing what's going happen  lack disrespect disregard really threw off    However once Inside energy amazing sound quality lights visuals all great  No line bar very nice bartenders making very nice strong drinks  stairs bad but maybe because semi sober  Maybe drinks weren't strong all  Anyway all almost worth waiting Almost    Next time if want see DJ just buy online tickets  Seems way without hassle  <EOR> Review only night club   Tips $15 AMF  $14 rum coke  $9 tiny bottled water offer free water sink tap                                                                   large dance floor everyone stand see DJ  large upstairs but possible see DJ upstairs unless bottle service tables don't recommend heading upstairs good view   I found incredibly mean charge $9 bottle water giving option just water tap  night gets later impossible upstairs downstairs into large dance floor  <EOR> Hakkasan far exceeded expectations! Tiesto outstanding! Security made feel safe very friendly!

Usually when group friends unspoken agreement person buys round group   Normally people part round drinks return favor also buying round   would continue throughout night until everyone group bought 1 round   whoever wants buy drink buys drink themselves whomever   However friend NEVER returns favor   same friend does same thing every time bar them   Even though everyone group bought round friend drinks all drinks but only buys beer herself   even more annoying person decent job isn't broke   Back review music good   Although would choose top 40 hip hop room over house music would say house room winner night   all Vegas clubs drinks overpriced   Overall decent time   1 3 night spent going down 250+ steps death   entire venue consists stairs   want bar?  Well watch 5 steps   want restroom?  Well watch 10 steps   want house room?

Trekking those killer pumps work out  time upstairs panting out shape   know    Upon getting top stairs saw more stuff   bar left cage thing front me   bit underwhelming  Then saw dance floor  Sure tons lights video screen thingies which made nice party ambience but dance floor itself small  Even walkways dance floor sucky  much slope wasn't easy walk heels   The upstairs also smoking area which cool  really don't fact there's no outdoor area  course there's A C but many people gets hot! hip hop room also joke  basically all tables booths no dance floor but people try dance anyway  horrific experience even non claustrophobic people   1 10 would return <EOR> If you're looking club horrible music overpriced drinks then place you  $20 cocktail!!! kidding me? mention friend found chewed gum bottom hers  place joke! security guards rude DJ's lame  Avoid all costs! <EOR> Honestly scared based reading reviews others mentioned Hakkastairs    wasn't bad thought    Went last weekend bob sinclar using presale tix wanttickets     waited whole 2 minutes in   only way if you're doing bottles    Was absolutely blown away  opening DJ dope hell   had great mix felt crowd warmed up  layout surprisingly dope dance floor able around bit    sound system tremendous FREAKIN CRYO BLASTS COMING DOWN CEILING YOU  just insane   video screen above DJ second level choreographed dancers performance   Just freakin incredible really really impressed venue Bob Sinclar dope hell      Checked venue bit I'd personally stay away hip hop room   out way just weird vibe  main stage where its at   go dancefloor tables don't think back room upstairs would good  <EOR> Hakkasan currently hottest club Vegas strip  Located MGM Grand hard miss nowadays exterior MGM Grand hotel largely displaying electronic ads Hakkasan  Although 5 levels total first two levels actually restaurant space  club located upper three floors level being just lounge second being main room resident DJs third having hip hop dance room    I came second weekend opening debut Calvin Harris Fergie featured main room  prefer house music main room favorite dance floor however if hip hop head Ling Ling Lounge some beats   My group ladies arrived early around 8 45 9PM guest list line a ladies only one club upon its doors opening 10PM  FREE  No cover charge  Love it  Many thanks gal pal contacted right promoter hook up  Also wanted note contrary other Yelp reviews girl friend told didn't submit group photo advance accepted guest list   weird some patrons fulfill requirement  never personally done other top tier Vegas nightclubs either   Once inside found club very spacious although time many people yet  dance floor particular hauntingly empty  even open? proceeded start night drinks bar  midnight club filled up  dance floor super packed but ladies managed good spot close front hang out  close could see DJ's expressions  Party on  light effects pretty amazing well  Lazers smoke ever changing neon blinking lights  another note found even though crowded didn't hard time getting drink bar  enough bars around each level keep bar crowd being 10 people deep   Overall great time but some small disappointments along way    Stairs everywhere  Unavoidable unless table reservations  Elevators VIP  Watch your step ladies gents! Nowhere sit even if half tables empty club couldn't even take off shoes moment rest  Security watched all patrons very closely  Needless say group called several times  Rude restroom attendant  Does she even want tip?

No regular glass tap water provided when requested no other water alternative  least Vegas clubs held pool areas i e  Marquee XS Surrender could quench thirst free water fountain   Now if back since usually male friends would try arrange table reservations promoter  imagine tough mixed groups  <EOR> So much hype club mideocre  Every single time gone experienced night place always remember why don't more  place overly packed people  think sways exceed limit many guests through door  slammed pushed against walls obnoxious  punched puked robbed all night  feel security level place also sucks  Noone seems care anyone's safety  <EOR> This Greatest Nightclubs world!

Maybe overly friendly but definitely easygoing rude   DJs First time see TIESTO which awesome   hand light bracelet things everyones bracelets dance sync whole club!  Amazing   Second time see AFROJACK set also amazing!  also loved projected lyrics above DJ stage which made singing along easy! D  SPACE TABLES Yes some rooms crowded   main dance floor ALWAYS crowded definitely hate that   But both times able find friendly table let join dance sit friends   There's also ton space balcony overlooking main dance floor tables   none bouncers shooed away even though didn't bottle service   DRINKS Drinks expensive force buy expensive tiny bottles water   if guy would hate that   But Vegas little easier girls since free drinks aplenty     VENUE Definitely wear comfortable shoes!  Because place huge there's lots walking stairs   There's also elevator though which able most every time  <EOR> Put yourself guest list  Arrive early avoid waiting Long lines  Very good music very good ambience  Definitely recommend! <EOR> I took advice other reviewers took ear plugs  Best decision ever! definitely louder compared other places  Even ear plugs occasionally taking them better hear people saying when talking ears still ringing next couple days  couldn't imagine would if never ear plugs! Yes stairs annoying but don't drunk where can't even function won't fall your face main floor pretty packed but stayed towards back found cool room bunch VIP tables could dance right next them  Why pay 5 000+ table when literally right anyways? ability sit? Nah save thousands something better Tiesto great however weird he didn't even say anything when he came on  Maybe he used because contract? Seen many times other places well everyone knows he awesome didn't bearing rating  <EOR> I very unimpressed Hakkasan  pitched club Las Vegas very underrated  only other club experience completely opposite experience best nights out  ratio men women Hakkasan close 4 1  Once figured dance floor all men couldn't even dance crowded  Women sort treated commodity trying fill tables rejected if weren't pretty enough true story   Beyond getting promoters didn't care if didn't enjoy yourself  all might norm but doesn't right  starting DJ meh  Sort funny thinking night now disappointing was  Only thing nice really say lights dancers spot on  <EOR> The ONLY reason should come if table    Otherwise prepare walking down stairs all night looking good spot stand because nowhere sit  dance floor non existent packed sardines  Forget dancing point you're fighting breath air your neighbor    The guest list joke if insist coming just presale tickets avoid 2 hour line    All nightmare stories hear true  Save yourself trouble head XS Drais  <EOR> Not fan music played here  looking hip hop nightclub  hip hop room little no dancing  Didn't help don't drink anymore stone sober  Sister free only lasted 15 mins max before back hotel  <EOR> When accidentally walk outside want re enter into club please prepared 45 minute wait  Ohh heels nicely dressed please expect feel look piece dirt  watched account less people jeans tee shirts walk before us  service terrible use local  Vey upset  <EOR> Good vibes Hakkasan Nightclub  free through friend which made worth it     but packed  Hard onto dance floor because just jam packed   The DJs feature always awesome  Definitely good time sense  Drinks ridiculously overpriced  paid $10 small Red Bull    mixed drinks $20     ladies find yourself someone buy drink lol  <EOR> Went last night group 4 girls 4 guys  guest list line 11 45 before 12! Fast line friendly staff  Plus always FREE entrance woohoo wallet!   When inside didn't expect crowded because didn't really seem outside but super crowded especially around dance floor  Expect pushed shoved lot! Don't try bring your drink dance area even walking around because someone sure going knock over  Happened every time group last night every round   recommend just drinking bar getting drink very top floor upstairs lingling room  Bars overly crowded didn't take long rounds drinks    Insanely busy once Dada Life came around 1 30 foot stepped 50 times    Huge plus easy front dance floor close DJ's sweat drips onto yay that! Saw Calvin Hotness Harris Tiesto close previous occasions too!   People cry stairs but boo hoo every club that    ALSO person group little much drink Hakkasan staff super friendly it! Instead kicking curb outside every other place actually wheelchaired paramedics area gave fluids through IV drip  gave medical attention found blood pressure half should be  But talk going above beyond! Plus service free  Awesomeeeeeeee  Hakkasan know you'll taken care of  <EOR> Eh  Just eh  Maybe hyped myself much over club   My sister guestlist see Afrojack  entrance around 10 30  Mandatory $10 coat check  lines confusing separated into three different sections felt could've organized better  Waited 30 min in   The club itself nicely decorated but small  main room gets heavily packed  only time gets spacious when you're invited table [  The hip hop room even smaller main room consists small dance floor center surrounded private booths tables   We paid $18 vodka soda $9 small bottled water  <EOR> Came soon grand opening weekend Tiesto spinning  Tiesto's shows but disappointing one  Maybe he just being lazy maybe off night but really great    really could ANY DJ spinning wouldn't even known dif   That being said  club just any other Vegas clubs now a days  little darker feels open  dance floor does high ceiling but shaped long rectangle? course tables all across dance floor plain view DJ booths    I didn't any problem getting bar when easy drinks  second floor impressive but guess people chill  best club worst    However def distance strip unless staying MGM don't think worth trip just come here  <EOR> Huge Vegas club!

DJ Ruckus gave two best friends much life Friday August 21st  He brought back many oldies but goodies  arrived early received free admission courtesy promoter which great  pretty much stuck hip hop floor thoroughly enjoyed ourselves  while drinks expensive wasn't unexpected   Overall place pretty large course night more more crowded left 1 45am which know early  perhaps why crowd overwhelming  although shoo'ed off VIP ledges sitting security he no way rude it  would definitely back    I loved HAKKASAN! <EOR> Had blast here!

Honestly nightclubs much different think people tend judge good club much fun had  But fun unstable variable if your friend drunk threw everywhere guys kicked out?  So being said best time ever whoo hahaha  Lights cool confetti everywhere cool crowd    Dance floor 2nd floor isn't big but still quite fun plays EDM  tables wrap around dance floor  Upstairs more tables going guess they're cheaper ones downstairs crowded since there's no dance floor just tables bar   Didn't check first floor nightclub which plays hip pop   Pretty good crowd met really cool people thanks big group guys girlfriend super drunk whoo!   If you're going table suggest downstairs because atmosphere much better  You're close dance floor sure scream into ear person next but really contributes party atmosphere  bouncers essentially let anything want if table keep bottles coming  <EOR> Brian Pfeiffer took care group few times  He pro he does took care w great hookup  Free table bottle girls  Guy girl  Hit up  Brian 773 459 8133 <EOR> Don't wasted your time bottles services waiting 2hrs reservation line   Finally left Taos <EOR> Right off bat don't know why place many bad reviews  came during summer Tiesto GREAT!!!

WAY many stairs  as many other reviewers mentioned  Very dangerous drunk girls heels or even sober girls heels indeed  I'd other clubs actually fewer stairs could around without being paranoid tripping steps!! <EOR> It's just  so  crowded  main dance floor just sardine can  People weren't even dancing    $9 miniature bottle water   Had hookup didn't pay $100 claustrophobia focus group but DAMN   I felt sorry all dudes did    It's centered around making money creating enjoyable experience  vegas motto lives on  <EOR> TIESTO SIIIIICKKK  far best DJ world  hakkasan first time tiesto playing  much club goer myself but if would highly recommend experience hakkasan when tiesto playing  Something music ppl crazy  definitely return  <EOR> Purchased ticket ahead time still allowed entry  100$ down drain  Operated lowest forms primordial life congrats lenient hiring practices though! <EOR> Security straight douche bags    Rude didn't let because girl friend's id little old  Gf died hair looks little different id didn't let in  Turned cops believed but douche bag manager said give card back but no club   Fucking asshole  If come sure your id date looks exactly you  excited see tiesto but shit happens     <EOR> Before even inside Came opening weekend 4 27 13 see Calvin Harris  group 5 girls total guestlist told entry would free  arrived around 10 15 pointed guestlist line which long door around corner hotel outside  group waited total 2 5 hours inside once did told payment windows just changed rules guestlist few minutes ago now $20 girls $200 guys  kidding me? know opening weekend busy but trying milk way did ridiculous   The only reason giving extra star awesome female host I wish could remember name she blonde hair top bun understanding situation helped giving different guestlist entry slip allowed all free supposed originally  She incredibly nice few kind staff members encountered Vegas all weekend   Inside We walked inside right Calvin Harris started set tried way dance floor  place packed blocked off dance floor no else allowed in  Whatever happens popular DJs but literally NO WHERE else stand  Anywhere stopped motioned bouncers keep moving   We decided try going upstairs upper level see if more luck elevators told elevators VIP use only   Wtf? Okay 10 minutes locate where stairs up  considerably more roomy but many tables most them empty NO WHERE stand see stage  Once more people started making way again told couldn't stand behind bottle service tables  ended doing laps around club! ridiculous!  All all probably only spent 30 minutes because miserable  even Calvin Harris's great set could keep longer  Maybe few weeks when hype dies down isn't many people might better but did leave good first impression getting friends ever back going impossible   Pros many  Good DJ's great staff member spoke to   Cons many stairs horrible use space way many bottle service tables most which even use allowing no where stand if didn't drop 10k table skeezy practices when came charging people told getting free etc etc  most likely going back any time soon  <EOR> Went back Vegas past weekend decided give place another try especially since Danny Avila there   My experience remarkably different attribute fact its pool season quite yet club crowds Vegas manageable  no fuss no muss stood single line compared 5 shuffled into before only rejected because own error    Once finally club lot stairs but if cant handle them heels probably cant handle dancing long them biggie   Overall admit good time remember crowded but obnoxiously so  can't imagine coming pool season having table because would miserable  Definitely VIP focused club    If want someplace table come back off season definitely back Hakkasan  Otherwise stick more open area clubs  <EOR> If want loud club where can't even talk person next let alone pushed around security every second keep moving enter mad house where no room dance then Hakkasan  whole point going club dance mingle fun talk girls however speak women Hakkasan because no patio nearly impossible stand spot more 5 seconds  If pay table waste your money time good time  <EOR> Worst experience!! Friday pickpocket  thieves opened purses while being crowd stole iPhone  When complained security didn't anything it  T Mobile next day close strip right away knew phone stolen Hakkasan  top off packed couldn't dance move even just stand there  never again  If decide take chance sure don't take any your valuables you  <EOR> We would great time except phone stolen friend wallet stolen ZIPPED purses shoulders whole time  other reviews seems ongoing problem being addressed  If you're going leave everything but your ID your room  People suck  <EOR> This place good dayclub but lacks nightclub  long wait even  VIP during day  music good but kind small place Vegas club  <EOR> Warning MANY stairs   it's climbing Mount Everest   jk but really  Once past all stairs you're finally club   amen    Like any other vegas clubs recommend just buying ticket beforehand don't worry guest list  Honestly place good if bottle service otherwise bottlenecks everywhere impossible move around when gets crowded    Drinks Average vegas prices $$$ Floor layout Omnia better Dance floor Packed  People Older crowd  I saw Tiesto great time but probably because some randos let friend sit down table  give glowing bracelets light music cool! <EOR> **Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 97 100**  I've always given Hakkasan bad rap tbh avoided all costs but fabulous experience deserves update attitude   First all they've renovated club since last time year half ago  only sadness Ling Ling room used play hip hop gone    no break EDM if  want      dance floor still INSANELY packed but there's plenty room lurk around teh side stand table backs dance space good view  upstairs VIP level favorite spot because lovedddd having space dance crazy way love! All bouncers super nice even helped friend run outside grab cash debit no hassle   Drinks expensive yes but you're buying drinks VEGAS club  Above Beyond wasn't favorite DJ but opener fun great time  <EOR> Vegas where spend shit load money expect nights never forget  Hakassan just doesn't give those nights  3 times just used be! Omnia taken over but still try if never been! <EOR> Word advise buy tickets advance  Night Club pretty normal  seen better NYC Miami  wish more performers  Maybe because DJ famous? Drinks ridiculous  Prices pretty high but guess  because Vegas  only other room when there  Hip Hop room size class room  Very small  Song selections pretty good though    Be sure dress empress  Don't rolling your jeans Converse  just kick out  <EOR> Came Calvin Harris last weekend    My friend guestlist  still ended waiting 30 mins line  club SUPER SUPER crowded point where just couldn't walk anywhere  absolutely no where chill too  wants dance 8 hours straight?!   Never coming back here  <EOR> Hakkasan favorite nightclub believe best Las Vegas  brings best mix people best mix music  <EOR> My club reviews usually based venue production talent  Venue 5 story venue bottom 2 being restaurant top 3 floors dedicated nightclub experience       two rooms lounge spread over 3 floors  Ling Ling Lounge intimate lounge area 3rd floor which separate room called Ling Ling Club usually tends play open format hip hop top 40 records   The Main Room usually plays electronic dance music 4th 5th floor  shit ton tables everywhere almost sold every night   I believe only night club phone chargers built tables well   Venue most extravagant venue but compared many nightclubs around world top echelon  Production Lot lights sound system good however great multiple occasions where cut out   on special events deck decorations which kicks production notch   visuals ok when dance floor tend forget even look while doesn't usually add your experience other nightclubs festivals     Talent feel Hakkasan elite venue  initial roster 2013 now filled great talent   Hakkasan XS usually two venues give upcoming rising talent chance big shot Vegas    2015 no different face Future House Oliver Heldens getting chance perform Hakkasan  One suggestion place may set them apart even further utilize Ling Ling Room more deep underground dance music when open format being taken place Main Room  room perfect intimate setting deep house tech house future house etc  <EOR> Hakkasan group did excellent job collecting some most amazing DJs residency program because club holds special place heart    Hakkasan Omnia share same resident DJs but club life very different  honestly say line Hakkasan ten thousand times longer line Omnia HOWEVER gotten pretty lucky times where only wait half hour before getting in    This club T I N Y! if don't table sky villa prepared share some personal space LOT strangers! given nights they'll give free drink tickets ladies which love but most other times they'll just free entry even ratio    Highly recommend seeing Dada Life show unlike any other performance ever experience  next performance definitely Hardwell but only imagine long line be    Pro tip when promoter gives certain timeframe come club come EARLY POSSIBLE! kidding lines incredibly long regret coming later evening!  Other great club smaller hip hop lounge called Ling Ling Club would highly recommend anyone looking good time some good vibes    Oh yeah Hakkasan also some NICEST security hosts which really love  <EOR> Hakkasan Nightclub worst experiences ever had  understand prices list pretty high because nightclub great location but small bottle water $10 ridiculous  summer when buddies Dj Tiesto concert  place just crowded  many people such small area very dirty dark areas    I am sure next trip Las Vegas won't Hakkasan because care people opinion won't improve services  ? <EOR> Absolutely worst club vegas! wish could give negative stars  First off wait incredibly long strenuous  group through promoter comped table  But Hakassan people overbooked tables night ended getting table hour wait  Once inside felt if nothing special club  dance floor crowded life  constantly being pushed against another person tiesto even come yet  fact left before Tiesto came because crowded drinks good expensive $18 vodka red bull just really didn't seem worth end  Lastly every other review mentioned way many stairs  thought Marquee bad  definitely come back club future  way overpriced overhyped worth money  think stick XS Marquee next time <EOR> awesome place! much fun saw calvin harris energy great  even ventured into hip hop room 3rd floor going off there  Love there's mix    Will definitely back!

VIP reservations line gets crowded but group never wait more 20 min in  way escorted table very professional fast  waitress staff friendly accommodating when came down bottle service  includes bottle Absolut Vodka mixers Cranberry juice Orange juice Soda Water     The club itself does packed almost every weekend which why try avoid dance floor much possible  normal Hakkasan gets crazy crowded before during time DJ playing  having table useful when want spend time your friends without trying suffer bumping into people    Overall always walk Hakkasan feeling satisfied experience plus enjoying night friends! highly recommend nightclub anyone visiting Las Vegas!! <EOR> While clubbing never really thing different when Vegas   different mean better better venues better music prettier girls   yeah definitely better   Even if means having deal crowds paying ridiculous prices cover drinks   Which made easy choice hit conference's party Hakkasan   mention free entry free food free drinks course     Since wasn't typical trip Hakkasan review might little more generous forgiving most at least based reviews read    addition freebies club also opened few hours earlier conventioneers great wasn't all packed   same time crowd twice old you'd expect exactly dressed nines dress code wasn't enforced until 10pm    As venue though Hakkasan pretty nice though agree layout seem confusing you've few drinks   total three floors but most crowd gravitates towards top two levels the dance floor tables three bars main level upstairs level more booths couple bars     say bottom level sucks just more lounge club   Even though night started off dinner bunch buffet style stations everywhere won't bother mentioning food it fine nothing special    drinks though while can't comment pricey thought surprisingly stiff especially considering free   Still best part Hakkasan music no guest DJ event but thought resident DJ did pretty solid job!  All all while fun albeit abbreviated time Hakkasan hard say where rank among Vegas clubs me   definitely can't compare favorite XS still king but I'd put them likes Tao   very least doesn't require trip far end Strip   Almost reason alone Hakkasan isn't shabby! <EOR> My friends REALLY hyped place even though pretty good time really just OK venue   I lucky enough friends bottles place sit most night pretty close stage  ton stairs people noted  although sprawling layout don't feel theres anything special place minus DJ lineups which very good  Actually youll probably lost most night because youll keep back tracking center stage figure where want next   I can't complain because pretty much free night me   we even MADE money some guy just handed friend some HAHA but Idk if guy if i'd pay 80 bucks in  BUT if consider fact its sort mini concert guess its worth it  but no feelings nostalgia other clubs XS have <EOR> Even trying buy into all hype around hottest new club Vegas am official Hakkasan fan   I came group 17 pretty easy 10pm through guest list  Girls free guys pay $40 Saturday night   The DJs LEGIT  I never say legit  think db thing say  but    don't know else describe them XS night before definitely prefer Hakkasan over XS  hip hop DJ bottom floor good wish dance floor wasn't small  does put damper dancing because wasn't able move 2 hours being but each song came good enough TRY! definitely didn't $3k blow table service but looks didn't much room either  don't think bottle service area looked would worth besides fact sit down    but DJ good why would want to?  The EDM floor top even more impressive  lights DJ Ughh! If ever want feel you're drugs without actually taking them then ya go  Stand 5 minutes just watching scene badass DJ then just let music sink in    Drinks $16  Annoyingly pricey because still bought more 6 them regardless  Anywhoo    good times <EOR> This first experience legit nightclub Vegas  amazing  Highly recommend  DJ awesome club very large nice  drinks pretty expensive though  Overall would say need place when you're Vegas strip! <EOR> Worst club ever to   Paid 80 just dangerously crowded venue where only can't dance but pushed shoved stepped on   bouncers totally rudest people ever met   single coffee martini  $33  What's total ripoff tell bartender top that    If could give less 1 star would don't waste your money   Last if Fire Marshall ever saw conditions inside he'd close down  If ever fire inside no way evacuate many hundreds would burned   group sparklers bride party confetti flying several pieces caught fire bouncer did zero   All all would never recommend  LAX  Luxor much much safer better <EOR> So waiting 45 minutes giving cash yet alcohol mezzanine table  spending 1800 would expect better service let down first time Vegas  group made sure attend club again sure never refer business any associates future  <EOR> I don't know why Hakkasan only 2 5 star  great time there  Only down side over top priced drinks  <EOR> Had great time amazing DJ lighting fun vibe inside  Chainsmokers amazing live  hooked promoter before arrived without cover  If would dropped 100 bucks don't know if worth price but great time danced all night  <EOR> I wrote bad review past Hakkasan but recently back witnessed huge improvement! now love support nightclub  Very fun environment let many people point where cannot walk XS does  Bartenders very friendly totally love job respectable hard working people run club  Highly recommend! side note aware club different levels many stair cases  <EOR> Seriously?

Stay away! Hakkasan death trap! Attempted see Tiesto past weekend April 19th 2014 ended even sticking around because overcrowded unorganized just lousy place really is  girlfriend looking forward amazing night instant buzz kill minute in  Most everything place just sucked! If gazillion dollars spend table bottle service invisible nobody club! knocked around ping pong ball between all bouncers constantly shooing along keep moving mad crush people everywhere  Everything effort place! having wait line 20 minutes overpriced watered down drink actually trying dance floor! never able dance floor because overcrowded was! wanted water because hot all people poor ventilation bar tender told straight face water would $9 small 11oz bottle Fiji water regular cup water obviously option! Unfortunately just all point being beyond joke waved white flag gave place before Tiesto ever even came out! <EOR> Had amazing time August 22nd 2015 Saturday night watching W W!

Your best bet no hassle entry buy tickets before hand eat restaurant   dinner manager escorted through back way skipped whole line process   bartender very generous pours Ciroc Peach!!  little details into club crazy way try catch deadmau5 thought he would cheese but he amazing!!! <EOR> Don't know why many neutral negative reviews  club lot fun  exact type music into  crowded Thursday but isn't sign club everyone wants to????

He did help putting staff guest list  Super nice helpful guy!!! free FAST!!!!! bouncers nice  Maybe because line in  But club big decorated nicely feel real trance party  If you're looking hip hop rap don't come here  <EOR> Go your own risk! Vegas wanted clubby thing because supposed while Vegas right? Wrong  tickets Tiesto came little bit late because told main performer doesn't play until much later night   venue itself horribly laid out  several floors two different stages apparently? dunno  Hallways nowhere bar areas hidden behind walls walkways main area stupidly overcrowded  felt mouse science experiment  only people looked halfway enjoying themselves suckers tables roped off because some space    Needless say left 10 minutes joined many other people left same venue us  biggest gripe terrible time nowhere stand other crowd narrow walkways people kept overflowing area  But fact overcrowded point where legitimate safety concern! am convinced oversold event let way many people or people without tickets  While trying leave maze club followed exit signs dead ends roped off areas if emergency where occur would catastrophic  may sound dramatic but kept getting thoughts horrible Station nightclub fire while trying leave death trap   Look salty being able refund didn't clubbing just felt cheated wronged moreso did losing money blackjack table  other nightclubs Echostage D C  many times without ever having terrible experience did Shackkasan Nightclub  <EOR> Not type  music  therefore sucks  Drinks expensive bartenders ass holes    I calm da fuck down  Yes u work dope spot  But doesn't any better bartender Applebee's  screw still making same drinks drinking Coronas That's shit pissed off most lol  Some security  rolling Top Flight  job protect people but lot them acted shit specially young skinny security tried kicking stumbling   mothAF walking over step tripped little Dark AF where walking btw   plus first time didn't know way   He called bunch security over shit real Luckily them already leaving spot  wasn't really tripping getting kicked  security looked Adrien Broner he cool dude   but young skinny fool eats dirty asses    Overall venue amazing  Great set up   And btw im playing type music EDM cool guess    if eating dirty asses young skinny guard  Hahaha    playing again music sucks ass   haha   <EOR> If could would even star! Insane over priced watered down drinks RUDEST staff walk getting over priced drink just guy suit shove spill all over when tapped shoulder told excuse he threatened kick touching should trying attention  He should arrested touching plenty cameras prove least sent home fired  Don't worry none women ever back sure tell everyone DYNAMIC time there  THANKS YOUR PISS POOR SERVICE! <EOR> By far best part DJs bring here  All best ones  much talk about  Does take while seems more scene everyone being music  dance floor packs first DJ never clears  If cant floor into VIP won't see much everyone VIP stands walls prevents everyone else seeing show  Drink prices ridiculous too  staff all over place though keeping place clean throughout night preventing fights  <EOR> At long last finally chance visit supposed king Vegas megaclubs often touted and also doubted Hakkasan     Was epic Instagram be? Somewhat   Were areas where club could work improving itself? Absolutely    I tickets see Hardwell during HK's grand opening back April 2013 which coincided 21st birthday but never chance way Vegas ended spending weekend Coachella instead  No complaints  sure  A lot people seem complain Hakkasan's notoriously long lines  no problem buying presale tickets nightclub especially  marketed high end clientele  If you're looking killer night reasonable price really boils down being able pick right weekend visit  girlfriend scored tickets see Bingo Players HK absolute steal $30 20 her didn't through stress drunkenly waiting general admission line  can't stress enough useful scope Events Calendar HK website ahead time you'll save yourself plenty waiting money going presale just keep eye right deals!  But digress  Let's talk club itself   I expected HK look more extravagant place gives off sort Asian cavern themed aesthetic  There's no outdoor section club venture if you're search some fresh air unlike open pool deck provided Marquee even during nightclub hours prepared encounter some mild claustrophobia you're making your way through Hakkasan's dimly hit hallways   The production setup Hakkasan club's overall design memorable but game changing  During visit took particular notice visuals accompanied Eva Shaw Bingo Players during respective sets  visuals remarkably high resolution clarity they're quite mesmerizing and fair share shows mind you     As advertised shouldn't encounter much difficulty getting ideal view main room DJ regardless whether table not  Unlike those Marquee where bouncers constantly redirect patrons around room keep multiple walkways clear Hakkasan's bouncers pretty cool letting clubgoers scope scene perimeter dancefloor  also appreciate there's little to no waiting anyone looking way onto actual dance space    What ultimately sinks ship hit or miss quality staff Hakkasan  hand you've bouncers Although seems everyone mother seems despise guys found them pleasant cheery dudes  bouncers checked IDs door even gave lady some resounding congratulations mentioned celebrating six months together! Similarly other bouncers worked inside club itself happy tell where purchased suits I'm guy club eyes other dudes' suit fits admit  My biggest gripe entire evening Hakkasan however total ineptitude bartending staff  Let set scene you We approached bar located HK main room  Just getting bartender's attention challenge itself guy serving segment bar repeatedly glanced over around though weren't there! Understaffed right you! would gone long way  Hell even eye contact would improvement over being ignored pair ghosts     In any case finally managing bartender's attention asked Hakka split  For those may know Hakka HK's signature cocktails made Belvedere coconut passionfruit lychee  hadn't told however Hakkasan Restaurant Hakkasan Nightclub didn't share same drink menu  Honest mistake right?  Well instead providing simple explanation bartender informed he didn't all ingredients would downstairs Ling Ling bar order order Hakka  off through shoulder to shoulder crowd floor below similar long wait bartender's counterpart we're told Hakkasan Nightclub doesn't offer Hakka  all    Again wasn't much inability provide drink upset much obvious lack adequate training overall employee knowledge  Suffice say girlfriend promptly order pair AMFs just drown anger time being   Premium product eye candy marred some sloppy execution  very definition 3 5 stars  <EOR> I check place since everyone raving it  2x  Verdict all hype   Both times presale tickets  Guestlist lines loooongggggggg if knew already want see specific dj buy tickets avoid standing long line when drunk off ass   My first time see Steve Aoki  pretty early 11pm   line actually long presales but kept holding let in! When asked why said because fire marshals inside checking some safety issues line move once everything's clear  second time around arrived midnight only 4 people front presale line  didn't until 1am  When asked why security told owner Hakkasan inside line move he leaves  Sounds familiar much?  The venue seems big only because different levels but honestly dance floor TINY  clubs bigger dance floors LA! You're definitely gonna all sweaty guys slobbering against try your way onto dance floor  crowd? Old rich geezers high college students  classy  While waiting line several people rolling trying talk me   The only pro thing club going house some top djs  saw Steve Aoki first time he killed performance  He crowd rafting throwing cakes! second time around saw NERVO Calvin Harris both amazing  probably would back club unless there's dj am dying see here  <EOR> We hakkasan Saturday night during canelo vs may weather fight   place jam packed classy bunch people   able showing early around 9ish   $125 cover guys $50 girls steep      Calvin Harris played little bit show but mainly another DJ looked Calvin harris   lights music levels high quality   Getting dance floor way crammed could take 15 min move around club     The club nice but way overpriced overcrowded    The marquee definitely better hakkasan   would pay anywhere near amount hakkassan again   but never know unless play game ! <EOR> An otherwise enjoyable club marred inconsistent rules enforcement some unfriendly security  pose issues form questions A Why did require member party remove sunglasses?  random overbearing   B Why did permit some tables fill overflow way way beyond capacity but then harass other groups where members stood?   C Considering edm dj playing why your security overbearing use led rave lights? Photons In all three cases nothing harmful being done yet security consistent presence regarding those things throughout night despite none being wasted rude others   club let people some fun if aren't hurting anyone    There other Las Vegas clubs less strict random nonsense  attending those ones future  guess group doesn't match want Hakkasan <EOR> Well definitely better replaced   Studio 54  place opposite upscale   Calvin Harris DJ'd Saturday  He did fine  kind disappointed miss Steve Aoki Thursday Deadma5 Friday  would think Saturday would prime time night  Oh well hear Tiesto going resident DJ  Great sound system light show    actually probably best light show seen any Vegas nightclub yes including XS Marquee Tao Tryst Lavo Surrender Pure    I don't know wait normally but 10 30 p m  when arrived ushered right no wait at all   However probably notable two booths 6+ magnum bottles Ciroc berry plus 2 3 12+ party thin gals early twenties wearing short dresses heels  heard around midnight telling guys waiting line did reservations pre sale tickets admission would $200  could just Hakkasan's way telling people getting in   Hakkasan *packed* which like but then grand opening weekend we'll see if stays packed relevant some time passed novelty worn off  <EOR> ********************* 1123 *********************       Hakkasan Nightclub BEST DJs world now resident DJs seriously else want?       Yes costs arm leg table here  Yes might dress Music Video Hoe in     just know right host        Those enjoy it  Those don't hate passion  if Vegas prepare spend baby! <EOR> Crazy lines unless bottle service sure worth wait money  Music good but hard dance when sardines   Reduce table service better experience other people  <EOR> I'm picky clubs hate all clubs besides Marquee thought nothing par Marquee  However club impressed me  high expectations based mixed reviews came WOWed out  during EDC Thurs night Hardwell yes packed crazy  But expect? Vegas club big name EDM dj's!   Got prepaid tix line before midnight NO WAIT  process smooth check ID check tickets stamped IN  DONE  Take elevators actual dance floor  excellent thing need point its BOUNCERS  FRIENDLY  WTF?! All bouncers encountered douches  But guys answered BF's questions mines ease tried help us  incredibly nice both inside outside bouncers  ones inside super nice when trying find hip hop room  HUGE PROPS  If Hakka keep they'll definitely attract much larger crowd    Upon entering lights blew away  Blue pink lights PRETTY! dance floor main EDM area HUGE bigger Marquee  several bars sides your drinks  looking hip hop area just check before settled Hardwell but found using floor EDM specific weekend  bouncer guided another area lounge thats connected HAKKA! walked EMPTY! Hella chairs tables empty bar chill  recommend everybody use bathroom drinks rest your feet etc  Omg can't believe empty  People complaining where sit? You're looking hard enough  all Vegas club $ off bottle service  No sitting given used it   Anyways during Hardwell dance floor packed course but incredibly FUN  lights amazing  screens visuals very clean new graphics looked AMAZING  didn't want leave but near 4am  Tiesto came surprisingly dance Hardwell    AMAZING!   Want great EDM music lights lasers visuals? COME HAKKA  girls ram outfits dancing above stage AWESOME  amused dance moves forgot Hardwell    I definitely back now  blows XS water  sure GL works regular weekends but I'd just buy tickets avoid line hassle  Only $20 girls! <EOR> Sausage Fest gave them another chance again very very bad quality nightclub LiL jon playing night packed but Sausage Fest men all over place hungry couldn't even dance security rude fighting people just trying bar spend money you    guys need take some serious notes Marquee Tao because even though both strip ain't same level  <EOR> Eek! thinks not!   Coming Hakkasan high expectations  Only because hear some best DJ's world  interior exterior nice but over top fancy    I came night DADA LIFE performing  excited  came around 10 11 pm started lining guest list friends  most confusing things ever because MULTIPLE lines different  tickets promoter staff guest list regular guest list etc  Every time asked bouncer where would tell all confusing    Coming friends climb stairs  lots stairs  Why much stairs?! even 2 4 steps stairs bar! need remodel place turn those stairs into ramps because dangerous especially if no guidance if you're effed drunk  But then again maybe  why those annoying security guards bouncers flash flashlight your face floor  bouncers security cocky because if stand side anywhere even just rest enjoy drink listen music chit chat friend they'll tell move way  Where else if can't even sit down? Apparently down middle nowhere hallway where can't even hear music anymore!   Dance floor small! friends tried hip hop floor any floor good music couldn't past 3 5 people because literally no moving space  small person felt even tinier dance floor 5 inch heels because everyone would look down while trying way around dance floor dance  When friends middle couldn't even dance because NO SPACE even move  left  If want dance best place probably dancing hallway table  but even then  enough space still sucks  hot sweaty floor because crowdedness  Hard breathe too!   If want better service space only way happen if table  Other good luck even getting anywhere tiny club    Good thing free cause would've upset if pay enjoy time here  Don't think coming back again  <EOR> I've club 3 times    Well 2 technically  My first time couple years back see Calvin Harris  haggled bottle service host door allowed $2 000 min 4 people  table given far back couldn't even see DJ  no security protecting random people crashing party far worst bottle buying experience ever had   About year horrible experience dragged into club again some friends wanted see particular EDM artist  time knew better waste money bottles just paid entry purchased drinks inside  roamed around nightclub wondered club most expensive build Vegas? Once again impressed place during round 2  My 3rd final attempt good time last weekend  actually comped suite MGM because fair amount large wagering Mlife properties  Even hotel guest upper tier players card name VIP guestlist turned away door because LITERALLY 1 01am  when evidently close those lists  then told person guarding door Hey friends birthday plane delayed  fast could  happily come buy your expensive drinks next 3 hours default back room break open own bottle    since only 1 minute cutoff let slide time? then basically repeated the line closed 1 00    This club worst  never back again   If you're looking legit club party Marquee! <EOR> This most ridiculous club experience entire life  high end night clubs all over world joke  put guest list resort promotion arriving casino proceeded wait line hour pass through six different gates where carded stamped patted down handed tickets carded again then led into overcrowded venue full early twenty something's all dressed exactly same nervously standing around  VIP area virtually empty but took most dance floor area front stage  DJ opened played before main event Steve Aoki worst ever experienced  He'd play 15 seconds track people dancing then stop track dead silence 5 seconds before repeating cycle TWO HOURS   I ordered rail gin soda 21 dollars   glad didn't pay into overpriced sausage fest  <EOR> I great DJs spin but really club worst  layout awful way packed  Don't bother unless table  <EOR> I last Friday night celebrating birthday friend's birthday   table reserved Ling Ling Club absolutely no issues getting in   could see people could confused but new place still working kinks   think most might remember when some other popular clubs opened tons issues well time fixed that   Give Hakkasan chance everything fine   I am also pretty easily entertained but don't lot patience    neither problem night   escorted table a corner booth Ling Ling Club which surprisingly crowded 11pm night   seen lot complaints being nowhere stand if don't table well saw bunch people plenty room stand in aisle    We absolute BLAST!  server busser awesome provided great service security very nice music bumpin!  nothing ghetto music ever listened hip hop before?  DJ played good mix current old school music group danced butts off   We did explore rest club because happy where EDM really thing can't really speak rest club   But am REALLY happy Hakkasan offers something hip hop lovers   crowd night seemed all enjoy themselves but probably came write bad reviews later    consider night success   The only negative thing would say good idea stairs main exit end night   lot intoxicated people interesting departure when try down stairs your heels few cocktails   Other beautiful space! <EOR> I'm getting old  Well oldish  know fact thought going nightclub paying exuberant prices buy drink crammed next hundreds other humans some small dance floor just doesn't appetize anymore I mean does really anyone?   cure might ever slightly Hakkasan    Okay please take statement grain Nevada sand lot Hakkasan still emanate classic club perels  Yes still crowded  Yeah drinks won't cheapest  course place packed   and yet there's space at least space night entered massive club sister semi recent trip Vegas     Perhaps lucky because Hakkasan brings some heavy hitter DJs you'll probably see hikes everything mentioned above  But any review only attest experience when things pretty darn good no upper echelon disk jockey present just Borgeous      To start plenty promoters scattered MGM Grand well Las Vegas Blvd help remove high entry pricing which clubs usually throw you  sis strolled prime club time saw plenty people clambering enter but line moved rather quickly  maybe three I D  checkpoints stamp needed but some anything when aren't allowed in   And find well themed contemporary styled nightclub Asian flare  Hakkasan does dining non club nights well using restaurant portion help increase size place when DJs spinning  also helps giving way some areas sit without need bottle purchase   also plenty standing spots  did most time buying said single respectably priced drink   for club   Yeah nicely sized dance floor space but place wasn't empty would've interesting try combat other clubbers    Overall Hakkasan worthy nightclub experience when find yourself Sin City  Remember still club don't expect something world but would certainly return again that tentatively free entry helps   Borderline 3 5 rounded due positive evening and because number being higher better age   <EOR> Went first time lastnight   super happy score guest list free entry night $30 40 cover in    girl checking extremely snobby asking ids then asking why gave mine if name wasn't list because asked looking me   ? entry breeze    upon entry club popping off    hip hop night music lots private parties confetti everywhere  Two beers cost $22  Bartender ran tab card   ventured into empty table areas take selfie man immediately told security couldn't stand lol  Then crammed into general area bit then decided done proceeded cash bar  bartender took card busy asked another wasn't doing anything but stacking glasses card he responded total attitude stating he could help because he doesn't know am need wait other bartender become available  Seriously???

Lazy  Bottom line place awesome if pay table bottle service $1 000 5 000 pop  Honestly though don't think I'd spend kind money club wasn't better any others vegas  Probably try some others next time town  place came off little cocky me  <EOR> I'm right now am sitting next someone works told if continue ask where credit card which gone 30 minutes he  kick out  cannot imagine worse place spend night then place where people people exist  <EOR> Stood entire time but guess what? Beggars can't choosers  Other overpriced drinks Thursday night crowd mixed beautiful looking locals visitors all over world  Bouncers very friendly accommodating  Would recommend friends visiting Vegas visit Hakkasan sure! <EOR> This spot probably worst new nightclubs all Vegas  Hakkasan misses mark nearly all facets nightclub business  place crowded disorganized pretty confusing around  Honestly tried place couple times still doesn't compare likes Marquee XS even newer Omnia  typically bottle service even bottle service Hakkasan misses mark tables odd locations making your way dance floor absolute mess  much else add other fact Hakkasan kinda stinks relative other Vegas nightspot options    Pros Location Lighting  DJs  Within MGM   Cons Crowded Confusing  Stairs suck  VIP service  Bottle service  Not par competition  Bars <EOR> This place terribly ran  telling friend couldn't free locals July 3rd because holiday weekend when other friends 20 minutes earlier locals  hell that?

What?  $19 each well Vodka Red Bull?  take water rocks please   Let's start beginning   able guest list because cool I actually really am though but because Thursday heaps promoters spinkled down strip   felt quite special walking into club bypassing regular folks   For all hype place lot smaller imagined   appeared main dance floor off side upstairs area suitable some restricted dancing but mostly standing    This cool place if you're into EDM music enjoy being stripped your personal bubble rubbing elbows eardrums young beautiful    IDK would back?  think past prime bedtime  <EOR> I live Las Vegas  place sucks  XS all way  don't care good DJ yes love Tiesto but would rather stick head port a potty back dump  more fun car driving away Hakkasan club itself  thought first time might fluke tried multiple times even general consensus all locals except ones work hate it  <EOR> Oh Hakkasan fell love first visit! being Vegas during EDC weekend madness  girls bought tickets advance since Calvin Harris DJ night   I surprised quickly really wasn't line which plus  girls decided grab drinks bar before hitting dance floors  drinks weren't strong but weren't watered down either  drinks however little pricey $75 three vodka redbulls but guessing could little pricier usual due EDC weekend fight weekend   The dance floor decent size but course super packed  music good if you're into EDM  Calvin Harris made appearance around 1 45 am but he well worth wait  Such awesome experience   I definitely visit again if EDM your thing then Hakkasan must while Vegas  <EOR> The more clubs especially Vegas more realize probably more lounge guy opposed club guy   show lights music women  don't insane crowds being packed sardines getting drinks spilled ridiculous cover fees insane prices alcohol kids trying Bruno Mars look a like dancing having emotional breakdown dance floor  Maybe just getting old but just doesn't seem anymore   When passed through MGM thought Hakkasan looked pretty cool mention only few steps away didn't walking commuting down strip there   plan check once night rolled around   I line kind late 10 45 because figured maybe I'd XS instead since never but changed mind headed back Hakkasan   Needless say wait general admission line good 45+ minutes before getting in   Since somewhat spur moment thing hadn't checked cover fee halfway through line asked $50   really wanted pay just inside but since awhile already said screw did anyway  proudest moment but figured just wouldn't drink anything  hear drinks close $15 each anyway anything over $9 $10 pretty much rip off even Vegas standards   The decor inside pretty cool  Simple but nice   didn't find cool interior Tao cool pictures seen XS but overall wasn't bad   Multiple levels several views main DJ performance stage large dance floor several restrooms tons booths bottle service   As big venue appears packed really quickly   dance floor insanely crowded much navigation nearly impossible    Tons people getting drinks spilled them getting bumped into ever nanosecond worst all friggin' hot   Tons people dancing around drenched sweat bumping into throwing elbows etc  while dehydrating took toll 30 45 minutes before decided enough off floor    occasionally confetti being dumped above fog mist being blasted floor which should happened more frequency due temperature floor   tons kids floor some whom didn't even look near 21 but then again  really concern anyway  Vegas    I ended finding place stand behind bottle service tables watched main show there  main show DJ duo called Dada Life name rang bell but aside didn't really strike chord me   actually hoping more see Tiesto performs regularly but alas wasn't nights   music so so but show pretty impressive lots lights lasers choreographed dancers huge banana shaped inflatables beach ball style even pillows being thrown roof into crowd add carnage   cool scene just sure mine   This club just okay   Cover fees steep especially considering fact prices drinks steep   Bad combo   Clubs crowded Vegas but guess getting little less tolerant insane crowds mention having anywhere sit down just becomes exhausting   don't regret coming but same time kind wish would original feeling gone XS instead   Basically each time club Vegas fight crowds find probably going more lounge guy now on  If going drop lot cash drinks etc  might well style comfort Hakkasan pretty much solidified notion  If end going another club Vegas probably end going XS somewhere where feel little more value entertainment getting   just wasn't Hakkasan   mean real fun  just wasn't real fun  <EOR> We came Saturday before Halloween  PACKED  lot people dressed awesome costumes   Hakkasan different rooms small pathways stairs elevators  easy lost here  Every room extremely crowded   The main floor course packed  no space between people  But managed stay main dance floor while Hardwell played  music absolutely awesome!

The top floor all tables  Don't bother coming unless table  no space really look down dance floor unless you're table  only look afar  Might well downstairs   Overall enjoyed time I didn't even any drinks! which heard $20 pop    mainly because Calvin Harris put good show  I'd come back again DJ's really because venue which bad but nothing innovative special  <EOR> This best nightclubs Vegas   Friday night packed   would definitely recommend buying tickets advance online avoid long line   Pros two different floors lower floor little more chill crowded   Cons definitely very pricey especially guys upper level insanely crowded  <EOR> If going anything fun please cancel your credit card use it  try charge your card again  spend time calling credit card company just verify purchase didnt make  Dont ever think back again  party 8 birthday party  told no cover  Guess what? When asked pay $50 per head even though host told repeatedly didnt pay  <EOR> Came again see Cash Cash OMG best night ever spent Vegas  through same promoter did last year walked right through guest list line  Probably look 10 minutes tops  Unfortunately arrived 11pm otherwise probably would've gotten drink tickets  still complaints place ie fan layout small dance floor no outdoor area places sit gets very overcrowded  However sucked because wanted see Cash Cash    The house DJ opened Cash Cash alright  played lion king remix which odd but overall listening music wasn't horrible way spend 2 hours  Cash Cash 1 AM which great considering lot night club's performers Vegas don't until 2 3 AM I'm looking Drais    Cash Cash's performance amazing!!

Partied recently Vegas   what amazing time   Great memories dancing here  <EOR> Located inside MGM Resort club definitely hottest places Las Vegas Strip  When Marquee wouldn't let because boy all tatted face came hopes wouldn't hate us  only did Hakkasan grant admission but very reasonable guy price cover  club definitely favorites terms layout  dance floor huge plenty bar space great EDM talent resident DJs  night glad seen Nervo rock house! Overall if looking Vegas nightclub experience then definitely your way Hakkasan  <EOR> First off let's getting pretty simple guys should buy presale tickets unless you're getting bottle service girls free names guestlist  Just find promoter  problem Hakkasan should 2 different guestlist lines general guestlist another girls only! pretty self explanatory guys meet some ladies right!? if all girls line hour supposed meet them???  If want dance floor Hakkasan sure your work it  stairs top stairs dance floor  Once there's good chance you're going feel you're part herding cattle farm  gets super crowded!  Despite all negatives Hakkasan no problem getting all biggest DJs all over world perform  <EOR> I am giving Hakkasan 3 stars simply because operations did seem run nicely space incredible   However please understand if simply reviewing bottle service experience would give Hakkasan 1 star     Let's first start main DJ being Tiesto   music isn't totally style but he engaged crowd visual effects awesome!  sound system Hakkasan also something note electronic music lovers!  line getting wasn't anything because table   Although line elevator madhouse all bouncers seemed confused       Why bottle service experience ridiculously terrible server would literally push people way without even attempting ask them move first   pictures pushing guest roughly she nearly fell    she did spill entire drink hand which came shared bottles    She also would walk middle groups taking pictures simply pickup napkin booth top? bouncer would remove uninvited people table because he said nah two them work other five friends first dibs anywhere since you're closest Tiesto win    serious? busser ?? male server's assistant?? turned final Goose bottle finish last swig alcohol   brought table owner if he said he did 3 4 Goose bottles ordered but final bottle easily full drink left   Wow    And before douchebags Yelp think am being petty table actually being table    please note    partied hardest them country around world   never treated any other club Vegas NYC Chicago LA Dubai beyond   Additionally crew group very intelligent kind successful people  never heard many uses Please  Thank nightclub did very night     As such     Hakkasan your servers ugly inside out   should learn definition hospitality because industry you're apparently your service staff trash doesn't understand CUSTOMER PAYS BILLS   customer your boss   serve customer     Quite frankly server lucky wasn't paying bill   would tipped anything  And actually bill didn't tip anything she marched back shook head said Uh Uh handed back receipt tip  Again nice group people just gave in    but tip deserved  And Vegas nightclub?  HA  #wannabes <EOR> BOOTH GALORE! This place most booths seen place  cray  This place literally covered booths  Capitalizing!  We booth right side stage  Sunday Hip Hop fyi  Rev Run made appearance towards end night   The main dance floor crowded hell but braved because needed change scene booth   Then security guards asked if wanted dance upstairs  said 'yes ' shouldn't surprised booth upstairs guys wanted girls booth  great view stage    This club used Studio 54 back 3 years ago    full douche bags  They've constructing every time visited  first time open since there   What other Yelpers said all stairs true  All little levels pretty cray when think all drunk people trying around club  Just sayin' <EOR> WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! husband discriminately picked crowd harassed staff because thought ID fake even though he carries old expired still provided backup credit card matching name  Then looked down try find something wrong outfit even though he wearing dress code attire  lines Disneyland ride line long ridiculous  Besides point being guest list free admission everyone else line  then asked 5 more times line checked ID  WORSE airport security checkpoint  Trying over horrible experience line proceed inside grab drink bar $50 3 drinks  Outrageous  Then proceed small dance floor surrounded chains reserved tables again more security  suited employees staring husband whispering each other constantly gathering around making both feel very uncomfortable  staff extremely rude act much better you  never felt more disrespected person all free club  left right away NEVER back  place joke won't last long  Calvin Harris good DJ but he deserves better place seems  all Hakkasan ever book DJ  Completely OVERRATED!!!!!! <EOR> Came bachelor party   bottle service over priced but  expected   Great atmosphere music   night women beautiful friendly   Staff definitely did job making feel comfortable drinks ices cups   best club but definitely there  <EOR> Horrible!!!

While line bouncer splashed some kind disgusting liquid all over did proceed apologize all  Then proceed kick line when did nothing wrong trying find sister inside cause birthday ruined letting all  Hakkasan rudest club ever come across no should ever ever ever come  never worth your money your time  <EOR> Like any club Vegas LA if bottle service real quick  Fortunately girlfriend's friend Friday night happen higher girl guy ratio  place cool pretty big course great sound system  bathrooms attendants very nice even without tips they'll offer some gum way out  think all Vegas clubs very similar just blast EDM music now said if table high girl guy ratio entrance could fairly easy  Drinks $15 per bar although didn't see bottle service bill am sure anywhere $1 000 $10 000 bottle  But Vegas supposed lose money right?

PROMOTER contacted Dan Stak 702 824 3234 he able friends free! 2 guys 6 girls   He very informative texting sure right line answering all questions   He even came find line sure taken care of   would highly recommend into Hakkasan he guest list Wet Republic too!  WAIT line around 9 45 line near Rainforest Cafe first wait small line labeled guest list then move over general admission line   wait hour until into club did feel long but line moved pretty quickly   checked IDs gave stamps ahead time checked iPads before process pretty seamless   ATMOSPHERE Once walk around main floor where pretty big dance floor tables surrounding it   further into ling ling club which where hip hop music is   dance floor TINY although super dead when first could see going super packed time everyone in   drinks expensive only OK charge water!!  Another sucky thing lot fog everywhere pictures horrible! weird fog haze them hard edit Hip hop room music wasn't bad start old school then move into more modern stuff but left around 12am EDM room see Martin Garrix   The EDM room seems big but super crowded   found spot didn't want move because would IMPOSSIBLE back into crowd   No room really dance but merely stand maybe wave your hand if can   People kinda pushy spill drinks easily _    left 1 30am because just wasn't fun anymore     Overall if want check say you've maybe wait until dies down some   venue really pretty nice but just crowded don't space even enjoy good hip hop music  <EOR> Have agree many other reviews  past weekend Fri Sat Tiesto Calvin  Fri no table tried hang upstairs  absolutely nowhere stand upstairs allows see DJ  Unless balcony front table NO view  eventually found abandoned balcony table hung couple hours but otherwise would wasted night   For Sat great table  nice little elevated area floor could see DJ perfectly  However all tables below looking through all people standing tables ahead them  great set them  would furious if sat there   Table service good but $5 7k would expect reason rate anyone very highly   The layout left lot desired  hallways club tiny fit only 1 2 people wide  Why?? walkway bathroom table required walk through area between bar railing which 6 feet wide no security keep people moving  entire half club stuck walking through congested little walkway  Why??    Plus no outdoor access club   Having Marque XS would recommend those over HK moderate margin  Worth seeing but without any outdoor space break evening you're stuck inside feels cramped space   The downstairs hip hop room 3rd floor just OK   Ling Ling Lounge also 3rd floor but pretty small feeling again no outdoor spaces   We used Red Carpet VIP into club Sat would recommend them highly  <EOR> Worst experience life  why 1  Over crowded  2  music just techno hip hop section very small barely plays hip hop  3  felt warehouse 4  Over crowded could even move 5  don't check bags which kind scary Bc could take anything there  6  prepared pay 11 dollars water    I don't mind techno but could barely enjoy myself Bc club over crowded  <EOR> The male guests place sexual predators  female friends grabbed multiple times different men security did nothing  If don't understand touch people without consent then probably shouldn't allowed club  bouncers need better job vetting guests  disgusting place  Stay alert predators especially if woman  <EOR> I Hakkasan Nightclub Calvin Harris show  purchased tickets online before coming Vegas  arrived early didn't any hassle getting into club  Hakkasan Nightclub different rooms playing different music   great idea IMO  few rooms each room cool   club some cool décor  Calvin Harris set packed sardines  impossible move any way without bumping into someone  XS packed max night David Guetta wasn't congested this  know its Vegas but cramped no space cool IMO  Calvin Harris gave great show! warm DJ did good job well  experience definitely meh   personally wouldn't come back special show  might huge might come back normal night  give Hakkasan Nightclub 2 5 rating  <EOR> I've two times  first time Bingo Players known act but didn't bring insane crowds  guest list fairly quickly 30 min wait   room walk around   Most recently Calvin Harris  also guest list but line incredibly long  sucked decided pay because felt would considering place line  Upon seeing crowded when entered right   first time friend asked much $50 ladies  5 min later friend came rest guest list line moved $60 already even though she asked same guy   Warning ladies tons stairs  Don't wear your highest heels anything uncomfortable since down stairs when leave no elevator public use Also super crowded inside club which understandable since Calvin Harris  If didn't VIP good luck trying find somewhere stand other dance floor  Everywhere stood security came told move  weren't standing anyone's VIP area blocking anything   The drinks typical price size no complaints   I would come back only if someone huge there   My only positive night seeing Calvin Harris! Lived expectations! <EOR> I'm re reviewing Hakkasan because yelp removed last review no fair reason     My wife last year GREAT time inside club!  Why one star review?   Because security people run line both CLUELESS DUMB WELL mean brutal   Personally didn't problem   But two parties around one foreign didn't know English well  other person bit drunk HARASSED kicked around trash   Brutal!    don't approve because 1 Foreign non English speaking  cut them break crying loud!
