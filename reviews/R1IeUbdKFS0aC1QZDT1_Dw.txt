I going give star but speed service really can't special price $4 99! add star you   but sure your staff more clear what's available what's not! <EOR> After long night going getting pho next day must!

OK came highly advertised Grand Opening special Pho D'licious $4 99 small bowl pho + drink your choice macaron   Hard resist   feeding family 3 under $20 without serving fast food?  Yeah there!  Although retrospect ended spending way more dinner thanks rest menu!  So yep bowls grand opening pho Pho Dac Biet sure   Comes rare steak brisket flank meatball tendon topped onions green onion   Bowl sure small side ordering large bowl cost couple extra bucks per person   appreciate side basil raw jalapeno limes bean sprouts   But am weird saying don't bean sprouts already par boiled?  came table which guess your soup doesn't cold when eat it   ended asking another side bean sprouts raw   Much better   crunch when eat them hot pho broth   Bowls Pho Dac Biet pretty good par other places tried before town   Noodles cooked right tendon simmered down well lot chew   Other meats bit scarce but small bowl pho?  Thankfully meats indeed rare thin sliced cooked nicely hot broth   But broth?  tad salty side me   pretty good detecting MSG diet lips turn red when consume it   All say oh yeah pho broth decent amount MSG it   Which some point gotta forgive rare you're gonna find place simmers bones stock all day long flavor   if won't paying $4 99 bowl   Overall though bad bowl pho   Thai tea OK very sweet beware come SMALL cup!  Luckily glass water tide over too   kid macaron can't remember which flavor exactly but she liked it   it wasn't dry nice texture   Why ask bill over $20 3 people Grand Opening special?  Because damn rolls Pho D'licious!  OMG!   more namesake!  D'licious!  would order few plates rolls some San Miguel or some other beloved Asian beer like sit front TV town!!
