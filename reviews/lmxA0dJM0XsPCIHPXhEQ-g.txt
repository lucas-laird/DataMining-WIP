However whole dinner experience worst boyfriend had  bought dinner show package Valentine's day dinner prepaid  showed 7pm show 9 30pm  couple minutes being seated Caesar came over offered some water told server would can't remember name but assuming she's new   Maybe 5 minutes later server came over take drink food orders  table across drinks food before even drinks before them  took 15 minutes just drinks only because told Caesar didn't yet  20 minutes later Caesar saw didn't food he check waitress didn't even put order in  Finally food came happy Caesar checking us  Half way through meal brought boyfriend another drink didn't ask for   When asked Caesar box he told original waitress box which took 5 minutes  then ask bill 10 minutes later 8 50pm she comes back says she manager check prepaid receipt  5 minutes later manager comes down looks receipt then says what's question? When told just waiting final bill he seemed confused why waitress even called over  left 9 15 show  finally bill charged two boyfriends drinks even though only ordered one  would corrected them but didn't want wait another 20 mins waitress figure she doing    Long story short waitress needs better training shouldn't waitress if she can't handle more table time    I recommend place atmosphere entertainment food  Definitely ask Caesar's table  <EOR> You Rock Sake Rok!!

Plus conveniently located across Park Theatre next T Mobile theatre within Monte Carlo Hotel area  <EOR> Food decent  Place clean liked interior designs location  Service nice but ordering hassle  could only order 5 things off buffet menu time  Meaning 1 piece sushi already 1 5 ordering 5 each time hassle  Could better if just however many asked since buffet  Order 5 pieces sushi 2 people every 10 20 minutes annoying  Other ordering process good  <EOR> I'm sure Sake Rok such high rating  very disappointed  food okay but completely overpriced  4 piece roll 2 pieces nigiri house Chardonnay $50  show few dancers did competition between N Sync Backstreet Boys  mean year it??? decor kind cool bathroom attendant sweet  would suggest going somewhere else sushi though  <EOR> I truly wanted love place given staff kind welcoming     But both Matt felt food stayed otherwise   All plates beyond salty even enjoy    The bottle sake worst sake ever being Hollister CA    And think just   salt over all    Matt had Crispy rice appetizer think 50¢ quarter sized rice centimeter high soaked salty sauce topped spicy tuna     may hold off sauce? actually asked taken back waiter more welcome take off bill us    We also tried scallops here    unfortunately salty well  Decorated green chives foam top veggies bottom    Matt said if he didn't order side rice food would've eatable      We two rolls  forget names but both spicy side  Salty well   I'm sure if salt accidentally spilled food or     people don't mind but literally left half food     Mind came $110 bill including tip    mediocre sushi    There's many employees standing around feel just kinda staring dining room people eating   weird  <EOR> This second visit Sake Rok since opened appears management shake worse occurred since last visit  Unfortunately time overall experience failed expectations  Most food heavily salted actually forgot sushi rolls said its way  Really? music pathetic playing N'Sync Backstreet Boys songs place called Sake Rok  However did enjoy dancers overall entertainment because tried hard entertain kudos them! But far worst part service because server disappeared more often he appeared  flag down many times just service if could find him!!! based experience many other Japanese themed Strip restaurants choose never coming back  <EOR> If you're looking trendy hipster dining experience above average Japanese food may place you    As mentioned other reviews folks really pride themselves entertainment factor dancing singing etc if you're looking unique experience I'd really suggest because lots people having fun    However did seem take away service delivery dining side We seated Door which open chilly evening  asked door closed moved  told door couldn't closed ? but when realized reservations which prohibited being moved finally closed door  However end meal opened door again  close end meal didn't push issue but draft pretty annoying   Food comes its prepared  Bussers  very quick bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away we'd ask additional plates silverware couple occasions   We ordered Brussel sprouts which never arrived  When asked end meal sure weren't charged server said still being cooked over hour point   paid bill server said food still coming even though weren't being charged  finished drinks but another 15 minutes done still no Brussel sprouts left  still hungry but still      They push Sake bombs pretty hard place  no prude any means more few day when emcee came over introduce herself starred pushing them said would buy round if she joined us  She said sounded awesome would join bought round table her  However when shots came she made excuse why she couldn't take shot  No big deal but because hard sell felt bit bait switch   These things all easily fixed when place solid 4 if you're looking kind vibe experience  Until then solid 3  <EOR> The Goods 1  First time sushi raw fish loved it   scared but just tastes good  2  Yellow tail tacos yum mainly taste he citrus sauce  3  Delicious cocktails shots   Service  1  Friendly definitely wild 2  guy kept hosting party very wild same bombs! Only Vegas  3  Sometimes dance bar tables show seen  Ambiance  1  Dim clubby  2  Feels hip stylish bit funk 3  Fairly priced   MoJo 1  Try shots shrimp !!! <EOR> I no idea getting into when made reservations Sake Rok  Reservations weekend likely good idea arrived dinner many patrons waiting outside 100+ heat waiting table    Everything looked normal first but within minutes lights loud music blasted staff came running wigs glasses began dancing bar around restaurant  pleasant fun surprise bachelorette celebration but those family trying nice quiet sushi meal should look elsewhere  host complete crack up  He wild crazy makeup luscious long curls way if your natural hair very flamboyant outfits he changed regularly throughout meal  He did excellent job keeping restaurant alive engaged     Our table ordered sake bomb special which $80 included very small pony keg beer two porcelain tokkuri sake  enough 14 sake bombs which made them $5 70 each  host came over did while announcing entire process restaurant over microphone    The sushi expensive but admit  because come land affordable all eat sushi Northern Nevada  Each roll $20 plus minus few dollars  Side items edamame miso etc  $6 each  ended being very expensive outing group 8 but atmosphere really fun lively food fine    Certainly best sushi ever but if found myself back Vegas friends looking fun meal I'd return  <EOR> After 2 day tournament teammates ready wrap weekend nice sushi dinner  Little did know Sake Rok store us! thought going fun dinner good conversation turned all plus singing dancing sake bombs! food delicious staff worked set price point created varied menu which huge help large group ours    I would highly recommend Sake Rok any groups looking good time Vegas! won't regret it! <EOR> It's bit pricey but amazing service clever entertainment  happened birthday ended having wonderful time somewhat unexpectedly! !

Well wrong wanted meal final meal Vegas unfortunately rolls baby rolls very flavorful  honest did switch rolls bit maybe original roll would tasted better but way beyond small mean tiny !! chefs definitely perfected craft cutting thinnest slices possible avocado smallest crab meat put roll less size pinky finger rolls aren't cheap aren't paying presentation because come plain white serving tray aren't paying quantity because small could only assume your paying show comes meal which didn't because missed hour came early  suggest coming when show least some entertainment  please please please order your drink no ice !! Because paid $14 cup ice flower taste ok nothing spectacular! roll did change still wanted shrimp just spicy shrimp mentioned possibly changing crap but opted guess waiter didn't hear because he still ordered crab $5 more something didn't want  sure if dj music loud he didn't hear wasn't paying attention but way paying more something don't want didn't best flavor true disappointment  overall atmosphere place nice decent amount seating   did take while roll place wasn't packed all sure if waited rolls because someone party ordered hanger steak takes while just take long time rolls because prefect art making mini rolls lol way happy your own judgement hopefully tips help better experience! hanger steak told delicious  stars for  Maybe review wouldn't harsh if seen value buying but since no show small amount food only lead disappointment wouldn't suggest offer free edamame miso soup them lower prices pre event meals   <EOR> Best place sushi show Vegas HANDS DOWN! wouldn't recommend any other place besides here  Great music host VERY entertaining well servers waitresses  Loved drinks well! must visit when visiting Vegas  <EOR> This place fun! never such vibrant sushi spot  food delicious! going back  <EOR> Disappointing during day  could see place raging night being completely different experience   But since lunch review honestly  least 3 members waitstaff hungover give shit bartender couldn't figure pour Sapporo IPA ANYTHING but sweet! saved Hamilton   charged beers bill corrected   The rolls soup just fine  2x price increase Las Vegas strip   Recommendation Cancel lunch offer lunch specials reasonable price waitstaff knows work early hour 12 30  <EOR> Sake Rok amazing! food great service terrific entertainment spectacular! recommend going Annahita bar!

Gotta try El Chapo roll!! <EOR> Dinner show then another show! sushi menu lot creative variations standards  serve sake cold only which guess fine    Also put sugar wasabi  All things considered might safety measure  No harm no foul  there's entertainment  DJ band sorts geisha really put gay geisha   fun! expecting quiet place samisen music but thinking? Vegas strip! course low key! One comment water tastes little hinky mineral    small investment carbon filter would long way  But hell actually drinks water strip?

Definitely place check out  <EOR> As would expect sushi awesome ! But let's talk something wouldn't expect place OMG chicken ! I couldn't believe place reading magazine Vegas thought while around stadium  We sushi salmon varies rolls however really gob smacked chicken  The chicken bokchoy literally most perfectly moist dish ever crunchy outside just fell apart fork supplemented deep fired bokchoy complimented each other just right  <EOR> Had great time celebrating sister nephew's birthday @ Sake Rok!! staff emcee all awesome made first visit memorable one  def back again when come visit Vegas  Highly recommend!  PRUUUNNNE! Caesar voice <EOR> We Sake Rok during peak time early dinner only 2 4 other people dining when there  agree another reviewer over snooty hostesses but seated nice enough  place over staffed being slow probably ahead potential rush but appeared though lot staff watching talking diners  Even if weren't  felt  server nice kitchen very accommodating allergy double checked similar ingredients alright me  greatly appreciated attention detail chefs even relayed some questions well sure prepared something could eat  beverages refilled often food took appropriate amount time prepare  coconut rice came first absolutely delicious  We'd hesitated ordering starter but am glad ordered it  still thinking it! sushi rolls Avocado Tiger Filled Cream all fresh tasty  ingredients all evenly balanced within each roll  weren't during any live performances aware them but did see male performers makeup way out  short waiter kitchen manager ? cooks all great  1 hostess decent  weird vibe seemingly gossipy other employees clock may very well just bored  I'd still return  *this review posted multiple sites <EOR> Hello welcome Sake Rok  won't much say experience because far great  First menu thing crazy  want conversation discuss menu choices  damn big IMO  can't even remember meal well atmosphere beyond liking  am fogey any means but cup tea  Josie unimpressed felt did live hype  see fun place tourists but much  did good beer selection  took while drinks felt staff more interested each other us  Maybe why food didn't stand out  When customer service bad nothing else matters   Thank coming Sake Rok  back  Can't say may but impressed  Except beer choices  <EOR> I very disappointed restaurant  decor point music energy also point but think tourist trap  First sushi rolls small order bring main course appetizers drinks way rude  feel rush order prepared know want when want it  last expensive those annoying things  <EOR> When bunch girls NJ headed Las Vegas bachelorette party looking something unique fun different add schedule events  Sake Rok itself delivers fun in Vegas special experience even despite hiccups there   I'll start good  atmosphere place fantastic  edgey J pop punk vibe screams street literally! More below but basically whatever going inside broadcasted outside pavilion  restaurant    Keep mind Sake Rok peaceful dining experience  interactive energy fueled improv music show involves every person room don't come expecting anything less  host evening Carlos HYSTERICAL downright delightful  fashion sense slayed dancing on point jokes all stitches  best part? He gets DRINK SAKE BOMBS YOU  He leads into battle staying sober looks fabulous while doing so  Overall Carlos gets all gold stars    Even service pretty wonderful despite multiple waiters waitresses weighing you  Usually hate when restaurants many waiters thing but everyone act together super pleasant funny   Buuuuuuut say this  daresay people come Sake Rok just show because opinion food at least experience definitely getting door again  actual food tasted bad the little delicious just fine details overall eating experience missed mark   First all place overpriced YET over that  You're touristy section Vegas dining comes entertainment expect? totally forgive high price tag comes meal  Again thank Carlos  The menu items time extremely limited but seems menu changed few months since there  I actually look website could glance menu remind myself options surprised plentiful different items available  example slider small plates party member ordered came foie gras weird completely unnecessary topping even fancy Japanese place  appears taken off menu  Basically options sushi rolls personally fan weird combination carb and fish based small plates also fan expensive entree options  Let's real here  place wants bougie offer unique dining options but appeal masses somehow even if kitschy 'plain' dish  Things oysters tuna tartare grilled octopus all great 'different' options but way specific appeal multiple palettes  wasn't shell 40 bucks hangar steak  But having said menu clearly changed since don't base your opinion solely this   STILL! forgive all just entertainment factor vibe place  real gamechanger this  real issue portions pathetically small all ended getting trashed because very little food stomachs  restaurant literally encourages drink Sake Bombs something's gotta give  There's needs more drinker friendly options not just sushi rolls dumplings size quarters more 'available' options too  does drink sushi alone  Basically miniscule portions limited options combined high price made experience so so    If ever return Vegas give another chance based new menu see website entertainment factor  decor atmosphere place alone amazing! Don't wrong everyone party blast but food situation just brought experience down  can't crazy drink options food along just doesn't cut it  <EOR> The place great eye catching interior design  also located great spot park next T Mobile Arena welcome all foot traffic  sake bomb experience no matter small large reservation is  hired friendly knowledgeable staff also put live dance shows later night  Personal favorite dish menu Toban Yaki  <EOR> I held work event Sake Rok group blast Karaoke machine  service great! <EOR> THIS PLACE FUN!! Definitely if celebrating something birthday bachelorette party definitely deal feel special!   The food also amazing! Some best sushi ever had!   I would give place 5 stars if wasn't fact asked TWO waitresses if white wine sangria pineapple since someone party severe allergy both said no  She proceeded drink until mouth started feeling weird  She decided bar ask guess what    it pineapple it!!! Thank god she noticed quickly would've disaster!! <EOR> The server very attentive asking if any good allergies which told gluten chili all things ordered asked if ok  ordered 5 plates those 5 could only eat plate sashimi  Waste $120 when plain clearly asked if void things could eat  <EOR> Big disappointment  husband came birthday dinner seeing good reviews here  reservation still wait table  drinks bar while waited  husband let bartender know birthday bartender said he would let server know birthday  Thats cool although husband already told them birthday when he made reservation  When table waited good 5 10 minutes waitress  She said hostess didn't let know sat down which why took long take order    ordered food ate once arrived  food good but think place should $$$ instead just $$ because definitely pricier side   Meanwhile DJ going around tables giving birthdays shots  He never came table  check arrived husband specifically told again birthday server replied saying he would come back shot  He came back just processed credit card payment  point enough   I felt bad because husband trying birthday special told restaurant multiple times yet didn't acknowledge but acknowledged others    Between slow service price definitely won't recommending place friends  least great show disappointing dinner  <EOR> The beautiful well presented dishes fun loving enjoyable entertainment leave place without smile! menu classic yet eclectic service top notch must stop when Las Vegas! <EOR> Good sushi interesting entertainment loud but fun place quiet dinner  little high price guess paying entertainment  At first hated because loud but once settled fun  <EOR> Food pretty good  CRAZY atmosphere lots singing dancing DJ dressed Ninja come your table several times  Its lively environment but mostly college type environment  <EOR> Last night Mother's Day best friends decided eat Sake Rok since close hotel friends staying at  local industry walking restaurant numerous times really excited try place  When arrived sad looking hostess the young rude short blond hair asked if reservation told didn't  Mind no waiting no walked while waiting 10 minutes table put together which totally fine because table 8  patiently waiting hostess giving really mean looks made uncomfortable  She also turned best friend told she couldn't bring water bottle restaurant 3 year old child  hostess then told started music people started dancing another 5 10 minutes seat us  Just first impression excited anymore immediately left  walked Tom's Urban where seated immediately spent over $500 last nights dinner including generous tip gave awesome waiter! Sake Rok could great experience if hostess more welcoming but maybe she should back washing dishes if she can't seem put smile face turn customer service skills  bad really because first impression made immediately interested trying could really great sushi Vegas  Good luck see why Mother's Day big hit  <EOR> Decent food but little pricey side get  staff entertaining extra money you're spending come during day some all eat specials  If come night expect loud crazy party! 5 tiny pieces your roll  <EOR> Have say hands down best all around experience  Food much flavor service point  ENTERTAINMENT  must see!!
