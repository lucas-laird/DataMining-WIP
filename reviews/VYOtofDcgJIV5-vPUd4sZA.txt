Growing Texas loved CiCi's pizza excited when opened Vegas  8 PM  tonight place 25% full  no where sit because almost every table plates dirty buffet plates   first thought maybe just short handed  Right away noticed cashier kept filing salad dressings without washing hands  She touching everything! Money dirty rags trash then would fill salad move pizza around  pizza counter ask Pepperoni pizza ordered 20 minutes before forgotten it  stood noticed cashier pull pizza UNDERNEATH below pizza counter counter set under heat  horrified see sausage pizza sitting already cooked placed underneath heat lamp  left didn't even eat more plate food being disgusted slop fest CiCi's pizza  worst part cashier clearly did give two cents anyone eating dirty food  feel gross just knowing ate anything    The place dirty bathrooms graffiti  NEVER again eat here  <EOR> This CiCi's location definitely gotten better time  First time back since deadly police shooting say pleasant experience because wasn't bunch kids running around parents doing nothing it  sit where wanted because almost empty didn't listen jabber other people    One thing did notice put picture honoring 2 fallen police officers completely AWESOME! much respect them that   Food really good fresh shift manager eager anything wanted  Over all good experience  <EOR> This worse Cicis Las Vegas   bathroom filthy several tables sat trash plates them hour there   new lemon dessert looked nothing advertisement   Fresh pizza put till more people came in  <EOR> Ever those moments where want forget something ever happened? just those  eating CiCi's   In all young adult years never found reason complain pizza  cheap pizza higher end pizza  pay for generally expect  CiCi's different case however  Sure real cheap price all eat extravaganza but really worth it?   Maybe kid wouldn't mind place  Heck kid anything pizza related sounded good me  Combine two awesome foods mac cheese pizza? sounds childhood fantasy  But when actually having cardboard slice pizza macaroni cheese thrown top dumpster dived slice pizza found mac cheese residue top  pizza didn't taste good nor did mac cheese  Combine two exponential amount awful   Sure normal pizza traditional toppings  Thing taste similar pizza sat drunken dorm room week maybe worse  Then also crazy combination pizzas mac cheese Taco Bell style toppings thrown top which absolutely no sense all  Putting such low quality food combinations made taste buds weep tears sadness  night wouldn't surprised if half taste buds shut down sheer disappointment forever leaving palate senior citizen   Yes place all you can eat  All able handle 1 5 slices  done walked out    Never again said myself  Never again  <EOR> I fuck spot  buffalo hot sauce pizzas proly best pizza here  also love cheesy bread cinnamon rolls apple pizza  girl its $5 75 per adult but didnt drinks which $1 89 w o tax regular $2 29 w o tax large so came $12 43 including tax  id definitely recommend other people tryna grub budget! <EOR> This Cici's restaurant now under new management same owner    I am upping review 3 stars 2   I am hoping raise review 4 stars soon  e noticed improvement overall operation restaurant time new manager learned job   Keep good work  <EOR> This probably best overall Cici's ever to   Although isn't saying much but overall atmosphere pretty relax   I guess only compare Cici's used rainbow   When kind crowded but size establishment pretty big no really crammed together   Of course $6 all eat pizza nothing complain that   Average food love pizza quality isn't much factor me   announce new fresh pizza available   If area want stuff your face pizza check out   Conditions Return dragged girlfriend   Seriously don't live area  only condition  <EOR> I am ashamed much used frequent CiCi's  Yes knew name yes would bring cheese pizza every time there  boy did coupons boot! think average paid $2 50 each trip   I think salad delicious comparable Olive Garden  TOOOOO many black olives but hey do?!  Oh miss watching Veggie Tale previews over over over  <EOR> Granted Sunday evening bit busy but food bland scarce CiCi's   the women's restroom DISGUSTING but when told manager she seemed caring apologized sent someone right then clean it    didnt stick around find turned but future would rather drive across town different CiCis return here! <EOR> My first experience CiCi's pizza very good  reading  mixed reviews pleasantly suprised   Me roommate lunch Sat 3 7 15  two 2 buffets 2 large drinks came $17     The place family atmosphere also arcade area  tv's around particular day soccer game     There salad area soup area pizza area  noticed pizzas always well stocked  soups weren't anything special clam chowder chicken noodle mostly broth but prefer anyways  salad bar no cheese only iceberg lettuce  But did mushrooms  signature Italian dressing tasted similar Olive Garden!  As far Pizza really enjoyed it  thought sauce excellent fresh   lot cheese various toppings  very cool thing request pizza made order  roommate really liked that  he even Pan crust! posted picture it    Also drink station sweet unsweetened tea  ice crushed   Would return?

Cici's few years lunch break decided give try  place filled children usual pizza buffet line FULL! favorite sweet cinnamon rolls dessert section end    If don't children loud atmospheres then Cici's probably isn't place you  If love create your own pizza all then suggest give Cici's shot! <EOR> 309 n Nellis Our all time worst dinning experience The tables floors dirty If already paid walked out The ladies restroom smelled bad Had toilet paper towels all over the  floor Men restroom same No pride ownership We never back Kids left run wild No stars give post review <EOR> We're done place  now to go feel it   no longer cheese red pepper shakers table nor napkin dispenser  Everything all bunched around soda fountain lids side straws other!  The paper cups really classy touch   Oh yea main reason low level love adiosed memorial two officers lost lives 2014  No respect  <EOR> A neighbor swears Cici's best pizza urged check when chance   Based price expecting worst   Just good $5 buffet be?
