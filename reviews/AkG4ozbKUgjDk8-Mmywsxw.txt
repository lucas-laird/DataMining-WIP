PT's down street south side lake mead  place gone down hill lost business good! Happy hunger hunting everyone  <EOR> Stopped 9pm   Marine Corps Birthday Veterans Day just wanted quiet beer    busy few people bar gaming   Two bartenders both looked wife sat booth near bar   10 minutes later no service just walked spend money elsewhere   Used stop quite bit anymore   Waitress also saw and     nothing   Great service      <EOR> We use order location because food usually good close house they're open late  However say food getting downright sloppy  slim chance getting them anything certain way  don't bother customizations your order  9 times 10 screw something up  Last time husband ordered philly half sandwich just bread! Bozeman dip no dip? waste time  <EOR> Being born raised las vegas bars all over city first  tried charge drink while playing   LAS VEGAS BAR STANDARD 1 Drink $20 played   never told because happen drink Crown Royal $60 machine isn't worth 2 shots beer  rediculous far concerned   If you're looking game somewhere else obviously place counting pennies hard can't even afford take care serious gamers  <EOR> Slow service  place busy felt ignored waiter  food decent  Pretty sure debit card information stolen since next day fraudulent charges only time recently card site  <EOR> Had chicken Caesar salad  asked chicken blackened  Oops no blackening seasoning  served salad  chicken though sitting warm water quite while  Tasted watery soft  If would just put grill bit would made big difference  really service great  Just won't order again  <EOR> I friends visit Timbers weekends always great food great atmosphere  If coming going lake good place stop  <EOR> Went Timbers try brother thought food pretty good   Classic Cheesburger which pretty filling good flavor nothing would considered world renown but still appetizing   food portions where large enough easily satisfied hunger   also call mozzarella wedges those pretty delicious cheese really melty right taste   only complain would would fries little salty but other food good plus service phenomenal attentive <EOR> Food good  Deals good  Food specials mailer coupons  Girls friendly! Dont mind eating decent separate dining area bar  always plus  <EOR> Have visiting Timbers last two years never bad experience beer cold chicken fingers great atmosphere very nice  <EOR> Worst service northeast bar waiting 20 minutes drinks then waitress comes table refuses serve when asked why took long when only customers excuse she new  bartender told drinks made but she hadn't served them he didn't know why said he would serve talking but another 20 minutes passed waitress came back wouldn't even acknowledge those table spoke up  <EOR> Good food good service ask Cindy if she's there!    come lunch work sometimes  <EOR> I going Timbers over ten years   mother normally stop breakfast weekends   Sure times when swamped someone just walked walking wait table to be cleared but its expected when its busy   sitting Erin's section recently she point   She sweet personable always willing whatever she experience great   can't believe crap people write just complain when don't take whole situation into consideration   If table leaving walking table cleared yet   If even slightest problem your food correct situation   IF issues aren't dealt timely manner obviously haven't sat Erin's Cyndi's section   For amount food price good   food good bar food   only bad thing really say fan country    but its loud enough obnoxious music  <EOR> We eaten several times since near home nice place burger sandwich  rarely drink don't smoke can't really comment bar side smoke slightly annoying but really bad   First breakfast  hash browns just weird didn't taste anything normal hash browns but rest breakfast items very good including egg dishes french toast came large portions  Unfortunately if want change fries hash browns additional charge   Lunch Dinner  burgers sandwiches excellent wings side salads  Stay away chili really bad   The food bit pricey but continue but only burgers sandwiches wings since need good place those side town  <EOR> Told sit where ever wanted  Three places wanted sit hadn't bussed  Constant annoying Country music playing while big screen showing playoff game muted  Food let down took forever changed order GO! <EOR> Service terible  Hate see if busy  Waitress needs fired  Manager comped meal due incompetence  only bright spot food runner  Poor kid just imagine working guy  Hope don't need local repeats  Never again  <EOR> love staff food    always clean   love gamble    only thing dont smoke smoke always strong    needs air cleaner fans!! <EOR> The food excellent  son Big Bear Breakfast Lil Bear Breakfast  waitress Cassandra recommended Timbers Screwdriver loved it!!

Place busy food came little slow but bad  already made plans return next week  <EOR> Like food its usually consisitant but think new cook husband Mountain Nachos last night well usually he can't even finish    well portion really cut down!  enough chicken which $ upgrade never enough cheese so    really?  Whats cost chips??  worth price   But    that being said food service always good thats why still give 4 stars   smoking HATE!!!!!  If better non smoking resturant closer same $$ food we'd probably stop going  <EOR> I think Timbers much because reminds home   great food which really surprised me   When first walked thought Oh great   dark smokey weird people playing slot machines  then remember live Vegas now   tad expensive taste but quality food totally worth it   Plus regularly send coupons house helps cost   play video poker watch any sports game want   also great happy hours late night specials   Now hungry     <EOR> The place friendly comfortable   menu just changed   I'd several times liked but new menu added couple items looked good    They lot happy hour specials but sure hours stay same should check that   Very cool big chairs comfortable place sit talk over dinner  <EOR> About once month friend play bit video poker few drinks munchies   Food spinach dip chips okay nothing special   cold terms temperature service ambiance overpriced   think free drink play max bets which don't do   any rate having few times decided elsewhere  <EOR> This place pretty much need   Large bar TVs all around decent selection beer food   pretty much only place salad around parts   few places north vegas nellis member scumbagtopia  decided bump 4 stars   food decent worth try   since work all day long Nellis don't feel heading south meal     If wasn't baseball season would probably eat someplace else  Mexican o Thai  <EOR> This first time Timbers thought food pretty good bar food although little pricey no lunch specials  club sandwich w fries such huge entree couldn't finish all! waitresses nice attentive food drink refills flowed no issues  would return if far eastside again  <EOR> Very expensive bar  Food mediocre best  pool sticks all destroyed waitresses could care less  <EOR> If good smoke your meal place  Basic bar menu part chain  Clean busy but full smoke  come smelling ashtray  Definitely smokers paradise   If better ventilation system would rate them higher but just can't  <EOR> Great customer service food very satisfying  definitely couldn't finish burger nachos love ambience definitely relaxing chill  <EOR> Frequent patron group  service hit miss depending waitress  Erin best  she personable helpful prompt welcoming  Busy excellent customer service never falters  Most others encountered aloof did come check likely forgot unless hailed them down did come back sauces refills napkins promptly  Perfect place watch NFL NBA college games  Great prices delicious food overall! Wish dessert menu however  Ps  Order chicken nachos extra chicken cubed !
