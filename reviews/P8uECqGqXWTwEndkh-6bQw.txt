Actually Naked Chop aka chopped salad turkey greens carrot tomato onion avocado wan't bad    didn't blow away either   took awhile make!    I Misti Y came straight airport   must've worked quite appetite flying LA because pretty hungry when arrived    but felt salad  ordered   just wasn't most filling salad around   Hence note self above     I'd give place another shot suggest if you're hood but take advice order sandwich salad! <EOR> This place located Arville Desert Inn   The pizza made scratch down sausages meatballs quality great   We stopped yesterday  music loud but dive bar like mostly college crowd  window next bar where your order bring your table  quite wait but worth freshly prepared   We built own medium pizza choice toppings mozarella pepperoni mushroom bacon  only crunchy light airy but hearty  much leftover  didn't room Suicide fries Wings  Prices aren't bad   There numerous topping choices choose well some specialty pizzas  Don't misled location interior exterior decor  <EOR> Not gonna lie hesitant check place but sure am glad did!  When arrived three cop cars parked outside    at noon   just made dive bar look really sketch   But maybe all reluctance built appetite because ordered everything wings pie  served tray size cookie sheet fries beer tower   Needless say all good stuff left coming back more     The pizza full flavor craft cooked perfection   While pizza large doesn't fold over bc heavy toppings don't lose toppings dripping off your slice well   Such things matter try taste yourself! <EOR> So extremely excited try place but very disappointed  sign curb appeal weak could barely find place   When actual restaurant no store customers staff over 10 mins  call location phone number menu someone tell staff food next door bar different name other Naked City Pizza  When walked waitress only acknowledged person just called  sat table 20 minutes more without single hello  But table 5 next check boxes all while sitting there  point waitress made eye contact but didn't speak even smile  didn't goodbye when left either  bad didn't try food excited try  Maybe just try other location next time  Service location terrible! <EOR> After once again searching Yelp some higher reviewed places near where live found Naked City Pizza Shop     The pizza shop located inside Moon Doggies bar   even sectioned off Subway inside convenience store really just window wall   quite difficult find if you've never before  northeast corner Arville Desert Inn   bar itself seems bar seats 15 people small tables high chairs another 15   epitome dive bar but seems clean enough   Aside video poker bar there's golf arcade game hunting arcade game electronic dartboard those punching bag games   Smoking allowed everywhere if  make or break you   I came friend around 1 30 PM Tuesday obviously little traffic   guy running shop really nice attentive   Huge bonus points although some other reviews talk bad slow service your mileage may vary   decided try little bit everything planned taking quite bit home us   other reviewers note whether eat everything served styrofoam takeout containers   If eat some plates plastic cutlery though   We some single slices pepperoni pizza ham sub seasoned fries garlic buns suicide wings fried dough   Even single slice pizza huge tastes great good sauce great cheese superb dough   believe call Brooklyn style but all know great   pizza reminded Pizza Hut when kid   don't mean terms taste quality but always treat Pizza Hut kid   Nowadays find pizza quite bland perhaps because taste buds changed perhaps because ingredients changed    Anyway Naked City's pizza gives same feeling when kid   The ham sub lot ham lot cheese bun sub toasted but just something would stuff store    would imagine some heated subs using pizza ingredients better   fries great   Done perfectly even small $2 filled entire styrofoam container   garlic buns garlic bread cheese served marinara which Naked City calls 'red sauce' menu    Absolutely delicious bubbly browned cheese   wings themselves large but nothing special   suicide hot sauce quite messy but very hot   fried dough quite good covered chocolate sauce   pretty much everything else filled single styrofoam container but wasn't heavy far desserts go     The chef server really nice mentioned above service fairly fast   Even though ordered dessert along everything else he said he would bring while gotten rest food he even brought over pitcher soda wouldn't ask bunch refills   honest think quality service most places Vegas ranges average terrible but top notch   Overall bit torn   food great quality huge portions very cheap   location leaves lot desired though  feeling such good pizza sides almost wasted patrons bar when deserves restaurant its own   definitely diamond rough    probably own again takeout order delivery but pretty unlikely I'd take group friends family there  <EOR> I location because recommended bunch people say right really good  NY miss pizza fulfilled craving  more upstate NY style thin city style  great flavor lots toppings when ordered cheese stretching off each slice cheap toppings all  say girl Nicole works extremely friendly awesome pizza great customer service  <EOR> Hands down best pizza Las Vegas  place classic dive bar pizza joint  Food fantastic pizza off charts  eat site take out  smoke bar while eat which rarity days   As far pizza goes   try Guinea phenomenal! <EOR> Super sad don't sausage sandwiches anymore   awards them goodness sake!!!!! still sausages still sandwiches     what's Naked City????

While normally would subtract star typical bar feel pizza more made that    Had sausage pepperoni garlic crust couple other things  really awesome! Even small size could only eat half but took back ate rest dinner    Will come back again!! Unless find better pizza place area but unlikely <EOR> Groupon alert!  As Groupon addict always excited when offer place dying try    We decided order pizza takeout since feeling pretty lazy exhausting weekend doing nothing  decided Wee Royal Wee garlic fries  tempted Poutine but just big fan gravy cheese  ordered pizza well done side based some previous reviews pizza being under unevenly cooked    When pizza home excited take bite  didn't find any crust dough issues previous reviewers mentioned luckily happy that  adored texture  chewy really enjoyed sauce  added touch ricotto delightful added sweet flavor accompany savory  very happy pizza  fella other hand wasn't impressed  He stuck mainly garlic fries which much more garlicky would like  If only used real garlic instead garlic salt would've sold!  All all very happy meal here  feeling won't eating often unless friend  Hehe   I look forward trying more menu items sometime soon  <EOR> My favorite pizza Las Vegas  crust much flavor nice thick cut pepperoni  Wings fantastic fries great  Joes NY good great overpriced $5 slice  Metro pizza looks much better then tastes soggy crust  Tasted better when reheated toaster oven  Pizza Rock Good but again $5 slice hit miss but its good  Naked city thin crust ny pie  try its dive thats part appeal naked city  grew NY but dont think NY pizza NY good anymore   Try hooked its cheap compared other pizza LV <EOR> This hands down best pizza Las Vegas! never disappointed bar pizza kitchen works doesn't disappoint either  favorite location since enjoy few drinks great pizza  traditionalist just pepperoni pizza but all speciality pizzas awesome  appetizers incredible too! haven't able try all them but generally don't leave without garlic buns  Trust they're nothing you've before because they're much better  <EOR> This absolute favorite place eat vegas    Even despite being dive bar   poutine fries delicious   stinger pizza favorite!  thought put boneless wings steak hot sweet peppers pizza white sauce?  white sauce incredible!!!  Whoever invented pizza genius!  Thank you! <EOR> Overall Highly recommended One best pizza places far open late night apparently located inside bar! Definitely great hangout place   Parking Pretty spacious could limited during busy hours but inside bar might best rideshare over   Service Food brought your table self service water utensils napkins door  bar itself seemed fine people just hanging having good time   Food Suicide Fries fan this  spicy level pretty high would eat if more flavorful since enjoy tasty spicy food spicy just because  fries themselves okay  would definitely pass unless just feel something spicy  *2 stars*  Guinea Pie pleasantly surprised tastiness pizza  very skeptical when came square form  crust reminded thinner version now trendy pretzel bun  think garlic sauce really made pizza stand best pizza eaten thus far  *5 stars* <EOR>
