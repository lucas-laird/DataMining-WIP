Another time girlfriends dress missing locker paid 60 bucks which also outrageous locker   remember watching put locker never back locker once  told staff missing refused anything it   still come back because no other pool party compete EBC but sometimes start wonder if its worth dealing staff! <EOR> Great venue  Big fun  Cabanas really nice great service  Lily pad less expensive way go  <EOR> What MONEY MACHINE! Low end tables run $4 5k High end cabanas run anywhere $10 25k  A bit ridiculous must say  Drinks $20 50 depending get  small Fiji water bottle $12! Ouch Vegas!  I honestly don't all hype EBC  SUPER CROWDED Chainsmoker doesn't even come until 3 30 4pm 1 1 5 hour before day club closes  Eh pass    I actually USED think day clubs better night clubs but may rethink this    Day Club 1 HOTTTTTTT freaking HOT summer be warned  hydrate yourself  Heat + Alcohol bad combo careful! 2 much shade 3 Pool water dirty  4 female bathroom HUGE line prepare wait easily 15 minutes before your turn    Honestly Vegas used 3 4 years ago    P S  If locker $10 15 sure cover code set  gfs lockers broken into!!! hmp! <EOR> I wonderful time definitely place worth going electronic music point nice crowd great drinks  am really happy place <EOR> Summer time away Vegas? fence which day club choose from?

When over summer promoter walked in  No cover no wait  grabbed drinks bar settled down next pool partied afternoon away  DJ amazing some live performances well  whole club singing along music  Girls ware hella nasty creepers though  Highly suggest stick your girl friends    After beach club your energy completely drained  starving  good thing Wynn Buffet right next door! no better reward full buffet hours partying   Encore Beach definitely those clubs MUST if you're considering Vegas Trip  <EOR> We supposed see Kygo he didn't even come until 4 pm despite performance hours being 10 30 am 5 pm  Complete rip off totally crowded enough seating  worth price entry drinks  <EOR> Was Vegas first time last week 5 girlfriends EBC once but twice because couldn't enough! First time TJR 8 21 then Kaskade 8 22  TJR guest list free  line fast prob 15 min  stayed 3 hours only drink because plans later day didn't want drunk  nice setup pools beautiful multiple bars staff friendly  crowded TJR but crazy plenty room walk around hang pool comfortably  Saturday Kaskade whole other story  around 12 30 guest list  line already huge  waited line I'd say close two hours because reached max capacity weren't letting people inside unless people coming out  When finally made buy ticket because missed time frame free entry girls ended paying $30 each guys $125 holy shit   Even though totally bummed waited line 2 hours vegas heat totally worth it  Once your inside having much fun completely forget miserable line  honestly met lot cool people line least provided water coolers while your waiting  lot people brought beers them drinking while waiting which really smart  inside beach club insane while Kaskade playing  crowded everyone hype girl friends couldn't help but feed off energy  ended cabana bachelor party extremely lucky pay drinks  Drinks extremely expensive if afford highly recommend getting table cabana if your group girls being extra friendly meeting some guys bottles  Cabanas also nice because somewhere put your purse shoes cover up  Other wise locker take risk hide your stuff somewhere inside  ended staying until kicked when Kaskade  highlights trip!! Definitely recommend checking while your there <EOR> I never horrible experience  always chill place where catch DJ want see  couple times only complaint super long lines overcrowding bar area during holidays but its expected which only reason buy Pitcher    lol <EOR> Super long line waited over two hours ticket line did move don't know way making look exclusive but terrible experience back still hurts coming back ever <EOR> I literally just back day EBC am disgusted! David Guetta DJ arrived 130 only find everyone else  Vegas also guest list   eventually Guetta took stage amazing but lets honest    David Guetta does need Encore Beach Club Encore Beach Club needs David Guetta true story! obviously music amazing but music prepared pay $65 tall drink $25 small unless table  biggest issue over EBC      staff! apparently hire model wannabes forget house car paid because hospitality  industry  FYI years coming vegas yet meet someone says club venue because employees good looking Encore note self rid hole eye candy don't understand hospitality business hire staff want spend $65 drink because actually personality   thank David Guetta great time     <EOR> This place freaking nice  Friday June recieved comped entry because friend connected promoter  venue pretty huge well spaced out  blackjack tables bar gamblers volleyball net pool sport enthusiats  even hour open bar ladies which included mimosas Sky Vodka  bartenders pour free hand which made some pretty strong drinks! packed expected but also no special DJ spinning day  definitely would back if am ever Vegas summer  <EOR> Best pool party Vegas  impressed many ways  Surrender thought ok but daytime pool party Enocre Beach Club off hook!  I first attended pool party 4th July weekend last year appalled when asked pay cover  Moi girlfriend? Cover? complained but sucked forked over 30 dollars they charging guys 100 20 minutes later glad did!  Stripper poles water help potential slippage good pictures won't post Facebook  KASCADE spinning BEST! Everyone happy friendly killer body  Ladies wear your high heels your snazzy think gold metal rings shiny metallic colors bedazzed sequined bikini lengthen out  Don't worry cover few drinks take edge off social comparison if  more your speed    As note last time drive back OC only 1 drink  Even still best times club going life! music crowd good your natural high wait even legal Vegas? maybe even save some money drinks   A must visit during pool party season! Cough cover dance your bikini off well maybe keep while actually pool ! <EOR> Best high end pool party venue Vegas hands down  believe also largest pool strip  seen Afrojack Deadmau5 spin EBC always good time  best EDM DJ's world just Marquee Day Club if pool parties EDM place be  DJ's such Tiesto Avicii Deadmau5 Afrojack Steve Angello Calvin Harris Deniz Koyu     Entry I can't stress enough Buy presale tickets online! If know going beforehand just it  It'll save lots $$ 50% off would pay door  You'll save lots time waiting line well  time didn't buy online presale tix wait super long line day took forever  waiting over hour moving very much decided always if don't want wait Grease bouncers  greased Benjamin finally front where then pay full price which something $125 each  Ridiculous! If bought tix online would $60  bring backpack but can't bring any outside food drink inspect very thoroughly  cannot bring eye drops any medication  need check front then back if need it    Environment Unlike Marquee Day Club plenty space find area sit edge pool side planters  capacity EBC probably 3 times size Marquee Day Club seems much more relaxed  warned music very loud because speakers surrounding entire pool which actually quite impressive  think counted something 80 speakers surrounding pool all along walls  Because isn't really any place where music loud if need break noise you'll need leave pool bring ear plugs  Since pool large easily find place take quick dip side middle front DJ   area dance front DJ well    Food Drink Drinks ridiculously expensive which expected any Vegas club almost $20 per drink tax tip  However food actually pretty good costs much less alcohol! chicken sandwich wrap order every single time  also sell soda powerade water beer food window  line usually moves much faster line bar if just want beer soda water good place go    One complaint place    security very good but expected probably just temporary workers permanent  time drinking powerade head security lady came told wasn't allowed bring outside food drink told throw away  imagine very confused since paid $5 food window! argue little while she still doesn't believe then friends come back tell really bought food window along beer water etc  Obviously she did know drinks actually sold food window she finally gave believed us    EBC sets standard all other pool parties Vegas should which why gave 5 stars  People give four stars just complaining service price drinks but wtf expect? where else better pool party Vegas? Marquee only other pool party compares because all popular DJ's all really hot model girls there  But Marquee way smaller super cramped crowded drinks cost just much  <EOR> My friend purchased cabana things fine until power hungry security guard decided ruin day  He came asked friends lift sunglasses then said You're Out  asked explanation said private property did need disclose anything us  friend coherent civil  Even servers agreed told pay any gratuity  even spoke head security sided asshole    Aside personal experience water warm which pretty gross  Marquee day club's water cooler  I'd recommend going unless you're dying see DJ Encore  <EOR> I see David Guetta some friends   He didn't come until 3pm since 11am   place great party crowd bit more upscale then if Drais beach club  Everyone encountered friendly fun drinks pricey but  Vegas general  bartenders look came magazine girls great shape bikini clad gorgeous  Tons vip areas money being thrown pool  see lot beautiful physically attractive people    Only complaint bathroom attendants bit rude using products  needed face because running due champagne being thrown crowd  dancing David Guetta DJing friend gave tip but she still came tip her  told tipped she made bothered face   While used face wash she kept saying only use little bit then when dried face paper towels she said very expensive don't need use more one  Such greedy lady  Other blast would again <EOR> This place horrible  bag check worse TSA  never anyone check little bag bad them   took tic tacs perfume  vip line took long just in  much money spent table should much hassle  never come back <EOR> It's common bathroom practice two girls into stall together  Stupid some but hey happens  Two friends mine stall together plain sight bathroom attendant said nothing regarding rules sharing stalls  Within 10 seconds different female employee barges bangs door damn DEA  girls surprised tell person behind door wait  woman continues bang door no indication she actually staff member  friends opens door immediately dragged mocked embarrassed screamed at  girls profusely apologized opening door faster pleaded employee ensured simply peeing together  escorted half naked bathing suits no opportunity clothes shoes bags each chipped over $200 special night out   I incredible time while lasted which why would feel disingenuous dock them further but never felt such contempt disgust employee well regarded establishment  truly seems take pleasure tossing patrons simply because ability acting solely under own assumptions  disturbing say least  <EOR> You guys never come line long!!!! paid $175 put guess line 3 hours!!!!!! If paid $250 staff told 1 1 2 hours waiting wowwwww shock casino pool party whatever never come back again life       I love wet republic if paid $100 no line super fast more fun!!!!!       I'm serios take look pictures place encore $175!!! Line!!! Omg  waiting 3 hours!!!  At 2pm pictures <EOR> EBC anti fun  No splashing?!?! Cmonnnnnnnn now! <EOR> Encore Beach Club brought sexy back Vegas  upscale pool definitely place worth checking if into pool parties  HOWEVER if more fist pumpin drunkaholic dance fever type pool partier would say place isn't going your #1 spot  music good   not GREAT  But then again wkd when Kaskade no show  go figures  give them benefit doubt just assume Kaskade would spin better music whoever did day went   KNOW PROMOTER  just all clubs general  but especially Beach Club cover because its going cost $30 ladies $50 fellahs  venue very spacious room walk around hop bar bar cabana cabana    By far helluva place spend day Vegas but if more crazy party breed   prepare life party  seriously haha D FISTPUMPPP!! <EOR> Besides staff being dicks high prices admission  it pretty fun  Personally think Drai's better  <EOR> Encore Beach club favorite pool party club Vegas  pretty expensive but then again everything expensive Vegas  The ambience really fun energetic  people friendly probably because they're all drunk rolling   DJ setup great   If your first time Vegas should here  Also careful because ground slippery once fell landed back pretty hard but thats ok because drunk couldn't feel much back started partying again  All all good time  <EOR> Ahh spot every year when Vegas  If you're coming Vegas party PLACE GO!!  Great music lovely crowd great staff! bartenders always smiling very quick drinks  lifeguards always watch making sure no does anything stupid don't worry overly obnoxious people pool  Oh very good looking staff also everyone hired because looks specially lifeguard Alana     The music always great appearances top DJs depending buy tickets see   more need? Great music good company great drinks!  Tips ready spend pretty penny drinks  They're cheap  tickets beforehand  tend sell 50 dollar ticket turn into 80 dollar ticket  Try night time beach club once twice crowded but still great music fun people  Try locker  lose your sandals bro  Party hard  <EOR> EBC always crackin'! prefer day club over Marquee because open space walk great DJ's everyone friendly! would recommend coming always great time pool! <EOR> Came cocktail city 1030 tickets 2 free drinks  Security sent 3 different lines  Didn't till 1230 due them knowing line cocktail city  Once security tells show stamp bar drinks  Bar tells back front  front tells bungalow 2  Bungalow 2 tells past 12 refuse honor 2 drinks     place also ghetto inside  Would waste your time coming especially if through cocktail city  <EOR> YAY! am definitely fan!   Admittedly am coolest person earth especially when comes knowing right people club party scene and or regarding what's hot Vegas  would ask friends kind covert info   But thanks those friends special connections living Encore Beach Club 2 bed booths pool cabana needless say blast!   The Encore Beach Club XS Nightclub both Encore Hotel Casino day party other night party  reviewing latter next  overall hotel quite impressive luxurious everywhere look eye candy galore   expected Vegas but some places ratio easy eyes viewing much greater others    For example Encore Hotel versus Circus Circus  Ha ha wait place still around? Actually more fitting comparison would Wet Republic versus Encore Beach Club  Wet Republic gorgeous people everywhere but most sober people past Sunday I'd say Encore Beach Club Monday 3 4 times amount amazing sights behold Wet Republic    Beauty eye beholder am just calling saw it  Plus opinion based solely upon female population both day pool parties  much enjoy watching Jersey Shore gorillas steroid enthusiasts full body tats don't anything me neither guys more alcohol and or drugs flowing through veins actual red blood cells  each own right Babe?  Sorry being harsh especially since Vegas intention mean but said earlier most sober people guess what? still spectacular time!!! All need music little bit foot room am happy be!   The Encore Beach Club awesome! Since 3 reserved areas group 24 people didn't wait gnarly long line  fact pulled off some side artificial grassy area where carded stamped  Next led into reserved area started bringing out non stop bottle service    Again mentioned earlier am truly cool but celebrating sister's birthday during Memorial Day Weekend Vegas BIG Home!   The guest deejay DeadMau5 he definitely lived hype  music fantabulous think danced least 90% time which when looking back explains why feet sore when left  arrived around 10 30 11am left just 7pm  lot fun Wet Republic day before but Encore Beach Club hands down BEST day pool party ever!  My reviews become quite mini editorials note think funny those neither shirtless nor thonged stood out crowd swarming au naturel or not bodies barely bikinis  yes plenty guys sporting barely bikini bottoms thought could away them   No complaints but eyes overstimulated some point became numb sea nakedness  fact think only handful people stood out day because couldn't see derrieres washboard abs glorious bosoms    You gotta love Vegas! <EOR> Stay sober day pool  Notice grey film nastiness floating water   People puke pee wash off pool  People sex well   sunblock come off water   Just gross   If u watch DJ's stay hydrated put your stuff lockers don't bring anything  Just don't touch water  <EOR> Kaskade Sundays    AAAAAMAZING!!!  don't know else would describe place!  danced 5 hours straight 110 degrees weather did want leave when over !

All beverages must consumed before entering even water bottles just provided    We day bed along pool bottle service glad did  kid 1000 more people height festivities  If didn't bed leave stuff escape heat times probably would made it   waitress very attentive    DJ Snake performed AMAZING set  danced entire set loved every minute it    We forewarned bring many valuables people sometime take things  experienced firsthand  each matching old navy flip flops initials rhinestones part bachelorette swag bag  all wore flip flops Encore then when time noticed 2 pairs missing  couple walked around party search them sure enough found them one pair halfway across party another pair some random girl's hand   Why anyone would want steal Old Navy flip flops beyond me    Regardless fantastic experience would definitely come back!!! <EOR> My group 14 worst experience here  staff kept threatening kick various people group most absurd reasons  threatened kick friends putting sunscreen  No joke  Another friend threatened when she told bartender much sweet sour drink  Then when front DJ area dancing security asked step aside VIP person could take place  WTF  Then complained manager said boyfriend could backstage  Once he left another security person threatened kick very aggressively because he said couldn't back there  staff insanely rude  yourself favor another pool party  Wet Republic Liquid Drais Marquee  All million times better place  Marquee best opinion  <EOR> Meh   I don't know big hoopla place maybe wrong weekend July 4th weekend but didn't think all great  Definitely guestlist avoid lines sorry guys pay $40! Dayam! least girls guestlist free   They super strict bring into area search every nook cranny your bag  made friends trash bottled water snacks Visine any type medication even allergy heartburn meds They say lot drug use which believe     Pretty crowded no room 7 girls put down towels  Some purses completely drenched because lay bags pool  Cabanas start $3000 heard pay lily pads sit well   The pools shallow kiddie pools something swim but nice just sit pool some sun  Decent atmosphere decent music but probably won't come back again  I'd rather hotel pool somewhere lay put down things without paying arm leg  <EOR> What God's green Earth people think okay pool party when your gut sticks farther your tits pecs?!  call stick    Geez aren't self conscious jiggle?  Vegas pool parties you're surrounded hottest bodies but then handful nastiness eyeballs bleed   then nasty bitches want pole can't even dance   Backf fat jiggling all   Eww   don't super fit skinny but least don't pole thinking you're sexy   Don't even started hairy dudes   Wax shit!  *end rant*  Anyways EBC good   Great music   Food drinks yummy   table $1000 food beverage minimum   bad all   waitress super hot friendly   Usually hotter more unfriendly are   but girl   75% good looking people great eye candy but 25% fatties guys girls    Security super friendly too   Michael Phelps made appearance looking stoned dolphin   The food good especially steak nachos sea salt fries   wanted eat more but trying keep salt off abs   don't want stick    bottles but also ordered strawberry daquiries delicious   I docked star because door goons being shiesty   trying some extra bucks pockets   when said no thanks threatened pull guys line hold them back line   Wack!  Tip day Walk carefully wet cement   saw least 3 chicks eat shit   Ouch!!  embarassing!! <EOR> Best pool ever! enjoy Vegas but fan clubs found Encore Beach Club surprisingly good compromise clubbing twist  many things visit made fall love place count days until next visit   Their service spectacular! sat gambling tables between bar pool nicest sweetest waitress Shelly wait hand foot  wasn't sure order she gave several delicious suggestions made time tables more enjoyable   Two favorite things Vegas gambling enjoying warm summer evenings since don't those San Diego  But Encore don't choose between two since gambling tables Beach Club able enjoy warm weather under stars gamble when hot dip pool 10 feet away    The pool pool pool  Wow! Magnificent! Wonderful! plenty nice cabanas surrounding pool but since evening no need cabana thank goodness don't moonburn ha ha  awesome comfy lounges lily pads pool all along sides reserve bottle service  area favorite because seats pool table slightly raised simply fantastic   The pool slightly heated hottub but just its comfortable cold  made feel warm bathwater never wanted leave  fact just giant bathtub all favorite toys play with  ton fun toys floaties tubes etc  There's nothing grown pool party when all ladies wearing floaties around arms tummy  also stripper pole middle pool ladies only stripper pole dresscode bathsuits bikini's required   And just case worried being many people 3 different pools countless cabanas very spacious!!!   The music fantastic DJ played best songs danced swam all night long  showed around mid night partied until 4am  never pool long wrinkly days     Overall best experiences Vegas  many needs being met same time location  don't know why anyone would leave place  <EOR> This probably best place Vegas pool Party definitely come back again! <EOR> Apparently only first 300 people guestlist quickly and free   noon which hour late avoid madness  girls followed guest list line down stairs really far away  100 degrees forced wait outside hours  line did move all  Luckily hour moving decided try Vegas way   some extra cash  Thank god worked  Otherwise would another hour longer wait long outdoor line  saw girl sick because heat  recommend buying presale tickets getting table  guys group bought tickets online only wait 20 minutes inside AC  all drinks admission spent well over would bottle  should gotten one! Don't us  If drinks $20 each admission cost bunch try math figure what's smart  Other always blast here  Totally worth money  more fun any night club Vegas!  Major thanks staff Encore returning boyfriend's lost ID credit card  Esp since right before flight! <EOR> I normally atmosphere Encore however if ever service waitress named Jannie would recommend requesting different service waitress   attitude great much if hate your job shouldn't working there   she would harassed etc but great crew she just crappy attitude beginning service bad   guy bringing ice should gotten 100% tip he awesome   Other waitress great cabana  <EOR> This place joke  Let's start paying expedited entry then waiting hour half entrance  There's nothing expedited that    We bought tickets DJ Snake 5 26 once entrance found he cancelled  Highly disappointing he highlights trip   Encore should embarrassed  <EOR> Went 108 degree F day hated life while line  When waiting group very beginning line hotel told wait slot machines  Hmmm  Ok  Also most thorough bag search ever experienced  Some group didn't because prescription meds couldn't toss  Another person sunscreen tossed  Wtf? toss sunscreen?! need LIVE   Once inside however fun  pool water warm given temperature all bodies but delightful  hard find place perch put your stuff but since large group some people didn't want water lucked ditch stuff  Also some people group bought food eat chicken strips fries which DELISH overpriced considering  cans stella $12 each served swiftly friendly bartender nice too  <EOR> This probably favorite pool party come every time come Vegas  Its probably biggest too  Beware always full people buy your tickets before hand arrive early secure your entrance  just table cabana One things love most fact don't allow splashing! know its pool party but don't enjoy being splashed face idiots    This place always coolest DJs too  chance see Skrillex Zedd  Some other resident DJs include Diplo Avicii Michael Angello Martin Garrix just name few    I opportunity experience VIP such amazing experience  Yeah crazy expensive but service experience truly kind  <EOR> this place much better marquee day club say cause its bigger much more room pool bigger  i lot fun but alchie expensive but its vegas!   got 60 bucks dangggggg really dance drink but its vegas ok! still gave 4 star  however careful cause pool bigger more interseting cause beds pool side kicking then fall into pool but leg hits shallow end straight chuck flesh came off haha drunk feel pain but just careful  i still good surrender night same place! <EOR> Oh goodness damn good time   music awesome pool perfect   way into club scene all but love some daytime party time   check your stuff $10 don't worry getting stolen but line long moves quick though    Drinks expensive but plenty large bars available well small little kiosk type deals   so even if Avicii supposed show place packed don't wait long drink  Sadly Avicii never came replacement DJ lame Piece advice though if you're lady dancing platform thing whilst very drunk stop   If you're sober   ish it   If you're dude don't even try hauled off bouncers lifeguards  <EOR> I would rate less 1 star if could  promoters put theirs hands because feel entitled too  Avoid place all cost  dont care customer service  All care money  <EOR> Pre game sure unless down spend $19 piece small sized drink unless bottle service    This place ton fun! supposed see Diplo but he didn't show    I bought tickets Encore website Club 15 minutes before opened Friday 10 45 first line  stayed hotel easy just going downstairs    There isn't any lounge chairs which bummer  Even if bottle service reserved area wasn't much room sit down but mean you're pool most time suppose don't need sit down much anyway    Overall would definitely back drink lots alcohol before going! <EOR> Dumb club  take your shit don't give back when you're leaving  worth it  Hot balls  Money down drain free  Horrible experience <EOR> Probably best pool party Vegas Wet Rehab pool parties say best party especially Saturday morning   two ways enter pool party through hotel itself other walking stairs Vegas strip sign says Encore Beach Party outside just follow steps   Side Note stayed Encore Hotel thought would some kind discount but don't but privileges showing your room key when purchase your tickets special colored wrist band shows your hotel guest   3 fairly sized decent pools crowd young Saturday mornings compared other days music House almost 95% time bar area amazing place really clean everybody just drinking dancing pool pool   this place just Vegas must summer time! <EOR> Best pool party Vegas hands down  Back day Rehab spot now to  Great crowd great Dj's  <EOR> We last night see Kygo during night swim amazing!! place absolutely beautiful  water super warm although very chlorinated I'd still no deeper ankle deep bc when there's crowd drunk people weirded sharing same water      They also daybeds second floor area where those chose drop kind cash could gaze loftily dancing peasant monkeys below    There stripper pole two well next few other collections wicker couches  weren't any professional dancers night but people fun dancing poles themselves taking silly pictures   They food runs $16 18 per item consisted mostly greasy fried food  chicken fingers waffle fries but greasy ended throwing half away    Cups tap water $5 each but water fountains next bathrooms refill them at  also sell bottles Fiji water barely size your fist $12    I would definitely bottle service if wore cute bathing suit but found hard time showing off bc no place put dress shoes   The cocktail waitresses all 10s wear super cute bikinis cheeky bottoms heels  <EOR> Word advice If see girl whispering Hey come over gestering come hither trust them  might just give access free day bed drinks most all good company  Vegas baby everyone your friend  If no kind stranger approaches no worries  Promoters want people guestlist! during day night easily connected guestlist easier girls guys but guys still good deal   Otherwise $20 girls $30 guys    Came lazy Sunday slightly windy but still very sunny  Came early free mimosas pretty empty then picked later on  During night beach club Surrender DJ dance area space  BEAUTIFUL pool sparking cleanness lots classy day beds cabanas  staff SUPER nice  attentive  Maybe little much  kept arranging shoes  Haha nonetheless very nice especially bartender Dave saved sobriety  Big shout because he took open bar mimosas seriously very generous champagne    Other drinks  kind Samaritans pitcher Raspberry Lemonade Mojito  Both DELISH but obvious favorite Raspberry Lemonade  bought them pitcher which pretty pricey $85 but good time new friends priceless!  It might good idea table day bed cabana because lot people just leave things planters which isn't ideal opinion  Kinda pricey think girls dropped around $700 but just talk promoter  Day beds awesome     Pool  Music  Drinks  Sun  happy girl  Backstroking across pool listening music through water looking sky  Perfection  <EOR> I say few Vegas pool parties place Saturday crowded!  smart buy tickets way ahead time line on want tickets  com before 12 noon because line guest list pay  the day freakin mile long expect 2 hours line wait in   Pre pay waited line we 12 20 Saturday waited 45 mins line bad   just hubby BTW  <EOR> Every time come without table lilypad cabana good time  drinks great music great it's EDM people work super nice even more attractive look hi Evan Emmanuel Giuseppe!   yourself guestlist bring enough girls free and maybe even flirt lil hooked table   u check big bags keep mind don't bring your entire makeup collection you  lockers free believe smaller items may wanna put away  Towels provided  few gambling tables too  Tables lilypads run u few bills but expect drop least grand cabanas  Personally tables lilypads more bc they're right center action  Love place! <EOR> Visited place 4th July weekend   Played safe buying pre sale tickets through website   price skyrocketed day on   Great security   Dress code p  You check your things door $5   I've only handful pool parties Vegas Tao beach Moorea Beach Wet Republic probably biggest most beautiful them all   3 huge pools surrounded daybeds cabanas   mention few shower poles   Bar grill located site well place where could play blackjack craps   Huge DJ booth dancefloor front if want your dance on   You gotta pay everything truly enjoy yourself here   If want relax pool must pay cabana daybed lily pad   If want sit free gotta sit pool come early enought find concrete seat surrounding palm trees   No complimentary lawn chairs available some other pool parites   saw few girls trying lay towels pool but asked move because wasn't allowed Bought few drinks bar disappointed couldn't provide ice water cup   you buy $7 bottle water      Not sure if objective place people lounge around sit pool entire time   If DJ wanted people live dance he should've hint switching music playing something most people familiar the only time saw people excited dance when he played Ne Yo's Give Everything but rest time DJ kept playing same boring electro beat    All all glad came experience pool party   wouldn't definitely recommend place come back  <EOR> It cool  lot fun! place amazing would totally back  But only problem bought two big cups cranberry vodka whisky sour charged $130 am never doing again totally am pregaming hard afff next time  They're supposed 35 dollars idk happened    <EOR> My group 11 girls lily pad day  Service Dylan excellent well waitress  12 great time don't remember much  say Kaskade never showed still annoyed paid tickets but really werent hear drink  <EOR> So everything fine until came time bill  asked 5pm  Everything finalized 6 10pm  split bill between two rooms difficult could be?

Excellent service chicken tenders bomb expecially few drinks  <EOR> There's bunch red tape getting into Encore Beach Club  If aren't anyone's list probably should just head elsewhere unless you're cool super long wait  If list easily best night pool Vegas  You're welcome  <EOR> Very nice though pool could larger  always packed  night its outdoor area Surrender nighttime pool parties same way XS does  However due smaller pool area fun  inside area rather small better hope DJ playing inside everyone wants see them because dancefloor very tiny  Drinks expensive course but Vegas expect! <EOR> Why don't 5 stars me     arrived crutches told stand inline table add on     waiting good 15 mins told where table in back top floor   Knowing cabana started 1 figured he first he second but hey know    just hoping along!

Also pleasure meeting most awesome hosts promoters all Vegas   Richie P  hilarious fun definitely made day awesome!!!    Can't wait come back Encore Beach Club chill shade!!! <EOR> Fun time but God control pool people smoking it  many cigarette butts junk water beyond disgusting  want vomit when see group smoking flicking ashes into water then but cigarettes putting them under water swim in    Someone said price sunscreen $40 which gouging   Bottles beer $12 ready sticker shock  Good acts David Guetta day there  crowd really into kicking water  Zedd performing next day    Good varied crowd  douche factor wasn't bad actually    $75 cover Saturday which fight night  Girls $45  There's list but takes long group just paid around it  <EOR> They all crazy new offputting rules Donde esta craps table?!?!

If you're staying resort exiting beach club even if cabana ushered down escalator separate taxi line second class citizens  Never liked place much begin with   Water warm people mess dance floor WAY small   Music good  <EOR> My very first pool party day club vegas AMAAAAZING!!!  I definitely see why say best pool clubs now   First all girls free before 12am  heard its only first 300 girls free guest list  highly suggest getting being line 10AM!!! Line gets super long super fast  Guys BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE AHEAD TIME!! Lockers $25 then extra $5 every time want something which crazy ridiculous  but whatever its vegas right? best bring least possible unless table cabana   Cocktail pitchers $99 !!!! more expecting but tasted good great pictures  strawberry lemonade cocktail  poured into cups enough 4 5 drinks   The water felt great end stay could still see feet water im glad didn't disgusting   I honestly say its much easier crowd pool then crowd club  There's always somewhere sit stand  everyone view stage dj   Overall blast here  Definitely would come back again  <EOR> Can say enough good things place  saw Steve Angello funnest part whole vacation! If looking impressive pool party spot   Only advice Dont bring beach bag  made check bag charged $10 so  Rip off  <EOR> We've twice now  First time definitely better then past time  did vip both times skip huge line  Some girl hit head side pool closed down 45 minutes  Drinks expensive but isn't expected  Its vegas  Nothing cheap here  Id probably check encore again  <EOR> Seriously time life here!  All DJs point wait staff catered everything could desired   My advice book directly through venue pay little more avoid hit or miss drama comes Host Promoter   Andre host arrived 12 30p   gf friends waiting 10 30a line even though reserved couch   Unresponsive via text   Cmon bro know just tryna hustle n grind but let's least show work time   If please tell your clients time plan show don't stand line 2 hours   They even grease $200    LOL   Fortunately Door staff thanks Saleena being friendly face Armando delivering hangry Gf food Bag Check staff Security Wait staff David Guetta all 5 stars   ended having blast   Lesson Book direct thru venue   Hosts Promoters hit miss did decent deal couch but sad thing we'd gladly upped spend $600 more if we'd told arrive same time host decided roll into office  <EOR> I came when David Guetta Dj guest AMAZING!! such fun time! pool large pretty cool layout! staff very good keeping everything neat even when pretty crowded  Didn't think day club would much fun!

Our promoter Anthony Khotsikian excellent  He came table sure everything okay  Table service definitely worth money put down    This now #1 spot day clubbing  can't stress enough great place is! <EOR> I disgusted service  If could give place zero stars would  Expect check your bag $20 sure check anything importance cause stolen wet  bar casino area open but bar tender didn't even give time day  waited hour BAR    line but right bar hour no drink! decided leave bar tender kept making drinks but serving us    think deserved least acknowledgment existed! He couldve told anyone standing brief explanation why he wasnt serving anyone  There's only two bars beach club expect least 20 min drink  order two   Next    Someone threw pool    yeah   people swimming it  dealers table? Yeah   friendly all  look miserable  think asking them smile would crack face  <EOR> Security beyond horendous took belonings because said its allowed in  Priscription cbd oil Tom Ford roller perfume   Why?

Until then Encore Beach Club!!! <EOR> Came last night Vegas turn around  pool party night which pretty fun  Drinks course way over priced but Vegas club expected  Music great people nice would come again  <EOR> Look once bad except single drink may cost more any other bad experience you've ever had  But better pray god when you're waiting line never use restroom because you'll talk 20 people back line  You'll also probably need written approval line because extremely possible wait 2 hours before being told back line because some employee told group girls cut everybody when can't  security put much BS but when everyone's treated scumbag line try charge double entrance advertised easy upset  never back there's plenty other pool parties Vegas where isn't problem  <EOR> Paid over $75 ticket stand over two hour line Kaskade  Rude staff entire duration way over priced drinks  Honestly never coming again  <EOR> I came today couple friends  guest list  club opens 11 around 11 20 already pretty long line down stairs wrapped around  took 40 minutes in    I appreciated various water stations fans ample shade while waiting incredibly hot  would recommend getting even earlier least busy days Saturdays   If cigarettes vapes pain pills gum etc  don't bring them  saw lot getting confiscated entrance security  search your bags pockets    Once you're pretty packed  There's rental lockers if need put away your things but most people seemed bring things near pool  would just sure stay nearby keep eye it  There's umbrellas some shade but need stand  Only those rent cabanas sit couches  also some areas pool where sit but pretty packed   The energy vibe pretty fun everyone laughing having good time  music top 40 EDM remixes    I would probably come back especially since free parking  can't really comment prices since didn't spend any money but assume pricey  If you're girl definitely guest list free admission! <EOR> I would thank encore beach having best day pool party   free drank free then passed pool  <EOR> This day club to! must summer vegas trip It's very spacious beautiful  Good spots if buy bottle service but you'll lots room dance around hear music even if don't splurge  water looks clear blue unlike drais where green cloudy  Water probably still clean but looks gorgeous  pool very big plenty bars alcohol  usually free drinks girls if weekday  Otherwise drinks definitely pricy  But  Vegas ya!! <EOR> I've only once much fun! venue definitely exceeded expectations beach club should look like  weather perfect decorations beautiful Diplo definitely hyped up! pool itself huge especially loved twerk island hahaha! line long but did pretty late  girl friends guest list free  Unfortunately guy friends pay $100  felt really bad them but expect guy Vegas  stuff checked forgot much $20 $30?

Guys unfortunately pay I think most time much $100 per person   Might good idea cabana?  course given drink prices quite steep but Vegas afterall   bright side pours pretty heavy best bang buck       To answer some simple questions heard Yes pool party but people don't swim here   3 5 feet water something   usually super packed   drink dance flirt    premise  Looking chill place just bask sun pool?  No your place   bask cabanas but day club loud music maybe even some foam   place relax take nap  Lastly yes should still look cute here   ain't your neighborhood pool   Dress nines people!

D Anyways    So Chasing Summers last weekend because better way visit Encore Beach Club see Tiesto perform?!   Surrender nightclub night Encore Beach Club day what's love summertime Vegas? Good party spot good people most definitely good music those places need party when you're here    The club itself quite large HUGE pool full half naked people boozing schmoozing having good time  party doesn't really started till around 3PM but even before pretty packed  Want drink bar? Better comfortable because you're going waiting pretty long time    My main complaint getting drink bar pain ass since just way many people enough bartenders around  ended double fisting because didn't want keep going back bar more drinks  least drinks strong   really strong  Heh   And really where lockers? no places drop stuff off ended having wallets tickets credit cards IDs not stuffed purse because only person brought one  Luckily some people nice enough let put clothes under cabana   But besides those buzzkills great time partying here  plenty room around pool stand dance sit music just blasting bass down low  Tiesto awesome expected although wished he played some older hits  But  different story    If really want your daytime special then good place visit  If you're looking quiet relaxing place tan pool then place  People party all day everyday then all again night time! <EOR> Encore Beach Club first day club experience Vegas blast! Before heading club thought would feeling rather self conscious body since never attended club bikini wear before but instantly loose feeling when there  combination Vegas heat seeing people all shapes sizes stop caring  dress code obviously swimwear piece two piece etc girls allowed wear cute coverups shorts your bikini    Don't forget your sunscreen even though girls bathroom comes stocked sunscreen lotions perfumes use if tip! never seen any bathroom likes ones Vegas clubs before  mini makeup counters where freshen products laid counter price  wonder if men's bathroom same way?   Also buy yourself waterproof cell phone cover Amazon if want bring your phone pool take pictures  Those things quite useful even serve your wallet keep credit cards ID cash  Ladies Dudes don't brings purses wallets day club unless your own private cabana Even though friends couch small basket tables ourselves day club still didn't feel safe leave items opening when wanted dance pool  ended stashing them under basket tables hoping won't jacked    Ladies sure contact promotor see if free couch day bed drinks when head Encore  Freebies always fun no body wants pay thousands table anyways    The music Encore Beach Club mainly EDM great  friends bit disappointed when heard Avicii canceled event Saturday going but still fun jamming dancing pool substitute Marshmello  Overall Encore Beach Club fun should definitely come experience Encore Beach Club if never did before  <EOR> Went Encore Beach Club Sunday afternoon    There huuuge line people waiting in  luckily guest list!

He even taking pics mosh pit    Note ladies gents prepping club all bags searched many items could confiscated take any food including quest bars candies etc  any pills IBprophin don't let bring selfie sticks but u them hold your selfie stick $35    Aka don't bother bringing it  <EOR> My friend managed onto guest list through promoter group 5 girls 3 guys free no problems   Other loud club music there's much difference between beach club regular hotel pool  Except actually lounge chairs place your stuff sit while beach club only if buy table bottle service which dumb imo   If choose I'd pick plastic lounge chair + book + personal iPod over loud club music + lounge couches + stripper poles middle pool dance on   Tables start off $300 reaching $1800 cabana which club suggested since 8 people   $1800 cabana LOL look we're made money??  don't even think stayed more two hours!  nice experience but wouldn't back unless friend of friend table  <EOR> We enjoyed first day LDW 2011 pool  previously only seen club night pretty amazing!! love red theme hotel carries throughout entire resort   It modern vibe definitely nicest larger pool complexes Las Vegas  didn't bed cabana during large events extremely frustrating  really nowhere put your belongings sit down other pool  Someone needs watching your stuff all times always crowds drunk people walking around pool  exactly carefree partying mind   We didn't wait line list but if aren't getting bed cabana which require early seemed pretty easy 1pm right in  sure if simple both men women  Sorry guys usually pay always harder unless know someone   The music  DJ Steve Angello during LDW incredible but recall being good night club too  only drawback enough bar tenders during peak hours  several occasions battlefield bar wait least 20 mins more  Talk buzz kill  recall bars west side pool faster less crowded but knows if  norm   The only saving grace while waiting bar people watching  amazing see some people thinking no really paying attention them  sure whether pathetic funny    Another kind irritating thing don't think ever saw server come group entire time  Can't blame them if working private cabana bed but should still some roaming servers  did some free Heineken beers  must sponsoring event day   Beware does extremely crowded  Which good thing bad thing depending look it  Definitely save your pennies because drinks super super expensive!!! Expect pay $16 cocktails $10 beers  Vegas  normal most nicer pools  draw line $15 dollars shot premium liquor  joke!  Would another party Encore sure if cabana but much prefer service scene Encore Euro pool late afternoon   music just upbeat far fewer drunken musclebound bimbo idiots parading around pool hot sh*t!  Good times sure!! <EOR> Have pool party Vegas? No? Thinking going one? Yea?  Go EBC it'll change way think partying Vegas anywhere  say?  cabana right entrance spent bomb worth it  Regardless beautiful club BIG spacious all hear amazing music all see beautiful people    So grab drink people watch dance somebody enjoy sun take dip pool repeat process all day long   And yea EBC always brings best DJ's world saw Pete Tong he spun epic set   Price wise going cheap  it's Vegas  If afford daybed cabana then else just hanging just fun! <EOR> Aside slow service $20 drinks place amazing clean fun totally worth full day! Note performers come 3 30 don't come 11 plan being drinking all day unless lots $$$$ <EOR> Amazing!!! Best pool party Vegas  Sound awesome no matter where are  Only negative much pain a$$ even if reservation  <EOR> Things changed better   I've coming since day place opened many years ago  used recommend place all friends whenever they're town  day cup nightclub used coolest thing  Recently some friends town wanted party day clubbing   Sadly whole experience very mediocre  gotten most expensive bungalows could comfortable drinks food some privacy  arrived little late bouncers front entrance still gave some hassle    The whole place completely packed brim hard time trying dodge people order bungalow  pool water looks really disgusting very cloudy full drunk people  course no fault club's  servers very nice addition being pretty hot  cleaning crew sweeping floor things dropped but never came clean bathroom time bathroom really disgusting  did rather large cabinet safe bungalow lock wallets phones etc  outside patio area shaded nice cushy seats hang out  own small private pool shared bungalow next us   The music great! However friends kicked smoking vapor yet club allows cigarettes which way more disgusting  couple hours decided leave  made mistake leaving hotel key room since friends back room  Because wouldn't let back into building  walk mile all around perimeter hotel outside 120 heat enter through lobby then walk all through casino room    Honestly such hassle party really worth it! Especially when costs arm leg  <EOR> I've twice brilliant time both occasions! would recommend day bed! Great venue great music great weather great staff! best day party Vegas! <EOR> My favorite place club  atmosphere awesome  tried replicated other places strip but nothing place  would back over over   encore beach club EARLY in  otherwise end paying lots money into club  <EOR> It beautiful place but am crazy paying $50 drink damn also pricy too   having 2 4 drink run over $100 EZ    <EOR> My first time being beach club no idea expect   bf first line because wanted sure place sit I anticipated place would super packed locker store essential personal items     Things note    1 Renting locker cost $75   Alesso dj day prices must've jacked up   Needless say worth money because once place gets packed hundreds people tough find your things having place store your wallet cellphone change clothes other items worth peace mind    2 Even though does say prohibited list items   bring sunblock lotion   confiscate it   allowed sprays though   Additionally if forget bring yours confiscated   always buy some towel window bathroom use items just sure tip person 1 2 dollars    3 expected drinks food super expensive   You're allowed bring anything no re entry once you're if you're going hanging around pool hours bound hungry   hamburger chicken fingers gatorade   Total cost $55    entry buffet?!?  Drinks other hand   $65   What?!? most expensive alcohol SKYY Vodka   Good them really making money!  Although bit heavy handed drinks   personally cannot drink alcohol if taste tasted drinking gasoline but everyone else around seemed enjoy it  4 Seating   would highly recommend getting table cabana shade if big group   cheapest table $1 5K but includes alcohol   if divide amongst 10 compared cost drinks   might worth money   Plus set place keep your stuff    If came just couple $1 5K just ridiculous price pay two people places sit around palm trees   Just know gets hot lot shade   able find place sit but unfortunately through day lost shade just hot   ended spending most time pool    5 There's no schedule events   10 30 people thought Alesso would 1pm 1 said 3pm  He eventually started dj sometime between 3 30 4 00pm    6 Security both good bad experience them   First good actually water sure people ok   Bad boyfriend lost flip flops or someone took them midst hundreds people there   miraculously found mine  someone taken beginning day   asked staff where could buy new ones directed shops Wynn   ended going Wynn felt really appalled security staff there   Mind completely sober but because happened staying during time I am red card member literally blocked entrance come because boyfriend did slippers which happened while property   tried explain situation said could buy shoes slippers bf could wait outside but really rude condescending and if know takes lot upset would let either   Never life experienced type professionalism lack being service profession never would've treated anyone way treated     if don't stay actual hotel expect security staff less pleasant you   problem would've avoided if staff would've told mall across street instead directing Wynn    7 Atmosphere really nice coming empty but 1pm crowded takes long time  pool drinks bathroom pretty much stayed pool unless really out     Everyone's pretty nice chill but once drinks kick gets little crazy   group guys kept throwing stacks cash water   Also met group people bf hung really friendly cool   Also don't intimidated pool party because you'll your swim wear  know but everyone's fun once let fun   Overall would again?  Ehhh   probably once lifetime thing unless big group friends table cabana service  would rather chill pool friends family stereo playing background  <EOR> This honestly only day club worth going Vegas  set everything perfect always best DJs playing  tons shaded spots compared other day clubs even if don't table still plenty places sit around  course table life always lot better but love place still fun regardless  also love places dance pool girls on  whole EBC vibe just fun free  Every time always blast    The only thing should definitely consider if don't table prepared wait very long line unless before 11 am  Although doesn't really start poppin until noon when everyone tables start coming in  But wait definitely worth it  said   always good time EBC! <EOR> A little pricey ready spend drinks but dj over all experience great  <EOR> BEST POOL PARTY VEGAS!  Beautiful people left right     including staff! Surprise guest Ne Yo when opening week score! STIFF drinks well worth $15 p drink  food too    which super tasty nachos wraps etc  If wait line like did moves super fast don't impatient  Beautiful set up  2 different pools that aren't attached but super close together cabanas lounge areas but course pay those    The only downfall basically no where put your stuff  always someone watching your things on patrol because leave planter something unless want getting drenched poolside  Also places sit hang very limited  If early snag spot along edge pool if not    plan finding party sit stand sit pool just dance around no ones watching   A must go place if you're Vegas  You'd crazy miss party  <EOR> One best days Vegas! honestly over crowded fake sleazy nightclubs Vegas  Most time feel number dmv  Encore Beach Club definitely experience    People fairly nice crowd manageable most fronts  hard being two gay men night club day club Vegas  If you're beautiful woman chances getting anywhere difficult  bought pre sale tickets see Diplo time lives  quick drinks staff very helpful  Overall highly recommend experiencing day club scene Vegas  Encore Beach Club should top your list  <EOR> We cabana past weekend see DJ Snake perform  received amazing service moment arrived Jared  He able checked table quickly amazing service! entire experience encore pool exceptional all staff involved! Would definitely come again <EOR> Epic party  Tables ridiculously over priced but demand  real estate commands price  way epic adventure  <EOR> Came see Porter Robinson  Great party great music   Packed sure but uncomfortably so  quickly easily free charge  Good time! <EOR> I follow Peter L's review since both trip together pretty much exact same perspective EBC  First all forget coming general admin  Seriously if think all alcohol food consume throughout day why pool together couch 4 others? couch fit 5 people m sure $500 FB very easy blow through over course day  Dave Pappas contact all your EBC needs  Please pm Peter if guys need info    Now pool party itself Kaskade Sundays simply amazing  He pretty much tore roof off think better pool venue aside Wet good house DJs   little later normal because check day but buddies able hold couch us  location absolutely excellent  believe #503   right across center stage dance floor next gambling area   Pretty much prime territory far location goes   The service absolutely outstanding  couldn't help but notice EBC more staff working pool venue any other pool parties weekend  also no room shenanigans  If guy trying water stripper pole within seconds warned tossed out  Also sweepers all around walk way areas drying off floor people won't slip    waitress also very friendly answering questions delivering orders accurately time   To summarize everything EBC definitely focuses class factor pool parties  quote Dave P don't welcome steroid tatted jersey shore style crowd  party itself does its moments but even Kaskade Sunday wild Wet Republic   personally think good change pace  Vegas officially 1A Wet Republic 1B EBC pool parties would depending m feeling day  <EOR> Obviously everyone's experience different depending treatment hookups   I luckily did wait line nor did pay  also access cabana thanks good friend mine really didn't spend all much money deal crowds  $15 mixed drink bit steep opinion $15 chicken strips fries which fairly bland but hit spot when wasted but all relative especially considering didn't pay entrance cabana   The pool itself pretty sweet 2 stripper poles both which but definitely admit don't skills pay bills there     This pretty chill spot I'd definitely recommend anyone! <EOR> My pal Daniel G put 5 girlfriends list no cover us  Security bit strict items bring travel light  just getting settled pool when Patrick VIP host asked if we'd join couple guys cabana  course said yes enjoyed free mojitos some nice guys few hours  Beautiful pool great music fun crowd no idiots splashing pool they're 5 years old  Perfect day! <EOR> Got around 1 45 waited line 15 bad   Bad happens now   placed jam packed cannot locate friends over half hour   playing pretty good music bad couldn't enjoy myself because mission find friends   find friends them drunk super drunk   Within five minutes meeting them them pukes next thing know being forced leave   Did mention pay $30 + service fee in????  But just luck can't blame venue things this   Would better if granted re entry upon rest returning pool no  Sure rules them happens no re entry but absolutely no flexibility?

While he arguing loudly girl behind counter whether owe money hosts pulled aside apologized ushered in  mess  all perks promotions Vegas but rudeness never acceptable     All all feel same way club pools clubs themselves   If free otherwise ton other pools into just nice half price  <EOR> Scenario Summer Vegas!  Pros far CLEANEST day club Good service Spacious Good food  Cons Um   none?  In Nutshell Encore Beach Club far best day club although subjective e g  highly dislike Marquee therefore automatically assume day club sucks      First off EBC CLEAN  end day water still clear no cups bottles straws crap etc  floating around water   restroom floors constantly being mopped dried those walking around barefoot GROSS but digress      EBC also lot space people roam sit especially those don't order table service   Wonderful considering most clubs today your life miserable if don't happen want shell $10 000 table   pool also large enough accommodate many people making easy maneuver through duck way case anyone wants play chicken which security won't let happen but never know   it's Vegas!    Lastly when you're drunk starving bar area serves great food   chicken fingers waffle fries   16 drinks best thing you'll ever eat   GO  TO  EBC  Buy presales online line early   Doors typically open 11am run until 6pm  <EOR> Holy Crap! Now good time!  To ensure most pool party steroids gotta few things     Reserve cabana lilypad daybed   If large group definitely worth it  Otherwise pick bench near planter hope best     Get early   hook well before noon meet him   If early enough don't your spot may able talk host snag more prime location   Lastly   drink drink drink   I'd order food your cabana but drinks bar   pitchers alcohol seem good deal but weak hell   Find bartender keep going back     Eye candy days   never seen many hot bods place before   waitresses servers all extremely friendly HOT!!!  If pay steep price admission cabana might rethink 5 stars but stands best times Vegas had   besides wedding course  <EOR> Encore Beach Club cup tea   $50 Admission  Special DJ  but jeez!  I knew should research before going over there  Big MISTAKE!   The music horrible  All heard EDM    How people listen hours?! going insane just listening 2hrs!   It bad didn't care $50 just left   It's big but setup greatest    I went  saw  conquered  <EOR> I excited come here  heard nothing but great things day club  Unfortunately first visit also last visit    The bouncer whose name tag said G complete douche  boyfriend misheard request take off sunglasses thought G asked address  NOTE sunglasses address sort rhyme friend thought bouncer said address   Because boyfriend stated address G became suspicious  honestly stupidest yes know word  just stupid G decided handle situation things ever experienced  G very patronizing condescending  definitely power trip  other reviews aren't only people issues same bouncer  HEY MANAGEMENT maybe should pay attention your customers' complaints regarding same employee?!   Although day club regarded best day club Vegas take business elsewhere  I'd rather spend money less popular place if means friends treated respectfully  <EOR> Came 1st girls' trip Vegas absolutely loved it! Encore Beach Club everything hoped beach club experience! Came see David Guetta primadonna he did show until 3pm then pretended mix music stage    The bouncers ticket collectors impressive  Professional courteous efficient despite massive amount people here  Lines moved very quickly everywhere  really impressed beautiful bartenders here  girls constantly smiling moved lines quickly efficiently very calm despite massive mobs everywhere made great drinks not strong which bit disappointing but good very very professional good looking! Every staff member saw treated guests equally professionally which awesome see  Encore Beach Club maintains exclusive sexy hip vibe hiring beautiful staff but beautiful staff really know treat customers  Excellent!

The Beach Club large beautiful clean promotes socialization andddd there's nowhere sit unless want drop lot money  Literally even wall bench sit on  understand want promote interaction force people into wanting purchase cabana lily bed but fact stand hours upon hours baking sun made leave early  several bars food station which surprisingly also moved quickly helpful when you're trying drunk but sick    The people surprisingly dou****!

Towels provided purchase locker $20     We ended making friends bachelor party bottle service cabana drank free all day  group blast dancing music pool stayed until 3 4pm  all great time pool party would definitely come back again  <EOR> I ALWAYS recommend buying your tickets online pre sale   doesn't take genius see actually more efficient methods unless people REALLY cheap but online tickets only $30 00 girls purchased tickets you're always guaranteed unlike getting promoter's list  which 50 50 if trending DJ  pre sale ticket line also always no line because apparently everyone just wants free promoters line   Also come early around 10 30AM pool yourself least hour so   We Chainsmokers we came 11AM left 3 30PM still Chainsmokers weren't on forreal let more people necessary eventually felt sardine can  hard walk without being stepped bumped into drink spilled etc  there's little no shade patrons didn't purchase tables cabanas  which usually 90% crowd  security wouldn't even let put stuff floor near umbrella because honestly hot AF little shade nice because apparently belongs cabana tables area within 20 feet around kept kicking people's stuff edge pool even though cabana table wasn't even purchased yet empty    The only area  shaded bar because area gets crowded AF gross  bartenders very diligent efficient though having deal many people  Shots $21 50 per shot + $5 00 tip  DENG  Shit ESSPENSIVEE!  You know would nice if club just provided more FREE shade rest people  attending event  guys group pay $110 even online presale tickets poor male species Vegas LOL think would something consider whoever owns Encore  Some people pay come yet club even generous enough buy some more umbrellas  _ <EOR> If you're mood party wet place be!

Well need take cue Hakkassan group organize pre sale ticket lines cause no use buying pre sale EXPEDITED ENTRY tickets when no advantage all  still wait guest list line  wait hour EBC Night featuring Marshmello  bummer sure  No knew where direct where go  asked several staff some security answer where vague  Even group behind line same type tickets same issue knowing where go  Staff except person finally noticed ticket type but point waiting line long IDs checked twice already    SMH  general admission line moving faster ours  should never IMO   I've almost all Vegas clubs mega clubs its just sour grapes part  really need organize theirs   know EBC probably biggest capacity pool party but still  unacceptable  friends work dj some well known clubs town when told them wait time shocked     happens when dont bottle service once guess    But line wasnt moving much faster ours either   It's big space  Lots room walk around  Sound system great  Marshmello pretty dope  He def brings energy gets crowd moving  But experience line such hassle especially when pay more EXPEDITED ENTRY which turned more DELAYED ENTRY anything  <EOR> This BEST pool party  vegas!!  Reserved small daybed $500 four hit minimum easily   Kaskade  amazing staff very helpful   Only minor complaint didn't really find drink menu loved and found drinks little weak   Would recommend getting bottle instead next time  <EOR> I'm livid  just waited over 2 hours line told would pay more general admission whattttt?!?!? told hour ago would but now pay more if just bought ticket also if much room leave people paying clearly enough room guestlist??? Also keep trying convince people waited line over 2 hrs leave line which rude! <EOR> This place garbage  spending hundreds domestic beer physically assaulted bled head concert here  Because ensuing blood into pool forced leave missed entire show came see  wasn't even offered any compensation   place trash  never come again  <EOR> Crowded but tons fun   Lots gorgeous people yummy drinks clean bathrooms   don't love whole rummaging through your bag but apparently necessary otherwise doubt they'd bother adding extra overhead   looking good if need work your tan lilypad cabana upstairs  <EOR> I effing LOOOOOOVE EBC! Why?! People running around half naked having damn good time  There's nothing hide people all hanging open everyone see  Whether real fake jiggly jiggly you'll see here   Pool parties Vegas awesome  hella whoa! just said hella good time honestly prefer chocolate wasted pool any crowded nightclub Vegas  course when weekend Vegas plan usually party all day then party all night  tend 100% alive day pool but past time managed it    It friend's bachelorette party 18 girls us  all free partied cabana which balcony great view empty lot once Stardust  didn't matter nice place shade couches free alcohol drink  Some guys girls knew cabana allowed all 18 hang drink Goose  drank cabana partied pool don't remember much walk home    EBC really nice compared some other pool parties too  crowded which good thing but point where uncomfortable  pool clean area clean    wouldn't expect anything less nice hotel Encore  12 already jam packed suggest getting earlier that   Day drinking Vegas AWESOME! Even if don't night okay  Nightclubs overrated  Pool Parties where at! <EOR> At age 27 realized might time decided attend FIRST Vegas pool party  Since Labor Day weekend scorching outside opt night swim avoid heat  Gorgeous venue but crowd little young me  felt college party lol  But know old age telling this  All all great time! <EOR> For much love both Vegas dance music a match made heaven nonetheless took quite while visit Encore Beach Club which large seems touted gold standard daytime partying LV    The experience mostly thumbs few observations improvement _____________  + Even less stellar weather venue itself very beautiful  carries same cream red color scheme found inside Encore casino extends same aesthetic into outdoor venue  feel very upscale posh significant upgrade over rebranded YMCA pool look featured Wet Republic EBC's supposed rival    + There's fair amount plush seating lounge regardless if you've table reservations not  seats comfortable well padded other partygoers more willing room accomodate crew which greatly appreciated  Surprisingly minor touch practicality major upgrade over virtually any other dayclub Vegas except Drai's again looking Wet Republic more often free seating nonexistent altogether  While subject practicality little disappointed learn Encore doesn't offer complimentary tap water club patrons  Marquee Drai's remain only two dayclub properties offer common convenience honestly shouldn't much debate! If keep people hydrated they're only going more inclined drink more alcohol   and more alcohol = more profit! Given kinds places all bottom line doubt policy change near distant future   + flipside things EBC does provide complimentary towel service which slightly offsets financial hit you'll take dropping wads cash drinks Fiji all day  equivalent savings but suppose helps     Beers $12 each  suppose  standard Vegas party pricing much complain end    _____________ pretty big shocker group learn Alesso wouldn't performing scheduled and quite unfortunate turn events given planned pretty much entire first day Vegas around seeing   Through brief chat club's staff learned really uncommon headlining talent cancel EBC   sad say least   The DJ subbed did okay job but already shifted focus away dancefloor  Thus can't really comment overall experience seeing headlining DJ EBC    _____________  + fortune befriending some cabana goers during here cabana experience really felt royal treatment say least    For thing they're quartered off separately rest venue  Looking little privacy? Boom it  There's even balcony access enabling indulge view overlooks street traffic passing Encore  Due casino's position bit away core Strip there's much look but fresh air elevated view really feel you're getting VIP experience    Drinks seldom left unfilled cabana steady stream liquor beer bottled water all times  Service very attentive prompt  cabanas also feature plenty plush comfy seating when your tired legs need breather dancefloor    ____________  This really feels grown ups' sort pool party  Minimal shenanigans good vibes sophisticated approach towards dayclubbing  We'll back   just any day when Alesso's scheduled perform! <EOR> The bouncer checks your ID guest list best  5 stars  Cesar security also awesome! He helpful legitimately cared issues  He slippers girlfriend broke toe  However encore beach club very shitty place worth all money  example girlfriend kicked some unknown reason the security guard even said he mistook someone else   Luckily Cesar gave slippers she could phone!

Beer starts $14 liquor starts $20  Nightclub Don't assume EBC Night same nightswim found hard way EBC Night means its just regular nightclub pool closed off if title event includes Nightswim online then pool party we confused because promoter called nightswim showed casual clothes Girls usually drink tickets which used vodka champagne until 12 30AM Very limited dancing space <EOR> I much fun!

I'm sure some people good time club but knowing mentality which operate now never returning anything under Wynn name again    My advice ever here  willing take your money take more your money then eject without reason explanation CRIMINALLY ASSAULT BATTER peaceful paying customers    These people disgrace Wynn organization entire hospitality industry  criminally assaulted battered personnel  hearing attorney say least   Avoid plague  I'd rather herpes return establishment  <EOR> Read reviews figured knew getting into  general admission tickets showed 12 20 Kygo  waited 3 half hours finally around 3 45 right Kygo came on  great venue best dj's great time once in  think ticket line situation could improved especially paying customers  Would paid extra money expedited entry but can't speak fast line was  <EOR> I apologize length review but accurately explaining appalling lack courtesy organization no small feat  experience Encore Beach Club only explained expensive infuriating trip through airport security   Maybe spoiled amazing service everywhere else during stay Encore  Maybe unreasonable expecting consistent level service throughout same company  Everywhere else Encore including other clubs amazing service  Beach Club borderline police state   Me girlfriend spent previous day Encore's European pool blast  also Encore's nightclub XS night before great time well  expected Beach Club hybrid two positive experiences but end result worst both worlds   When showed 2pm pre purchased tickets hand surprised see only two lines cabanas all other guests no expedited line hotel guests and or ones advance tickets  wait line almost hour   There only sign while you're line which warns pool's policies no illegal drugs allowed   case can't read manager Alfonso reinforces point indiscriminate TSA esque verbal berating everybody waiting line  no other signs posted any other policies   Once through line encountered unexpected baggage inspection girlfriend's purse  nothing Encore's nightclub XS which no bag inspection whatsoever  inspector said purse checked baggage claim $10  wait line baggage claim 15 minutes this   It should also noted basically can't any pills your bag  If you're any medical regiment requiring pills being taken specific time day you're luck  easier them assume everybody addicted opiates show any level accommodation   We finally into party  looked might fun but honestly fun enough overcome frustration whole set up  place crowded composed over 75% guys  few girls would segregate themselves into own cliques very little interaction between two sexes very similar middle school dance   We bar 15 minute line   order round drinks ask charge room  bartender says need show key out all Wynn bars where charged drinks room only place require room key course no warning inconsistency posted anywhere   key left girlfriend's purse baggage claim back wait line another 10 minutes bag  frustration left this   On way asked speak manager referred Alfonso socializing content group girls  When he saw waiting talk he asked wanted  said I'd talk when minute polite but clearly irritated tone  He told wait nearby tree  He then walked off group girls continued trivial chit chat my girlfriend overheard conversation confirmed didn't regard serious matter whatsoever   unsuccessfully waiting 15 minutes conversation finish finally gave left European pool   All in all wasted $60 two hours privilege waiting countless lines being treated felon  No drinks ordered no music enjoyed nothing   I understand event open non hotel guests creates potential undesirables enter  However why create illusion exclusivity if you're actually going exclusive?  The Wynn supposed better this  Instead being follower trying emulate Hard Rock Hotel should creating experience strictly aimed its target demographic  Until then Beach Club simply bastardization Wynn brand  <EOR> Lots square footage   course dcor matches posh Encore hotel  quite possibly most extravagant Strip hotels    The staff when say staff mean hot female servers really friendly!  stark contrast Wet Republic where girls stop take picture you   Against grain most Hawaii travelers prefer going Vegas during summer dealing hot heat because love pool parties      hot girls bikinis drink party good time?  Where does Encore Beach Club rank list?  putting EBC #2 behind Marquee Day Club     Tip If know coming don't want deal long lines consider purchasing pre sale tickets   quicker shorter line pre sale price usually cheaper door   especially busiest weekends year Memorial Day Weekend MDW Labor Day Weekend LDW    earlier buy pre sale tickets cheaper are  prices escalate venue gets sold out    <EOR> K K D E  Always good time EBC   I prefer going Sunday avoiding line guest list girls tickets guys since its long Saturday   It incredibly long 1PM probably waited 45 minutes    Not complaining though because inside lit!!!! <EOR> One best day clubs vegas! came scorching hot summer guest list people wait 2 5 hours long ! Although upset vibe great! crowded but fun enough party  wouldn't pool water considering bathroom lines empty lol!  Drinks pretty expensive should friendly friends bottle service! <EOR> 3rd time Tweekers Twerkers Tanlines DIPLO  it overcast sprinkling when came few sundays ago ample space large pools crowd came later when sun came out   water perfect temp!    bartenders super nice thanks ice dehydrated state!

EBC where its at! Everytime time lifeee! Musics always point drinks delicious strong half naked bodies everywhere   more could ask !? Hahahha <EOR> I come EBC Wynn hotel every single time visit Vegas because best day club know lot people agree this    First all layout day club very important  yes pool party but need enough space regular people people don't tables cabanas rest chill well cough Marquee cough ugh   EBC huge Cabanas back two floors tables middle area then lily pads poolside  inquired prices Zedd Saturday bottom floor cabanas $8000USD tables $5000USD lilypads $3000USD  the prices vary depending location your table time year also DJ obviously  Even though seems lot money money actually counts towards your tables' minimum spending technically you're just required spend specific amount money more drinks food etc least you're spending yourself  love love love layout club gorgeous super friendly everyone  Free towels available  Bag check available sometimes which sucks if you're only friend two but larger lockers $75 day good option if big group  drinks super expensive $18 20 per mixed drink but if just want some water free plastic cup fill water fountain front back bathrooms    A sista also hungry once during day club coped herself some chicken fingers weren't pricey but freaking everything  honestly hangry chicken fingers saved life LOL    The worst part all day clubs DJ doesn't come until 2 3 30pm   usually guestlist 12pm 3hrs we're sober  usually plan try find table drink drinks XD HEH DJs point though random ones occasionally but music generally pretty good  Lastly yes know tickets crazy guys girls usually able free through guestlist but hey you're Vegas rage fun don't cheap just good time  <EOR> So disappointed missed Grandtheft last Thurs night   but disappointed service here  staff control worst way possible  Rude  Arrogant  Horrible       I  Can't  Even    Basically bouncers Josh snapped friend's ID's bc he thought might fake  Unfortunately fake ID  friend visiting state  But only did he damage government issued ID he tried brush off if problem told TSA would still let them fly but couldn't come into club  When asked speak manager club could written statement some random guy manager but said he Christopher came over try work situation  Ultimately hotel staff spoke general manager try work solution  took 2+ hours written statements supposedly Metro contacted but never showed  whole experience just left bad taste mouth    Here ultimately problem  only did guy damage property NO repercussions only NO SOLUTION  First off no reason he should broken ID  mean aren't scanners check fake IDs? But fine happened  Then what?!?! You're just gonna leave ANYTHING IT? didn't anything wrong did  FIX IT  absolutely no accountability part staff Encore    I'm sure beach club inside great but can't say same staff tend it    If could would give negative stars  <EOR> Saturday EDC weekend  $75 guys $30 girls $20 bag check   Ridiculous!  But friends blast!  I love pools here   big clean filled beautiful people   Steve Angello spun morning  He pretty good!

Every person 2 free towels night party 1 free towel day party  nice know don't charge that  Also great security  does slow down line when girls needs everything thoroughly checked but least know safe   Three things complain about  They don't give free water  $8 tiny bottle Fiji water why fancy water anyways?   hate when clubs pay water especially when 115 degrees out  Marquee gives free iced tap water which totally take over fancy bottled water  The staff working Encore bitchy  woman worked lines gave attitude when asked very reasonable question  people bag check rude too  Customer service everything leaves bad taste mouth when meet people but try let affect experience pool itself  I night pool party night before day pool party  When check bags give trash bag put your stuff in  goal sure trash bag closed else pay double extra bag  Here's catch night pool party gave giant bag day pool party gave noticeably smaller bag  6 able fit all things bag night pool party tons room spare but 2 separate bags day pool party  Also close front them if cut close stand contemplate good 10 seconds whether want charge $20 instead $10    Overall fun both times just going let little things complained pass  heard many  people favorite pool glad check different times day! <EOR> I ebc weekend bachelorette party   lilly pad table bottle service  place super clean all waitress's gorgeous sweet    except girl unfortunately personal waitress   first she ignored made feel small she rolled eyes extremely snotty when asked drink she made drink then left 30 mins   spoke manger asked new girl first bitched manger telling made waitress cry demanding   never said word girl since only saw once then she stayed table filled men never came back but still he listened since people dropping thousand dollars new girl   given Courtney M  She AWESOME! beautiful sweet she top drinks fun yet professional  also Ryan S  helping us   guy badass! seriously 112 outside guy running around taking care all tables side club he also very very nice helpful  ONLY reason going back because those two  made 2 hour wait insane heat bad start   well worth it! guys awesome! Thanks Guys! <EOR> I've gone many time always blast because DJs put good show crowd always lively happy  can't give perfect 5 stars two reasons jerk bouncer expensive drinks  here's few things place 1 Security If you're girl likely NO problems getting whatever you're wearing  If you're guy you'll probably fine long read dress code  If you're black guy watch racist asian security guy  He kicked friend wearing cotton shorts  Did read correctly? Yes   his Cotton Shorts  swimming trunks met right knee apparently didn't look good enough in  Mind same friend let two other bouncers two white males before reaching asian male bouncer his role check tickets? purses?   instead letting he directed friend swimwear store where cheapest swimming trunks men $85   Mind you   this having waited line hour  People line actually sympathized told security guy he being unreasonable jerk letting friend in  friend embarrassed didn't want cause scene he buy $85 shorts that basically shorter mid thigh    waited line again but time 30 mins  meantime already inside another friend stood security line observe same security guy   out curiosity  surprise 30 40 minutes waited friend no else kicked except other black male guess whom?? Yup same asian security guy   Unfortunately wasn't close enough hear reason may legitimate one   THIS time  But point whole thing if you're minority try give them more reason rid you  ridiculous but apparently extra diligent because still crappy people there  If see asian security guy OBSERVANT sure accountable any wrongdoings    2 Drinks Bartenders Keep mind drinks just everywhere else vegas approximately $20 piece even shots  Unless u something those souvenir cups which DAMN delicious  $65  finally ordered those past weekend some kind blue concoction  Holy cow good  definitely must have   female bartenders closest stage such sweethearts  usually expect female bartenders attend guys first because happens often but girls mindful everyone treated everyone equally   lady long dark brown hair somewhat tan not asian woman blonde woman didn't catch name but she extraordinary   She pleasant she made amazing drinks never watered down   Definitely tip well if see because she deserves it  wish water free at least allow order tap because when you're you're likely dehydrated especially considering long you'll dancing sun  Sodas should reasonably priced   enough money alcohol sales  No need greedy    3 Atmosphere Encore beach club super fun place while vegas  lost count many shows gone to  once disappointed   Even if u dont cabana stuff still blast   Everyone social much fun   guess because EDM DJs tend draw much friendlier crowd   Even if see people seem stuck they're really not  Everyone beautiful everyone awesome   if encounter jerks trust me   they're nobodies  plenty other people party with    oh bathrooms super clean  Don't douche you ladies   Tip people help you  $1 wont break your bank  <EOR> I spent 45 minutes line myself because friends already inside  met some interesting Bulgarians Vegas celebrate divorce  guy's advice me? Never married  Ok helpful   When finally inside packed  hard time walking DJ area bar  But music great even though later afternoon awesome time couple hours there  Next time sure early enough   Someone stole sandals  Good thing only cost $15 Target  <EOR> This best pool ever to  stayed Wynn April 21st paid $100 $50 female friend tickets night before  Sunday opening day Tiesto  showed half hour before opening private line pre paid hotel guests ahead everyone else massive line   first ones 11 am  host showed perfect free spot right along pool facing Tiesto  Within couple hours place filled up  most attractive crew ever seen  Half girls looked models friend drooling over guys  met great group people able within feet Tiesto dance  Rehab last year blew away  Far cleaner nicer much more attractive people  huge amount drink total bill $225  $325 including entrance wasted best parties ever too    more worth special occasion  dying back  <EOR> THE HYPE REAALLLL   fucking love EBC  line long fuck cover charge crazy but its all worth it   One best day pool parties Vegas  must when during poolparty season Vegas    Encore Beach located Encore LOL obviously but also used Surrender night  multiple pools area mini casino bar infamous DJs play usually front pool front bar section    Pros Pool usually refreshingly cool freezing bottle service day beds cabanas plentiful seated great places bartenders gorgeous! lifeguards pretty amazing haha chill people meet music pumping amazing everywhere drinks strong      and THEY SERVE HENNESSY OMG EXTRA STAR swear no where else Vegas almost cried happiness  Cons the wait line almost two hours long cover charge ridic but guestlist early big apologies male race lol Uhhh literally everywhere wet no dry place put your stuff unless wanna pay locker   Meaning squishy towels     Forget drying off your towels wetter time you're done! packed fuuuuck point where feel fall off walking pathway bar but whatever more people meet right??
