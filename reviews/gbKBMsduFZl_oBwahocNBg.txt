Great service well! <EOR> 109 degrees hours outlet mall shopping calls nice cold sweet treat friends decided stop Sin City snowball two more 7 but don't judge     I'm going jump right in  short tatted woman taking orders reason why won't trying place again  Here's why So     prior taking order group young girls ahead woman for sake review refer Jane  didn't name don't want keep referring woman completely enamored with  While waiting she flirted them 5 minutes  Hey all getting when but hell 109 degrees want damn snowball  7 minutes endless macking she noticed agitation finally asked would order  she's writing down orders Jane receives call cell  She stops taking order she answer phone  asked wait nor any apologies interruption     After call ended she began taking orders again  total 5 group  She took two orders then turned back began having side conversation those fine ass girls completely confused disoriented  tell several times more orders needed taken before she finally turned attention back us    One friends asked recommendation  Jane recommended tigers blood cherry strawberry concoction  friend decided one  all took 10 minutes place orders five folks did mention 109 degrees outside? took another 10 minutes everyone order here's why she mixed all red snowballs everyone ended someone else's  some reason don't write flavors cup Jane no idea snowball belonged whom  Remember tigers blood cherry strawberry concoction she recommended? Well Jane wrote order incorrectly did mention she's recommended it? wait while made another one     While trying whole thing sorted Jane receives another call she yep guessed answered it  kidding me??? standing over 20 minutes due your complete incompetence take another phone call??? Did mention 109 degrees outside? point woman believe owner finally stepped in  She very nice patient polite  She fixed orders even gave two free snowballs but unfortunately damage done    In terms actual snowballs paraphrase great Dennis Green thought case crushed ice flavored syrup  good great definitely worth waiting 109 degree weather    In conclusion Jane needs go  Poor customer service + F ing snowball + 109 degree weather = pissed off customer  Maybe try place again year hopes Jane would fired then but don't see myself returning anytime soon  <EOR> Tried ice snack 89XXXExhibition block party Fremont   They long list flavors different mixes but stuck classic cherry  flavor pretty good but ice chunky pain ass waiting melt finish snoball  Also wasn't much flavor begin half way through snack all left ice  Bleh  <EOR> Love yummy donut holes PB J Smores   Yumm!
