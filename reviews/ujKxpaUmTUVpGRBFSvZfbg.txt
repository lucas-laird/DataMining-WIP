Bradley Ogden's restaurant showed how   Located Caesar's Palace Bradley Ogden's positioned along small row restaurants within casino  exterior space fairly unassuming subdued décor within  didn't venture far into actual restaurant burger only served lounge area  Apparently $19 isn't good enough regular menu although sure price would serve if requested   Being blend 'house ground steak' according menu ordered medium rare sample would hopefully tremendous flavor  think far long wait random week night when wasn't busy food arrived  presentation great see picture but situation quickly deteriorated there  Because meat supposedly amazing according chef burger served absolutely no toppings just bun  offered ketchup spicy mustard decent aioli along 'salad' fries but all  Upon biting into burger came across largest disappointment night though overcooked burger! would think $19 would medium rare order correct? No such luck  really pissed off Burger Boy wasn't thrilled either  meat much flavor expected such blend meats maybe because cooked much don't know  bun ok toasted pretty well maybe bit dry too  But together just didn't hold well without any other toppings being juicy bloody ordered  lettuce 'salad' ok but kind place when yearning some real toppings burger instead  also two different types pickles tasty but still enough redeem this   The saving grace whole meal fries fantastic  Large natural cut seemed sea salt sprinkled them delicious  If anyone remembers place called Boardwalk Fries around late 80's rivaled them  But we're review burger burger wasn't right  Being able properly deliver order huge part review if fail cook burger properly when costs much does total fail  refuse send burger back during review process although sometimes might depriving myself something better  way $19 burger worth it  <EOR> I've eaten Bradley Ogden four times  service always impeccable food very good  usually very reasonable prix fixe offering  way go  If you're Vegas definitely worth visit  <EOR> Had great experience Bay Area chef's recent or pretty recent foray into world Las Vegas mega casino restaurant  Can't recall specific prices well meal apologize being helpful area  service spot on placing order based most server's suggestions  four started two appetizers bluefin tuna sashimi fried frog legs  first your standard sashimi appetizer high end restaurant but second course amazing  Perhaps best single dishes ever tasted  meat itself incredibly light moist perfectly fried seasoned  accompanied some sauce since forgotten but good also since some table wary remaining two whole dish ourselves  entrees light scallops sturgeon chicken hake a light fish   All excellent hake perfectly flaky  All accompanied great riesling suggested waitress well  To echo another reviewer wine list very expansive features lots CA WA selection priced $50 $9000 We again server suggest desserts ordered four best including lemon tart apple crisp two chocolate desserts  lemon but other three pretty fantastic especially because all came ice cream   end meal presented butterscotch pudding very nice finishing touch  absolutely stuffed end meal leave plenty time enjoy tea coffee before rush off show   Other reviewers right restaurant located busiest parts Cesars but none outside noise traveled into restaurant all  fact very soothing art deco meets zen type decor it  very California  <EOR> How many different ways say food poisoning    know   it's shocking   a Michelin star all    but true   only thing ate husband did signature Maytag blue cheese souffle   woke morning regretting ever having stepped into restaurant   violent   guess happen anywhere   tell truth most shocking part experience total apathy restaurant management   called inquire let them know   promptly referred security referred risk management blew off   guess won't respond unless lawyer calls   Craziness  <EOR> Not very good  wouldn't come back here  wasn't impressed menu all  waiter did excellent job making food sound delicious but party 5 none enjoyed meal  Below average food prices way high  would more happy pay good amount good meal but bad meal + high prices = disappointing experience  I scallops other both steaks chestnut soup caesar salad The cocktail menu unimpressive well  resort back basic vodka soda water which disappointing because free casino    If Caesar's Palaca want eat would recommend Mesa Grill over Bradley Ogden any day  <EOR> Without doubt best experences Vegas far  Exceptional white table cloth service beautifully presented food pleasant friendly atmosphere made want come back next time Vegas! food delicious just far enough outside box highly impressed but exotic unfamiliar  Even great ratings place underrated opinion well worth money won't disappointed! <EOR> I never heard Bradley Ogden before making plans stay Ceasers LV but definitely checking next time am San Fran  concept fresh foods brought farm table tasted if case  food simple yet delicious  chicken perfect exactly want roast chicken  steak wife among best ever had  eat nice Chicago steakhouses no small claim  large table allowed taste several apps each well prepared clean tasting  blue cheese souffle ceaser salad both standouts  know much restaurant feel when walk out  despite late Vegas start time walked midnight feeling full yet totally ready hit tables  <EOR> We ate last meal vegas made great choice!

carrots being fav she told server   viola!  steak came bed carrots fingerling potatoes   very nicely done   after entrees stuffed asked leftovers packed   passed dessert but wondering if restaurant would bring someting since mentioned lady taking reservation fiancee's birthday when she specifically asked any special requests? but no   little dissapointing   oh well   i didn't say anthing ready way but then server brought two mini shots butter scotch flavored butternut squash whipped cream desserts!  he said he didn't want leave w o having something sweet   nice!  the minus star accounts two things 1 ok great steak 2 when opened leftovers completely left all fiancee's carrots!!  hell?  favorite part!  just packed meat few fingerlings and goat cheese croquet she didn't finish but no carrots   she lot left over meal   needless say she bummed that   overall great service fresh high quality food   we're still fans Mr  Ogden looking forward tasting other creations  <EOR> The food excellent   came vegetarians didn't try any delicious sounding meat alternatives but blue cheese souffle risotto excellent   lovely restaurant inside but awfully close casino   contrast Bellagio restaurants Picasso Olive real oasis particularly given side decks   All being said back  <EOR> Another fabulous Las Vegas restaurant!  decor atmosphere classy but comfortable service primary waiter impeccable truly professional food outstanding   signature Caesar salad very good New York Strip Loin flavorful downright delicious probably best steak tasted long time     The sommelier rude condescending when sent first bottle wine back but she must gone tasted because when she came back different bottle she lovely   first bottle really terrible!

sooner  actually enjoyed place more dinner Daniel Boulud Brasserie few nights before  atmosphere while elegant DB Brasserie felt more warm inviting  seated cozy 2 top front half restaurant  appreciate fact space tables give diners little privacy  Many places cram many tables possible leaving diners foot apart neighbors and hate when larger patrons squeeze big ass knocks into beverage     We ordered prix fixe restaurant week menu which also available nightly basis pre theater menu    FIRST COURSE Blue cheese souffle smaller thought would be  look 2 little muffins  plating nice flavors great  blue cheese souffle matched figs fabulous  Yellow corn soup good blue cheese souffle even better  Creamy yet thick watery little bit kick spiced popcorn   MAIN COURSE Alaskan halibut better fish dishes recently  delicate flakey tremendous flavor  usually big fan bok choy but well fish  Pork loin dish 2 sizable cuts pork both very tender tasty  star dish potato croquettes  only three them but could eaten whole plate full them  Fabulous!
