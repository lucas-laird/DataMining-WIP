Well take back Panda's order half noodles half fried rice because ir right front!   Once again if poorly represented Chinese food well decorated environment lot other non Chinese want pay more place America loves!   It still cracks when waitress asks if need help mixing sauces us! if exotic strange somehow!   Uh three Exotic sauces are Chinese mustard Red Chili paste Soy Sauce! same stuff disposable condiment packets Panda Express  she saw using chopsticks already! Do ask people if need help chopsticks too? I think should only ask mixing sauces question if  A people aren't Asian  B using forks  C seem clueless things little glass jars normally little plastic packets! <EOR> As always great place dine asian fusion cusine   But enjoy getting takeout here   Call ahead its just good if eating in   take containers keept things warm rice let cloud steam when home   shows steamy freshness which packaged up!  highly recommended if u've craving! <EOR> Part famous Restaurant Row Las Vegas @PFChangs provides pleasant dining experience   A nice outdoor patio long bar course dining room  Lots TVs catch games service TOPS!
