Horrible service  September special kids eat free Sundays  because nephew wanted eat chipotle birthday today  ordered child stroller being watched mother in law   lady said needed charged kids meal because didn't child us  Then nerve speak each other Spanish kids meal ordeal  Just because different ethnicity don't assume can't speak Spanish don't talk s*** front customers different language  register informed pay kids meal  showed child asked if issue told no said kids meal normally older children granted child little over 1  don't see anything wrong feeding mashed beans 1 year old  Also didn't see stipulation age child qualify kids meal  settled issue guy register came stated card declined showed receipt cleared issue  observed if he going ask customers before but he didn't  Very rude very unprofessional  don't know restaurant ran but clearly needs its staff retrained let go  first last time coming location  Very disappointing  <EOR> This place point every time  did problem time but helped took care max!

Came Sunday 8pm  Ordered two steak bowls only told steak wasn't ready would take only few minutes more  charge place? Poor planning part  If steak your most popular item don't start cooking when there's no more left  Every time far steak isn't ready  Tired it  just left place Panda down street  Now mean when say won't back!! <EOR> Been coming years but today left happier *usual sometimes irritated because some servers stingy! always Veggie Bowl brown rice without beans everything else  server girl today Sunday 04 23 5 20pm ish not cashier hooked other ingredients instead since didn't want beans  Happy mouth tummy YAY! extra lettuce Asian couple Rayban shades lol  Thanks! <EOR> I've eaten lot Chipotles know when location off  Being fatty am chipotle because give large burrito      that being said place seriously skimping everything  ask extra everything just burrito come close normal size  saw other patrons burritos come super small  seen another location before where some friends employees confirmed manager knowingly forcing employees everything smaller company standards         I wonder if case location well  <EOR> Known fact Chipotle Mexican Grill suffering many ways   Recently noticed obvious management order line servers reduce quantity every item sold   Less rice less meat chicken etc   Even weight bag chips declined  must ask knife salt bottled hot sauce   Clear signs desperation    The only thing declined prices    Today fewer usual chips soggy oil   second bag just tasteless    Our return visits becoming less frequent   You're doing yourselves Chipotle  <EOR> This probably 10th time coming here  greeted door all staff     Literally welcome chipotle!!!!!!
