Word mouth Yelp reviews! <EOR> Fast food pizza anyone?   I picked couple pies last week suggestion friend   prices reasonable under $10 slightly larger personal pan pie  line staff very friendly  venue small only few tables  recommend place cheap eats kids     I ordered two pies To Go  When home 5 mins away pies still warm but clearly properly cooked throughout way good pizza should just oven  sauce tasted bit raw sautéed proper time  originally planned order gluten free crust but came freezer changed mind ordered wheat crust   When wheat crust pie ordered came oven cheese bubbly even slightly browned   fact entire center just warm ingredients clearly cooked together    I put whole thing back into oven finish cooking which helped blend flavors cook cheese but now crust overcooked      Interesting concept but needs some work   PS If check YELP before place your order rewarded $1 off coupon   Wish known advance  Signage? <EOR> This second visit less week's time off beaten path work home    show enjoyed pizza much!  staff attentive accommodating patient very tough decision dress your pizza   pizza    delicious super fast! love variety  doughs sauces toppings which available fact really creative wish   great experience   cannot wait until return! <EOR> Some friends Custom Built Pizza last Friday night reading all promising reviews   disappointed!
