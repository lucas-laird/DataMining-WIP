The restaurant smart though  doing promotion where half off all dim sum dishes  Hmmm wonder why?? Because restaurant awful  lure people show actually lot people  When first came restaurant thinking must good because many people but fooled    I repeat  DONT  COME  HERE   Don't let crappy food ruin your lunch dinner did mine  <EOR> This place become must spot whenever visit Vegas   generally very good dinner service but dim sum somewhat lacking behind when compared other places nearby although still better those places down Chinatown    ambience any other Chinese restaurants table placements close depends where sit but generally clean   service decent average   Dim sum morning ok good but still bad overall compared Chinatown   would rate somewhere middle   Dinner best part place great selection live seafood often time special deals going live seafood   especially fresh live shrimps lobsters   Overall place must go Chinese seafood dishes during dinner time but dim sum morning definitely secondary choice  <EOR> If could give them 'No Star' rating would   WORST SERVICE EVER!  numerous dim sum places around town but never passed ignored much life!  NEVER GOING AGAIN   Go Orchid Garden Sahara  it  <EOR> The food cheaper strip  But low quality food  When arrived many people door  But still many empty tables  would give them 1 star service   I ordered goat hot pot Vegetable beef hong kong style sweet sour spare ribs   All them salty  could some extra MSG  meal thirsty  drink 2 bottles water  food quality way below average   I give them 2 stars acknowledge low price restaurant  But rest disappointed  better chinese food session cheap buffet panda express  <EOR> How come people only give 3 stars place?  THEIR FOOD TASTES GREAT!!!!!!  we ate much only pay $15 per person!  the hakau realllllly good skin perfect!!!  i love leek pork shrimp dumpling good   the lomakai shrimp lapchiong inside which find other places   the fried bread crispy thick! <EOR> Absolute worst service ever lot Chinese restaurants  All other times nothing worth mentioning but most recent time last time   Now don't know all titles staff just refer them waiters busers  think 2 servers 2 3 busers throughout course meal  2 3 because think saw two busers looks identical being racist because Chinese myself just count them both person    We first put order  didn't keep track time but probably 20 30 minutes appetizer still no soup though  supposed come first   Buser #1 delivers appetizer but practically drops dish table loud thud immediately walks away  10 20 minutes later other dishes started coming  worst dish sizzling pepper steak  thing dish when comes your table steak supposed sizzling metal tray  case came room temperature meat metal pan expect absolutely no sizzle   Sometime throughout meal asked Buser #1 if we're supposed soup  He responds saying don't ask ask waiter  ask waiters he apologizes says he'll soup  10 minutes later still haven't received soup don't really bother anymore  waiter walks asks if received soup yet which said yet he could tell lack soup bowls  He immediately gets someone again bring soup  time Buser #2 puts bowl soup down sure where mind but drops soup spoon into bowl splashes all soup mom suffering most splash damage  He says sorry once but incident think should more apologetic   After few more dishes arrive ask rice which something should need yourself Chinese restaurant   Finally when we're done eating ask Buser #1 some to go boxes  He brings back boxes before he walks away says Ask someone else   WTF kind attitude that?  In end audacity charge 18% gratuity party 4 dreadful service    Overall food decent but PAINFUL eat degree service  <EOR> This good dimsum places Las Vegas  <EOR> Maybe heat maybe 5 straight hours drive because dim sum didn't taste great which strange because lot customers when arrived      There lot variety  say no few carts coming because same food carts nothing interesting them  Food okay but some items hot enough  just warm made mediocre food even worse   Service okay  keep asking where carts but did refilled teapot when empty    Overall okay place if you're desperate some dim sum but don't think coming back anytime soon  <EOR> I craving some Dim sum place area at  honest place all pretty much same  just comes down food  where place delivers  Everything tried liked  expert dim sum cant comment each dish individually  really liked everything  servers really nice too  other places where servers aren't friendly plus book  give them try  <EOR> Food delish! Loved every last bite fine dinner  Sadly read everyone's reviews see why would bad rating   but because food    the dinning area really dated needs improvement  <EOR> Came couple years back dad he school'd place  Recently visited May quality still right on   Escaping craziness Vegas strip all tourist y luring commercial chain foods worth drive here    We clams black bean sauce chinese broccoli snow pea tips garlic sauce     and to die for dish  creamy curry concotion goodness golden crab served alonside deep fried savory donuts sop sauce    It delicious lick plate but realized public   Not fancy but food worth effort thumb your way strip  <EOR> Best combin ation fried rice! Great place dim sum  <EOR> Alright am huge fan food but place scares little finding news channel 13   know places Chinatown always getting hit usually clean act but sometimes entropy kicks you're risking it  trying focus food here   I dinner during week during dim sum weekends   prefer place during dim sum huge 180   kind enough let your order off menu if weekend favorites Tuesday night which very nice   roast duck calamari Chinese greens oyster sauce crispy pork  OMG crispy pork dipping sauce can't remember sauce but good   pork!

Don't worry griping actually nice sit back food placed front me  when you're token white guy among table five Chinese all speak Dim Sum ladies native kinda useless try involve yourself    I think second trip Cathay House   basic Dim Sum fare everything pretty fresh   did start off wrong foot burning roof mouth crazy looking shrimp ball which way would avoid next time around    In addition some good dim sum vegetables singapore rice noodles point  <EOR> I've only twice also yet venture other dim sum restaurants Vegas  But love place  reminds home Hawaii actually more specifically reminds Legends except smaller   The dim sum delicious  nice dim sum area smaller don't wait cart around entire restaurant want  The prices also very decent  think paid $30 $40 3 people  Location right off Spring Mountain Road parking lot always stalls available free    The staff very friendly fast   Dining area very clean  Place opens 10 30am weekdays  <EOR> Wasn't really planning Dim Sum Vegas but dad

located near Spring Mountain Rd  small dinky restaurant but surprised hours opened 10 30 am 5 am 7 days week    I figure don't much money  just 30 minutes opening quite already some patrons   They dim sum carts ones order paper good  food opinion pretty bad    the lady telling food fresh just came but warm instead steaming hot  skin rice rolls thick sui mai beef balls lacked taste  only dish liked Shredded pork thousand year old egg porridge   that hot just right texture  Sticky Rice Chicken okay but more radishes beef tendon bowl then beef tendons    The selection food meager lot unique dim sum choices but expected guess  service eh   they weren't busy but took long time them refill tea pots  time left few more diners  place pretty weak but eh really didn't expect much first place  <EOR> Something just missing place compared other dim sums had  Service pushy start  kept rushing order when still waiting entire party seated  liked custard buns shumai duck  Don't waste your time money lobster pasta  lobster good but noodles bland forgettable  fan them having take food back reheated before serving either  probably wouldn't back better places dim sum  <EOR> I little scared coming
