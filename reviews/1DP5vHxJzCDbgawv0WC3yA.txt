The drinks really good terribly priced Strip   asked something boozy bartender made just let's just say laughing little hard Mr  Piffles during show   Also ordered couple veggie items menu Fennel Salad Curry Cauliflower    really didn't think worth price   portions small think tapas much going on   Next time spend money another drink   If chance Rose  Rabbit  Lie  then go! Run don't walk! <EOR> Details Vegas Nocturne show sufficiently covered other reviews but simply say show hilarious highly entertaining diverse talented cast   Comparatively speaking think tickets 35 50% overpriced entertainment value provided but room quite small limited schedule understand tickets may need priced such cover expenses production   would definitely see show again but only via discounted comped tickets   Far more concerning drinks both bar area showroom also 35 50% overpriced   case round only two drinks a Bombay Sapphire martini single Jameson neat $40 plus tip   WAY  TOO  MUCH   Offensively much   most ever paid similar round drinks all Vegas     Prices high pretty much guarantee Rose  Rabbit  Lie  cannot maintain loyal local customer base but rather limited mostly tourists locals splurging special occasions   would love drop hang bar whenever Cosmopolitan but those kind prices prohibit regular visits   As entertainment spilling over into bar restaurant area lot fun watch  However since bar restaurant sort backstage area random short bits music show all hear while Vegas Nocturne going area otherwise absent music during time quite annoying   Having seamless continuous music throughout bar restaurant during main show definitely needs some work   I can't comment restaurant food except note menu filled fancy shmancy nonsense such caviar bone marrow  cup tea nor within desired dining budget   I give bar show three stars now but lower cocktail prices possibly lower ticket prices better management music bar dining rooms during shows then I'd no problem giving five stars  <EOR> What say place? stumbled across while heading towards buffet knew effort dine next time Vegas    Rosé  Rabbit  Lie  modern supper club   a dinner show   something dying breed establishments  throwback 40s 50s modern twist classic tradition  elaborate selection modern interpretations classic cocktails   including use clarified milk  wine list   wowzers  If can't find something don't belong near wine glass! opted Sezarac   an adaptation 1950 Langford old fashion   it pungent powerful absinthe rinse really set off!

The desert menu included tapas style dessert called chocolate atrium   which includes various chocolate delight served under giant glass dome   the presentation looked fabulous   the apple butter cheesecake jumped opted that  disappointed!  And now   the icing cake   the entertainment! real reason wanted come here  Every night every hour live entertainment which includes 4 piece band singers dancers   this sets place apart  musicians dancers true entertainers engaging entertaining entire room   I can't wait till next time Vegas come back Rosé  Rabbit  Lie  <EOR> The main show amazing   But dinner fell flat   Service lack luster unobservant   why LET tax dinner $45 00 3 pax top price tickets which paid separately???  $600+ 3 people plus price show much       recommendation skip dinner just show    <EOR> We such great time last night! atmosphere lively food incredible  Thanks having us  <EOR> Based outward appearance place would 5 stars   loved old timey feel decor menu appearing sealed wax   2 singers great other Aretha Franklin type very good   tap dancer kid doing some hip hop dancing   Very loud live band but entertaining nonetheless   The food average but grossly overpriced   $24 3 scallops   3 average sized scallops   glad snacked chips salsa before reservation   Our server terrible   seated near band very loud pointed wanted menu   comes plate oysters which did order    cannot stand them   waitress comes back plate sent back proceeds argue ordering it   She handled situation very poorly   what's her?

All keep wanting write AMAZING    AMAZING   AMAZING!  So obviously enjoyed show  such incredible social event  eclectic group performers  tap boxing comedy routines acrobatics    This joint 4 place  There's dinner option bar show last show turns into night club  SECOND dullness  During dinner cast member  may just hop piano while lovely lady jumps piano serenades dinner crowd rendition   Robin Thicke's blurred lines     You MUST experience whether you're local just visiting Las Vegas! <EOR> I LOT family didn't really know expect  found family matriarch reserved private room family reunion double birthday party  seated main dining area first  Then when attention brought fact private room booked ushered into room bar area  people sitting bar thought maybe once left wouldn't bring more people but did   which made whole toast part evening kind awkward  Our table really small pretty crammed but drinks good  Then came food   I underwhelmed most it  liked duck confit but some reason noodles dish comically long  asparagus dish joke caricature would expect asparagus dish fancy restraint being 1 2 spears pretentiously dressed plate  For entree ordered medium rare filet minion  filet pretty good bit salty though green stuff sat sad flavorless cooked spinach maybe? don't remember   Everyone but daughter ordered medium rare filet  All but filets came cooked medium rare  Unfortunately filet cousin happens executive chef   when became clear bad management restaurant particular night   Our chef relative very nicely asked new filet she recieved overcooked   The manager brought another asked if she would cut open she did again steak overcooked  She asked manager temp steak cooked he said medium rare plus  She told chef no medium rare plus  manager then began argue because process use can't cook filet medium rare which point she very purposely looked each steaks cooked medium rare but manager ignored didn't realize   The manager asked try ribeye instead  Really? want trade filet ribeye? She clearly wasn't happy said she didn't really want ribeye but if  all then fine  She brought ribeye looked very grisly even dim light  She took bite spit into napkin saying very overcooked  Then husband tried also spit into napkin   I never EVER seen husband spit food out  Then piece given 12 year old daughter stabbed repeatedly just tenderize enough fork  She deemed really tough daughter also underwhelmed pasta dish  She's 12 shouldn't take much impress her  Give totinos pizza she gobble The manager came back whole ordeal told he should really take look food coming kitchen  He said nothing just put plate shelf near bar where sat rotting until left maybe still   cousin point pretty livid just asked bread which she nibbled while fuming  To put perspective cousin stated sent food back six times life three them tonight  would unacceptable any restaurant but ludacrious price point  I would given place star but bartender servers good much more attentive cared more manager alone brought rating up  <EOR> This venue cool unique reminded sort Alice Wonderland   food really delish its intended ordered shared plates   scallops best table love prime rib   s'mores dessert good   ladies singing during dinner also tap dancer break dancer   fun entertaining can't wait back  <EOR> I decided spoil myself last week visit Rose  Rabbit  Lie  must say party 'over the top' WOW experience!

Vegas many times but far best experience Vegas  Spent five days Vegas couple weeks back decided fancy date night first night city  heard friend place supposedly really good   Thought would great place kick off Vegas vacation    Had reservations 9pm but when table wasn't ready  escorted lounge resembled mini library while waited table which didn't really mind because wanted pre dinner drinks anyways  door lounge opened another door leading main dining room opened felt different world hidden behind door  Definitely excited dinner    The lounge quiet compared door just walked by  definitely Great Gatsby feel  tried Airmail El Diablo both delicious but enjoyed Airmail more  Once finished drinks escorted into main dining room  Decor great loved lighting restaurant  soon sat down band started play  sitting back back band partition between us  music started play said awesome band other room then said partition started down watching band behind  really cool partition down because then even part restaurant could watch entertainment well  band great kid tap dancing piano    Now let's good part  food!  Rose  Rabbit  Lie great place because small plates type eaters  love food when given opportunity try number dishes happy    Started off gougeres which soft biscuit filled truffle mornay sauce  good but greatest thing  also oysters half shell  Four oysters trio sauces  cognac cocktail sauce mignonette horseradish sorbet  Used all three combination amazing  Oysters really fresh too! also Heavenly Eggs which seen menu but didn't seem exciting  However amazing server convinced try am glad he did! Rather pricey $6 each small piece egg custard black truffle  But OMG! delicious! If come Rose  Rabbit  Lie order this  Something different sure but won't regret it  almost another order    After moved brussel sprouts which crispy chicken skin manchego paprika  good but think next time order new dish try its place  bone marrow which really good well! Also ordered duck confit pasta would definitely order again  Sometimes pasta cream sauce leave feeling heavy full but this  smaller serving pasta usual but then again sharing everything  might own order next time P ended meal small chocolate truffles served ice dessert those good really smooth sweet   If you're looking something different Vegas highly recommend going Rose  Rabbit  Lie  wouldn't recommend first date since does loud making hard talk  But ambiance live entertainment great food its presentation amazing service wonderful just such fun experience! definitely going back  <EOR> Wow review #600!  seriously thought already wrote review Rose Rabbit Lie oh well goes!

Cherries Jubilee don't remember exact price but expensive!  figured only live once would awesome dessert made tableside   roving cart cherries jubilee bananas foster your table   Although pricey worth every penny especially if group   plenty dessert everyone REALLY good!  This could easily 5 star review however found service lacking also table VERY uncomfortable   seated high 2 top separated bar screen   felt top people next we middle    server stand behind take order deliver food   Although busy night don't think busy all crammed together!
