The menu reasonably extensive excited presence satay sticks among appetizers  Satay both sticks off very popular Australia hard find delighted find it  When arrived pleased discover mix 6 8 sticks half which chicken half beef  exactly authentic satay tends more toward Thai style Malay Indonesian which prefer sort Americanized Thai version but still extremely tasty  sticks came three dipping sauces  Thai Peanut Satay Soy which just soy sauce didn't bother sweet tangy sauce some description which enjoyed  plate garnished some chopped cucumber which freshly prepared wife could smell across table   For main dish probably bit weak ordering Sedona burger  wish more adventurous now based quality appetizer but trying good value could $25 coupon going overboard expensive dishes  burger fine was  good quality burger but generic  really liked crusty floury bun came on   thing actually glad ordered burger might otherwise denied chance try FRIES came with  Hands down best fries tried since coming USA closest taste Australian chips   Usually 80% fries meal remain plate but absolutely delicious couldn't stop eating them  discovered particularly excellent dipped into remains cheese fondue wife ordered appetizer you'll read when she gets around writing own review    Overall loved experience excited late night option close home look forward sampling more adventurous options menu  service decent atmosphere pleasant knows cools down maybe try fantastic looking patio area outside  <EOR> Sedona alot potential if realized but some changes need made before gets there     I checked Sedona yesterday Dad lunch  Being vegetarian first thing he noticed took vegan burger patty off menu replaced caprise paninni sandwich  Unfortantely adding large pieces cheese balsamic vinegar glaze sandwich isn't really substitute vegetarian burger  usual standard 'Cali Club' which feel only thing probably order anywhere wrong  sandwich good but amazing  seems used thickness texas toast slices putting much turkey bacon into sandwich  $14 expected little more   I think issues really brought down review rating service  Coming around 1pm noticed place virtually empty  maybe two other parties main dining area near bar  However ton employees easily numbering diners all running around doing something other serving us  wave down server ride ranch refills drinks  think stated other reviews again hate having flag down servers refills check  If hunt them down why even servers?   One redeeming aspects Sedona definitely place itself  Sedona Lounge beautiful  outer architecture interior design definitely step above other bar food restaurants place usually compared to  interior looks high end steak house patio probably nicest town   Now heard some great things Sedona friends which want give place second chance  Maybe off day something disappointing hearing praise some fellow yelpers  <EOR> Bread pudding n choc cake amazing!!!!!

Also everyone really nice accommodating which made pleasant evening  <EOR> A while ago we're talking months myself two other friends came check happy hour   barely missed think because only beer   told bartender wanted sit outside told would send server there   outside sat   and sat   and then tired sitting   Buffalo Wild Wings instead   visited once forgotten wait staff just bad experience right?    So came back friend last night   two ordered Ahi Tuna Chips White Truffle Flatbread   ahi delicious!  flatbread good but nothing extraordinary   rating heavily weighted lack of service received last night     I really dissatisfied service prevent ranting simply list things pleased I ordered two waters friend I   Three times   first time asked water also ordered food thought waiter put order forgot water no big deal   second time asked water when waiter brought wine cocktail more later    third time when food brought asked water again waiter said should coming right up   yeah   water comes served wine glass ice two little cocktail straws   Yet every other table regular glass ice water  My friend ordered glass wine ordered Rob Roy   Waiter brought drinks he set down looked glass coke front me   Rob Roy scotch sweet dry vermouth maybe bitters no coke whatsoever   But nice enough charge Rob Roy  thoughtful them! The intervals waiter checked random best   15 minutes before waiter first came table which gave enough time pick drinks food   finished eating good 20 minutes before checked again   asked see dessert menu another 5 minutes before waiter came back told would pass dessert   Another 10 minutes before check     So yeah those three points turned into mini rants   Oops   If food good it'll take lot become unhappy establishment   But service last night seriously ruined dinner experience me   Would come back here?  Most likely not   But did enjoy those ahi tuna chips?  Oh heck yes   Two stars food  <EOR> I come Sedona quite bit while service nothing write home food very good quite reliable  never bad meal here! wine list while basic matches menu items quite well  Gambling decent music really good food    <EOR> To Sedona's Credit GM contacted via e mail rectify situation   promptly responded but heard since   assured would try establishment another time update review based visit   I sincerely hope email just ratings boost   Time tell        This really pains but can't give Sedona more 1 star!  see lot other decent reviews but simply wasn't experience here     After driving no less 100 times finally decided take advantage $19 99 Steak Lobster special   weakness previously never met Lobster didn't like!    Upon entering struck feeling attempted class   say attempted because walls really quite bare but decor cheap   lighting reduced furnishings more upscale side but something just doesn't feel right   walk bar primarily because wide open take seat prepare ask menu begin Vodka game   am immediately greeted bartender classy front black dress told If aren't gambling can't sit    Now call crazy but am more accustomed Hi today? or    God forbid place ATTEMPTING class Good evening Sir   you?    expectations obviously high    all place discount steak lobster   Being no stranger video poker machine only civil response could muster curt smile inserted money into machine ordered drink   bartender turns away notice once classy dress open back she freaking mural tattooed back   Nothing against tattoo's but FAIL!
