appetizer very good  boyfriend said he likes spaghetti better but loved it  veal chop entree which also split very good well    Overall don't think meal crazy expensive very much line price you'd pay any other strip restaurants  portions small yes but also respect gorging ourselves death   that's buffets for    I can't say would give restaurant 5 star rating opposed 4 star   but definitely willing back find out  Enjoy Cosmopolitan stunning inside enjoy restaurant views food great enjoy each other if you're romantic mood place!

Each course food presented different wine short explanation each   flavors described both before trying wine food should expect trying food   The entire meal lasted two hours each dish unique both presentation flavor   If anything we'd suggest maybe some sorbet between two courses cleansing maybe take just little bit more time   Five six we can't remember because even 3 oz serving wine  lot grape consume! courses bunch food even two hours lttile bit rushed   Waiter very nice buss service great   Lot's corporate types having dinner would seen management pay more attention guests somm never said hello although he paying tons attention apparient high roller next us   All in all would recommend place anyone listen also stay Cosmopolitan fantastic!

On real food    friend shared Lobster Pici Short Rib bone marrow agnolotti  pici dressed chili pesto sauce since friend can't eat spicy foods split portion served two separate plates  extra chili pesto side case wanted add more  loved didn't try split dish half ourselves  much more convenient straight down eating! However turns chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy all  If anything just salty REALLY salty  pieces lobster meat still tasted good wasn't salty but pasta sat directly pesto definitely could've used less sauce salt   Now short rib bone marrow agnolotti    last entree come out! All food came already agnolotti nowhere seen  sidetracked lobster pici kind forgot 2nd entree share  When realized asked server where if kitchen forgotten but he assured coming shortly  time came everyone done food  I'd say came 10 15 mins later other entrees  wasn't bad considering sharing another entree but shared would've sat without food  Considering fine dining restaurant unacceptable    But know delicious didn't care late  think become favorite pasta dish all time  flavor very rich smooth little crunchy texture garlic chips  personally liked better duck foie gras ravioli tried friend's plate  would order again again  Luckily there's also Scarpetta NY!

Also friends gotten pick pocketed night before  She asked waiter respectfully alternative forms ID understandably declined manager then claiming strict IDing individuals     but then did even ID when came time male friend we both females order drink  sure if he meant come off sexist but promise did quite rude mannerisms  However took high road didn't pull manager aside complain waiting staff instead gave waiter 40% tip  Promise won't back until aged least 10+ years because simply don't enjoy young individuals  <EOR> Wow restaurant amazing  Atmosphere chill great music playing  waitir sweet told great stories  wine fantastic OMG food world! Try farmers salad corn soup carrots!

sauces desserts  If wasn't upscale probably would licked plate asked gallon sauce  gelato perfect rich creamy texture complimented cake sauce instead taking over plate  textures taste cake alone reason come here    Everything Scarpetta excellent  Try table near windows catch views Bellagio Fountains while enjoy some best food Vegas  <EOR> As guest felt burden instead welcomed found foods  tried dimensional under seasoned flat dessert awful   Maybe just weren't working flow things yet maybe just off night don't know   The door wide open 5 25 walked hostess told reservation 5 30 leave come back few minutes   thought seemed odd but thought just because she very young figured all came back few minutes latter    Too start received white lint filled napkin top black pants but did notice black linen napkins use wine bottles    We felt uncomfortable whole time dining because most time saw eleven members staff standing across backs against wall just looking into direction   glared them few times but didn't budge    We started tuna susci described marinated vegetables preserved truffles everything raw everything little taste   We shared short rib agnolotti mini raviolis filled short rib baby food texture inside well made pasta  Maybe ten percent  agnolottis topped scant amount toasted  crumbs slightly laced horseradish flavor resting some browned butter   The black cod although cooked nicely would forgettable but only because concentrated tomato found interesting    dish extremely mild under seasoned few pieces fennel nicely caramelized    My husband duck breast he said least favorite he ever since skin wasn't crispy also lacked flavor he thought wasn't seasoned all    We little time kill before show thought maybe dessert might good   ordered zeppole don't mean mean disrespectful but honest God tasted just chocolate muffins Sweet Tomatoes salad bar buffet zeppole bread sweet almost chocolate flavored only few zeppole all essence nutella them     At price range don't much room error  <EOR> Lovely surprise   Randomly picked place take boss another colleague    Ordered Spaghetti tomato basil based server's recommendation  admit thought rather bold dude suggest spaghetti pasta try  But very good al dente handmade noodles right balance sweet acidity tomato basil sauce    Also field greens rather good even though wasn't listed menu  smear some kind nut butter candied walnut uber fresh greens light vinaigrette salad  <EOR> Very attentive staff gorgeous decor albeit bit dark quality food Braised short ribs spring vegetables farro rissoto Fall off bone tender perfectly seasoned enjoyed twist rissoto  Roasted sea scallops Cooked perfection briny rubbery very well white truffle asparagus overwhelmed rich truffle oil   Duck Foie Gras Ravioli Delicious but decadent taste  give huge portion 3 times amount actually expecting even entree  Filling good salty bite  Finishing death but very enjoyable self indulgent death   Spaghetti love when simple basic dishes just beautifully executed  just perfect spaghetti  would perfectly okay walking into restaurant ordering it  divine   Mediterranean Branzino Seafood party mouth  Branzino nice caramelized crust medley vegetables shrimp clams etc paired really well light broth   Aged Sirloin Beef cooked bloody medium rare excellence  Enjoyed salty nutty bite Parmagiano   As cocktails recommend Gimlet Gallardo  <EOR> What giant disappointment  saved Scarpetta final night Vegas because first choice new place try  won't ever return   We reservations 6 30  arrived 6 24  know because hostess pointed clock noted she would seat 6 minutes since reservation 6 30 pm  busy  no else waiting seated only two people sitting bar  ask twice check coat even though clearly marked coat check   At point just figured hostess inexperienced having rough day  Once seated promptly greeted placed cocktail orders  drinks took almost 20 minutes arrive  although could see fewer 20 people entire restaurant least 5 servers standing around chatting  rest night service remained scattered best  rushed through first course but flag down server order dessert    On top server constantly pushing upgrade telling most plates pretty minimal most people end having add them second round orders  example ordered fritto misto salad which runs $18  server warned should order second primi well  He wasn't kidding  two bites greens dusting lemon seasoning  short portions small even upscale trendy restaurant   This place saving grace tomato basil spaghetti  admit pretty picky Italian food lived Italy summer  understand rarely good States  Although good you'd Italy tomato basil spaghetti done well here  nice light sauce it's arrabbiata  pureed sauce pasta cooked perfectly al dente   I strawberry souffle dessert  adequate although fairly cool time table  coffee fine but server forgot extra shot Frangelico requested   On plus side really beautiful  If seat windows overlook Bellagio fountains unfortunately window seats also overlook Bellagio gardening sheds dumpsters   so don't look down!   Overall decor fits well contemporary vibe Cosmo  urban beautifully designed hip  fresh upscale open without being fussy stuffy   As beautiful great pasta plate  won't back  <EOR> The view ambience says all   The impeccable service exceed expectations nice memorable romantic dinner absolutely best   The dessert menu definitely gives amusingly delightful smile initial final bite soothing silky smoothness caramel sea salt dreamy pudding  Then pastry chef's delectable dessert night    Absurdly decadent   This establishment must revisit type place  <EOR> My favorite restaurant Vegas dear friend treated farewell meal  Even though leaving Vegas when visit always return here  7th time always try something new  time pasta octopus bone marrow topped very delicious bread crumbs! name dish Gargnelli something regardless exquisite! friend shared polenta because even if come 100 times MUST polenta fricasse mushrooms!  top 5 list sure but tonight something spot must admit but still enjoyed it  If cocktails San Remo bomb  learned them home because enjoy much!

Secondo carne   meats   Pasta cooked perfect al dente but lacking little salt  Servers very attentive but think 3 4 different people ask if everything ok including man suit   bit much but if just want sure ok then am fine haha  My mother law myself ordered vegetable Tagliatelle perfect minus salt   My father law pici but disappointed he said no taste  Husband duck foie gras very happy tasty but hard digest    We ordered 3 contorni mushrooms zero taste  Creamer potatoes best thing all contorni but  sad cause end just potatoes  last Broccolini  No taste little raw   For celebrity chef owning restaurant he could kick notch contorni  <EOR> Honestly wasn't expecting great food swanky restaurant Las Vegas strip    but wrong  Scarpetta offers wonderful Italian food reasonable prices quality service   Their bread die for    Seriously could eat loaf gooey spinach bread butter  also loved rosemary foccacia   We enjoyed tuna appetizer filet signature spaghetti dish everything perfectly executed delicious   The bombino sp? dessert great way end meal   Honestly zero complaints just really wonderful dinner   Highly recommended! <EOR> Great service well thought menu flavored  pasta perfectly made  favorite uni crab squid ink pasta  <EOR> In short food five stars service three stars    I can't say enough food! loved it! Unfortunately really bad service  two guys waiting us  don't know if main waiter busy training but obvious second guy more junior  He trying avoid saying 'I don't know'  example asked parts lamb three ways dish  told chops short rib other part can't remember right now  chops made sense  When commented short rib usually beef he agreed  said 'the lamb three way includes beef which don't eat ?'  He said yes  sounded weird asked first waiter completely different answer  dish included chops shoulder third type maybe shank something  Ultimately decided against lamb can't tell really it    For appetizers yellowtail  three believe portion came five pieces  Instead giving extra piece round gave three pieces kept two kitchen  seemed odd questioned it  junior waiter apologized said kitchen staff new  knows!!  The yellowtail good additional serving came kitchen    We knew try pasta dish all handmade Scott Conant does Italian food well  few dietary restrictions table ordered tagliatelle  told came short rib but could brought side since didn't eat beef  pasta arrived delicious!!!! told kitchen figuring short rib us  Guess what? never arrived! wasn't surprised given everything else going  fact knew being duped minute waiter said it  pasta good its own didn't miss bring but another problem service    For entrees two halibut amazing! husband two beef dishes  waiters disagreed which liked best patrons but weren't any problems dishes coming incomplete    For dessert bomboloni  Oooh divine!  So again food top notch  thing did like  hoping service only off night went  weren't put off it  actually laughing everything happened  must try restaurant books  <EOR> Great Italian food here  warn others portion very small!!! steak friend pasta ravioli  planning share but steak literally 5 pieces cut ravioli 5 pieces  both 5 bites total  food good  But why small?? <EOR> This review 4 5 stars   Some best pasta ever eaten   tell freshly prepared much better any other pasta you've ever had   service strong maybe little intrusive times but overall very good     We polenta mushrooms appetizer spaghetti duck ravioli   bread bowl begin just your typical bread   sure why such great reviews but pretty average albeit perfect dipping utensils appetizer   polenta great started cream mushroom taste   spaghetti best spaghetti ever but still very plain   ravioli wonderful   little chewy inside freshly made pasta   actually quite filling which very surprising considering ravioli usually small dish only 5 6 large pieces   dish came 20 medium sized   recommend dish anyone     They extensive wine menu specializing Italy but all over world   your better Italian restaurants strip   European feel New York feel if type cuisine you're then give try   run least $30 entree $15 20 appetizers $15 single drink   tip reservation try view Bellagio fountains  <EOR> Great atmosphere great service great food   could ask more?

I saw famous Scarpetta spaghetti Food Network's The Best Thing Ever Ate since episode obsessed going Scarpetta  excited opened Beverly Hills last October! However busy drive there    I Vegas 1 night April 1st while wandering around Cosmpolitan Hotel saw Scarpetta! Super excited! Made reservations 8PM  Arrived time seated promptly  Then waited waited waited! Really 10 minutes before waitress even came table and empty seats all around time ! Mind 10PM show kept looking time    She took drink order then returned 15 minutes later drinks!!! almost 8 30 even placed order  She says she'll right back another 10 minutes     Ahh if weren't spaghetti would walked out! 35 minutes arrived she takes order    Spaghetti braised short ribs beef husband  OMG   food arrived table 9 30! Ate fast because tickets show 10   BTW food amazing!!!!   Had ask another waiter find waitress check  She came back table 9 50 without check course explained again 10PM show which ended being late for needed there!   So food good thought woud but service or lack of ruined first Scarpetta experience <EOR> Is bad if restaurant Vegas you've elsewhere? don't care  sister incredible dinner  service fantastic  seated next window watch fountains entire night contrary might expect did bored watching them over over again   started polenta w mushrooms because love yellowtail which delicious super fresh scallops which awesome  sister infamous spaghetti which she loved and did   dish control called black macaroni if could eat all time would  squid ink pasta not macaroni lobster BASIL BREAD CRUMBS  cannot describe perfect dish obsessed now am basil bread crumbs  Truly amazing  zeppole dessert  *Love* truly excellent wonderful wasn't expecting level awesome  need nyc now trifecta  <EOR> great spot Cosmopolitan   Maybe best Italian strip   black cod which would again   Pasta also outstanding   Cool dark space  view Bellagio fountains   Good spot couples  <EOR> Food good  party 10 really cool room view Bellagio fountain   Wine list wasn't very good typically order sub $100 bottles  Except few most least $100+   disappointing    Had good time  Service great  Food good  $110 bottle wine recommended sommelier not  <EOR> This place ridiculously pricey is  menu small simple every dish feels somewhat unjustified  tried spaghetti which super plain literally just noodles light tomato sauce some basil  Granted well made noodles cooked perfectly al dente  But seriously   I don't think anyone should pay close $20 mere plate noodles especially doesn't even protein  also tried short rib dish attempt some protein but portion size laughable short ribs weren't even good  much better short ribs other New American restaurants before  staying Cosmo definitely would gone elsewhere Italian fix instead considering expensive just whatevers place is  yourself favor skip it! <EOR> The last time dinner girls wreck  did receive proper service being dolled dinner was  food heavily overpriced quality was   foie gras pretty mediocre bit salty  side dish spinach very salty    sure come back another girl's dinner next time vegas  <EOR> I must say looking forward visiting favorites chefs restaurants Las Vegas  thoroughly disappointed pasta preparation Scarpetta  pasta actually crunchy al dente Mr  Conant  wife enjoyed lamb ravioli but agreed pasta undercooked   Talk your chefs  <EOR> The service VERY slow   potato chips great     The food OK but nothing memorable   My wife halibut which overcooked   short rib pasta OK   We DID love eggplant dipping sauce bread   great!

It's expensive but Vegas general expensive   If you're looking great meal but don't mind spending $$$ then should check place out   While menu isn't extremely extensive think little something everyone  <EOR> Tried Scarpetta NYC easy 5stars  Vegas version great location Cosmo but food service didn't quite knock socks off genuine article  Try fritto misto spaghetti tomato basil great taste Italy but if want experience Scarpetta really deliver NYC!! Definitely worth shot if you're rich hungry Italian lol   <EOR> Leave superficial snooty attitude door because Scarpetta everything but that  You'd think you'd dealing staff think better things tend your every whim but just opposite  little disappointed didn't table looking Bellagio's fountains but somewhat consolation prize sat along windowed wine cellar    Everyone rants raves bread basket  tell right now none exaggerated  wonderful medley bread but takes cake stromboli bread  Packed meat cheese could easily fill them  Fight kids  Fight feeling! Eat just wait your main entree come out   The roasted sea scallop largest scallops ever encountered  Plump juicy flavorful  served steamed cauliflower splash creamed cauliflower sauce  Both scallop cauliflower complimented each other perfectly  kind irked menu described appetizer Roasted Sea Scallops  When see word scallops assume more one  Breaking news  only one  big nonetheless but remember only one   Scott Conant's twist spaghetti may seem simplistic first glance but once taste tell lot more behind scenes  Unfortunately opinion dish fell short  noodles well undercooked  noodles undercooked but every bite could taste rawness noodles middle  cheese garlic olive oil already infused pasta but overly cheesy  thought took away tomato basil flavor  did enjoy bit spiciness get  gave spaghetti some life    Overall service nothing short elegance but food exception bread basket painfully average  <EOR> *** Review Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***  Another restaurant wanted try now marked off list   Restaurant Week menu somewhat limited selections but very good   I seated next window overlooking Bellagio fountains which added good atmosphere restaurant   brought menus iced tea   ask Restaurant Week menu brought   already made choice online menu but sometimes things change wanted sure   I brought nice bread basket sourdough three other breads   Accompanying trio bread toppers dippers  mascarpone butter caponata citrus infused olive oil   All three good but could eaten plate caponata!  mild citrus flavor olive oil made second choice   For starter ordered creamy polenta fricassee truffled mushrooms   polenta brought white dish server then spooned onion wild mushroom mixture over polenta   dish excellent   almost took some bread wipe any leftover polenta   For main course fennel dusted black cod bed concentrated tomatoes roasted fennel   fish cooker perfectly moist soft but crisp crust   crust mild anise flavor fennel   tomatoes beneath concentrated baking until some water rendered which gave tomato prominent flavor   roasted fennel tasty   For dessert no choice but didn't matter   bomboloni wonderful way end good meal   bomboloni consisted two filled Nutella ganache filled vanilla cream   Alongside small scoop banana ice cream resting crushed chocolate shortbread pieces   Excellent!  Service good most part   Two small things  when your posted opening time 6 PM open 6   Seating people almost 10 minutes late best form especially if someone show need to   Also two Sweet 'n Low wrappers table neither runner nor server cleared even though both several times    something wouldn't expect restaurant class   sure Chef Conant would point if he dining there   wish didn't ask Restaurant Week menu   sheet paper   Bring your large books wine dinner menus  <EOR> Possibly BEST restaurant vegas!!!

Food great! Staff excellent   Very close Scarpetta NYC  <EOR> 3 1 2 stars  Came 1 year wedding anniversary booked weeks advance  greeted door congratulated host which very nice    We then escorted worst table house wobbly 4 top table between 4 large parties business men where couldn't hear each other talk  also given nasty looks when asked booth away crowd seating    The food overall 4 stars  spaghetti lobster picci cooked al dente enjoyable perfect portions  added meatballs $8 tiny bits over over cooked tougher beef recommended skipping those    Drinks average price white table cloth dining made very stiff  No disappointment here    Dessert options looked great opted bomboloni's seeing other Yelp reviews  just ok   Even fried doughnuts barely any filling inside which ended making both sick later evening    Overall give place 3 5 4 stars  Worth try if want fine dining Italian food when Vegas but nothing exciting certainly must visit venue  tried don't feel need return  <EOR> So yummy!  burrata short rib pasta husband ordered huge rib eye special  could've eaten 3 meals! hubby called quits waiter told good effort  Overall great experience  Wish gelato desserts! <EOR> Wow       just wow  can't believe all years coming Vegas missed place sexually pretentious yummy Scarpetta    Cosmopolitan Hotel known place see seen Scarpetta fits bill place eat sexy while looking sexy  all key restaurants Cosmo don't consider anyone them above 4 star rating giving them 4 stars means among best hotel offers    You absolutely MUST try tomato basil spaghetti  Cooked al dente perfection simply amazed able find anywhere  If you're foie gras fan few places town does beyond right including foie gras ravioli  branzino perfection   But beyond dishes wasn't overly impressed  Everything else seemed decent but nothing amazing point worthy mention   Dessert excellent though definitely don't want miss if sweet tooth  highly recommend panna cotta    Atmosphere where deduct star  bit pretentious dark me  almost took step back time freak sex club 70s  Think Studio 54 reincarnated Italian restaurant you've found Scarpetta  annoying level pretentiousness only way I'd come back if return group people  <EOR> Came Wednesday evening May 9 2012   Catching writing reviews wish could forgotten terrible experience already   Our party 4 approached hostess politely asked table   She looks up    no smile   We're told wait 15 minutes reply problem asking if ok sit many empty seats booths across bar near entrance   She pauses before answering ok and only later sense response bit cold    However still high spirits having arrived Vegas evening extended weekend friends partying   we're led into dining room marvel coziness   room quite small seemed 3 rows tables window seats overlooking Bellagio fountains   more intimate expected immediately filed memory good place bring date   We're led circular chic booth hindsight almost diner like feel it    but upscale setting something actually enjoyed could eat family style   We chosen dine because Arvin T heard amazing spaghetti   But let's continue chronologically   bread basket came amazing   stromboli tasty though no expert ended asking them second basket   waiter slow bringing second basket definitely felt committed taboo    but didn't stop reminding bring us   I'd down play play each items menu but honest wasn't very impressive   really hoped food good could look past mediocre service which bordered indifferent   But alas cannot said   I would still recommend place bring your date nice intimate dinner   dim yellow lighting exuded warmth only wished completed quality service come expect Cosmo     If service isn't important esp relation money spent then would still suggest giving place sometime   However think Vegas place escape sanctuary away hustles life   Scarpetta let down only first punch stomach Cosmo night  <EOR> Had fantastic dinner Scarpetta Thursday night   I'd reservations 4 previous occasions cancel reason another every time   Finally getting try joint   seated immediately upon arrival   restaurant larger expecting if wasn't full very close   Lively atmosphere almost loud but quite   wouldn't say would good romantic evening but great night friends   Our server immediately approached presented impressive wine list   may best seen Strip but well above average   prices typical restaurant located higher end hotel Strip might some sticker shock   barolo which fantastic   Service great throughout evening no complaints all   In addition wine list brought bread basket   various types bread but stood bacon cheese   tastes good sounds   might try steal some next time eat sandwich next day great   To start table 4 split 2 pastas short rib agnolotti ricotta cavatelli wild boar ragu arugula   waiter advised small dishes 2 orders agnolotti   Very glad did amount received perfect starter but splitting dishes among 4 would stretch   Both pastas cooked perfect al dente   Some best pasta had   short rib very tender flavorful pasta filling ratio great   Likewise wild boar ragu incredible   Rich very deep flavors seasoned perfectly   would able just eat ton spoon fantastic   I'd even eat cold     To eat special evening veal osso bucco risotto   veal shank large fork tender   Full disclosure buddy mine ordered dish well fork tender   saw use knife more occasion throughout meal   Mine however fantastic   meat moist melted your mouth   best osso bucco honor still mighty Ferraro's but dish me   risotto cooked well but bit much citrus me   But liked dish enough keep Scarpetta 5 stars   This place isn't cheap but find LOT higher prices Strip food won't worth additional cost   great deal anticipation eating Scarpetta let down   found new Italian place rotation next time town  <EOR> On food alone Scarpetta probably four star restaurant  But spectacular space occupies Cosmopolitan Hotel overlooking Bellagio fountains gets five star nod me    The perfect ambience hard ignore  Unbelievably swanky Scarpetta just oozes Vegas  Dimly lit white linens dark wood interesting light fixtures mix create very upscale atmosphere    Food wise enjoyed two appetizers pea soup sea scallops  soup excelled where other dishes didn't pea flavor wasn't showed cream  other appetizer made 'entree' found scallops cooked near perfectly but them suffered much char rather nice caramelization  also gratuitous use garnishes radish micro greens apples more  Less would've more when scallops served truffles white asparagus    The dishes friends all received same comment heavy  While its summer seeing words 'summer truffles' multiple dishes never bad thing all those dishes all felt heavy butter and or cream    I would remiss if didn't cap review mention bread  Served dishes containing citrus infused olive oil cold eggplant spread mascarpone butter bread itself world good though also heavy laced thin slice salami cheese     I can't say Scarpetta experience didn't live hype  However much Vegas sliver feeling food itself didn't quite live glitz glamor restaurant itself  <EOR> I've Scarpetta Beverly Hills enjoyed food delighted see another location Cosmopolitan  couldn't find any other review mentioning take orders Yelp they're listed offering take out  kids group really wanted pasta though thought I'd call see if perhaps information Yelp incorrect  fact accept take orders  lady answered call informed she could take order over phone could come order bar    Ordering easy found staff welcoming knowledgeable  Scarpetta known spaghetti however regular spaghetti sauce does dairy noodles egg  removed cheese subbed gluten free noodles accommodate kids' allergies  myself duck foie gras ravioli  All orders delicious definitely comprised quality ingredients  took 10 minute wait order   I'm glad offer take because only restaurant Cosmopolitan readily noted offered gluten free options  past experience Scarpetta know restaurant itself isn't meant kids  Therefore appreciate could still enjoy great food hotel room avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences  Only caveat serving sizes smaller side arguably really surprise fine dining  thirteen year old inhaled serving spaghetti two year old easily finished half sitting  <EOR> Better second time basic service very slow happy but job done  complimentary bread pretty good free bread  best part eggplant tapenade side butter  Beet goat cheese super cream goat cheese perfect roasted beets  incredible  avocado tuna sashimi most fibrous mushy low quality flavorless tuna  uni pasta sweet salty chewy delicious brussels halved roasted brussels mushy tasted overcooked  better cut andreas mushrooms yum shortrib agnolotti im pine nut person could really taste nuts much beef  meh just ok me  pici thick spaghetti lobster spicy pretty good  second favorite would again  chocolate cake 2 5 stars sub par mediocre chocolate cake marscapone cheesecake 3 stars very standard circular shaped cheesecake fruit mixed hink prefer cheesecake factory  <EOR> Had high hopes Scarpetta since highly rated Yelp  made reservations many weeks advance nice window seat great view Bellagio fountains  awesome   Service overall decent  bread basket awesome  huge fan pastries usually but finished all bread basket  good   Creamy polenta truffled mushrooms amazing! ordered 1 portion share preemptively split order us  Cool   Truffled burrata roasted tomatoes salsa verde sauce daily special super delicious  must order!   Foie gras duck ravioli way rich  ate couple mouthful Uni pasta Again way rich  split order couldnt even finish half portion! I'm sure why but both pasta entrees just rich totally killed experience wish waiter warned more advance <EOR> I really looking forward trying upscale Italian restaurant but unfortunately disappointed meal  group read reviews prior wanted try duck foie gras ravioli seeing many pictures positive opinions  Since 4 5 ordered ravioli assumed cooked big batch maybe missed seasoning step because each person though tasted bland  Thankfully server took each dish off bill because nobody ate more few bites  did try spaghetti really good  kicking myself getting something different but maybe give place another chance  <EOR> Scarpetta Scott Conant's restaurants  He basically does everything right one  food service amazing view Bellagio fountains wasn't half bad either  homemade pasta's top notch  spaghetti  simple yet done perfectly   ultimate test kitchen passed flying colors  many restaurants try Vegas still going back place next time there  <EOR> This place awesome! Friendly staffs amazing foods nice view Bellagio water shows huge selection wines! place perfect date business meeting just stopping family! <EOR> Tasty food fabulous service  I spaghetti which pretty bomb being just spaghetti  also tried someone else's steak amazing    need return very own   Dessert yum!!

 portion less filling order something else if hungry appetite   As drinks   good pretty strong but comes but decent price tag  Most $16  <EOR> I'm sure if want give 2 stars 3  might fair place isn't equal some 2 star reviews it's probably better most but high price tag    I think justified  best part experience $20 a glass wine  $$ amount expected any nice place Vegas happy wine least very good price as aren't always   Service slow took almost twenty minutes between being greeted waiter come back drinks then same wait drinks food food check  tight schedule being work trip little inconvenient  wasn't even busy yet either  food split Tagliatelle which felt lacked truffle flavor signature spaghetti dish which felt lacked overall flavor should signature dish  general food bad any way just thought very expensive lack great service  Generally bad experience might willing give another shot when back town  <EOR> The happy hour awesome 5 30 7pm  $7 apps drinks bar!
