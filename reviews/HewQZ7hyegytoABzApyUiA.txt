Sunday night 6 08 place looks pog pen  Floors mess salsa bar messy missing items  Took forever receive order  return shameful! <EOR> Friendly staff took pre opening order quickly  Even though new fast casual  liked enthusiasm  suggested order side churros yes please!

Luis exceptional service  Chicken well sides very tasty satisfying  chicken tenders meal mac n cheese cole slaw    very good! highly recommend location! <EOR> If could give zero star rating would  three times now ever since they've opened each time gets worse worse   Each time wait more 10 minutes before someone finally comes takes order  Mind place every time gone never busy always only waiting line   Sometimes middle order they'll just turn around start talking cook  basically trying say absolute WORST customer service  Not mention many times they've given overcooked chicken  sitting long  overcooked hot pretty much just chicken jerky point  Each time called they'd tell just gotten off grill freshly hot  plenty other El Pollo locations know when chicken freshly cooked  When bring chicken back show them just say oh   yeah  overcooked  No shit its overcooked!  Three times now  tried giving them benefit doubt but never again back there  <EOR> First time pollo loco  wish more Texas  Nice 5 dollar deal chips drink  Self serve drinks salsa bar  <EOR> Rudest drive thru employees Mary think name zero customer service personality  She seems she's annoyed entire time  now second time location both times didn't tortilla soup wanted  response stopped serving tonight when window asked time stop serving rudely she replies when run shut window  location needs hire some friendlier people  Until then won't back  rather drive farther better service  <EOR> so just food looks old dried fries taste nasty  dont new chicken fingers <EOR> Pretty new clean always busy  Fast service just put wet floor signs when see puddles around place  <EOR> I'm sincerely disappointed location  regular guest location time time given them chances together right  no exaggeration almost every time missed something order soda churros salsas tortillas etc keep mind all different times visited location  Today cherry top! asked female took order question taco she rudely responses asked repeat self she did same tone  responded  all wanted drove window  Once window she doesn't greet takes card gives no receipt top off she doesn't gives even asks if wanted salsas! believe second chances but several countless times screw ups it  If guys business losing money losing clients then your right sure! guys lost loyal customer  <EOR> Super nice employee good Mexican fast food  didn't dressing asked but clearly just oversight  <EOR>
