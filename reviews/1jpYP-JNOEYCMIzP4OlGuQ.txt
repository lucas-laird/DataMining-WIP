The owner awesome   When he everything runs clockwork food tastes better sauces tables bussed more promptly   Here drawbacks why place doesn't extra star The tables often bussed promptly which sitting inside somewhat appealing being surrounded many dirty tables   The sauces consumption maybe half time   The lemonade flavor drink machine half time could half way through meal before fixed   Usually when boss he brings directly table   When boss employees tend rush food assembling process and or listening repeat myself several times ask things decided offer like having grilled veggies meat selection    I also gotten slopplily assembled bowls employees setting bowl down other food before handing just dumping wet contents beans haphazardly spilled off side    Visual important when comes food   On occasion chicken didn't seem cooked quite enough   Again boss there   The north door rarely open people park side   Yet leave just fine door   would nice if placed sign door if order  <EOR> Owner openly annoyed first timers understanding menu he didn't mind letting know    When BIL asked meats hot bar he snapped gonna give recipes!

I only salsa topping tried three different  free  salsas had  pineapple tomato onion salsa overpowering couldn't taste meat them tacos  corn good  would great anything else just meat  Leaves questioning if should left them out   My biggest complaint food sides  rice beans side TERRIBLE   The beans straight can  don't know if own black beans but taste any black beans dump can  The rice while tell made in house worse  some kind white wild rice some shell still some seaweed spice  would great if boiled steam loosely if rice wasn't made Japanese sticky rice style  making sticky rice turns just globs messy weird rice  Japanese sticky rice great rice tastes clean pure hard explain   But rice tastes dirty just unappetizing   AVOID these  Several other customers me  more experienced  didn't touch them reason   I give mad props having apple juice fountain drinks   something never seen before love apple juice! They two side sauces which taste concentrated artificial juice drinks some hot sauce them  While good just doesn't sit right me   The service meh   You're served counter  Subway style  which means meat all sides sitting entire time pre cooked all  Then service ends there  your own drinks leave your plates table  price would paid  if coupon had  would pretty bad   MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT Price  can't see spending $10 25 got  Three OK tacos terrible rice beans fountain drink little no service $10  just don't see it  dine price much better more food elsewhere  just Hawaiian style  $5 $10 coupon Yelp made worth satisfied  just moved enough pay $10 everything    Come if you've groupons Yelp coupon if really want try place  Otherwise don't see value it  <EOR> Stopped late lunch  Amazingly delicious food always  kids Kalua pork tacos Kalua pork burrito bowl seaweed rice extra helping guacamole husband Huli Huli chicken burrito  Fresh filling delicious always  course box coconut bark  Best fast casual Vegas  Love Hawaiian take tacos burritos  many times but felt leaving another review  Met owner Chris today  Super friendly glad came enjoyed meal  Chatted while  Love Aloha spirit Braddahs! back soon! <EOR> Super onolicious semi local kine grindz!

The remaining three steps traditional topping overload rice beans veggies etc  but highlight charred pineapple verde  few other salsa choices mango roasted corn tomato w grilled Maui onion maybe round #2 but again party pleaser  don't quite know exactly but sweetness pineapple light hint char worked very well mixing all taco  Another must try sure!  Although wasn't consumed until following day want bring honorable mention coconut bark left both howling moon  the bark itself soft flaky but throw some silky butterscotch layers top you'll saying aloha no time  glad cashier lead vs  regular bark took meal all time level!

Overall nice spot would again  <EOR> I just say if Braddah's closer home SoCal we'd frequent customers  set taken right Chipotle playbook why great formula! made sure sample meats available especially since guys sensitive spices  Huz oldest son such difficult time deciding between Kahlua pig chicken ahead just mix burrito! chose chicken salad base asked counter server suggestions toppings  She friendly salad looked amazing tasted just well  9 year old stuck simple chicken burrito beans rice   said set much beloved franchise but flare its own  felt dining among locals  added bonus part eScrip program you must register your credit card dining help raise bit money school your choice yay boys' school!

Anyhow I'd quick comment service   first time serve tacos burritos bowls Chipotle Subway style   really good invites patron ask lot questions   However male serving staff helped greatest   guy explaining different types meat wasn't very enthusiastic any them   know serve fish well because Yelp reviews but he didn't ask if option I'd try     The food self tasty inventive   Huli Huli Chicken Kalua Pig Puleha Steak tacos Mango Roasted Corn Salsa flour tortillas   Kalua Pig taco being favorite!  However kept things looked familiar Mango Roasted Corn Salsa   wasn't ecstatic meal but just good   really held down reputation Coconut Bark desert   really hard explain   But friends hated coconut shavings     and loved it!  So suggestion place staff more suggestive   Honestly food pretty good but kinda tasted Chipotle   fault trying something different but staff also wasn't helpful   really need staff put right direction when trying something new inventive   hope try place more time but usually first visit most impression decision again  <EOR> Went based rave reviews Yelp   first times Yelp led astray sad   First let say staff incredibly friendly helpful   way your experience good   Upon walking asked if first time then promptly given samples all meats   immediately noticed low quality fatty meat was   chicken steak though flavored nicely incredibly gristly fatty   kalua pork cooked well but bit salty side me   steak burrito mild salsa which just ended being way sweet because sweetness steak fact mild salsa basically limes pineapple my fault guess ordering it    wife ordered chicken bowl which decent but great   also side chips salsa which regret immensely   chips stale tasted came bag   salsa again sweet   total bill came $20 without drinks a bit pricey IMO    The dining experience general basically Hawaiian themed Chipotle  case you're wondering overly sweetened Hawaiian topped cheese guacamole sour cream sugary salsa good combination   food just really isn't good   only much better food general based recommendations Yelp much better Hawaiian food Las Vegas   honestly don't know people rating anything above 3 stars  <EOR> Great food  Very nice idea fast food good good restaurant  <EOR> Came lunch today place easy access employees very friendly food great    I really recommend getting extra sauces green amazing! boyfriend really liked beef really enjoyed fish   Yet really blew away customer service! manager owner idk very polite made sure 100% satisfied  He even brought huge water bowl dogs which really appreciated because little gestures long way    We definitely becoming again!! <EOR> Very boring very Hawaiian opinion  service super slow but friendly  3 fish tacos best part very little amount fish got    There child seating area yelling mom whole time there  <EOR> In Vegas honeymoon looking something quick cheap tasty place hits all three! husband really enjoyed good food great price  highly recommend place <EOR> Very similar chipotle but Hawaiian theme tastes!

Hawaiian Chipotle   Bowls tacos burritos salads pack serious aloha punch your tasty buds   meat vegetarian choices include huli huli chicken kalua pig pulehu steak grilled fish veggies   personal favorite grilled fish which packed full flavor despite nondescript name   Now where gets interesting choose yummy salsas top your creation   current salsa list includes charred pineapple verde mild mango roasted corn med tomato grilled maui onions spicy    favorite tomato onions salsa however wouldn't call spicy long shot   All other standard toppings available such cheese sour cream lettuce beans etc   also offer jalapenos which nice surprise!  My only complaint rice quite dense heavy   wish offered choice something fluffier   If you're full must grab some coconut bark dessert   Screw even if full just grab some later   warned friends stuff more addictive crack!  Braddah's often runs Groupon and or yelp deals check both before save few bucks  <EOR> I love bowls! always fish always consistent delicious  coconut bark world really gives hard time sticking diet! think even woke craving coconut bark almost made trip if open would 100% lol There's really upbeat fun guy think he's owner idk but he always day positive attitude    except today when he completely order wrong home surprise kinda sucked lot bc  really picky don't sweet savory food he gave sauce didn't ate meal kind plain without sauce like but people mistakes first time they've made mistake even considering rating    Anyways staff always nice really nice radiate positive vibe every time go! Plus drive thru service super fast! <EOR> Went Braddah's 2nd time week officially say hooked already    determined mention Hawaiian Chipotle fear being passé but really turns best way describe it    actually think should just fully played fact incorporating Chipotle into name restaurant something    Hau'olipotle!   ChipotLEI!    all week   On first visit gameplan order tacos could sample all main meats Chicken Pig Steak even though awesomely asked if wanted try any all meats prior ordering stuck plan ordered tacos   you've read other reviews just Chipotle Zabas where start taco burrito bowl salad decision then choose meats accompaniments it   top meats tried seaweed rice corn salsa tomato salsa some jalapenos   also standard items cheese sour cream guac     choice crunchy corn soft flour tortillas crunchy corn    meats pig stood far    steak chicken both seemed bit sweet teriyaki flavor which generally fan of    tasted fine but pig juicy flavorful craving since day    seaweed rice didn't really taste much different regular rice but maybe because tacos wasnt much it   Most all other fixins standard which bad thing but leaves very little write about   Pro tip jalapenos fresh extremely spicy    already witnessed them leave coworker literal tears    warned      To close first visit tried some much heralded coconut bark    probably ill advised lactose intolerance but add credence review felt necessary    You're welcome    good everyone says is    much know when you're situation few people sharing several pieces something gets last piece there's tug war  no insist!     ended tug war no uttered friend    delicious made greedy jerk    Highly recommended  The 2nd visit all pig burrito most same fixins previously   didn't really feel burrito made all well honest especially when asked all 3 salsas them separated into thirds burrito gentleman making it    almost funny even correct    people world eat burritos that?   wanted all them melding together throughout but instead salsa taste test    Also burrito just seemed really short stubby kinda felt skimped little meat whereas friend's burrito last time looked completely stuffed    still incredibly delicious can't really expect every cog assembly line consistent early stages   I easily see being upgraded 5 stars once does    meantime don't bother trying trademark ChipotLEI already lawyers it  <EOR> We braddahs would say very good  place compared chipotle grill  choose burrito bowl salad  tried bowl everything grilled fish  say portion fish only 2 ounces so  meat wife chose steak she plenty it  size bowl nice options toppings more chipotle option fresh cut habanero bean sprouts pineapple blend   We ended meal piece coconut log which caramel toffee chocolate slabs topped coconut  stuff candy version crack   seriously amazing worth trip alone   I give three star only because fish portion very small  prices sort when add Guac generally speaking base food which order besides Coconut Bark generic Las Vegas area thousands Mexican food restaurants  <EOR> The best town!! Everything great  complaint  pork yum The chicken bomb  The fish delicious!! Yum da tum <EOR> So anything sounds Hawaiian must try especially Vegas   I heard going open but didn't know when today when drove way work noticed sign knew try it    The drive through functioning yet inside  first time might good menu isn't big nor complicated but gotta know your choices seeing whole board helps    First pick put type burrito bowl salad taco  Choose your meat add 'filler' rice beans cabbage etc      Next add salas finally add all other condiments guacamole sour cream  Oh yah top off saald dressing too!  I salad huli huli chicken small bite size grilled slightly crispy outside chicken bed romaine lettuce add spicy tomato grilled Maui onion don't worry spicy all buy savory added sour cream guacamole hawaiian pink salt roasted sesame gingerette tasted sesame but ginger much    It really good enjoyed difinitly back try more! Friendly staff excellent service good flavors! <EOR> Service alone 5 star!! Similar chipotle except Huli Huli chicken pulehu steak options etc  fresh salsas yummy! back! <EOR> Love love love Braddah's  feel whenever suggest location always tell friends  better version Chipotle if imagine  usually bowl seaweed rice fish basically all other toppings   My only problem location every time visited they've always run something  first time different kinds meats toppings and did want wait 20 minutes them ready just without  last time visited soda machine working   but cashier still sold small drink  Luckily another employee kind enough suggest giving bottled drink which worked well    I feel location down pat food but definitely room improvement preparedness wise  <EOR> Hawaiian version Chipotle? Sure     But good  Maybe something going night? didn't even end finishing bowl NEVER that  Usually if don't enjoy something still trudge way through eating because quite frankly bad    Usually    I ordered chicken bowl all fixings  chicken dry rice tasted its sitting all day everything just strange taste it  said maybe bad time    But unfortunately tempted back try again    The coconut bar pretty good though  <EOR> This place Chipotle  But without crappy corporate political stances more local business atmosphere  employees recognize usually know order soon walk in  owner manager greet even when bump into each other elsewhere bank super market  going years sick food yet  probably much healthier anything else quickly   Do sign Perka program  dl phone app scan every receipt into earn points  Points used towards free drinks free coconut bark free meal   <EOR> This place amazing! first time because am job Vegas firms team if its your first time personally bring bowl all three meats try  pulehu steak favorite! place Hawaiian chipotle   even thwir own made salsas sauces  Brilliant  enjoyed favorite hawaiian sun <EOR> Stopped thru lunch n copped 3 pork tacos! Man flavor point fresh n juicy w jalapeños n MAXX step 4 if u u know brown rice n beans way go! Order system down but main man window made sure everything straight point! Thanks!! coming back next time chicken fish Braddah!! Check spot only winning no losses  Huli Huli next!! Sorry pics could wait all left!! Haha    <EOR> I discovered little place two weeks ago already back few times   tell why Kalua Pork Nachos   I discovered tasty meat Kauai some years back found comparable since except hear   generous meat   very pleased flavor cheese guacamole   all very flavorful   The place nice clean people very friendly   let try few samples very much taking care customer   surprises whenever place empty   Maybe coming off time knows?  But think food service worth visiting for   already become mildly addicted nachos   Like said new Braddah's but sold nice service food   If haven't worth hunting down try out  <EOR> Mmmm everything place amazing!  food atmosphere service!  love idea mixing Hawaii locals favorites Mexican twist   far tried kalua pig pulled pork huli huli chicken bowls gotta bowls!    Both great quality them kalua pig perfect texture wet but still very juicy flavorful   huli huli favorite   chicken doesn't thick layer fat lots places keep all juicy meat   All veggies used fresh which break dishes these   Now coconut bark mmm    sort soft brittle chocolate coconut   Try it!! The staff really aloha spirit ALL customers just ones islands   also let sample meats case you've never them before!  totally recommend place! <EOR> I highly recommend  cheap good  Friendly staff   bark amazing   Ask sample try yourself    pork very good gives little taste Hawaii  <EOR> Island style Chipotle accurate description place   but perhaps little less organization compared its corporate counterpart   Okay ended ordering quesadilla kahlua pork asked adult size version it   correct them twice would meat when ordering   When arrived table tad bit greasy meat all smushed side evenly spread out   Also exterior soggy due being cooked wrapped foil   I quesadillas nice crunch exterior   flavor kahlua good but also failed give any fixings sour cream guac accompany quesadilla   fiance ordered 3 taco combo must say looked more delicious order   He tried huli huli chicken mahi mahi kahlua pig tacos overflowing guac sour cream salsa   line waiting order heard lady behind say loudly kinda stingy meat eh  turned see she ordering put two smallest pieces fish ever seen rice bowl    eek!  If looking value tacos instead rice bowl   because she right stingy!  coconut chocolate bark just okay mind but big sweets person SWEET! Overall I'd give them another try since samples other meats delicious   probably wouldn't order quesadilla again probably won't order rice bowl unless feel being semi vegetarian day  <EOR> Chipotle distant memory now Braddah's! pig mango corn salsa awesomeness rolled into soft warm burrito! coconut bark delicious finish! husband enjoyed bowl most delicate flavorful fish town! hooked! Staff helpful let taste test selection perfect so thanks Jaime! BACK! <EOR> When walked people very nice service excellent tasted all meets all them great nachos tacos oh God everything good also coconut bars dessert Yum <EOR> There's really no other way define Island Style other OH GOD YESSSS!!  see people compare Chipotle well yeah okay see would similar far order but really no comparison quality flavor food Chipotle   place awesome if you're when Kenny serving EAT sure ask nachos   He said he'd never met anyone could finish nacho plates sitting   until Son Law did it   so now Kenny owes another round nachos   hahahaha!!  One thing try bark which coincidentally half pound when order dinner special which 4 meals $24 99   yes said $24 99 FOUR meals!!  kids meals either!  entrees drinks most amazing dessert included   you try place!! <EOR> After having driven past Braddah's numerous times decided try lunch   When walked entrance around noon weekday noticed line almost door usually good sign   7 8 people line   Because everything kind labor intensive took 20 minutes front line good business people lunch break     I decided Huli Huli Chicken Salad various fixings   setup reminded very much Chiptole but Hawaiian vibe   Also decided pick small box coconut bark which very tasty   The seating area pleasant clean few others eating meals   chicken salad bowl looked delicious but very disappointed chicken somewhat dry very minimal seasoning  Boo!  Even other toppings didn't even rise level tasty salad   resort adding salt pepper salad which very rare me     But before started eat salad realized I'd forgotten pick small box coconut box cashier   counter patiently waited worker recognize ask needed would assume  normal protocol   realize she busy but instead asking wanted totally ignored   three other customers paid finally spoke asked small box bark   Braddah's your workers need pay more attention customers  <EOR> The previous reviews didn't lie wasn't really wowed if weren't $5 $10 yelp deal probably would little pissed  would rather pay extra $5 chipotle instead IMO  liked concept idea Asian island flare but flavor execution wasn't there   filling decently portion but every exciting satisfying taste buds  <EOR> Always spot good fresh burrito taco  Great service always food never lets down   Also highly recommend coconut bark dessert  <EOR> Wow  first time great food   2 taco combo drink $5 95   definitely back again   Met Chris owner he's great guy   Can't wait until open green valley henderson area! <EOR> Been dying check place finally chance yesterday definitely impressed   service great love they'll give sample pork chicken before ordering because really didn't know wanted I pork disappointed  buddy chicken happy well    Other positives  quality ingredients including fresh jalapeños   Really difference tell  Great portions very fairly priced would say  Hawaiian themed touches around restaurant    Only minus really  they're going need some window treatments some kind very soon because despite only being March temperature around 70 ish blazing hot sundown sun setting west   suspect might aware working it    In any event definitely back soon  <EOR> Went across town use restaurant com certificate made committed fraud   Its fault shouldn't suffer it   should add shrimp meat choices   Owner front house back house help but didn't appear wash hands <EOR> Yeah buddy great island style food tried each meat steak chicken     OH my! setup kinda chipotle order food which great! bowl super flavorful  ladies service behind counter great well  Relaxed environment good music    One side note     white dude tight braddahs shirt backpack made scene  store sure over but probably need give guy attitude adjustment  Other then place great      Update And now guy acting sent cocky message  He's owner  Food good but every time don't want because owner     Lost star because it  <EOR> It OK   Good yelp deal  Paid very little lot food   Wasn't fav food while Vegas but new unique hit spot afternoon exploring looking new eats! <EOR> Leaving review because couldn't find Maryland Parkway location Yelp yet but  location reviewing Allow describe place word OMNOMNOM    At first thought great just need another taco burrito bowl place within walking distance UNLV others being Chipotle Cafe Rio   We're also needing hawaiian food either  But Braddahs knocked park  Hawaiian mexican might way describe it?
