Dessert? busboy lot more attentive waiter but course he busy clearing tables    I love pot pies   really thought Marie Callender's would good but chicken tasted fake like came can  vegetables taste started frozen  over $12 pot pie definitely worth price  <EOR> My Husband Grandson West Sahara Marie Callender dinner very disappointed salad bar ice tea ask refills tea salad terrible sitting long ranch dressing sour didn't even eat never going back !!! <EOR> Got 2 30 mini pot pie meal sister  shrimp tacos because when used come them amazing  first bite tasted mold  Something tasted beyond moldy disgusting  called manager over surprised he didn't come over right away usually should he didn't apologize anything  He asked if wanted something else  course don't want anything else if just swallowed something moldy   Service isn't good food clearly isn't either  Save your money <EOR> Well won't ever order again  Placed to go order online   Appetizer two entrees   options sides included entrees both chose side salad  Received confirmation online   husband pick refused give salads    Wait    what?  Manager says salads aren't option side entrees    weird cuz your online ordering system offered option  picked receipt says    Nope   giving salads   choose French Fries cole slaw fruit   poor husband argues manager little   Still hard no  He tries call but don't pick up   point he nice any more stink he reluctantly just gets fries  time French fries leave kitchen appetizers entrees now sitting 15 minutes everything cold soggy when he gets home    I am obviously displeased frustrated since French fries pretty much last thing wanted dinner now basically inedible  into argument which puts quite damper evening  All because some stupid manager couldn't ask kitchen couple side salads go    Thanks nothing Marie Callenders!
