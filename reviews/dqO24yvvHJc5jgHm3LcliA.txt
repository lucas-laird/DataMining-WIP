Both kids said its new favorite pizza gelato spot feeling seeing more us    And thank helping complete 2013 YELP goal! <EOR> Quick review First experience Novecento really disappointed  Quite possibly worst pizza entire life and eaten pizza gas stations truck stops bodegas among other places   Both pizzas tossed garbage    In depth review visited 10 5 8pm ordered two specialty pizzas Roma Calabrese along Arugula Salad to go   First impression positive  Charming little pizza parlor restaurant cool wood burning oven corner  gentlemen working counter very polite taking order chatting up  Smelled really good all signs pointing towards great experience    So pizzas pulled oven placed side cook working oven informed re do cause thin middle would edible  Same cook also asked ordered when new pizza came fire he seemed confused he questioning prep cook way he made pie  He still ahead fired it  Guess should tipped off    So cash $29 19 way home short two mile drive hill  lady Roma am eating Calabrese  Both bite both faces disgust  First off both pizzas non existent crust middle simply just cheese grease soup  outer crust both burnt black but somehow undercooked still tastes raw dough? Odd    The Roma tasted someone poured pound raw salt it  lightly salted meat cheese  bad sticking your tongue someone pouring raw salt it  saltiest food item ever eaten restaurant honestly   Salt overpowering wonder did pour entire bottle Garlic Salt it?

I decided margherita pizza  looks add toppings customize but suggest add no more 3  pizza won't cook all way through if loaded down but better way suggest people  felt telling food snob way sort looking down noses me  awkward uncomfortable   The pizza itself tasty but great hoped  Maybe just ordered wrong thing  While crust appropriately blackened oven center dough raw  fault issue cooks because ordered margherita pizza right off menu added NOTHING pizza  afraid say anything because sure they'd cop attitude act didn't know talking about   So why 4 stars? love concept idea place just need few minor tweaks right  Some sort large signage menu board would help all means something help newcomers  Second quality food high definitely back give Novocento another chance  chopped salad very good standout  keep Italian theme small gelato counter serve Illy coffee my favorite sure espresso next time in  <EOR> I find myself coming all time   Drawn moth light   I always simple Margharita pizza   Its simple its good   sprinkle some crushed red peppers fold new york slice   taste really good grilled cheese dipped creamy tomato sauce   I oven hot only takes 90 seconds cook   recommend waiting four minutes drop off your table let cool save roof your mouth   It's unique experience   service always super friendly good job keeping relaxing environment  <EOR> This place very good reasonably priced   small 10 inch Margherita pie few times caprese salad really good big price   They give regular balsamic really dark sweet caprese salad would ask them two regular balsamic other really sweet thick   They good values good pizza but depending direction coming extra few minutes Settebello GVR district might worth pizza doughy little bit better taste   All all though pizza good return  <EOR> And btw same kid mentioned other negative reviews messed order   Sadly owner lost many customers over someone just dngaf    I recommend somewhere else until take care problem  <EOR> Arugula salad great but unfortunately pizza swimming olive oil  very edge crispy but everything else soggy nearly inedible  girlfriend refused finish blanco pizza  Why!?

We also love getting burrata caprese salad pizza  can't seem find burrata most Italian restaurants now local pizza joint! Oh happy day!  The pizza nice chewy thin crust bubbled charred areas sauce light little bit wet but don't mind cheese perfectly melted doesn't pool grease processed cheeses  usually share regular pizza between 2 but eat entire pizza feel bad because light  wouldn't wait long eat your pizza because does soggy sauce  The burrata very creamy rich does fill little  other times opt caprese salad which much lighter  5 simple ingredients mozzarella tomato basil balsamic EVO   delicious  Now accustomed paying bit premium pizza salad Grimaldi's but Novecento's bill salad pizza usually around $20   what deal don't worry taking home leftover pizza whole car reaking garlic  <EOR> I don't know say based all positive reviews really expected place better  kind wonder if gone downhill since opened? very excited try place am Henderson very often but happened around area around dinner time  stopped place empty save few diners    It's easy see set up  order your pizza throw spiffy oven off go  Obviously main point place your pizza super quick which great  long pizza customer service good!
