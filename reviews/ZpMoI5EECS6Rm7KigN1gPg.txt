Had dinner reservation 4 Saturday 8 pm  few minutes before 8 waited additional 15 20 minutes seated  No big deal    The only reason gave place 1 star because because fountains nice look at  rest atmosphere quite boring outdated decor    Our waiter no where found most evening  Very slow taking order kept disappearing mid sentence  also took very long time food  weren't being rude demanding can't figure why he provided such horrible service maybe he bad day    The food just ok much better Chinese food Bay Area maybe even Panda Express  didn't order drinks except Pellegrino didn't order dessert couldn't wait   bill $160 per couple gratuity included  mediocre food horrible service really?!   I could've ordered same amount food but much better quality back home well under $80!  While hoped fine fun pleasant dining experience Saturday night Vegas definitely it  am also wondering if dined same restaurant other Yelp users  Yikes!  Needless say never return restaurant  Very disappointing  <EOR> Went brunch last year  very long time since enjoyed meal more  Everything delicious surprise  back anytime am back Las Vegas  never forget tuna tartar squid ink cones! Oh goodness!

Everything menu incredibly delicious  Peking duck sea bass hot sour soup amazing  wait staff sommelier some nicest people strip  love restaurant!! <EOR> Loved Sunday brunch!! Great food pretty view friendly services  <EOR> After google search best brunch las vegas happened upon Jasmine made reservation anxiously awaited vegas vacation     month late reservation did disappoint!  Sunday brunch wonderful!  service food view decor made wonderful experience husband maybe much husband he would equally prefer chicken parm local pizzeria    Sunday brunch buffet opposed other times where restaurant la carte     I think tried each item lot items but portioned quite small enjoy everything without waste stuffing yourself point rolled out   most memorable items peking duck lobster pot pie lobster profiterole yum! beef tartare cone so yum!    Everything delicious but liked best   also noodle bar which made happy also nod service usually buffet service non existent but servers made excellent meal better! <EOR> I family friends group 10+ holiday dim sum brunch satisfy various taste preferences  $65 person expecting something more gourmet typical Chinese restaurant menus  food good but nothing extraordinary would liked more variety dim sum choices    The decor location top of the line dessert presentation although Asian inspired desserts   Still need give try regular menu! <EOR> Had dinner place evening before valentine day  No doubt ambience awesome but food very expensive horrible  better bargain buffet Cesar's Palace  Avoid place  <EOR> The Peking duck delicious  Very interesting bring duck carve part first dish then bring back remaining duck kitchen second dish which lettuce wrap  wife ended sharing dish barely ate half duck would recommend sharing dish someone    Jasmine also offers great view fountain show Bellaio chance take break Vegas crowd  <EOR> This great venue set Balligio  Yes pricy but expected  Meal very good everyone enjoyed meals service excellent  fountain service meal rate above par  Would return restaurant sure! <EOR> Very good food but worst levels service seen  waiter discussed amount dinner no less 3 times because wanted use regular menu over packaged one  told price issue  Finally ask stop discussing price front wife anniversary   We bought half bottle wine serve ourselves  first put bottle wine bucket behind wife then reach around serve ourselves? WOW   If Bellagio urge skip place  <EOR> I've better Chinese food mom pop take restaurant  Nice fountain view but totally overpriced  <EOR> Entre lo raro del lugar las múltiples restricciones los platillos bastante malos encontré tres cosas que valen la pena  1 ver las fuentes del bellagio mientras comes    wow 2 la decoración es hermosa 3 el Cordero parece mantequilla deli  <EOR> This review Sunday brunch   $58 brunch?  Yeah   expensive   felt guilty spending kind money brunch especially since wealthy but let tell you    worth it   Ok let justify it   decent brunch Vegas normally spend $30   Vegas looking eat Denny's try away brunch $10   $30 right nice fun place decent food brunch   Couple fact ate much barely ate snack dinner   saved cost dinner which would spent another $30 $40   Now add elegant luxurious ambience Jasmine sitting next Bellagio fountains price isn't bad!  Now sticker shock way say top things must try Vegas before die   maybe should say top things must try Vegas before wise raise price   So place damn good?  Let's start Peking Duck   am Hong Kong know good Peking Duck totally legit   Crispy skin sliced thin only skin fat meat   bun it?  Superb   Soft light fluffy   Even Peking Duck some nicer restaurants Monterey Park can't compete   sit eat just all day   Poached shrimp cocktail    Gigantic meaty delicious   They poke style tuna little waffle cone made squid ink   fabulous   Similarly beef tatare spinach waffle cone   wasn't good but still pretty tasty   Smoked salmon excellent   They dim sum har gow shu mai    best dim sum but pretty good   would say better dim sum found Bacchanal Buffet Caesar's   So many items delicious can't through them item item   Let's just say very impressed most things there   With said some things avoid 1  asian noodle soup station   love noodles   never turn down noodles   But noodle station choice maifun rice noodles egg noodles served chicken stock   add fish balls fish cakes vegetables it   soup bland   noodles bland   Just did hit spot   2  Lobster Eggs Benedict   What's love?

Hello! great view while dining  came party 5 all tried tasting menus  don't remember everything ate because 2 years ago  But remember all thought food delicious stuffed but overly stuffed point explosion! must try if Chinese food  little pricey food served but still must try least once  <EOR> Fantastic service food really well made    wasn't sure expect but very pleased    going back again      if Bellagio quits charging parking     <EOR> This billed fine dining but frankly casual dim sum place Bellagio Noodles better food half price    The service good view fountains fantastic but if looking great Chinese food place  <EOR> The Art Fusion Cuisine The moment set foot magnificent Belagio realize whole new class service hospitality  All present magnified enter grand room Jasmine  decor opulent classic view inviting spectacular  Once dumplings served your know food prepared cooked special chef staff  meets succulent tasty rice absolutely perfect  servers friendly informative  great experience highly recommend moderately priced super restaurant  <EOR> Awesome knowledgeable staff  Amazing Barbecue Peking Duck while watching show  Very pricey but duck worth it! <EOR> I Sunday brunch high expectation but maybe downfall  Selection very limited but quality exceptional   view wonderful well    The thing really looking forward King crab legs but sort disappointed putting straggly looking legs   Just looking through pictures people taken expecting grand display seafood but really sort small  Somethings really ticked off when made reservations asked champagne being included but cost $$$ dress code   don't think dress code really applied saw people shorts eating well  <EOR> This worst experiences buffet style brunch  much choice buffet old sushi night before fatty prime rib sour Peking duck classic brunch options  The only thing fancy 3 tier fruit dessert plate bring  plate mean 9 grape size cutouts melons 3 mini muffins 3 jams some butter  no bread even spread butter on  I wish could ask refund charge them additional feedback awesome scenic spot best brunch place town awesome menu  super expensive expect nice service right? waiter wasn't very attentive price tip paying  Don't feel important when see fancy designer plate setting coz soon sit take away!!! rubbish  Don't put th first place don't charge expensive brunch below mediocre brunch selection  Almost forgot desserts equally bad  making fresh crepes guys!? The view breathtaking however seated awful table no view despite requesting nice view twice day before  I want money back!!! Don't unless want feel robbed   Edit give Jasmine another shot perhaps dinner  <EOR> Came eat Peking duck  When order duck expect whole duck table well maybe least 50% whole duck   place's duck twice three times more expensive other Chinese place but amount duck give 5% whole duck!! First give duck Peking style wrapped then second chop tiny amount duck some kind vegetable Chinese bread   IT!!? Oh well figure pay much duck just location atmosphere I enjoyed nice fountain view   3 stars  <EOR> I Jasmine ten years ago thought most amazing restaurant   Unfortunately gone down quality service level complete embarrassment!!!  food quality equal panda express would find local mall    service equally horrible!  only thing both incredibly amazing view Bellagio fountains   Incredibly sad see restaurant completely down such way  NEVER again  <EOR> I loved eating lake Bellagio during water show   most bougie chinese food ever life   still hungry hour later but whole experience worth it   Good service Chinese restaurant?!?  guess if you're paying $88 bucks person better nice   fixed menu good overall but sharks fin soup no taste  <EOR> Amazing views Bellagio fountains   charge food off set backdrop   food seemed pretty authentic   tried udon noodles walnut shrimp kung pao braised tofu   Each entree 30$   Everything good   three finished all those dishes completely addition spring rolls soup   actually prefer some local Chinese restaurants hometown but food good though over priced  <EOR> Best time ever restaurant! husband  booked valentine's dinner them most wonderful experience   While dinning could hear see Bellagio fountain running food ok everything else worth going! Love highly recommend it! <EOR> There isn't quite anything watching Bellagio fountains while enjoy your brunch  being said food quality okay but compared most other buffets quality quite good  Although cheap $60 per person quality food could probably better  If decide sure request seat good view fountains  <EOR> Finally came tried Jasmine Dim Sum buffet over Christmas   family wanting try years but biggest deterrent price   $68 person much more buffet charging across way    They open 11 people lined opened up   thought could stroll whenever wanted but told come back 1 hr   great seat right against windows saw fountains close   The buffet only dim sum dishes but carving station different meats raw bar sushi there's also noodle station made order noodle dishes   dessert selection pretty good favorite dishes macarons chocolate covered strawberries   Overall great dining experience we'll return next time  <EOR> Knowing BF despises buffet style dining yet he's still big fan Jasmine decided come Jasmine's famous Christmas brunch  thought lucky when found Jasmine offering dim sum buffet brunch 12 25 14 1 4 15  turned nothing short mediocrity   Since did want take reservation bit worried needed wait line but weren't all busy begin Friday noon 12 26 14 looking back probably should've sign  no problem paying $58 per person long worth while  far reviews lobster served during brunch seen none    did serve fresh big peeled shrimps well crab legs though fresh shrimps  oysters just plain gross  did look fresh all looked rather staled   As dim sum? just okay nothing haven't tasted before unlike ones China Poblano Cosmopolitan those great!!! Poor dessert selection only few items available  did enjoy tiramisu cup  bf pleasantly surprised delicious crepes turned considering Jasmine being Chinese restaurant   Other those points no any recollection whatsoever special holiday dim sum buffet Jasmine  servers very prompt fill cups clean plates but somehow did feel personal enough  BF both trying talk hostess servers even manger no cracked smile once    Perhaps fact white guy sitting next much them handle? guess never find out     Yes very well aware Jasmine situated inside Bellagio considered themselves fine dining but don't take reservation unless party 8 more just plain preposterous  aware everybody travels packs? couples us? More importantly men's room though designed nicely but toilet wasn't even scrubbed down nor clean    residues all around Someone definitely some digestive problems before gross        Overall if must Bellagio fountain view your dim sum buffet style dessert I'd say give place whirl  Just sure come large party otherwise wouldn't even seat anywhere close terrace where you'd truly see fountains    <EOR> I enjoyed Sunday Brunch  Lobster eggs Benedict green New Zealand Clams juicy duck meat white chocolate marshmallows  All wonderful tasty treats  Overlooking water fountains exceptional personal service hats off Chef Hiew <EOR> Loved Peking duck  Service terrible   moment seated hostess served water sulky bus boy served Peking duck      why can't more congenial inviting?  I asked more water he filled glass half way    he ran water never came back     <EOR> Incredibly beautiful elegant gorgeous decor!!!!  Lovely table settings unique China flatware  food VERY VERY expensive yet delicious perfectly presented  husband enjoyed Sweet Sour Pork definitely your traditional looking dish which he said fantastic Hot Sour Soup a bit spicy taste but otherwise excellent   Dim Sum Basket Trio super TINY portions great soggy Crispy Walnut Prawns tasty 8 LARGE prawns truthfully nothing special although delicious   also shared some Jasmine Fried Rice HUGE dish easily enough 4 more! very unusual texture yet quite delicious  All all dining experience wonderful beautiful restaurant views dancing water light show although all honesty feel food very overpriced  ate several fabulous restaurants Dubai less! <EOR> Review Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu three course meal very good   restaurant beautifully appointed service absolutely top notch   Everything done well!

The food absolutely delicious definitely plenty around which sometimes case upmarket restaurants  Highly recommend beef ribs vegetable spring rolls sweet sour pork all house favourites can't really wrong them   Beautiful decor wonderful food else could possibly want? <EOR> Originally supposed Michael Mina's michelin star restaurant Bellagio but being first trip thought would much cooler if dinner sat front center Bellagio's Fountain Show proceeded reservations   When walked little empty making believe wasn't great never judge book its cover      bartender preparing mixologist competition hold annually Vegas made some cocktails he created himself competition   fantastic!!! Kiss Dragon which some chili pepper even though high alcohol content couldn't taste it   Talk getting drunk fast without realizing right?  Well Lobster dumpings which phenomenal wish Shanghai dumplings but father fasting Easter cannot any meat   also cup wonton soup which far if you've never tasted REAL cup wonton soup no comparisson chinese delivery home   Wow!!! refreshing didn't greasy oily taste normally your local chinese restaurant   Handmade wontons incredible plentiful!!!  For dinner ordered Mongolion Beef   never eaten such tender meat Chinese restaurant   Wow!!!!  The view Fountain show going every 15 minutes delight especially since able hear music each show which gave even more entertainment   think would even cooler if outdoor seating but isn't    guess because water show close restaurant probably gets mist its windows  <EOR> Great atmosphere excellent food  Best kungpao chicken ever had! Spring rolls excellent  Service spot well! Great view water show during dinner  <EOR> Where start! entire Jasmine experience very unpleasant  chose restaurant looking Cantonese food popped many search results  ahead made reservation  Even though reservation when actually showed made wait good few minutes before table  look menu realized place way expensive other restaurants resort much lesser variety  ahead placed order Dim Sum Basket Wok Fried Udon Noodles  Basket cost $28 but came only 3 dumplings 3 kinds does 3 dumplings between 2 people  LOL! anyway half each dumpling moved shock  Dim Sum Platter Lemongrass which around same price comes handsome 15 16 dim sums tasted much better  Anyway Udon Noodles quite good quantity good too  between lady camera came over offered click picture  Thinking probably complimentary all guests agreed Little did know getting into  she couple standard poses then realize probably complimentary  let hostess know interested pictures but response let know ourselves Weird!! allowed entertain your guests cannot even inform her  did see rest dinner assumed she informed  then tried put bill room number MGM unable so  did even try resolve issue pay restaurant thereby losing all those precious points  left restaurant quite annoyed lack good customer service started playing slots nearby lady took photograph finds all crowd show pictures found very creepy strange staff did inform even left  heck did she find us!

Jasmine sumptuously delicious restaurant fronting Lake Bellagio thus showcasing continuous fountain shows front  honest place eat watch them pre requisite dining experience  pick Jasmine bomb!!! I'm old  Did use expression correctly? food service both spectacular!  I find humorous stu     um people complain cost places this  comment small portions are  Dude  You're Vegas  You're Bellagio  isn't Panda Express  Just stu    just stick Panda Express  just tip Chinese don't actually drown every dish soy sauce    Chinese probably favorite cuisine Japanese mainly sushi Italian  reason giving five stars taste wasn't quite explosively yummy flavor fest taste buds anticipated  good very good  But there's another echelon could reached  Next time plan trying Peking Duck  That'll true test  Can't wait!! <EOR> Just great powers come great responsabilities Great food sometimes come big pocket hole maker price  Jasmine no exception  Prices rack bill pretty quick specially if decide explore non menu items However getting awesome quality   fellas real deal hatori hanzo katana Chinese food your 10 dollars replica mall kiosk as long dont order regular stuff The food amazing   Its freshness taste top knotch  Very unique original plates served generous portions  definetly sharing style kinda place The dumplings fresh them wonton soup packs lots flavor however all entrees  literally ordered every plate menu big group tell all them outstanding  getting karate chopped flavor every bite every dish  recommend duck Crab Neptune pillow Seabass soya prawns compliment some Chinese broccoli fried rice  BEWARE if panda express type guy wont find most those plates here However menu some items wont freak catered towards non Chinese guest  If into real Chinese food ask server chef   Service impeccable since walked   restaurant carries Fresh smell and nice waiting room Chinese candies  sommelier approach table plenty times   Your plates constantly changed drink never saw anywhere lower  1 2 full   This plus decoration made whole ambiance perfect   Nothing watching Bellagio fountains while having dinner!  really  enjoyed meal great experience  If want indulge yourself fancy Chinese dinner  place definetly rock your world while making dent your pocket  very well worthy dent though! <EOR> The staff wonderful  crab amazing  alone reason return  <EOR> I say am amazed good reviews place gets   But then again know average Las Vegas visitor all glitz well taste isn't exactly strongest traits      usually   keep telling myself because only way explain some reviews   We popped Tuesday evening May 8th 2012       menu looked interesting since Vietnamese partner really enjoyed food offerings Las Vegas point decided give supposedly fine Chinese restaurant        guess should hint when no wait no need reservations    even having amazing view Bellagio fountains right outside its windows  I website find exact dishes menu but only seem brunch menu special mother's day sorry    We started some appetizers spring rolls which bland nothing special weren't far reach frozen ones ordered side order Chinese broccoli which cooked fine but again nothing special just plain steamed no seasonings all   Meh   My partner ordered tofu dish which photos posted Yelp com         small square cubes tofu sauce which supposed spicy       not   When partner pushes dish away quiet know below par it doesn't happen often    am tofu fan but tasted sauce least attempted taste because frankly almost zero flavor   never tasted more bland sauce   Another member party ordered whole fish dish fried sorry can't remember name dish but believe only fried fish dish menu    fish fried nicely rather pedestrian batter but nicely done tad overcooked but least fresh   But sauce  fresh tomato sauce   Seriously tasted dollar store ketchup little white vinegar maybe splash Hoisin sauce   definitely made fresh ketchupy really horrible     I want say cannot remember years eating all sorts restaurants cafes all over cannot remember EVER complaining meal   again time sucked ate fish trying avoid sauce but really couldn't stand seeing partner eating anything only couple bites   waiter obviously pleased but he did allow reorder pushing hard chow mien which he ordered   dish salty inedible  I later take all night diner just he didn't bed hungry    The waiter happy prospects dish also being acceptable   He said he would talk manager came back said manager said everyone could dessert pre selected choice house   didn't want dessert politely asked partner's meal taken off check   Instead responding he kept trying place dessert front partner   When said no he finally came back said manager taken off check   Now manager don't know if Mr  Roberto Liendo listed website if someone else   know he total coward   courtesy come table talk meal especially since everything sub par we did tell waiter fish but did ask removed check    Considering prices food anyone would expect food extraordinary least above par   wasn't even good most take out Chinese restaurants     Oh place beautiful but  only value place based visit   horrible experience would highly suggest if reading review while trying decide where eat pass outside see fountains  <EOR> Dont Chinese NY dim sum brunch poor quality especially price  Wing Lei but CNY brunch doesn't start till tomorrow decided try Jasmine instead because open regretted it    Same price Wing Lei $58 88 8 lucky number but less choice dim sum taste really mediocre  Also didn't didn't carts really just straight buffet  large quantities everything steamers obviously all sitting while  Even noon Sunday only 3 4 full empty buffet always means old food    I'm going bother going into detail because none memorable  Best thing mango coconut pudding dessert    Service wasn't friendly track them down when needed something  Unlike Wing Lei tea wasn't included extra $8 charge    This would 1 star review if wasn't amazing view fountain  really only saving grace  Oh liked high quality linens    So if you're craving high quality class dim sum experience try Wing Lei exact same price but much better every way  Jasmine huge waste time money  <EOR> Amazing view food portion good well  view fountain restaurant romantic   sure book ahead request window seating good view  <EOR> Jasmine elegant beautifully decorated restaurant most seats having great view Bellagio Fountains  dining table centered just table away windows looking fountains  Furnishings sumptuous expensive fabric covering dining chairs  when Diane seated fresh red roses vase along colorful Asian themed serving plates adorned table  All food served fine china silverware provided high quality  Restaurant Week menu selections chosen dinner but augmented soup  Overall food service pretty much matched ambiance decor place    An appetizer Peking Duck Hand Rolls julienned cucumbers scallions inside rice pancakes fine start  Although two hand rolls small one third less most mu shu previously consumed tasty meaty
