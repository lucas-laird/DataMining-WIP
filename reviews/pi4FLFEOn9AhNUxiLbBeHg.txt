I love Poke! could eat breakfast lunch dinner long some rice lolz  try pick poke atleast once week but damnn its gotten expensive  Its owners fault cause price tuna gone everywhere instead ordering pound order just half pound lunch  favorite limu poke limu tako taste good  Some days when come you'll see fresh fish display parrot fish kala fish great grilling  owners also very nice people thats why coming years  <EOR> The poke really good  nice place poke  very similar poke Hawaii  would better if tables sit but other good place poke  just recently moved Hawaii coming often  <EOR> Came visit Jawaiian friends recommendation gotta say he right! place some delicious fresh ahi poke!

Probably because 110+ degree heat but when friends arrived didn't look anything left but nice folks behind counter told could whip any poké fish fridge would like  sampled 5 different types poké really liked regular garlic ones  seaweed much hit but personal taste preference  tuna extremely fresh also enjoyed rice ball  Overall worth trip strange parking Chinatown   However place eat 100+ degree heat desert sun might just bring small cooler park your car somewhere chow down  Option #2 very enticing since some establishments apparently repute area  <EOR> Was super excited finally trying place based ratings reviews yelp    I tried 4 different poke spicy ahi shoyu ahi limu oyster poke   They all just okay  mean good but guess expected something lot better   spicy ahi wasn't spicy enough better shoyu ahi other places    You would think place only sold poke would making amazing product but just average  <EOR> Dennis da owner right aloha!

I taken aback when came but seems family owned business closed Tuesdays random day closed! selection small but little quantity LOT quality have  choose which sizes want take to go which beauty place worthwhile able order half size even 1 4 size very reasonable price! 1 2 size spicy tuna limu little container rice you combination different ones switch up! For $10 dined excellent lunch ahi poke  astounded affordable mention feel much better any sushi bar ever it's literally making your own sashimi sushi home go! Cheaper any sushi bar more your buck  Plus family owned businesses always more hospitable! don't know if lady spoke owner but she incredibly helpful enthusiastic any questions have!  This definitely new favorite hideaway places Chinatown! <EOR> They give lot large but still think $15 little steep get  Also poké didn't taste all fresh drying display  <EOR> I visiting California lot places sell poke decided give place try  literally need poke least once every week because  addicted am! curious fresh fish would taste considering Vegas far being close ocean   I've fair share bland dry fish even fish doesn't taste fresh all  surprisingly place really great poke bowls being desert  However little disappointed barely any more fish left very few choose from  But other leftover flavored fish left still tasteful! <EOR> My favorite poke shop outside hawaii  Spicy garlic favorite   Wish place Los Angeles <EOR> It wasn't favorite place town all options gone extremely limited order wasn't very inviting wonder long fish sitting around $11 bowl rice tuna $4 side seaweed !!!! Sorry but honest <EOR> I'll completely honest wasn't sure expect but  made place quite memorable  Luckily took plunge decided stop extremely pleased presented    Food 5 5  Poke but your average Chipotle poke but rather your counter poke see while Hawaii  many choices choose both fish sauce quite amazing  Fish fresh tasting wasn't slightest bit fishyness all    Parking Parking easy guess having specific area took little bit figure where park quite lots spaces available but kinda odd layout    Service lady behind counter really kind overall experience pleasant    If any doubts find some decent authentic poke Las Vegas area just head over wonderful treat era filled Chipotle style poke  <EOR> The best poke ever had  into poke before all poke places opened bay area  still think no place bay beats it  more traditional poke minimal toppings  poke mix pretty much sashimi onions green onions sesame peppers sauce  But greatest mix ever  spicy options very spicy delicious   This time spicy garlic ahi poke bowl spicy ahi poke bowl  big chunks fish raw onions mixed sauce just amazing  spiciness blasting flavors your mouth  drooling thinking it   I think must every time Vegas  <EOR> love place!  fresh poke  just foodland hawaii <EOR> Humble storefront  Surprisingly fresh quality poke better anything tried Hawaii even  Ask samples before making decision   arrived Monday mid afternoon most trays already empty   No seating only few benches outside but really place formatted deli to go   Parking situation bit confusing but plenty nearby street parking  <EOR> just Wasabi Poke great very spicy! Also Hawaiian Style excellent well  Highly recommend  <EOR>
