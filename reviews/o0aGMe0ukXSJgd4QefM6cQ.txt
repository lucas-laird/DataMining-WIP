No complimentary dessert! Seriously RL? just really disappointing   Needless say no intention ever returning Red Lobster  If going throw down money seafood better some effing good seafood know going here  <EOR> Decided try something new very happy   ordered fried clams French fries   Seems pretty simple   Clams over cooked chewy   Fries good   Wife's green beans very over cooked   real problem biscuits   didn't want them   allergic them   Said so   server Amber put them table anyway   Wouldn't take them away   Server said she leave them    Seems wasteful rude   asked why she said manager said she no choice    What's going Red Lobster?  Why manager forcing stuff people don't want it?  Why she scared boss? <EOR> I fried shrimp french fries which okay  salad good always biscuits can't beat  If want try biscuits home sam'sclub fantastic mix tried them they're worth it <EOR> Wanna Laugh?  husband another couple where everyone proceeds order NEW YORK STRIP STEAK!   think self why  world did come Red Lobster them eat steak?   naturally order fish!
