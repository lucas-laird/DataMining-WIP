Truly great locals spot   Second location opening Fashion Show told    mmmmm  <EOR> I coming many many years  really all cake options variety  am going lie  think tried almost all them! few which same frosting the sweet overkill one then some wayyyyy much chocolate I swear love chocolate but overkill   peanut butter chocolate cake gooey peanut butter 1 2 chocolate ganache type frosting  Way sweet guilt inducing  would still good less peanut butter frosting  cakes very dense If  your thing few times cakes dry  disappointment    The gluten free cakes OK but nothing would drive far crave    Overall red velvet seems favorite    In terms food can't really speak menu much  only ordered Vegan taco salad very good  meat seasoned just right tasty salad  tried anything else because always back taco salad    What turned off seeing them news lied customers calorie content  upsetting because spent many years calorie counting think people rely being told truth plan day based calories  would hope care enough customers tell truth but every time ask calories answer don't know  think need truthful  <EOR> I've heard many good things place but unfortunately didn't experience myself   Being vegan awesome when find vegan friendly restaurant    but one   sadly I ordered special crispy vegan chicken sandwich  When arrived literally fell apart  lettuce wasn't very fresh almost tasted dirty  chicken dry  when asked waitress made she didn't know  When asked ingredients mayo    she didn't know   know what's food vegan products they're using because sometimes things missed   Overall sandwich so so  definitely worth 10 95 And although waitress kind service ridiculously slow   It's shame aren't more vegan places around actually fresh food!  Sorry Red Velvet probably won't visiting again! <EOR> The only reason excellent low calorie desserts  turns lied calorie content actually high calorie excellent desserts    Check stories newspaper more info  never again  <EOR> Questionable nutrition info aside place both overpriced lacking  Service word sucks walked repeatedly crappy layout ignored multiple staff  literally walk stand right someone's table staring them because there's no signage hostess let know seat yourself wait approach two unlabeled counters  awkward    When place hypes themselves being vegetarian menu probably shouldn't include chicken every other dish  But hey understand wanting appeal larger audience every dish made vegetarian vegan using tofu  Which questionably nutritious processed soy but hey     Much nearby Panini Café place somehow expects find reasonable spend $16 sandwich  don't know but I'd rather hit Strip gourmet burger celebrity chef if going pay that  no using organic ingredients doesn't justify it   Tried veggie Panini chicken pesto Panini pesto missing but even sure flavor would saved  Everything inside sandwich overpowered bread  good way   This place hyped both vegetarian vegan healthy  organic little menu offerings actually fit criteria which trumps fact half decent desserts  <EOR> This review both Red Velvet Cafe locations   I'm saying don't serve delicious healthy food  saying sweets yummy  giving 2 stars  However won't returning locations again   http www reviewjournal com columns blogs jane ann morrison cookies might be good be true  To summarize really quick article tells people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies which claim only 27 calories each  good true?

My other problem putting leftovers fridge opened back find solidified fat    probably why delicious loaded butter oil  few times because thought making healthful choices   I feel slightly deceived  <EOR> I really really wanted place   friend raving months   He likes bring home desserts lucky enough try carrot cake sandwiches before even set foot restaurant   delicious dragged boyfriend restaurant lunch   It mid afternoon when busy maybe three other tables occupied   clear whether needed seat ourselves kinda stood akwardly until someone yelled behind counter sit anywhere   Then waited 15 minutes approached   boyfriend finally someone took drink food order never returned   counter refills drinks   different person dropped off food boyfriend back counter pay bill   We ordered quesadilla appetizer which awesome   ordered bland chicken wrap boyfriend ordered equally bland sandwich     After mostly dissappointing food very dissappointing service actually dissappointed if doesn't exist? left   Without dessert which whole reason even took there!  Anyways friend recommended still raves maybe again him   Maybe he knows some secret getting service don't  <EOR> I heard legendary vegan cookies Red Velvet Cafe decided pick dozen art opening having gallery downtown   placed order day before staff them ready waiting when picked them work   Lemme tell ya Red Velvet Cafe doesn't take cookie makin' lightly  flavorful rich YES! even buttery tasting   won over TON folks couldn't believe cookies vegan night!

For main course boyfriend shared Buffalo Chicken Wrap  wasn't really sold when ordered it  because shy spicy things but because its described Lettuce Tomato Buffalo Sauce Ranch Cheese I mean really exciting Buffalo Chicken Wrap?   Despite its very bland description many complements deserves! First all know when you're eating wrap its hard take bites without pieces lettuce meat other veggies escaping because long? chopped lettuce no yucky iceberg pieces mixed cheese lightly covered ranch cubed grilled chicken tossed buffalo sauce all cozy wheat wrap  Very easy eat without excess food particles falling out! also loved fact served baked chips  give wrap 4 stars!  Lets down favorite part every meal   DESSERT! can't Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake  No regrets all  Although very shocked when found entire piece cake consumed only 150 calories not couting completely vegan!!! tasted heart attack although its significantly less volatile Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put your lunch box  Without doubt best red velvet ever experienced  frosting heavenly cake rich strawberry top refreshing   Will return Red Velvet Cafe? YES can't wait! <EOR> My first review! please take seat Let start off obligatory vegetarian vegan statement think should accompany reviews places cater unfortunate souls kidding! Been thrice   First time year half ago tried Chicken Artichoke Spinach Panini Vegan cheese I'm lactose intolerant     first time trying Vegan cheese     say first time?  Awkward?  Painful? right    successfully avoided vegan cheese since though rest ingredients fine avoided RVC guilt association sort reasoning   Finally getting courage back tried Taco Salad last week based all positive Yelp reviews seems garner    Well happy say much deserved   First HUGE   only ate half am convinced could successfully feed family vegans week    baked ? taco shell highlight within contained ton rice lettuce chunks chicken vegans substitute lot non meat meats salsa no cheese vegan otherwise    thought taste all ingredients spot definitely didn't walk away hungry     Went again lunch today Chicken Burger hold cheese Baked Fries     officially love place statute limitations Vegan Cheese infractions run out     Chicken Burger almost exactly Chicken Sandwiches Wendys McDonalds etc except actually flavor made fresh ingredients    Baked Fries still same great taste fried french fries texture wasn't off putting least    $7 95 thought meal steal   All three experiences getting take out lunch service friendly enough never wait more few minutes before food ready they usually say 20 minutes when call told      I close giving place 5 stars based last two experiences but think just spontaneously decided reserve 5 star reviews places provide life altering experience and places never served Vegan Cheese <EOR> This favorite place bring non vegetarian friend   regular menu but everything made vegan  many times strongly recommend vegan tuna panini taco salad buffalo vegan chicken wrap vegan tortellini  desserts die sure keep room some!
