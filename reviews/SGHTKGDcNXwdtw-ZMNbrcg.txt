So so flavor foods labeled incorrectly  would rate chicken tikki masala pretty good  bad but best had  However portion extremely small $14 cost didn't include rice  left feeling disappointed sorry spent good money food only so so overall  might consider returning if prices menu weren't steep  <EOR> I tried Bollywood again going many months   main peeve before lunch buffet lukewarm best   time asked plate microwaved much better hot!  They've really watered down raita other sauces   Spice mild food flavorful   good selection vegetarian entrees   Dinner good before  I'd avoid combo special  eggplant dishes superb   Dinner pricing considerably more $9 99 7 day lunch buffet they're currently offering   won't going back soon  <EOR> It's closed!
