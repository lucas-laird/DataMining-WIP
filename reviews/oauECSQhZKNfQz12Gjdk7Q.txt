Even basic dishes Shrimp Pad Thai die for  come every other week  <EOR> This place great  service definitely awesome  ordered chicken chow mein noodles perfectly cooked tender much oil  spice level 3 I'm wimp! definitely spiced well  new favorite Thai place!!!! <EOR> I love place    I reminded again last night walked into another Thai restaurant closer home 6 people pushed front declaring reservations table 27 which guess entitled them seated first  Color them rude! husband decided ditch place fast could find new restaurant    We way Phil Smith Center limited time  Flamingo right way I 15 Thai Spice came immediately mind!  strip mall adjacent Palms Casino  should thought Thai Spice first place  atmosphere relaxed hostess warm friendly sit anywhere chose table   which joke only 4 times yet found cozy table 2 window always pick available dining pleasure  server comfortably made drive Smith Center time show   Now food  scrumptious leaves no doubt why Thai Spice ranked Vegas top Thai restaurant many years row  Try egg rolls taste homemade  Look loving care put carving carrot into beautiful flower accompany plating  Order Pad Thai rediscover joy eating   Our cost dinner two + appetizer $34  <EOR> Meeting group friends certainly account enjoyable evening   But when dine good meal just enhances it!  Even though larger group 3 decided share some dishes taste several things   started Chicken Satay Potstickers   cannot stress much love peanut sauce accompanies chicken satay   Needless say really liked them would order them again   potstickers cabbage filling which surprised since used them having meat filling   all good   basically flavor egg roll   For entrees split Drunken Noodle beef well Yellow Curry Combo   drunken noodle dish compiled flat noodle plenty beef vegetables   Again expert but thought did great job!     When ordered Yellow Curry Combo wanted spice level 7   waitress didn't think could handle spice she suggested 4 5   Now group liked spice   dish certainly needed more heat level   brought some spice could add ourselves   thought little odd   still enjoyed flavor yellow curry without spice before added more     Beside spice snafu service good   very polite attentive   Thank Thai Spice furthering education thai food  <EOR> Visiting Pittsburgh decided try based location Yelp reviews  absolutely satisfied  very nice non flashy well decorated seating area very polite smiling staff    great food  Garlic Tofu eat vegetarian friend ordered Basil Chicken spice levels 7 8 respectfully  Food arrived quickly hot   both temperature spicyness levels we'd requested   So some excellent Thai food environment lets your mind focus taste highly recommend  <EOR> This place very good thai food thai owned  Tom Yum soup Papaya Salad Fried catfish curry Singha! authentic feast savor  <EOR> Located run down strip mall many years  grand opening sign BS  many Thai restaurants vicinity poor customer service  aging waitress busy flirting older caucasian male worry only other customer place  He ranting raving great soup she served 5 minutes prior  Being cold outside absolutely LOVE soup asked aging server customer Which soup that?'' server rudely said no serve public!

THE SECOND VISIT Pure disappointment      The service well lacking SERVICE  took them least 10 minutes greet give place sit  place wasn't even full probably just 3rd full just left side where seating everyone  greeting wasn't exactly welcoming  standing front restaurant waiting seated girl just came said help you? WTH  restaurant think obvious reason why anyone would but wasn't say yes help filling stomach quitting your job don't see your face again just bit tongue said table 3  seated decided order right away since just off lunch special menu but took forever finally order relayed since waitress just sat then neglected us  seemed though she even avoided while calling some points since she'd look just turn away  She finally came she just seemed another dimension something  told want pepper steak level 4 then she said okay level 4 level spicy? just confusing  back forth few times repeating level wanted then she'd repeat same question  She rest order left    I don't remember else ordered other pepper steak pad thai  might've actually  orders pad thai since bf brother both wanted order spicy level 8 can't higher 4 lol    Since took long food come decided wanted appetizer also wanted glasses water filled since cups already empty while ice starting melt  kept signaling waitress but she's just walk look other way look look away really awkward beginning wonder if just trippin' if her  all agreed ha  Maybe just she young couldn't handle multitasking  Whatever definitely didn't leave good impression us    The pad thai good but great first time went    pepper steak don't even remember mustn't all great  never  appetizer can't comment that    It kinda sucked because boyfriend took brother eat because such good experience bombass food first time came thought he'd love but totally flipped made bad experience bad service mediocre food  much say place before walked he expected amazing but quickly disappointed  He even said wasn't good telling told didn't expect this    I coming back  <EOR> The quality way way down price course! see no green garnish NO Brussels sprouts very little meat well don't know going ownership but need step quality step business won't last much longer type food being served   sorry see guys failing wish refund but don't want waste gas driving back eat somewhere else REFUND REPLACE FOOD PLEASE??? <EOR> I always order spring rolls  sauces super yummy but missing rice noodles  Also asked hot sauce order didn't it  <EOR> The best pad thai ever had  Its overly saucy some places  really miss place hunt good Thai place yet find compares Thai Spice This few restaurants where felt comfortable trying new dishes  dishes consistently good  price fair  <EOR> Just ordered lunch take special  supposed $5 per order two orders came $20  Very odd math there  Chicken fried rice atrocious  Greasy big cashews pineapple chunks it  Ordered 7 hot scale even 1  Thai Beef also very bland basically tasted old gray meat seen better days  mean if you're going serve awful meat least spice bit  still cannot scrape greasy paste off palate meal  much better Thai places town spend your money time on  <EOR> Nobody checked whole meal  Need fork?
