Finally asked shift leader if any cramberry juice  He says yes only cocktails though  cant used mix vodka  He also mentioned customers can't even purchase cranberry juice itself  Anyway If cranberry vodka cocktail then don't know why even cranberry juice stock   The manager finally came end meal he told yes cranberry vodkas yes sell cranberry juice separately    except don't any stock  He ended making original 2 drinks ordered    end meal    At least tried    food tastes great   The only reason giving 2 stars instead 1 because least tried drink manager apologized when he finally arrived end meal    Tip management if cant provide cocktails your guests    then don't hand them cocktail menu right when seated would never problem  <EOR> They play off fine dining Korean place but actually pretty average  only thing above average meat which still managed overcook  When guys seating didn't any above average service  did set all sides before sat down  Some sides spicy couldn't eat them  servers cook everything which guess reasons call themselves better other Korean BBQ places but when told server meat ready she took long cut serve practically well done pieces meat  ordered grilled bulgogi friend said tasted ash she couldn't even finish it  Came happy hour thinking we'd great meal $40 left hungry  Never water refilled until end servers wear t shirts yet still rave restaurant  Glad try but even happy hour won't back  <EOR> I heard lot good things place all kbbq lovers course way here  restaurant nice spacious compared magal Hobak  Food really good but somethings choose Hobak over place  First thing wish servers would ask would meat cooked 2nd felt being rushed little bit because servers quick cook all food before even halfway done first round meat 3rd didn't come dessert! staff wasn't rude anything though said food wasn't bad  Hopefully next time come back they'll fix those little things  <EOR> One newer Korean bbq restaurants town  love freshness ingredients  Meat quality point  added friendly service place 5 Star! <EOR> I wish more stars give! place AMAZING am super picky Korean food place probably best found!!!

chocolate ice cream end meal  <EOR> My friends wanted celebrate birthday friends  decided try 8 ounce  place brand spanking new  Very modern  heavy duty vents everywhere  But still heavy Korean BBQ smell   The food came finally   delighted good tasted  initially some issues them being able turn burner   but few minutes changed burner head way   The texture meat delicious   but dipping into

enough  husband says its best restaurant town I'd agree  ordered combo B spicy tofu soup best ever had  <EOR> Went during soft opening   The meat portion enough share between 2 opinion   We small beef portion side brisket   The experience them cooking awesome   I almost threw second last meat but can't switch meat anything  mouth didn't taste  felt bad ended giving majority meat friends only liked brisket   But fun experience   The money amount worth it  <EOR> Came group 8 made reservations Thursday night   restaurant tucked hidden location quiet plaza chinatown   decor inside really nice new   sucked table even though reserved 8 people gave table 6 another table 4   couldn't all sit together because can't move tables grills     We ordered large beef combo small beef combo 2 orders japchae 3 orders kimchi fried rice additional order pork belly   food came relatively quickly server did most cooking us   large beef combo came beef brisket rib eye steak bulgogi marinated short rib   short rib really flavorful tender   steak well marbled extremely juicy well   everything delicious   japchae tons veggies seasoned perfectly   kimchi fried rice little bland   could used more flavor ingredients     What sucked meal didn't know split order evenly between two tables   table 2 small beef combo which meant 2 people table 6 large combo meant 3 4 people   food ratio all wrong ended having share food amongst two tables   wasn't huge deal but restaurant could done better job separating portions  <EOR> Came second time  Quality superb well price bit steep but believe worth price  Combo B which pork belly some other part pork  Ordered 3 Sojus ended paying 100 before tips  Since provided genuine services ended paying 125 end  Food great atmosphere loud other competitor   heard special promotion going Thurs Saturday 10PM 2AM check come half off end  Maybe should plan come again those time period  <EOR> Another solid KBBQ joint opens Vegas   AYCE   relies its clean contemporary decor tasty meat offerings win over   The name says all all portions 8 ounces combination 8 ounces   The menu simple beef pork cuts some marinated some not  No Asian delicacies such intestines offal   All ordered individually best value sets also includes some veg egg stew cheese fondue kimchi soy bean stew   Large selection well made banchan accompanies meal     In general beef quality ranges between USDA select choice OBV exception Japanese A5 wagyu short rib USDA Prime    Pork just pork  No special breed   Marinades tend sweeter side but very good once grilled eaten some spicy banchan     Top choices marinated big bone shortrib boneless short ribs outside skirt pork jowls pork bellies   Other selections KBBQ standard   Service definitely work progress   Take full control  Don't ask questions place order let server know cooking   Service improve service conference improves   Lunches also served  sampled however menu shows number tofu hot pots soups stone pot bibimbap all reasonable prices $9 $11    It's solid effort but does topple best valley   end quality flavor side dishes overshadow quality KBBQ   All together agreeable meal but carnivores purist beg better quality sourcing     A place KBBQ noobs those wanting interactive date night  <EOR> In town annual convention came across new Korean BBQ restaurant   Thankfully accepted reservations     Located Chinatown area Las Vegas 8oz Korean Steak House offers great variety meats other Korean dishes   much competition Korean BBQ differentiate themselves others quality beef   The interior decor
