We wanted badly LOVE place     love idea pick window little food court     ordered Scallop Po Boy Pulled  BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich Fried Chicken sandwich all sides Baked Beans Cole Slaw   slaw seemed made order which left unseasoned little bland fresh though    name Amber's smoked Vegan hoping smoky flavor meal somewhere hoping baked beans    fresh tasting but unfortunately smoky bit bland liking    sandwiches     Po Boy excellent    did add more sauce pickles when home roll huge needed lot food fill it  scallops which lightly fried hearts palm INCREDIBLE!   wanted more!   yum!    fried chicken sandwich looked amazing but straight into garbage disappointingly    looked gorgeous delicious    texture patty good palates   sort deep fried mass  I'm sorry      Third item BBQ Jackfruit   sauce good   sandwich good great  Jackfruit tricky     loved bun gluten free but tend fall apart making sandwich kind hard eat     overall great effort all other folks line super excited new vegan spot    would definitely Scallop Po Boy again but others    want give another try love concept just sure if price back    certainly hope review helps want place succeed grow Las Vegas vegan options  <EOR> I love idea place!  Sadly actual experience kind mixed   If omnivore looking gateway vegetarian cuisine place might you    To food neither serious  barbecue nor great vegan cooking  Rather occupies strange middle ground *products pretend meat *   In many cultures meat typically ingredient dish comprised many other things e g  rice beans flavorful sauces etc  vegan versions foods *context* which fake meat happily camouflaged  Mexican food good that! All across town Asian Indian cuisines offer many meatless options roaring flavor with no need meat substitutes all    But Soul Food different  Large servings meat stand own main course  much more challenging thing duplicate vegan form  therein lies problem   Amber's gone great visuals over authentic flavor  pretend chicken actually looks lot chicken but doesn't taste anything all chicken   big hunk fried veggie protein kind odd texture   The ribs also look ribs but don't taste ribs all really don't *feel* barbecued anything  no char no crispness just sweet syrupy sauce   Which brings only real complaint  No smoke   For place smoke name decided lack smoke flavor anything tasted including Smokey Barbecue Sauce    doubt anything actually wood smoked  disappointment   So A+ effort but maybe just wrong type food vegan Ize  honestly think would enjoyed food more if each item hadn't visually presented something raising then dashing expectations    Even though didn't love food giving three stars filling interesting  niche local food scene   If need your vegetables look meat you'll happy here   For mostly creative culinary curiosity but Im likely regular  <EOR> This place wonderful! fried chicken delivered thru post mates still hot arrived! cole slaw killer way   Definitely recommend  <EOR> I excited food definitely disappointed  Can't wait back try more things! <EOR> University Commons Center AKA Internet Cafe AKA where most businesses start AKA Campus Commons next Kang Thai AKA Kaba Curry's old spot AKA old Wing King spot   Got it?

I took stars fish mystery ingredient menu aftertaste mac cheese  But know love return add stars when deserved  <EOR> My food super cold when came  because waiting back  made order friends theirs faster  Rather probably cooked awhile ago just plated  reheated everything gave back but wish hadn't even gotten it  super bland  All three tried everything plates ribs sausage po boy fried chicken cole slaw Mac cheese beans rice almost everything significantly under seasoned bland  Way expensive shitty food  down street Panchos Amenos instead   Also food didn't look anything those initial photos  <EOR> You guys basically cried while stuffing face all vegan goodness  dad hardcore southern smoked grill master thing missed much    Everything much flavor reminds being best dive BBQ south  ribs great texture sauce fried chickn batter incredible first mac n cheeze isn't weirdly sweet dear lord those greens die for    Yes weird location  Yes no means healthy  But best damn vegan southern soul food you'll Vegas  <EOR> This some amazingly delicious food!

Corn bread amazing loved all 3 bbq sauces   They soft menu now but still big   Selection choose from  can't wait try all other yummy food have!!   And Amber awesome sauce! sweet helpful place gets 2 thumbs me <EOR> I visited Amber's week Memorial Day excited try new vegan spot Vegas specializing southern bbq   rating business 3 5 stars because some improving do    Apart review should still Amber's try food because great concept   I ordered 2 entrees first fried chicken entree cornbread greens mac cheese pictured    vegan chicken delicious fried perfectly   give two medium sized pieces which very nice  don't know if chicken seitan but great texture tenderness   only other thing player good cornbread which could little larger but perfect sweetness texture well   need back cutting room floor when comes greens Mac cheese recipes   greens bland needed some more seasoning bring dish life Mac cheese flavorless  didn't high hopes start Mac cheese because even when omnivore white folks could never win over Mac Cheese recipes Lol vegan  actually good would little harder  cheese sauce no flavor even hot sauce bbq sauce helped  basically tasted if eating noodles flavorless sauce    The second entree tried kids grilled cheese sandwich French fries beans rice   always try kids meal if see type quality they're offering children   fries decent beans rice good seasoned well but some bites little salty   grilled cheese made white bread which major letdown me   vegan restaurant shouldn't serving bread absolutely no nutritional value something known constipating children   disappointed that  could used better bread thought   cheese wasn't melted very well either   So all food tried only really liked 3 7 items   If improve they're seasoning some ingredients use would love give them 4 5 stars it'll just take some time testing there  <EOR> This place MIGHT good if you've vegan few years  However if you're giving vegan diet recently turned vegan stuff just horrible sorry    Cons The BBQ sauce overly bright flavor stays back your throat running drink wash off  chicken biting chewy fried sponge  However if maybe done bit thinner would improve immensely! Ribs pulled pork textures actually very descent but unfortunately ruined bbq sauce  beans extremely bland  also forgot corn bread all plates  delivery order without it  last con would pricing overall value ratio off just dollar two if drinks included could help section   Pros Mac cheese great even when compared non vegan options! food delivered still hot 10 minute drive   Food worth Snapchatting? Trying say visually looks amazing your vegan friends jealous  Overall young place tons potential but today simply friends  Unfortunately believe it'd require lot change before give another try recommend others  honest review before called competitor note far concerned no other vegan BBQ soul food restaurant area  <EOR> I dirty south jackfruit pulled pork sides baked beans macaroni cheese    Dirty South Smelled amazing  quick drive office challenging  sandwich good   the flavor actually bit overpowering but just took some jackfruit bread ratio great    Where meal didn't excel sides  Different people different things heard people praise some vegan mac cheese hated  going those times  color consistency tasted some mashed white beans but other slight flavor northern white navy beans didn't really taste anything just really bland     The baked beans similar just lacking flavor    However say when mix three together tasted good but wouldn't those sides own again    I work nearby sure again hopefully update review some increased stars trying few more dishes  <EOR> Excellent food! Love fried chicken all barbecue sauces  very tasty! definitely returning! <EOR> Heard Amber's through Vegan grapevine didn't disappoint! Ordered fried pickles fried chicken sandwich ribs fried chicken combo both sides Mac cheeze greens  Wish enough room left stomach fried Oreos next time sure  Everything flavorful prepared quickly great texture  definitely back soon! <EOR> The food delightful service great  really enjoyed variety menu variety barbecue sauces  portions also large   The food came reasonably fast  fish which surprisingly realistic quite good tartar sauce  unlike other vegan fish had  success  ribs quite flavorful come huge portions  made seitan texture little bit off  mac n cheese delicious considering much time vegan cheese taste quite sharp sweet  mac n cheese good texture did taste most vegan cheese does  closest non vegan mac n cheese had  baked beans good cornbread  wasn't crazy corn dog which yummy breading but actual hot dog more sausage  Everything else exceeded expectations   The service great Amber very kind asking questions wanting feedback answering questions   It's small food court other vendors nearby tucked away building Charleston  definitely back recommending place friends  <EOR> This place little hole wall food court  didn't see any sign outside but able find it  Since never way tried few different things  ordered Cackalacky BBQ ribs plate Cajun Sauzage Po Boy fried mushrooms baked Mac n cheese  Ribs something missed since becoming vegan amazing  Also cornbread coleslaw point  didn't care baked beans came both entrees  Sauzage again amazing  greens ok  love fried mushrooms ranch there  disappointment Mac n cheese  guess expected some crispiness baked Mac  actual kids menu most vegan places lack  did bring leftovers home other younger kids devoured everything except greens even Mac!
