I can't even begin say disappointed place  family coming into town called 'guest list'  girl answered said no cover charge girls long list  time frame 10pm midnight 10 20 I wanted avoid huge crowds   Also promoters sent text earlier day asking send message when arrived he could 'take care' us    Ok said arrived 10 20pm notified promoter contacted received text back saying all set just give name door  crowd wasn't huge yet no problem going right front line  immediately let guys know guest list 4 girls total he said we'd checked off would few minutes  we're waiting other girls groups gotten getting before us!! approached different security people promoters all just brushed off told wait    By time 11 00pm waiting almost hour patience running really thin  Girls getting left right free drink tickets just being ignored brushed off  11 30 hour half patiently waiting leave  texted 'promoter' short  text guest list crap   Just clear expected wait   it free! But NEVER expected treatment did  highly offended NEVER again set foot club  HERE!! much better clubs better staff better service  <EOR> Really great place! see fountains wonderful perspective  Just sure during day  nightclub <EOR> I would TOTALLY recommend anyone here  Yes music pretty OK but club absolutely nothing special!!! dark hardly any decor speak hardly any dance floor!!  They try push people buy tables at $500 only area left people dance basically small walkways which bouncers try clear of  Dude isn't sidewalk homeless person try shuffle away!! weird thing keep everyone separated own little cordoned off areas? ALSO seemed nice balcony facing water   which NO to!! only whoever pay most VIP area   Tryst Wynn super nice balcony area facing water waterfall accessible everyone  nice big too   I would really never Hyde again!!! <EOR> This review lounge club   Though really want come nightclub next time town   I feel place potential 4 star but can't good conscience give more 3   update review when service order   Let preface fact am relatively patient person when comes flaws service   worked retail know hard juggle customers   But complete lack service waitress just forgivable     We waited 15 minutes being seated someone come take drink orders   coming realization no coming flagged down server said he would take order waitress   waitress hanging all while came over bit confirm order pretend she doing something   The server came back drinks pretty long wait apologized saying drinks took particularly long time because something wrong computer   guess actually something wrong waitress     The cocktails delicious view just behind Bellagio fountains very nearly justified bad service   Note said nearly   The waitress brought check first round drinks promptly disappeared   wanted order another round but course she no where found   flagged down poor server again good sport considering wasn't job   But while waitress came over rather impolitely informed would pay first round before receiving second   Because course we're gonna jump barrier into fountains down second round right?  Well whatever pay cash expect change back sort tip   BUT WAITRESS DOESN'T GIVE BACK DIME   intending give 15% tip she took over 20%   bit taken back poor etiquette   After second round she gave check came back around 3 times check if ready pay 5 minute intervals   kind service this?!  Honey your big fake boobs only many tips  need learn basics service if you're going appeal ALL your clientele   last round tipped 10% then handed server helped extra he way door   know rude but if split difference between extra she basically stole last round consider bad service think justified   way live it   I wanted devote most space review talking flavorful cocktails amazing view is!

But definitely being able watch fountains enjoy view Las Vegas Blvd awesome!   The service bar good however just wasn't consistent friendliness category which why couldn't give them full 5 star review  friends received few drink coupons prior entering club bartenders seemed bit bothered processing weren't sure why since tipping top free drink  Anyways coupon house vodka believe champagne wasn't hard drink make  Nonetheless finished night tipsy enough remember great time overall  <EOR> I HIGHLY disappointed place  never treated badly Las Vegas life especially being girl    First all weren't even planning club but promoter kept pushing agreed give shot  only Bank Bellagio place sucks willing give shot  When into hotel stopped another promoter which guess promoter Bank he kept pushing kindly declined asked where Hyde located  point he EXTREMELY rude didn't help shot back some wise comments which inappropriate repeat stormed off    Since other female friend guy friend just walked front showed bouncer passes  He smiled told would right away  However right when he saw guy friend he asked if he said yes instantly demeanor changed told line  absolutely disgusted  never happen before never wait line into club Vegas before  Pissed off female friend different bouncer wished happy birthday it birthday weekend stamped hand let eventually  would NEVER recommend place anyone club wasn't even great anyways  <EOR> One favorite lounge spots Vegas! row seat view Fountain shows great people watching spot strip always great lively music playing  Just all around great ambience! Elegant look lounge romantic feel but service some times spotty   Some times bartenders drinks good but having two bars inside helps always find least good bartender back to   turns into night club atmosphere 10pm DJ elbow elbow packed little space dance   Overall look Hyde does always enjoy coming here <EOR> One favorite clubs Vegas  Big club energy smaller layout  Host bar staff awesome! booths overlooking fountains Bellagio if swing table highly suggest it  Tuesday awesome night industry locals <EOR> Located Bellagio small club  arrived 9 45 watch water show front row seats   windows open feel cool mist  views show amazing Paris background  Perfect place photos! must see!

Lose attitude  three other clubs much better Thanks but noooo thanks  <EOR> I swung Saturday night found every bit you're looking lounge club scene  Dance floor center easy reach bar  Lounge opens scenic view Bellagio fountains Paris Eiffel tower 'Juste en face'  Dancers liven place leading everyone feel vibe  DJ solid kept crowd rolling modern dance music  crowd good mix ages all dressed hip  10 12 easy lounge blend midnight turns heat becomes clubby  Vegas 3 star great review  know is    allot stellar clubs Vegas  But solid front back  <EOR> I private party  free buffet open bar  course made things even more enjoyable  LOL!  But must say location view best Vegas! right lake beautiful fountain shows front Bellagio  beautiful view Strip Eiffel Tower Paris  just can't views anywhere   The food exquisite! Fresh delicious perfect  made top chef   The drinks all high quality classy  place great vibe class without really being snooty   One thing didn't care several big screen TV's around playing sports  kind degraded whole vibe  wish played music videos something instead  just did away them altogether played music  volume good though  overpowering able conversations   The waitresses smoking hot!  could more friendly though   Overall great experience nicest clubs ever to  <EOR> I touch Hyde few weeks before myself group friends Vegas  VIP Host Tommy super helpful moment he replied continued throughout night Hyde  done table reservations bottle service plenty clubs Vegas first time realized awesome VIP host truly past even trouble getting them seat myself friends table reservation whereas Tommy right waiting checked several times throughout night   Additionally while Hyde tables average price compared other high end clubs Strip highly suggest paying little extra fountain view table  amazing able watch Bellagio fountains close only wish they'd continued going off all night long!  Our server Jessica think busser also amazing didn't without any point during night  Also DJ wasn't anyone I'd heard before but he great too  hope back Hyde next Vegas trip  sure! <EOR> I club  The DJs pretty cool small club million times better Bank   Hyde newer caters better looking crowd   The Bank let weirdo stragglers  The music just right   The Halloween parties incredible I Marilyn Manson excellent time !!! <EOR> I really enjoyed place!! last week most amazing view Bellagio fountain! huge place but its classy mix different music great  bouncers gave all ladies group free drink vouchers didn't pay damn drink all night!!!! <EOR> My favorite vegas club lounge  Beautiful view fountains great cocktails wines   really smaller cozy feel venue opposed all mega clubs popped all over vegas   definitely back soon! <EOR> Yes yes definitely more lounge   little disappointed lack opportunity dance   dance floor seemed center aisleway people kept squeezing through bar balcony   Plus right against and same elevation as table service areas when people dropped glasses dance floor      Although fact glasses could breaks speaks high quality air club     Most impressive all walking into club witnessing vision filling Bellagio fountain display just outside patio   breathtaking   Also addition awkward dance floor also no place stand chat bounce music didn't feel way!  The elegance place definitely won over though lounge appreciated ambiance  <EOR> I say new favorite club Vegas  again such fun night  comped drinks fantastic  I just love little performers walk around  Very cool costumes  The music night amazing  danced long feet begging quit  but nope kept dancing! Such great club  <EOR> Hyde those places spend hours inside when walk you're daze reality begins hit you   Aside being best place watch fountain show Hyde dance club 700 people usually line outside into  Or    lucky enough private event open bar until wee hours morning past 2 years   Drinks good bartenders super fast  Bottle service available but when dance floor packed wants sitting down? night progresses butts seats usually end being less less everybody great time dancing awesome music! If you're looking place hit while you're Vegas dance look no further Hyde  <EOR> Great view decent service interior very stylish  During earlier hours its more relaxing lounge its best vegas hotel  night when becomes club id recommend going elsewhere much better club options around  Overall recommended 3 5 <EOR> This very first Vegas club experience pretty good  Pretty pricey but Vegas    guess should've expected that  view Bellagio fountains EXCELLENT    We supposed guest list    but ended being two girls able free +a free drink ticket   boys however pay I think $40 each and no free drink ticket   regular cran vodka $15   It Tuesday night wasnt ridiculously crowded  thought pretty cool thing when buy bottle service waitresses come flashing lights big scene all way your table  wedding party going along all waitresses flashy lights put waitresses small like 6ft boat bouncers carried boat walked table huge bottle Dom  something different ]  Their dancers very interesting outfits  Maybe because Hawaii don't kind over top stuff but seemed very Lady Gaga ish  can't explain it   dancers later stopped dancing walked around giving free shots just gotta tip them    Music great    Popular hip hop things hear radio type songs ]  I thought pretty funny handed stacks cocktail napkins did countdown everyone flew napkins air  seen balloons confetti    first time seeing napkins! <EOR> As mentioned tip early before 9pm avoid cover actually sit table! around 7 walked right in  main club area seems pretty small but weren't anyway  right open area balcony located right behind fountains able seat front center watch fountains    This located 2nd story which gives really cool perspective watching fountains  even feel spray water which hot Vegas evening refreshing  did stay until 9 then left making transition club scene  pretty sure would kicked table anyway long way bottle reservations    Cigars fine enjoy only cigar ash tray though  If someone else gets before then tiny ash tray is  super expensive but drinks worth it  yummy  Overall early enough nice place relax enjoy show  <EOR> 1 star having bell person open door pretty girls  I nooooo idea where start review because although never loungey part Hyde think would prefer lounge aspect over nightclub  view Fountains Bellagio just pretty such crowded area old guys hitting young gals sorry older yelpers For those into EDM nightclub lounge you'll probably want hop next place your list  <EOR> I would say club great but never in  friend invited 20+ complimentary drink vouchers  two 21 YO's strip naturally ready turn down but bouncer rejected ID saying wasn't me  would recommend Hyde hire some bouncers girlfriends knows girl without makeup look like  clearly haven't seen female when eyebrows wasn't fleek  ridiculous airplane ID can't into club  Anyways if you're invited into club sure bring two even three forms IDs  Maybe even bring your birth certificate good measures because they're clearly vision impaired  <EOR> This place disorganized  arrive crowd people if club taped off crime scene everything trying see what's going on  guest list most crowded area some people waited hour guest list  Probably figured they're paying let's them wait   guys working entrance just stand around just stare crowd  guest list said wasn't But decided party going pay $40 person waiting long  Come find guest list but tried rip off friends  If free drink tickets ladies prepared bitchy bartenders not all them just blondes especially very short hair shaved side   wouldn't even recommend bottle service because club small  Plus sides great performer its open overlooking Bellagio  gets crazy crowded but because open walls hot sticky  2 stars entertainment club design  <EOR> Sexy club  10 girls getting free free bottle  pays girls vegas  Love view here  <EOR> Saturday 4 8 17 terrible DJ  club would've fine if weren't him  playlist all over place no cohesion whatsoever  He'd play Katy Perry DMX Michael Jackson all within 2 minutes  <EOR> This place pretty fun amazing view over looking water club life off wall  girls all over place pretty crazy! dressed lady gaga type attire just very amusing stare at!

Front row Bellagio  fountain show facing Eiffel Tower across lagoon  Upon walking truly impressed but overall experience great mainly because staff rude   The bartender acted  he begotten gods he doing favor serving 15 dollar cocktails he such condescending rude attitude  Later night private party coming taking balcony facing fountains told move away very rude dismissive way    Music point everything fun place but people working need reality check start acting capable decent  customer service <EOR> No surprise  this another over rated club already slow touristy Las Vegas  entire club catered vip tables only  Similar Drais only stand near over crowed bar  <EOR> I gone few times over years but last year August privilege working Justin he made experience much GREATER!!
