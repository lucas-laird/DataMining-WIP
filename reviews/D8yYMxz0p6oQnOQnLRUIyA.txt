Shanghai noodles barbeque pork amazing   love dim sum cart different choices  <EOR> Most dissatisfying $75 meal life  roast duck overly salty noodle dish bland limited ingredients  <EOR> The food average    AT BEST   As everyone else mentioned Taiwanese beef noodle soup good  but $18?! kidding me? understand vegas high prices but just absurd  juicy pork dumplings pretty gross vegetables good but then again hard mess stir fry veggies  Again though $14?! Ridiculous     absolutely ridiculous pricing even Vegas you're getting  effort take extra walk somewhere else <EOR> Have meaning give place review      Probably worst restaurant experiences   I came late dinner first day into Vegas since we're staying Paris  When seated honestly took almost 20 30 minutes acknowledged server  ordered drinks took another 10 minutes show up  placed order food took almost another 30 45 minutes  saw several tables around just left because no taking order  When received soup given plastic containers  clear looking ones hummus dip grocery store  asked hot sauce server gave sweet sour sauce  Under impression hot sauce poured lot into soup just o disappointed really was  spoke manager lack service felt only ones received plastic containers having looked walked around she didn't seem care anything say    With dissatisfaction even hotel front desk being total rewards member wasn't pleased service received restaurant  told would inform F B director but yet receive feedback    If love long waits horrible service then place you! <EOR> I shocked bad place especially because looked good always crowded  concept great dim sum carts rolling along lots noodle dishes mostly Taiwanese    However end dish good any decent Chinese place San Gabriel Arcadia Cal nor did setttle well    Besides being super expensive eight bucks per dim sum over 10 small bowl noodles    but spent entire next day off porcellin throne    And wasn't just  friend Yong Kang same problem   I reall wish better  But FYI    Las Vegas great Chinatown good dim sum carts weekends great Cantonese BBQ Seafood places dinner  also excellent Korean Vegas  Chinatown only 10 mins strip   Bon Appitite  <EOR> I lured dim sum carts    actually noodle soup checking menu     I decided Taiwanese beef noodle soup   delicious   meat tender noodles beef broth complimented each other nicely   added chili paste heat but didn't need flavor   I used Yelp check in enjoyed Taiwanese iced coffee free    sweet strong!!   Great place people watching    enjoyed dim sum previous visit also delicious!! won't disappointed <EOR> Slightly overpriced but expected because restaurant inside Paris Las Vegas Casino  both ordered Taiwanese Rice Noodle Soup BBQ pork Duck   Each bowl Noodle soup cost around $16 50 not including tax tip    The ambience place nice clean which personally enjoyed  Everything looked new decently clean   The service also very quick  ordered  within 5 minutes food came out  rush worked perfectly   The taste food average tasted huge scoop sodium msg scooped into soup  both finished water later felt sodium effects mouth   Overall scenario arrived restaurant around 8 10pm immediately seated hostess ordered finished eating 8 40pm  able 9 00pm Britney show next door Planet Hollywood!  I probably come back unless only place open rush something    I don't anything exceptionally good say place other quick service  only thing lot sodium food which quite unhealthy  Maybe just ordered bad dish    <EOR> Attentive fast service compared surrounding restaurants  soon sat down approached wait staff drinks dim sum  Entrees also turned around quickly  Also Thai Tea Vietnamese Coffee which quenched thirst hot 100 degree weather   Overall food par any dim sum Chinese bbq restaurant San Francisco Bay Area  <EOR> This reasonably good dim sum spot strip  Selection very limited but most acceptable  xiaolongbao didn't enough soup wasn't served hot  Everything else acceptable quality   Food 2 5 5 Service 4 5 Decor 4 5 Value 2 5 <EOR> Went bacchanal but 2 5hrs wait!! Decided check joint out instead since hungry   place def 2 stars best   Service extremely slow because werent trying but 2 waiters place size crazy   dim sum good but very pricey ave taste   soup dumplings super thick skins chili dumplings barely and meat pan fried dumplings bland   would not recommend This place keep om waiting ur fav spot <EOR> Pho waaay salty covered sprouts   Lots breasts though  Chicken feet good   Pork dim sum good  Crab shrimp dim sum good  Sauces good   Help sketch   Lobster fried rice worth it   bowl pho $18 where $8 bay   Unlimited soda   bad but needs improvement  <EOR> The food pretty awful here  Shanghai style noodles bland flavorless  just boiled some water threw some pepper called day  soup dumplings mediocre well  tiny flavorless barely any soup  service so so  Chinese person embarrassed people come thinking Chinese food  Take out better this  Save yourself some money eat elsewhere  <EOR> Sigh  Even worse typical casino Asian    I ended because checking Paris pretty meh IMO interested dim sum concept  advertised 20 varieties 'and perhaps means sum total existence restaurant served 20 kinds  Because when visited 6 things egg rolls wontons shrimp tempura sesame buns etc  YAWN  picked chicken egg roll served barely warm but tasted fine   For dinner chose tonkatsu ramen pretty terrible  broth off tasting used sweet BBQ pork tough gristly added sweet corn? Wtf? combined very odd indeed  think depends when visit because saw photos where regular pork used  seemed thought well gnarly ass leftover pork let's use because girl won't know better     Now might thinking well did expect ordering Ramen French themed casino? would right dumb move  stupid order ramen fact order any food because good   What good? Well wine prices bad Vegas pour strong  Service great really attentive  Still unless you're craving essentially Panda Express steer clear  <EOR> Taiwanese beef noodle soup delicious   waiter suggested soup end night because simmering all day soup base yummy   He right  <EOR> Food good waitress could more attentive   soup dumplings awesome  <EOR> The past 36 hrs some worst life  friends Vegas bachelorette party having great time until decided stop here   First hostess uses Dim Sum overpriced draw then gives menus trying pay average $20 low quality entree  finally Dim Sum requested tasted ok great  rest night next morning all sick  Food poisoning destroyed entire day ruined rest weekend  <EOR> $19 99 beef noodle soup ?

Tasted really fresh delicious  menu says pork but also contain shrimp advised  also dandan noodles chicken did them quite bit  Never dandan noodles before nothing compare but spicy flavorful  chicken just shredded white meat added top noodles but plenty sauce keep meat being dry   I'd say skip dim sum noodles fulfill your drunken carb cravings  <EOR> Just needed!
