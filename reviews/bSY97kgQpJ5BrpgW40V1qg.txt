I highly recommend visit if looking Steakhouse try  <EOR> FAMOUS FOR Steaks  BUZZ Prime Rib  I TRIED French Onion Soup 7 10 Bone Rib Eye 2 10 Sauteed Mushrooms 5 10 I once flight saw someone left Robb Report magazine seat back pocket  flipped through saw listed 7 best steakhouses Vegas astonished when even mentioned Circus Circus  mean actually redeemable decrepit place? read find actually won some kind award saying best steakhouse all Vegas  Wait    WHAT? Come again? Circus Circus   THE Circus Circus? Circus Circus  way off strip thousands smelly kids and adults swarming mobbing all over lobby taxi lines hallways? Circus Circus best steak? No F ing Way! few years wanting but probably 5 times Vegas since reading article nobody wanted go  time finally chance!  The menu very simple  quite few seafood options crab legs oysters lobster tail etc  but place called The Steakhouse feel those sort obligatory menu items  No idea taste  Pretty much menu STEAK very few appetizer side offerings  Asparagus? No  Creamed spinach corn? Nope  Mac Cheese? Psh! if! seafood accompaniments sauteed mushrooms  Period  So   pretty limited choices   All steaks Vegas decent but all great  I'd prefer Morton's SW Carenvino Delmonico Cut GR Steak sure missing couple others  actually hoping Circus Circus wasn't good because if good means may need trips way steak now on  Well    FRENCH ONION SOUP Not normal appetizer but considering limited choices only made sense  pretty decent  Presentation kinda cool bowl served plate some extra croutons cheese shreds cute little heaps  Seasoned well onions cooked well  probably I'd call textbook French Onion Soup  good but nothing really made unique special  just good French Onion Soup   RIBEYE Here goes  presented ok  cost steak comes your choice potato  steak looked healthy decent spots char all over  start cutting piece ended finding 30% piece fat  fat most seasoned part steak also pretty delicious  Normally cut off but hey Vegas! most seasoned part steak bite should stellar   but   no  fact hardly any seasoning all!  You couldn't even fathom disappointment! If any kind special mesquite flavoring didn't find it  meat decently tender can't really complain any its technical aspects i e  medium rare just asked but taste just BORING! Nothing inspiring nothing savory nothing   good! bad! mean nothing going this! no news good news  steak no news worst possible news! restrain myself asking A1 but did end sprinkling some salt it  did taste better but anytime add salt fact doesn't taste right  disappointed probably left 1 3 it  taking scoops mashed potatoes each steak bite try add seasoning somehow  tried everything  Nothing worked  just gave up!  It pretty bad steak   not worst ever but definitely worst $50 steak ever had    MUSHROOMS Well certainly better steak while tasting halfway decent wasn't anything special  If TGI Friday's Outback Chili's batch sauteed mushrooms I'd found fitting but if paid $7 them and pretty small batch I'd something little more creativity!   INDIANA JONES STEAKHOUSE DOOM I really really upset! mean even though free company paid which should taste even better couldn't believe waste money place was  Considering $20 $30 roundtrip cab ride having swim through roaring and smelly sea children parents mile exaggerating there's more steak see did there?     Either A reviewers all full sh*t B C cooks because can't imagine establishment could gotten high marks anywhere    Thankfully now know don't EVER Circus Circus again! If you're curious person then probably need just say you've tried conquered it  Otherwise if you're solely mission try actually good food  Skip place! <EOR> So first say work MGM Resorts company owns Circus Circus    However most people live tourist destination eat close home   Tonight Dad's 77th birthday   He's meat potatoes guy made reservation Steakhouse Circus Circus     Even though voted best Steakhouse Vegas many years haven't eaten   say   incredible    13 yr old son rib eye asked if could come more often     New York Strip incredible    husband Chili Glazed Salmon awesome    staff incredible   Server Relu worked 26 years incredible!    private room seats small party perfect ambience   Dad couldn't better birthday!

I only once life returned food order  prefer just come back avoid making fuss  However time literally feeling unwell ingesting overdone subpar meat mixed hard gelatinous fatty stuff did severely regret sending all back kitchen   Not sure happened here  Perhaps waiter took immediate dislike small party which included young child sent worst steaks he could find inventory   However other reviews mention flavorless steaks   In short Steak House needs seriously rethink approach being steak house  meantime would avoid all cost  <EOR> This solid old fashioned steakhouse really great MANLY ambiance   Everything tasty relatively affordable got  couldn't finish meal which rare no pun intended    Did blow away? No  But  OK! <EOR> A true hidden gem Las Vegas   Given fact Circus Circus past its heyday premiere resort many people write steakhouse off such  However serve best steak Las Vegas   The staff fantastic every time eaten food always delicious  Lots care taken sure everything just way want it  example able pull off filet mingon cooked well done normally considered heresy steakhouse   arrived table just tender filet mingon cooked medium rare  Thats testament quality meats skill kitchen staff   Check place next time Las Vegas  <EOR> This steakhouse lovely gem hidden inside Circus Circus    Atmosphere Dark elegant  Felt time warped back Mad Men era  Sat nice big booth friend  Atmosphere perfect having nice dinner conversation    Food Drinks started Bloody Mary  least favorite part  just didn't taste any different someone pouring tomato juice splash vodka glass  expecting something little more  ordered filet mignon dinner  absolutely delicious    Staff waiter very charming professional    I'm giving place only 4 stars because location  difficult find inside Circus Circus Bloody Mary less stellar  Aside I'd again  <EOR> This hidden gem Circus Circus  Aged steak perfection see entire preparation meal middle restaurant  Portions pretty large sharing may option couple  Fresh oysters very tasty large selection wine reasonable prices  entire meal empty wallet GREAT PLACE! <EOR> Man gem  Never knew there  said prime rib cooked perfection serving size HUGE  service also great newest server working 27 years  return sure next time Vegas   <EOR> Value+service+delicious food=5 stars  When husband wanted try Circus Circus Steakhouse told he must crazy  way prissy eat Circus Circus  But took team sure glad! Now eat almost every time Vegas! Yes pay $50 your meal  But unlike other expensive steakhouses your dish come salad vegetable starch  I suggest baked potato all fixin's  Most other steakhouses la carte once add salad sides your $50 dish become $75 dish  value there   I say if broiled steak may enjoy charred flavor steaks  burnt flavor just different broiled steak  actually prefer crab legs over steaks  HUGE plate King crab legs come completely split half length wise meat ready you  A variety breads brought your table all amazing! waiters all super friendly water glass never more half empty  Highly recommended! <EOR> The only reason isn't 5 stars because steaks good but great  classic Vegas steakhouse ambiance great staff service  Best french onion soup ever sides plus salad included great deal  Steaks prepared over wood fire  nice flavor  Great place eat  <EOR> So sad steakhouse gone down grade meat   gone being best rib eye ever just good steak why why changed your meat ? twice past couple years everyone said amazing time heard ok much flavor melt your mouth steak year ago   giving 3 stars place inside nice waiters great but steak same year ago hopefully someone responds telling decided back old cut meat !

First off upon walking read podium dress code smart casual Yelp says casual   I definitely casual worried under dressed   glancing others around restaurant definitely dressed smarter casual many others   Maybe smart casual 1980's?  Next wine list   drinking Pinot Noir steak   quick glance showed around eight choices red glass believe all California wines single Pinot Noir   settled Cab Sav she Merlot both fine both cheapest wine glass $8   I ordered Rib Eye medium rare she NY Strip medium   mashed potatoes salad she wild rice salad   Both came asparagus though menu didn't mention any vegetable    salads came both excellent   Steaks came 6 8 minutes finished salads which great knew would hot off grill   Mine cooked medium rare but seemed overly charred outside but may just large fat trimmings   more medium rare mine but she didn't send back   The problem both steaks dryness total lack flavor   good steak cooked perfection should able cut butter knife two $60 steaks chance   very disappointed   didn't want insult chef ask steak sauce added little salt pepper didn't help   Maybe off night us?    The side items fine service excellent expected water recharged often   Though sometimes server filling water glasses would carried away pulling water bottle down if doing magic trick water would bounce onto salad dinner plate   stop gimmicks just pour water please?    Dessert tiramisu which outstanding   check $155 tip $185   much better two steak dinners well under $100   Sorry Circus Circus won't back  <EOR> Being 32 year old millennial always wished grew old Vegas see place definitely it!  Being seated Matre' D decades pretty cool   atmosphere great exactly expected Steak House!  waiter great! steak come little over done but made 10 fold bent over backwards trying right    food delicous wine list great!  Def Recommend Steak House! <EOR> Here's all meat  Service ambiance side dishes just okay great  although black bean soup excellent   and don't even beans!   But anyway   who cares those little things when steak GOOD?? humongous New York strip delicious  crispily charred outside pleasantly chewy inside  BF's filet silken beefiness! Melted mouths!

 OK more constructive Don't put spices crab meat ruins it  Don't put bacon everything many people cannot eat  wild rice overcooked extremely salty  Everything salty  fish cooked correctly  sautéd mushrooms tasted weird  Canned perhaps? asparagus OK but simply cooked  Microwaved?
