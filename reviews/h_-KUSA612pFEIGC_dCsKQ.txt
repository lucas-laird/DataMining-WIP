I know Baja Fresh definitely Tex Mex but bad   course runs gamut other similar chains Chipotle Zaba's Rubio's   All different but all somehow same   One big plus Baja Fresh tasty salsa bar!  salsa bar tops salsa freshly made bar clean quite selection   Besides pico de gallo smoky roasted salsa pretty point me   just everything   mango salsa another favorites sweet spicy   We eat eyes Baja Fresh definitely provides lot color food   order looked bright fresh!  Thankfully items tasted such Baja Burrito steak melted Jack cheese fresh guacamole pico de gallo Baja BBQ Chicken Salad fresh greens kale onion bell pepper jicama tortilla strips roasted corn black beans tomatoes topped avocado then tossed BBQ dressing  I Baja Burrito addition romaine lettuce big hearty!  Heavy burrito stuffed good amount steak guacamole   pico good burrito made even more tasty addition extra salsas tried little each!  Tortilla warm freshly made   Wifey liked Baja BBQ Chicken Salad she opted dressing side   used sparingly gave salad sweet yet tangy kick   She also liked adding some pico jalapeno salad well   The great thing Baja Fresh just any main order bag chips too!  Honestly salsa bar much more fun   We haven't visited Baja Fresh while forgot large to go plastic cups only pay 99 cents soft drink refill every visit   know home must least half dozen them!  love making some Coke fresh lime refreshing   Keep eye mail coupons Baja Fresh come quite often   meal great deal think used $5 off $15 coupon   Lunch came only $14 change discount   Value added!  I particular location Boca Park clean crowded employees friendly   Viva Baja Fresh! <EOR> It's OK  seem fast friendly  reason why giving 3 stars due fact all cooks left kitchen same time while food cooking stove  When cook came back gloves still removed put new pair before touching food again female followed  Now super nervous because back awhile lady register put order bag few words cook finally came back  very unprofessional!! Never leave kitchen!! Also bathroom dirty disgusting  don't clean it  disappointed place especially since Boca Park  <EOR> Great experience  food fresh staff helpful cheerful place clean    The salsa bar good selection including two types peppers  also offer sliced limes  Glad checked place out  back  <EOR> Wow! coming last two years  reasonable experiences   Today though whoever charge ordering kitchen seriously fallen down job   Tried order steak shrimp bowl  No steak  Ok ordered something else even though really looking forward steak   Then salsa bar  god everything liquid state! even asked happened salsas  response gum   WHAT???? you're saying lack actual mango veg runny mango salsa because no gum? smoky brown sauce runny water because no gum? tomatio salsa runny because no gum?  I thought Baja Fresh's motto everything made fresh  Why earth would any gum?
