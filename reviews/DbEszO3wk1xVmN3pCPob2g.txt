What waste!!!!!!! never return place fell love long ago  5th visit awful want ever return! First off saw food sitting window long time course COLD! friend didn't even eat entree when awful waitress picked full plate food she didn't even ask if anything wrong! ended paying entire bill because friends waitresses believe karma still left lazy no good waitress $5 tip!  Our Irish skillet awful only ate few bites  pot o bread doughy fully baked! Even hot water hot tea warm! Really?!?!?!  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!  Never again!!!!!! <EOR> We're visiting town   didn't want eat breakfast strip decided try Jamms based reviews  outside isn't much look but don't let fool you   Amazing customer service   Friendly staff even better food! kids some specialty pancakes waffles   California eggs Benedict   Everything delicious   Great prices too   highly recommend  <EOR> I'm usually disappointed restaurants but continuous rave reviews legends Pot Bread think expected little more meh    I into Jamms open mind immediately struck prices  Over $2 hollandaise? $2 75 coffee? Almost all entrees least $10? Jamms least providing large portion every full size meal order  However light wallet decided stick small plates menu which actually quite good value    For $4 half Smores waffle complete honey chocolate chips marshmallows  toppings great hard screw chocolate marshmallows all  However waffle shockingly stale  Every bite took seemed if getting harder harder chew until eventually having hard time even cutting waffle into pieces  Luckily chocolate honey masked almost tasteless stale waffle  Still good sign   Next $5 chose option Reuben Benedict supposed fan favorite take typical eggs benedict  your typical benedict english muffin egg hollandaise  version however replaced Canadian bacon some corned beef  Thank god eventually tried normal egg benedict ham chewy cold  signature menu item fell flat  english muffin strange rancid taste corned beef lacking both amount flavor  While Canadian bacon might worse taste least better value!  My girlfriend Bananas Foster pancakes while personally didn't try them she commented poor quality bananas insisted IHOP version superior   Finally ultimate disappointment $1 95 Pot Bread  thing Jamms known for  thing excited thing heard much companions  unfortunately thing sucked most  ended cinnamon raisin pot but expanded bread top stale difficult eat  such small pot amazed struggle  simply tasted old wondered long sitting kitchen  only soft part very bottom surely wasn't much around  cinnamon doesn't add much but shudder think tasted without it  also tried some peppermint Pot Bread while remarkably better may because outlandish amount frosting coated bread  Pot Bread may worst $2 spent all month quite frankly free bread Outback far more flavor actually consumable    Jamms fun attempt trying something new but breakfast foods hard right especially such limited menu  service great but hoped bit more  Instead left wishing gone Denny's  <EOR> I don't even words express great place is  Sandy waitress excellent despite packed restaurant  decided sit bar avoid wait staff quite exceptional  only service remarkable food fantastic!
