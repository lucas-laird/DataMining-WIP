But sure charged them  entire staff looked didn't know doing  cashiers talking bad people cooking back blaming them taking long getting food out  Then more people started asking food seemed workers getting upset because she started shouting order numbers  tone voice could tell she upset  Definitely coming back one  know customer coming back means nothing place but hopefully someone reads understands need train employees better  should also set intercom system instead shouting numbers out  <EOR> This mc donalds always dirty poorly stocked dread when craving fries since walking distance  <EOR> Horrible service  Understaffed extremely unclean  strip location far worst seen  need remodel stop being cheap  Waited 20 minutes sandwich wasn't even correctly made <EOR> Horrible service extended wait time while workers converse once two orders taken cashier disappeared five minutes ladies restroom leaking water all over floor  When notifying manager hazard ignored  <EOR> They ran spots free lunch WVC but luckily McDonald's 5 minute walk conference center Mandalay Bay  Consistent food service would receive any McDonald's around world which course aim  <EOR> The restrooms closed hour cleaning but say customer service given cashier named Dewayne ? impeccable! He professional well speaker attentive during breakfast chaos! ran biscuits can believe that? but Dwayne quick jump resolution! He's definitely asset place  If business Vegas I'm only visiting would definitely put front!!! Great job guy even when your restaurant deserves 3 made give 5!!!! <EOR> Doesn't any better Big Mac fries Sprite 4am night strip  <EOR>
