Honestly am contrarian cheap either  But despite some glowing reviews absolutely could recommend smug overpriced strip mall restaurant    With many people saying many nice things tried few times but through  food good  better chain restaurant even some independent shops  But blow away definitely worth bloated prices  service people job but certainly don't feel welcomed  atmosphere stark crowded uncomfortable    Like Italian trattoria food prepared kitchen overlooks dining room but warm summer Vegas night temperature dining room least hot outside  Warm summer nights aren't occasional occurrence surely there's way deal that    As another Yelp reviewer said place would better can  wanted love place but many better alternatives impossible recommend  <EOR> My wife came dinner tonight  inquired osso buco waitress told takes 45 minutes reheat no thanks  eggplant parm $23 wife salmon $26    dinner came side penne pasta sauce   came tiny oval dish  penne overcooked falling apart sauce acidic watery  came around grated cheese which accepted  busboy dumped tablespoon cheese glop top watery sauce which made kind cheesy paste  eggplant multi layered seemed good scraped off two cups same watery sauce   wife's salmon seemed baked broiled  lemon butter sauce mostly lemon uninviting  Including two glasses wine dinner $68 plus tax tip came $86 50   price expect each entree side top notch  won't back  <EOR> Not kid friendly all     Food alright but price    charge 10 bucks split meal!!! u kidding me?! <EOR> This restaurant would better can   Italian cafe strip mall  supported locals real sense neighborliness   want better turns be   owner original Piero Piero's near convention center turns oversized portions Italian classics unexceptional   When reviewers rave big portions doubt credibility food critics   Give small portions really high quality food any day   compliment offer pours wine glass some good options very generous equal glass half any other restaurant   If someone wanted wouldn't say no but wouldn't look forward it   more thing waitress charming! <EOR> This place awesome!  Friendly staff most important amazing food   Started off some calamari prosciutto fresh mozzarella    Main course Chicken Marsala some side pasta   Friends Chicken Parmesan which gynormous!  finish off cheesecake tiramisu   Cheesecake good but tiramisu hands down best ever tried   perfect ending meal   Get off strip cab prepare wowed  <EOR> The menu gift Piero genius whose restaurant Convention Center Paradise set benchmark Italian cuisine Las Vegas  He also chef came table say hello paison friend Giovanni  don't know exactly it shakes but believe Piero sold rights name cannot use commercially  Because really Chloes his  food best Italian ever had  Take grain salt  Italian   Veal Marsella Potatoes Lyonnaise House salad included diced artichoke hearts asparagus baby corn  vinaigrette salad dressing was amazing espresso spumoni dessert  pricing moderate  Dinner for two dessert came 75$ tip included  We're George rounded to $100   read other reviews am surprised found food just adequate  Piero chef until someone asks build Italian Ristorante  If show stout grey haired man agreeable disposition running kitchen stick around  You're treat  <EOR> some best italian seafood Las Vegas   the appetizers homemade cheesecake tiramisu also die for  the chef Piero founded Piero's then sold when popular  this place busy but no busy and  great cozy dinner any night week  they always numerous delicious specials <EOR> I visited 4 years rack lamb rememberd!
