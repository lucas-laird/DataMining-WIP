Another major complaint   I 4 margaritas which tasted more sugar water lack tequila  drinks overly sweet very little alcohol  unless you're planing taking shots drinking beer   I don't recommend any girly drinks    On bright side electrical bull funny watching people riding bull  also live band which awesome! <EOR> What FUN little country nook heart strip!  came nice hearty meat n potatoes dinner unaware cute cowgirls country dancefloor!

Onion rings good too  Service ok parents fried fries cold <EOR> [This review solely bar  only drank here]   Gilley's Saloon may over top but  else would expect country saloon Las Vegas Strip   quality experience matters casino bar   Gilley's known primarily hosting bikini bull ridin' its mechanical bull Thursdays Sundays 10pm    applaud them showmanship   Vegas runs skin   putting skin bucking mechanical bull draws crowd   They other nice touches drive home country bar feel   Bar stools replaced saddles stir ups your feet sure don't topple over many shots    There's country music dance floor gets going some nights   drinks served casino prices which little high your average country bar but you're paying real estate  drinkin' strip ain't cheap      All all ain't bad bar just little overpriced is   Unless bikini bull night    just good time  <EOR> Just place  Service poor employees seen arguing  Food good great atmosphere County Music  <EOR> Service embarrassing! Honestly reason because buy free drink  Last night way see Michael Jackson Cirque show thought let's drink before Lyft ride  female worker rude  no wonder place empty  waited waited then moved other end bar waited waited unlucky female server obviously miserable life  embarrassed husband still tipped her  Hope she picks some marketable skills age finds job she enjoys   The show awesome! <EOR> Went watch football game  Sound playing entire restaurant but only playing TV  Waitress refused change channels other 8 TVs visible  Poor POOR service  Waitress attitude well  <EOR> Slow service mediocre food   Pretty much sums up   thursday night waited 15 minutes table Noticed when sat down lots open tables apparently short staff   assistant server drinks right away but then took another 10 minutes server show up   both ordered half rack ribs which touted fall off bone   your choice sides both slaw grits hubby fries   Both meals came tiny mean tiny corn bread muffin   BBQ all done all serve it   Took almost  25 minutes finally server found meal rather wait folks doing actual serving   ribs barely warm hard rock meat did certainly fall off bone   slaw no flavor neither ate much it   grits tasted good but consistency wallpaper paste   Hubbys fries cold when arrived   All all very unsatisfactory meal don't recommend pace anyone  <EOR> Food gross  Ordered pulled pork sliders brisket filet both we're unappetizing dry both took 2 bites each  Now ask why didn't send back? waitress nowhere sight bring silverware let alone gear complaint    Save yourself time money elsewhere   yuck! <EOR> This really good   Came Mystere show pressed time    glad took chance!  Brisket outstanding!  ton food!  beer Alaskan Amber draft! <EOR> Came lunch today lazy walk blistering heat  While cool spot Strip people watch  service lacking  food took forever come ordering easy dishes salad wraps  While waiting food overheard waitress gotten orders wrong two tables around crossing fingers wouldn't happen but  Lord behold she order wrong! Another 15 minutes wait side order corrected  girl needs some serious training   One star location  star yummy catfish salad  <EOR> Went Cav's game June 16 2016  seated right away   Staff kind  Elizabeth waitress point food amazing  Chicken Tortilla Soup house salad fresh awesome   Later piping hot French fries quite amazing    only unfortunate thing spent more beer food   would definitely recommend! <EOR> Good bar strip didn't try food   both Wednesday Thursday   karaoke cowboy really cheesy but people made night fun   band Thursday Ryan     something great!  Definitely bit pricey but over top   staff pretty friendly except male bartender goofy glasses   Guess he having monthly?  husky blond female security guard more personality whole bar boss!  good when New Frontier but back  <EOR> Again week Jan 14 18 2018 great service Joanna Alex Jacklyn quick food quick refills greeted smile Ireri hostess stand great view Strip People Watching    Yuge Quesadila Yuge pretzel both filling    Worth visit esp nights bikini bullriding Staff super cute friendly ! <EOR> I'm sure atmosphere night being rodeo type bar strip but around lunch time very mellow  Ofcourse there's rodeo type paraphernalia all around restaurant! Now know bar que spot but since biggest fan BBQ salmon   food simply amazing! think very picky eater because there's plenty things don't like   But every last thing plate greatly enjoyed   salmon delicious!  sides cream corn mashed potatoes jalapeño cornbread   Each those amazing own right   wanted order second plate just could more later  But didn't want seem greedy plus room didn't microwave it   boyfriend ate BBQ he seemed fairly enjoyed it   sure why isn't Gilley's LA if matter but am sure every time find myself Las Vegas Strip where eating  <EOR> Nice big place  Drinks reasonably priced  karaoke  Put first selection  can't song  swear words  Put substitute selection can't song  drug reference  can't any songs swear words drug references sexual lyrics  sorry fuck city am in?  So no sex drugs swearing allowed your song selection  bar where waitresses strut around bikinis chaps  Songs gun violence apparently fair game though   Decent bar really lame karaoke  <EOR> The service piss poor bartender did know simple drink   Don't waste your time money  <EOR> Fun place dancing music good big dance floor funny seeing drunk people bull expensive drinks pregame before   10 00 entrance but walk stamp also walk your drink but can't bring any back inside  <EOR> Glad decided salad  Packs punch flavor slaw works better then regulars lettuce salad   <EOR> We best experience last Saturday night food outstanding well service ! sever much fun very accommodating well Brad manager !!!!! see Band awesome     Overall experience 10 definitely coming back !!!!! Thank Eileen Reider San Diego <EOR> I refrain writing much just list issues A rudeness hostess B long wait food come C cold food brought table D overpriced quality E stalled bread F lack attention care waitress <EOR> I really wish would quality restaurants TI place would good place starts  Very mediocre BBQ when factor paying almost $20 pulled pork sandwich which tasteless even fries terrible  Maybe should stick entertainment beer because food terrible  <EOR> I tried bar restaurant while staying Treasure Island Vegas   place located inside hotel but also two parts   place touts itself place Hooters theme cowgirl twist   Basically servers dressed bikinis chaps serving food drinks  kicker though only seem work back side place where bar dance floor area   If looking probably should ask seated part restaurant   funny part if you're entering inside hotel  area walk into   the actual restaurant looking place located walk down past part which takes actual front part place which also enter street side strip   servers wearing cute little jean shorts black halter top shirt   when actually ate part restaurant thought odd advertising chicks walking around bikinis serving food when none actually working part place   wasn't until left saw those severs working bar dance floor area   Maybe stricter rules attire front part establishment since Vegas strip?  Anyways food review   I southern style fried chicken butter whipped mash potoates coleslaw   good meal lot food   hostess checked told 15 minute wait but also made note look down waiting list literally saw name   She recommended sit bar no wait which did   Funny because when panned around room quite few empty seats   I think she just lazy actually look seat honest   Good thing didn't tip her   bartender dude nice enough pretty quickly   manager also checked saw if liked meal which did   end wrong bill but tender caught mistake gave right one   However when checking credit card info few days later double billed bill wrong one   Still waiting see if wrong bill actually gets charged account its pending   Overall food good hostess could use some work tender cool except mistake   If you're specifically looking servers wearing bikinis chaps back end restaurant inside hotel   If want eat front you'll more cute country chick serving food  <EOR> Would liked eat but somehow although over half bottom restaurant empty people front seated immediately  told 20min wait  good way show prepared patrons wanting eat  left course  <EOR> Why would bunch Texans Las Vegas country western bar? don't know but everyone else seems loved giving two step lessons    I myself am big country music fan but appreciate it  Plus fun see guy friends' twirling girls around dance floors  Sunday night which pretty slow   The best part bull riding bikini contest  bikini gyrating mechanical bull forgiving all  definitely see all jelly  Yikes  Anyhow good 10 minutes entertainment    I personally wouldn't back because scene  But if country music might place strip  <EOR> Love music service good   Food Ho hum   ten gallon combo also brisket filet   Flavors ok   Too much 'Gas Charcoal' cooking instead mesquite wood flavor   So food tasted drenched gas   <EOR> This pretty big bar   looks country bar huge dance floor space which assume line dancing regular dancing decor all around mechanical bull saddles used barstools bar area  really uncomfortable but whatever   The bucket beers cheap that  good conversation but goodness  service sucked  First sucky moment when walked in didn't know where mainly because no host entrance  took few minutes someone show where bar was  next sucky moment when accidently spilled beer haha  boyfriend quick clean ourselves but bartender gave major attitude messing bar  Seriously dude? asked help   cleaned ourselves  Vegas sure drunkies way more worse stuff cleaning own mess  jerk   Overall bad service  cheap beer elsewhere many places Strip! haha  <EOR> We hit Gilley's while killing time airport  ordered bbq chicken breast green bean casserole baked beans  exactly three stars shows A OK  wasn't bad but wasn't something would order again  very mediocre green bean casserole absolutely no flavor it  am decent bbq critic sauce chicken thick overpowering    The service good place bar plug your phone  made location all more worth me   Again give try but I'd opt buffet instead  <EOR> This cool place country music some line dancing but  where ends  place practically empty  stood bar five minutes  money hand wanting drink watched bartender constantly walked without acknowledging left  Screw place spent hard earned money elsewhere  <EOR> It's 1st night town saw bbq appetite led Gilley's  That'll last time listen asshole    I'll admit most part find country music insufferable unbearable right off bat didnt line dancing shit outdated TV's showing late 90's videos overall decor  said hoping food would more it    My 1st disappointment came when saw didnt offer Shiner Bock  country bar should freaking Shiner Bock  Trix ordered some specialty drink came small plastic cup yeah $13 Bud Light  ordered ribs Trix pulled pork burrito  Well Gilley's let down ribs fatty barely edible garbage  only saving grace good fries    All all 2 worst meals Vegas Vegasly overpriced  reason 2 stars fries Trix liked burrito  <EOR> I enjoyed Gilley's enough back two nights row during Vegas trip  because some great amazing bar? No because its only country bar's strip aside Toby Keith's     The dance floor good size band pretty good  few people knew line dance but weren't exactly friendly  am best teacher but able help few people some steps join fun   It would nice if someone staff could help people try learn  necessarily someone teach but someone people follow    The DJ really nice very open requests    The drinks standard but would ask bartender come something own   She just rolls eyes seems annoyed  Plus drink she made terrible am only though so  Maybe she just having bad day? guy bartender Eric Alex? nice quick drinks though    It doesn't seem promoted enough gather other country fans  seems its just casino bar people gravitate towards when nights almost over they're headed back hotel     I back if cannot find another suitable country bar but research first find other options  <EOR> Visited restaurant portion Gilley's during trip Vegas NFR  Great service  husband split chicken fried steak more enough both us  Food really good  Typical high prices expected strip but overall great experience  <EOR> good food little pricey casual american dinning but still good  plus bikini bull riding sundays no cover <EOR> Terrible service pretty typical bar food  walked around dinner time sat bar  took 5 minutes before acknowledged cranky bartender  Obviously she having bad day  menu pretty limited  Overall bar only bar food    much more  <EOR> We ate twice trip   Really good food good quick service   little pricey but most Vegas is   If BBQ good place eat listen music  <EOR> Excellent baby back ribs  Creamed corn terrific too   Came afternoon easy relaxing meal   Excellent service too!! <EOR> Didn't chance eat midnight stop serving food becomes bar  cool but looking some BBQ  Would nice if said before paid $10 cover charge    did give refund!! Nice  <EOR> Food delicious maybe little over priced  very country   Service nothing talk very slow  Waitress forgot drinks second round   Nothing spectacular write  Gave 3 because food pretty good  No need To return  <EOR> This five stars Johanna kindest bartender ever  She made feel home ease very long day  Kudos Johanna being such great sport! Thanks  <EOR> Every time come Vegas Gilley's  food usually pretty good but time much  Granted only 5 pm when eat but food tasted sitting hours fresh  ribs which always loved tough dry  hope fluke but definitely did live expectations based previous visits  <EOR> Let's see friendly attentive service big portions solid comfort food nice view nightlife insanity street dine   Count in     Lots bad mediocre reviews Yelp but good experience   server right top things   At $19 cowboy burger no bargain   But big enough two semi hungry people share well cooked delicious   fries great too   I also strongly vouch kid's chicken tenders which came huge vat mac cheese   tenders indeed extremely tender tasted terrific   Plus mac cheese might best thing table   Incidentally kid's meal big enough satisfy your average Vegas tourist fattie but menu specifically states 10 years younger order kid's menu    bad because would no qualms ordering particular meal myself   Still first wife stole early often daughter's plate   The drinks really weak   don't think own personal pet peeve when say weak drinks suck   Everyone hates weak drinks   Overall good grub lot it   highly doubt would special trip just eat but would definitely return if staying Treasure Island  <EOR> If you're local must come down Mondays your $1 drafts BOGO drinks! All show your local ID bartender hooked up  came late Monday wasn't very packed really no dancing going just DJ playing various types country music  loved saddle seats bar just chilled there  only complaint place closes way early 2 am started kicking around 1 30! least let finish drinks because just here! Definitely stop before 1 am otherwise won't long before getting boot  <EOR> $17 50 gross nachos taste crappy 711 nachos  Didn't even use real cheese  Give break    no wants goopy fake cheese prices   On top service horrible  Drinks took 20 minutes ordering them  Don't 48 oz drinks despite coming cool boot glass  very little alcohol filled before even getting food which took additional 25 minutes waiting 20 min drinks arrive    Prices insanely expensive everything get  menu sound good but reality left disappointed getting order   Won't ever back  <EOR> Outrageous baby backs!  Atmosphere service drinks pricing all rated top shelf   Forgot ribs could good tough find Wash state    sides also delicious green bean casserole tater puffs   Only down side meal wife's sides mediocre  she pulled pork bbq beans bombdiggety but mac cheese corn muffins tad below okay   Highly recommend! <EOR> Fun place   Best green chili  ever   lo carb options nice   Friendly accommodating staff   Great setting   Wish did lunch seating outside because cold   But otherwise awesome!

Loved music location ambiance etc  But would say food itself all other aspects just average  ordered classic margarita 2 5 stars half rotisserie chicken 3 5 stars    A plus did seem cheaper places strip grab drinks especially during happy hour! table ordered just regular sized drinks realized great deal would large boot cup sized drinks! believe only $14 dollars so    great value  would come back Gilley's next time visit Vegas because fun vibe conveniently located  However would definitely switch ordered! <EOR> Atmosphere nice  Great views while eating! Food okay chicken friend steak green bean casserole cream corn really good! huge fan chipotle chicken sandwich though  Ribs good but some parts tad bit tough  <EOR> I came because wanted try Spicy Deviled Egg appetizer   sounded good because love spicy foods Deviled Eggs thought would perfect  those places confuses salty spicy  only way could eat take most filling   happy paying $8 00 dollars this  husband ordered Bob Wills Burger Jack Daniels BBQ sauce Guacamole Pepper Jack Cheese it  tried some   and good but worth $15 99  Personally think Western Bacon Cheeseburger Carls Jr  more worth while  think paying atmosphere   but couldn't even carry conversation because music loud  wasn't normally prefer because chat during meal  <EOR> The waitress very rude  party seven asked them if would sing happy birthday  She very rudely told don't that  Then wouldn't let eat birthday cake there  party over plans ever return  <EOR> Hey! Let's joint! ended Gilley's because nobody group could decide club  Monday night almost nobody iin except some creepers chatting bikini clad waitresses   The dj played top 40s every often video screen would country song video  wish played more country music definitely mood 2 stepping!

Mashed potatoes made real potatoes but horrible boxed mix  BBQ ordered funky bitter taste  only good thing chili corn chowder  server nice enough replace mashed potatoes another side  worth price! then bar area where friend rode electrical bull   and fun! fun seeing other people country dance ride bull  low expectations  <EOR> We stopped drink something light eat around noon Saturday  No drink menu margarita tasted Sprite  Best part pregnant waitress wearing same bikini bottom chaps football official shirt rest waitresses  Surely could give pregnant woman something little better wear??  It gets 2 stars though because pork green chili pretty darn good  Totally unexpected rest it  Just enough kick without being overpowering good flavor  <EOR> Not worth it!  food below average service bad place anything special   would back   many great places strip waste your time rinky dink establishment   drinks pathetic   Waited refills   husband wait new pot coffee which took 10 minutes   extra staff gets water etc joke   Unfortunately no choice give 1 star   place big 0! <EOR> I buffalo wings appetizer which bigger expected really enjoyed them very spicy  bf buffalo chicken sandwich said pretty good but he thought blue cheese bit much   For drinks paradise punch strawberry daiquiri   The paradise punch pretty strong tasted pretty good daiquiri however pretty weak but super yummy  Staff very nice service fast  I'd eat again  <EOR> Went last night family line dancing karaoke  waitress point great! line dancing coach showed 30 minutes late coached 2 obscure songs probably never hear again life  started karaoke      really just song night djs friends  same 4 5 people sang 3 4 songs would only let few others sprinkle very choosy allowed songs  actually told song slow list next 3 songs sang even slower rejected on  Two people group amazing singers told throughout time other patrons amazing yet jokers wouldn't let them stage  waste  place great location great gimmick but ruin it  clue  <EOR> This place alright  most places TI little disappointing  food isn't bad but no means great well stocked bar  Beer selection OK but could highly improved  usually stop drink watch game if staying hotel just because convenient otherwise wouldn't way visit  <EOR> Very fun bar just downstairs hotel rooms Treasure Island    Good drinks fun line dancing few drinks   The only reason 4 stars 5 drink prices  Otherwise great time  <EOR> This should really 3 5 but round up  beginning shakey  husband fell STARVING 4 mile run   We around noon  hostess said we'd wait 20 minutes yet plenty empty tables  husband peered head into restaurant he hinting fact noticing open tables  hostess then spoke explained few waitresses break she couldn't seat anyone those areas until returned  decided wait   The hostess accurate estimation  it just 20 minutes before taken table  another restaurant Vegas offers street side seating  love people watch perfect me  ordered blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich salad  Oh my   was pleasantly surprised! best sandwiches ever eaten  good! husband tried agreed which surprising because wasn't fried  He fried fish guy all way!

know lot other types BBQ am sure am biased because fact born raised Lone Star state but hard time accepting BBQ place doesn't brisket least offerings  Aside disappointment having brisket food did definitely anything special  started off Texas nachos must felt need word TX but just nachos we're sad version them that  can't take your nachos seriously when melted cheese liquid poured can  BBQ ribs side mashed potatoes corn bread we're decent very best  may visit bar again some point but definitely eating elsewhere  <EOR> I wanting check place while wound Friday around happy hour friend visiting   bartender did serve service smile   He asked wanted drink   When asked specials he responded didn't hear second thing he said asked repeat   He seemed truly annoyed put this   guess when mix overpriced drinks drunk tourists don't really smile tips?    The happy hour deals weren't great 3 dollar drafts extra shot your well drink which regularly priced   There's big dance floor stage live music mechanical bull   Seems place would pretty fun night but won't way check out  <EOR> County bar Vegas style!! waitress only awesome she pretty  live band too  If line dance lace you  nice size dance floor  also food till 10 during week sure weekends  blast even though don't line dance  <EOR> Worst service ever! don't expect watch your football game even if ask! waitress bartender could care less customers! <EOR> I wanted enjoy bar some ways did but couple things disappointed me  came really wanting dance but only music offered live band wasn't very good  Would preferred DJ  also surprised people everyone seemed closer middle aged  Kind weird  Considering young single would liked hang around people age  bullriding fun but keep mind costs $10 per person ride  didn't any food cannot comment  Also no cover charge  Overall place lot potential  Just rid band advertise younger people  <EOR> Not bad! Gilley's cowboy restaurant Treasure Island   My sister chose place Sunday night watch Warriors game  near Fashion Show Mall just wanted place sit down some drinks   They happy hour menu until 10pm select cocktails $7  ordered midori sour wasn't bad   I pretty full lunch still side mac cheese only $4 99  sister friend ordered sweet potato fries comes sweet marshmallow type dip really delicious! highly recommend ordering it!  I saw sign Gilley's line dancing here! sounds would fun if you're into stuff which LOL  This wouldn't really first choice bar dinner place but just happened vicinity lazy walk anywhere else  just okay  <EOR> I am limbo Gilley's  love country music enjoy people watching tend care where enough drinks Gilley's would seem perfect place this  might enough drinks prepare sensory overload but just felt place    The drinks definitely Strip price  cocktail waitresses clad bikinis chaps way around floor rather often  aspects turned off most signaled cut off when friends ordering drinks girl ignored brought drink anyways  planning leaving soon wanted sober but sale more important wish  happened few times Strip main deterrent  why avoid  touristy attractions  <EOR> Firstly food excellent veggie burger husband cowboy burger both actually big finish but both delicious  Secondly hostess male waiter both excellent  Thirdly price somewhat comparable all other restaurants strip paid around $50 two burgers two sodas  restaurant pretty busy but didn't chaotic feel which good can't speak bar attached pretty chaotic   only issue visit waitresses such awful attitude very rude obnoxious only but many other customers  put complaint manager whom very apologetic handled complaint both professionally sympathetically  Therefore believe still deserve 5* review! <EOR> This place definitely OK best would say much expensive kind run of the mill western place real barbecue fanatic did find place amazing <EOR> Sure shit wasn't expecting see THEE Mickey Gilley here  Just never expect see Ronald McDonald Colonel Sanders Popeye joints   As soon walked thought accidently crashed Geriatric Ho Down  place bouncing Silver Foxes getting down dance floor  Well damn howdy course were live music performed Mr  Gilley himself!  We basically stopped Urban Cowboy mechanical bull but wasn't getting any action while Gilley stage  if come your ride may allowed if live music dancing happening  Would love back some day bucked off bull  <EOR> I would give place zero starts if could  Bartenders assholes  What's local shit?

I'd getting few hours before Bikini Bull Riding otherwise you'll miss table aren't many available  <EOR> Ok long story short came tonight CES looking cool place  entertain clients  food meh service ugh just bc your half naked doesn't give pass     The only redeeming 1star band  Kick ass  picture female singer she fantastic     only reason stayed  We'd come back them far everything else 0 stars   It's Las Vegas service should perfect  <EOR> Disappointed  baby back ribs overcooked didn't much flavor  $25 expected better  Mash potatoes good  food picked can't comment atmosphere restaurant  <EOR> On recent trip Vegas folks all Gilley's because group decided barbecue  mad Gilley's   While atmosphere definitely parent friendly prices outrageous Vegas Strip standards found St  Louis Spare Ribs little dry  also tried boyfriend's fried chicken good great  mean c'mon fried chicken hard mess up  impression sides really star show  especially enjoyed potato salad mac n cheese   To top off mediocre experience waitress charged boyfriend's 2 separate credit cards twice! splitting bill she managed mess two times row? hell!

Best value there  <EOR> Awesome time vegas  food great entainment awesome  <EOR> I Gilley's twice past absolutely loved it!  Always recommend friends stop burger drinks!   I recently Vegas Superbowl 02 4 friend lunch drinks   Ordered appetizer drinks burgers   bee landed burger told waitress happened   She took burger showed manager   assumed would another burger credit bill   Neither done!!!  bill $19 burger ate less quarter of   When asked why  nothing done she said manager said no   horrible management horrible service   No customer service!  sure never back send anyone else there   Learn need treat customers respect correct problems that!!! <EOR> Went Dinner around 7pm   wait seated could find hostess   When he showed seat he looked he totally did want there   Waitress friendly very nice   Good great   pulled pork sandwich but bun bread piece garlic bread   Mac cheese bland creamed corn watery   Not favorite place <EOR> Got kicked last night because waitresses irrational fear since she affair ex husband while married  Trust girl divorced loser don't care anymore  She complained management friends kicked out   it  did exchange looks words all  Even ordered bar she wouldn't wait us  think  pretty unfair  could understand if friends making scene causing unsafe environment but none took place  extremely disappointed because male bartender think name William awesome  Very polite great service  He made drinks perfection! going order food but told another customer wasn't very good    and judging other reviews food glad didn't  Also even told if she no longer worked would still welcome back  Ehhh Stoney's better anyway     just little further house  <EOR> What liked 1 pulled pork burrito tasty 2 let charge phone bar 3 strawberry shortcake la mode served biscuit instead sponge cake pretty much amazing   What did like 1 Waiting 15 minutes table when half establishment empty 2 server telling Shiner Bock even though gentlemen seated right clearly drinking it 3 same server middle management goons trying rush door ignoring fact still ordering beers food 4 girl seated behind didn't wear belt  underwear   To summarize     Gilley's Food = bad you'd guess  Gilley's Service = Worse could expect <EOR> The food surrounding perfect southern fried chicken spectacular ! enough wife   service great   Disregard saying weren't scantily clad outfit   serve parents kids  place perfect don't walk bar ever want   Oh beer COLD ! <EOR> Came leaving Koby Keith bar last night  Place seemed lot more alive lot bigger  Big dance area drinks didn't really kill your pockets  mechanical bull also which cool  few TVs playing sports good band  assuming place better more alive because its access strip  would probably recommend place over Toby Keith if first impressions  But try both again update review if anything changes  <EOR> After suffering through two meals other strip restaurants stopped lunch watch NCLS game  Once seated game only twenty televisions  quickly requested game turned closest television  Next thing see all TV's tuned into game    Then food arrived oh great surprise huge side salad scrumptious burger kids enjoyed macaroni grilled cheese which fine dining experts subject    All all great food great staff  refreshing surprise others places  <EOR> This review just bar dancing area  Haven't dinner anything over yet   Pros If early ish before 7 30 8 fairly easy table especially earlier week  Waitresses also fairly attentive again earlier week better   No cover! hate hate hate paying covers  also pretty good drink specials  I never floor when crowded dance  certainly come across your typical drunk chick doesn't know she doing type dancers but overall room away those people squished against person next you   If table next bull only easy access dance floor but great people on bull watching night progresses   Dance lessons M F 7pm    Music reasonable carry conversation your table volume  Cons Can loaded tourists which feel animal being watched zoo while dancing   maybe just issue though  Everyone tourists regulars waitresses etc  walk straight across dance floor which generally know fairly bad etiquette  When floor empty isn't biggest deal but turned during dance nearly taken bus boy walking right through line dancers    Floor so so fairly sticky far dance floors go    Overall Gilley's  older more appreciate more laid back loud charging everything under sun being slammed into barely conscious club girls vibe getting more more difficult find here  Keep mind kids allowed until 10pm which may bug people but never many kids there  think general family friendliness part keeps club crowd away take it  <EOR> Yeeeeehawww well wait worth food   Sorry Gilley's <EOR> FALL OFF BONE RIBS   Amazing brisket   Hot staff  Great price drinks   What's people? <EOR> I dressed down dress code restaurant  side restaurant other half bar where mechanical bull   free anyone brave enough ride it  Not really fried chicken lover probably eat once twice year   I mood theirs yummy huge portion! It's located right front Treasure Island entrance gets blocked every hour due Pirate show right front hotel spectators block doors  Show ends 8 12 minutes bad I'd check em again next time  Vegas  <EOR> The decor really nice convenient location strip  drink decent give large serving  <EOR> We came lunch while staying TI  admit being disappointed wait staff just regular folks  Where all scantily clad women plastered all over pictures web site??  Anyway service mediocre but really enjoyed food  fried chicken came lava hot really great   Took forever check because apparently there's only person working run credit cards some reason but eventually allowed leave! <EOR> Stale dive bar tries hard Ordered combo platter which includes pulled pork ribs corn cob corn muffin fries   arrived just when opened around 11am but surprisingly food tasted old sitting awhile   fries cold didn't reliable crunch factor yearning for   wonder if just took leftovers Buffet tables   only thing decent pulled pork   entree costs whopping $26!  Definitely worth money calories     Also service sucks!  Older Male Bartender really snippy Oscar grouch true @sswipe     If you're staying Treasure Island I'd recommend Canter's Deli  <EOR> Got dragged see hear some band   first timer   Service non existing sat table over 15 minutes no waitress site  Bathroom 1 toilet urinal  Guess no 100 plus patrons ever use bathroom   Prices $8 beer   like really?   Conclusion another fine tourist trap strip  Poor service outrageous prices all fluff zero substance  A shame  <EOR> Truly UNIQUE nightclub!! Las Vegas all sorts stuff all types people all over city if you're looking cowboy club place you! Gilley's place never crowded!! waitresses bartenders perform excellent job even beyond that people care satisfaction customers like taking pictures them   music gives great mood place country videos put also match club  also very cool mechanic bull  Every single time Vegas must least stop place! <EOR> I want give 3 1 2 but just quite 4 stars me    We did wait couple minutes which no big deal  Once sat gentleman thought might waiter asked want drinks well sure 3 waters  needed some drinking all day    Few minutes see guy walking around but no waters weird  Finally he arrives water says waitress      okay starving now start trying BBQ sauces keep myself busy minutes passing just bad service Wynn left 20 minutes no service lol pretty good if waiting just start dabbling those   Our waitress now taking order everything really great   Huge pretzel amazing burger perfectly cooked medium nice toasted bun asked  sister also house salad which very big great flavors especially field greens  Check breeze too  I thought prices high but seeing tasting disappointed   I'll back again just hopefully little quicker 5 stars all day  <EOR> Had great lunch here   pulled pork sandwich came great smoked flavor wasn't overpowering drenched sauce choice which sauce wanted table  Loved coleslaw sandwich nice acidic crunch elevates sandwich flavor profile   sandwich big enough 2 people share portion meat very generous   My husband ordered wings said nice crispness outside   sauce good  He never wing appetizer many wings before once again portions plenty    We thinking getting nachos but when saw them come table next changed minds   portion way big   end lunch glad didn't order them because 3 big burly guys did couldn't even finish them  We greeted manager when walked he seated table   Oscar immediately drink order Isabella waitress delight   Made sure ask chef if bell peppers chili husband originally wanted    She told she didn't think but would check anyway   Thank goodness she did because chef said he blends them   Which means can't see but there   Saved trip ER food allergy  Very happy lunch would highly recommend it  <EOR> I really enjoyed atmosphere we'll free bull rides!
