Who resist going place called Big Mama's Rib Shack ?  couldn't!  love some barbecue especially ribs!  Located near Rancho 95 excited try place!  ordered full slab ribs fried chicken dinner   ordered greens yams hush puppies macaroni cheese   Big Mama must've because she probably wouldn't approved quality food put day   greens yams macaroni cheese decent hush puppies salty fried chicken pretty tasty   But place called Big Mama's Rib Shack Big Mama's Chicken House   ribs such disappointment!  only teeth ripping tough obviously least day old reheated not very well    ribs most warm 85 degrees   I'm sure health department wouldn't approve     The fried chicken actually very good but does warrant extra star?  Hmmm   it's supposed rib place think not  <EOR> I convinced reading Scott D's review place misjudged previous yelpers  sadly mistaken  Perhaps spot year prior but absolutely anymore  sure could happen drastically year but place needs close some major changes immediately before Big Mama starts turning grave    When arrived absolutely no cars parking lot no patrons inside  reasoned maybe business slow 3 00pm considering 10 minutes off strip least glamorous part town   The windows covered neon writing advertising specials creatively mispelled fact  several references restaurant being Creole  If place Creole then talking monkey  place nothing but stop shop mediocre food low budget strip club across way classic hood entertainment    The menu expansive classic sides including fried okra mac cheese collard green etc  variety meats including pork chicken ox tails links sandwiches    We ordered fried chicken mac n' cheese BBQ sampler white meat chicken link rib fried okra   ordered front counter reminiscent McDonald's seated ourselves dining room found only clean tables restaurant which strangely enough only two tables tablecloths  booth fact appeared used sorting mail prepaid legal advertised menu  entire dirty roadside outdated tacky theme made wonder letter would if Nevada graded  Far down home momma's kitchen feeling anticipated    The mac cheese sophisticated Velveeta BBQ baked chicken well seasoned liquid smoke smothered tasty sauce  the okra fried chicken actually point no complaints  #1 criticism don't advertise baked chicken BBQ EVER  I insulted!   Last but least restroom tsk tsk   dungeon minimal light    perhaps intentional  <EOR> Big Mama tested three true life southerners Chinese chick loves soul food unfortunately failure  fried chicken drowning oil salty  day old cornbread weighed brick  ribs nothing shout home collard greens needed wrapped big slab salted pork any flavor  Come folks!
