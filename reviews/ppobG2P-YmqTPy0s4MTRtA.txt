Awesome atmosphere service food!  Ask Jared he's best server Las Vegas long time!  We recommend place all local friends back again soon <EOR> I recently visited Smashed Pig  first impression restaurant very clean hip  immediately greeted sat down  first item ordered Crispy Deviled Eggs  best thing ever ate!! main dish tried Bangers Mash  enjoyed sausages onion gravy potatoes good but prefer mash potatoes Yukon gold instead russet which use  Overall liked place back when visit again  Great staff!!! <EOR> Decent atmosphere  Stopped team lunch while only patrons when arrived service disappointingly slow  ordered shrimp salad  extremely heavy salad  shrimp encased very thick layer breaking smothered sauce point being soggy  greens decent but overly dressed  worth $13 price tag opinion  Also side fries which decent but again overpriced  <EOR> Great food friendly service little pub just east Fremont Street  crowd seemed ever slightly hipster but place located across street El Cortez expected  definitely return  <EOR> Was Vegas recently stayed el Cortez which located across street most fantastic meals long time shepherds pie delicious tasted kind always thought would Ireland whatever lamb tacos see all pictures great well friend burger said best he well next time Vegas hopefully soon returning fantastic 5 stars <EOR> Recently opened downtown Fremont Street great new spot some exciting food specials   Mini Yorkshire Puddings Meat Pie only when Chef wants them Bangers Mash Fish Chips!

Slightly hipster totally tatsty  slightly off Freemont Street experience well worth walk  <EOR> So hearing rave reviews place am thoroughly disappointed  ordered appetizers  Yorkshire popovers sound great but came burnt  Looking them wonder those allowed kitchen    only thing slightly saved dish onion gravy  also ordered chicken lettuce wraps  Those swimming sauce which more flavored oil served small baby romaine leaves faltered under weight filling  Maybe endive less juice  also ordered entrees  bangers mash pretty good  Natural casing bangers gravy tasty but mashed potatoes obviously boxed instant potatoes     worst burger ever came next garlic  sea salt fries  burger tasted cleaned grill since opening doors cheese almost non existent  even offered another slice cheese but feared would charged additional slice  fries tossed garlic salt would buy grocery store  don't know if cooks having off day smashed pig logo  Speaking cooks    no hats long hair beards galore    health code??? <EOR> This nice surprise given location   Food good staff super nice   Made feel welcome   Nice look feel inside reasonable prices   Knocked off star because lack vegetarian options   Everyone loved food  <EOR> Great Diamond Rough gastropub just past Fremont St  Experience  DT Vegas Fremont St  Nice selection craft beers tap several canned beers UK  There's pour everyone happy!  Their Fish Chips great! Most pubs over bread fish but delight! Totally recommended!  Chandler bartender she's BEST!! Good Luck Chandler!!! <EOR> I mixed green salad chicken lettuce wrap ahi tuna  new favorite restaurant! <EOR> Why every place serves burger Vegas thinks should charge $13+ it?  Some places burgers worth every cent them   rest group enjoyed other items menu three stars that   only recommendation would stay away hamburger  <EOR> Eh      honest place really didn't much ever!  cool spot give that  But call *British* gastropub?  really didn't feel anything British save Pink Floyd Led Zeppelin radio  Granted never England can't exactly say wasn't gastropub's but still      place doesn't ooze British all  ordered 2 cocktails gin fizz Cheeky Bugger  Both were     ok  I'd much preferred give money downtown cocktail room  Next ordered fried deviled eggs  good quite good  then ordered fish chips shepherds pie  When guy brought table he asked which bangers mash             Yeah    neither us  Mind he plate fish chips shepherds pie hands      Maybe your staff should know your menu better?  isn't very large all     Anyway    fish chips pretty solid    chips being star dish which kind sad batter fish bit under cooked  smashed peas anything but   literally shot glass size peas even close cooked all way very disappointing            Now shepherds pie god could any worse?  Now fair share shepherds pie sad  lacking gravy lacking veggies    shreds carrots no bigger grain rice  asked before ordered dish she said carrots onions celery   etc  *saw* carrots     it!  mash top decent but main focus should filling    meat ground small reminded wet dog food   accompanying salad decent but salad should never overshadow main dish  tend believe another yelper said dish microwaved    Which hurts heart especially considering front page website definition gastropub A pub specializes serving high quality food  microwaved shepherds pie high quality?  just high priced?  Yeah seems legit         then comes bill     Now absolutely ZERO problem paying good money good food service  But 2 cocktails appetizer two entrees    Including appropriate tip my wife server all total spent $80  me    absolutely atrocious!

Which guy seated told that  service strange order taken twice busser then waitress  Nobody visited table order then food  steak eggs $24 plate since most menu wasn't available  good  girlfriend ordered hash which 95% pork fat   This place just seems every employee does everything instead having specific job  Very confusing  Second time came even weirder  guy made order then pay first then said wait seated  bartender oh just sit wherever want did  She then brought water  currently sitting wondering if bartender also playing server tonight  <EOR> Great ambience perfect meet spot  yorkshire popovers pleasant surprise  Combination light savory bread perfect soup bowl  Spicy rock shrimp   delicious not spicy   Butcher Block definitely worth switch up  Tonight Slow Roasted Pork Loin dinner  Phenomenal generous portions!! definitely back  Service point! <EOR> To preface honestly think many Downtown Fremont area restaurants overrated  sure if people's expectations set low due area maybe they're used over priced strip fare semi reasonable prices increase ratings   This second visit we live nearby rating effectively combination two visits  start pretty limited very uninspired menu  Fish Chips Shepherds Pie Salmon Burger believe there's 6 7 entree options overall  Pricing bit high even considering tourist area  burger relatively compared similar places small bland  shepherds pie strangely dry greasy same time not sure pull off side note if really mood shepherd's pie Tod English Pub best around   Fish Chips pretty standard great but bad either   The strongest area opinion overall draft beer selection  only having 6 taps selection very well rounded offers something everyone   However truly inspired write review service or lack of faced last night  Certainly having your food take forever forgivable happens now then but when both server assume owner manager he british accent outright lie losing your ticket try playing off if nothing happened then intentionally avoid until meal essentially over absolutely something not   We noticed 30 minutes ordering table next came ordered 10 15 minutes us already received food two items table also ordered  another 5 minutes until server came asked order it's odd she wasn't concerned begin restaurant business would something would caught instantly   She insisted ticket still would ready any minute Well another 15 minutes later essentially every other table restaurant received order finally served  maddening hadn't even started food table right next kitchen good 10 15 minutes server indicated she already checked ticket no need concern   To matters worse owner manager expediting delivering food  Did he any attempt amends screw up? Absolutely not  Nor did server fact simply stuck heads sand preferred think never happened   Anyways when add everything together Uninspired food crappy service ignorant management ownership certainly won't back  <EOR> Far many adjectives describe place  Spectacular Fish Chips shepherd pie  just East Side Fremont Street  need put your foodie tour if way even local  Wonderful waitress well  200% go back list  <EOR> This place good service awesome  couple starters entrees bottle wine  Everyone cleaned plates and waiter didn't try sell wine  Always plus   All all I'd come back anytime  <EOR> The restaurant's interior modern classy  big bar entrance inside area intimate dining  smashed pig burger best tasting burger ever liked crispy onions   sticky toffee pudding Amazingly delicious! must if eat here! <EOR> Brandon server!
