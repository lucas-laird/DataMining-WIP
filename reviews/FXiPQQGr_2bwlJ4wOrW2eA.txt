Amazing food GREAT service Reasonable prices Wonderful atmosphere Nice views windows  We regulars now on!!! <EOR> Totally mediocre food   work event don't know exactly cost but guessing paid $100 per person   meal included bruschetta which bad lobster ravioli which blah salad which actually pretty good but light dressing more brought out   choose chicken rolvitini dinner which came 1 baby roasted potato blah   dessert served molten chocolate cake which came cold????  best part meal wine because planner picked favorites! <EOR> I underwhelmed food  Ordered bruschetta table  thought creative but didn't execute well two types tomatoes second eggplant  eggplant bit bland  might more flavorful roasted eggplant perhaps?   For entree ordered ricotta spinach gnocchi  gnocchi tasted just regular gnocchi couldn't detect spinach  tomato sauce average   the eggplant crutons clever but ultimately didn't quite wow factor  felt sauce could come bottle   And bit much blah sauce  <EOR> Spiedini hard find it way past all other restaurants dining portion hotel casino   its proximity somewhat depressing casino floor feel sad airport terminal food court  made work though   Service pretty weak  Waitstaff seemed resigned unenthusiastic  Beverage service erratic long lags some confusion  We're particularly fussy group but just did impress   The food actually decent  very happy impressed see involtini menu hard find Italian menus side Sicily   Specifically Breast Chicken Involtini filled portobello mushrooms spinach fontina cheese roasted potatoes fresh vegetables  delivered  prosciutto wrapped shrimp bad either   Overall food wine pretty good prices decent but wouldn't choose place any special occasions  <EOR> After reading Yelp reviews hesitant eat here  However wanted stay hotel doing Vegas half feeling some pasta order   Service hit miss  When attention waitress she fabulous  However did continually give discreet waves things   They mixed dishes somehow ravioli ended being lobster  waitress doubted but immediately offered replace it    I ended homemade pasta amazing  specials noodles well made prepared   The wine another story  know wines pretty well am still convinced 2007 Zinfandel Paso Robles  didn't replaced but wasn't drinking all day  impressed  cheap wine glass did improve experience  restaurant offers wine maker dinners would expect more  <EOR> Service good  Food quality fair  charged bill  all restaurants many better opportunities pricewise food quality  experiences all excellent  Thanks all hard working staff  lamb chops chopped salad favorites  <EOR> Went happy hour yesterday taste menu  Happy hour small bar  bar tender way much manage seemed slow night   would serve absolutely beautiful peaceful patio surrounded waterfalls lake full koi  best part offer stuck bar   But outside putting marginal food      the patio could food but enjoyed very much but why open your best asset?
