Everything fine until home fiancee sent off email restaurant com promptly informed waiter receives every penny 18% mandatory gratuity    In other words just left waiter 38% tip because he lied us   Frankly feel little violated  never shy tipping already intending leave few extra bucks difference we normally calculate 20% then round   shame because truly enjoy food wonderful evening dining friends  But can't shake feeling being lied being scammed  If Tverskaya don't bring restaurant com certificate  If bring certificate aware 18% going waiter website   After sure going back  plenty other restaurants town value business enough try scam me  <EOR> Very delicious food!
