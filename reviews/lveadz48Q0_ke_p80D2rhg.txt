If recall buffet? WHY Try some uniquely crafted Mexican food!  WHAT Firstly place absolutely gorgeous! dimmed setting chill atmosphere gave off great vibe   My friend decided try place because he fairly picky eater but isn't picky when comes nachos! When entered restaurant though directed all way spot corner  literally corner probably fit full sized square table right next where were  right made feel outcasts!  While seated waited menus realized table wasn't cleaned   couple minutes later server realized saw dirty table grab cloth clean with   then made orders   One servers came give water he noticed glass dirty well he gave new one  Thank goodness! love some water don't want any dirtiness water! X I tried Isla Sliders which included trio shredded pork beef barbacoa chipotle chicken sliders  all good but did notice dryer usual slider   My friend tried Isla Nachos  positive he loved them Although gave nachos three types salsa ordered LOL   try them well nachos way go!  Overall thought place just decent  Thinking if ever just eat again? don't think so  = <EOR> During mile long trek back hotel decided time margarita and when you're Vegas when time margarita   quick search iPhone's Yelp app turned little Mexican restaurant which serves some best Primo margaritas had  honest they're actually only Primo margaritas I usually opt Cadillacs Paco's but now all other margaritas hereby known Secondo margaritas  little beauties strong though prepared  Pair them some excellent nachos you've yourself party   Note regarding restaurant's name looks spent four years living Isla Vista without knowing correctly pronounce if memory isn't complete shot everyone said EYE la   chalk just another example typical gringo ignorance  sad ashamed  <EOR> Awesome   That's all say     I Chili Relleno   fully expecting fried gloopy most restaurants   Their take unexpected   and welcome   Roasted poblano split open all way basically bed nice sized portion beef filling   which spiced just right tomato slivered almonds   an interesting texture unexpected really quite nice!

As every restaurant might say strip best! But lets classify burrito worst ever had  say chips guacamole half decent rest meal failed impress! The burrito more Texas onion ranch taste it   looking more authentic but guess Vegas imitation! The service OK bartender more concerned she doing later night tip  The ambiance pretty good though great lighting good energy slot machines table!  Next time off strip find some real Mexican fare! <EOR> We never eat again   tried enchiladas carne asada tacos ceviche   Good grief   All 3 dishes tasted horrible   enchiladas smothered gross chipotle sauce carne asada tacos tasted awful ceviche way tangy     Don't waste your $$$ here   Save your pesos   Trust this  <EOR> Mmm tequila  steak pyramid super good <EOR> Chips salsa awesome chicken tortilla soup tasty three tacos combination great  waitress kind slow seemed little blank but maybe she having bad day  I'd definately again  <EOR> It's all MARGARITAS!!!

Maybe buzz maybe place f'n awesome  getting excited just writing review    Isla please open yous Chicago?! Pretty please  <EOR> While Vegas mom little sister decided take pitiful sad gulping shots   Given ended Isla's Tequila Bar taking shots drinking margaritas 3pm Friday   sure shot taking abilities improved but Isla did give chance try some amazing tequila mescal   selection fills thick leather binder most expensive shot going something upwards $50   didn't big money shot but did enjoy shot favorite tequila Chamucos which always excited see outside Mexico   Hispanic man large hat Mexican flag colored striped button down shirt sitting end bar added volumes experience   He wasn't being paid sit right guys? <EOR> We only beers nachos but very surprised find cheese type poured over chips rather melted  <EOR> Wife Isla Groupon price right   Unfortunately dining experience didn't live expectations  food very pedestrian unremarkable   Chips salsa OK neither amazing terrible  came fancy elevated stand which made things bit messy   I ordered some carne asada tacos which pretty much just meat tortilla without any other trappings  didn't taste bad but aren't something would ever seek again   We shared queso fundido which basically just melted cheese bowl  Yes know  supposed but surely could dressed some way into something couldn't prepare 45 seconds your own microwave?  The restaurant decently pretty but found furniture little odd  Chairs very high constantly felt put palms down table slouch right over  very comfortable   Overall Isla might worth checking if comp good coupon if you're absolutely desperate but price you're better off trying Strip's Mexican places combines sophisticated looks sophisticated tastes  <EOR> Chicken mole beef fajita amazing  Big portions! <EOR> oookay! maybe jus wrong thing but idk  wasn't hungry but knew i'd eat because girls going gonna drinkin storm night  read all reviews Isla wanted def give try    The place very nice  However food   *sigh*  damnit   Me 2 other girls ordered quesdillas other girl ordered tacos  when think quesdillas think of  QUESDILLAS  don't want fux had! weird looking wasn't good! can't really explain wish woulda taken picture  kind reminded hot pocket supposely chicken inside  didn't taste ne chicken sauce top tasted funny  VERY disappointed! friend tacos said bland she wasn't impressed either!
