Quality food scale 1 10 would give them 5 service also 5 back definitely recommend!! <EOR> This buffet need serious makeover    busy Saturday night no lines 7pm might sound tempting but experiencing quality food probably your best interest search food elsewhere   Almost anything else would better option your $30     The selection very limited within your choices even fewer actually good    carving station provided decent prime rib wife said turkey bad    korean pork dish over white rice only item considered getting second serving of    The asparagus no flavor   spit shrimp tacos    lot clam shells missing its contents inside    Salads looks inedible probably left all day since there's no eat replace salad station    The biggest draw buffet weekend supposed its crab legs    Sorry but smaller less flavorful Asian buffet down road     Finally dessert section limited nothing stood  save meal    shame    Service itself average best    Took few moments flag servers refills   Tables dirty when arrived   walked booth dirty wait wiped down    Can't see myself supporting buffet future if remains its current state  <EOR> Highly recommend dinner buffet only available Fri Sat night  Full service buffet includes beer wine courteous competent servers  many comparable Vegas buffets installed self serve beverage stations downgrade clearing dirty plates table  Staff server great  Fully met needs  Selections including crab oysters prime rib salads delicious  Deserves 5 stars  <EOR> I start off say wasn't hungry going into Flamingo might reason judgement but still  walked wi boyfriend buffet smallest seen since coming yo vegas  reminded size old country buffet  selection even great   The thing interesting your own quesadilla but bad big fan if quesadilla   I honestly spent time taste testing desserts  cotton candy awesome cheesecake pops very yummy but couldn't say same main courses  <EOR> Omelets bad runny  Turkey surprisingly moist good flavor  Chicken extremely dry tasted HORRIBLE! OMG  Ham moist somewhat decent flavor but much intensity it  Pork loin wonderful flavor but sadly dry  Desserts bad!! Real bad  Most texture medical grade rubber  Ya no    ***Remember champagne free!!! But won't offer ask  bad though  Very cheap way sweet  Gives stomachache    Ambiance spacious well lit but looked retirement center Florida  Overall disappointed variety items offered compared other buffets    Worst buffet overall strip  <EOR> Didn't expect buffet filling  breakfast isn't bad fake tasting waiter kept taking empty plates which little bit disturbing since still eating  also mimosas which cool since Vegas whats Vegas without alcohol haha  Food good disappointed that  But waiter trying take plates excessively annoying  Affordable price great view some flamingos  <EOR> Got buffet pass stopped Paradise snack dinner time  No line kinda told story experience which all happy didn't pay full price for     We cool seat neat flamingo's outside  If only buffet nice view  Everything just below would expect Vegas buffet 2018  portion even seems completely cut off if downsize buffet because no using it  <EOR> OK let preface learned most recent trip Las Vegas don't really buffets  However buffet worst! around 9 45am Friday looking forward some breakfast  took 45 minutes seated when sat down began remove all breakfast items replace them lunch!   WHAT! ONLY 10 30! EATS BREAKFAST MUCH EARLIER LAS VEGAS?!?!?!  I disappointed  Now change entire idea wanted eat  once did food sub par very lack luster  Basic buffet food nothing special    The shining star place waiter excellent    But generally would avoid place! <EOR> Endless mimosas worth though lot champagne them  Mostly OJ  Food good but lot options  says Asian Mexican Italian etc stations but 3 4 menu options 'station'  $ pay for  good but particularly memorable  <EOR> Golden Corral better Quality food  <EOR> While imagined buffet over top being Vegas guess pay for     For $17 99 pp less children thawing snow crab legs thawing cocktail shrimp so so cooked seafood   sushi bar if want call consisted smoked salmon pretty good keep running california roll salmon roll   think  it   There's ham carving station turns into prime rib during lunch   highlight meal meat eater   am much omelet eater when since really good ones home     My little cutie pie excited cotton candy machine he needs anymore sugar  rarely eat crap but since we're vacation look adorable face   well let one   Hubby liked crepes well   I'm disappointed because Pacific Buffet Arizona $16 99 dinner blows place away   Don't forget your rewards card lobby 10% off your bill   also coupon cashier asked can't find anywhere 20% more off  <EOR> The food disgusting   Lobster Mac n Cheese tastes chalk n cheese  Crab legs look malnourished  bite greasy nasty shrimp  ready toss cookies  Salad only decent thing plate  Should checked food selection prior paying $$  Most horrible buffet ever would recommend anyone  Complete waste $24 99 + tax  <EOR> The dinner buffet absolutely horrible  Very little choice dinner food never replaced timely manner  service otherwise fantastic  <EOR> Not bad  If you're looking lavish isn't place  However food decent service efficient kind restaurant clean  enjoyed unlimited mimosas breakfast no idea included price until server mentioned us  view gardens flamingos excellent room bright cheerful  early bird special 7 8am more discounted price  around 7 30 no wait all food freshly put out  fruit freshly sliced made to order crepes yummy everything tried decent  Now isn't Wynn Caesar's Palace any means   but if want reasonably priced buffet nice relaxing location try it  <EOR> The wait place ridiculous  Honestly place only half full but ended waiting 30 minutes because cashiers major bottleneck  Even hosts agreed because waiting sit people down   The food below average best  many other places Strip could better options  <EOR> Did Sunday brunch   Food ok overall   Pretty good selection   table service great   biggest problem lines waiting food   long never omelette  <EOR> It decent buffet  comped husband can't complain much  salad bar fruit really fresh lot variety  Asian food included fried rice General Tso's type chicken veggie spring roils which mediocre good  also fried chicken tortilla quesadilla bar pretty good  looked chocolate fountain fresh strawberries cotton candy dessert bar  If paid rating would probably lower but comp discount meal wasn't' bad  Much better Stratosphere buffet IMO  <EOR> Food labeled no idea eating cleaning carts all food eaten being rolled around entire restaurant  ate because reviews but horrible  Definitely recommend place  <EOR> the buffet buffets $40 good deal 24hrs unlimited buffets across 7 different properties ate mainly  what would expect prime rib shrimp crab legs etc  good quality taste $$ <EOR> I would recommend somewhere else even if you're tired walk  dinner didn't view flamingo habitat  food o kay but selection poor  guy carving roast beef hates job shows  restaurant nice but could use some detailed cleaning  bad     such great potential  <EOR> Seriously all Buffet Buffet's only Flamingo Rio 5 stars   Maybe PH Planet Hollywood but last time didn't line Platinum Diamond members [which means waiting extravagant line] might keep them 4 star rating   But let's focus task hand   keep simple   You're probably reading your iPhone hoping find quick tip before trashed bet black zero's   Location back Flamingo   Still trying figure parking structure  right outside doors but can't navigate it   way far into casino unlike Caesar's drunk buddies easily find your way it   Ambiance inside still little dated but ask view next windows which circle around flamingo gardens koi ponds   Once watched turtle couple hook while sun bathing   shabby   Service Awesome   Playing perks includes getting upgrade Platinum Diamond level   Those its perks waiting line   Plus servers tend treat better hoping squeeze extra few bucks hoping you're really rolling your card 'says' are   Luckily na aawa ako sa mga kababayan everytime Filipino server there's always guaranteed extra few bucks   Parking inside hotel valet self

Overall loved place right across hotel food good  would still recommend but ask management deal type behavior  <EOR> Had brunch buffet during lunch break conference attending Flamingo   check in front desk staff said could food credit $30 if declined housekeeping turnover room daily 3 day stay    used credit toward meal PGB some left over credit   Food great   Nothing fancy   Country fried steak mac cheese herb baked chicken delicious   Standard breakfast items including omelette bar   Also helped self some crepes which good   Overall great value  <EOR> Although 3 30pm wait 40 minutes  time came 5pm line looked probably 2 hr wait  When finally let saw despite huge line outside plenty unoccupied tables simply waiting cleared bussed  messy tables filled dirty plates dirty glasses napkins etc  Maybe short waitstaff it during week Christmas but definitely detracted atmosphere    They crab legs shrimp mussels ice  Those seemed big hit though personally don't love raw seafood  also extensive salad bar  whole foods salad bar but all basic salad fixins some premade salads  pretty average salad bar  sushi area poor cucumber seaweed salad some california rolls tuna roll  hot foods area something everyone but nothing superb  lot dishes erred sweet side roasted winter vegetables prime rib some fish dish which found annoying    Desserts include bread pudding blueberry crisp made to order crepes lots cakes  also some sugarfree options!  I left feeling full happy  5$ off coupons buffet $19 99   price food okay nothing superb nothing awful  <EOR> Sunday Brunch always good meal comes mimosas  Decent selection breakfast lunch foods very expansive dessert area  <EOR> I used lot past but recently March gone downhill  crab legs sliced half shrimp pre peeled anymore  legs smaller now well  guess explains why price down 19 99 24 99  still decent buffet seafood lovers but I'd recommend Village Seafood Buffet Rio if want eat some serious seafood    Service great fast desert bar awesome  <EOR> I don't all hate fine buffet breakfast  Good selection everything crepes smoked salmon even some dinner foods fried rice   Nice setting enjoy watch ducks flamingos while eat  Definitely worth doing again  <EOR> Poor food quality selection  Service also slow  Definitely worth price  many other dining options choose somewhere else  lines also long because small selection  <EOR> Received buy 1 1 free coupon buffet wasn't case  Only received $10 off  food terrible  Dinner rolls hard  Beef tasted if sat under heat lamp 6 hours  Only thing decent salad cookies  recommend establishment even if food free  <EOR> We breakfast last Saturday used Buffet Buffet pass   pleasantly surprised   seated right away waitress helping kept drinks refilled kept coming around check us   They typical breakfast fare sausage links patties bacon biscuits your choice sausage gravy creamed chipped beef gravy   favorite corned beef hash definitely can   omelet station crepe station   food did try flavorful hot temperature wise fresh   I haven't tried lunch dinner but might next time take trip Sin City  <EOR> Crepes days!  We Paradise Garden Buffet Sunday afternoon 12pm brunch  line 45 minutes long which happy about  However once inside first mimosa down first plate food feeling good!   The food selection pretty good enjoyed lunch foods more breakfast foods  However second round waited freshly made crepe thoroughly pleased  asked crepe guy if he could put strawberries lots nutella crepe  He definitely came through me! delicious    We stayed buffet 1 5 hours each gulped down 3 mimosas made sure money count  desserts fun too! <EOR> Ugh  arrive Flamingo traveling felt 12 hours starving ass off decide eat because buddy just exhausted look elsewhere  Wish took 20 minutes find another place     Their sign said lunch buffet ends 3pm 3 01pm lady behind desk gave lunch price  Kudos  Walking table immediately noticed Vegas hotel style restaurant appealing outside views small walkway pretty water fountain  Cool  then downhill     The only thing really good buffet crab legs  fair share them but didn't crab leg crackers   just small utensil pick your crab meat  task stuff face very difficult  small section open sushi but sushi appeared few hours  All cooked food appeared tasted overcooked  build your own nachos section but no chips  hoping would least something decent dessert aisle but cookies rock hard!  I suppose if come should come during peak hours since food always being shuffled  Looks middle shift change menu change lunch dinner  Las Vegas   world's number tourist attraction  Step up  <EOR> Waited long line people    line moves foot every ten minutes hungry     Service wasn't par     Oooh gosh!  All people passing long line silver cards       big spenders just fly right escorted manager   Then git register find coulda ta front line too  gold card        Escorts hostess look empty tables    Plate Shrimp plate prime rib plate dried lamb off pig out        left over dishes piled high table      Overall    food average        need more cash register booths lines move quicker     <EOR> The only thing enjoyed dessert table   food only being cheaper buffets Las Vegas strip even price wasn't worth food available  <EOR> One Las Vegas' claims fame buffets   Long stations filled anything your heart desires     Happy people taking pictures food cell phones talking great food is     Other people clamoring around various stations excited try something new eat some old time favorites     experience buffet however quite different   think everyone just looking around wide eyed thinking themselves  it? place can't even compete comfort foods place Hometown Buffet Hometown would charge $5 $10 less!  reviews always relative level service would expect certain level restaurant those comparable area   most famous Las Vegas hotels middle strip place cash flow impress   But impress didn't!  Even service received to par other buffets to   I thought salad area very fresh though extremely small also crab legs fresh carved ham   during brunch also breakfast items waffles very cute made various suits playing cards diamonds clubs etc       But other did find anything really appetizing   Oh yeah if dying dehydration sure try scrambled eggs   much water those things thought going float away eating them!    Come Flamingo much better!  SUGGESTIONS According Flamingo Las Vegas' Website Watch playful antics some Flamingo's wildlife while enjoying fresh feast Paradise Garden Buffet  fail tell website going need binoculars see those playful antics all tables near windows reserved Platinum Club Members if just buffet then might well forget those playful antics   Maybe random bird calls restaurant start some playful antics your own! <EOR> It eh ok   food could better    going Wynn now  <EOR> Two times gone only breakfast buffet  times can't deny options option chicken waffles simple egg bacon hashbrown optioned breakfast  Could smaller ones but food offer good enough breakfast  also dessert fruit section well salad bar shrimp cocktails well  Best tip come around 10 30am stay until 11 00am brunch meal options crab legs prime rib  food isn't bad longer waits other places can't wrong coming here  Though warning service great  lot people working sure once done your first dish back start eating your second dish your first plate still table  Refills take while if don't ask your server  don't come refill if don't ask  Though food decent there's much wait customer service needs better here  <EOR> I'm big fan buffets   But buffet definitely old hotel feel food just OK   food similar quality Old Country Buffet not put OCB down but least price point quality food! Just having arrived morning flight practically starving when hotel   checking immediately downstairs buffet   Luckily used resort credit $30 when booked room because free food fine   around 11ish am transitioning between breakfast lunch     PROS disagree reviewers said no fruit selection good dessert area since both!  nice selection fresh fruit dessert area nice!  little slices different cakes tarts my fav! even crepes station   bread pudding delicious although better elsewhere   ate two servings! also nice selection cheese BBQ ribs good   prime location watch flamingos inside too   CONS think $16 per person which quality food should closer $9 99   didn't touch anything salad bar all looked old unappetizing   Even person sitting next overheard saying same thing   did manage some mixed corn but no flavor   also ceviche which questionable since wasn't sure long sitting but tasted ok didn't sick it!     In conclusion place ok free starving people   Otherwise way better buffets Vegas just few minutes walk away! <EOR> I really nervous try place reading reviews but honestly excellent experience! Arrived around 8am Tuesday no line which made even more nervous!   seated immediately waitress came take drink orders  She kept coffee mimosas coming whole time both which really good! super picky coffee  food selection very good great selection hot cold breakfast lunch items  Boyfriend loved omelet station  sure around corner pastry crepe making station well! spent 2 hours sipping mimosas watching flamingos snacking tons great food! <EOR> It first only buffet hit Vegas because met all needs well  could breakfast past noon friend could eat nachos fried chicken 9 morning if she wanted  mimosa bar plus why some booze breakfast? All food well prepared range options pleasant surprise  <EOR> This breakfast buffet Flamingo normally costs $20 but complimentary buffet vouchers luckily didn't pay anything besides tip   isn't bad breakfast but definitely worth $20!  Amongst selections omelet station crepe station shrimp cocktail smoked salmon bagels muffins danishes fresh fruit oatmeal donuts cookies chocolate fountain where dip fruit scrambled eggs eggs benedict sausage bacon some other common breakfast items   I would come again if free but otherwise   I'd skip find better use money! <EOR> Being occasional poker player need way waste rewards thought should take friend buffet  bad reviews surprising because buffet actually cheapest strip best atmosphere   This buffet located inside Flamingo hotel strip park parking lot fee    The greatest thing place definitely view  sit right flamingos ducks etc    making your dining experience pretty unique strip  Also buffet comes alcohol included which pretty rare  only worth price whether plan drinking champagne morning wine night   The food good buffet without being exceptional but option ordering burritos quesadillas crepes which nice addition   In conclusion would say place best buffets strip mainly because views because its great quality price ratio when compare other buffets such Bellagio's Caesar's  Feel free message any additional details may need! <EOR> A buffet view  extent Paradise Garden  view strictly daytime thing seems majority patrons lunch brunch  run mill Vegas buffet some interesting items but overall lackluster experience   First timers might find space impressive because is  aren't many midstrip lower end properties offer spread let alone views vibrant garden   essentially bread butter experience because options quality food subpar enough folks second guessing visit   During brunch hour bottomless mimosa option which attractive option weekend warriors looking continue Saturday hangover  Another thing didn't expect Asian noodle station where customize bowl noodle soup  made killer wonton noodle soup still shocked  crepes station also semi thumbs but really depends making them   The rest buffet tough swallow  Literally  Anything fried instant fail  pizza almost always sure bet no thank you most seafood bland city if you're shooting any BBQ Mexican fare then bless your appetite   Prices aren't backbreaking strip property $24 dinner brunch  Other $15 20 everything else  If happen rockin 24 hour pass then consider passing Flamingo version buffetland  <EOR> Hmmmmm     yeah good   Nothing looked particularly fresh   We ate because Flamingo hotel deal included two free breakfast buffets     I think normally costs $20+?  rip off tell you  <EOR> This review purely based dish wrong description!!! Salsa Verde doesn't even look salsa verde because duh????? isn't even green  actually delicious pork stew but Asian style  looks chunks pork shoulder pork belly braised sweet soy sauce base ginger scallions  kinda taste teriyaki pork if pulled pork Hawaiian Kaulua pork but even better! steamed rice next it  suggestion Soup bowl scoop some rice then scoop salsa verde aka pork stew try fatty pieces don't forget scoop some sauce  Next sushi section squirt some sriracha sauce if don't things sweet  Some broccolini roasted yams compliment stew  Please trust me  know buffet isn't stellar but if gotta eat saved  talk ton smack place until hubby found delicious pork stew dish  If home sick just want taste Asian comfort your next to  holy crap    damn hella missing out! <EOR> Service hit miss  first server track down  second super attentive courteous  breakfast eggs Benedict must try  But honestly all food all delicious  Check Groupon deals! desserts probably best part buffet  Must try strawberry shortcake! <EOR> I should listened warnings other reviews! Such disappointment buffet definitely ranks worst buffets Vegas am quite buffet enthusiast!   To start off extremely outdated everything looks dingy old  service waiter probably only good thing experience  family Prime Rib night prime rib tasted rubber  much selection food everything everywhere !!! limited food did taste freezer foods fresh all! also pretty sure pizza freezer Digornio  Absolutely no order food  if your looking call sushi between ice cream machine rest desserts     seriously!! if want taco meet looks probably taste cat food then come Stay away place ! <EOR> This buffet Flamingo hotel beautiful location large windows viewing habitat area   cheaper most others $20 adult dinner   There long line waiting pay long lines waiting seated   cashier really nice   hostess less nice seating family next large table loud frat boys    least all loud since expecting them rude vulgar    but appear well bred frat boys since never happened   left eventually   The selection varied but considerably smaller most other Vegas buffets   notable though clear inferiority food   Much just didn't look good   Some didn't look being described   example sign chicken cheese pierogie but tasted previously frozen breaded chicken stuffed cheese   Nothing all pierogie!  Crab legs split making eating them messy   interesting item seen some other budget buffets crawfish    Even salad bar offerings sparse   Oddly only goopy salad dressings oil vinegar option   Wierd   Best items bread rolls really plain horseradish   Worst item gelatinous brown gravy   Recommended items slightly tough rib roast baked potato screw up    except mark them baked SWEET potato    If insist sour cream baked potato    couln't find any substituted creamed horseradish instead     Weirdest item entire area full Middle Eastern Italian mezze but practically empty   We didn't really eat much enjoyed even less   Dessert selection didn't dissapoint quantity   expected some items looked better others   kids just LOVED dipping marshmallows fruit chocolate fountain   I opted fresh made crepe   guy making crepe did nice job making it   then offered choice four five fruit fillings canned pie filling kids stuff    Then amazing motion folded crepe into apple filled football like configuration flopped onto plate   Could more dainty suppose but never changed taste    which just OK   The waiter though almost drove review into 1 star category   He nice older man tired seems no aptitude interest being waiter   He never when needed when he did show never looked took off fast couldn't ask anything    beverage refills   Throughout meal he took care refills wife kids once but seemed avoid mark Satan forehead   Of course when leaving he cuddled made nice nice  Satan     presumably  hopes tip  <EOR> We hungry wait hour room hour while carrying laptop bag didn't wanna leave bellhop   plus coupon plus someone's platinum status =free drink buffet decided stop buffet  I've before didn't high expectations  food edible but nothing really stood good bad way  service good   I couldn't find anything good dessert some reason chocolate fountain wasn't assembled it weekday lunch   Overall ok place some food  more time nothing heavy carry would better add $8 Wicked Spoon! <EOR> Tiny mediocre buffet World Famous resort destination could be?! food just ok nothing nothing special  Cut ham sandwiches highlight item Sunday Brunch? Grocery store style sushi average breakfast items mediocre salad bar  Cafeteria good word describes place  live Henderson neighborhood buffet Fiesta casino 5 times larger comparison  Once again multimilllion dollar casino chuck wagon buffet? appologize tourists come all over world eat sorry  Service good watiress attentive  out  <EOR> Average buffet  couple levels continental breakfast  used groupon three friends which great deal but probably wouldn't come if full price   There nice omelette bar crepe station fresh fruits salads  bacon looked less appetizing sat pool grease  Some items definitely looked more fresh others     The brunch buffet includes unlimited mimosas bloody Mary's  took ages server even come over to fair she seemed she ginormous section serve only couple mimosas in  However very sweet when asked if  could more champagne instead juice them she said no despite other reviewers mentioned   The other weird thing wouldn't accept BC drivers license ID said could only use passports? thought bizarre never encountered before     All all wouldn't come back but if groupon OK  <EOR> This literally worst buffet Vegas  probably ate worst shrimp taco life  prime rib ok but hot veggies cold  desserts disgusting well  Don't come here!

Good value basic breakfast buffet  Oooh donuts delicious!!! Perfect coffee!!! <EOR> So experienced buffet together family today breakfast  21 99 adult believe 10 99 children ages 4 12  ambience would actually give four but took away 1 star bad stuff  asked table near waterfalls children could see outside  maitre di did accommodate request which appreciated  Also did appreciate waitress when three year old spilled entire glass yes entire glass orange juice lap she did everything power try help getting some warm towels wipe off   OK now bad stuff  Watery scrambled eggs  Slow  Slow  Slow  point  Service  think ask Diet Coke two times  think asked coffee few times  line omelette station long  think guy front ordering six omelettes  spoke Spanish seem even knew each other  Because took almost 20 minutes single omelette  don't it  Also just line food seem took forever    I don't know if ever back if did would least know expect slow service  If did come back would probably deal where spend $50 eat five different buffets 24 hours  way actually your moneys worth experience different locations  if you're unhappy just another next day  would also suggest going maybe earlier day faster service  <EOR> Decent buffet  Didn't much but lot did have  buffet because offer grapefruit juice  Also seeing flamingos outside window  <EOR> Well strange buffet located oldest casino hotel Las Vegas strip  Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet delivers some nearly average foods affordable prices  parents nearly concluded Vegas trip today decided redeemed last free buffet 2 coupon offer signed two rewards cards day ago   As headed inside atmosphere totally outdated trippy  decor concept very 1970s 1980s feel awkward design instead being contemporary  dining inside Hometown Buffet mixed Denny's touch   The service bad welcome there  Some good some good which sometimes can't smiled all  Otherwise believe done fine job making customers approachable   Now onto buffet entrees me  first plate simple lunch meal filled smoked ham jambalaya green beans baked tilapia Spanish rice  far mediocre meal  good ones enjoyed baked tilapia which does taste ok me  Also Spanish rice does tasted good too! downside ham nearly dried bland baking which left flavor  jambalaya tasted salty me! don't know why jambalaya adds ingredients much! wish could reduce place natural flavors  green beans closely fair which did feel eating coming frozen food which did bought local supermarket   The second plate BYO omelette  far tasted closely average comparing Hometown Buffet's BYO omelette yet fine way  omelette toppings added spinach bacon cheese  wish needs flavors omelette more better fresher opinion before doors open   My possible suggestions improve Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet redesign concept more contemporary feel instead keeping outdated old school formation  Secondary place needs clean sanitized! seen some dirty spots near dirty dishes collector side wet towels placing down floor plus seats too  Finally foods fresh new! sure need something new instead keeping old ways Hometown Buffet does  Vegas Strip Flamingo sure need change attitude step up   In end Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet fairly Vegas buffet parents dining place first time  If you're likely dare come dine good luck  <EOR> You COULD probably find better buffet  But completely forgotten $25 coupon excessive wait time when checked hotel 2 days ago  boyfriend brunch only $14 some change  Can't that  might tastiest fanciest but price getting picky  Omelettes crepes being freshly made order coffee good employees nice  If aren't total snob might just place  <EOR> Been lunch couple times  You pay here  I think its very average typical vegas buffet   You pay alot less buffets Ceasars Bellagio if looking VOLUME reasonably low price strip view some flamingos here   Good take friends date depending date coworkers  Take customers somewhere else  <EOR> We stayed Flamingo hotel first week July decided brunch second day vacation  price reasonable especially considering bottomless mimosas included pricing  Brunch selections decent but wasn't whole lot choose from  good news everything delicious hot  saw them changing pans even if weren't empty which feel good safety quality  location awesome view outside flamingos quite bright anyone notice most Vegas buffets seem dark?   Flamingo favorite hotel Vegas definitely returning Paradise Garden Buffet next trip there  <EOR> Total complete dump   Bad food bad surroundings   decent servers chefs feel bad rating but all food  <EOR> This worst buffet ever had  paid $25 per person because came around noon  said its Sunday brunch price  Shrimp needed peeled small terrible! Crab legs tiny joke buffet  Dont eat unless under $10  Coffee really bad  better fried chicken Hometown buffet  <EOR> While price fair 19 bucks food just wasnt worth it  would rather eaten Subway honestly  near Ballys where staying tried it  wouldnt back  Service outstanding kept them 1 star zone <EOR> The only redeeming thing place waitress being absolutely lovely having free ticket staying Flamingo  food cold disgusting late breakfast  ask milk cereal instead having milk readily available near cereal station  ONLY good food place desserts but would pay 20 bucks alone  Just skip buffets Vegas general  <EOR> For SAME PRICE pay FLAVORS Harrah's 5x BETTER FOOD SERVICE  last time first last time eating here  <EOR> Let start unlimited mimosas!! good selection good food which serve shallow dishes which refill more often which food fresh sit long  carving station omelet station crepe station addition buffet  Staff good friendly  definitely recommend breakfast <EOR> I coming Flamingo Paradise Buffet years but just last bad meal there  place lost charm me many other great places nearby risk wasting another meal here   Everything experience below expectations line pay seating table service  left table more food hoping better offerings first try cleared table water utensils everything before back  Glad quick reclaim table before seated others there   Food main appeal any dining experience food uniformly disappointing! Limited variety hot food cold tasteless shrimp still frozen ice ball bland blasé disappointing every level  Even dessert bar bad brown stuff did taste chocolate unimaginative boring   Do yourself favor skip one  <EOR> So random Buffett fiancé cause she heard good things place  thought wasn't bad myself when ate here  line wasn't bad all pretty quick     The servers super nice  gave extra plate crab shells bones ect  fiancé ask hot sauce she 4 different ones which cool  drinks refilled fast    For food would say okay but full which point  Everything tasted decent nothing really wowed which didn't expect since buffett  didn't steak almost cooked outside almost rare bloody inside   All other foods eaten no complains about    I didn't see all desert til end which other far comer place  crepe  tasted okay    For $20 your moneys worth if your picky eat  <EOR> I don't care other reviewers said buffet  eaten several times    On occasion came Brunch Buffet  everything wanted then some  Salmon omelets snow crab legs shrimp bacon clams mussels seafood pasta fruit     could on    I also view Habitat  calming see koi carp ducks swans swimming by    I would eat again  <EOR> Their food selection good  brunch last day strip  Which $19 99  crepe station omelette station carving Stanton ham slab bacon smoke sausage turkey salad bar dessert bar  server quick good sense humor  loved able see pond koi fish flamingos where sitting  <EOR> Price range between $20 $30  Came bfast lunch typical selection American Mexican dishes ranging omelets pizza deli sandwiches rolled tacos tortilla bar  rolled tacos probably favorite thing because they're light crispy saucy  also salad dessert bar but barely touched them because just cookies little pastries  Crepes ok limited put them  waitress very friendly! <EOR> We stayed Fremont last trip ended eating paradise buffet twice while there   couple wanted eat cheap agreed paradise them   All all wasn't terrible   Both times no line food ok seemed clean   doesn't come close other buffets Vegas but also half price   I'd recommend if starving want just basic food   may return    <EOR> Went buffet Thursday night when Prime Rib only $14   There's hundred choices eat but tastes great   salad bar could use lot more options but said earlier food terrific atmosphere pleasing   breakfast decent amount choices can't wrong only $7  <EOR> Mediocre best  But if you're looking quick cheap buffet good fit  <EOR> My family 7 cane April 28 2018  Very very bad experience firstly host Kenny very unpleasant requested different table he replied back saying don't time right now table fine bigger  host very friendly needs training customers etiquette  Secondly quality food below average crab very dry over cooked fruits I e  watermelon cantaloupe ripe desserts limited selection  expect casino would some kind chef would would QA quality food being served  very bad representation casino serve such low standard food  only positive experience server did name but she El Salvador provided excellent service kind friendly  first last time eating definitely worth $32 dollars per person  <EOR> This buffet offers window views beautiful garden   notice reviews good   But dined twice lunch dinner thoroughly enjoyed experience   memorable am easy please   I won't compliment table service selections great   But everything wanted speaking myself  brunch waitress really busy handling many tables   But she managed keep mimosa flowing staggered completely satisfied   unfair compare buffet others bigger newer hotels   Flamingo old hotel   But ambiance buffet scenery very nice just right price  <EOR> Service good  Food options limited but worth compared other buffets charging $60 person!

False advertising I'd say  walked far just hungry just decided eat here   regret every paying buffet    food very limited good all! dessert section surprisingly bigger whole hot foods section but disgusting desserts! <EOR> Food drinks very good especially price!

She deserves credit! <EOR> Sigh   where even start  Buffets very happy  am usually excited find usually attraction itself  buffet however case  nice little array desserts salad bar to  temperature all main items seemed off  sure if everything sitting long time but food room temperature a big peeve   breads stale  only rate 2 stars due decent desserts salad bar  waitress hostess fabulous but other place needs some improvement foodwise  view beautiful sitting views overlooking Koi ponds flamingo ducks little waterfalls  <EOR> Food dry oily perfect neighbors fog poops your lawn  Crepes only reason place gets two stars <EOR> Blech!  buffet buffet pass ate three meals only because staying hotel    food luke warm best     Golden Coral's buffet MUCH better this   guess  trying find bargain Vegas just isn't bargain when comes food   If looking decent food Vegas expect pay high prices don't skimp! <EOR> Not very decent seafood buffet  Luckily just craving prime rib place fulfilled it  Seafood choices very limited what's considered seafood dinner buffet  bit stingy even when asked cut thicker slice prime rib but ended having ask two slices equal thick slice wanted  Desserts awful  would return buffet again even if lazy hotel  <EOR> Horrible  saw little flies hovering over bowl fuit!!! Eat your own peril! <EOR> Will return! several buffets Vegas say worst thus far  best thing view flamingos exhibit if good seat  Other cheap buffet cheap food  selection smaller average buffet  could tell food sitting while without being replenished  took few items plate only thing good enough eat  ravioli  Other horrible tasing gravy mash potatoes Mac cheese couldn't more bite of  Horrible  Thankfully didn't pay would asking money back all ate today two pieces ravioli  buffet pass decided check out  would probably say buffet tastes cheap hotel buffet any hotel around America  does hold any Vegas standards  <EOR> After long day Go Pool decided needed buffet  Let first start saying    Save your money going here  Very expensive Hometown buffet quality food  Caeser's buffet  Very expensive bad attempt sushi bad quality seafood horrible service  dinner poorly lit servers hardly ever around  somewhere else! <EOR> 3 5 stars  Enjoyed dinner buffet Flamingo  lot food choices but food offered delicious  Fresh salads tons meat options seafood  Guac chips good too! Only complaint some items cold it'd nice if constantly restocked    I did off groupon don't think I'd pay full price    Got around 4 55 PM already line  fast waited around 15 mins  <EOR> I hate use such negative description but buffet truly awful   stopped lunch because purchased 24 hour pass where eat any M Life property buffet many times want 24 hour period   almost every buffet strip worst     First all line took 30 minutes even though only handful  people front all because person working each transaction register took least 5 minutes   Lots people line just walked away   hostess walked over see big line deemed unnecessary open another register   when finally seated 75% restaurant empty couldn't believe wouldn't want move line along quicker people in  Even when left place still empty line still long moving slowly   The food selection smallest any buffet life   honestly 60% less food options every other Vegas buffet worst all fruit flies salad dessert bar   gross!  place just filthy server only gave drink refill once   Needless say never return  <EOR> I very disappointed food buffet  First buffet $21  Thats ridiculous even strip  Second mac cheese horrible food cold bacon limp corn bread no taste  $21 buffet expect high end fresh food  typical buffet food lacks taste  mention food signs incorrect  Don't waste your time  Just dennys down street  <EOR> Is place few inexpensive buffet spots strip?

She kept asking doing refilled waters when possible  She very attentive  even dropped water bottle cap floor she asked if wanted washed  just want give hug  She's sweet  Sooo service pleasant  sure if would come back anytime soon since many food places explore Vegas! <EOR> The buffet seemed reasonably priced Las Vegas  wide variety foods which nicely prepared  Seating comfortable server assigned table very accessible  only wait custom made omelet  Perhaps could used additional chef  <EOR> I've buffet couple times because easy when staying Flamingo but imagine back  recently decreased hours mornings weekend nights   The food okay but sometimes looks sitting awhile  christmas all desserts missing ice cream machines broken  also huge line waiting meat causing wait 30 minutes your food  staff didnt really seem working together improve situation  If little more organized trying come solution process more efficient maybe buffet would better    <EOR> I breakfast yesterday here! cost 21 95 pp lot food choices just breakfast but brunch well  crepe station!!!! Amazing crepe seriously!!!  Omelet station which didn't try huge dessert bar! also offer all drink bloody Mary's mimosa's   complaint aren't informed your waiter all drink read sign way door!!! Probably best since work do! <EOR> We arrived Vegas pretty early Friday morning vacation wanted good priced breakfast brunch buffet   exactly here  line super fast everyone came contact very nice  personally thought more enough options brunch  Made to order stations omelets crepes made place  server always hand offer more OJ coffee  Pair cool view flamingos window really enjoyed entire experience especially price  <EOR> This buffet immediate mistake  wait whatever but could faster  food pretty bad didn't best selection  did give unlimited mimosas but used most pulp them wasn't very good  asked some without pulp way better! tried eggs Benedict cooked totally wrong couldn't cut through biscuit  also slice pizza wasn't great but coulda worse  crepe good first til whipped cream separated pretty much done point anyway  All all id say absolutely eat here  price find way better buffet across street mirage just little more! Seriously don't eat you'll probably regret it    If sure take advantage unlimited mimosas! <EOR> Had brunch family really enjoyed it   wouldn't say food selection all great all delicious    but interior bright friendly children loved outdoor garden area flamingos other creatures could watch while dined   priced right mid range buffet  <EOR> When you're eating some playing songs lyrics don't forget  sure won't forget outdated terrible buffet   I don't even know where start  front where enter buffet seems would large queue but queue line just path other people just trying walk Linq's Promenade  When enter you'll wondering if even right place  carpet reminds something would find vintage carpet store  If theme California missions would sure win over customers   The food just overall terrible donuts cinnamon rolls hard  Knock them table its rock  brunch selection seemed limited just basic white people foods  just racist add Chinese Chicken Wings   even thing traditional Chinese foods    Now service lady serving drinks timely manner  But when she gave water she spilled some water cup onto table  She thought no noticed just continued day  funny thing straws wet water just done  But overall most employees great  <EOR> Literally crap served plate  Food clearly unsanitary seems left while  food seemingly cold wouldn't ever come eat again  <EOR> Not best buffet strip but very convenient if staying Flamingo  buffet very small comparison other buffets most food oily bland    Paradise Garden does offer bottomless bloody marys mimosa breakfast  also sit next window overlooking koi pond animal sanctuary  only two perks visiting Paradise Garden Buffet  <EOR> When you're Vegas excellent place start your day   breakfast buffet wide offering expected fare really good price   nice place relax your friends recap night before plan your next day   Keep mind 3 sections  Typically first third same offering but now always   Last time third actually dedicated Chinese food   center section packed delicious deserts    know don't usually think desert breakfast but Vegas why not?  If request they'll leave pitcher soda coffee your table to save having request refills      Even though buffet remember tip take care your waitress   If just dropped few hundred craps last night surely afford leave more buck  <EOR> I heard many great things buffet needless say    lied where trashed realize terrible was  food horrible disorganized  couldn't tell trays hot holds  Seriously labels gone wrong    The salds ok but veggies sides choosing did look fresh  meats stale flavorless  chinese food selection gross    The only reason gave buffet two stars because hostess gave free extra sky vodka mini bottles dessert selection very good  But then again mess cakes ice cream chocolate??? especially liked crepe station where your order right front you  <EOR> This buffet just sucks  advertises all eat crab legs then only serves them cold no butter  Says close 10 then arrive 8 30 typed closing 9 30 line still door  Stupid management move  Then top off once inside huge line people waiting them bring food out  Sometimes cheap comes expensive  <EOR> No  eat here  Probably worst buffet ever Las Vegas hotel money pay  don't even buffet worth selection foods  Just couple things there  wasn't buffet food already chosen your meal yourself  Avoid Donnie Marie dolls gift shop your way because think they're cursed  <EOR> I didn't pay buffet still disappointed  place needs serious upgrade both food decor  Having guy carving station seem annoyed when anyone asked anything another nice touch  2 stars complimentary alcohol serve although wife insisted Bloody Mary didn't seem any alcohol it  If you're paying buffet probably best elsewhere  <EOR> I am buffet person but hurry gave shot     nice variety food but most buffets everything cold     Unless eggs made order all cold    love eggs Benedict but English muffin hard couldn't cut knife  ended eating wings pizza actually warm good    healthiest breakfast but worked me   loads desserts crepes fresh   cherry pie very good   Service very attentive atmosphere nice clean   Unlimited bloody Mary's mimosas made popular place many people   didn't indulge    Not likely return but only because buffets serve cold food am hot food fanatic  <EOR> What's 1 stars? kidding me? just going assume those people drunk forgot chew    This buffet GLORIOUS! Part because Gloria best waitress ever  She filled glass Orange Juice chugged needing fluids she turned right around filled again!  great customer service if ever saw it    When checked Flamingo coupon book gave two people $5 off buffet  sign above because 2 us! Normally guess breakfast buffet $14 99 but $10  No champagne but being last day could live that    If you've read any other reviews you'll know know way around breakfast place did too! Bagels smoked salmon lox cream cheese amazing french toast waffles crepe station ask banana it! omelet station that blow your mind! later bacon sausage amazing amount good fruit everything else    It all die for  Literally best omelet ever ingredient fresh perfect  crepe huge just bananas sugar perfect amount sweet  fruit better then any far even toast good eating dry while waiting them omelet    We during lunch switch saw some people eating ribs would grabbed some if thought could plane much food stomach    This buffet worth coming even if you're Flamingo  fantastic  Maybe best meal whole vacation! <EOR> Ate buffet last night   29 99 per person four us   Buffet meats pasta several main dishes  Seafood enchiladas no seafood just empty tortilla sauce   never seen buffet Vegas food  People standing waiting food   asked refills several times no ever came back   Very poor service poorly planned  <EOR> I can't imagine trip Las Vegas without least MENTIONING might try Champagne Brunch weekends  don't always brunch  don't know YOUR Vegas but Vegas often includes very late nights mid mornings room  suite pun intended leave early morning rush    Regardless whether champagne brunch still occurs its still delicious    My best friend usually different types seafood both taste everything  Equally both love breakfast customizable omelet is!  lil champagne serve brunch packs nice lil' buzz it'll feelin good! <EOR> I dinner satisfied overall experience  purchased Groupon which gave group ability skip long line also save $5 00 buffet price  nice salad fruit bar 2 soup options  entrees good well  tacos very good enjoyed lots side dishes  am seafood lover peel eat shrimp good piles crab legs  enjoy hot steamed crab legs which bit over cooked but just any buffet when crab legs sit long time dry up  server wasn't best but able work around that  unlimited drinks both alcoholic non alcoholic also plus  scenery nice but started getting dark while didn't enjoy much would liked  Desserts good fav soft serve ice cream  would back again! <EOR> The only reason giving place even star because food pretty decent buffet  However service absolutely horrendous  Starting rude cashiers all way management  Don't forget tip before horrible service rain fire your table  God forbid leave tip end your meal where serve yourself  only did server slam drinks down ignore whole time except give whole table evil stare down but she refused give refills inclusive champagne brunch  She even said couldn't refills iced teas oj's sodas     thought buffet  Luckily she brought manager over argument refills front because server wanted see it  Whatever means  When asked if something wrong she rant only god judge then things turned bad worse  guess God justifies bad service rudeness denies new silverware  But turn fate being open concerns she gave table all attention before leaving middle meal  she left new server didn't even look table introduce herself clear off plates anything good service  But tracked down other side restaurant some refills  would think maybe just hate but only ones yelled ignored  Clearly customer service priority  management obviously  doesn't want people coming back seeing rude were  wouldn't recommend place anyone looking easy going meal  But food good    guess counts something  Maybe  <EOR> Do Eat Here  $25 seems bargain but gna cost $50 more cuz your gna eat something else throwing up  probably $2000 more food poison  <EOR> I'm just really sad right now  Sad sad anyone else spent 30 bucks come here  Sad all flamingos inside  only happy people place amazing friendly staff   Don't sad don't don't come your friendly Las Vegas version hometown buffet  <EOR> I'm sure if actually wasn't disappointed food because lunch MGM Grand buffet if real three star rating but way wasn't disappointed =0    shrimp crab legs asian food all buffets fried food baked fish salmon all kinds stuff wasn't bad but I'd agree another yelper said food all lukewarm necessarily hot cold   didn't eat much because since doing turnaround didn't want eat then having itis driving home   food just ok though   crab legs bottom barrel weren't very fresh made slits shells could opened easier but even when broken slits meat stuck shells hard all without completely cracking legs open lengthwise yah kind crab leg pro hahaha    desserts ok nothing complain long day feet   only thing slightly annoying fact sat large group back but ample seating everywhere else   Other man serving drinks great quick missed few people which understandable because many party   Overall experience nice food decent didn't disgust MGM buffet did staff great  <EOR> Everything delicious  end cut rare piece prime rib  Peel eat shrimp excellent finally enjoyed crab legs first time I'm lobster guy      waitress very attentive rest meal very well rounded out  Ribs some best had  <EOR> The only reason today 20% off coupon had   breakfast figured can't screw breakfast food   wrong   Where start   more salad bar breakfast thought   mean hell shrimp salad breakfast buffet for??

Deciding least if buffet isn't great still really fill found ourselves line couple minutes before entering buffet Flamingo   Selection decent but hardly huge even dessert area while taking lot space didn't really much variety offer   really need 25 feet sugar free desserts ?  The drink service annoying say least soda hardly tasted right servers rarely paid any attention   Why no open area your own drinks?  The food itself ranged marginal best lobster bisque pasta forgettable but decent poultry dishes other seafood fairly good green beans fried rice beef dishes    desserts hit miss well   In end $25 person right edge tolerable   could fill pretty decent food saving grace   However sure far best buffet best deal available strip   essentially hand dealt least didn't lose shirts  <EOR> We 20% off coupon Bally's family decided brunch  When long line but still decided wait  Finally hostess desk 30 minutes later then form ANOTHER line seated! many lines such hungry stomach   Wide varieties breakfast brunch items yogurt granola eggs benedict  Everything fresh including cocktail shrimp crawfish which sounds tad bit weird morning meal  Service pretty slow piles plates side table which made difficult put new plates down  Can't leave buffet without having some dessert! favorite part meal hog wild took sample each dessert item  crepe made order but nothing special varieties fruit preserves chocolate syrup whipped cream   cannoli soft serve ice cream cone fondue delicious but red velvet cookie wasn't something crazy about   Very decent buffet but definitely look coupons! <EOR> This place good brunch!!!

Seriously??? waited least 10 minutes while two cashiers figured some problem another guest  As being scolded another couple walked line  gal told stand line everyone else  joke  should left then  couple just line behind where nice enough explain cashier first  The food horrible!!! Service just stale food  much crack smile Ms  Sunshine  NO WONDER NO LINE PLATINUM LINE PEON LINE! <EOR> Yes agree hit miss lots times sometimes wonderful sometimes awful  just dont know! need use your ESP one  I guess just banking view bird gardens outside  <EOR> This isn't best buffet Las Vegas nor worst   very much somewhere between   We Paradise Garden Buffet despite so so reviews because A  hotel and    B  coupon $10 off two meals   We ended going champagne bloody mary brunch Saturday morning though didn't partake bloody marys did consume probably more champagne single person should ever before noon     The food very average whole but really enjoyed fresh crepe making station place gets extra points that   Also could see flamingos seat    once again nice touch   Also when walked receipt meal ticket honestly weren't sure which which when boyfriend asked awesome lady hostess station she replied The LONG mine *eyebrow raise all sultry like* cracked hell up   Would back without coupon?  Probably not   But if happen staying Flamingo you're hungry you're quite ready face light day isn't bad place some breakfast  <EOR> Not lot variety  Wish could checked food selection before paying  Would definitely choose else where  Just average buffet  standards buffet such beautiful hotel  <EOR> It buffet  Every time come Vegas come breakfast  Probably 10 times over years  your eggs order much bacon eat  breakfast along coffee  well  Servers usually nice helpful  much else say  <EOR> 1  Verdict Value Tough recommend many better options Strip   Look other buffets first   2  Food Arguably smallest buffet Strip only smaller selection but nothing special   3  Service waitress kept mixing drink orders difficult find when needed bill   hopeful all waitresses especially when isn't much deliver sort buffet however she successfully put further damper experience   4  Atmosphere Think early 90's decor view   Restaurants across nation and buffets Vegas continued revitalize themselves last 10 years may time Paradise Garden same well  <EOR> So boyfriend Vegas decided eat Paradise Garden Buffet because heard great crab legs   There's only 3 registers takes awhile able pay then need wait another line sat   Most employees bit older but really sweet  service pretty good always drinks refilled  When asked hot sauce lady came 4 which really appreciate  food definitely Americanized don't think great but 20 bucks ribs orange chicken crab legs  also split crab legs easier eat  liked dessert mainly because chocolate fondue boyfriend himself crepe which great  just didn't enjoy food all much  pad thai very much americanized rice wasn't cooked well enough  But $20 left very full satisfied! <EOR> The food terrible find much more better buffet nearby same price   Its only worth $10 but actually charge $30 + tips dinner  Try avoid place  <EOR> Wow great! feel can't move eating! buffet offers breakfast brunch lunch all day dinner Friday Saturdays  tad pricey but totally worth it! <EOR> We disappointed food here  2009 thought food fantastic  time food wasn't good bummed  Also guess reserving tables view Habitat Diamond members ever is  frequent Vegas people only business means don't nice seat? Again Flamingo does care guests apparently repeat customers  <EOR>
