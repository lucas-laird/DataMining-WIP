LAME  Our friend Chicken Enchiladas second bite chicken bones  taken back he fresh dish without bones  No raved food  The Peaches Cream dessert big actually quite delicious Fresh presented beautifully   It's long review know but won't back  wasn't worth it  many better restaurants nearby  <EOR> I don't know low reviews loved it! fiance during happy hour food real good dessert phenomenal  hispanic agree its hispanic  more poor mexican gringo food where roll sausage tortilla call hot dog  lol   margarita yummy too! waitress nice  mention ate same amount usually eat when eat except time didnt end spending over 100$ including drinks  atmosphere great made feel desperately wanting beach  <EOR> I've twice last two weeks more visits sure     First mention incredibly friendly entire staff is    The first time cigar lounge   good very comfortable great place few drinks cigars    several tvs plenty comfy chairs sofas there   four exhaust fans clear smoke very well   Now bad very hot cigar room around 5 6pm hot day   Also cigar selection great   problem cigar shop same shopping center just short walk away     On second visit cigar room again but also spent some time patio   service great!  some appetizers tasty fresh   Misting system fresh guac great patio set up   Also date really liked sangria    I didn't give 5 stars because haven't tried entrees yet cigar room hot wrong time day    Might need some darker shades tint  <EOR> Let start stating 1 star decor atmosphere only     everything else restaurant downhill very quickly   My husband Wednesday evening   outside patio area very nice since dining room fairly empty opted sit outside   We waited 10 minutes before anyone approached table menus   server finally arrived took drink order     one specialty martinis blue moon  then just sat there     tick tock clock  last busboy came table asked if wanted any water   said yes asked if he could please also check status drink order    The wait just drinks outrageously ridiculous   party 6 sitting near enough     someone group took down drink order headed bar   yes received drinks before did   A good 25 minutes later seriously no joke drinks arrived  Yay! Maybe things better cocktail?     Not   We ordered fresh guacamole chips Flautas de Pato duck taquitos Arrachera Marinada marinated steak    The guacamole all right bad yet great  However chips accompanying guacamole just plain awful   sure if sitting oil long simply undercooked because chewy very chewy  Although props them attempting fresh chips??  My Flautas de Pato average      similar buying frozen food Costco deep frying them home  Wait take back     food Costco much better  But since starving ate half it   biggest disappointment  dish strawberry jalapeno salsa side  Maybe high expectations    but truly expecting see fresh strawberries most especially since season chopped some jalapeno   salsa more Smucker's strawberry jam chive top   No jalapeno anywhere  even hint jalapeno flavor   My husband ordered steak medium      came well done    Enough said   The table next asked if liked food told them truth  also agreed stated would return   Oh! table 6 dining near us?      left since service extremely slow   Maybe chef kitchen staff servers having off day? Regardless returning  <EOR>
