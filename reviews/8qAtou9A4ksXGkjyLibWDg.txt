Another reason why came back! <EOR> I am really good tipper   worked restaurant industry server bartender hostess know work tips   But first time entire life left restaurant without leaving tip   Let tell why     The BF Monte Carlo because seeing Jabbawokeez show   When picked tickets call ticket agent asked if eaten yet offered 20% off coupons d  Vino Asian noodle place next door   decided Italian because he said could definitely before show started just over hour     Things started off well   we seated immediately 'server' greeted few minutes take drink order   both stuck water   Then she left presumably give few minutes look menu   and never came back   waited full 15 minutes when manager saw doing 'look around server' thing he came over see if everything okay   When told ready order he took order     So let set timeline you   from time gave order another table seated next ordered food ate food paid bill left   all before food   swear am making up   Also mean time no server returned table   Only busser some bread   which really good btw     When food arrives no steak knife bf no checks see if need anything   then walk host stand where manager standing ask if even server bc no returned table since he took order other bring food   Yes he steak knife but lack apology action poor service incredibly frustrating     As far food shirmp scallops meal good BF's steak bad spinach good     When came time pay bill chose leave tip because honestly did know if anyone server was!  refused leave even sub par tip would someone never saw    Having worked restaurant industry all throughout college completely understand importance tipping   but case just couldn't it  <EOR> I would give restaurant 4 stars because quality service  Everyone very polite service great  manager nice servers very polite  Food quality alright  Appetizers great though  Would come due location service  <EOR> Just reservation 15 people did tell check could split  Also when eventually split check boyfriend gave waitress 10$ cash rest card  She did take $10 apart bill she kept TIP HERSELF charged boyfriend whole check card  Horrible place recommending <EOR> I staying Monte Carlo last weekend friend drove them LA Saturday starving  d Vino   We split five cheese plate bolognese burger  food seemed little overpriced $14 just burger but cheeses tasty really nice giving extra bread honey compote taste them with   I would back more cheese but probably meal  <EOR> Once again another excellent meal D'Vino   Only complaint latest visit did iced tea   figure  Other exceptional meal service  <EOR> So menu choices but goodness marinara great!!!  bought risotto friend appetizer pizza both better because marinara  menu just doesn't hit its stride  ok place but something your way for  <EOR> I liked seafood risotto liked added lot seafood dish but texture rice little raw me  still some sort crunch them  risotto bit more creamy perfect rice texture would when chewy but still little bounce each grain  kind hard describe rice okay?  Server nice fills water whenever he sees necessary  seated outside area which outside dining room but still inside casino  felt manager owner restaurant little rude  because he did something but because he never came over greet us  Even though he kept going over table next fill wine checking them  literally only 3 steps away never occurred paying customers how's food? would feel little invisible him  Two other tables around also missing attention shame being selective people pleaser   The bill came little bit costly side when didn't feel quality worth it  paid fraction cost something better  Although if over box office 20% off coupon use  Which try place first place  If passerby sure if would ate here    <EOR> We staying New York New York usual   thought we'd try some other M Life restaurants group selected D  Vino since love Ravioli veal stuffed menu   should tipped off when waited over 3 minutes front before waiter noticed front   He did nothing   Finally walked toward bar asked bar tender if he could seat   He nodded nothing happened   figured just shift change but 5 minutes later  should left but just then waiter noticed found seat   10 minutes later another waiter appeared menus   onsite 20 minutes finally menu   service smooth   ordered 20 minutes later Ravs Pasta arrived but no salad  Excuse ordered salad   Opps still want it? those questions could use comedy act no ordered because didn't want it  Skipped salad   pasta   fine then ravs cold veal center   now site hour   good news server never asked food other would take rest go?
