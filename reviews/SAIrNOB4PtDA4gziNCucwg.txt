Always great time literally live clams cheeeeesy broccoli good!!! Great hospitality amazing food more could want neighborhood bar restaurant?!!   Only downside bigger guy long beard  He literally looks he would excruciating pain if he smile kindly acknowledge guest bar  feel really uncomfortable when he turns around every five minutes talk quietly another bartender head down  Dear Mr Mean Bartender Guy hope 2016 better find some happiness because small part job bartender talk engage don't know snarl your guests spending money your bar     Thanks all great times herbs babies!! New cool hipster host dude pretty cool too  <EOR> Happy hour steaks! steaks bit pricey but feel pay for  giving place 4 stars only because every time feel ask bread basket multiple times awhile just gets annoying when finally brought just don't want same when asking steak sauce chimichurri  Overall great place happy hour steak  <EOR> Italian? more steakhouse anything else  Its also definitely $$$ vs $$ shows Yelp maybe even 4$     ++ happy hour 4pm 6pm midnight 3am well worth it  steaks half off   ++ quality truffle mac cheese rich fantastic  flat iron steak juicy flavorful    + cost split Caeser salad two door $55 total   stuffed fully satisfied   service very friendly albeit bit slow  but didn't mind seated table bar nice atmosphere  <EOR> Great food beautiful place but service slow   I ask order taken 30 min waiting    paying  credit card took another 40 min   like 3 hours    <EOR> I hardly ever write reviews but decided happily coming several times place definitely deserves 5 stars! Every time usually try sit Deborah because she's absolutely fantastic  She manages always remember even remembering signature cocktail order which weekend Waldorf great citrus drink cool off heat! top service food always impeccable  also work steakhouse strip little hole wall definitely holds any fine dining restaurant added casual local feel  outside may seem much especially considering surrounding area but inside whole other world! <EOR> So would share personal experience establishment  came party 8 Thursday night 6 30 HH  <EOR> If want spot bar come early  really best seat house  watch bartenders best  cocktail list ranges through eras history cocktail definitely something different fun everyone  also love use fresh ingredients abundance fruit adorning bar    We came quick quality craft cocktail weren't disappointed  tried Aviation Boulevardier  Both very well done    It's while since food but last half off steak excellent  Come full experience just drink  It'll worth your while  <EOR> The steak best     soooooo delicios   And  very romantic inside  good place romantic cozy date  Love it! <EOR> What amazing happy hour!!!!! can't express enough delicious wings filet sliders spicy mussels were!!!! Everything great always would given 5stars but told bartender twice needed check still wait while he talked some people  always say always good time <EOR> It pains give delicious food such low rating but two reasons it   1  prices  Without Happy Hour prices ridiculous  Ruth's Chris Steakhouse prices far superior cut meat same prices if less   2  service  Oye  party 7  Normally very forgiving mistakes big party  Things just bound wrong when many people serve  wasn't problem here  problem restaurant almost 2 hours saw waiter 4 times  Maybe 5  He came took orders then he disappeared  35 minutes later haven't received any food haven't seen waiter 35 minutes  Several wanted order another round drinks stuck trying waive someone down  No ever came  Finally he came food quickly ordered drinks while him  He disappeared again until he came around check   The worst part restaurant wasn't even crowded when there  counted 7 8 other tables seated it  When you've big party know you're getting mandatory tip shouldn't grounds just ignore group collect your cash end night  If manager going around asking patrons doing might able point problem him  But wasn't  Guess bad service starts top works its way down   To fair food itself delicious which why still giving 1 star  Everyone happy everything came all meat cooked perfectly  flavors fabulous   great spot some yummy food but I'd suggest never going large parties during regularly priced hours  <EOR> This place just incredible  Hand crafted old school cocktails die for  hope patience because service always bit bit slow but realize cocktails take time  don't mind  worth it  food always outstanding  I'd recommend going happy hour Everything half off thus making rather expensive meal very affordable! Even steaks half off! bartenders servers even porters all top notch professional! Very much appreciated! spot real Vegas Gem! <EOR> Great Service Great food Great Drinks  Always great time  Everything delicious hospitality beyond words  <EOR> Our expectations might high due many 5 star reviews promising online menu glorious pictures yelpers posted    But just average us   drinks good but didn't feel unique exceptional   ordered Vieux Jack Rose Ward Eight which all recommendations server   food ordered Ribeye NY strip mac cheese garlic mash average but didn't hold against them much because happy hour pricing   Overall value wise very affordable   Also interesting note if call before open 5pm think you're going told number service   Now where message when your number disconnected you're no longer business   thought place gone business until called right 5pm just hell hostess picked up   LOL  <EOR> I wife sat bar   Great romantic atmosphere   place all prohibition Era drinks bartender fabulous  lot local people    not strip   happy hour prices great value   meatball appetizer Boulevardier perfect combination food drink   ribeye garlic mash Brussel sprouts dinner     Great food service people ambiance  <EOR> I several times now never disappoints! 120 oz steak happy hour six people great deal fun experience  Truffle Mac swine sprouts mushrooms all legit!

Normally when order clams little bit grit somewhere dish but wasn't any all this  served big chunk bread dip delicious white wine sauce clams come in    We both ordered steak which half off during happy hour come free side asparagus truffled mac n cheese  all excellent    We weren't sure if wanted dessert but Mike said Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet favorite really good let's just say found room quickly finish it!

I've roughly around 35 times last few years  Great quality steaks fun romantic atmosphere depending you're going for extensive cocktail menu   Also huge local spot very likely you'll run into someone especially if work industry   Oh 50% off steaks during Happy Hour 5 8 pm midnight closing what's love?!   I've tried majority menu favorites are Filet mignon all steaks delicious  Pick whichever cut prefer high quality meat you'd find strip without ridiculous prices *the chimmichuri sauce good! also house rub but beware very spicy   Sweet potato tots just try these  good    Truffle Mac Cheese Yes  Just yes    Jalapeño creamed corn tend less often but yummy    Truffle fries Simple truffle fries but always hit spot   All sides generous portion each steak comes included price  Also flatbreads all great  favorites Bistecca Bruschetta    For drinks recommend Moscow Mule Weekend Waldorf!  All all love place that's why keep coming back   only thing would improve service spotty sometimes amazing service sometimes very so so  <EOR> So night culinary adventures last Friday finally time yelp it  started off Herbs Rye which driven past umpteenthousand times without even noticing  inside very swanky almost Rat Pack feel if Sinatra should come other room telling scram you're seat  kind place where booze cold broads hot  Wow waiting FOREVER use line conversation  The food good  Maybe just looking bar menu but selection seemed kind small  seemed like Appetizer Flatbread Pizza Big Fat Steak end  But ordered hot wings which satisfactorily spicy  tried some friend's sweet potato tater tots but wasn't sold them   But drinks    oooh lordie  If more two prepared designated driver  ordered Long Beach Iced Tea which when made right should subtle red fuschia color it  dark means weak drink light means much alcohol   The drink came back looked less cocktail more serving pink lemonade Crystal Light   Needless say only ordered one   I'm knocking place  If invited back friends I'd certainly go  But such good first impression kind fizzled out  <EOR> I really wanted absolutely love place but just didn't love much wanted to  decor gorgeous dining room much smaller expected but really nice  server friendly helpful  linguine some sweet potato tots  tots great sweet  pasta little spicy soupy taste the chili flakes dispersing broth   friend shared cookie dessert  nice hot cake ice cream delicious  All all dinner nice liked everything but entree  Nice place date night private event  <EOR> Wow!  sister told try place amazing  Great service wonderful food plethora amazing drink options  bone pork which cooked perfection  sides garlic mashed potatoes Brussel sprouts  ask cooked could try recreate yumminess  didn't first drink waiter promptly suggested new brought me  Happy hour way go!  5 8 12 3  early Tuesday filled 5 30  <EOR> This new place eat grab drink or 3 enjoy company great group customers superior wait bar staff   Every time travel Vegas try work evening Herbs Rye  menu complicated yet offers nice variety dining choices  Quality beef really good  But most fun sitting bar working through menu drinks  Don't work through many drinks or   well   end needing late checkout next day!  favorite drink far Vieux Carrè   Do yourself favor away Strip evening share good food drink locals  Oh two yep two happy hours!

BIG PARTY BEWARE! BIG PARTY BEWARE! So would share personal experience establishment  came party 8 Thursday night 6 30 HH  Since am local made sure reservation just case gets busy  Shortly received call confirmation  host very nice told HH would 20% gratuity large parties which pretty basic big party procedure  Everything great arrive time seated fairly fast    Right when seated server busser introduced themselves told HH 20% gratuity big parties which fine  BUT COURSE HE WOULD FAIL MENTION SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT betcha LOT won't really noticed this    But looking 50% off steaks think yourself nice deal right? WRONG! least big parties auto gratuity during HH   I shall explain told 20% grat would added bill correct? example ate $200 worth food but HH $100 then adding 20% grat TOTAL should EQUAL $120  FAILED MENTION GRAT BASED FULL PRICED MENU PRICE  does mean? WELL   INSTEAD 20 off $100 its 20 off $200 which EQUAL $40  INSTEAD $120 would charged $100 + $40 the actual grat = $140  you're basically paying 40% tip  INSANE!!!   It screams SCAM SCAM SCAM! think suckers!!! such BAD ETHIC your restaurant  only did fail mention beginning seating  also failed mention when asked policy during confirmation called  Quite frankly feel CHEATED think we're idiots  Plus restaurant dim very hard read anything   I did find until going over finance visit     If knew policy would split party into 4 4 avoided excessive charged but know when all your staffs just told would 20% gratuity which normally amount tip anyways   PLEASE check your bills guys seriously because readjust bill unless there  Unfortunately found when back home Cali   yes already talked management much do  But all yelpers hopefully post help reconsider  <EOR> Made reservations online 7pm dinner immediately received confirmation Michelle Meyer   Shortly moved reservation 7 30pm Michelle responded sure    We arrived 7 05pm but circled parking lot twice thought maybe should eat elsewhere   However 15 minutes circling Chinatown decided try Herbs Rye once more   Found parking spot point 7 25pm   Walked sleuth people waiting looking very anxious   Approached Brittney podium immediately attacked loud tone late can't hold tables more 30 minutes   explained reservation changed 7 30pm   Showed email Brittney's response well no told me! husband shocked spoken matter front line customers   waiting area very small narrow waiting customers can't help but hear conversation  Brittney says we'll need wait 30 minutes since she never informed   even apology   We walked  refuse ridiculed belittled 21 year old no clue when comes service   Treating customers if should honored she's holding golden key into dining Herbs Rye   We drove Southwest side because raving reviews recommendations restaurant   No thank you    wasting hard money tactless experience   opted dinner Strip   Pricier but better classier dining experience    It's unfortunate Britney Herb Rye's front face first point contact   Suggestion send customer service etiquette training  <EOR> Decent steak prices    pushy service   This place hood   looks ghetto outside but actually very nice inside   reservations 5 30 Happy Hour 5 8 however nobody being let nobody restaurant telling growing crowd going which beyond frustrating   delivery people trying but wouldn't let them either     They finally opened doors 6pm checked in   #NOTE If want booth    reserve while you're making reservation   knew?

Others it  Anyways sure  happy hour when meant 1 2 off some drinks appetizers steaks  clams appetizers nice  also wedge salad no bacon  But did tell before ordered? Nope  runs bacon? 400 stores around buy some? Anyways decided kitchen sink stew my husband asked try some before but said no  14oz New York steak  also 2 sides button mushrooms asparagus  steak great cooked perfectly sides ok nothing special  kitchen sink stew overly spicy tiny pieces shell basically gave anxiety attack while eating could freaking shell wasn't seeing  Even waiter noticed small pieces it  Overall crappy experience worth repeating   PS wow Herbs Rye judgey look like? Shame you! <EOR> You can't place especially during happy hour where most steaks half off  only half off but might some best steaks ever tried! NY Strip which cooked perfection just seasoned perfectly  didn't need any sauces additions taste better   I thought drinks good but prices bit steep but unexpected    The donuts die for  Seriously best had    dipping sauces absolute perfect complement! Wow! worth trip just these!!!  The atmosphere dark prohibition feel  wasn't sure think initially but works  play music era which adds ambiance  finally service super friendly spot on    I would highly recommend place if visiting Vegas! <EOR> This favorite cocktail lounge Las Vegas  If want avoid strip wacky loud nightclubs repetitive electronic beats while getting fantastically crafted cocktail Herbs Rye you   started Old Fashioned followed Sazerac Moscow Mule Pisco Sour Pimms Cup   Marone mia!

Secret now discovered   A little history place which learned server used hangout ratpack  Yes its old but history behind place aura projects must tell classic    Unfortunately only visited enjoy check raved cocktails   enjoyed few different cocktails all unique its own way  little skeptical because am vodka drinker only 2 3 cocktails vodka  majority drinks contain gin  asked recommend it   Cocktails Ramos Gin Fizz Now creamy creation  warn take awhile because 3 steps making drink all which require patience time  really interested because ingredients egg white  Never seen heard being used  drink delicious creamy sweet couldn't even taste alcohol  Definitely recommend one!  Blood Sand honestly only ordered see presentation  spark mini fire blaze orane peel end  your video out! drink bit strong scotch pretty prominent served martini    Corpse Reviver No 2 only thing remember much could taste absinthe  Vesper only ones vodka  Served martini definitely strong taste alcohol I guess Gin Vodka could not    We sat bar pretty busy far service above average  bartender super busy entire time wouldn't say he nicest guy but he made amazing cocktails    I definitely want back try food  Half off all steaks happy hour   FYI! <EOR> Kind odd experience don't know it   trying find decent old school cocktail place town   heard good things place decided check out   Some friends ours wanted met them Thursday night around 7 8pm   Our friends before when walked saw them looked really freaked out   only people dining room sitting table old man corner playing keyboards   Kinda reminded Swingers the movie except fact place empty    No dining room few people bar   When sat down friends kept whispering weird place was   ordered some drinks friends already some food which ok but nothing special   drinks also ok but nothing special   Maybe spoiled trips NY SF need just accept fact LV reach level   ordered mint julep but didn't come special metal cup which made sad   Accurate glassware important me   husband thought Moscow Mule ok but enough come back   The keyboard guy then decided come over talk us   He pretty much incomprehensible   entirely sure he wanted   place fairly inexpensive but kind creeps out   can't really expect much late night 24 hour? bar town   Oh well search excellent cocktail Vegas continues  <EOR> Great ambiance! Pork figs die for    Very good staff    Great cocktails  awesome birthday dinner delicious donuts <EOR> Great food interesting atmosphere  meat lovers check out!! Some food also half off during happy hour  <EOR> Without help yelp probably wouldn't consider place just looking outside   Mainly because just looks bar   Walking looks cozy burgundy wallpaper brick dim lighting  first asked if over 21 years old  sat booth alongside bar   Candle centerpiece   Black napkin wrapped utensils side plates   Large steakhouse style menu  old western black white playing tv  server pretty hair makeup styled theme   Merlot Napa Pinot noir him   Although didn't order cocktails appreciated art bartenders craft  Working nightlife am accustomed quick pour drinks  nice change pace  napkin didn't appear washed thoroughly   server quickly replaced it  She suggested beef carpaccio penne   chose carpaccio over clams originally picked out   He ordered rib eye spinach side   carpaccio came quickly  Arugula tossed truffle oil atop meat drizzled balsamic vinegar capers  Very fresh delicious  Large serving but filling when shared between two us  steak!  Mmm steak     Ribeye  Nicely seasoned  Cooked perfection   Juicy tender  love fat ribeye favorite cuts   place did justice  bf course asked A1  served sauce cup  spinach side bit small ordered little neck clams  When arrived server spilled sauce table boyfriends hand   Probably because plate hot  She apologized but did wipe picked some empty plates instead   clams nice small sauce little creamy taste herbs  bread came dipping nice sour soft middle  boyfriend waited while refill wine   Another server ended coming asked if he needed another  few moments later server came check up   bf asked extra napkins clean spill earlier when she wiped up  then clams done  Shortly wine arrived other server   Minutes informed now happy hour  Clams wine happy hour Unfortunately waited them minutes before happy hour started   desserts offered verbally  Baked cookie topped ice cream sugar donuts  photos yelp led donuts  Ohh my    10 mini donuts donut holes   Soft warm crunch sugar  Caramel white chocolate dipping  ate every bite meal but 2 clams   No box?

Rachel 40 min before party's reservation decided sit bar some drinks salad appetizer  being greeted bartender didn't see again another 15 min sat around waiting order taken  bartender doesn't ask drink order right away?  After everyone placed orders proceeded wait 45 50 min before any food even came out  wondering if even going come all! When food arrived brought everyone's except Roger's no explanation any kind   it almost forgot he ordered anything  When brought server's attention she checked came back inform just fired would shortly no further explanation happened original order nor apology  10 15 min passes before server returns inform Roger's steak would soon overcooked original one  Funny would wait tell instead being front it   I call bs!  When Roger's steak finally came overcooked cooked medium rare ordered  hard steak restaurant overcook 2 steaks row?! debacle still wanted charge steak first then decided end   I'm sure heard all Yelpers lol! But seriously place ridiculous  No updates your food no service whatsoever  almost don't care if customers happy definitely not   At end night attempted settle table's tab  asked server beginning meal split tabs however end meal she told wasn't possible  WTF! Why didn't just tell first place? manager came explain against store policy split checks groups 6 more people   Ok possible   you're just going it? says that? Especially crap service just endured?   It debacle trying figure tab due run dozen cards separately  almost wanted group just leave because servers didn't know going except couldn't split tab  If wasn't manager coming handle situation pretty sure would've taken longer 30 min figure would've just left  don't patience time deal crap this  your shit together don't run business! also pissed see 20% auto gratuity which bs because deserve nothing  Save your time your money avoid place  many other steak places Vegas there's really nothing special one  Steaks overpriced just happy hour 50% deal even then appetizers $15 sides $7 sauces $3 50 such crap place  even fancy all  <EOR> I wanting come long time since always pass it  boyfriend Friday night all ourselves decided dinner here  Happy Hour 5pm 8pm  Which great!

No you'd McDonald's   5 Don't start your review  words vegan No one cares   6 Don't spend 30 mins venue give 3 star review then state because didn't enough time give them appropriate evaluation  Why fudge reviewing them first place?

Vanilla crème brulee also amazing    Everything seating server greet service food delivery attentiveness staff impeccable   However complaint   Because party 10 states menu don't split checks parties 7 more   Perhaps should exception rule because would things much easier guests everyone would know portion pay wouldn't sit 25 more minutes trying figure everyone owed bill why some people didn't put enough money   allowing split check would gave server back tables much quicker restaurant could turned table least more time   reason splitting checks i e  people walking bills system freezes etc but sometimes restaurant should exception rule   Otherwise everything delicious perfect!  definitely back again enjoy amazing food drinks!

More tables started arrive he take care each them instead returning deliver drinks take order  sat watched server take 3 orders other tables before even coming back us  point already restaurant 45 minutes no drink no order placed  Now being service industry myself understand gets busy behind but least acknowledge table waiting long time all ask for  server finally came over take order politely reminded still received tea coke ordered  even apologetic anything just took order returned drinks  food came timely manner delicious always  He checked maybe time took another 25 minutes done eating check pay  ordeal just enjoy dinner boyfriend       seriously given place three other chances since then change mind failed each time  service gets worse every single time its servers don't even care  happy hour great food die but hate being neglected paying tipping customer  Ive come all different times just during happy hour its still awful  saddens even write because only place Vegas knows cook steak properly  <EOR> If love much why don't marry it?

Herbs Rye covered  Perhaps something Gothic Age American Drinking? Wait  heck does even mean? Regardless your back too!  On other side coin Herbs Rye some fantastic food offerings  Did someone say happy hour? selection steaks half off during HH  first visit Kansas City Strip Steak side Truffle Mac Cheese during HH only side instead two   While steak flavorful admit envious neighbor's Flat Iron  definitely instead next time  Outside steaks also Clams appetizer section also half off during HH   OMG those incredible  basically bowl clams buttery sauce awesomeness  side come two pieces toasted baguette  Trust when say those enough  ended asking more bread just could soak them buttery goodness  Yes know  Healthy be   Will return? hot Vegas July? Does flash flood when rains? dark here? <EOR> The outside place does give any justice  outside establishment looks cheap bar  However inside totally different  atmosphere bar 60's Sinatra times  lighting very dark matter fact dark even read menu  drink menu pretty cool large variety unique drinks which illustrate specific period time  Some time representations Prohibition Gothic Golden age etc   speciality steaks  During happy hour every day 5 8 steaks appetizers 50% off  ordered Kansas City bone in  which good choice if grilled taste  Filet Mignon which juicy very tender  sides very mediocre  something could probably home no problem and good cook   ordered mac n cheese jalapeño corn equally disappointing  saw lot small plates look really good perhaps would come back try them instead steak  Oh FYI read menu cannot share your steak if buy during happy hour! Even though never planned sharing annoys when establishment tells paying your food! <EOR> It good service second arrived almost full house  portions little smaller but form happy hour specials bigger most places  both fillet prepared excellently  chocolate chip cookie desert made fresh per order worth 10 min wait! <EOR> WOW!  best porterhouse steak ever life!!!  sure during happy hour all steaks half price!

The MAC n Chess just average   Is worth $12 Uber ride strip? probably would back try more Italian food  <EOR> I definitely surprised when walked into restaurant   From exterior Herbs Rye looks kind place where people line dancing almost shed like    But once inside noticed place actually very nice  Black Red walls all black furniture door concealed book case feel you're 1940's Italian mafia movie  Even better service which feel you're practically family   As food enjoyed very much  flat bread appetizer good time entree came full    The drinks selection all age prohibition also something enjoyed  Most drinks strong but appreciated fact all juices mixers fresh mention nice see something different    On last note place great because off strip so avoid hassles crowds valet but still strip quality     I should probably add brought local I'm L A  named Jesse  if people Herbs Rye happen read thank review <EOR> This place great! happy hour sat bar area!
