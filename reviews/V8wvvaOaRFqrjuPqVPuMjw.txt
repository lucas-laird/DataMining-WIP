Geilled Pickled jalapeños  Smh!! <EOR> Not only disappointed customer service food came looked horrible  greasy lacked luster  find better way spend $12 next time  <EOR> The falafel good! Tabouli fresh  hummus pita also great! should try too  Don't fooled 3 stars <EOR> After long day shopping kids stop food court potty break   While browsing noon munchie options decided try place Pita's which also Philly Cheese steak place well   did know guy running both outlets first until ordered walked over other register asked if needed cheese steak well     He very helpful surprisingly   He made sure wanted everything ordered  example when ordered falafel he said want hummus tahini lettuce tomato pita   most places explain everything that   am sure he did because he probably gets lot people order really sure getting seeing mall Premium Outlets South mostly Las Vegas Tourists    ensuring order correct when placed puts blame mistakes customer instead business operator   Smart Guy!  He did same when ordered Cheese steak well   He through ingredients including cheese whiz sauce would added sandwich   also wanted lettuce tomato mayo added he repeated back well ensuring clear ordering     The food came decent time   call your number pick food other end Philly counter   Pita sandwich good well fallafel hummus   veggies nice fresh meaning lettuce tomatoes good bright colorful chunks   could tell using fresh produce   sandwich little small meat portion but delicious fresh made just way ordered it   understand portion control consistency important when operating biz meat expensive   am sure rent place Ridiculous!  We finished meal beverage back counter ask refill he gladly took care it   guy even asked meal tasting  Amazing!  thought service received good   man actually cared experience which very important small business owner  man its    The only reason gave them 3 stars becuase frumpy looking women sitting chair behind counter   No smile No hello no intention doing near future top ofit she EATING! wrap sandwich right food prep area guest view   care world   big NO!

The pita dry stale crumbled when touched    The meat Gross!  Zero flavor   Presented dried shoe sole   meat packaged into small plastic bags dipped vat boiling water heat it!!  The tzaki  sauce lumpy huge chunks if cucumber   No flavor forgot dill!   Save your $$$  Dont it! <EOR> The veggie plate very good mall food  I enjoyed hummus falafel  guy working register covering two restaurants efficiently kudos him  would stop again  suggestion would rid Styrofoam switch paper plates  <EOR> I spent most childhood growing Middle East  Since there's lot Middle Eastern restaurants where live always lookout authentic Middle Eastern food when travel  place authentic  Yes use words kabob falafel reel but  all empty words   I ordered chicken kabob sandwich very disappointed dry unseasoned chicken was  wasn't even hint Middle Eastern spices grew  supposed tantalize every bite  hummus just mashed chick peas devoid any seasoning  know shouldn't expect much mall food but wanted even just HINT flavor  only added extra star because mall establishment  <EOR>
