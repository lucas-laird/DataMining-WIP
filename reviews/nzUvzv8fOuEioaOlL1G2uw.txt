Watch your wallet care your health  other Korean restaurants! <EOR> I might black sheep but actually Sandai alot   see lot reviews prior 2011 maybe changed management improved lot things  Ever since going since February 2011 great food OK service not exceptionally good but bad all    honest shocked see only half star rating Yelp! give little two cents   First off venue pretty small but cozy   maximum capacity dining room probably less 25 may give rough idea small is   The only thing ever blood sausage soup Soon Dae Guk cold noodles Chin Naeg Myung    soup mostly chilly February March days cold noodle excellent hot summer day   blood sausage soup spicy but served extremely hot   I am absolutely huge fan cold noodles say Sandai comes close having best cold noodles Las Vegas and better ones L A     heard Mother's Grill great noodles but haven't tried theirs yet   Sandai's cold noodles way better DJK's opinon   just love authentic North Korean taste for record owners South Korean  record South Korean well   North Korean cold noodle style more tangy flavor more fond noodles served thin liking  hate some cold noodles served much MSG noodles thick other venues   I hope shed some light restaurant   service good food never fails disappoint know common face restaurant treat pretty well   can't speak any other dishes but if you're fan cold noodles try Sandai  <EOR> My girlfriend strip mall due washing machine malfunction home conveniently located laundromat  could chosen many places eat night Korean BBQ place Mexican Japanese sushi spot kabob joint etc  All within 5 minutes walk laundromat  But no feeling adventurous night  great sushi rare Sandai Sushi looked extremely authentic Japanese restaurant  mean even gold nekochan behind bar!   So walk greeted well elderly Asian lady order rainbow roll Unagi roll because normally induces state total awareness  Both rolls induced state dismal malaise frequent trips bathroom next day work both awkward strangely enlightening  girlfriend tapped first rainbow roll foolishly few each  fish old rice fell apart contact yet oddly chewy    Great service but food week old just might kill you    TLDR this place garbage but Wendy's across parking lot fantastic  <EOR> So needed sushi fix decided try place since its close house big mistake!!!   Where start???   So walk place dead! only people place two employees looked real bored    So ordered Boba green tea which OK mess safe ordered Tempura Ca Roll ummm pretty disappointed lacking avocado kinda flavorless thank god eel sauce  only reason could finish flavorless yuckalicious roll! sister ordered Shrimp Tempura Roll also disappointed    Not only food bad but service!

We found local newspapers having 2 1 deal Korean Nangmyun decided go   walked asked if newspaper advertisement true said yes   ordered 4 those several other plates   Once done waitress asked if valid Las Vegas license confused   She said she forgot mention but special locals only   course upset people group remembered never seeing advertised   She left newspaper car didn't bother bringing verify   owner brought newspapers showed advertisement said small writing Las Vegas residence only   upset but asked receipt paid but didn't leave tip bad service     When into car driving away newspaper didn't see Las Vegas residence only advertised realized newspaper misprint called them let them know newspaper misprint   Well     we didn't far time part newspaper advertisement particular didn't say local residence owner stopped track   He said if good food complaining about?  should enough hung phone   Just bad service general   Food wasn't bad thinking coming back lunch next day but obviously didn't   ever happen customer service? <EOR> Great selection sushi rolls spicy Korean dishes! Also Chinese entrees available  Great large parties because many choices  Kimchis no use made delicious  Atmosphere service excellent  Owner works days nice  <EOR> Cute little place corner shopping center   When walk immediately notice way arranged intimate tables decor sweet all little personal touches   But food good?  love it   service good staff friendly took good care us   On today's menu ordered combination plate california roll chicken breast tempura mixed   comes two salads white rice miso soup   fresh tasty really liked combination   Of course also ordered couple sushi rolls first caterpillar roll which eel crab cucumber avocado red dragon roll crab meat cucumber avocado fresh tuna   Both fresh very good helped complete really good meal    For small place enjoy intimacy service food  <EOR> I didn't eat there   the food looked ok saw but far worst boba tea ever   even boba??? <EOR> OK made mistake   tried new place prior checking Yelp!!!   Reason being knew sushi place around corner house however could think name nor locate google  said hell let's check out    When walked place empty only customer  Hmmmm?
