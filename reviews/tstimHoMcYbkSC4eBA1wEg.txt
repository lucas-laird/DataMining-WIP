 flavorful without having spicy   could tell fresh because diced onions still crisp cilantro nice green     We ordered Tampiquena which recommended server Spicy Devil Chicken   Tampiquena great!  perfectly marinated flap steak enchilada beans rice salsa guacamole   Spicy Devil Chicken alright   little salty taste but asked side crema able fix it     While waiting food walked bakery  connected restaurant picked some pastries dessert   Most items less dollar!  bag pastries less $3! <EOR> My go to northeast side town   Inside small restaurant sits 40 people  Seating open your preference  Booths comfy but limited leg space tall people problems   noise level always calm since never packed  Sit left side if want watch some Tele'Mundo Lol  Decorations consist paintings walls some hanging Latin streamers   As far 4 page menu everything under $15 there's wide variety choose all very filling  Fajitas your choice any meat always comes packed ton flavor  shrimp never fail impress picky gut  Enchilada Style Burritos Chimichangas huge! weird part cheapest entrees menu too  charge extra if substitute steak only shrimp  Food doesn't take but 10 minutes come but while wait freshly made delicious tortilla chips salsa brought keep happy  tell truth its biggest reason keep coming back  D After dining sure stop next door linked bakery some fresh pastries take home  worth your money   Overall say prices quality there's no need Lindo Michioacan if reside area  Great job chef!

We also ate chips guacamole ordered  good fresh guac but seemed plain taste   We didn't care shrimp fajitas butter garlic shrimp much very special  crispy shrimp tacos big bust opinion because expected deep fried breaded shrimp thought menu meant when said crispy but apparently description only referring taco shell which cancelled when asked tacos wrapped flour tortilla instead  Furthermore nothing sour cream crema which odd me  guess just didn't realize order separately   The Chilles Relleno SUPERB  dad impressed tasty dish came out! If ever visit restaurant certainly dish try  spongy egg but also satisfyingly saucy same time  lot good flavor too  portion size another thing happy also   Overall wouldn't look forward ordering anything but Chilles Relleno   thing try hands down  <EOR> We used Mama Maria's many years ago but some reason stopped  We gone 3 times last month dinner   very americanized mexican restaurant very seldom see latinos except staff  Food very good portion sizes average $$   Ignacio both shrimp dish while he 7 shrimp only 6 order  Most places normally include 8 shrimp but noticed cut down 7 lately but never 6  Beans rice decent best thing overload food white yellow cheese lot places  Service good friendly  small place sometimes only 1 waitress doing all  We love tostada size chips salsa serve start  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!!! Sure tiny hot summer but food fantastic  chips salsa best  inherited place friends passed down new friends  even though don't live close any more still Mexican food restaurant  <EOR> Excellent food great service most time  favorite waitress Maribel always friendly welcoming  Never bad meal here  eat pretty much every Friday night  <EOR> Great place Mexican food  stopped way through Vegas road trip really enjoyed authentic food  Family run good prices  <EOR> Went long ago waitress late opening store wait 20 Mins  Food good but when walked use restroom back saw cook spit into hope sink? Pretty gross habit especially while cooking others   <EOR> Service rotten  Didn't chips till dinner served  Chips actually more fried corn tortillas  only server taking care entire restaurant  Ordered water but never came  Girlfriend ordered chili relleno excellent   shrimp tacos  plate just covered lettuce tomatoes but once bearings delicious  Rice beans ok but guacamole delicious very generous portion might add  When check finally came found overcharged  discrepancy price presented menu price ticket plate ordered  don't think ever happened ever restaurant before but since small discrepancy paid left  If establishment would step service honor prices menu well worth trip  last thing before looked menu online menu restaurant did same items little weird  <EOR> Along fact bad experience before waitress problem sewage smell coming through door upon walking am absolutely appalled service received today waitress named Gloria  received very bad service before but because food decent figured would give another chance thought she just bad day  Upon walking sit down she takes order does even ask if want anything drink let alone even offer option chips salsa   She immediately sits down gets phone starts chatting laughing asked if some water along having free salsa chips normally offered  She told charged second round chips salsa first free if eat restaurant  She assumed going take food which puzzled why she never even asked first place whether going take food immediately took upon herself charge me  Already feeling irritated service asked manager she gave name manager along days he worked  She also stated name very rude way then turned around complete she doing kitchen along canceling order   The reason why come place because food good they're close area residence yet because still does give anyone reason treat customers lack service  spoken manager before he seems very nice guy would rectify situation but just hoping future management would more aware  waitresses treat customers    Being Las Vegas many Mexican restaurants city believe would behoove any Mexican restaurant owner business sure cut above rest due high competition    The only reason why gave them two stars because food decent although last time when she brought chips oily cold  asked Ms Gloria reheat them where attitude started me  eating past two years never any issues service    In case Ms  Gloria really left bad taste mouth don't think coming back restaurant anytime soon! <EOR> Best most authentic Mexican food Las Vegas!!!! delicious tacos love enchiladas guadalajara fried ice cream scrumptious!! <EOR> Delicious!
