Good luck God Speed whoever decides eat there! <EOR> I really wanted give place higher rating  2 30 place completely empty  other table seated  sat bar ordered AYCE  Considering only people would think sushi chef would happy serve us  Nope! entire time having yell attention some food  top he taking forever acting he way busy us  Hello dude only ones stop being slow! order roll when receive order next roll want come there's no waiting between dishes  guy refused next roll until completely done server cleared plates    2 stars great tasting fish <EOR> One star  should half star! yah place sucks big time! totally! im never coming back here!
