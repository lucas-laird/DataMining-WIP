I ordered animal style hamburger hand leafed lettuce tomato mustard cooked beef patty add pickle extra spread grilled onions animal style fries melted Cheese Secret Spread looks Thousand Island dressing Grilled Onions   should picked cheeseburger instead hamburger just more textures  would try Protein style burger wrapped lettuce instead buns since sounds healthier     Although some people find animal style bit greasy heavy find perfect since made fries even more flavorful! parents' friends loved In N Out much said wouldn't mind eating everyday while still Vegas they loved more Shake Shack ! <EOR> My family  eat In Out  frequently when Austin since don't border town live in   burgers terrific fries much better other fast food restaurants   would given them 5 stars but don't rewards app online order pay app   normally pick something son lives Austin take food eat house   But inside nice eat well very clean!  app order pay would help lot because drive thru hard husband sometimes  double double all that   and son always wants something secret menu   by way animal fries french fries cut shape animals   we found hard way when ordered 3 animal fries   but anyways addition food servers super sweet nice! always think those kids most employees younng probably working 3 jobs just live Austin yet all patient always smiling! <EOR> What all hype about??  burgers greasy fries great   Sorry n only 2 stars me  <EOR> I missed In N Out terribly being rude opened store Austin Texas yet   Seriously why me?  hoping MAYBE remembered food being better really burger places around actually yummier     Nope   Double doubles all then some   fries heaven   probably shouldn't eaten because now won't satisfied burgers Texas   Tip walk strip   Just walk down sidewalk excalibur side street across freeway bridge entrance area under another little bridge you're there   15 minute walk   took cab because didn't know where but totally felt silly when then walked back  <EOR> It's always cold here!!!

Yup love it  <EOR> I'll honest much fast food person  Therefore no real opinions In N Out versus Five Guys since both actually taste pretty much same me  came location because friend group never fabled In N Out burger before needed try while Vegas    The restaurant packed nines 11 30AM Friday  barely managed snag table  wait food wasn't long though  burger decent but fries really disappointing  fries soggy hard eat  I ate barely half them  friends ordered theirs animal style onions quite undercooked  All all much more disappointing last In N Out experience LA  <EOR> I disappointed In n Out  always guilty pleasure during college  man those animal style fries! If don't know them yet you're missing out   Very cheap place food if you're willing fork much $$  only downside isn't strip   You come when dark see cool sign light up! regret it  <EOR> Always good choice  think place really attractive because right corner two busy streets sign visible right off freeway   only reason why know n over otherwise would never thought coming here   I also think really cool merchandise store  In N Out always cool stuff wear but California really don't advertise clothing stop think really different being Vegas  #SG #StreetGold <EOR> Every n gets five stars book     man wish would come midwest already!!! Every time west priority number double double animal style   This specific n gift shop right next door thats pretty cool if want n tshirt maybe flip flops   haha <EOR> Location bit off beaten path but trek over try N Out  heard they're opening location Strip which very convenient future travelers   Service quick nice staff  definitely busy but luckily able snag clean table  Wait time acceptable   As food itself just wasn't impressed  basic combo meal hamburger  I'd give burger 3 5  bun probably best part patty tasting bit bland  fries 2 5  bit soggy plain no salt although give packet add which did    worth food did keep full long time    I'm glad say tried N but probably wouldn't back again  <EOR> I don't hype place   Maybe west coast thing but burgers small thin bland special sauce whack   Cookout greater In N Out burger  <EOR> Boy place hyped up! Everyone talks great In N Out is   the anticipation high  burger complete let down  mean Five Guys much better   and fries too  Animal style   not good  just don't understand hype  experience cool though  Taking cab place then flagging cab lot back  Seems common since everyone inside cabbed it  very busy but must say disappointed   booooo! <EOR> hot days very hungry   and faund places very tasty big hamburger prices good cold deink woth ice  i places   <EOR> Its long long time place completely lived its hype! Simplicity key! Burgers fries soda milkshakes no fancy nonsense here! ordered double double animal style order fries soda each glorious! Its probably good thing only west coast because would friggen house if near me! <EOR> Biggest Hype Ever  Think movie everyone told would blow your mind when credits began rolling end it? In n out Burger kind me   Before even entering place annoying because many people bothering money  Vegas but isn't fun dealing people essentially waiting your car ask money  Then inside you're seems longest line ever  Disney world land ride all burger fries  Then if eat you've figure where sit  Good luck because place packed tourist all across midwest essentially getting elusive double double   So order double double because special sauce theirs some fries  don't monkey style any other those weird secret menu things may may have  just want burger fries   The burger fine  Typical fast food burger say meat better most but fries absolute worst  cooked something soggy potato  good good at  can't burger without having some fries can't eat fries can't fan place   So many bomb bomb bomb burger places Las Vegas totally those gotta try least once but okay that  <EOR> This place CRAZY busy even INO! parking inadequate size dining room may park down street  food good would expect INO     nothing gripe about  If tourist strip would probably come but if looking INO probably isn't location want choose  <EOR> SEX BUN!
