Ginormous cakes case waiting line almost exciting  Heading Vegas couple weeks totally plan pay visit  Already planning order pastrami sammie knish chocolate cake    party same coz we're sharing portions huge! <EOR> Located inside Treasure Island pastrami outstanding!  Piled high good rye bread  Several kinds mustards try table   Well worth your time  parking easier LA location  <EOR> Came famished mostly because positive Yelp reviews spot right Treasure Island where staying   Sorry say but impressed     Way much corned beef sandwiched between 2 thin slices bread   might well meat entree   meat thick could bite into without slices slipping falling apart land plate instead mouth   swiss cheese rubbery texture lacked any cheese flavour  fact rather artificial tasting   sandwich came only cheese loads meat   Condiments self serve table     The saddest part meat itself  pastrami corned beef supposedly Canter's signature items    corned beef far delicious actually force myself finish even half sandwich because oversatiated but because aroma meat starting feel ill   Came close ditching restaurant when conscience nagged pack snack later   Really hate wasting food     Later night finish rest food hotel could help but recall experience enjoying sandwich even while freshly made   destined trash point   Far expensive sandwich $16 when superb ones range $13 16    major flop books  <EOR> So really long night partying  my group craving some delicious sandwiches  After seeing giant sandwich ads everywhere hotel Treasure Island gave into peer pressure headed over Canter's   If want right Viva Las Vegas  pastrami cole slaw corned beef cheese  amazing does sound? The sandwich huge  also expensive almost $17   I noticed most gourmet deli places Canters Langers   etc bump meat prices crazy  The french fries weren't great  but pastrami delicious  The only reason place doesn't 5 stars because literally every sandwich above $10   Thank goodness LA cause know craving sandwiches verrrrrry soon! <EOR> I love eating L A  Canters near home  usually end dropping $20 cookies am walking well bakery free environment much better wallet   Their sandwiches piled high but still bite able service always kinda friendly kinda not  Except location where servers doing weird thing mouths     smiling think called ?       They good burgers damn good grilled cheese but pastrami other deli sammies rock  location usual Pastrami Combo #1 which bath Thousand Island extra pickles  hit spot ways never before      perhaps because 2 30am intoxicated thanks lemon drop martinis  <EOR> Canter's best tasting pastrami sandwich ever had!! Grill toasted bread lots hot pastrami melting swiss cheese sauracrout  good came back next day another one   I wish fries bigger because more string style  <EOR> We staying TI decided eat before flying out  each sandwich which thought bit high priced $15 but  those things packed meat!  Totally worth could split sandwich but  just took plane us  thing would recommend subbing onion rings fries come your meal  fries Amazing if order onion rings 5 pay $2 more   Overall delish food great hangovers pricey strip  <EOR> my must stop every time vegas i always pastrami sandwich sliced extra thin the pastrami nicely steamed when sliced thin just melts your mouth sosoo goood  <EOR> $10+ sandwiches normally business strategy especially slumping economy but Vegas away lot stuff  sandwiches normal sized corned beef very tasty freshly cut  put coleslaw sandwich itself which kind special there's side potato salad thats mixed coleslaw which also kind special  Just glad didn't mix coleslaw into soda also      Bottom line little pricey but good sandwiches  Perfect alternative if don't want  glutton pig buffet which tend do  <EOR> The bacon cheeseburger surprisingly delicious  $10 fries pretty fuckin good Sin City  <EOR> Portions huge    probably shouldn't gotten 2 things  Oh well don't call fat no reason!
