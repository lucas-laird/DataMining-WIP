We great eating experience new kbbq place but paid using credit card tipping cash which left table next check book cashier girl wearing red shirt front counter gets bill check chased check book walked door asking if left any tip  seriously asking that?  Problem #1 never ask customers  question offensive insulting customer especially if did leave tip   Problem #2 DID leave tip cash next check book which why no tip value credit card receipt   Problem #3 CHECK table first! everyone tips credit card receipt prefers tipping cash   Problem #4 Tipping general required  just courtesy customers choice if want tip not    The only problem restaurant girl working front cashier wearing red shirt very unprofessional  Filipino guy server other Asian guy girl servers wearing black awesome do  served well  Sucks cashier girl ruin them  told story other people know shocked hear asked question if tipped not  never happened until now never happened anyone know  ruined whole dinner experience new restaurant because pissed all off  <EOR> Wow!

Would she take neighboring table's unfinished kimchi give instead giving new dish?  After still decided tip but honestly didn't feel being generous  group 6 included gratuity which common most restaurants when serving bigger group  However defaulted 20% gratuity without even asking us  if wanted base 18% instead? point just paid left    The place very much outclassed other KBBQ places town  Hwaro Gen top two places all eat  5 5 them  Goong favorite KBBQ but isn't AYCE  relatively pricey but meat absolutely phenomenal  Great place date any special occasion  6 5  Arirang?
