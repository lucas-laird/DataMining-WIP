Sigh   I'll start PROS  said pizzas stellar  say all Neapolitan pizzas offered Las Vegas Valley place serves second favorite crust topping  My fave far? DOCG  close third place? Settebello  Super Bowl party earlier year lamb chop lollipops INCREDIBLE  Perhaps best lamb chops country  The best lamb ever had? Karoo Lamb only available South Africa  Now CONS IE problems yesterday  octopus dish grilled served salad  critter overcooked tough flavorful would liked it  didn't say anything probably should have  Also all salads little overdressed but say content dressings always spot on  Next M thought rather weird would serve cheese bread wonderful mozzarella+item platters  did but didn't ruin me  lastly WHY wines the glass prices high? understand wine list truly astounding they currently GEORGE Pinot Noir glass  fantastic stuff rare find WBTG list but drinking always exorbitant ALWAYS wince upon arrival bill  FOOTNOTE TASTE any wine 20% glass price try 2 sips GEORGE yesterday  YAY! So would say HERE  PIZZA  think tried every pizza ALL fantastic  lamb chops if menu  Bring extra cash drinks  enjoy  <EOR> This place keeps getting better better love coming here   now tried every restaurant downtown Summerlin but nothing compares   Especially latest menu chef Carlos   amazing there's way more just pizza wine  pastas awesome always great specials   highly recommend place <EOR> This place really gone downhill since opened   My first few visits excited pizza place caliber side town  worried never very busy am surprised lasted long  Even though everyone talks great never seems anyone there   We busy life stopped going awhile  When returned happy ever pizzas but also branzino which normally love but thought just OK   With current pizza invasion hadn't Due Forni nearly year  nearby Settebello better even considering Custom Built Pizza but wasn't mood fast food setting  Since Groupon decided save give Due Forni another chance  Normally don't buy Groupons places before but having hard time justifying price when other spots nearby better  visit mistake   First host think owner manager seemed annoyed wanted sit inside  Whatever he seated us  waiter very strange confusing attitude  ordered root beer he didn't bother tell bottled  wasn't huge issue but every restaurant ever only offers bottled root beer made sure inform before serving   Next ordered Roman margherita Neapolitan tacchino pizza  He upsold salad but hoping he would anyway no problem  taking order he returned promptly said Roman margherita Neapolitan tacchino right? confirmed this   Soon he breaking egg husband's pizza  Tacchino pizza no egg re read menu saw he served tartufo tacchino  told husband he asked waiter then whispered ear Sir heard tartufo  husband said he ordered tacchino waiter told just eat if he doesn't he'll replace it  WTF?  First all know he didn't hear tartufo because he came back repeated tacchino  he forgot between table kitchen kitchen messed he didn't want deal it  Second tell customer just eat gave them? two pizzas nothing common! Plus pizza $4 more now he charging more something didn't want  husband's pushover likes both kinds pizza he just along it  didn't argue because medication could lash anyone gives wrong response   My margherita pizza disappointing well  tasted made Saltine  While always describe Roman pizza crust being cracker like never actually taste cracker   Unhappy food service doubt returning here  find outrageous waiter would tell someone just eat mistake without offering replace correct order addition charging higher price  used all people come Due Forni but goofball along higher prices lower quality food put end that  <EOR> We tried Due Forni tonight whim found Yelp  thought we'd try something new maybe experiment  Unfortunately should asked more questions server prior ordering  husband love prosciutto mozzarella bar appetizer  loved mozzarella bread same dish    just downhill    I ordered mushroom ravioli when came looked someone poured brown gravy all over perfectly good raviolis  tried just overpowering mushroom puree  mean really tried it  wasn't going say anything but server Juan sincere tried best help called right away  don't you  he said rather asked me  He immediately offered another pasta dish  told Hey maybe should asked more questions  thought ordering basic ravioli marinara sauce  fault asking said  He looked confused  said feel really American right now expecting kind basic Italian dish  even apologized liking because  crazy am   So Juan offered try gnocci cream sauce normally comes bacon  don't eat pork left bacon off it  looked good when he brought husband packing partially eaten Speck Pizza  husband loved pizza way  Unfortunately gnocchi plain just hit  felt bad say anything Juan because could see he sincerely trying right  He looked he took personally didn't pastas  even far let pack remainder dish knowing wasn't going eat it   The atmosphere Due seemed fun kind chi chi  lots yuppie types sipping wine cocktails  husband just wanted romantic hearty Italian dinner no frills  just didn't seem work tonight   But hey win some lose some  never know if you'll discover nice little neighborhood gem unless experiment  said husband loved prosciutto pizza even more prosciutto it  I'd stay away pastas thought   Feeling disappointed  <EOR> Due Forni may Italian disappointing   pizza very good interesting combinations but despise being rushed through meal   friends heard great things wanted try chocolate pizza   thought would enjoy glass spendy wine appetizer but instead waitress brought lukewarm pizza appetizer   When said something she explained small she thought would want them together  don't know means either   Then tried enjoy chocolate pizza come she whisked away plates silverware even though clearly still eating   food worth bums rush  None back many other good places town allow enjoy your meal   If want rush MickyDs  <EOR> Bread pudding off hook! best ever had  new favorite restaurant  Gotta gnocchi!

He brought three pizzas instead two because he paying attention anything said   let slide tasted all three   four cheese dealy thick thin crust Margherita pizza  both styles pizza   thin crust ok   say C minus   thick crust tasteless   crust no taste no yeast sauce some kind undrained tomato made New York Style pizza watery soggy   Imported tomatoes great but drain liquid off them   would miles ahead using California tomato products which actually some flavor   Waiter asked thought pizza told wasn't good he ignored comments   place knows nothing making real New York style pizza   can't believe good reviews   crust needs some longer working times develop some flavor   great good ovens but some ingredients some flavor  <EOR> I've owned significant pizzerias SF Bay Area dined least 5 6 times last few years  say because know restaurant business hardship low review takes ownership rarely write negative reviews  But wow   meal last night bad  Let's start pizza    All say stay away Roman pizza  thin kind but very very chewy  exactly attribute would praise wish your pizza  top chefs heaped mountain cheese    terrible  pizza look closer something coming Chuck E  Cheese then upscale eatery  chefs quite literally don't know they're doing when comes pizza  discovered main problems when leaving  keep ovens floor temperatures 150 200°  means hot enough cook pizzas properly  cold  dough sit ovens long time hence drying out  legitimate pizza oven floor between 400 800 degrees depending upon style  kept 650 Roman Neapolitan styles  Secondly pizza less more  advise skilled guys kitchen know Pizza dedicate ovens doing right  Everything else meah  Last time me  <EOR> My unfiltered dame stopped afternoon late lunch early dinner  restaurant pretty empty service rapid  enjoyed casual atmosphere dear although admit place pretty far side town    We ordered Antipasti baked Calamari surprisingly delicious  would consider ordering again  $12  Pizze Spinaci pizza pretty soggy waitress neglected share info prior recommendation  slice could barely finish it  Overall okay  $18  Secondi Gnocchi far best dish  enjoyed basil pesto flavor  Highly recommended $13  Dolce Affogato $7 Gelato pretty friggin amazing!   Overall probably wouldn't return unless area but worth try! <EOR> I now dined least 8 times always group girlfriends very middle road experience every time   First off staff excellent knowledgeable wine food   opinion dining specialty pizza should set sharing having tastes many items   Unfortunately find menu lacking small plate appetizer options accompany pizza group dining unless want heavy cheeses meats side pizza doesn't flow       Additionally think Kitchen made rookie mistake San Marzano Tomatoes   Imported Italian Tomatoes intended purpose Chef slice open each tomato extracting seeds then crush puree hand squeeze base sauce  personal irritations misuse product   tomatoes canned product meaning processed ready use base making sauce one's choice herbs spices   intention serve place fresh tomato   making pizza sauce but instead serving them raw unseasoned straight pizza     What shame when much potential great pizza sauce really name themselves niche business upscale pizza especially since mastered awesome pizza crust something virtually unheard Vegas   would give 5 stars both crust styles serve  <EOR> Yum! Due Forni right street didn't even know missing whole time    Started Smoked Pork Belly  little odd because seemed pork belly big piece fat  few different pork belly appetizer dishes various restaurants cuisines but none seemed fatty  smokey name states which usually really keen smokey meats but worked  served wooden plank greens blueberry  Odd combo but didn't hate it   We also ordered Due Forni pizza Daily Lasagna  Due Forni pizza good but some really odd flavor couldn't wasn't crazy it  However Daily Lasagna top notch  bechamel sauce sausage inside CHEEEESSSEE  Wow lasagna killed everything else allowed visit memorable  Good job Due Forni yummy lasagna  wonder though if says 'Daily Lasagna' does mean different nightly? if next time eat order lasagna comes delicious?

<EOR> Like all new places try and love trying new places often love try they're known for    We came Friday night later place kind emptied out    For menu seem semi nice casual dining  seating casual   They good wine selection but food selection tad smaller    So tried The Lasagna special  odd one  braised short rib squash zucchini  didn't sound good all but waiter insisted  Honestly really good  both pleasantly surprised   I Tartufo pizza  Because truffle  love truffle  smell taste  hits spot  Whatever means  It delicious  even hesitant egg but if are  DO BE! quite topper delectable dish    The waiter super friendly very knowledgeable  Maybe little knowledgable  way he into crazy detail food  But he super passionate job  Which great thing    Overall would love try again other dishes  just little further us  But when good food booze worth going little your way  <EOR> I'd say place 4 star pizza   3 stars review because pizza bit overcooked    I Neapolitan Margherita    It similar Settebello fact tries imitate authentic Italian style wood oven but  where similarity ends As gave Settebello 5 stars    The sauce good flavor don't real strong acidic pizza sauce delicate flavor    Cheese consisted basic gobs mozzarella    The dough bit over baked could taste burnt bread flavor every bite coming bottom due being left oven 30 seconds long   Waitstaff friendly    I came year ago Tartufo pizza remember being good   I should written review back then  <EOR> Restaurant Week special!
