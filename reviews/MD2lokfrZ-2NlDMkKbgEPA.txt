I chose lone leftover slice spinach mushrooms  Gotta those veggies in   thicker East Coast pizza but thick having only bread   Overall wasn't bad but wasn't over top flavor I'd rate simply okay   cost 5 bucks toppings but pretty big slice  Maybe pricey average pizza place standards but slice enough quick meal probably among cheapest meals food court   Jeez even ice cream cone $5! <EOR>
