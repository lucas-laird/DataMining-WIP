Everything delicious  mean everything! staff well attended all aspects  two stick above rest evening  Laurence Bianca served us  Both delightful  travel all over world never service did two  Both amazing personalities knowledgeable made experience want tell someone about  Making Rivea great place dine entertained valued VIP without being one  views restaurant just mesmerizing  dining experience don't want miss! <EOR> Unfortunately experience restaurant called Mix which preceded Rivea same location drawn down rating four stars because let know place instead currently   Quick version unquestionably five star food service but decor ambience pull down four overall   prefix admitting some bias because rented prior restaurant wedding reception years ago return every year but think points still going valid while nearly perfect before quite level now   Mix very classy openness thanks incredible view everything being white off white including seating tables floor none distracted food view   service staff wore suits did many patrons but even sans jacket patrons would dress appropriately caliber restaurant still is   balcony dining no different inside other fact nothing separated air view beyond glass plate railings   Here's Rivea experience first time back since remodel rename   dark   walls white perhaps gray similar hard tell exactly since sunset   Instead just free standing tables they've sectioned off dark brown booth dividers everywhere   suppose may feel more intimate some but felt just made layout busier color darkened things even more   Table lighting now via large dark brown hanging lamps intruding further space two story open dining room   Outside dining its own theme now seating colorful metal deck chairs cushions   Deck chairs $120+ pp meals seems odd   Service impeccable every time visited   never wait longer few minutes if need something choose flag someone down typically only need something addition because mistakes almost non existent both service food prep   new staff 'uniform' peculiar   some kind French Mediterranean theme where staff wear dark blue jeans suspenders sneakers Converse seemed popular perhaps if you're primary server also vest some sort maybe bow tie   Honestly don't care much just doesn't seem fits all well given every other aspect restaurant   There's gentleman named Renee server assistants most attentive pleasant restaurant staff encountered he's over six years based first time encountered above beyond every single time   As far patrons sure if ever dress code years past but never saw anyone wasn't least pants shirt before   Currently perhaps testament today's society actually dress code relaxed remodel rename anymore   time around few patrons cargo shorts t shirts along guy very short shorts think slightly longer 1980's NBA uniform    When you're having high caliber meal just don't really expect see some dude's pasty white thighs leg hair walking past you   Finally food   While miss many items Mix menu options still plentiful still excellent   particularly fond peppercorn bison wife's filet prepared perfectly   lobster risotto melt your mouth   Appetizers include bread sticks olive derived spread put them similar texture hummus   Bread butter also served   roasted panisse which basically flash fried chickpea fries great texture inside just enough crunch outside   REALLY miss lobster curry Mix but off menu now   no complaints perfectly prepared food its price which seemed perfectly inline received   Last but least Rivea added something very nice Mix didn't have private dining meeting space   unfinished space north end building now pair private rooms dining and or gathering same floor ceiling windows giving both mountain strip host event smaller proportion full restaurant buy out   Take perfect place married and or host reception being able probably going significantly less expensive full buy means now available many more   I really love Rivea its food its staff but miss end end five star experience Mix had  <EOR> This pretty well great experience all around  service absolutely amazing enough visits nobody ever empty water beverage but insistent became hassle  menu nice mix traditional classics but also some interesting more modern dishes well  basically segmented small plates section entrees section    We came business meal clients ordered bunch small plates including buffalo mozzarella tomato basil salad gnocchi mushroom risotto  Each absolutely fantastic  Most table ordered Bison Tenderloin which heavily peppered as advertised cooled perfection  Bison times bit dry due low fat content but case all here  Finally ordered several desserts share table each excellent though nothing over top spectacular   Finally being situated top Delano tower Mandalay Bay resort view absolutely spectacular could any shortcomings which very few  fact if pressed come negative would only ambient noise level rather loud  <EOR> The food great service  attentive filled glass when only half empty without ever being asked  bison steak really nice  All deserts ordered excellent  seated window experience great view  <EOR> This restaurant probably seen much better days negative experience probably unique given dining room more half empty Saturday night   First server wouldn't even let customers ask if specific order possibility cutting everyone off multiple occasions   point someone tell let them finish speaking   In addition extra items brought 5 sides ordered more delivered table charged for    Food prep wrong steaks cooked requested extra sauces put food when desired   specific case desserts more 5 minutes later everyone else's   I would come back despite nice atmosphere  <EOR> Amazing food service interior space view  Wow wow wow  level service knowledge waiter bar none  group 4 tried lot items  big shock amazing chickpea fry is  lobster subtle but flavorful broth extremely good duck cinnamon sauce really stood out  thought cinnamon would much but wow wrong  Thank perfect Vegas dinner experience being worth every penny  <EOR> My Favorite Steak house town! love food view everything great Very nice experience every time  Thank Bianca Dee she's Great Great host   Love view staff all friendly  I recommend if visiting live Las Vegas Visit Rivea order Bison Steak Rossini   coming since miX restaurant   <EOR> As budget minded Vegas local only really Strip restaurants during Restaurant week   Alain Ducasse world famous Michelin star chef high expectations maybe unwarranted   starters hit miss   panisse chickpea fries delicate crispy crust soft inside very delicious comforting   provencal caponata average wasn't easy eat   marinated sea bass grilled octopus bean salad both winners   husband said octopus best he ever since lightly cooked without any hint chewiness   sea bass starter lightly flavored ceviche very refreshing    My duck dish perfectly cooked except super salty duck shreds side overly sweet sauce   husbands halibut dish average felt fish could more moist    The tiramisu dessert excellent but husband's vacherin dessert a sorbet meringue dessert tart   Maybe fruit wasn't ripe enough   Overall expected sublime dishes revered chef reality real hit miss   service staff very attentive though  <EOR> Wonderful experience!  Food excellent wonderful wine selection  Views top notch 64th floor Delano hotel  sure reservation   Staff very knowledgeable service quick attentive  recommend checking out! <EOR> Generally unimpressed  really hoping exciting dining experience  food fell flat  mother ordered tasting menu wasn't even able eat duck because tough  timing delivery courses really off  am difficult please approach most dining experiences desire satisfied grateful  did happen here  <EOR> First off should zero star  Delano hotel initially awesome  When checked into hotel restaurant recommended 64 floor  When wife right check front hostess said fine bar area because casual wear  spending money drinks restroom approached same front hostess ask restroom she said would need take off hat wife would need take beanie off if wanted use restroom  Mind 30 degrees already spending money hotel restaurant  staff snotty pretentious discriminates wear  spoke bar manager nice but defended restaurant's dress code which didn't know about  Bottom line dress your food cocktail service kindness hospitality  really sad witness kind discrimination when bringing money establishment wasn't busy people  see why  worth going here  overrated  <EOR> The food delicious views Las Vegas gorgeous!  server very personable lot fun talk to  far favorite restaurant Vegas  <EOR> What great experience!

sea beam citrus supremes well executed   Think ceviche minus heavy acid  flesh slightly firm gentle flavor sea robed citrus gel brightens palate each bite   Large plates include outstanding breast duck   Pan roasted perfectly rare all fat rendered deep flavor pronounced mineral flavor very essence duck   Served classic sauce Bigarade classic French sweet sour sauce bitter orange truly elevates characteristic flavor duck  dish perfectly balanced   shown John Dory   fish perfectly cooked   Firm but moist   complex sauce brings richness dish     Service relaxed friendly but proper   Exceptional wine list over 1 400 selections   something everyone every price point   Some vintage depth   High Vegas resort prices   Tip sure visit restaurant's lounge Skyfall nightcap even more stunning views Vegas Strip   Great promise  <EOR> Great food service  However restaurant needs improve guest behavior admission procedures  watched 3 tables relocated due loud obnoxious profane
