reservation incredible views Bellagio fountains which ran every 15 20 minutes  Prices pretty expensive but food ambiance high quality perfect romantic date night while vacationing Vegas  <EOR> i'm really fancy restaurant type but special occasion celebrate some nice clothes luggage   in short expensive but worth it   food service top notch views lv spectacular   creme brule unbelievable but share single portion your date might into coma   this great place date   despite tightly spaced tables clever use spot lighting made table seem very private cozy   plus expensive menu keeps white trash <EOR> The Eiffel Tower Restaurant sits 11th floor Paris' Eiffel Tower replica Las Vegas provides decor atmosphere dining experience fitting its name which may enjoy find cheesy depending your likes dislikes    A private glass elevator takes guests restaurant kind interesting view floors activity way way back down    elevators opens kitchen where chefs plate food   The restaurant utilizes old fashioned dining room  plush red seating white tablecloth  but stodginess cut dramatically view utilization Eiffel Tower's metal legs within restaurant   The tables strategically placed many tables great view Strip primary attraction being Bellagio Fountains    Lots big floor to ceiling windows create great view   metal framework cuts into restaurant gives kind art deco feel   art deco feel old fashioned decor really place feel restaurant another era   They started off cream soup amuse bouche okay but great   complimentary bread also okay but memorable   We some appetizers   lobster Pain Perdu kind lobster bread souffle   okay though great   also some sea scallops served wine sauce onions   scallops dish also just okay   scallops tender seasoned right   much better though terms scallops both outside sear moistness well accompanying sauces sides   We also little bit cold seafood platter which included lobster shrimp crab oysters clams   favorite type starter I would rather hot seafood where chefs little more creative garnish sauce cook seafood    Everything okay but nothing really stood here   I venison chop entree   venison chop nice red color but juicy   meat tender enough decent though spectacular flavor   huckleberry reduction sounded good but did really much not particularly prominent flavor plate    The main side venison chop oatmeal cake   second time oatmeal dinner the other time Bistro LQ    would favorite side  not bad definitely tastes oatmeal    plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms pretty good   nice crunch them   I also tried la carte slides  classic potato gratin   kind lukewarm   potatoes tender but little bland and lacked creamy cheesy flavor    While almost all food average dessert real winner   chocolate souffle probably best chocolate souffles had   great chocolate flavor they served chocolate ganache which also good    separated chocolate souffle texture   Very nicely baked   Great texture great lift   Chocolate souffles hard right   typically dry spongy liquidy   though pretty close perfect   I also some vanilla ice cream which creamy but pretty standard stuff   Service good terms getting food good pace even though restaurant incredibly busy which also caused restaurant quite warm loud    felt though waiter good some other waiters recently   He did good enough job but felt he little stuffy   think he could little more personable relaxed   Las Vegas restaurants typically overpriced Eiffel Tower Restaurant pretty good example that   food would same price range some most expensive best restaurants L A   Even when comparing Eiffel Tower Restaurant other pricey Vegas restaurants Eiffel Tower Restaurant still feels very overpriced   prices similar Mesa Grill but flavors Mesa Grill much better Mesa Grill uses better ingredients    Eiffel Tower Restaurant great souffle would come back that   food however overpriced average despite having backing prominent chef Jean Joho also operates Michelin starred Everest Chicago    Even though am big fan Las Vegas restaurants think could much better Strip Eiffel Tower Restaurant   I walked but imagine complimentary valet parking self parking other big Vegas casinos  <EOR> Food good wasn't sure mushroom foam gave date before ate but good  Very elegant view fountains always favorite feel  romantic non cheesy way  <EOR> Visited Bastille Day   Surprisingly

First! take private elevator restaurant   pretty fun just itself  When entering views breathtaking!   We sat great spot enjoy fountain show! Best view! However small half circle table just behind service bar wasn't very inviting  felt quite cramped    The gentleman served bread water lovely man always smile! loved he paused when offering selection bread sure didn't want try other offerings    did!!! Being polite initially asked but because nice smile kind disposition he knew wanted try all 3!! yummy   However Eiffel Tower prices cold bread ice cold butter just acceptable! enticing all  I still ate all bread We ordered scallops appetizer  did disappoint!!! Absolutely delicious!!! Yum yum!   For dinner filet  ordered medium rare  However because such large cut edges completely well done  $70 can't say very happy  Still happy  many filet mignon might advise try unless your meat well cooked  Perhaps butterfly cut might help if your heart set though    For dessert chocolate soufflé  mind blowing  But yummy  8 flavors choose from!!! don't chocolate branch try something fun! Passion fruit would fun!   And maybe New School but feel lady restroom wants tip handing towel tacky  fan  takes purse restroom? then feel guilty washing hands!!! Those days Breakfast Tiffany's   For 3 items glass house wine total $140!!   I'd definitely return sit lovely bar enjoy beautiful ambiance views! drink maybe scallops? But price pay food just doesn't match Wow factor when saw bill!!! <EOR> I came fiancé birthday  reservation requires credit card charge $50 if don't show  actually think  great way hold people accountable reservations  Anyways although able window table still great view strip Bellagio fountains    Our waitress kind attentive  food amazing  salmon he cod  sides technically individual but enough split  creamed spinach mushrooms mashed potatoes which good    I would recommend place romantic dinner  <EOR> Choose restaurant Bellagio fountain view night   Visited week Thanksgiving November 2011   Found could guaranteed night time view fountain if reservations made 5 pm 5 15 pm maximum two people   disappointed saw 3 fountain shows every 1 2 hour    We friendly waiter thus 4 stars slight problem luke warm soup but management quickly stepped rectify satisfaction soup   Would given 5 stars but waiter stiff unfriendly tad edgy      Food pretty good dessert DELICIOUS! <EOR> Our hopes high going into experience maybe downfall  friends tried tasting menu couple years back still talk day best ever had  when all decided take trip Vegas immediately made reservation four us   The elevator ride pretty fun although extremely turned off elevator doors restaurant level which covered much dust almost looks intentional  likely no else would notice maybe 5 seconds view before doors open close but put off    We seated right away 8pm reservation server lovely  She made great drink recommendations very pleased Daisy which she proclaimed favorite drink  Pleasantly sweet just right amount spicy  service great overall doesn't love being offered bread every time your bread plate empty?

Service friendly well but some reason could tell waiter bit annoyed us    boyfriend nice possible despite negative vibe getting   end meal think he felt guilty mood changed drastically     It just 2 view right front Bellagio fountain show   watch least 4 water shows   absolutely loved it!!  meals mediocre nothing rave although good but hands down souffle!!  chocolate goodness    certainly devoured it     Definitely recommended    only giving 4 stars 5 because food slightly because service waiter   fan because dessert view! <EOR> Ok hands down absolutely best restaurant ever life  highly recommend chicken cheapest entre menu trust disappointed  personally am addicted Beef Wellington but please   and stress Pistachio soufflé it's must   service best ever seen your glass water never empty  no lie! really treat royalty view Bellaggio Water Show tops off  <EOR> We New Years Day brunch! event notification facebook crepes Eiffel Tower Restaurant New Years Day Brunch! sounded really good!

Service could better  server appeared distant seemed never smile   woman helped clear table periodically very nice sweet however    Go least once try yourself  brunch cheaper price but same view  views still great during daylight hours   Call advance reservations  If request seat window best views  think may visit again when town   Next time dinner evening view! <EOR> Random info Tasting Menu $125 Wine paring optional additional $79  Average individual entree ranges between $50 $80  elevator restaurant located middle Paris casino    Ambiance Excellent  terms view Bellagio fountain probably best place dine! Be sure ask good table if come view   Food Good  first time came girlfriend lamp chop steak  thought those dishes quite average  second time came clients chief's tasting menu which thought definitely better tasting menu come across  Foie Gras which duck liver amazing!   Parking Good  Free parking if don't mind walking  other hand valet only $3 5 bucks depends much want tip  always valet when Vegas freaking convenient!   Service Excellent  First all people greet right elevator escort restaurant  If having tasting menu your utensils swapped clean ones every course  oh beware restroom attendants sure bring some cash tips  Water always filled time sometimes VP manager walk around personally sure everything ok    Conclusion Hands down best view Vegas! Good food  Over top service  good place impress date client  Dinner two expect bill $200 if order off menu  $280 $450 if getting tasting menu  <EOR> We don't hype   Really   some experience fine dining did blow water   Maybe expectations high because recommended   Maybe we're getting snobby   knows?!  Yeah service good food good view nice but $400 2 tip   expect very least   But end positive note highlight foie gras filet mignon hubby loved chocolate souffle  <EOR> What incredible restaurant!  absolutely loved meal especially dessert    incredible view excellent food!  see fountains   love going here! <EOR> This star service  Last night dinner server horrible! When sat table took 10 mins greeted anyone keep mind server   Once server showed he did introduced himself asked if ready drinks  ahead asked name without any apology he immediately turned around walked away  Skipping taking order food great  Then he proceeded ask if ready dessert since all full declined  He then audacity comment under breath  asked he said then he said never mind  never come back ever again  <EOR> I seriously wanted avoid coming really should've reading some not so consistent reviews   But celebrating both parent's birthdays insistent eating Eiffel Tower  oh well gotta parents happy Ok well let's started   off elevator you're immediately presented kitchen which actually kind cool   nice lady walks hostess far feeling hopeful   seated immediately decent booth but really can't see much view   did specially request nice view but didnt work well   atmosphere just ok kind loud side   We started off Roasted Foie Gras White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops Warm Lobster Salad appetizers   foie gras good but much better accompanying marinated grapes weren't best match   really need something sweeter rich flavor foie gras   scallops cooked perfectly lobster salad probably favorite   point you're probably wondering why 2 stars?  Well read friend     For entrees ordered Filet Seabass Venison Chop Surf Turf Beef Tenderloin Bone in Ribeye   seabass cooked just right but seasoning non existent   Venison cooked perfectly well pretty pleased dish   Surf Turf Beef Tenderloin quite disappointment   crab meat dried crab cake although tenderloin cooked perfectly no flavor all   didn't even nice char which definitely good steak   ribeye probably best entree them all   Nice juicy actually seasoned well too   also side order scalloped potatoes which total waste money   point food just OK if look prices really worth all   But guess Vegas almost all high end restaurants least $40 per entree easy    Am just spoiled quality service San Francisco restaurants?  haven't yet mentioned anything service yet but just ok point   Nothing Dining Room Ritz SF server seemed way busy another table he really didn't come check all   rest staff fairly attentive but would expect way better service restaurant this    Ah yes dessert   absolute favorite course any meal   hoping opinion restaurant change dessert   course everyone else did suckered into ordering souffle beginning meal already its way   wait wait still no dessert menu   Someone finally brings new place settings but still no dessert menu   dessert menu?  can't even find server because he obviously way many tables   Someone finally brings souffle point asked dessert menus   He says he'll bring them right away    yeah right   souffle delicious must say kind enough bring complimentary desserts wish parents happy birthday   But dessert menu??! ! some point just gave because annoyed   Now know why give Eiffel Tower Restaurant only 2 stars   By end meal am annoyed huge bill pay less satisfactory fine dining experience   really wishing just made reservations Picasso Bellagio Guy Savoy instead   could've even just gone back Delmonico's Michael Mina Bouchon Fleur de Lys all where way better experiences this     In conclusion    Food=3 stars Ambiance=3 stars Service = 1 star pretty much non existant Dessert=1 star for ever bringing dessert menu Which averages 2 stars  <EOR> Nice located great service food ok nothing special special soufflé second time <EOR> Amazing food service scenery  More romantic side music but truest beautiful place  <EOR> Great dinner experience!

Can't wait post pictures fabulous review    of anniversary evening Eiffel Tower ! <EOR> I heard place going best places romantic dinner Vegas  having dinner want back again! service terrible! Maybe only but many things wrong  blame most horrible experience waiter oldest man there!   He asked beginning if wanted chocolate souffle told would take 30 min 1 hr he recommended order beginning  did  waited long time main entrees salmon filet mignon but didn't mind since boyfriend watching Bellagio water show almost every 15 min there  also ordered some scallops pretty good appetizer  any rate couple behind arrived 15 min but served before us  found later stopped eat food received wrong order  ours since overheard them mentioning sides  just happened ordered same main entrees us  waiter brought back kitchen later brought I know reheated kitchen gave us! know because dish overcooked side plate! Horrible!   Not only did main entrees wrong but dessert didn't come until hour main entree finished! waiter kept telling would coming blamed oven broken when reality    he FORGOT ORDERED IT!     There nothing really special dishes  definitely would back again especially if waiter there! know restaurant long waiting list but worth wait end  <EOR> Go every year when am Vegas annual sales meeting   best views Vegas strip find   Disappointed took fries off menu favorite side dish over years   always great view past but time stuck worst table restaurant overlooking pool Paris   should questioned hostess asked wait another one   While service very friendly did order appetizers dessert took long time waiter wine going did check until 10 30 we 7 30 reservation    still love place but little disappointed compared previous visits   going back next year  <EOR> Service A+ View A+ Food A  I very impressed Eiffel Tower Restaurant experience enjoyed last night  From moment enter elevator middle faux Eiffel Tower treated princes princesses   staff very friendly helpful waitress fantastic  She very knowledgeable menu honest recommendations did best meet some more food restrictive diners  Our table excellent view Bellagio Fountains which made every 15 minutes treat   We started fennel parfait compliments chef   appetizer shared seafood treasure chest lobster crab leg oysters shrimp seafood salad   appetizer single order seafood appetizer enough two share   For dinner enjoyed beef wellington light flaky earthy mushroom flavor beautifully cooked cut butter melted your mouth   We also tried Rabbit which surprisingly tasty flaky but moist  The crab salad also well presented   The restaurant able accomodate special requests picky eater company several allergies   When couldn't quick inform reason other options   I say very disappointed kids menu   Although reasonably priced crayons kids coloring menu options pasta butter marinara grilled cheese chicken   mean beautiful top food restaurant can't more creative your kids menu?  many restaurants sell kids tastes short but would gladly paid extra couple dollars able add shrimp chicken pasta fish option   Other kids menu fantastic dining experience  NOTE those places where pay more location view prices high   also those places where worth price   NOTE 2 Although family would very romantic date spot  <EOR> A girlfriend came lunch Saturday take advantage prix fixe menu offered support Las Vegas Restaurant Week    I loved seating reservations coordinator downstairs  She checked name computer confirmed restaurant upstairs building led into elevator  once very posh attentive but cool casual welcoming  Definitely good start   The elevator opens kitchen  great touch love see kitchen sense going food! Walk right enter into bar area see hostess desk  also see really isn't bad seat place  tiered offer much possible view every diner  Great idea  decor upscale comfortable simple elegant without putting off casual diner   We seated intimate two person table window facing Bellagio fountains  C'est parfait! Tres jolie! loved show against somewhat dreary day Las Vegas lights lit water made view and proxy ambiance restaurant much more beautiful   Service spectacular  Everything timed perfectly amuse apps entrees desserts  Wine service expedient attentive  Everything explained well if little rehearsed heard same spiel over over almost verbatim tables around us  Hint change bit add some personality personability it! Still friendly capable humorous when appropriate everyone game   Mmmmm food  *is* restaurant all   Drinks opted wine glass but did some yum sounding signature cocktails    $18 piece  Just worth me    three glasses wine your cocktail happier it  Others around loving drinks see value occasion but something skipped    time   Amuse light but flavor FULL mushroom flan small piece mushroom top  Savory goodness less bite best fungi preparations pleasure eating long time   Apps foie gras not LVRW menu but ordered extra absolutely phenomenal  Served cold large thick slice straight off liver  Nothing formed cubed otherwise manipulated marbled veins perfect  if  amazing enough wrapped duck prosciutto  Yeah drool worthy   The spinach grueyere streudel good  hoped more cheese found crust bit hard  said flavors solid spinach fresh  bad dish   Entree flank steak great flavor cabernet jus delicious  But something cut    almost against grain? Sadly also little tough  ordered them medium rare I even added more rare side closer think medium  Great flavors but little lost execution   Dessert peach tartin fantastic  pastry light crisp peaches fresh sweet tender basil ice cream piece crispy basil lovely sweet savory complement rest dish  Really really done well   I never felt rushed meal very good prices good  Aside prix fixe decision made foie gras only $20 and compared other places lately  amazing deal offer  Definitely fave!   2 glasses wine each all above only $65 each before tip  Very much worth visit!  For next time    see wine foie gras dessert bar  Casual yet still surrounded intimate elegance    fabulous view  <EOR> Bonjour!
