Oh    and prices great well!! <EOR> Decided check new place lunch few days ago  wife works Howard Hughes Center which right next Bandito's place much anticipated people work area   It lived hype opinion sure!   I burrito  shrimp chicken beans rice salsa guacamole  shrimp huge inside  probably weren't many them maybe 3 jumbo but gave great crunch nice added flavor opinion    The guacamole side creamy  generally prefer little chunky guac but still very tasty grape tomato halves it    On top salsa rojo which supposed little kick but did much opinion  generally spicy but lacked kick carried flavor    The service great  realize where new places often struggle service  case Bandito's  server great other staff regularly filled water  manager came over ask doing then even removed some finished plates table    The place very nicely decorated  beautiful mural wall! Some nice soft music great ambience    The burritos $18 piece which little bit high side lunch outing but nicer place  more accepted guess    Give shot certainly back! <EOR> came into today check place 3 other friends lunch  upon entry place very new trendy very beautiful look  owner happened seated he very welcoming kind even checked everything during end meal  chips red salsa green salsa also tried habanero Salsa which all amazing! when check Yelp also complimentary chips guacamole which thought nice touch   carne asada tacos sorry didn't take picture but there's plenty yelp page lol which came rice beans 3rd side choice which Mexican street corn which pretty good well! give carne asada tacos 3 5 5  servers name Diane she awesome very patient great attitude also very personable  would definitely eat again! they've only open 4 months going nice addition area  wish them best luck! <EOR> We love happy hour great service fantastic bartenders Bandito  watermelon margarita missed  Paired chips w guacamole fresh salsas can't wrong  <EOR> Greet new restaurant opening Las Vegas    enchilada superb    Service great your meal isn't complete until your try margaritas <EOR> This restaurant fun artsy atmosphere  food good portions adequate  loved use fresh ingredients farm table dishes include freshly squeezed lemonade! <EOR> Great decor good happy hour deal   probably tried all appetizers loved them all including house made salsa <EOR> The best tacos town    Also service top notch   I highly recommend octopus tacos also fish tacos   Everything good here  <EOR> Banditos looked really awesome when drove other day couldn't wait check out!

There's couple things might change ! Still cool looking spot overall   Being family full Mexican food chefs restaurant owners Mexico tend little picky  bring mom give place second chance since she didn't care first experience   She ordered Baja fish tacos 2nd time around she satisfied  Woohoo! Lol    I ordered carnitas enchiladas salsa verde crema Which did enjoy  actually prepare enchiladas add protein top enchilada which thought different  actually think I'd prefer way now!   There's few things menu I'd come back try but come during lunch hours lunch break   Perhaps Tuesday come back happy hour taco Tuesday tacos 50% off   There couple recommendations id in regards food ingredients taste etc    I am fan salsa  salsa home weekly  know everyone likes way however salsas only way mild no kick all I don't mind mild salsa all but salsas sweet tasting  When don't finish all chips salsa know something off me  Perhaps offer something little more kick even little spice?  In addition noticed same type consistency flavor rice beans  almost sweet taste them well  Now think if could id just ordered enchiladas alacart just minus rice beans I love rice n beans tho! keep 3rd side offer roasted veggies corn  I did enjoy complimentary guacamole upon check in  place wasn't packed service good  giving place benefit doubt giving them 4 stars   think good potential   Hopefully back try some cocktails other dishes! <EOR> Back again update 8 months later   consistency staff detail refreshing   food still sublime Margaritas deserve your attention   highly encourage bring your friends Banditos feast won't soon forget   However few more freshly muddled cucumber mojitos just might yummmm!
