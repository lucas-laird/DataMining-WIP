definitely recommend place absolutely come back  <EOR> Take all your friends! took group friends despite lack culinary adventure loved did I  tapas excellent flavorful  seafood tasty ple according non veg friends   The meat looked delicious everyone fought last piece    Funky eclectic supports local artists  Chef Owner greeted sure if he usually does but he really cool   Also don' t discouraged its off strip location worth ditching bland buffets pulling car hotel lot short drive right off freeway    Great place! <EOR> If want eat alone your friends eaten your place   Food always comes plate time   told friends start clock when food came 12 minutes later server came asked everything was  said great when fish tacos arrive eat fiends   she replies Its coming calm down   then manager comes 9 minutes later says she forgot put order  Then offers drink hug   Yes  right hug   When bill comes charged fish tacos   This third strike against cool place just can't seem right   Won't back  <EOR> I don't give poor review but hoping maybe fix problem because place SUCH potential  Brunch excited atmosphere nicely priced bottomless mimosas fun music outdoor patio   However couple problems 1 Totally enough staff  need least couple more people give better service well some Bussers ran glassware giving paper cups water  Plus stations looked really trashed once people started vacate   2 menu online menu when arrive  Spanish Omelette which apparently ala carte but online stated came sides  Plus $14 00 didnt feel omelette even large enough especially just plate    A couple people left when because no greeted them  great place would want take large group however service way is  never wait which sure attributed staffing quality  Such potential   please fix your Sunday Brunch would love regular guest!! <EOR> First all downtown Vegas area rocks because cool places this   probably coolest spot Vegas locals   food amazing staff always friendly   bar next door fun spot outside seating area best town   place very Austin TX feel it   I highly recomend vegan stuffed peppers steak salad   However everything great here  <EOR> Pretty tasty server Ivan great  Affordable would recommend   Brunch only weekends But lunch still really good   Also realllyyyy cool building might want your explorer on  <EOR> Tried place first time today just moved vegas girlfriend   service pathetic  experienced bad service before course but extra special bad service  three pronged bad service attack long wait flat beer no apology  PATHETIC <EOR> Damn Chef Beni   Your food good Mesa Grilles world lost lot allure   I can't imagine sitting down better more playful expertly prepared array dishes last evening your place  especially price   sir onto something   comedian tells jokes laugh cook invite not   Of tapas ordered the sweet potato fries 4 cheese mac congrejo name but three loss name favorite   whole trully greater sum   Ah but desserts  hope buried order your churros chili chocolate sauce nestled side   No dining experience exceptional without attentive staff   Yours then some   But put evening over the top when stopped table chat not just cursory hello but actually discuss some your ideas inspirations   Your quirky pedigree explains much your menu kitschy surroundings   In few days leave home East Bay Ca sing praises restaurant unlike any other foodie neck woods   Damn Chef Beni   Go west  <EOR> Thanks Yelp found restaurant while driving around downtown looking good brunch   Great outdoors seating but decided sit inside bc really windy  little darker usual Brunch spot but all well   sat booth bc booths   table shape art easel pretty neat although little wobbly   I forgot exact names dishes but hubby crab cakes eggs benedict dish + bacon omelette  both coffee + juice  Per hubby crab cake dish delicious perfect  tasted really good! omelette good add little salt tho'  gluten free vegetarian healthy side  coffee really good   Ticket right $40 before gratuity   cheap but bad all quality food great ambiance great background jazz music   Service really good too   always 2 people waited us   We definitely back   menu looked really good very versatile   See pics blog ByteLyfe blogspot com <EOR> I love place numerous times  said stopped Tuesday 8 45 website said open till 10pm  Sign door says 9 00  greeted server duty asked if still time eat she said close 15 minutes grabbed some Menus going seat us  asked if could sit outside she said no no explanation  Just found online permit issue city   When couldnt sit outside without explanation decided would stay  serve plopped down menus said okay bye   locals love going lunch dinner enough even recommend friends living visiting guests city  lady server duty isn't doing company any favors making people feel unwelcome  give another try hope friendliness factor up  need places bar + bistro but hopefully realize need customers too  <EOR> I am giving Bar + Bistro 3 stars because atmosphere overall food quality soft spot LV arts district   My husband visited Bar + Bistro first time summer 2010 quiet weeknight thoroughly enjoyed it  black tagliatelle scallops pink peppercorns hubs nights special which chicken alla fiorentina  chicken stuffed spinach some sort ham cheese probably prosciutto mozzarella finished luxurious brown sauce some sort  dish outstanding but tried husbands chicken marvelous  could licked sauce off plate would probably give first born recipe  also cucumber gin cocktail outstanding  only bad thing meal cheesecake which bit dry but waiter took off check us   Now moving great part   Its now year since first visit must say most recent visit met same caliber first visit last year   This second time around visited restaurant during Painters Patio which seemed good idea upon arrival outdoor patio bustling artists poets performing over open mic  But came regret decision due blaring music poetry recitals made impossible converse without yelling  staff made point close bar door would problem    busy which normally good sign but upon being seated promptly mind you noticed restaurant seemed bit short staffed overwhelmed  disappointed find menu changed initial modern European concept Spanish menu looking forward enjoying Italian dishes initial visit  But ordered regardless enjoyed food  Everything very flavorful prepared care  Since party 4 ordered slew tapas included sweet potato fries caprese slider 4 cheese mac french onion soup cordero chops  sangria good but bit warm ice melted quickly which watered down overall beverage  husbands beer also bit warm he bit annoyed minuscule portion size cordero chops he expecting something more substantial $12   Don't wrong more willing shell cash good food however hard justify since service lacking  waitress did tell name would often disappear without trace ignore us  wait time food very long dishes slowly trickled out  took 10 minutes waitress provide silverware person party waited another 10 minutes spoon onion soup  flag waitress down when water glasses empty    Midway through service ordered donut churros which did appear finished tapas  flag down another waiter when waitress couldn't found find going on  He waitress she then told would 20 min wait donut churros already waiting  then asked check which took another 10 minutes appear  also noticed other tables received orders quite some time   When leaving waitress apologized wait  Overall 2 5 hours     for tapas  unacceptable  really want restaurant  food great love atmosphere caters artists but service leaves much desired seemed kitchen some hiccups well  may give another slower weeknight future but rest party enthusiastic  <EOR> A little blah  twice now  Both times help think food tastes bit Lean Cuisine  love room though  Very well decorated  Cool art  would back summer nights drinks patio but food better more steady clientele  <EOR> I would love place if weren't service  handful Sundays Bluegrass Hangover Brunch each time same Very slow very accommodating friendly all  very easy person please never complained service life but place hasn't impressed all  understand gets busy Sundays maybe improves other days  Other food drinks great a bit over priced atmosphere layout very cool  <EOR> We walk dinner place packed  thinking might good pick  Then realize First Friday  curbed enthusiasm  three quickly seated  We made reservations then waited    and waited  Then busboy comes over asks if we'd water  minute later someone else asks if we'd water  Then waitress finally comes asks if we'd water  I'm  sorry didn't  say yes all three but thought I'd nice  starting look good  order drinks beer tasted felt sitting back counter patiently waiting served  less then cold  ordered Tapas waited   20 mins  later dish served only mine  second served 5 10 mins  later  ordered Cordero Chops  Australian Grilled Lamb Chops  honey Aioli served small PLASTIC container! Along bit Cole Slaw no flavor slightly bitter Pickled Shallots laid thought    understand Tapas size serving portions but come on! 12 00 I'd see Lamb Chop  chop nice normal size but other half size little finger  Aioli sauce tasted should used cole slaw  Which did bring taste  Shallots well    My Daughter order Garlic Camarones  12 00 She said ok   Which brings Paella Velazquez 28 00 which Daughter Boyfriend Ordered  disaster  sent back   didn't look anything picture web site  main ingredients LOBSTER no where found  Some other parts meal appeared missing undetectable  feel if menu description should able see taste ingredients     Because daughter more diplomatic appropriate then am she spoke manager   upside very disappointing meal manager wrote off Paella PLUS gave 25% discount meal if wasn't  enough she took over top four free drink cards!  Because manager going over beyond try small Bistro again    One last thing I'd add don't understand why much confusion unfriendliness SOME wait staff   No doing tonight waitress didn't give name  girl brought food just plopped table left  expect Cantors  waitress ok   just think service needs some looking into well Chef keeping closer eye being sent under name  cooking staff  shouldn't such long wait time food served  entire order should come same time instead piece mealing out  <EOR> This favorite places eat town! great vegan menu  <EOR> a good eatery middle art galaries <EOR> I loved place!!! Hangover Brunch amazing! ordered     Food Chicken Littles Scrambled Eggs Toast Chicken Sausage Brioche Custard French Toast  Drinks Bottomless Mimosas $12! They also full bar   Excellent food!

Right heart Art District  recommend place if looking delicious brunch spot food drinks reasonable prices   definitely back! <EOR> We come many times now both small party larger group  service always friendly accurate great  Sometimes take while your mimosa glass filled but just relax listen Bluegrass band  recently made reservation leaving message day before bringing group 30  promptly call back verifying request could met  Other times called left messages regarding reservation when books  Despite having large group waitress great friendly  never bad experience here! <EOR> Small menu but really great food  If your looking unique brunch stop it  <EOR> I Vegan Burger Sweet Potato fries fantastic! also Banana bread beer it tastes smells just too!  not sweet damn good <EOR> The food mediocre portions small prices set accordingly portions! Way overpriced eat full meal  If im gonna spend kind money nice restaurant place  tried many things menu yet blown away  Presentation nice but flavor great  ingredients taste fresh service always ok  yet served great server bartender    <EOR> Overall really bad dining experience  couple friends specifically bluegrass brunch  host sat outside despite band playing inside bar table covered dust cigarette ashes  20 minutes no server ask  waitress came wiped down table took order  food came completely different times server didn't know which order which  Two completely finished eating before final order came out  Food awful but really bland way overpriced  glasses made cut glass beer bottles which could cool but mine cracked around rim which dangerous  Some woman dogs sitting directly top another table which gross  Several people came bar lit cigarettes directly beside table  Gross  dust blowing off vacant lot next door kept coating table which made finishing meals impossible  again gross  waitress friendly but totally inattentive  Maybe more crowded normal inside  whole experience called mind visiting little brother's frat house banquet night something  reality scummy dive patio masquerading fancy brunch  Most probably would much better inside   looked nicer there  Patio giant disappointment  No way ever back  <EOR> Love try new places risk taker when comes food   Finding creative menu tapas pleasant surprise especially enjoyed friendly staff willing answer foodie questions menu!  Big plus visit table talented Chef Beni   great place take friends off strip even better way support local business  <EOR> Always bad service worse food  Being local now tried place few times over past two years  Consistently bad  Mingo right next door Art Square! <EOR> Went late night dessert fig pecan baklava excellent ice cream homemade molten chocolate cake just right needed chocolate fix  <EOR> They take forever service terrible  2 blocks house would convenience but anymore  bussers very attentive but servers bar staff garbage    Example 1 asked vegan veggie sandwich cheddar cheese sweet potato fries  sandwich no cheese regular fries  When asked server sweet potato fries she told out  So     You're telling item didn't mention let pick own side?  Example 2 champagne brunch  run OJ 2 glasses more   ask just glass champagne hold over server tells no its just champagne mimosas only  kidding me?!?!
