Unfortunately did meet expectations  came boyfriend late night  outside decor different maybe somewhat uninviting  boyfriend wanted leave soon walked just based off decor  other hand actually mysticism place  feels secret hangout spot me    I can't speak drinks because didn't anything drink  simply try food  started off jalapeño poppers  really hungry tried finish but couldn't  missing certain je ne sais quoi   needed some more flavor think    My boyfriend ordered bulgogi sliders  pretzel bun description first called attention item surprised when sliders came regular buns  asked bartender why weren't pretzel buns he said he wasn't sure but stopped pretzel buns long time ago  business should definitely update menu very least sure server bartender explains item no longer same description  boyfriend did also complain meat dry    I saw photo Yelp vegan flatbread vegan meatballs looked delicious  asked bartender if could still even though wasn't menu he said could  super excited it! When came no vegan meatballs  burnt flatbread tomatoes mushroom basil  Even though looking forward trying vegan meatballs flatbread still might good if wasn't burnt  tried eating softer parts but pieces could even bite through    I STILL wanted place ordered vegan poutine  Ummm   well   it okay  wasn't anything would actually return for  think bartender could see frustration he brought some samples vegan deviled eggs  actually good! tasted exactly deviled eggs  try avoid soy much possible personally wouldn't order this however definitely recommend any vegan misses deviled eggs!  Like said beginning really want place good  hopeful improve menu especially vegan options  respect them even providing vegan options bar  open til 4am  <EOR> Really cool chill local bar bar beautiful mural Owl front outside wall  Inside really nice trendy music selection delicious food!

While owner admits faults he seems great guy  really trying understand vegan movement  He's very passionate believe misunderstood passion  He didn't even want eat regular burger front he trying hide apologized offend me  told fine great time there  He's going through hard time trying keep business going think needs support people  Just needs some kindness strangers he's also trying support local artists selling art there  <EOR> Five star restaurant quality food neighborhood bar atmosphere  owner staff very accommodating friendly  <EOR> OMG LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! absolute BEST beers Im love Coq meat sandwich       <EOR> Hubby enjoyed food especially sliders  wasn't such fan crab cakes  Jalapeño poppers good breaded Home made potato chips great  owner Steven very pleasant chatty  Handcrafted cocktails really good but overpriced venue location $12 Prices cocktail menu  don't wine  Beer taps down repair but owner says he travels all over find new unique craft beer IPAs hope Steven's sake Owl finds footing  Definitely needs clearer signage facing Hacienda  doesn't stand all  juke box would help give atmosphere  Decor bare bones rustic  price drinks would nice able relax more comfortable setting  plans expand menu brunch   Also sure why TVs  Saturday afternoon none them tuned sport ok don't American football just sure point them  No closed captioning 6 different shows no purpose   back look forward seeing place evolves tough location  <EOR> Every proper city needs excellent vegan metal bar Las Vegas doesn't disappoint  There's good art walls good music speakers super nice bartender comfy seating tasty food the pulled pork sandwich meateaters delicious yr carnivore friends   There's also sweet resident rescue dog wasn't crowded all  I'd definitely recommend if vegan friendly metal bars your jam! <EOR> This relatively new restaurant located abandoned warehouse those places seems if don't know where probably supposed tell but going tell all anyway   This farm table restaurant good ambiance owls everywhere music spot making feel college apartment great service but its highest note food  Cuban sandwich creole potato salad  friend tried vegan deviled eggs  vegan menu there  deviled eggs tasted curiously deviled eggs but savory kind sweet kind you're used getting your aunties your grandmas  Cuban sandwich best ever likely due quality ingredients  forgot take picture though  creole potato salad contained smoked pork creole seasoning tasted great too   For casual spot great food Owl worth trip  <EOR> Amazing selections beer! blue cheese bacon sliders just amazing hits spot  Love atmosphere very dark lighting late night  Fun spot dating? Haha <EOR> Been wanting try place awhile several reasons  First off everything heard Owl farm table gets Las Vegas  Secondly really appreciate creative cocktails made quality ingredients  Also even though am seafood diet I see food eat best friends strict vegan  Annoying! really challenging going eat somewhere grownup  Sure plenty smoothie shack type places but gal likes adult libations meals  finally great excuse found ourselves having six hour break between wedding dinner reception  Knowing ice cube's chance hell she would very many vegan options feast reception realized no better time now!  And brilliant idea was!  We opted sitting bar case The Vegan questions  warmly welcomed gentleman behind bar  Come find he Chef Daniel executive chef Owl he incredibly passionate he does  think must changed mind least three times due enthusiasm describing dishes  could literally taste everything  he painted beautiful picture mental palate  finally opted SOS which officially menu yet jalapeño poppers  delighted poppers weren't deep fried  opposed fried food but why mask beautiful ingredients bunch unnecessary batter? delightful! poppers fresh vibrant contrast delicious salty savory bacon cheese filling oozing them  Now SOS    AMAZEBALLS! Just imagine if Grandma's Award Winning biscuits gravy married spicy Latin lovers secret family recipe tacos  All topped decadent egg  Oh yeah!   The Vegan ordered vegan devil eggs chia flatbread pizza topped tomato basil vegetarian bacon vegan smoky cheddar which believe said house made  She bliss! thrilled didn't another fight over she should order  Conversation usually something Vegan get? Me Looks getting salad    Vegan But don't want salad     Me Then don't damn vegan! Thanks Owl sparing annoying conversation umpteenth time! While waiting food Stephen owner came over help navigate fun extremely well thought cocktail menu  both decided Tijuana Hooker pleasantly surprised he took time care himself  Just doctor ordered! light refreshing 100 degree weather  Bursting flavor without being sweet  But just case weren't positive love thought absolutely necessary try second one  Wink wink!  Oh don't think waited months come without partaking single most important food group you? No matter full dessert its own separate compartment  Chef Daniel kind enough let Vegan know vegan dessert called Wicked Apple but would take 20 minutes  Between apple sinful bourbon pecan pie both extremely happy campers!  Now level quality both ingredients level service would think some trendy spot Strip  even close! best part getting such amazing food jewel located inside dive bar  Come are! Although bit dressed between wedding festivities could just easily come sweats flip flops felt place    Thank Owl nesting Vegas quite possibly saving friendship! <EOR> Immediately upon entering establishment annoyed OWL  way door slams LOUDLY almost enough want leave but really wanted give place chance  chose table sat down might possibly most uncomfortable stools planet  immediately greeted owner which very nice  He sent over waitress gave menus left  looked over very empty unappealing draft list filled breweries haven't even heard local beer made selection  However instead waitress coming take order guy executive chef shirt came asked if wanted which utterly confused me where did waitress go? ordered some things he left  waitress came back took rest orders but then informed only local beer tap just kicked also jalapeño poppers wanted  Saturday night  point convinced episode Bar Rescue just waiting Jon Taffer barge in  received beers which some Nevada based but Las Vegas Local beers awful  sure if lines beers themselves ordered Left Hand Milk Stout all previously luckily tasted fine must just horrible beers chose put tap  while annoyed uncomfortable seating moved low table right door  Obviously mistake because door slammed even louder over there  another person join order margarita  Easily best thing night  ordered some deviled eggs off Vegan menu rubbery bland  then enough ready just give place money go  course took forever check money taken  Always seems case when want place anymore  But weren't only ones wanting there  whole night kept watching dog assume owner's obviously scared uncomfortable  He kept walking around tail tucked wouldn't approach anyone kept trying hide under empty center table  felt bad whole time  loud busy he obviously hated it  hope stop allowing safety least   My trip exactly month ago know now tap list more full when but always tend beer brewery misspelled beer list which drives crazy  If going respect craft respect places enough misspell beers people put hard work into!
