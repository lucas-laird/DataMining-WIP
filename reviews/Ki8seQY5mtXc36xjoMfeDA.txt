Super good pizza but really sad don't jalapeños side sell garlic knots garlic bread pizza the slice window   Great late night munchies! Elodia made experience A+++  <EOR> Cafeteria ambiance   Sarcastic server    Tiny tasty thin crust pizza fire baked hard cracks   Would more suitable appetizer  <EOR> We finally tried place  Love decor friendly staff  Farmers Pizza egg  delicious good sharing  friends Spicy Hawaiian Pizza  only complaint wasn't gluten free  <EOR> Really enjoyed place  pizza very good  Fun drinks  prices right  service GREAT! definitely back  Alex great very knowledgeable  <EOR> Was hungry tasty pizza while walking through Linq decided try place   Upon entering greeted front then promptly seated  really loved cool laid back vibe distressed painted brick walls   After looking menu decided Gianna which fennel sausage mushrooms pine nuts mozzarella  Also ordered pint Big Squirrel    The pie really terrific perfectly cooked crust slightly sweet tomato sauce  found nutty ness pine nuts pair amazingly well fennel sausage  Yummy  good fact ate whole pizza myself    My only gripe $16 50 price 12 pizza which thought high but when consider location well     Anyways next time Linq definitely back tasty Flour Barley  <EOR> Just average nothing special bit pricey though get   thought personal pizzas pretty expensive 12 15 dollars   family came friend two young daughters   wait 30 minutes before being seated outside Saturday   all weren't very hungry party 7 including 4 kids under 12 ordered 2 personal pizzas   server looked abit weird because ordering little he's probably thinking he's going big tip    took 30 minutes order which fine because weren't any hurry   pizzas tasted pretty good service overall but below average   finished didn't see server 10 15 minutes til while bill   Overall just average place  <EOR> My teenage boys loved it  meatballs 3 dish wings 6 plate appetizers  raved special coating wings   Our server recommended 2 pizzas Parma Calabrese  Both pretty good as your typical fast food pizza  Crust thin flavor good  place almost empty service prompt also friendly  I'd give 4 stars 5 pizza doesn't compare favorites Duo Forni Settebello but price inconsistency brings down 3  stars  strip everything more expensive  2nd time meatballs different sauce watery   As side note Linq nice area walk around restaurant full windows facing pedestrian zone  <EOR> Priced rather high think  wanted something quick before concert Brooklyn Bowl  The BB line long  seated quickly let them know hurry concert  served quickly when order pizza  pizza good  wasn't anything special  service good  probably won't back though  thought $17 small pizza way expensive side  Way Vegas   let's stick tourists  Next time sure arrive Brooklyn Bowl early enough try food  <EOR> So Homemade Italian Sodas amazing here!!! Caprese appetizer Honey Tangerine Basile Italian Soda Margarita Pizza  first two great pizza decent but nothing mind blowing  <EOR> Great place fun atmosphere near Linq   Pasta excellent great craft beers tap  <EOR> Seriously     first single slice pizza did want could finish  pretty much cardboard bland toppings cheeses definitely compliment sauce  Never again  cringe say this     but I'd honestly rather eat Little Caesars  <EOR> Great pizza even better service  bit pricey side but large portion  Highly recommend wood fired pizzas <EOR> Very good oven pizza  Taste delicious Family restaurant good drinks great customer service  Definitely come again  <EOR> The pizza really good! They interesting combinations but everything really testing  3 night row  I recommend this <EOR> Got Cav's special pizza BBQ Sauce coleslaw kielbasa French fries  Wait what? heck does actually work taste magical?  Anyways  Cavs 6  20 it   By way check eat BOMB garlic bread  <EOR> A OK pretty much best way describe Flour Barley  no complaints but wasn't anything particularly memorable meal service either   I dined recently before seeing show nearby hotel  seated immediately although took some time before server ever made table no big deal     We decided share garlic cheese bread start good  then shared Calabrese pizza which topped meatball italian sausage prosciutto cotto mozzarella chili salsa verde  yummy  also glass house wine   Overall nice little meal but mentioned nothing special  prices high side which expected due location I am complaining just pointing out   <EOR> i definitely agree previous reviews OVERPRICE 11 inch four sliced pizza  quattro pizza which basically four cheese pizza  taste okay nothing great it  crust super thin  hubby carbonara pizza  tried slice flavor sunnyside egg pizza just overpowered taste all ingredients  service though quite good but just takes approximately 30 40 minutes pizza come  <EOR> Better thought! I'd give 3 1 2 star   Flour Barley pizzeria bar located Linq between Sprinkles cupcake store Tilted Kilt bar   addition dine restaurant bar offer quick pizza window   original plans dine Brooklyn Bowl but closed private event  Stephen's mom tired walking fortunately place nearby ended being good second choice all   For Yelp users free order garlic bread when check in   garlic bread valued $10 50 great starter 3 us   bread generously loaded cheese worked great marinara sauce    great freebie appetizer  bad free!  We overly hungry decided split bunch items dinner  antipasti board consisting 3 hand sliced Italian meats cheese marinated olives vegetables $17   antipasti board good choice 2 salamis prosciutto 2 types cheese artichoke olives   excellent selection price  meatballs which 3 'grandma's style' beef veal pork meatballs tomato sauce parmesan salsa verde $13   Many people posted yelp best meatballs they've had   guess overly hyped just ok    expected bit softer but dense coarse  Bucatini alla Bolognese beef veal ragu basil parmesan cheese $25   bucatini may most expensive dish $25 but also decently large bowl generous meat sauce   also easy share  Margherita pizza $13 50 added ham $1 00 more  Flour Barley offers 2 styles pizza pizza rosa which traditional red sauce pizza blanca garlic creme sauce  decided play safe signature Margherita   Surprisingly called personal size pizzas larger expected perfect 3 share other items    Out 4 items ordered pizza which supposed specialty least favorite   dough tasteless truly just flour ham prosciutto ham Canadian bacon making overly salty   could skipped saved ourselves $14 50   Dinner 3 came just under $60 before tax tip no dessert drink   server just ok   He did come refill water he came check food but took long time check end meal   I would recommend place if you're looking decent meal but quite honestly there's many Italian places Las Vegas just good food even better pizza    Secret Pizza located Cosmopolitan  <EOR> Stumbled upon place Thursday night long day driving walking  Saw sign outside restaurant reverse happy hour 10pm close $10 pizza  waited little under hour 10 roll around while don't take orders over phone sat bar took order  Also if check Yelp free order cheesy bread! $10 PIZZA CHEESY BREAD?!
