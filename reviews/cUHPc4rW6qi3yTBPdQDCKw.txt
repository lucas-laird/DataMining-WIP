Anywhere ever gone dine buffet dinner service water first thing served upon being seated  no pitchers water anywhere fact guests actually bar water! When asked water served tables wait staff very friendly seemed bother asking them    2 chose buffet style service which staff prepared handle capacity  Even letting staff know approximate number guests expecting which reassured would no problem food ran 3rd table servings few more tables go    guests waited least 15 minutes more before food replenished staff nowhere found when should monitoring food levels  busy catering regular diners wasn't even busy!  Overall good ratings food thought soup bland party decor but POOR service party received  would recommend place large parties 50 more  <EOR> I really wanted taiwanese breakfast   so came here   The restaurant really tacky  expect old run down chinese restaurants    If you're going order soy milk yu tiao rice roll egg taco then can't wrong    If stray at least breakfast  then might run into some trouble  also really craving onion pancake   boy did regret ordering that  First off dark odd color  looked onion pancake once frozen heated re frozen now re heated me  also didn't layers   it just blob onion pancake  pretty disgusting     <EOR> Do there?They put extra tips your bill! paid 178 49 put 32 tip bill because party over 6   When check bank record saw $230 bill!!!! could add more 50 tip?

My departing comment should never when see restaurant few patrons   <EOR> Do place if looking good Chinese food  don't know doing   Here why 1  Bad service  spilled tea moms clothes didn't say anything  empty tea pot never filled  asked them fill up  forgot ask them again   2  Food Sichuan food  ordered chongqing fried spicy chicken spicy didn't any Sichuan peppercorn  joke  better   3  other yelp reviews mentioned 15% tip already included sure check bill    Again if know Chinese food find place very disappointing  If can't distinguish Sichuan shanghainese Cantonese other Chinese cuisines place might ok food wise   <EOR> This place getting worse every time come here  now started adding gratuity even though party 2  add even if your order take out  Total fucking bullshit    The service horrible  girl working looks fucking bitch doesn't seem want wasn't happy pay higher gratuity then would given   Be warned!  Update mom called later complain same lady took care added gratuity     and lady said next time let know local add gratuity   uhhh what?!? didn't realize tipping required now  should lucky if tipped such horrible attitude service! <EOR> I haven't reviewed forever  angry hate restaurant  But truly should pass restaurant  much contemplation initially wanted Shanghai soup dumpling but saw next table literally left untouched ordered Dry Noodle Chef's Special Sauce  Let's just say should busted Top Ramen would ten times more satisfying but then again 0x10 would still 0 actually doing disservice Top Ramen  dish consisted thick ramen carrot strips mushroom boiled egg  sauce? Plain water bit soy sauce color taste  didn't know chef's name Kikkoman  When told waitress tasteless asked if could substitute she took bowl back added black vinegar  pet peeve having disappointing meal  Anyway should read Yelp before stepping in  Hope don't mistake  <EOR> Very nice restaurant free wifi  fast  food also delicious  Don't believe rating  <EOR> so overpriced! cost 50 bruch 4 people nearly order anything  waiter complains order little  RU kidding me? never again  <EOR> Had before food always fairly good quick   Ordered Crispy Beef which listed under house specials $12 75 specifically pointed item menu    It okay but when bill came changed Tangerine Beef $16 95   also charged $2 white rice two us without being asked if wanted rice being informed charge   When did Chinese restaurants start charging white rice?  seen Indian restaurants but usually tell charge   Did time argue overcharge beef due having tickets play     Won't back  <EOR> Three main points horrible service terrible food overly expensive menu extremely small portions   Conclusion total failure    What else? Uncut vegetables leftover ingredients looks expired sauce all cooked together your meal  Every single dish looks same exact same taste  Imagine eating fish beef and or tofu but all same texture same flavor not mention same leftover ingredients again  Last verdict attempt unless want leave Vegas disappointment    I'm very sad  Waste money garbage stomach Yelp give them 0 stars?
