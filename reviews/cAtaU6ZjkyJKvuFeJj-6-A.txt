While generally recommend Captain's Cove must warn against ordering World's Healthiest Dessert featuring Xocai chocolate restaurant hawks  consists medium sized chocolate cookie scoop vanilla ice cream square chocolate itself  cookie gritty horrible flavor dessert set back $14 same most entrees menu! Yikes! yourself favor order cheesecakes which quite nice reasonably priced  <EOR> My friend thinks place bomb but limited sandwich type menu lunch w average food   water view though artificial still nicer no view all nice sit outside   very quiet 3 tables occupied Sunday brunch October when did go while still 75 80 degrees out  <EOR> This great location good food    but terrible management  used lunch enjoyed limited sandwich selection  Wait staff young inexperienced same owners convenient store next door but would forgive them because lake location quaint setting  Then day s**t service came  Waited 45 minutes sandwich    When inquiring vague answer  1 hour party already we only patrons decided pay salad actually made table talked owner explaining gently situation  Reaction OK  sorry apology   It causes great concern when owner actually care well being business  used number 1 fan  <EOR>
