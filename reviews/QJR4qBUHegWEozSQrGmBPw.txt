 favorite thing restaurant wasn't crowded music wasn't loud   perfect ambience relax nice dinner while Vegas  <EOR> I find Yelp great 2 things finding great restaurants should try avoiding terrible restaurants should avoid all costs   clearly case latter   place 4 stars utterly beyond me   only place ever would literally give 0 star if could   Being originally northeast truly love appreciate Italian food   disappointment   While food very good service takes place down F    without doubt worst dining experience ever entire life   majority people interacted incredibly rude point where just sitting trying enjoy nice dinner an excessively expensive that start feel defensive   possibly enjoy dinner kind atmosphere?   top everything took long right time food close closing time   lead last table restaurant trying finish while closing   Before even finished everything manager kindly told union shop strict rules getting kicked out   Yes really   many great restaurants yourself favor literally anywhere else! <EOR> Been least handful times over years when wallet gets little fat starts burning hole pocket  cheap drop least $150+ two appetizer entree desert drinks but its oh worth it    everytime  decor fanstastic interesting look around although over waterfountain thing    Anyway only reason attempt near cheezy played strip days  dreaming souffle now mmm  chefs truly artist masters craft thank your fine work! always nice taste millionaires billionaires eat everyday  <EOR> This yelp review   going follow handwritten not typed major concession geek letter thanking them   I've eaten Olives every time Vegas since found place   Usually lunch occasionally dinner   wife enjoy flatbread pizzas tapanade   She really likes Pink Limon no longer menu but +1 star They also seating indoors take time sit terrace watch water ballet   Very enjoyable chatting nibbling then pause few minutes watch fountains  +1 star    Now reason they're getting handwritten letter   Last night special occasion maitre'd Angel made significant effort ensure everything incredible   He seated terrace but away rail   allowed see ballet yet warmer wind 65 degrees Vegas today cold night   He did few other couples showing above average attention detail +1 star    I snuck ordered dinner fig prosciutto flatbread prime rib special both awesome +1 star talk special dessert wife   He bounced few ideas off then brought backup save both  +1 star Llena came wonderful passage write plate then served each glass champagne   took some time write all but when came perfect! +2 stars dammit won't high We gone Picasso night before but enjoyed far more  We'll back soon land McCarran again  <EOR> I struggled deciding rating one  hand food amazing but other some WORST service ever received   I came special dinner during bachelorette party  service received most staff fine but waiter seriously rudest waiter ever encountered  more think angrier get    To start off when made reservation asked if celebrating special occasion told them bachelorette  dinner even Bride sash once did he acknowledge special occasion no congratulations no nothing whatever  Before taking order he seemed dismissive table  He barely gave any attention during meal when he did he extremely rude aggressive us  guess would understand if being difficult but thought extremely tame polite table throughout entire meal    He seemed even more annoyed when didn't order enough him  huge lunch most weren't very hungry ordered some less filling items  He repeatedly made comments little eating if ready finally order steak lobster  extremely annoying condescending  understand important waiters tables order lot but even if don't does give right treat poorly   As food sister ordered Tuna Tartare Ricotta Ravioli Sangria Chocolate Cake all items delicious    At end meal he gave ton grief splitting check  cousin worked waitress years tried working see which way split check would easiest  He basically yelled difficult check blew off  then found job even ring cashier does that  top all drama all cards charged 2 3 times  sure resolved but just icing cake such horrible service experience    Seriously guy straight mean entire meal  But despite horrid attitude still fantastic bachelorette weekend  <EOR> Very solid meal here  complimentary bread spreads very tasty    Fig prosciutto flatbread 4 stars very tasty savory  Chilean Sea Bass 4 stars corn pudding side added pleasant sweet note dish <EOR> Total waste money  might worth if sit outside view fountains but would it  loud inside wife gave trying yell conversation communicated hand signals  loud restaurant forgive but food also poorly cooked flavorless  Ribeye if even Ribeye cut thin could skirt steak  also burnt greasy  Then covered bland red wine reduction literally no flavor  wife's chillian sea bass dry beans under cooked hard  only saving grace bread tapenad  Never again  <EOR> Beef carpaccio  ono  salmon overpowered heirloom tomatoes dish ordered but friend's ricotta ravioli redeemer  If sit outside even watch water show  <EOR> Came extremely hungry looking forward lunch  table party 5 5 3 adults 2 toddlers bun oven @ 34 weeks server Scott took order while patiently waiting expected some complementary bread olive spread just everyone around us  mouth drooling love bread olive spread tables came shortly before immediately being served there's  felt table being totally ignored even when drinks served   Surprisingly some entrees came still NO complementary bread olive spread   asked guy served some entrees not main server Scott if some bread olive spread he said ok  rest entrees came AGAIN asked bread olive spread but time server Scott  Finally having request vs just being served bread olive spread without asking just ALL other tables olive spread it! Really upsetting something simple nice restaurant this  <EOR> Really amazing food  wait staff really cool  friend's salmon over cooked waiter made sure immediately taken care of  beef carpaccio delicious  ambiance very sexy  Good all around  <EOR> Waited 45 minutes $17 glass house red wine  Food OK but worth price I better pasta home   Service slowwwwww  clearly rely fountains feel don't effort   Bread amazing though course when asked more said sure but never brought more   <EOR> The best thing place view fountain  said best patio near window  flat breads delicious  However larger plates all very average  soft shell crab pasta pretty bland steak sandwich bit tough  Stick apps drinks enjoy view  <EOR> Food terrific  Patio fountain seating limited early call reserve   Ask closest fountain seats  If rare steak tartar tuna tartar fabulous   take food alergias seriously just ask even bread selection accomodated  far tastiest most tender pork chop had  <EOR> There's nothing eating stone's throw beautiful fountains  chicken ravioli dishes incredible but $50 sirloin tough disappointing  Expensive but Vegas    <EOR> So arrange 2 30 reservation Olives end getting little closer 3  Upon arrival find unbeknownst us chefs leave 2 45 no longer serving lunch but one page bar menu consisting mostly appetizers  disappointed but hungry decided accept requested seat outside could sit fountains    Despite NO being outside told allowed sit outside  Upon asking why told closed except during lunch dinner   This made no sense but proceeded meal nonetheless   We ordered appetizers drinks saw basket bread butter asked waiter if could some bread  informed bread actually MENU item came cost  can't think time life restaurant CHARGED bread butter  very put off this   So food finally comes very good  burger carmalized onions very good  All all disappointed service general atmosphere place run between lunch dinner  wouldn't back despite positive recommendations quality food options  <EOR> We Olives based being listed good watching point Bellagio fountain reviews saying gluten free options  While okay sort of near windows really watch hear fountain show absolutely table outdoor patio  While staff generally accommodating dietary restrictions nearly much other reviews led expect  Perhaps standards getting higher more restaurants become helpful  did bread available while everyone else bread basket once wasn't sitting watching them eat  couple slices toasted sandwich style white bread very light fluffy  good olive tapenade came bread  There separate gluten free menu items marked such regular menu  process ask something if server doesn't know ask  Helpful but rather drawn out  also wasn't option substitute sides ended potato side cheese couldn't really eat  while just settled something  specialties seem flatbreads pre made pastas wasn't great choice  They gluten free pasta option but substitute regular pasta dishes most which some kind stuffed prepared pasta  option gluten free pasta basic marinara bolognese which seemed sort silly such fancy expensive restaurant  They tablet drink menu which more gimmick offering anything different  mom very good cocktail mango passion fruit sugar rim okay but VERY sour  charcuterie platter very good prosciutto salami pickled vegetables cinnamon dusted walnuts figs three kinds cow cheese  Substitutions goat sheep cheese weren't available though server checked  My mom both roasted chicken  don't recommend it  pesto potatoes good though could only taste because cheese  roasted vegetables okay but rather sparse  chicken nothing special pretty dry  dad veal pasta dish he proclaimed delicious  The server did best within available but didn't turn meal worth high price tag  efforts only thing keeping above two stars  However lowest price tag seven restaurants listed fountain watching all rest being listed $50+  If you're going fountain again definitely outdoor table even if extra wait  <EOR> lunch 1 11 bar awesome usual    the beef carpaccio meal itself best best best carpaccio ever had   its OUTSTANDING worth trip here     <EOR> Known simple Neo American cuisine pays attention its ingredients overall good experience  interior design very flowy romantic kind Lothlorien meets old Spanish metal lamp sculptures    We shared three appetizers main course  salad satisfactory two different styles foie gras served plate looked forward soon saw menu  warm roasted steamed  Mm    foie gras     only thing failed did de vein thing properly which meant did cut cleanly fishing stringy things  But tasted great   An interesting part menu offering various flatbreads topped various offers  simplest buffalo mozzarella sprinkled dry herbs  nice soft mozzarella having bit more dense less stringy consistency plain mozzarella which tells actually thought behind choice rather just novelty  reminded very much pizza Mozza preferred much better   The main course seared salmon pepper crust  Very unfortunate server late picking kitchens  sitting under heat lamp long time came near well done  still decent texture but because meant seared wasn't flavored much but since cooked when ate tasted very bland  Definitely something would try again when done right see would been  every other dish done pretty well feeing sadness more disappointment  <EOR> Olives provided very tasty lunch wonderful view   We fig prosciutto flatbread start probably could enough salad   But pushed through each butternut squash ravioli   worth extra effort easy see why dish which helped Todd English's name   I look forward trying dinner some point  <EOR> My fiancé OLiVES recently anniversary  multiple times time absolute most romantic dinner because server Paul  If anyone chance come restaurant ask Paul he'll treat upmost respect! Paul take care way your visit best  come back always asking Paul <EOR> Absolutely fabulous food starters finish   veggie girl carnivorous boy   this restaurant all   fact he picking off plate   tapenade divine could meal itself   started eggplant flatbread stop ourselves fear spoiling appetite   butternut squash ravioli which raved Yelp good reason   so velvety rich   Olives Vegas without feeling pretentious   We'll definitely back again  <EOR> The boyfriend decided stop somewhere eat before shopping hearts out  He eaten before hadn't  Even though he raved food still little wary because felt if didn't time scope Yelp page  Especially because usually chooses where eat carefully reading all quick tips Yelp reviews restaurant    After seated looked through drink menu provided iPad  tried Fountain Mist which little watermelon boyfriend cucumber sugar cayenne pepper rim  completely forgot name but refreshing pepper gave extra zing!  We ordered two appetizers entree  first unsure whether would enough food waiter Dennis accommodating  He told see full felt appetizers could always add another entree  Now onto food     Bread basket  A great selection bread served olive tapenades  couldn't stop eating it!  Appetizers Grilled squid octopus Amazing! squid octopus grilled first then sautéed delicious tomato garlic sauce chickpeas   Beef carpaccio eaten every restaurant serves only portion huge but definitely #1 list  Parmesan onions polenta scallion cream garlic aioli just works well together I'm drooling while writing review    Entree Scallops prosciutto 3 scallops delicious truffle parm risotto  first bite delish but when took second bite made sure some CRISPY prosciutto just fell love!  I definitely want come back try other dishes menu see dinner menu offer  wait staff extremely attentive funny just personable  left huge smiles faces full bellies    Couldn't really ask more  <EOR> From warm friendly service delicious gnocchi enjoyed visit utmost   On own tonight hoped grab seat bar  V two different hosts checked bartenders seer if seat would open soon but odds didn't look good   Enter anther hostess asking other restaurant options bam! Take one!    Food incredible guy always wants more portion size perfectly filling     This new Vegas staple me! <EOR> First let say Boston Olive's fan many years apprehensive Las Vegas  venue but pleased say unfounded   seating through desert Olive's met expectations   Beautifully plated salads entrees knowledgeable waitstaff lovely view accommodating kitchen made outstanding meal   With many restaurants LV where price does necessarily indicate quality reassuring find high standards Boston location upheld perhaps exceeded  <EOR> Good food but made wait 15 minutes longer reservation time  <EOR> We group 11 dinner bachelor party  seated chef's table indoors but view fountains which awesome  food also fantastic  don't olives but try tapenade came bread start  pretty good  figured if restaurant called olives then try it   We fig prosciuotto flat bread start amazing  main course beef tenderloin asparagus tempura potato puree  very good  would say food quite good Gordon Ramsey's Steak restaurant but experience just good  <EOR> So glad ate here!

Ciao Bella!       Last but least want mention Olive's Sommelier Tammie Rusenberg wonderfully knowledgeable made great suggestions table  All all magical evening overlooking fountains Bellagio! <EOR> We came while staying bellagio great experience  limited time asked waitress Sabine if anything could quickly  She suggested beef carpaccio prosciutto fig flatbread  ordered both crossed fingers would arrive quickly  took very little time oyt amazed since pretty busy inside  Both dishes delicious happy waitress helped selections  definitely coming back especially since didn't enjoy fountain view ate ran  <EOR> I really enjoyed olives   started tuna tartar delicious although tad bit oily side   also brought bread before meal selection olives olive spreads   All three delicious   seafood risotto wife ravioli   risotto good but shrimp very fishy little bit turnoff   wife's ravioli great she very happy selection   dessert banana fosters which absolutely amazing comes highly recommended   few different alcoholic drinks during meal all which unique but delicious   Again really enjoyed olives   Give try  <EOR> We restaurant lunch little kids baby toddler   Even thou restaurant kind upscale atmosphere very chill relaxing  nice booth view famous fountains kids super happy when show started  Service impeccable food delicious  couple flat breads including goat several appetizers shrimp crab absolutely amazing!!!!!! Such awesome flavors!! again when come LV!!! <EOR> Lazy lazy!!  SLIPPED big time week least  Usually favorite LV restaurants Olives let down  and special occasion too    Specifics Caesar salad included relentless little chunks hard unripe tomato ??? stale croutons no anchovy all could taste  Well maybe waved over romaine but dressing bland course no salt pepper table being such special place   Well   Ricotta ravioii Italian sausage gummy pasta raw tasting tomato sauce virtually unseasoned very light sausage though finally found couple pieces hiding out   Dessert Nice generous portion coconut creme brulee very good but little PARROT MESS topping mango something two sugar cookies just stale but off bitter bordering on rancid   Okay  No didn't complain send anything back  guest mentioned special occasion  But should least TRY even Tuesday night    Generalities Okay know Las Vegas food likes fancy perhaps thinking helps justify prices but really parts menu such overwrought throwback! never thought anyone could softshell crab sound bad but bragging watermelon panzanella salad olives feta croutons etc  really ruined me   wonderful softshell crab?  don't any confidence own dish cooking abilities?   And could CAKE sound bad? Well describing dirty south styled almond cake did trick   Urk   Rice maybe but cake   SO disappointed    <EOR> Not favorite   but bad   I made reservation 7 30 performance O when very crowded sat pretty quickly  waiter definitely took some time warm us   we vibe he felt because only ordered glass wine each not bottle entrees not appetizers entrees little less important people indulging  He ended being very nice end meal even snuck doors onto balcony catch end Bellagio Fountain Water show    Now let's talk food consider myself foodie while mother much  Because didn't feel spending 50 dollars entree settled 36 dollar chicken  mother Tortelli pasta  While chicken good definitely wasn't hot should plate however scorching which led believe dish must sat under heating lamp while finished cooking mothers pasta  flavors good but temperature left something desired    This place good   but experience did blow away  If table balcony probably worth whole trip but place just didn't rock those prices   it should  <EOR> Excellent! pleasantly surprised pork chop perfectly cooked presented  wife combo two pastas just good  Try Ralph waiter he may best ever Vegas  sat outside although hot evening still very comfortable <EOR> To contradict some place changed folks found Olives least good before   such enjoyable dining room   bread basket tapanades olives alone would meal wondered much solo dinner could eat without embarrassment answer lot    ceaser salad flat bread pizza along fine pinot noir exceptional eating   Staff friendly but warm   Truly delicious food lovely experience pricey but Bellagio! <EOR> I point Olives every time Las Vegas  delicious!   Every time order butternut squash tortellini  it's perfectly seasoned there's lots squash just right amount noodle  also bring neat assortment breads olives side appetizer    The cocktails also wonderful service pretty excellent too  But favorite part all view! see Bellagio fountains off night  great view during dinner! <EOR> This review long overdue  absolutely love restaurant  Vegas favorite! Every time town dinner if would dine every night  service spot friendly staff attentive servers  food amazing  bread olive spread serve before dinner die for! being able sit patio always huge plus or sometimes ask table window view see water fountain show usually 6   Love it! <EOR> We Olive's last night dinner hands down worst meals ever life   ordered Halibut which requested cooked well done   green beans limp over cooked  potato cake served luke warm pieces hard burned could choke it   food totally disgusting!!!  only good thing served bread bottled water   could obviously tell microwaved meal came within 5 minutes ordering   am mad spent over $100 nonsense two people   Absolutely ridiculous   only reason place gets one star because Fountain show which course know could watched side walk   Ugh never return place ever!!!!! <EOR> We made reservation through casino host hoping pull some strings snag coveted outside tables near fountain   No such luck all fountain view tables wait list only meaning show your reservation just wait   reservation 9 30 informed upon arrival since late already long wait list outside no chance getting one   Bummer!  thought chance might better late reservation heed warning   did decent booth view water   restaurant casual dress code but maybe bit far guy next table attired wife beater shorts 9 30 Sunday night    bread yummy more dessert white chocolate walnut rolls!  shared shrimp scampi flatbread heavy creamy just picked off shrimp   main Chilean Seabass incredible!  loved whole dish portion huge   DH Ribeye enjoyed it   dessert cookies ice cream yum also ordered Falling cake but liquidy rich little ice cream one tiny scoop accompany ended really eating it   Overall restaurant just okay   Although seabass delicious wouldn't way eat especially without fountain view   tables crowded together lucky booth but most tables lined inches between them   many other good places eat Vegas $$$  <EOR> I would start off saying Joe Thank you  always Slingback sometimes some best Carpaccio ever around world  Anyone going beautiful lovely city Las Vegas happen walk Bellagio's stop best Martinis strip  Unfortunately place closing soon  Hopefully if you're reading still open  <EOR> When Vegas please dine Olives!   wonderful way spend evening   Dining alfresco behind magical dancing fountains Bellagio    The food fantastic staff especially Bobby amazing    Please reservation but plan arriving good half hour hour before if would dine patio   7 15 reservation turned into  9 pm seating but staff advised kept updated   totally worth it   cookie butter creme brûlée amazing!

I ordered following plates 1 Pan cake Foie Gras steak $25 again if know big fan foie gras   give a OK one   don't know but did original taste   But guess mini pancake tasted really special love it! 2 Escargot $18 hmm    don't recommend this   sorry 3 tuna tartare $18 no      don't order this   just plain tuna sashimi i think marinated some cucumber bottom      If SGV area please La Grande Orange Cafe Pasadena tuna tartar only $14 4 Lobster Pasta $41 a big disappointment   sorry say didn't it   saw many people recommended lobster gave try   Failed   big plate little portion pasta two pieces lobster   lobster tasted only boiled   sauce pasta okay but $41    hoping more  5 Lemonade $6 it tastes different good   But $6 think overpriced The service okay expectation   view again super nice despite weather   took some photos server nice enough help take photo     The total bill came around $115 which quite expensive me   but good thing $60 mlife credit only pay rest   don't forget your mlife card   If gamble use pay!! heheh   My tip reservation ahead time   around 6PM before peak time    If prefer bigger portion food    maybe really good place try   But if enjoy view enironment food must try! <EOR> This restaurant recommended because staying Bellagio  tables little squished together but some tables great view Bellagio fountains  Ask tables!     steak good flavor but then little tough even though cooked medium  Eh! Disappointing $57 steak! friend's seafood risotto totally bland  shocked because looked good! drinks good but wouldn't pay almost $20 martini again     Overall nice view decent atmosphere but waaayyyy expensive quality food  MANY places Las Vegas amazing steaks FAR better prices  <EOR> My boyfriends brother married Las Vegas excited Olive's  dinner ceremony   lunch before nice time   14 time   boyfriend called restaurant reservation 6 weeks ago recommended sit 'farm table' since long table would fit group   He called confirm reservation again talked great going farm table   This farm table theory nice idea but semi private room behind kitchen   middle July pretty sure cooler outside table   When asked manager making cooler said knew table hot working hotel colder   If knew table typically hot then why would recommend group sit wedding dinner?  This supposed only days where newly married couple shouldn't worry anything instead enjoying dinner new bride groom several times talk management heat     top being hot some people party having leave because side table unbearable service absolutely awful   server nice did even review specials until someone asked if any   He rushed through ordering when ordered champagne he did congratulate bride groom he just asked needed glasses bottle   I bite salad because hot then spent rest time going restaurant   bite salad fine but lettuce little wilted maybe because hot table     I'm really complain days but far worst dining experience ever had  <EOR> My wife Las Vegas during week July 11 2016 anniversary   dined Olives 13th   First all waiter Richard very nice attentive   beef carpaccio which always must when dine here   good but better past   Next lamb entree while wife scallop entree   lamb cooked order but found lacking seasoning maybe bit more salt   fine but nothing great   wife's scallops lukewarm risotto bland   shared chocolate peanut lava cake   end meal very disappointed whole   expected more dined before food awesome!!  Very disappointed feel quality food slipped   feel could done more terms recognizing anniversary price paid eat restaurant   restaurant use must eat whenever Vegas but sadly pass next time town   would given Olives 2 1 2 stars but don't option  <EOR> I give Olives 5 star review amazing service view dinner   reservations 7 Tuesday 5 people  showed 6pm drinks bar asked table outside willing wait it   perfect table outside seated right 7pm  service top notch everyones meal very good  <EOR> Don't come fine dining experience   atmosphere loud   yell your dinner companions   price want unless want loud   Small details missing service    Inconsistencies food under salted   Nothing exceptional  <EOR> Only gave 4 stars because nothing particularly AMAZING but everything including service GREAT  Food flavorful portions large glass never empty didn't feel rushed but didn't wait long food either  Would definitely eat again  <EOR> Excellent food service ambiance! Hottie find top spots eat whenever we're vacation    say fantastic but all options Vegas may take few more trips before back   being said let's meal   started off chopped greek style salad better  your traditional greek salad but particularly memorable   dinner other hand fantastic! Homemade butternut squash tortellini could tell pasta made order because little organic uneven    but loved it!  Unfortunately Hottie's $50 Steak looked picked local grocery store $5 very disappointing   dessert chocolate fallen cake ice cream   spacing flavor ice cream but remember being particularly delicious! Overall left fat happy! <EOR> Had antipasto flatbread  average large pieces artichoke sundried tomatoes olives  ravioli average  side lobster mac n cheese kind disappointing  Wish less watery more creamy  Good service  <EOR> Amazing restaurant Bellagio!!!! Food second none   Definitely worth money!!! <EOR> Great little restaurant middle shops Bellagio  wait 15 mins table but decided just sit bar instead  bartender Jonathan awesome  Very friendly quick  Chicken Margarita Sandwich Sweet Potato fries  AMAZ ING! basil aioli tomato fondue really made sandwich! Pear Two Martini tasty too! could barely taste alcohol even though know plenty there! olive tapenades delicious  could almost just drinks snack completely satisfied! <EOR> We 20 relatives father's birthday  quite good  filet sampled many other entrees appetizers  drinks good  most restaurants Strip waitstaff very mechanical unenthusiastic but very efficient  niece and I enjoyed running see water show every 30 minutes  sang brought piece cake  <EOR> In town conference great lunch 2years ago suggested group try dinner   The wait tolerable reservation but room over filled screaming loud  Services slow due probably crowded dinning room but Joel attentive helpful   Come hungry portion sizes huge!  Wine list iPad which going dead   a little more attention detail may helpful   Lunch experience much better dinner  <EOR> I've dined many times  think need least two hands count number times dined over past few years  Tonight far worst experience restaurant  dining alone second time ive dined alone but first evening  staff very nice but when busy very attentive  sat waiting someone more 15 minutes stop table  food okay but fantastic evening  always experience but tonight left wanting more chef  foie gras appetizer hot  duck Ragu awful  corn overpowered duck sweetness unexpected  gnocchi mushy perfectly cooked long shot  Disappointing  <EOR> Great bread tepenade  update olives potentially read know your servers rude  Period  coming regularly say 5 years now  count hand many servers weren't rude  where am ?

Kinda confusing  and taste didnt its looks   dont recommend ordering oysters all!!

Wished would ordered small appetizer meal! ricotta ravioli which light savory same time  Small portion but able leave room molten chocolate peanut butter lava cake dessert! waitress playful professional offering coffee? Espresso? Tequila?! meal  Loved it! Cocktails tasty too! definitely going back! <EOR> I usually 4 start experience Olives but service product execution left lot desired latest trip   put off cocktail list which given recent Vegas trend sweet large ingredient heavy drinks more style substance  husband's rare steak came mid well major disappointment avowed carnivore  other meals fine though rave worthy  Most frustrating completely incompetent service left glasses empty orders untaken entirely long awkwardness when she would actually table painful  All being said atmosphere inviting view Bellagio fountains lovely  used say Olives affordable upscale option Vegas 4 star food now consider affordable option 4 star ambiance but 3 start food 2 star service  <EOR> We very disappointed place  8 30 reservation hostess said she'd right while helping people didn't reservation 10 minutes  informed we'd wait until 10 15 sat outside but could sit table next window two fat people immediately front outside blocking view   Oh well interior super nice dark very romantic feeling    Our awesome busser quickly brought three great kinds bread some olive tapenade Pellegrino quickly  pretentious sommelier quick assist but looked down selection a $125 bottle Stag's Leap Cabernet   very distinct feeling some reason because Im young thought didn't money something ridiculous   Our waiter dropped off menu then seemed completely forget us  finally waved down ordered tuna tartar non spicy possible sweet potato gnocchi grilled sirloin    The tuna tartar came pretty quick very good  little spicy raw date but loved it  took seemed forever food arrive  date loved sweet potato gnocchi  steak cooked correct doneness but per usual steakhouses needed more salt  no idea accompanied steak  Server nowhere found  finally flag down he explains plate but sure was  HAHA    asked salt but never came  15 minutes flagged down busser hooked up    We finally bill food wrapped up  Place incredibly overpriced service quality food worth it  Its same price Bouchon would recommend anyone Vegas instead    Oh all double charged me  Im still disputing speak    <EOR> Extensive wine cocktail menu  Ordered Caesar salad split  perfect size  Salmon large portion served w very tasty side  ordered 2 sides Cajun shrimp mac n cheese risotto   Both large portions really really good  wish only ordered 1 b c just much  Took chocolate peanut butter lava cake go  heavenly  only problem photographer  don't nice restaurant buy Disney esque pics  felt restaurant nice that  <EOR> My boyfriend took dinner 26th birthday  We seated patio amazing view Bellagio fountain show   even let move closer when small table available   I started meal cocktail Lychee Blossom definitely flowery    little floral taste   bread cracker basket alright fun taste different tapenades olives came it   We infamous Beef Carpaccio which really saucy but tasty nonetheless   also tried grilled octopus dish served chickpeas tomatoes which also tasty   My boyfriend shortrib truffle fried egg butternut squash tortelli   bite short rib which alright   but better  tortelli good but bit sweet   ordered some corn polenta dish little weird   usually love polenta but fresh corn mixed kind threw texture off me   garlicky spinach compliments chef guess really good   We ordered lemon tarts dessert I LOVE lemon desserts but  little disappointed when arrived   3 little store bought tart shells I work pastry kitchen   so know brand bit raspberry puree runny lemon curd sloppily spooned topped over whipped cream some pretty candied lemon rounds     They also sent salted caramel cheesecake which sounded good but needs just little bit work I enjoy salty sweet desserts but tad heavy salt     Bottom Line It nice birthday dinner   weather nice enough sit outside keep mind beginning November Bellagio fountains  beautiful   food itself so so considering amount assume he payed   would come back lunch if area just carpaccio but think I'd come back full blown dinner  <EOR> Paul provided best service ever had  He gave extra attention daughter made feel special  place lucky server  long wait even though reservations he made experience worth wait  All food good especially cookie butter dessert  No better spot watch fountains enjoy mist patio warm summer night  Ask Paul it'll inflated menu prices seem bargain  <EOR> Even though disappointed give Olives another chance because didn't see best it   First table patio windows overlooking Bellagio Fountains   Instead right door spot open shopping mall   almost eating food court   Very bright very loud   star right there   sure eating other side restaurant would much better   Second food little experimentation think could find pretty fine meal   But going pricey experiment   meal hit miss   started charcuterie board which good but no better could put together any high end deli   entree Gnochetti which nothing special   wife started lobster bisque which definitely second rate   But she salmon flatbread well enough   other dishes menu sounded interesting maybe just didn't right picks   Still another star   Everything else pretty good   service quick especially considering large group   drinks stingy wine list seemed please everyone group   bread basket fresh tasty   Dinner definitely bargain but hey Bellagio   expect? way speaking expect why none restaurant menus Bellagio website list any prices?  if ask can't afford it? <EOR> One best culinary experiences ever had  Upon arrival served delicious bread basket variety breads green black olive tapanades well marinated olives  breads awesome roll nutty perfect compliment olives  reading other reviews started off carpaccio  sure this  don't raw meat fish but  vacation going daring  Wow! inspired take more chances  delicious hard describe  topped creamy roquefort crema sauce shaved parmesan  best most interesting things ever eaten  flavors combined perfectly each bite practically melted your mouth  Again wow! entree Butternut Squash Tortelli brown butter sage parmesan cheese  Although little sweet side very good but way much appetizer  husband Grilled Venison Bloc crispy fried portobello cap garlicky spinach bacon polenta rosemary grissini black currant glaze  Right away he said glaze tasted mole sauce which Mexican chocolate sauce  alarmed since he hates mole  Well he definitely didn't hate dish  He said ingredients combined perfectly spinach perfect compliment glaze  He really liked it  shocked  wine also spectacular  Riesling best ever tasted   want call name wine perfect! didn't room desert unfortunately  service just excellent  sat outside beautiful view water show Bellagio  Super romantic  made reservations asked seated outside glad did because restaurant packed I loved having dinner

ONLY reason gets 4 stars way busy server catch hard hold anyone if needed something order  didn't that  Because fancy place expect excellent service! <EOR> My main recommendation when dine Olives Beef carpaccio probably best $20 plate  er mean MOUNTAIN  thinly sliced raw beef find  balsamic whatever other sauce drizzle over flavorful beef very high quality  Plus comes polenta can't wrong polenta  Ever    You don't need read anything else    But case you're curious other noteworthy points  Great view Bellagio fountain show  would've liked sit outside watch but RAINING day went  Imagine rain Vegas   Good service  Granted lunch time maybe aren't busy but nonetheless service very nice food came fairly quick  Ravioli just OK probably worth $22  Check specials day  seafood pasta menu day came yummy  The flat bread sandwiches very large come huge serving sweet potato fries!   Overall fancier establishment but if want save some $$ come lunch  beef carpaccio while you're sit back relax watch water show! <EOR> Their beef carpaccio different drizzle sauce place beef over arugula  different when ordered but oh enjoyed it    The lamb chops perfectly tender steak good    When manager above beyond help large party  She ensured tables would ready near proximity each other  service point  Which something feel most important  <EOR> Excellent food service   Try beef cappacio seafood risotto   best restauants LV strip   Prices cheap but pay for  <EOR> If earliest dinner reservation 5 00? arrive SUPER early wait line 50 other people same idea seat balcony Bellagio water show!  If you're everything menu always sounds looks good place ask server what's best they'll honest or least tell like    flatbread pizza excellent don't mind if linger 3 water shows  <EOR> Amazing restaurant probably best view Belaggio fountains  Food awesome service great  Definitely worth recommend place  <EOR> That Beef Carpaccio die for!  different Flemings   and serving size huge!  nice little surprise under mound goodness block fried blue cheese polenta  balsamic glaze crazy good!  Use crisps come bread basket   to transport into your mouth  then just sigh    <EOR> I Olives many times cannot count anymore  Vegas over dozen times Olives favorite spot Vegas  review many spots Vegas but feel some feedback seen time real   This very good quality establishment solid reputation food where 3 piece suit spend minimum $200 dine here  Therefore bit busy crowded hectic pretty much time doors open until shut them night  usually good sign   I never once disappointed food  grilled octopus best dishes ever dine NYC often exposure top notch food  If eat seafood then must try dish  bread spreads receive upon sitting down great  entrees very tasty  many mostly daily specials cannot pick favorite but cannot wrong   Olives extensive wine selection  should able find bottle which your party's liking  sommelier knowledgeable friendly every time question selection   Now bit advice anyone wishes dine patio facing Fountains Bellagio  reservation  before your reservation 20min plus   ask if possible wait table patio open  guarantee table then when your reservation  should obvious why but some folks seem forget table looking enjoy probably top ten even top 5 dining experience Vegas  dined Olives least 10 times AT LEAST all but time able onto patio parties and includes parties 8+   time wasn't due small wedding reception and probably paid fine penny that which being held early evening Saturday  little savvy little understanding little patience long way   The service always impeccable  water never more 2 3 empty wait staff around server never rude ignored guests  Yes times took few more minutes food then 'normal' whatever is   But amount folks usually restaurant should expected understood   This establishment few finer dining establishments would ever entertain giving 5 Stars Yelp   why did  highly recommend return next time am Sin City  <EOR> I only pleasure grabbing quick lunch bar but very impressed  bartender extremely knowledgeable bar menu dinner menu Las Vegas general  He offered several suggestions pertaining restaurant city all very spot on  cocktails delicious but pack punch as should   cannot rave flat bread enough  Everything perfect  impromptu visit glad worked way  <EOR> I last year December thought food just okay  ordered Grilled Squid Octopus House made Gnocchi Sea Scallops  auntie  loved since first time having grilled octopus but maybe 4th time much better experience elsewhere  also ordered glass chardonnay  itself chardonnay mediocre but complimentary olives table yummy  thought pricey quality food drinks  If wonderful patio view strip probably would come back  <EOR> 3 star only bread  breads delicious ask them bring another bowl  try crabcake fritter but ran out  then settle Cesar salad because didn't want anything else since craving crabcake  Maybe just maybe high class enough  just don't why Cesar salad isn't chopped up  comes few leafs top few tomatoes cheese croutons  Dressing olive oil maybe little bit Cesar dressing  prefer salad full chopped actually looking salad something plucked off few minutes ago  fried veal special pasta  He didn't much either  coming back place unless bread  <EOR> My partner very good dinner Sept 8th  first time both us  seated right reservation time   really look room very warm colors interesting shapes  feels little crowded though  seated banquets long bench table chair along wall although packed tight Paris NYC seating did feel tighter like  People side closer like  Would nice if removed 3 4 tables room   bit view Bellagio fountains nice touch  room very loud blaring music just very loud crowd  room intimate conversation  slightly dressed blazers dressy shirts pants nice shoes dressed better most room  food mostly excellent  Service began nice assortment breads plate various olives two tapenades all excellent  apps carpaccio which best ever beef tartare which good but under seasoned taste  dinners veal fontina fazzoletti short rib paparadelle  thought veal slightly scorched taste but still very good  short rib wonderful very rich flavorful tender  Some pasta gummed together deal breaker but kind drag  mentioned waitress great she offered replace but fine didn't want interrupt pace dinner   also couple wines glass which very well paired food  Desert excellent assortment cookies ice cream  Probably best plate cookies had   back  <EOR> Amazing Rosé  Amazing tenderloin beef steak  Amazing service  Amazing tapenade specialty olives  Hands down amazing  <EOR> Amazing food incredible view fountains  hostess little snooty when standing line without reservations wanted sit outside but plans Vegas?!?

Yes if thought type people appreciate it  <EOR> This place really just fine   very nice restaurant great service but food just ok  Cuban sandwich which some kind Chef's special day just kind soggy  Pretty much devoid all texture  came house made potato chips which weren't any good own since salted   at all put few those inside little less boring    Overall don't want tough Olives  Great service charcuterie cheese app good nice place go  <EOR> How give place 5 stars  Everything wine entrees perfection  server sweet  made some fantastic recommendations  place worth ordering $80 bottle wine  charcuterie board salami prosciutto goat cheese Brie cheese Gouda believe then lamb chops pork chop  Both plates empty  actually asked another bread basket soak rest sauce plate pork chop gnocchi  This defiantly place try Vegas local defiantly going back <EOR> We came Sunday lunch Easter disappointed   party 8 2 entrees cold service only ok because constantly ask refills   little disappointing much better experiences past wonder if things going downhill?

Service excellent order taken delivered promptly waters never below half full  Impressive wine list  Portions small price but  expected inside hotel Vegas  <EOR> Enjoyable trattoria style dining expert preparation  Overlooking famous fountains Bellagio  <EOR> We sat bar bartenders Ernie Jay great  Friendly patient great since humor prompt  sure back  <EOR> Good view TERRIBLE experience    My group 8 seated promptly per reservation impressed view fountains  gave ourselves 2 hours dinner before caught show  informed server assured would absolutely show   when all downhill   It took 30min drinks ordered then another 20min receive them  Only then food able ordered only then come another 40min later    Not only food incredibly delayed also incredibly inaccurate  girlfriend both ordered gnocchi dish but both received red penne pasta 3 measly slices chewy overcooked duck  left 5min eat inaccurate poorly cooked overpriced food before running in heels course still miss opening show   Also couldn't help but notice table next complaining moment arrived  where server whole time? Avoiding upset tables assume    I also cannot help but notice other poor reviews name similar complaints  business offers apology? Sweet notion but just doesn't terrible experience certainly won't feed group when seriously hungry definitely doesn't put money back wallet   NEVER AGAIN dine Olives  <EOR> Went without reading any Yelp reviews knowing anything other place run Todd English whose immensely complex recipes always liked  very impressed  meal haute cuisine anything very experimental in fact dishes seemed addressed wide audience but most satisfying meals remember  Let echo Yelpers' praise butternut squash tortelli which heavenly can't imagine ever see classic being done any better   A friendly waiter cool wraparound glasses took charge table evening which fine view Bellagio fountain which unfortunate accompaniment Lee Greenwood song  waiter very knowledgeable hospitable even offering split pasta dish try few varieties  Started off some cocktails which initially struck pricey but couple more days Vegas seemed rare bargain  Nice varied breadbasket olive walnut tapenades  Ordered beet watercress salad special port bleu cheese dressing which original outstanding  Continued sea bass which excellent but transcendent unforgettable tortelli which though half price meat options better  desserts also excellent English seems downplayed complexity desserts I Olives desserts cookbook which demands day's work per confection little though detriment  Triflin' Drunk alcohol and chocolate eightball  tangerine creme brulee bit easier tummy but equally delicious   Highly recommended  Reasonably affordable we paid around $60 per person three course meal lower priced entrees cocktail apiece   <EOR> We didn't actually chance eat here  made reservations wedding ceremony  When approached hostess stand couple days before wanted let them know booked wedding reception completely unresponsive  really didn't care  Barely even said word  pointed other one's screen then said patio buy night       Ok then asked tell means or   ? screw them  understand people married Vegas all time but least pretend day special nice choose your restaurant reception  <EOR> I've held off writing but finally decided needed put there   Seven visited Olives almost four weeks ago late Saturday night dinner   Reservations easy host hostess able seat outside patio around 9 45pm wonderful view fountains  Food very well prepared absolutely delicious  I strongly suggest going steaks meat great cut medium rare grill spot on   friend flatbread which very good all shared really well paired charcuterie board palates ready main course   If Olives only food would strongly suggest try it   If only   The downside service   server seemingly nice woman spiky hair came welcome take drink order   Great   Drinks then took 25 minutes come out   should probably mention 9 tables patio two servers working them though server probably only three four including the inside restaurant half full but other servers that    Once drinks arrived few them incorrect re done   which single scotch which ordered single ice cube   Now anywhere boutique restaurants single cube scotch a $20 finger Oban mind you means two inch solid cube sphere ice dropped finger scotch allowing mellow taste nose whiskey   When scotch first rocks and looked wallowing small ice cubes good ten fifteen minutes   server saw look face realized way ordered took back returning minute later exact same scotch as could tell watered down color small tiny cube floating if just pulled commercial ice maker   Nice know servers no concept drink prep   After all drinks told she would right back take food orders   Just heads right back Olives means 25 minutes again   Finally ordered food waited another 30 come six seven served   Yep six seven because server didn't enter everyone's order   final person party served 10 minutes later   might think server's attitude would apologetic humble but no she icy blaming everything kitchen    funny given manager brought late dish said hadn't entered     On hand yes other two three tables seemingly assigned server bit needy  But if can't most your guests you're server charge then need ASK HELP another server easily could jumped assisted different points  But quickly impression server competing other working tandem   If restaurant going successful wait staff need work concert each other ensure guests good experience which really failure both server management   Otherwise comments one If Saturday night Vegas you're looking place late evening dinner  look somewhere else  <EOR> My husband dined restaurant 3 times amazing  don't stay Bellagio but trip just Olives    Last year made reservations day wedding party 7  Paul waiter he above beyond evening special  started dining room but end evening he surprised moving patio coffee dessert  Everyone party agreed he made night    We back last week requested Paul when made reservations  patio table next rail  Paul remembered treated family  even took pics sent them folks last year    When Vegas always Olive request Paul  pricey but worth every penny!! <EOR> A recent visit Vegas good friends no less brought wonder restaurant  Can't say much place since first time    but say this    PERFECT dinner date  I'd suggest sitting outside watch Bellagio's water show don't worry heat lamps!

He so called food conscience police     I ordered Grilled Octopus Flat Bread Mahi Mahi   husband ordered martini lobster carbonara   flat bread came first delicious   Never anything before   Then came Grilled Octopus   Only then did realize already full probably won't able finish Mahi Mahi called waiter asked if he still cancel it   He very accommodating   He said no problem  point him!  The Grilled Octopus absolute favorite   very lime y very tender unlike most ones tried which kindda rubbery   excellent!  husband liked flat bread most   decided we'd share Lobster Carbonara   serving huge split lobster into 2 easy really share it   also brought extra plates in   Despite fact very delicious really enjoyed still weren't able finish it   matter fact next time come back I'd probably just flat bread grilled octopus   Lobster Carbonara very good but expensive $41!    I would given place 5 stars except dessert awful   ordered mango brulee tasted old  tasted sitting while   did even finish it   should followed instinct skipped dessert but then celebrating husband's birthday   birthday without dessert right?

never sick watching it  <EOR> Overall enjoyed meal lot   food while very pricey delicious though few execution issues   example otherwise excellent beef tartare two separate beds mashed potatoes really didn't sense   striped bass specials menu delicious   loved flavor butternut squash tortelli but thought plating wasn't very attractive   Portions just right size but most entrees hovering around $50 cheap night out   Service excellent   A note fellow diners please keep your voices reasonable level control your children   tile floors high ceilings Olives pretty loud  <EOR> As walk down hall smell place mile away  yet bad meal there! would totally suggest trying seat patio overlooking fountains  Great meal great view    would great spot propose    just saying <EOR> I came large group people leisurely lunch place just hit spot   opted Greek Style Romaine Salad without feta phyllo triangle despite being simple great meal   oregano vinaigrette spot on   also ordered hummus table couple dabs salad really took notch   Between complimentary olives table left well fed happy   While probably wouldn't ever suggest eat the modified salad only options vegan certainly wouldn't object coming along if others wanted go  <EOR> I really liked table balcony overlooking fountain   server excellent  Food mediocre best Vegas level prices course  Also little slow coming but don't mind leisurely meal Better rushing though its Disney something  <EOR> Service 5 5 Free bread olive appetizer 5 5 Charcuterie board 5 5 Ambience 5 5  I really really liked place  view deck best views manmade objects planet earth  <EOR> Gotta honest  good but wouldn't make  must visit next trip   Overall restaurant off putting smell olives especially if don't them   ordered beef carpaccio fig prosciutto flatbread   flatbread okay but nothing noteworthy  carpaccio also okay but lacked any major flavor notes considering all ingredients  desperately needed some acid spice brighten up    Again bad just wouldn't must visit price  far better See Julian Serrano Tapas <EOR> Food very good service PHENOMENAL   I ate three four months ago some reason can't stop thinking it  must share!  First seated patio front row view Bellagio fountains   talk magical!  We ordered charcuterie board roasted chicken midwest ribeye falling cake dessert  all very good  chicken juciest most perfect chicken ever had! knew chicken could elevated such level?  Here's real WOW factor  server extremely busy night but service did lack slightest  fact best service ever had  server five star restaurant standards very high trust when say BEST service ever had    My boyfriend's mashed potatoes little below par but when she came check food he didn't say anything  He's pretty easygoing guy    She came back 30 seconds later asked Sir those mashed potatoes? He told hot he would them she replied back saying thought so  knew didn't look right  She kitchen bring another plate perfect mashed potatoes    On busy night she could said anything took word it  But she way sure everything perfect  She also asked visitors politely give space when show time began  Another major bonus    I back again soon! <EOR> Food great but bar tender Jon easy eyes too  would mind going back view ain't talking fountain  <EOR> We stopped 10pm unable sit patio because closed evening  However when taking table host noticed table right window asked wait moment she could clean us  perfect! watched fountains delicious meal  bread tapenade fantastic bread just melts your mouth  shared mushroom flatbread really rich tasty but warned gigantic! fabulous attentive service delicious meal here  would definitely recommend visit  Five stars combination great food service ambiance! <EOR> We ate many different restaurants Vegas Olives far favorite  place open lunch then closes few hours reopens 5 30 dinner  able 5 ensure could sit patio best seats place   If early definitely only 8 tables outside  evenings Bellagio Fountains off every 15 minutes truly memorable experience  also enjoyed bar menu iPad  Each cocktail showed picture which appreciated  Food overall great!

but turned little rich taste buds  Plus giant lobster tail topped tiny bit tough   I mean hard complain lobster tail but guess just expecting wee bit more  actual handmade pasta pretty damn amazing though   The bf ordered duck special some sort duck ravioli maybe? he enjoyed but didn't rave it  bite two while used duck being gamier type meat seemed pretty greasy even duck  He still ate though course   The Bad Yeah yeah yeah  don't take reservations patio  sure probably logistically impossible  But seeing called MONTHS advance reservations reco friend ours made reservations extremely early evening 6 6 15 can't remember THEN called earlier day see if anything could do   I don't know  sure can't everyone happy just would nice considering only first time Vegas but patio only reason made birthday reservation there  Blah blah blah  know probably just being brat   The tables inside bit close together least where sat  all honesty didn't really bother personally but could definitely hear other tables conversations   and could hear ours much wished happy birthday doted fact boyfriend bought kindle much loved theirs  very sweet course but if we'd gotten sat next annoying nice people experience may different  Just something keep mind   The hostess little bit cold fish  But hey everyone can't having great day all time    I know seems lot neutrals negatives but reiterate whole experience really turned fun romantic great place celebrate birthday  So   yay Olives  <EOR> Simply amazing tapenade view kill scrumptious scampi flat bread sexy interior some best monkfish scallop risotto ever put mouth   Todd English little marketed less known restaurant Vegas strip but well worth visit   Great lingering dinner before O  <EOR> Highly recommended several people us! pass along same advice eat eat outside over looking Bellagio water fountains   Service top notch food wonderful evening very romantic! reservation!! <EOR> Average food Vegas prices  much better places eat Bellagio mention other Casinos    Food Large portions average quality Decor Dark Service Good but ran blue moon beer  How's possible? lol Conclusion Unlikely return <EOR> Important note both vegetarian   I mention because focus obviously meat which may great but any good restaurant cook veggies   four five diamond restaurants often overall pretty easy   While accomodating mediocre salad platter roasted vegetables veggie pasta   most obvious items which unfortunately only poorly executed     The ambiance beautiful but very casual     Great kids best romantic dinner   felt very high end Olive Garden us   Loud many large tables good decor overall solid   At end day am more critical because many amazing Vegas restaurants are   convenience shopping wonderful well decor but creativity overall execution poor  <EOR> I really fantastic experience  great food attentive service  gets quite crowded lunch time sure reservations come prepared wait   The must have beef carpaccio  don't even know describe but amazing  They're also known house made pasta meatball pasta really delicious  didn't fish much because cilantro rice bland interesting  However fish itself cooked perfectly  would say order beef carpaccio some kind pasta you're 100% sure fabulous meal!  It could 5 except two things 1  rice 2  couldn't accommodate window seating even though specifically requested it  <EOR> Very solid meal   Group four started three appetizers which highlight meal   party mentioned Todd English known flatbread prosciutto fig flatbread awesome far best dish   Tuna tartare also perfectly prepared but did comparable many other restaurants   also grilled octopus squid which seems trendy dish right now good but huge squid fan   As entree lamb shank   Again very solid but did take dish any new levels   MOst disappointing green beans tempura   tempura taste perfect but came kitchen room temperature   If nice hot probably would moved Olives five stars   Overall excellent meal but earth shattering  <EOR> Going didn't really expect much since foodie co worker scrunched nose when told ressies here   That being said expectations met  Met 3 course prix fixe menu consisting following huge duck salad while good much food stop halfway before completely full smattering not smoky pancetta atop sadly not medium rare piece salmon atop not good chickpea risotto overwhelmingly salty all around dry oreo bread pudding out box brownies would put shame any day  I guess would better off avoiding set menu  impressed  <EOR> Our first stop arriving Vegas buddy top reservations  showed bit early wait bar until table ready requested patio seat see water show 3 pm  most higher end places drinks pricier side boys beer settled glass pinot noir  No sooner did bartender whip drinks table ready waiting deck  picked great time year being October perfect 80 degree day shaded deck really lovely sitting outside  only imagine being pretty brutal summer being say 117? Yikes! They start basket mixed breads small bowl olives olive tapenade pickled garlic clove which husband thought roasted popped mouth crunched  Boy did breath stink later!   We started Beef Carpaccio Tuna Carpaccio for non beef eater garlic mashed potato underneath  Tuna Carpaccio really wonderful would never thought mashed potato but flavors meshed very nicely  For lunch ordered flat bread pulled BBQ chicken peaches  water cress crumbled Gorgonzola  fairly large good appetite couldn't finish eating appetizer  husband pulled pork sandwich fries other bud scallops which looked wonderful too   And around 3pm water show fountain pretty cool  All all good meal nice atmosphere little entertainment boot   <EOR> Onion bread incredible!

Pics <EOR> Olives recommended fellow passenger recent business trip  excited take husband during recent trip Vegas  perfect day arrived right opening time  Upon approaching seated hostess just stood staring never properly greeted us  awkward speak say We'd table two preferably balcony   She never once said word us  should've left then but starving  point which seated another hostess things improved  fountain show coordinated music awesome  ordered pasta dish sweet Italian sausage while hubby ordered Salmon  definitely enjoyed meal more hubby    But must say never return wouldn't recommend Olives friend because rude hostess  say first impressions lasting  way many other restaurants where spend hard earned money!  And record hostess old White woman 55 65 yrs old   just happen African American couple 30's combined income $300 000  both dressed professionally well groomed as always  Yet White couple 30's walked behind dressed jeans t shirts baseball cap  looking ever bummy! hostess lit them saying Welcome Olives  Thank dining today  Would prefer indoor outdoor dining?   figure! necessarily saying race factor but just saying      I hope Olives' management reads reviews see selection your staff affects your business  already shared experience few friends family members both Black White   may want retrain your staff proper Customer Service skills towards all customers  <EOR> If you're lost alone Or you're sinking stone carry on! May your past sound Of your feet upon ground carry Todd English's Olives! Fun carry on Michael Mina Sensi closed holidays Bellagio turned attention Todd English's Olives! mainly because name many restaurants he's opened notice right away dimly lit place general  Since December thoroughly appreciated playing Christmas music background fountain view table   The foie gras starter interesting experience me  love foie gras but don't remember eating its own  made appetizer brioche pears yogurt walnuts  When combined all components works really nicely  However if eat foie gras alone feel's very fattening think only hardcore foie gras lovers would appreciate since there's alot fat essence it    The sea scallops ordered very fun eat  put rectangular plate just ate left right truffle mashed potatoes cabernet sauce  some odd green don't know if used more garnish but just moved aside finished everything else haha  Last random personal side note I'm used wearing dress shirts daily basis but there's feeling restaurant dress code more formal side  dress code enforced anything normally don't even notice things but  overall feel Olives  don't generally everyone certain dress code just don't feel element  Obviously its Vegas most people dress impress anyways but  always case shouldn't be  Again reflection restaurant itself own personal observation while dining here  Enjoy fine food! <EOR> What let down Bellagio especially Mothers Day!   A great friend mine made reservations while ago sister birthday she rated them generous 2 stars but however still made reservations come see myself  Don't just avoid place    We've Bellagio's Fishtail Prime Buffet Lago Harvest more once nothing but exceeding service food  place wasn't anything even compare above  When initially made reservations asked table patio few days well advance  However when checked 45 minute wait  opt inside available seating  server Eric came took appetizer order gave half ass run down short menu  He took drink order then too  started Beef Carpaccio Tuna Carpaccio which favorite anywhere but here  received appetizer before server even came back take main order brought drinks bread even plate appetizer  waited few minutes wave down waiter politely  took another few minutes plates it  quality Tuna awful but great presentation for worth   ate wanted waited over 20 minutes waiter take main order  He surprised when replied wanted place order if he forgotten us  taking everyone's order he said oh sorry if took long  Mothers Day obviously didn't want rude let go  Main entree took long come course all really hungry  quality taste food bland  felt eating Applebee's  service other hand horrific! Excuse mind bringing bread basket all other tables? Excuse mind refilling drinks? box? check? dessert menu? dessert order taken? YOUR JOB?!

If weren't many other restaurants Vegas would definitely going each every time but then would miss much more there   But definitely something must try once!!! <EOR> For most part don't venture Strip meals  hosting parents past week realize might best described ethnic food addiction  past week experienced major withdrawal parents prefer casseroles curry    We Olives big family dinner  addition parents two uncles aunt great uncle spouses distant cousin also town  Heck should shirts made  Anyways great table right next window overlooking Fountains    The breadbasket contained some delightfully sweet rolls  healthy wholesome cinnamon bun but without icing more bread like  ate several those tasty buggers  ordered chicken  know boring  leg part chicken good but when breast dry  barely remember accompanying sides  think some potatoes hiding under there! Everything covered gravy  very Southern but necessarily liking  problem when sauce drizzled over every item plate  good but scrumptious want scrumptious  <EOR> Great atmosphere great food! Perfect date night! Also amazing view fountains!   I would definitely recommend Mushroom flatbread perfect sharing!

If worried doing fine dining thing leaving hungry leave your worries home!  generally order 2 things share time both wanted steal each other's plates   She raviolis seabass   eating Tao's seabass religiously skeptical but omg omg   sure even describe really   nice crust over risotto heavenly   rotation sure   <EOR> Great view fountain  Delicious food braised short rib super tender accompanying green beans perfectly crisp  lamb chops bit fatty unctuous but still delicious  lamb ravioli tasty but huge portion  big OMG beef carpaccio table favourite sure  charcuterie board beet pear salad nothing special  No room dessert unfortunately  Would return  <EOR> I started $15 mojito bar  then elected prix fixe dinner menu $55  regretted latter decision  Although starter two oysters fresh tiny could tell rest meal would unsatisfyingly small portion  indeed was! steak probably only 6 8 oz  extremely dry somewhat chewy charred  But sauce good though didn't enough cover char  Lastly sorbet dessert disappointing because texture dying sorbet making machine frozen yogurt    But  The service wonderful  waiter extremely patient while perused menu even helped when overheard discussing obtain show tickets  He sincere kind frequently returned table sure everything going well  And beef carpaccio amazing  extremely apprehensive eating raw beef but worried no avail  beef thinly sliced spread atop bed cornbread spring greens sprinkled prosciutto  Just amazing  The patio view great too  watch fountain show while having dinner  often that? <EOR> I can't believe place closed  flatbreads charcuterie board perfect afternoon lunch Bellagio fountains  <EOR> Like much LV Celeb Chef owned wildly overpriced some very skimpy pedestrian quality longer stay open   3 rib lamb chops 1 2 thick $45  Definitely once frozen borderline taste due age before freezing Chile Seabass $45  see review saying same Sea Bass  3 times before over years always good but last 2 good <EOR> First things first eat buffet lunch hoping still hungry Olives 6PM! Major fail     Since still relatively full lunch opted wait additional 45mins seated window where could enjoy Bellagio Fountain Water show    We promptly seated 6 45PM  Three different servers asked if could something drink  bit confusing because didn't know actual server night but felt nice acknowledged   My fiance ordered glass wine each then Hudson Valley foie gras appetizer Boston Bibb salad  Both delicious  foie gras melted mouth wished larger piece it  salad nice mix greens dressing very tasty   Since fatties continued order entrees  decided share fig prosciutto flatbread sea scallops   The prosciutto thin decadent paired wonderfully fig  scallops sweet juicy  truffle mashed potato delicious  Every bite could taste truffle oil coming through brought sweetness scallops even more  fiance thought truffle oil overpowering mashed potato lumpy enough but thought still phenomenal   We'll definitely come back try beef carpaccio other dishes full try time around   We ended night perfect berry creme brulee  berries fresh gave perfect tartness creamy sweet creme brulee  also bacon pepper cookies top actually worked really well dessert   Of course nothing could watching water show while enjoying such great meal! defiinitely worth wait  <EOR> This place potential  menu changed since last visit can't recall exactly however dry  want say pork came mac n cheese which divine  advice based experience would improve consistency quality preparation  Another visit might order  <EOR> Went dinner during business trip   always wondered restaurant located behind Bellagio fountains   service superb   table 4 split beef carpaccio tuna tartare   Both pretty amazing  ordered clams linguine   probably best ever had   light tasty hint lemon juice   noodles weren't your regular linguine noodles but more thin slices lasagna   ate fast!  One co workers ordered salmon he said pretty dry   Another co worker ordered mushroom paparedelle   Though good bit heavy side   3rd co worker   well honestly can't remember he ordered!  drinks appetizers main courses bill came close $450   wouldn't say worth all money but good  <EOR> Love patio Lake Bellagio!!!  restaurant favorites Vegas   Perfect lunch spot   Service great food excellent ambiance perfect   lunch today seafood pasta special   Great flavors good portion size pasta homemade   mom crab stuffed prawns   really good too!  restaurant always great option Vegas!!! <EOR> I probably eaten 10 times Beef Carpaccio reason   5 stars alone dish   hard describe just believe try yourself    I pregnant last 4 visits since must refrain consuming raw items chance finally try other items menu   The Scallop entree Fig Prosciutto Flatbread also 5 star worthy  But other dishes tried olives burger butternut squash tortelli roasted chicken dish hair above average thus 4 star rating whole    The view amazing service fabulous reservations must! <EOR> My boyfriend starting run nice restaurants haven't yet visited Vegas decided try Olives Valentine's Day despite previous so so reviews trusted Yelpers  treated very strange evening mediocre food   Service started when arrived 9 minutes later 9 15 reservation  made wait almost 10 minutes before being seated which would fine if restaurant busy full but dozens empty tables  service drive by waiter came asked if wanted bottled regular water then sprinted away came back asked drink order then sprinted away etc  All bussers servers apparently all trained same fashion speak quickly abruptly then sprint away  Plates clanked loudly tablecloth less table all but tossed onto table  Well least can't complain service being slow inefficient  Food general everything ordered smothered sauce making impossible taste any actual food itself  true carpaccio gnocchi pork chops  four slices duck included gnocchi very gamey coming girl loves lamb other meats live edge gamey    In all very blah date night experience probably won't back any time soon  <EOR> 3 5 star review  Put 2 week request patio seating 6 45pm Friday but when showed told wait until 9 30 particular seating  understand high demand but If request couldn't granted simple email would professional response  ended taking inside seating nice inside service super friendly  food scallops excellent wife ordered beef carpacio under strongest recommendations server strongly underwhelming  Considering reservation pricey menu disappointed results  would probably give establishment another try strong promise but initial experience 3 5 stars <EOR> Was town CES bus cas dinner here   Great service although seating arrangement bit strange ie cramped    straightened eventually serve really great olive spreads bread yum     I'm classic steak girl but if good scallop dish menu usually jump it   a'la orange scallop dish agrodolce sauce basically sweet sour which order   Unfortunately sauce acidic tip tongue bit numb teeth felt 3 layers enamel stripped   very strange feeling   bit disappointing since love scallops     Everything else fine but think next time town opting Cut wanting eat there! <EOR> Unlike review 22nd treated exceptionally  younger couple without glitz glam but treated royalty  Perhaps difference server  case Paul he absolutely awesome      Before going review let back bit  looking place eat night walking through Bellagio when wife said Olives restaurant balcony but first come first serve probably could there    being kind guy would rather ask told no ask all hostess asked any openings balcony  amazement told would table two 45 minutes if cared wait  night being beautiful chance sit outside eat readily agreed wait  Approximately 30 minutes later led balcony seated  balcony small I'd venture guess enough space 30 people  know sure but believe tables directly next edge overlooking Bellagio Fountain reserved Black Card mlife holders which not  seated back balcony but could still see fountains beautiful view strip  We also just happened seated 7pm when fountains played every 15 minutes saw whole line songs during dinner   I highly recommend timing     Like said beginning Paul server he wonderful  He treated special though suits bedazzled jewelry certainly no high roller status  dressed nicely though few balcony dressed very poorly even casual dining restaurant  served smiles warmth everyone else including poorly dressed group though different server   Paul even took picture camera during he called Picture time   He excellent sense humor matched ours which seems hard days  He made night    The customer service view fountains amazing but food   boy some best food eaten while  drinks made perfectly complimentary bread basket paired Olive Tapenade kind  Delicious! flat bread   well did last long  entrees wife ordered chicken ordered Salmon  meal perfect wife's chicken overdone but still tasty  could probably requested new but inedible still very delicious did not  full dessert though saw others eating looked amazing    Overall excellent experience would back if back Vegas  also highly recommend restaurant anyone looking delicious meal  If willing wait balcony would try time more frequent fountain shows  Well worth it!   Try Paul he amazing though rest seemed equally awesome  <EOR> Very nice   little hard day but Friday     Wound seat bar other feeling really needed rush through dinner could work another paying customer excellent   crazy mushroom pasta many levels flavor going here   it hard stop   did though consequently wound getting 2 meals 1 dish b c plenty leftover lunch another day   expensive if take into consideration   If looking cut down price might also wanna skip multiple $16 cocktails   didn't gusto   Something margarita but less sweet cilantro hooks me     heard everyone saying place sit balcony apparently wind excellent view dancing waters if sit there   so maybe next time   def back pasta    <EOR> Came lunch day nice even walking into restaurant  seated right away sat near great view  quite hot outside didn't mind being able sit outside  waitress knew ahead time half guests actually lunch break since worked best by  really fact accommodating end even packed box bread friends back work  Everything delicious  chose share Beef carpacio Charcuterie board Seafood linguine Grilled squid octopus  used getting calamari didn't really know expect grilled squid but found really good chewy some other places   Overall great time even short lunch everyone enjoyed food ambience  would recommend going lunch if staying bellagio happen shopping near by  <EOR>
