both burger ramen same time  <EOR> On way Las Vegas stopped since referred other family members   wait 35 minutes but did party 11   Green Black burger made Wagyu beef some truffle fries         absolutely amazing   Price $14 burger $4 fries well worth it   highly recommend place anyone thinks good burger before  <EOR> First all behind Subway    we little difficulty finding circled parking lot before finding it   Service Slow many reviews said however weren't upset all   didn't read reviews before going because thinking 200 reviews 4 stars all friends recommending worth try   didn't know slow service   just commented during dinner finished all appetizers burgers yet arrive   reason why think none upset because staff did seem very nice just new something   Oh boyfriend also commented should ordered appetizers when waiter came ask drink orders because he seemed really flustered interrupted order doing things   Also appetizers came way before water did which thought strange   Food Sweet potato fries really good   loved yuzu citrus aioli came it   Truffle parmesean fries pretty good too   came sun dried tomato aioli which thought wasn't good sweet potato one   think really depends personal taste because half liked sweet potato more other half truffle more   Garlic ginger chili edamame really good   love flavor much better plain salted edamame am used Japanese restuarants   Oxtail chili cheese fries ok   wasn't big fan it   think would preferred beef over oxtail   really couldn't tell difference except occasional fattier pieces meat   also would rather came smaller portion because meal itself   As burgers Kiki's burger Banh mi burger 2 BBQ Angus burgers some add ons   No party enjoyed burgers much   ok mine but wasn't good   think main problem completely fault didn't realized BBQ meaning sweet BBQ sauce   No patties sweet taste competing other sauces   brother took probably 3 bites bagged home dog saying he would prefer In N Out   and all other great burger places Philly   He thought even though he ordered medium came dry him   girlfriend Banh mi BBQ curry aioli don't think she even touched fish sauce   She didn't finish burger either   boyfriend thought burger ok but bottom bun soggy probably because egg running down side when delivered table   burger ok too   didn't wow though   boyfriend only ones finished burgers   Also boba drinks made fresh fruits   hoping but good thing asked before ordered one   did try green milk tea boba ok   I don't think come back again   If only take sweet potato fries edamame  <EOR> Great service AMAZING food totally worth 35min  wait table    Had Parmesan truffle fries while waiting burgers fantastic  Perfectly evenly good excellently complimented condiments  Must try    Had Ronin burger superb  Perfect combination sweet savory  Full flavor without being rich finish  bun fresh nicely toasted patty charred delicious while still juicy cooked specification toppings point  Literally nothing complain about  <EOR> Finally stopped Bachi Burger experience everything people raved about  Everything started great assorted pickles oxtail chili cheese fries fried egg top truffle Parmesan sweet potato fries pineapple ketchup  server seemed having rough day she messed order several times forgot bring coffee ordered asking 4 separate occasions  decided Shogun Burger $26 which Bachi's premium burger wagyu beef prepared medium foie gras unagi Asian pear arugala  Something didn't taste right beginning but server never even came ask everything seemed way busy even want bother despite fact sitting bar right front her  halfway through burger deconstructed find wrong realized beef issue over cooked dry completely flavorless  spoke manager came table very unpleasant manner said she would take care it  Upon returning she informed she kindly removed 10% entire bill which sounded great but turned $7 $7 off $26 dry flavorless burger  told would suffice she informed since eaten half burger 10% all she could do  She offered new burger FULL PRICE told completely inappropriate  she back showed burger chef arguing plain sight which allowed see hear everything he saying he told comp burger disgust  She brought bill back threw down front walked away without saying word  saying typical day Bachi Burger but absolutely disgusting behavior  burger just bad  meat flavorless patty thick Burger King Whopper patty definitely $26 restaurant quality especially since other burger ordered thick juicy correctly prepared very flavorful patty  top all off bathroom complete mess looked food possibly some human excrement ground into floor nearly vomited sight  Despite all would expect same experience again would give place another shot would recommend others because many options menu   In end handled bill correctly comped burger but completely ill prepared handling situations  server seemed overwhelmed busy she completely inattentive but very kind compassionate apologized repeatedly quality food  patron shouldn't argue case $26 Burger you're restaurant own your mistake take care it  happy restaurant brings happy patrons spend more write great reviews  <EOR>

I came around 5pm could tell pretty busy first glance  almost instantly greeted friendly young woman despite rush  believe she said name Bianca  almost taken aback since seemed pretty hectic she still polite charming  reading reviews expecting much worse right start! can't stress enough impressed though she seemed doing more job yet still made point update long I'd waiting 20 30   Left great first impression actually ended waiting shorter expected even!   I took seat bar buddy mine point menus organized  Everything easy find having ingredients all each item simple convenient idea  Aubrey also very helpful explaining menu variety drink choices just everything worked general  She really knew stuff!  Everything looked tempting try honestly but feeling more ramen mood burgers  huge fan ramen constantly trying find best Vegas offer   And if you're fan ramen am Shoku ramen definitely MUST  Oh man blew away  kept simple order spicy tonkotsu considering ordering extra ingredients but assured serving size would more accommodating  And grateful advice The bowls little larger usually expect very happy that! Especially considering delicious was  broth fused perfectly all ingredients tontoro seriously world  even order extra because good literally melts your mouth  lychee soda paired which super tasty little sweet finish though  also tried 21+ caramel milkshake which pretty interesting  Maybe little spiked but really nothing worth complaining because still great    The staff all seemed really nice while noticed some them did appear goofing off each other really didn't halt even delay any service  appreciate restaurant friendly people working always nice see staff along  service getting much gripe yelp expecting worst but then again stickler little things  know work fast paced environment busy restaurant  know maybe  why little more sympathetic toward but long everyone handling work getting stuff done restaurant no reason give anything less 4 stars  lot complaints read now starting sound more trivial appearing people upset over things being catered specifically them  Just cut workers some slack try realize they're working hard things done everyone restaurant   Besides though definitely plan returning soon try famous burgers! noticed some them pretty huge but if big handle easily cut into smaller portions  If you're someone doesn't sweat small stuff don't mind waiting then definitely recommend giving Bachi try  If you're some delicious food friendly atmosphere then place go!

The Miyagi san burger came perfectly cooked but wasn't anything jump Jesus over  truffle fries   man know those  seemed soggy truffle sauce tasted gravy  Expensive gravy   Making matters worse wss service bad really hate saying because any service industry position real pain when dealing public  being said server seemed rather disinterested only stopped take order bring bill no refills checking see average food was wasn't halfway full appeared quite well staffed  Could've gotten bad day suppose   Overrall if you're looking overhyped burger delivered unenthusiastic bristle place! <EOR> YUMM! most amazing burger ever! work late open late  Amazing food excellent prices  Staff definitely improved past year despite previous complaints regarding staff  Fret no more  try Manga Burger!

Whatever happened having nice cozy want back environment customers without patronage would business   Listen customers input your business thrive  food good but unfortunately returning  way saw many people did take jackets off looked just cold through meal  <EOR> My boyfriend would biggest fan burgers ever  decided order pick because wanted try different style burgers  Called placed order said it'll ready next 20 40 mins  arrived 20 mins waiting home  way received call them already ready which great pretty quick service  food pretty pricey going lie but worths it  patty seasoned well tasted different way kbbq  Kalbi Kiki  oxtail fries but wasn't great maybe just fan but ok  burgers made it  back <EOR> Service sucked first all  served kids meals last!     both parents glasses refilled  Glasses only refilled when asked  Food staggered kitchen  All food hot 'fresh'     probably sat expediter longer took eat it  Honestly worst experiences  even asked if first time which was  would think would extra mile them  Instead slouch walked restaurant floor barely smiling    For prices expecting more especially since competitive Las Vegas strip prices  Instead flavors poser  Very unsatisfied all ordered    When bill came put bottom receipt much gratuity give  Tip should estimated before taxes after  Needless say but less 'asked' for   coming back  <EOR> This places doesn't serve typical boring American burger  Bachi Burger provides many different types culturally influenced burgers  recently moved California immediately fell love place  Ronin Burger best burgers   and fries must try! <EOR> Like burgers  tried several different types  Worth every penny!

Staff also extremely friendly helpful pick influenced different burgers    Absolutely wonderful would definitely come back  fully agree assessment best burgers Vegas!!! <EOR> Came see all hype about  never come back  First off waitress irritatingly fake  food came quickly considering simple order plain burger just cheese bacon would think would right first time  burger undercooked when sent back politely manager brought new plate 10 minutes later informed put new toppings but burger same  food industry against health code severely frowned upon  mention fact girlfriend pregnant even though polite request waitress kept staring strangely gave fake now? question several minutes manager brought new plate   made paranoid something altered food  calling health dept also known friend    report them well tell everyone know eat establishment  <EOR> Great food! opted quick ramen bowl visited lunch  atmosphere great even Lychee Boba which tons flavor crazy sweet icy cold  ramen bowl tons veggies bean sprouts fresh noodles flavorful broth not greasy seafood Tantanaki?? option   Those dined opted pork chicken stating options quite salty  Whatever choose bowls come packed plenty spare  definitely leave stuffed  Wouldn't advise wearing white splash purposes  also saw some crazy oxtail chili fries stacked burger before left  If youre diet ABORT MISSION  Overall chill experience  <EOR> I review food never served   can't even tell if water decent because no ever came table   sat 15 minutes while wait staff walked around never looking us   Unfortunately hadn't eaten all day decided finally try Bachi spurred seeing Triple D Food Network   only 4 30 afternoon tables weren't even full   saw others sitting around various stages being served some empty glasses water some drinks but all still menus same look table did   what heck?  The menu looked good but service important   just many choices Las Vegas ignored were  <EOR> Great burgers  Sometimes wait long but well worth it  recently visited location quite sometime expanded restaurant space  Try spicy miso burger! <EOR> I'd actually give 3 5 stars  When Yelp going start allowing half points?  Bachi Burger good food  overwhelmingly superb  However combination different flavors nice palate   I've tried sampling menu loaded fries ramen soup burgers overall review is    Everything bit heavy salty side  Bacon jam going salty it  Use cumin would better salt though  oxtail meat super tender however think cook much salt   Let's point vegetarians  They're really going Bachi Burger aren't lot vegetarian options    Especially if don't want soup  More variety would help bring more clientele   I'll back  really oxtail fries  <EOR> The food fine but service joke   When pay $15 burger shouldn't pay extra change kind cheese it   And   when order your fries la carte $4   you shouldn't pay extra ketchup   leaving ask whether would charged extra box take rest burger go    <EOR> The service Bachi ATROCIOUS but food unbelievable made it   waited forever seated even though loads open clean tables   server took ages take order then only other time saw when she dropped off check someone else dropped off food    My boyfriend banh mi burger Wagyu beef burger foie gras I forget named burgers absolutely unbelievable juicy tender full amazing flavors   boyfriend garlic chili fries which fantastic   truffle parmesan fries because everyone yelp raved them but fries didn't taste truffle parmesan   tasted regular mediocre french fries sure if screwed fries if everyone else doesn't love truffle do     I worked hostess server years know restaurant operates   Bachi clearly doesn't   looks someone amazing palate decided open restaurant but no idea run now they're busy they're swamped don't know do   Having said those burgers probably best ever totally worth crap service   definitely going back which says lot because usually NEVER return place awful service!   <EOR> All say wish Bachi Burger where live   food fabulous!  Very creative tasty   Highly recommended! <EOR> One best burger restaurants ever! couldn't finish burger but good! truffle fries oxtail fries good! server Dan best!!! must try! <EOR> I NEVER return Bachi Burger ever again  unfortunately because service  asked if Banh Mi sandwich choice between beef pork shrimp server said yes  said take shrimp banh mi burger then followed no pork pate   arrived ground meat thought okay  weird  ground shrimp?   took few bites realized tasted mixture included pork  grabbed server asked she said all mixed together  time ordered food shouldn't she corrected when asked shrimp banh mi sandwich? tried something else but server said well we'll charge new item   Excuse me? grew restaurant hospitality industry NEVER answer  wasn't cost but fact she didn't seem care  few minutes later she came said oh offering complimentary dessert moms mother's day  Would care dessert?   Um no would love some lunch before dessert please  am appalled allowed walk restaurant knowing very unhappy still hungry   Really bad move part perhaps restaurant manager should stepped in  should just eaten cost new burger customer happy  would resulted repeat business would more made $8 burger  <EOR> *drools*  Absolutely loved place! Came once while Vegas glad came here  staying strip but rental car drove here   I ordered black green burger salt pepper garlic fries momotaro soda   The burger Absolutely delicious very very filing  patty pretty thick lot flavor it  made really filling mushroom bacon blue cheese  When throw all really great burger but sure try while empty stomach!  Fries fries very good  Crispy right amount flavourings  However sure share because portion meant shared   Momotaro soda First time tried peach strawberry soda  tasted lot peach but lot strawberry but complaining   Price value burgers they're pretty expensive first glance but once factor stuff put sense quality ingredients high complaining  <EOR> sub par service above average food    no sweeteners offered iced tea   had ask napkins  server more interested sidework taking smoke break plan sight attend table   food timing off salad delivered before burgers   next time order to go  <EOR> This place never disappoints  food always amazing service good  burgers raman can't wrong  <EOR> Hit miss here  Burgers pretty fantastic but service sub par  just order takers don't guide through menu figure your own  Kikis burger but undercooked time around  Waited bar 15 minutes before server came by  If food wasn't good would walked out  Again! <EOR> Came LA visit friends Bachi Burger lunch  gotta say burgers juicy delicious! highly recommend place anyone  craving awesome burger  Miyagi San burger  If you'd egg your burger then gotta give try  oxtail chili cheese fries great burger well  service great great staff   can't wait back next time Vegas  <EOR> ATTENTION!

Sux first time  super bummer  top off  There's print direct Southern  Nevada health district posted right above trash bin stating employees must wash hands using restroom    ugh  ok this  <EOR> Went Bachi Burger other night group 4  frequented restaurant before would give 3 4 stars those visit  visit different following reasons 1  put waiting list phone number hostess could call us  returned check spot hostess said she just called party  hostess before did communicate using phone numbers  must shift change   big deal itself  good timing did lose spot   2  Server did introduce himself very cold lacked any personality genuine concern  While service terrible definitely lacking    3  going split 4 burgers  requested burgers cut quarters could easily  server told could bring steak knives but wont serve cut  asked another server she said same thing   4  decided less burger since able burgers cut share  decided would much project try table steak knives  Two people party going split burger other two would own   5  asked if possible burger being shared cut half  plain Jane burger sure kitchen could handle this  resulted female staff member assume manager visiting table explain did want cut burger because would change presentation the cook wants presentation way kitchen really busy order expedite cooking process would prefer cut burger   bit insult anyone worked culinary world mention paying guest   6  manager took uncompromising position did let know this  server hawked over table remainder visit most likely try regain any lost tip we still tipped 20%     In summary food good but plenty burger joints Las Vegas area many which visit more frequently place Bachi Burger  pricey well comparison more established burger joints   The customer service aspect arrogant manner which manager handled simple request drove down experience most  sister reminded visit she previously come chef refused add lettuce burger because would change taste profile food    Advice chef despite your enthusiasm want want comes second GUEST wants  guest paying product well experience  Without GUESTS job   Advice manager supervisor If want help business grow well add your professional success much easier road granting special request rather insulting your patrons intelligence discussing logistics burger kitchen  time took give your enthusiastic lecture expediting product kitchen might able cut 20 30 burgers maybe even grant simple request above beyond your current set service standards  Instead ordered less burger visit skipped desert probably wont back  YOUR JOB ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST BRAND LOYALTY  GUEST ALWAYS RIGHT  WITHOUT THEM WOULD JOB  <EOR> Overrated overpriced  utensils dirty glass smelled ox fries tasteless  Waiting seated 15 minutes several empty tables available  <EOR> Had find old yelp account just write review because felt discriminated   My friends town wanted try place diced meet dinner   wife arrived early usual dinner

host restaurant night WHITE guy So 15minutes later WHITE friend arrived he asked table 4 immediately any questions confirmation if he full party him   While wife still car   I complained server all she did trying excuses happened never said sorry any sincere manner   I extremely upset said going post yelp review she said ahead   Normally would asked manager but friends didn't want ruin night everyone since first time Bachi Burger  already spend 20 minutes complaining server   Me wife never eat place ever again  <EOR> The only reason 2 stars because gave them star due look place   spent

Really star Restaurant off strip scene las vegas! <EOR> Let start off saying would give more stars if service wasn't lacking much  first arrived front area packed  10 15 minute wait  nowhere stand sit inside waited outside  man told he would come when table ready  No came husband check see much longer wait just happened calling name they said going come don't know why calling name   front area definitely needs managed better set differently  seems way small   The server nice but she seemed she overly busy  She wasn't very attentive all  mind seemed elsewhere  ordered drinks took while them back us  husband annoyed because beer wasn't cold glasses weren't frosted when she told were   glasses shot glasses  never seen beer glass small  new thing? Maybe loop lol    The food good but nothing amazed by  ordered side fries son loved pineapple ketchup came with  yummy  also started off oxtail chili fries  husband really enjoyed them much  spicy because jalapeños also wondering where oxtail meat was? also barely any beans  fries bit overcooked liking  Some them way crunchy  Also when fries first arrived table egg already broken   no fun!   For entrees split Peking Duck Steamed buns Ronin burger  duck buns very good hoisin sauce  buns steamed perfectly fried egg mimicked cheese  definitely delicious  I'd try pork belly buns  biggest disappointment night Ronin burger  would extremely satisfied if cooked medium requested  burger came well done  cooked angus beef way much  don't sending food back just ate is  However did let waitress know overcooked it  flavors burger delicious though  If cooked medium then would great  cole slaw fried egg onions aioli great taste  bun also grilled bit much    The decor cool but big eyesore front deck restaurant  pile old cooking equipment outside which look really unprofessional  end meal felt being rushed waitress  husband wasn't even finished beer waitress came over asking if needed credit card settled  hadn't even gave credit card don't know why she thought that  mind definitely lost  Overall place good but potential better if fix few things  <EOR> Meh worth hype   It made sick last time but gave another try didn't win over  <EOR> This Place casual dining  usually always packed 'cause its GOOD even Tuesday night  Everything awesome food service cleanliness  <EOR> Honestly best burger ever had!!

Case point ordered Ronin burger instead Kiki burger  Should've no brainer because Kiki garlic Ronin didn't  ARGH! oh well      So someone said Diners Drive Ins Dives didn't believe them because neither dive nor tiny hell  average sized burger joint  quite Red Robin but smaller Smashburger Five Guys  well prices   they're average gourmet burger place $9 $10 unless Shogun    DUCK STEAMED BUNS So pretty decent  They're served steamed buns but folded into small taco steamed bun size drink coaster   Flavor sort sweet soy teriyaki kind flavor but seasoning pretty good    RONIN BURGER It's Miso dressing Katsu BBQ fried egg amongst some others  know why know drunk? would never order burger Miso anything! miso but outside Japanese food especially burger   Luckily miso hard taste fried egg don't understand novelty is  Among very light almost hard find flavors patty seasoned enough giving very lackluster performance  flavors enough taste they're absent but enough really notice  did small sweet salty persuasion but again nothing worth mentioning   SHOGUN BURGER Whenever try new joint especially if hyped assume never come back  sure order much menu possible  guy eyeing whole time  $25 burger! feeling very generous drunk it's Vegas! ordered table  split into 8ths gave piece everyone  Most thought wasn't much better but thought definitely better Ronin   It's just beef Wagyu Beef! top there's Unagi Foie Gras! also peach miso butter can't escape miso tonight guess Vegas?    beef noticeably more tender flavors seasoning better  Now don't think actually any unagi bite little disappointed yet thought fishy eel next beef little worrisome  sweetness times comes little unagi sauce which worked ok  certainly improvements burger over Ronin but $15's worth!  BADCHI BURGER Ok friends all picked because only thought Bachi less orgasmic  don't know maybe all gourmet burger but feel lately everyone's worried toppings keep forgetting beef  Sure Angus sure Waygyu but doesn't mean don't season cook properly! patty isn't just filler protein main event!   So if you've never fine quell your curiosity  Otherwise just In n Out   Everyone's tastes different here're some references not any order NOT FAN Fatburger Five Guys Tom Eddies Kuma's Corner FAN In n Out Paradise Pup Smashburger <EOR> This place blew freakin' mind  Los Angeles where niche burger spots literally every street corner but place absolutely incredible  spicy miso burger revelation pepper garlic fries unlike anything ever tasted! definitely stop every Vegas trip out  <EOR> I ordered lychee boba excited   came without boba straw  asked boba straw  ran out  hell?  Aside 8 million year wait food bad    but didn't sit well or stay in stomach severe case indigestion threw bit lunch   Maybe pickled garlic pickles ordered? sure but feel very weary coming back place  ordered banh mi burger  Could undercooked pork? never really know  <EOR> Ehhh place good but prefer Sahara Fort Apache location  such small place  <EOR> Bachi Burger amazing  where ate BEST burger life  wish franchise cause would totally invest every penny into bring NY  Myagi san burger changed life never look burger same way again  burger all other burgers judged against   I Bachi Burger twice during stay Vegas  first time food EXCELLENT  ordered Myagi san burger truffle parm fries kiki burger red velvet milkshake go  Everything amazing  5  star food experience   The second time Ronin burger pork belly buns oxtail fries portuguese donuts  Everything decent time around but outstanding first time there  Ronin burger good but felt lacked bit flavor  pork belly buns different but thought only yummy when smothered sauce came with  Oxtail fries reminded just regular chilli cheese fries    the oxtail part did really shine through flavor wise Yelpers hyped much kind disappointed when tasted it    go uninfluenced mind maybe enjoy them more did   thought Portuguese donuts bit dense would preferred them served plate instead paper cone     sugar everywhere  But very minor details  Over all second time around would still rate food experience 4 stars  <EOR> More 2 5 stars because food actually pretty good just some other problems dining experiences here   The good Kiki's burgers all around 3 very flavorful  loved burgers nice charred crisp outside but still fairly juicy inside  toppings all worked together very well mushrooms Gruyere cheese bacon  nice left garlic chili aioli side spread your burger please  Also salt pepper fries along sweet potato fries share  favorite salt pepper mixed some ginger cilantro chili peppers  sauce also complemented very nicely  sweet potato fries cooked nicely but sauce good  Yuzu citrus aioli strange herb taste couldn't place  But best part probably drinks  strawberry jasmine lemonade tasty! fresh strawberry puree real strawberry bits  also Momotaro which good but see being sweet finish entire glass  Oh comes really large glass worth $4   The bad two times bf come mixed burger another person's party  He likes burgers cooked medium well but both times under cooked realized because servers don't indicator each burger's doneness  while servers remembered each person ordered didn't know which burger which   The ugly eating few bites bf noticed way underdone  he brought waiter's attention  took away burger when waiter returned literally exact same burger he originally only cooked again  means put patty he taken bites back grill rather cooking brand new should have  COMPLETELY unsanitary!   I'm sorry but restaurant return already eaten food onto grill acceptable  although food good knows else  exactly kosher  <EOR> Wow JUST WOW knew heaven just few files strip LV   A stop always Vegas   it's just good  just 2 days post wanted again tried hit before left sweet town LV but damned all closed Sundays DRAT     Let's take walkthrough I'd very detailed whole experience    1  Walk little worried b c even good reviews seen yelp wasn't busy also few customers did see didn't order burgers but sandwiches   2  Sit Down  nice looking decor just arriving LV starving anything seemed good but didn't know into  order some waters them fast because wasn't busy considering around 3 PM order fries sweet potato truffle oil garlic fries  come first   3  fries  Garlic fries first tasted each basket fries come nice decor although 4 $ each approximately little more handful you'd expect more but really perfect amount need  Again well garlic fries great good taste little kick spice would think jalapeno  really awesome! Second tried Sweet Potato fries which cooked greatest form   the texture crispness fries really good  Then tried truffle oil fries themselves thought alright but when add them sauce chutney arranged each basket definitely does disappoint  4  Burger Oh goodness    the burger   it just amazing   I ordered Kalbi burger actually reluctant b c waitress didn't really acknowledge good choice   or even ask liked burger cooked I ususally medium rare medium but didn't matter   it just didn't   it just good  burger perfect bun wasn't soggy anything held true form devoured burger first bite last  patty! Man if you've Korean BBQ Kalbi then know  already money but marinade patty! GOOD!!!! also thin layer Kim Chee served side pickled cucumber ouee kimchi think spelled wish could describe better more burger   but just totally just hypnotized taste   5  Service know wasn't crowded but service amazing seemed everytime sipped water someone would fill full right put down  staff nice give warm greeting happy good bye b c think they're glad see satisfied customers most definitely them    This longest post ever written even posting FB just spread word place    <EOR> I come 2 different times tried jam both groups into smaller amount tables  1 more table would great  First time group 15 adults 2nd time 6 adults 1 high chair  tried calling ahead give them warning both times dont take reservations  wait wasnt bad time  Food amazing  <EOR> Delicious burgers  Delightful atmosphere  good stop Vegas! <EOR> Being strip mall didn't place easy find  Google facing street but entrance opposite side  lunch crowd full force when there  seated table four  don't allow eating bar! felt guilty taking all space when people waiting seated  sat facing them  Screw 'um  any rate ordered Japanese beer never heard of  forgot name but came 17oz bottle  Very good beer sorta hoppy between ale IPA  Then Spicy Miso burger  Wasn't spicy all  Maybe missed something  But cooked perfectly med miso taste just right  comes egg prepare some messy eating  didn't any frys stuff but sure it'll just good burger  Next going try Hotdog  guy next he said great  There's Ramen place next door  actually order Ramen too! Ramen place wasn't nearly crowded Bachi wonder if order burger Ramen place  place beats BurgR B B opinion  <EOR> The experience eating Bachi Burger evidently experienced when actually *eating* food which wonderful fusion Asian American influences no small amount creativity part chefs  Admittedly some dishes fusion seem tad hamfisted trust almost any dish promise reasonably satisfying novelty taste experience   However severe downside Bachi Burger physical establishment itself  God awful repulsive marketing focus group chosen music played ear splittingly abhorrent volumes sure prevent speaking any fellow patron more half feet away  Sitting down eating Bacchi Burger contest between your impulse enjoy your admittedly excellent tasting meal slowly your other impulse escape ASAP  gruff oftentimes unhelpful waiters waitresses greatest ease inform seating area closed for no apparent reason greatest displeasure give time day god forbid return polite smile   The best way enjoy Bachi Burger mercifully spare yourself trip order via UberEats which all things considered godsend all this  <EOR> I'm torn Bachi  Maybe 3 5? Their idea cool some neat combinations but execution lacking some areas    The wait wasn't really issue large party 8 just needed setup bit  While waiting scoped menu bit see offered   The baos looked interesting but would much  party shared ox tail chili cheese fries pretty tasty  would more ox tail but good   I Miyagi san burger medium rare which grass fed wagyu fried egg bacon furikake onion strings  sauce chili mayo  Also side sea salt fries  Presentation awesome  burger looked great toppings stacked nicely  Good char beef   Taste just okay  Good flavors ingredients but think flavor meat kind lacking  Maybe sweet something but expecting more savory taste beef  Beef letdown bit flavorless side  might stick Angus next time taste another burger seemed more flavorful   I think kind made everything let down service  When going pho restaurant expect no service  But when you're serving gourmet burgers foie gras would hope would something better see pho joint   The servers just seemed tad surly  No smiles seems bit attitude  Kinda just going through motions ask help  even nice way  just pass down? no please? no thanks?  I understand if booth server can't some people  She just lazy started giving appetizer plates asked send them down  Same water  Plopped them down end table again asked pass them down  surprised wasn't asked pass food down well  they're able give food everyone individually but water plates much trouble  Towards end meal some people still eating start clearing table right people finish plates  rushed feeling want kick out  fries shared still half full she started take them away  She only asked if wanted continue eat them kinda looked taking fries away  Why quick everything away? wasn't line waiting  eating lunch 2PM  No wait restaurant half empty  Oh true fashion she also asked pass plates over she wouldn't walk around each setting pick plates   Like said bit torn  think potential but pretty eh first experience  gotta step game  <EOR> I've gone many times every time experience always great  When comes down being greeted seated ever served  always pleasant time    The environment vibe classy also modern  When comes food great presentation when served plus delicious  ordered medium rare Ronin Burger made just right   I would recommend Restuarant if want well unique kind type burger Las Vegas  <EOR> Their burgers very good imitable  Waygu beef different toppings place kind blows competition water  <EOR> Tried Bachi Burger first time impressed!! ordered black green burger  patty fit bun perfectly bun soft held together  service phenomenal well  Great atmosphere! would definitely recommend place  <EOR> This review long overdue  All remember business lunch colleague burger amazing  <EOR> So place amuses me  Why? Because burgers outstanding  mean outstanding  There's good chance you'll come eat burger decide best burgers you've ever had  Among your top 10 even top 5  feel burgers  Everything else menu? Craptastic  mean just garbage  coffee taste water cocktail barely liquor dessert some supermarket bought concoction just on  just don't order anything else but burger  <EOR> Had Miyagi san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger very tasty Nothing beats egg onion rings burger! truffle fries also tried Garlic Aoil red velvet shake really good  Lots other great burger options! <EOR> I found restaurant Yelp trip Vegas   reviews mouth watering!  couldn't wait there!

Upon entering 4 45 pm no host several minutes  entire staff seemed very confused  uncoordinated   When host finally showed told would few minutes despite being several open tables sight  being seated sat 10 minutes no even making eye contact us  finally physically flagged waiter down asked menus  He replied yeah ? when asked menu he gave them walked away  No apology no anything  another 15 minutes being completely ignored left  When left waiting area packed very unhappy looking people waiting seated still lots tables available but no getting served   10 minutes down road fantastic dinner excellent service tapas restaurant  way birthday dinner  chosen Bachi burger b c heard such great things  disappointment  returning  Thanks nothing Bachi burger   together! <EOR> So use favorite burger spots but am disappointed experience tonight! First all energy level servers very low  MANAGEMENT take care your people they'll take care your patrons  Everyone looked overworked under cared for  Speaking being taken care restaurant looks ran down  All tables chipped kept stable placing napkins under feet  There's huge hole bottom booth seats  But really cooks kitchen playing music louder intercom music  only music loud but inappropriate rap music cursing lot use N word  children business know if offended pretty sure parents too  person enjoys rap music much next person but utterly appalled hearing while dining your establishment  top off burger lacked flavor  all need some serious customer service training! <EOR> Pretentious  Kinda sums experience there  just happened upon Bachi burgers driving down Windmill Lane   staff friendly but gave off arrogant vibe your lucky    Beer btw $7 per small glass  2 beers 2 people set back $28 !!! feel special don't mind raping customer wallets  burgers good but $30 good two burgers    Next time just hit Smash Burgers  <EOR> The food amazing! Love it  plus side location ramen! But service end slower bc busy <EOR> These Asian fusion burgers amazing unique! tried banh mi burger ronin burger turkey chicken burger  All delicious! only downside burger buns tend soggy quick because meat juicy  food also takes awhile come out   I understand fast food but seems take lot longer should  parmesan truffle fries good can't away ordering them even though keep telling myself need try some other fries salt pepper sweet potato   If none specialty burgers your liking your own custom burger variety options toppings  kobe beef too!  They also extensive drink menu home made sodas even Thai iced tea D I'd recommend trying apple lychee soda   so refreshing! alkies also wine sake menu! <EOR> I haven't reviewed place yet but think high time stop procrastinating it   This place just amazing  Great burgers great ramen great dessert  first try spicy miso burger wonderful  going through trying bit everything since  wish could eat every day good   The atmosphere very modern dark tons tables close together  pretty loud crowded but worth it  desserts sinfully good bad  donuts cheat day!

Then he tells he going break someone else covering table  Right  Food comes couple minutes later  grilled cheese okay but totally worth $7  Matt Ronin burger which he thought alright well but didn't some mix flavors  same waiter guess didn't break comes asks if want dessert which say no then asks if want check hands us    We walk counter pay hand girl say am going paying cash  SHE WALKS OFF  SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF NO EXPLANATION FOOD COUNTER  KIDDING ME?! waiter comes minute later mouth agape pay there    I said previous review Macaroni Grill worst service ever but takes cake  would rather exclusively eat Macaroni Grill rest life return Bachi Burger  All all took over HOUR other places would quick 30 40 minute lunch  No knows hell doing also seem don't care either  food alright but enough ever come back kind service lack thereof  Jesus Tap dancing Christ cracker if hold your sanity dear your heart place because service absolutely appalling refuse return establishment because it  <EOR> I'm back home Cali already want back Vegas just eat again!  saw Ox Tail Fries Diners Drive Ins Dives craved bad   really good   fried egg top just made even better   ox tail meat savory soft melt your mouth   tried Ronin Burger which most popular but didn't really it   much carmelized onions which usually love but made burger sweet   husband Miyagi san's Wagyu Burger awesome!!  ate half burger   really savory just good   wanted try Boba drinks but full after   can't wait back again! <EOR> This place most amazing place earth  sure apart every trip take Vegas  refreshing into restaurant see variety folx  Often places super good particular clientele but place all genres  plantation sweet tea w pineapple mint most flavorful beverage tried duplicate home same  best thing oxtail fries  Spicey sweet yummy tummy fries w egg oxtail doesn't want that  terms meal non ground beef items bcus feel some sort way abt but first time came pork belly buns nice surprise  pork crispy actually mixture varieties crunch softness  However time  Lonely Bird which perfect  thing seriously nice bun all flavors jus taste nice mouth  Anyways friends Banh Mi Mr Ho's which course delissshhhh  advice strip eat explore but clearly if your reading review  <EOR> Stopped Boy try something different partaking afternoon filled civic action   Upon walking into BB greeted seated  checking menu settled Miyagi san Grass Feed Waygu Burger which consisted following     Chili Mao Fried Egg Furikake Caramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings  This accompanied appetizer would substitute side fries would order  consisted Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries   made with     Fries Cheese Chili Garlic Aioli and Fried Egg   After having ordered   I noticed board posting daily specials   I sad brought attention prior ordering   The Boy drank Root Beer very delicious Plantation Sweet Tea   After consuming above items found them OK worth hating truly loving   The service awesome think must seen least five different faces checked see things going     The real ball buster check  Granted some trendy joke joint strip Windmill Bermuda Christ sake's  but total why basically two burgers fries w toppings two drinks $51 89 without tip   I digress also Peanut Butter Chocolate shack too  $51 89! <EOR> Awesome! Even better now serving ramen! choose night drinking??? Ramen burger??? Both?! Yup did both  <EOR> This first time Bachi Burger definitely back  work evenings time off most places closed extremely happy found another late night place enjoy dinner at   The Miyagi San burger amazing  Hands down best burger ever had  also ordered side fries pineapple ketchup which good well  portions great filling   On top service management wonderful   Can't wait next experience here  <EOR> The food good but service totally sucked   I'd rather Holsteins Cosmopolitan but  just preference   Oh well can't win'em all! <EOR> Ok when heard place buddy Jon D least check out   would agree 100% perfectly 4 stars   quite 5 stars needs better desserts   table 11 people tried all desserts would say custom pop tarts far best   Portuguese Doughnuts quite overdone very hard worst yet oily greasy     But lets concentrate positive shall we?  Well service once past long wait   case table 11 people told would 1 20 minutes wait   Any reckoning drastically underestimated time since Black Friday many people there   But very lucky party 6 people decided just bail take off pleasantly surprised short wait time only 1 10 minutes    As food say pretty ok    Nothing stuck awesome nothing completely Fail either   ordered most things menu   Kalbi burger Mr  Ho's Peking duck bao pork belly bao   All all good list choices available eat   Fries pretty good   Drinks also good    Now sour point   Well take star away service bit leisurely side   could take them 20 minutes before would come back something asked for   happened several times no napkins also quite some time refill drinks   Now say perhaps more short sighted manager duty probably didn't expect Black Friday would busy?  But think understaffed night     Otherwise can't wait LA branch open bit   just Sawtelle area LA over President's weekend saw sign coming soon   rather bitter sweet took over small Mom N Pop grocery store   But alas progress marching on  <EOR> The crab burger must ahh good filling  Also chili wings die for!! Oh chili fries oh man oh man good nice kick them  milkshakes all good too  Nice atmosphere good serves over all good place dine in  <EOR> I've never before burger fries excuse myself table bathroom clean myself off foodgasm  <EOR> Probably best burger ever entire life  Steam pork buns excellent  Truffle fries legit  <EOR> It good  lot  Just ate ronin burger parm truffle fries side  Soothes your deep inner yearnings  Stomach smiling  <EOR> I would love give bachi 5 stars     However lack good manager  There's constantly issues could simple fix yet never happens  Over last year three different managers seen unfortunately all lack being able run restaurant  If owned bachi I'd very disturbed ran  now newly remodeled bar took least 30% seating room    doesn't serve food    some things place may never sense  But hey decent burger! <EOR> Bachi Burger favorite burger spots Vegas due fact completely different most places  several times still haven't disappointed  <EOR> I never hear place but close hotel LV good Yelp rating  Apparently featured cable food show  wife stopped Sunday evening around 6  When arrived seating available but shortly being seated place filled line door  ordered Bachi Pickles found them delightful  wife BBQ Bachi Angus burger ordered Ronin Burger  split order Sweet Potato fries fixed Parmesan Truffle style The food served appropriate amount time hot delicious  portions quite large but food good stuffed ourselves    Our server friendly competent knowledgeable  Although restaurant full families kids noise level overly loud  able carry conversation without straining hear each other  very happy fun experience plan return when Vegas again  Highly recommended  <EOR> Great fusion burgers service ok  didnt expect burgers which completely american  some asian flavors MIso Umami Sauce cheese Kimchi into burgers would good french fries also some twist garlic parmesan  ox tail chili fries good twist  <EOR> When first discovered place several years back new unknown typically empty completely wonderful  Now due darn mystery social media everyone knows wait even if arrive during off hours but    still wonderful!

The service appropriately attentive but didn't rush when lingered catching friend  Prices bit high regular burger stop but Bachi isn't putting regular burgers anyway  <EOR> I'm pretty sure place owned someone Hawaii   Anyway ate dinner last night   ordered Ronin Burger  Awesome!

We expecting wait tonight case last time around but seated right away  Maybe cuz nascar weekend  ? Servers friendly attentive always refilled drinks before asking    We looking forward next visit ordering spicy miso again trying new burger next time around <EOR> I visiting Vegas decided some Ramen  Apparently Ramen restaurant next Bachi Burger merged into Bachi Burger  wanted Ramen but menu very limited no non pork base   decided try burgers  Wow!  find! Best burger place! Cooked perfectly fresh delicious  Service excellent  definitely again  <EOR> Amazingly amazing burger honestly would put Bachi best burger Vegas   Creative menu full flavor best part   CONSISTENT  <EOR> A buddy seen Bachi featured some Food Network tv show  Since easy sell pretty much sucker advertising endorsement enough search place   As soon saw Shogun burger chalkboard outside knew idiot it  I'm particularly susceptible chalkboard marketing should add  shogun specialty wagyu beef burgers layer unagi pan seared foie gras sold thin slices asian pear miso butter spread  side throw yamamomo peach  sure why but maybe helps theoretically justify $25 price tag     Before burgers gotta say milkshakes all them awesome  Creamy thick diabetes inducing  liked strawberry guava but everyone else thought peanut butter tops    The much talked ox tail fries surprise  ox tail stew covering french fries actually little sweet tasted great  thought would just chili cheese fries using ox tail but different flavor anticipated   stop ourselves ordering seconds wouldn't ruin appetites    Okay main event  bought biggest baddest burger off regular menu  Did love it? Honestly price found okay  beef use burger tasted good when bite into burger don't watch sauces ketchup take away lovely flavor cow carcass  unagi least favorite part because its flavor really overpowered everything else except sweetness pear made every bite just taste unagi  minus unagi left good beef patty pear foie gras  all tasted pretty good but wouldn't recommend $25   I also tried Ronin burger which little sweetness layer coleslaw really enjoyed overall  Next time try pork steamed buns some other burgers well  Maybe Shogun didn't live expectations but still great meal back next time Vegas   Oh yamamomo peach? Popped mouth it's size marble looked back everyone else watching reaction  shrugged Tastes candy  <EOR> Came due recommendations cousins raved being best place burger Vegas  way back home drove place give try   right opened no line deal with   A friendly enthusiastic staff member greeted sat down  He asked if ever Bachi Burger when said no he did quick introduction some more popular items menu   There three following Truffle Parmesan Fries $5 50 which included  Parmesan Reggiano black truffle cream sun dried tomato aioli side  thought decent  didn't really taste truffle flavor much hoped preferred fries bit crispier   would probably pass getting next time   BBQ Bachi Burger $13 00 8 oz Grass Fed Wagyu lettuce tomato onion  burger if want simple juicy flavorful burger where let bun meat shine  friend enjoyed thoroughly didn't see need extra toppings sauces    Black Green Burger $14 00 American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef sautéed mushrooms spinach bacon Point Reyes blue cheese roasted garlic No doubt flavorful burger just reading ingredients salivate   friend liked burger combination flavors  He said he would again   Shogun burger $26 00 Wagyu Beef unagi pan seared foie gras poached Asian pear miso butter Yamamomo Peach palette cleanser  ultimate flavorful tasty burger ever tasted  Over indulgent perhaps   However flavors surprisingly work well together   Granted search foie gras coming California which now banned delectable item no brainer chose burger when saw menu   It very rich tasty burger slightly oily but given  foie gras pan seared soft melted slightly over beef lot texture going poached pear    Our waiter came check food delivered told should Yamamomo Peach before eat burger palette cleanser prepare your tastebuds all flavors before bit into burger  Just remember small pit marinated peach   I see Shogun burger everyone but enjoyed every bite burger   menu if fairly extensive little bit something everyone    Our server mentioned plan open Bachi Burger near UCLA soon another place called Healthy Life Kitchen   Why 4 5 stars? Well bit disappointed truffle fries    Service fine  Parking plentiful  Prices higher but suppose pay for    I would definitely come again if ever Vegas     p s  tempted oxtail chili fries but companions less adventurous  Darn! <EOR> Amazing burgers!  love place!  recommended several friends came family possibly best local burger joints town   mention homemade sodas   Mmmmm!

Bachi Burger fell short that  <EOR> This first time Las Vegas heard good things Bachi Burger relatives decided spend birthday dinner here  honestly should somewhere else amount money spent  showed around 8 30pm place reasonably busy  placed order around 8 45pm burgers fries   burgers came little over hour later  only did wait unreasonable amount time burgers burger cooked requested therefor wait longer  Also fries did come until 20 minutes received burgers cold top that! Sadly experience Bachi Burger tonight returning nor recommending place anyone  <EOR> Dined friday night wait wasn't long  vegetarian disappointed only option No Meat Here    Burger but looked pretty good gave along side fries  When burger came verryyy high felt way overwhelmed eat it  But starving cut half which think if decide order burger just ask them much cleaner just first bite hooked! nervous mushroom patty eggplant tofu would much but exact opposite  Every item burger perfect compliment loved it!

Split burgers could taste everything 4  Don't come large group expect immediate seating 5  Ask server any question  don't bite  <EOR> I Recommend Pork buns! Kimchi burger! beers wine!   I Con wasn't very fond Duck buns Bahn mi burger because flavors didn't work me  feel duck needs cooked perfectly else strong flavor lingers unwelcoming way  Bahn mi burger didn't taste anything bahn mi didn't represent Vietnamese cuisine well   Overall burger joint must eat Vegas! <EOR> Best burger joint ever!

Must food coma yummy food   perhaps beers followed food    oh well   So stopped Bachi Burger some friends party 5 sometime middle August  worried previous reviews service  But no problems  server awesome! 9 30p place half full  wish remembered name server he seemed happy passionate job! gave recommendations whatnot   So started off truffle fries Kiki Burger BF Ronin friends ronin kiki traditional burger  bf some kind lemonade thing can't remember but good!  Fries came pretty quick gone less minute! yummy stuff  burgers did take quite while  But server did come check least weren't ignored  sucked burgers didn't all come together  some started grubbing before others cause starving didn't want food cold!

Burgers made order choose among expertly crafted selection gourmet options  miyagi if can't tell poison choice goodness gracious worth it  Truffle fries reign top game sit alongside many different french fries options  But keep mind don't come your order unless requested  request it    Also speaking miyagi did mention ramen? Noodle house burger joint  Super random concept brilliant execution    Portions pretty generous before think tackle American Asian food breed easily  maybe should reconsider back down  Pricing pleasantly reasonable gourmet burgers definitely won't break bank order stuff yourself    Wax wax off Bachi Burger keep fighting good tastes  <EOR> Amazing burgers   quality ingredients comes together very good burger  Oxtail fries very good too  <EOR> So day's goal going Bachi Burger came conclusion visiting third location  first closed due pest infestation  second closed no notice door  third open close proximity strip   Although review particular location hard let unexpected setbacks disappointment two prior locations spill into review third location  However Bachi Burger far perfect  Service terrible  seated immediately mainly because empty someone helping kitchen  could tell because she putting together dish wearing latex gloves when she noticed coming front door   We ordered spicy miso burger kalbi burger  sounded appealing menu but fact menu printed formatted Microsoft Word document red flag  burgers came shortly ordered  artisanal burgers but lacked balance flavor  spicy miso burger came swiss cheese which substituted gruyere cheese  However charged if swiss gruyere cheese burger  miso flavor little funky resembling old miso soup  burger bun ratio off causing bottom bun completely soaked fall apart halfway through consumption  kalbi burger good flavor but again bun problem  addition fried egg came burger cooked over hard completely eliminating allure runny yolk juicy burger   Lastly most frustrating part took three times long server collect check credit cards did them take orders deliver food  Looking over servers just shooting shit clowning around instead looking raised arm collect bill could way   Bonus negative experience Christmas decor reminiscent lazy elementary school teacher's bulletin board no functioning lock men's restroom door  <EOR> This second time honestly very impressed  felt disappointment stemmed high expectations food expected   I heard place many foodie friends rave oxtail fries burgers  few years back tried other gourmet fries which oxtail fries utterly delicious me  upon returning determined try fries  Being Jamaican grew eating amazing oxtail actually two favorite foods fries being other one  came back ordered dish miyagi burger  fries served huge portion split 3 4 people  When tried didn't even recognize oxtail tasted chili  really didn't meet hype heard it  burger other hand really good but felt gourmet burgers before whatever me  just really impressed caliber taste dishes    In terms service waiter helpful did wait long table  felt weren't attentive especially when looking checks  restaurant very modern clean look it  put separate room because big party us  felt very separate everyone else don't think good feel entire restaurant  But perspective lot people yet cramped all    All all want give place another chance  time such high expectations see if find fries enjoyed before  <EOR> I recently visited Bachi Burger  Oxtail Chili Fries first time OMFG!

Must eat if Vegas!! <EOR> So recently completed 2nd trip Bachi time ever popular Gordon H while restaurant didn't change much turns opinion did  When originally sat down write update thought overall impression changed first review but writing things developed little differently    Food time  Cheesy whatever call grilled cheese  sounded awesome menu but practice maybe so so  pretty good amount cheese made well enough but just wasn't very tasty  Without veggie burger menu pretty much only meat less entree choice definitely couldn't bring vegetarian here  Gordon Kikis initial wave much garlic found enjoyable    Service service better Yelp might lead think  Adorable Waitress serving many tables which probably good choice Bachi overall but definitely far concerned  Consequently Generic Asian Waitress  service rendered adequately but only adequately totally devoid any charm  Say want flaws precious Adorable Waitress but take more flawed service comes some personality over technically superior but totally bland serving automaton  Especially small independent restaurant  Which brings to New conclusion Bachi totally needs game  Yes burgers fries pretty damn good  Yes food unique  But decor generic effectively identical numerous Asian restaurants town service simply horrible presentable but lifeless prices aren't exactly cheap  already find myself bored menu 2 visits really isn't anything else place attractive  reason prefer independent establishments FEEL SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  Something other faceless ownership bland environs Chain Food Hell  when indie place falters aspects cheap prices awesome service bolster them  But Bachi lacks nearly all positive traits small business  Personality? None  Bargains? Zero  Service? Conspicuously lame  leaves food  while admittedly good Bachi *that* good   PRO TIP Another establishment  MANAGEMENT Take page your competition PERSONABLE! You're brand new restaurant only gets word mouth unique concept    so why isn't owner manager greeting customers when walk sit down introducing himself concept restaurant? only does help better sell place but easier give benefit of the doubt when something wrong  <EOR> After trying other food spots Las Vegas found nothing could really flavors experienced Bachi Burger  needed update review 5 stars  Wish Burgh still dreaming Bahn mi burger!! <EOR> If love burgers you'll love Bachi  burger patties juicy flavorful  menu gives good variety burger choices cheese burger Vietnamese Bahn Mi burger  also loved Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries topped fried egg   Making mouth water just thinking it  Mmmmmmm    <EOR> Despite being adult parents forced Vegas I'm under 21 though fun   yet *wink wink*   However told them couldn't just whatever want when made them take here   I ordered Ronin Burger dad Mr  Ho's Burger mom Kiki's Burger  sister ordered red velvet milkshake also shared Truffle Parmesan Fries   As usual family patience issues but  because super hungry  believe didn't eat all day prior having burger  Anyway opportunity try everyone's burgers INCREDIBLE  Mine especially  The texture burger wonderful caramelized onions sealed deal  sister's red velvet milkshake fries also really good complements burger   I'm glad they're opening another location LA near future don't drive far Bachi Burger fix!  Note quite crowded prepared burgers little expensive but worth it! <EOR> OMG saw Bachi Burger DDD love pork belly said myself when Vegas am sure going there! Well ate LOVED! Pork Belly bahn Mi FRIGGEN STELLAR! family burgers tasted all them Fantastic Truffle Fries great too! <EOR> Bachi Burger always list places when am Vegas  around 10pm Saturday course wait never problem since food always good  Once seated server came pretty quickly nice  best part terrible service! server took 10 minutes bring strawberry lemonade table waiting over 20 25 minutes received food but never received appetizer  When mentioned server he said he would put right away  opted anymore seen many other tables came receive multiple things before received anything  server looked if he drugs very jittery he attempted show pad paper showing order saying fault  Mid way through meal ordered food sat waited over 20 minutes finally approached asking if received food  proceeded tell other server waiting to go order  he walked away saw register area find to go order sitting counter  could believe terrible service Bachi burger! food always good but felt server should never serving people food! He made mistakes every single table he helping area instead apologizing he made excuses! <EOR> Came group guys eat some burgers   atmosphere nice workers did best compensate big group following Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries garlic aioli fried egg delicious savory addicting no matter hard tried stop couldn't Spicy Miso Burger Angus beef onions shishito pepper mayo lettuce roasted garlic swiss cheese fried egg apple vinaigrette hint heat little sweetness juicy!

Ronin burger beyond delicious   Sweet potato fries fresh hot!  Brussel sprouts Asian pears memorable   K'Josh great host provided top notch service   won't disappointed  <EOR> Do your mouth favor order calamari extra green sauce  If you've ever crying tiger thai restaurant recognize some same flavors dish  restaurant uses fish sauce lot dishes which why able accomplish umami flavors sauces marinades  gem known most tourists  thankful someone showed place  definitely back  Oh yes burgers bomb ask side Miyagi Mayo burger  extra 50 cents but oh worth it! <EOR> I love urban modern feel when walk into place  entire menu posted chalkboard wall inside  quickly greeted seated host server prompt getting some drinks    The drink menu fantastic but highlight menu seeing Asian fusion inspired cuisine brought life through item descriptions    We started off Pork Belly sliders  delight  Braised pork belly pickled radish hardboiled egg  Yeah hardboiled egg   I know  thought weird first until bit into it  Then felt creaminess yolk add layer texture rest soft plushy bun delicate tenderness pork belly crunchiness radish slaw   pure bliss really    Next came chili cheese fries  let ask your chili better anyone else's? Bachi Burger tell add oxtail  couldn't agree more! Using oxtail added more depth richness flavor chili all licking bowl sop rest left    BUT highlight night Shogun burger  quite easily best burger ever enjoyed   in all land  super burger consisting of Waygu grass fed beef poached Asian pears pan seared foie gras mixed greens miso butter between toasted bun  What's ask?? Did just read foie gras burger?? Why yes yes did  All could think when eating burger Hello Bacon meet your new challenger Burger's best topping Foie Gras  Your salty crunchy smokiness may just surpassed your opponent offers salty savory buttery tenderness  The Shogun certainly raised bar burgers but low behold comes price  $25 burger but worth every bite  <EOR> This place B O M B  why cant NorCal??!!

Well  just said isn't it? point totally over dealing people  When she returned missing toppings she gave random and poor excuse  end interaction her   Salad review didn't dressing because thought way acidic way much it  no real balance flavors salad toppings did well together    Overall If you're vegan your friends really want eat then but don't say didn't warn you  If they're any burger joint check Yardhouse  mad awesome service great vegan section menu VEGAN BURGER!!! <EOR> Unfortunately yesterday worst place gotten  boyfriend brought mother say worst experience ever restaurant  pork Ramen substituted bacon meals inedible  Even worse took 20 minutes glasses water come served until meal  Each employee seen taking bite food before exiting kitchen chewing throughout restaurant even tables while taking orders hostess even involved this  asked take home noodles told no containers couldn't find them  just somewhere else tell everyone know same  There's many hard workers deal poor poor service  <EOR> The BEST place ever   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries Truffle Parmesan Fries bombs along burgers had   Ban mi burger really good!  took long time table but definitely worth wait!  must try!!!! <EOR> Are twice don't think all good   Don't understand why many good review  Overrated opinion !!

Why all hype? guess because food channel  <EOR> Sitting table right now discomfort result staff yelling cussing each other full volume every customer hear  perspective type action very unprofessional definitely gives place very bad uncomfortable vibe   Before even being seated sister heard 2 servers going cussing each other point where heard every single word saying each other   After 20 minutes into eating meals different employee carrying 2 packs beer made scene yelled hostess busboy did move way time said FUCKING MOVE NEXT TIME WOULD YA    even foot away where family eating   PLUS next we're family 3 young child also heard well  Overall food okay but atmosphere personalities majority employees disgusting  honestly could even finish new because 1  much yelling arguing happening 2  just uncomfortable vibe restaurant  going again hope improve way speak coworkers     <EOR> Came Friday afternoon   wait 20 minutes   famished time seated   swear wanted try everything menu     When server came ask wanted drink gave request   Right before he left drinks said We're ready order  guess may sounded bit harsh but only because starving   sister gave look he left said Sheesh!

<EOR> Burgers re imagined style popular Asian comfort food   fusion disaster synergistic food nirvana?  question sought answer when stepped into southeastern joint sister visiting town two other friends     Beginning appetizer Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries garnished sunny side egg   let concept wrinkle your brain minute Portion definitely worthy sharing 4    Shaq would better luck winning game Jenga attempting eat one's hands without making hot mess    Armed forks broke egg all across beautiful pastiche crisp golden fries hearty oxtail chili luscious gooey cheese harmonized beautiful symphony texture flavor     The hardest part deciding burgers each agreed order distinct burger cut them into quarters all sample   Although waiter suggested order them medium think chose wisely medium rare   Burger #1 Ronin  In movie Ronin when DeNiro's character asked he avoids ambush he replies Whenever any doubt no doubt  When glanced description read reviews trusty Yelpers appears gold standard Bachi Burgers no doubts going winner   Perfectly cooked patty topped some nuttiness miso goma dressing tanginess Katsu bbq sauce crunch Japanese slaw binded together runny yolk fried egg then slathered citrus yuzu aioli if haven't started drooling your keyboard perhaps need your salivary glands checked out   Burger #2 Kalbi Burger  Somewhat misnormer since use ground beef pork rather marbly beef short rib which its name sake inspired but nonetheless well executed   Along korean inspired mayo green onions healthy punch kimchee flavor profile great although would preferred stronger spice component hotter chili paste   Nice touch banchan accompaniment spicy korean pickles   Burger #3 The Crusty Crab's replacement Can't recall name since specials supposed replacement Crusty Crab which essentially crabcake sandwich but Steak Oscar between two pieces bread temporarily call Krabby patty honor Spongebob Squarepants   Beef patty topped crab scallop fried egg some crispy vegetable component slipped mind Plankton would gladly hatch scheme serve burger compete Krusty Krabs      Burger #4 Spicy Miso Burger  Highlights include Angus beef roasted garlic apple vinaigrette side note totally would missed word spelling bee because sneaky extra i shishito peppers   cute girl next door standing alongside other three supermodels burgers   Nothing complain but much revelation either   finely shredded lettuce propensity lose its crunch amongst liquid components without providing any added flavors spicy arugula   Don't intimidated name shishito peppers considered anywhere close spicy its other Asian cousins Chinese Thai cuisine   not really sure if could even which probably relates final point apple vinaigrette overpowers other mild components don't popping off distinct flavors other burgers   In summary patties well seasoned sufficiently moist brioche like bun probably personal preference since soft heavy opposed light toasty reminds baked pork buns dim sum although would say Ronin comes closest living Barney Stinson's highest compliment any budding burger connoisseur love burger much wanna sew ass shut! <EOR> Everyone raving oxtail chili cheese fries but just tasted regular chili cheese fries egg top  Nothing extravagant  But fries itself pretty good    I originally ordered Kiki's burger husband ordered Miyagi Wagyu burger but then totally changed mind switched burgers  personally Miyagi burger better  reminded Manly burger Umami burger  husband says he liked Kiki's burger better guess all worked out    I'm giving 3 stars because food really yummy but also expensive  Also first place Vegas decent boba  searched long hard boba places give almost same thing California place came pretty close  only problem said expensive  such small portions  But mean overall I'd still eat again  <EOR> Here experience Bachi Burger   work order burger salad   directed towards bar area looked over menu   ordered Myagi san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger comes Chili Mayo Fried Egg Furikake caramelized Bacon crispy onion rings $15 00 it used $13 50 2014   waitress asked would cooked told medium  asked waitress if could substitute caramelized bacon sweet onion marmalade she said she leave caramelized bacon off but she would charge sweet onion marmalade add $1 50   reluctantly agreed added market salad which came spring mix heirloom tomatoes cucumbers carrots champagne vinaigrette $5 00   burger salad plus tax came $23 24 before tip which tipped $3 00 since take total $26 00   When paid waitress she told give $30 00 bartender change he gives back $6 76 five dollar bill dollar bill  76 change   Now don't know if he thought someone should $1 76 $5 00 tip take out   cheap no means but tip appropriate since myself work tip job   ask change $5 00   didn't bother much but felt should add review because tipping point    When home opened burger looked good messy but when looked inside left off Furikake which really gives distinct flavor luckily some home no big deal but when took bite burger rare middle hard over cooked outside medium asked for  Plus if grass fed really couldn't tell didn't taste better any In and Burger ever had   company where meat must inferior others  Then box containing salad opened no salad dressing   called them tell them mistakes   told could come back dressing apologies   also told them burger just gave puppy dog look sorry   told them  okay walked vowing never return   Well if want burger similar ordered Fukuburger $7 99 + fries $3 99 + drink $2 55 + $3 00 tip  $19 00   plenty burger joints wanting extra business don't gouge customers sub ingredients no charge   dine if spend money   won't see there   STAFF nice say   would give them 5 stars  <EOR> Outstanding food     Small kind wait which largely exaggerated hostess    Food service awesome    Can't over good food was     Bloody's unique lived them not    Burgers fries beyond bitchen!

He really liked thought worth amount he paid   My friend Stella K ordered Spicy Miso Burger which waitress highly recommended favorite burger she added grilled onions    My friend Ritchie J ordered Miyago which he really liked too   When food came waitress Aubrey fucked order brought two bachi fish burgers when only ordered one    bachi fish burger no garlic although specifically said add garlic  Once almost all done burgers friend's spicy miso burger came out    could waitress order wrong when she's recommended burger?     Horrible service  also ordered pork buns but when friend's miso burger came asked where pork buns she hadn't even placed order!

Service hit miss depending time come in    seen people walk due service  They've sitting long without service getting pissed off them   <EOR> Obviously most reviews friends restaurant   Positives  1  DIRT CHEAP 2  Great Ideas menu  Negatives 1  Overcooked 2  Cold Fries 3  Very few healthy choices 4  brand new place should work hard customers come back ask opinion  I try them again hopefully its better experience figure timing food especially fries cold  would sent them back but no asked anything was  Also stupid pay cashier  server getting tipped take money cashier me  duh    POTENTIAL NO DOUBT hopefully arrogant listen customers maybe even ask them things are???  2 25 11  Update also 5 Stars guys some great food   Bachi majorly improved lately  Good cook times food always good  Service 1000x better  lot original servers seems someone trained them now   fixed cashier seems little pricier just more broke lately  Fries could hotter but cold any means  Lonely Bird where its @  think made sweeter more sugar marinade  pickles super fun  <EOR> This place never dissapoints   Every burger tried delish buns remind Krispy Kreme   Maybe because they're fluffy baked golden brown   I dunno   brandy milkshake something new recently tried didn't disappoint  <EOR> My wife finally made most recent trip Vegas  seen DDD looked amazing    We arrived about230pm Friday  packed  wait 10 minutes  had Pork belly steamed buns  Oxtail chili cheese fries amazing!  And because new thing tried Tonkotsu Shio ramen which amazing also!  We see told 2 kitchens ramen burger restaurant  Whatever food amazing!  This place much better most DDD places weave tried  can't wait come back next trip Vegas    Service 5 5  <EOR> Hands down FAVORITE burger place Vegas ever! coworkers weekly  alternate between burger Bachi fish  Salt pepper fries best ones! Stir fried edamame best those  <EOR> Had kiki burger standard fries  pineapple ketchup awesome  Looking forward next trip  <EOR> Stars earned only food  good tasting overall  However waited while outside waiting seats then led into entirely empty section dining area which seemed ramen part space  personally don't waiting when many empty tables  waitress friendly but food took forever come even she said just plating dishes  party ramen waited see if food told eat before cold he slowly ate  He finished meal before food  Overall food good but timing service terrible  <EOR> Bachi burger never disappoint me  Ever! love place would definitely recommend family friends  love collaborate shoku I believe  word sure anyway love soup  <EOR> I Oxtail Chili Cheese fries featured Diners Drive In's Dives  Awesome!  burgers super delicious well really great service  <EOR> My expectation Bachi Burger little high! Everyone know both Bachi burger Fuku Burger said I'd place better but highly disagree!!!! miyagi san burger oxtail chili fries because recommended friends yes both good but great  burgers little over priced personally think Fuku burger more flavor  give place 1 star due service received here  When walked even greeted filipino girl guess hostess  She didnt look happy either  waiter feminine guy wasnt friendly either  He didnt feel welcomed nor did he introduce menu us  He asked drink wanna order? Literally! He didnt come check once received food but quick cash out  wouldnt recommend place anyone its sad because saw food network well excited try place  <EOR> Went Bachi Burger Saturday eat lunch nine year old son ordered Burger truffle fries took them almost 45 minutes burger french fries plus 35 minute wait seating then Burger came table black charred told burger place can't burger right she said another said wait 45 minutes no thanks took burned Burger back told won't charge but charge Truffle fries waited two half hours pay them fries told never return fuku Burger amazing never done spring Mountain Jones <EOR> Burgers awesome! Super different  Asian infused  think beef patty slaw over easy egg unagi sauce  Really good  little pricey but fresh  $13 $14 per burger  Doesn't include fries  fan ramen but burgers worth going back to! <EOR> Oh My  God   sure location did since familiar Vegas friend drove however say really loved place   wait 40 minutes maybe less seated on weekday late lunch but wait well worth it   Don't love when happens?  ordered Bah Mi burger Morimoto sake Rogue beer kinda hard find   meal all time rest life   mini donuts dessert   fries good just cannot remember which ordered   Can please please please open location San Diego? <EOR> I suggested Bachi co worker before tried because mistakenly assumed place its namesake suggests sells only  beef based burgers   he 3 times week filling stories crabcake burger blew away    well see myself     My girl met lunch both ordered Crabcake Burger   Based reviews asked meet early    but then lost trying find place since sort tucked into back random strip mall Windmill   almost exactly noon when walked while certainly people resto wasn't packed way expecting be     Service quick efficient and    when Crabcake Burger came out    angels sang   wholesome deliciousness hoped wouldn't end   crabcake slightly spicy hint asian flavor    battered fried onion ring perched cake just right touch     Loved Bachi am looking forward going back   Also those vegetarians among options too!! While didn't sample soy veggie burgers menu sounded delish! <EOR> Admittedly being newbie fancy schmancy fusion burger spots Bachi really blew mind   packed but seated less 10 minutes   service very friendly place looks cool   far burgers knock me!    I Bahn Mi   straight phó style burger pickled carrot veggies jalapeno fresh lush basil   dip sweet phó sauce   Very good   4 5  There KiKi which mushrooms bacon looked good   lil'bro's didn't try it   The best Miyagi burger   fried onions fried egg chimichuri dijon sauce wagyu burger   masterpiece burger  5 5  The Truffle Fries Vietnamese type truffle peanut butter drizzle straight garlic truffle drizzle between   special aioli  could only better actual truffle specks  4 5 5  All burgers bun similar larger soft sticky bun   Service food worthy 5 stars me  <EOR> What say burgers hasn't already said??? Yummo!!! Ono!!! Awesome!!! Grindz!!! Broke da mouth!!!! All apply  Everything ordered mouth watering finger licking good    The oxtail chili cheese fries delicious could actually taste oxtail! big chunks meat just shredded   Parmesan truffle fries absolute must!!!! burgers cooked order weren't overcooked all  plantation iced tea very refreshing perfect compliment meal   You should definitely try place!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> Ate first time  Loved Asian flavored burgers can't wait back try more  ginger soda which also delicious  Service little slow but otherwise great  <EOR> So tried Bachi Burger finally say burgers tasty but little over priced is   buns delectable meat definitely higher grade meat but overall a la carte pricing wonder your pocket book compared other burger joints   Definitely great idea made off Asian fusion burgers though    It probably doesn't help to go isn't packaged nicely say    Chilis thus feel to go crowd doesn't quite same service those inside restaurant   You'll run $15 person without drinks   Burgers $7 15 if want fries another $3 6    suggestion?  Always medium medium rare  well done wasn't done all way through some pink looked charred some outside which meant heat great cook insides before outside burned   Don't wrong great food but getting to go found less heartening experience considering  <EOR> Ate first time tonight  Food delicious!! all staff very friendly fast when when left  plan coming back! <EOR> I ordered Ronin burger wanted medium rare   Waiter says chef recommends medium   say OK Medium is   burger comes well done dried up   Egg overcooked   No flavor extremely bland  Chili chicken appetizer wasn't bad but chicken itself dry   Also extremely expensive amount food get   Prices pretty high local vegas standards    use live Vegas paying $10 $12 burger without sides pretty expensive   $12 customizable burger loaded toppings sauces The Counter F O  burger LA same price    I don't expect pay boondocks Vegas Summerlin  What liked Variety serves beer parmesan fries  What didn't like blandness food slow service poor overpriced <EOR> Hands down best burger ever eaten! Miyagi burger truffle fries MUST! Everything burger absolute perfection  When Bachi Burger know taste amazing but somehow first bite still blows away every time  wait table usually long usually takes pretty long time actually your food but worth promise  <EOR> Ok let's see hype all about!  hearing much place long time   decided check out   see all yelps saying could gather wait pretty long sit down   figured heard many good things burgers worth chance wait   walk into narrow restaurant find some big comfy couches front   thought great wait if couches   put name sat down 2 year old grabing Las Vegas Weekly Seven magazines piling them couch   didn't really wait long seated pretty fast    We sat down now next hurdle   order?  didn't know where begin  scanned menu only word stuck Kimchi  order Kimchi burger   wife ordered regular angus burger   ordered fries variety fries   think daughter grilled cheese    when food came awesome   burger many flavors   Try early if large group because when eating large group waiting some time   Bachi burger its own class   recommend! Cheers! <EOR> I've pleasure eating meal least six occasions  Diet Coke flavor delicious  sweet potato fries well  Everything menu high quality tastes good  burgers however simply spectacular  recommend all  <EOR> EDIT manager Bachi Burger contacted concerns since both HORRIBLE experiences backlash negative reviews decent ones MUST add review ***Because professionally handled polite message if back area would likely give place another try just order different things  Management excellent customer service skills? Good job   Wow    can't express disappointment myself friends experienced place  should also stated KNEW walking into fusion restaurant expecting different take burgers but wasn't expecting sugar rush upset much sweets stomach burger lunch   We arrived lunch having driven quite ways away strip which FINE if want drive didn't mind time  But if you're looking good burger you're visiting Las Vegas staying strip? Just eat somewhere down really starving  place busy but full having said took quite bit time seated comparison other restaurants just busy during trip yet seated sooner  When seated then took quite while someone pay attention long enough take order seemed very impatient annoyed questions menu any three being indecisive  very much non engaging well if sense didn't feel though gave hoot whatsoever spending money business   The items all settled on Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns only thing really liked meal  new interesting version steamed buns since LOVE steamed buns any form dim sum liked different take dish   Spicy Miso Burger  Black Green Burger  Kiki's Burger ordered  honestly say along other people table all remember OVER POWERINGLY SWEET THING WAS  Seriously  Sure juicy tender meat but couldn't even taste meat itself because drenched whatever marinade sauce use  being told place excellent burgers must say    excellent unless want sugar high no interest burger itself  HOWEVER burger buns divine fluffy  Very nice touch but would nicer touch burger worth eating  If quality meat great wonderful then shouldn't hose them down much sauce kill flavor such quality meat   Truffle Parmesan Fries unimpressive  tasted took powdered brown mushroom gravy packet comment partner said  top overly sweetened mush burgers enough food just skipped fries altogether   Taro boba bland definitely better lesser price partner remarked thai tea kind dull too   We few other things but don't recall EVERYTHING table    none good enough really remember except neat steamed buns fluffy burger buns were   In end incredibly disappointing experience came $70 ish should under $50 felt it  whole place seemed pretentious snooty especially restaurant specializing burgers  attitude or lack since hardly cared pay attention us service ridiculous marinade sauced burger patties overall disappointment worth recommending place others least point view   To top all off reservations restaurant night all very excited but within 20 minutes leaving two three stomachs soured sugar burgers cancel dinner plans actually just return hotel rooms nap! <EOR> Been twice now since moving back town  Ronin Burger     Best burger ever had!!!!!! Veggie burger second visit best veggie burger ever had!!! peeps now go to burger joint LV! <EOR> This place located 10 15 minutes off strip bit inconvenient especially since hate driving when Vegas   Parking wasn't difficult find since lot pretty big  may difficult find spot close restaurant though   The wait hour long  friends couldn't wait Subway grab some food before eating lunch   I thought truffle fries amazing probably favorite! ordered Ronin burger  yuzu sauce created good balance burger but same time didn't think complemented well   I think place just average  wouldn't come back if Vegas  <EOR> Okay let start saying LOVE cheeseburgers   learned don't love fashion burgers here   sauce put sweet potatoes fries     I think good try but isn't place burger experience food gasmic orchestration flavors bun   stick Five Guys In n out     <EOR> Well nearly  2 years decided give Bachi Burger another chance yes hold grudges     I'm quite sure opinion going terribly popular definitely minority but just wasn't all impressed    Allow explain    We thinking wouldn't busy 2 30 Monday but way off base  place slammed! far cry last experience warmly greeted hostess almost instantly!

But don't worry classics if prefer   We always bring people because fun lively delicious! A few tips  Pork Belly buns may seem obvious choice burger place but amazing! Miyagi San burger OMG  garlic truffle edamame  Yes just it!  Love place! <EOR> One favorite burger places town  First off oxtail chili cheese fries  Normally fan chili but would eat bowl stuff any day  overloaded cayenne chili powder some chilis but perfectly balanced  Smoky spices rich oxtail creaminess fried egg top  Put top crispy fresh fryer French fries you've best chili cheese fries ever had!  Second again fries  time Parmesan truffle fries  sauce mushroom purée sorts truffle lots shredded Parmesan  comes sun dried tomato aioli but prefer truffle sauce poured over top  Delicious   And finally burger  best burger town  Now simple person into anything complicated burger  custom Angus bacon cheddar  Sounds pretty basic right? Wrong  We'll start bun  bake buns in house sweet light almost Hawaiian bun taste them  come crispy buttery slowly absorbing juices bacon burger simply wonderful  Now bacon  Somehow they've managed bacon even better  applewood smoked caramelized giving extra depth flavor  sweet smoky taste addition typical salty porky flavor bacon  Finally come burger  Juicy tender perfectly cooked beautiful medium perfect grill marks  masterpiece beef patty  can't give place enough praise  Everything tried delicious but three listed easily favorite  If could I'd eat every week  Five stars  Ten ten  A+ <EOR> Amazing food! Seriously mr miyagki burger best burgers ever  pork belly buns delicious  3 small buns definitely craving more  milkshakes worth extra calories  salted caramel toasted marshmallow addicting!

But none less back everytime Vegas! <EOR> I've attempted come Bachi Burger last 3x Vegas FINALLY try last trip! There's always long wait now see why  hype real    We started oxtail chili cheese fries truffle fries  Both made stomach happy  If only things try trip would've left completely satisfied  pretty much sucker anything fried egg top  fries crispy chili tasty sunny side egg just completed dish  truffle fries came brown sauce top  slightest idea but sure added truffle fries experience   Also list things ordered pork belly steamed buns houses sauce side  pork belly crispy sides much flavor!

So see very split three stars! <EOR> Before when first opened huge fan place   but now wondering if taste slightly deteriorated jump popularity??  Their burgers definitely good   if could give 1 2 stars they'd definitely 3 5   but drop 3 because expecting more long wait hype   You probably won't wrong any burger choices   <EOR> OMG LOVE PLACE!!!

I ordered Kiki's burger which came overcooked dry  desperately needed aioli showed 20 minutes later having ask server twice  don't know justify charging $15 charred burger some KBBQ sauce drizzled it   Food came inconsistently half party done while other half hadn't even served yet   What whole ordeal even worse Bachi actually used pretty good few years ago  only reason isn't star review thanks fond memories place used be  <EOR> this place more hype anything last year friend SEMA heard place where else  made best thing since sliced bread  talk going try it  first when took forever seated which thought good thing ended being seated very back toilets  service terrible served coke flat! when asked another given attitude  food ordered mr miyagi burger friend ordered bahn mi burger  mr miyagi wasn't horrible but wasn't all into it  friend let try bahn mi burger tasted way much going on  realized would better off just going bahn mi sandwiches maybe 8 bucks better quality  ordered chili fries  only thing good  bad  but overall experience sucked  oh think fact could smell stank bathroom didn't help so maybe once lifetime trip would cool if dont eat much asian food but if avoid way pricey 2 burgers 1 beer two sodas fries little more 50 bucks seems just hipster place go! <EOR> One favorite culinary movements  finally penetrating non coastal cities U S  proper Asian American fusion reason really wanted fall love Bachi Burger  menu spot but product delivery fell just tad bit short elsewhere   Star 1 service atmosphere?  No complaints service Bachi  Service fast friendly while ever slightly irked couldn't order just single pork bun try burger instead order three later hate myself everything came together  Star Granted    Star 2 portions relative cost?  As now harked length $15 00 cap sit down burger spot very few exceptions  Bachi must feel same way most expensive burger Miyagi San comes right $15 00  burger isn't quite large oversized bun even more oversized onion rings allude but no means rip off    From three small duck pork buns $12 00 $4 00 each which also wasn't deal nor ripoff  Star Granted    Stars 3 4 food?  Honestly both dishes Bachi Burger just okay I started Duck Pork Buns which while obviously freshly prepared good ingredient proportions didn't ton flavor  cabbage carrots egg downplayed duck bit point where accompanying sauce needed bao ever slightly sticky which happen if sit two long    The burger similar story  absurdly large bun unnecessary apart optics while onion rings did end picking two them off could actually taste burger patty which decent but packed own inherent flavor  cheese egg paired nicely but all all just good burger great one  Single Star Granted    Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  Vegas days stacked Asian burgers alike can't say would  No Star Granted  <EOR> Great place burgers off strip   Service excellent  staff knowledgeable menu  person fish allergy party above beyond accommodate him  pork belly steamed buns Bahn mi burger great  Oxtail Fries ok  Nice trendy atmosphere  <EOR> Pork belly steamed buns Kalbi burger oxtail chili cheese fries fried egg feast kings  If choose last meal earth would want place  gem find Vegas  Superb  Saw food network visit  Wish San Diego CA   Absolutely loved food experience  When back Vegas Bachi burger must have  Deserves 8 stars 5  Above beyond!! <EOR> Let put way  Nothing tasted bad its best stuff far fusion food vegas  <EOR> First all wait staff attentive friendly apologetic   Otherwise might 1 star review    However very disappointing experience  location Sahara great experience great food  wanted bring friends disappointed wasn't good remembered    After ordered took maybe 5 minutes ramen come which pretty fast  But burgers took another 20 30 minutes come out  thought forgot order  When food came burgers over done buns toasted  saw little boy next table whose bun burnt! ordered two medium burgers medium well all three well done dry    The ramen very good would again    I would hesitate come back hard tell if it'll any good  Maybe would check Sahara location again since pretty good  <EOR> One star horrible service  Rude said understaffed wouldn't seat even many open tables plenty staff around  Mind server now manager know being inconsiderate when watched atleast 4 tables leave STILL refused seat us  Food came cold wrong ordered  Tasted ok  Overall disappointed amount money spent crappy food <EOR> At first feelin vibe  Everyone nice food fast also delicious  But towards end meal server checking us  mean understand there's other table tend but busy anyone come check needed anything else     fine but when ordered tonkatsu ramen Togo excited home it  opened box no meat  No tonkatsu  ramen tasted crap without it  such disappointment even thinking posting but did  upset ramen didn't look boyfriends ramen did when he restaurant <EOR> Seriously BEST BURGER ever tasted!

Kiki's burger also really good  If you're thinking mushroom bacon cheeseburger ok   but there's much more! First all three different mushrooms shitake enoki eryngyii mushroom flavor profile much more complex  cheese gruyere strong enough keep mushrooms sweet onion marmalade added counterpoint sweetness just well sang    I ordered house made soda  the cherry yuzu  which also good  usually soda drinker but just couldn't pass yuzu  little more cherry flavor yuzu but  ok   Service very friendly yes others said kind being home Hawaii  so many local looking faces both working eating Bachi Burger  Hm now could just convince them come home open place here? <EOR> worth try  Nice fusion style burger  ordered Kiki burger Miyagi  Both think quite awesome  <EOR> We greeted waiter Matt ladies tonight ?

Also Ronin burger    Again OK    $10 would rather them give 3 buns only    only thing good tonight    Also bit pricey total came $27 burger n fries    should've In N Out $7 put $20 black southpoint !

Loved pan seared foie gras although couldn't distinguish Yamamomo Peach Asian Pear really well added nice sweetness rich sandwich  Wagyu Beef delicious well  Unagi seemed unnecessary though didn't add anything significant taste texture kind took away two main ingredients Wagyu Foie Gras   also tried SWEET POTATO FRIES first time along two favorite staples okay  liked freshness being salty but other amazing fry options doesn't come close   We did bad customer service experience where ended leaving without dinner going another restaurant  rather busy night and sure lots those communication seating availability horrendous  Especially since called ahead  lack organization gentleman appeared manager poorly handled situation  really disappointing  Very off putting since regular wasn't complete deterrent however friends bad enough warrant another visit  way want lose customers! Otherwise service just okay  Which real shame food delicious   Update haven't visited location over year because last experience  Summerlin location few times prefer MUCH more  service substantially better crowded no tourists!   would stay away location  <EOR> This great side trip during last bachelor's party  short ride Strip located corner strip mall  No better place wish right now  advice Guy Fieri's Triple D    huge fan books   Five hungry guys devoured food quickly  Oxtail?

First all if going charge people condiments RESTAURANT   need tell customer there's extra charge  Second all don't bring condiment didn't ask then charge it   Matthew left all food table left  won't back  <EOR> food great once again    but   35 minutes burger   too damn slow half therestaurant empty tables kitchen help should replaced    i'm just sayin!### <EOR> I sick off food   never eat again   never sick life  My husband eat lot   really bad food poisoning   dont know if something bad if pork burger fully cooked     Be Careful Pork must cooked all way if may develop trichinosis  look <EOR> I'd def back eat bachi fish burger  great tasty  Lightly grilled juicy fish Japanese seasonings   We also veggie burger which ok  good veggie burger  different little Indian type taste  pescatarians     I would truffle fries again well  <EOR> I looking forward eating Holsteins again few weeks ago   However didn't any reservations OpenTable bestie local saying yummy Bachi Burger is   all if off Strip usually better   love fusiony burgers knew I'd Bachi Burger     It tough decision but finally decided Kalbi Burger   He truffle fries share   friend regular fries both she bf Miso Burger   wait food long but worth it   burgers huge juicy   Mine cooked perfectly medium   sweet savory sauce complimented salty semi spicy kimchee   truffle fries hint truffles however while bf liked gravy topped didn't   Everyone enjoyed burgers friend loved refreshingly sweet pineapple ketchup served fries   Prices reasonable menu eclectic enticing    Bachi Burger gets busy think service little more attentive we waiting awhile done bill but food delish!

Brought boyfriend he disappointed oxtail chili cheese fries burger  He loves meat he pleased when chili overpowered fries he could barely find any oxtail  He asked server if oxtail real told yes but wish given some insight oxtail chili cheese ratio since made foolproof obvious neither tried oxtail chili fries before  try blame server he cook probably used dishes being just   dishes  But if server deliberately holding tongue watch just order things reach some sort sales quota then would deeply disappointed    My boyfriend said meat medium rare KiKi Burger kind tasteless said same medium rare Miyagi san  He loves meat much he expected more such popular gourmet asian fusion burger joint  still appreciated Miyagi san but agree changed slightly gone down taste over years   For location tonkotsu shio ramen Shoku Ramen ya same management next door delicious broth tamago  enjoyed it!  The 3 workers interacted well mannered appreciate that  <EOR> Still 5 5  few days ago last trip initially going try soft shell crab po' boy but all out! sadly settled another Shogun burger  While $25 burger gambling didn't paying price  time added egg even though afraid would conflict foie gras unagi but didn't   Maybe next time bacon too!

Heard best gourmet burger spots Vegas featured food networks diners drive ins dives    <EOR> I've multiple occasions love every time! Asian fusion hamburgers done right! If you're gonna add asian ingredients ALL WAY! Don't just add teriyaki sauce same patty use your boring burgers   Ronin Burger loyal fan forever! sauce give just takes burger whole other level  Dip drizzle drench it  all your mouth reward you    Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries Why didn't anyone think frying egg adding top before?! yummy although few times could tell chili sitting stove all day  But I'd still eat definitely share group because you'll probably heart attack much calories bad boy   Banh Mi Burger Those pickled veggies! YUMM O!  Mr  Ho Burger? forget name because took bite friend but think taro bread which definitely interesting if love mixing savory sweet  Unfortunately don't but I'd definitely share someone just bite     Miyagi Burger little hyped taste but still pretty good compared your average American hamburger   Pork Belly Sliders only once took because stuffed  Didn't eat until hotel room where cold  Still tasted good but need come back taste hot!  My sister also ordered lychee soda also very good interesting!  If don't love Bachi Burger definitely should In N Out add some teriyaki sauce  <EOR> As person comes Bachi often orders exact same thing every single time let's just say don't appreciate little dispute waiter     something multiple times know should taste  why argue me? Just take back let go  top arriving 8 45 being seated 9 20 now 10 07 food yet arrive!!!!   Let's move forward now being 10 23 food finally arrived    Llet's talk when fried rice arrived extremely SALTY! when say salty mean literally only tasted salt rice  sent back kind enough remake me   BUT when received ramen just bitter  assume just decided put any salt any food sending rice back  said come often know food should taste because ALWAYS ORDER SAME EXACT THING!!!!   Surely enough ended talking manager complaints she nice enough ensure better visit next time come  Sadly best friends first time she impressed  felt bad because suggested amazing place never let's down always great when except time! <EOR> Overhyped    or people easily impressed   Let's start off service   hostess unorganized kept fluttering about  plenty open tables but party 2 kept waiting almost hour  then she sat group 4 came us     We finally sat table open 20 minutes right next people sat before us  waitress then came said she would bring water didn't ask water but she made gesture never fulfilled until finally reminded her   Once ordered really didn't see again until time boot off table   She did speedy walk bys murming something but she would gone before could respond   The food   many tables ordering ox tail chili top fries egg   Woooooo sarcasm   looks smell fry truck brisket poutine which basically was far better   I ordered double Angus burger fried onion rings tempura style bacon because waitress made excuses why could add pork belly bahns whoch lead conclusion bahns premade swiss   They also offer waygu which suspect true if its those would ruin perfectly fine piece meat doing ungodly things did burgers    Basically grill meat whichever ordered basted hell hoison sauce   Which brings back why order waygu burger then cover flavor hoison bbq sauce?   And friend waygu tough when asked he said he liked it  meat? just taste sauce   The fries run mill but truffle ones those eaters succumb those parlor tricks   In end Bachi Burger isn't worst burger joint but far better ones   Most people probably like group next whose buzz words waygu  truffle oil but also Ed Hardy shirts think Mercedes Benz awesome cars rocked Does Fox Say   <EOR> Wa tada wonderful  could eat every day  Variety only eclipsed quality  Top notch food service  must now!

Finally food came more then 45 minutes  Remember restaurant point almost empty  and brought adult food first  Then more then 10 minutes brought all adult food kids food came    Uh heck! Sure 4 2 year old super patient waited very well almost hour food uh not!   The food bland almost flavorless  salt pepper fries no pepper whatever other toppings listed being part there! black green burger basically tasted meat stale bun  supposed blue cheese the reason ordered it! but no cheese found  should returned but really didn't 55 more minutes wait new burger didn't want talk condescending server food again  side note music loud awkward  did fit lunch crowd!   This isn't first bad experience but last!

Actually just talked manager seems AC working tomorrow owners want spend money fans   Just seated serves nice cold drinks served very quickly smart lady   Anyways everyone wants know food   Yeah good ok its better good probably second best burger eaten   I kiki burger minus onion great burger fries truffle oil ones very nice well   Proof yet again quality ingredients gives quality food   Desert time only thing doughnuts let's see     Mmm yeah ok best ever little tough side ice cream refreshing though if little bland throwing coffee bean generic vanilla ice cream doesn't cut it   So all all very good meal less optimal setting  <EOR> Cool hip ambiance nice servers great decor  Food good  burgers great texture strong sauces big meaty patty  <EOR> This burger joint remains rock steady consistent high food quality its presentations   Dan man knows every visit your first   food number one   The forethought seating hostess truly suspect   Why would try cram seven good sized adults corner table designed six?  among first five parties opened restaurant   course refused accept such amateurish unprofessional choice  <EOR> Went while Vegas weekend  friend told also saw Diners drive inns dives check out  girl ordered oxtail fries ordered burger  burger done perfectly way well done  still juicy bun great  service pretty good also  only reason didn't give four star fries  main reason both wanted come here  absolutely no oxtail fries  came three plates table other two guys table next us  Offcourse both peaked over see plates yes chunks oxtails fries  Otherwise taste great but left yearning more  #oxtails#wheretheyatthough  <EOR> Ever since moving Vegas around summer last year hearing much hype particular joint  Does live it? ehhhh kind of  first visit back September last year killed me  ordered parmensean garlic fries tomato aeoli sauce app            waited over 35 mins      keep mind place busy all           still no fries    come now long does take throw some fries fryer? only but waitress time didn't even issue apology anything she wrong time cause hellllllllla hungry hard session gym  Burgers alright just service couldv'e better minus 1 star   Decided give Bachi another try last night late night around 11pm gf again WAY BETTER SERVICE!! looks new staff? Anyway greeted sat down right away waitress Melissa really nice gal  She catered right away prompt orders parmesean fries again    but them within 10 mins! superb Melissa! Munched those while waited Duck Steam Bums    kind chinese taco if think it    BOMB COM!! burgers came right after   I Miyagi San Grass fed wagyu burger    a little greasy but worth every gut busting calorie! HECK YEAH!!!! gf the    I forgot   it looked little healthier mine though lol  WHATEVER BIG HOME! constantly checked Melissa even fellow waiter don't know name but service meant everything know   I'm supervisor asian diner    Good job food service Bachi Team! only negative say latest trip though fries little crunchy well done liking but whatever burgers made it!  P S   They Food Channel playing LCD Tv's music lounge Chill perfect mix  <EOR> Oh Bachi longed come visit you    After long wait family gorged wide selection menu    We ordered pickled vegetables oxtail fries Spicy Miso Burger Kiki's Burger Kalbi's burger   Despite many raving reviews personally did care Oxtail Fries  chili over bed fries    oxtail did add much flavor even egg yolk which very minimal did wow me  expected lot more punch but just tasted chili over fries  If didn't tell oxtail wouldn't known  nearly $11 super disappointed    Out all burgers tried LOVED Spicy Miso Burger  good mouth watering reminisce burger  Delicious combination egg time wonderful flavor spiciness miso sauce  burger cooked perfection medium thoroughly enjoyed it    I would rank Spicy Miso Kalbi the Kim Chee alright  nothing spectacular since much better Kim Chee but lot flavor every bite then Kiki's   We randomly tried pickled vegetables see picture attached wasn't anything special  good though just very dainty    The reason 3 stars opposed 4 because lot different wacky speciality burgers only thought Spicy Miso burger worth price  food didn't wow point where would necessarily come again because there's just MUCH more places visit Vegas! <EOR> Food Oxtail fries pretty good expected but very filling tasty  surprised two finished haha! Kiki burger also very tasty cooked perfectly med rare   boyfriend Miyagi burger fried onion rings which told #1 seller  thought lacked some flavor but really liked crunchiness onions fried egg added nice touch  Overall burgers ok   I guess expecting little more?   Service good too   Understandably lunch rush weren't checked regularly but server very nice! <EOR> I love good burger  Now throw Asian twist may just found perfection two favorites one?! felt destined food this   This place luckily lack service service mediocre if that food  burger quality excellent Hawaiian bun serve them nice touch  Kiki's burger which Angus burger sauteed shiitake enoki eryngi mushrooms bacon gruyere cheese sweet onion marmalade  loved everything burger  juicy tasty flavors very well balanced aka MOUTHGASM  also truffle Parmesan fries  Yum yum yum!  I would definitely suggest trying burger off specialty burger menu rather building your own  because any burger joint   I'm hoping when decide return service experience little better but really rate service just food  other menu options saw would definitely warrant return visit  <EOR> I love burger place! usually stick Ronin burger patty done medium rare  comes fried egg done over easy which perfect  bit pricey but won't disappoint you  burger side fries usually comes around $20 but worth it! <EOR> Came some friends enjoyed meal  Only thing keeping five stars service value  expensive at $11 $17 per burger burgers didn't come any fries your typical burger sides     I eyeing lamb burger which won James Beard award but when server asked he said lamb  asked if could switch patty he no all out  Ok    Thanks your help   ?   Also server didn't explain any condiments table  hope isn't servers full time job bc he isn't doing himself any favors being sullen    I Kalbi burger kimchee good  Probably 1 3 lb patty lot thickened soy sauce  wasn't spicy hoping but good  ordered medium but came medium rare   Also didn't seem value worth it  $11 burger made regular angus beef good but didn't come any fries your typical burger sides  party order fries see below additional side  Other people party $17 burgers which made wagyu beef price sense    The fries extra but deliciously hot    The restaurant pretty basic but clean  two tvs wall could catch glimpses March madness basketball games    Overall four stars good food  <EOR> This best burgers places town! Incredible food great staff amazing menu  only just great place also serve Ramen! cool! tasty! <EOR> The food ok   Horrible service   ordered Thai Iced tea never received until almost done food   Asked dessert menu waitress asked cousin he wanted without knowing he received dessert then told waitress wanted seen she already took order   Then wanted bill split 4 ways she said only split 3 ways   does any sense?? O brought fries waaaay before burgers even came   ate cold fries meals   None less won't coming back   <EOR> In early days Bachi Burger    I honestly many times sick place but am glad back past weekend!  menu definitely expanded refined compared early days   Eatworthy items included oxtail chili cheese fries     think chili cheese fries dolled oxtail chunks jalapenos then sunny side egg top   thing beauty when arrived table    I almost reluctant break egg mix into chili   those afraid eating eggs slightly raw     once egg broken hot chili cheese cooks egg yolk into chili cheese sauce   so don't worry shared amongst four definitely just enough without over indulging   Onto burgers many new burgers compared when frequented place last   Miyagi san grass fed beef burger think made mind since included all favorite ingredients chili mayo furikake bacon crispy onion rings favorite fried egg!  Other burgers enjoyed past   but much Miyagi san Kiki burger little less beef action    the fish burger quite tasty well   If hadn't chose oxtail fries   the truffle fries delicious alternative well   service just slow before    but give wait time fact burgers come look taste quality preparations   still love bun concept have   instead regular old buns   they similar Chinese baked barbecue pork buns little sweet glaze   yum soft fluffy  <EOR> Customer service horrible ramen mediocre Kimchi disgusting overpriced staff encountered causing scenes infront people  Really wish never came wasted time money   They more room improvement any other place gone thats sure  <EOR> Service slow last night   table next turned over three times while there   Only ordered appetizers burgers cocktails   bartender come over replenish mixed drinks could re use glass really don't enough glasses new one   Plates sat table appetizers awhile stack them would hint!  Burgers good fries appetizers good   Food good Service marginal best   If service good might back however wait awhile hopefully staff turn over! <EOR> Went last Vegas trip  Miyagi san burger which very delicious  Also tried Truffle Parmesan Fries good  Definitely coming back place next Vegas trip  <EOR> It's while since last review    since mid 2011 apparently but eating place past weekend just give place review   YES PLACE GOOD!!!  I visit friend working Vegas decided hit place since craving good burger   debating between place Gordon Ramsey Burgr mainly since fan Ramsey    be? studying both yelp reviews Bachi Ramsey    decided Bachi   NO REGRETS!!  Although honest did also end going Ramsey few days later    Ramsey nothing special definitely paled comparison Bachi   But review Bachi Ramsey apologies digress   BACK BACHI!!  My friend Friday night shortly arrived Vegas   would say Bachi close around 745pm   located medium sized shopping plaza off strip Vegas   Nothing plaza screams hiding treasure trove Bachi   There already good amount ppl waiting outside Bachi time when asked put names wait list told would wait around 30 minutes   inside restaurant pretty big quite few tables lots TVs hanging around    very modern trendy   also bar area pretty empty friend just decided sit bar   hungry drive wanted eat!  After perusing menu decided MIYAGI BURGER along order TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES   friend wanted eat little lighter he ordered Sausage appetizers Salad     whatever he's weird   The restaurant busy food did take while come out    think around 30 minutes until food but ohhhhh boy worth wait!!  The Miyagi Burger just gorgeous    everything stacked neatly onto each other   looks those burgers would see TV commercial   When took first bite felt heaven   bun nice fluffy wagyu patty oh juicy oh perfectly cooked   Yes am huge fan bacon guy isn't? but some reason    am fan bacon burger   case here!  All ingredients especially caramelized bacon fried egg worked well burger   Nothing overpowering    everything just served perfect complement accentuate wonderful taste Miyagi burger whole   The burger good size but managed finish entire thing 5 minutes    maybe even less!  only time stopped could take few breathes tell friend delicious burger was   time finished burger plate mess all juices seeped out    but none juices onto clothes no biggie   The truffle fries really good too   oily salty dipping sauces good although didn't find them necessary   distinguished truffle fries other truffle fries brown sauce layered on  sure exactly brown sauce was    thought gravy but gravy isn't listed ingredients menu maybe black truffle porcini cream   ?  way brown sauce good just wish fries came more brown sauce   The place isn't cheap    ended paying around $20 just burger fries but well worth it   honestly say Miyagi burger best ever truffle fries definitely no joke   Definitely coming back try other items!!!  BACHI BURGER ROCKS!! <EOR> Always awesome! best burgers town or anywhere matter!   Don't come looking cheeseburger burgers unlike anything else  flavors incredible  <EOR> Whenever somewhere new look DDD's area try   Bachi Burger came even though don't remember seeing them show wanted try it     It's little confusing because more locations area  which think ? show   location nondescript strip mall    pork belly steamed bun appetizer bahn mi burger   port belly buns good   Pro tip careful if bite bun strip fat back pork all come chunk can't bite through   Consider cutting knife eating whole thing big bite   comes hoisin type sauce which quite good    When ordered bahn mi burger waiter asked if Medium OK   asked medium rare which point he warned burger contains pork shrimp but medium rare if want did  The burger very good   Portions appear small but quite filling   comes fries which also very good   Nothing knocked socks off hence 4 star rating instead 5   think place potential 5 star perhaps caught them off day    would come back try more entrees future if come back Las Vegas area   My waiter young but ball top things   waitstaff refilled drinks competently   parking lot strip mall no issues parking   Pro tip if see Bachi road tempted park wrong site   entrance inner side parking lot   parked walked but wrong side restaurant walk through greeter station  <EOR> The Shogun burger best thing ever ate!! love Foie grais eel its perfect combination   would love try other burgers menu but can't help must Shogun everytime  <EOR> Wow!!!

Im glad found place kind experiences group 4   Service great waiter funny attentive CRAZY fast   shared few plates including shishito peppers octopus balls not best but bad onion rings AMAZING should ordered 4 orders instead 1 each noodle bowl burger mains   Broth delish noodles noodles good but chewier ramen dish XO sauce better texture   Pork belly pieces bits porky heaven honestly very memorable delicious   Cannot stress enough good onion rings were   bit onion ring connoisseur say rank top lifetime list incredible inexpensive   MUST BACK!  need try place now <EOR> Met couple friends live nearby great dinner   Started 3 orders fries appetizer not idea but hey  sure!    All them tasty well Asahi  garlic salt pepper truffle parmesan sweet potato fries     On sidenote   has any restaurant truly found good dipping sauce sweet potato fries??  haven't although thinking something sweeter side might better   Maybe honey cinnamon something   another thing   I just read truffle oil  it's all just chemicals isn't it?    I Kiki burger w egg awesome   Burgers always better egg  that's fact!!  bun real chinese bread   nikumanish quality which loved just made much better   try Ronin Kalbi burgers too   kimchi interesting Kalbi burger  not traditional tasting type but really well everything else going between those 2 pieces bread    Will definitely back! <EOR> Bachi = short Hibachi = Grill  My friends kept raving place telling try recent trip Vegas  late afternoon around 3 PM wait 20 minutes  think  pretty good considering other reviews read    We ordered truffle parmesan fries Wagyu burger Kiki burger  truffle parmesan fries ok  sure liked truffle sauce much  tasted very similar Asian cafe mushroom sauce but little saltier tangier  think would enjoyed fries more if just parmesan it    While waiting burgers noticed staff disarray  saw way many employees restaurant all them running around looking frazzled  guests sitting table next unhappy complained burgers taking long time  waiter later explained having problem computer system  guessing some orders did put into system which caused delay  Despite seemed bad day staff  waiter did even ask husband he wanted burger cooked  When husband told waiter later he did tell he wanted burger cooked waiter said he thought he said medium  Actually said medium  husband always prefers meats rare possible say medium    Anyway when burgers came looked just look pictures juicy delicious  quite pleased Kiki burger although found just tad sweet  enjoyed all flavors mixed together shiitake mushrooms juicy Angus burger veggies soft bread  bite Wagyu burger immediately fell love Wagyu  think might liked Wagyu more Angus burger!   I see why people wait restaurant  better burgers tasted but way restaurant being run could lot smoother especially all those employees  I'd come back Bachi but hope restaurant operate much more fluidly when return  would good if could expand outside Vegas open Los Angeles  bet would hit!  UPDATE They're opening Sawtelle! <EOR> I've 5 times  ramen always excellent but service sucks  same server 3 times she always rude! Today attitude rushed out  understand when wait need turn tables  But nice it!! won't coming back Bachi burger  <EOR> The wait ALWAYS long but food entirely worth it  restaurant best burgers ever eaten entire life  frequent restaurant when am visiting Las Vegas every time brought someone restaurant absolutely LOVED it   Burgers Ronin fan coleslaw it Banh Mi Kalbi favorites   I need try Wagyu burger but 24 dollars!

Pork Belly Bao's just oka6y  imagined them tasting much better watching episode Diners  actual chinese steam bun hot even warm cold  worst part cold bun when chinese steam bun gets cold firms warm soft texture bun no longer  Also pork belly executed well  Diners episode shows dredge pork belly lighly corn starch then deep fry give suttle crunch texture then pan sautee actual pork belly marinade  clearly case when dined there  pork looked if only tossed pan some oil    The Ox Tails fries sound better actually taste  Literally no taste distinction cause identify actual Ox Tail chilli  could turkey all know  Literally tastes your traditional chilli asian inspired mayo over it  much fusion here   Miyagi burger actually good  burger executed nicely all flavors point  hate say also took solid 7 minutes even some service table  worst part only 2 other tables being served entire resturaunt time    I would rate both Food Service 6 5 10 across board!   Unfortunately probably wont dining again  $98 meal waited years just left unsatisfied  <EOR> Did late night takeout order ordered Bah Mi burger my favorite burger decided order oxtail chili cheese fries  really enjoyed burger but oxtail chili cheese fries didn't really satisfy palate  tasted little sweet beans over powered taste oxtail  ordered because all rave reviews but wasn't satisfied  Maybe just try restaurant instead doing take it    give another try    <EOR> This place very good! burgers cooked perfectly good vibe going on! drink Whiskey Mint BEST Cocktail had!! sure back check other items list! <EOR> Met couple friends here  Casual atmosphere take reservations   Ronin Burger good but great  Expected more all reviews   group Sweet Potato fries Salt Pepper fries regular fries Ronin Burger Crab Sandwich   Overall consensus OK but outstanding expected   Service good extensive boba soda drink menu  Skip Bachi BurGR if only time burger joint town don't mind strip   probably also bother going Bachi Burger opening Westwood when town since Father's Office 25 Degrees many other much better burger places LA  <EOR> Oh Bachi burger seen Guy Fieri's Diners Drive Ins Dives truly looked world! But sadly experience still world would rather enjoy Guy's actual restaurant see previous review We arrived Vegas Saturday came just 11 00am opening time already packed house waiting patrons! seemed good sign! The interior simple modern asian esqu themed bamboo wood but calming atmosphere    Our waitress nice friendly gave suggestions items  today ordered following Shogun burger wagyu beef unagi foie gras poached asian pear miso butter Yamamoto peach overall $26 think burger ridiculously overpriced   the beef i wagyu before very bland overcooked sauce around good however foie gras virtually minimal unagi gone bite peach very interesting eat first though sweet! bun fresh soaked flavors nicely overall 3 5 burger  oxtail chili fries very good but could better fries nicely cooked chili delicious! oxtail tender mounded over everything! egg tiny gone two bites garlic aioli also enough  pork belly bao came three menu stated came boiled egg cilantro scallions hoisin bbq vinaigrette well no egg no scallion almost no cilantro   the sauce good but overall definitely good boa  kale salad okay   mom ordered did try it  chili fried chicken probably best dish all chili garlic ginger spicy juicy flavorful 5 5!  Overall think Bachi kinda overrated especially original location expected lot more MAYBE return LA locations closer home <EOR> I rarely give 5 stars but place awesome!   I've twice already last time kiki burger   Fries delicious love sauce comes it    Def would come again! <EOR> My friend recommended place GREAT  gourmet burgers different delicious  Edamame Soybean Stir fried Garlic Ginger Chili  asian flair ginger chili oil but very good  Truffle Parmesan Fries also good really liked Sun Dried Tomato Aioli came with  gotten Ronin Burger which very good  bit much cole slaw but still good  also KiKi Burger which really liked  <EOR> Great food  Happening environment  love burgers  Very juicy tasty  place portion control though  Definitely back  also Summerlin location too  <EOR> I've coming place since day opened  absolutely LOVE place  watched evolution place  almost everything menu  always quality service when food top notched  If you're true foodie need try place out  different take burgers other american classics prepared  feel open mindset when coming here  think people given poor quality reviews necessarily understood fusion cuisine works  OK! trending place see whether burgers oxtail fries even Shoku menu continue grow succeed  <EOR> The food nothing special price pay  truffle fries pretty good but  it   Not sure if location specifically but service horrible  time when wasn't busy server nowhere found most time  When she did deign come table she rude would reach over grab things without asking if done then sulk off when told still working it    Wanted try place longest let down when finally did  <EOR> Edamame beans soaked garlic ginger chili!!

Service pretty good first visit when busy able seat until enough patrons left them combine some tables seat large party   But second visit service started good but kind down hill that   didn't took much longer expected food almost 20 minutes slow night dropping off check requested server basically ignored me   guess chatting coworker folding napkins whatever he doing side station more important processing payment credit card intended use change   end just paid cash walked door course when startled look eyes if wondering if am skipping town without settling tab     I am sure if people complained when less positive comments service here  just don't understand why servers need provide good service can't finish strong take process payment customer trying pay  work debt collection agency cold call people list hating negativity job procrastinate   Food 4 stars  Service 1 4 stars  Seems better when large group when busy but really sucks when slow ended crappy waiter   Anyway still giving Bachi Burger 4 stars food   But if back alone rather just deal issue again leaving tip when really don't feel leaving any  would recommend Oxtail Chili Fries even though served sunny side egg top and love that! unless costs less more oxtail  <EOR> Went first time other day  pleasantly surprised tasty everything was!
