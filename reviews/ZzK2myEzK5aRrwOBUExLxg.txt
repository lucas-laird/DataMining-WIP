It awful So disappointing  came during lunch time thought would never pay amount money quality food  I would prefer complimentary cereal breakfast from othet hotels   Pasta Pizza only thing would pay but taste below expectation  I pay some more better quality buffet  <EOR> Disappointing Breakfast  Read place can't remember where but good recommendation  am giving 3 service atmosphere patio  food flat 1  Vegas buffet experience looking for  <EOR> Good simple buffet breakfast everything warm kept with    Nice atmosphere good customer service   Buffet located Tropicana  <EOR> Price $33 per person   Variety lower expected  dessert section extremely generous chocolate chips   pasta pizza section chef didnt give small portion requested it looked full plate pasta   sauces broke  The two seafood bowls good although seafood each small  rest seafood so so  The meats so so  <EOR> Staff very kind helpful but food pretty bad  Salad station baked potato chicken thighs only decent things  pasta station highly recommended but pasta hard guy made Alfredo sauce tons tons chunks garlic sorry   But friend also pasta few other things he hardly ate  Ice cream came runny machine  Unfortunately lunch dinner very good buffet  <EOR> Ate lunch dinner recently both meals comped since vip there   Even comps feel buffet very overpriced limited items  weekday dinner $32 lunch $27 lunch definitely better option two   I flew vegas late hungry but didn't want wait food decided try dinner buffet  Place pretty dead maybe 3 tables noticed guy prime rib carving area  Salad station decent but no fruits other whole oranges apples banana  hell wants eat whole fruits buffet? Would prefer if sliced melons some sort fruit salad   They huge baked potato area am filling baked potato prefer mashed potatoes control portions   love mac cheese but mac cheese very bland seems try fancy adding fancy white cheese more bland   also way many variations quarter chicken dish over bed rice  didn't much asian station night   I think saving grace freshly made pasta pizza station   chef bake pizza cook pasta front your liking   told cook chicken shrimp alfredo pasta he did very good it  Unfortunately portion size bit large but finished but pretty full afterwards   know probably lot other people eats less half rest thrown away   To better utilize station should just convert pre cooked pizza slices pasta station   Smaller slices popular pizza toppings tubs pasta dishes  dessert section quite limited bit disappointing   need add something looks fresh bread pudding   Lunch much better seafood paella tuna salmon sweet sour pork etc   Everything tasted more fresh but when first opened      Overall think buffet improve over time tinker menu   would hope see more asian dishes possibly some sushi future  <EOR> Definitely worth price breakfast buffet  Food sub par bit it'll do  Okay food better no food  would advise going many choices  <EOR> We came lunch  open noon Saturday's  ended waiting 20 minutes  Once paid daughter seated  free voucher two adults free! bad! Price adult $24 94 something that  worth amount food serve    They items such fried rice stuffed red peppers meat rice  enjoyed but much selection  even salad ranch corn cob potstickers  food vanilla ice cream small tiramisu  Good but much choose dessert section    The soda fountain Pepsi products which another negative me  ended getting strawberry iced tea   They even juices coffee station  bad but wasn't impressed    There's seating inside outside but windy outside  sat inside window view  buffet just okay  <EOR> The place good intentions wait staff friendly attentive  But beyond isn't much more rave about    We dinner around 7 all food laying looked if good while untouched  know crusty layer formed pools oil gathering around edges  exactly appetizing    We started pasta station since figured least would fresh  decent  Nothing little butter spoonful garlic can't fix  cook added both pan before adding sauce noodles    Dessert huge let down  mean if 2 year old doesn't want eat dessert then really must something wrong it    Honestly if dinner wasn't comped wouldn't gone probably won't back unless read reviews say changed since today's visit  <EOR> $34 95 pp Sat night dinner! Buffet very small  Main course prime rib small pasta bar  Only three four dessert choices  cant believe renovated months offer this  $5 99 9 99 buffet best  only upside they're open until 10pm  <EOR> Breakfast buffet    Everything would expect    Good coffee omelet bar plenty fresh fruit  $22   Includes soda coffee juice  <EOR> Entirely disappointing  Decor nice employees  But food cold dry old limited way way overpriced  Only worthwhile thing made to order pasta station  Hard imagine charging $30 something inferior smaller your nasty neighborhood Golden Corral  <EOR> This place joke wouldn't eat again BTW meal comped    Was breakfast selection very limited plates difficult locate everything self serve    For $22 per person many better options available  <EOR> Breakfast cake w room wasn't awful  But wouldn't pay $22 per person own drinks! spoons cereal oatmeal unless used coffee spoon cleaned  Found dirty cups clean found broken cup too  Always happens me   This little hot breakfast buffet   no real variety   omelet per order nice touch   I think rather Texas station $9 lot more less   If pay never came <EOR> Hotel made good visit   Based exceptional customer service updated stars!
