I ordered hamburger steak favorite foods  really excited see huge hamburger patty size your face huge  cut into coloring kind funny   inspected better come conclusion 98% patty consisted some type filler  bread maybe? no idea color breakfast sausage patties  feel kind grossed eating this  see areas where actually hamburger compare filler  don't understand why anyone would audacity hamburger patty way  am extremely disappointed still hungry grossed out  Hamburger Steak recommended hamburger  <EOR> Sometimes wait bit some katsu   but place good     stip loco moco katsu almost weekly lunch     <EOR> Good Food!

Anyway longanisa isn't your traditional Filipino style longanisa sad face  knew right when delivered table  thought maybe would similar Portuguese sausage but leaned more towards hot dog sweet hot dog if any sense  wasn't bad but wasn't expecting   The venue itself located plaza close UNLV across street helllooooo Starbucks which freakin' drive through WINNING!! YELP came through!! peeps able roll through Starbucks right before hitting Aloha Kitchen happily fulfilled caffeine requirement day! Parking easy venue clean  huge location but ample seating good customer flow  Speaking which looks Aloha Kitchen agrees local law enforcement saw several uniforms occupying few tables   Aloha Kitchen probably good cure hangover if you're just straight hangry not  Come full still probably stuff your face  Just sure before 10pm location closes earlier other location   Enjoy! <EOR> Honestly before really enjoyed first time but last time    how keep running fried chicken?

Since no attempt fresh rice made cook's expression burden  Really? What's hard cooking made order eggs put cooked chicken it  Well when finally destination hubby open food why rice pork it? am very disappointed! <EOR> This place great! bento box never disappointed  lunch dinner staff always nice  favorite places Las Vegas  definitely recommend it  <EOR> Perfect large small groups able accommodate large group 17 friends but wait food accordingly   The service great aside cashier girl seeming new she kept having ask someone question but able order everything fine  bring your food there's self serve water station corner!  I ordered miso soup chicken teriyaki both because smaller side food  food ok bit salty though  <EOR> This place used favorite  But anymore  family used eat twice day more when come vacation  Now steer clear one  food qualiy par awhile  only aloha kitchen sahara now  bad used love place  read recent reviews maryland food quality C  <EOR> First time really trying Hawaiian food don't much compare but tell enjoyed it  Loco Moco which sounds amazing theory but little bit much ordered it essentially burger meat topped gravy egg rice  friends Adobo which more popular dishes which omelet filled rice  would recommendation if you're fan things  Katsu great either  Yes tried everyone's food   The kids working young nice offering pretty good service smile  came back few days later quick to go order macaroni salad spam musubi took twenty minutes  place does bit busy but could definitely little more efficient orders  <EOR> This favorite places breakfast brunch      servings large food amazing     services fast staff very friendly  Banana Pancakes favorite     just melts your mouth  Kalbi combo amazing too  katsu cooked perfectly macaroni salad just perfect  <EOR> I fried noodles didn't it   mostly cabbage   kamaboko spam   big fried noodle person there's disappointed me   mahi also more fish Jhun   thought would've made panko   However did Uncle works there   he reminded back home uncle's are   <EOR> Okay til today I'd say liked place   sometimes over Ross J's Aloha Grill   There     said it   reason? Well really love Korean Chicken Teriyaki bowl Ross J's   its only $3 50 plus give extra sauce if ask   free charge      alternate between Aloha Kitchen's Chicken Teriyaki bowl several following reasons 1 The sauce Ross J's bit salty side   AK sweeter sauce  2 really good service AK when study UNLV=convenience  3 portions more adequate   The chicken rice bowl well Local plate Why now down 2 star rather 4 5 star book ?         Local plate no longer comes RICE! WTH? really nice just offered rice made point pay side portion rice cool them   But quite taken back explanation why place no longer adds rice $7 59 combination plate menu says all combos served rice mac salad don't add rice anymore because put rice musubi! Okay  first all   if going offer spam musubi  it comes rice its own   it isn't good business try skim customers clearly printed all menus   don't advertise plate spam masubi give customers spam tell them pay extra rice you? Vice versa   you shouldn't sell something spam musubi say rice now counted part dish portion rice always included no longer included! employee nice told she told management change menu   Problem rationale excluding rice now irrational    I always happy paying extra 50 cents extra sauce although Ross J's never charged because liked much wanted support business   But today feel disappointed place     Lastly ordered Mixed vegetables friend   opened container really disappointed version mixed vegetables   only cabbage few strands onion    $1 99 mixed veggies    think if going charge price  at least add few types veggies  broccoli bean sprouts    carrots  something  not just plain cabbage costs pennies dollar   If area sort Hawaiian food    the portion okay   decent flavor its still way better L L   Unfortunately don't place does business    Ross J's=You still #1 favorite    Thumbs down    <EOR> We ordered spam musubi kalbi combo plate  place definitely quality quantity point   prices food items definitely reasonable  ordered kalbi combo plate came bbq chicken kbbq beef which flat didn't even any striations meat bbq beef  combo plate comes 2 scoops rice choice macaroni salad kimchi   Spam musubi point give satiate your hunger  <EOR> You really can't wrong place  Great service good food affordable prices  usually come student special chicken teriyaki bowl which comes drink  All under $5!!!
