Yes willing try other dishes but exactly rushing so    <EOR> Their service excellent! think boss very engaging helped guide through menu  why only 3 stars ask?  Some food great! But some meh   Lets start takoyaki  didn't original because home  tried smoked salmon recommendation server  AMAZING! think takoyaki favorite plates  only different normal takoyaki but flavor point! only thing missing crispy outside  kinda crispy suppose but think time little soggy already  Insides nice yummy though aside that    So bit disappointed when didn't see clams unagi dumplings menu but saw photos looked bomb  just assumed didn't serve anymore BUT told off menu but it! super excited  clams also better menu items! delicious sauce covered clams    mmmm    just thinking want some more! assuming unagi dumplings just sauce? didn't recognize texture unagi them  could wrong but still tastes delicious   We brussel sprouts too  Although loved crispy texture well cooked vinegar way sour just ruined taste them  sour please skip item    We also foie gras okonomiyaki   mixed feelings one  All together tasted good  But felt okonomiyaki missing something  probably best town still honest aside home made  But think because sweet? probably sweet because offset foie gras's saltiness  when eat all together bite its great! But just small piece top then you're eating rest sweet okonomiyaki    I'd probably give guys another try because I'd try other items  bathroom btw decorated interestingly  <EOR> Let's start top menu Yasai    amazing range flavors!

However every dish tried lacked any subtle harmony ingredients more fusion gratuitous salt heavy flavors anything truly even remotely Japanese  would say Japanese inspired given names concepts but its heart American restaurant    Some things stood particular  seafood okonomiyaki does actually well seafood  uni topping top yes  fresh creamy perfect  However reason okonomiyaki pork octopus squid  no fat flavoring seafood offset work other ingredients traditional okonomiyaki     The white anchovy takoyaki tried really hard blend lot unique flavors together end anchovy flavor just strong work any them    There triple garlic pasta menu used dried garlic instead fresh minced little disappointing well  garlic strong hoping emphasis would bring more its flavor out    The best thing actually soft serve dessert  All them sounded unique able enjoy lot    The service also good  waitress attentive informative  kitchen completely open see them cooking prepping  noticed big bag green onions but worker washing them before prepping though might just where sitting? Didn't taste find anything wrong those dishes least  <EOR> I good time here  place definitely fun  Old school hip hop  Food tasty beer cold  <EOR> Couple white dudes cooking Japanese izakaya dishes   this could horribly horribly wrong especially Vegas     But didn't   guys serving classic pub dishes takoyaki okonomiyaki   wrong hands dishes tragically bad them total justice then some   good any Japan fact all food perfectly cooked seasoned totally exceeded expectations   Limited but well chosen sake list   everything neighborhood restaurant should be  <EOR> This place fun  just saying because cool hip hop aesthetic  Paid Full offers revolving menu Japanese tapas surprising unique flavor combinations  even cheap beer roulette!
