They best fast food french fries world   No seriously   No really   YES!  Most business take out small place always easily accommodate dine customers   Customers option order wings online over phone pick up   A few tips Unless soggy chicken wouldn't recommend boneless wings boneless strips   great chunks chicken breast but sauces really sogg breading just sort cause them bleh out  Atomic should come surgeon general's warning   love hot spicy foods but ridiculous  <EOR> This location #1 only food quality but customer service  am always greeted smile soon walk through doors  food always hot ready when pick flavors always savory  going Wingstop location almost three years now let tell never disappoint  Every employee cashiers manager always polite welcoming   DONT EVEN STARTED VOODO FRIES  DIE FOR! <EOR> Love wings love service  Easy phone ordering ready when there  I'd give 5 stars   too good pass up  <EOR> I drive tow truck all over but wing stop nellis seems fresh wings always back <EOR> This those places where stuff your face  conveniently located near east suburbs  go to never dissapoints  Service getting better  expanded into neighbor's location now way more dining space  other reviewers commented only downside wait sometimes  order ahead come prepared it  Otherwise best location town  <EOR> Really good!

The service particular location pretty slow  waited little over 20 minutes food still 1 more order fries wait for  girl working said she would bring when ready but almost done wings when finally decided ask where last order fries were    Overall great wings   but slow service! <EOR> I give star customer service homeless man roaming around begging money no paying attention  Also spent over 35$ don't cups water but Homeless man drinks free own dirty bottle  Food good though  <EOR> Its over tear since tried wing stop say quitr dissapointed never location but taste seemed very diluted parmesan seasoned wings   I stick buffalo wild wings  But other then food wing stop gets extra star good customer service  <EOR> Order mostly online often times door  Food great services down but again am barely long enough complain  Recommend any wing lovers! <EOR> When came chairs covering half side dine in only 11 10 close 12 don't know why they're fixing close soon  felicia didn't take order correctly asked 8 plain boneless  7 boneless Mango habanero  received 10 plain 5 habanero  but difference but I'd payed for  Another thing waited  22 minutes boneless wings when regular waiting time 11 minutes  didn't greet say bye usually didn't recurve best customer service  <EOR> I am wing eater only kind eat bbq place would rank # 1 town flavor amazing blue chesse dressing or ranch heaven  <EOR> Favorite Wing Stop Location Las Vegas because Wings always point customer service excellent too! Management always making sure customers happy always appreciated <EOR> Just tried Wing stop honest all delicious  Spicy Korean Garlic Parmesan both mediocre rip off 8 little chicken nuggets  If suggest getting bone in instead boneless  Also fries terrible  <EOR> I ordered wings picked time off work way home   when ready me   place really clean alot space atmosphere very welcoming   only drawback when speaking young lady counter really can't hear because tvs noise meals being prepped  think maybe need shut part off eliminate some extra noise when speaking someone counter     I didn't any combo meals because didn't want fries sitting although wings ready when arrive but fries probably wouldn't cold   ordered 20 piece boneless wings alone ordered 10 hot 10 Louisiana cajun rub   wings pretty descent size but nothing big Buffalo Wild Wings but weren't little   hot wings pretty good since first time trying Louisiana rub pretty good too   However them seemed much salt them probably Louisiana rub   tolerance salt significantly reduced because high blood pressure big salt fan anymore   sure if actually salty just taste buds   SInce closest house probably returning service alone which long way me   usually prefer other wing place Buffalo Wild Wings because wings alot bigger meatier  <EOR> This location takes forever give food every time come here  boyfriend insists coming every time though hate because always end waiting well over 30 40 mins food  last time placed order picked wouldn't wait long when arrived food still ready  waited 45 more minutes which ridiculous if called order until finally asked cashier happened order  Turned lost ticket kitchen basically waiting nothing  last time coming here  food great waiting 40 mins for  <EOR> I usually BWW but Wingstop now!

This particular location smaller then previously but still great operation   staff super friendly welcoming   small seating area some TVs watch during lunch   nice place grab fast lunch quickly   The boneless chicken wings delightful especially Louisiana Rub flavored ones   YUMMY!  tried pretty much all flavors don't think wrong any them   lemon pepper flavor quite interesting though   usually few those mix just because such unique flavor   actually dream boneless wings Wingstop   know good when dream food!  fries too   sweet salty seasoning them them tasty   I haven't eaten instead usually put huge take away order bring back mom's house   Yep  right mom addicted Wingstop 3 times past month   Ha ha! <EOR> Two small orders 6 8 piece took over 40 minutes! WTF! Good food but sure worth wait  <EOR> This favorite WingStop location  No matter busy customer service never falls below five star  Super friendly staff  Wings always fresh orders always correct whether take dine in  It's smaller locations if you're planning watching any games inside early! <EOR> My go to when any kind chicken wing typically boneless wing mild hot sauce  Suffice say Wing Stop provide when feel it  However think BWW beats Wing Stop boneless category  If you're going Wing Stop definitely bone in  massive lots 'o meat! Very different most chicken wings   On last trip box half wings mild other half lemon pepper it's rub did based off Melia S 's review  Well luckily wasn't disappointed  really did enjoy lemon pepper but unfortunately mild wings barely any sauce them! Most sauce pooled bottom container  Kind disappointing   I yummy french fries past but last time fries location kinda soggy good  guess just gotta them right time something    Also last thing ranch very thin goopy mean goopy good way when chicken wing want ranch STICK roll off!   Overall Wing Stop good fix if need those chicken wings! <EOR> This location wingstop closest home  excited expanded location  No more standing ovation sitting car while waiting wings  haven't actually dined always take order to go   Staff okay  They're somewhere between friendly unfriendly if there's such thing    lol Sometimes feel welcome times just cold  Everytime attempt order over phone always put hold forever most time end just ordering person   I no complaints wings always good yummy saucy!!! Bone lemon pepper cajun faves! <EOR> I normally don't eating fried foods because greasiness but guess ok once while  would rather call next time   The service ok mean gave enough time see wanted when ready still waiting couple minutes  Nothing bad complain but  happened   I ordered 3 chicken strip meal parmesan garlic usually i'd hot mild sometimes   The atmosphere cool filled airplane parts couple tv's which wasn't shabby   The flavor alright although taste parmesan garlic wasn't strong texture semi crunchy if dry although small bits little soggy fries just seemed kinda greasy soft but did salt sweet taste ranch really rich creamy though  did multi drinks mixer but just water   maybe next time try lemonade   Between wingstop wings n things would wings n things  But Wingstop definitely contender  <EOR> I am addicted place! proud say but best wings town  other locations aren't even good  usually come least once week  staff extra friendly always feel welcome  restaurant always clean every since expanded more seating  customer well long live Vegas  Keep good work  Love place  <EOR> This store remodeled double seating capacity  Thank we'll done  Besides beers bottle also Coke Freestyle machines 100's soft drink choices available  Which great all ages  My favorite boneless wings carrots celery blue cheese dip veggies  Sauce flavor favorites Hickory smoked BBQ Cajun traditional Hot wing sauce top list  I eaten several times never bad experience  coming back  Atmosphere casual always play sports TV TV's every wall  This place gets busy plan ahead if going during big game during dinner rush  I would recommend place others  Obviously menu just chicken which great me  stick doing 1 thing well  <EOR> 'Garlic Parmesan' boneless wings way greasy opinion    Don't wanna sound picky but fries kinda salty well but  probably just me   Nonetheless enjoyed 'summer deal' 20 bucks 20 wings 2 drinks 2 fries lady! Beast mode lol  always craving days having it   Boneless wings ftw   Oh love remodeling did makin place look way more spacious welcoming   Wingstop wins <EOR> It's nearly impossible find good wings Vegas  place decent sauces but they're way overpriced some tiny wings no meat them  <EOR> This usual wing place but recently getting order wrong being short wings come back let girl counter know she just takes receipt walks back no smile no apology just oh    need work customer service <EOR> This place good chicken great   always lemon lime fries die yes said   always love servers great attitude actually interact all time feel  comfortable   place always clean  Also <EOR> I always come never problem  Today boyfriend signed wingstop club email stating free fries any purchase   When didn't print because voucher print coupon manager duty Vanessa refused honor coupon  She even noticed did state print coupon still didn't honor it  honestly worse service ever received wingstop  Please aware print fries coupon else accept ! <EOR> This place open until Midnight everyday! at least North Las Vegas location better wings Buffalo Wild Wings prices reasonable  also cool beverage dispenser where mix match all different types sodas  Probably over 60 drinks   You boneless classic bone in wings following amounts 8pc $6 49 2 flavors 12pc $9 69 2 flavors 20pc $15 99 2 flavors 30pc $23 99 3 flavors 50pc $39 99 4 flavors They also family packs meals two  www wingstop com  Wing Flavors Top down hottest mild ATOMIC I warn you    don't even unless want prank someone lol CAJUN ORIGINAL HOT LOUISIANA RUB MILD HICKORY SMOKED BBQ probably favorite LEMON PEPPER I recommend dry seasoning though GARLIC PARMESAN HAWAIIAN TERIYAKI <EOR> A bit crowded but definitely worth wait  better yet take order  Friendly staff amazing chicken wings!!!! <EOR> My main reason come try garlic parmesan  prefer boneless over bone their's double size Buffalo Wild Wings huge plus!
