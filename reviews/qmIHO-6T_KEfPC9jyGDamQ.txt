But warned full dinner experience two ran $425 dollars  <EOR> I'll start brief description food but then retell story worst service think ever received tried scam $200   The appetizers sides pretty good variety offer  Some sides carrots potato options very good actually  salads ok best  I Jean Georges work group maybe 8 us  all steaks which overcooked  wasn't enough send back anyone but all overcooked I actually don't mind medium steak being bit overdone anyway   Food wise would say ok but better options especially price range   The reason Jean Georges gets STAR because service scam tried pull  asked bottle dessert wine which listed menu $60 which normal price wine  some confusion exact year quality being ordered because menu did give quality wines scored 3 7 sweetness but eventually waitress found wine confirmed expected  When bill came tried charge $250 wine OUTRAGEOUS price    We told waitress she made mistake she brought menu back made some story wine ordered different listed which 1 entirely false 2 never told thought different wine  If restaurant under impression they're serving wine  different what's ordered serve without telling anyone?! waitress refused reasonable asked talk manager  great deal arguing manager seemed imply menu wrong insisted $250 price  Eventually manager simply gave charged correct $60 price but firstly should comping $60 dessert wine 8 person meal over $1 000 anyway! such ordeal good service says comp wine then!   We all left feeling frustrated insulted  <EOR> Tomahawk steak foie gras bone marrow made delicious decadent meal  Highly recommend  Only drawback pretty unreasonably expensive is  $100 steak better typical $50 ribeye high end steakhouse  <EOR> The ambiance nice here   located aria resort casino strip   restarant upper level way circue du coliel Elvis  better reservations before coming  Sometimes during year request week advance   It's really dark mostly lit candlelight photographer takes couple pictures going table table   My boyfriend took 1 year anniversary each ordered appetizers tomato bisque cessation salad chili powder entree filers mignon rib eye cut steak dessert which looked normal but tasted amazing chocolate lava cake sour cherry cheesecake   appitizers good but nothing special 4 star dining  filers mignon very tender very easy eat   My rib eye cut cooked perfectly medium rare came miso cream sauce really great bernaise side   They also give basket if breads your meal  pretzels bread great very fresh soft  flatbreads well appetizers    I would say desserts amazing  surprised good tasted because looked normal plate  cheesecake very moist soft great flavor did molten chocolate lava cake!

If want good meal many other choices  Why here? your sake urge AVOID PLACE  <EOR> The business manager pretends care yelp but when he asked email didn't hear back days when finally did very passive aggressive email  Even responded condescending email didn't even hear back  only did waste time money when but then decided waste even more time pseudo caring  didn't update review until now because would've cost much energy let them waste any more time back then  <EOR> Four came eat 3 weeks ago   Overall service pretty good   We ordered 2 steaks fish few appetizers   Overall bill came $500 without drinks   Well place caliber food just ok   I don't know rave all reviews  only conclusion people haven't enough good steak house cause place definitely measure other steak houses  Let say if u gonna eat u might well just Ruth Chris save your mullah  <EOR> Came first time say disappointed food all! ordered tomato salad wagyu carpaccio rack American lamb Chilean sea bass  all excellent! am big fish fan but husband ordered bass trying fell love!

As said BIG disappointment  <EOR> This great experence final dinner  co workers celebrate successful business trip did disappoint!  The Aria all thier restaurants tucked back corner being center  Walking dark swanky resturant entire dinner experence   We started some shrimp cocktail tuna tartar tomato mozzarella salad  All fantastic but shrimp cocktail fantastic 2 sauces brought it   Up next dinners  ordered sea bass lobster NY strip then steak special Australian Tomahawk Ribeye  Photo included because just funny! full bone rib  sure  roasted potatos truffle Mac cheese Brussel sprouts sides  All food wine great  wish rosé glass though  only reason 4 stars 5 waiter little friendly  expect service little more understated but times when he just friendly  trying finish conversations but he taking long banter   Other everything fantastic!! <EOR> We seated quickly wonderful table  servers suggestions wine list great  ordered lot food four order try little everything  serving sizes small which server warned off  Food good great  service worst part  Dirty appetizer dishes sat table 15 minutes  Empty wine glasses would filled own but bottle left anywhere near table standard nice restaurant if someone refilling! Bottom line food isn't good enough overlook bad service  <EOR> Jean George's Steakhouse favorite good buddy mine when he hits Vegas often drop dinner drinks  few times really style room quality steaks    We started most recent trip bar couple martinis  Very well made very friendly service bartender  mentioned having dinner inside he offered bill transferred but paid man didn't want lose tip  only waited 5 minutes table ready    It seems every time dine Jean George's tasting menu where food selections  great price around $80 4 courses jalapeno relish foie gras course really dig  often add menu additional side item appetizer but find lot restaurant  food great t he steaks main course always prepared just way ask exceptional flavor    I say over past few times ben service consistent  service staff handles food always seems bit 'ho hum' service style  casual nature friendly demeanor both things which appreciate server   but just kind lack interest maybe? Could amongst busiest places ARIA Hotel maybe just no time personal service? never leaves impressed but  just me    I say Sommelier's bar staff always extremely friendly attentive service   Every bottle wine attended properly  never glass empty even less plenty add dining room situated don't feel ever undesirable table  most recent trip sitting against glass room held wall wine restaurant  really nice space   I would most definitly back Jean Georges again very good food atmosphere  say start bar good stiff drink great bottle wine your steaks! Happiest Eating! <EOR> Ehh 3 5 stars when compared other big steak houses such Prime Morton's 5+ stars opinion   quality prices don't quite align  porterhouse good but great $150 some pieces fatty chewy  meat didn't quite melt mouth does Prime Morton's   I would HIGHLY recommend tuna tartare squash soup Chilean sea bass portion size palm but LOADED flavor   hand cut fries definitely handcut frozen idk why serve them there   The presentation items very unique creative which added overall experience   The atmosphere great modern some hip music playing background service excellent   Again 3 5 stars relative Prime Morton's <EOR> OMG top table amazing place! Noah Schwartz Phil Helmuth house  If follow pro poker know! all steak joints measured against  Grade 5 Kobe kidding me  serves that? If follow foodie code know heaven  find better  enjoyed standard    Shrimp cocktail filet creamed spinach mashed chocolate lava  Perfection  Yup heaven  <EOR> I thought I'd written review long ago   Having business dinner husband's clients he decided Jean Georges Steakhouse Aria would locale  Having eaten twice previously pleased due positive food experience   We arrived around 6 30 Wednesday stood bar cocktails ordered hand awaiting last couple join party  Once arrived seated back room formally called Board Room   Our server two additional servers arrive more cocktails wine ordered appetizer orders placed  ordered variable bevy appetizers menu mixture cold hot  couple iced towers raw seafood giant prawns mussels crab legs very firm delicious  couple platters sushi calamari then couple salads I ordered Caesar avocado bad but dressing quite bland extremely creamy    Loads different meals ordered ginger miso sea bass which huge size flavor quite scrumptious  husband ordered rib eye steak side asparagus  He commented good  dinner mates ordered same rib eye but someone else ordered Kobe streak salmon wagyu carpaccio believe someone just salad salmon  Other sides Mac n cheese which personally didn't try but noted good creamed spinach yuck French fries Brussel sprouts baked potato   Desserts fine nothing striking  ordered apple pie skillet dry very tantalizing chocolate lava cake tiny also dry bit bland boring couple scoops cherry sorbet yummy cranberry sorbet best thing and don't really love sweets vanilla ice cream hot fudge poured over   Service opinion attentive fast although person commented server should known more different cuts meat  Boo boo   Ambience very dark sleek sexy would good date night trying impress clients   Dinner 10 people plus couple bottles wine few cocktails 4 glasses grappa like foul smelling foul tasting grape lighter fluid digestif believe $1600 tip included  Common price establishment such Jean Georges   Would return  <EOR> Come for oysters bone marrow truffle mac cheese Skip foie gras brussel sprouts  Foie gras ok but lychee made way sweet  Filet mignon strainy quality top steakhouse  Brussel sprouts more nuts veggies  Truffle mac cheese bone marrow really good   The server order wrong guest honor but he worked really hard things right since didn't time wait new order made  Props service working us  <EOR> One best steakhouse's to  Food amazing  If service half good food would've gotten 5 stars  Started crispy sushi sampler definitely table favorite appetizer  Austrian Wagyu bone Ribeye literally melted mouth  Blue cheese wedge salad very good  All sides also amazing Garlic mash potatoes best Brussel sprouts Mac n cheese amazing  <EOR> I give Jean Georges 5 star simply sea bass  amazing best fish dish ever had  visited several times always order it  tasted steaks good but level sea bass  If come steak but also fish want dish remember really need try sea bass  <EOR> Ridiculously over priced mediocre food  Ordered filet medium came cold over done  better steak Outback Casper WY week before  Can't imagine ever going back  <EOR> Good food horrible service  expect top notch service when dining supposedly top notch restaurant   Sat group table practically falling off hinges  offered move smaller set tables where all sat line versus circle   so declined  Called manager over he best indifferent  Taking business somewhere else next time     too bad <EOR> After taste Sage continued journey Julian Serrano part two tasting tour Aria  stand around wait hostess Julian Serrano never came  resort casino plenty other high end restaurants willing take money left wandered upstairs try Jean George located second floor above casino next Sirio Michael Mina which promptly assisted us   Obviously skipped appetizers straight into main course which $90 steak special Wagyu like Australian tomahawk chop think bone in rib eye dark fatty outer cap trimmed   embarrassing piece meat  steak lacked everything you'd expect cut beef  missed flavor fattiness tenderness   Then steak sauces  purist believes steak sauce needed bad flavorless steaks  really good steak perfection its own  Even though tomahawk heavily seasoned charred create flavor five different steak sauces served  isn't McDonald's Chik Fil A where customers choice dipping sauces chicken nuggets  chef should decision pick sauce fits flavor profile cuisine  Instead colorful Benetton nation sauces airy French hollandaise bright refreshing Mexican salsa verde overly sweet BBQ sauce super hot southwestern scotchbonnet mellow Asian tamarind  Aside BBQ sauce all expertly executed but none good matches steak   The sides thankfully small decent sized person  tried two sides  Brussels sprouts pear bacon forceful zing  itself sprouts dry very exciting but acidity helped contract fattiness beef  mushrooms goat cheese polenta disaster  second greasy overcooked polenta night  mushrooms sadly dried out tough   The Mollydooker South Australian Shiraz glass very nice wine well suited evening   For dessert glass Moscati di Asti fine match cinnamon crème brulee cocoa nibs figs bottom  use cinnamon brulee very smart decision  can't believe other chefs haven't done this  seems completely obvious combination but guess when something obvious easy think it  <EOR> First good Great service cool room  restaurant different level casino floor   Now bad food terrible   Sea bass over cooked salty send back  wife NY strip ordered replace fish   cooked evenly little dry   know steak houses use laser check temperature  If your job working grill steakhouse should able cook perfect steak sight touch   Come restaurant Aria charging $50 entree shouldn't complaining preparation meal  <EOR> This beautiful dark steakhouse perfect group six

server attentive funny   All around great experience if you're okay spending some dollars  <EOR> I recently restaurant recommendation thought quite highly it  made reservation showed time took 3 5

The meal itself good enough being hubristically priced understand paying premium top quality cuts meat but reals guys    how straight face charge $14 POTATO? All did rub salt throw oven  over it!  Aside hi class potato petite filet which fine came some kind spicy chimichurri type sauce also truffle mac cheese SUPER rich almost rich enjoy spring greens salad which totally blanketed cheese barely tasted subtle deliciousness crunchy greens  Why thru all trouble sourcing organic sustainable whatever greens when you're just doing dump much cheese masks flavor? Weird  Everything over the top rich ended stuffed only couple bites steak   so dog enjoying rest  He said 5 stars but he doesn't much  Overall just fine  Moderately less pretentious other swanky steakhouses town    but certainly nothing exciting  would come again but only if someone else paying  <EOR> First all hour ordered food  Service slow  friends top priced item place prime rib cooked perfection just  rare un eatable!
