It Tex Mex style Mexican restaurant    Live mariachi music Friday night  band walks room room serenading enjoy your meal  <EOR> Friendly atmosphere servers   warm salsa nice switch food worth coming back   <EOR> I'm really excited new sit down Mexican restaurant opened side town  small chain Texas food good if atypical Southwestern style Mexican food  Los Cucos can't compete Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan but still pretty good eats great service    The interior strange rag tag looking atmosphere obviously space formerly inhabited MiMi's Cafe  Mardi Gras balcony still but now there's some sparse randomly placed Mexican decor lining walls  restaurant feels spacious open clean there's particularly nice open bar area right inside front door  place lacks character but pleasant enough atmosphere    I laugh menu because loaded misspellings crispi tacos romain lettuce some descriptions exactly same different items check special fajitas menu   When pointed server she couldn't explain nor tell which item correct description  eventually wanted but menu dish listed under two different names  You'd think chain restaurant menu would consistent and free spelling errors     As most Mexican eateries house serves complimentary chips salsa  chips good enough but served cold salsas DELICIOUS  seriously delicious  There's spicy smoky red salsa  served warm fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa  Both highlight meal am still craving them they'll return restaurant often     We ordered queso shrimp appetizer  $11 95 overpriced  cheese wasn't warm when served queso loaded red onions mushrooms other unnecessary stuff  shrimp seasoned well quite delicious however wouldn't order again    For lunch ordered chicken fajitas husband ordered steak fajitas  meat quality top notch  LOVED marinade both meats both agreed meat some best town  fajita vegetables just okay  onions poblano peppers  disappointed overall fajitas but I'd love just meat served its own  fajitas came loaded bacon cheese unusual very tasty combo  side plate huge so so beans average rice very tasty guacamole pico de gallo    Fatty alert serve homemade flour tortillas delicious! love Mexican restaurants care enough legit tortillas happy Los Cucos does right  could've eaten two dozen them! bummer aren't served tortilla warmers keep them soft but instead plopped table sandwiched between paper towels  means tortillas hard very quickly  Best gobble them soon possible!  After lunch Jesus manager came over ask enjoyed everything  He very eager please happy listen suggestions  very impressed personal touch efficient friendly service received    This isn't best Mexican food Vegas but kitchen uses very high quality ingredients prices most menu items fair service good  great place add dining rotation especially if live near Mountain's Edge Arroyo  <EOR> Oh lived Las Vegas 38 years become favorite Mexican restaurant  Where else fresh sea bass incredible sauce much eat $20? amazing!!!! <EOR> My first time already love it   everyone really nice welcoming  sat bar bartender awesome made best michelada  never mango he suggested no complaints     food came fast every bite amazing! definitely back eat again near future! <EOR> Food great  fresh made order love home made tortillas service excellent sever Maria great super helpful friendly definitely back recommend place anyone enjoys good Mexican food! <EOR> Great job everyone!!! pick food perfect   order prepared perfect   sauces all sealed plus!!!
