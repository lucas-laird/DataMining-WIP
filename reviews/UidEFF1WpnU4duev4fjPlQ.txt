Great vibe food top notch well service! Definitely try chicken meatballs Brussels sprouts  <EOR> Delicious food  Owner checks table  oxtail empanadas but cut them because full hot broth   Order everything social    Everything delicious but perhaps pass Salmon main course  Cooked well but good fish should never smell like   fish   Definitely chicken w lemon mashed potatoes white chocolate cheesecake!!! <EOR> I reserved table friend's birthday  Upon arrival only wait 4 minutes seated  hostess very pleasant   Once seated waiter arrived immediately but only ask if fourth person coming  replied yes before could ask cocktails he gone  He returned just fourth person arrived  all ordered drinks moderately prompt serving them us  cocktails come short glasses  pretty tasty  but believe little skimpy alcohol  No big deal  We ordered 2 appetizers small bites Dates Chicken Meatballs 2 entrees Chicken Salmon  40 minutes waiting waiter returned apologize delay large party upstairs  time wasn't upset because having good conversation   Several minutes later began irritated especially since empty drink  waiter returned 2 entrees but didn't offer refill drinks  1 entree incorrect but he returned corrected item 5 minutes later  10 minutes later entrees now cold he returned appetizers  probably most irritating part night  He did mention he wanted bring entrees didn't sit under heat lamps but appetizers simple should made before entrees  wanted order another drink another small bite but scared I'd wait another hour  expressed feelings wait he sent over manager gave 25% discount off entire bill  kind much appreciated  Overall vibe nice staff kind  just think cannot accommodate larger parties  Maybe off night short handed kitchen  give another try because overall food pretty tasty everyone pleasant could given circumstances  <EOR> Walked Yesterday around 720pm pretty slow  wasnt sure mood but great tv bar menu looked great  bud decided seat bar since host cool dude but when sat bar service changed   There female bartender approached guy  He carded which just ridiculous since he much younger then sat reading menus he never came back ask if wanted drinks food  bar 25% full when sat down he busy but he never approached bailed  guest maybe place just cool school  <EOR> Cute new restaurant downtown  little tasting work event enough tease good tease want come back more  taste carrot cake brown butter ice cream baked ricotta fig jam walnut cranberry crostini chicken meatball cilantro pesto gulf shrimp ceviche summer squash flatbread  upon arrival greeted delicious Cab  All very tasty!  Back lunch following day team lunch  hangar steak tartare which presentation cute liked pickled toppings  Street corn favorite!! If bacon popcorn mix different fun appetizer   I recommend if going lunch meal order burger French dip because price pay flatbread same more your money full sandwich   Seems little odd pay same giant good size burger French dip small flatbread  flatbread won't fill unless bunch other snacks  more pricey appetizer small plate middle section menu  good just meal if expecting think pricing little disproportionate   Otherwise great new option downtown  back try burger dessert! <EOR> Just best lunch here  would've taken picture chicken salad sandwich but ate fast  chicken fried chicken sandwich Caesar shrimp also great!

NEVER return  <EOR> Not exactly therapy looking for  Review only cocktails expecting better assessment bartender given name  Music good Bloody Mary average cocktails sweet  <EOR> I want really place because enjoy new dining options DTLV  However place just wasn't doing me  believe they're going through identity crisis? Though quite sure    I would say hostesses greeting guests very friendly welcoming bartender served however friendly only gets far    First took look beer wine list beer list quite extensive many questions different beers unfortunately bartender didn't know very much even know pronounce them  also server frozen drinks which thought bit odd considering all inside definitely isn't pool    Next many manager  owner type guys looming around maybe owned place maybe not   Now understand first night but none guys really seemed professionals weren't greeted them asked enjoyed ourselves anything  reason knew something place because seemed set shop corner bar doing work eating drinking it big glup type drink classy all view guests  If manager owner should greeting ever guest walking your door opening night just your buddies ask everyone doing    The food good actually rating review on  roasted cauliflower which favorites anywhere  super oily though probably wouldn't order again  summer squash flatbread great boyfriend really enjoyed oxtail empanadas  None dishes die but good   If place going more sports bar tapas experience then probably won't running back especially if owners managers carried themselves way did  <EOR> Service service SERVICE!
