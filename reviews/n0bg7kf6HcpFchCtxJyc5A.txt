Now want try other Mr Chows other cities well  <EOR> This place godawful  much potential top notch ambience private elevator feel VIP but food overpriced mediocre best  Tiny little plates supposed made sharing but just hike your bill  left feeling hungry disappointed  If can't nail steamed rice then can't nail Peking duck  <EOR> An astounding disappointment  8 dishes ordered loved only 1  rest mediocre best  dynamic light fixture main dining room which seems intended entertain hilariously lame did laugh there's that  Service good poor staff   <EOR> This best social hour Las Vegas  Definitely can't miss spot strip  go  <EOR> I am Chinese love food know food know authentic Chinese food stands fine Chinese food promises offer contemporary Chinese food aspires deliver   restaurant offers none those   But price tag astronomical   Peking duck package offered only party three more cost $76 person   part package choose certain numbers dishes appetizer selection entree selection   Just give some idea if Chinese restaurant China town just couple miles off Strip find very good Peking duck three different ways eat half price   Peking duck only offered package   If don't package order your meal la carte   way small plate Mr  Chow's noodle appetizer section signature dish restaurant hand crafted noodle which slightly different version zhangjiang mian cost $19 99 main entree selection most dishes range $40 few exceptions $30 range   If want rice vegetable $7 50 per person   top dishes no presentation small quantity very small tin plate maybe silver but really did look silver brought very cramped table  Now talking service saw more serving staff people dining restaurant   most dutiful person person filled drinks   son ordered pink lemonade   Every time glass left 1 3 lemonade he would presented another full glass lemonade  5 times   Other although more staffers diners took longer usual orders taken food served    And ambient kids said felt spaceship   restaurant very futuristic feel it   lighting fluorescent turning blue moon dropped down ceiling every 20 minutes   may cool but really did offer pleasant cozy dining experience  <EOR> Sorry but agree most other negative reviews here   frequently eat Chinese food many great local places Spring Mountain Rd   expected Mr  Chow blow away quality taste those places   However extremely disappointed!!  None dishes ordered Gamblers Duck Sautéed String Beans Dungeness Crab Appetizer would ever order again only really enjoyed dish Shrimp Spring rolls fried shrimp egg roll wrapper anyone that! I give kudos excellent attentive service beautiful dining room   But prices charge dinner five times Chinatown find some much tastier food  Dinner 2 1 drink each shared dessert over $200  <EOR> Great service noodle show but food less average  Other reviews mentioned panda express pei Wei being better    agree them  Although wasn't paying dinner should complain just let down hype prestigious renowned place is  never forget dirt scallops grinding teeth duck being dry flavorless hard chew  Maybe just bad night them? Again great waitstaff bad food high prices  <EOR> Having come years Beverly Hills location wasn't disappointed quality flavor food here  Some favorite dishes missing but some additions new favorite  just hoping Las Vegas doesn't dilute special factor Mr Chow always felt  blue light good touch lowering ceiling bit dramatic but held interest through meal  sure  but ok  back  <EOR> While walking lobby Cesars hostess approached sold restaurant   should more aware great restaurant does ropers come guests them dine establishment   service outstanding   food garbage   Chinese ribs appetizer   fair   gamblers duck shameful   am surprised class joint Cesars type restaurant property   Just embarrassment!!! <EOR> Came birthday very disappointed service food  server the captain very pushy kept trying push higher price point items  say appetizers delicious however main course only lacked flavor but also seemed lesser quality meet  Overall would recommend eating again  <EOR> Wow  disappointment  really looking forward but experience completely underwhelming   They're trying set themselves fine dining reasonable price point succeed  dishes ordered excellent  Possibly best water dumplings ever had  drunken fish lamb also very good  atmosphere pleasant although background music much talked kinetic sculpture nothing much admire   The problems primarily service side  If used high quality service higher end establishments adjust your expectations downward now  During course meal mentioned dinner partner reminded Cheesecake Factory also Chili's  exactly restaurant going I hope   first having another couple seated directly next despite abundance other available 2 tops  second being asked if everything satisfactory 5 people less minute  communal serving team which just translates into bad timing unecessary interruptions  example hot sauce first course delivered prior ordering anything sat table no purpose least 20 minutes   Other service highlights Lost reservation made wait   Simultaneous clearing serving created soy sauce spill  Luckily did but no thought ask that   Hot tea served demitasse cup wtf? Empty water glasses  Slow clearing the manager actually cleared table because waitstaff left long In short if want some excellent food fair price accustomed poor service those overpriced pretention for its own sake restaurants you'll enjoy Mr  Chow  However if you're used finer aspects enjoy attention detail generally expected fine dining skip one  <EOR> Date night show decided try something strip  Staff very friendly knowledgeable  Food prepared served quicker expected  expecting better quality tastier food hyped strip restaurant but all all good food  Prices high but expected  Used groupon wasn't bad  Glad tried but wouldn't back many other choices strip  <EOR> I recommend skip restaurant   Our experience occurred during March Madness week  Inadvertently reserved during Prix fix evening which included 3 appetizers 3 entrees rice single vegetable 3 people  mid range bottle wine additionally  Bill =$360   Appetizers were vegetarian noodles bean sauce bland pot stickers decent when eaten delicious chili sauce although single wait staff could tell if green vegetable inside seaweed kale something else    prawns walnuts  Other guests Ate said delicious  Other two appetizers disappointing   Entrees Beijing chicken dry without much flavor seasoned filet beef actually very good well prepared medium drunken fish very bland white fish some kind sauce without much taste    Garlic broccoli which actually quite good  Fried rice vegetables which recognizable fried rice   We didn't even ask see dessert cart  A champagne trolley visited before meal offerings glass starting almost $40 more $100 glass      Some foods edible but outstanding  Other items didn't even eat more bite e g  fish   left many bites all offerings plates    In opinion decor unusual disturbing  Lights kept going off large sculpture type art piece center room kept raising lowering down  Staff attentive   Bottom line food just good  ok  But nothing good  surprised chef actually eaten offerings signed off these  <EOR> The service place just horrible 30 minutes without menu bad seating average food  place way overrated would many other places before Mr Chow <EOR> Ask Charles  He best  Let order lot dissatisfied  Vegan options also  every time come Vegas  <EOR> Three stars because food good but good enough justify price  mind paying quality being said also being taken advantage of! side steamed rice isn't even organic no business costing $7 50  dessert okay but better versions $8 $9 vs Mr Chow's $14! Service inordinately slow times felt might've purpose  would only eat again if prices more reasonable which isn't going happen  If enjoy being pretentious over paying I'm talking $10 bottle water same drink home costs $2 50 store then your place  But mine  <EOR> First time Vegas thought price equated quality  Much many things city lots gimmicks illusions  wait staff front house staff general very nice but coming culinary break city Houston food worth no where near price  expecting some world meal but seems more hype place substance  some odd pre fixed meal champagne which 520 much  sure back vegas anytime soon nor any overly expensive disillusioned restaurants don't any respect employees offer food keeps them working paid keeping people place business  really glad chic experience but very lackluster  drunken fish sauce tasted cornstarch chicken broth ear mushrooms  chicken satay sad odd creamy texture   so forth  Mr  Chow please taste your food  Please see other great Chinese restaurants offer  people desire your food provide your patrons something unique bring table   not just marketing  much potential  <EOR> I absinthe show 3 8 17 son   thought going amazing according Caesar's promotes amazing views amazing food     but $310 later that's only 2 cocktails choosing prefix menu suggested absolutely disappointed   food comparable mid grade Chinese restaurant   hate say because wait staff awesome deserve work place serves better food  Until food act together don't here   many other good innovative places eat Vegas even Caesar's    Sorry guys      only Get star  being generous  <EOR> Easily becoming favorite places eat Vegas! prefix menu Beijing Duck option $78 p   price absolutely worth it!

Simply divine  decided against prix fix menu since wanted try things beyond entrees offer  appetizers chose walnut prawns squid ink noodles  walnut prawns wonderful  especially enjoyed them dipped little Mr Chow's homemade chili sauce wish bottled it!   However squid ink noodles big disappointment  looks exactly would imagine plenty well cooked squid found black goop but wasn't much flavor  entrees ordered fiery beef famous green prawns  decided shrimp rice baby bok choy sides  Again split down middle  fiery beef delicious! Don't expect much heat but flavor slight kick outstanding  Very well done  However green prawns boring  slight garlic flavor but beyond just wasn't any substance dish  found myself wishing could salt pour some soy sauce it  bok choy nothing inventive but didn't mind  perfectly seasoned prepared lovely accompaniment both dishes  fried rice don't expect soy laden variety your local Chinese restaurant  light airy delicious  Very unexpected enjoyed  Service started off outstanding but sort broke down finished meal  sat awkwardly long amount time cleared plates empty drinks  Someone finally came over asked if wanted desert but decided drink desert  Another Chow Lini please! Overall enjoyed meal Mr Chow  believe lot complaints come people can't easily afford type meal regret spending $300 or more essentially dressed Chinese food being blown away  If cannot easily afford type restaurant then likely disappointed  enjoyed it  definitely come back but time try some different things  <EOR> Well only thing impressive ambience  food NO FLAVOR portions small pathetic price pay food would think would come some flavor bigger portions  Really would never back tell anyone here  place very over rated   Also original waiter didn't present menu correctly ended having manager serve which nice take over but unfortunate even happened  Bottom line skip Mr  chow experience  <EOR> My date never any Mr Chow restaurants knew take him  food ambiance customer service top notch  Especially when Pete there  He professional accommodating feel welcomed  always patron location  Til next visit! <EOR> Ok admit when first walk into Asian restaurant no Asians worried   enters restaurant entrance where little bdsm feel hanging chains then took elevator dining area   first thing noticed restaurant pristine with  Clean lines very white    white flowers all over place made feel even more worried food might appeal Asian palate since white flowers symbolize death     The wait staff very attentive but little pushy liquor     I crab chicken corn soup    thought 14 50 pricey 1 small bowl soup but delicious   taste delicate yet delicious taste each ingredient melts your mouth   also box dumplings which pork wrapped pastry   bit doughy but reminded something would France   gamers duck crispy yet juicy succulent   lily bulb yam gentle yet again flavor bits all meld together mushrooms must have   sauce cooked delicious    blood orange lychee desert   Lychees special but blood orange soaked gran marnier sweet tasty   expensive worth it    Only complaint hostess should learn host argue guest    made reservation hostess downstairs   When upstairs second hostess told reservation she kept telling wasn't real reservation   Wtf! <EOR> Sorrrrrry say disappointed  husband stay Caesars every couple months very excited try new restaurant   comments The decor beautiful creative  waiter overly helpful when asked questions   food disappointing  #1  Noodles just warm almost cool side   #2 prawn appetizer mushy soft shells did come off easily   #3  fresh seabass just OK very flavorful   #4 don't eat meat but husband said fiery beef delicious   While ate two waiters busboys dropped things near     tray full drink while other silverware couple plates   hard relax broken glass metal tray hit cement type floor   wish could say Can't wait come back but much better restaurants Caesars spend time money  <EOR> My experience Mediocre best  ambience bit stuffy decoration blah  All white walls table chairs waiters wore all white  Typically $$$$ experience should somewhat sexy stylish good food  would disagree Mr Chow offers any these  Also food bland considered Chinese all  <EOR> It's very over priced average quality food  spent $150for two baby meal sizes  really toddler portion   Probably think small portion presentation food quality higher?

Cons Food really nothing special  Honestly pretty standard Chinese food perhaps without tons MSG    The food drinks well desert does NO WAY justify astronomical prices  Also fried rice nothing more sticky white rice  food being pretty standard but cares no really comes food  Its all show     Pros felt though waiters staff more actors performing play rather actual restaurant employees  Everything way spoke way dressed carried themselves contributed aura feeling you're play  LOVED artwork thingy kept coming down morphing  LOVED fact need take elevator restaurant! cool! Some guy also came did some weird show dough? don't know hell he doing but entertaining!   You come SHOW!  Honestly if want good food lots buffet 20 feet away Mr  Chow  FANTASTIC buffet!  So summarize OK food sort total rip off but AWESOME dining experience!   It type place come once never back food simply doesn't justify price  However fun! <EOR> Highend Chinese The massive kinetic art feature dropping down ceiling mood lighting transforms space everly 30 minutes views all contribute chic environment restaurant    Peking Duck carved table side served thin pancakes hosin sauce thinly sliced green onions cucumbers must try  <EOR> Good service classy  Portions moderate  Decent flavor but nothing great  Deserts good but Chinese choc cake cheese cake creme brûlée    crispy beef good  Pricing medium   few days ago  shrimp fried rice super bland  did offer any chops sticks   Would again unless venue chosen others  <EOR> I sent following GM Mr  Rozat speaking per request  sent via email March 1 2017   heard back otherwise would given 2 stars   Per conversation February 20th am sending complaint   We 8pm dinner reservations 5 February 18th    We arrived early approximately 730pm shown bar   joined friend sitting couch   She drink already   waiting 10 minutes cocktail waitress bar inquire if should order wait   bar patron end 3 others other end   bartender talking 3 then took picture group   wasn't acknowledged until picture taken   simple nod kind gesture would appreciated   He told wasn't cocktail waitress he would take order   He walked over table ordered 4 cocktails   shown table assured would deliver drinks table   As waiter explained menu asked water still didn't drinks   Another waiter came asked if would drinks   informed ordered them bar still waiting   approximately 25 minutes receive drinks time arrival bar delivery     When waiter explained menu family style asked if could order la carte  told no main waiter   Looking menu found difficult decipher list items prices prix fixe menu   entire table didn't understand why couldn't order la carte    I then spoke he main waiter again asking why couldn't order la carte   He reiterated couldn't if necessary he could ask special permission   traveled around world monthly past 12 years never difficulty ordering off menu    point being am well travelled experienced many different dining experiences   felt mislead thus reducing experience less then pleasant evening   Your bar staff needs instructed being attentive even just quick acknowledgement   No should walk bar look service especially when bar area busy   Your waitstaff needs clearer without appearing patronizing   When inquired menu second time he should immediately gone your maitre d' hotel requested help   maitre d' hotel responsible dining experience waitstaff he assist your waitstaff patrons   The design menu problematic    If family style then eliminate prices individual items if need charge more specific item then charge item   If difficulty understanding your menu then people saved months your restaurant too    Your reviews quite low food good but phenomenal customer service needs improvement    When dine establishment your level expect amazing service good customer service fabulous food   Mr  Chow's Las Vegas didn't meet any criteria  <EOR> I work dinner party  let waiter choose entire menu which refreshing  service outstanding  food could described very good  duck bunch other stuff  Everyone appeared enjoy it    It expensive everything Vegas  However since let waiter pick entire dinner without even looking menu afraid I'd crushed worse did  multiple drinks

experience should receive when dining such high end establishment thank memorable experience! <EOR> Reservations party 8 past weekend family me  honestly don't know why place considered fine dining but  Vegas ya  decor bit cheesy side think tacky wedding venue flying saucer descends every often center room  luxurious Beijing cuisine wasn't really anything luxurious Beijing it   As sat down given menu 8 us  server said would help cut down amount time takes decide dishes if person charge  made ordering very difficult other servers tell getting frustrated finally gave more menus  server then tried explain menu works except he wasn't very clear ask thousand questions before made any sense us   We came because Beijing duck highly recommend  sure if mandatory since large party but everyone forced order prefix option where  only narrowed down 3 appetizers 3 4 main entrees duck final course  pretty annoying can't just order several dishes menu  Each dish mediocre best  None dishes worth mentioning everything coated heavily sauces  Also Chinese restaurant   please offer chopsticks  totally awkward eating Chinese food fork silver plates    Finally duck  If you've ever real Beijing duck you'd know nothing it  skin duck really fatty thin crispy  skin usually comes first Chinese buns wrap but did serve way  duck came skin instead buns tortilla wraps tasted very powdery? for lack better description    Oh lamian chinese hand pulled noodles demonstration laughable   If really want authentic Chinese food Chinatown something  Definitely don't splurge your Vegas winnings here! <EOR>

We end getting pre fixed which includes two appetizers two entrees two sides  price pre fixed depending entree u choose which bull   Finally food comes but doesn't table till 15 mins later  see servers struggling organize accomplish tasks front me  grabs appetizer other takes sets down other attempts come table then drops spoon    He sets dish down disappears 5 mins  Finally someone else delivers it   Wow    cold very fast   The servers seem facade properness high class but fail simply provide decent service   I'm guessing everyone new jobs here   The food just okay  always enjoy mr chow noodles dumplings    Everything else just okay  black cod buttery prawns overly sauced fried rice kind mushy   baby bok choy good but hard mess up   We finished asked take boxes all food leftover left    Prob won't back location  Beverly hills location better service ambience    Maybe even better food  <EOR> I'm big fan Mr Chow loyal customer since early 2000's  However 2nd time new location Caesars Palace worst experience then 1st time  expectations $$$$ restaurant wasn't even close being met  Took 20 minutes glass water main course didn't come til 50 minutes ordered  Needless say service beyond terrible  ahead give location more try if let down again no choice but visit favorite location Beverly Hills    This all happened Valentine's Night  leave girlfriend brother wife because work  gave them 90 mins couldn't even deliver  SMH  Being Vegas local 15 years dining some finest spots 2nd guessing location  whole staff needs change attitude way serve customers location  mention appetizers cold when brought out  STEP YOUR GAME MR CHOW!

loved flavours seasonings  ginger sea bass good but over cooked  mixed veggies basic  While mushroom rice tasty  Sadly crème brûlée underwhelming sugar top wasn't flambéed enough     The space all white liked ceiling art but music bit loud date conversation  also found very overwhelming hard relax having prep stations focal point room  did understand noodle pulling demo seemed bit conceited interrupting  chairs uncomfortable no leg space under table made hard date    Not expecting price hype  suppose might good place someone unfamiliar Asian cuisine wanting intro western friendly artistic Beijing food but premium  <EOR> Beautiful decor beautiful food great service  Let's honest your only coming say you've Mr Chow  food mediocre Chinese food could probably better Chinese food your local china town  great experience but no need return head local Chinese restaurant  Chinese food save $100  <EOR> From moment entered small bright white room felt celebrity  welcomed sparkling champagne greeted two elegant yet friendly hosts entered mysterious elevator brought boyfriend dining room  enter another spotless white room woman takes coats offers spot lounge bar while reserved table prepared  gazing some most expensive champagne bottles world crystal clear restaurant caters rich famous   The outstanding service memorable far best ever experienced  manager waiter constantly checked table going above beyond sure all expectations met  Every time someone restaurant stood someone would simultaneously come around fold napkin carefully chair  Clearly service impressive but restaurant lacked warmth seemed missing something   Now let's fast forward shows if even call them that  first show involved blue light transforming restaurants color kinetic sculpture ceiling slowly shifted positions  maybe five minutes but really nothing interesting it  Another show involved chef coming ringing very loud bell grab attention all customers  noodle show watch chef create popular noodle dish scratch while you're your table  happened order noodle dish let's just say disappointing  noodles lacked flavor such tasteless bore! I'd rather skip show order chow mein but no there's no chow mein menu   Other shows include champagne trolley dessert trolley  sure why call show just cart comes around trying empty your wallet more overpriced items   Now understand people paying superior experience therefore really can't base rating off prices  If can't afford then shouldn't first place  Just warned portions small food bland  many fantastic restaurants choose Vegas I'd recommend looking elsewhere  <EOR> Back today celebrating anniversary weekend  place fabulous    David Charles outstanding  Ceasars Palace Mr Chow very fortunate such outstanding employees    We again pre fix menu  choices tremendous whatever choose disappointed    Mr Chow gave delicious coconut cake anniversary  nice way finish delicious meal    The food service impeccable   Highly recommend <EOR> Firstly service first rate  front house staff really should commended work but mind food restaurant serves establishes being worth cost admission  party 8 people ordered 3 course duck meal  None dishes served exception duck any higher quality available panda express  ribs dry filet overcooked noodles mushy flavorless  price charging expected blown away but instead left feeling thoroughly unimpressed  would recommend eatery anyone  <EOR> I am dedicated fan Mr Chow brand     restaurant does disappoint!  service spot on food absolutely amazing ambiance found anywhere else   recommend Chicken Satay Turnip Puffs Mr Chow Noodles Beijing Chicken vegetables   wait return! <EOR> Had excellent meal always!

Chow some mad skills kitchen   Let server select your courses based your likes don't anyone dietary restrictions  did once never again! But if let them order restricted meal yours  <EOR> Coming $$$$ Chinese restaurant Strip definitely interested checking taste food here  entry way high end inviting but restaurant more jewelry store  bit difficult find restaurant start because only see its entrance once enter take elevator restaurant  interior restaurant mostly white all around inside under dome which hangs installation wow factor  waitress provided menus but also extremely eager let them pick and choose chef recommended dishes instead did that    Lobster shumai great  much better shumai dim sum  Pork chops pretty good  Very tender good flavor  Peking duck served traditional way  chef comes slices pieces duck table but provide tortillas place folded buns would've traditionally  Lychee martini sounded good tasted ordinary  Inception better lychee martini  couple small dishes weren't great remember quality experience ordered few plates desserts end meal best them coconut cake    My favorite thing place perhaps clean simple interior but opinion suitable Chinese restaurant  food far authentic but didn't quite expect its high price restaurant location  interesting experience overall but would recommend come back  <EOR> This probably worst customer service dining experiences ever had   server very pushy manipulative coercing order $66 per person menu appetizers would come entree choices food would more timely   explained pescatarian  some dishes may conducive eating restrictions   He course guaranteed would  trade meat poultry allocation additional vegetarian fish   First courses dropped off no explanation first 2 were meat!  Basically waited another 15 min before brought something could eat? Check comes appetizers he said came chef set price which turned $76 per person charged first courses vegetable dishes included?? Definitely would recommend even though food actually very good! <EOR> Other being somewhat over priced plan $125 per person oriental food but Vegas restaurant isn't place really really good fun experience try 8 00 little show   very noisy if want romantic place here  No menu Captain just starts bring food some basic questions allergies  Food spectacular more enough satisfy everyone  Don't fret if don't dish more appear soon  filet minion which isn't normally favorite cut beef but wow  Nice garlicky melted your mouth  No knife needed  crispy duck world  passed green shrimp wrong texture me  definitely back! <EOR> Have always loved food each location  But getting older more annoyed price  Chicken Joanna boneless breast no veggies $36  Crispy Beef morsels shredded beef $36  Privedge paying $15 steamed rice  All tasty well presented but        <EOR> I coming regular basis since opened   honest rough start   food always excellent but service unbearable stuffy confusing given many people interrupting your dining experience      Over past year nailed it   food continues incredible glazed prawns Mr  Chows hot sauce tops awesome menu but now service match it   bartenders wait staff general managers friendly atmosphere attentive without being overbearing     A great time once again!!! <EOR> I little let down Mr Chow's   The restaurant stunning but felt food overpriced didn't blow away   food wasn't very hot  Actually think Hakkasan's food superior   loved Champagne Chart   Great selection glass  Also Chow lini Moet topped peach foam amazing!!!  Service mediocre although Champagne server great   expected restaurant cool sexy sound but music horrendous   would return Chow lini bar  <EOR> Love social hour here   must anyone visiting Caesars favorite trip   All apps fantastic drinks 7 10 range   Wish everyone Vegas offered affordable cocktail option  <EOR> The food hand made noodles great service atmosphere second none! come back sure            Second visit Last review gave them 5 stars  Loved it!!!  About month later last Saturday took another couple 9 30 PM  no reservations but seated promptly staff  server came over gave grand welcome explained menu which driven set three core courses  asked order food ala Carter since all individual appetizer food items separate pricing them  server politely told order three core menu items which included several main courses several side items  picked all but two more side dishes when server told order more per policy otherwise leave approval manager  when met Patrice French manager  When told month ago ordered ala Carter menu he told very sarcastically already use favor!!! thought he joking but nothing could further when he asked bar lounge chairs eat there  Yes he moved 4 great drinks into bar where table knee level  Food arrived cold late then he showed serve fish since no longer server  bar staff tried best plates silverware more drinks   We understand policy but hope Mr Chow would give managers enough common sense city FULL wonderful restaurants move party 4 10 PM into bar eat dinner when two silly sides trifecta!! Now hate say every unhappy Yelp reviewer says won't see again Patrice if Yelp allows post your picture everyone would know you!

Don't here  Service awful! should listened all other reviews  <EOR> oh boy where begin?   This most ridiculous experiences ever had  people work sweet attentive service provided but rather show they're paid deliver    Here whole story  Bear pass front restaurant because looked jewelry store  But caught name while figuring if Mr  Chows also sells diamonds it  hostess number ask many last name then points elevator restaurant  She also tells tell them Chapman's when we're upstairs hand gesture she giving little mini lesson act according fanciness place    Upstairs hostess number two takes name someone walk seats  2 3 other people waiting table  them pulls table walk into booth  next person places napkins laps third person leaves menus    Then other person approaches large ice bowl cart various champagnes which awkwardly turned down cocktail menu   Then ceiling lights changed colors something moved down just silly     Then server comes recommended couple dishes took orders    So food underwhelming can't even find words it  good  But exact flavor texture everything Panda Express  actually joking table perhaps emergency kitchen forced run over Panda Express fetch some takeout us      Then ceiling thing happened again      In middle dinner someone came noodle dough started slamming table he made noodles front us  slamming very loud  everytime he slammed he yelled some karate thing waiters made some weird howlbark sounds silly    We ate food ordered dessert left overs boxed ready check tickets brought table together $250 bill  picked stuff said adieu    Again isn't high class restaurant but rather high class theater act  food average ambiance cold minimalistic spaceshippy    price extremely ridiculous! <EOR> I loved food much decided come back twice week! local luxury doing slow day picked Tuesday  Came seated right away thought would excellent service meh experience last time however worse   Truthfully food phenomenal! Truly  some best fine dining Western Chinese food had  Even left overs good  No dessert should left untried  low scoring review strictly front house    I'm over paying $500+ tipping $100+ meal town very blah service  same uncouth waiter last week the suggested tip he acted first time life he's ever seen us  used server Vegas but should LEAST always remember your seven stars especially ones earlier week   part casino player experience  cares though? don't mind he didn't remember but am questioning ring things restaurant  When order fried rice charge two portions even though only want one  Just starting price two portions then? Stupid but over too  Ordered two baileys decaf $40 tax included   Yes read right  Apparently charged $12 each baileys then charge coffee well which came small mug mostly baileys  wonder if order captain coke if pay captain then also coke? used players comp pay meal but could considerate if would least inform if over   common sense even though don't mind paying difference  little things your consumer feel if you're getting robbed  wrap several complaints going busy night manager couldn't bothered come over address table himself  Just playing telephone wait staff  Your front house needs help say all trickles top  shows! <EOR> Huge disappointment!!! Way over hyped over expensive  Food very average service odd  order appy main dessert all same time <EOR> We party five head waiter told order minimum 40'dollars per person including drinks ordering appetizer option all order combo 70 dollars per person appetizer main course  food terrible very bland would never back <EOR>
