The asparagus presented two types traditional green also white  Sauteed asparagus seems hard master though dish better average I'd suggest cooking longer outside bit chewier liked    After polishing off meal which would filling enough just ravioli bite friend's Spaghettini Pasta   it phenomenal just noodles marinara! literally bite very full already but spaghetti likely best spaghetti ever had   The prices steep but special occasions moments 'I just feel eating somewhere nice' place go  <EOR> On last day MDW Vegas trip group wanted grab brunch together before all left  lazy leave Venetian staying decided walk around shops find something liking    Obviously chose Postrio!

It's really much price feel particularly more expensive most other Vegas equivalents   certainly more expensive other Wolfgang Puck establishments Vegas until Cut came Palazzo but used well worth money   Slowly but surely menu deteriorated time on   first few times where eagerly tried many different house recommendations most recent visit last month numerous favorites gone ways Houdini its quality drastically cut   I'll start seared John Dory   John Dory isn't often served restaurants but place seared perfection   still remains memory most tender white flaky fish ever had   wish would ordered more first few years but did regret it   Then Peking Duck great dish well   Low terms quantity but superb quality   Besides just saves room more appetizer desert   almost always sold early into night   Now think replaced Duck Breast entree just isn't nearly tasty   Sniff   They used serve domestic Kobe Beef ya know?  Kobe Beef cup tea but everyone else loved it    anymore tis shame   But no worries because without Kobe Beef still house special ribeye very delicious   Actually  gone too   So *is* left  still pretty good?  Scallops   can't remember if appetizer entree but per usual ways order appetizer   remember time crazy scallops came ordered 6 orders   think scallop overdosed but very memorable experience regret doing again   *Edit*  I forgot chilled seafood platter serve   excellent yeah  reason I'd back   Phew almost forgot that!  I don't think pasta bad but there's plenty better Pasta places Vegas   better mean even comparable better   You know based most recent experience I'd given place two stars based stacks versus all other possible places eat Las Vegas   But sake used possibility become again day future let's leave 3 stars  <EOR> Being heart Venetian sure place would incredibly expensive  However dishes came 20 dollars plate affordable place ambiance place offered    I ordered bolognese here  Delicious! pasta's texture just perfect  felt substance  spices sauce subtle but tasty   The best part meal chocolate beignets  They're traditional beignets  shape reminds doughnut hole but texture taste reminds molten lava cake  Creamy hot chocolate oozing inside covered crispy chocolate cake outside  two orders that   Service point constantly came check us  friend didn't dish some spaghetti dish gladly took back gave new dish   service! <EOR> Very good food service pleasant ambience sitting under air conditioned sky Venice simulated sidewalk cafe   Server really knew wines  <EOR> THE BEST BURGER EVER!!!! someone never craves burgers way vegas all think burger here  onion marmalade sharp vermont cheddar juicy prime beef burger  AMAZINGNESS! <EOR> The food amazing! service impeccable!

Everything had   Most notable Lobster Club Sandwich   know you're thinking   a sandwich    how good sandwich be?  Well let tell you   my husband lobster club 6 years ago day still dream it   good     I long sink teeth into another lobster club but don't think opportunity again until kids older   time teeth would fallen off would liquidated sip through straw  <EOR> I'm reviewing Postrio eating two separate times   If staying Venetian Palazzo excellent option fine dining   husband grew Germany he shares Wolfgang Puck's love admiration all things schnitzel hence return visit     Most people eating outside patio where enjoy beautiful faux Venice ambiance   lighting courtyard area truly spectacular   But really loud usually subject some entertainment nearby stage which terrible sound   opted eat inside restaurant which sleek modern quiet   much preferred patio option personally   Our server prompt knowledgeable accomodating without condescention   served several kinds bread including remarkably light flavorful foccacia  started meal sharing apple salad which quite possibly best salad ever eaten   ingredients salad all top quality salad perfect balance textures flavors featuring morsels aged blue cheese spiced marcona almonds   fennel shaved thin apples mandolined both kept crisp ice water until immediately before plating   highly recommend salad never anything quite anywhere else   My husband schnitzel served warm mustard sauce   pork pounded flat breading uniformly crisp overly heavy   came very small amount potatoes roasted tomatoes appeared almost thought huge pork cutlet dominating plate   waiter told always menu reminds Wolfgang Puck Austrian upbringing he does dish proud   ordered Cioppino featuring shrimp clams fish   good great   seafood fresh flavor firm texture overcooked   broth heavily scented fennel tomatoes   don't know Cioppino dish very well but would surprised if good gets     All all good option those visiting Las Vegas strip   pricey but certainly most expensive option very high dollar area   menu offers variety those looking break Italian steakhouse options available elsewhere  <EOR> Good location service underwhelming food    For brunch split spaghetti meatballs wild mushroom pizza  Both fine but especially memorable  spaghetti huge came 6 enormous meatballs  While pasta good sauce meatballs little bland  pizza bit one note again just ok  would pass better brunch Italian restaurants Vegas  <EOR> Location nice outside seatings enjoy venetian show Price decent  Food just ok nothing special write about   ordered chicken soup celery   little bit salty taste did expect something better world class chef's restaurant   All other dishes ordered friends just average well   better restaurants try Vegas Postrio  <EOR> The entire decor menu Postrio both recently remodeled changing vibe upscale bar sophisticated grill  made world difference I never impressed restaurant prior change   second time coming back since re done while everything very good few items particularly stood out   The Korobuta pork schnitzel Austrian potatoes whole grain mustard sauce dad ordered fantastic my husband last time Puck's personal comfort foods worth trying  pork pounded thinly lightly pan fried rests bed lemon herb dressed fingerling potatoes  also served cooling cucumber yogurt sauce mini sald teardrop tomatoes  nothing wrong dish all can't imagine being any better Puck's home country  nothing wrong husband's dish which unfortunately only special evening  large portion two perfectly roasted quail served bed fluffy gnocchi freshly shucked spring peas bathed rich intensely flavored reduction  should become permanet fixture menu because really amazing  entree steamed black mussels white wine garlic grilled sourdough lavishly spread bernaise very good but somewhat disappointing comparison version restaurant Spago Beverly Hills  Spago mussels petite sweet making unique other versions steamed mussels bernaise prepared bit more skill  hard evaluate mussels without thinking mussels while comparison fun I'd order something else next time   The appetizers good but wasn't nearly impressed those entrees  mesquite grilled steak skewers creamy celery salad house made steak sauce charcuterie plate grilled bread artisan cheese marinated olives  former good but didn't taste terribly original the little salad best part latter missing sweet element could used some work presentation  understood business perspective trying look huge portion but prefer something looks little less deli tray when order charcuterie    I forgot write down prices aren't showing online I hate when restaurants hide but assure Postrio pricey  advice would skip apps or least those entree limit your drinks if want experience restaurant without breaking bank  Oh eat lots bread fantastic  <EOR> We sat bar drinks food   bartender sorta shmoozy but also mildly condescending but he made drinks wasn't expecting new best friend   had Calamari bland Cauliflower beautiful multicolored roasted cauliflower gorgeous tasty well prepared Apple salad very good great dressing good portions split without asking when said would sharing appetizers Martinis dirty martinis blue cheese stuffed olives  The bathroom dark need flashlight your phone light if going try redo your makeup lipstick   Overall ok but certainly great experience feels weird eating essentially roped off area main lobby   Eh wouldn't way back  <EOR> Three stars does befit felt food rather service   eaten twice both times service sketchy   must clarify however both times ate cafe area which outside inside which where fine dining housed     To important stuff first food two separate parties all really enjoyed new american mediterranean style food   always judge restaurant french fries course started off pommes frites   Perfectly seasoned hot crispy   aioli good accompaniment but tad rich side   Besides still loads full starches come   Next tried some flat bread pizzas   Wolfgang Puck famous can't places without trying these   love prosciutto prosciutto mission figs blue cheese touch taste buds   pleasantly surprised crispiness crust despite amount toppings offered   Also pleasantly surprising blue cheese did completely overwhelm whole pizza   bf tried spicy chorizo pizza he being super carnivore very pleased     When mother split fettuccine english peas arugula linguine clams    Both pastas divine   Although love classic Italian pastas al dente if strict then please aware pastas Postrio freshly made dry     Portions very generous   welcome treat seeing every meal Vegas seem way expensive yet small   Hear Batali?  Now bummerific The service terrrible   blanket statement despite fact food runners bussers very sweet   Why ask?  hostesses perpetual model scowl faces never tell if waiters being sarcastic if really just need somewhere else food takes foreeeeeever come out   deal surly waiters even if still tip 20% deal grumpy hostess but cannot starve while waiting food when only two other tables restaurant     So if want eat well overlook negatives suggest Postrio   But if you're looking atmosphere look elsewhere  <EOR> If you're looking quiet place dinner hold conversation your dinner partner here   Like any restaurant Vegas probably best reservations avoid wait  However first come first serve seating bar full menu those eat run   Ordered chilled shrimp cocktail start  shrimp still its shell won't served glass  shrimp actually quite delicious very meaty  cocktail sauce decent  best shrimp cocktail ever had? No  better average shrimp cocktail  Yes  If decide Postrio despite review assured shrimp cocktail reason why gave Postrio two stars   My main entree capellini pasta grilled shrimp calamari spicy tomato sauce  may notice menu actually includes mussels well but no mussels present serving  Also capellini seemed overcooked mushy  huge disappointment  expect sub par pasta restaurant doesn't specialize Italian cuisine but considering Italian restaurant Wolfgang Puck restaurant no less extremely disappointed   Undoubtedly find better Italian restaurant strip otherwise you're huge disappointment Postrio  <EOR> We late lunch here   Food good pretty typical Wolfgang Puck fare   split salad pizza   Service painfully slow took forever food  even time when wasn't busy    ate outside enjoyed watching Venetian show ate  <EOR> Went quick lunch before leave airport just fine   atmosphere modern prices reasonable location prime   service wasn't best ask server least 5 times before he came over    twice     Food $15ish chicken salad which sounded similar Corner Bakery's chicken salad yum!    flavorful but fine because raisin bread which served yummy   I'd rather Corner Bakery's especially $6!  3 people ordered primer burger 2 ordered theirs medium 1 asked medium well   All ours came medium rare bright red bleeding middle burger    medium people dealth ate   but unacceptable person ordered med well rightfully so! took 10 min them take back then another 10 min them bring back same burger came very charred outside     Good lunch wouldn't dinner   Expect wait LONG time seated anything your table  <EOR> I just weekend   Service great waiters attentive polite   However food seems hit miss price   example salmon great but thirty something dollar flat iron okay   beef skewers also disappointing price bit dry   Skip shoot Calamari scallop shrimp appetizer  <EOR> Great drinks!  Elderflower martinis yummy!  food great too   always Vegas little pricey  <EOR> We lunch party 6 total  staying hotel didn't want venture far first meal day  waited 15 minutes table which average party size  Once seated did wait another while before having water served  seemed though short staffed just weren't prepared many people restaurant Monday 12 31 12   expected someone filling glasses before going empty but occurred  waters filled drink food orders taken then waited seemed longer while before food served  few salads soups ordered which served prior main courses  Butternut Squash soup amazing! Salads fresh anchovies also fresh  other dishes came looked appetizing  Pizza's ordered shared among table  Fennel Sausage pizza bit bland side expected far taste goes  pretty much Pepperoni Pizza fancy name  Mushroom Pizza other hand delicious  Goat cheese really added flavor complimented mushrooms  I'd give restaurant another try if hotel again  Overall great food great service restaurant category  <EOR> Amazing! Having many italian restaurants say Postrio some best pasta around  spaghettini tomato great caesar salad  spaghettini clearly fresh boxed sauce amazing  usually eats tomatoes sauce but cleaned plate tomatoes left over when all pasta done  caesar salad dressing perfect much larger anticipated  actually great deal considering location portion size food quality  Next time Vegas definitely coming back making beeline straight Fake Saint Marks square Postrio  <EOR> This probably favorite Italian place ever tried  Every time Vegas always eat here  never disappointed food tried wide variety it  pasta homemade price isn't bad especially Vegas  meat always cooked perfectly sauces die for  Overall would suggest going whenever chance  <EOR> Service = 2 stars  Food = 2 stars  Atmosphere = 2 stars   Visited Postrio bachelorette party dinner  best thing say meal seated promptly  everything downhill  some reason felt party written off immediately sat down  3 servers before meal even came kitchen when food did come impossible waiter's attention    I expecting great food Wolf Gang Puck restaurant but surprised taste rather bland pasta aka Spaghettini Pasta w meatballs  tomato sauce liking no flavor meatballs red inside also no flavor  fellow diners impressed food either  best dish table seemed duck   Being foodie sad find best part meal glass wine     The restaurant situated open middle Venetian Shopping Gallery  Definitely place romantic  Would good party if service food tasted better  quite few options Las Vegas dining can't say would return lackluster experience  <EOR> Went birthday dinner Saturday night   service couldn't nicer   friend treated queen!  Oysters margherita pizza forget else started with   Five lasagna every single them cleaned plate   fact no matter anyone plate demolished   food good   Then desserts came such array   Pumpkin whoopie pies all sorts different cookes mousses ice cream creme brulee etc  etc  etc   just kept coming   Postrio delicious worth digging through horrid St  Mark's Square nonsense Venetian  <EOR> I'm going lie large group 19 people rush head over Marquee or Tao?    Between all probably ordered 4 5 pizzas only try one typical BBQ chicken   good?  Yes   Amazing Wolfgang Puck restaurant?  Maybe maybe not   didn't blow away thought would but maybe should gotten something else   Of course ambiance great Venetian   sat outside next bar pretty decent service  except friend sat corner behind pillar skipped over water couple times but forgivable   Moral story don't pizza higher end places   If seems smaller quieter seating behind glass doors  <EOR> Really solid food charming atmosphere  Between 7 9pm still felt daytime under bright blue cloudy sky   Started margarita pepperoni pizzas  margarita pizza well seasoned delicious cheese  pepperoni pizza really great well   Entree stuff quail  delicious   Overall thought everything finely executed  <EOR> Never Wolfgang Puck restaurant though used few recipes home cooking before   didn't really super high expectations definitely came bit jaded New Yorker's palate   The food good    nothing wrong any it   Service good but great forgot bring bread forgot orders water Four lunch ordered mixed greens pizza burger fish   Nothing bad everything cooked right   But seemed little sterile   food didn't jump     prices should   pizza bit underdone NY pizza style lover   fine most west coast when black means overdone but completely blonde top means underdone    Mild leopard spots bottom but no crispy ness  The fries frozen not fresh cut highly suspect dough pizza may fresh made either   Bun burger also suspect   If you're paying $19 burger fries everything better freshly made if possible   Another reviewer said best burger     unfortunately pretty far truth   meat cooked spot on    overall taste red onion marmalade cheddar nice    but well beyond Vegas tax   could similar burger Island Burger Shakes HK half price same deliciousness  Just no frozen tasting fries pay for I prepared bit Vegas tax  Puck tax but food didn't quite justify extra price burger   decent choice other fare though   Shoulda gotten earlier Bouchon   probably why bigger line Enoteca San Marco next door  <EOR> This another Wolfgang Puck restaurant disappointed by  show many restaurants rely name business instead focusing quality food experience innovation  Nothing incredibly really bad but entire experience incredibly forgettable pedestrian  Price quality ratio food just good food somehow reminded chain restaurant fare  dining experience itself also below average tables cramped way closely together felt squished corner practically sitting diners next table  I only imagine truly claustrophobic person would feel  many amazing restaurants Vegas wouldn't recommend wasting meal Postrio unless you've already eaten your way through hundreds other renowned establishments area  <EOR> Ate friend's recommendation good  Braised Oxtail some kind ricotta pasta amazing  friend Rabbit noodle dish really tasty too  server really nice  ordered Garlic Soup Lobster he kitchen split us  server forgot name didn't treat tourist once he found locals he bought dessert  plan back husband special occasion  <EOR> I ordered mushroom ravioli which undercooked sour unpleasant taste it    friend clam linguini which only 4 clams all shells barely any sauce   other friends linguini drenched sauce looked two orders clams it   star based solely food service decent  should spend less time pushing drinks concentrate more food quality  <EOR> Lovely meal very long day  Restaurant packed   reservation seated promptly  Friendly server great service throughout meal    Caesar salad perfect white anchovies  dressed crispy lettuce  Chicken Milanese best ever  Really crispy fresh arugula spectacular tomatoes  Nice wine list glass  Bread yummy too  full dessert  Next time    Small space all tables filled but didn't feel crowded  open @ Venetian quartet playing background  <EOR> Great restaurant SF Las Vegas  crab cakes sausage sampler plate begin  homemade sausages three mustards excellent  crab cake good too  then tried black angus burger lot seasoning ok  gnocchi ravioli   However pizza excellent   fourth star came because chocolate beignets caramel sauce chocolate malt ice cream  excellent  <EOR> We Postrio yesterday light lunch upon arrival Venetian   Cool setting but hostess wait staff little bit snooty side   waiter visibly annoyed when wife asked bread salad   didn't load lots wonderful different dishes nor did come dinner time  wife caesar salad chicken pizza baby squash roasted chicken smoked mozzarella   regretted getting pizza fennel sausage but pizza fine wife's salad   chicken good but really wasn't anything exceptional meal   Maybe ordered   don't know   But still fine if bit pricey got  <EOR> I'd few times   love where located Madison Square   love eating people watching   food always great service always topnotch   We Sausage Pizza homemade spaghetti  best ever had  <EOR> We fantastic meal night enjoyed some best people watching ever   started cheese plate caprese salad   Everything delicious but needed better conduit cheese more bread crackers something   waitstaff teriffic very attentive but annoying  There special richotta gnocci night chantarelle mushrooms truffles fantastic though shaved truffles ENORMOUS bit overwhelming   Dave salmon said best thing he's ever eaten   EVER  did look amazing perfectly cooked crisp outside served succulent julienned summer veggies   Yum     The only confusion came website which made seem though two restaurants cafe then more upscale restaurant totally different menu   They've now gotten rid restaurant menu just use cafe menu whether eat inside outside    highly recommend Postrio fantastic meal sit outside laugh riot people watching Las Vegas! <EOR> Don't let fact Wolfgang puck owns tempt any way  Completely unmemorable  can't say good nor bad  many other good places eat  highlight seeing Sigfried Roy next table  <EOR> This husband favorite places Vegas   came upon place few months ago loved returned every single visit Vegas since  Yes often    Our initial life changing meal consisted proscuitto wrapped cantaloupe figs meat lasagna beignets   WORLD! in fact just realized reviewed meal back June 2010   Ha ha    This Wolfgang Puck restaurant changes its menu every often haven't able recreate meal since but haven't disappointed   This visit brought brother all shared several portions lobster sandwich field greens short rib ravioli   lobster sandwich amazing   Would again   ravioli little salty but authentic homecooked get   really tastes short ribs perfectly braised separated bones stuffed into pasted right before brought out       Of course beignets   Yummy donuts filled chocolate literally explodes your mouth   Watch out   Comes coffee ice cream   love it   The restaurant located right center shopping area between Venetian ad Palazzo where intermittent shows singing   Really fun atmosphere enjoy dinner  <EOR> Vibe Open air bar  Dark claustrophobic internal dinning area  Price Moderately expensive  Service Good  Bathroom Not good  Food spaghetti meatballs $24 excellent  Homemade pasta right six small tasty meatballs  dish way overpriced  But delicious  someone else pay! pizza lamb only those enjoy very spicy food  Fettuccine mushrooms surprisingly disappointing  noodles thin served much sauce which caused noodles clump together  noodles looked muh better day  before when saw another diner eating them walked buy  Maybe noodle quality paralleled making them   Table Bread Very dry black olive bread plain Italian bread slices  Need lots butter able ingest   WIGB? Yes <EOR> For all years quite put off Wolfgang Puck's places airports others still learning name more unique menu dining experience  food simply any better pub foods frozen meal  Nothing he should proud of   However ran into place purely accident walking into Venetian hotel  Dining experience Postrio definitely made change harsh perception neutral   Hearty portion meals served good reasonably priced wine beer selections  food tastes finally better experienced other places lame banal fresh pretentious kind     At Postrio plates ordered fresh very simple inexpensive ingredients intepreted something better mouth  still would call Postrio gourmet restaurant yet  But its simple but very enjoyable dinner experience definitely deserve 4 5 stars  still give harsh 4  blaming food menu Bistro kind still room improve menu board   The friendly very professional waiters definitely team workers  adds extra star  <EOR> My bf came sat  night when walking down  strip lil hungry but didnt want eat full meal b c  planning walking lot more having some drinks there  decided place b c any further Male Shut down would commenced  ladies know man gets when he doenst eat?

Very tasty fresh!    The big draw restaurant though eating outside Ventatian's replica St  Mark's Square   itself probably best part experience   Since you're outside people watch take fun shows going there   fun all ages!  service absolutely lovely friendly too   waiter didn't smirk when dad ordered Reuben without sauerkraut rye bread thousand island dressing   takes alot skill right there  <EOR> i've salmon entree few occasions never disappoints  enjoy glass wine sitting outside shops     beyond humorous people watching  <EOR> You must absolutely Truffled Potato Chips Bleu Cheese   Everything else ordered pretty good but initial appetizer blew minds  couple pizzas burger menu  Again anything everything good terms quality presentation   I'm taking off 1 star place because service extremely slow  might well wear pajamas take nap because takes 7 hours your meal  wasn't even busy restaurant when there  <EOR> Very casual restaurant  scallops okay  best but worst  Service decent everything ordered decent  Being restaurant Las Vegas though think needs more then decent returning customers IMO    On next restaurant  <EOR> Overall great time Postrio   Atmosphere nice drinks great   However service tended slow food price wasn't fantastic   prosutto pizza salty non adventurous  noted pesto goat cheese but where it? Also requested mushrooms added forgotten  Nearly $20 personal pizza   The Aviation drink simply delicious  Crisp refreshing   We large group accomodating group  Drinks came incredibly slow did food  No huge deal weren't rush but frustrating when hungry! I would recommend Postrio nice evening Vegas! <EOR> Barely seems worth writing review since quick lunch   being said food quite good   ordered pizza fennel sausage cippolini onions wild mushrooms goat cheese side fries   pizza good but nothing worth writing home over especially since crust bit soggy sauce wasn't flavorful hoped   fries other hand exceptional   crispy salty hot it also didn't hurt served garlic herb aioli would dip just anything in!    drink ordered hey don't judge just because lunch doesn't mean can't drink! plus Vegas! average could likely better 5 bucks bar down street New Orleans   Good food great but won't judge chef Puck effort  <EOR> I Fettuccini Alfredo disappointed    wast money    thought  Wolfgang Puck famous chef would better tasting dishes     <EOR> We did reservations busy Friday night but accommodated seated within five minutes   We steak dish which included succulent potatoes     Their calamari possibly best ever well accompanied some aejo Don Julio   I definitely back place  <EOR> The staff worked friends money returned them told thief waiter terminated   I would possibly come back when Vegas again but otherwise think find similar dishes Wolfgang's other restaurants LA  <EOR> Yes   I'm Wolfgang fan! some AWESOME meals Postrio  <EOR> Excellent dining spot St Marks Sq Venetian    I started delicious Ceasar salad wonderfully tangy white anchovies  Followed pizza homemade pepperoni     when Wolfgang Puck restaurant quality pizza know good     was!

We didn't regret decision entire experience both relaxing pleasant  Instead sitting weird outside vibes area dined inside where dark but quiet  even little fireplace eerie see glow fake outside world through doors   Despite service being bit confusing times main waiter slow two other people asking orders different periods things came timely well cooked  boyfriend shared creamy potato leek soup which definitely creamy potato like but still good when served crunchy bread    Vegetarian fare plain simple homemade pasta mushroom cream sauce  used this  Still classic dish done great some mini onions myriad different mushrooms  definitely salted enough asked server bit taken aback bit salt  boyfriend nuts over meatloaf onion rings dish! happy excitement! The dessert menu rocked!! don't even know where begin  confused definitely huge hardship night  chose lemon pudding cake blueberry compote blueberry gelato which maybe only mistake little lemony sweet overpowering  wish gotten sweet potato pie!
