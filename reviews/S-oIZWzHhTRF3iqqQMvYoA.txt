Good fast Mexi American food reasonable price   As other reviewers pointed Zabas similar menu Chipotle but more protein options  pick meal burrito quesadillas salads    your protein your preferred salsa your add ons  pulled steak quesadilla  basic bit greasy tastes but meat both good plentiful    Located Kohl's Petsmart NW corner city place would specifically but best food options area  <EOR> If eat bring cash! account double charged three times day  told bank glitch however people talked today  said happening people since November!  Initially spoke Zabas last week still waiting resolution   even offered accept store credit but refused bank issue  <EOR> I really fish tacos  always order fish tacos but past week ordered burrito OMGosh huge!! son always gets burrito try it! big enough two people! really loved prices affordable   3 cost $24   Two big huge burrito's fish taco 2 bags chips! <EOR> Love fish tacos! boyfriend won't eat any fish but they're good  steak tacos also good burritos huge  find way more relaxed cafe rio chipotle ingredients really fresh  <EOR> Love restaurant great food prices reasonable great service  Everyone family something good eat loves to  love able see them food front see everything add way it  <EOR> The food ordered fresh tasty  return but hopefully cleaned dusted rafters ceiling  When door opens windy day   you see dust bunnies floating around down your table plate   Just look when sitting seating area! <EOR> Absolutely excellent  Anyone likes Chipotle must try place   it's local chain puts them shame  How?   1 sweet potatoes! offer sweet potato pieces options any entrees burrito tacos bowl etc   Whoever thought putting Mexican food genius!  2 option wheat tortilla! Tastier healthier option every build your own Mexican place should have    3 more generous portions  Chipotle half dozen times   the burrito end weighs maybe 1 2 2 3rd Zabas   it's amazing much fresh ingredients fit those Zabas burritos!  Over past year half over 50 times always great experience  <EOR> If Chipotle type Mexican food want just little bit healthier then Zaba's place!  Besides normal Chipotle flare add shrimp whole wheat tortilla's brown rice into mix  Making much easier your food much better you   say those choices alone healthy but gives more options so   Overall great place when your craving big burrito! <EOR> 7 30pm thursday noone dining inside but line ppl waiting order assume its worth wait  My 1st time The employees seemed nice laid back group ladies  some reason husband pushed through along 2 other ppl ordering behind lady end line register put order 2 different bags mixing mine other 2 orders  instead listening co worker trying help cashier gives free food away but charges extra sides chips guac salsa sour cream $4 guac must equivilant chicken burrito    Anyway food decent  Nothing spectacular nothing stood me  fish tacos similar Rubio's fish tacos except Zabas dry  If want BOMB fish taco Rubios  <EOR> The ladies thay work act commision much domt give you  orderd bowl no rice beans plenty room yet she gives little scoop lettuce I asked more she attitude  WOW its LETTUCE! asked green salsa side she gave 1 2 bowls lol   real bitch! <EOR> I swear potatoes magical   Imagine Chipotle setup but slew healthier options   don't ever order healthy options   but if some reason want feel better your enormous burrito   You fill your whole wheat tortilla brown rice sweet potatoes   Might recommend regular potatoes however?  just yum tastic   Not greatest meal you'll ever but good cheap huge burrito fill up   better Chipotle   local business which always good thing support  <EOR> I start off saying food good Zabas but equally important thing wide variety choices   If allergies dieting concerns still put together good meal without cheating  The concept looks based Chipotle but taken couple steps further   Quite frankly think blows away Chipotle  <EOR> They great Mother's Day Free Entree Offer purchase drink  never heard that   think wonderful idea   3 total workers pretty busy  enjoyed Chicken Nachos ordered plenty only thing didn't know charged guacamole   server should mentioned it  Otherwise great little place deal! <EOR> I love place  brother last weekend some fish tacos burrito bowl  guess fish he shredded beef burrito instead  comped queso drinks since weren't able fish tacos  Totally unexpected! Seriously nicest staff ever! food always fresh!

 then extremely rude when questioned lady literally told anything comes salsa states menu    proceeded point handful menu items confirmed came salsa but noted menu   am fine places charging extra sauces etc but quesadilla beans rice should given 1 salsa none other employees stepped in  <EOR> Best fast food style Mexican area doesn't give diarrhea  Yes talking chipotle  Lots different things order know exactly what's going into your food give LOT it  They're generally pretty quick packed most time ideal if your just picking food want dine in  <EOR> Excellent food  Steak tacos amazing  Breakfast quesadilla very good healthy  suggest Wheat tortilla egg whites turkey sausage pico de gallo  <EOR> Honsetly  location  lot times never treated ever  When came tuesday 14th 8 night ceclie think thats u spell name very rude being nice then ask  guacamole sauce she gave pinch  said never just lil everytime came everyone esle would five spoon full she said well charge u double if give u more then pinch upset because never treated ever im give bad reveiws unless person really dersevre just wrose she treated night  really love zabas but im upset wont come again!

<EOR> This restaurant place hungry went  put bluntly food service   service number thing look restaurant  I liked food   nachos excellent   just did care service   Very rude service   extra star because nachos slightly above par  <EOR> Had ask lady mending register wash hands since she just finished counting change decided she would just put some gloves without washing first   The owner manager need teach employees proper hand washing techniques   This why people sick food poisoning   After asked politely hands another employee came started talking bad Spanish speak Spanish people need learn assumptions since most think Hispanic   Very disappointed quality customer service love food came location since visiting friend but live very far only location Henderson   I work public daily bases sure hand washing done prior wearing gloves before working someone but seems food place being followed should   This place needs health department come show them proper way  <EOR> Before heading road trip AZ Sunday topic where eat before headed came up   finally decided grudged ZMG long enough recommended GF BOY happy choice   It seems things changed since last here   Rather having pick your burrito Zaba Bowel choices menu which include combination ingredients thus eliminating any indecision   I surf turf steak shrimp burrito   found ingredients fresh compliment each other   cheese guacamole hot sauce pico potatoes   When all sat down enjoyed watching everyone enjoy meal   must say truly enjoyed mine   service quick efficient mention based previous review no DB's within eyeshot  <EOR> they charged debit card 22 times same day over $600 00 when called payment system CLEARENT  blew off! next step filing bank fraud  claim  bank WELLS FARGO!  game ! bring cash if EAT HERE! WHEN CALL RESTAURANT SAY IM SORRY!   WTF!  UPDATE bank reimbursed account Wells Fargo  Clearent gave gift card but when attempted use Zabas Wed  Jan 10th  said can't use gift cards  LOL <EOR> Food  Yum  Belly  Full   Those key takeaways gobbled down delicious burrito lunch  choices included whole wheat tortilla black beans brown rice spicy salsa fish  Normally when alternative tastes never come way hoped but came top combo   The food prepared quickly  Think Chipotle more diverse menu  Shrimp Fish options  Quesadillas nachos salads menu well   The restaurant clean food tasty    I should also mention Coke Zero available fountain  Another big plus   I prefer place over similar competitor Chipotle  Just because menu variety    I'm done  <EOR> Good food friendly service  fact BOTH wheat tortillas brown rice options  Haven't bad experience yet  <EOR> I stopped restaurant work quick dinner pick up  initially called place phone order but wS rudely notified take orders over phone  Where start   chipotle style set regards ordering  struggle came when none people preparing food understood asked them for  hard time understanding why when they're literally putting toppings move along service counter  shrimp decent but beef good   at all  ordered shrimp bowl which enough two meals steak tacos  asked salsa side since order but sad see never received it  Because food mediocre employees quite rude likely won't come back  <EOR> So into Zaba's first time long time  bought some food friend I  food bought some sour cream barely any sour cream bowl  top rung guacamole which cost more then 99cent sour cream  called store just say hey gives? Instead explanation girl answered phone told she would supervisor  supervisor came phone told happened then she told sorry didn't hear want repeat everything all over again  name Cele    She cared little but she didn't even take time explain why paid $1 59 guacamole when actuality bought sour cream  usually don't leave reviews this'll first yelp  just could stand fact supervisor employee store charged something didn't pay for  honestly never even would've looked receipt saw charge more money should've charge if wasn't sour cream hardly even there  <EOR> Nice option fast fresh Mex food  Grab starters Zabapeno balls queso blanco light salty chips did  Create your meal selecting grilled steak chicken shredded beef pork carnitas lime Chipotle shrimp fish  Then add typical  toppings sides create bowl burrito tacos other dishes    If don't feel fashioning your own meal Zaba specials too  guy ordered fish tacos trio corn tortillas  He hungry begin but tacos hefty enough say no mas devouring only two tacos   hand picked bowl grilled steak brown rice black beans fajitas veggies salsa cheese sour cream hit hunger spot too   The wait short when arrived but stretched door sat down  Fortunately line moved quickly friendly service    Again nice option nothing fancy but satisfying  <EOR> I haven't Zaba's since November but somehow charged account SIX times different amounts January 2!! Employees must stealing credit card numbers else would explain this? never going again filing complaint headquarters  You've warned! <EOR> Always 5 star experience all ladies location fast professional friendly!! refer people all time   surf n turf burrito <EOR> Extremely disappointed customer service  coming location past few years well apart loyalty program  recently changed rewards system didn't honor FREE meal which EARNED previous transactions  cashier friendly nor accommodating  Since free meal wasn't honored asked 10% discount LVAC members which she still didn't want honor because free chips salsa day she could give free food   wrote management corporate same day yet receive response regarding matter   While food good zabas more expensive chipotle customer service definitely needs some help  poor customer service honor reward earned loyal member   big fan customer service unfortunately lost customer  They've made clear don't value customers because 1  situation would rectified before walked door 2 someone would contacted now regarding complaint! pretty unfortunate because food great! <EOR> Watch Chipotle!!!!   WHY don't any Zaba's San Diego?????  It's basically Chipotle looks architecture food choices preparation all except very important points which bring Zaba's above par They great whole wheat tortillas option They brown rice well white rice Their red salsa kicks butt They burritos HUGE They breakfast menu They fish tacos They Coke Zero Need say more?  My only gripe server burrito maker obviously hated job downright depressing but food tasty filling affordable   Yum! <EOR> Love salad chicken beans rice avocado lettuce cheese    fresh   Small staff little slow consistent  Sometimes just enough chicken sometimes barely put any on   Need improve that   staff friendly   Prices okay   visit once week take out  <EOR> A OK accurate   love whole wheat tortillas brown rice available cilantro lime shrimp very tasty! <EOR> You know problem when eat 2 3 times week  husband coming years only because food but because service  Everyone works location extremely nice very efficient  busy times but food worth wait  Don't forget Zabas point card  If you're frequent visitor free burrito every once while feel happy! <EOR> It first time Zabas salad option  Loads toppings meat options  Friendly staff clean environment  Everyone raving fish tacos but didn't see menu til paying back try next time! <EOR> I NEVER eat again! charged account 6 times day   over $140 worth! called them told bank glitch duplicated charges  wasn't glitch! multiple transactions various amounts  <EOR> While typically fan quick Mexican food Zabas least favorite similar style eateries  flavors bland leave little want back  positive chips  very tasty  But if looking style food would look Chipotle Qdoba  <EOR> Following model Chipotle Q'doba Zaba's offer quick fresh Mexican food large portions   difference think key though locally owned operated   knowing especially Vegas where everything big flashy commercialized   I've location few others around town many times   food constantly fresh affordable   No matter if bowl burrito salad quesadilla you'll happy result   understand gourmet food but price point you're noting going more value fresher food Zaba's   Support Local! <EOR> My family coming years  people used work great but seems past few months big turnover staff  new staff really slow can't seem your order correctly no matter many times tell them want  still come just because close house food fresh fairly inexpensive But thrilled new employees  <EOR> I love Zaba's! quesadillas incredible well chips  Way better Chipotle opinion  staff very friendly  <EOR> One best spots!!

Anytime want burrito come here  Its always perfect always delicious  <EOR> I know quite few people feel place better Chipotle but strongly disagree  just when visit Chipotle everything looks fresh appetizing restaurant all see grease top layer shredded beef carnitas just sits in  Then some other options potatoes cooked until solid dry just  really unappealing takes away appetite  Workers seemed nice people which good but all act very new if place doesn't much retention employees which again just want walk extra two blocks visit Chipotle  Then food sit down eat decor pretty nice very warm we'll lit music isn't loud conversation fairly easily  But really bothers place food wasn't very good all everything tasted processed! Nothing fresh zing besides fresh lime  Hispanic food supposed fresh tasty  won't going back would rather just place know reliable being Chipotle literally right down street just stick them  <EOR> Don't queso dip terrible  Everything else OK but good Cafe Rio <EOR> First time visiting experience good  service friendly lady interacted 4 year old which he loved   enjoyed flavor chicken but rice little bland  did brown rice wheat tortilla option  didn't queso but hubby loved it  coca cola which bummer  reminded chipotle which good too  2 adults 1 kid cost $26  <EOR> The staff friendly helpful order incorrect food very good  also  small bone chicken children we're sharing could choked on  returning  <EOR> Horrible service tiny amount chicken girls seemed hate every customer doesn't know exactly want  watched 4 people just walk due slow service rude behavior  If hate your job different now hate place going qdoba chipotle honestly even taco bell would better  think girl looked miserable nnaomi some kinda weird name    good god she miserable there  <EOR> Worst service ever  First last time ever patronize place  Learn speak english! <EOR> 4 29 2018 buddy ordered steak burritos received food poisoning thanks costing 1 sick day work <EOR> Extremely dissatisfied experience last night  came ordered always asked flour tortilla side which lady acknowledged nod  usual she rushed through process making mine daughters food she robot assembly line  When checkout asked lady chips salsa which she started do  paid way store peaked back didn't see tortilla back told did give tortilla asked she then proceeded tell would additional  54  cents top already paid  frustrated but told fine said can't eat food without ahead charge card she say would charge $1 00 if wanted use card  Since did cash told ahead give two large flower tortillas charge card  left home find gave 4 small tortillas top didn't give any chips only salsa   So point pay extra tortillas which incorrect ones ordered plus paid chips which didn't receive  Extremely frustrating! should babysit every step sure everything requested done  did part correctly order food responsibility fulfill order correctly  mistake there's which should acknowledged taken care instead greedy wanted more money  <EOR> We frustrated traffic trying look Leticia's Mexican Cucina patience running thin opted Zabas instead    Ordered 2 steak Zaba bowls they ok mediocre really kids meal quesadilla which son didn't even eat although he loves quesadilla that should sign chips guac  sign chips guac $2 99 but if order large guac $3 79 chips stale probably worst $1 79 which cashier failed mentioned pay chips if wanted larger size guac? does regular serving comes then spoonful? mean am going eat guacamole with?
