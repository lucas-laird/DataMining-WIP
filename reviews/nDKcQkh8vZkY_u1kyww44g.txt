if looking Italian again  Prices great! <EOR> I think now favorite restaurant Vegas  city promises more delivers most restaurants    Valentino seems old school Italian know handle large table 7  business dinner    They nice wine list great assortment both California reds wines Italy France Spain       To honest don't remember appetizer but liked it   cannot forget short rib  BEST short rib remember   literally don't  think talked anyone while enjoying fabulous entree   Service competent efficient    Oh tiramisu chocolate mouse deserts bomb  <EOR> My sorority sisters decided eat dinner since relatively close hotel room we bit lazy wander further more restaurant choices    Overall eating great hoped especially price   told them large party 10 people but 2 friends couldn't last minute   received grumpiest look bus boy he angrily took away 2 extra plates utensils he set up   didn't understand why he mad multiple tables left empty seemed pretty slow night   The best part probably free bread   server happy enough keep dishing more bread well refilling drinks timely manner   special pasta ordered really good but portion rather small  <EOR> Located Venetian Valentino upscale Italian restaurant where birthday dinner at  definitely geared more towards fine dining wouldn't recommend coming group college aged people did  atmosphere very quiet dim minimalistic  service okay food good well  Expect shell $  <EOR> Beware Sadly party four received food poisoning calamari appetizer wasn't completely cooked  Main dishes lasagna lamb shank linguini shrimp salmon very good  <EOR> I dined Valentino's restaurant not grille side last night devoured $85 sample tasting menu   Having read raving reviews place expectations which unfortunately met dining experience provided place   Ambiance almost important taste food opinion especially if going experience  area split into written other reviewers grille area casual back fine dining Valentino's   only reviewing fine dining area   Although offers no window didn't feel contained   lighting good ambiance though cozy feel nothing special   The sampling menu ordered gave enough food last till next day  3 small portions each appetizers pasta starch sampler meat sampler dessert sampler  just last night but only thing stood appetizer selection eggplant parmigiana   pumpkin filled ravioli delicious   whole wheat pasta perfectly cooked except sauce which salty liking   tri color gnocchi so so but  because never fan gnocchi the sauce however good    meat sampler good especially beef veal   sauce prawn however overpowered its spicyness could barely tell really taste like   Sadly though generally satisfied meal itself killer came end dessert  which just unfortunate since dessert somewhat considered sacred portion meal   sorbet just sorbet plainly function palette cleanser   caramel creme just sweet   another petite dessert could even recall since just plain again sweet   Perhaps would rated better experience should chosen grille menu instead other restaurant within Valentino's    but then again comes same kitchen   don't know but think having read lot praises magazines restaurant taste buds just higher expectations place  <EOR> I ate Fine Dining Restaurant strongly recommend eating rather Grill worth money romantic memorable experience   Atmosphere decor dark romantic actually asked moved more lighted table arriving because could barely see each other   Wine wine list incredible though pretty long through hard navigate although waiter did offer help navigation   Food Rabbit Sausage Tri Colored Gnocchi Tuna Wrapped Prosciutto   gnocchi best food ever craving ever since ate it   tuna salty couldn't compare gnocchi   Fiancé didn't feel need order off menu chef create Veal Parmesan him   pasta clearly handmade amazing   dessert Tiramisu great ending meal   melted your mouth served chocolate ring delightful   Though pricy strongly recommend worth every penny  <EOR> I give Valentino 3 stars food 2 stars atmosphere 2 stars service 2 1 2 stars value   So round 3 stars total    The food decent  great certainly bad  honest say menu really isn't ally  Everything very heavy often lighter meal    It's just restaurant  Unlike other Vegas restaurants they've really made no attempt give place some ambience  looks kind place grandparents would taken fancy meal 80s    The service ugh  being really generous 2 stars service  only give because did things asked for  But took really really long time everything  weren't greeted waiter 10 minutes he very slow bringing bill  asked watched take several orders bring drinks wander bit     before he actually brought check  waiting tables years multitask dude  also expect restaurant while if fine dining but wasn't relaxed experience fine dining  just bad service    I've better meals but also much worse  However sure ever paid much such poor quality meal service <EOR> Our experience Valentino worst part whole trip   bought coupon Restaurant com picked place because heard Venetian beautiful hotel   hotel great but restaurant back room no windows   food way overpriced great   ended spending $95 two drinks soup salad entree  soup salad $30 same entree Then would take coupon because did order two entree's even though spent $90!! coupon $25 off total bill   never restaurant deny coupon before   guess don't care customer service return visitors   definitely recommend place anyone planning trip Vegas  <EOR> 5 stars upscale Valentino back restaurant 3 stars casual dinning front   highly recomend desserts!  Can't remember but world! <EOR> Perhaps VIP service GM Giorgio Ferrera perhaps because may few cocktails deep but way definitely enjoyed experience Valentino  place sprawling almost cave like maze dimly lit rooms   The service impeccable must say Parmesan chips start nice touch  followed couple bottles David Bruce pinot would later double down couple bottles Italian wine hand picked buddy significantly more knowledge myself subject Tuscans   We all raved appetizer sampler put together chef  followed perfectly cooked Ossobuco sufficiently comatose thereafter  night young could easily rolled over passed out  All in all great dining experience just enough personal touch warrant repeat visit  <EOR> Yes please  Started oysters chef appetizer sampler consisted prosciutto wrapped scallop smoked ham buffalo mozzarella blood sausage cornbread  Then came caprese salad cab wine  am sure brand wine but delish homeboy kept filling glass kept drinking    For main tomahawk rib eye 36 ounces bone in thirty five day ultraviolet light aged mouth watering sex plate  only prepare five day table ordered six someone change order  When waiter mentioned avoided eye contact anyone prepared caveman everyone restaurant if didn't tomahawk   finished all including truffle ravioli asparagus sides since given office nickname Tomahawk   wear nickname pride  liquid desert form grappa limoncello  perfect end perfect meal   I must also mention seated chefs table private room added even more dining experience  If Valentino alive gay would marry him  Valentino   as good gets  Cheers <EOR> Loved it!  Vegas convention needed grab some lunch wasn't forced eat trade show food   Stopped really wanted smoked chicken salad  3pm  Sat down bar found item dinner menu lunch time   manager didn't skip beat  He back chef find if possible  No problem    The salad amazing   smoked chicken done perfectly tender flavorful lean  bartender extremely friend y  fact service everyone wonderful   opportunity sit next writer food wine which made lunch even more interesting     Wish time try again dinner  <EOR> the room dark sumptuous  the menu kind menu could just close eyes point love whatever get   extensive wine list  friendly professional service  my favorite vegas restaurant <EOR> Like all things Vegas Valentino overpriced   alone cost 5th star   But also all things Vegas food service decor well above average   I dined early evening cinco de mayo weekend friend   seated right away service began blink eye   The wine the glass list looong   Sadly started $13 quickly ramped $25+ the top glass $63 no fainting violet when comes paying good wine but made blanch bit    I ordered Pinot Noir which delightful dark berry flavors light easy start finish basically tasted well aged Napa valley Cabernet Savignon   We ordered equivalent fried Mozzarella appetizers but never fried cheese this   breading light crispy marinara smooth garlic y even more cheese blended inside   The salad other hand disappointment   supposed mixed greens mushrooms honey mustard dressing but came dry dry dry mushrooms looked literally come frorm can   No porchini other unusual mushroom types   The big surprise though came dinner   lark it menu any way shape form asked angel hair seasonal vegetables 'pink' sauce   and made me!  wonderful both pasta veggie components I counted least 5 different vegetable types mention  sauce   My friend lasagna tell busy angel hair didn't even remember ask     No coffee no dessert   too full   did large bill $120   feels lot pasta salads etc   Otherwise restaurant impeccable   Good service Good food speedily delivered  <EOR> Let start saying reviews all relative city overall circumstances   other words while am giving restaurant 2 star  meal truck some third world country might given 3 4 stars   point Las Vegas expectations high restaurant fell very short expectation   Normally am much more concerned food ambiance decor parking etc   But case comment surprisingly inexperienced awkward waiter had   He really made dinner uncomfortable   instance he would walk regular basis look over table if he caught eye contact he would quickly turn head start walking other way   But enough waiter because any restaurant could waiter just having bad night   here's scoop food   salmon girlfriend chicken   know most adventurous dishes order but because aren't almost expect restaurant would perfected them   chicken tiny over seasoned somewhat dry   salmon dry lacking flavor   Anyhow dont time break things down further but would suggest stay away   If youre Venetian want Italian try B+B   If dont Italian try Sage Aria   twice both times very good food probably 4+ stars   <EOR> World's best lobster cannollini   Oh gosh   few years since restaurant but still remember dish   don't know if even entree anymore   Chunks fresh lobster meat rolled delicate homemade pasta   light creamy sauce completes dish   don't think ever eaten slowly prolong meal   service excellent  <EOR> amazing meal!!!! <EOR> After week fine dining LV honestly did think any place top already  wrong! seated corner big table  server super attentive very professional yet snobbish  did order any appetizers  Here's ordered Gnocchi cream sauce rabbit sausage risotto crab meat pork loin mashed potatoes lobster ravioli kobe steak  menu  Everything delicious  Very rich

awesome  mushroom ravioli full flavor  delicious  Can't wait come back next time im town  <EOR> Valentino followed Venetian dining tradition T Low ambiance So so service Lacked food quality preparation  Please skip tasting menu   ordered trios   no connection between three except maybe same part food pyramid just weren't very good     'A Taste Menu' Veggie Terrine Smoked Quail Scallop Saltimbocca Terrine jelly creamy grossness   Quail similar lunchmeat  Three Color Gnocchi Bucatini Stuffed Pennoni Very average   Similar pasta Chili's  Tasmanian Salmon Tuna Prociutto Broiled Fluke Can't wrong Salmon but rest WRONG  Veal Shank Kurobota Pork Beef Tagliata  Pork terribly dry veal beef poor quality     I honestly don't remember dessert but remember being happy leave dreaming next GOOD meal  <EOR> What exceptional experience   Beautiful setting deeper into restaurant more impressive gets  lucky members Italian wine club just huge dinner Santa Monica location  lead into private

stumbled Valentino's accident  good fall   Valentino's nice but pretentious  food reasonably priced outstanding quality  service best experienced long time   The menus seating kind confusing  Both Valentino Valentino Grill operate kitchen but two dining rooms  order menu dining room   I thought seated Grill side but seemed more upscale two dining rooms maybe Valentino side  dining companion split caprese salad grilled pizza primavera which am certain grill menu  Both excellent met need light dinner   Valentino place Las Vega$ effort return to  also plan try Santa Monica location when am few weeks   Look discounts Yelp casino marketing packets  <EOR> Nice spot  Enjoyed lunch pizza wagu bisteak wine drinks very nice  Pedro appropriately attentive  <EOR> A restaurant com gift certificate led simple dinner  place itself ok  3 stars ambiance   There definitely numerous menu options sounded delicious  But specials menu mushroom ravioli black truffles pass up? both appetizer portion entree portion  Given tend almost never able finish entire plate anything opted appetizer portion as entree course    Our entrees arrived super fast  SUPER fast  Ridiculously fast  Did somehow already know going order ready us? couldn't even reheat ravioli microwave amount time took food arrive  But hey absolutely delicious am certainly complaining  such quick service would very handy if going show something afterward  4 stars entrees   For dessert opted share mango creme brulee  also came quite fast  quite tasty  mango little bit overpowering tart but kiwi sorbet crunchy brulee provided good balance  3 5 stars   The service great  Very knowledgeable thorough fast  only slight issue came when produced restaurant com gift certificate  waiter tried tell couldn't use unless two entrees and course opted appetizer portion instead entree portion   However gift certificate clearly stated $35 minimum purchase two entrees which lot other restaurant com gift certificates say   he then ask someone somewhere it  would think would take longer whip some mushroom ravioli would inquire gift certificate but so  seriously spent more time waiting re gift certificate entire time took actual meal  yeah annoying  But waiter did finally come back let know all ok  Apparently he just thrown loop because newer restaurant com gift certificates Valentino require purchase two entrees  nice say 4 stars service despite gift certificate glitch   Overall pleasant dining experience some great food  <EOR> Everything good but memorable  <EOR> We stopped purpose time since eaten before wanted knew good Italian food   told two dining rooms combined which fine but then when mentioned bringing friends back October server told Valentino closing six weeks   He wasn't sure why but loss strip   time pumpkin ravioli truffle cream sauce which good husband usual lasagna which he also said amazing   bruschetta appetizer artichoke cheese but just wouldn't order again   wonderful Pino Grigio beverage   sad place closing <EOR> Valentino Venetian to par books  offer nothing but quality service fine meal satisfy every taste bud   My dad visited Valentino last night second visit  Again greeted courtesy professionally  didn't take much time look through menu since only two pages + daily specials   Dad ordered New York steak ordered Costatello braised veal mashed potatoes asparagus  also ordered seafood appetizer everything fried clams fried asparagus   Note appetizers lightly breaded could actually taste food inside rather breading   Every bite worth hope give Valentino least try before turning other way  Price reasonable would expect pay anywhere else Vegas hotel  <EOR> There nothing wrong place  But nothing extraordinary either  quite honest dined mom because 20% coupon  Why not?  The service great couple waiters having work during holidays I during Christmas time upbeat knowledgeable   The food other hand nothing amazing  side roasted vegetables drizzled Balsamic Vinegar fine  also special ravioli day which interesting flavor but texture bit chewier side  did taste nice but overly impressed   Overall nothing spectacular place but tasted fine  little pricier side quality food but coupon wasn't bummed that! <EOR> LOVED PLACE!   service awesome food great   precourse tuna tartare which terrific friends chose pasta black truffles outstanding   main course halibut perfectly cooked   other friend ordered lamb awesome   and don't even eat lamb   Wine list little expensive side but definite must   I'd back again   *I love Venetian Valentinos love even more! <EOR> I'll quick restaurant   When dine choice dining casual less expensive section front formal back area which much more expensive   Money wasn't factor friends formal dining area which told they're known for     I 6 course Chef's Extravaganza menu which 1 starter consisted three types seafood some type broth scallop tuna salmon 2 lobster top tube pasta I can't remember Italian name but found lobster yummy pasta salty taste 3 main course seared ostrich some yummy sauce   wasn't fan ostrich but friend helped finished half ostrich loved dish   Personally thought healthy meal would like  4 also artisan cheese fruit which good   Again being diet only few tiny morsels cheese  5 dessert amazing which bavarian dish carmel ice cream white chocolate sticks some other very sweet goodness   6th dish but don't remember was     I also ordered half dozen Kumamoto oysters which tasted very fresh wonderful   dessert probably favorite dishes night   Oh before forget tasted friend's USDA filet mignon    nice slab meat tasted better ostrich     For price wish wowed every dishes   I'd probably give 3 5 4 stars  <EOR> Not expected reading other reviews   We greeted warmly taken back dining room which quiet romantic   Score one    given extensive wine list impressive menus left 15 minutes   No bread no water nothing   only other table dinners time    Finally server brings over bread tray explains which breads which    nice touch   breads good   Though pre sliced raisin very dry seemed more day old   olive bread good     Finally now 20 minutes wait staff shows up    She's Barbie girl says  sure  guys   supposedly 4 star restaurant??!!   know trouble   She says she'll give few minutes look menu 20 already return glass wine list oops she forgot specials she'll back   Another 10 minutes by     Finally Barbie girl back   now ready chew leg off table   She takes deep breath reels off specials I don't know if she's written them back hand     sure some them good probably really good   But many she said them fast only heard two probably 10+    If going try impress your patrons multiple specials each category write them put them menus!

The entree prices reasonable anywhere between $14 $30 but just felt food already made ahead time just heated up    In opinion just fine dining  should done   The service definitely excellent though <EOR> Service good but food disappointing! wasn't hungry opted grilled pizza tomato sauce cheese fresh herbs $12  People always say there's no such thing bad pizza  Um yeah would Valentino's  big pizza very thing crust but tasted cheap $2 frozen pizza your grocer's freezer  much sauce made crust soggy sauce no real flavour which made pizza bland  cheese some generic cheese no flavour  would nice margarita pizza some fresh mozzarella basil tomato  No dried herbs sprinkled soggy cheese pizza  better slices greasy spoon  disappointing didn't eat more two slices  Other people table lasagna noted dry lacked sauce  bad didn't put overabundance sauce pizza onto lasagna   Ambiance alright portions seemed good price  But quality definitely lacking here  Skip place don't lazy leave hotel find better Italian restaurant  <EOR> All star night sisters celebrating 50th birthday  Brought own wine A Rafanelli paid corkage $35 each 2 bottles starter tuna carpaccio followed veal short ribs flat iron steak salmon  Waiter brought 2 favorite desserts table 4 share beautiful tasty  Expensive restaurant but Valentino delivered outstanding experience  <EOR> Not bad but wow   Definitely worth money   Service lacking   Vegas experinece Venetian standards  <EOR> I arrived Vegas few hours prior 7 00 reservation 1  Seated very back off corner took quite some time anyone drop off menu order glass wine  place empty  also received 20% off total check when checked yelp which great! buffalo mozzarella salad delicious   could used bit more basil however entree ravioli  Another delicious tasty dish! didn't once room dessert 2 glasses wine  Upscale yes but service could use little bit work  <EOR> Wow could possibly write convey amazing experience was?
