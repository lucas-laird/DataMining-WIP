He is! Sure enough he runs kitchen comes cart all ingredients guac  time he done making guac food coming out  such big deal anything because ate guac meals but come man your job!   As far food nothing really stood out  place self serve chips salsa bar  unlimited chips well different kinds salsa bean dip  pretty much filled chips am glad did  3 item combo chose chile relleno chicken carne asada taco rice beans  chile relleno okay tacos meh rice beans standard  Nothing memorable meal  Mom fajitas which looked tasty but cooked liking even though asked them well done  dad steak honestly mess steak? He seemed enjoy meal  afer paid way mom remembered supposed dessert fried bread sugar honey which included meals  asked John he said Oh didn't know wanted them  Well did ask?
