The sushi fresh made tinier normal sushi  ostensibly try all different types sushi without getting super full which nice  came mostly udon  Warm noodle soup long night Vegas? Yes please! think better sushi buffets Vegas e g  Makino but Todai bad option if you're looking more general seafood something more just sushi   Inside spacious same decor all Todai's  Oddly even though plenty open tables when group 8 stopped when asked switch table closer TV caused kind ruckus  Other staff very nice   Unlike other buffets pay extra drinks which kind pain  Also beware  clear away food lunch even though may let sit restaurant past lunch hours all food sadly gone   tl dr don't really anything against Todai  food good plenty but Todai chain don't necessarily think Vegas enjoy it  <EOR> I am sushi lover any place great sushi ayce? win   The quality great too  service experienced great    I another Todai San Diego definitely wasn't par location  <EOR> I visited establishment first time last month when attended trade show conference  Todai's Monday evening right when opened dinner   I specifically sushi sashimi quite selection  also huge selection cooked foods desserts but didn't bother any those   I'm sure lot sushi addicts argue place average but found location easy 10 15 minute walking distance any major strip hotel which huge plus since hate drive around LV don't waste money cab if sober    The restaurant clean waiters staff attentive    I'm sure place would Fri Sat Sun night but experience Monday evening more acceptable  bit pricey side but all eat  <EOR> I may best review place since didn't eat sushi  rice teriyaki chicken ok but rice weird taste it  tempura vegetables bland desserts lacked flavor  did enjoy walnut tarts but extent really liked  Children should free especially since child decided 5 bites dinner enough   My husband other hand tried every single sushi roll because he liked them much much he sick   it first probably last time there  <EOR> Excellent sushi buffet hot items well   date night type atmosphere just real good food   love lunch!

Consider Todai locates big shopping malls significant Hotel Resort beside Todai good brand name buffet restaurant chain  would hope experience such place price $34 ticket regular dinner not weekend ? They carries most kinds food any other asian buffets expected sushi crab legs shrimps salads tempuras stirred fried vegetable fried noodle fried rice beef sausage dessert including crepe served order 2 flavors ice creams cream brûlée cakes cookies  name it  BUT 1  place foods show cases just little only bring some more when foods almost run out  might new hot dish if enough time patience   2  Presentation foods looks cheap  feeling afraid customers would eat much   3  Table chairs much standard might see some affordable restaurants China Town   4  Restroom looks dirty well maintenance     I admit good salads veggie tempura stirred fried crab  Beside did anything else though husband said some ok but nothing special  Before entrance Todai through hallway nice small restaurants 2 sides  did try any them I wished would recommend stick right there  Don't further  <EOR> In land where buffets boss people really still prefer Todai? Evidently temptation Japanese seafood powerful resist even multiple occasions  Through all better Japanese AYCE spots city but may boil down most warm comforts chain bring   The Miracle Mile Planet Hollywood no stranger franchised storefronts all its back bone many Vegas entities casinos restaurants  Where Todai comes into play fact its only Japanese branded buffet strip where anything similar usually hodgepodge Asian items  Todai isn't really uniquely Japanese per se but great place burn some moolah heap food   What should come no surprise anyone Todai strip carries semi hefty price tag $35 per person especially during dinner hour  personally believe if anyone going throw down some bucks let during dinner  full arsenal the best stuff likely full display   While array sushi rolls visually appealing seem heavier rice decorations just tad skimpy meat  same idea applies nigiri sushi  While crab legs plentiful numbers actual legs themselves don't lot substance  hot hot food pun intended but shoot occasional baked claim even if its loaded mayo crappy spices    Whenever possible shoot sashimi which includes more just salmon tuna but yellowtail white tuna scallops  may overly fresh just sitting bed ice but represents best raw selection probably only way one's moneys worth without having shovel endless food your mouth  Unfortunately many others adopting philosophy sashimi inventory gets cleaned pretty quick   While everything noted generic such two stars really comes lack quality service  Sure its buffet people really serving themselves  But service industry Las Vegas regarded best world especially any establishment any resorts along strip  understand holding Todai might impossible standard but no excuse being ignored drinks dirty plates almost every visit here   At least desserts rule  <EOR> We missing Todai couple years when its Schaumburg location closed  when came Vegas found todai very excited dine again  Well Todai memory probably because spoiled other seafood buffet   Anyway regarding sushi rice wasn't cooked right  Sushi rice way overcooked tasted sticky similar batch produced sushi quality sold Costco  There's no sashimi least lunch  Soft drinks extra fee   Actually understand why Schaumburg location closed  Royal buffet same area way better  The price reasonable good deal strip area Vegas comparison other buffet  <EOR> I came Todai lunch boyfriend since he craving some Shrimp Tempura  Needless say he plates plates more plates Shrimp Tempura    For $20 per person pretty good variety food mostly sushi rolls  also Salmon Tuna Nigiri salads udon station some desserts  Unfortunately no crab during lunch    My favorite part buffet would udon station  Just ring bell someone come bowl  add fish cake sweet tofu green onions few other things  warning broth salty side wouldn't drink if you   With plethora other buffets choose Vegas don't think would care come back  <EOR> I came while back husband bf time dinner here   Before allowed hostess told price assuming can't afford it asked if wanted stay   Upon hearing should just walked away but didn't   told wanted check food first before decide   end decided stay   totally regret doing this   quantity selection food limited   really unhappy throughout night because this  never come back place again  <EOR> Huge fan Todai dragged woman while Sin City   Big Mistake     Sushi sub par atmosphere depressing hot food bleh   Compared Todais California Red headed step sister freckles   Sorry Todai Las Vegas but Fail   Please send rep Todai Westminster Steal Mgr bring one  la Patrick Swayze Roadhouse  <EOR> Sushi Buffet   always trip Todai whenever vist Vegas   realized today sushi very inconsistent   why gave them three stars    I enjoyed most visits Todai past but today very disappointing    Every time  come always flip coin Todai Makinos   Unfortunately Makinos located away Strip   Therefore easier trip Todai instead Makinos   If Makinos located along Strip would always choose Makinos rather Todai  <EOR> Everything seemed dry color sushi looked little pale opinion  other words fresh all  am coming back choose different place  <EOR> Ok     big crab leg snob! But super disappointed waiting dinner paying more iced soaked frozen tasteless crab legs  didn't even try hide fact frozen having boxes them next buffet  would recommend lunch only!  On plus side sushi selection flavor great  Probably over 20 varieties sushi select from   also okay customer service nothing write home about    Overall glad didn't pay full price dinner  probably wouldn't back dinner  <EOR> Las Vegas strip offers best cuisines world    WRONG!!!!!

Even better bill   $39 compared near $50 some buffett   Only trouble ate much  <EOR> I normally Todai someone's Birthday  thing love custom crepes  Other items just so so including crabs dinner   This Todai 1 star its food but its attitude  few years ago  planning quick lunch before airport  arrived before opened lunch very long line before but figured could still it  However opened scheduled although saw waitresses inside chatting each other kill time  15 minutes passed still no opened door just explain crowd happening when door would opened   I accept mediocre food price but restaurant showed no respect customers never again  <EOR> I haven't big fan Todai while   I'm absolutely convinced last Fall's bout food poisoning thought going die direct result oysters   But missus likes place well know goes   just avoid oysters cursed   I'm generally okay Todai long smart choices   always thought little pricey when Yama Sushi much more fresh tasting menu cheaper price but lunch yesterday lunch cheaper meal   Except yesterday   What should $20 dollar meal turned $40 person   Why ask?  Mother's Day   let straight celebrate love all wonderful things Mothers done throughout lives restaurant decides celebrate Mom charging double regular prices same meal selections offer other 364 days year?  God going dread seeing decide honor Dads   Seriously no balloons flowers nothing   server made no mention price doubling though maintained sign front   credit did    fairly discreet location could miss if didn't down right walkway into restaurant   The people front complained did manager very nicely apologized gave 20% off meal's cost though still more average lunch would cost   No incentives unique items did worth it   I imagine back missus loves place well know goes   just felt sneaky double prices no real mention even website offer nothing justify value upgrade    Bad form Todai   Bad form  <EOR> One thing really love Todai fried rice  fried rice buy down street your house unless live near hibachi joint   right hibachi quality fried rice  lot entree decent but expected Las Vegas  Dessert other hand just eh   pass  <EOR> Todai probably best Japanese sushi buffet ever had  food selection pretty thorough  salad bar fruit bar dessert bar soups taco random small American meats section wide selection Japanese dishes even suki yaki huge sushi nigiri selection  taken aback selection  think worth 21 95 if sushi  Japanese hot dishes decent but sushi exXxcellentee!  Obviously fine grade shite but buffet impressed  Also say salmon used very fresh  I'd totally come back Todai next time Vegas           Visit Todai today! har har har <EOR> Buffet sushi?  Doesn't sound good idea   But place convinced otherwise     Tons good sushi other buffet items crab legs shrimp teriyaki salads etc  really tried hardest taste them all   don't think single thing disappointed which itself pretty amazing     Food 5 stars Service 3 5 stars quick refill drinks take plates but took soy sauce away preparing close half hour later   cool  The big issue Todai probably impact decision return?  overpriced   $35 dinner buffet?  C'mon   Even better average food strip still pushing envelope price  <EOR> By far best Todai ever to  Love poke  fresh taste remained same even many months since taste them again  Many different sushi choose course favorite crab legs alone definitely come back every time am Vegas   There good selection soups dessert  Did mention fresh made crepes where choose fruits chocolate nuts caramel stuffing topping? Don't forget green tea ice cream if much into exotic flavor then there's vanilla   What's cool walk off calories through Miracle Mile shops  <EOR> I debated whether give 2 5 stars 3 but three   brought friend experience sushi first time  figured there's such wide variety she'd good idea its all about   Todai definitely pricey over $30 per person  Unfortunately almost empty when arrived which meant sushi being pumped fresh  ikura favorite consisted gummy roe definitely old side  Folks nothing nastier non fresh salmon roe  GROSS   Some other sushi obviously sitting while well leaving deeply disappointed  wasn't all awful but over $30 per person old sushi unacceptable     I bumped rating three stars because think during more crowded period sushi would fresh therefore more worth price  Still $30 isn't something paying any time soon visit Todai  <EOR> Of all Todai's too    love Las Vegas Todai most  more selections really friendly service  some reason didnt sick off Todai   hahahaha arcadia  usually purty sick   eWwww   haahhaha <EOR> 6 years ago when tourist Vegas thought best sushi buffet ever   last week totally thought sucked   Makino Sushi Factory Sushi Hana Sandai   all better place   buffet just vast sea mediocrity best   One funny story though when living NYC came friend  eaten ton lunch stuffed gills BUT THEN friend saw made crepes back   He loves crepes more almost anything world   SO   he bathroom puke he could some room crepes!!!

Ok perhaps experience good thing  nothing wrong just didn't same wonderful wow factor other sushi given me  But persevered tried almost everything set out  nigiri better rolls snapped quickly predominantly Asian clientele  dining here  tempura later looked fabulous but did really deliver taste   Had just all you can eat crab fest last month sure would've enjoyed piles Snow Crab legs served but skipped those  Tons other offerings but little just wanted raw can't consume much didn't try other choices Korean BBQ 3 kinds soups stir fry lots cooked fishies  Desserts looked great Larry plate full those   Service fast friendly waitress coming constantly keep teacup full clearing plates   In end felt price somewhat high quality around $28 per person dine discount then later when back room found 20% off coupon hotel magazine  Damn! Wouldn't made much difference course but hate when happens    I probably would try different place next time saw other sushi buffets mentioned sounded better  I'd give 3 stars but just felt price quality wouldn't justify that  <EOR> Was torn between giving them 3 4 stars   Decided 4 stars cause always clean   4 5 times lunch   prices reasonable comparable more popular buffets hotels Strip $24 lunch   There plethora sushi other seafood choose from   If don't sushi then plenty hot entrees choose well   You're sure find something like   Don't forget save room dessert   crepes made right front taste delicious!  plenty mini desserts choose sample   All them much better ones found Chinese restaurant buffets   I recommend eating rather Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet  <EOR> Alright Todai first off opened late  know servers need meetings but rude keep hungry people waiting! started off sushi thought decent  Some pieces fell apart which made hard eat but still tasted pretty good   Then chow mein  LOVE chow mein pretty much eat everywhere go  definitely decent but wow need more ASAP  also tried Udon soup really enjoyed broth   tofu put bowl did taste good broth though  felt tofu another taste didn't fit well brother  desserts super cute!
