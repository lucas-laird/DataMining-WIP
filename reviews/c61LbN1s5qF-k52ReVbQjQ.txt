I'm familiar Denny's chain don't know location compares others keep mind if read review   myself SEMA show town hoping just seat counter service   Well didn't happen because don't any bar counter service   No big deal seated table 10 minute wait   The service definitely top notch but didn't expect be   waiter friendly enough picky   However coffee hot tasted watery      liked able create own Grand Slam because special diet physical training being able pick all items limited carbohydrates welcome option   know hard find food when dining minimal carbohydrates?    VERY   food bad but definitely very good   However only spending $12 big breakfast nice change   While eating employees brought really noisy vacuum 15 minutes just vacuum some crumbs   little annoying 5 minutes more annoying 10 minutes REALLY annoying 15 minutes   don't know other restaurants but never eat vacuum ear  <EOR> Good pricing standard menu  Grand Slam combo fantastic offered lot healthful options  cab fare Luxor $8 which reasonable ish  <EOR> So order simple breakfast  Just some eggs toast bacon  asked toast no butter bacon crispy  When food  heavy butter toast bacon soggy put hash brown  told them food wrong  guy delivered food rude said give your plate waiter laughing   Another gentlemen stepped helped kind  Kevin believe name   apologizing them  service sucked  way put damper day Vegas   Thru time seated til left  waiter no where found  Never eat again <EOR> Ate breakfast twice last trip Las Vegas  Early week Tuesday crowded but no wait  Friday wait but less 15 minutes  place noisy   Service both visits could better  Being busy no excuse ignoring customers  almost tackle waitress 2nd cup coffee   Waited forever food toast didn't come meal wait again that   Food good prices aren't bad  <EOR> The service food good however air conditioner freezing cold temperature everybody inside complaining    said cause kitchen gets hot! But really? Don't air conditioner kitchen another clients! horrible stay inside <EOR> Upon arrival line which understandable during mid morning  fully prepared wait knowing five us  Surprisingly seated almost right away  Then experience downhill  waited table 10 minutes before server not ours came over offered grab drinks seeing server over yet  server came over while other gentleman grabbed drinks rudely asked wanted drink  When told someone else getting drinks she didn't think twice rudely continued ask if ready order  She easily confused while ordered even though did modify any orders  Once food came 20 minutes later she brought walked away without asking if needed anything  halfway done food before she finally came back over asked if needed anything  asked refill orange juice  She rudely stated wasn't free refills said okay  If worried would asked if free refills before ordering another  She brings over bill no surprise she messed up  She tried charging 3 coffees when only ordered one  gentleman brought drinks over mistakenly grabbed two when questioned she disgustedly said But drank   Finally when manager comes over he gets confused which coffees remove which mattered because paying separately  He decided take off all drinks because he couldn't figure out  Never once did he apologize confusion lack service  <EOR> Service super slow but based going 2am quick meal   say did good job steak eggs! <EOR> Passable but greasy food plate looked sad some people poorly made Disney costumes strip  Long line slow service poor table staff  waiter friendly but inattentive probably under staffed given absurd line   Considering Thursday can't imagine even reasonably good weekend    Sadly if you're sit down non buffet breakfast 11 really your only choice nearby  <EOR> Prices over inflated everything else Strip  Good food good prices good service  refreshing find Strip!   Be sure check value menu which seemed suspiciously removed all tables times but available when asked    Initially looked crowded waiting area but wait times no longer 10 minutes    We back many times breakfast dinner during trip  good quality food helped keep costs down  <EOR> Servicio terrible entramos y despues para que nos atendieran duraron mas de 15 min en decirnos q vamos tomar para no hacerla tan larga toda espera duro mas de una hora hasta Cuando nos trajeron la comida y frio todo  No recomiendo esta locacion  <EOR> It most reasonable price breakfast around know getting  Denny's across Mirage take escalator contest giving away Bloody Marys top Lots people waiting but line super fast! Alot people fit into Denny's keep them moving  ate twice would back  Fit Slam avocado  Perfect! <EOR> I am fan Denny's restaurants     just  ones LV other north end strip   The moment walk gotta seat yourself  Then takes them another 20 minutes server bring menus take your orders  Then another 20 minutes your food arrive the food's really good begin Not mention other people around look homeless just lost rent $ next door @ MGM someones drugged outta mind  Yes prices cheap inflated  but could easily find something else eat similar prices prices  <EOR> Yuck!  I breakfast friends since familiar Denny's brand eaten Denny's locations before  service good fast but overall cleanliness place turned off most   Where sat chewed gum attached around booth sitting at  something want see view when am eating  Also waitress nice open closed sores all over arms even band aid  Please cover when serving customers food!  The omelet ordered beyond mediocre  tasted powdered eggs hadn't cooked thoroughly cheese slathered all over overpowered dish completely  felt eating cheese side egg  mention also drenched oil grease  bacon only thing plate delicious  But bacon always delicious doesn't count much  sausage also poorly cooked almost tasted rubbery   I would recommend place anyone Vegas looking really good breakfast  Denny's cheap affordable side but place grossed out  would come back here  <EOR> Probably only Denny's you'll find customer service five star restaurant!!! <EOR> Good food   bad customer service  Even slow night walk around if don't tables  Very inattentive basically only saw server twice waited longer bill  Want kill some time?
