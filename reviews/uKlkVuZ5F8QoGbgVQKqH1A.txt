Did ever tell thought came word Fathlete only hopes dreams crushed urban dictionary? Another story another day   on Firkin Paradise   I've few times co workers going away parties  I'd say majority experiences beer n' app's  shabby pretty mean onion raaang  when saw doing Groupon jumped opportunity   On quiet no plans just back vacation really feel hanging anyone kind night wife decided redeem Groupon grab some grub here  pleasantly surprised when walked UFC playing every TV blasting over sound system  kind weird Saturday night outside bar weren't advertising showing fight food specials listed Mon Fri but nothing Saturday night  Huh?   So chicken strips which sounded made similar fashion fish n' chips  Whoa world class bad strips  Over cooked stringy batter just tasted poor  waitress fantastic took back offered bring something else  plain ol' cheeseburger which real good  Nothing special just good bar burger  wife parmesan grilled cheese  Here's problem ran parmesan bread plain grilled cheese  part don't understand when run item why just assume somone won't know item isn't described serve anyways? Como que what? decent grilled cheese every 6yo world would satisfied  bread pudding very good would recommend that    So overall pretty poor dining experience  would still come if someone having party sorts beer great but wouldn't way break bread establishment   Schmeh    <EOR> Brought friends dinner when came Las Vegas  before really liked fish chips  Everything came good usual except wife's Shepard's pie  tasted funny nowhere close good  Unfortunately waitress NEVER came back check drink orders? wife ended sharing order fish chips eating order  Never any questions staff when waitress finally showed face everyone else done looking more drinks price uneaten meal  would back but would strictly stick fish chips  Also screaming ass loud night  <EOR> So numerous drive bys place wondering myself hell firkin finally decided google it   And well glad did   I came group 6 people meet before headed down see Evil Dead musical  greeted 2 different hostesses which immediate thumbs book   Our server super silly which made evening fun he recommended all sorts different beers specials which really helpful  Pabst buck if tickles anyones fancy   The interior really awesome still clean because new  plus tv's pool tables   Onto food  Turkey melt which really fresh tasting turkey avocado cheese mango chutney grilled panini style garlic fries  is    delicious highly recommend it  Pretty much everyone table wish ordered too  boyfriend tuna melt which he thought great well  Other food items ordered grilled cheese meatloaf fish chips burger  Everyone loved meals but apparently burger voted meh    Overall great food atmosphere nice except night half place super clubby annoying don't mind little dubstep but seriously just didnt jive rest place service cool booze specials made much better    I also ended coming lunch yesterday boyfriend again place kind dead but still food pretty legit definitely recommend lunch place well if want low key spot meet  <EOR> I came recommendation resident work  warned if I'd write review  honest review  Well lets just say 3 stars being nice because undecided between 2 3  outstanding service waitress why 3  because I'd return alone chicken wings  place wings good doesn't deserve 2 stars  garlic parmesan  Although bunch unique flavors pineapple curry  Not brave We ordered meat pie style dish chicken piccata   I'm sorry friend if you're reading but absolute worst chicken piccata ever tasted  meat pie decent but enough meat potatoes veggies     On positive note another thing I'd return Bloody Mary! Oh yeah she hooked nice spicy olives n all! Well done cute waitress 49ers shirt  won't hold your team against bar skills that!  Ill see again wings drinks! <EOR> Before please understand am coming perspective local huge beer geek   normally don't drop names other establishments reviews but when comes beer take things seriously  being said mixed feelings Firkin   definitely few things would improve   Overall though place awesome addition Vegas bar scene look forward future visits!  Let's begin shall we?  Beer first!  name 'Firkin' would think would cask ale google it!    Unfortunately no cask ale although told bartender woman appeared manger working getting cask ale   am hopeful Firkin join ranks Todd English Pub Public House establishments serve cask ale and hopefully serve properly      The beer selections mostly English ales few them being mediocre Newcastles Guinnesses UK   selection fine craft beer suffers expense bar's theme suppose   did Firestone Walker Union Jack Double Jack Dogfish Head 60   enjoyed Innis Gunn Rum Cask ale   also 10 rotating seasonal self serve taps things kind fun!  Watch though because beers range $6 8 piece although deals Newcastles   Overall beer selection great Vegas bars but disappointing compared likes Aces Ales Khoury's Fine Wine Spirits   am fine considering crappy beer served most Vegas pubs Hofbrauhaus across street   On really loved food!  ordered house French Dip $11 95    bad price tourist place   roast beef really juicy onions grilled perfectly touch horse radish baguette bun amazingly delicious french dip!  tried bite friend's curry although little sweet taste full flavor quite delicious   perfect french fries lightly battered yet still light fluffy   Very good food affordable price returning customer!  The atmosphere nice social no slot machines which plus book   Lots TV's   staff very friendly although somewhat lacking beer knowledge   expect staff educated place evolves   promised addition cask ale exciting   would see them hire Cicerone also knows cask beer www ukbrewing com FAQ!   <EOR> Look   it is strip mall bar Las Vegas   Pros learned the breakfast shot butterscotch schnapps irish whiskey slice bacon OJ back  nice staff   Cons cheesey aesthetic mellow enough atmosphere sports tv strip mall bar Las Vegas <EOR> We tried 3 Mondays between noon 1 PM but doors aren't open no hours posted no info website no message phone deliveries being accepted back door  online coupons offer discounts 11 3 but even open?

Great drinks great bartender Matt just awesome! Definitely needed last two places  <EOR> The food firkin slightly disappointing   husband ordered cottage pie which sweet served gravy tasted raw flour   fish chips   fish pretty decent   ordered onion rings appetizer good but could see puddles oil sitting plate   beer wall concept cool large selection beer   good place drink watch game but don't appetite   waiting staff nice but never informed specials   rushed into paying bill   Getting water refills near impossible  <EOR> I'm really disappointed place  come Vegas work lot stay across street  few friends around 11pm sat table bar area  bartender told he didn't server would walk bar order  Annoying!! Really?

Why? did only give 3 stars? Well first arrived bit late once did waitress come table ask if wanted anything   6 other people yet hour half she didn't check but once close tab time  already gone off bar   very friendly british guy behind bar he noticed walk right away even crowd he even called hunny which ill take over ma'am anyday !  The venue pretty nice watch fight place decent amount space   Lots TVs choose see show   Downside didn't turn subtitles impossible hear any commentary   I can't speak food but beer flowing nice vibe just wish waitress friendlier! She refused split friends tab which understand mind its hard otherwise but making people math split everything just no fun! mostly hurt long run cause def took points off tip  <EOR> Checking Firkin Paradise swayed away regular menu because Tuesday offering AYCE Chicken Wings $12 95 per person! It's usually $9 95 lb  when take advantage AYCE wings also $1 PRBs!   The Husband tried few flavors Bourbon Chipotle Parmesan Garlic Cajun Southern Fried Pineapple Curry Buffalo   Sadly weren't blown away any flavors most along sweet end   wish Parmesan garlic more garlicky taste   all served Firkin Dip which pretty much tasted Ranch dressing   wings served super hot generous amount meat them  definitely plus   Because made order probably best put your next order once first order comes out   way aren't waiting long between each round   probably wouldn't AYCE chicken wings again though   On another visit both finally ordered off regular menu   * Butler 8 oz USDA Flatiron Steak served asparagus whipped potatoes  $13 95 steak rather under seasoned which apparent all Worcheshire sauce dumping it   whipped potatoes could used more butter perhaps just expected more butter?  * Traditional Fish N Chips Crispy Alaskan Cod hand battered Exclusive Pub made Beer Batter   Served Fries Tangy Tartar Sauce Grilled Lemon  Piece $10 95 Two Pieces $13 95 Husband two pieces great choice was   some really good fish chips!  also able substitute fries garlic fries which also super yummy   probably enjoyed more meal own!  Overall food alright exception fish n chips which probably we'd back for    Service fine seemed worked team since many hands touched table  The waiter waitress took beverage food order busboys brought food etc  chose sit tables bar instead booth could watch TVs   They unique beer card similar seen wine bar   Basically pay card certain denomination but sample little bit each beer tap   take little lot just deducts your card   Useful when just want sample bit everything   self service along back   happy hour specials along decent drink menu prices listed   One other thing no hot water restroom?! <EOR> Beer wings  place go  Clean English style interior place neat cozy same time  Variety beer selection daily promotion would attract beer lovers pub  15 different wing flavors buffalo pineapple curry huge wings definitely works foodies me  All eat wings $12 99 wednesday worth try all different flavors many can  If looking place escape smokey bars Las vegas highly encourage visit smoke free cozy Firkin Paradise  <EOR> What Firk?!

I ordered BLT avocado salad  appreciate salad available no additional charge full bowl worth greens  BLT would expect solid bar BLT  Lots bacon thick wheat bread added bonus big hunks avocado  simple respectable BLT just touch fanciness    The beer selection worth visit too  all $1 PBR but when am complaining! <EOR> A local friend meeting lunch suggested place thought pretty darn good! Located rather nondescript strip mall off main drag met all expectations might any Americanized British sports pub union jacks galore pool tables TVs playing all manner sports waitresses tight t shirts  menu similarly follows suit British y things Cottage Pie mixed amongst usual burgers sandwiches etc  tuna melt garlic fries friends ordered mac n cheese cottage pie  tuna melt perfectly good satisfying all crispy outside lots tuna goodness inside plus jalapenos  I always extra   fries also good nicely fried fresh garlic wow  friend's mac n cheese looked absolutely decadent cottage pie cute its little white tufts mashed potatoes top  Overall fine time Firkin friendly relaxed place Yelp check deal  10% off your bill 11 3  <EOR> First experience left sour taste mouth  sat 15 minutes booth before even approached  saw employees standing around bar server working few booths bartender picked few there  hurry since friend joining me  eventually beer continued wait  30 minutes 45 minutes friend arrived no approached see if he wanted anything  point bar cashed walked across street another gastropub   Today back give another try  Yet again off shaky start  10 minutes without being acknowledged  15 minutes bartender came by  beer took some time come around take food order  Once better  food specials dirt cheap  Service still little spotty  understand bars different restaurants  just wish staff could little more observant surroundings  rude all downright pleasant just unfocused    The Firkin burger great deal  Especially when $7 pairing any domestic pint  $ 50 wings puts chains shame  steroid birds meaty juicy breaded  Sadly fish chips unremarkable  breading filets nuggets thick  crispy but when coat anything thick shell bound crunch  Firkin's some essences pub but tends lean more towards family eatery  mix menu allows options  could good thing those wants pasta pizzas but leaves wanting more traditional UK fare  <EOR> Nothing special  McMullans better  food alright  Great service friendly bartenders  Only bar High Sierra beer Reno  Its English? Maybe Irish? confused  Cheap beer before Hardrock concert only real reason outside friendly bartenders <EOR> Go beer  pretty typical tasting bar food unless  your looking say skip it  We Sunday which time year usually busy times bars everyone getting football on  But pulled looked pretty empty just handful people bar cheering team choice  few more groups showed during time but never busy  The service okay waitress patient first timer questions  But once time came shift end she couldn't help bugging while still eating if we'd dessert if we'd mind paying bill  Then pretty much ignored next shift assumed if wanted something now bar  I some wings good sized cooked perfect but sauce lacking  If wings ask extra sauce  sampled Jameson glazed which sweet but hardly any sauce wings seemed bland  Sweet chili other sauce spicy all but nice Asian taste  hubby tried order French Dip but didn't any he Firkin Burger garlic fries  burger pretty much dry frozen burger fancied toppings  garlic fries tasty but wasn't impressed  friends ordered Onion Rings which try big thick batter dipped rings tad greasy but still pretty good   The Beer Wall pretty good deal if you're looking sample different beer  usually 10 choose pour yourself  If your local plan drinking lot coming back Beer Wall special  Overall place over priced all special more more bars bevy brews chose from  <EOR> Visited Firkin several weeks ago before Thomas Mack event some pre show drinking dining   some sort construction remodeling happening within opened late day but only wait few minutes before being let in   What great looking place   Loved decor throughout particularly wood flooring magnificent looking bar   Maybe all bars look 3pm no customers not situation used to but no seriously can't look good   Then again only open few months don't blame if visit 2023 based review find walls floors covered various dried body fluids   Plus use some Banksy artwork menu can't wrong Banksy book  I immediately started black tan because tend forget its existence wherever its listed always excited when see menu pokes memory delicious are   further confirmed Firkin visit   As food shared order onion rings friends delicious   Very heavily battered which way it   didn't even damn onion still scarfed down reckless abandon   say almost am never disappointed onion rings unless they're small over fried say burger king     I also tried Firkin Burger based thought several positive reviews Yelp   Now scouring through them don't see many thought there   Anyway pretty big disappointment me   Perhaps spoiled neighborhood Bachi Burger which probably 80% all burger dining experiences nowadays but thought wasn't very well seasoned just tasted average general   fries accompanied because really need life more fries tasty   To finish off pre eventing did round Jameson shots nothing says Ballet Jameson shots!   Okay going see WWE     quick chat bartender brought said shots    waitress bartender everyone friendly service fast efficient    Overall I'd say 3 food but service atmosphere easy 4 overall  <EOR> We ate dinner last night Vegas  only reason because walking distance hotel  am glad close needless say! staff amazing  decor warm comforting inviting  food beer selection sold completely   husband found beer he used drink but available current area  ordered mac cheese ham  Oh wow  very good  regular mac cheese  cheese sauce different but good different! husband ordered chicken pot pie amazing  took few bites perfect  If known Firkin beforehand would eaten again before leaving!!! <EOR> Definitely great new British Pub add Eastside   Located across Hofbrahaus place very unique its atmosphere but more importantly great food! service great offer food very reasonable price large portions   Very worth short drive <EOR> I visited place first time through Groupon purchase  boyfriend visited around lunch time weekday  wasn't  crowded all service very good  don't know night time weekend though   We ordered Homemade Tomato Soup  Traditional Fish 'n' Chips  Mama's Meatloaf  wonderful  soup great  Meatloaf favorite food  meatloaf best ever had  Fish n Chips also very good  Fish cooked perfection tender  batter great flavor    They pretty good beer selections well    Next time when am town visit place again  nice hang place  <EOR> Never ever again  First time just two us  service TERRIBLE  just oh well is just a bar kinda way but clumsy forgetful impatient kinda rude  food average wait time unacceptable  Fast forward neighborhood again time some friends  Walk front door party 5 immediately told $5 charge per person because showing some fight television  didn't matter just bite eat charging ticket prices boxing match  least other party walked away when did meaning want $35 stupid fight probably lost $150 $200 actual food beverage sales  Whoever running place needs wise before run themselves business  <EOR> Really good burger  Cooked seasoned perfectly  chicken fingers delicious  Fries just ok but portions plentiful yet much  only person working bar floor during time there  took few minutes service but once did all well  before show Hard Rock  Great location   Great place watch sports all TVs  Viewing TVs limited if sit booth Overall great experience  definitely back  <EOR> I bought Groupon place months ago then bam before knew time passed expire  worth $30 didn't want waste Mel C  ate last day valid   place pretty empty Friday late afternoon most people bar   ended ordering tuna sandwich just okay   Neither Mel nor impressed food   probably great place watch game drink if  you're looking but wouldn't come just food  <EOR> I firends birthday  Grabbed taste Wyder's Pear Cider fell love  Great college spot near UNLV  Decent pricing  also pool table shuffle board game  <EOR> Stopped today Wednesday  Nice atmosphere but if you're local hard bartender's attention  If don't want traffic hotel don't locate next hotel    <EOR> I am huge fan Brit Irish Spaniard pubs awesome beers andepic soccer games  just perfect each other just Tom Waitts drinking habits awesome music megatron optimus strippers  you know usual    This Place felt more hipster wanna brit place  fabricated idea satisfy tourists others cant german spot right across don't want inside hard rock hotel because its packed expensive  Don't wrong  looks great but just missing enough TV's most them American sports  including nascar   like  uhhh   yeah  thats right lol Place busy enough but lots spots seat  kinda big   The food OK   only remarkable thing French fries  Super crispy very well cooked inside but other everything just OK  burger meat good A little dry side but bad    give ok because French fries came saved day again I ordered pound wings  which sounds lot right?
