Things even better when added broasted chicken  all restaurants native Upper Michigan serve it   Way Stacey keep up  <EOR> I'm always excited try new places especially those close home  headed elsewhere but popped into Streets when noticed open  space nicely decorated offers warm welcoming atmosphere large dining room bar few taps  sign suggested seating yourself grabbed table center dining room   We sat little long before someone came over  drink order taken but weren't certain wanted menu would nice  He realized brought two over  questions slices he couldn't answer  He walked off thought he going ask but ended another task  waitress came over  Fortunately she able help  Slices pre baked cheese pizza add whatever toppings like    She further explained they've open two weeks location original location north  mentioned first visit we'd know what's best order  She suggested slices chicken parm eggplant rollatini couple subs  two slices sausage pepperoni  husband chose eggplant penne   Breadsticks brought over marinara sauce  sauce more paste which don't care but husband didn't mind it  breadsticks ok  Rosati's does theirs warmer crisper more chewy  similar compare them    While waited noticed restaurant lot bodies few customers us another table waits longer expected  never seen many people moving but doing absolutely nothing  waitress other checked periodically service wasn't bad just par   Finally food served  pizza didn't look particularly appetizing but dug in  sausage terrible  took two bites confirm  tasted frozen pizza  husband wouldn't even eat he eats most everything  He thought tasted microwavable pizza  pepperoni bit better when loaded chili flake  cooked more evenly  too    The pasta eggplant rollatini bit better but eggplant wasn't heated all way through  still cold center  waited way long paid much seemed microwaved eats  bill $23 usually I'd consider pretty affordable but case?  much   They lot work do  several solid pizza joints nearby seriously step game even begin compete  <EOR> I'm NY they're nothing NY place   ordered chicken pram tomato sauce over cubed chicken lol   what?  really feel bad leaving 3 stars but no way add another 3rd star server she saved day one <EOR> I come once week really good   Try baked minestrone soup! service some time slow but worth wait   also really good baked chicken  <EOR> Do pizza!! pizza arrived late delivery 40 minutes cold cardboard   hardly any sauce tasteless crust  YUCK! Definitely NYC pizza    <EOR> Food good but crust little more done  bread type dough you'll want eat soon home while still hot otherwise kinda tough chewy  came Sunday night waited 40 minutes 16 inch chicken garlic pizza 2 pieces dark meat broaster's chicken as might guessed chicken P   other lady waited almost long  She came back ask opinion cheese pizza told yes overdone wouldn't eat it  good giving refund but can't give back time loss  think might given some broasted chicken because she didn't stick around long after  excuse overwhelmed but thought myself self don't time oven? If don't might want hire more people tend oven better also think cheese pizza being cooked long vs chicken pizza cooked enough because more stuff needs more time something less plain chesse  <EOR> Our server excellent always checked sure drinks filled check food even though she only server while waiting 5 other tables  5 stars her!   On food wasnt great  ordered create your own pasta fetta Alfredo  flavorless  girlfriend ordered chicken parm pasta which wasn't bad  chicken tasted alright marinara sauce penne good  mother ordered 10 inch pizza pretty average  Nothing extravagant  most likely won't returning  <EOR> If you're looking authentic New York style pizza it   However having said food quite decent service really friendly   regular New York style pizza cheese ravioli gf pizza beer cheese dip garlic bread   Everything tasty came piping hot   want come back try fried chicken back   solid neighborhood place good food clean establishment friendly service  <EOR> We love place lot since live just minutes away servers very friendly love food desserts there's nothing haven't liked yet    I didn't give them full 5 stars because sometimes there's enough servers working busy times noticed only server all tables  <EOR> The broaster chicken very good    thin crust new york combo pizza awesome too    Vegas but glad stopped accident cuz food service GREAT    <EOR> This place new   nice inside person served us   pizza great!  breadsticks came first unfortunately cold but marina sauce good   came pizza breadsticks problem   only real problem price   pretty expensive   used $4 coupon LiveDeal 16 inch pizza still $18 just pizza alone including tip   love pizza if love pizza place regardless price being high not  <EOR> If hadn't tried pizza place would gotten 5 stars     Don't wrong pizza isn't bad however other food INCREDIBLE!!!

Visiting California ate last day uuuuuumaaaaaaaazing!! Hands down best food awhile   and don't review often but place worth taking time write review !! <EOR> This place super cool name nice pizza parlor vibe  service also great  However pizza worth price calories  very flavorful does remind New York pizza  ordered spinach artichoke dip pesto mozzarella crostini pizza  spinach artichoke usual  actual whole pieces artichoke which would great except artichoke drenched oil completely flavorless  No bueno  server immediately something different when she realized weren't digging spinach dip  She recommended pesto mozzarella crostini  very good  Really cheesy fresh  Saved server!   On pizza    the reason all here  ordered half BBQ chicken pizza half mediterranean  Both sides mediocre best  pizza hot ingredients fresh but no flavor lot grease  would recommend place overall pizza  <EOR> Food delicious service friendly great little pizza place  happily return next time town visiting!   Really recommend cheesy passion bread white pizza! <EOR> Pizza tastes looks just Little Caesars except $17 more   kept giving place chance because wife loves pasta but everything tastes garbage   ordered philly roast beef meatball subs which subpar  figured I'd try pizza all should New York style could screw up? Well did now officially done  <EOR> Came whim without reading reviews  pretty dead Sunday @ 5pm  server nice but service pretty slow  fried appetizers pizzas subs  fries 16 2 topping pizza  read some reviews complimentary garlic knots but definitely did not  fries good    pizza OK crust tasteless reminded frozen pizza  ended paying near $40 worth price sure  <EOR> As seasoned cook few pizza parlors say place gots goods  Although wonder why hide behind New York subtitle because better any pie back east   But all cheese pie  Mainly because marriage between pizza sauce mozzarella heavenly combination  then when jump onto  pizza crust devil jealous hotness   I notice some subtleties dough up  miss New York ish thinness rolling pin  totally tell they're handling completely hand tossing it  tell because flaky crispness reminiscent Sicilian pies  looks thicker but airy no way travesty Chicago pies end being   Either way whoever ends making pie sauce delicious cheese delicious only slices where crust disappears too  <EOR> Ugh AMAZING!!!
