Great place bite near gate d17  Fast  cold  Cal pizza kitchen took 30 min before attempted take order  fast friendly fresh  Maybe best kept secret terminal 1 d gates  <EOR> My first puck experience other pizza  lame disappointment    I'm writing half hour arriving  cannot attention waitress drink    The cook does know what's food diet issue     Just mess  Pretty much low end chain sure why he's popular  <EOR> I am rarely complain especially airport food but Italian Bistro sandwich possibly worst sandwiches ever had  If soggy thickly cut white bread masked name sough dough doesn't turn off herbed mayo slapped onto outside definitely earn few crumpled napkins  If dare continue ignore mediocre cold cuts inside just eat side chips  worth it  <EOR>
