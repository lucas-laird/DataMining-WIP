INSTANT SERVICE  so friendly  food spot Dennys  I usually local restaurants eat   I atmosphere there   but waiters spot on   not just look service give everyone else   clap clap clap!!! Keep going guys   if ever around back <EOR> I show 3am just off work wait given menu no shows up  grab menu myself place order  I'm ordering food server rushing me  part am going order smoothie server said won't smoothie because food piling lot people need things   asked repeat he said because thinking maybe he can't smoothie  But he repeated won't smoothie   To become upset because he could lied said hey know machine down whatever would fine  But fact he said he won't just pissed off  That's ridiculous  I don't blame personally because restaurant should better staffed handle all customers no matter time  person doing everything because difficult  But blame attitude rude way telling he won't  I walk restaurant prevent myself yelling telling he won't smoothie  I'm going pay smoothie he wants tell he won't? That's dumb  So name tag said Michael but name receipt Nathan B  It's white male early 20s  He's always time  He's always making sure black suit jacket nice clean instead checking customers  He wears black vest he works high class restaurant  I always issue service because come often late night but wasn't until today it   He also didn't put Tatar sauce bag   So kid needs back lesson manners  <EOR> Service wt Dennys restaurants keep getting worse worse  seated promptly drinks waitress didappeared 15 mins  took 45 mins food  <EOR> Sometimes Yelp review isn't just food  Dining restaurant sometimes means more just good meal but tradition more meaningful could express   My family spending Sunday breakfast years  Each time request sit Christina's section  She remembers everyone's usual order right down Uncle's skillet without mushrooms  When come home visit family she even remembers usual Moons order! She's prompt friendly always greets smile even hugs grandma  She doesn't seem mind lingering while eat visit each other though try free tables asap    I can't express much Christina means just family but me  Since no longer live Vegas nice know she brings comfort loved ones  Sunday breakfast wouldn't same without her    If stop ask section  There's no doubt you'll taken care of  Really though everyone really great  Thank Christina! really appreciate your hard work your kind heart  You're lovely woman inside out! <EOR> Denny's Denny's but sometimes service ruins experience  Shortage help location meal bummer  Hard coffee refills even work getting check pay bill  avoid future <EOR> I could take leave place  Denny's Ohio know expect  Denny's seemed lower quality others  usually Moons over Hammy because grilled cheese kinda person name funny  version dry meager cheese overheated egg square tasteless    My partner ordered scrambled eggs cheese chicken sausage pancakes  She tried twice more eggs right but obviously couldn't real scrambled eggs  only dry squares!  server pleasant but all service tad slow  <EOR> The food horrible  ordered Red White Blue Slam side bacon  blueberry pancakes tasted reheated microwave dry bacon burnt refried full grease plastic cup water brown stuff stuck bottom  first last time here  <EOR> 1 star Just food tasting Good friendliness    Other service SLOW!   food asked condiments took 10 minutes delivered table    drinks we're never refilled asked twice    Im typing Im sitting dry mouth    Asked to go boxes food those but bag carry them still waiting drinks   They're even busy only 6 7 tables wait on there's 2 waiters Plus manager floating around   saw other waiting service all tables least 5 times each brought drink refills before finished current drinks   Oh Just bill yet no bag drinks    Never coming back location again    Service must HORRIBLY SLOW when they're busy  <EOR> Denny's always favorite diner run whenever want eat breakfast dinner  milkshakes fantabulous! Creamy delicious  Just way expect them be! also variety items menu if feel eating cheeseburger breakfast? right ahead! no rules here!   The only reason why didn't give them five stars because service  never consistent  remember took forever just give menu  I'd say waiting 10 15 minutes just someone's attention server give menu  Finally along came Mimi! She favorite waitress here  because share same name but because she's super sweet very accommodating  She turned rocky beginning into very happy ending!  Would come back even though service kind poor side? Yes!
