I've eating     6 7 years already  Almost since they've opened never disappointed  don't come often any more because food worse only because cook home most time days but if no mood cook Taqueria always casual dine out list   As menu tacos great con lengua favorite ones also fish tacos sometimes  Burritos good shrimp they put quite bit shrimp them   Actually think you'll safe ordering anything off menu you'll guaranteed walk away full   Mmm    already hungry <EOR> a hidden gem target shopping center  total home style feel  many things excellent al pastor carne asada  whole rico menudo thing weekend but don't eat bowls soup tripe call lame  <EOR> Went based yelp review  disappointed  chicken enchillada beef taco  Under $10 very good very filling   definitely going back <EOR> Just your typical little hole wall Mom Pop restaurant excellent Mexican Food     Wasn't sure would good opted try three different types Meat tacos     Beef Pork not BBQ kind Pollo   YUM! Let just say this  pieces meat small filled entire soft corn tortilla shells perfectly   little dinky corn tortillas you'd find LA medium sized ones if you're would probably enough 3 would plenty big hungry boy   I   took bite each kind without seasoning them added lime tomato salsa avocado later    far hands down Beef favorite meat  most flavor three cooked perfectly   pork came second chicken third least flavor    Beef definitely won landslide seasoning only helped even more     The home made chips little thick if catch yourself eating them while you're waiting your meal may room when gets there     The Horchata PERFECT! Some places cinnamon rice drink entirely sweet   guy must love stuff because best ever tasted lot Horchata!  The rice beans nothing write home unfortunately  high hopes them friend bragged much he loved Mexican restaurant   beans little dry certainly refried  rice fine but beans just didn't help it   Would loved little more moisture little more flavor here   But overall everything great!    The prices VERY reasonable even if choose something you're huge fan won't feel you're wasting ton money     NYC's over priced horrible Mexican food just appreciate place even more   Kudos Taqueria originally Santa Cruz bringing business locals Vegas   Date Rating 1 Pick Scale 1  Strong Suggestions Just order Take grab quick bite when you're running errand   place formal dinner party but enjoy food  <EOR> the service fast friendly place plenty seating 2 flat screen tv's small salsa bar   menu little limited  fully expecting place fried quesidillas tacos stuff since seems trademark taco shops santa cruz ca where visit every summer  tacos same 2 bites tacos everywhere town $0 99 $1 29 but wanted $2 00 meat tender spicy but cilantro dry could smoke salsa bar empty offered no carrots radishes jalapenos just salsas cilantro mix pico de gallo which little dry too  overall food decent but overpriced some enormous burritos people eating looked real good  did provide everyone bag basket tortilla chip but way burned salted  did coca cola glass 16 oz bottle  <EOR> The main reason why attracted Taqueria because when vegan able cater dietary needs which wasn't trendy 6 8 years ago  being Mexican joint surprising knew even meant    The carne asada good anything   along chicken   Located near UNLV eat when jonesing some good Mexican food    And students little things matter   they great salsa give chips every order! <EOR> Being Cali must say although place bad certainly does compare Taqueria's  back Bay Area!  mean don't wrong food authentic Mexican   But influenced decision give crappy review two things   Carne Asada Super Burrito good price good ingredients except small problem   The meat burned!  Nothing biting into Tasty looking Super Burrito only bite into meat ashes!  Mmm yummy   Finally lost appetite half way through burrito coping annoyance meat ashes every bite took              The Second reason girl friend hated it!  She feeling burrito bit!  normally would willing give place more try next time Vegas but gf says never going again!  Sad because brought begin all great reviews yelp    <EOR>
