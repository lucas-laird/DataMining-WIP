If evening ended I'd give 5 stars!  Now onto bad minister Eddie kept trying jokes throughout ceremony  really weird quite frankly took away poignancy moment  When friend walked down aisle he wanted sing karaoke a capella style dun dun da dun eg wedding march music but no music  Then he shouting podium bride slow down she walked  Bizarre  though he aspiring comedian officiating weddings stand routine  real issue however stemmed fact bride groom brought own reverend the groom's mother reverend ordained officiate weddings states California Nevada   ceremony bride groom walked back down aisle married couple I'm having full on emo moment crocodile tears everything!!   Eddie follows them down aisle said Let's just way stuck hand demanded $75 minister fee!!! most obnoxious gesture ever  some muffled arguing because again brought own reverend already gone city hall earlier morning wedding license services used  wasn't until 5 minutes later when groom said loudly hardly time place conversation Eddie took wedding license stormed off! rest stood watching incredulously    Long story short couple filed complaint city hall next day license re issued but aggravation completely unwarranted    If hadn't Eddie I'd give 5 stars  However he absolutely appalling  antics made mockery ceremony worthy 1 star but want fair overall  view pretty amazing and wedding photographer really nice! split difference give 3 star review  <EOR> We married last week pleased whole experience   They very accommodating requests price reasonable getting  staff genuine wanting pain free happy experience possible   The views amazing minister hoot  Really funny guy which exactly wanted  decor chapel kind traditional  seemed little dated me  Vegas anything but traditional would liked something more pizzazz  previously vetoed alien Elvis drive thru wedding   The champagne package pretty awful though  Tasted $5 bottle   I would recommend strong contender those looking wedding packages  <EOR> Run  Run fast can  must read review before married Las Vegas!I wish zero star review maybe even high property   married Stratosphere Nov 2017 ashamed could save other couples guests frustration indecent treatment Stratosphere staff since then  hope comes wake call property realize opportunity change  Realize hard write supposed most beautiful moment your life  wife refuses speak sit down today heavy heart must report it    We contacted Daun early 2017 plan wedding  She wedding coordinator alleged   52 year old executive could tell right away she interested  wedding turned out  fault automatically disqualifying  property based instinctive bad feeling when being taken advantage of  months things no better until finally decided fly Vegas set own wedding  already paid deposits going great!

The day wedding Daun never even introduced herself she came office took elevator turned around left      Upstairs chapel area found butler Mario  Another nightmare     He very rude arrogant  caught more once rolling eyes ceremony when all guests standing waiting take few photos happy couple he came running through screaming Excuse ripping white paper carpet off down isle Very unprofessional   Now positive parts chapel beautiful  guests enjoyed view minister Carlos V  very nice  photographer Anthony did great job too  The highlight Crafted Buffet  booked semi private room turned private we almost 50 guests   guests enjoyed great variety tasty food The set very nice white table cloth flowers every table There 3 waiters constantly removed finished plates refilled drinks The buffet manager Larry top things came numerous times  <EOR>
