While yes quantity vs quality buffet isn't? nice trick do  pizzas small devoured quickly then there's fresh pie its place ready buffet line! think every time back buffet line always something fresh new  rotate pizzas quite often try lots different types   Salads pretty generic  come already assembled dressing included  wish would put dressing side because sometimes much dressing overkill  I really enjoyed white pie chicken  chicken alfredo but pizza crust! Hawaiian hit spot Mexican wasn't shabby either  pizza thought really disgusting which tabasco one  fan tabasco though probably didn't help much either  The garlic sticks thin but flavorful made great paring soup pasta marinara sauce also available   Save room desserts! cinnamon rolls *TO DIE FOR* especially when fresh oven  boyfriend foodgasm over them because just soft melted your mouth  DELICIOUS!! brownies pretty good well   Bring your extra stomachs buffet brings food coma galore! passed 2 3 hours heading back hotel  <EOR> I've once twice before remembered they're super friendly today no different  They're all smiles happy serve even manager walks around helps pizzas behind line  But say star employee Wiley  He friendly helps dirty dishes off table always smiling  He really great person  10 stars 5 place ran perfect! <EOR> Owner Mike staff friendly accommodating group Volleyball Players parents  Thank Cici's wonderful inexpensive evening great food! loved all options salad bar great! <EOR> Only star dessert   worst excuse pizza buffet ever misfortune encountering!  salad bar messy understocked    pasta bar sat empty over 30 minutes bus boy passed table more once but left all dirty plates sitting   only slightly redeeming part dessert   Save your money  Worse yet when date shared concerns manager he just blown off concerns didn't matter! going again!! <EOR> Everytime walk place atleast five people greet welcome  Cant variety  always walk satisfied  <EOR> Caring owner employees   employee even pulls chairs offer seat   Great price environment   Thumbs pizza salad dessert  <EOR> It's $5 pizza lunch buffet  expecting spectacular pizza  edible fact custom pizza now  great!!

School cafeteria food course  If good school then means okay compared other places   As soon walk into restaurant cash register pay before eat  Which fine me     The buffet starts off salad  although really wanted salad particular day salad may day before because looking wilted   The chicken noodle soup thought really good  least know where cold days when experiencing sore throat   Of all pizzas only tried four  pepperoni spinach thought ok  However think really good job chicken alfredo chicken honey bbq   For dessert fudge brownie cinnamon bites available which thought ok  fudge brownie rich cinnamon bites weren't overly sweet   While only saw two employees working restaurant area cashier person busing tables  Unfortunately busing tables wasn't around very often while none plates picked up  Because still early 11 30 am restaurant nice clean   I thought interesting see little arcade area back restaurant  its nice larger families treating kids family night where smallest pickiest eaters satisfied kids play making easier parents put kids bed  Even plan bring family all keikis reasonably priced Vegas lunch dinner  <EOR> Wow place awesome!!! service excellent!!!

Great place take co workers family friends   You never leave empty stomach   OMG Calories guess workout after   LOL <EOR> The ONLY reason place getting any stars because employees AWESOME  would give 5 stars staff alone  owner however very unprofessional rude  Honestly pay little more somewhere els better quality food service  <EOR> If you're going eat order your own personal pizza    The staff friendly although little surprised cashier such hard time taking gift card then subtracting total receive cash remainder bill  spent 5 minutes front having try figure out  Eventually she threw hands air assuming assistant manager came around helped out    We came because read $5 99 lunch buffet Which assumed included drink did include drink drink itself cost $2  Why don't just charge everything once instead being all sneaky your costs? Made trust them    The salad good wasn't impressed see dressing squirt bottles though  Depending which slice picked pizza could really good really bad  friend same kind pizza tasted horrible while mine tasted freshly made  happened every pizza tried until them just own pizza  only explanation think just keep old slices warming plates add fresh pizza when need it  super gross    The dessert pizza pretty good but ran into same thing  Some desserts fresher others  mini cinnamon roll delicious moist warm while next hard rock dry disgusting    I hope fixed  don't think come back unless do  would need them fix prices too include drink $5 99 price charge more buffet include drink but don't choose whether going drink meal right when there  really sketchy rude    The atmosphere horrible  least someone mid twenties  sat across TV Dora Explorer music playing Disney Channel  guess they're catering kids?   It wasn't very clean floors tables could definitely use renovation  bathroom doors greasy fingerprints all over them top bottom     The only plus say place service friendly  Even seemed back high school much joked around even customers  don't need someone voice impressions redneck when picking pizza  If wanted back High School would  don't think coming back though  <EOR> Less fifty dollars family seven drinks  super deal  family California therefore Cici's nearby   So anytime come Vegas come Cici's! salad bar packed fresh veggies  pizza options super yummy delish! enjoy variety all foods   My favorite pepperoni stuffed crust  Filled abundance cheese  Yummmmmm! <EOR> This fun place family kids  small arcade lots kids food pizza pasta bread sticks brownies salads buffet style just chilled laid back place take kids  gave 4 stars only because noticed hard time keeping buffet area cleaned up  sure if slacking night but dressing food spilled all over counter area no seemed cleaning up  course huge flow people eating but opinion area should cleaned often possible  cool see messy area where food is  Just sayin! <EOR> I don't see hype about  family see tons commercials CiCi's Pizza California but when look nearest Nevada first location pops up    That weekend happened Las Vegas decided check out    Food If didn't know CiCi's all eat pizza buffet  pizza selections basic  Your classic pepperoni cheese combo then specialty pizza  Mac cheese pizza sausage pineapple only forth  BUT only 7 different pizzas time  soups which good  basic salad bar sweets such cinnamon pizza good Woodstock's brownie pizza also great   Ambiance feels your normal pizza joint  comparison Round Table Mountain Mike's  small arcade location nothing crazy   Service why gave place 3 stars instead just 1  cashier nice woman she deal large birthday party all customers coming out  cleaner African American he phenomenal  wish name because he deserves most credit  Always making sure tables cleaning collecting dishes made day  He would always ask your meal?

Seriously little bit everything here  Regardless your tastes you're bound find item works you    The place priced right too  buffet overly expensive any means making ideal place cheap good lunch if area mood  only wish would put location old Henderson area closest restaurant still pretty lengthy commute   If complaint place overcrowding  place gets JAMMED peak hours even finding table struggle  doesn't help things only drink machine all food laid long row  hard around without bumping into someone which both annoying safety hazard   But overlook flaws  place excellent no problem making commute pizza buffet needs  place gets strong recommendation  <EOR> Gourmet food not! only come because single mom son likes place because small arcade   NO pepperoni pizza!! Pepperoni!! most popular pizza is!!  didn't even oven special request it!  decide while waiting pepperoni also wait bread sticks oven  manager comes over take empty bread stick tray proceeds grab tongs wrong end! He puts new tray bread sticks puts same tongs out  use spatula pizza nearby  He tells use tongs  say No thanks just saw touch wrong end your bare hands! glad all shots! Built immunity come!! <EOR> My family used lot! Then changed managers few times each time service worse  Finally started just using take only but omg even worse! Every time called order pizza never done even though always gave them extra 10 minutes over time told would ready  night three 5 items ready girl just left them counter while breadsticks dessert cooked another 10 minutes! Then terrible night waiting forever pick counter girl dropped pizzas floor upside down seriously asked wanted it!!!!
