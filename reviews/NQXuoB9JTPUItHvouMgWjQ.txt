All Organic all Vegan Breakfast  Ronald's Donuts finish off! staff point great Vibe Saturday Morning! <EOR> Food great  Well nachos good but salad really  Burger husband good  Nothing wow  But its place meal  waited 20 30 min! Kids mac cheese took 30 min!!! Waitress said dessert house because long wait kids meals  But guess she forgot dessert cause never it  <EOR> French fries horrible nachos disgusting   But dont mind priciing your going recieve something special   once   then again more time sure mistaken   but both times food sucked   vegan expect decent nachos whatever ordered i dont even remember remember sucked   its just plain sucked   pretty sad because expecting decent food all good 'reviews' people raving it   service iffy to   really felt weird welcome   feel am comparing them veggiegrill california   but really shouldnt should lower expectations   vegas all   but expected more vegan restaurant   <EOR> Had chance try place say service excellent along food  Checked yelp free bowl chili which huge hearty delicious! meal itself    THe blueberry hibiscus tea refreshing fact wasn't sweetened  No artificial sweeteners agave  Excellent!  I ordered Texas BBQ sandwich juicy hearty  helpings very generous  fries pretty good    My friend teriyaki bowl seitan say even better meal! Very generous portion also  ended taking half lunches home    Lastly ordered carrot cake home course awesome  looking forward coconut lemon cake but all out  Next time call ahead ask them save piece hear best    I sat myself within couple minutes greeted tea  waitress blonde dreads sweet attentive  She explained many different products gave some recommendations some dishes menu  restaurant steady customer base entire time witnessed service great across board  definite recommendation returning customer  welcomed all dishes explained us  <EOR> If giving place more then star lack taste buds friends owner!!!! Food full oil greasy over cooked until burned!!  And am Not talking cheap greasy way over pricey!! <EOR> Let start saying am vegan but opening restaurant intrigued me  few times since opened biggest flaws only seem new restaurant need time things perfect    I took daughter both times despite saying she really doesn't want Vegan food   She's young understand Vegan think healthy least understand different dietary preferences strongly exist modern culture today    The first time ordered Hippie Chick burger  little shocked small BUT full ate actually glad wasn't bigger   ordered mashed potatoes which wasn't sure would love but pleasantly impressed by!  gravy perfectly seasoned mash creamy  also ordered Beet juice  delicious!  daughter ordered pineapple mint juice but mint day server recommended another mixture pineapple orange little bit ginger   She LOVED drank all  entree she ordered kids burrito No Meato Bandito which way big she said very very boring  She packed but she didn't finish home either    The next time stopped brought boyfriend wasn't really hungry but really wanted smoothie fresh juice  He ordered 2 smoothies try Amazon Rocket Fuel Green Lava   loved both them   Haven't found disappointing drink selection menu yet  Hi five!    For entree teriyaki tofu bowl Love Bowl which didn't taste anything teriyaki me   still good but great   don't think order dish again   daughter ordered Spaghetti Meatballs which she said good but she hardly made dent   kids portion sizes really big   She took home but again didn't finish it   prefer kids portions just enough   hard them eat leftovers when rest family doesn't left overs well   I stopped 3rd try tonight  dining solo walked door stood minute before any staff noticed me  girl behind counter said hi    signaled dining alone party 1   She nodded but left standing while rest restaurant stared me  Awkward!  She disappeared back minute thought she possibly going find another staff member help front but instead came 2 plates which she delivered table standing next still waiting seated   She dropped food off them asked if needed anything else then walked back again  those 5 awkward minutes left  If half full restaurant means won't even seated don't think waited any urgency   guess back again another time  now overall rating 3 5 heavy weighing tonight's experience even being seated  <EOR> This become favorite breakfast place  love feeling confidence everything order Vegan without asking  food delicious norm every time am Las Vegas  Love love love place <EOR> never again  rude order took 45 min burnt food redo 30 more minutes wait  tried apologize donuts   vegan cafe  stomach ache because bad vibes just very unpleasant experience  <EOR> I love place eat everyday perfect food perfect everything invite all friends leave birthday party healthy good live hundred years if eat way everyday <EOR> I really wanted love place  justify myself giving 3 stars since most part food good The bean corn salad side very good   appreciate hand gluten free wrap teriyaki wrap but little soggy sauce wrap use knife fork eat wrap  Plus think tortilla could cooked bit more since quite thick very doughy center may because still early when ordered 11 20 lunch menu doesn't start until 11 30  forewarned wrap might take little extra time served 11 40  did expect waffle ordered 11 20 would served until finished wrap  shared wrap wouldn't eat front wait cold waiting waffle served  Great idea since breakfast waffle served until 11 55!!! gad he ordered waffle savory breakfast dish could treat dessert But rechecked menu yes supposed coconut cream server register ask cream  Oh wasn't there? Maybe didn't put on  But check Okay answer did impress but worse she continued look confused register 5 minutes then served another table food took another table's order gave 3rd table that come us served before us check then change back confused look register then heading over clear table she gave check change when she must overheard guy's comment 10 minutes requesting cream decided into kitchen some  course time only few bites waffle left syrup already completely soaked no clue waffle would taste hot fresh all fixings   SO 3 stars attempt good food par because really poor service  may try place again if still open few months when chance service issues fixed  Sad because looking forward liking restaurant good reviews all vegan but don't always hour quick bite  know isn't fast food but if two people order food please don't serve plates 20 minutes apart  <EOR> Cheat food day while healthy diet  Always allow yourself some vegan junk food   Service Sabrina super point she kind knowledgeable!

Excellent service fast preparation  Would definitely come back son even said favorite restaurant now  <EOR> Over priced OK food didn't swipe me off my feet ate better vegan Vegas but stuff nice place looks good  why give 4 stars 3  Ps did don't accept americana express  <EOR> I gone restaurant lot last year honestly only become better hence five star review  love most items tasted ordered help improving customer service often  owner nice humble famous world class poker player she recently hired very professional manager   I love concept wish more restaurants would vegan organic gluten free options  continue eat hit if want throw meetup here  met several cool people place easy talk positive  started going 2016 fall last August 2017  <EOR> I always love going here  food incredible just 4 minutes home  staff owner super sweet accommodating love Yorkie always welcome too  Oh did say amazingly delicious food? YUM! <EOR> This restaurant true oasis flavor desert bland food  ambiance decor staff course food amazing  highly recommend all plant based brethren  <EOR> Tried new restaurant second time  food very mediocre overpriced   think concept good just execution terrible   Don't feel return many options Las Vegas  <EOR> The food really delicious but service subpar     particular waitress could focus job  ask multiple times silverware coffee sugar hot sauce     looked other staff good just waitress  <EOR> This perfect place if you're already vegan thinking going vegan going non vegans  menu really diverse but still traditional vegan items burgers salads  sandwiches  place itself really colorful lot fun art look at  Even restrooms cute  sure save room cake! <EOR> Ive Violettes Vegan more times could remember  food incredible atmosphere comforting great location sweet boba spot next door Madhouse Cafe treat afterwards  thing could improve wait time  Sometimes Ill find myself waiting well over 30 minutes meal but its worth food great everything house made order  Some personal favorites include Beef Broccoli El Toro Grande Burrito Shinto Steak Sandwich Country Classic Red Rock Nachos Breakfast Wrap Supreme tip tell them put cheese it!   Above all Violettes Vegan incredible spot vegans good meal walk door satisfied especially Summerlin West LV where its hard find good vegan eats  Also dont scoff dessert options  Theyre all freaking incredible  <EOR> The past few times location received very good service  ambiance inviting prices reasonable but food A+  Red rock nachos tasty yet portions way off last time went  price nachos hoping adjusted those portions  Red rockin' chili very good could possibly pass meat dish! Worth it  Sunrise superman should listed menu bacon substitute  doesn't taste bacon  matter fact did any notably tasty flavors all  Pass  Positively pad Thai sweet also thick grainy texture  Pass   Although couple dishes didn't love returning try other dishes menu! <EOR> Brief Overview great organic Non GMO restaurant combines foods you've known loved growing just vegan version   Pros regular baked cheese cake good savor every bite I can't even tell vegan waffles pancakes absolutely delicious I leave feeling happy food top notch owner Cindy such kind giving woman love death  let teach essential oil classes every Saturday location definitely into health wellness!  Cons noise level little loud blender smoothie going times hard hear conversations Some food items could use little more flavor hummus but still tasty Final Verdict must visit location if local if visiting Las Vegas  favorite restaurants Las Vegas there's reason why every week it's awesome! <EOR> This place gets worse every time go  thought would great vegan place close house but place  food typically takes 30 45 minutes regardless amount customers cold bland when arrives  you'd think if takes long would least hot       But anyways    really disappointing because someone first experience vegan food going bad experience  Which bad because there's much amazing vegan food there!!  Do yourself favor try literally any other vegan restaurant Vegas  <EOR> Extremely thoughtful restaurant extensive menu  Came Friday night even really nice live music  Owner attentive kind  am vegan but date equally satisfied  eggplant parmigiana which good portion pasta al dente broccoli overcooked which very hard find  definitely come again when back area! <EOR> Incredible food great atmosphere totally enjoyable experience! BLT yummy yummy yummy!!! <EOR> This place pretty good  few salad options which healthy   We came breakfast recently garden scrambled tofu no oil salt  super good way   You say no oil salt opinion way oily salty   way terrific!!! <EOR> Great plant base food!!

Add attentive servers choice vegan desserts you've all need perfect night <EOR> The food good just prepared wait long time it  eaten actual restaurant 3x ordered grub hub 1x ordered advance pickup 1x  ALWAYS wait least 45 minutes hour food ready  meantime no water nobody checks updates order just wait  love soups chili Violette club sandwich  waiters kids while she works  super cute but noticed she constantly made sure drinks refilled appetizers which isn't problem BUT she seemed more focused them customers  waited HOUR could least offered drink! Maybe just gotta know somebody good service     Update several times both takeout dine in since last review service awesome!! Food amazing always breakfast menu looks really good can't wait try it  <EOR> Finally violets someone charge knows run restaurant! Everything delicious <EOR> We've Violette's 3 times now each Sunday morning breakfast review strictly based specific day course   Firstly thank much opening vegan restaurant Las Vegas amazing see many options starting open town   But based experiences don't know back again  start strictly personal style opinion restaurant decor straight 90's   earthy peace loving theme kind hippie meets vegan feel  doesn't feel modern all feels old tired cafe   Secondly far breakfast food just ok  I'd see them use many processed meat cheese substitutes Fieldroast sausage Daiya could food home better  would also see better side some breakfast options other steamed kale  kale but plain steamed kale isn't very appetizing tasty morning also creative all   Third most important every time visited something  muffins mint pineapple tofu   Yes tofu! ran tofu scramble today! Which really odd since Vons plaza!  Lastly service mediocre  Servers friendly but unknowing items currently available again always seems something stock here  preparation time takes your food order quite long  only person kitchen still trying figure things out?  Again happy west side vegan restaurant but based service creativity both decor food most likely drive downtown Sunday morning brunch now on  <EOR> Yummy! First time trying vegan food wings California burger  wings delicious made consider going vegan! Lol  burger good but fries weren't all impressive wish would've crunchier  Overall place great definitely back <EOR> This place seriously cute   outside decorated Christmas lights   very cozy inside   Service good  ordered tomato bisque soup burrito entree   honest when say burrito wasn't amazing  totally understand vegan food little different regular   But vegan restaurant specializes sort thing expected food little better   Way much rice smothered burrito   But restaurant itself super cute  <EOR> Update earlier review since changed El Toro Grande Burrito entree   meal traditionally includes fairly sized burrito corn chips grilled veggies guacamole salsa    whopping price $15!  Now cut veggies substituted them lettuce   Literally pieces lettuce  addition removed guacamole salsa  But funny thing didn't lower price all   menu didn't display any changes   think instituted changes save money inventory but poor choice     P S  cauliflower bites larger add more!  Veggie Grill California gives huge cauliflower bites dollar less!  love your food but sometimes portions small price   Much love <EOR> I've Violet's Vegan two times last 10 days!! first time ate amazing restaurant mother morning workout  ordered off breakfast menu  ordered chocolate chips pancakes side tofu scramble potatoes sausage patty  All delicious  only thing wasn't huge fan sausage patty but everything else yummy tummy  The second time back brought best friend along  arrived during lunch hours ordered vegan eggplant parmesan spaghetti which included side broccoli  mouth watering  could eat again again    If live Las Vegas visiting definitely recommend stop grab bite  don't vegan enjoy fantastic food Violet's Vegan  hard believe all delicious food vegan  <EOR> I've place bookmarks long time  live far decided take drive wife try place out  called ahead see long would Yelp reviews say wait may long  lady phone said 20 minutes  When place full but everyone done eating  sit bar area nobody acknowledges us  grab menus own since next us  15 minutes before someone gets drinks  Then once drinks another 20 minutes until flag down man tell ready 20 minutes  place order man tells homemade veggie patties but sub soy patty  Sure  Then he comes back tells wife beef broccoli she ordered  She then chooses sandwich  Then he comes back tells don't ha e soy patty sandwich! point frustrated place don't want order another item  tell them forget don't want eat anymore pay drinks  guy said him! Thank god because wife's  smoothie warm!!!! Ugh excited eat here  horrible experience never back no matter good food may taste!!!! <EOR> For everything being vegan wonderful taste disappointed  live close place never visited  really should though      The red rock nachos something should try There's reason why many photos it  <EOR> Their red rock nachos good! Also love spaghetti scampi chili quesadillas yummy  All non vegan friends love place well  vegetarian place favs  <EOR> My third time eating thought time review  place cute decoration just overall peaceful atmosphere   Service decent  backhouse kitchen which explain bit front house  times servers helpful recommendations  But tonight tried order smoothie pick given excuse staff normally drinks called off she didn't know any juices smoothies   thought quite interesting  Being server food handler myself would think management would want know everything menu made  But anyways   I've ordered same things over over cheese cauliflower tofu buffalo sticks violettes purple power green lava coconut lemon cake  All very tasty actually quite good  impressed smoothie cake sure   But tonight when buffalo tofu sticks literally thrown into box  No presentation last time ordered celery sticks foil underneath help buffalo sauce   cheese baked cauliflower tonight also extremely disappointing!!! Seriously don't even think baked cooked  definitely did look nor taste way did when ordered first time     CONSISTENCY quality food service definitely help better place  Your workers front back house need care that    Anyways restaurant definitely constant tos but guess option   From looks comments your customers hope see more improvements   Thank you! <EOR> Amazing food good prices vegan food  Anytime side town only place dine  Vegan food good portion diet Vegas hard come by  Lets keep local business business! <EOR> Went birthday together really blown away! beef broccoli which great texture flavor cooked lovely creamy garlic sauce  wife burrito entres portion menu she really enjoyed well   Super great vibe beautiful art walls great service! <EOR> This first time Violette's look forward returning many more times   atmosphere charming upbeat comfortable staff   food enjoyed delicious  all organic non gmo   Thai salad amazing tofu light peanut dressing love salad chili cheese fries  all delicious   Highly recommend  <EOR> Great place  whole restaurant filled interesting books crystals all kinds holistic health tool including amazing food! ordered fruit parfait tasted better expecting  server waitress hostess I'm sorry don't know correct term Alma she sweet  All employees seems friendly helpful  When women's restroom especially happy see all fairy decorations complimentary toiletries tampons pads   honestly HUGE deal because 23 years life never seen restaurant cafe  really feel owner cares cafe lot all customers way everything set up  When sit down eat just look around feel much heart into place  Oh also kids section!

California dreamin burger super happy gluten free bun it  recently cut lot diet because illness  meat honestly wouldn't know difference between real vegan  Next time ask no cheese because wow over powering    The ranch didn't really taste good kinda bland   My friends thousand island tasted ketchup  it    The service why rating 3 friend came only 4 other people sitting  Two looked already done  Waitress more bland ranch  felt weird  Also friend said no tomatoes pickles but she still them someone didn't write ticket correct read ticket correct  two blonde waitress also seemed kinda stuck moment walked kinda felt judged no genuine smile greeting    The environment music very relaxing beautiful art work all over    Over all I'd order again but next time take go  <EOR> With family town eat exclusively vegan diet brought them Vdara late lunch early dinner  Nothing disappointed  staff allowed sampling sauces sure flavors matched cravings then brought multiple courses    Each item soup dessert seemed fresh well prepared several items being large finish alone   Highly recommend visit anywhere valley  Neither food nor setting disappoint! <EOR> Great food wide selection great service wonderful atmosphere     really glad came repeat customer sure! Looking forward trying other items menu  <EOR> I very disappointed when came only because both gluten free vegan  visiting Las Vegas convention excited see place options both gluten free vegan  Looking online menu reads though nachos all made gluten free  also picture some killer nachos  decided going first choice restaurants visit based online menu  When restaurant physical menu note nachos could made gluten free but did come way  Turns gluten free nachos did delicious liquidy nacho cheese sauce pictured website  just use Daiya itself gluten free version  Daiya doesn't melt well if wanted nachos Daiya could them home  took $20 uber over restaurant just those nachos because under impression gluten free   So decided second choice forget name but essentially buffalo wings  Turns menu item  point honestly wanted leave but starving  ordered breaded zucchini decided try them ranch  ranch dressing solid cream cheese didn't much taste no idea put onto salad  zucchini sticks themselves really delicious cooked perfectly  If all wanted eaten I'd give five stars  But even tomato dipping sauce bland   I'm mostly disappointed because feel online menu misleading which items always gluten free vs prepared gluten free  If only looked online menu before ordering nachos would thought ordering gluten free would gotten very sick  <EOR> All say needs cleaned wait staff needs better training  love idea organic vegan restaurant  <EOR> Nope   Tastes cheap bar food   Nachos lacking major flavor heat  Just because dish vegan doesn't mean bland    Seriously everything ate could better home more flavor still vegan healthy  expecting more creative items menu but left bloated unsatisfied    Was excited based reviews left disappointed  don't want pay food better home    I'm also comparing Veggie Grill Native Foods much better but don't those Las Vegas  Ugh  <EOR> Had Violettes first time week absolutely delicious! walk definitely feel you're vegan hippie restaurant but don't let scare away! backyard BBQ sandwich philly both super tasty you'd no idea missing meat  personally think things more flavorful when made soy plant based protein  Also wings buffalo sauce instead BBQ great starter! tad greasy but tons flavor! definitely back try everything else menu! nice having reasonably priced delicious vegan restaurant close home! <EOR> Let start saying absolutely love place  vegan 5 years seriously best vegan restaurant around   many great options  However just found they're expensive!  things people complain expensive vegan food place proving it   used every single week  Until realized much setting back! average person appetizer entree regular beverage set back $30 more per person   without tip!  really wanna start coming weekly again please Violet lower prices bit average income earners eat more often!!
