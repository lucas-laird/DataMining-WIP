Highly recommended!! <EOR> Las Vegas changed years since family moved here  Finding cheap steak hard come even harder west side town  Many days when gym all want protein laden meal used yelp app trying find place Steak Eggs  Sure found bunch but good grief sometimes just want spend $12 bucks  Going through several restaurants saw wasn't far figured I'd give shot glad did   I into very diver diner restaurant took booth wall  server very very friendly took order coffee water while looked through menu even though pretty sure wanted  ordered Steak 3 eggs Cottage Cheese some toast  She brought cottage cheese early could start eating  must just lifted heavy stuff 45 minutes might eat hand soon look face but super grateful!   The steak eggs came pretty quickly  say quick $12 steak very pleased  places might apt order steak sauce but really cooked perfect rare darn tasty  eggs cooked perfectly season just right  server prompt kept coffee coming  All all walked happy definitely going back another long gym sessions if just need something work   My only issue place 1 decor HORRIBLE  bad bad bad  just divy but unnecessary fake flowers junk  2 some idiotic women's daytime talk show tv sound turned way up  know staff gets bored but good grief almost asked them turn off  decided nice let them it    The only reason don't give 5 wasn't GREAT but pretty darn good <EOR> Food great  afraid first because place almost empty  Originally heading another place couldn't in  However don't regret it  Food delicious  tried western omelette fresh fruit home fries  Also old fashion french toast  <EOR> Crepes advertised window menu   garlic aolili supposed sandwich but then when wait staff asked 'cook' cup no ranchmelted butter garlic chunks it   onion rings fresh sausage fresh   burger made well but it   waitress kept apologizing  No ranch dressing found  mug cracked stained  Even wait staff look customers  Sorry won't return until Robert Irvine steps into help  <EOR> The Daily Egg great place grab All American breakfast Vegas without dealing mediocre service food large breakfast chains  discovered through Yelp decided give shot despite particularly nasty review  Boy am glad did   My experience The place does jump just several businesses its plaza bit 'hidden gem'  came just half hour before closing time waitress friendly courteous  Food came quickly cooked perfectly order never eggs cooked perfectly over medium style until came here  highlight ham cut thick charred outer edge  MUST try it  rest hash browns pancakes bacon tasted great too  Upon leaving happy customers agreed negative reviews damn near robbed good eating   Pros Service friendly  food tastes good  Portions perfect size slightly large side if anything Very well priced menu considering quality food  best ham ever hands down  Absolutely delicious   Cons Nothing think of   This place must go spots every Vegas trip now on  <EOR> Seriously? gonna mess eggs when name your restaurant Daily Egg?   I ordered breakfast sandwich bacon  expecting nice fluffy egg couple strips bacon slice cheese soft flaky croissant  Instead received burnt omelet flavorless piece cardboard  could barely eat ridiculous excuse sandwich  However good thing order came 2 sides    I figured hash browns better just tried eat  WRONG!  These hash browns just awful! anyone charge quality control orders going out? Someone any sense would known serve burnt  potatoes    At point getting pissed off  But wait still gigantic pancake eat  Ahhhhhh  more it  nice sized fluffy pancake  second only Du par's book  hint lemon zest? dusting powdered sugar? bad wasted  most appetite slop earlier    This meal major disappointment really wanted place  only thing saving place 0 stars heavenly pancakes  Perhaps name change Daily Pancake would more appropriate  <EOR> Food fine   Service terrible   Toast came 10mins omelette   Pancakes but no syrup   Order messed up   Waiter owner nice   Tried discounting food   People nice but just don't know run restaurant   They're way understaffed  <EOR> Ive twice breakfast   Service bit slow weird aren't more customers   $9 pancake size dinner plate side plus large omelete side fruit     High quality homecooking   If patient you'll place  <EOR> Coworker stopped breakfast  While meal satisfying coffee very good also mugs others commented on less impressed rest experience  1 pesky fly kept buzzing around before meal strangely disappeared while food served us??    Probably didn't help only ones place bug   2 Coworker ordered bacon extra crispy    He ate but seen bacon fatty undercooked before   IF ever come back certainly won't ordering bacon here  3 ordered Corned Beef Hash Eggs   menu plainly states Homemade corned beef hash    NOT   Unless made Mr Hormel's home canned    diner regularly back home serves same saying don't but REAL homemade corned beef hash back Texas another cafe really looking forward here   Again bad but big disappointment false advertising   The staff friendly enough food otherwise okay but think we'll checking Denny's tomorrow  <EOR> Dora waitress very hospitable! place immaculate!

So    4 stars based coworkers     2 stars based own food  3 star review is! It's pretty likely order them again some point won't sliders though  <EOR> Wonderful food wonderful service   everything made scratch   the meat pies mediterranean foods best!!!!!

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake flop  would better More variety choose breakfast menu  everyone wants 3 pancakes side sausage  Some may want pancake 2 eggs sausage  If ask would cost much  The temperature least mid high 80s  Please monitor your building temperature Consider using real Pineapple juice pineapple pancake batter real slices Pineapple accompany pancake instead throwing chunk pineapples top it  Brown Sugar Whipped Butter would delicious well <EOR> Sunday afternoon family mom decided introduce favorite brunch place  stoked mom pop place   The gentleman owner recognized mother sat booth  ordered beverages hen he disappeared good solid 5 minutes then another server came over asked if we'd helped  place tiny bit bizarre  No big deal  drinks came shortly then ordered   My sister ordered cornbeef hash eggs rather bland  She side home fries which didn't onion peppers any real seasoning cut potatoes fried pan  mother meat lovers omelet which nothing special  ordered crunchy French toast delightful  mother didn't biscuits gravy she ordered remind them side bacon  took 2x asking it   All all food 2 5 stars worthy but piss poor service dinged right off  Although waiter friendly he inconsistent only patrons establishment  <EOR> Probably worst all around experiences while  Came few Sundays ago  Mistake #1 Our waitress a hates job  b hates life general  c Both  I no idea why girl would hired first place  only words exchanged between uswere having     honest way she other customers treated best  She didn't crack smile she didn't even look us  She just seemed though she miserable did want there   Mistake #2 Out pancakes 9 am Saturday????!!!!!
