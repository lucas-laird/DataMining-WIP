When first saw restaurant Downtown Summerlin honestly didn't think food would great  All good Chinese restaurants Chinatown aren't they? Although food awesome would find Chinatown thought pretty tasty filling  usual order BBQ Pork Fried Rice Steamed BBQ Pork Buns Dim Sum cart  fried rice always full flavor never dry  Portion size normally see Chinese restaurant  always take home leftovers! Kind hard screw BBQ Pork buns but usually hot fresh  time seemed sitting while did taste good  kind weird even Dim Sum cart when restaurant small tables close each other  Although tried husband likes order roast duck here   Prices definitely high but expected because Summerlin  Service unfortunately hit miss  Sometimes employees friendly attentive  Other times waiter waitress take your order then never see them again    I shop Downtown Summerlin definitely back! <EOR> Did restaurant all! should have read other reviews first  very difficult communicate wait staff  place kid friendly all  Also restaurant expensive amount food received  returning  <EOR>
