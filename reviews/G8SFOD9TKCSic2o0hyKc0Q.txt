I personally would thank excellent service food phenominal appetizers great  big Kosher food but honest If ur looking great steak some really good food general definitely place go  <EOR> I'm pretty sure most 5 star reviews friends family owners  service staff poorly trained food mediocre best    The ribeye very thin cut fat rendered properly chewey  need use thicker cut teach cooks render fat steak    The brisket average served tasted and probably was powdered canned gravy served paltry side soggy veggies    The biggest issue however colleague's chicken milanaise served uncooked center not just pink but jelly like raw   reason raw center because cooks haven't trained pound chicken breast down even thcikness breast much thicker center football shaped won't cook evenly  alerted nearby server took dish away    At point would expect manager involved but staff apparently trained sufficiently waited almost 15 minutes until colleague requested order cancelled entirely  staff took chicken off check but no other apology compensation offered colleague    Here's problem this  Staff should never able remove items check only management which 99% restaurant Point Sales set   would willing bet manager removed item check yet failed investigate why  exudes lack training and or unprofessional management    My colleague's mother upon paying bill expressed dissatisfaction server which point he asked if wanted manager visit he shouldn't even need ask point but instead just inform he would getting manager involved   manager apologized in somewhat unprofessional manner saying she upset happened going lay into kitchen staff but no other offer compensation  other colleague left bad review which deserved     As leaving owner manager chased down asked if left negative review  She then rudely asked remove review so course doubling down because hurts business  Well if don't want bad reviews train your staff properly train your cooks properly  She option point tear check refund accept full responsibility substandard food service which point she wouldn't even ask take down review because would changed 5 stars volunatarily    Moral story its screw ups define but handle them  <EOR> Amazing food  But most importantly impecable service  back every single time back Vegas  <EOR> My son hamburger aficionado said the monster Burger best burger ever had  19 ounce ribeye steak which also  tremendous very well flavored  wife fall off bone juicy delicious ribs which exactly described  Service terrific  waiter definitely gave excellent advice  best order  <EOR> My husband never privacy restaurants home town  nice finally tonight  Ace steaks perfect combination high class totally feel comfortable walking wearing jeans kinda place  would come back heartbeat    My only problem restaurant everything looks good couldn't order all   guess we'll another trip here  <EOR> This place ace hole  steak kabob succulent juicy pillowy aromatic rice perfect mop all flame kissed goodness  Seasoned perfection house blended spices  can't wrong  Mix grilled veggies all  Highly recommend!! <EOR> The food gets better every visit  Always amazing always raising bar!
