Depending location cleanliness varies  location VERY CLEAN maintained    My usual order consists chile rellano shrimp burrito sometimes cheese quesadilla  Late night cravings FTW! The chile rellano think acquired taste  very cheesy saucy inside pepper but delicious  Try side horchata if spice life isn't your life motto    The shrimp burrito HUGE  usually takes 2 people finish unless appetite case still probably only thing you'd need order feel satisfied    The cheese quesadilla extremely cheesy mention super greasy  *order caution*   Bottomline If craving some decent food even late hours night where bang your buck  might want try this  <EOR> This Sunset Pecos fantastic!!! Friendly service happy employees food great!!! Came California am hooked place! <EOR> I've heard place since moving passed restaurants everywhere Vegas  chimichanga plate did disappoint  chimi's tortilla fried something delicious   Haven't tried anything else yet but definitely back! <EOR> The worst robertos town  Quality horrible different all other locations  Salsa homemade taste came New York City  New York City???

No complaints me   I am certified cheese addict! Usually when Mexican restaurant ask extra cheese  thank goodness!   Other family members ordered burritos really large full ingredients  thing didn't care think need change fact won't remove certain ingredients burritos  example mom wanted chicken burrito no tomatoes lady said she couldn't because already mixed there   news me  thought put fresh veggies when putting together  mom allergy tomatoes think something should changed patrons allergies  Basically all burritos came way which meant she couldn't enjoy any them   Otherwise food really good pretty extensive menu which made easier choose something else  <EOR> Since husband moved Vegas NY craving some fast Mexican food somewhere close home stopped chorizo Burrito husband enchilada plate!! Well now chorizo Burrito least once week!! absolutely love it!! never anything bad here! always remember when call come in!! Very friendly fast service!! Great price great food!! tried others but far beats rest quality food cleanliness!! course again very friendly employees!! Thank you!! continue visit guys!!!    <EOR> If want over priced absolutely flavorless tacos Roberto's place you! starving last night craving some tacos  haven't Roberto's ages looking forward some delicious tacos  ordered pile crunchy tacos quesadilla then home eat   The chicken odd texture zero flavor  Seriously why ask places flavor food?  The quesadilla just foil wrapped puddle grease leaking everywhere couldn't more few bites into it   Seems memory needed reminder why didn't eat anymore  <EOR> I've going Roberto's while slowly going dumps! Ordered Carne asada burrito full unmelted cheese asked them remake wouldn't rolled eyes said  come along want really your restaurant worker should take time apologize right along water downed green sauce NEVER back long 5 year customer!!! <EOR> Fresh food MTO made order!

Way better chipotle more bang your buck! meat food sitting around scooped pan while people point it! staff really nice helpful! if need something sweet try Rice milk   taste churro! <EOR> Not better Roberto's town  Salsa charge $2 89 plain chips! Everyone else charges buck  Food decent  <EOR> Stupidly overpriced nachos fast food when asked if came lettuce answer No but added $1 extra   LETTUCE!
