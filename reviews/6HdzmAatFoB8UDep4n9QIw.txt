<EOR> The last time deviated normal chocolate chip pancakes opted blueberry pancakes  turned just good chocolate which bit surprising since chocolate tends trump all things   did bot skimp all blueberries just chock full them   Though pancakes delcious service did match  quite mediocre  Although may because baby started crying every time server came she's very attached would hesitant regularly check table baby cried every time came close too  server only came take order drop off food   I'll come back because huge fan pancakes  <EOR> I did some research usually when eat unfamiliar non local restaurant  son gluten free  called asked ability served shelled eggs versus normal eggs pancake batter added in  gal answered phone quick say wouldn't able accommodate allergy  Feeling defeated yet hungry asked manager  Nery came phone  explained allergy research done eating gluten free IHOP  Nery very nice informative  She knew exactly asking  She informed ask eggs country style which means cracked egg no additives  She also said she would serve personally when arrived    With little training hostesses or whomever answering phones IHOP could running 5 stars customer service  <EOR> The rating right  Why pancakes seem smaller other ihops?

Luckily menu table mom quickly started comparing prices  She immediately noticed charged incorrect amounts  wife suggested maybe pricing different given hour  looked through menu check see any sort fine print may state prices subject change based time but none  asked server if prices where different given time he explained not  showed server inconstancies check pricing listed menu  He said WOW! shocked never someone point out  He then picked tab credit card which laying table said let see why did that  thoughts oh well he's surely going edit amounts bring correct bill charge me  Well surprise he did absolutely nothing simply charged incorrect amount    I very short temper especially when feel someone trying take fool but particular instance held cool simply walked establishment before turned ihop into crime seen over 2 measly dollars  wife later asked why aggravated situation explain if ihop doing every single person because no checking bills then committing fraud false advertising  explained if committing fraud I'd jail why ok them it? end day its 2 dollars its principal!!   I ended writing contact form issue doubt they'll actually reply  <EOR> The service terrible! staff more concerned talking laughing then serving customers  worst IHOP ever to  server rolled eyes when ordering though difficult take order  <EOR> I come waitress Olivia A  always takes good care every time breakfast lunch location  <EOR> Great study place night  hostess worked tonight sweetest people ever  <EOR> I used think IHOP alright back day but lately really gone downhill  only few things would order menu but definitely prefer Denny's all way! used Chicken Waffles until started over cook chicken point where hard cut bite into  Sometimes also forget give butter waffles  thing really grossed syrup containers  messy sticky doesn't seem ever take time clean them  time regular maple syrup tasted strawberry syrup also mixed into ewww! gross started ask sugar free syrup which bring separate plastic bottle  healthier choice well no complaints there  Also need better job cleaning tables  Food ground chairs tables sticky next customers ugh!!  Service hit miss  If busy while before seat take your order check refill drinks  also dislike no longer cashier front anymore  now wait your server take payment your bill which sometimes takes forever  Another thing saw past manager just stood floor arms crossed watching employees closely telling them do  He did entire time there  mean don't wrong am sure its easy being manager IHOP  understand he needs sure employees doing job but maybe instead just standing looking pissed off all day some work set example your team?   Not recommended  many other good places eat area alone  <EOR> I usually ihop but last night never back location again  When girlfriend walked 1040pm several couples groups noticed weren't eating thought nothing it  taking order much smaller menu none dinner items left  Mainly breakfast items minutes started rolling by    1 couple older man sitting himself both which before arrived finally recieved order 25 minutes later  Around 1115pm over 30 minutes stop waitress ask if food started if leave  ask 1 couple another before us gets leaves without receiving food  waitress being embarrassed annoyed situation sure tells he start order girlfriend leave    The food sure same every other ihop but cook needs act together  save ihop visits when  town only option other denny's <EOR>
