What mistake looking forward something different   really should read reviews before stopping  serve small refrigeration didn't wanted anyway  Should looked closer but walking around airport Hungary! sandwich stops better  worth ago repeat stop  Many other areas better  didn't even options explained should just walked out  <EOR> Good place airport beer but don't bring your appetite food refrigerated sandwiches   Good service bar surprisingly authentic Irish bar music American 80s 90s   <EOR> Close gates less crowded due location decent bar  is  Ok quick drink before your flight  <EOR> It's good hope  real pub  food less mediocre  guess real reason stop beer  place does look inviting but no table service all food prepackaged  sandwiches mostly stale bread very little fixings them  would better off trying fast food spot <EOR> Located next C1 perfect place drink off Vegas hangover while wait your flight  expensive 9 dollar glass wine cheaper paid anywhere strip! some entertaining Vegas stories other patrons  including man whose traveling companion drunk through security  Better reading copy Weekly! <EOR> Expensive only snacks no food beer selection small overhead must killer expensive   only plus convenient  <EOR> You may ask why 5 stars well let explain place sucks but know suck fully embrace it  people working always pleasant helpful but no excuse menu pre made sandwiches frig ballpark nachos   Why never crowded bartender understands am stuck airport much longer should as usual handles appropriately   Oh did mention crowded   No leaving Las Vegas idiots standing middle walkway  those brilliant people thought bring 3 kids all still stroller Las Vegas good idea   It dislike people but when am leaving Las Vegas generally enough people   If feeling then place you  If please please don't come ruin rest us  <EOR> Rude rude rude    Over priced    bartender could barely communicate didn't give 5 minutes look menu before he telling order leave    customer place he wants rush out   Glad many other choices airport trained staff welcome customers <EOR> I tried bite eat Smithwick's   There's fridge premade sandwiches no Smithwick's   don't think call yourself Irish Pub just because 6 beers tap Guinness   ended going somewhere else    <EOR> Nice little hidden pub near gate C 1   Friendly bartender prompt service   else could ask while waiting flight delay? <EOR> Not sure WHY all bad reviews    They serve beer actually know pour Guinness correctly!!  I few times now waiting SWA flight pint black stuff snack    My experience great! The service outstanding usually busy because don't serve food   Hate say because probably packed now but even Sunday flying Vegas usually seats available   A great place watch sunday  ! <EOR> If could give place NO STARS would  Irish Pub  bar gets food vending machine  Well airport could live that  Two workers and am two customers inconveniences workers minds place  inform come bar order  sigh weary traveler   Then them says what? legs broke? KIDDING? If want abused eat convenience store food your place  <EOR> It seems frivolous review airport food  Pub food almost always mediocre  Stick pub airport should keep your expectations low  very large helping chicken tenders Corcoran's  able stave hunger save myself spending money tiny box assorted snacks plane  <EOR> I SouthWest flight gate C2 which tucked down end particular terminal seemingly void shops restaurants   Lo behold spied sign Corcorans Pub being thirsty seeing mirage dessert    Well service point really liked Jennifer working bar super friendly easy talk with   also location Minnesota miracle 29 24 over Saints crowd loud!    To set record straight true pub some Guiness mirrors walls few Irish beers tap but  where pub parallel stops   Kudos Jennifer she poured perfect pint Guiness which art   did any food review service establishment only   bar beer various hard alcohols those wondering  <EOR> This strange little place located near C1 gate busy crowded Southwest Airlines concourse  Even though looks regular restaurant doesn't appear any table service  seating myself open table waited ten minutes watched other patrons bar order food drink  perusing menu wandered over asked if anything menu could made gluten free  I celiac disease eating gluten big no me  Sadly nothing menu GF    But thirsty did order pomegranate mojito  Here's where Corcoran's earned its second star  bartender made hand good strong  sure worth price tip came almost $20 but definitely hit spot before long flight home Atlanta  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  sitting over 20 minutes yet greeted  finally bar place order bartender still no drink  only reason why stuck around long because found charging station table    As typing bartender approached table aggressively yelled dare ask clean your table order drink! said excuse me? ordered Bloody Mary 20 minutes ago yet bring me  He said oh yah forgot  never offended Resturant bar staff member life  Unbelievable! John Taffer Bar Rescue would falling over right now!   Needless say left  <EOR> tucked away gate C1 vegas airport hence probably hardly any reviews haha   But good little place away many people bustling round quick drink   actually nice enough let eat Jersey Mike's sandwich while drinking beer     They menu food but what's menu serve nacho cheese hotdogs? sure why menu but see behind bar counter  <EOR> Decent place quick drink before getting plane    gate C2 easy if you're section C Terminal   Would way there?  No but fine place quick one     Will back?  Sure sometimes need drink when leave Las Vegas  <EOR> I'll give place 2 star review two good things it  First located between gate C1 C2 quiet away craziness plus one  Second beer cold  airport food no expecting fine dining but little redemption here   The food all bagged chips pre made sandwiches look taste came off food truck  menu does clear nor really notice small half sized fridge serve yourself of    The Irish pub few beers tap typical Irish music  pump otherwise you'll need Irish ante side things    If just want quick $8 9 beer then swing quiet kill time  If any real hankering real food find another spot eat leave Irish Classic your plans  <EOR>
