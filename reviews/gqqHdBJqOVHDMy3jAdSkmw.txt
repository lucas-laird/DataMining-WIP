But each order 2 small pieces  seems premade but oh well  also baked mussels which okay definitely better   They great selection items menu amaebi uni lobster rolls etc  But maybe slow service made enjoy food  wasn't wow anything   The fish pretty fresh rolls decent size   I believe place used Yummy Sushi    but sure  used LOVE yummy sushi lunch  made great smoothies  But Kan Pai didn't offer any   So other items ordered Baked Lobster Roll yummy! but limited orders deep fried lobster roll also yummy  Spider roll expected all    wrapped green wrap thing rather seaweed  Johnny roll fresh fish wrapped cucumber liked it  Cherry Blossom roll basically crab meat wrapped avocado also limited quantity but nothing special  Also some other rolls everything pretty fresh but nothing great  Full sauce   Amaebi deep fried heads which yummy  Uni first thing ordered but didn't until 45minutes later didn't give full order when asked said ran but failed mention when brought order table  also ordered 8 orders sake uni only received half order  ended ordering many things because never received certain things other ordered f'd up  Overall great experience   The servers nice but barely spoke english  sushi chefs busy drinking guest bar    best thing place unlimited dessert tempura ice cream green tea ice cream red bean ice cream  So its average sushi place  it  took full essay say that  Sorry  <EOR> What find  love never crowded but worry needs more business survive     Excellent menu great sushi chefs   Huge serving money  Great value  <EOR> I ate first time Saturday night  place busy seated quickly given option sitting booth bar   I did try sushi  kalbi entree boyfriend teriyaki entree  Both entrees accompanied soup salad  main entrees sizzling hot plate when arrived  presentation awesome food even better!   For paying think might expect more food especially since its American way enormous entrees but amount food just right  But some $15 should yield more food   For dessert strawberry mango mochi drizzled chocolate  delicious!  The atmosphere great  quiet interior design place beautiful  even TV near bar football on    The best part experience service! attentive nice  Maybe because place pretty much empty Friday night? <EOR> Ehhhh eaten lot sushi Las Vegas painfully sub par   I tried kiss fire roll kamikaze roll  Kiss fire if recall correctly shrimp tempura albacore garlic ponzu sauce jalapeno crab  fine  Just fine  No great shakes nothing made say wow  incredible  The kamikaze roll    eel just didn't taste fresh  Call snob but prices I'd expect better quality  When you're paying $14ish roll just expecting better  know Nobu Okada but still    same prices I'd 10000% rather Naked Fish Oyshi  all sushi options Las Vegas Kan Pai doesn't greatest job separating itself  <EOR> I didn't really expect coming back without another $25 gift certificate but Family Music next door saw now offering all eat sushi  Next thing knew roommate made mission ASAP  Two nights later $25 95 quite possibly best all eat experience ever had   Not only fish fresh delicious but selection amazing  Normally when all eat prices restrict most menu only eat cheapest rolls sashimi sushi  did skimp selections all everything wanted try included  top dessert part deal which literal icing sushi cake that sounds pretty gross now see writing    If looking most amazing sushi best tasting rolls still better options but 5 star review simply taste mixed value  $25 95 myriad fresh fish?

If could just order would satisfied      it reminded miniature shrimp steak dinner  thought fantastic! <EOR> I always GREAT service when here   seems no matter much time passed always remember when come treat very well   They ALWAYS running sushi specials whenever dinner   menu prices don't even matter when comes sushi because said specials easy stock different varieties sushi even more easy full   Mind exactly free but does give some some leniency play different types rolls   I've only time lunch but several months ago wasn't jazzed service during day shift they served everyone table but meal much later  2 3 minutes but around 15   Still good but everyone already finished bento boxes sashimi rolls ate alone crowd also only lunch table day      While realize may fluke still normally sushi bit night again service solid there   people run place hostess sever chefs   Desserts also good   pretty tasty mango sorbet chocolate  good sharing   I don't often but consistently good dinners being treated familiar recognized regular despite only stopping once month so   Life changing?  Perhaps much   But dependable don't feel going end spinning roulette wheel when comes overall quality flavor  <EOR> This okay option sushi because restaurant com certificate discount offer   Admittedly certificate few times lunch don't believe would many AYCE sushi joints probably better options   The sushi itself amazing pay non AYCE prices but point incredible salmon skin salad loved   would come again this   The service hit miss first time more impressed subsequent visits   last time very frustrating brought salmon skin salad last thing ate filling sushi   bit full really enjoy but said salmon skin takes awhile bake   hour?  No don't think so   Good option if live work area   But best sushi town far  <EOR> This most part your average strip mall sushi joint   Typical fare atmosphere   all you can eat option but just ordered off menu   So why 4 stars hypercritical Yelper?  Well      The service friendly must sushi bar    The prices very competitive   What made impression fact rolls loaded   Fish!  wasn't some places trying trim food costs actually full size sushi roll  sorry no pic      I ordered roll tuna nice full serving all rice cucumber!  spicy tuna good size roll too   Decent fare fair prices   all ask for! <EOR>
