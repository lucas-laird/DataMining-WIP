Upset friend stole gal planned asking date?  Want ensure revenge via fast acting gut bomb?  Take or her Corsa overpriced meal literally *leave* or her pain   only excuse Vegas high price food need cover cost all salt must use preparing food   My first bite fried calamari emptying salt shaker mouth   Bravely continued mushroom salt paste pizzetta so so dish rich mashed potatoes   Veal parmigiana good Buca di Beppo's which saying much IMHO short rib rigatoni heavy fat oh did mention ragu salty?    If could give place minus stars would   If must stop waste your money then hit bar decent Bloody Mary glass wine   only good items any three night    Even blood orange mojito overly sweet  Ha ha gotcha!
