Chicken Empanadas=Delish!!!  Gotta try them! wasn't very fond beef p  I heart Ube purple yam cake! Delish    moist   the best! <EOR> The food mediocre   tried glass noodle dish but flavor bland   beef empanadas slightly salty   only thing liked chicken empanadas   bread cover slightly sweet over tasty shredded chicken making good balance     The cakes look good but moist enough taste  <EOR> Ordered halo halo which pretty decent  good treat hot day   could improve leche flan though creamy looks gelatinous   Also ordered sponge cake mamon takeout which pretty good well  <EOR> I stopped afternoon Friday 5pm though weren't lot people service awfully slow took 1 2 hr just cake counter only person ahead me!
