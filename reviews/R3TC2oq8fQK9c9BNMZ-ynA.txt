Never again  many other restaurants Strip subject myself crappy level service again   PS Julia think may same server! <EOR> I usually enjoy eating RA Sushi especially prime location such Las Vegas but quite disappointed latest experience  pretty slow night service still unusually slow  Also requested ginger but never brought us  <EOR> Mediocre almost worth sushi service slowest world  Rolls same caliber find qfc central market local grocery stores sushi islands    horrible service top that    SLOW! <EOR> Nice big location sit outside eat  weekday early afternoon  really busy loud while other taking long time initially service still decently fast throughout meal almost point rushing but least server friendly   Lunch specials good but restaurant menus really dirty point being kind gross almost wanting touch them   sashimi lunch special rice came seasoned sushi rice plain steamed white rice that?

Also thoroughly enjoyed signature bourbon strawberry cocktail Samurai Smash   dining before concert all seven well fed great time hour   Would definitely recommend return if we're back Vegas  <EOR> I want give place 4 star review because really often but first time happy hour last week say opinion taken real dive down into almost three more 2 5 arena   The good The decor nice hip place excepting women's room always very clean  The fish fresh  The location great because Strip but being outskirts Fashion Show Mall difficult navigate without setting foot or car Strip  They nice foursquare check in gives order edamame miso soup   Pretty cool  The Ra'chin Shrimp appetizer shrimp available during happy hour really good   sauce doesn't really complement dish but shrimp nice without it  The Viva Las Vegas Roll seared tuna really good   more fusion but totally works   order them each time am there   The consistent The servers bigger attitudes any other restaurant ever consistently   Once understand aren't being personally rude they're just being kind vapid because don't care     Last week boyfriend sent back chicken wings because tasted off he did indigestion later server said Well always liked them walked away   She took them off check table but she kind dismissive jerk it   come just expect service you're inconveniencing them being there  The music loud   bar portion RA fun yes but when over table portion don't want hear pounding music over your conversation   consistency why avoid being 9pm   The bad My luck must placing women's room when line no toilet paper   always other especially when two stalls commission  They pride themselves great sake list but often 86'ed whichever am ordering   Boo   guess should placed consistencies well  Happy hour drinks good   But shocked see skinny rolls because during happy hour   almost comical   won't going dine again under guise deal   All all if don't mind dismissive service but need something without drama heading into heart Strip good but don't high high hopes  <EOR> I remember when place excellent sushi  2nd time row really disappointed  leaving half both smelly rolls ordered wife leave half chicken bowl  chicken almost decent   Rice isn't cooked   tiny rainbow roll chose dress salad fill small plate   Lol   Reminds gas station sushi    Dammit  Should tried across walkway time  <EOR> For those understand some Japanese RA also spelled hiragana sound raw which somewhat clever name sushi restaurant  Too bad place more meh  sorry apparently hiragana can't show yelp    The decor nice fancy but there's obsession color red once step inside really overbearing  lights red puts such strain your eyes painful just read menu  Seriously felt trapped inside Nintendo Virtual Boy machine something  when food came didn't even look appetizing because can't even tell you're eating unless take picture flash then appreciate colors effort put into food's presentation   I ordered Viva Las Vegas Roll Crazy Monkey Roll  VLV primarily crab cream cheese concoction nice fried lotus root which added nice crunch  good but few pieces kind lose track flavor seafood which gets overtaken other ingredients a common trait Americanized sushi   Crazy Monkey Roll sweet teriyaki sauce glaze cashews sweet shiny look made seem fish baklava  Kinda good but strangely gross if think it  friends most worse luck  Two ordered same Lobster Shrimp Roll but short stick lobster tasted off seemed old  Yuck   As service mixed bag  Attentive waiters readily refreshing glass but chefs slow CMR came almost 20 minutes received VLV   Overall if Americanized sushi flashy modern settings then RA might place you  But if your eyeballs actually want taste your seafood your sushi probably much better options elsewhere Vegas your sushi fix  <EOR> Prior heading Marquee night party 10 ppl made reservations RA sushi dinner  Last minute more people added party hostess accommodating  Though took some convincing believe due them being busy night  started dinner round drinks some peppers  peppers undercooked worst all places ordered same type peppers    We also ordered ceviche appetizer which served unrippened avocados type fish maybe few shrimp  Though best all items ordered definitely considered good  Once drinks came all enjoying time placed entree orders server  roll took longest arrive even correct order  continued just eat unsatisfactory appetizers suppress hunger continued asking server when roll would out  everyones food finished brought roll another appetizer forgotten originally deliver   We felts though place Las Vegas would more attentive servers much better customer service  wait around 20 minutes them bring bill which asked numerous times for  bill lot incorrect orders them adjust again which required another 15 minutes time   Overall dinner experience mediocre best  understand large party more difficult accommodate everyones needs but lack attentiveness received acceptable  However did good fried rolls which few other members party ordered  But if real sushi quality fish RA definitely place consider  <EOR> Great happy hour order Viva Las Vegas Rolls  Sunday nights dj great entertainment  <EOR> A great sushi joint located first floor Fashion Mall Las Vegas   Especially great during happy hour M Sat 3 7   Ambience great place hang out   dining room area sushi bar   also seperate partitioned

Thanks again good food time!!! <EOR> This review would 5 stars if restaurant paid more attention reservations  Husband made reservation days prior anniversary noted he wanted some type intimate table setting if possible  Seating middle dining area rather booth when only 3 tables inside whole place just extremely rude unfair given he provided option note something reservation request  Now note never eaten location before but eaten Chicago location roughly 3 years ago enjoyed much! We anxious give location try glad did  happy hour best sushi but greatest drinks  don't flavored warm saki but strange flavors add yours  favorite roll remembered Chicago Vegas roll reminded why favorite once again  never found roll quite but love it!  Unfortunately rolls ordered mashed avocado clearly little aged allergic reaction unable eat but Husband enjoyed many other rolls  Also read review try pineapple wontons worth it!!! Try them!! <EOR> thought sushi rolls pretty mediocore   though if you're weekday really can't happy hour specials   there's also sometimes dj which helps keep place lively  <EOR> Came second time Sat Nov 15   hostess Jessica super sweet gave several options where could sit   waitress I believe named Megan shorter cute short blond hair she super super sweet giggly great waitress   started edamame which just normal edamame   also spicy tuna roll starter tasty   entree Tuna2 salad which pretty tasty   much raw fish but ra fish could seasoned something add bit more taste   good though   friend Ultimate Shrimp tempura roll said fine  just decent other friend the     i cant find website but steak roll served some type sauce   ended ordering 2nd roll because pretty tasty  the meat little over cooked but good sauce   The service great atmosphere fun  and heating lamps patio great end dinner friend ordered espresso martini sweet but super good super strong!

Let's down it  RA located within Fashion Mall end new Strip Spring Mountain Rd Las Vegas Blvd across Wynn Encode hotels   Therefore really crowded really empty  Frankly usually between  during weekends usually some sort music being played bar reverberates through ENTIRE restaurant  Meaning diners listen he latest hip hop whatever DJ playing  Great if younger crowd much if full older folks and yes age varies day time too!   Parking found behind Fashion Mall underground garage  pretty spacious down but people drive morons watch out! ambience RA is  bathed annoying red light  Okay first thought OMG cool    then when tried read menu take photos food  enlist help flash clear photos!! he lighting I'd expect going date restaurant guess    The bar plenty alcohol whip numerous drinks oh many sakes wines bottled beers   Because sushi sake bombs hand hand  quite picky eater when comes sushi raw fish better safe sorry right? least RA fresh fishies plate! RA 5 types sushi  Maki Sashimi Nigiri then hand rolls specialty rolls only found RA locations   Personally prefer specialty rolls Maki choices  shrimp tempura hand roll lovely crunch fresh chunks shrimp inside   When browsing menu usually know  1st time eating back 2010 when first moved Nevada still relatively new sushi  Now staple  latest trip provided 3 4 different rolls  chose Vegas Roll Rainbow Roll Avocado Cucumber Rolls garlic edamame  Vegas rolls fresh full crab cream cheese mix played crab flavor wasn't overly strong cream cheese   tempura decoration top tasty haha  avocado cucumber rolls both fresh but chunk cucumber where difficult bite through because pretty thick  not mention still through layer rice  not easy roll eat just bite   California roll standard ANY sushi place just any other sushi place  it tasted just every other Cali roll had  But plenty crab! slices fish adorning Rainbow rolls fantastic  leary Rainbows because fresh fish slices but chef came reassured fish delivered earlier morning slip prove it  Can't much fresher that  especially when ya know  there's ocean good 300+ miles haha  particular Rainbow Roll only found RA while seen them elsewhere amount crab meat within roll far better one! enjoyed choices but would probably pass cucumber rolls again maybe Cali rolls just open spots new choices ^_^ Service varies day time crowd  came many times living good bad service hostess chef  chefs almost always fab but guy just snotty  Didn't see March maybe he's gone? Anywho going around peak feeding hours happy hour seems generate few cranky employers just because gets darn busy! Lunch usually better! Also sign RA newsletter coupon half birthday discount plenty deals change weekly! definitely taken advantage half birthday deal worth IMO    RA good sushi joint Strip but if know some locals hit them up  good ones hidden sleeves ^_ but if RA trick if you're wanting sushi can't drive because spent day drinking  mean did give 4 stars  Service why 5  ^_^ <EOR> Food alright  But customer service beyond Excellent! Friendly bartender made some off menus drinks ended drinking more expected night! <EOR> Ra Sushi located Fashion Show mall across Wynn    Being Asian descendant grew having Japanese cuisine whole life become more picky selection over years  visit Beef Teriyaki Bento  quite pleased cut beef served  used nice steak cut  Bento bowl great value  came miso soup salad rice choice protein    The food alright general  place felt quite Americanized   am sure if would die come back again  However if am area am craving Japanese cuisine would inclined try different items  <EOR>
