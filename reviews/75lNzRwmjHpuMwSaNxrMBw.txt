****This review only service since bad waited long canceled order 5 minutes later bring order anyway while wait speak manager****  So before Gazillionaire Elite Event Caeser's friend decided Muncheeze quick bite due time constraints   personally think hour casual dinning establishment more enough time sit eat pay bill leave but guess thinking wrong thing instance     We greeted hostess seated quickly   arrived sat next couple just sat down ordered waitress then took drink order same time asked TV put specific game   order drinks she gives minute look menu   5 minutes later table next gets drinks she takes order   10 minutes drinks 15 minutes just drinks? table next gets food   15 minutes later table next done eating given check now most cases server would see right next them don't any food TV asked changed never changed another 15 minutes passes watch them pay leave table bussed before server comes back says don't your food yet?!? which answered no actually somewhere 8pm going cancel order  She said OK but check want go? Now since going event didn't want carry stuff across Casino then eat while event   declined asked speak manager   Before manager comes table food comes   Now even more irritated   already cancelled food obviously hungry otherwise would but enough common courtesy put food front can't eat now because no time would great The manager seemed friendly enough though situation very sorry incident but damage done   He offered tab next time stop but sure if want think lost 45 minute wait  <EOR> I love support food truck scene Vegas when heard Muncheeze check out! grill cheese food truck brilliant much more feasible  definitely cuts down waiting time might encounter other food trucks    My co worker decided try place during lunch hour  First impression great looking truck! graphics cute truck name   Muncheeze genius !  To fair judge always ordered quite few sandwiches Sassperilla Chi chi Piggy Mac judge quality sandwiches  must say impressed thought Chi Chi Piggy Mac pretty dang good  prefer Piggy Mac more over Chi Chi  bbq pulled pork just right because wasn't drenched BBQ sauce did hide taste other ingredients  Sassperilla drenched A1 sauce time ate sandwich soggy  Chi chi second choice great concept but little dry    We also side Mac bites well wasn't big fan holla peno ketchup  think should spicy ranch dipping instead maybe just serve ketchup marinara ranch    My co worker little disappointed didn't tomato soup day another day again soup   do ever soup?   For $10 sandwich bites drink saves couple bucks which isn't bad considering prices food truck combos    Overall experience worth it  Some people annoyed guys blasting music your favorite song whatever mood listen still they're still getting hang biz but shouldn't distract attempting just once  C'mon Vegas support your food trucks! Follow them Twitter Facebook website see where end next  <EOR> It's Piggy Mac warranted two stars cheesy Lovers just mess  Piggy Mac consisted bbq pork jalapenos mac n cheese $6   potential but wheat bread choice really poor  Cheesy Lovers Delight Bacon $5 good any level  Dry flimsy bread congealed cheese bland bacon  Yes bland bacon  Seems oxymoron doesn't it?
