Hot FRESH forget those tomatoes  All staff very friendly hard working  Beware people hanging around trying free meal  <EOR> Not sure really 'got paid for'      Just moved Florida CiCi's pizza everything wanted way more offerings higher quality ingredients   For $7 55 adult lunch buffet drink    Tried two different sodas both watered down almost flat  good thing give disposable cups   Unfortunately buffet contained all same things different crusts   two pepperoni two three cheese meat lovers buffalo chicken spinach feta  ate 5 slices pizza   The salad bar looked untouched good reason especially given fact main offering lettuce brown wilted    The staff adequate    Pay attention those five star reviews  seems people more interested Wiley keeping job actually providing rest honest reviews  place would probably only two stars if weren't people giving high reviews bus boy    My step uncle Fragile X syndrome which means he suffers specific type mental retardation  Wiley obviously some type syndrome great he working  Still management needs better job working ensure 'entertainment' 'sweet nature' quoted other Yelpers borderline harassment    A mother leave while because he wouldn't stop bothering toddler obviously afraid him  He spoke length several times huggies pampers twinkle twinkle little star more  made decision leave rather stare same pizzas when arrived  just interested another encounter him      If really mood slightly gross pizza aren't going eat more whole pie I'd recommended calling pick doing 2 large pizza deal which same price buffet  way want without 'experience' screaming children flat soda lukewarm pizza Wiley   Pieology   where should go  $8 fresh made pizza fresh unlimited toppings  won't returning any CiCi's Nevada  <EOR> All pizza salad pasta eat under $8 00 best lunch deals town  course isn't best pizza ever but didn't stop hitting hard  Almost reminded high school pizza ate all loved pizza day  Salad bar stable desserts offered hit everyone  see no reason back hungry there's plenty  <EOR> Pretty standard Cici's  staff courteous but almost seemed though may under staffed during visit  When think maybe e other tables but during visit picked became pretty busy  manager site girl working register more person kitchen bus boy runner  When larger numbers hit could tell    The food pretty good  Comparable other locations  bacon ranch salad though crisp should pretty wilty soft while eating    Overall good place just need work staffing ensuring check food quality regular basis  <EOR> Haven't ages! absolutely love cinnamon rolls dessert soft chewy    I love order specialty pizza slices takes only few minutes bring your table    The salad bar little weak didn't fill until leaving only end lunch rush's supply  pasta looked little dry avoided it   I did enjoy all pizzas available white spinach pizza buffalo chicken classic pepperoni Hawaiian  Most them hot oven delicious but toppings didn't all way crust plate dry uneaten crusts table  Hey buffet! many people worry what's left plates   For price absolutely worth it  pizza came filled tasty cinnamon rolls dessert pizzas icing cake! would definitely come again but probably lunch later dinner    coming between when filling dinner rush said salad pastas weren't appetizing would hoped    Random fact Latinos people wiping counters sweeping preparing pizzas busing tables while two white chicks literally stood around gossiping    I'm white btw thought stereotypical but true    counter couple times ladies wouldn't respond walked farther down other workers more happy answer questions fill order  people helped nice polite both welcomed thanked coming super cool    Recap great prices tasty pizza desserts  Come lunch dinner but between  Definitely return  <EOR> Everyone knows know two favorite things buffets pizzas  Cici's best both worlds  more fair share pizza always order barbecue chicken pizza all myself  let special requests accommodate pretty much anything might want your pizza within reason  Nothing bad that  <EOR> We traveling didn't know area well  wanted try place first time tasty  employees friendly 'catchy' way asking more pizzas made  Fun friendly place  Very inviting  Every time pizza came group waiting customers would cheer  Kinda Silly but great  good time  <EOR> I am expecting anything fancy but walk see just every available table piled dirty plates discouraging  never keep amount people coming dine food choice buffet pathetic  employees really couldn't care less  only2w3w2w w2 came because kids really wanted kids buffet $ 99  am happy paid $8 cup mediocre chicken soup since nothing else appealing available especially non meat eater  <EOR> On god shit assssss gunna lie 7 11 better people take ever pizza most time waiting instead eating neeeeed more people <EOR> I read reviews before going today   Took along pocket packet Clorox wipes due all reviews stating dirty place   Monday arrive before noon   Husband happy see sign saying Monday $5 00 adult buffet   greeted nicely nobody else line   Place nearly empty no kids anywhere    Tomorrow might different story Tuesday  99 kids buffet   Everything described other yelpers far food went   Basic salad bar chicken noodle soup variety pizzas   2 different types brownies fresh cinnamon buns   place old but wasn't dirty all   Very huge seating areas   didn't visit restroom visit lasted 30 minutes    son ordered pizzas   never came up   Mine totally well done   very disappointed special order    If again wouldn't bother   plenty selections buffet fresh pizzas kept coming up   If hungry pizza future might visit again   would recommend place  <EOR> I live Marin County California adds T V couldn't wait try place when came down Vegas  company web site looks Cici's slowly coming Northern California  can't wait because believe something would thrive Nor Cal  Now enough day dreaming lets talk experience here     Great awesome staff people  employees seemed enjoyed being extremely helpful  also contact manager he seemed helpful cheery attitude  Everyone helpful    pizza good absolutly loved Macaroni Cheese Pizza  think ate 3 slices while here  also slice cheese pesto pizza both good  only came pizza experience didn't try any pasta's salads  did try Cici's famous Cinnamon  bread pizza when fresh oven yummy back seconds  Needless say Cici's really hungry ate weight pizza but looking back don't regret because isn't Cici's where live     If live Las Vegas traveling Las Vegas please check place out  really isn't anything pizza buffet its all eat low price  Much lower some other buffets find Las Vegas  <EOR> My best friend Cici's last Sunday around 11 30  Pizza delicious especially mac cheese one impressed fast churning pizzas  guy working think manager AWESOME very friendly  definitely back next time we're Vegas  <EOR> Place good manager bad attitude does understand business built return customers   hair found food blame putting but asking fire money back anuthing else but blamed  us <EOR> The restrooms dining area smells poop  customera complained manager he didnt anyone investigate smell more likely because hour half closing  food quality decent 7$ person but could filled sauces pasta back instead leaving them curdled overcooked  soda machine needed restocked syrups because drinks bitter  All all location seems doesn't care anything  Horrible  wouldnt recommend anyone <EOR> I'm usually bitter type but am very disappointed service given  person register phone when walked hollered coworker attend my mother I   paid began choose entrées when noticed all food dry looked if sitting all morning  pizza cold tasteless  Definitely worth $15 paid  If could give zero stars would  star gentlemen courteous happy work  Unfortunately did name otherwise would include it  returning customer  <EOR> I came Monday because bought Groupon   never Cicis didn't know expect   Right entered already could see huge mess all over lobby   worker front polite did mention under staffed   They very limited selection pizza whenever new ones came entire family would devour within seconds really didn't try more couple   good though   would give pizza itself 7 10   They're slightly better frozen pizzas buy grocery store   The rest experience just bad   place filthy   floors pieces pizza lettuce condiments napkins   almost slipped just walking lobby   majority tables empty but still dirty dishes pizza them   did see worker clean few them   The fountain drinks no ice when arrived looked dirty   mountain ice drip try   Overall would recommend place   pizza okay but considering dirty lobby only imagine dirty could kitchen  <EOR> Was impressed  atmosphere somewhat friendly but majority employees only spoke Spanish very limited English  woman clearing plates would circle circle when plate eating off wanted take soon last bite your hand  made very uncomfortable situation   The manager told customer would 20 min cinnamon rolls then 35 min when asked   the other employee stated whoever said wrong  it would additional 20 30 min cinnamon rolls  hour no cinnamon rolls  restaurant very busy shouldn't reason line fully stocked all times  Less 15 customers restaurant Another disturbing moment    the woman collecting plates came back area looked wet gloves two large rolls toilet paper  She into bathroom change add them already there  realllllly hope she changed gloves  <EOR> There's nothing worse being hungry having hungry kids arrive your choice being told closed though website says close 10 30 sign door says close 10pm people inside obviously ready home says close 9 30  But pay full price eat whatever left while stand because already put all chairs table covered salad bar plastic wrap

Pasta Salad salad offerings beginning buffet where you'll see lettuce some toppings olives bacon bits etc  assortment dressings  some lettuce drenched blue cheese dressing my favorite dressing but also good amount pasta salad  pasta salad because wasn't many other ingredients mixed pasta  light flavorful definitely recommend trying it    Traditional Pepperoni Pizza basic pepperoni cheese pizzas favorites when kid sometimes still hankering plain ol' pepperoni pizza  Fortunately CiCi's version isn't overloaded tomato sauce which just way it  Chicken Alfredo Pizza Although don't know name pizza I'm assuming chicken alfredo type one liked because few line featured cream sauce  small chunks grilled chicken atop pizza addition cheese pizza seemed topped same Alfredo sauce featured pasta station  cheese lover heart found pizza gooey delicious  sauce blended cheese nicely crust wasn't super thin  thin but really crispy sported just enough dough liking    Brownies CiCi's small dessert section end pizza line  little section provides several options those want end savory pizza meal sweet note  There's cinnamon bites dessert pizza slab cut brownies  always brownies yes more one finish off CiCi's visit  Although they're bit flatter most brownies encountered CiCi's brownies great because taste dark chocolate  Served warm topped powdered sugar brownies feature dark chocolate flavor moist dense  When first bite into brownie may seem little cakey because crisp top but once reach center you'll experience moist chewy fudginess every brownie stellar   Dessert Pizza sure what's dessert pizza exactly but subtly sweet taste  refreshing all savory garlicky flavors during meal! While usually brownie first when getting dessert always sure least piece dessert pizza  best all slices really small thin don't need feel bad taking more one!   Garlic Knots garlic knots found pasta section they're super garlicky flavorful! little round balls dough fill though try only start 1 2 then come back more later! <EOR> You pay fresh pizza actually surprising level deliciousness! lot feels greasy especially if sitting while but some things just greasy fattening period  really did mac n cheese pepperoni pizza wasn't huge fan anything else especially spinach cheese  Cici's best possible could be  <EOR> Super nice people!! food disgusting  opinion should only eat if low standards living paycheck paycheck  <EOR> Saw place looking something different  Nor sure caught eye   Anyways lunch pretty decent place considering its pizza buffet which typically isn't all glamorous  Impressed desserts especially brownie desert pizza white sauce topping  Everything else pretty standard    The people working behind counter very upbeat happy when dealt them    Overall bad place especially price  Probably won't try repeat but if area again might  <EOR> Ok little embarrassed admit actually place  first time eating Cici's  fella friend's forced dine boy did drag heels!  The price right pizza actually pretty ok  gourmet  even close being best pizza ever but definitely wasn't worst reluctantly admit actually pretty good    They lot variety customize pizza whatever craving  that? usually big fan dining anywhere where encounter lots kids but luckily came early enough wasn't major issue  favorite pizza probably buffalo chicken  good spice level pretty darn tasty  sure would issue future visits however   Try might place just couldn't done  can't price $4 99 $3 99 weekday lunch try hit them lunch next time save extra buck hehe   I request fella sure mention he entire pizza all himself not mention two extra slices buffalo two dessert pizza   He impressed feat not sure why felt need let everyone know  <EOR>
