Tried Ranch Hand sandwich which might add wasn't entirely bad considering sauces put them flavor ranchacado sauce really nice blend! Keep mind portions HUGE! ordered 6 inch you your pick between 6 8 12 still felt 6 inch filling enough split friends but then again  probably just portion sizes  grilled turkey wasn't overly dry cheddar nice sharp taste it  also well renowned gigantic pickles which first reason friend dragged first place   Prep time didn't take long all place virtually empty night in  Johnny's overlooks movie theater courtyard between all major bar restaurants its good place keep perched people watch spy your friends  Might add also classic video games such pac man frogger donkey kong well? <EOR> Give Olympian homemade pepper chips happy girl!!
