Much smaller!  two very overpriced margaritas well     While visit location future because near house try visit during happy hour times save few dollars very overpriced drinks     We prefer dine during lunch times take advantage lunch specials  <EOR> Insanely expensive was microscopically tiny overly spicy pulled beef sandwich accompanied tablespoon cole slaw shrimp salad 2 soups 2 iced teas  Came $32+tip lunch wish gone Jack In The Box  <EOR> Sorry  But coming anymore   why       1 party loud drunk older women screaming every 2 seconds!!!

Fix your food ASAP!  used come weekly basis but may last time  <EOR> I order Applebee's almost every week every other week due its convenience just food itself   I live literally walking distance away location let's just say  only reason getting 2 stars    They constantly mess pick order  Whether forgetting sides making food incorrectly giving ingredients French onion soup ordered separate containers so myself ? always something    I literally drive location fort Apache 215 good 15 20 min drive just avoid dealing location   Not good being close airport think would game tourists  <EOR> This bad experience start  party 3 my wife father myself   least 4 open booths plain view waiting area  wasn't terribly busy  hostess wouldn't sit wife until third person party arrived  She said she sorry but busy  insisted being sat she looked though peed morning coffee    Once sat met waitress  Which three times talked all night  She took drink order didn't see until she took dinner order then another time refill drinks which ask managers since hardly saw waitress    I think part trouble new system Applebee's touch screens each table  screen order your dinner ask refills pay your bill few other functions  really wish when sat down first met server gave quick rundown all could do  great all things but request refill via touch screen  waitress passed table several times never once actually talked see if would refill    The food ok  wasn't exceptional but wasn't terrible  best part entire experience being able pay bill table  worst same Applebee's few years back service terrible then well  Bad service weighing location down  <EOR> Our server Sam she great!! Pleasant helpful any questions had   Food really good!! <EOR> My wife Ordered 2 things off low fare menu Salmon Chicken   It EXCELLENT    Full flavor   If didn't know off low cal menu wouldn't guessed it   picked curbside go   car ready within 2 mins  Great food   Great experience  <EOR> Just off 215 Warm Springs Applebee's always welcome sight  menu updated  Choose 2 entrees $20 added favorite choose 2 following soup salad sandwich  staff always friendly  <EOR> We seated promptly seen waiter quickly even visited management  why don't serve Thousand Island dressing???? <EOR> flew town Thursday because close airport  Only thing ate day food don't wrong food amazing ordered 2 20 ribs bourbon chicken shrimp cheese stick appetizer but both caught stomach virus afterwards  <EOR> Jerry Veterans Day knowing  specials day  beer free Jerry's dinner free  servers very happy wonderful  great time  Love Applebee's !!! <EOR> Came tonight late happy hour   Female blonde bartender threw fit because wanted sit bar   left never return! !! <EOR> It took bit seated but expected Monday night football night  needed quickly table order pay system really sped process  food great Blazin Texas burger   amazing!! nachos point also  Definitely try those two! <EOR> Would recommend particular Applebees anyone  family ordered food  cousin ordered pasta supposed come bread  forgot that  Finished pasta still no bread  Also appetizers chips salsa along some spinach dip  brought small plate knowing six us  going eat chips dip?

So used love Applebee's 90's early 2000's  Good food drinks  think back then all Applebee's Chillies Fridays  Wow down grade  menu limited mostly processed pre made foods    I walked lunch hour saw blonde girl she greeted said host right you  Hostess came another blonde but she glasses  Walker towards bar area asked if wanted sit bar said no  sat bright side Applebee's  bright sun blinded if sat normal shades pulled down  also made booth hot  took picture everyone seated complaining it    My server Christopher came right away  Btw hostess said Michael would server  hope Michael working  just plain rude learning servers names  Anyway he attentive nice  would say he great server  ordered iced tea lemon  When he returned he told Mondays cheese burgers half off  looked them again  really wanted regular burger  Didn't see ordered bacon burger added pickles  chose regular fries ordered pot stickers which came peanut sauce oil chili flakes called pot sticker sauce  Christopher asked if wanted pot stickers first  told lunch just bring ready first    He came back check said no rush but know when your lunch also iced tea go  BEST SERVER EVER!!!!

Staff always great but most all love location  Nowhere near busy area always seated right away coming just nothing but good experiences  Happy Hour awesome too  <EOR> There wasn't giant event made want eat again but instead collection smaller things bugged enough decide we'll spend money elsewhere    We arrived 7 pm Friday night place pretty full  layout weird weren't sure first if seat yourself whether should wait hostess appear  chose wait took uncomfortable amount time before hostess finally deigned seat us    When sat down table no silverware sticky  We'd watched hostess wipe down but weird residue rag left made uncomfortable all night    Our server swung table tell she'd right back take order but then she didn't come back really long time  When she did she seemed rushed asked food wanted without even offering drinks  corrected ordered drinks then soups appetizer    The french onion soup meh best  flavor off wasn't particularly hot cheese obviously low quality  When food came ask silverware napkins before finally them    The entrees definitely best part meal  boyfriend absolutely loved burger pasta okay  chicken top definitely best part    When bill came around $50 2 sodas two soups two entrees which surprised me  wasn't mistake but quality received kind expected less  When Chili's TGI Fridays order similar meals bigger portions higher quality food usually $40    So overall acceptable but definitely better  <EOR> My husband dinner Friday night 2 weeks ago exact even 2 minutes walked greeted very friendly host seated right away  server I believe name Ryan pretty awesome food excellent recommend 3 cheese macaroni 2 $25 entrees NOM NOM NOM! prices really reasonable especially amount food get  pay attention patrons definitely feel welcome there  Give place try if haven't already! <EOR> A couple friends going location couple years now  back due lack customer service  Last time Happy Hour bud light special $5 50 when inquired waitress she said discounted happy hour  then asked speak manager saw 10 minutes earlier  She said she did know where he left number  he could call back could ask changes  He yet call back  lost business  <EOR> I live Applebee's time time again family decide give second chance  However ultimately disappointed each time    The food starters tastes frozen food warmed again  order fish chips almost each time fish tastes pre frozen fish Walmart yuck! Even new menu food OK but still tastes bought store prepared chef  On busy nights impossible good service once entire meal without having drink refilled  staff often ok but if your servers attention then rarely service   I feel restaurant potential but just yet  Until then returning  <EOR> My family going apple bees years! Today best service gotten while  Even while dealing stubborn family next Javie came smile sure doing alright  appreciate it! Food dessert great! Hope server next time! <EOR> Unless bar getting drunk don't care you  lady's today couldn't even give refills  Service bad didn't even pick appetizer plates  Maybe next time come when Jeff john working treat everyone well  <EOR> Shame reading reviews before eating Applebee's     Met some friends lunch week   wise choice Applebee's off Warm Springs because closest restaurants friends work   started wise choice ended overall 3 star review   If read other reviews did probably guess issue was    right service amazingly slow   friend works buildings right next Applebees other friends works within 10 minutes   plan arrive then let them know once seating   just wish now ordered ahead time 45 minutes ahead time   ordered food 12 PM 12 35 PM nothing   waitress called over asked food   Viola!
