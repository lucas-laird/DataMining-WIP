Best thing they're open 24 7 hit gym around 1am new spot definitely hitting workouts   Yea know its bad diet but work even harder it   Service nice very clean environment  reading yelp other Roberto places arent nice one   Best thing mexicans making mexican food unlike another place where asians making mexican food other way around   Biggest fail Pho restaurant ran filipinos let tell Pho Phocking nasty! Keep menu within race thumbs up   Friends telling try Lengua well  Don't know but sure order next  <EOR> I replaced Robertos place    never order wrong food always point  Jessica best!! <EOR> Typical Mexican fast food chain   similar but seemingly more flavorful Robertos cousin   This kind food tastes 100x better late night inebriated lol   We ordered Carne Asada Tostada $3 80   Good flavor   HUGE portion lol   Al Pastor Torta $5 15   Surprisingly good considering rotisserie style pastor  bit dry end though but seasoning tasty   Chorizo Breakfast Burrito $3 80   Chorizo didn't seem fresh odd taste  Filled brim scrambled egg potato   Solid late night choice greasy drunk food P <EOR> We ordered few items to go evening very disappointed received  Hubby ordered chimichanga plate OK but great  beans salty rice dry but chimichanga tasty  also ordered three beef tacos chips cheese burrito  three chicken tacos chips no cheese burrito torn to hell tortilla fell apart when unwrapping it  used chips scoop burrito filling since didn't cheese wasn't total loss but paid for  all  <EOR> Looking some late night grub stumbled across taco shop chain Blue Diamond   employees seem little tired lifeless but expect 24 hour joint!  Regardless content meal great morning sleep   Out all items ordered least favorite   even though devoured whole thing   was taco de lengua   Tongue lacked some flavor wasn't tender enough  taco bigger in size cost used to      Their chicken taco crunchy shell lot better    with peppery taste loads cheese   Horchata just okay me   I better   But why complain when Mexican drinks bottomless other fountain drinks!?  My favorite Carne Asada nachos mountain flavorful asada cheese cilantro tomatoes guacamole beans we opted no sour cream    good and greasy ended ordering another mountain go     Up next    Carne Asada Fries! <EOR> We enchiladas  COLD  just cool actually COLD  Also building some very unfortunate waste management issues smells sewer  going back  <EOR> Well   I actually thought might actually 'loved tip stepped your customer service but turns just being ignorantly sarcastic    I again even worse costumer service first 20 30 times before  time counter person zombie just stared door while standing counter order  not matters obviously never step into your place awkward type business again   Keep GREAT WORK! <EOR> Started comparable Robertos but gotten gradually worse Super nachos barely any meat them!! I'd rather drive find Robertos  <EOR> Worst  Service  Ever    I usually frequent location taco Tuesday ALWAYS soft tacos 99 cents  decided bring family today could worst cashier  No greeting but instead hand gesture telling wait then she disappeared other things without even greeting  When ordering she rude outright insolent when SHE made mistake while taking order  left without ordering  Want good Mexican restaurant neighborhood? Choice gas station Rainbow  <EOR> Different name but still same still food  greasy salty those essential eats drunken night  Beef rolled tacos guacamole California burrito hits spot when head pounding stomach churning  right no eating healthy when might alcohol poisoning  Instead just give your gut another punch   With every purchase welcomed pack much salsa bar wish  end eating bag half spicy veggie mix  Although carrots lost crunch seasoning hot still nice accompaniment Mexican food  also prefer green salsa red  sure pick some radishes limes cut grease  <EOR> Food always fast fresh  Service great always friendly  Top places eat alone w fam <EOR> The worst service ever!!!!!! OK food  don't expect your food ready even if order pickup  only because close house  seriously considering driving mile further next Mexican fast food restaurant  <EOR> My family love place  tried many different things menu  say disappointed all  usually drive all way north side town some good Mexican food but definitely does fix  big plus close home  <EOR> Great food always fresh very clean  Love it!

Well idk if just location but breakfast burrito although good small $5  <EOR> Horrible Unclean rancid foul odors unkempt poor service  restaurant nearly empty cashier didn't even look say hello husband stood hungrily grinning counter  Needless say talked into driving road other location  unacceptable  <EOR> My second night row  Great food night if your craving greasy food  ultimate favorite Carne asada nachos  good food regret eating next morning very good reason hit gym next day   This spot clean staff friendly every time somehow meet new people guess customers friendly well  <EOR> Good food great customer service when ever come here  Close house convenient parking   place Mexican food <EOR> Unfortunately particular location horrible service food never good    yourself favor Don Tortaco literally less mile street  <EOR>
