Save your money chain restaurant  <EOR> Nice place off beaten path  Good food especially lunch  Judy best waitresses ever! stop again  <EOR> Overall food delicious come back   However when brought bread just toast   husband did bread thought mediocre   crab stuff mushrooms very good   dinner new York steak medium rare twice baked baked potato   the potato over salted steak medium but still delicious steak potato   husband rib eye baked potato    he mentioned good however baked potato 1 2 stick butter   What actually bothered most restaurant $$$ cheap   no dress code people coming shorts t shirts on  Takes away experience  Maybe wrong but if ate going steakhouse dress little    This reasons why gave 3 star's  <EOR> I love Mesquite wood grill  give meat distinctive flavor love   Of course prices cheap dress code surprisingly lax nice steakhouse but anymore most places seat regardless long money   This old Vegas ranch house style steak house relaxed atmosphere  few times before back  <EOR> Typical steakhouse menu dark atmosphere  Desire great but all   Chicken cordon bleu w twice baked 8 oz filet w ranch potatoes everything very salty much didn't eat more couple bites anything   looking forward garlic bread but just plain white bread toasted w garlic   Dinner 2 $100 didn't eat anything awesome! <EOR> We spent lot money so so food kind but horrible service   meaning trek across town years finally did special birthday 3 adults 2 kids  Seating took extra 30 minutes reservation time  simple order but brought wrong dish us  took back but then obviously rushed try correct dish fast possible therefore undercooked  Despite efforts rest finished eating time he meal which meant birthday guy eat undercooked steak while rest chatted kids pestered dessert   when noticed we'd never gotten soup salad  offered bring them post dinner declined but didn't offer take anything off check   Service aside food just great  plenty it  recommend ribeyes thin better grill diner noted she preferred ribeye Outback  filets prime rib other tables looked good  Maybe stick those  <EOR> Great king crab legs double baked potato  Good service  Nice old time decor  Good place celebrating  Love atmosphere  <EOR> I tried place first time definitely back  filet prime rib something special   flavor grilling technique some best   love whole dinner alacart  service alittle slow end but chef it   New favorite spot ambiance very cozy inviting  <EOR> Old school  Reminds OG ranch style steakhouses parents took kid Los Angeles  Very distinct sweet hickory smell fire pit walk building  Sat bar eat lunch rib eye  Perfectly cooked  Came salad steak fries  More enough portions  Best all and least expected service  Darla    Dar ling  Anticipated needs  Very helpful menu  Drink kept full  Super friendly  If northern reaches Las Vegas definitely recommend piece Vegas history  <EOR> We looking good steak found here  Filet mignon baked potato couldnt any better! ill back here! <EOR> Haven't 20 years  Nothing changed much thankfully   Nice big juicy steak loaded baked potato they're all very good! <EOR> Excellent food excellent service  Rachael best  ribs Cajun shrimp scampi excellent appetizers  garlic cheese bread came meal best  both ordered Grand Filet  16ozs both cooked perfectly great flavor  wanting years finally decided husbands birthday dinner   Definitely back definitely ask Rachael she working when do  <EOR> Every time come Las Vegas  always stop here  Food always excellent  favorite Steakhouse  <EOR> I don't think quite categorized staple but Bob Taylor's definitely history Las Vegas  Being born raised coming Ranch House far back remember  When younger mom stepdads favorite places steak  remember when used long waits lines door  But can't remember when exactly last just know good 15+ years   A few friends recently invited dinner when craving some good ole' American meat   When 5 walked Saturday night absolutely no wait  few tables sat inside while decor remained mostly unchanged remember place just doesn't seem Ranch House feel anymore  definitely starting show age which isn't necessarily bad thing but almost feels more chain restaurant now mini getaway city used too   After browsing menu bit decided special advertising bacon wrapped 8oz filet believe priced $35  Much regular menu items came soup salad potato choice  chose lobster bisque which wasn't great but according other reviewers likely lot better side salad  just didn't really much flavor no lobster it  best part dipping garlic cheese toast which own wasn't anything special either    Now type person doesn't believe eating steak anything past medium rare   and no shame give hard time doing so  But think when ordered filet medium rare just everyone else table ordered there's well done threw kitchen off little bit  All 4 steaks just off bit  Mine cooked much closer medium well done orders more medium rare  feel bad them since won't able taste anything way always disappointing when your steak isn't done right  Especially mine being over medium rare    Even though still think Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat especially price execution just isn't there  Alongside temperature issues steaks came béarnaise sauce pretty much ruined whole thing  easily thickest béarnaise sauce ever seen texture more dry paste squeezed pastry bag  no smoothness wasn't creamy really didn't taste all good  Scraping much off could helped bit but would entirely different experience if sauce wasn't begin with    There service doesn't much behind either  felt really rushed orders took while drink refills too  waitress okay but she wasn't very friendly didn't seem all interested waiting tables anymore night    Maybe nostalgia kicks little 3 star review just because place many times before kid  mentioned still don't think prices crazy high quality meat  But service kitchen execution resemble more Outback other chain  might back eventually but if anything last visit they've completely lost homey local feel decent steaks along Ranch House would all but memory  <EOR> Denny's quality Ruth's Chris prices    I never back even if free  2 stars only because could barely finish meal servers o k  decor hideous hasn't updated years presentation non existent food low quality completely lacked all flavor  Salmon obviously microwaved pretty rubbery   You'd better going Applebees Denny's IHOP ext  pay literally 1 5th price better food  <EOR> We live near but scared try based some less stellar reviews   But some friends tried recently decided give shot   Had reservations 5 45 promptly seated 5 40   server quick everything timely fashion    Except now think did cheese garlic bread supposed to    Hmmm  Calamari very average priced accordingly   Porterhouse very good wife's lamb   prime rib very good overall   smokey some reviews indicated   Son's scallop fettuccine  very large tasty     Overall enjoyed meals skipped desert paid 65 min   Total 4 people no drinks 1 app came 147 00 plus tip   Overall good choice steaks north side town Saturday night   really fact didn't head far home good casual eats      But would liked try cheesy
