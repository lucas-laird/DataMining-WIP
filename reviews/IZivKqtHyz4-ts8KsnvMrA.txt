The kung fu tea class black milk tea which tastes pretty average but try different store's classic teas it  liked tasted Taiwanese black milk tea more homemade taste it  boyfriend didn't really though he said tasted cinnamon but couldn't taste cinnamon  Would recommend!

many options service great  Don't intimidated ask server help  drinks customizable if prefer less sugar ice   I tried simple Bubble Black Tea less sugar  Boba itself very chewy soft perfect combo tea  great balance being bitter but also having black tea flavor   Parking pretty easy away strip private lot it  Prices decent quality get! definitely another trip if am ever area  also free topping Yelp check in! <EOR> Best boba tea LV  Great options excellent tea  Friendly staff always smiling  They've made couple mistakes have *way* many times lost count but fixed them spot  moved SF Bay Area which some best boba choices right them   Added bonus running martial arts movie clips help pass time while waiting  Always entertaining  Parking always tight but always find spot within few minutes even if side street   The only thing issue restaurant neighbors  Some them CLEAN corner center bit aromatic when hot Vegas baby!  We've tried several other places one  thank sweet waitress Hot Juicy Crayfish tip  She kidding! best  <EOR> I Kung Fu Tea before NorCal disappointed when came here    The tea pretty good but only drawback located plaza VERY limited parking  parked empty spot way back corner but am pretty sure actual spot  shop itself pretty small packed very quickly     I would suggest calling your order just out  <EOR> Having come SoCal surrounded boba everywhere disappointed most places around Vegas  But thankfully able come Kung Fu Tea Station which probably best city    Kung Fu's boba good  chewy overdone mushy many other places around here  drinks actually tea flavor them completely taken over flavor milk other sweeteners  also readily adjust your drink you  always less ice less sweet  pretty good balance   I really oolong milk tea white gourd green tea also known winter melon   But far haven't really come across any drinks haven't liked   It little busy weekends but also some small tables if wanna come study few outlets underneath your seat laptops  just come drink chat watch random Asian related shows TV like Charlie's Angel Jackie Chan movies etc    Tip less ice more drink! <EOR> Came across KFT while dining favorite curry place Vegas   guess its Taiwanese but where ever travel always seek local boba joint satisfy tea addiction mean really can't ask settle Starbucks tea right?

Yelp already  Well okay should ask what's popular great way them tell know popular because work all   White Gourd Tea  believe winter melon  Now never would oh eyo white gourd sounds good lemme try   No lol  I'd why?
