Seriously? wanted complain but wife tired told just let go   She more upset because favorites   flavor really great but portion meat dish HIGHLY disproportionate   should called dish ONION side Beef             RUDE!   Lastly ordered Chao Thai office long ago colleagues ordered Pepper Steak lunch special   Now EINSTEIN anything but correct if wrong when hear STEAK know BEEF right?? Well called asked why extra $1 00 beef option?  yes when order online ask if want chicken pork tofu beef extra $1   Here's problem this   First all dish PEPPER S T E A K   Meaning       beef already implied dish   why just charge $1 more        no actually give option charge $1 more dish SUPPOSED come with   big deal but when called inquired lady spoke said beef cost more  why dollar extra  Uhm didn't ask economic lecture Lady! She also said Nobody ever complained before  Again           WTF? Maybe no ever ordered online $1 extra option!! didn't want food spat just said fine just deliver it!   I would give them extra star if stop being DAMN CHEAP meat!!!!! Damn!!!!!   THE END  <EOR> The food amazing service fantastic! lady front friendly helpful! definitely come back  <EOR> Okay need update review because can't hate restaurant just because food spicy can't feel mouth afterwards  fact actually love Chao Thai going visiting more often think  other main reason Chao Thai over other options area Green Curry Fried Rice  never seen offered anywhere else guarantee alone worth try  all flavors green curry wrapped fried rice without all soupy mess  almost spices soaked rice dish hotter  level 4 out 5 making sweat but wasn't hot couldn't keep eating  also ordered tofu pad see ew chicken panang curry  Both good but tofu pad see ew bland pieces tofu larger bite  Honestly nothing else matters but green curry fried rice  Come anything else order just fine  Just watch your spicy levels  <EOR> This far favorite Thai restaurant!!!! yellow curry amazing seafood chicken duck best duck also comes veggies!

I pad Thai lunch  Basic know <EOR> We ordered many times very pleased food  However customer service terrible  work resolve any issues but excuses  charged $4 delivery fee last week today charged $5 delivery same office  asked why delivery fee disclosed menu course couldn't explain didn't offer refund either  asked determined different fee again reason acceptable did any sense  Just because food good    TERRIBLE customer service food just TERRIBLE!! don't recommend place all!! <EOR> The food ok very decent price  service horrible  walked lady yelled register go? entire restaurant kind turned looked way little embarrassing  convenient cheap but definitely fast service  take forever! <EOR> Great food great prices! Tried Singapore noodles glass noodles delicious! Chicken beef satay also great  Thai tea bit sweet but still good  <EOR> OMG AMAZING!!! love thai food but far best thai food had!!! ordered orange chicken shrimp fried rice  hard explain god was   the orange chicken cooked perfectly very light bready just right amount sauce  Sometimes chicken chewy sauce stuck  everything but that! pineapple friend rice shrimp chicken it  Once again light now heavy very satisfying  Even lemonade good sweet! sure come next time town <EOR> I am always looking good Thai place delivers house because fat picky lazy   I think found winner!  When evaluating Thai places use standard order Pad Thai Prik King some curry mostly red yellow panang if feeling frisky never duck always disappointment    Bottom line front its good great obviously cheap but flavorful   How Thai place screw Pad Thai?!  Try Weera you'll see FYI weera exact opposite place huge portions terrible flavor !  very good Pad Thai flavor slightly sweet tangy    perfect   Chicken pretty dry minimal but common thread all dishes   Prik King spicy flavor explosion your mouth   Even if don't green beans try it!  only problem Prik King lack fresh lime leaves   lime leaves give citrusy pop combats powerful red curry base   dried leaves use aren't very good substitute   However dish still delicious well composed   However finding meat hunting through red swamp deliciousness   I red curry time   Oh flavorful tasty!  Again generously meaty but spice level depth flavor spot on!  bamboo shoots weren't freshest   And appetizer fried wontons   Save your money!  penny sized meat mixture each dollar bill sized wonton   dipping sauce spot though   So moral story Chao Thai cut corners minimal meat and or fillings but flavors spot on!  lazy tolerate less filling fillings good taste delivery boy  <EOR> The real fruit smoothies made powder good soup kinda unusual but curry point salad yummy <EOR> Great food  Very good service amd very large portions  tea selections very tasty sweet  waitress polite nice  Very authentic delicious  <EOR> The food very tasty very authentic   would definitely come back   mango boba tea perfect!
