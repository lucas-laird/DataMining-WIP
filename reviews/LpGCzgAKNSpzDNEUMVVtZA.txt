Well Settebello amazing cheese less pizzas     The amount sauce pizza absolutely ridiculous way much bottom burned   awful would rather eaten Papa John's   other people ordered 'normal' pizzas them mentioned great thought was   The other thing pissed off ordered coffee   only serve Americano Espresso ordered Americano   tiny cup very average expensive NO refills   Ok does Italian joint serve just plain coffee?????  order coffee most random restaurants usually decent   I would back pricey   Save yourself disappointment Settebello!  Oh side note would selected '0' stars if option  <EOR> First trip Grimaldi's brick oven pizza  knew pizza place but other did know expect  Just name knew would because love oven baked crust  crunch thinness pure heaven  2 girlfriends old job  celebrating leaving company moving better things    Now when say am pizza fan mean don't pizza because tomato based sauce everyone smothers pizzas ruins taste  fell love pizza again when Italy 4 weeks  girlfriends vegetarian she eaten few times let pick lunch  ordered large pesto mozzarella ricotta cheese pepperoni half meat eaters  also ordered spinach salad red onions blue cheese crumbles sweet balsamic vinaigrette  way more then enough food three people some take home    The waitress very attentive  When drink glass half empty she would bring new one  She busy other guest but still managed table least 4 times hour lunch  think more enough times check your guests if u see doing well    I definitely again  Great service great atmosphere great company  best all GREAT PIZZA! <EOR> Definitely great place pizza! usually big having pizza all time but some reason coming place practically became place indulgence family  Many other reviewers probably already mentioned but where authentic New York style pizza won't lie one   If your first time though then two things First don't recommend getting more need and or getting to go unless you're going eat within next ten minutes  Although very delicious thin crusted pizza become more crunchy needed don't honestly great leftovers  eat only enough eat fast pizza very fantastic once warm anymore reheating sometimes taste worse  mean really but family agreed upon this   Second also don't recommend getting more three four toppings single pizza especially if going large you're ordering  bit picky sauce good helpful amount  Unless ask extra may bit dry your taste if you're me  also because pretty thin pizza many toppings probably result soggy heavy pizza you'll bring your plate  But again just matter opinion   Whenever come usually large pizza mushrooms onions most importantly Ricotta cheese  Occasionally consider sausage but usually only three toppings unless we're feeling generous serving meat  really recommend getting some Ricotta cheese pizza here absolutely delicious great creamy taste  love onions because adds little more flavor  sausage again when feel want more meat  But mushrooms mostly just though enjoy simple taste some mushroom slices pizza   All all great come experiment  stick same thing because enjoy give seem combination toppings know like   Oh!

They great iced tea salads all super  small salad enough 2 people but don't expect any Ranch   great patio outdoor dining heaters which great    My advice Dine pizza don't ever go   disappointed to go temp time home   even if right around corner  <EOR> Not lot good choices neighborhood suburb pizza Vegas but Grimaldi's fits bill    often stop lunch while town     We started meal Caesar salad   Fresh greens crunchy croutons tasty dressing   Nothing particularly special but overall decent salad whet your appetite    This particular visit decided try gluten free crust   Wasn't sure expect but wanted give try    Surprisingly good!   Crust crisp didn't leave full over engorged feeling eating carbs   sure ask pizza cooked crisp way slice actually pick eat your hands    Fresh mozzarella basil toppings chose  Simplistic   light way enjoy pizza     We finished meal Tiramisu   Good espresso flavor light cream taste   shared enjoyed dessert     Grimaldi's great place enjoy pizza date family   Lots menu options please all    Attentive service rustic atmosphere   Eating outside patio nice treat   We'll visit again next time Vegas! <EOR> First let say eaten location many times over years pizza always amazing!  service hit miss however  Tonight 5 25 18 apparently Graduation night many young people  arrived 9 pm waited front while super young looking hostess spoke woman line front barely audible voice ignored then took huge party maybe 12 guests back   Then she came back ignored again while she mumbled something other woman date took them seats  She finally came over quietly said something I'm sure but THINK she asking many were? then disappeared again  couple more minutes waitress came over asked if helped  She bright red hair very sweet  She's explained why hectic tonight etc   She arranged seated right near brick oven area young hostess finally returned menus  Once seated different waitress came over take orders  water came without lemon ordered salad came super quick but dressing side asked   chalked kitchen being busy didn't read order details   server very attentive food great  prepared give great tip $12 tax total $56 29   but then she did something many servers Vegas done almost erased all amazing service she provided  needed change bill should've $3 71 when she came back she cheated 71 cents    understand small amount but if think many times she may taken people's change without getting permission she may stealing extra $20+ people per shift!  point extra money she may making off little trick point nobody right keep money without permission!  said MANY servers done but only Vegas  hubby vowed reduce tip 50 100% when servers but conflicted because done such great job earlier plus intense conversation while dealing bill   She accidentally ended nearly $10 tip which feel way much someone assumes ok keep YOUR change  should given just $3 she gave change point ok steal your customers   TO SERVERS If lazy carry coin change your customers then cheat YOURSELF give customers option give difference back then some   If amazing server shouldn't problem    I'm stating server's name because don't want trouble but hope whole staff reads message gets out  And rude unclear hostess drinks appetizer coming incorrectly server cheating change once again continues string so so service Grimaldi's   reasons hit miss service gotten always same but seems consistent theme  <EOR> This place great! new favorite pizza!
