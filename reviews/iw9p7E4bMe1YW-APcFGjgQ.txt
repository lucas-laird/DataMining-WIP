No  Only deem 'important games' constitute happy hour prices   condescending remark waitress said she'd back  Then when ordered $1 vodka punch shots advertised waitress she came back said actually 2 $3  point we're all already pissed off ordered pizza  ordered three rounds 2 shots  She came back 2 rounds 2 shots hell attitude  decided bother different waitress cancel pizza order  am manager cafe would fire anyone treated nice customers she treated us  She treated somehow infringing evening  Don't here  <EOR> I walked bar finishing off delicious glazed donut man checking ids told needed finish donut outside before walked hurried shoved mouth chocked! call ambulance almost died! never come back again! <EOR> We used place when Roadrunner saloon thought would try new place  First thing hits when walk college type atmosphere  entire patio Astroturf where play games beer pong while drink  Although isn't really kind scene willing give food try since menu looked decent  menu pretty basic burgers wraps salads etc  Although if want steak salad ready fork over $18! ordered fried pickles big Texan burger chipotle chicken sliders  First negatives   the pickles burnt burger way salty both onions jalapeños fried no variety texture chicken sliders dry seasoned very well  positives    waitress great 250 different kinds beer  Bottom line if you're looking somewhere drink good variety beer college vibe probably place  If looking good meal   you should probably keep looking  <EOR> Love place!

If you've ever would compare mini Gold Spike Downtown  bar restaurant both inside outside  During winter few heaters outside  offer few games play such giant Jenga corn hole mini bowling pool even board games  There's lots tv's mainly inside some outside which great watching sports even play UFC other fights too! parking lot kind small compared huge crowd place brings expect park dirt most times  Huge beer selection! food ur basic American cuisine such burgers wings sandwiches etc  tried Cheesy Potato Skins actually really good ordered second plate lol  only thing would change place them more appetizer options  Just because lot people come mainly drink much full meal just kind wished more shareable options small playes  <EOR> This great bar restaurant such fun place watch sporting event hang friends    sit Mark Fine red room UNLV rebel games    love app all technology they've incorporated into business think PKWY awesome owner genius  <EOR> The bar lot fun simply because packed every night great clientele  But bar really nothing special  Carly Rae Jepsen played repeat bartenders kind lame  definitely back good time just wish better places area Vegas! <EOR> My motto having bad experience always don't knock until try twice!      My first time going PKWY Tavern appeared very dead weekday night  main bar staffed 3 4 bartenders crowd very small  Just any bar left tab open obvious convince  Oddly enough dead night someone exact same name me  end night close tab handed wrong bill credit card  advised bartender some mistaes bill some drinks tab vice versa didn't want charged incorrectly   three attempts everything sorted bartender appeared resolve situation brought back correct bill  When asked bartender previous two times card incorrectly  swiped due failure pay attention he assured charges wouldn't post would drop off reversed    Two days later check bank statement see charged tab along other guy night being assured wouldn't happen   work hospitality industry know mistakes happen didn't want big deal it  All though experience left extremely bitter decided give place second change   My second time going PKWY extremely crowded took forever drink  bar environment location    For those going PKWY first time plan long waits drinks pay cash avoid any hassles    If you're looking similar environment would recommend Gold Spike instead  <EOR> The service terrible! Walked stood host desk few minutes contacted any employees  Two employees patio area not far where standing smoking drinking alcohol  decided seat ourselves  Table sticky  Two waitresses walked did say word  only two other families dining area busy  Finally third waitress stopped  She brought menu's nastier then table! Mine sticky few pieces human hair stuck front  inside some yellow substance dried it  Looked nacho cheese  ready place order however waitress kept walking looking other way when she passed us  finally able place order  ordered Smoked prime rib wife ordered Mahi Mahi sandwich  took 30 minutes not exaggerating food  Mind dining area empty earlier mentioned  Furthermore view into kitchen burger sitting window waiting served approximately 15 minutes  Meanwhile group employees some whom appeared management continued drinking smoking patio  prime rib if call that extremely oily! never any meat smoked come oily    tasted processed meat  NASTY! Mahi Mahi extremely dry rubbery! ate glasses empty servers continued walk ignoring empty glasses  Most meals still plates when placed napkins plates  Indicating done  waitress came over assumed she would ask everything was  much  She grabbed plates asked check  She brought check right back  Fastest service all afternoon! Needless saw ever step foot back place  always packed night when drive decided give shot  definitely packed its food service! gave place star because zero stars option!!! <EOR> I continually try goto bar time time terrible service 9 times 10 patio awesome beer selection great if actually any beers listed   food awful just bad food   ordered chicken skewers 4 oz chicken hot sauce 14 dollars friend ordered chicken quesadilla which made pre packaged shredded chicken   concept great but seems half wait staff dis sheveled loooking terrible uniforms   seeing bar rescue! <EOR> This place always busy  If you're into beer pong your spot  really hate parking lot think should work that  hostesses friendly waitress nice but food mediocre  ordered chicken waffle sliders very dry chicken no flavor friend buffalo sliders those very bland too  fries good but fries anywhere  think back just drinks next time  <EOR> After initial visit returned several times PKWY  occasion made reservation party 8 patio Sunday evening upon arrival hostesses knew nothing reso  drinks took FOREVER night outdoor bar open sever 0 personality    My most recent visit PKWY definitely left sour  taste mouth denied entry into venue  group 20 people    Half party already inside half waiting rest party  2 people party took swig bottle liquor car when proceeded walk entrance security rudely shouted he would allowing any into bar because drinking parking lot  He then proceeded mutter some other rude comments group  understand rules rules perhaps he just doing job however no reason treat speak manner he did especially since he representative PKWY Tavern therefore customers patrons  thought also quite bit racist then ask every Asian person walking door if party    Wth   Anyways took party 20 Born Raised BAR Warmsprings Buffalo fabulous night!   I would avoid PKWY busy nights seems complete $h*t show security men going power hungry tirades    mention probably ruined tires having drive over rocks overflow parking lot  <EOR> Decided give try converted roadrunner  They've done great remodeling  Nice place kick back relax any number beers   Tried blackened salmon salad which little dry but otherwise delicious! kettle chips fantastic chicken fingers we tried BBQ flavor   surprised read bad reviews bad service  service great huge improvement terrible service when roadrunner!

couple pool tables which nice large amount crowds bring in  now speaking crowds place looks young crowd but very diverse group when went  When grab seat bar looked only seats available gaming chairs grabbed booth instead  Now know all bars aren't stocked supplies specialty drinks but just plain old regular bar Moscow Mule Goose ordered some food  Now food give 4 5 stars no complaints but definitely 5 star worthy  drinks give 2 lack better options next time definitely beer! little beer dispensers purchase your table which would awesome especially large groups people  wouldn't ever voluntarily come again but wouldn't mind coming grab quick beer  <EOR> 5 stars terrific bar food kickass music sick selection craft beers tap   The last time told bartender normally drink Saizons he introduced Sierra Nevada Raspberry Sundae Ale  Only thing drank all night   For food recommend giant pretzels beer cheese Barcuterie Plate  HUGE soft mealy inside clearly fresh oven  Easily best pretzel ever had   I also love spinach dip which comes incredible handmade pita chips  world   The venue pretty big bowling darts arcade games indoors huge outdoor area giant versions Jenga Cornhole etc   Fantastic spot chill night group friends some new ones  100% would come again!
