Bartender more worried he watching tv then taking care guests  Very rude unpleasant  would waist time place  <EOR> I'm sure why many hate place    There used location north Seattle but sadly shut down 'remodel' Alderwood Mall  Perhaps forced 'new' food court    So now location only frequent when flying through Vegas which seemed doing every quarter work     This 'highlights' trip getting airport earlier time a wait usually long line b enjoy burger  Yes service take while do fresh food food  waiting grill line? Also some awesome shakes  tried few times but never finish one    Bring your patience your cash place isn't super cheap burger but you're also airport  EVERYTHING spendy side  <EOR> Pretty poor Ruby's standards I used dine somewhat frequently Newport Beach location big fan   hamburger dry dull onion rings awful  glad didn't order shake  Tables squeezed together if carry on bags might want opt dine elsewhere   Curious note placard which list rules signed Ruby sort contract customer  top title reads help win war  war talking about? dirty little secret burger chain war going unbeknown myself American public? couldn't possibly talking war terror   if someone knows please educate ignorant self  <EOR> I mean take place context  airport  Which means away selling bottled water $3 79 forgettable but unpleasant cheeseburger fries $12 19    Picture it's12 30pm   lots time before flight really want filling breakfast meal because flying back East Coast haven't anything eat yet day  Ruby's offers something called Awesome Egg Sandwich  Awesome!

Then ran into friends eating burgers fries Burger King  realized BK probably much more economical option but when said said No cost $12  choice between burger meal quaint diner massive fast food joint felt made right decision  <EOR> So Burger good fries kind bland but really stood bad service  airport late hungry few places still open  really wouldn't complaining except indian I think? working wanted tell closed even though another male employee pushed come in then refused give water cup larger shot glass  most annoying asked 3 times larger cup last which times asked if manager would allow it  She vehemently insisted company policy would allow but low behold walking 3 tiny water cups manager saw predicament offered largest cup  would never back just because would want deal indian lady ever again  <EOR> So very unfortunate McCarran Airport such lackluster food options    Ruby's feel Johnny Rockets all fun cleanliness spirit beaten it  servers looked tired completely disinterested  place your order counter then given plastic number card place your table servers deliver your food  Sat down table dining companion said smelled puke  He right  moved     Ordered bacon burger side onion rings  NOTE only cook burgers well done = taste cooked burger  Onion rings only thing keeping being 1 star review  While greasier would liked rings hot well seasoned plentiful  $22 believe there's better option terminal 3 D   food took much longer 15 20 minutes arrive should have   Not sure when back Vegas but am sure won't returning Ruby's  <EOR> I normally don't rave airport restaurants but Ruby's Diner exception  cashier misheard order given wrong sandwich  expecting given hard time but instead way right  fact given complimentary bottle water wait  didn't catch names but cashier assume manager duty working 12 20 around 1 40pm great  Exceptional experience especially airport fare  grilled chicken sandwich also tasty  <EOR> I never heard place before but located McCarran Airport   theming very cool retro 1950's    before return flight home   ordered grilled cheese GOOD   sandwich itself parmesan cheese outside bread grilled cheese toasted melted delicious  Inside added slice tomato came fries which also very very good   The prices reasonable actually more reasonable considering Airport   The service very efficient friendly   It last meal Vegas surprisingly more satisfying some ones strip   So many bad reviews wonder if fluke but experience great  eat again  <EOR> There's absolutely nothing special experience whether lackluster burgers kitschy decor tries recall diner folklore yore  servers courteous enough but sad say place which isn't much step self service fast food joint they're also dressed dated attire pretty much irrelevant  Sort whole Ruby's concept itself   About only redeeming qualities outlet there's always room spread because never crowded centrally located within its terminal  <EOR> Turkey club side Cajun fries  Sandwich dry didn't enough bacon  even strip  fries much seasoning  tables dirty staff all standing around talking each other  Wednesday evening while waiting flight  <EOR> You're airport you're hungry you're craving some breakfast food  where go?
