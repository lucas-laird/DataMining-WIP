Now suggesting everyone head 350 mile ride burger and then turn right around head home but if find yourself Vegas anywhere else Freddy's set shop       definitely worth checking out    Next time gotta try frozen custard! <EOR> One worker partner baby fountain drink area  He touching kids snot then going back work  significant other wearing pj covered animal hair  thought gross  <EOR> Freddy's fries bomb! Would've never expected fast food joint boasting frozen custards such mean fry  Crispy outside soft inside all packed into little shoestring morsel happiness  signature fry sauce elevate next level definitely try spicy one!  Fries aside turtle concrete tad disappointing  way runny considered concrete  Received half melted time halfway through left soupy mess  Still pretty tasty though!

The red decor definitely stimulates appetite  modern yet classical feeling restaurant   Service Nothing complain about! The cashier answered all questions promptly gave few recommendations first time establishment   Food Disappointing The burger flavorful  very generic find burger  fries although fried nicely no flavor nor seasoning  house sauce fries did contribute much experience either  bad price quantity food however   Summary Good quick bite I weigh many restaurant reviews food  Unfortunately break chain food which personal feelings broke review  Nice place nice location however  Stop quick bite but nothing special  <EOR> This first time area decided stop try out   It wasn't crowded all must just lunch rush  The staff all friendly welcoming made feel special haven't great service fast food restaurant such long time  even came around check if everything ok   My wife tried jalapeño burger she requested no sauce afraid would dry but she said burger juicy  she loved it!  I double California burger   loved shredded lettuce burger know  something weird appreciate burger but shredded lettuce holds sauce better opinion also loved meat patties smashed   Also fact shoestring fries  gives life  All all happy made great choice look forward return <EOR> Had veggie burger pleasantly surprised much liked it  fries however am fan of   some stale if just mixed old fries new ones   might give place another shot but honestly many other places veggie burger  <EOR> I just ate Freddy's first time  always seen every time come Vegas  glad waited come location  Danielle took order  She AWESOME!

Please come Summerlin!! <EOR> Food decent but work present food your drive thru customers? Just throwing burger box small means slip slide become mess before first bite   Wrapping burger paper helps prevent becoming unmanageable dripping mess first bite  Others why can't you? <EOR> Every time come Freddy's am always thrilled staff greatest bunch young customer service stars town  could care serve warm helpful happy professional   But care food excellent burgers fries oh good onion rings amazing black bean burgers course frozen custard  The bean burger seasoned nicely great texture  great fresh onions sandwich  prefer order applesauce side versus fries healthy option  The staff always check bring extras may forgotten  I really support community schools other organizations fundraisers  Freddy's clean reasonably priced friendly while dozen times last year did review until today some reason  This go to meeting place when husband different parts town  Sit cheerful restaurant drive through  way hope becomes your favorite fast food place too  <EOR> The best thing place along food better other places passion genuinely care customer times acknowledged birthdays treat!
