Price great too! <EOR> El Pollo Loco any other fast food place hit miss depending day go  generally don't come unless send some those coupons mail  prices bit high without some savings always wait until some sort deal  chicken pretty damn good but would only pay coupon price lol  location gets 3 stars because extremely slow every time decided pay them visit  Today waited 15 minutes drive thru because cashier clueless  read coupon description she insisted under 500 calories entrée MEALS just salad  Now know read comprehend very well sure just salad  window she tries apply MEAL she adamant well think happened? Yep   wouldn't take because only valid salad  But didn't say    Never mind shall digress    Overall just okay Chicken Avocado salad anyways   Under 500 calories though may look into    <EOR> This location sucks took 45 minutes food drive through Guy taking order complete idiots losing business because very unorganized    <EOR> Don't know actual food tastes because store decided close 30 minutes early  because yelp page said close 11 only see everyone back cleaning already  slow but change hours then if  case  Instead just blank annoyed stare employees inside clearly saw coming 30 minutes before closing  No words other lazy come mind  <EOR> Poor experience  Cashier couldn't apply pay work though advertise accept using without issues other locations  <EOR> Every time come order wrong feel staff does pay attention customers saying  ordered shrimp tostada women drive through even confirmed shrimp tostada     gave chicken tostada  <EOR> Arrived 10 45 drive thru window 15 min before listed closing time  Employees inside completely ignored much amazement  Upon pulling forward window noticed hours posted dumbfounded employees staring us  Turns hours incorrectly listed yelp but employees inside could bothered microphone tell closed! <EOR> I may bit biased since work but fajita burritos quesadillas awesome great place work great people work with!
