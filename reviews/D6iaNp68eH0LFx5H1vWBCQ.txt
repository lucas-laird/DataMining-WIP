I line watching Mom child    Mom ordered 3 Meals   Happy point Watching Mom Keeping child touching hot metal    And Watching Employee Staying Attentive   Switched Person Giving Huge Portions    Why? <EOR> Go least 3 times week never bad experience until today  First all no brown rice even steamed fried  2 female workers very rude! hospitality Industry since 08 please coach them  <EOR> Had pick party tray all sudden gathering walked insanely busy Sunday night immediately greeted young man glasses asked party tray noodles  Quickly cook fresh batch  Paid 10 minutes  Great service place  <EOR> Horrible service every single time come food  But just love spicy eggplant tofu deal it  But always just don't it  tell made if order two orders which wait 10 mins it    and then fill other others while paid waited it  Manger worst attitude certain nights another young lady worst squeaky accent ever she talks she demanding order something     I finally decided move place    I just hope corporate re trains staff customer service  <EOR> Since panda express chain its all around everything same  service pretty good  very friendly restaurant clean <EOR> I don't know tiny Hispanic manager but am thrilled way he treats employees customers alike  Always pissy mood extremely condescending servers put back portions if happen excess  usually enjoy food service but lately mostly miss  always order online ahead time pick counter  always ask um want? Like? Rude much? guess  <EOR> So brown rice today  signs all over store say now brown rice when order none  cook laughing when he said would 30 minutes until ready  Bad customer service  <EOR> Last week came grab lunch Panda Express location   Let tell you    they exceeded expectations again     Before going line first bathroom  bathroom extremely clean smells super fresh   honestly say eat off floor   When off bathroom line gotten longer   employees extremely busy yet handled each customers professional manners without loosing composure   When turn employee greeted warmly asked if wanted fried rice chow mien   choosing fried rice she then asked two entrees wanted   chose Orange Chicken Walnut Shrimp   She kindly reminded extra premium entree gladly accepted it   While employee scooping Orange Chicken she asked if wanted some egg rolls soup   Though tempting them felt enough lunch declined   Finally once entire order fully gathered cashier she asked if would some condiments chili sauce soy sauce drink   She also kindly asked if would donate change so rounds nearest dollar happily agreed   Though mentioned nearly step step happened during visit Panda Express only took less 10 minutes time entered restaurant time left   visit only shows much better training Panda Express is   food extremely fresh flavorful   restaurant spotless   employees efficient friendly   end very few fast food chains compete Panda Express's freshness food quality service  <EOR> It's family tradition     say  But location fast clean friendly  kind attentive food allergies  didn't mind request smaller portions  Fresh fast food  Nice job  <EOR> Portion size decreased  Food doesn't taste same flooring off  Shrimp dry barley any sauce  Way way way many onions   Guess  seem food small portions  <EOR> Min best!!!! He always pleasant even when customers complete assholes! Love guy  far best panda employee im ever met  <EOR> Really say? standard Panda Express location found southeast corner Silverado Ranch Blvd Maryland Parkway    My strategy Panda try hit first hour opening if can  way food always fresh  If wait till later day seems though really rolling dice    I pepper chicken orange chicken just any shrimp offerings!  This location kept very clean always maintained appealing appearance   Service also crap shoot  gotten some nice friendly service times  flip side some employees become irrationally impatient rush myself and witnessed others through ordering process even when busy   All all its okay  stop once month so   3 stars  <EOR> This location stops serving food almost hour before closing run food cooked line! am displeased fact waited 9pm 9 30pm line honey walnut shrimp bowl did receive food! Stores closes 10pm!  When ordered food wasn't any honey walnut shrimp left explained lady working named Sarai eat meat only seafood  She offered tofu but told only waited line honey walnut shrimp  She said sorry don't any right now rejected half made bowl containing rice left! She did offer more food entire line no other options even someone does eat meat! Unsatisfied called speak store manager! Sarai same lady refused order answered stating she store manager left store credit name pick following day!   I appreciate gesture correct mistake but returning location! <EOR> I give Panda Express 4 stars because lomein noodles orange chicken 8 Treasure Chicken stir fry rice most delicious  portions large plentiful  wife MJ loves noodles egg rolls  Panda folks provide taste samples many different entres would ask for  if unsure order just ask samples ! <EOR> Been going Panda Silverado Ranch years  Lately food hasn't great  usually Orange Chicken  Last time when home tasted soy sauce  cook obviously cooked wrong sauce  horrible  son informed need always sample before ordering if sucks leave  don't always right   did again noticed cook same last always liked when he working cause he actually put sauce chicken  If enough sauce realize kick it   Well he didn't disappoint me  awesome!!! workers very nice professional  server quit rude but she last night made great experience time  <EOR> I definitely am big fan panda express chain just happens 2 closest 2 house  <EOR> Whole Staff ROCKS!!!

This PandaX recently renovated looks good   key issue any PandaX if keep food fresh last year location keeping fresh   remember while 2011 2012 slumped bit fresh department but way better now   My personal favorite sweet fire chicken good combo sweet spicy  <EOR> Food almost always good here  coming years now but  disappointed last few visits  Ordered Beijing beef according label but lately its ordering peppers onions two pieces beef  Same eggplant tofu  getting only tofu peppers  Asked server politely if she could add more eggplant but pleasantly ignored  Oh well only Panda guess  register lady needs smile more  Still overall good Panda ive way worse locations  <EOR> I reluctantly give 1 star particular store would prefer give zero star rating  Unfortunately Yelp does offer option rate restaurant other business below 1 star      Since husband workaholics often order food delivery walk in pickup  dinner to go  Tonight decided patron Panda Express Silverado Ranch Maryland parkway   Long story short called lo mein noodles worst ever had  noodles tasteless dry similar Top Ramen noodles might resemble if pan fried over cooked sat under heat lamp knows long   yeck!  The orange chicken wasn't much better tasteless cold time arrived home [ 2 minute drive]    On upside spring rolls adequate but decent spring rolls enough encourage repeat business opinion  <EOR> Pretty much any other Panda Express would give 3 star rating but second time row food stale   coating orange chicken turned into some sort crystallized membrane   I also witnessed them mixing old batch food new tray   serious health code violation   At 9 bucks noodles two entrees soda almost better all eat chinese buffet around same price   When ordering never include utensils   really sucks when come home realize don't fork  <EOR> Food great always any Panda Express EXCEPT fried rice  tasted if cooked white rice didn't let dry cool down before fried it  basically tastes if rushed because still grainy NO taste whatsoever  girl rang register kinda lightweight threw receipt rushing next person line  And always never put any spoons spend extra time asking it  <EOR> Great food great service recommend orange chicken However sometimes see staff translate English well sure ellaborate your order is <EOR> hi Alejandra thanks reply concern  would awesome but iam unable send dm  if send dm then reply  appreciate thanks letting upper management know issue  thanks again hope hear soon! <EOR> The management service location horrible  wait ridiculously long end waiting line forever even your food ready go  line filling only register open  <EOR> Panda good quick food  don't know if considered Chinese food  more americanized Chinese food  every now then  eaten location twice month so  clean quick food good  <EOR> This used place when didn't know would dinner  wife going once every two three weeks  Good food good service  ANY MORE  food portions now smaller prices help must overworked because unfriendly  Don't waste your time here  many other places to  <EOR> It ok    friendly other locations  Fresh food instead dried chicken shrimp thats plus    panda nothing special    <EOR> I love panda! faves!
