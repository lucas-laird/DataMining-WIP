Rarely feel dining establishment's food deserves 5 stars but based all experiences consistently mind blowing   that being said explain 4 star rating below   I 2 friends town being huge Rick Moonen fan meaning return chose spend dining adventures here   visit consisted following APPS Moon 'n' Doggie $15 white shrimp red cabbage slaw chipotle toga chips looking them you'd think brats pieces toast used bun   Tasting them though very unique!  All blended together very well    the taste shrimp like sausage slaw good together only ate few bites w the bun finished rest alone! Futo Fireball Roll $19 king crab avocado cucumber spicy char tobiko kabayaki wasabi citrus aioli could ordered dinner alone!  Filling taste freakin' great   sushi snob being good book means probably hella amazing! Although usually bread basket did try few pieces breads great taste texture dry somewhat light   Unfortunately being few months ago can't remember exactly kind was   ENTREES Branzino $34 winter veggie ragu romesco sauce entree   originially between Arctic Char Hake but w upon server's suggestion   AHHH am glad did!  Branzino usually isn't 1st fish jump menu but done perfectly much more flavor I'd ever type fish   Strangely enough highlight dish though veggie ragu!  cannot remember exactly consisted but am huge veggie fan done perfectly I hate when cooked veggies undercooked romesco sauce never before   combination fish veggies melded perfectly together made hard eat almost entire entree! RM Style Cioppino $36 calamari mussels clams king crab shrimp FOD Still sure FOD means but even cares   this OMG!  dish amazing didn't think could any better but then tried her's almost could stop eating also!  All seafood tasted very fresh very generous portion placed atop bed pasta cooked perfectly pulled together w a thich tomato broth might add great tomatoey flavor w a slight kick    WHEN 'if' back getting this   a side note portion darn big apps think 2 3 people could split  Alaskan King Crab $32 1 2 lb  steamed chilled he them steamed + 3 added Taylor Bay Scallops $3 50 ea  didn't try entree   he added scallops upon recommendation based 1st full dinner experience @ RM best scallops ever until scallop app recently @ Scarpetta which pretty much tied top list    He absolutely heaven he pretty much trance while eating barely looked up   few points knew he still conscious because heard  small rumblings mmmm  wowww  God    Lol   SIDE Moonen's Mash $7 capers scallions black pepper red onion suggested side bad!  knew everything going delicious but didn't realize would good we'd pretty much lick plates clean   I usually don't pick mashed potatoes restaurants because many times end being disappointed   just seems they're often tasting fake quick mix flakes REAL homemade taters   also spoiled until moved Vegas grandma's homemade mashed taters which carry secret recipe day she's Polish nothing touch grandma's home cookin'!    BUT REALLY good!!!!  Light creamy buttery could definitely tell real   nice onion flavor accompanied garnish capers red onion scallions when eaten w the taters exploded flavor   Wow am really raving mashed potatoes?

Hubby mac n cheese side which very delicious   For main days special which shelled crab lobster over orzo I think   incredibly delicious I should hope $70 which only reason gave restaurant 3 stars    I am sure would ever back pricey nothing write home about  <EOR> My boyfriend search good seafood place when vegas   saw rm thought would worth shot    When server told rm best place sushi seafood skeptical   Could blame us? mean vegas    everyone claims best    Furthermore boyfriend seafood fanatic hard impress     surprisingly rm Seafood did let down   pretty much ordered everything menu     three different sushi rolls medium seafood platter lobster oysters seafood salad prawns Salmon Nigiri Salmon Tuna sashimi crab cake shrimp risotto   Incredibly almost everything tasty     crab cake small price   impressed sauce cake itself might needed little more seasoning   The server very attentive back staff definitely game   might because came couple hours before closing ours only table    nonetheless    happy   They awesome beer selection   watching movie Beer Wars bf grown appreciate restaurants offer craft beers micro breweries    huge selection    <EOR> What let down!  would recommend place worst enemy   First foremost service some worst ever had   waited everything whether bar kitchen sushi bar     None waiters knew ordered plate     None them pointed which oysters which which sushi what     When asked timing some things snotty unapologetic   Whatever ate mediocre   only thing enjoyed oysters but ate those early evening only thing left bad taste mouth   DON'T HERE  <EOR> Amazing!  I live Napa CA standards pretty high restaurant met them spades   We Sunday lunch when Football specials which nice  two sushi rolls amazing half price   The clam chowder competes some best elsewhere  Same mussles delish broth  would recommend springing extra $5 extra garlic bread every ounce broth   Beers hot 2 bucks which definitely plus lunch   Definitely your Vegas stops  <EOR> okay it  im most cultured fancy schmancy food  dishes cost painful $50 portion size eyeball  nor am familiar meal consisting courses  not just appetizer entree  ive terrible experience momofuku ko but least liked half plates as mysterious randomly shoved together were   but pretty upsetting when hated just every dish brought restaurant  considering its located most popular hotels Vegas  first course some sort miniature raw oyster   keyword RAW three letter word archnemesis es   didnt even want look it  willing move past next course chose fiji apple salad  but really literally three slices apple some balsamic vinigarette some crappy inedible baby lettuce shreds thrown top it  again im forgiving im ready try entree  ordered some seafood pasta when finally came looked appealing admit  dove into it   and sadly discovered pasta just al dente which hate pasta soft  it completely undercooked point where couldnt even chew it  shrimp didnt taste fresh nor did two three mussels clams threw into mix  some mystery fish but really just made dish worse could salmon   icing cake ice cream tasting game   4 ant sized scoops unlabeled ice cream  one peanut GROSS some citrus sorbet other vanilla last green tea  ALL sad excuses ice cream genuinely would rather preferred haagen daz over this  fact should suggest change ice cream manufacturer provider edy's maybe  regardless all CRAP  craptacular ridiculously overpriced overrated seafood restaurant you're better off something say along lines long johns silver  upsetting  <EOR> I odd experience here     Nothing bad   But really hurts when expect extraordinary meal falls way short   The best thing oysters which fresh delicious   Particularly West Coast ones   exorbitantly priced piece but if order one of each assortment pretty reasonable price considering Vegas land locked   The Rhode Island style calamari great first lightly battered lightly fried cooked perfectly   But no punch it   some hot some sweet peppers but enough really add anything really didn't come close measuring expectations  almost tempered appeal timid palates   Also minute 2 soggy think because sitting bunch sauce which sucked bogged down   very strange almost instant transformation good dish average one   The appetizer portion big enough 3 4 people share   Next ordered sturgeon   When arrived runner said here's your halibut  waiter quickly rushed over said used prep halibut switched sturgeon   Pardon pun but very fishy  And did taste more halibut sturgeon  sauce fish FANTASTIC   the best part meal next oysters   I should also say reservationist unbelievably helpful accommodating which isn't always case Vegas although noticed change better overall trip maybe economic downturn meant upturn customer service  <EOR> Horrible   Never before charged $6 olives martini   If already paying $21 martini olives should included  Overpriced mediocre food  somewhere else seafood  'Nuff said  <EOR> Our third Restaurant Week 2010 meal RM Seafood  7 o'clock reservations  restaurant used set two levels lower casual upper fine dining  Once economy turned restaurant could only support lower casual level apparently still way upper level closed visit  seated between family two young boys two nicely dressed ladies rest dining room just varied  far more families would expect  sat patio boys playing main restaurant huge distraction    Anyway onto meal     We came  Restaurant Week menu but also prix fixe menu $55  husband opted could sample wider variety   We started crab california roll clam chowder  sushi dry be  pleasant  come conclusion fan clam chowder if didn't love SF doubt love anywhere   version decent but some clams chewy inedible    Usually started bread basket but ours didn't table until mid way through appetizers  wasn't particularly fond biscuits cornbread but latter better   Moving entrees he RM's version Cioppino  thin broth pasta undercooked seafood all overcooked  successful dish any account  diver sea scallops sweet sour eggplant topped crispy soben noodles  scallops little chewier I'd but otherwise fine dish  just wasn't preferred preparation   Things interesting once dessert rolled around  strawberry cream puff terrible  Quite possibly driest ever pass lips couldn't eat it  picked strawberries enjoyed sorbet  Frank Fat Elvis which warm chocolate bacon banana spring rolls  tasty surprisingly gooey chocolate smoked bacon well together  tasty sweet salty bite   Service acceptable few mishaps terms timing missing utensils but troubles quickly corrected   I wanted love RM Seafood but experience pretty dismal  only highlight Fat Elvis dessert  <EOR> OMG!  place amazing   only appetizers but food delicious best part all organic   service excellent atmosphere fun   If time right watch Top Chef same time     My only disappointment dessert   nut allergies only two desserts could 16 different flavor ice cream chocolate pudding   chocolate pudding   it wasn't anything exceptional but did brownie bites marshmallows  <EOR> I disappointed again  third time eating rm seafood but first time eating upstairs off pricier menu  Everything amazing service wonderful  All add ons expensive weren't told price perhaps would tacky ask? little surprised when bill came but worth every penny   Chef Rick adheres Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch guide nice able order anything off menu worry whether sustainable  dreams food currently salivating over pasta black truffle oil    If only lived closer Las Vegas cheaper     <EOR> Visited RM Seafood pre fix lunch menu    Everything delicious  butternut squash soup perfectly cooked mahi mahi fish tacos  Nothing seemed mind blowing innovative  Nothing challenges top chef  But everything good food done well    The $15 cocktails also surprisingly worth well balanced flavorful interesting  could drink dark stormy all day or least until passed out   like two hours     Our server mind bendingly incompetent spilled water didn't know ingredients 5 signature cocktails somehow seemed uncomfortable even though pre fix menu pretty much easiest new location little weird kind restaurant but food really shone  would definitely come back here  <EOR> We great meal  Service wonderful waitress very helpful attentive  Food tasty creative  lot dishes spicy element them which love  Favorite dishes Crispy Shishito Peppers Charred

First lets start beginning walking prime time Sunday sitting straight down bar real nice full service bar     Started off selection fresh oysters they vary types change you   say impressed watching cold order chef job shuck them no particulate residue SMELL each you no idea often places don't that   Needless say fantastic seconds had!  The salad unnecessary I ordered it forgettable     The swordfish might well best cooked pieces fish ever had  Fantastic texture no 'gamey' flavor nothing strong like all other swordfish   RM fantastic dish thank you   Overall say believe hype RM Seafood great restaurant break bank! <EOR> Right heart Mandalay Bay    Great atmosphere  Excellent service    Party three work colleagues  ordered three sushi rolls spicy tuna rainbow roll tempura crab  All expertly prepared outstanding presentation    The spicy Edamame awesome    We finished perfect fried calamari light chipotle mayo   Excellent    Great experience  <EOR> I'm split between 3 4 star place    Food 4 5 stars! Cost 2 stars     Ambiance 4 stars Service 3 5 stars  The clam chowder delicious salmon wasn't favorite but good  Lobster mashed potatoes AWESOME  friends literally put mouth savor it  would pause middle talking because pretty darn good  Nutella Creme Brulee   DIVINE! It tasted melted Ferrero Rocher chocolates! definitely savored dessert    The service quick cups always full  most part everything good  Portions good  thoroughly impressed  thought $50 good deal    Until bill  friend decided split side Lobster mash  both saw RM Mashed Potato side which said $11  impressed size considering thought portions would small  Boy shocked when told mashed potato $28!   Now restaurant wasn't normal place dine but also aware everything would bit more pricey  But honestly $28 mashed potato? If big chunks lobsters maybe we'd justify little better  But I'd compare amount lobsters amount clams clam chowder soup! Really? When looked menu again couldn't specifically find LOBSTER mashed potato  told RM mashed potato plain mashed potato  beyond disbelief  decided big deal but happy say least    So  3 stars most likely final decision  price mashed potato    <EOR> What heck hype about?  came business dinner  bad move  damn loud  there's some sort bar upstairs bad cover band playing couldn't hear word person across table   fault leaving moving immediately but impression they're trying convey classy seafood restaurant damn band upstairs just blows it   I warned greed upselling wait staff here  Sad say all true  sure waiter's fault but management decision  snotty prick started platter appetizers recommended are  course they're recommended market price   he's shilling wine recommending most expensive crap way overpriced menu   So order course want scallops ? mentioning 20 extra bucks they're going stick with   Food comes ask twice things when screw bring extra side jackwagon tries take back  No way brother problem   Food borderline  scallops 3 40 bucks came shrimp tasted weird dried out  others cioppino said passable but again way overpriced   The sides very good  Green beans fresh crisp Brussels sprouts very good mac cheese odd but tasty   Wine overpriced but any more any other Vegas clip joint   So bill comes already added 20% gratuity party 7  WTF? Then waiter adds added space additional gratuity much appreciated   No way pal   I really don't mind spending real money dinner Las Vegas kind expect it  $ 1000 dinners customers just part game but just felt rip off  <EOR> Have eaten twice couple years apart  ordered cioppino both times  Truly delicious flavorful broth good shellfish pasta fish  Only downside garlic bread served it  would preferred crustier bread dish  return next time Vegas most likely order cioppino again but arrive little hungrier try appetizers  <EOR> Oysters sashimi excellent   Calamari perfect   Scallops dish pedestrian but overall good experience  <EOR> I've since review RM Seafood Met Owner Rick Moonen Sammy Hagar Concert D Casino let tell you   He stand guy defiantly Genuine article   am glad nice time your Wife Rick Sammy Hagar Concert thanks taking time your line come shake hand meet me   computer tech walking Grounds   stand guy!!!!! <EOR> RM Seafood truly wonderful dining experience!!  place expensive sure but worth every delicious penny!

And although warned friends eat heavy before nighttime festivities caved ordered Diver Scallops served angel hair pasta lemon caper sauce   definitely rich creamy side but delicious nevertheless   mention some biggest scallops ever seen life!  For dessert shared red velvet whoopie pies   never wrong red velvet   ***  Food wise = 4 stars  Service? 2 stars   Something night off most likely because 1 two Southern men sitting next kept gawking friend's legs whole night 2 service   Our waiter kinda funny but awkward   addition he brought bill early because supposedly another waiter told asked which did not    result hard feel rushed uncomfortable   More charisma waiter might made birthday dinner feel bit warmer enjoyable  <EOR> Delicious!! Absolutely fantastic food  entire menu enticing relied waiter suggestions he did steer wrong  Specifically crab cake Rice Krispies twist spicy tuna sushi cucumber salad crab huge hits us  Everything fresh excellent presentation  Some best food Las Vegas offer! Quiet atmosphere well which hard find  <EOR> We big fans Oceana NYC when Chef Moonen owned it  decided enjoy wonderful seafood Vegas  Made reservation upstairs dining room  Arrived reception podium blatantly ignored unreasonable amount time others ignored also  Then mumbled assumed follow mumbler seater  weren't heading upstairs    stopped mid restaurant finally seater turned around could ask upstairs reservation  then told upstairs being remodeled restaurant wad changing more casual environment both floors  asked see menu told I'd sit able waiter bring menu  Huh!!! Why did reservation system ask specify which dining experience wanted? Maybe if hadn't planned nice dinner gotten such uncaring customer service would tried food  But left Wolfgang Puck's Lupo fantastic meal   This upstairs restaurant now relaunched new concept  <EOR> We chose RM special Valentine's Day celebration very disappointed  Instead talking sweet nothings dinner spent hour talking bad experience was  waiter did mention price surf surf SURPRISED charged $140 $85 yes but $140 NO! waiter barely spoke except complain allergies  seeted until 30 minutes reservation  bill $360 but experience worth more $100  definitely returning   Later edit the managment cares enough bad night  back give them another try! <EOR> This second time RM Seafood but first downstairs more casual spot  experience upstairs no desire come again but wife wanted give another try changed opinion better  kid didn't seem mind  course sat patio hallway overlooking escalators Mandalay Place but understandable  inside looked quiet anyway   There's no kid menu but happy plain grilled chicken breast son  He deemed best chicken he's ever had  $17 kid sized portion better be   Our food excellent all around  half dozen Kumumoto oysters $23 meaty mild delicious  wife's order steak tartare $21 ringo roll $24 spicy tuna apple jalapeños tuna cobia spicy garlic ponzu kabayaki sauce nearly flawless albeit expensive even Strip  black cod $32 bok choy candied kumquats best pieces fish its flaky fresh meat cracker like crispy skin delectable sauce  Even cornbread crackers bread basket great  cornbread way came handy soaking sauce dish   I'd happy recommend place now  But bring fat wallet because cheap  Some might even complain portion sizes which lean towards smaller size but wasn't looking stuff face silly night  <EOR> We came RM Seafood prior Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil show  heard really good things seafood  Everyone right   we loved food service  David server knowledgable specials new items menu wine list too  experience could better! <EOR> Came dinner when stayed Mandalay Bay  While restaurant's name suggests its great seafood restaurant ahead ordered ribeye  surprisingly VERY good  Very juicy tender cooked perfectly order  Would definitely recommend dish   The service pretty good though waiters seem bit overly positive each menu item I think heard best Nevada  amazing etc  multiple times     Other things good capoianni sp? mashed potatoes biscuits corn bread  calamari standard don't believe waters' hype  <EOR> Rick Moonen fun watch Top Chef Masters treat dine Vegas establishment RM Seafood Mandalay Bay   thing liked its location wasn't inside casino and therefore natural light! but located corridor between attached mall casino   sat patio It literally outside restaurant but indoors   confusing? Yes but w it   came quick lighter lunch Sunday   Let's what's important food!  may think seafood run mill fish raw bar etc that thinking but contrary very creative modern takes classics   started Crab Cake practically 100% lump crab  Hardly any filler things keep together  Very moist beautiful golden char  little carrot salad side pickley crunchy! Delicious starter!  Hubs ordered Fish Chips ordered Lobster Rolls    Me Fish Chips? does mean? assumed run mill battered white fish fries side  SURPRISE NO SUCH THING!!!!   It beautiful presentation turbot crusted potato chips fried golden brown!  did double take couldn't believe ordered!  truly creative take Fish Chips!  lobster roll also did disappoint  lobster lightly dressed mayo could taste freshness natural taste Maine lobster   order two rolls certainly best lobster roll and some tasty ones Boston    For dessert ordered Decadent Chocolate chocolate brioche bread pudding chocolate raspberry mousse chocolate ice cream true Chocolate Lovers delight Hubs loved it   I am really fan chocolate    Licked bowl clean!  Overall really great meal satisfying didn't leave uncomfortably full   Other Yelpers mentioned staff attentive knowledgeable which also same dining experience  Note downstairs less expensive upstairs dining  Lunch only served downstairs  <EOR> Every time friend comes into town take them here   They MOST FUN THING EVER   ITS ICE CREAM CHALLANGE  It's sounds scary no don't eat twenty two pounds ice cream three minutes beaten gang old ladies rascals Instead 16 tiny scoops ice creams sorbets identify flavors   And everyone brought thought don't even want ice cream now this! And ALL did ended being competitive into added benefit told jab  Woohoo! The flavors seasonal change everyday never boring  My record 12 correct guesses determined win before die   The reason low stars because last time and always when busy way before dinner way waitress incredibly rude she kept pointing busy she we didn't ask anything except ice cream    Part fun challenge give blank map fill when your done your server reads then teacher your science quiz  On time she just tossed answer key onto table started walk away finally said something  said done six times server always reads answers again she listed busy she couldn't bothered  ONLY PEOPLE SECTION ONLY SIX OTHER PEOPLE ENTIRE RESTAURANT   Plus watching she wasn't actually doing anything except talking bartender   I still back because must win but think would even win because really fun  flavors quite unique too  Word street less ten people won  I MUST WIN  <EOR> I don't even know where begin review  entire meal far best ever life   Here ordered Appetizers Crab Cake  Entrees 9 oz  Beef Filet Futo Fireball Roll  Dessert Peanut Butter S'More Graham Cracker Ice Cream  Everything fantastic include Sushi which recommended waiter  He dead perfect mix spice fire  sushi great but definitely think dessert favorite  cake chocolate base peanut butter pudding toasted marshmallow top  side came crush graham crackers graham cracker ice cream top along toasted mini marshmallows  incredible dessert never though anybody could image but am sure glad someone RM Seafood did    Service fantastic bill even better since restaurant com gift certificate  <EOR> Took group clients when town recently  before good meal fair price  time fast talking waiter ran bill $200 person constantly suggesting items menu  He upgraded everything  wanted order few sushi rolls he suggested sushi platter  worked $300 6 people when rolls all less $20  way over charged  He suggested adding steak which $95 ribeye  When clients can't ask much everything is   When bill came absolutely shocked  never eat again recommend anyone   manager little help resolving bill beyond admitting unfairly charged sushi he dropped price little  When cheat customers should more them  <EOR> Tastes presentation lacking  Hostess 2 braincells is  Why she sat couple date next 3 drunk businessmen empty restaurant baffled me  Lesson learned speak if your hostess stoopid   The servers eager push drink drink drink some more  only imagine help tip generous faded spirit  It's shame service doesn't mesure menu  <EOR> I LOVE LOVE LOVE seafood love Rick Moonen  pleasure meeting Napa when he doing food demonstration Michael Chiarello Napa Style  both really down earth chefs Rick Moonen definitely loves knows food    We hoping he going restaurant but missed day  He flew NY day there  But meal still blew away without Chef Moonen's presence although would icing cake We five course meal three course meal shared all courses  service really impeccable server just ok but everyone else top notch     First started salad burrata braised tomato vinagrette lobster tail squash blossom tempura  OMG holy cow  burrata light melted your mouth  sweetness acidity tomato vinagrette helped cut through creaminess burrata  squash blossom tempura surprisingly super crunchy added wonderful textural component  if wasn't enough tender piece lobster tail sitting middle plate waiting devoured  Very good portion  Exquisite    Sweet Corn Soup Fresh Blue Crab soup captured very essence sweet corn  light but touch cream it  liked flavor lot soup overpowering mute flavor sweet crab  portion smaller but thought just right amount because could see flavor getting bit monotonous if consumed much  All all very good soup   Rick Moonen's Clam chowder am lactose intolerant but soup addicting hearty  wish could more few bites because delicious  soup smoky flavor bacon ham hock  generous amount clams you know freshly shucked fresh potatoes your typical mirepoix   Again very hearty all all very good soup  Also really good portion    Seared scallop hot sour sauce over seared eggplant scallop nice sear both sides presented over seared eggplant  all things seperately but thought sauce although delicious overpowered sweetness scallop  However sauce perfectly eggplant actually favorite part dish    Ciopinno solid ciopinno fresh seafood al dente pasta served garlic bread  ciopinno crab mussels clams shrimp fresh fish  little spice ciopinno but definitely legit    9 oz filet whipped potatoes red wine reduction Good cut meat legit potatoes wine reduction good accompaniment  only complaint overcooked filet just little but assuming  just its prepared chef because never specified wanted filet cooked    Rocky Road chocolate pudding homemade marshmallows candied peanuts vanilla ice cream brownie bits drizzle passion fruit syrup  sounds weird but  all worked together  saltiness crunch peanuts worked well all other sweet components tot he dish liked it    Fat Elvis Fried spring rolls banana peanutbutter chocolate filling then rolled cinnamon sugar passion fruit dipping sauce  sounds weird but actually pretty good  hate bananas take banana out  ooey gooey same time crunchy wrapper  especially liked passionfruit    All all

We started Prosecco glass which delicious ice cold   Then came Caesar Salad   presented whole leaf style some shaved aged parmesan top   dressing perfect obviously freshly made just right mix tangy garlicky tinge anchovy good ness   much dressing amazing chewy garlic breadsticks croutons   MMMMM! As side note Caesar Salad Craftsteak night before couldn't hold candle RM version! Next came lump crab cake jicama slaw order California Rolls happy hour special menu   Both excellent   Although crab cakes very difficult exotic menu item some REALLY bad ones Vegas even good restaurants   crab moist fresh tasting plentiful  flavor classic but chili sauce underneath spicy gave little kick blended great crunchy sweetness jicama  Could little hotter middle but overall loved it   California Rolls some best lots crab best tasting avocado   Again very exotic but obviously top notch   Prosecco glasses kept full basket warm cornbread biscuits whipped butter very very happy!   Somewhere middle meal decided change Vodka Gimlets   drink hands down best mixed drink Vegas!  If enjoy hand crafted fresh cocktails don't miss bar!  waiter told bartender placed high some huge contest but into food drinks can't quite remember contest was    but drinks phenomenal attest to!

Thanks Rick    You rocked one! <EOR> Came lunch large group  select prix fix menu because group size  Starter picked clam chowder since server sold hard  Salty lacking seafood taste only ok  scallops papaya salad main  Scallops excellently prepared but 2 scallops seems little cheap  Papaya salad ordinary Western taste lacking fish sauce all famous balak  wanted place since Rick great chef he still comes often works unlike many other famous restaurants Vegas chef never comes but because price fix menu would never ordered did  But really famous clam chowder should RM Seafood known for   I look forward coming back own dinner ranking place much higher   Oh forgot add sushi shared platter first course outstanding  sushi incredible good any high end Japanese sushi place  <EOR> SLOW HELL SICK     Though mid week seated 7pm kitchen service terrible   placing order waited over 45 minutes soups salads   main courses followed 30 minutes later  Though waiter kept checking kitchen he could food delivered timely manner   The waiter promised manager would come over speak but he never showed face   WOULDN'T EITHER   manager obviously monitoring kitchen staff delivery times that's restaurant managers supposed do!    waiter did treat everyone party glass house red wine WOO HOO big deal !  I clam chowder starter course   soup tasty filling  For main course clams linguini   pasta swimming olive oil butter   WAY MUCH SAUCE   Some french bread mop would nice!  No came over offer parmesan cheese any pasta dishes   The serving sizes sufficient decent value HOWEVER beginning 2 hours later spent entire night bathroom stomach cramps diarrhea   Not pleasant visit   The waiter tried speed things but kitchen staff jerks even though place EMPTY!  It slid downhill visit few years ago  <EOR> I believe place over hyped  built expectations way high therefore came little disappointed    We bought coupons 33% off didnt know only applied small section menu ending didnt really even use coupon paid full price   It pricey which anticipated  food however lacking  small portions nothing seemed wow us  gave place 3 stars because didn't think bad  but friends came trashed down place    I surf turf roll 6 small pieces insides good but seared tuna top not   Never eat seafood vegas  never fresh   think out  Vegas = Desert= no ocean= no fish = fish trucked west coast= fresh!!   The halibut looked very delicious but just wished taste just nice     Clam chowder which above average would say lots clams salty though   Herbal fries    tasted ketchup honest     They give corn bread biscuits when first sit down  corn bread die for  perfection    Overall experience  don't think coming back dine though  <EOR> I very similar experience Yelper Yukie P   I dined Saturday July 28th  opted Upstairs dining since host said more intimate romantic both Upstairs downstairs menu there   I reservations 7pm hostess told 2 ppl ahead option waiting lobby bar    My bf sat bar 2 other couples there  asked bartender drink menu  10 minutes later she still given drink menu she could probably tell looking bored waiting  She then told Sorry only menu bar other couple still looking it  time menu ready order drinks a whole 15 minutes fiasco hostess told table ready didnt end frikken drink bar!!! STRIKE ONE!!!  We sat dining area which reminded cruise ship dining room  4 men assisting didnt even know official waiter   Even though 4 ppl assisting service slow! time appetitzer drinks   it turned 8pm already! calamari btw which actually delicious   The man actually took order waiters introduced themselves but whom think manager since he wearing black suit jacket ordering staff around   I asked Downstairs menu gave bf menu each  BF noticed menu  he looked little different mine  entrees Arctic Char while other Sockeye   When manager took orders he didnt seem fazed when bf ordered Arctic Char  ordered Cioppino  time order arrived staff placed food table said bf Here's your salmon   bf looked food he said wasnt Arctic Char  He brought attention waiter not manager    The waiter then stated no longer serve Arctic Char prepared Sockeye instead but same ingredients Arctic Char  could tell bf angry but he kept cool  He told them wasnt he ordered he asked Halibut instead  Why didnt manager tell no longer serving Arctic Char?? someone running place would think would know your own menu!!! STRIKE TWO!!!  I dont understand why would prepare something  available instead asking customer if would prefer instead!!! really upset eat Cioppino all myself   i tried eat slow getting cold while waited bf's halibut  STRIKE THREE!!!  I felt service really ruined date    eating food myself   having wrong menus    giving food didnt ask for     long wait bar    I read Yelp reviews hoping better service but honestly     I'm majority!!! <EOR> As Restaurant Week Las Vegas RM Seafood offered prix fixe $30 09  second course prix fixe signature RM Cioppino which normally runs around $33 itself  prix fixe    The host professional friendly  bit handsome though prefer fine dining host attractive yet seemingly sexually accessible female eager to please eunuch   The wait staff all attentive quick hustling without looking though rushing  If worked restaurant would hide sweaty fumbling back refrigerator   The ambiance pleasant  lighting just dim enough candles add visual warmth  sounds kitchen surrounding conversations held soothing levels   The biscuits cornbread tasty   We each ordered appetizer  three us I Top Chef Masters Moondoggies  Basically seafood corndog but basic all!

Again great service innovative cuisine   However tastes didn't quite match ambitions prices   respect Chef Moonen only using sustainable fish being creative food but same price much better food   Ultimately gauge review  <EOR> If 10 stars would place them  Oysters phenomenal  Sashimi modest portion but excellent quality  Charred octopus dish best entrees ever had! must order! Scallop dish great little confused ravioli pairing but tasted delicious  Nutella creme brûlée dessert  If would sushi charred octopus sure if time dining experience  Price point high but pay for excellence  also don't mind extra cost since few restaurants supports sustainable seafood practices  back sure hope join me! <EOR> The dining room brightly lit decorated wall art photos celebrities Rick Moonen's  culinary awards  lunch crowd rather sparse  However service attentive friendly   Our lunch choices clam chowder soup seafood Cobb salad Steakhouse burger french fries  The cup clam chowder more bowl size thick full flavored  Many pieces clams potatoes carrots  best ever  Seafood Cobb salad large portion abundance lobster shrimp crab  would preferred less lettuce  Overall excellent tasting salad  The Steakhouse burger cooked requested  bottom bun soggy because sauce placed directly bun  suggested server lettuce should placed next bun sauce top  french fries soft inside crisp outside grease less  <EOR> An amazing dinner  Started off crab cake appetizer which tasty but very tiny  enough share   hubby then ordered clam chowder  which beyond words don't even clams  Sweet flavorful goodness  both surf turf entree best king crab ever eaten  Filet perfectly cooked  Would say highlight evening when Rick Moonen came over table wish Happy Birthday   He very warm welcoming seemed genuinely interested thought meal    The service outstanding  waitress friendly very efficient    Can't wait come back  dine again  <EOR> Loved it!!!

Most flavors obvious some threw off   four incorrect which waiter said might second highest him! did tasting four ppl but prob better two   didn't more small mouthful taste   Definitely recommended lot fun!  also ordered Oyster Sampler 6 oysters $21 used Restaurant com gift certificate $10 off during lunch   friends said oysters fresh came variety places platter six different oysters some small some large   sure if I'd recommend Sampler but Ice Cream tasting! <EOR> I thought Rick Moonen supposed some sort seafood master   only 3 fish dishes menu!  Sure lot raw bar crap doesn't require cooking but dude supposed celebrity chef   he good conceiving dishes I'm sure he's cooking good finding supplier freshest fish?    Very disappointed mostly because expectations high   arctic char which swimming creme fraiche   prepared well enough but neither good nor bad   ate fueled adequately rest night   But did enjoy it?  really meal cost over $100 head when all said done     I eat LOT lot great restaurants some notable chefs other without   going RM now able try both Top Chef Masters Bayless home town Chicago am thoroughly unimpressed offer   both sold just overrated?  Overrated sure  <EOR> The seafood outstanding best ever hands down  taste salt water each piece fish  sheer crispness everything really blow away  lunch didn't eat everything sight but father husband did quite dent appetites dinner  Alaskan king crab leg rich delicious didn't even need butter served it  ordered chef's sushi roll which made spot don't quite remember but large insanely good  sashimi fresh could continued eating hours without getting woozy feeling sometimes eating much fish  father also ordered lovely cold sake don't remember name but someone normally can't stomach stuff fantastic light smooth would think drinking nice white wine sake  service subpar  something am normally stickler but food good didn't even care  wish could all time but since only Vegas once year certainly first place stop 2011! <EOR> Excellent restaurant  service superb! restaurant closed 11p but well past midnight still enjoying cuisine  started miso soup shared garlic bread well  ordered sushi california ebi tan rolls  Both simple perfect tastebuds  table shared bottle very dry white wine can't recall name but hit spot perfectly  Pricey though think tab four nearly $200 but basically ordered everything! Great atmosphere everyone dressed best! <EOR> Yummy yummy yummy Tum Tum tummy!  Beware Mac cheese black truffles!  quite worth $35! Otherwise some best food ever had  recommend diver scallops pork belly  <EOR> This place absolutely hyped  confident Rick Moonen talented chef but he isn't working kitchen     The atmosphere? Definitely changed since last time there  Very tasteful classy  family friendly restaurant mostly couples here  ordered jellyfish wakame salad RM garlic tuna red king crab sockeye salmon  friends ordered clam chowder RM style cioppino roasted shrimp   And course could forget sorbet challenge?  Since ordered much just review dishes one Jellyfish Wakame Salad It's very average  could buy wakame part salad $2 3 local Korean market  Nonetheless jellyfish very tasty perfectly crunchy  Then again obvious weak spot jellyfish     RM Garlic Tuna I thought would spectacular since paying much it  okay honest  tasty but didn't any wow factor   Red King Crab So fresh good! Maybe worth price but favorite sushi fo night   Sockeye Salmon Not kind salmon expected come out  red doesn't taste much salmon  probably fault    take advice just don't   Clam Chowder Above average although bit salty  liked variety ingredients used chowder    tasty!  RM style Cioppino They give TON food dish  nicely spicy tasty dish mention abundance seafood  favorite entree night   Roasted Shrimp What absolute RIP OFF  Six shrimp $36?! mention came under cooked?! Horrible horrible horrible  dish all costs   What made dining experience bit better 16 flavor sorbet challenge  takes some time come but worth definitely fun  Balsamic? Pine Nut? knew flavors even existed!  Overall place tremendously expensive  Personally if ever back again wouldn't order any food  I'd straight sorbet challenge The service alright    waiter nice but sometimes he bit scatter brained  RM Seafood gets lot publicity Vegas but think more hype anything else  <EOR> Took hottie Valentine's Weekend   upstairs just opened made reservation prix fixe menu   ambiance nice calm looks ship   food magnificent!  don't remember all dishes but give review some favorites   Tried some hottie's spider crab which sweet   She also squab which honestly say best squab ever had   juicy small bird   China pork since Chinese better good   Well was    nice crispy outside fatty inside    yum   only downside meal portions bit small but price $65 its pretty good   When left saw Rick Moonen talking employee   asked take picture he very gracious   Two big thumbs up! <EOR> My fiance dinner getting engaged   tasting menu   Little disappointed butter poached lobster read wasn't available   King Crab Scampi AMAZING!!!  dream day   chocolate tasting desert fantastic  <EOR> I'm seafood eater but wife loves decided drop lunch other day great time   Great food service waiter Cliff really friendly knowledgeable    My wife ordered oysters lobster roll she loved them!  can't speak personal experience seafood said  I'm seafood guy  As ordered chicken wrap delicious!

Quite different flavor probably better small doses   advice anyone tries out    take small bites   They rotate flavors each week may sriracha   But something don't typically think dessert flavor   probably walk away thinking your pallette nearly sophisticated thought was   happened sour cream flavor   put sour cream quotes because still convinced restaurant said sour cream actually sour cream   tasted exactly key lime told waiter this   Apparently don't know real fresh sour cream tastes like    guess don't know key lime tastes either    Still fun food experience husband me   would great thing try group friends   see if improve current score 8 16  <EOR> RM Seafood really underrated   don't it   favorite restaurants Las Vegas!!!  expensive sure which why recommend try first time lunch!  $28 lunch tasting menu   Clam Chowder RM Seafood amazing  Definitely best ever anywhere! kidding better anything Boston San Francisco other great Seafood cities   liked much asked recipe gave me!!!

Sadly overprice entrees think small plates disappointment too   trio scallops inconsistent two good horrible    Worst all pocket salt scallop ruined sense taste   When told server salt he simply thanked letting know   Really?  How's fix it?!  Overall disappointment   would recommend skipping RM heading Fleur where small plates tasty advertised  <EOR> Rick Moonen's Seafood restaurant indeed world class   clam chowder truly worth price   Stick raw steamed seafood great meal   baffles why restaurant does more love   think think heavy sticker price deterrent   clam chowda must   would envy many Boston! <EOR> Worst ever!   I fell victim Travelzoo scam pre paying nearly $90 four course meal two  When arrived looked strip mall type set allowed sit inside but told Travelzoo specials seated here  Even though many empty tables inside seated sectioned off area mall walkway table small could barely handle diner let alone two    Now being seated greeted Server explained four courses would enough proceeded heavy upsell campaign resulted agreeing crabcake order  Yikes timeshare presentations less pressured!   Now food   our first course teaspoon size tidbit something pretty ok but small I'd hardly call course  told intended cleanse pallet  followed clam chowder husband fugi apple salad me  While flavors chowder good potatoes undercooked hard little lumps throughout ruined it  salad consisted four paper thin slices apple topped slaw type salad mix  Again tasted ok but small I'd hardly call course  crabcake very good but only $17    Somewhere ordered beer glass wine along tap water  Didn't see much Server upsell speech but Runner help move dirty dishes each delivery   hardley four star dinning experience say least    Now main course  chopino husband salmon  Mine ok but great salmon arrived nearly raw husband asked cooked bit more  Then front house Manager came mocked appreciating sushi   tell rude people are    And then end last course which desert two consisted 16 tablespoon sized scoops ice cream taste guess flavor  While don't call course desert could fun but bacon wasabi flavors left such bad taste wondered why started pallet cleanse first place    Now if you're still finally  bad Server bad location bad food brought bill  pre paying $90 dinner he presented bill just under $120!!! covered beer glass riesling wine crabcake tap water    get tax $50 tip!   The service bad ambiance worse food only ok   so why big price tag? If you're looking nice place seafood Las Vegas somewhere else  <EOR> If looking nice spot drink eat some really good food well it  sushi dinner fresh service 5 Stars  stop every trip Vegas if chance  <EOR> I think drank 4 Gingerales sitting      We sat tall tables bar guy taking care section restaurant  Considering he all himself taking orders serving bartending service very good  He smiled whole time very nice     Our friends recommended cat fish sloppy joes couldn't understand would good fish sloppy joes   Apparently Oprah likes featured dish show  scanning room seeing multiple Oprah pictures decided order it    It took while order but guess all cooking waiting totally worth it! delicious came pickles potato chips   couldn't believe good was    Our other friend ordered crab cake which came crab cake jicama   thought tasted fresh but could used more salt something   sure if crab cake worth it      maybe if came two crab cakes P   I wonder rest menu is       <EOR> Please note upstairs upscale dining room more casual downstairs   I'm very happy RM seafood  Having already done tasting menu week instead la carte options off very small la carte menu but think good options   At waiter's recommendation charred octopus over sushi roll  good but great  find myself wondering sushi  octopus super tender charred outside plus served good accompaniments? Thinly sliced chorizo mild olives nasturtium leaves? Probably first time eaten nasturtium leaves  Plus smoky chorizo slightly bitter olives tasted great octopus  All top bed pepperonata which thought little strongly flavored  There's something doesn't jump seat though  good said but would try something else next time   But all OK when diver scallops arrived  can't remember having any scallops good anywhere else just going call spade spade probably best ever had  Seared perfectly  Prepared perfect done ness  all stuff them worked perfect harmony  Tiny cubes slightly softened Asian pear little bit applesauce or maybe pear sauce around plate super tender meaty rich pork belly drizzle pork jus over scallops dusting sea salt very lightly dressed frisee salad  dish 5 stars  Maybe 6  savory pork sweet fruits well flavorful salty scallops   oh man  good    Dessert Irish coffee ice cream flourless chocolate cake mint foam yesssssss some foam! baileys almond biscotti  over ricotta fritters which sounded better but more pear them  having pear apple scallops didn't want t double flavor  kind wish had   the dessert just ordinary  biscotti least good espresso   So why 4 stars those scallops? meal bookended less 5 star items  I'd say octopus weakish 4 dessert 3  would tell double order scallops them blow your mind  maybe try other appetizers desserts  But think overall RM Seafood the upstairs least totally worth visiting  <EOR> First off fan Rick Moonen watching Top Chef Masters  jovial personality competitive nature love seafood rooting weekly basis  admit no idea he before strolled restaurant Mandalay Bay numerous ocassions without even clue RM stood initials  Thanks television celebrity chefs gained more exposure which likely equates more business restaurants   So excited  love seafood  wanted nice meal wife celebrate special ocassion  wouldn't say expectations through roof but when you're paying top dollar dine nicely decorated restaurant inside large Vegas hotel Strip expect things rather smoothly  Celebrity chef not   We arrived lunch seated right way downstairs  3 maybe 4 other occupied tables otherwise empty room  sat next all framed awards accolades hanging wall proclaiming best seafood Vegas  waiting bit waiter approached friendly took down orders  But all downhhill there   We ordered clam chowder $9 crab cake $16 appetizers lobster roll $27 fish tacos $17   apps actually arrived very quickly can't help but wonder  shrugged dove right in  kidding when say clam chowder probably worst ever life  huge fan clam chowder having tried all over country  chowder extremely watered down lukewarm temperature very strong chalky flavor it  didn't taste much any clams probably discovered 5 little rubbery pieces clam overall just felt slurped down bowl seafood milk  Even Boudin better chowdah   The crab cake bland seasoned very well  consisted nice chunks lump crab versus stringy over mixed crab cakes many restaurants have only good thing  done 2 dishes waited seemed eternity other main entrees arrive   Waiting food understandable busy restaurant but when pretty much dead? Inconceivable  inquired food said barely getting started it  decided 86 lobster roll stick fish tacos  When fish tacos arrived almost laughed  looked double decker tacos Taco Bell see picture   Instead large chunks halibut fish meat minced served within taco shell  some nice flavor slight kick far most decent dish which isn't saying much   At point just wanted leave ASAP  When saw check overcharged us  bill said sharing fee which laughable  waiter said charged dinner prices then mentioned 3rd day working something  Wow  saw manager beige suit give quiet tongue lashing quite times but never apologized directly us  $50 window mediocre food medicre service  Rick Moonen sure you're good chef but off day your restaurant needs some serious help  <EOR> RM Seafood nice spot stop dinner before long night gallivanting around town   The  ambiance restaurant itself nice but fancy expecting  think upscale vibe slightly downplayed fact right escalators led mall    The scallops interesting  really liked flavor texture  hash which pork belly tiny potatoes also delicious  Though both tasty didn't feel hash really scallops mostly due potatoes    Overall enjoyed dinner would back  <EOR> Went last night seeing Rick Moonen Top Chef Top Chef Masters many times     The restaurant itself very modern comfortable looking   thought seats very comfortable well   For dinner Beef tartar amazing seasoned awesomely truffles   you can't that   Came fries which prepared nicely but little salty side   BLT salad great tasting salad cool presentation   Simple salad lettuce tomato blue cheese crumble bacon some sort dill dressing   Arugula Mint Salad Very fresh tasted good only thing wished just tad more mint it   Mussels give lot mussels appetizer but wife main course   Came 2 garlic breads   sauce delicious maybe little more white wine   Very light sauce   Branzino Very tasty cooked really nicely   sauce sorry forgot but made dish   some fresh veggies underneath   think next time

swamped  <EOR> went rm seafood friend's 30th birthday celebration couldn't more disappointed   12 people when offered split check couple didn't realize going take 45+ minutes   for price food expected much more   9oz  filet ordered med rare came med well while fiance very rare cut   would simply switched but ordered mine oscar seemingly simple task especially seafood place but instead waiter quoted 1 2 lb crab meat steak   very displeasing because couple things 1 1 2 lb crab meat 2 even much more reputable steak place smith wo oscar does cost $39 needless say very shocked when itemized bill showed up   known would rung that would opted $80 surf turf meal special very disappointed   aside that server introduced everything then just disappeared didn't see again until end night he nothing say disappointment service because he even serving night   we dinner didn't come until 25 minutes brought all other dinners always tough situation when group because wait plate let everyone else's food cold just eat then all sitting around looking person eating dinner   when finally did break bill added gratuity which fine because group 12 completely fine that EXCEPT fact more 25% added gratuity now would tipped least 20% even disappointing events took place but place more 25% check without even explanation think less expected   overall say going back rm seafood during next trip  <EOR> The food really good but experienced some most obnoxious service ever encountered  He basically upsold every opportunity  asking whether wanted seafood towers table while placed orders offering add something everything ordered green salad great crab     you should foie gras steak   worst when he suggested a bunch double sides table why needed mac cheese mashed potatoes when everyone ordering sushi crab no idea    we ignored suggestion he brought them anyway which probably added $80 bill  huge fans Rick Moonens excited eat but left place feeling swindled   Really bummer  <EOR> The restaurant located between Mandalay Bay Luxor restaurant row walkway area choose between upstairs downstairs restaurants   upstairs lot more upscale fine dining while downstairs more casual but still classy     They different menus but chose downstairs since just buddy menu looked more style anyway   menu looked good but little pricey 2 guys just looking dinner but just won thousand playing blackjack wasn't big deal  friend seen Rick Moonen Top Chef he suggested eating looking around other restaurants nearby     The hostess phone made wait   She seemed give attitude instead apologizing not complained but besides service excellent   waiter knew menu well through specials which sounded impressive he also made some excellent recommendations menu   ended ordering small seafood sampler which 6 oysters half lobster tail mussels shrimp clams special escabeche   really good!  main course red snapper ordered mac cheese mashed potatoes   mashed potatoes cost $7 remember thinking mashed potatoes would them worth $7? ordered them anyway because mashed potatoes but turns pretty amazing   added fresh capers basil chopped red onion which gave whole new dimension flavor texture   really good!  We sat close windows apparently concert House Blues because long line skimpy dressed young club goers women sexy outfits eye candy hotness   Made dinner lot more entertaining constant parade Vegas party girls slowly moving by   We didn't enough room dessert but sure would amazing   I'd probably come back again if Mandalay Bay   expensive but food great   Also later see restaurant com discount coupons! <EOR> All food amazing! server Robert much fun  Try dessert  16 flavor ice cream tasting  missed 5  whole table into it! <EOR> We visited Rick Moonen's RM Seafood past Monday   very impressed everything had   drinks oyster sampler bar while waiting friends arrive   3 atlantic 3 pacific oysters all very fresh   When friends arrived seated downstairs more informal dining area     It's huge place bar separate dining area downstairs lounge more formal dining upstairs   heard good things fine dining upstairs try soon     We all special restaurant week three course menu extra appetizer   started ahi tuna duo tuna tartare lightly seared tuna   tuna very fresh delicious   friends enjoyed jumbo lump crab cake looked all crab no filler   Next shrimp salad clam chowder both very good   Main course choice salmon scallops   wife salmon slow cooked nice lime butter sauce   friends scallops which try   Scallops properly cooked nice sear   Desserts strawberry cream puffs chocolate carmel mousse   didn't try cream puffs but chocolate mousse fantastic   Always enjoy little maldon sea salt top chocolate   really sets off   highly recommend RM Seafood  <EOR> The food pretty damn good but its freakin EXPENSIVE   $75 14 oz new york strip steak?!
