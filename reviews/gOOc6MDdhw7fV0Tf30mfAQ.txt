Very well seasoned nice light crunchy batter  definitely return any time Vegas! <EOR> Love love love place! If you're looking down home country breakfast place! <EOR> The food pretty good  think grits made perfect  both grits bowls mine bacon also requested cheese  only reason 4 stars opposed 5 because customer service    didn't seem welcoming all small space  Besides wouldn't problem coming back orders  <EOR> Great food   catfish grits ?and waffle?    only regret discovered them last day trip   waistline probably happy   place definite do over  <EOR> We Sunday 2 00 took them 48 mins bring order  husband fried catfish very small portions cold probably cuz cooked first then cooked next which took longer  chicken fried steak wasn't great all  meat tasted use low quality meat  never come back again  far drive food nothing great  <EOR> The staff EXTREMELY professional! very friendly accommodating  The food pretty good but all   pork chops flavored nicely but tasted fried chicken grease fresh grease   The mac 'n' cheese probably best tasting thing ordered  greens smoky flavor but weren't really seasoned    Whatever stay AWAY cornbread!! good  tasted uncooked unseasoned corn meal  Yuck!   next time Vegas don't think back     <EOR> Must try if your town  place real southern hospitality walked everyone said hi welcome house! all most good Ms Tomson's cooking love Ms Tomson <EOR> MmMmmM Chicken Waffles!

Chicken Waffles $10 95   Gotta some BEST fried chicken ever had! much flavor   so juicy   and everything tastes great Maple syrup poured it!  Batter spices flavor hiding inside nice slightly crispy crunchy consistency   Waffle good mind blowing good but combining chicken takes another level!  Pretty basic waffle but chicken where at!

AND prices reasonable! actually recommended she raise them satisfying! Especially when compare paid similar places less satisfying food service! Y'all support sister she deserves it! <EOR> There certain places refuse especially alone  always some good Southern cooking but if area looks could shot any time then forget it! fact there's place block away Gritz Cafe supposedly good catfish group Yelpers actually few months ago  saw pictures place decided would smart even group  glad say Gritz Cafe clean safe place good food   They only few tables  service superb absolutely friendly  food served fresh hot  catfish grits mac cheese chicken waffles  sweet tea less sweet compared most places serve sweet tea   Catfish Seasoned battered corn meal fried perfection  Put some hot sauce perfect! terrible catfish past also raised eat catfish since bottom feeder eats garbage speaks highly place  5 5  Chicken Waffles I'm Roscoe's fan would compare chicken waffles GC's  GC 4 huge chicken wings  Roscoe's lets choose parts want  BUT GC's fried chicken just delicious  Super hot temperature wise crunchy well seasoned  waffles   well marginal  Nothing special   Roscoe's waffles much better  Even guy next table thinks so! 3 5 5 <EOR> This place best chicken waffles Vegas  chicken well seasoned waffles taste great! would give 5 stars but place itself extremely small fills quick during lunch sometimes there's no tables left  worth wait though! <EOR> Hello Roosevelt Amazing Unique Mobile Detail Pressure Washing Service expense grits Cafe excellent Waitresses great name Nunu very nice lady very professional appreciate service thank you <EOR> Gritz Cafe great  Good food great service  attentive   grits eggs cheese catfish    location business district food court but doesn't deter guests going because food staff wonderful  liked wall celebrity photos Barack Michelle Hillary guy Black Jesus!   place must visit whenever Las Vegas  <EOR> Awesome coffee! Delicious food  mix n match breakfast sausage link chicken wings  Nice customer service  must tourist want enjoy tasty home style breakfast <EOR> I hoping Gritz Cafe would live high ratings seen Yelp  Alas level anticipation expectation may driving 2 star review   found whole experience substandard any Southern Soul Food dining experience travels   menu quite limited   Food even served plate   Everything dished styrofoam plates containers utensils plastic   ordered Mix n Match   2 large fried chicken wings 2 catfish fillets greens grits cornbread   bright spot chicken  greens also good but could find any pepper sauce accompany them   cornbread light muffin sweet   grits good but seemed missing something butter heavy cream if guess    Most tables small dining area filthy crumbs previous diners no staff seemed care when clean off own table chair before could sit down  know long way southern states but could much better  <EOR> I love food gritz eat twice month     But today gritz experience good all     took almost hour food   staff little rude dismissive     Every place bad day but today's experience very under whelming fairly shocking <EOR> My friends happy found place thanks Yelp!!

I'd skip side straight bacon cheese grits instead! <EOR> We decided try Gritz because IG posts  arrived 10 45 am first thing noticed small interior no available seats  Now best inside 10 tables lady register said outdoor seating alright  Initially lack seating trying figure where would eat food if worth eat car just elsewhere  Now lady register failed mention outdoor eating consisted ONLY 2 tables  table taken family 5  party consisted 3 people  only option outdoor table 2 chairs  Luckily seating outside few table inside became available able dine inside    To order must stand line once register provide your name place your order  Once your food ready brought you  Since didn't table food could brought me  When approached pick food lady commented didn't table where seating  tone rubbed wrong if she couldn't see did available table responsibility bring own table  responded told outdoor seating area but unbeknownst seating area joke  understand why person invest restaurant limited seating capacity    Let's discuss food  fish chicken yams Mac n cheese grits eggs lemon cake cornbread white bread rolls  start off let's mention Southerners    from where may ask? Oh just great state Louisiana  restaurant refer themselves southern cooking live blasphemy  Just saying  Well thing evident kitchen does stock seasoning if cook does know use which results bland top bland wrapped bland  Did mention food shall say bland? friend commented best part meal fountain drink  guess should happy did peach cobbler available  If can't good fried chicken catfish whipping any award winning cobbler  friend ordered lemon cake only dessert available she took bite stared down cake closed through all together    Now food isn't awful but good  worth price  tried but back  Also staff member responsible ensuring order right when brought really must paying attention  Three times friends ask something suppose order didn't drinks bread cake    If pay attention anything else say remember BYOT [Bring your own Table]  <EOR> I love place!
