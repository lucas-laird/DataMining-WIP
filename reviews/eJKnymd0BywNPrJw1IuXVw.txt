She REALLY made wanna pay 15 dollars two tacos  She brought water but didn't bring place setting  It'd thing if busy but she two other tables  And then when asked someone else check because 4 6 people done food while guy said hurried tone she's gonna she's doing something right now  Even if Debbie legitimately busy still wouldn't excuse wait time things attitude top added not so great experience   I don't know group acting before showed but even if some hassle because took long order couldn't decide constantly talking over each other you're still service industry your job put deal every day buck deal it  all things don't wanna do  <EOR> I love place! something everyone  If your vegan plenty options! food tasty staff awesome  Priced little high but worth it! <EOR> The Nachos awesome!

Located Downtown Fremont pretty convenient especially if you're Nacho mood  Patio seating aircraft hangar style door also great centrally located industrial concrete bar warm sunlight    Because seemingly don't know settle stock off menu selection Supreme Tostada Nacho but asked pico side also side enchilada sauce but without lettuce cause did seem weird right?   First awesome bartender? brought order he immediately noticed presence lettuce threw stop sign  All apologies returned kitchen fresh prepped replacement brought shortly thereafter  Second best nachos ever!!!!

It's dark divey type vibe low lighting    The service great! Prices high but food nicely done  Caution everything kick spices great those tolerate burning your mouth type sensation  happy pork wasn't spicy   And fried ice cream churro chips now special place heart  <EOR> The Cycle Pub Crawl took stops but wish hadn't  chain restaurant prices designed gouge nearby tourists  $16 Coke poorly crafted margarita  you'd expect pay nightclub but crappy chain restaurant  We all ordered drinks upon arriving couple flag down servers missing soda margaritas  watched bartender keep dropping drink recipe notes  nachos disgusting  tasted stale chips looked dog food top   I wouldn't feed dog  servers no idea ordered settling bill monumental task them  sure count your change before leave  A very disappointing experience   wouldn't waste time money since plenty other better places nearby  <EOR> First off must say staff amazing!

Like said earlier place little packed don't expect your food 5 min most tex mex places   worth wait  <EOR> I wish could give zero star since didn't even try food   My husband live only hour flight away visit Vegas quite frequently  This time decided explore what's outside strip experience Fremont Street past Wednesday  While debating eat dinner super excited find restaurant because LOOOOVE nachos  We little before 6 o'clock hostess said didn't wait if we'd seat ourselves bar   However when walked into restaurant instantly became invisible  We sat right front bartender finishing customer right us  She then walked past collected all menus bar at point thought she going give those menus because she obviously did see come sit walked other side bar put all menus back pile then proceeded chat another customer over 5 minutes  Thinking must someone else charge bar area walked outside hostess asked taking care bar customers which she answered the bartender   I back inside saw bartender still busy chatting same customer chased down another bartender prepping something else asked menu  She gave menu asked would drinks   Since didn't even chance look menu said start some water  She gave water threw some napkins yes she threw napkins started chat another customer sitting next me  We decided wanted order waited finish conversation other customer  We sitting waiting finish conversation acknowledge us   just looking idiots waiting    waiting    when clock hit just over 6 20 finally realized nobody restaurant interested serving decided walk restaurant  We little over 20 minutes didn't even order drinks when 2 bartenders sight obviously acknowledged us  RIDICULOUS that?? We've never felt invisible around many people!  We've trying figure wrong  Maybe because looked young broke since came right swimming? because wanted start off water she thought weren't going order drinks? only interested serving old male customers?? Bottom line discriminating against some way?? Because neither two clearly wasn't busy obvious aware us  The bartender asking old male customer next if he would coming back next day pfffff which he answered he's leaving next day   Well tell sure won't ever coming back  yes sharing experience friends family  hope nobody else experience horrid unreasonable ridiculous service  guess star towards hostess  She only treated real existing people  <EOR> we tried nachos filet mignon street tacos good   except tortilla tacos hard  service good fast  <EOR> My girlfriend raved place very adamant eat here   long wait outside which kind hostesses fault   Unsure why maybe lack staffing NASCAR weekend  very fun atmosphere quite few patrons surrounding round bar looked having load fun! waiter excellent he gave totally great service fun talk with   ordered margaritas because why wouldn't we? just average nothing write home about   decided split nacho plates   am saying weren't good but when your name Nacho Daddy expect them fulfill name   Ours very little stuff top something seemed right cheese   Any cheap believe more 20's crowd would absolutely love it  <EOR> Stopped getting late flight Vegas   staff friendly   We ordered wings cheesy nachos filet street tacos   Food great but would liked try something else large menu options   nachos simple wish would gotten meat them   Tacos filet yummy   The waiter gave free shot birthday   If adventurous  try scorpian shot!  chicken but looked interesting! <EOR> K tough review  Showed halftime mnf  First food bad tho just apps  staff nice friendly  even turned sound game us  having decent time  But then she came wrecking ball  off duty nacho daddy bartender fire red hair 1 person megaphone!
