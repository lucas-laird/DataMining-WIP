Im Süden der USA gibt es viele Einwanderer aus Mexiko  Spanisch ist daher ein recht geläufige Sprache dieser Region  Im Javier's ist ein Großteil des Personals südlicher Abstammung und wir konnten uns den ganzen Abend mit unserem Ober Raul auf spanisch unterhalten  Er fand es großartig dass Deutsche seiner Muttersprache mächtig waren und überschüttete uns mit Komplimenten Ansprachen Empfehlungen  ein Wortschwall folgte dem anderen  Das war uns dann doch etwas zu viel der ansonsten gepriesenen amerikanischen Servicekultur  Grundsätzlich ist das Javier's hochpreisig  Da es aber die mexikanische Küche erlaubt Fingerfood und kleine Gerichte zu kombinieren kann man gut und reichlich essen und trotzdem nicht das Gefühl haben über Gebühr finanziell strapaziert zu werden   Trinken tut man am besten ein Bier das ist nicht nur günstig im Vergleich zu den teuren Weinen es schmeckt auch und die Auswahl Marken ist immens  Traditionsbewusst wählten wir ein mexikanisches Bier  Perfekt gekühlt ohne eiskalt zu sein wie ansonsten oft den Staaten  Tequilas gibt es dutzende verschiedene Marken  Hochwertige Sorten die selten zu bekommen sind  Eine gute Gelegenheit sie auszuprobieren  Außerdem rühmt sich das Javier's für seine handgeschüttelten Margaritas  Wir haben dies nicht ausprobiert aber den Nachbartischen wurden fleißig und akrobatisch die Mixbecher geschüttelt  Fazit High end cuisine  wirbt das Javier's von sich  Stimmt! Wer einen mexikanisch angehauchten Abend authentischer Umgebung verbringen möchte hier ist man richtig  Tischreservierung abends empfehlenswert  Vier Sterne  <EOR> I ordered mole chicken dry  Way expensive got    But then again all presentation  say might called look Mexican food   but no flavor  <EOR> I love place  Seriously  The decor awesome  Beautiful dark iron work throughout  can't even describe   Truly luxe Mexican feel it   Man Austin restaurants should take note  Seriously  love atmosphere here  Check pictures    Also best salsas ever had    Food clean simple style  Excellent mexican rice   fan beans but food top notch imo    The bar cool knobs all around there's always place hang your purse  took terrible flash picture it    Love  This  Place  <EOR> Truly disappointing! Unfortunately weren't impressed  Overpriced mediocre food  $10 spinach enchiladas hometown Mexican restaurant blow theirs away  Rice beans bland skirt steak really little flavor  $6 jumbo margaritas local Mexican restaurant larger far better  only thing really enjoyed chips salsa  Service good! <EOR> My favorite Mexican spot Vegas!

I steak fajitas! most part nearly amazing experience! vibe fun especially later gets    Being Las Vegas happy hear opened City Center happy say drive strip wonderful Mexican food! <EOR> Like lots Vegas restaurants very over priced drinks outrageous    But being Texas food quality 3 5 stars  Rough price   Good looking place impressive vibe but can't recommend <EOR> The only reason ended random adventure because pops hit 2k Aria within first 5 minutes being there  Random day indeed but happy ever  He treated all Javier's because he loves lobsters enchiladas wouldn't believe  He indeed he said amazing  cannot attest since enjoy seafood much but take word it    As BEST rice ever thus far lifetime  am big big fan Spanish rice  Anytime will  Unless already know sucks certain place then no go  However Javier's delicious moist mouth watering  Whatever positive adjective think is  wish would gotten more but full didn't occur until later when craving it    The next best thing chicken enchilada crispy chicken taco combo  usually most menus Mexican restaurants but course compare favorite  enchilada good but exploding mouth good  sauce bit spice side taste buds but overpowering where needed drench mouth water  chicken taco stuffed crisp bites all way  Usually tacos just little bit chicken bottom  but chicken every bite  really good  course beans good but good rice friends!   Next washed all down very delicious but kind small side pomegranate margarita  actually topped drink fresh pomegranate  very good but price expecting actual margarita glass rocks glass  Still good though    Lastly absolute favorite decor atmosphere Javier's  dark glamour feeling when walk in  lot tree branch designs coming walls but favorite held multiple bottles looked tequila other variations liquor   pretty wish could future house  next best thing back wall mural skulls skeletons  just mesmerizing look at  could stare hours just examining each piece 4     This place very expensive some areas menu but bad others  dish only 19 sure much drink was  would save come again sure  Perfect nice date night  also bar front  Such neat place  <EOR> Went last night sister dinner took 40 mins 4 tacos irritated manger didn't anything when told him <EOR> My friend wanted come grab food he tried margaritas previous trip  food good great  mrs ordered tablita came asada chicken carnitas along rice beans tortillas guacamole grilled onions peppers  rice beans average  best part meal carnitas  If came back would definitely order carnitas plate  tablita ran $50  also jalapeño margaritas really good  <EOR> This review based level service two items ordered managers cocky attitude when presented some feedback first Javier's experience    I'm local Vegas if going Mexican food wont list  high end Mexican restaurant place does qualify  Save your $$$$$ somewhere else    My group ordered 2 shrimp taco plates 2 each plate both plates came cold  sent them both back plates came cold again  When paying $$$ 2 shrimp tacos expect kitchen right 50% time   other dishes came fine quesadilla enchilada but even outrageously delicious  server didn't come check often would expect left dry fair amount time    We bill more happy pay but $181 cold shrimp tacos quesadilla enchilada 2 rounds drinks???  asked speak manager he kept turning things back did something wrong  name Omar completely unprofessional lacked maturity manager such high end restaurant  He asked if ate all cold food hungry     gonna send food back again again again keep getting cold dish   answer giving discount   didn't even ask discount but since he shoved face instead asking your experience more enjoyable said Why not?    He said ate all food    trying help run your business giving constructive feedback letting know obviously something wrong kitchen but he didn't seem care    I'm done ranting place hope everyone else better experience did if review does turn away  Otherwise lot restaurants Vegas give much better service management actually cares customer say  <EOR> Good stuff margaritas good prompt chips salsa food decent the two people la tablita particularly happy tomatillo enchiladas which okay     The negative rating really service   particular women party Aria gift certificate refused apply bill  She actually called advance ensure would work multiple times fact told no problem   manager complete jerk when there   Really soured whole evening  <EOR> The decor place really nice   food just ok   found dishes ok but great   Everything seemed little bit much salt   would probably come again but would fun atmosphere decor food  <EOR> Beautifully authentic classy mexican food vegas style!! girl friend felt right home Eduardo lovely team mates   Chips salsa arrive quickly decide casa margarita jalapeño margarita   Fancy handshaken margaritas win  also try Mexican margarita which fresh lime only which prefer jalapeño margarita   My shrimp Javier's chopped salad yummy!! managed overcook shrimp   friend loves crispy taco enchilada combo   Wish could come back soon!!

A very very nice restaurant! Service strong friendly attentive  party six variety dishes loved them all  ambience romantic although bit loud  also tried variety specialty cocktails which also delicious  Tamarindo Margarito just amazing  Unless hate Mexican cuisine guaranteed hit  <EOR> Ambience cool but dark table need use flashlight your phone see menu  Guacamole nothing special salsa chips good chicken nachos good  crab enchiladas ok rice refried beans little flavour  Very disappointing none party impressed food would recommend especially if you've good Mexican food  many places Vegas choose would skip one <EOR> Great food service ambience  Hands down best upscale Mexican food vegas  Highlights tamarind margarita scallop poblano cream sauce Azul trio relleno enchilada taco awesome but star meal dessert aren't dessert people but pan de lote amazing  Moist cake cream cheese built in  Absolute delish!

Newport Javier's theeeeeee best! <EOR> Only if taste buds eyes   place astonishing! Love white walls dark woods dark leather accent wrought iron  All some kind Moroccan architecture ogival arches hanging ropes imitating giant draperies  There's also largest chainsaw carved piece art hanging walls suppose tell history Mayans but all saw skeletons scattered all over maybe tells Mayan present past  still     a real feast eyes! place where would probably find most interesting man world having lunch!       ordered Dos Equis asked menu   The food     where start? Oh yes! chips salsa course  first rule tell if restaurant committed quality chips  Room temperature chips = corner cutting restaurant  Warm chips = extra mile restaurant  Well happy inform chips only warm also crispy tasty!  before adding salsa!    now great    really hoping something different menu since looking place obvious Javier wants set himself apart most typical Mexican restaurants but unlike decor menu Javiers boring any taco shop menu town  fair serve steaks some vegetarian items but you'll pay that!  Yes prices little bit high Mexican restaurant  Carne asada 50 00 filete ladrillo 60 00 filete antiguo 45 00 but everyone else says    strip!      don't care just don't buy silver pay gold!   oh yes paid more food before but stuff couldn't pronounce definitely Mexican restaurant   call el cheapo but skipped those items settled taco enchilada chile relleno combo  Food came kinda warm almost cold even though plate felt hotter food which didn't understand but hungry warm enough edible ate but shouldn't acceptable those prices    Service kinda slow  wait between beers order place wasn't busy time  think saving energy rush hour something  didn't mind time since wasn't hurry also gave time take some pictures  but end although think food good but nothing would way if something would through rolled hundred dollar bill  would probably try again but only if area    complaint     Javier what's music?  stuff would listen Mariana's supermarket while pushing shopping cart broad acres swap meet while bite into elote  sure come something little bit more original  some Mana Sin Banderas play some pandora    and rid all those eight tracks!

Mariscos translates seafood   What's problemo señor? Since staff doesn't should told other locations particular dish called something different technically two names  should told name avoid other Javier's professionals getting chicken enchiladas when want seafood  more thing if waiters wrong should credit back price your dish remake your food right way least  None don't tip BS because still doesn't your mistake!  Anywhoooo    hate admit but aholes Javier's sure good food sometimes location 100% consistent why keep coming back boycotting spite bad first impression Aria location  take four hour drive Cali just satisfy Javier's craving elsewhere  guess stuck eating time time when cravings hit   I absolutely love organic margaritas cadillac style   guess few those willing accept any crap jerk Javier wishes dish me  such sucker! chips salsa addictive careful  Mustn't full when your entrée arrives!

No chunks fat!! <EOR> Conveniently located lobby Aria decided wonder downstairs late night come Vegas!    place tries modern Mexican restaurant    but just don't buy it   Aside straying typical presentation rice beans weren't creative  However points creativity prices    $100 3 entrees appetizer? HAHA!  Good thing comped Aria anyways!    No Bueno! <EOR> So 3 stars food but ambience would 4  just hopping great place just app drink 2 before your next stop   would next time  food average price tag  No problem paying quality but discrepancy between food price  drinks app great people watching  <EOR> Love food drink   Hate service   Unions restaurants bars terrible   wish bartenders name he bad    forgot friends drink   ask 5 minutes later   food order wrong   never checked once food   He terrible   Its shame because food amazing margaritas some best cheap   shame  <EOR> If you're looking some cheap tacos Strip check Tacos El Gordo next Encore  If looking some real Mexican food beautiful setting Javier's your place   Make no mistake Javier's probably more pricey Mexican restaurants town  Average plate runs upwards $30 but don't expect eat less sit down restaurant strip let alone Aria  menu extensive large selection seafood entrees vegetarian dishes  really something everyone combo plates allow sample wide variety dishes  recommend stuffed relleno peppers guacamole lobster enchiladas also extremely popular  side note no free refills soft drinks $6 small 11 ounce bottle  SMH!  Rest assured your money going somewhere restaurant  Javier's gorgeous  Big props interior designer  white stone dark wood leather tables massive wood carvings beautiful bar all come together best looking restaurants strip  restaurant huge probably biggest City Center see attention detail every square inch  <EOR> Had dinner tonight okay expected best 32 00 stinky crab enchiladas!  First bite bit fishy but then flavor settled down    Maybe am just Dungeness crab gal!    Best part visit bartender   Awesome vibe good pours 18 00 margaritas     Damn Vegas ain't cheap no more!    75 00 plus tip 4 drinks   Sigh!! <EOR> How does go    People restaurants eat but come back hospitality definitely agree hence returning Javier's    As soon seated felt waiter didn't time day us  He rushing through meal even though nobody waiting seated  fact end meal husband asked see dessert menu waiter gave bill instead  Then when asked second time see dessert menu he proceeded verbally tell desserts  Maybe way telling order dessert because desserts terrible    For restaurant Javier's caliber disappointment see only two mediocre desserts menu deep fried ice cream flan  Where churros dulce de leche concoctions? Nonetheless shouldn't ordered dessert because awful! dessert described 'deep fried ice cream covered corn flakes' ended getting bad quality store bought ice cream covered corn flakes plated stale deep fried shell  Horrible!  Our entrees okay  ended getting vegetarian enchiladas tomatillo sauce husband cheese enchiladas adobo sauce  Both good but nothing special don't see why $$$  Also don't want prude but restaurant going charge much couple enchiladas I'd expect see beautifully plated entrees but instead served NFK nonfunctional garnishes enchiladas form canned olives slices red onion  Weird!

Decor impeccable! wow! puts other Javiers' shame! beautiful intimate sexy lighting! Oooh!  This place always packed every time boyfriend passed valet   Compared Union which spot before always empty poor Aria Compared Javier's CA average $5 charge every plate since Vegas     The food just fantastic would expect Javier's!   I WANT GIVE SHOUT OUT WAITER JUAN! He absolutely fantastic just made feel comfortable he funny attentive wanted take home us!  The only reason isn't 5 stars because aren't free re fills! They'll bring cute little Mexican glass bottle but  it   Diet Coke fiend know! need more need more! <EOR> The server great accommodating gluten free diet I'm celiac disease chips salsa delicious start  husband ordered beef taco chicken enchilada combo per server's recommendation pescado del dia which halibut sautéed veggies black beans  husband satisfied meal because tasted El Cholo back LA which favorite mexican there  However more pricey El Cholo expected more Javier's   My fish overcooked under seasoned  Halibut should never taste fishy but did  homemade black beans way better seasoned veggies hardly sautéed  Supposedly came light cream sauce but if didn't add anything  husband wanted send back but hungry just doused salsa edible but worth anywhere near $40  should've gone enchiladas despite servers fish recommendation   I wish could recommend because first date night just 2 since we're filming movie parents only town couple days babysit least didn't gluten poison me <EOR> Decided mexican last night Vegas going Picasso but decided bit much almost week Vegas   Just wanted something simpler!   Loved it!!  Great atmosphere ambiance vibe!!  girl but all kinds groups well!!  Drinks great girl jalapeño margarita aroma de mujer margarita she loved them both!!   Had queso appetizer great   also enjoyed mole steak fajitas   Great place Mexican great environment   server luis outstanding! <EOR> $50 Aria resort credit well spent 3 mean margaritas!   We randomly stumbled place because girlfriend sister attracted restaurant's ambiance decor  wide dark lit restaurant large rounded bar area overlooks casino area  Even though place looks all classy flashy don't think would come food because spoiled all great hole in the wall spots LA San Diego  Plus also 4 5 times more expensive tacos burritos Alberto's  did try quesadilla though just snack which very good   I would definitely come back margaritas! don't drink lot margaritas but ones serve probably best ever had  concoction Pepito Cucumber margarita  Top shelf tequila bits cucumber mixed delish! also Jalapeno margarita   spicy but kick flare brought jalapeno  Just drinks chips salsa definitely good recipe start good night! <EOR> Yelptariat wins again  3 5 stars  place doesn't split checks even bar?  absurd  If walked bar struck conversation somebody would drink added tab automatically? Major dislike points policy    I'll spare ad nauseam every last detail but lunch 7 people  $16 enchiladas okay but most fantastic  Everyone else seemed just whelmed meal well  Service slow side well    I would definitely come back bar alone obviously cash because stupid no check splitting policy excellent margaritas  pineapple Javier  both excellent  friend jalapeno  also excellent    The ambiance great but all other details lacking would hard patronize place again meal  <EOR> The Friday night really loud needed wait table even though no line  beef taquitos guacamole  seemed good but time back hotel feeling bit ill  <EOR> Came celebrate hubby's birthday! food very good!! shrimp tacos hubby crab enchiladas  kids loved rice beans  staff very friendly  definitely  come back again when visit next time  <EOR> Everything Javier's smile     The staff welcoming decor music truly set mood drinks amazing   Today trying strawberry mango margarita frozen   course house made chips salsa treat   love taste ingredients salsa kick!  For meal am going tacos de Camaron   sure seasoning used shrimp tacos but truly memorable   never anything it   something sauce omg!    Ok drink here   take pic <EOR> Date time May 27 2014 2300  So so       what say   I actually enjoyed meal  tasty? Yes  But anything special? Nope!   Ordered CABO AZUL Maine lobster shrimp fresh Dungeness crab COSTILLA DE RES short ribs Osso Bucco style TACOS DE CAMARON shrimp duh   The COSTILLA DE RES marinated spicy tomato serrano chili sauce super DUPER tender juicy  Although meat perfectly cooked spicy sauce fell short  craving spicy serrano bite  Still flavorful enjoyable but just needed your face spice   The CABO AZUL TACOS DE CAMARON thought deliciously   average  Good quality freshness seafood  just wasn't blown away    My $15 cocktail really good though! Basically margarita but requested muddled jalapeños  really craving some kind heat meal  Finally! some spice lingered happily mouth  BOOM! <EOR> I did felt VERY over priced     As New Yorker totally understand being ripped off simple things martini mixed drink   But asking $16+ vodka soda which explained bartender flat he disagreed stating if he made new drink he would need charge 2x infuriated before even sat down   Once table waiter much nicer   However asked length salmon rare medium rare ordered arrived close well done   waiter also recommended dish which disappointing because lacked flavor tasted rubber and over $40    Eventually he removed salmon group's bill but overall experience wasn't great   Definitely would recommend Javier's  <EOR> Aria comes through yet again another reason frequent property   I drawn Javier's because knowledge Javier's Dallas pretty convinced Las Vegas somehow connected   When asked told asked quite bit people Texas but particular Javier's California no affiliation well respected location Dallas   That only disappointment visit   THIS Javier's enjoyable somehow strayed plan Todd English PUB afterwards which nearly impossible do   The oval shaped bar just off casino floor plenty seating accomodate very busy crowd even visit Monday night   Dining areas immediately left behind right bar looked intimate unique   I own bar perfect needs enjoyed friendly attentive service Felipe Karen also perfect smile personality handle working all guys back there    Chips salsa put front ordered drink complimentary plentiful  Other Yelpers said salsa some best they've Vegas cannot dispute that  matter fact eyes watering because subtle heat builds enjoying it   While many Mexican style bottled beers bar fully stocked only tons tequilas but excellent selection other spirits  I also appreciate when Johnny Blue available even though probably does much action around $42 shot Thinking would save room some Happy Hour munchies Todd English PUB ordered taquitos appetizer offered chicken beef combination  three plate full time finished them  Sadly may ruined grocer's freezer taquitos rest life  Yes damn good   Oh am fan sour cream Felipe kindly removed order which turn meant drizzled even more guacamole taquitos  even better thought because could take chips dip them additional guacamole still plenty guac flavor complement taquitos   My eyes watering tummy full respect Aria just continues grow  <EOR> The food excellent! atmosphere decor beautiful  But service lacking big way   Management snobby uncompromising    Last year contacted them company Christmas party prices private room seats approx 15 outrageous! think budget 2500 without drinks fair 12 people  passed dinner palace empty! back room empty  Guess didn't need money business   Today called book bday party just 12 unable accommodate separate checks  won't booking there   I am sure tourist business good! Sadly embraced locals don't appreciate local business'  isn't OC! <EOR> This would quintessential Vegas Orange County casual chic dining experience  Hence those only two locations Javier's located in   Located Aria Hotel Vegas perfect place enjoy meal sip delicious margaritas intimate feel    In addition experiencing ambience food exceptionally tasteful   No complaints here  Although eating high priced Mexican food questionable terms creative rice beans ? Well Javier's demonstrates that   I dinned simply because Kobe Bryant's favorite restaurant   I impressed ominous decor  leather menu leather tables 3D paintings all black everything made place appealing   The menu overwhelming since many items mention but large Sea Food portion menu  ordered Lobster Enchiladas yes brilliant  Everything taste food fresh assume took time make  presentation food ok nothing brag about  portion perfect skimpy most bougie restaurants    Javier's also famous Guacamole can't agree more since liked alot !   You pay service excellent ! Please plan reserve accordingly since place does overly booked    I definitely returning soon <EOR> Hands down best Mexican food las vegas!!! pricey side mexican food but taste forget any price   Cabo Azul must get! lobster enchilada shrimp crab chile reno lobster taco great! friend 3 enchiladas 1 shrimp crab lobster she said beyond delicious  cucumber margarita devine! friend mix mango strawberry together pretty good  service excellent!  fast checking never without nothing   put your food container which cute   hands down back  Thank Javiers wonderful evening <EOR> I am really big fan Javier's recommended place dinner town group  hyped everyone pretty hyped myself dinner favs  started dinner reservation set 7 00pm  arrived 7 00 wait 20 mins seated claimed prepare table  seated booth way small group size  way several tables other booths surrounding which empty basically very busy time sure why wait 20 minutes  Because booth small moved another table more appropriate needs  then ordered drinks guacamole  drinks came extremely fast followed chips salsa  waiter came back another drink order asked happened guacamole? check he said  10 more minutes still no guacamole  waiter comes back ask if want more drinks? Still no guacamole ask cancel it  abruptly told can't understand takes long guacamole  said keep bringing expensive drinks why can't grab guacamole? He replied really sorry sir mistake guacamole back prepared all someone needed bring out  He now comes back drinks ask why does table across food when ordered 15 minutes us? He replies honestly ordered takes longer prepare  Good answer guess  finally food arrived but only half order  He says yours shortly  3 5 minutes later rest order shows up  Well surprise mine takes much longer prepare almost ice cold  sure understand why considering mine reason delay  He said tell manager satisfied  all finish meals no manager  flag waiter down check  convinced bad night  However consumer choice where dine most likely dining soon if ever again  <EOR> I'm well versed Javier's  spent plenty nights old Laguna Beach location when relocated Newport Beach used spend fair amount time well   familiar food drinks expecting same great menu here   I early meet party decided cocktail bar  ordered Jalepeno Margarita which excellent way  drink $15 give $20 he gives $5 bill back he didn't break $5 down   Ok next drink made female bartender  She gives back $3  78 right down pennies  She charged tax drink  WTF? Tax ALWAYS included  gives back dimes nickles pennies? Same drink two different bartenders two different prices  little annoying   Onto meal  Same great food before  ordered Seafood Enchiladas nice pieces lump crab meat shrimp every bite  Light sauce heavy  beans rice come meal beans really good greasy all  Chips salsa really good  Salsa probably some freshest had    Service bombarded three different people before during meal  much  While still eating he would come around ask if done if he could clear anything  Clearly still food plates no aren't done  can't stand being rushed when eating  If want talk during meal  business! Literally seeing plates empty he came back around starting clearing plates dropped check off  Didn't offer coffee dessert he just made feel rushed  cool    Ambiance  liked feel dark wood dim lighting Dia De Los Muertos figurines also liked lounge area near bar well  wouldn't date spot others suggested music really loud bit dificult conversation person next you  <EOR> Went dinner some friends unsure place   kinda dark wall table hand carved skulls skeletons all over it   steak ordered cooked perfect   came side guacamole black beans pepper sticking looked Asparagus ate shot realize hottest pepper ever eaten life!!!! <EOR> Service great!!!! food amazing!!! happy found place  want Mexican come here!!!! sure coming next time visit Vegas  <EOR> Food amazing  Atmosphere legit  Service over top awesome  Definitely stop when Aria!

Try mujer margarita! place disappoint  <EOR> We looking place would open late around Aria perfect because closes midnight  literally walked hostess 11 45 p m  she able seat us  next night though walked restaurant packed might wise reservation  chips salsa along margarita delicious    The food good but could better if some overcooked  two tacos shrimp carne asada  shrimp taco perfectly cooked really delicious  carne asada pass meat good but literally meat avocado little bit onion which made taco dry  did sides rice beans though  BF lobster enchilada  lobster little dry overcooked hard taste lobster everything else going dish  wouldn't order again   Overall good experience but pricey opinion  don't think most people spend $$$ tacos enchiladas  would only stop again drinks some chips salsa  <EOR> I've twice  Once just sat bar lunch ordered fajitas  Your mileage may vary but use bottled real sugar Mexican Coca Cola bottles only charged despite receiving three refills  glad wasn't charged extra bottles because billed $6  service food great although dangerously challenging value high prices most plates   The high price issue faded bit when fiancee returned months later dinner where place packed really cool social meets classy ambiance   The menu needs SEVERE updating meal feeling eating light ordered taquitos which billed menu Beef chicken  doesn't even say cheese but every taquito ever life just meat cheese  When came covered slaw onions guac sour cream things guess aren't uncommon Mexican restaurant but things picky enough eater want eat especially when menu didn't say came all stuff  Fortunately server understanding took back allowed select something else menu that still lacked explanation its ingredients but he able provide them verbally could sure getting time didn't charge taquitos   I think critical menu spell ingredients item only does usually help sell item keep picky eaters myself happy but also helps those food allergies avoid certain items without having pester server those types things   Considering menu issue I'd reduce them 3 stars but recover 4 customer service end immediately rectifying issue me  just hope put more long term solution place rewriting menu more verbose  <EOR> First all wait long EVEN if reservations  However I'd advice reservations   My friends waited food very patiently but once laid hands carne asada enchilada plates wait definitely worth it   I seafood enchilada superb  friend gave piece carne asada plate die for  If you've never Javier's should definitely check out  All hype true =] hands down amazing food  <EOR> Do yourself favor order Fajitas! amazing only place itself its gorgeous atmosphere just screams upscale date night <EOR> Beautiful ambiance excellent service fantastic drinks but all vegetarians your options limited unless want bland enchiladas   Came reading amazing reviews restaurant   also saw some tasty sounding veg options menu form enchiladas salads guac!  I ordered a couple of jalapeno margaritas   wow   so delicious  very few memorable ones Javier's spectacular   gal pal ordered martini enjoyed well   We split guac asked some spicier salsas complimentary chips really liked roasted tomato brought   mmm!  For main course excited spinach enchiladas but server Andrew kindly pointed if am pure vegetarian pasilla sauce some meat stock it  He offered refried beans that also meat stock substituted vegetarian black beans which thought great idea he said he could sub pasilla sauce tomato based sauce  asked if tomatillo sauce other veg enchilada could used instead but he said meat stock well   trusted judgment appreciated being told meat stock having plan place sure could still enjoy however when entree arrived great  sauce boring like something mediocre fast food joint   ended putting roasted tomato salsa received chips give more flavor   also doused some appetizer guac enchiladas well   Considering entree $22 and bill general pricey expected true flavor here   really disappointed brought front main course   don't blame Andrew all  think he fantastic but think Javier's needs provide some tasty veg options least better veg sauces enchilads   felt somewhat cheated coming here   enjoyed drink s chips guac roasted tomato salsa but enchiladas sucked   glad gal pal really enjoyed steak fajitas though but surprised because definitely restaurant caters meat eaters     I come Vegas quite bit love Aria but am sure if would come Javier's again food    hoping menu changes cater all diets but until time   I would prolly only come jalapeno margarita some guac  <EOR> The mexican food awesome  its first week working kinks but team very attentive food quality top notch drinks strong atmosphere spectacular  <EOR> Plain simply Favorite Mexican Restaurant anywhere  only serve great tasting authentic dishes highest quality  ambiance chill decor both stylish comfortable  place MUST whenever Las Vegas approved even big fat Mexican friends!

Why world would he tell disciplinary actions towards employees!!!????  made sure tell them even though Cara may made mistake price she certainly very good bartender she should written up   then told would never return restaurant he said fine walked away   astonished MANAGER restaurant caliber would talk way give disciplinary action details adjust price Martinis price already paying argued over $6   argument based solely principle    when charge customer price something then less hour later charge them more same item WRONG he could would see change it   if difference more $6??  if food?  just can't see run restaurant way certainly looking freebies handouts    we just looking manager RIGHT!!!

The place does very cool ambiance rad decor that  Might better drinks apps rather then real food  <EOR> I Javier's Newport all time course excited great experience  Well opposite that  girlfriends some lunch  sat down if Javier's Newport its beautiful ambiance amazing  Vegas location lacked all that  friend ordered chicken tacos share   When food arrived noticed tacos guacamole them  menu didn't say guacamole came tacos  friend sharing allergic avocado send them back  asked guacamole side since wanted guacamole tacos  Another friend mine less happy meal didn't take more 2 bits meal   asked waitress talk manager  waitress sweet but seemed new didn't know much menu  The manager seemed afraid come talk didn't want anything help issues  manager waitress another man looked he may another manager stood computer good 15 minutes just staring computer  What's hard working customer impressed restaurant all  time pretty pissed off  girlfriend mine talk them since she worked restaurant nightlife industry  rocket science  time check charged side guacamole which confused because guacamole supposedly came tacos  As leave group guys came over offered buy drinks  guys buy 2 bottles Cristal spending well over $2 000 restaurant 10 minutes  hated give them kind business but hey guess should thanking maybe treated little better earlier night  Next time take business somewhere else them money    I recommend Javier's Newport <EOR> I believe most expensive Mexican restaurant Vegas yes   $20 quesadilla but least know where money went!    My wife kindly seated cool booths which gave great view those amazing wood carvings dead   I'd love know much actually cost     We rush catch Zarkana didn't dilly dally any appetizers but salsa came chips muy delicioso   wife ordered Cabo Azul which basically seafood combo   most eyecatching thing combo lobster enchilada but turned just OK   grilled chile relleno which really big stuffed cheese shrimp crab topped tomatillo sauce mouthfuls awesomeness   actually served shrimp taco separate plate very good too     I ordered carnitas based waiter recommendation   didn't know expect since priciest carnitas I'd ever before $12   But pleasantly surprised when he brought over   plate featured 3 parts pig including ribs tenderloin shoulder   good!  waiter informed pork marinated 24 hours deep fried then finished oven   If KFC started frying pork would kind taste this   crispy tender juicy all once   would order again heartbeat     This very enjoyable meal overall   both wished could stayed longer   atmosphere food preparation service strong drinks ensure return  <EOR> Good food some ingenuity reasonable price! Service really hit miss here  Sometimes great! Sometimes meh  Bartenders always good  Downside dessert lovers don't serve effort cannibalize dessert cafe but really? Just serve stuff there!!!   It's good standby work    <EOR> My husband twice now friends loved food  The 5 stars basically rating food ambiance alone which well worth higher price point   Service both times mediocre both times different waiters forgot items took very long time drinks  servers all seem predominately male all around same age group ethnicity which kind seems odd Vegas but really could use some brush skills terms service  <EOR> Mediocre food very noisy environment   don't come hear talk friends  come YELL friends   Still if food excellent might put it   fish below average bit rubbery   friend's fajita came late pretty cold   must better places Vegas  <EOR> Gorgeous decor above average food  worth experiencing least once  large party some minor mix ups  Steak tacos yum! <EOR> If real mexican food  best place high recommend   service outstanding  Rene amazing job  tampiqueña  chiles rellenos  pastel de guayaba  Yummy <EOR> If want great food best service possible Javier's place go   impressed staff way accommodated large group  put customer first entire night   fillet shrimp incredible well worth $60 dollars   margaritas sensational   Everyone party commented next day good everything was   ambiance décor food service place 10   Great Job! <EOR> I'll start positive note chips salsa really really good    That being said everything else dinning experience Javier's mediocre     We made journey down Aria eat specifically friends request because favorite places eat California   I ordered chopped salad chicken $22 expecting best salads ever come kitchen case   Lacked dressing portion small no wow factor   would much better off going Chipotle concocting own salad creation saving $15 lol   My friend saying Vegas Javier's just isn't point Newport he frequents but he still happy really enjoyed meal which taco combination plate  Why gave them 3 stars otherwise would solid 2 star experience Bottom line $$$ no joke place over priced food middle mall  <EOR> Barely average Mexican food astronomical prices  chicken enchilada mole sauce  Fair but exceptional  <EOR> This higher end Mexican place  Service good food quite tasty  some fusion concepts won't find tj street tacos here  presentation quality food high    The salsa comes chips quite excellent   lots flavor    I ordered spinach enchiladas which come beans rice  There's onion corn tomato cheese inside enchilada   and good combination  sauce green pasilla sauce which spicy all  rice white but flavor  and little mushy but terrible    Prices little higher but quality better  <EOR> This far best meal service ambiance    the Cabo Azul most amazing Mexican seafood dish ever had   Hubby's steak also really good   We're definitely coming back   haven't excited food really long time really good! <EOR> High end Mexican restaurant located Aria casino hotel floor     always busy highly recommend making reservations soon know you'd eat there  Complimentary chip salsa delicious!
