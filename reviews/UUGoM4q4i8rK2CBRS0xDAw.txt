Looking forward returning soon! <EOR> Note review crepe   pastries deserts   I stumbled across Jean Philippe while searching breakfast   staying Vdara but found quick breakfast place really long line   Since bit hurry decided cross walkway over Bellagio search some food next door   Jean Philippe first place open line wasn't long   Since around 8 30 AM didn't chance try any deserts   since prefer savory breakfast sweet breakfast turkey cheese crepe   far crepes good but nothing mind blowing   other words job done but don't need way come back anytime soon   I actually much better crepe back Paris Hotel Casino several years back knows if place even open anymore  <EOR> Good quality food  Pricey too  Crepes sweet savoury various cakes desserts surprisingly decent coffee too  Oh world's biggest chocolate fountain too    Very limited seating queue system confusing result take while served   Had stayed Bellagio ended visiting multiple times  snickers cake particularly interesting! <EOR> The best dessert had  caramelized banana crepe perfection  flavours bold well balanced  also added nutella tasted even yummier  crepe soft fuffy very tasty  If Vegas mood indulge your sweet tooth then place should eat at  <EOR> Of course awesome chocolate fountain!  Vegas ya! Every luxury steroids   I've cookie truffle everyday week everything delicious   The Madeline cookie big size but little dry  The coconut macaroon chewy goodness sweet  tooth achingly sweet  The cognac truffles winner  love cognac flavor really carries through dark chocolate  Take more box you'll regret it  <EOR> I serious sugar tooth! bad sugar detox stop myself eating chocolate all time  Was around Bellagio's indoor Chinese gardens saw place yelp  ratings sudden craving crepes tempted try out  I should gone initial choice ordered chocolate but decided venture try 'exotic' crepes which includes mango purée topping coconut gelato  gelato really delish but crepe lacked ZING factor soon bit into wanted chocolate  say?! place super tempting though displays baked goods chocolates  Oh cappuccino pretty good but again nothing write home about  yes all glass coke cost $20 pretty expensive  Then again Bellagio! <EOR> My boyfriend ordered vege omelet mushrooms wheat bread chocolate French crepe breakfast  Both those two delicious  Also chocolate lava fountain really amazing  However service little slow especially morning many people waiting line  What's more food little expensive enough eat but did care much considering people usually don't eat lot breakfast  <EOR> I don't mind being charged $11 TINY tuna panini sandwich here   First allow describe looks like   entire sandwich less foot long very light weight cut half prior serving looks even smaller   isn't overflowing meats veggies   glance you'd think $11 sucker   But sucker   The flavors   MAN OH MAN   FLAVORS   TASTY MUCH?  Why all sudden weird looks passerby's?  piece basil chin?  Sauce cheek?  because way facial expression morphs into kinky O face every time bite into sandwich?  way body slumps into chair groan writhe culinary pleasure?  think head GOING EXPLODE   Their tuna panini good where I'd EVERYTIME hunger pangs during most recent stay Bellagio   Good thing don't close shop until midnight although I'd prefer open 24 hours!    It's funny because enamored little sandwich during stay failed order anything else here   Next time trying pastry desserts breakfast items gelato   looks satisfaction all other paying customers snapping sweets could tell more awkward orgasm faces during future visits Jean Philippe Patisserie   Anyway little bit more place itself Jean Philippe Patisserie tucked into small esplanade connects Conservatory Gardens greenhouse resort's convention areas   Walking treat itself   its main focal point Bellagio bills world's tallest chocolate fountain  sight behold   a massive floor to ceiling high fountain system enclosed glass featuring  flowing white dark chocolate multiple dripping points   Then course all elaborately created desserts showcased  behind glass look more conversation art pieces sweets meant eaten   pair cartoonish looking giant 4 foot tall rabbits adorning central work counter kitchen ?  Yeah   Both completely made chocolate   So if you're passing through Bellagio staying guest please urge stop pick yourself many choice gourmet sandwiches along some gelato dessert    $11 $75 worth flavor  <EOR> I actually search restroom when found place mistake best decision life  Every now then when am looking restroom over joyed possibility finding more delicious bakeries!

Regardless Jean Philippe failed fan sweet tooth   Delectables 1 Blueberry muffin bland moist all better ones Costco day olds almost anywhere   Girl behind counter recommended over blueberry danish would tasted like? rock? 2 Triple chocolate cheesecake sounds delicious tastes average   Dark milk white chocolate cheesecake Oreo cookie crust topped truffle?

Being crepe lovers ourselves mixed berry vanilla crepe husband classic savory ham cheese crepe glass grapefruit juice   bill came $32 which rather pricey side crepes but nothing much Vegas standard noted sitdown area small self served corner limited seating   food court     Unfortunately both crepes came bland   Nothing extraordinary   Nothing write home about   sweet crepe covered completely much overly sweetened berry sauce vanilla melt middle much thick making layers soggy little no texture   husband's savory crepe little bit better mine   severely lacking cheese but least buckwheat crepe batter balanced better its ingredients brought little bit more flavor texture    But overall both crepes subpar mediocre best made high quality fresh ingredients    Both tasted rather pre made pulled right fridge    Given much expectation hype felt both bellies pockets jipped  <EOR> 2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE 45 100  I read some amazing reviews Jean Philippe Patisserie come recent visit Vegas past weekend   It located Bellagio hotel just little bit past Conservatory Botanical Gardens  signs pointing towards which direction located in!  I actually pretty surprised small place was  envisioned full bakery patisserie tons cute little cafe tables chairs whatnot but wasn't case  circular area employees staff all middle kinda just walk around counter look all pastries gelato sandwiches etc   One wall famous chocolate fountain which honestly   was big pictured  When people said biggest chocolate fountain world thinking straight Willy Wonka status  totally case! Granted really nice glass display really liked dark milk white chocolate pouring but didn't think mindblowing expected be   Along circular walls bunch packaged goodies chocolates candies hot chocolate mix etc  also some fake cakes display  sure if actually bake fancy cakes but displays nice!  Unfortunately just eaten lunch wasn't hungry all didn't any pastries although REALLY wanted try some them out! didn't HUGE selection but some them looked very tasty! ended getting scoop dulce de leche gelato $3+ Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix $18    The gelato ok me  Presentation wasn't nicest also really soft   like point where basically melting! Gross  wasn't impressed   I made hot chocolate mix when came home must say stuff INCREDIBLE  reminds hot chocolate Churros Calientes Los Angeles  Super thick rich decadent  omg incredible  glad turned well because $18 only few cups hot chocolate pretty pricey! Even more Godiva some other high end chocolate brands   Overall liked Jean Philippe but wasn't blown away thought going be  definitely would return actually try some pastries maybe even crepes which supposed amazing   3 stars! <EOR> Overwhelmed sights didn't know pick out  Everything looked amazing  gelato couple treats  buy some chocolate confections take back home you  But sure don't walk strip while hot outside melt    It's home worlds largest chocolate fountain  Employees top game fast paced environment  always super busy here  pack you're patients ok  place very large deal it  Just enjoy what's around you  order custom cake also  <EOR> To honest other ice cream some chocolates candies no idea place sells LOL  woke super hungover morning really really really wanted some ice cream Yelped ice cream randomly picked whatever came looked good  figured place Bellagio good XD   This place really cool décor  huge chocolate fountain many other statues  definitely attraction kids!
