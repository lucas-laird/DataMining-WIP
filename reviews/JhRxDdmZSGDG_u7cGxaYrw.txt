Why CPK decided force women men children people special needs share sink outside restroom walkway? sink each restroom respective privacies expensive offer customers supposedly value? never return  <EOR> The services sux  server came drink order 15min arrived  drinks came 30 mins later then food came 2 mins drinks  no drank drinks management did nothing it  Oh top off all food cold  <EOR> Didn't take long server Jessica greet us   hate sitting long without getting noticed she saw didn't any drinks she came over apologized if waited long  asked favorite drinks recommendation great!

For lunch split half Thai Crunch subbed chicken avocado natch salad Wild Mushroom pizza truffle oil side  Wild Mushroom pizza good its offerings cremini shiitake portobello white mushrooms galore  Needless say lurved it   The service excellent  waitress attentive pleasant prompt  all things want your service  CPK staff also helpful kind when couldn't find restroom  located behind pillar door frame same color pillar if don't know bit tricky find halfway across restaurant!  Overall great place eat if you're shopping Summerlin  <EOR> My boyfriend didn't feel trying anything new while Downtown Summerlin off CPK went  Service hit miss  sat 10 minutes before server asked if ordered drinks  pretty friendly but just seemed little understaffed  ask twice water refilled second time took while it  Food ok honestly really much better frozen CPK grocery store seems kind expensive is  suppose you're paying ambience   Especially considering favorite pizza place bigger more flavorful pies less  probably back but only if shopping there  wouldn't way  <EOR> This very first time trying restaurant honestly say great experience  waitress great customer service prompt order drinks  Carne Asada Pizza must  Dessert menu limited but good overall  definitely come back try something new menu  <EOR> I'm impressed  mom brother great lunch decided take husband back  ordered chorizo queso fundido because shared previously delicious  time incredibly greasy cheese stringy chunks poblanos uncomfortably large should cut smaller  Strike one  ordered posole rojo pretty cold waiter recommended try it  When arrived covered cabbage despite asking no cabbage  No problem waiter kitchen fresh bowl  He even brought some lime wedges bar squeeze into it  flavor wasn't bad but complete lack filling  absolutely no pork hominy lacking well  ate all filling left massive bowl broth  While waiter excellent food quality lacking inconsistent  don't think we'll back  <EOR> Not big fan national chains but great lunch CPK Summerlin Town Center exception   First day beautiful part Vegas must visit if want people watch enjoy great mix stores restaurants entertainment people wanting seen  Today patio doors where open really set great tone meal    Friendly efficient well trained staff plenty smiles    Great looking new menu where pizza only many great options   We both choose salads Cobb Chopped Italian both cleaned plates  Fresh delicious nice portion   The open kitchen vibrant setting greet choice date night meeting friends before movie   Great job CPK Summerlin  <EOR> Great location beautiful decor  But thats it  totally different menu then any other CPK Ive ever to  came sole purpose having amazing caramelized peach salad only find its menu  settled veggie salad just ok  im huge fan warm veggies semi cold lettuce bed  bartender seemed very underwhelmed almost felt bother more then anything else  manager behind bar very pleasant though thats why Im giving 3 stars instead two   All all probably wont back location because many other places DT Summerlin  Ill stick Town Square Fashion Show locations  <EOR> Now New York bit spoiled terms pizza  into restaurant already understanding pizzas definitely par ones NY  finishing meal realized right was  mean going compare pizza Manhattan pizza west coast  However other dish Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine excellent  just right acidity  zucchini still slight crunch loved every bit it  Definitely recommend

seated food before left before even food  _ when finally food didn't even ordered  ordered pasta something completely different   wait again    would ok them telling forgot place order rather lie tell kitchen backed while everyone else getting food  <EOR> Honestly much all good pizza  location Downtown Summerlin location Honolulu Hawaii tasted both mediocre    aren't all that  Just bland regular
