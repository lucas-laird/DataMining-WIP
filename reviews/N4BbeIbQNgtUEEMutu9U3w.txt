Another unique quality Famous Dave's sauces your dispense each table  sure try Georgia Mustard goes well just everything  reason 3 stars because most consistent factor careless service   recently server only talk over 10 minutes name before he took order but also nerve solicit help funds charity   appalled he continued manager did put stop it   think more irritated because if he spent much time assisting table he did talking himself order would screwed bad! <EOR> Ahh  good ole' mildly authentic American BBQ  Every first generation American Asian's occasional dream    My family used tradition trying eat BBQ every Fourth July efforts real American experience Famous Dave's frequent pit stop over years  But without many flowery words over years place more BBQ fix spot rather must have culinary experience    My most recent visit ordered 1 3 rack St  Louis ribs which came two sides corn Mac cheese corn bread  really appreciated variety menu amount combinations mix match between ribs brisket BBQ chicken even all sides    I thought ribs good tender but thought could juicier? technicality meat did fall off bone but felt moisture more coming sauce  mother ordered ribs no sauce she could add own selection sauces table looked bit dry me  Next time might try well because original sauce came mine became little overpowering while  sides reasonable  Mac cheese bit kick spice which appreciated corn cob didn't seem super fresh but liked two halves! Yum! Lastly personally love corn bread all shapes forms muffin came meal perfection  slightly toasted muffin top super soft moist rest it    All all place doesn't amaze but does job  BBQ spot hearty servings reasonable price  $13 99 plate left stuffed leftovers later  never run into issues service last visit waitress really great attentive  Enjoy dig <EOR> I love BBQ bomb com  would recommend spot anyone  Best food place Reno Las Vegas  <EOR> Good Chain BBQ   Much better Memphis BBQ but still place pit back   food always consistent good   servers always seem having good time   prefer eat bar area no children tents bit quieter easier talk  <EOR> Ah Famous Dave's  ask Dave's famous for? Is architecture? Can't outside place looks Pizza Hut meets Red Lobster circa 1978   Is decor? unless awards Bass Pro Shops Cracker Barrel or TGI Fridays mash up  Was hostess? Maybe greeted promptly immediately offered booth bar  When declined said preferred table led opposite side building offered table instead standing six inches when booth offered  hostessing either  I know menu Dave's famous menu looks good tries promote food laid well      wait last lie     Not menu  Hmmmmm       this allegedly restaurant maybe just maybe food Dave's rightly famous for! Alas no  The food abysmal miserable put kindly  My wife each ordered two meat lunch special which your choice two meat substances single side item  Now mere $2 49 order additional side item which gamely did most places decent side items especially BBQ joints  Well surprise unfortunately  asked ribs brisket fries cole slaw  red blooded American wouldn't love that? Unfortunately would one  teriyaki beef jerky disguised brisket TWO count them TWO measly ribs  brisket probably cooked correctly some point life but time presented no longer identifiable  But hungry jaws needed circuit training chewed come think two hours later am still chewing least piece  ribs greasy name all holy smoking hell ribs greasy? Famous Dave's staff wear shirts cute little slogans Good BBQ all smoke beers news think enough beers going cover lack good smoke  While am talking lunch let also touch slaw don't just don't  fries edible if unseasoned any way  tried all sauces hoping something would improve Rocky Horror BBQ show plate but can't stress bad were  seriously think bought cheapest BBQ stuff could find food4less some other high quality dings dents grocers put just enough habanero sauce call something else  received better BBQ sauces Del Taco chicken fingers  Then when thought things couldn't any worse looked see chicanery pulled blushing bride celebrating glories own birth  She gamely ordered chicken brisket slaw mashed potatoes  description chicken bad edible Wow screaming endorsement someone call papers!
