[Edited add] Second time around completely ignored  Even though 3 servers walking us making eye contact acted if there  Finally good 10 20 mins servers came only tell kitchen closed  First all why even poster around entire restaurant which states happy hour until 1AM  around 12 30AM   Yeah if guys didn't ignore maybe kitchen wouldn't closed?

Sold!!    2017 Yelp Review #9 <EOR> Ive ones LA but Vegas location fairly new  great time general manager above beyond sure friends good time  Referred smooth japanese whisky food speaks itself  enjoyed duck breast beef tongue  Im regular now <EOR> Already filed complaint through corporate website but write order let everyone know bad experience was  first time but last weekend visited Gyu 2 other friends only find favorite bbq spot definitely gone downhill  want complain server he great Dalvin  However food good marinades evenly distributed fried appetizers just cooked right hard cold  experience good used soon walked in  seated female staff did greet smile us  She just cold look when seated table dirty  booth food debris all over tongs dirty well sure check tongs see no food left inside them 2 3 table dirty  sauce pans did seem clean either  Later server busy another table grabbed person seemed manager turns staff seated us name JJ shew manager duty she said  She attitude whole time she handling need  simply wanted order couple more items but she said server table soon she just manager   Does really matter takes order? Specially when manager? would understand if she hostess something else does associate menus but isn't she manager? felt she said something very irresponsible   wanted complain all comments am jotting down right now but friends said probably even worth someone definitely does seem care did not    If food still same environment would mind coming back  However far experience just absurd doubt if would come back  many new spots opening great barbeque reasonable price mention gyu kaku copycats  don't know if place such customer service would able assist customers' needs properly  <EOR> Came triple date coworkers   My bf ended getting Meat Lovers combo others la carte items  All courses 20% off weekends helped    Everything course bad esp when dipped sweet soy sauce chili ponzu sauce  sukiyaki bibimbap tasty very large clay bowl  coworker's wife bacon bibimbap all thought going actual bacon bit but actually cubed pork belly looked really good! course she liked lot    The cool thing app download free food  When your receipt scan code enter code displayed bottom your receipt  Every $1 spent 2 points  also 10% off when create account well extra 50 points    The only thing bummed didn't know locals discount until received email Valentine's Day meal courses  Locals 10% off  sure let them know next time    The waiter also attentive  Always came back see if wanted order anything else refill water  <EOR> I really lunch specials here   If upgrade bibimbap really lot food money   fun experience cooking your own food but certainly isn't everyday lunch   Service generally quick but still takes bit longer most lunch places due self cooking style it   good meats think favorites sides   Cheesy corn mushrooms stood me   would see more curated options available   often option paralysis staring menu  <EOR> The food really delicious  server Yoshi informative gave such great service! He very passionate accommodating  lil pricy side but quality meat matches price  tapas style  Everything tasty! ambience also nice! only thing macaron ice cream hard bite! ice cream frozen served right away  would def back again! <EOR> Well comes atypically fuzzy review me     I haven't tried Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ until now  available back California open Vegas over year now but never drew attention until some friends agreed dinner destination   We waited until 9 00pm start happy hour also available all day Mondays Wednesdays daily noon 6 30pm go  reservation although didn't look very busy  decor welcoming place very clean perhaps owing somewhat self vacuuming grill helping keep restaurant patrons' clothing free residual meat smells  confess super tired during meal can't focus more thing kinda way but really don't remember hearing any music whatsoever being played  Maybe soft drowned conversation?  I deferred someone else orders a la carte course didn't much whiff receipt won't able comment much specific dishes would like  approach ended being tasting because shared portions five instead just two three definitely don't afraid duplicate orders larger groups   Miso soup $0 99 happy hour $1 95 regular standard miso soup but even small bowl relative bargain during happy hour  if don't flat hate miso soup   Gyu Kaku Salad $5 50 HH $6 50 reg don't even wanna know half order looks like  Even considering modest split portion seems small dish isn't especially memorable even though good time  Skip this   Fried Chicken Karaage $3 95 $4 95 actually several dishes even more deeply discounted during Super Happy Hour 11pm but no way waiting long  best appetizer sampled tonight rich creamy sauce balanced squeeze lemon   Fried Calamari $4 95 $5 95 skip this  squid boring slightly rubbery  absolutely nothing special it  pricier less impressive version karaage since comes same sauce lemon   Pork Gyoza Dumplings $3 50 $4 95 also skip  good but unmemorable similar extent salad   Corn w cheese $3 95 pretty good maybe worth price  love corn but start question your sanity prices veggies   part appeal AYCE joints which example feel still your veggies while maintaining value  But note would zucchini $2 95 again if Super Happy Hour most likely normal corn $1 99   I won't pretend know all meats especially considering friend ended cooking distributing everything on note posting any grill meats photos but absolutely certain Toro Beef beef bacon $3 95 $4 95 rockstar dish sure Yaki Shabu beef chuck roll same price previous item Angus Beef Ribs ditto price also delicious  Although ponzu spicy sauce separately combination probably your mainstays believe beef ribs somehow worked especially well sweet soy sauce  Just sure rely sauces fill flavor because ain't no Korean BBQ joint   It wasn't all sunshine rainbows though  Duck breast $6 95 $7 95 beef tongue w scallion sauce $8 95 both notably underwhelming  Actually don't even remember amidst confusion which piece duck breast  beef tongue meat itself fine but scallion sauce didn't much me  Maybe expected little more cooked buttery but just seemed raw but cook wire mesh? therefore place   Lastly dessert bit downer  macaron ice creams decent but worth $5  liked green tea ice cream inside strawberry shell also mango  didn't enjoy taro shell w vanilla much   All all enjoyed most meats happy hour pricing pretty nice would consider trying Gyu Kaku again  change carnivorous pace KBBQ places  <EOR> My brother ordered gyu kaku course delicious  Didn't really think it'd enough both but ended getting food coma if all eat kbbq  Starting appetizers everything flavorful  end wondering just good next course be  Photos attached but tbh excited eat did take many wanted beginning   As service believe counted around 5 came asking if needed anything most polite manner    The interior beautiful extracting older Japanese themes modern touch  experience seems very worthy 5 star rating given  would note price higher your average casual dinner but worth both experience food  <EOR> This place great! Happy hour prices beyond reasonable  very clean establishment good music  offers good variety beers different menu options  staff very friendly  server Yoshi let tell Yoshi THEBOMB COM definitely coming back! <EOR> I've always enjoyed gyu kaki ever since first time tried Hawaii back high school     We ordered beef tongue garlic shrimp spinach garlic awesome yaki shabu miso harami skirt steak miso Kali short rib sukiyaki bibimbap assorted appetizers boy did eat lot!!!  They ran scallops tofu nuggets bad!  Service five starts    Very happy return  Thanks gyu kaku team! <EOR> It bit pricy opinion compared other Korean bbqs town we did come happy hour considering Gyu Kaku does AYCE  Said perhaps month two  good  But restaurant laid beautifully crowded great atmospheric lighting  staff seems pretty great well  55$ meat lovers course 2 came lottttt think price worth it  <EOR> I'm obsessed  All day happy hour Monday's Wednesday's  food great drinks cheap    Make sure app great deals!

Well whichever was   it anticlimatic me  husband's review wasn't bad   offered internal organs course he'll such opinion    We came Tuesday long opened  Immediately greeted   check  Seated   check  completely excited look over menu especially since happen arrive during Happy Hour  some reason still can't figure happy hour menu wasn't impressive  suppose because food itself wasn't    ME Fusion edamame garlic seasoned edamame Spicy Tuna Volcano crispy rice spicy tuna top Beef tacos won ton wrapper fried into taco shape bulgogi squeezed in Miso Butterfish butterfish miso sauce pepper wrapped foil simply toss onto grill HUSBAND Tako wasabi  Liver waiter said pork liver Beef Toro Spicy Tuna Volcano Miso Butterfish  US 2 Kirin beer  There nothing spicy even tuna dish  crispy rice seemed more flavor spicy tuna  jazz made rain bottle some sauce table labeled spicy  But wasn't spicy all    I love offer sweet potatoe FRIES  Having some kind finger food 9months old grasp keep occupied immediate thumber upper me   Miso Butterfish alright  sauce steams very light taste which good thing such fish   small piece fish thankfully wasn't small thin piece   Nothing spectacular  Since love eating fish still appreciated it    The beef tacos weren't anything spectacular either  Maybe if slid 2 more pcs wouldve said deeelish! Just wasnt enough bite thoroughly assess  little expensive happy hour not  Man starting think came way hungry    Can't review liver don't eat stuff  Husband said twas alright  He did note Tako wasabi favorite thought twas pretty good  if into raw stuff just may your deal   The beef Toro didn't look fresh   freshly frozen   freshly defrosted frozen   freshly flashed frozen? Whichever   just didn't nice color meat way accustomed seeing Gangnam  marinated something but upon eating couldn't even taste out    Prices alright considering happy hour  think overly excited head perhaps expecting more  would probably come again just give another shot  Maybe during time when didnt just open   maybe food needed time marinate longer?   The best part meal 1 99 kirin beer fusion edamame which small bowl almost 4bucks husband's Tako small bowl for almost 4 bucks   spent 55 bucks which walked wishing just AYCE sushi even less    enjoyed vibe restaurant being well ventilated  couple times waiter lagged service  nearly done eating time he brought beer out  suppose since noon weekday nowhere go   we didn't really care much  Sometimes just laying back having urgency anything soothing nerves  Aside overall service great super friendly   Again I'd come back   maybe less hungry too  Sometimes hunger change your palate sure  But now don't feel missing life if never did return    Definitely kid stroller friendly!
