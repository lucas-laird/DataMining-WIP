I quick lunch waiting longish line fairly unenthusiastic  Then figured probably going bland lunch when didn't Del's lemonade advertise board  did bode well! gave number sat down brought over deli sandwich pretty quickly such bad start tuna salad freshest bagel ever made it  chips weren't homemade but least nicer store brand  Plus while seems pricey bagel scoop tuna portion very friendly  <EOR> Bad coffee  only plus convenience if stayed hotel  I'd rather walk mc donalds <EOR> Very unhappy bagels which tasted day old bagels we're toasted  Brought them back refund <EOR> The coffee terrible bagels nothing special service beyond slow  Maybe just used pulling Dunkin Donuts back east watching them blow through line 10 people nothing but supposed quick breakfast run before hitting strip turned into lesson Vegas need wait line everything   <EOR> Delicious bagels great variety bagels spreads reasonable prices  <EOR> Not worth wait  Better places nearby if your willing walk  recommend going elsewhere <EOR> Expensive terrible food  cinnamon bun way dry way sweet  scrambled eggs very dense even powdered eggs which were  Coffee worse Starbucks which saying lot  Okay second thought maybe wasn't worse Starbucks but pretty darn close  Never again  <EOR> CHEAP YUMMY! LOVE COFFEE here  WAY BETTER ANY other coffee place EVER been  used called Boyd's Barista  only other place know where some Boyd's coffee  Antique Row San Diego  SMOOTH FLAVORFUL! wish made more places would blow STARBUCKS water ANYDAY! But most coffee places already <EOR> I came 7am breakfast  freshly made but means 10 min wait egg cheese ham toasted breakfast bagel?! almost finished coffee time order ready  only 3 customers ahead me  Imagine place would lunchtime?  The service pretty stern hour morning except lady made effort greet people smile send them way  But lady handles order delivery customers fierce! <EOR> We needed quick breakfast before checking Circus Circus ran down Barista Bagels  OK line fairly long didn't help much guy front list he ordering half dozen other people  can't blame establishment that   So  Barista pretty good selection muffins Danish fruit cups but main claim fame name implies bagels  BLT club tuna salad beef cheddar etc  breakfast bagel egg cheese choice bacon ham sausage  opted sausage patty  Drinks? Well regular soft drinks coffee cappuccino latte' cafe' au lait    And snagged nice big pecan roll sandwich  Pretty good stuff if don't time or room! big breakfast want something better Egg McMuffin  <EOR> I stayed Circus Circus saw coupon free coffee  serve breakfast bagels  decided give place try   The location tucked back upstairs promenade near carnival area   It very bad location  tucked back hard time finding place   I huge line find only cashier attending several people line 30 people line  very long wait   I stood line which felt forever then second cashier opened up  Well though myself well cool rocking now  Wrong!  I second line cashier told older lady minuet   She rude looked down   hummm   She came back register 5 minuets later told ahead your order   She very rude if she does job then she should find something new    I walked over coffee thought myself worst over  Wrong!  They ran coffee ran creamer  filled another 20 minuets later    I breakfast then tried leave but couldn't   only small entrance front imagine carrying large duffel back through crowd 20 people     It difficult place!   Are worried someone running off coffee? need open place loose cage feeling    They good concept bagel sandwich bad    I won't back wait could better sit down meal somewhere else  <EOR>
