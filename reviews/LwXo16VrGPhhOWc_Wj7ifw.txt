Great first impression OM   Well done  <EOR> My son last week lunch   great another Indian Nepalese option side Vegas   more fast food establishment adequate seating   Good variety both vegetarian non vegetarian dishes   customer service great willing spice dishes upon request   found some dishes little mild taste but overall price relatively cheap quality pretty good  <EOR> Apparently don't work Saturdays   came twice Saturdays both times posted sign door  closed  <EOR> I surprised see fast food type Indian food place   food good first didn't think portions going enough but full when finished  would return again some point   prefer buffet style Indian restaurants where choose your menu items back if desired  <EOR> Tried place using groupon  don't live area don't know if able use all groupons  According lady only use time  food very good  definitely must try if area  <EOR> Delicious food great prices!  I Thali 1 plate which includes 2 entrees side $6 99  chose chili chicken lamb vindaloo entrees naan side  spicy food entrees both considered medium hot which why picked them  dishes did little kick them more chili chicken but would preferred little more heat  But looking past flavors spot on! sauce lamb extremely flavorful great soaking naan  also little taste friends' plates chicken tikka masala chicken karahi I'd order them both future  said only gripe spiciness  Since aren't many dishes spicy wish could choose spiciness level many other Indian restaurants offer  Oh well!   As atmosphere place VERY casual  Just booths mostly blank walls occasional random wall hanging  clearly don't care decor but don't long continue serve quality food! <EOR> Being Indian know good Indian food tastes place pretty darn good!  customer service great  would definitely come back again  <EOR>
