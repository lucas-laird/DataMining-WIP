If come afternoon spend $600 drinks appetizers while seated exclusive entrees only dining area     count your blessings!  Even when area empty hours usually force sit drinks appetizers only section!  Next time ask if am having meal just say yes!!  I understand keeping seats available dinner guest but application idea totally messed up   When house empty seven people want sit normal damn chairs apps drinks     Accommodate them!

Expect full without breaking your wallet badly   Very unique Strip experience  <EOR> This place great location right next few showrooms Venetian  Formal casual you  Staff awesome wine great food good well  <EOR> I wish places would catch wildfire across country point where overtake Starbucks  Maybe day      I can't say place you'd your way when Vegas     but might walk nearby hotels here   If love beer can't much better  selection insane prices reasonable   The food really surprised me  place focused beer might just phone food selections  But place some great stuff   Poutine Really delicious loads flavor  could used touch more duck though  sauce really salty point last 5 bites saline point pain  But other delicious hedonistic way   Burger REALLY wanted love but only liked it  mean Guinness aioli? sounds deliciously brilliant  burger just much going though  need lose couple ingredients  But still good sure   We also pickles which surprisingly tasty   The only major problem sheer lack velocity  Everything happens really slow  Now say waiter AWESOME  He knew ins outs drinks food  He kept eye funny boot  But just such massive lag your food absurd  place grab quick bite  If stay Bellagio Palazzo then owe yourself try place  Just don't if you're hurry  <EOR> I don't know why other reviewers rated 3 5 lower service smooth professional food very well prepared interesting  The potato twisters duck confit excellent  other dishes had  Ribeye truffle potatoes fish chips <EOR> Came only beer Sunday night   they plenty beer choose bar barely full when here   bartenders very welcoming see beer menu iPad!  kind cool although sure update if kegs gets changed?

Regardless beer cicerone able help pick something comparable  many canned beers which take pride in  did do? Ordered canned beer  Why not it's Vegas   Had Poutine appetizer which enough person's entree thin seasoned fries duck confit thick cheese curds sunny side egg gravy waiter poured dishin person table  He even asked if ready which spooked little uh ready what? friends THE  BEST  POUTINE  Everything perfect especially spooky gravy  also hard find poutine stateside quality cheese curds   Entree version Chicken Quail Waffles buttermilk fried quail waffles served greens lemongrass butter Moose Drool a brown ale Montana syrup     good but great  think just wanting fried chicken waffles fight quail bones no fault theirs  For and your finale Chocolate Stout Layer Cake Malted milk ice cream caramelized bacon rice crispies  honest only ONLY reason this? see bacon crispies tasted like  already full food beer  knew chocolate cake going rich decadent yes crispies did indeed taste bacon   I waddled back Caesar's happy man  <EOR> We town long weekend reading other reviews decided stop dinner some good beer following Blue Man Group   After being seated having all 2 minutes peruse extensive beer list menu server stops fails introduce himself asks if ready order he never discusses specials meanwhile table next fabulous server   He seemed irritated wanted few more minutes consider options  ordering beers dinner didn't see server again   octopus which nicely prepared   wife crab salad description indicated served avocado   avocado deep fried WTF?  reason don't cook avocado tastes terrible!    As beers empty server never offered another round ask dessert options!  WTF though Vegas service oriented town  dinner more drinks elsewhere     The concept good but execution poor   Maybe bad draw server but certainly think carefully whether return next time town  <EOR> Not impressed service food  glasses smelled wet dog  shellfish seafood platter subpar Brussels sprouts no bacon weren't even seasoned grilled chicken sandwich funny taste  top waiter seemed annoyed working  BUT if want some good French fries check place out  <EOR> Just ok  food subpar but service ok  octopus appetizer which rubber  also Caesar lobster mac cheese  size Caesar laughable crispy pig ears good all  Tough chewy  filet mignon ok but definitely better  recommended  <EOR> This super hard give two stars but think truth  good things dry aged ribeye great cooked perfectly! beer jam Manhattan little sweeter version Manhattan delicious! But wrong sides moms dish  ordered 3 sides Brussels sprouts truffles mashed potato beer cheese bread  mashed potato beer cheese beard came cold  beer cheese wasn't horrible but sent potatoes back  Then moms entree sea bass last served when she cut open still raw  restaurant did mom new plate took while though removed moms drinks dish check but didn't seem enough  wait food long closed restaurant  still sitting restaurant when flipped all lights on  Kind ticked off but hurried mom finish drink out  Even food being good doesn't mean fall short other areas menu  why give two stars   <EOR> We visited place while business conference  Since place conveniently located Sand's Expo ended going twice   1st visit bar area drinks check menu dinner  Service slow disorganized  Limited menu again bad service compared other similar establishments  Drinks overpriced would never recommend place   2nd visit service just awful dining area some dishes didn't arrive despite chasing  food below average best but prices Vegas high! Every course meal just greasy     Over all atmosphere boring whole place reminded chain restaurant Tuesday's  many good choices LV Palazzo general would suggest going elsewhere  <EOR> The Venetian     expect good food   delivered most part   wouldn't say MUST restaurant   However combined great service entree particular appetizer IT    place come relax just before long night LV   The appetizer won heart pig's tail   Wow   tender soft full flavor crispy sweet outside   Simply best pig part tasted Western style cooking perspective   So    say again IT!  The other dishes decent    though underwhelmed poutine   I'd skip one   roasted bone marrow     excellent   good texture freshly cooked   short rib tender soft   sea bass good but personally little buttery me   If into very buttery dishes though then dish get   The desserts really good   chocolate stout cake croissant bread pudding   both sweet but overwhelmingly so   The presentation service both excellent well   restaurant touts itself casual    but think nice place where take your girl guy date   Anyway    give try!  Remember pig's tail! <EOR> Slow service but good beer selection  Hard conversation given noise level  Good spot decompression but business chat  <EOR> I friend both excited try because menu looked great   Unfortunately everything came cold  came really fast but cold  Poutine bad cheese hardened sent back  second Poutine warm cheese rock but really only Mussels enjoyable  really wanted hear but food mediocore  <EOR> Would honor coupons  If don't want talked down guy serves drinks living don't come here  <EOR> The Hostess beyond rude   We party three when into restaurant hostess rudely asking where wanted seat then she stated just sit anywhere  She didn't provide any menu's while sitting 15 minutes  server finally came ask menus    The food drinks bad but overall experience very poor due lack customer service    We felt very discriminated because another couple came right hostess gave them menus water them drink while sat just waiting someone provide menu water    Please provide better customer service your Customers because  look when Restaurant  am very disappointed service provided  <EOR> We wondered lunch based concierge's recommendation  meal late lunch objective excellent service light fare fast   I ordered Kale salad chicken share Ahi Tartare  very creative presentation poke style very fresh ahi kumquats jalapeno beer soy glaze wasabi tobiko greens radish  OMG excellent!!!

We checking Venetian Palazzo hunger suddenly hit  Most restaurants pretty quiet bit late lunch   browsed few storefronts before deciding Public House  Perhaps drawn into dim lighting hip Americana decor  sat plush booth server greeted right away  She very friendly inviting   I already eyeballed Chicken Sandwich menu just order it  grilled chicken breast topped sliced ham grain mustard cheese  Perfect texture delicious! Paired good ol' natural cut fries  All around very good   I say really happy Public House  I'd even say favorite meal whole trip  even tolerated cheesy humor restroom walls  sure find your way Venetian if want check place out! <EOR> Go poutine herb fries! Yum    Btw fois gras here    Oh yes very nice friendly severs  <EOR> The place good  great but good  expecting lot since some amazing public houses around world  However doing right  few small things could fix but nothing distract pleasant evening place  <EOR> I looking something different eat during weekend trip Vegas   came across Groupon place   checked menu online thought worth try   I disappointed!  ordered Bone Marrow appetizer which still sizzling when brought table   bacon marmalade grilled bread accompanied both yummy   My husband ordered pub burger   huge looked juicy   He said very good but did try because busy swooning over Scallops ordered myself   3 jumbo scallops seared perfection atop shredded oxtail stew touch matchstick potatos top it   only complaint scallops portion small   I loved decor staff friendly without being intrusive   signs hallway leading bathroom actual bathroom stalls quirky cute     The only reason am giving them 5 stars because end meal took them awhile only check but pick payment then return back us   usually don't complain if busy but many people dining time   Kudos Chef Anthony Meidenbauer! <EOR> The best steak Mom's years! Mom Dad excellent food beer cocktails  10 10 would come eat again  Great service everything AMAZING!!! must visit Venetian any trip Vegas  Well worth price  <EOR> Absolutely amazing appetizers dinners beer selection!

Dr  green Thumb vodka sauvignon blanc lime drink tart interesting  We loved apple crisp dessert chocolate stout cake all right  We thrilled find locals could 20% discount! The manager servers waitstaff very attentive  <EOR> Visited Public House again but time hung lovely lounge enjoying sights suds   It's hard choose beer!

chest hanging out  just weird little bit  just didn't sense remember other visits Public House  She beautiful girl just looked uncomfortable wielding food booze around restaurant dressed that  big deal just mention  just kind gave more trashy vibe  just weird  think since she's beautiful professional she would still look great more clothing perhaps more comfortable work    If sofa mirror table would suggest towards front  really fun comfortable  dinner more intimate yet relaxed  <EOR> If looking quick fast food kind dinner inside Luxor to  food reasonably priced restaurant inside Las Vegas hotel strip  chicken sandwich spring mix sald delicious heavy  service also pretty quick  other sandwiches they're fine  Overall solid dinner choice  <EOR> We high expectations place reading many rave reviews  Waiting until last minute redeem Groupon headed Public House last night  bit wait  place quite crowded Tuesday evening  finally seated greeted warmly server    We perused drink menu quite some time before deciding drinks evening  no easy feat enormous beer wine mixed drink selection options have  ordered Blonde fella decided Banana Bread beer  drinks came everyone kept raving Banana Bread beer being favorite  wanted nothing since don't smell banana but fella quite excited  He tasted look face he no impressed everyone else seemed be  drink other hand amazing  fella even admitted mine far superior his  Haha  eventually did try Banana Bread beer curiosity although wasn't favorite beer ever but wasn't bad    For food shared few small plates  bone marrow bacon wrapped figs grilled octopus  admit items ordered didn't blow away but see potential food front  octopus little fishier used guess hoping chewier texture  just little different octopus used to  bacon wrapped figs weren't favorite mine either  dressing just overwhelmingly sweet wished bacon just little crispier add less mushy texture whole dish  bone marrow probably favorite  fatty fuil flavor  definitely impressed restaurant overall look forward going back trying number other beers offer  also interested quite few more options food menu think hold potential    The best part dining experience service  deciding factor between giving place 3 4  waiter busboy incredibly attentive every server brought drink plate table made pleasant conversation great attitude  top all off great conversation restaurant
