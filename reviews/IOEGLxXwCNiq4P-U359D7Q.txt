Nice ! off restaurant pick up    This restaurant located northeast ish side 'The Lakes'  midly hidden even shopping center in  Since 5 minutes away sat restaurant maybe 10 minutes before pizza  Fairly point estimation ! Thanks ! restaurant itself really small  Maybe room think 2 tables some chairs  Rest kitchen    So onto food  Both times gotten Italian White Pie listed under 'Specialty House Pie' category  Italian White Pie includes ricotta mozzarella broccoli rabe sausage garlic carmelized onions white pizza  white pizza using usual tomato sauce but white cream sauce probably similar alfredo sauce  cream cheese based    The first time 'Italian White Pie' awkwardly mildly salty  Which surprising pizza  decided give another try time PERFECT ! Crust nice thin but crispy  Good amounts ricotta mozzarella which gave nice amount creaminess cheesiness  sausage thinly cut more then pebble worth each slice  Carmelized onions add such nice savoriness sweetness overall  Next time something i'd change EXTRA GARLIC ! yeah just love garlic  why more garlic?! mmm hehe maybe onions too  broccoli rabe adds nice green color crispness all aside crust since everything else nice soft    The italian white pie just good dont know if try anything else  just love everything ! Maybe if throw some peppers give nice spicy kick then would 100% <EOR> I Big Sexy pizza other day freakin awesome!!! patient recommended try point!!

I ordered Big Pie Meat Pie which excellent!  meatballs sliced way meatball slices bigger most places Pepperoni   only but taste great well   bacon tasty fatty regular bacon be   size pizza worth price!  I also ordered Regular Pie custom because pizza sauce try Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce   First off Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce awesome!  gives nice burn without overpowering pizza taste   added meatballs pepperoni broccoli rabe pizza sauce   Everything well ingredients   If issue pizza could used bit more sauce only because loved sauce    Their cheesesteak which ordered ribeye onions white american cheese better cheesesteaks had   Very tasty right amount cheese meat   bread soft middle nice crust without hardness found ends lot french bread   I also tried 3 cheese fries which interesting because cheeses used   sure which cheeses but guessing whiz mozzarella cheddar?  Even still fries tasty filling   a meal unto itself!  The price bit higher standard pizza chains but quality pizza cheesesteaks ingredients well worth money   Plus dollar delivery fee plus!   definitely recommend Those Guys Pies order again soon!
