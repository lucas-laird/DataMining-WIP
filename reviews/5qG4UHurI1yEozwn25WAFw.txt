At first all kept thinking show Black where complete certain tasks total darkness  signed waiver even though assured none would served pretty much told myself going eat bunch live bugs dark    I very relieved nothing ate contained any live bugs once calmed nerves the music helped afraid dark found myself really enjoying whole experience  Eating complete darkness really perks your senses fun trying figure eating    I think those 'bucket list' things everyone must experience least once  <EOR> Went whim locking something different date night   Great concept   little bit ambient light exit sign night vision worn staff but certainly can't see traditional sense   Options food somewhat limited prepared your fingers dirty!

What wasn't fan price all vegetarian meal  surprise date me didn't check Yelp know getting into    apparently customer ask food even though some questions never disclosed menu all vegetarian definitely avoided subject  opposed vegetables    but five courses them bit much if paying around $70 person I'd rather fewer courses meat vegetarian option  Most dishes tasted fine  Some courses enjoyed better others  dessert bit generic but tasted good    I don't know if there's philosophy behind outwardly claiming strict vegetarian menu but found odd  Overall I'd try again if ever decide adjust menu  <EOR> I'm sure if flavor profile food entirely fault however times tasted processed  understand safety concerns can't any real protein but meat patty served main entree edible  entire dinner quoted 45 75 minutes while actually 90 105 minutes  made incredibly late show attending evening budgeted time based incorrect information receptionist  Additionally 90 minutes pitch black room ideal experience group  <EOR> I came group 12 friends experience  4 course lunch menu  picked savory    They walk group holding shoulder shoulder table  Once enter really pitch black nothingness  You're extremely vulnerable need rely your server    It definitely experience think everyone  willing try should try    I found myself using hands feel plate before using fork  really difficult figuring if ate all food whether dropped lap  quite cold restaurant maybe bring light sweater if cold easily    It's interesting trying figure your food relying merely your taste touch scent    My favorite dish last course  Since supposed mystery won't ruin guesses  Overall different experience  basically you're paying for  food meh  But service good  pretty full end  sure if they've enhanced menu more filling but group full    Would come back again? Probably not  food wasn't screaming amazing but experience great! <EOR> Yes knew all plant based vegan before absolutely loved it!  intrigue mystery eclectic environment made very relaxing enjoyable evening!  food mysteriously delicious top off VERY HEALTHY!!  loved plan returning next time Vegas  very few cool surprises left your life      Give try!! <EOR> The dine in the dark experience Blackout very memorable! team lunch service pleasantly surprised just much enjoyed experience  waiter Anthony patient kind acclimated total darkness  He did fantastic job describing surroundings before each course  food AMAZING staff paid close attention dietary restrictions  change menu every three months can't wait back more <EOR> We just experienced Blackout Dining Dark! see your hand front your face dark  trip! food all plant based but very very good  6 course meal things would probably tried if could seen known before eating it  But surprisingly good would highly recommend trying least once!

Once asked sign legal disclaimer as expected      then offered drink menu where order some specialty cocktails   time    escorted Ashley perfect blackout dining virgins   She funny really took time explain everything each step way    held shoulders boy held mine way    It's dark guys     fun date experience worked together try each other's drinks talk thought eating    Oh yes important fact tell menu until end    doesn't matter because food delicious   Nothing made happier finding deposit food missed plate    laughed entire time truly enjoyed experience   meat eaters adjust your own expectation down bit    isn't steak house but really great plant based food   I think bit pricer   could maybe 10 15% cheaper but no regrets    told change menu every couple months definitely back    those interested 2 2 alcoholic beverages ran $240    lunch well which little less expensive    also currently Groupon which save some money if schedule advance     I highly recommend trying least once! <EOR> Incredible evening!!! food service outstanding  Very unique dining experience  did know expect but pleasantly surprised pleased evening  Well worth price  food delicious flavorful  waiter extremely attentive funny  Eating dark such unique experience  would recommend everyone can't wait back!!! <EOR> Great dining experience  Food delicious  Tiki waiter amazing very engaged amusing  Ask him!! <EOR> I consider myself pretty adventurous person thought would perfect birthday dinner husband    Our server Chris he did excellent job    There two things realized    1  made dine dark  2  definitely vegan  I'm all paying experience but sure $200 experience  I'm foodie just couldn't into   near gourmet any kind way   Portions probably more suitable kid   really liked salad   All 4 bites lol    appreciate offer free bottle wine your birthday   showed ID upon check in  When bill bill asked   girl told she wasn't checked she needed see ID again   Better communication between staff would plus   sewer smell lobby area definitely turn off when eat meal   All all cool concept   Something should definitely try least once   <EOR> Chalk experience more anything   being lead table through room pitch black couldn't see hand front face figuring eating undeniably fun   No phones no nothing   group another table likened being SHU Orange New Black anyone?    But idea heighten one's other senses while sitting through 6 course plant based meal   If you're complaining no meat menu try dealing bunch people holding sharp steak knives darkness   All servers wore night vision goggles does anyone else automatically think Silence Lambs too? which helped tremendously when trying find utensil wine glass   admittedly gave during some courses hand mouth just because easier   any patrons could see eat rudely P     I won't into food since revealing would ruin lot but surprised far off guessing eaten   wasn't until end shown full menu which did garner some laughs   All items generally decent       The only real downer price tag which around $80 per person without drinks   mean   these people making killing!  save money electricity didn't need interior designer could probably away mismatched silverware don't use any fancy ingredients     I lucky enough BOGO but despite fun would rather wear blindfold or just take glasses off? Indian restaurant   Even all still look evening fondly   if you're looking unique date night literally blind date funny group outing just want spoil special vegetarian your life still worth considering  <EOR> As fourth time going already knew expect! husband 1 year wedding anniversary no other romantic place could choose from    We both Vegan knew would getting amazing food    That case hostess asked if special occasion did mention anniversary but no acknowledgement anniversary    We cool because same sex couple understand people may react  also shocked bottle service going $35 which more expensive bottle wine served  should first sign actually leaving    When waitress came she made comment small attitude call two topper but multiple two topper which mine    The waitress provided wonderful service but didn't sub par quality food    The first entree waitress ahead said may already which did already disappointed  know menu changes every couple months last time back August 2017  2nd entree very disappointing if restaurant didn't know just scrapped couple things together served  third entree used gardein products extremely disappointed prior time able put together meal delicious having use palette    The fourth entree ok wasn't anything fancy  fifth entree definitely huge disappointment veggies under cooked starch over cooked fake meat once again came again  dessert came good  first last dish probably only thing real enjoyed restaurant    Upon paying bill extremely shocked price another $20 per person which understand if high demand restaurant gotta gotta but least meal worth $80 per person  don't think coming back again  <EOR> Such great experience! Food secretly delicious  It's amazing human body does when lose sense  great fun place try  <EOR> My 9 year old son really fun dinner here  eating adventure mysteriousness made great experience child  He thought really cool  restaurant would great date try giving kiss pitch black hilarious easy you'd think!

All 4 thought food disgusting   $300+ would much better spent same setting darkness being used show people dinner use time family bonding looking your phone eating food prefer some Vegan agenda    arrived 2 hours before show   ended having rush last 3 courses barely made show  <EOR> WARNING NO MEAT   Okay very mixed review me  First let start saying employees absolutely wonderful customer service received far surpassed all expecations made experience incredibly enjoyable evening    Next review experience itself something simple eating dark  actually really fun unique everyone party really great time  lock your phone and anything else creates light locker which really cool lets enjoy people with  only real way describe experience none other ever tried    Now cons falls most important section restaurant food  Heres where everything very downhill very quickly why most likely returning  Apparently entire menu all Vegan Vegetarian which unaware because posted anywhere location advertisement saw website led restaurant no indication  ended paying somewhere between $70 $80 tip six courses weekend  Every plate came expecting meat another just more vegetables vegan food  Super dissapointing pay much food really did because no choice since its predetermined selection  did feel food worth money 3 5 people party left hungry food somewhere else already paying $70 each   For cost could Bachannal Buffet Texas de Brazil many other higher end restaurants city where would much better bang your buck terms selection leaving satisfied    Overall sum everything customer service above beyond experience itself really fun unique  But coupled lack meat food variety very overpriced night which left hungry upset paid much essentially some plants sauces  wouldnt nearly upset if noted restaurant somewhere before sat down  Because would just left gone somewhere else prior even getting table  <EOR> Absolutely amazing time! When decide dinner complete darkness should mean you're open experience if you're open no doubt you'll enjoy it  best part food! delicious full flavor despite fact vegan fear won't tasty case  could enjoyed food more server Anthony wonderful! <EOR> Initially super excited try something new except walked dining room conga dance style started question myself   completely dark NO LIGHTS whatsoever   sat eyes closed wondering why hell eyes closed opened eyes relied other senses     Not vegetarian vegan food amazing!! Flavorful smelled amazing   Everything seasoned perfection   able only enjoy delicious food but also lunch date   No cell phone interruptions!!! Amazing concept restaurant   Thank bringing something amazing affordable LV  <EOR> Loved dining here   The sensory experience main appeal but food definitely expectations   work restaurant industry reading many reviews lowered expectations taste whatnot   Definitely didn't need though   Everything super flavorful some more simpler others but perspective serving dishes going eaten pitch black think great menu   Course 3 favorite   left full drink couple local beers pleasant service overall good time    For 6 course prix fixe pace rather quick   think could slowed down just tad allow couple extra minutes between courses though server extremely upbeat fast momentum perhaps style   Pro tip don't afraid eat essentially everything your hands listen when server talks where things located your dish table   Recommend going least once! <EOR> Martha server great  Wily also awesome! whole experience awesome talk through fun  first two courses great  rest courses decent  Orza cocktail point  fabulous time! <EOR> Short review unique experience WAY overpriced food get    Long review no denying unique concept executed well    restaurant exactly says is   meal complete darkness   staff very courteous does excellent job welcoming guests explaining experience guiding through dinner without hurting yourself spilling your drinks   mood music perfectly complements pitch black atmosphere well certain degree worth having experience trying eat complete darkness figure you're tasting    However can't help but feel darkness helps perpetuate fraud   until started reading reviews found place vegan   information never told you   also did ask price just assumed would maybe somewhere $50 $80 range per person   when presented bill over $220 between wife I blown away   mind paying meal if getting some quality food like Kobe beef something    But again all vegetables   no way anyone should need pay much meal consisting all vegetables  main course no kidding risotto sandwich  no point blown away any dishes six course meal   Given dining experience supposed enhance your other senses especially taste would hope would dishes little more inspiring   did not  two other friends all wished burger afterwards     I cannot help but feel place would far more successful earn lot more repeat business if honest its menu pricing least offered non vegan option   Great potential  Mediocre food best   Only worth price if value experience over substance  <EOR> This super fun date night! say unique experience does give justice    You indulge six course meal being served pitch black darkness using only your sense touch taste smell  restaurant adhere any dietary restrictions give them  food provided did require use knife good  Your fork spoon fingers job done!   I think favorite part lock your cell phones watches basically anything might emit light sound locker outside restrooms  keep key you    The servers use your first name each time speak you  inform where things referring time   Example your fork 9 00 your drink 2 00 etc  Rachel Collins cocktail choice very good! provide bib upon entering dining room if want opted totally fine  give free pair sunglasses upon exiting dining room highly recommend take that! Even though evening minimal light entry way felt staring directly into sun!

Seriously place dark  pitch black  store your phones anything else lights like watches locker ensure dining area stays dark  server marched kids single file hands each other's shoulders nice slow  good because really disorienting see NOTHING  But she put ease carefully guiding table helping oriented seated  felt completely safe entire time   She also guided through meal explaining where food dishes served making suggestions could eat it  Expect use your fingers lot! easiest no see anyway  The menu really creative liked most lot  Plant based does mean meatless case didn't catch vegan menu  fun guessing eating end saw menu telling was  most right but all  really interesting using your other senses more noticing cues focus on  although couldn't see dishes appreciated used really interesting shapes  When can't see touch much more important  also good low key music playing entire time   to surprise tuned while friends said highlight putting into almost meditative state    This experience I'd love repeat future  change menu every few months always surprise  much fun! <EOR> The food surprisingly good  basically gave choice sweet savory spicy  6 course meal none which disclosed until very end  dark restaurant can't see your hand front however all waiters waitresses see very well  experience very interesting because must rely your sense smell taste figure eating  also don't know if restaurant clean dump whether dishes clean not  required leave cell phones lighters anything light outside lockers  reveal menu end but left wondering if really ate  Although food pretty good  experience worth time try but price eating better spent high end restaurant Ruth's Chris where see your food your surroundings  2 people paid more couple hundred  Drinks charged separately $65 per person meal  3 beers 2 glasses wine  <EOR> Went couple times already ! love ! Great experience shock your senses   true vegan menu  should deterrent   think skipping meat meal never killed anybody  You'll surprised filling delicious courses are  creativity menu still shines through even total darkness  everywhere else when dine partially pay atmosphere  unforgettable experience  suggest people trust well behaved because darkness does require challenge your trust issues experience something new    last two times menu same  However look forward coming again hopes create something new   only suggestion maybe ask keep track patrons dined before offer something new every time  <EOR>
