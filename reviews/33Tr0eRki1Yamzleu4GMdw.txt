pineapple bun pastry  almond croissant beautifully made  buttery flakey sweet  However little sweet taste buds would probably recommend getting some coffee tea it  crème brulee latte pretty average me  Perhaps because everything sweet coffee just blended everything else  éclair fantastic  three different type fillings vanilla caramel chocolate  vanilla filled really yummy  definitely sweeter side well   On second visit same vanilla filled éclair  Instead almond croissant opted regular croissant  believe better almond version just because sweet all  also grabbed Ouest West sandwich which

YES! would love give pastries attention perhaps try something else   BUT never again sandwich  Why?  The buns use way thick    The hubs met group other foodies brunch  place bookmarked forever but coming north never able just because time constraints opportunity  Opportunity time wasn't problem day   and arrived    Back food  stand line order number seat whatever table suits your interest given its availability  felt standing line forever 3 people ahead but then again   hunger real idk which part doing thinking  finally order tell cashier wanted she then asks show which off menu   crickets    opened menu pointed off her  Nord Est may throw jam danish  Off seats went   Then waited  waited  Those sooner meals finished even go  Kinda awkwardly waiting  But patiently okay! sans kids socializing   im good! But waited  point where person group walked check dishes find just sitting waiting picked served    The sandwiches proved waiting because buns used fricking hard  People couldn't even slice through butter knife without bun shifting cracking  knew cutting through wasn't going work  only hard couldn't even mouth grip thing  Quite frankly seemed more bun nord    Refer pictures better understanding served    On top feel served plate full spring mix  ate sandwich open faced but didn't eat bottom half  Someone joked food being rabbit food because just plate greens  husband's sandwich looked almost worst mine  looked overly toasted burnt   whichever  Again refer pictures    But made through whatever could husband upbringing   finished despite woes  jam danish best part meal beautiful look at   but ended tasting basic  flaky stale way  Sigh if sense  just felt everyone know ten million times such great rave it   but first impression  disappointing   I certainly wouldn't mind trying other things menu  know sure never order sandwich again   id rather opt something else  won't count them out   just place I'd drive across city for  Gatherings not   sure why not    Definitely kid stroller friendly if bringing kids  I'd say leave kids though  Might catch better vibe over pastry latte without 'em   Enjoy! <EOR> I usually come weekend brunch  great place quiet morning meal very simple clean space plenty natural lighting variety areas seating  ham cheese croissant french press  Honestly think food okay also bit pricy portion  But if you're looking healthier alternative place good option  coming more atmosphere menu  <EOR> I truly admire people abstain carbs extended period time   Personally pretty depressed without quality daily dose   Dimmed lights blinds turned sweet sad notes Careless Whisper blaring speakers repeat start sounding Carbless Whisper around 25th time attempt kill myself plastic knife   Fortunately Rosallie offers carbs worthy getting any kind funk   plain croissant simple yet awesome   cherish slightly crispy crunchy ends while middle borderline pornobutterography mouth   In fact created special two course tasting menu only known me   call Les Deux 1  Butter Croissant 2  Almond Croissant  With baked goods needs Le Prozac? <EOR> Great quiet spot breakfast!
