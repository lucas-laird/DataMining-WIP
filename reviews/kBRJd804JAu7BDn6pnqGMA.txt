At point she literally led restaurant if she didnt want other customers hearing conversation   told lady working neighborhood dont all luxury leisurely sit down meal     me hope when begin offering to go u mention sign front because thats only way im coming again <EOR> Vegas doesn't many good breakfast spots at least LA SF when 2 friends said should try it hoped could new fav spot morning meal  neighborhood worth try   We Sat morning 2 people   Atmosphere I am sure why bright like hospital waiting room bright 4  VERY LARGE screen tvs little tacky disruptive you catch them your eye look them waitress next table thinks looking them but am food no accounting taste shrug  place appears clean least   Service We seated promptly drinks ordered twice food came correctly without incident  It only food server asked once if things ok then didn't see again almost 30 minutes  wanted ask why non fat cappucino made barista actualy full fat latte but time she came back see if done needed box check late bother  Plenty other waitresses around no stopped check which taught if another waitress break   Just because someone isn't your table still patrons establishment could your table if come back    Food Nothing write home about  eggs benedict decent omelet wasn't rubbery  Hash browns tasted frozen but edible   We asked specifically coffee sure espresso machine wasn't pod type see Chianti Cafe review assured coffee speciality no ever complains because barista! barista looks 12 years old maybe would first complain but anyone knows cares latte completely different cappucino  live fat vs  non fat mistake but don't milky coffee which $3 75  Blech  Prices A little high $10 each another $3 75 mocha cappucino but line other places to   I would back but only grab pastry try real coffee front which isn't bright *little* more sophistication back all TVs  don't need distracted food thanks   Failing that wouldn't bother  cook home wait see if someone else tries bring LV good morning spot someday  <EOR> Had breakfast morning friend found place great  Excellent fresh coffee food above average breakfast type places  <EOR> Not good others really wanted place kept coming back 4 times see if better didn't     The service sucks others said slow all 4 times  don't know deal seams must hired friends something because don't any idea whats going on   don't know crap food even friendly argument waitress when she told chicken fried steak made chicken before ordered honey am old enough your grandma   Well ordered anyways steak course   Another time asked waitress good she replied am breakfast person f#$%ing kidding me   aren't rude any means but just seams amateur hour     The food isn't good but seems should be   menu some interesting stuff seems use good ingredients but execution sucks   seasoning off raw undercooked pancakes time over cooked dry ones next   burger average potatoes bland fritata ok eggs benedict hollindaise texture firm custard   Again probably some buddies theirs grill great burger 4th july BBQ but does know run kitchen     Lastly place seems real self indulgent huge picture owners family wall small pictures friends family every free piece wall all over restaurant   don't give crap some dude 70's eating pasta news paper clipping guy playing poker 30 years ago while those nice memories all restaurant your den   When first opened owners walked around showing off all pictures seen happen twice standing over people ate customers way real uncomfortable   top both times didn't talk all   Once did pile next booth show off some pictures didn't say word even excuse me   Instead should talking customers figuring save new restaurant   Sorry mack bros hate giving bad reviews especially mom pop places thats why gave guys real fair chance but just isn't doing me  <EOR> We seated very nice hostess friendly recommended few things menu  15 minutes waiting server came took drinks order  She pointed server was  server busy taking order some people sat down 10 min arrived seated  worst part customers ready order server spent 15 minutes explaining menu them  ready leave but gave bit more time  But when she another table other customers sat down did left   We want restaurant well because neighborhood but don't think we'll back  hostess noticed leaving offered give drinks apologetic crappy service  manager saw leaving but didn't seem care    Perhaps server's fault she wasn't aware table station  maybe person took drinks order could've also taken food order  Regardless blame poor management  <EOR> Just second visit Mack Bros weekend  rough start but things getting lot better  think made some changes kitchen something  hash browns now!
