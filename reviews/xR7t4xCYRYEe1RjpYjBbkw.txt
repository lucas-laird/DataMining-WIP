Definitely recommend everyone! Glad found place! <EOR> After discovering once favourite AYCE sushi place changed LOT its policies more expensive more limited menu decided try Tomo Sushi  Upon walking greeted seated almost instantly although take few adjust eyes light coming beautifully sunny outdoors very well lit inside   The waiter very nice asked if before  He explained all aspects AYCE menu items included which items limited quantity per person  He brought waters right away brought extra ginger   Some food seemed bit salty wouldn't any flavor without sauce  Tomo Special soup Kalbi appetizer really good  also blue fin tuna sashimi Wednesday special which also delicious   Their oven broke middle meal  ordered some oven necessary food items unagi baked green mussels informed would take longer usual those come out  asked long said maybe 10 minutes  said fine that  Much later came back said oven needed much longer checking sushi chef could some stuff torch  bit hesitant but boyfriend decided ahead it  sushi came ok slightly charred flavour necessary bad way unagi! But obvious mussels cooked all way however restroom when arrived did chance say anything until bf already tried two them  According extremely chewy inedible he spat them out   brought waiter he said fine didn't finish them wouldn't charged   The sushi chef also changed shifts partway through meal noticed nigiri more rice later part meal  maybe passive aggressive way fuller faster leave sooner just kidding! I full dessert often does happen!? but bf tempura green tea ice cream mango mochi both which he said really good  tempura green tea little more runny melted he would liked but still good   Kudos customer service both waiters very friendly  wasn't crowded which fine considering mid Wednesday afternoon  But soon meal both feeling all well very dehydrated we kept chugging water crazy sure if worth returning if post meal experience  <EOR> I LOVED Tomo during first visit way UNLV graduate school night class  ordered Volcano baked roll 911 hand roll which both very tasty   female server really amicable nice too! <EOR> Fresh fish cut well pleasant staff  am glad moved in!

When wanted pay soon ready no counter walk pay   FOOD 2 5  general consensus definitely better  Nothing stood mostly forgettable  place specializes rolls appetizers  better dynamites Goyemon but chicken beef skewers good along bulgogi side dish   pictures shown oysters large fresh  Unfortunately only 2 4 rolls ordered  Found Nemo 1 2 Tomo handrolls ordered  only thing stood Found Nemo Japanese mustard sauce since different  Tomo roll amazingly flavorless despite having flavorful ingredients The carpaccios ordered tasted plain sashimi chefs forgot peel off film lining super white making chewy unpleasant eat   Some nigiri awkward cuts seemed flopped onto rice didn't taste anything special  saving grace salmon skin handroll  Nicely fried salted crunchy skin little bits meat wrapped warm bundle rice sprouts   tl dr My friends experienced better  Comparing other nearby places Sakana I'd skip place would rather drive Sushi Koma  <EOR> This place awesome!
