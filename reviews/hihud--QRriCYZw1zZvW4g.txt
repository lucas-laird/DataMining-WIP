Gangnam dinner 4   Good meats tasty side dishes   Great lunch deals! ^^ <EOR> Coming LA where KBBQ everywhere amazing disappointment    My friends came late Friday night long drive Vegas  stoked find KBBQ close strip! around 11pm close around 1am  restaurant pretty empty  seated quickly told happy hour! Score! Here's ordered fried calamari 2 5 chicken karaage 4 5 beef toro 3 5 pork belly 3 5 beef bulgogi 3 5  Everything mediocre  Nothing ordinary pricey size portions  ended ordering 3 orders beef toro! really gave place low stars service  nice all but seriously nowhere found whenever needed anything  orders took forever come long drive just wanted eat! Also grill literally fire until someone casually came changed it  server also made weird awkward borderline inappropriate jokes just gave whole experience weird vibe    Don't think back  many other places hit  ten times better! <EOR> Efficient but friendly! only tasted great but great fun experience  Highly recommend if want something new! <EOR> Very good place  Nice service great tasty! Cheap price! good interior  foods very fresh! much ! <EOR> I came Friday night mom when town  didn't want eat buffet two days row decided check place out  off strip btw you'll need drive take taxi uber lyft  around 7 30pm put names down  waited roughly 45 minutes hour  didn't seem packed when but guess people put names came back walk around  getting super hungry smell food made even hungrier  seated back room some quiet which nice but thing kind sucked hard waiters attention since many come find someone  Anyways place AYCE but set menus pick ordered Gangam set  two people lot food almost AYCE me  tons meat kalbi bulgogi pork belly toro veggies   All meats very juicy marinated well don't really need use sauces provide  sauces all tasted bit salty don't recommend sauces honest  Other food amazing service wasn't bad pricing wasn't bad $60 two people   try some other menu next time town! <EOR> We chose Gangnam special two  WAY much two people! 6 kinds meat three side dishes 6 little sample sized bowls seasoned veggies  also came large salad  environment fun cook your food grill table  I'd say amount food two would better 4! Vegas but would definitely back again but if did would probably order off la carte menu pick meats really enjoyed filet seasoned flank steaks  <EOR> Great deal Happy Hour ! Discounted prices appetizers meats  Its $3 order pork belly beef toro brisket     Came dinner before event friend  She before way order before hit end Happy Hour time   She liked Pork Belly Pork Toro    Service young korean waitress superb  Very friendly funny    We ordered 3 pork belly 1 pork toro 2 toro beef 1 prime kalbi    The pork toro pork cheek isn't discounted  $5 95 toro name suggests highly marbleized some thick areas fat edges  isn't first time pork cheek similar pork neck meat well   When cooked properly good quality meat should super tender texture crispy   hard crispy but crisp bite through  cooked way where seared fat giving nice crisp fat  pork toro marinated seasoned any way  Quality seems imagined  Overall still bad but could better  But pork cheek neck meat quite expensive  somewhere along $10 15 lb wholesale  X_x   Prime kalbi $8 45 quality wise wasnt good either  them put prime name id expect high quality cut meat flavorful tender  point aged meats but know mean  prime kalbi seasoned some slight marinade topped some finely minced garlic? Pieces fair thickness  Cooks nicely  tender hoped nor marbleized cut other places    Toro Beef $3 45 otherwise quoted Beef Brisket   no means Toro thinking of  straight brisket similar any where else  Misleading name but guess fault believing may more towards Toro name vs quoted brisket name  Thin slices meat  Cooks fast  Simple that    Pork belly $2 95 surprisingly probably best 4 items ordered  Even compared pork toro prime kalbi  sad but surprising  Lol  Simple pork belly cuts    Overall bad experience  Priced fair during happy hour  Pretty sure wouldn't ordering meats during happy hour though  Nice place try if area    They lot appetizers discounted during Happy Hour well  Didn't try any though  <EOR> Food good service great!

He said yes   then told food cold he gave very slow drawn refund entire amount   Plus then he took plate food which already handled put neatly back kitchen where assuming he planned re selling   health code violation   So difference $2 dollars 12 minutes time     He would rather refund Entire price meal also lose customer forever ?

Nothing dish anything would find Sukiyaki  Sukiyaki beef thinly sliced rib eye no red bell peppers but rather spinach shiitake mushrooms onions green onions tofu bamboo yam noodles  More appropriately should called Yaki Noodle Beef which simply stir fried noodles  looked nothing photo menu portion very small  mom bean paste soup nothing special  pickles bland lacking any flavor  ate lunch but knew would come back again  service? tea cup sat empty without any question if would more hot water   finally asked more hot water since never offered it  $2 50 each hot tea? other Korean restaurants town hot tea complimentary  <EOR> love food amazing    my husband big fan Korean BBQ he brought try first time   i say back more!! <EOR> good food  good service but some items salty  i probably wont come back again  <EOR> Nice decor   loved grills  not smokey normal korean bbq places  meats good quality  Nice change pace compared all korean bbq places  waiters very helpful attentive  when lived OC  would korean bbq once week Korea town  Gangnam reminds good old days  bulgogi tasty  fried calamari perfect  Kolbi superb but filet mignon orgasmic  <EOR> When Vegas don't typically leave strip but did last time  came mid afternoon no wait  I'd say lives hype!

Definitely place eat while Vegas <EOR> I craving some good Korean food while Vegas   Thankfully through Yelp able find Gangnam Asian BBQ which wasn't far hotel cab ride   place located mall looking area next 24 hr nail salon   remember because amazed such thing 24 hr nail salon   We came around 11 night pretty late dinner us   But we're Vegas thankfully lots late night places eat   good thing arriving late made late night happy hour   definitely recommend ordering happy hour menu!  literally almost ordered everything plus tofu soup wasn't happy hour menu   thought wasn't going enough food but boy wrong   much food! Although bf eat lot still leftovers   All meats good!  Also recommend cheese wontons  2 orders those cause bf liked much   tofu soup big chunks tofu sticking soup filled lots kimchee meat inside   also give variety ban chan   All yummy!  pleasantly surprised place even happier price   would compare place being Gyu kaku but better!  Service good fast food great   No complaints here! <EOR> Solid food free dessert  really beef noodles   They great atmosphere nice food  Service fast  Great selection k pop  <EOR> What wonderful experience! Came little early lunch hour avoid crowd Thanksgiving day   For BBQ harumi miso prime korean kalbi beef tongue pork belly  BBQ great  Kalbi miso beef all juicy  Beef tongue little tougher side but sure whether them overcooked p   We also steamed egg spicy tuna kimbap  Everything amazing! kimbap really unique your ordinary kimbap enjoyed MUCH!  Overall highly recommend place if happen around area! <EOR> Great food but way much food two would easily feed three would recommend if willing try different things <EOR> So giving place solid 4 5  point off because service little spotty near end  feeling all waiters simply very fast paced if thought didn't need them simply scurried business    We Happy Hour right when started 3p Sunday  menu overly large exciting which made very indecisive  started off ordering only few things plan order more there  Here's all ordered thought    Bacon Wrapped Asparagus pretty simple hard mess up  But all other exciting options I'd pass next time    Sweet Cheese Corn favorites! sweet but sweet  adding cheese never hurts  would definitely order again!  Fried Wontons obviously staple just every Asian menu  yummy always but noticeably different any other place    Filet Mignon Again very simple  But enjoyable  responsible don't over cook it! meat quality great very tender delicious when keep medium rare  would order again    Bulgogi Very easy over cook due thin slices  But if watch comes very tender marinade everything wanted! would definitely order again!  Cream Cheese Wontons wonton wrapper super thin delicate  perfect light Crunch before breaking through cream Cheese  sweet sauce came great! would order again!  Chicken Karrage never anywhere  surprised see pieces fried chicken cut all different shapes sizes  fact first thought waiter brought wrong thing  thought fried calamari! chicken itself didn't much flavor  But spicy dipping sauce came great! sure I'd bother ordering again though      Korean Chicken Cheese Fondue enjoyed chicken even more expected! loved Crunch developed grilling! While insides remained tender  cheese came little foil bowl  shredded cold immediately put grill  tasted American cheese  would chicken again    Vanilla Ice Cream Macaron Sandwich Macaron purple sure flavor meant simply tasted sweet me  Even being frozen still perfect Macaron chew  vanilla ice cream creamy smooth!
