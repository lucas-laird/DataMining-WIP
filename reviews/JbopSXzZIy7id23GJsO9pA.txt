Well reasons tell you  grew Philippines lived 14 years when did never really thought much Jollibee  When moved school when began really miss unique menu mascot Filipino fast food  If lived states just tried Jollibee understand 2 3 star rating  But rated higher because them bringing America  let's feel home even 5 10 minutes  atmosphere service customers remind islands miss much   That's why rated 5 stars many places offer garlic rice longanisa? Spam? Corned beef?! Pan de sal? All go? Spaghetti! many   When Jollibee always yum cheese spaghetti  Only Philippines where offer rice spaghetti same place  Now many non filipino's may find wrong weird   But its awesome   Heck even McDonalds KFC Philippines offer spaghetti  your regular Italian style put sugar hot dogs ours  Which think better   I think may acquired taste when younger never really liked special sauce have   But now its reason there  yet try everything usually same thing but  because much  Anyways if you're area want try something new    fast  it  Also good thing Jollibee shares Red Ribbon  If meal Jollibee dessert red ribbon   2 cents   Centavos  <EOR> The location great those live west side near movie theater also  Yumburger soggy  Palabok Spaghetti Chicken Joy acceptable  restaurant overall clean fact right next Red Ribbon    I thought Chicken Burgers sign under Jollibee sign brilliant attract audience familiar brand   Near restroom area saw party section if decide kid's party  tucked back store  <EOR> I spaghetti couple friendly associates   length time food long told order before coming in   tried calling gave spaghetti away wait second one   Jollibee Maryland better but far  <EOR> I worst experience here! customer service horrible  ordered tuna sandwich when received only mayo NO tuna! showed cashier all she said Oh well  come she didn't even offer apology replace sandwich  basically paid bread mayo! wished took picture but just threw away because just mad experience   never eat again recommend place  <EOR> I Try big yum Burger very bad flavor meat worse ones other fast food chains The bread very fluffy mediocre They put much mayo ketchup  Fries where ok  I havent try fried chicken hopefully better burgers    Honestly didnt enjoy should gone Wendys least   The only good thing pineapple drink  <EOR> Checked see time closed Friday night  Says 11 00pm  little 10  Place closed cleaning  WT? <EOR> Bad customer service! lady name Amber worked @ Village Square branch needed retrained  Perhaps she should quit because obviously she happy there  No smile face she looked grouchy!

Jollibee course Filipino equivalent your American McDonald's Burger King   created when settlers lost tribes Philippine forests ventured soil modern society proclaimed world oyster   errr   balot   Okay fine fine   Jollibee its start Daly City CA trying give Filipino American families taste home long forgotten   Apparently Nanay Tatay both missed taste PI burgers chicken sweet spaghetti!  joy strange red white bee buzzing around   Honestly Jollibee Filipino am looking Asian Brad Pitt though most days closer Jo Koy    Close   but no cigar   Filipino trying attract caucasians finest   No offense caucasians especially Most Desirable Woman 2012 Jennifer Lawrence but much Filipino influence here   all intentional purposes dumbed down American audiences   Which bit disappointment because real Filipino food bursting real flavor!  Patis bagoong jufran 'all purpose' sauce there   pork EVERYWHERE   that real Filipino food   Jollibee ai sos don't know tell you   Of course eat Jollibee occasionally because kids somehow here   little eat Philippines?  Yummy! Now never back homeland but 110% sure isn't most folks eat there   seen PI episodes both No Reservations Bizarre Foods know!  Tony Bourdain Andrew Zimmern cannot deceived!      Going food   fast foods standards OK   Nothing special most part but somehow comforting same time   nice see Filipinos congregating same place considering melting pot Las Vegas is   kinda eating communal table   Except all partaking lot sodium artificial flavoring   But said MSG bad eh?  Jollibee's menu all over place!  burgers fried chicken fried fish Italian spaghetti palabok hot dogs   it's nuts!  Then course sides waffle fries mashed potatoes gravy white rice   Filipino right?  forget creative names some food?  Fried chicken called 'Chickenjoy' there's burgers called 'Amazing Aloha' it pineapple it 'Big Yum!' I never but am assuming BIG YUMMY    Gotta love marketing   If you've fast food before know expect Jollibee   all tastes strangely same   give them credit Chickenjoy though pretty darn good!  Especially when fresh fryer   Something getting side gravy dip your fried chicken very appealing me   Add side mashed potatoes corn in   Jollibee Chickenjoy rivals your big chain fried chicken joints   Masarap!  Jollibee does breakfast well think actually better lunch dinner menu   Filipino doesn't garlic fried rice sunny side fried egg your choice meat?  Especially when your choice meat includes pork tocino fried milkfish belly corned beef SPAM?  Lovely!  Bring some shoyu Filipino ketchup Lipitor lots water all set!  Thanks memories   Sure beats friggin' Egg McMuffin!  Jollibee does dessert well boba drinks call 'Pearl Coolers' UBE=YUM peach mango banana pies that look just ones McDonald's ubiquitous Halo Halo   International dessert Philippines!  kinda fruit cocktail mixed coconut shavings condensed milk shaved ice topped dollop ube vanilla ice cream   bit sweet liking though wish more fruit less milk   kinda pricey though around $5 large   But unfortunately large only feeds piggy ol' me     Overall OK experience   yes cashiers Jollibee speak English well Ilocano Tagalog very friendly   If think all Filipino people eat then friend no clue!  Ok well maybe some eat that   Most rather home pot chicken adobo fish head sinigang kalding goat calderetta simmering stove   Just saying   Now  MASARAP! <EOR> I've Jollibee many times Cali Philippines here  all just Jollibee me  If you're unfamiliar food you'll probably enjoy experience since very different other fast food places  don't really burgers always Chicken Joy rice spaghetti  really Filipino spaghetti enjoy this  palabok alright too  fast food can't expect much  If want something little better order arroz caldo palabok Red Ribbon counter right next Jollibee   I always order halo halo Jollibee  just last night  other Filipino restaurants when crave halo halo but always because know expect always consistent   With said customer service worst  always forget stuff orders just generally lack friendliness  girl Yelp mentioned rude she thought because she ordered English  First all shouldn't matter  But confirm rude all people  doesn't matter if speaking English Tagalog act can't hear you  <EOR> 2013 HALO HALO CHALLENGE Contender #2  Jollibee honors next Halo Halo Challenge   say pictures worth 1000 words  Well when walked into Jollibee Bam! face beautiful sight   a poster perfectly made cup Halo Halo  $5 hoping exactly picture demonstrated   ube ice cream flan sweetened condensed milk red beans green jelly coconut packed shave ice   think little ube syrup even added just show see pictures    Halo Halo tasted good expected  Vegas heat evening dessert only tasted much better  Halo Halo sweet cool enough minimum ingredients keep satisfied until next challenge   far fan Jollibee's Halo Squared   only issue   I wish more flan some legit ube not ice cream    PS appetizer before Halo Halo Challenge tried Beef Tenders Tapa    basically seasoned caramelized beef steak eggs rice   good perfect quick meal before any Halo Halo Challenge    Halo Halo http www yelp com biz_photos jollibee las vegas 2?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#Cot3wGtkvTNtq_OTutVyzA  2013 HALO HALO CHALLENGE Contender #1 Elena's http www yelp com biz elenas restaurant las vegas 2#hrid 66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74Qw Contender #2 Jollibee http www yelp com biz jollibee las vegas 2#hrid ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA src self Contender #3 Cafe Cebu http www yelp com biz caf%C3%A9 de cebu las vegas#hrid 5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQ Contender #4 Salo Salo http www yelp com biz salo salo grill las vegas#hrid Wgtkj97v8 l9MnNuyj QxQ src self Contender #5 Thelma's http www yelp com biz thelmas filipino restaurant henderson#hrid wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXw Contender #6 Andrea's http www yelp com biz andreas las vegas#hrid idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDg Contender #7 Chow King http www yelp com biz chow king las vegas 2#hrid 3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WA Contender #8 Fiesta Filipina http www yelp com biz fiesta filipina cuisine henderson#hrid VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHw <EOR> This review just halo halo!

Perfect hot weather! <EOR> I heard Jollibee quite some time finally chance try today   friend told Filipino version McDs KFC combined some traditional Filipino staples thrown mix   yep thought when saw menu   We fried chicken spaghetti today   fried chicken tasty really liked gravy dip in   Yum   spaghetti really different since cheese top sweet tomato sauce some hot dog pieces all mixed together   know sounds super weird but actually good strange way     It cheap meal too  2 adult meals kid's meal total only $16   shabby lunch   wish more hungry because lot fun looking desserts try   Maybe next time   And next time! <EOR> Jollibees leaves bit perplexed   came looking unique ethnic dining experience   left root beer piece fried chicken sweet spaghetti hot dogs ham sauce   saying bad   Just expected   Sure could ordered something more expecting   Something more Asian Island influence   But honeslty did know any was   should let scare usually don't   enjoy trying new things   But some previously obtained knowledge   know very little Philipino food culture   familiar me   Fried chicken spaghetti   chicken best had   terribly crispy   spaghetti something would expect child eat   Sweet full hot dogs   being said actually really did enjoy spaghetti was   pay around $6 $7 drink pice chicken scoop spaghetti seemed much   restaurant terribly hot   air unit must gone out   tables warm touch noisy fans all over place   don't place any blame owners management this   just warn everybody Yelplandia may uncomfortably hot Jollibees West Sahara if during summer  <EOR> Yes!  McDonalds Philippines food people   etc !  LOL all fellow Pinoy's know talking about   Anyways although food place let recommend Boba Tea!  delicious!  Probably best tasted LONG time! <EOR> Finally Jollibee closer where at! Faves include spaghetti crispy chickenjoy  palabok used really good now seems suffering cost cutting measures measley toppings dilluted sauce  Why mess good thing? burgers okay but nothing compared real deal tasted Manila price leaves wanting more substance quality  Overall good and clean place when craving Filipino type fast food  <EOR> This rating 3 5 stars  only Halo Halo here Red Ribbon bakery inside along few tables chairs small space though clean  But liked it wasn't big Chow King's inside Seafood City which BEST way but did enjoy having since aren't many Filipino restaurant options area west side  As said before am very picky Filipino food because often greasy don't orangey fatty liquid left your plate yuck gross  bench outside but cold winter time  drive thru window well  <EOR> I never jollibee reasons which explain below  halo halo craving closest place time it  Man totally disappointed! should just spent $5 tub ice cream    Upon walking holy jeez hot!! ac on  All multiple large fans circulating hot air! walking into giant oven    Next halo halo pretty much just ice  topped ube mango ice cream flan  mixed rest still bland  halo halo supposed chunky whole bunch ingredients  But did that?! Nope!!! Just little bit red bean 2 3 jelly things  rest all ice  Complete fail halo halo    As food don't eat it  Spaghetti uber greasy  If want Filipino spaghetti just seafood city buy ingredients yourself  Hell born raised California Filipino spaghetti better  Plus supposed hot dog pieces sauce  There's 5  Another fail  fried chicken don't know but always weird taste  fried old oil something  rich taste but good  chicken served side gravy  gravy doesnt really well spaghetti  However must say peach mango pies delish  crust crisp light while filling sweet  once bought 6 them could eat them later on    Only reason gave them 2 stars staff  always nice quick orders  <EOR> Unfortunately another establishment dropping off list go to lunch places   Behind building there's sign says Jollibee Parking parking spaces lined out   getting blocked delivery truck patiently waited until Jollibee worker fired off saying wasn't supposed park there   noticed she pleasant older white woman blocked Jollibee employee probably thought another lowly Filipino herself she could talk down to    fired off just patronized restaurant she property management should consider changing sign misleading   parking lines further misleading   establishment personnel burn  <EOR> Love Spaghetti  very tasty   Great service   Good customer service prompt service <EOR> Clean dining area walk in   Great greeting smile   Ordered two meals dine in   Plus halo halo go   held till finish meal asked if am ready halo halo   Again courteous another worker   Back meals   dads first time Jollibee   He impressed chicken cook bone   No red   White meat   crispy   He loved sweet corn mash potatoes gravy   Delicious   My meal also spot hence reason took dad craving fried chicken   live 30 minutes away   Worth drive all time   Hope putting Jollibee new centennial seafood market!  Haven't seen any advertising   need one!  Next time spaghetti  <EOR> Good chicken ability your meal healthier corn rice side dishes  All $7 including drink fast food bad  Much better KFC easier menu order from  also bake shop attached location  <EOR> There Kentucky Fried Chicken same vicinity but choose Jollibee almost every time  because chicken but because offer white rice side dish  Jollibee's chicken isn't crunchy KFC's but prefer white rice meal  Jollibee's chicken comes side brown dipping sauce  usually pass because prefer making own sauce rice vinegar 3 cloves crushed garlic crushed red pepper if salty little bit patis   also fact Mountain Dew meal because most fast food places don't offer it  lumpia egg rolls okay but prefer Jack Box's egg rolls because they're tastier  tried mini sandwiches corned beef spam them but while nauseous because much mayo them  When ordering through drive thru inside look pastries breads because Red Ribbon Bakery there I fact don't all way Seafood City Pandesal rolls   <EOR> Stopped lunch without checking reviews yelp      Big Mistake     Big       Huge! Definitely listen reviews  people know Jollibee    grew eating another country looking rekindle memory     Otherwise STEER CLEAR place!!! My husband ordered 3 pieces fried chicken side mashed potatoes gravy  ordered fried chicken sandwich  told would 6 minutes sandwich    said fine fresh     problem all  They brought husbands food right away he said chicken okay    mashed potatoes bad! Instant potatoes    ugh They said sandwich would right out       15 minutes later       no sandwich    counter said right waited 5 more minutes left     won't wait another minute food know isn't good don't want any kind replacement       won't back   DO RESTROOM!!!! NASTY!!! <EOR> I've never claimed very Pinoy  haven't Philippines since 8 years old until couple weeks ago San Francisco never Jollibee before  Well visit inspired finally check Vegas locations   My mentality approached drive thru window simple  might well order everything want try now  Just way don't come back  ended spending $14!  The verdict? fried chicken just so  side mashed potatoes tasted instant  side corn fared better but basically fried chicken combo bust   Fortunately Filipino style spaghetti rocked! Honestly used hate sweetness Filo spaghetti sauce  probably still partial good tart Italian Bolognese but totally down Filo spaghetti days something Jollibee does right   On dessert  two pies $3 opted both Mango Peach Banana Langka jackfruit   Mango Peach pretty good its own right but OMG! Banana Langka superstar  would totally come back just that  basically Turon  equals yumminess   Overall can't give Jollibee more two stars  just misses mark basic food flavor I'm referring fried chicken deal bite cousin's cheeseburger tried SF   Still totally worth visit just Banana Langka Pie! <EOR> Yelp 100 Challenge * 69 100  FYI Jollibee McDonald's Philippines notice flamboyant mascot pretty 'eh' menu its prolificness  both kiddie toys accommodate birthday parties teeny tots!   Tonight attend birthday event good friend's daughter just turned 2 years old  provided private room enough space guests roughly 30 open space kids play around dance  People given hour munch socialize which then followed hour long program consisted games kids and adults! finally dance number bumble bee mascot  He sure 'stung' Psy song boss! all fun could've sworn tonight's experience felt teleported back Philippines while  or maybe even Hong Kong Yes Jollibees too! cashier front even greeted Filipino honorific 'po' when ordered some food to go! Awesometastic    Nonetheless much loved company tonight's crowd Jollibee won't top 10 or even 20 fast food joints any time soon  chicken joy basically another word 'Popeye chicken' jollibee gravy added in  Oh much fat attached chicken's skin wouldn't surprised if confused its consistency jello  brighter note probably spaghetti best sweet red sauce hot dogs very Filipino lovveeee! Halo halo shaved ice beans fruits jelly ice cream etc  isn't bad either  Choose dessert peach mango pie  probably alternative apple pie Mickey D's all know! <EOR> Terrible customer service subpar food even beverage drinkable guess Filipino appreciate hometown join    <EOR> I rarely write review Yelp but compelled release frustration particular chain's drive thu service  Food good but oh gosh    Today record wait FYI there's always wait location ! 3 songs later finally 2 piece burger steak    No drink no side order  Here's issue another car front obviously gazillion food ordered but cashier could least requested family park car side if meant 12 minute wait next car which me!!! really wanted ditch order but badly craving some burger steak    Finally pulled up  told cashier record wait cashier no reaction    Fine waiting apology because would apologized if made someone wait long  cashier then handed order still nothing said sorry waited   She then gave confused look  Wow  Hey jollibee owner least jollibees' Philippines provide faster service compared here  <EOR> My family loves eat place once while  specially cakes  If want someone nice healthy B day cake buy  birthday cake Jollibee   <EOR> Not big fan Filipino spaghetti but love jollibee fried chicken    Yes little pricey but love side gravy dip your chicken in! mashed potatoes good corn good but best part mango peach pies fry fresh! worth 6 8 minute wait    Only real downfall no longer corned beef sliders Anyways yes little more expensive comparison Popeyes KFC Church's  buckets come 6 request dark meat only so much better but no does any cheaper would any other fast food chicken joint    It's always busy when come people always nice your food quickly  yet bad experience keep coming back fried chicken <EOR> Only place know where fried pies like old MCds apple pies    Idk why keep coming because prices ridiculously high compared other fast food places   wannabe KFC mixed PI food  <EOR> I'm confused  Nothing edible  Fries chewy starchy  fried chicken old smelly  called yummy burger most disgusting all don't even know kind meat didn't taste anything ever eaten  confused place business <EOR> This worst jolibee US  Customer service zero  don't care customer satisfaction  Even manager need class customer service  <EOR> It located nice location off south west corner shopping plaza  Plenty seating available friends family    Menu television pretty cool  even showed few pictures food looked pricing  quite bit items screen changes every few seconds   I only came dessert ordered halo halo which popular Filipino dessert mixtures shaved ice evaporated milk which added various ingredients including boiled sweet beans coconut sago gulaman agar jelly tubers fruits    I also ordered ube pearl coolers peach mango pie   I enjoyed all desserts all hit spot  Customer service satisfying tables clean  <EOR> This Jollibee location cleanest to  walked into some locations floors sticky tables wiped down  staff friendlier too    This fast food place specializes Filipino food very limited selection  popular fried chicken  Food pretty much consistent small portions  But enough meal person  Don't forget halo halo mixed fruit shaved ice dessert which popular Philippines specially summer time cool down  <EOR> Something different try fried chicken quite good crispy juicy  Spaghetti overly sweet but some people might it    Here main problem place drive through sweet pork?

Lumpia delicious crispy   wish Jollibee closer Henderson not Maryland location   I mean HENDERSON  because they'd business no other  <EOR> I am rating location star because consistently having multiple menu items   A major chain restaurant should always menu items stock  Over last several years sandwhiches 80% time   When order chicken sometimes spicy  spicy confused   I am very picky but least menu items most time   The service ok   The Jollibee Cebu much better location  <EOR> ***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 33 100***  Personally always McDonald's kind girl growing Philippines unfortunately McDonald's doesn't serve fried chicken rice lol  Jollibee rarity because first all wait time your food always ridiculous dine take regardless amount you're ordering seems second because food beyond mediocre laughable  chicken joy which supposedly money maker star pretty bad most times wonder if actually even chicken comparable Popeye's chicken but Jollibee's grease trap all appetizing although admit love crispy skin     The spaghetti ok fast food quality guess palabok much  Husband son likes Yumburger cheese mostly sauce but God knows made lol  halo halo never consistent ordered 2 decent just right amount ice sweetness other total fail  peach mango pies only saving grace opinion     The lack quality aside though Jollibee always thrive because tons Filipinos flock locations nostalgic reasons  brand represents core values Fiipinos importance family togetherness sense belonging no matter where end world you'll always little piece home when eat there  being said sure still find myself coming back point  <EOR> Not really great Filipino restaurant but hey can't expect much any fast food joint anyway  When craving Filipino food but rush place go  greatest menu  Honestly only palubok chicken combo  chicken taste great especially when dipped gravy sauce give along it   If you've never tried Filipino food suggest going authentic Filipino dine restaurant   don't want think Filipino food supposed taste like  3 stars! Can't really complain since fast food joint  McDonald's Filipino food  <EOR> I thought art horrible hospitality food industry form left perfection Philippines parts Thailand   didn't think dark cloud attention lacking lethargy would follow Filipino fast food chain straight across border into heart Las Vegas   Anyway twice when craved buko pandan shake only place snag til franchise own Zagu   Both times consisted customers waiting waiting food no placing order   which means adequate time catch if truly weeds which looks shouldn't been   Read Extremely slow help   took 10 minutes shake   The second time came last Tuesday when close buko pandan go   got shake realized huge baseball sized object cup   hey look iceberg   no really   a huge baseball sized brick ice  person oblivious poured into cup did think just some child wouldn't speak up?  I back following week showed manager pic phone explained happened   she immediately made another apologized  Star added quickly correcting last week's foul but think time buy own pandan syrup coconut milk create own   not returning third strike  <EOR> Can say bland? Ideally I'd give Jollibee 2 5 star rating mainly since wife seems it   food isn't bad   or good   it's   food  service OK    chicken apparently fried surface sun still waiting see if taste buds come back life sides forgettable  Reminds eating school lunchroom    <EOR> The fried chicken nothing special  entire experience would imagine would be going American Fast Food joint Philippines  Which kitsch cute but we're Philippines there's both better Filipino food American food readily available nearby  <EOR> What joke  Everytime come greeted hello just know chicken take 15 minutes 15 20 25 minutes later your food  thankful fact jollibee jn Vegas but come on!

Why that  <EOR> This favorite Filipino fastfood restaurant together red ribbon  Im always craving anything menu  Everytime come would order something different haven't tried yet just keeps going down list lol  Love it! <EOR> We tried Jollibee first time tonight  orders 2 3 piece combos fries mashed potatoes gravy  chicken crispy juicy  appreciate anywhere doesn't over cook ruin fried chicken   mashed potatoes cold  just came fridge cold  fries looked perfect but cold  disappointing because actually sign says something food being hot being cautionary  food not  Disappointing sure  <EOR> I first admit sweet sauce put spaghetti   said hoped other options would edible   wasn't   Chicken Joy many people rave practically flooded kitchen grease when bit into it   meat itself poor quality stringy   provided very small bit gravy chicken   gravy tasted made dirt    Hamburgers overcooked but other typical fast food burgers   The staff very rude location impatient if know your order when walk if ask any questions   The restaurant itself always seems dirty more once switch tables because some sort goo food leftovers them   I tried find some Joy ChickenJoy but alas second trip bad first  <EOR> I've always loved Jollibee but particular location rather slow  employees less enthusiastic McDonald's workers seems little quality control location   I bought uber slush yesterday outside cup smothered gravy  did employee manage gravy outside drink??? <EOR> I jollibee's really cheap eat spaghetti awesome!!  They always treat outcasts something but ignore continue eat here   burgers good but everything else yummy!  Asking refill isn't ever fun never give much ice feel annoying asking more Pepsi!!  The chairs scrape floor which drives nuts but maybe anyone else    The facility itself pretty clean bathrooms are Clean  Hand soap little high little ones though   I would give them 5 stars if friendlier us!! <EOR> Went best friend today on Saturday apparently don't close 11  close 10  Arrive order food 9  best friend just making conversation cashier  cashier says close 9 30   really need change time door social media    Customer service alright  way wasn't  expecting much reviews read    Any who    Wanted order Halo Halo but unfortunately weren't available because turned off machines  Which find kind bullshit  sure just lazy wanted leave early    At least food still good warm  Service needs little bit working  <EOR> Food wasn't quick but variety things offered besides typical french fries chicken burger  think depending adventurous definitely worth try  <EOR> I once did case study Jollibee branching outside Philippines SE Asia   Well lo behold Village Square!  sure must L A  somewhere but don't ever recall seeing one     Anyhow decided would hop over lunch just see would like   well it!  Granted only thing menu but certainly off good start   The place pretty big set typical fast food joint but more mickey mouse like set up   sure maybe big bee color plastic y seating?  Anyway thought quite interesting   probably 30 tables inside least third them occupied Filipinos belying poor rating Yelp   Traffic remained brisk during stay guessing okay   service pleasant although necessarily altogether sincere thought   But more expect teenage employees fast food restaurants?  They messed order bit ordered 3 piece chicken side fries but received rice   Okay chalk confusion between fries  rice which could sound similar   chicken properly crispy fresh quite good   departure other reviews read   am fan Popeye's because chicken come crispy don't KFC because theirs not   would say Jollibee's chicken crispier Popeye's although seasoning Popeye's better   basically wash between two which complement Jollibee's   rice fries    Okay rice typical rice   But gravy delish!  Surely must half msg but cares!  put gravy over rice pretty irresistible     So purely based chicken gravy giving 3 5 stars   Impressive fast food   eventually try some other stuff including Filipino dishes spaghetti   Debated if should give 4 stars work down 3 stars chance work up   Eh don't think they'll work give 4 now  <EOR> Love spaghetti All food good I Service Very good  Everybody very friendly  Bakery good  <EOR> The food gross also cashier rude didn't even give right amour cash  definitely don't recommend going here  food little suspicious wasn't 100% sure eating  <EOR> JOLLIBEE ALMOST KILLED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
