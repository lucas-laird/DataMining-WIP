Service friendly least! Also lookout 15% off your whole bill when check in through Yelp! <EOR> This place actually better expected reading Yelp reviews   first customers January 1 when opened 11 00   It little confusing because don't appear table service however if sit sushi bar sushi chef take your order act your waiter   If sushi bar register order   take place looks sit down restaurant   Don't let deter though food great   My wife mochiko chicken salmon rolls Mackaral rolls good  <EOR> We used love place but inexplicably eliminated waiters turned into take spot  Most bizarre setups ever experienced  People walking all over place can't really relax no bartender anymore extremely understaffed  most likely never return   I saw Slots turned off  maybe lost gaming license? <EOR> This place awful   Service mediocre sushi fresh   served room temperature looked old discolored   Definitely fresh   inedible   When commented fish fresh apologized gave some hawaiian donuts free   still paid full price food didn't eat   Definitely going back    don't want risk getting sick eating old fish  <EOR> The newest edition 2nd location located Plaza hotel downtown  Awesome set bar live music great food decent price  local hawaiian communtiy happy also hawaii vacationers feel home!

First off set threw off  walk head towards back place order which weird waiters   I decided garlic chicken bento box  filling alone but then again eat more man  rice served cold very mushy whole meal itself barely warm noodles mighty tasty chicken itself good flavor but bit hard if over cooked   On sushi rolls  decided fried California roll shrimp tempura  bad but great either  over drizzled sauce   Lastly desert no could ever screw desert right? Wrong  decided strawberry mochi play safe since first time coming regret it  could anyone screw mochi? tasted old  texture pretty hard describe but rice cake soft chewy  disappointed    Overall food didn't taste bad if area I'd probably give them another chance but wouldn't way eat here  plus offer 50% off sushi rolls if you're dining in  <EOR> My buddy Bobby knows all good Hawaiian eats Vegas  when planned trip reminded good times City mentioned pass Island Sushi some malasadas   Bobby dead time craving something sweet coming Aloha Specialties Cal  down towards end street Plaza Hotel  Yah same hotel shown Back Future II   Anyways restaurant near empty weekday afternoon but eager try malasadas  ordered vanilla custard haupia chocolate served warm  Malasada Portuguese donut covered sugar times served filling   I wish could take some home but would bit messy luggage  Loved chocolate best  could pass haupia since consistency wasn't creamy I'd like   The rest menu looked pretty good  need try garlic chicken next time around  Looking come back again soon next visit! <EOR> I've mixed feelings one  hand outstanding service Garrett   Some best service ever   other hand some rolls didn't taste very fresh   5 stars service 2 food  <EOR> Awesome experience!  coworker beyond pleased everything!

Pro tip If eat sushi bar order directly sushi chef  No counter order crud  <EOR> Had stay cation Plaza just see remodeled Plaza looked   also notice put sushi place called Island Sushi Hawaiian Grill   Which sushi Hawaiian food stop there   Located inside Plaza Hotel Casino made restaurant nicer looking   remember 4 years ago buffet restaurant   But making over adding new carpets new furniture lot new things   Having Island Sushi Hawaiian Grill Plaza place check out     Focusing restaurant itself   located nice area right front casino floor close check desk   place seems right size kind restaurant   also sushi bar bar slot games them   clean color scheme seem decent   staff seems very nice  Service other hand seems bit slow  could understand if busy but 4 other couples see no reason wait 5 minutes refill     I really hungry Teriyaki chicken plate 2 orders California Rolls   into details sushi taste compared others   just those people just eat sushi regardless   Sure enough did California rolls ate them all   teriyaki plate rice macaroni salad also decent    But honest expecting more teriyaki taste but didn't really taste much teriyaki   But cooked very well least     My recommendation if area decent place sushi   Teriyaki chicken cooked very well presentation good   Probably want request Teriyaki sauce side so  <EOR> I said would back back time bringing hubby along    Different items Chicken Katsu everyone party Chicken Salad had small stomach today Katsu perfectly crispy crunchy goodiness! Doesn't any better  Can't speak mac salad since didn't sample that  But am assured tasty per hubby   Chicken Salad sweet crispy morsels every bite  only wish dish would dice cilantro really throw there! couple sprigs delightful fresh taste mouth think would compliment chicken more more mixed in  But very tasty everything else!  And once again service awesome! same waiter Garrett   Pretty awesome and impressive he remembered us!
