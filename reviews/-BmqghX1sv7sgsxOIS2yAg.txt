Probably but still glad gave half assed attempt   Very apparently if you're Ethiopian some measure just might missing something   saw service leagues better if are   Also won't tone down whatever order guess   pleasant thing say but somehow empathize  <EOR> If you've never eaten Ethipian Eritrean establishment few things might want know  First food eaten your hands using delicious sourdough like mildly elastic njera bread pick up  Wait staff while usually nice attentive other restaurants general rule  prepared flag down your waitress if need something  Know almost always strong smell incense  If deal great meal Merkato   I ask cab drivers native America where country's best food served town  only does help pass time but almost invariably steer right direction pun intended   Almost all Ethiopian cabbies say Merkato best tell number cabs parked Merkato parking lot     I've Merkato three times now twice taking Ethiopian virgins to food other kind   corner struggling strip mall without much indication restaurant inside  Upon entering nice little retro bar small assortment liquor   rest place made dated peach pink ish Formica tables   On all three visits ordered doro wat which chicken leg boiled egg unexplainably delicious sauce vegetarian combo  unapologetic carnivore but could satisfied vegetarian if all could eat veg combo  things lentils fantastic  Doro wat ubiquitous Ethiopian dish done perfection here  two occasions ordered gored gored  Basically raw beef cubes spicy herbed marinade  If past raw part NO problem it then you're real treat  last visit ordered short ribs which ok but nothing special   Bring your appetite prepared leftovers  didn't think possible but doro wat even better next day  <EOR> Out town couple love Ethiopian food based recommendation Ethiopian cab driver    general rule thumb if cab drivers eat good   actually came twice during week long visit Las Vegas because enjoyed food much   Food fantastic inexpensive generous   veggie combo which usually order Ethiopian places something 9 items it!!!  service friendly accomodating if little uneven   Clearly family run restaurant probably caters mostly local community relaxed pace   The only reason didn't give 5 stars overall restaurant could cleaner  <EOR> I work near Merkato end going lunch least few times every month  place exactly expect want Ethiopian dining quiet delicious large portions cheap   wait staff always very friendly helpful accommodating food quality never disappointed      I've never any meat selections but variety vegetarian combination platter more enough two people always diverse!  addition some items vegetarian combination platter change around regular basis which more interesting if plan come back and if dining others fun conversations debates which items best    It however very slow paced but relaxing! atmosphere wouldn't recommend going Merkato if less hour available  <EOR> This review new restaurant 4970 Arville Street  tried vegetarian platter mixed meat platter well beef sambusa  Everything tasted great! good selection menu  honey wine homemade  service good  everyone seemed excited enjoying food  <EOR> I excited see many Ethiopian food options Vegas  don't Ethiopian restaurant home but Bay Area Austin unfortunately    So based Yelp reviews seemed great option  is  food AMAZING!  veggie dish Yedoro wot  recommend place food  isn't shiny new restaurant don't expect but tables dishes clean   The man prepared food took order friendly personable  However women waiting not  fact seemed inconvenienced us  ask order drinks  ask check 3 times  pretty bad service  <EOR> I took chance based reviews  Most them right target Food ordered sambusa excellent big enough share! veggie combo lamb all very tasty though lamb bit tough  others injera bread scratching head  did look made analogy crepe dosa fairly accurate  combination flavors terrific   Atmosphere seems nice family community restaurant   Drink diggin Ethiopian beer  Maybe lighter version Heineken?

Beyond bread which really can't fault them given didn't invent Merkato quite brilliant  some favorite artists last night  idea must commend them that  located semi abandoned strip mall also houses Bagelmania  When pulled knew good hands because lot filled cabs  Generally always follow cab cheap succulent meal    The interior fancy but welcoming  artists group really dug lighting behind bar  greeted promptly smile  Service little slow but did mind talking  actually appreciated casual kind service because no way felt if being rushed there  servers nice mom nice  No attitude all    We only ordered two dishes vegetarian sampler chicken entrée  expecting server push into third item but she simply smiled said Yes lot food  All dishes flavorful  especially liked cool lentil salad slaw dish beware spicy   happy bring refills the bread just two dishes all three enough  total $20 included beer!
