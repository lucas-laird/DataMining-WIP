While waiting very short time custom order offered samples cooked BBQ behind me  Burnt ends favorite world road kill cafe  note if near Holiday don't wait your meat few days early  very popular spot line run door through parking lot onto street! <EOR> I experienced bad service today  Came usual rib dinners but unfortunately ran out  No problem ended ordering 2 rib tip dinners brisket dinner    1  skinny black server wearing shorts hanging halfway down butt  very appetizing while dishing food    2  He took order slip helping 2 ladies front he then proceeded fill orders 2 ladies behind line    3  Then he nerve tell move because holding line    4  empty pans being changed dripping pan condensation water all over other food     The food still good but employees need monitored because attire service food handling need upgrading  <EOR> This establishment definitely become institution especially Guy Fieri's feature Diners Drive ins Dives everyone seems keep talking about!!  Location quite tricky being situated along narrow street between housing neighborhoods if you're going someone's backyard barbecue   Even person multiple times still gets lost trying find place   restaurant itself outdoors which huge downside blistering summer heat   They've actually added more seating initial visit there's plenty room everybody even fairly large group   I usually three meal combo which comes two sides   Rib tips brisket sausage drenched BBQ sauce way go!!  Meats usually tender perfectly seasoned   far sides mac cheese baked beans also quite tasty especially since appear homemade your store bought kind   Overall John Mull's Road Kill Grill serves best barbecues Las Vegas   bad live other side valley can't eat much I'd to  <EOR> The best BBQ Las Vegas!

Selfishness    Thanks Guy Fierri people come near far try best Vegas offer   This very simple joint  Outdoor dining only  brisket links pulled pork ribs tri tip only Tuesdays Thursdays insanely good  little digs mac n cheese  Green beans potato salad baked beans favorite sides peach cobbler very addictive   We lucky enough enjoy free beer Saturdays until scrapped long ago due complaint some bar nearby losing business boo!    Chuck owner very low key  You'll see grilling meat shop   Just tip   get before 1145am  line could very long  <EOR> Some decent 'Que side town!  I'll admit check place featured Diners Drive Ins Dives Food Network   But without tidbit might never knew place existed!  Funniest thing John Mull's basically located middle residential homes   Yes!  When GPS address might think you're being led wrong place   But keep truckin' because BBQ joint property looks ranch house   John Mull's eating area shares common space essentially butcher block   whole cow some eggs then meal BBQ afterwards?  don't see why not   While market around some time review basically over BBQ station   used just shack when first started lately hear small food truck type deal serve folks well   need help John Mull's busy lunch!  Typically take out but small seating area dozen bench tables so   If full eat your truck tailgate most folks do!  I am expert BBQ any means but good food do   Sure your naysayers BBQ sauce bottle I confirm think is but really don't care   meat itself artificially processed   Trimmed in house smoked in house!  Flavor BBQ necessary!  John Mull's some mighty decent 'Que   Easiest thing menu try if you're noob place just combo meal   2 Meat Combo run $14 3 Meat Combo run $16   When wifey usually opt 3 Meat Combo share   careful lot food!  3 Meat Combo easily feed third person     Combos come your choice meats sides   Meats include Hot Link Brisket Ribs Pulled Pork Pulled Chicken 1 4 Chicken  Their strength lies ribs brisket think   pulled pork but if having ribs which always do compliment brisket   ribs cooked just right requisite pink ring around outside meat pulls off bone but easily super moist tender finished grill slathering BBQ sauce right before serving   brisket flavorful just plain juicy thanks lovely fat cap surrounds each before smoking   OK if just say 'brisket' when order your meat most likely just lean end brisket   Which dry but near darn tasty fatty end   specific which part brisket want lean fat   usually ask 1 2 portion both     For sides Road Kill Grill some options Potato Macaroni Salad Coleslaw Baked Beans Mac Cheese Green Beans  Unfortunately no collard greens black eyed peas!  But can't everything   mention green beans just mainly reheated mainly skip that   baked beans very good mac cheese actually pretty stellar   also enjoy potato salad   Combos meals come slices white bread if request but don't forget ask!  won't always come included   Also some extra BBQ sauce!  know sauce may bottled but let simmer side most day flavor does concentrate nicely   hot BBQ sauce nice kick watch out   Kaboom!  overall great eats just don't forget extra napkins extra wet wipes!  messy   Which city people eat BBQ knife fork?   white bread for!  Another item usually order when eat Road Kill Grill sandwich   load suckers nicely nice portion meat sauce bread   Basically meal itself!  enjoy hot links sandwich particular   extra hot BBQ sauce top side coleslaw?  Classic     BBQ very picky topic see tons varying reviews John Mull's Meats Road Kill Grill   because depending side country different taste BBQ should be   Some tomato based some vinegar based some mustard based forth forth   Some folks more smoke some folks less smoke Hell some folks BBQ baked oven instead   But no matter all good food   think Road Kill Grill overall good food   Give them try yourself   might but then again might like   Many reviews place 3 4 star range tracked over 4 star area because here   place Las Vegas difficult find good 'Que  place Famous Dave's Memphis Championship BBQ   Nuff' said  <EOR> John Mull's Meats sure where start       places awesome some many ways  mean what's say place but great things  sure line before daily cooked bbq  Runs !! <EOR> Yum yum yum!!

Not mention staff amazing  Good vibe staff given sketchy look interior  food right people  all care about  place outside accompanied mister cooling line eat at  covered portion picnic tables nice area sun if late enough  <EOR> I lived Las Vegas almost 3 years since Day 1 told try Road Kill Grill BBQ  am disappointed myself taken long considering fact live less 3 miles should ashamed   From moment pull into parking lot smell various meats being smoked  Every good BBQ joint smell meet well before enter facility no different here  visit stopped later lunch mouths started watering immediately    They everything would expect many tough choices  Karen brisket dinner which came huge helping sliced brisket along two sides she picked Yams Mac Cheese   Karen enjoyed every aspect meal including house BBQ sauce which she said great flavor gentle kick   I never pass brisket but instead doubling entirely Karen's choices two meat combo  did choose brisket but also pulled pork  meal also came two sides potato salad green beans  loved pulled pork some best had  brisket good but wouldn't put great category  didn't quite taste smoke meat usually like  sides really good meal great portion wise  Unlike Karen spicy bbq sauce loved it  sauce very important super happy here  Both meals came piece cornbread   The service really helpful friendly  interior quite unique but small  prepared possible line depending when arrive but good job getting through  took food but plenty picnic table space outside   We definitely back again plenty food try  next time Northwest part Las Vegas should swing some solid bbq  <EOR> Always incredible service friendly staff here  Every time he first time all services provide outdoor cooking wknds  highly recommend place locals tourists! <EOR> I ate today first time   Great meal   tried ribs tips  which great brisket which very tender just wish bit more smokey taste pulled pork   pork good but would probably stick other two future cause even though pork good wasn't favorite   far sides tried macaroni salad which though no better then store bought   Mac cheese which good   However tried two other sides which thought stars sides   yams collar greens   must admit fantastic   corn bread desert very sweet   cook myself think would tune down sweetness bit put real corn into mix give more country flavor texture   would definitely back restaurant   only thing think complain would outside seating   Granted part its great atmosphere but flies attacking all sides misters high felt getting hosed down   Great food though must try <EOR> Great service amazing food super nice people  team working area stumbled upon place awesome find  <EOR> The hunt great BBQ Las Vegas brought some ways thrilled some ways disappointed   Went during lunch Thursday service seemed slow but because line deceptively short aka bunch people ordering 3 things   Probably 20 30 minutes when entered line when food  lots outdoor seating staying eating always option   The sides were 1  Cornbread definitely highlight really good right sweetness moisture  Left wanting more  2  Green Beans Average accidentally side because guy misread baked beans  Definitely good enough if green beans but nothing write home about   3  Baked Beans Very much point  Good mixture sweet savory right amount meat  Good enough eat bowl your own   4  Mac Cheese Really good especially most BBQ places  made theirs shells vs elbows which think great choice  incredibly cheesy unlike other places actually seasoned which really good    5  Cole Slaw very torn slaw probably little undersauced your traditional slaw  But result gives very refreshing light taste it  Steer clear if you're preference creamy but imagine refreshing treat during hot Vegas summers   And meat situation 1  Brisket pretty mediocre  meat sits juice liquid before serving which kept moist but ensured flavor pretty bland  Definitely preferable dry chewy brisket but prepare sauce if you're brisket fan  Bark almost none existent couldn't find smoke ring but BBQ fans know  everything 2  Ribs honest weren't great  Borderline eh   give good helping ribs which pretty good value price paid  prep ribs before service just reheating grill which why aren't great  Generally kind dry don't really fall off bone lack strong flavor  would pass unless you're just looking good value your money   3  Pulled Pork Definitely good pulled pork  Probably more sauce I'd but oversauced better undersauced pulled pork IMHO  Texture consistent good pulled pork little sweet side account sauce   4  Hot Links far winner meats got  really good balance heat flavor most hot links sacrifice other  preparation reheat grill then slice appearance left thinking almost yesterday's leftovers  being said tasted great right amount accompanying sauce  If hot links even remotely your thing won't disappointed   Sauces two sauces end X hot no X not  Both pretty good but something write home about  hot isn't really hot anyone likes spice but  probably ideal your casual spice person   Side Note tri tip Tuesday Thursday 12 30 Thursday out   Long story short hit miss meat sides very solid service you'd expect  <EOR> January 31 2015 Saturday 12 45 PM lunch 2 adults   Atmosphere 5 stars Food 5 stars Service 4 stars  Background Working hitting Diner Drive Ins Dives list   Atmosphere really thought phone app taking wrong place   drive deeper deeper into residential neighborhood   Yep very mixed residential business back behind home   neighbor across street three horses front yard   Gotta love Nevada!
