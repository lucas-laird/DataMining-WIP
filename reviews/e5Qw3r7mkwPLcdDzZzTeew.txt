The only time come when football season and am town   College football NFL  Why? 50% off ALL sushi rolls  Win!!   This place located pretty far off strip mostly place locals  But if you're visiting Vegas wanna venture off strip food recommend coming cheap booze sushi rolls  place relatively empty service pretty good  come around often since aren't many people    Hmm  else say place? some pretty creative rolls  can't think any top head but special ninja sauce if remember correctly drizzle over sushi  Pretty good    The reason why give place 3 stars instead 4 5 because rolls mediocre pricey when full price  12 16 dollars roll regular price  doesn't come many pieces  fish isn't fresh maybe bit picky because come sf but definitely better sushi rolls  But someone craving cheap sushi rolls while Vegas place isn't bad    I would avoid roll though  Spicy Lobster something  supposedly fried outside loaded lobster drenched sauce  just kind all mushed together mouth tasting nothing  end felt pretty sick    But all other times rolls wasn't bad  don't let experience prevent coming recommend trying place  <EOR> I recently some late night drinks sushi   late night happy hour 10 pm 1 pm pretty awesome   tried Spicy Salmon Roll Shrimp Tempura Roll $4 each off happy hour menu which pretty good   also ordered items off regular priced menu Lychee Martini Japanese Lasagna which also very good!
