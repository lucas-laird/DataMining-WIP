If thinking going did long drive over Flamingo Sandhill ready swallow some disappointment  According article online that found while scrolling Nosh Swig google search owners closed doors re open vs gone baby gone? simple note website or even sign door! may just courteous afterthought  <EOR> The reason give 4 star because love food  during happy hour Saturday   believe between 4 6pm   Chicharones which amazing! also burger bacon egg slider tiger cry korean bbq wings   Each dish really great!  Lastly tried Chinese churros   that three different dipping sauces condenced milk chocolate berry syrup   WORD YUM!!

Nothing Nosh Swig indicates reason mason jars  just being done because cool    The food okay but great  best thing day Cornflake breaded fried chicken waffles  chicken well fried waffles decent  only flaw came blueberry sauce which lot more watery I'd it just soaks into waffle soggy   other dishes all missed mark some form  pork bao tacos really needed something brighten taste bit  very flat muddled flavor  Same ceviche  ceviche soy sauce few other sauces made very salty dish yet desperate need some acid  monte cristo completely lacking any flavor way much bread little inside   poor quality small portion sizes Nosh Swig vastly overpriced   We skipped dessert because pretty disappointed meal  end paid just over $50 two people 2 drinks four dishes left trying think place dessert lift spirits  very annoyed whole concept place food did all  <EOR> This place worth drive where ever may driving from!

Once noticed Reel Big Fish playing   Cool haha don't hear every day   small snag when Shirley B  presented Groupon   groupon written check but reflected total   She sorted right away no hassle   read another review someone else small issue   Hmm     This place overall coming back because many small dishes yet try!
