Highly recommend place  16inch ham mushrooms onion  perfectly baked cheese delicious back again sure <EOR> I learned place because slipped take menu underneath door hotel staying at  Even though adore pizza feeling less enthusiastic ordering some random business didn't know thing but ordered large veggie salad anyways  Turns pizza actually quite good! crust amazing nice fluffy totally edible  Plus didn't skimp ingredients both pizza salad  really hate when restaurants cheap when comes giving your vegetables but Sarfino's did disappoint    Next time Vegas ordering pizza plus ton better value other overpriced food find strip! ! <EOR> Disgusting  Ordered 4 cheese pizza used something processed instead cheddar   Imagine layer Velveeta pizza  Then audacity say tasted processed because oil pepperoni sausage leaked it   It's 11pm high munchies waited hour pizza inedible  nasty does pizza hungry stoner can't eat it?  If you're smoker boycott buzzkill <EOR> Woke today 5 menus patio  front door but freaking patio  Whoever dropped off lazy obnoxious never eat here    especially terrible reviews  going call complain but sounds owner manager doesn't care he talks customers pass everything place <EOR> I lured street side billboard offering Large pepperoni pizza $5 00 and say pay for   It fast real nice prices everything menu real reasonable but     When first opened box thought given cheese pizza but quickly realized just put chesse TOP   I many pizza 1st   the pizza cheap nothing write home about  actually another 1st house  1st pizza finished   I wouldn't bother pizza again but I'd give other stuff try  <EOR> I'd leave pics actual pizza $5 95 large carry out special but never made home  good cheese crust sauce speed  first Santorino  last  <EOR> DISCLAIMER did eat here  thought problem only way knew pizza joint because pizza boxes wall  didn't even smell pizza  confusing  <EOR> Yes girl ordered mushroom cheeseburger pizza joint  fiancé wanted pizza craving juicy hamburger  Didn't high expectations because again knew  pizza place but wow! loved burger! juicy bun fluffy veggies super fresh  Yum!
