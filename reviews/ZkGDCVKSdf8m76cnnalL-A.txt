<EOR> I don't know happened place tonight   worst service ever   server Erika claims she new only couple months job  Boy does she still need lot training!  service bad enough when bus boy Federico came clear table while still eating flat rude   He even tried kick restaurant because according home   When asked why he telling leave when he wasn't saying anything people other tables around he just made nasty remark left called server   made sure name could report management    What sad favorite buffets Caesars Entertainment family hotel casinos Las Vegas  Being Total Rewards Diamond member wait long lines  always try least dinner whenever we're Vegas  variety foods offer especially crepes steamed crab legs   always great service before  why surprised such horrible experience tonight   wait staff always great very attentive  even anticipated needs lot times   why love coming back    I hope happened tonight fluke perpetrated two incompetent rude obnoxious employees deserve working service industry   hope those employees some kind disciplinary action  hope ongoing trend Caesars Entertainment properties  <EOR> Very disappointing dinner buffet  love Paris clean beautiful but buffet terrible  selection very limited bread far most tasty  Everything else very bland sad looking  crab legs scrawny already halved if think full crab leg limited meat imagine half offers   salmon duck over cooked very salty  pasta sitting tub butter  Even desserts just okay  Overall very disappointing especially $67 two people  Would discourage others wasting money establishment  Try Bellagio if want good buffet! <EOR> I just came back buffet terrible stomach ache something ate bad think crab legs  previous comments always considered restaurant best  started doubt quality when charged $24 99 dinner which thought cheap comments party hopefully quality remains same WRONG quality going downhill <EOR> My dining experience accentuated presence frenchman very rat like snout   reminded Ratatouille movie lended certain authenticity le village   food tasted more French could picture waitresses lopping off heads cobblestone   Lunch much better deal dinner   Don't leave without getting seafood mix bread bowl  <EOR> Food cold  lady seats rude when asked different table  She said your mind seriously says that  am diamond member worst customer service ever  Only person checking diamond entrance  Food very hot saw cock roach wall  Health dept  should inspect place <EOR> The crepes correct texture me   very large assortment food choose buffet   pastas white sauces excellent   waitress very attentive refill drink   crab shell indents easier crack open   dipping butter crab hint garlic   buffet wonderful always! <EOR> Food great! 5 star Huge variety different choices most top notch   Desserts highlight  Service poor   Since buffet only made hard drinks   waiter spent most time folding napkins  He only looked see if anyone leaving he could check table tips   When did attention he alternated between being friendly surly  a real Jeckyl Hyde type! <EOR> Limited selections much favors foods  Service slow friendly  <EOR> The quality definitely gone down  used favorite vegas buffet but anymore  came friends really no selection  Only few options  think sure worth paying extra 25$ eat cesears palace buffet  still lot food but food seems old! Just heads up! <EOR> I still remember buffet last time Vegas 5 years ago  visit made sure fully enjoy buffet  took tip fellow yelper  10am paying only low breakfast price stayed lunch which started 11am  excited when close 11am would happen? Would food magically breakfast lunch? ate lightly breakfast saving appetite hearty lunch  When 11am arrived many main entree trays started being switched out  Bread trays taken replaced sushi  Pancakes changed herb roasted chicken  Ham switched Prime Rib  OMG! dreaming? pinch myself   They ask your drink choice when pay in  Order coffee! coffee truly amazing! much character robust but dark  give whole carafe! Wish could've taken home me  corned beef hash during breakfast amazing! kept running this  herb roasted chicken mashed potatoes wide selection vegetables really hit spot  all buffets need some vegetables wash down gluttony  desserts incredible creme brulee of course flan fresh made dessert crepes chocolate croissants  Skip sushi  better sushi Safeway sushi doesn't belong French buffet   2 hours unlimited eating $13 95 person  worth it!  Check other reviews food blog http www yummysf com <EOR> I heard good things paris buffet   looking price $25 includes lamb sold!!!  Well whole another story   felt horrible wasting much food!  All duck lamb beed dry! only thing really enjoyed dessert smoked salmon!  hard even find anything good eat! extremely disappointed!   I continue believe buffets just aren't worth it! <EOR> I judge Las Vegas buffets thing serve prime rib shrimp crab?  If buffet higher echelon   And yes Paris buffet serves all more   lavish display   The service drinks napkins clearing away plates little slow   price little high side but well worth it  <EOR> I normally don't write bad reviews but buffet highly overrated   came dinner husband $67 two including tax   lines very long which don't mind but only if worth we waited 45 mins   decor highly outdated probably haven't renovated over 10+ years since dungeon feel   staff stretched thin see overworked   waitress didn't give drinks until flagged when ordered hot tea she gave very watered down milk which complete turnoff  missing spoons napkins such sure due waitress running around covering such huge section   variety food very very poor  can't even explain   vegetarian option horrible really isn't much choose from   would stay hell away dinner    decent breakfast while ago but dinner experience turned off forever   yourself favor Aria dinner buffet instead  <EOR> We 24 hr buffet pass loved buffet came dinner brunch next morning  Granted only visited other list Carnival World Buffet but enough notice if wanted food w good flavor Le Village Buffet where at   It smaller buffet's but offer lot dishes french cuisine can't find any other buffets  prime rib perfectly cooked juicy  LOVED mussels cooked wine reduction duck tender potato dishes delicious  loved some things simple little dishes but packed great flavor    They crepe station! them any fruits toppings hand they're all delicious  If come breakfast brunch omelette station offer unlimited small bottles Korbel champagne   The wait staff service slow  came Saturday night being seated took over 15 minutes drinks  wondering taking long noticed only guy taking drink orders serving them side buffet  extremely over worked   Their creme brulee best ending delicious meal  second creme brulee even better <EOR> This review breakfast buffet    You might wait little seated 20 30 minutes but well worth it!  When walk seated asked would drink   then given freedom peruse buffet   Doing bring many regions France   There many different stations catering particular region's specialty   can't wrong eggs benedict butter croissants   crepes okay little doughy   quiche Lorraine tarts delectable!    When come Vegas ALWAYS come breakfast least once   Although noise level high visual ambiance drowns other patrons escape France  <EOR> This review pertains Le Village breakfast buffet only  Meh   Mass production tastes it   horrible but nothing would order off menu  expensive breakfast given lack quality  eggs Benedict over poached point hard boil stage   corned beef hash missing corned beef thus lacked distinct flavor beyond potatoes     Not worth special trip   You're better off ordering something really made order decent breakfast place   Last point    maple syrup not   even maple flavored  <EOR> Not worth all!!!! $27 tax lunch only $10 value! Avoid! You've warned! <EOR> Had weekend brunch wide choice food unlimited champagne! choice desert awesome too! liked more Buffet Bellagio  $10 express pass great option skip line would highly recommend taking option waiting line hour <EOR> We waited 30 minutes annoying corral o' people but think food well worth it   Naturally first plate load all shrimp cocktail king crab legs   All good quality   However somehow missed crab cracker thingie wrestling crab legs bare hands! Other highlights included pesto pasta au gratin potatoes all desserts! If just hit buffet LV one! <EOR> Vegas buffets   Le Village buffet favorite Vegas!

He took plate away few minutes he came back big basket 2 plates The basket full freshly made hot succulent crabs  He made sure tea hot  end Donato presented black white chocolates form Eiffel tower ! Good job Donato! <EOR> A must have!!! food well cooked lots veggie healthy options  Ambience awesome evening feel it!! breakfast buffet there  queue long line 30mins before turn came but totally worth it!! Absolutely great value money!! <EOR> Solid selection   Best deal Buffet of Buffets without charge   ranked buffets tried because reviews deceiving    #1 Bacchanal Buffet Caesars   worth charge   must go  #2 Le Village Paris   does compare Bacchanal but best quality food without charge  #3 Carnival World Cafe Rio #4 Spice Market Planet Hollywood #5 Flavors Harrahs  The last three opinion very similar mediocre buffet style food   #1 #2 more gormet style food  <EOR> Great groups  Suggest making group reservation  pay gratuity upfront but bypass LONG line   Food bland  Nothing really stood out  Wait staff pleasant  little overpriced Vegas mid day buffet  <EOR> HAHAHA Le DAYUM indeed!!!

Be prepared stand line  Know Vegas people tend start days late  if don't want stand line   WAKE EARLY   But seriously place pretty awesome   P S TRI TIP!!!! <EOR> Hands down best buffet breakfast all Las Vegas!  If amazing crepes don't put into state nirvana don't know will   come every time town  <EOR> Disappointed!!!  I remember Paris buffet being much better visited few years ago but very disappointing time     Not enough variety enough decent items   Even desert selection weren't impressive   Liked made to order Crepe bar though but  it   I wouldn't recommend place back here  <EOR> This used favorite buffet Vegas   but recent experience unsatisfactory   Let's just say french would pretty disappointed ate buffet today    seriously remembered buffet lot better before    The snow crab legs puny dirty looking looked very unappetizing didn't even want touch it  The king crab legs soggy bland didn't taste very good either   Other everything else okay 3 star mediocre    hope seriously improve place actually very good concept buffet french inspired twist  <EOR> WHy people eat many other better buffets?  Wicked spoon Aria tons better   Crepes all rage but great   soggy greasy filled defrosted frozen berries   Whipped cream awesome though  Prime rib lamb overcooked   Desserts horrible!  French themed buffet!  Wicked SPoon dessert table light years ahead   Skip place  <EOR> Don't come here! angry within 10 minutes starting buffet wrote reviews even before left   Crab legs cold extremely salty  then won't eat much them  Even pickles would more tasty! Other meat seafood extremely salty some sands some very strong meat flavor if know saying  Desserts many choices nothing special sweet    The only thing felt okay smashed potato    Oh fake sky  made feel something heavy hanging over can't breathe smoothly  <EOR> I came 11 28 part Buffet Buffets special   favorite buffet   started breakfast ended coming back dinner couple really bad other buffet attempts lunch   food good amazing  happy it  <EOR> 2 times Vegas = 2 times visited Le Village Buffet dinner  Incredible range choices reasonable price food location ambiance overall just wonderful treat  other buffet tried Todai Planet Hollywood which also good place but Todai in house buffet while  Le Village unique atmosphere which resembles well cute little French village right inside Paris hotel  loved everything Le Village wide variety food almost impossible room desserts but simply to  Those pretty tasty dreamy desserts just good pass  Next time you're Vegas come Paris dine Le Village  Then if feel take tour 1 2 sized Eiffel Tower watch entire Vegas sparkling night  dinner tour definitely remind much actually love Vegas <EOR> Being buffet gotta compare other vegas buffets must say expecting better reading some reviews   First impression staff work seat none them looked wanted help smile thank nary pleasantry anyone   drink waiter did seem amiable very attentive clearing used plates checking drinks ordered   But being buffet away if food special must say only thing special crepes  Yes good if you've hankering then probably buffet you  But rest food best average worst cold bland   Soups way over salted admission made servers themselves! Salad selections sparse meats mediocre  Desserts tasty   Maybe off day buffet but all say overall definitely better buffets Vegas  <EOR> Le Village Buffet nice buffet w nice European French chateau style decor  Many good quality foods here  style isnt broken type foods but all together  lots european syle cuisine seem wine infused  crepe station serve escargot Duck pastas chicken fish different types sauces but definitely good quality   Oh yeah french pastries minimal choice desserts but good    <EOR> Wow  Talk disappointing!! tried once but line ridiculous tried different day hoping would mind blowing  not!  BAD EVERYTHING looked soaked oil  veggies butter baths  pastas pools oil seeping where ever scooped out  fish surprisingly oil hard fork couldn't even penetrate meat  buffet slammed packed saw them constantly bringing new food but just bad old stuff  lot looked made ealy morning then stored under heat lamp until dinner time   GOOD prime rib surprisingly good the horseradish much crepes really good    If dragged stick savory sweet crepes  rest disappointment  better yet WORLD CARNIVAL BUFFET Rio never disappoints   <EOR> God happened Paris buffet? used favorite 10 years ago Sunday food even recognizable any longer  breakfast deal bad $35 two people  food selection absolute crap  Don't even bother waste your time just cafeteria food  only reason crepes but even wasn't great  saw another review someone comparing Hometown Buffet  insult Hometown  Ha! Somebody else said Sysco food bingo  it  think whole Buffet Buffet thing ruined them  putting business acumen work would speculate all hotels involved B B together buy bulk food nice discount then just distribute amongst themselves   why doesn't stand  why quality eroded  toppings look old some reason no better way describe it  workers seem miserable don't know exactly why  If crepe seek across hallway crepe baker save your time waiting line place  Never again especially having Wynn  sad  <EOR> If non weekend day breakfast ends 11 am   Lunch starts 11 am   barely made breakfast but didn't much time try breakfast items since already starting change lunch items   Breakfast $15 99 Lunch $17 99 weekenday   Food ok your standard buffet food   Kinda mediocre   Best thing buffet made to order crepes!

I barely touched seafood section since seated near when saw them refill area made want since all boxes plastic bags   least better job presenting preparing P  Dessert selections could use little help but serve chocolate dipped ice cream cones soft serve machines   There's macaroons but filling just jam which little disappointing   The weekend brunch price around $30 Champagne brunch which great if bubbly but price horrible if want just want meal   Take advantage unlimited champagne!  The decor pretty unique buffet since try feel eating courtyard village   However dimly lit some areas feels little    old   Service    little inconsistent   first waitress slow looked she couldn't wait there   eventually flagged down another waitress she great helped throughout meal   All all Le Village isn't bad $30 unlimited champagne brunch fair price Vegas buffets   If paid little more attention detail then would much more enjoyable meal   Little things soup could've hotter ice cream rather soft serve even having staff actually cares cleanliness   Saw cook refilling soup water boiler overflowed pot dropped she didn't bother wiping station even if only water  <EOR> Was breakfast disappointed   wait bearable    but 45 minute wait Crepe line ridiculous!

Le Village Buffet brunch buffet decent enough  food good but nothing knock your socks off want come back    We arrived around 10am only few minute wait  time left considerable queue seated  didn't know time but apparently each station buffet represents different region France accordingly food various stations relates region's specialties allegedly   Regardless made tad bit convoluted gather food your plate first world problem now feel little ashamed complaining brunch much food chose   example fried hash brown wedges station hashbrowns across room another potato wedges another  should take stroll around entire buffet first see offering  crepe station most popular line entire time there    The person seated took drink orders coffee water etc  but couldn't take orders mimosas  Once waitress showed she took order mimosas  thought unlimited but she never returned table sure that  sure few more mimosas would remembered buffet more fondly  Summary Decent enough  large variety standard breakfast food chose from  <EOR> I've ate 3 times  Once 2011 twice March 2013  liked it    Food thought great delicious prime rib mashed potatoes! Mini square cheesecakes raspberry sauce  Mimosas!  Food thought just good last time tried omelet station good but great  Same potatoes biscuits gravy   Service 2 3 good waitresses just grouchy  But other two more made it   Value tad expensive but tried another buffet same price on strip Le Village definitely tastier better quality  <EOR> The food alright some things salty some sweet  waitresses very kind welcoming but man making crepes insanely rude  However entire area very unique pleasant look at  buildings surround lanterns street lights really give Parisian vibe  Vegas buffets would come just experience but probably wouldn't return myself  <EOR> Simply  yourself favor stay away Paris FAKE buffet not much choices also very low Quality food  BTW run food when asked reply RUN no more seriously funny   management very RUDE un professional   even 7y old kid noticed that   <EOR> My favorite Vegas buffet far   Succulent prime rib   Made to order fruit crepes   Don't forget Gnutella!  creme brulee nice touch     While Le Village Buffet doesn't offer large selection Rio food tastes looks better   Come if appreciate quality over quantity   Then again kinda defeats purpose buffet but $25 still awesome deal good eats  <EOR> The buffet lunch absolute dee lish! tons great seafood enjoy  didn't even bother getting cut meats just loaded mussels clams shrimp!  They also crepe station cooked order  bananas nutella  felt banana slices bit large would better if bit thinner   The dessert bar also looked amazing but definitely disappointed macaroons  many but didn't taste great  outer shell tasted fortune cookie  <EOR> I Vegas over 50 times across 20 year time frame worst buffet ever  am hard person please rarely leave negative reviews  Bad food bad service dirty dark  Save your time money energy  buffet comped am still upset wasted time  Only tried because St Louis cafe next door excellent  type Im 14 minutes into waiting coffee  Absolutely ridiculous when am capable getting myself  <EOR> The variety pretty small you'll your rounds less 5 minutes     Their grill steak chicken sausages roasted peppers  pretty much it   A lot sausages   Quiche Lorraine wasn't very good but crepes tasty!

Even bananas blueberries swimming some kind syrup   ended only eating three bites entire thing   waste time   Some other things ate Eggs Benedict only highlight entire breakfast   pretty good ate two  Prime Rib better  very bland lacking flavor  Roasted Beer thought tasted better prim rib   nicely seasoned  Spinach Cheese Quiche BLEGH! disgusting hard when should've nice flaky crust!  took bite force down throat    I wish better selection desserts sweet pastries considering Parisian breakfast   Maybe should've gone dinner could've tried amazing Creme Brulee everyone raves about   am huge sucker desserts major sweet tooth  LOVEEE Creme Brulee!

What separates Le Village other buffets crepes!  crepe station fruits nuts toppings whip cream   If only strawberry    <EOR> Overall Paris Buffet solid choice   fairly pleased     I say however 4 buffets visited Vegas last trip Wynn Bellagio Aria being other 3 4th line   just didn't stack last 2 times there   slipped bit honest   The food choices overall bit skimpy compared other lunch buffets Aria Mandalay etc    only buffet visited where pretty easy through all choices fill your plate twice or even once    choices just weren't appealing   The food also didn't appear fresh sorta warmed over looking    odd b c Monday fairly early 1130 more few dozen ppl even through it   food bit dry spots     The positives overall you'll leave full fairly satisfied meat other selections   wife really liked sole very much! Also decor if sit outside pretty cool although painted cloud ceilings overdone between Venetian Planet Hollywood Paris everyone does starting look 90's hokey dated    crepe station didn't take advantage just thing although if into did look pretty apealing   A solid B    Down A few years ago   Don't let slip any further Paris you'll equal run mill Treasure Island type buffet  <EOR> I think better buffet spots Las Vegas   There's some room improvement but couple things standouts cost little less Bellagio Wynn those love desserts place seems most variety all pretty damn good     <EOR> According some list read buffet regularly ranks top five Vegas  Unfortunately there's really big gap between #1 Bacchanal anywhere else  most buffets place some solid dishes lot fillers  gimmick being Paris casino having French dishes  Unfortunately buffet quality French simply isn't great   HITS chicken de Provence truffle veggie cavatappi pasta prime rib solid eggs cheesy hell if you're into sort thing crepe station Sunday brunch includes champagne surprisingly good despite low retail price limited dessert selection  place  hyping French affiliation   MISSES French onion soup super salty dregs pate charcuterie area good entire sushi selection consists literally single crab maki roll entirely many breakfast options still 2PM heated plates dessert station lead melted desserts    SERVICE They're busy that  Hostess inefficient three groups 6+ held line half hour until someone came figured pairs could seated immediately line started moving again  server far many tables short term memory loss served half drink order then forgot alcohol until reminded half hour later the next time saw her    Not best buffet but certainly worst  Pricing decent but only if filling grilled meats think selection  fancy breads French   <EOR> We brunch 10 45 Sunday  Surprisingly short maybe 15 min wait  food good hardly anyone getting crab legs fill  terrible experience two years ago where waited two hours brunch server refused replenish crab legs  The best part crepe station where very friendly cook delicious stuffed crepes order  YUM!

Hot cereals cold cereals pastries pancakes french toast coffee OJ  probably ton other things am forgetting mention   Better Denny's? Maybe worth extra money? selection    yeah probably  <EOR> I came during memorial day weekend more expensive normally is  think payed $42 lunch buffet  day before came tried Bacchanal buffet Caesars Palace obviously ended comparing two Bacchanal $75      Overall everything expect buffet  crepes station which really enjoyed seafood meat desserts etc  But comparison Bacchanal just sad  only did Bacchanal provide much more options but also much much better quality food  know huge  price difference took into consideration but even though did don't think food worth $42    The service ambiance honestly quite bad well  sat separate room some sort could just tell place run down  looked old wallpapers dirty dusty  just kind unattractive place eat  service also so so  No ever came clear plates refill drinks    While buffet cheaper kind lives pay   many great buffets Vegas  would definitely avoid maybe pay little extra $ if can  long way! <EOR> Wow place exactly best dinner   few years ago lunch pretty good   dinner just very good significantly deteriorated quality selection    The selection seafood meats dreadful say least   guess can't compare Bellagio buffet   should known when rang front $27   looked over friend said food can't really good if charge small amount   The desserts horrible would offer dry bread pudding ick   good note single serving soft serve cone stale  <EOR> Lunch time  Prime rib good dessert ok had creme brulee yum yum chocolate sugar free cake no good dry old    At $17 99 bad  <EOR> I guess huge fan buffets HOWEVER notably better most buffets Vegas here's why  The food selection quality par   Doesn't metallic plastic taste if came bottom freezer   pasta truffle sauce absolutely amazing   course drawback price but personally spending no more $20 amazing lunch meal   other drawback crepes   Now dessert ones great heard   meal crepes however use some improving   chef asked wait little longer cheese melt inside crepe which thought totally fine   However upon indulgence cheese warm fully melted either   Think putting sliced cheese microwave then having someone cut time short because everyone hurry   Yea kind cheese consistency  Overall bad but said buffet kind guy but did exceed expectations  <EOR> Lot selection decor really pretty atmosphere much different most places   staff very friendly especially gentleman doing carvery early morning super friendly black guy    He super nice deserved tip but he doesnt tipping bowl     The crepe omlette morning tipping bowls if don't tip most rudest mean service getting them ever   mean something omelette crepe where they're just doing job don't see why would tip   glad tip people provide service give smile regardless then back tip    but all buffets only place literally gigantic tip bowls expect tip not you've already paid buffet need tip server well    Shady also service if don't tip offensive!  Anyways food okay crepes okay well   <EOR> The crab great  carving station favourite too  Leave some room dessert don't forget try crepe  whole buffet over priced though  <EOR> I cannot say enough good buffet was   good both Saturday Sunday weren't even guests Paris hotel   Just great selections Crab Legs Shrimp Prime Rib Corn Beef Hash name few   FRESHLY made Crepes Creme Brulee made want somersaults all through restaurant   damn good!  big ice cream person Custard style Ice Cream hit spot even took Cone go!  highly suggest Le Village Buffet  <EOR> Came breakfast lunch part Buffet Buffets  Although line excruciatingly long food classic french egg omlettes mussels different meats large assortment different foods! favourite thing crepes   they made order absolutely delectable! tried apple brandy nutella banana mushroom truffle batter thin while filling plentiful! hot fresh made making absolutely disgusting rock hard macarons    Overall bad buffet! <EOR> Not friendly  Poor service  Bad food  Worse chefs  meat section chef directly back  He kept looking see if left not    Never saw before  If your food good this  However worse buffet town heard  funny  <EOR> This used favorite go to buffet   recent trip however variety hot foods disappointing   still tasted good but much spent didn't feel worth anymore   desserts though still thoroughly enjoyed well deserved 3 desserts alone   came two days before Thanksgiving maybe something it? <EOR> This pretty standard buffet couple added twists French flair   The good Crepe station  crepes fantastic yelled obscenities while eating them  back tip crepe makers  good  Carving station  Fresh good meat served smile  Truffle mac cheese  Eat it  Desserts  All them   The bad Crab legs  Cold tasteless pre split crab legs fit human consumption  Disgusting  Service  takes REALLY long time them even acknowledge your drink empty  also don't take plates very quickly but second your entire party stands food they're quick try turn your table around if you've left  Plates  impossible find them  don't seem put any dessert station all   In all decent place eat especially if casino comping it  don't think I'd pay buffet though  Being diamond member also helps because literally walk right past line  <EOR> In past Paris best buffets before Wynn opened  Then Paris decided join other resorts   This where everything fell apart    I would given them four stars when younger but once buffet buffets stringed along   they deserve two stars  quality food definitely dwindled down   First off service excellent always  Yes waitress might refill apple juices very quickly but can't blame all tables she deal with  reasonable person  =]  Second during breakfast   I only enjoyed eating build your own omelet crepe station they rush crepe bit soggy   not Bacchanal Buffet   patience   crab legs didn't taste good either   not fresh  carving station only prime rib ham sausage   however no slice meat   so everything became dry  dishes displayed didn't look very appetizing   so didn't even try it  Didn't want sick    Lastly am sad say wouldn't suggest coming breakfast  haven't came awhile dinner but if do   I'll update this   However may awhile   I'm addicted Bacchanal Buffet now =]  Note Unlimited beer mimosas wine $12 99 <EOR> I extremely disappointed breakfast spread had  only did very few selections but crepé station missing significant toppings most dishes! Why?! How?! Ugh!!!!! never returning again!!! <EOR> You can't leave Vegas without stopping least buffet! dinner buffet much better but champagne brunch wasn't bad  ordered mimosa happy thought only 18  P favorites desserts  crepes creme brulee awesome  waiter also gave chocolate covered strawberries  <EOR> On saturday mimosa brunch  food selection pretty diverse but need try lamb crepes  crepes across street $8 exactly same stuff  really liked nutella banana crepe  ambiance pretty nice some very interesting paintings hanging walls some rooms    <EOR> We champagne brunch Saturday  seated almost right away  food excellent drinks while didn't same selection some other buffets still tasty filling! waitress super attentive very polite  All all left satisfied very happy having spent money there! <EOR> The food great while decoration kind disappointment me  prefer buffet dining environment more light  doesn't nearly big food selection Bacchanal but allowed taste almost everything have  thing absolutely need try crepe  #6 crepe ham cheese super tasty! Other items really liked crab leg creme brûlée  <EOR> nice atmosphere! feels you're dining outdoors paris   the food okay  nothing special but its bad either  hit crab legs prime rib most bang your buck end meal fresh made dessert crepe  strawberry banana nutella cream exact  the line gets pretty lengthy around dinner time come pinch earlier 5 5 45pm you'll good during off season  <EOR> their desserts awesome but rest food just okay    very average  good ambience friendly service  though  line ridiculously long some reason like more hour <EOR> I'm really picky buffets  good QUALITY food over QUANTITY food  don't care places Rio where abundance food but quality SUCKS! Another important factor price  don't feel spending nearly $50 buffet  There's no way eat $50 worth food opinion   Which leads Paris buffet  came during lunch hour which weekend called brunch  Spent $27 which adequate price Vegas buffet  Although some places much more higher some even cheaper   The ambiance fantastic  almost feel your Europe sitting little cafe other tourist  feel your Vegas all  quite cute actually   The quality food fantastic!! cooked very well didn't eat anything didn't like  tried much could  very fond 2 different types chicken had  Baked roasted  both tender juicy  full flavor! pesto pasta quite awesome too  also decent tasty quiche!!  The best part buffet desserts though  such array desserts everything tasted delicious! cheesecake flan chocolate vanilla ice cream cookies baked goods fruit personal favorite CREME BRULEE!!  The creme brulee tasted awesome  boyfriend loved flan  actually quite impressed vanilla soft serve ice cream  very yummy french vanilla flavor it   Service great food great  should really check place out  Save few bucks come instead Wynn Bellagio  won't disappointed! <EOR> I thought expensive didn't sharp distinctions between regions   parents loved sliced fruit   Service okay   food generally bland but line long   Whenever kobe beef available would gone once heard it  <EOR> Best Prime Rib any Las Vegas buffets!  A++ We stumbled buffet while celebrating birthday last month   Vegas 20+ years but never Paris hotel   few things really stood out Nice atmosphere not your regular florescent buffet lighting   Every buffet prime rib BUT best Vegas  perfectly seasoned salt spices TENDER  Great selection food organized around french regions  Seafood bar large Rio but clams mussels superb  Even ice cream machine A+ Vanilla Custard not just plain vanilla soft serve   To surprise 4 5 star food served buffet   Woohoo  **note**  If Buffet Pass Paris A+ Rio B+ great selection whether regular seafood Cesar's closed remodeling Major bummer!!

At $30 dinner little pricey but buffet Vegas isn't anymore? Next time sure take advantage $45 all you can eat 24 hours deal which included six buffets Harrah's family casinos  <EOR> I remember experience being better when last 7 years ago    Overall food still solid  could better job keeping buffet stations clean food items properly labeled   also several stations blocked black drapes which bit trashy   little better management items could no doubt turned around quickly  <EOR> Well color disappointed   Did walk through buffet year ago when visiting mother looked promising   Really   only reason didn't friend didn't want spend $30 head eat dinner there   Fast forward trip made boyfriend insisted go   We stood line probably 20 minutes forked over cash taken seats   This true buffet just random foods really having nothing Paris   The salad bar looked pretty rough skipped it   Boo   I actually couldn't find anything really delicious   eating just fill opposed enjoying appreciating food flavors presentation   YES buffet but food tasted really boring   Heck Orleans buffet blows away   boasted giant crab legs when paying before eating but guy seafood hut told haven't them week   The drink lady took forever come around   finished first plate time she came over   I really wanted love place much willing pretty forgiving   But when all said done found myself apologizing boyfriend having subjected it   O O <EOR> This first experience restaurant buffet   divided into many different sections but lot standard things you'd expect buffet   food pretty good but best ever had   But quantity can't really wrong     The theme village really cool each area own little house   desert house right middle great selection including pretty fresh crem brule macaroons!    There wine section but exclusive just anyone  <EOR> We tried buffet Le Village Paris Paris friday night  smart Groupon came recently good deal  did see almost all people pay retail $$$  line crazy waited almost hour   Firstly couldn't understand all fuss about  ambience place nice but apart wasn't impressed  French ambience does experience little nicer buffet organized food different provinces France  only interesting part food service really average   Food wasn't impressed variety contained only French varieties no delicacies  Vegas does walk expecting some level opulence delicacies surprises especially if am paying $40pp which missing  course since only French menu few dishes well prepared  However vegetarian barely anything tasty eat  made order crepes saviors  Although very nice delicate well prepared better crêpes food trucks Austin  Apart all 4 different kinds potatoes eat! Really All hype French cooking expecting some nicely prepared vegetarian options  Even bread collection mundane find those your local cafeteria   The macaroons highlight dessert section but again if they're flour less delicate? cookie still just cookie bake nice cake! No cheesecakes no tortes no ice cream  The seafood collection seemed ton nice people enjoying crab legs  decent grilled chicken called Mediterranean section but nothing else looked interesting  saw shrimp clams but nothing seemed grilled spiced  Probably worst hummus here  Even usual suspects pizza Mac n cheese which kid friendly missing scarce   The drinks Service bottle wine package but didn't feel having then  server said policy open it! Bummer  red wine nice balanced Cabernet  other drinks ice teas sodas mimosas beers etc  server didn't return remainder dinner never asked refill drinks bring any other  waitresses dressing old French maid costumes but really old cannot keep tables  many empty tables but couldn't them cleaned time guests seated   I'd say forget French hype more traditional buffet next door pH  <EOR> This BEST buffet Vegas far! came breakfast absolutely incredible  crepe station must completely worth every second wait  Definitely try quiche's  absolutely nothing bad say this  <EOR> This placed use really good buffet  happened? family dinner left disappointed sad   hope someone reading reviews because looked forward eating here  use take 1 2 hours table today Saturday just walked no wait  food horrible  Just sad overall see great place down this  <EOR> Great service great food  trouble front but overall great dinning experience vegas  <EOR> This Paris hotel buffet   décor very nice French restaurant café   breakfast buffet favorite things Las Vegas  crepes outstanding   sweet savory selections available made before your eyes   also many other items don't always see elsewhere smoked salmon wide variety cheeses slab bacon eggs benedict various types potatoes sausages croissants pastries well several egg selections fruit   wife used prefer Bellagio breakfast buffet until she tried one  <EOR> Went BREAKFAST   wait actually bad   line between 8 9 a m  Saturday   Noticed huge line when left 10 a m   I'm sure else tasted because only think Crepe ate   wait crepe ridiculous!!!!

I remember lot different French dishes croissants cheeses etc  If recommend buffet anyone would brunch brunch alone  lunch dinner isn't best thing world   quality down lot Vegas buffets   Meats dry pastas watery crab legs no longer dungeoness   But whatever  If looking something little different terms atmosphere Le Village buffet I'd recommend if you're expecting much  <EOR> We visited Le Village champagne Sunday brunch during recent vacation Las Vegas memorable experience significant considering ate buffet every day week long stay  entire inside restaurant facade Paris village very different most buffets which look restaurant hotel   positives didn't stop decor though all really enjoyed food well!  There fresh made to order crepe station   disappointed bananas when apple filling cold warmed but crepes still delicious   French station roasted chicken leek mashed potatoes provencial dishes excellent   Another surprising highlight meal pretzel bread bread display   If visit buffet don't miss fresh pretzel bread!  Overall great variety dishes brunch breakfast foods fresh waffles more traditional French fare plentiful seafood station   The aspect meal really lacking service   flag waitress down several times refill glasses sat empty while she passed more occasion   would willing overlook service still recommend buffet wonderful Sunday brunch hope better waitress your visit! <EOR> This truly pay buffet  Le Village Buffet offers lower price buffet compared other competitors area  breakfast buffet weekend around $24 person which pretty reasonable  However selection buffet very limited  offer typical American breakfast items well omelet station  expecting wider variety pastry item located inside Paris building  also offer crepe station which very generous however pretty much only selling point buffet  Everything mediocre food just okay  would definitely recommend higher quality buffet even though may need spend few extra bucks  <EOR> Used BOGO groupon free bottle wine   Very underwhelmed buffet    the food pretty bland  duck al'orange tasted chicken baguette tasted really stale  dessert buffet only half full whole side empty   'French' dining experience never really want visit France! best thing Yukon gold mashed potatoes creme brûlée ok that favorite dessert glad least tasted decent! <EOR> The lines short  food excellent now if Le Village Buffet would only add beef wellington menu  would excellent addition both prime rib roast beef  <EOR> I haven't tried eating during lunch dinner  buffet BREAKFAST only!

Ugh  high hopes but completely let down  reoccurring theme dry pork roast beef tri tip duck  all dry scarily enough all tasted vaguely same! Prime rib looked way better tasted   Run away truffle macaroni  evil incarnate stunk funky garbage  Totally pungent nastiness   The majority other items tried tasted uninspired if cooked total apathy  like tone deaf cooking  Sauces questionable bland  Coq au Vin sauce  tasted vinegar vin !!  1 star service  staff friendly helpful which certainly appreciate  Also crepes crab good but its pretty hard screw right?  Yes village ambiance quaint cute but without decent food back just gimmick   Not worth cost ALL  back?  Absolument pas! <EOR> It's aiiiite   I came Saturday brunch   Someone else paid meal didn't wait line drank bottomless mimosas but STILL impressed   Perhaps buffet theory  What's ask?

Seafood far eye see   roast beef roast lamb roasted pork basically if meat could roasted   and ultimate favorite   ALL DRINK CHAMPAGNE   Yes little pricy it's $25 lines pretty ridiculously long but if you're Yelper worth salt easily drink eat drink $25 back without breaking into sweat   Plus you'll drunk full drunk rest day!  WIN! <EOR> Where begin? Sadly only breakfast but even hint some lunch items enough give four stars  pretty sure $21 99 per person breakfast buffet which came $51 something    I'm going lie sometimes felt lost maneuvering through buffet because décor little overwhelming made little hard find food  sounds little dumb but least once where didn't venture over area because didn't know another station full food  trying tell need walk around  some tucked away areas looked just dining but even more food! what?!?!?   again breakfast buffet  never seen many plates eggs potatoes potatoes eggs! plenty bacon sausage well  brioche waffles pancakes biscuits gravy  review getting hard write because really can't remember all food out! haha  Faves? Lyonese potatoes pasta dish truffle oil asparagus    Their dessert section LOT croissants other pastries carrot cakes cheesecakes crème brulee  Faves? tiny chocolate cake creme brulee   They made to order crepe station omelette station  hubby loved two crepes he loaded on caprese mixed berry  other hand tried omelette mushroom ham eggs which yum  probably loved most buffet two people operating two stations pleasant  didn't seem hate jobs even though only ones help line 10 15 people  sucker great customer service    Ok  contrary first server serious attitude  much she actually arguing table next us  going into much because she replaced another server able smile throw straws napkins table    All all buffet probably best Vegas  ones visited within past two years such disappointment waste money  Next time we'll come back dinner! Hopefully line isn't long though  lucky coming around 9 AM ish line practically nonexistent  <EOR> Came breakfast   omelettes crepes made order  Yum! Great breakfast service top notch too! <EOR> Are kidding me?!  eating scraps fucking dungeon   Never again  <EOR> This probably worst buffet ever to   $40 pp price representative quality selection food get   Albeit 9 45 they close 11 00 but should still same food 9 45 3 00 available   potatoes cooked through cutting through rock!  didn't hot crab legs instead chilled snow crablegs split them over cooked   only good thing buffet shrimp although peel eat   suggest walk through before spending hard earned money slop!  Wish would done that! <EOR> We purchased all day any buffet deals trying good number them over 24 hours   charged additional fee eat them which wasn't happy with   food good enjoyed some different choices see other places   Now super friendly people persons but didn't matter servers friendly   register hostess server many smiled even cared talk place busy   Drink refills dependable even though walk collect dirty plates   food give three stars but service   tip reflected dissatisfaction service received normally leave good tips where eat  <EOR> I didn't think would place reading low reviews but personally it!   I particularly love cassoulet seafood bouillabaisse yukon mash taters roasted mushrooms steamed various colored cauliflower  love french food particularly Provence dishes which most dishes perfect me   The desserts okay  Macarons creme brulee vanilla chocolate custard name few   It's great price lunch! 2 $54 95 <EOR> A joke   Three servers asked wanted drink  finally brought me  no Coke only Pepsi   Of vast buffet spread only 2 3 items looked halfway appetizing  sushi rock hard cold made wrong type rice especially atrocious making packaged stuff Kroger seem fit Japanese royalty   I think $3 49 appropriate price buffet but paid ten times  inexplicably long wait in  <EOR> We lunch based friend's recommendation  usually buffet Vegas don't want bloated feeling overeating  Thankfully buffet full delicious food made want enjoy just chow down money's worth!   The crepe station probably favorite  list savory sweet options they're all made fresh however want them  Bring few bucks tip guys quick really delicious crepes  other areas set according regions France but if you're most people just different food stations good selection different seafood such clams mussels shrimp  No crab legs lunch though bummer!   They also nice salad area sure save room dessert station! macaroons awesome believe few different flavors try  Everything great price average buffet didn't feel whale eating least 3 4 plates delicious food! buffet overwhelming some be  lot choices but many felt try all which probably why other buffets caused feel lethargic eating them    The service little off which why can't give them 5 stars  friends Diamond members already paid everyone  When arrived host over catering another group completely ignored us  When tried tell another host already paid just needed find group repeat several times host some reason still could understand kept telling line pay  ended finally ended calling friends come meet us  debacle things better waitstaff inside very attentive  <EOR> We did Buffet Buffets first stop man worth it!

Yum <EOR> This place used good but gone downhill last 2 years quality food buffet declined greatly fresh seafood smelled fishy tasted old meat pretty bland but desserts saving grace   Service generally slow unhelpful better places $25 dinner buffet  <EOR> Most expensive buffet vegas!   The quality food definitely better then Grand World buffet Rio though     I loved all deserts tons crab  mention chamapnge    loved it   Its worth wait line hour more place though   There plenty tasty stuff across way  <EOR> I Le Village Buffet   think unique buffet French spin giving little different feel others   really crepe station   always mushroom crepe delicious but trouble eating anything big buffet always end wasting it   need someone also likes mushrooms!  also love cheese selection although thought selection during most recent  visit little American     where brie?  unusual cheeses would liked more that   kind filled little salads cheese crepe but then course headed carving station some Prime Rib accompanied some cavatappi cream truffle couple types roasted potatoes   little disappointed Prime Rib little overcooked    no pink seen but still moist fairly tender something   trouble tracking down condiments condiment containers which little frustrating but breads yummy   The worst part food desserts   pretty weak unless love macaroons but sweet crepes crepe station if still room  great option   We lucky visit walked right into main line without being any switchbacks yet still took good 30 minutes before seated whole back overflow area completely empty!  line switchbacks behind filled Monday night apparently 7 15 time arrive!    We offered complimentary glass wine which cool but stuck sodas other waitress wasn't all that   service meh but enjoyed meal back   We Buffet Buffets included buffets but those paying paying $33 dinner   Also weekend brunch includes champagne  bad deal even though aren't getting Moet Chandon  <EOR> I many years ago thinking really impressive   latest trip taken 5 star review down 3   really nothing extraordinary buffet other fact Paris hotel   buffet really long either!  remember being lot fishy foods which could careless for   wait line Sunday evening 1 hour!  worth wait! <EOR> 4 stars breakfast brunch  HIghlighted crepe buffet  Never dinner here  <EOR> My wife decided give place visit 2 years ago   during new year   Chilled champagne being served buffet 3 stars possible 5  service 5 stars hands down    The prime rib pork chops tender    they made  any other deficiencies buffet     The champagne glasses re filled before knew it!

Tina macarons Soft serve ice cream Cookies Carrot cake Other cakes cookies   Our server very nice constantly refilling water glasses  The buffet good best town but still enjoyable  inside decorated old French streets  <EOR> Took surprise really great buffet  love ambiance and macaroons   food selection great every entree could hold own $10 plate nice cafe   My complaint did bug and Mom cobblestone walkways loud carts EVERYWHERE  whole meal hear 'rattle rattle rattle ' 'rattle rattle rattle ' 'rattle rattle rattle ' BAH! Anyways still great food return especially when stay Ballys Paris  If going soon check Groupon dinner wine deal <EOR> This buffet decent  liked healthiest buffet excluded Mexican Chinese food common Italian pizza  closest Asian food see Japanese sushi rolls  French seem known soups baked goods desserts see here   They muscles shrimp section crab legs lamb roast beef prime rib  other section crepes crackers dried meats  salads fruits own section  small buffet little bit wait  <EOR> Buffets usual selections dining Vegas but worth mentioning   Be warned wait time enter buffet but when travel friends VIP status seperate entrace no wait time!  But visit great food selection   I really enjoyed variety foods offered typcial iceberg salads roasted meats bland treats  Nope Paris Hotel offer speciality crepes made order speciality salads pastas parisian treats  really love uniqueness food selection  must try wine marinated fruit    its wonderful intoxicating alcohol! <EOR> Came bachelor party some delicious breakfast although wait little long worth it  bacon waffles superb  Definitely recommend! <EOR> Came Conference Las Vegas late lunch here  Irma server she Great !!!!! food good  <EOR> Very yummy! usually fan buffets but really liked place Came very large group an ENTIRE Filipino family seated less 10 minutes  thanks boyfriend's very slick grandma used tactics talked manager into seating immediately despite extremely long line   she does no ever know    but woman gifted   Anyway place really good! many healthy options don't feel gluttonous city sin  Lots fresh foods salads seafoods meats  personal favorite crepe bar!   I would come again! <EOR> Horrible food think French food just much butter such shame! all food taste nothing but butter even American stuffing Thanks Giving meals  Line breakfast over hour stupidly only put 1 cashier responsible collecting money scan people buffet passes then seat them well 1 single person doing job line 100 more people  worse line disneyland Thanks Giving  Seriously worst worst food Vegas even worth 2 dollars meal  everything blah soggy shrimps weren't even peeled  Never again even FREE!!! <EOR> Meh   I high expectations since virtually everyone Vegas raved particular buffet apparently buffets the thing Vegas assured I'd heck time indulging gastronomical glee   starving all day therefore good prospects visiting dinner   WELL     $25 dinner sure wasn't bad deal   But food variety quality weren't exactly par   Perhaps high expectations   But really wasn't WOW'd   Perhaps just reallly negative mood having written one star review Delta airlines such negativity spilling onto review   Nonetheless certainly wasn't wow'd Le Village buffet   addition disappointing food serving lady kept forgetting beverages utensils   But she sure did come enough times ask OK?? Kinda strange   Kinda   Fresh crepes Sure they're fresh all right   But since when crepes thick puffy hamburger buns??  texture off well   only thing liked crepes unlimited availability fresh blueberries   Oh yeah could forget  no chocolate ingredients creperie??  Now  outrageous!  What did availability fresh king crabs mussels   Also enjoyable decor but no music??!?!??     Meh  <EOR> The first time ate really really loved eat again recent visit   Sadly just wasn't same   still good but just good remembered   remembered being much bigger variety when two years ago but most recent visit seemed lacking   seemed lot same meats pastas   sushi also looked really unfresh stayed away that   price pretty good dinner decided just load crab legs   would still definitely come again because even though wasn't same still pretty darn good  <EOR> Have buffet before but recently  Used groupon dinner buffet last week included bottle wine they said wine substituted bottle charmat bulk process champagne WINE? Really? Anyway service ok wait long early weekday definitely worth going especially if discount  People complain wait should used fact if strip buffet summer prime time only one's going! Pluses snow crab pre split fairly tasty easy eat dessert selection above average agree creme brulee really good decent selection choices   Minuses salad bar selection little thin I wish some artichoke hearts but anchovies top your salad nice touch  beef bougignon when passed station  <EOR> This buffet just OK  Nothing special  food sorta run mill  only different thing tried which really good grilled vegetables tomato eggplant crepe station    The real star show desserts  just don't much sweet tooth didn't actually try any them  But luckily two girls collection some only pretty but looked good almost convinced some myself  Trust takes alot!   The biggest drawback really line  Sunday 12 waited almost 45 min place  Thats ridiculous buffet but guess thats having such good desserts  <EOR> Visited breakfast Valentine's Day  Arrived 15 minutes before opened waited line  7am when open line least 15 people long  5 minutes 7 finally came over open up  cashiers rude hostess never looked waitress brought coffee very pleasant   Coffee horrible  Food okay but line spread confusing but guess space needed large crowds  Scrambled eggs gross watery fruit station questionable bowls dirty!  I filled moneys worth but wouldn't back  <EOR> Just awful disappointing  place use favourite now just overpriced food tasted bad  returning again <EOR> Had high expectations seeing great reviews long line enter  very disappointed moment entered waiting 40min  Inside just crowded line outside  There's  wait prime ribs  Overall food nothing special  definitely worth wait  Feel people liking place haven't many buffets Vegas  <EOR> We May 2 1 Groupon deal alcohol   $45 paid 2 great dinner 3 glasses each champagne each loved it   If would paying full price $40 each might loved much   The highlights seafood crab legs split already you! steamer clams seafood stew shrimp     We also enjoyed cheeses crepes pasta different meats   left nice buzz full tummies     Our waitress Isela needs shout out   She really nice kept drinks coming plates cleared quickly   If comes groupon any discount site again I'd definitely it! <EOR> The buffet wasn't bad  highlight meal bottle wine mussels clams crepes    The servers friendly though timely  would wait least 10 min refills any drinks even plates cleared but when anyone showed very nice    I loved loved selection cheese  pretty much everywhere but some areas wish something eat w cheese  Perhaps am used eating cheese crackers even selection cold cut meats would help    The desserts present yummy no complaints    The thing frustrated most table uneven  kept wobbling literally surprised no cups fell ground   I would recommend place eat but keep mind mostly French inspired foods  <EOR> French onion soup good but sadly missing cheese  WTF FOS without cheese?!?! Prime rib WORLD!!!! Rolls dry  Truffle Mac cheese amazing! Creamy much flavor  Skip pasta thirds prime rib  Seriously  dream prime rib  Shrimp very fresh  Truffle mushroom crepe light fluffy   words don't justice  Small desserts just okay  Creme Brule sadly disappointing  Banana Nutella crepe middle road edible but outstanding  Cookie dough crepe HORRID! Stay away    The breakfast best strip IMHO  Just sure late morning stay while switch lunch <EOR> Food good most part  There's good selection but some items hit miss  expected pretty much any place this  rare prime rib good  surprised see two selections prime rib other well done  asked if anyone ever requests that  Seems shame me overcooked meat should against law lol  deserts delicious least tried  <EOR> This place lot cheaper top end buffets  Food pretty good buffet if really want *savoring* rather *shoving* food down your gullet then don't buffet    Also really only worth coming brunch lunch  Can't really crepes dinner   or you? <EOR> Les Miserables! waiting line 30 minutes opted pay extra $15 each skip front line  When inside place practically empty way wringing some extra money people cheap dry warmed over food tastes sitting around weeks  Le scam! <EOR> I warned friends come But ignored advice woefully regret it    Le Village Buffet THEE spot cousins would bust mission when little  many good memories place really wanted come back revisit those pleasant memories    Well    those nothing more illusions grandeur definitely failures romanticizing past    I came alone breakfast when friends all sleeping recovering nighttime adventures  remember really cheap $20 something breakfast buffet  people very nice accommodating      BUT FOOD!!!!!   Bleh plate grabbed horrible cut re arrange food plate look actually touched lady would take away    I liked eggs florentine ham grapefruit fruits orange juice    but quiche oily selection scrambled eggs disappointing steak potatoes overcooked  crepe okay but bananas soggy just brushed aside ate outside part nutella  didn't even want eat breakfast pastries    just chocolate croissants muffins danish cinnabuns etc    nothing special ordinary      This experience does even come close AMAZING remember Le Village Buffet be    Definitely worth stuffing face <EOR> Where begin?!?  Horrible food minimal selection dirty!    DON'T waste your money here     The food just low quality begin bad execution dishes   Duck dry prime rib different texture crab legs thinking just horrible   filled bread butter   The dessert area fruit flys macaroons station filthy dirty oily ceiling frames   said didn't dare try any desserts   sure ice cream yogurt machine fine      How add video fruit flies? <EOR> Yes am giving 5 stars buffet   I loved place because sometimes just don't know want  place incredible selection  food grouped region  find regional country fare dishes you'd hard pressed find menu anywhere outside France  don't put off its buffet  because size place turnaround most dishes minutes   Favorites seafood dishes desserts  Price $25 + drinks my last visit <EOR> I food decent  choices others  Love steak woulf love comeback more   <EOR> The line being short kind told tale Le Village before in  However buffet pass felt obligated try it  rough  drink service impossibly slow most food just if long  <EOR> If looking eat any kind meat dont even think all overcooked meat tough tastes cardboard   food major fail however only thing pleasant desserts crepe station great!

No wonder buffet part 24 hr buffet deal  worth money time  <EOR> I initially loved place would come least once every time town   last trip though realized wasn't really worth $20 price tag unless eat ton food   pretty much just crepe banana caramel omelette ham cheese full eat anything else   they ton variety though if trying lot food then place you   The creperie across walkway see other review better crepes huge decided probably just grab crepe now breakfast save half money    <EOR> I groupon say BEST CREME BRULEE EVER  Often don't creme brulee because weird burnt taste  Maybe am just much plebe understand joy it  However LOVED here   The place sort interesting because monday line ENORMOUS  stood line while checked god two bottles wine which pretty terrible but meals couldn't complain much  Also seated table which no utensils took them forever u utensils   I personally thought food very good buffet type setting  If food buffet medium probably would more harsh but pretty decent  dolma kinda aweful but different stews pasta dishes very decent especially considering medium buffet    The decor wasn't anything write home don't know if would back but awesome place take your family eat  <EOR> Like most Vegas buffets recently gone down bit quality but think still good worth it  Definitely good lunch $31 each  Some best ice cream bread pudding ever tasted!  sides great meats decent but kinda dry heat lamps  preopened crab legs small but there's plenty them  <EOR> Average buffet food nothing write home about  breakfast here  Service little slow wait while refill orange juice  bunch bacon scrambled eggs but large selection  Lighting dim place needs brightened up!

Sanitation problems would some roaches your omellets? dark dingy dining area food substandard price pay  staff even cleared table half way through brunch left no table  Watch Mr  Ramsey some creepy crawlers next door might find way your kitchen  Just turn around straight Bellagio guaranteed you'll great buffet experience Vegas  <EOR> I don't really low ratings all    absolutely love place!

Spend $50 buffet Caesars Palace! <EOR> I tried buffet impressed not worth money   charged holiday cost even though no mention website  dinner Saturday expected pay $30 99 stated website but nope cost more  cool  Additionally wasn't lot food options  liked most macaroons only 2 flavors flan  also unfriendliness staff waitress poor service because thirsty she's around refill drink  Also tip expected upfront before try food service thought backwards  Defeats point tipping  <EOR> Loved buffet  apart $55 24hr buffet passes  Best buffet choose pass options  Line bit long but quickly  Well worth wait  A+ desserts!!! <EOR> The only reason place gets 4 stars because huge fans buffet RIO  place great selection food all great epsecially surprised good Prime Rib mean all buffets vegas serve prime rib but great awesome flavor ws cooked perfectly  If stay paris worth least trip  <EOR> This third buffet within 24 hours buffet buffets  came breakfast  fruit crepe wasn't bad ok   I wanted egg benedict breakfast when station egg benedict looked kind dry very enticing against judgment ahead one   When tried cut muffin couldn't even cut piece ten tries eventually gave egg looked very dry must sitting serving pan knows long mind only 9 30 AM Monday morning  never experience able cut piece muffin ever   So tell good buffet suppose be? Does deserve 4 5 stars rating? am talking egg benedict your daily American common breakfast mess bad can't even cut piece muffin ten tries? Even if IHOP order egg benedict know sure cut muffin enjoy egg benedict   Base egg benedict experience Le Village Buffet restaurant buffet didn't impress much all  Otherwise rest common breakfast scramble eggs bacons just any regular restaurants   Oh way wife green apple took bite threw away  asked why? Apple even fresh enough edible  <EOR> I stayed Paris hotel during trip Vegas naturally wanted check breakfast buffet  scenery cute atmosphere only saving grace buffet  really does give Paris feel magical vibe  Beyond place nothing more mediocre think  even generous statement  food selection decent but didn't find quality good  Some food cold appeared sitting long time  Also service very slow sporadic  Its buffet would think would little no commentary service but rely them beverages  took waitress good ten minutes greet us     and thirsty hung over wanted damn coffee OJ! Vegas tons buffets choose if crosses your path skip right over it  recommend Casears breakfast brunch buffet theres no comparison  <EOR> I don't know prev  people complaining must miserable cause best buffet Vegas  Using French cooking techniques certainly way when choosing place eat  cooking down science best!

Your enjoyment any buffet contingent upon managing your expectations  Le Village Buffet summed such expect French cuisine!   Done   That being said stuffed crepes far star but also loved mini quiches course standard breakfast fare potatoes bacon sausage etc  desserts also plentiful delicious  <EOR> We bypassed longer line due platinum rewards  food MEH  Crepes ok  Prime rib good however half over seasoned salt! literally taste salt all over meat chewing spit out! pilaf rice also very salty  cute little french village vibe but food really needs improve  sure if odd time off day but desserts zero labels! only thing tasted good creme brulee flan    Pretty sad buffet! Service decent but lacking compared nearby hotels  sum nicer hometown buffet  <EOR> Pros connected Ballys where stayed huge variety food crepe station     Cons same food repeated every day   I kind disappointed only buffet tried while Vegas  Only because group extremely hung over hungry  willing walk other buffets blazing hot sun! Let alone take taxi wait long buffet lines     Food ok but wish changed bit   Service consistent very polite workers    I loved crepe station! must try while there! <EOR> So much buffet person but reading reviews and fact stayed Paris decided should give whirl   showed 10 50am Thursday just switch breakfast items lunch   First stop omelette station   don't think guy cooked omelette enough since wound being little runny   Oh well made order crepes which HUGE!!!!! more made it!  also enjoyed little quiches   brownies super yummy    I grabbed way out   Basically awesome place come when want eat 20 thousand calories  <EOR> Having come two three times past believe buffet changed  don't actually remember far back ro determine whether good change bad    think  final decision end review   I guess start off liked MACARONS  Similiar many teenagers pre teen adolesents whatever hell am whatever right now  moment believe pricey little pastries ranging $1 50 $3 50 hype hype  guess because expensive is  Anyways macarons here  think ate 4 5  understand now macarons almost every Vegas buffet but believe wasn't before  last time very few pastries think enjoyed  Actually don't think French obbessed person then might haven't noticed  Well case think just wasted whole paragraph  Because strolling through buffet Yes full sitting down walking instead can't name extraordinary thing place  Everything rather medicore nothing wouldn't find hometown    Most meat dishes salty  baguettes sort stale  Okay Vietnamese used crunchy French bread   majority dishes same just sauce altered  macarons actually tasting bit stale chewy I don't know if any know talking 3rd so  crêpes aren't all good  La poulet Um    isn't word chicken masculine?   chicken honestly looked smashed little rocks something  wasn't really favorful anything  guess should've tried sweet crêpe  Another thing I'd point desserts section composes around 4 5 dishes  many different plates but each plate contains same thing  When some mushy cheesecake chocolate mousse  chocolate chip cookies French right? but even switched out  Now everything's peanut butter cookies  labels 30% dishes wrong  think 90% mislabeled foods desserts section though    I'm big fan seafood but crab legs appear pretty fresh  fact chefs cook pasta other dishes right front you  Other sections ahem desserts seem stacks stacks premade stale food   Overall scenery overall environment pretty good  apologize inconsistant opinion  few good things few bad things    One last things I'd mention some French incorrect  suppose creators just wanted put conjugates Americans could understand better  Although might wrong part  ask teacher confirmation  big part review isn't affecting rating   EDIT going Bacchanal buffet add another star its price  much cheaper one  don't care if buffet more options wasn't worth it  <EOR> Super Bowl weekend guys 2 buffets day embarassing but do  did Bellagio Mandalay Bay Paris   Paris buffet review breakfast lunch   winner hands down   Mandalay Bay looking old did King Crab legs sliced half dinner remaining selection weak  would pass   Paris ate twice wished gone dinner over MBay   Nice combination everything homemade crepes nice wide variety carnivore foods carbs carbs carbs little cups creme brulee quite yum   Bellagio buffet seemed over rated   side note cannot believe 5 people playing blackjack $300 hand minimum table Bellagio   those people work ! sign up! <EOR> I happy choices all  buffet you're suppose variety its best  choices slim wasn't even good  If you're going lots variety then dish better outstanding  Such disappointment  <EOR> My husband visited Thursday night around 5  waited line 40 minutes  line moved rather quickly  Once seated use ladie's room   When entered vomit floor wet floor sign  unpleasant experience found difficult eat  Overall selection minimal  husband said prime rib good  did eat salty rather flavorless  waiting awhile decided see if could use ladie's room  Nope vomit still there   twenty thirty minutes later  Really? informed waiter hoped would taken care of  gave any hope using bathroom  only really good thing found visit waiter  He great bringing drinks when ours empty  Desserts tasted cheap mass produced  When ordered crepe cook seemed annoyed serve me  would suggest buffet many others visit  <EOR> We came 3 15 pm Sunday which interesting because change menu brunch dinner  Coincidentally charged dinner rate $30 instead $18   Brunch way included all you can drink champagne  Yay! The food good  fact above average buffet  But here's thing where French food? far could tell might qualify French Onion Soup Eggs Benedict Crepes Creme Brulee  Yes its true always told cooking French food takes time care wee bit TLC but come there's few dishes could add menu  If space issue try taking away sushi area which areas buffet kind sad actually   all buffets need all things all people but should certain consistency   Help Vegas if all buffets verge being same why don't just least expensive one? Anyways agree other yelpers definitely could better system drinks  Nevertheless server nice attentive  No complaints there   Overall 3 5 stars  bad great  Just buffet  <EOR> Food okay but few stood me  made order crepes best  choose sweet savory  ordered banana nutella  best dessert  whip cream homemade great  added ice cream mine good!!  Another favorite mine Yukon mash potato  buttery creamy   The prime rib great depending cook  first half dining experience great chef made prime rib juicy tender  When thirds new chef new slab meat wasn't good first  <EOR> LOVED buffet  access through $59 24 hour access deal ate twice dinner breakfast  line fresh made crapes well all usual buffet staples  plenty sample every empty plate looked delicious and mostly was    One thing say staff wisely there  tend eat late 4 00 which lunch perfect time just walk in  But just half hour later line spans down block Paris  All while restaurant half empty should really more staff   So buffet buffet deals far best four restaurants tried  <EOR> Came dinner buffet Sunday night which ended being $30+ person   ambiance very cute sitting French courtyard outside    Overall food OK wasn't particularly blown away prime rib bit dry overdone but yet find buffet serves delicious mouth watering meat! standouts crepe station you savory sweet creme brulee king crab legs   king crab legs sweet fishy tasting all if stock those probably experience most worthwhile!  2 buffets which breakfast buffet Wynn between two say Wynn blew Paris away next time most likely opt try Wynn dinner buffet  <EOR> Creme brulee!!!! best! lemon meringe donno spell it pie! haha <EOR> Awesome such upgrade flamingo which tried earlier  crepes just phenomenal  banana hazelnut Nutella crepe first then berry crepe strawberries blueberries raspberries  whipped cream  both fantastic  all sorts fresh stations carvings breakfast meats  place breakfast but early 10 30 line 40 people deep moving <EOR> Hmmmm sure why place some Vegas Best Buffets list dreadfull   dinner line pretty long 45 minute wait food must good right?

Luckily wasn't wait line just casino played while waited call  Finally hour half he hit front line finally time eat    The first thing noticed layout design buffet  supposed look some French street market whatever there's main dining floor which cobblestone paths whatever little rooms sides which where seated  horrible theme completely bad layout  rooms looked little village shops something space 4 tables 20 seats but just horrible design  biggest complain if all those walls knocked down all rooms eliminated could probably seat another 200 people any given time which would alleviate wait line but getting more people once  could see rooms being nifty little idea especially if you're filling room your own party but when there's 5 other parties great  rooms somewhat isolated fairly quiet fun hearing other family's kids yelling having buzz restaurant drowning out    The food  The food nothing nothing special really  honestly don't remember much food  wasn't anything different could gotten local casino but half price  think cost $40 per person dinner buffet worth all     One thing remember flow buffet good  People just kept cutting front no clue where flow buffet line every time buffet would come back aggravated annoyed much side stepping point point b    Overall I'd say stay away  money you're better off going nice place ordering decent meal opposed going tourist buffet  <EOR> I came during trip because found Groupon place  When realized paid same amount Groupon charge dinner thought special Groupon then? unlimited Mimosas wine beer Groupon didn't matter because don't drink that  Anyway place French inspired lamb duck cheese trays whatnot  tried tri tip lamb tasted exactly same weird  selection choose large all  ordered mimosa orange juice bad tasted very cheap  only thing cool good crepe station  man making crepes anything wanted really good to  only reason why gave two stars  Lines long slow  wait 40 minutes just seated  returning  <EOR> $34 99 Saturday dinner but if you're Total Rewards Diamond cardholder whatever Gold then might buffet comped because Paris part group   I'd say experience just ok impressed all Vegas buffet given competition gone new buffets opening Wicked Spoon oh so glorious Bacchanal buffet everyone should least once   Anyhow back Le Village buffet  best part bucket crab legs ordered table  Five course devoured all crab legs  believe snow crab Alaskan King but both happy camper chowing down crab! entrees bad edible but nothing great  enjoyed French onion soup some pasta duck but could tell didn't put any effort which quite disappointing    Even more disappointing dessert section    REALLY? Cookies buffet? kidding me? creme brulee wasn't done well  old caramelized sugar crispy anymore  walked around dessert booth twice didn't pick ANYTHING  just tried bite friend's creme brulee   No Vegas buffet worth goin' if ain't good desserts   Service amazing though! Loved server  friendly helpful cheerful    The decor buffet ok  Honestly doesn't look place dine  Maybe because walls don't all way feel still eating shopping mall food court kind deal  Weird  know other buffets Bacchanal doesn't actual room walls but decor much more restaurant food court     Bottom line food ok coming next time  Would pay come but since free still experience  <EOR> So 2 weeks ago high expectations  no line which good paid $25 per person lunch  seemed reasonable since most other buffets Vegas around price more  seating area looked sitting alley which okay giving theme  sushi cold tasted box  salad bland  selection different varieties pretty sad  Felt walked into cheap cheap buffet felt cheated money  message whoever runs it invest better chefs better quality food better selection people spending hard earned money eat your buffet  never back Paris buffet  Even server didn't seem caring    crack smile  loved inside Paris hotel casino but unfortunately staying hotel does care enough feed its customers good food  If your someone does eat meat chicken don't even bother  buffet doesn't really much offer you  Wish would've saw before paid  <EOR> Had while! decided give another  try   waste time! Gone way way down hill   only thing french place its location Paris Hotel   food tasteless lacked authenticity   only thing worthwhile crepe station   Save your money   Eat elsewhere better lot less  <EOR> First visit here   first thing noticed smaller Rio   lot smaller   small buffet but difficult compare Rio   Selection little limited but good food  Custom crepes cool   both savory  sweet crepes   didn't much but other people including wife seemed them lot    Other crepes most dishes French expected   obligatory chunks o' meat turkey ham prime rib there   Ordinary sides   some dolmas which unique    mac cheese really good because appeared made good pasta cheeses usual orange sludge often finds    Again food good   But mostly similar other buffets   really hoped more French food buffet here  <EOR> I much say Buffet am just going point things loved didn't love much  food mediocre many items chose especially since eat meat  But thing loved place crêpe section dessert area  banana Nutella crêpe yumm delicious  also different flavors macaroons which loved  Over all bad spot but favorite  <EOR> Seating environment claustrophobic drink service rather slow  Food options kid friendly  Prime rib awesome  <EOR> Quality service gone way down   charge $15 99 toddlers over 4 which think ridiculous   only reason gave place 2 stars because crepe station chef awesome best crepe town  <EOR> It's really good buffet   good variety choices  food really tasty crepes delicious   ice tea amazing   loved it! <EOR> Hands down best buffet Buffet Buffets package deal!

The service could've more attentive diners wait longer would just flag them down missing straws drinks refills    Overall nice experience  Loved atmosphere  <EOR> Fortunately saved another buffet down strip day pass only reason giving 2 stars but easily worst tasting food vacation   did best sample everything buffet but honestly everything besides fresh shrimp cocktail horseradish sauce very appetizing food did taste good looked     The atmosphere fine but  why we're really we?  meats dry vegetables weren't seasoned well food wasn't served very warm    maybe staffed C team Monday? <EOR> The lines buffett outrageous! finally mustered gumption wait line breakfast morning just see all fuss about  say food really good very wide selection  made order crepes hey when Paris which delicious then later some egg dishes carved ham  man being meatoholic enjoyed some more greasy fair  price worth but hungry order your money's worth prepared wait line while  Also sure take your ID if want use your room card payment gate keeper would allow use mine because happened time left room without ID  understand suppose luckily cash otherwise we'd back end long queue! <EOR> We used groupon Le Village Buffet even came bottle red wine! wine average wine snobs but super great deal  service really lovely never felt annoying servers when asked refills extra stuff   Hands down best macarons ever had! Granted haven't over Paris but seriously kicked ones Trader Joe's freezer's ass  Wooooooooooooo wee those macarons  Once figured macarons much better anything else just kept shoveling them into mouth passed later major food coma sugar overload   Other notable items include crepe bar various carved meat stations   DEM MACARONS THO  <EOR> Every time Vegas hit buffet  Last time just before 11 started during breakfast food quickly changed lunch  going keep timing mind cause worked great variety  great selection foods salad carving station crepe station potatoes any way could imagine them lets forget dessert  Creme brulee yum! <EOR> What horrible disgusting overpriced Easter buffet   paid almost $100 three worth it   menu sounded very promising but half food never made buffet   husband still looking duck l'orange   things did weren't good   lamb dry crab legs just gross cheese salad selection pitiful   quality food general just worthy price   Before discovered Aladdin buffet which doesn't exist anymore used hit Paris buffet every trip   worth back then much better selection better quality food   Now could easily same quality garbage buffet half price   very disappointed  <EOR> Interesting  came middle week  said expected subpar since its cheaper lunch  course most buffets bust good stuff dinner on weekends    Honestly nothing memorable place beside custom crepe making station which took advantage course  food different since seems French based don't find mush Asian cuisine if any American food matter  mean ambiance nice since entire district where buffet modeled look Paris  service ok though  nice server she kinda dragged getting plates cleared getting drinks  Maybe if come during weekend dinner enjoy place more   I ran things say  <EOR> Food surprisingly good buffet lot different things eat  really French recipes but world food  themed rooms represent different regions France waiters dressed accordingly  Service good  Would deserve 4 stars but NO French fries    disappointing  <EOR> We came line but line moving really fast  glad because starving  thought buffet okay  Better Caesars but nothing compared buffets Rio! Food fresh thought selection pretty good  side note some reason outside buffet reminded Downtown Main Street Disney way things set up   Food edible but nothing spectacular  <EOR> This okay quite big wide selection some other ones least lunch  few very good dishes wine poached pears French onion soup    Probably should tried desserts people saying good things creme brûlée crepes looked very good but huge doing 24 hour buffet buffets didn't want stuff ourselves   Sorry picky but reason knocked down only two stars because everything incredibly poorly labeled  unlabeled  labels still lying around breakfast clearly wrong  just frustrating wasteful end some stuff didn't know like  <EOR> I always end never fails us   consistent absolutely love coffee   There's much say buffet because all buffet's Vegas pretty much accomplish same thing    rid hangovers   Everything fresh eggs good coffee good  all need  <EOR> such yummy vegas buffet! place if your super hungry great selection different foods desserts! may line seated because place always pretty busy when its open its around 30$ per person  make sure hit Crepe station  MmmmmGood <EOR> Pretty standard stuff overpriced same money could better meal elsewhere  <EOR> This buffet worth $33 charge  food mediocre best  would suggest any friends family  <EOR> I should preface review two things  one think eating massive amount food sitting mildly gross unless food fabulous two sort hurry when Le Village   Hurrying while trying eat buffet style disgusting your stomach feel going pop     Buffet food no matter tasty still buffet food   food Le Village may good but piling random assortment foods plate everything mixed  salmon leek sauce mixed crab juices mixed creamed spinach mixed pork=gross   ended eating mostly crab melted butter     Also impressed desert selection   missed crepes the line long hurry show but cherry tart boring tasted very doughy     The best part besides crab legs atmosphere waiter   french village theme cute waiter amazingly quick clearing plates bringing drinks checking us  <EOR> I put 3 1 3 because good 4 but still more ok  liked all seafood options salmon trout great bouillabaisse fact overwhelming some other buffets  desserts definitely disappointing  would probably come back now experienced it  But Le village better many other buffets tried dinner  crowded all  <EOR> We came back another family gathering  Everything clean  happy prior issues resolved  still enjoy food atmosphere  coming back again  <EOR> $27 dinner  8pm last saturday night hour wait  The place crowded much seemed little dirty couldn't tidy fast enough     The bad The ginger ale tasted extremely watered down   The stone crab claws already cracked somewhat but tried few different ones unsuccessful getting anything them also managed slice finger open trying  Friend some snow crab legs but just looked soggy aged me   I excited see brie bacon mac cheese but promptly disappointed quality   The decent The lamb good gamey  Crepe station pretty neat long wait Spectacular but worth it    Overall don't remember darn thing food  very unremarkable   and good the reason place gets 2 stars Creme Brulee!!! lucked snagged some but friend dessert came back without saying chef caramelizing tops weren't yet  back try remaining desserts she asked pick creme brulee but again time    Caesar's buffet same price I'd recommend that  3 weeks prior same time 8pm Saturday night no wait  <EOR> I appreciated low price being Vegas buffet especially taking option crab legs into consideration  However think taste low price  crab legs conveniently split down middle making feasting simple fast  little disappointed taste  Overall little disappointed quality food offered but would back low price decent options  <EOR> Went lunch during vegas trip fiancé friends also engaged  buffet no expectations because never really heard anything it  However surprise decor well food exceeded expectations  decor cute mimicked streets exteriors French shops boutiques bakeries etc  Loved vibe buffet interior   They handful different stations  Compared other more known buffets LV lacked variety multicultural dishes but quality food great unique  Plus theme buffet obviously Parisian theme obviously won't different ethnic foods  However some sushi rolls  never seen LV buffet Crepe station made order   Yes crepes!!    I'll definitely back    even if just crepes  <EOR> I think buffet Paris just good Bellagio cheaper too  Luckily stay lot when town business invariably ended here  even better when company's dime  <EOR> Came during Memorial Day weekend Sunday   Arrived around 11 30am line already long  party 12 keep mind 17% gratuity added parties 8 more  Ask sit Kay Billy's service  great job making sure taken care super sweet   Highlights HOLIDAY BRUNCH $34 99 Create your own crepe bar omelet bar BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS  Just wish could take bottle champagne if aren't done Crab legs pre cut Creme Brulee good macarons weren't  Prime Rib decent especially mashed potatoes sauteed mushroom Everything else just okay   Other would probably come back some point  <EOR> Disgusting smells bad  Some food may spoiled  Long lines lunch  Long lines crepe stand  Expensive get  Crepes made quick left undercooked  Ordered ham cheese crepe ham warm cheese melted  Waited 20 minutes crepes made without any love respect  2 years ago then crepes great  considered asking refund  Just don't it! <EOR> Thanks making reservation didn't wait long line door  able enter VIP entrance taken care immediately    The food selection great  end breakfast just before brunch able best both worlds  price reasonable believe paid breakfast price $24 99 per person included champagne  <EOR> Was impressed Paris buffet   know am minority but really wasn't any better cruise cuisine   Just across buffet crepe place LaCrepes? fabulous bakery next door also wonderful  <EOR> As far service ok  As far good feel quality fell off since last visited   I brought gf show good buffet Paris unfortunately good remembered   Quite few food labels wrong things changed over breakfast know plenty time 3 hours The desserts very appetizing  Especially macarons     I don't mind giving place another try future hope things improve  <EOR> Picked place because atmosphere decorations didn't exactly food but still disappointed quality  paying extra holidays price $36 99 waited hour half expect would worth it  contrary food tasted average nothing stand all tasted same  advertised creep disappointed cream unmelted butter fresh berries  creep spice market buffet much better even don't advertised it  light room dimmed sleepy unfortunately BC food  good thing service prompt table  thank servers working hard  <EOR> Can't help but enjoy French decor little Francois Village atmosphere different designs buildings exterior cobblestone flooring sky blue ceiling    We seated promptly small little room ourselves three windows own personal server    least appeared way  So expect buffet? Zeeeee crab legs Zeeeee butter  Le Prime rib   c'est tres bien  I suggest natural juices provide your prime rib mashed potatoes  Tri tip steak snuck when almost done yet saved enough room it  Slightly red middle excellent flavor wish made more room this  A great finish meal well prepared creme brûlée tart small variety berries it  Superb service waiter fresh cup coffee made quite evening relaxation   Would return? Oui oui monsieur <EOR> This review Le Village's breakfast buffet only  told many people great breakfast buffet is but personally don't see nor understand why anyone would think any good  Maybe since only tried breakfast Vegas probably best compared others? Seriously though only thing enjoyed grapefruits strawberries  Everything else just simple breakfast food bagels oatmeal bacon ham etc  tasted average if pretty bad     However setting design decors buffet just very nice  basically French village underneath blue beautiful sky  Also cool different food stations  station where fresh crepes another where omelettes freshly made just it   Here's wrong many different variety scrambled eggs stations  Everything eggs eventually just quite overwhelming  Another thing fruits  Some fruits tasted weird did taste fresh all  grapes tasted soft weird while honeydew cantaloupe sweet all  Then drinks tried coffee which tasted horrible grapefruit orange juice which both tasted horribly    The service horrible!! Besides waitress very nice lovely everyone else rude! ordered crepe wanted regular Nutella crepe nothing inside    tried tell chef but he didn't hear wasn't listening asked number  thought pick number said one  Then just leave stuff out  mean  knew he even started crepe  when asked politely if he exclude bananas such since just wanted Nutella  He said much attitude Don't say then! Well excuse rude guy! did say wanted but asked number!   At omelette station guy before ordered two eggs prepared sunny side up  cook broke both them asked guy it  just thought funny  Other places throw away new ones  Anyways point service isn't good  If didn't say anything rude just looked though having worst morning lives just hated working there    Personally if don't buffet buffet pass wouldn't try place wouldn't recommend place anyone  But  just me  <EOR> First time Paris buffet  little bit wait although line long  started off really good until waitress left substitute  flag down refill everytime while he free fill Spanish speaking table next smile  What's going on? All all food good but there's better buffets there  won't back due fact service bad  bad section sever ignored us  Others looked good service  coming back Donato server  No thanks!! <EOR> I am very impressed some food Vegas specially buffets   over expectations   Food good options great waitress outstanding    Would def again when visit Vegas again  <EOR> I could eat crepes little parisian village all day long!   My two favorite things buffet crepe station atmosphere   I've eaten twice but first time last day bachelorette party years ago don't remember whole lot    last time during Buffet Buffets experience which promise review   soon I'd say favorite buffet them all   We breakfast big breakfast person already started off disadvantage through no fault own!  stood line good while but once close being seated could take full effect ambiance mood transformed!  cute place?!  food set little village cafes where choose selection food   seated little cottage off side   adorable   The food selection ranged your basic breakfast buffet foods   eggs bacon sausage french toast various types potatoes etc   omelette bar which did take advantage because quite happy egg mushroom tomato scramble   first plate typical breakfast choices headed straight crepe station   line substantial I started worry server would clear table thinking we'd left but entertained watching crepes being made now  talent I'd master!    many choices   to easy order organized menu into savory hearty meal like sweet more dessert like    also customize your order if none menu items tickle your fancy   fruity berry husband banana Nutella one   Both magnificently delicious!

Tips Set reservation online avoid lines  Then walk through VIP side much shorter wait  groupon online unfortunately could use because day chose eat brunch but great deal check before come  I think only use weekends Rather ask 2 mimosas ask champagne just your own mimosas table  Save your waitress time people  If see crepe line 4 people deep less run line  line fluctuates pretty slow because crepe men pretty awesome perfecting each one  <EOR> Had 10 years  did disappoint  made reservations Sunday buffet  Highly recommend reservations avoid long line   The selection mind boggling  sausages quiche fabulous  crepes beyond delicious! Omelettes made order  Dessert selection huge! coffee mimosa excellent  service very good too  Add your list when Vegas  <EOR> When checked next door Bally's man helping mentioned great 24hr buffet deal $50 dollars  Basically he said visit ALL Caesar resorts buffets much want 24 hrs  though amazing deal could lunch Paris dinner Caesar's breakfast somewhere else all $50 dollars!  We purchased wrist bands Paris woman said Yes good ALL Caesar's resorts  dinner Caesar's later day checking hostess she said oh know pay ADDITONAL $30 per person right? WHAT?! total rip off  should known good deal good true  stamp little thing back your receipt stating pay little $15 upgrade Caesars buffet  bothers read fine print back receipt? If would known would extra would never bothered  also wouldn't walk 74 year old father clear across strip all trouble  Paris didn't offer anything rectify confusion really feel bad other people falling deal  All being said Paris buffet some good things regards food The brioche French toast salmon roasted sweet potatoes pasta dishes all favorites    Some good Lack fresh fruit veggies salad offerings very poor   The crepe station   the bananas nutella crepes mushy weird swimming some sweet mystery liquid then drenched whipped topping lord knows else    Go across way La Creperie pay $10 decent crepe   There many other places Vegas eat wouldn't come again <EOR> As parents continuing Labor Day weekend Las Vegas trip decided stay dined dinner Le Village Paris Casino Hotel 9 7 2015  parents enrolled silver rewards card free buffet coupon offer dine some participating casinos excited enjoy incredible offer trying place out!  As entered Le Village atmosphere quite confusing yet French village ways  concept remains same main casino lobby does  table time VIP area server followed find great table spot   The service done great job serving customers accordingly  No problems issues all!

Personable service   Go  <EOR> It 14 years since last Le Buffet honestly say nothing changed good thing   We breakfast  am being generous 2 stars   really 1 5 best  The inside Buffet poorly laid out  Good thing nearly empty run maze back table    My omelette heavy led  ever sprayed pan overpowered omelette  blech Then slow slow crepe line  only 8 people ahead twenty minute wait   Crepe nothing special   Hubby thrilled meal  He did almond pastry said best thing there  Whoopee   This Buffet needs serious upgrade     I want also add ladies room closest buffet nasty  think last attended 14 years ago when last too  <EOR> Had breakfast here  Tuesday morning 10 a m  line wasn't long 15 in  seated drinks brought over right away  selection incredible! made order omelets good but best made order crepes!! cherries mine chocolate sauce whipped cream top    best! If found first wouldn't taken omelet bagel lox!! would definitely again!!! <EOR> I impressed breakfast buffet  actually ate breakfast twice  french toast extremely yummy  does rate higher 3 stars because waitstaff horrible LAZY! took them nearly 15 mins refilled drinks  main reason why waiting line long because hostesses take sweet time seat then seat fasest away buffet possible  may 5 tables open front place way back  seem continue leave LOT open tables when waiting line extremely long  <EOR> Las vegas such amazing places eat them    very typical breakfast buffet but way overpriced first once sat down took good 10min take drink order     Mimosas included which found funny because come $25 something dollar person would think would included yet play slot machines  50 drink free omelet station very little topics    bakery items okay bear claws blue berry muffins chocolate muffins   fruit selection very sad   cheap fruit cantaloupe pineapple bananas  runny eggs different kind sausages okay  give them though buffet itself super cute really ties whole french theme  felt beauty beast french corner lol  did nice crepe station which im sure why charge much   nice nutella banana crepe   Overall place really just OK  wanted check since first time vegas just vegas bucket list sort thing  would come back $$ just breakfast <EOR> Good variety food  Don't forget try crepe line awesome  crab legs ok good more expensive buffet Wynn  line long during holiday seasons 2 hours   did dinner Christmas packed  May come back but during holiday season  <EOR> Came Saturday evening no wait   Highlights prime rib crab legs creme brulee   Everything else average   Service prompt friendly  <EOR> Not buffet lover but decided since  Vegas needed try one  Le Village Buffet rated best Vegas see why  food delicious plenty it  can't imagine anyone making through all selections available  Please save room dessert should started here  lunch buffet price high end Vegas buffets but Paris but worth extra dollars sure good food  Very little wait but weekday  pay your meal asked if want add additional amount drinks  if going drinking alcohol more glass pay it  Dress casual lunch  <EOR> Got breakfast buffet catching sunrise top PH parking lot   was extremely satisfying  Cute setting tons pastries attentive service! Brought back wandering around France bit   will definitely check place lunch dinner sometime champagne Sunday brunch sounds incredible! <EOR> My boyfriend bought Buffet Buffets pass all CET properties decided hit Le Village Buffet Paris breakfast especially reading best breakfast buffets Vegas  Unfortunately did plan well ended having wait half hour hour line  time finally seated serving lunch    The ambiance decor cute made look actually dining French village  service prompt food varied your usual buffet food  boyfriend enjoyed mussels which he said always first items disappear!   The best part buffet made order crepe station  usually line but does move pretty quickly  crepes delicious definitely worth wait! <EOR> Love place  Used stay Paris usually every time we'd stop place lunch dinner   This buffet good quality nice ambience affordable   I'd also throw everything homerun  buffet times when things sit long occasional bad batch    just use common sense don't eat those   Good take friends dates coworkers potentially customers  <EOR> We came DINNER food high end pastas meats sea foods decent me  wouldn't come again but good time experience  desert wasn't all either  view nice though     I recommend RIO BUFFET lot buffets number one <EOR> AWFUL!!! Boy quality food customer service value your money gone down!!!!! Wynn buffet CHEAPER WAAAY better!  Skip buffet worth ALL! <EOR> It's your usual buffet  expected more French theme i e  cheeses crepes charcuterie more traditional entrees such coq au vin boeuf bourguignon duck confit braised rabbit perhaps some dijon dishes  also expected better pastry dessert station  Overall though fine  just don't think big buffets anymore  <EOR> For price pay   Honestly lot! most delicious Creme brûlée crema Catalana usually only find Spain    But theirs tasted incredible  Theresa wide variety suitable anyone  pesceterian happy find crab   crab already peeled too! Pretty worth price! <EOR> Go between 10 30 11am  let breakfast price yet enjoy lunch menu  Obviously waiting line looooong waited 40 50 min but wasn't bad  They variety foods desserts loved quality  Try steak melting mouth You might wanna share your crape your friend  tried banana crape good but could only ate half them  <EOR> I gave extra star ONLY because crepes amazing! mMmMMMMMm!!! Honestly BEST crepe EVER had! am proud say Filipino lady making it! LOL Anyways brunch OK  amazing but average quality  Kind annoying since lot food repetitive ex  bacon eggs same exact type least if going twice turkey bacon eggs cheese without cheese  Eh thats honest opinion but hey boss HAHA  Anyhoots ambiance seems similar venetian hotel clouds painted high ceilings little village looking themes presented within your surroundings  waitress wearing some funny looking outfits kinda weird if ask but hey whatever tickles your pickle guess? Overall okay experience  <EOR> This review buffet lunch buffet    I almost feel bad having give them one star but realize no zero stars!   The only good thing place waitress cold beer   food less average selection minimal  But reason star following At 1 00 p m  which 90 minutes into lunch buffet almost discarded trays desserts breakfast buffet labels indicating completely different food items  Patrons walking into food set areas desserts which waiting placed windows long long time  would never condone such behavior but understand why  flag down manager show them   am referring spot tray  whole area desserts      This Paris Hotel Vegas  few years back phenomenal  happened? expect more don't mean more food but more organization just decent presentation food    Needless say very disappointing am embarrassed them  <EOR> Average buffet   Nothing over top    Good service average price   should cut crab legs   much salad bar <EOR> I don't buffets often but am glad came breakfast  absolutely worth it  seating figured think may best breakfast life  salmon asparagus omelet pastries brie potatoes world! fueled day would also highlight strawberries  When bit into felt walking through strawberry field south France  don't know other buffets Vegas but win  <EOR> Loved atmosphere faux Paris  city streets surrounding tables lovely  breakfast stuck around lunch  such breakfast person enjoyed lunch table considerably more breakfast    Some foods such creamed spinach hollandaise eggs benedict lacked seasoning left something desired  buffet didn't blow away but  because kept comparing Bellagio Buffet visited previous day   Breakfast faves table Bagels lox all fixin's Prime Rib Hash the BEST   I keep thinking dish! Braised Cherries  Lunch faves Grilled lamb chops chermoula sauce Grilled asparagus Spicy mussels rice pilaf Roasted tomato bisque <EOR> As far Vegas buffets concerned favorite Brunch   tough call between Bellagio but Easter Sunday Champagne Brunch won out   must give props waiter he did fabulous job keeping flutes full  At most buffets waiters check back very infrequently    Helpful Hints     *Have your drink order ready when approach counter pay your meal   only place does way just prepared question    *Ask if seated little alcoves   noise level lot lower aren't massive amounts people weaving around your table staring your food    *Wait line Crepe   delicious especially dessert stuffed your favorite fruit     *If don't see item buffet listed menu let someone know track down you   meat preparation well   *Don't skip mashed potatoes   They're delicious!       One star gets deducted crab legs   Having spoiled few other buffets fan having crack crab legs  But plenty other items buffet made slight inconvenience  <EOR> My friend came friday lunch waited 20 30 minutes line buffet  think worth wait  great selection food seafood meat desserts etc  But let say crepes thee most delicious crepes ever had  nutella bananas hazelnuts must dessert  Also prime rib cooked very well very tender  must truffle mac cheese  wish found truffle mac cheese first because crepes prime rib 8 mimosas stuffed  mimosas taste champagne but definitely more OJ champagne  If just champagne your bottomless it  Definitely going hit buffet next time vegas  <EOR> A year ago favorite buffet Vegas   Perhaps just tried few better places since visit but felt very disappointed offerings year  no hot crab legs most mussels closed inedible macarons dry stale tasting  couldn't find much wanted eat even cheese selection lacking  sipped some onion soup ate cold baguette left disappointed  Hopefully just off night but won't back find out  <EOR> This still place Sunday Brunch Vegas!!!  come least once twice each trip Vegas!  always toss which best between Rio Aladdin   actually liked Aladdin's brunch but since closed   Anyways back Le Village's crepes!  Yum worth mentioning again again!!!  shrimp crabs clam chowder pastries mashed potatoes all sinlicious!!!!    Yes line long but worth it    it great place people watch others walk others line   service always good us!   Another plus bartender best pina coladas! <EOR> I thought service great    dinner buffet  prime rib delish creme brulee amazing!! Aside thought everything pretty standard  <EOR> So sad buffet used favorite place! really gone downhill past few years  food bland very few selections  dessert area looked tornado through it  Creme brûlée? All last night few hard macaroons some cake  never coming again  <EOR> Came back Friday lunch because Groupon deal food just decent time  no crab legs guessing because weekday most desserts tasted just alright  CREME BRULEE STILL POINT THOUGH  <EOR> I'm rate places often but just rate place 5 stars    I made reservation 2 pm party 7  honestly didn't need seated right away  server super sweet attentive  He continually came clear table empty plates made sure didn't need anything    The food delicious! Everyone family no complaints all pasta meat choices  If complaint prepared salads heavily dressed  But option create your own salad  all reviews state dessert bar AMAZING    Needless say everyone left stuffed super impressed  Being $25 person best value food Vegas  <EOR> This buffet great if budget  I breakfast food ok  Nothing spectacular but gets job done  If breakfast meats place great because nice spread sausage bacon  <EOR> This buffet quite disappointment  food didn't look appetizing still breakfast food 3pm  weren't many options options wasn't great  Would return  <EOR> I don't know why came because remember didn't lot great selection foods  Once again impressed   mean felt bad wasting some food but didn't taste   bland dried  only thing liked desserts lol  Other don't think come back honestly  <EOR> The wait staff great prompt courteous  Portions good sized  french toast eating dry bed but could probably remedied  Everything else delicious   There even opportunity take coffee go! Great place quick breakfast brunch  <EOR> i can't complain much grub free  love superly huge feel you're eating cafeteria  little french village ambiance gorgeous! lines many other buffets LV long but definitely worth it   like many other buffets variety stations asian Mediterranean breakfast italian   favorite definitely made order crepe station! only thing really lacks seafood  but guess if really want seafood you'd just Rio    my overall experience good food delicious  thing made chuckle busboy accidently cleaned table thinking left already even though still jackets hanging chairs   when back table everything cleared off including drinks  didn't upset becuz actually second time happened same trip but different buffet  <EOR> Not good opinion ambiance super nice though  sat far away food lost where seat was  much seafood varieties seem appealing  Everything see probably eaten before  Nothing special  $36 00 person expecting bit more  wouldn't come back buffet good time experience least  <EOR> I dont give 1 stars alot  food 2 star  Service 1  When arrive sunday brunch 33 00 tax  dining alone  ask gratuity before youve even seated  Bad form rude  Then am seated no server  off handidly put back table  Bad form solo diners  Eating alone is  well  lonely  Asked hot tea  may stevia cane sugar please? No  dont it  Food buffet luke warm  git gluten free quiche which microwave tv dinner  Avoid restaurant McDonalds <EOR> We ate breakfast morning  good array items even crepe station lots pastries  Compared other buffet tried breakfast another morning definitely ranked higher  pretty crowded when wait 20 minutes seated  but worth it  dessert section decent too! believe cost breakfast around $15 per person  <EOR> Waited hour line table  Very pricey buffet limited choice food   worth money  <EOR> They downsized buffet too  crab legs huge but no flavor   But always crapes wonderful <EOR> I ate 5 years ago LOVED IT   just came back boy things changed   While individual food stations selection wasn't great   Aside prime rib which moist flavorful rest bland dull   desserts almost insult everything macaroons tarts being bland chewy   can't imagine scenario where would return buffet   addition while some yummy french inspired flakey crusty items last time time nearly gave any french identity all   bad  <EOR> Planet Hollywood better very mediocre buffet   Don't waste cash BUFFET BUFFETS  overpriced many lines  <EOR> My favorite all Buffet Buffets! Food delicious servers ultra friendly <EOR> The environment awesome  dessert bad    french style   food ok       would say bad  <EOR> First stop 24 hour Buffet Buffets tour  friends arrived famished only find long line winding around restaurant  Luckily Vegas where some price anything happen  $10 Cut Line Express Pass worth bringing two hours closer never ending spread cute French delights  Le Village favorite buffets sampled while Vegas  enough themed selection play novelty eating French village dusk  Food okay  crepes fantastic if only because aren't many places besides creperies IHOP where sample 8 different types sweet savory  my favorite Monkey which banana chocolate almond filling  Le Village also offers other regional French specialties including haricots verts bouilliabase  clearly made masses offering  Overall fun experience okay food  <EOR> Had good dinner part Buffet Buffets deal  Salmon moist fresh  best selection cheeses breads crackers  Seafood very appealing due presentation  Neat French themed ambience  <EOR> Still undecided review this  far service far some worst ever received  Haven't even eaten yet   CRAP crap CRAP crap CRAP crap service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyways quite disappointed unprepared were  choose something else which caprese one    The other food items mediocre  lot food cold  desserts bad  macarons but poorly put together barely any taste  don't expect much buffet  guess Paris Le Village decent food buffet  Would come back? Probably not  only wanted buffet visit during Vegas stay chose since hotel  guess buffet isn't really thing since can't money's worth can't eat much would rather put money towards better quality food    If 24hr buffet pass think buffet decent food buffet worth dropping sample some items  But wouldn't suggest paying one time buffet price since much better food same price  <EOR> Loved it!! Beautiful setting wonderful customer service food good!  worth 1 1 2 hour wait    We used Groupon lunch deal well worth it    gotta admit usually try eat somewhat healthy salad somewhere plates but time passed salad room all tasty food deserts! wide variety seafood meats soups pasta veggies bread deserts crepe bar macaroons   guy next ate 6 plates crab legs guess those pretty good thought ok   place lovely well! feels having romantic dinner Paris quiet evening      Oh heed warnings people! reservation Opentable com  warned husband earlier Dec 26th morning should reservation due possible long line    rush morning waited until afternoon reservation     didn't realize need reservation BEFORE noon late  Oh well thought can't bad    When saw line people winding around ropes making line roller coaster looked husband gave told look     trust me!!

Omg  pretty much filled second plate just lol   They brioch french toast which just okay  moist but meh   Sadly desserts  allll blah  didn't any them  Creme brulee kind chunky ish  macarons just looked horrible  White chocolate chip cookies  so dry when bit into them just broke apart into 4 pieces  Disappointing desserts but tasty main meals  <EOR> Soooo disappointing   came 2002 best food ate during whole Vegas trip   time some worst   guess should worried when last Zagat review posted outside  2005   First wait line over hour Champagne Brunch  Brunch?  Usually brunch pretty heavy breakfast food but wasn't much all   did lukewarm nothing couldn't better home   highlight mini waffles which buttery fluffy   The service terrible waiter drink orders wrong didn't give any spoons coffee argued friend when she asked tea water actually hot   It wasn't worth $24 99 all   4 Words Wynn! <EOR> Not bad buffet food  atmosphere restaurant resembles being little Parisian village  Good dessert French macarons fruit tarts but could really improve creme brûlée you're suppose torch sugar top crispy top  <EOR> Big disappointment   seated broken down area buffet section hostess   Ceiling peeling   Quality food expected   Very poor  worth it   No bang your buck  <EOR> Really poor selection food execution   School lunch cafeteria style   Our waitress wonderful workers work hard   Go ceasars!  Run! <EOR> 50 minute wait around 5 pm  90+ min wait people left  All drawbacks French  restaurant long lines high prices none quiet dignity elegance ambience  Typical buffet could anywhere only few exceptions good creme brulee made order crepes   If eat $30 worth seafood creme brulee MIGHT good deal  <EOR> Truly some best prime rib ever had    but catch when back next day prime rib nearly good quality night before????  heck?  The desserts nothing write home don't that   unimpressive cannot even remember any them checked them twice!   The crab legs dinner some best buffet ever!  ice cold sitting hot water many times very flavorful watered down   One favorite dishes creamy pasta truffle oil!  Yummy flavor!  The service both times very good   line but don't know long wait because skip lines It's buffet kinda expensive but isn't Vegas?    My recommendation only once and probably any buffet your visit Vegas because lunch exact same food dinner minus crab legs! <EOR> I wanted oh la la place since its charming inside   Faux French chateau lined walls trees looked birds could fly sit your finger sing lullybye you   However all Cinderella animation sing a long came crashing down when started eating breakfast buffet   Here's bad experience list 1 coffee wasn't strong enough served cream plastic cup   tacky that? 2 getting every egg dish needed ketchup hot sauce   server never looked way never checked able see waves desperation   Unfortunately swiped bottles away another table couple left   Sigh    3 Every egg dish bad   Lox scrambled eggs tasted rotten salmon fishy runny eggs   Scrambled eggs just mush   Eggs Benedict hard heck hollandaise sauce flavorful   Ham cheese omlets bleh again! 4 Every potato dish bad   Hash browns dry   Square hash brown super hard super dry   Sliced potato fries just greasy  5 Corn beef hash wow big ol' greasy spoon  Okay side 6 Bacon guess can't really wrong one 7 Waffle maple syrup warm syrup okay  Good! 8 Sour dough toast strawberry jam  To top things off never able server provide water   stuck drinking washed coffee   higher expectations Paris failed me  <EOR> My digestive tract still mad complete assault gave whilst gorging myself prime rib  stayed hours literally just could digest little then keep eating    Our server super nice kept drinks full  She may judged thought all hedonistic pigs but she didn't let on  She merciful   I want sleep bed made prime rib  <EOR> 9 10 food but people next made experience bad  First some people complaining food horrible soggy they've buffets cost 50 dollars doesn't compare well course bish buffet 30 dollars gonna best buffet  Also she prob rich family poor thot food good  Then girls guy nudes phones screen bright saw EWW  Anyways good food bad people <EOR> Super nice place several options  cant wring picking place  Vegan steak salads fish name it    <EOR> Pros Great prime rib Unlimited Mimosas included  Cons **Waited 1hr 20 minutes line in **Server Joyce completely inattentive didn't stop SINGLE TIME own check offer refills  **breakfast items cold **crab legs tasted fishey no drawn butter available **stopped serving crab legs halfway through buffet hours **bathrooms tidy <EOR> Crepes crepes crepes all day long crepes crepes crepes while sing song  Seriously crepes Le Village Buffet die for! always wait crepes but worth it  crepes made right front exactly your liking  always 1 sweet crepe 1 savory crepe  savory ham cheese sweet Nutella hazelnuts  only reason can't give place 5 stars because never really eat anything else buffet  crepes usually fill plate variety things pick but point full don't taste anything else LOL  <EOR> This place good reviews again expecting good breakfast   10 20am waited line 25minutes in   food ok   Maybe because tired couldn't eat all much   don't really remember any food standing out    Their atmosphere good service pretty good well   didn't charge anything extra 3 year old which plus     How good buffet?  thought buffet Planet Hollywood next door actually better surprisingly    If think Le Village Buffet best haven't tried Wynn's Buffet   <EOR> Service point  food appears pretty consistent third time having lunch here  lunch dinner menu seem very similar   favorite part desserts  absolutely love fruit tarts often find myself grabbing bunch peace mind lol  <EOR> Good quality food good mixture   Crepe bar nice some solid mediteranean selections   lamb excellent prime rib go   better buffets town  <EOR> First thing before visiting le village  buy groupon $44 two dinner bottle wine Second thing must before coming book your table Opentable  If reservation through them through VIP section instead standing line and line long! Overall buffet pretty good especially groupon price  Everything seemed bit salty but because none eaten yet all inhaled everything  only thing really stood deserts  Both creme brulee flan amazing! None waited crepes but also looked really good   I probably won't coming back if pay full price but if still snag groupon definitely go! <EOR> Yep everyone else saying really good  video appetizer plate which essentially means skipped all heavy meats first round preparation second third plates which try upload YouTube  If you're really interested then just search Le Village Buffet should come time read    Don't wait line crab legs  Don't beef medallions  seafood highly mediocre but lamb great  grilled veggies fantastic  some carrots cilantro  brie well brie elicious  OH sugar free raspberry tarts amazing too   Anyway 5 stars variety value 3 stars quality frankly some plates just warm enough much sauce unlike good French food 4 stars service we also some problems getting drinks    If you're looking buffet  cut above MISS THIS  spread mind bogglingly stomach growlingly amazing  <EOR> The food good most items sitting far long  Any seafood overcooked mushy  Veggies also overcooked under seasoned  only reason even 1 star desserts crepe station  would take $31 invest nice la carte meal  Only because parents real hungry stayed Paris convenience really  mostly just sad here  <EOR> The Buffet buffet all  didn't tasty foods different variety well  dishes filled properly just simplest kind food  didn't even any soups dinner Salads Bar desserts very very simple well  even stayed line hour enter charged 40$ each which worth all  I never buffer again  <EOR> We breakfast reading reviews saying best breakfast buffet options  just okay opinion  liked theme but set very congested hard move around tables  food also hard reach lot areas because set far back under low glass cover   As far actual food typical buffet food  Edible but nothing special  two favorite things where french toast made good thick bread smoked trout   Overall lot decent breakfast options but would prefer normal sit down restaurant  large number options doesn't offset mediocre food  <EOR> We group lunch  However hungry   You stay line order those average dessert crepes  Everything else pretty mediocre too   There kind lot desserts but nothing would want try   The interior buffer whole hotel Paris pretty nice  But advantage doesn't overweight mediocre food   well    summarize whole experience WORTH DINING THERE!  There many better ones! just better but really good ones  <EOR> I've eaten few times while Vegas am NEVER disappointed   BEST buffet Vegas   finished meal #2 crepe dessert which heavenly! <EOR> This great buffet breakfast brunch  best part hands down crepe station  Savory sweet something everyone  Asides all traditional breakfast foods eggs eggs Benedict pancakes waffles potatoes meats etc     This included buffet pass if you're going route    Also always big line early    The atmosphere really quaint you're village France  lighting dimmed  very comfortable <EOR> muy delicioso y no quiero comer nada mas! don't know why but when really full spanish becomes first language although no latin blood whatsoever must past life !   i've paris' buffet three times now third time BEST! never forget sugar free raspberry chocolate mousse forced ignore pain anguish but rather keep going 'til last forbidden bite   and then grab another one    seven took sweet time made br rounds let loose few buttons smuggled few chewy cookies even friend eskeleto 3 4 plates deeply pleased veal i don't veal but see skinny famished ass enjoy much made smile big     we definitely money's worth   $25 painfully never ending tummy pleasing feast  marathon diet starts NOW okay weekend come mario's ! <EOR> We arrived 8pm weekday during Spring Break   seated 9pm   food variety limited quality just average   Desserts big disappointment!  grabbed last three macarons no more came out!   Other deserts Vegas standard   paid $30 99 per person kids same price    price expected little bit more this! <EOR> This bad buffet all   isn't Bellagio MGM but above average cuisine pay   standard offerings Asian Italian Mediterranean Mexican seafood carving station   prime rib good   juicy pink   Thank God no hot dogs hamburgers!  bottle wine available dinner plus   return?  Sure   I'd come back again  <EOR> How stuff yourself night huge drinking binge without upsetting your stomach crappy foods?   I say here  food decent  selection superb  peak hours you'll area yourself well mostly but can't guarantee it    Don't everstuff yourself  Save room desserts  good worry your diet extra poundage later  Walk off tea  <EOR> My new favorite LV buffet! What's buffets having bathrooms premises? mean practicality standpoint keep em full but isn't health code violation somewhere there? don't it   Dessert bar looked amazing but didn't try anything because a 1pm am orca b nothing glutard friendly aside some ice creams other dairy esque things brave enough try before drive back LA   Better most  If you've time some options choose one  think ate 12 whole sweet potatoes FTW  <EOR> If wasn't Le Crepe Nutella bananas hazelnuts place would warrant 1 star rating     Over many years having many people talk Vegas buffets being best try least once while there  many expectations but maybe  problem here    First off seated almost block away actual food stations  place really work food  food sectioned off into several stations based courses appetizers main dessert   always seafood meats    you figured your money's worth way  Seriously wants full cheap salads?  I little bit everything  dabbler  meats salty dry  seafood just okay  didn't even touch salads  But coffee good  Overall felt wasn't much love put into food  all quantity versus quality while I'd much prefer latter  something buffets people pile everything even food awful  am guilty but ended eating 80% plate   As evening turning expected decided try crepe station  Per recommendation friend nutella bananas hazelnuts  say dish made everything else before there  freshly made infront anyone mess up?   Now all glitz glamour gone     it would take lot come back place again  <EOR> Earns 4 star recent improvements better attention however come expecting longest lines sometimes 90 minutes in   They great selection seafood desserts Krepes cheese deli  Also some great French styled cuisine  Service solid 4 star design also 4 stars   Located right between Ballys Paris Las Vegas center lot traffic  Come your Buffet Buffets pass  <EOR> I Very disappointed experience  The cheese bar 4 cheeses none them European  I did expect muenster cheddar smoked mozzarella pepper jack French theme buffet  The place moderately full hour wait line  The service horrible  When asked waitress did red wine if talking another language  French theme she should able answer knowledgeable  Avoid if can 4 lunch 135 00 <EOR> In terms buffets Vegas Le Village absolute favorites! feel gets overlooked often time forgotten but ugh  fine  More food me!  I eat places well lit especially buffet settings know exactly what's food did somebody's grubby hand pick placed back down cupcake?! but never problem here  Everything's really delicious cooked well every single time dinner only    It's reasonably priced variety choices available  think might even groupon floating around place  <EOR> This review breakfast buffet only   We waited 15 20 mins breakfast arriving around 8 30   didn't know vacationers Vegas woke early!    The selection good breakfast   Omlettes cereal fresh fruits baked goods ham bacon other breakfast staples personal favorite crepes   orange juice delicious best ever had     The ambience charming   French outdoor theme ceilings painted sky clouds   enjoyed it   I probably return next visit Vegas  <EOR> We just returned lunch Le Village Buffet say am very disappointed This favorite buffet Las Vegas last few years we live Las Vegas   always look forward eating there  supposedly seated preferred Platinum Club table  table around corner Provence section right where all buffet staff comes kitchen huge carts wheels clattering along cobblestone floors making horrendous noises throughout meal  nothing relaxing meal! food did feel par us  always loved individual servings beef bourguignon things but none those  prime rib looked positively raw  sushi boring only two kinds   no chicken dishes saw  salads bland  always intrigued crepe station but line always long slow never taken time one  bragged buffet many people  it really bit embarrassing  still love creme brulee macaroon cookies dessert but sure they're worth going just that  cashier server very nice  Le Village Buffet gone great pretty average very short period time  Very disappointing! <EOR> I honestly think best value buffet strip  Groupon but would pay full price heart next time next time! Unbelievable breads creative dishes apples pork belly SO GOOD pasta could eat every meal just love  All things would give 4 stars but then CREPE! Omg apple crepe literally die for  Find room it  Highly recommend eaten all major buffets strip  <EOR> Came breakfast made sure enough food paid for  large arrangement foods  fruit pancakes hashbrowns definition oatmeal turkey bacon sausage   Let start off negative finish good   Pancakes favorite food no matter eat lunch dinner anytime between  pancakes small no complaints easier them fit mouth  only problem them kinda taste school cafeteria pancakes least first 4 did but other 2 didn't really taste bad  better pancakes home  Their hashbrowns no flavor ever  Where seasonings at? potatoe triangle kinda hard  The waffle wasn't amazing nor expecting taste great based rating  just regular ol waffles me  Don't started oatmeal  usually don't put brown sugar oatmeal but time because let tell oatmeal no flavor whatsoever  could because all natural but even Trader Joe's Steel Cut oats more flavor oatmeal  The turkey bacon turkey bacon spiked blood pressure feel it  soft much salt although some people may turkey bacon soft but more crisp crunch regular bacon out  eat cause don't just waste food that   Now let's end good   Turkey sausage best things had  Didn't taste any different ones home  fruit give ever picks fruit cause flavorful sweet juicy pieces pineapple cantaloupe honeydew  occasionally those non good pieces but those sweet good  can't even pick ripe honeydew fruit if life depended it   only reason gave 4 stars  <EOR> On Sunday April 10th wife attempted dinner buffet 3PM  being seated browsed through offerings surprise tags which identify food items all wrong tags reflected all items associated breakfast items  food much better misguided tags  After while wife overheard few attendants saying much afternoon crew did show work thus mess ups  service OK but attendant apparently called away perform other duties leaving attendant took care well other customer needs  The only reason gave 1 start rating because crab legs bad although number them still frozen  Not very good dinning experience    <EOR> This your typical breakfast buffet addition crepes yum yum!  Unfortunately good used be  found several things buffet cold corned beef hash now ground corned beef where past pieces turkey bacon sitting water very little fresh fruit available     When mentioned things manager he did seem care   He answer everything the turkey bacon just inferior product can't any money if put better more fruit berries    very shocking   All could OK if would better service   asked would drink when paid on way in drinks delivered while getting food   ordered hot tea cream given two Earl Grey teabags   wanted plain black tea i e  English Breakfast tried find waiter teabags changed but he nowhere found   half done first plate food before he ever came back   waved down told would he left table without asking anyone else if needed anything did   He returned teabags person asked water he turned leave again without asking if anything else   grabbed before he left but sure why he around saw helping person table time instead helping whole table   They definitely need some training both servers management!! <EOR> Soooo yummy! Everything hit plate top notch! icing top friendly quick service! If breakfast person your list  <EOR> This used top two three buffets Vegas  While still good starting feel effects downsizing number options serves can't quite put same tier buffets Caesar's Bellagio Wynn   What serve usually pretty good  remember did tri tip night absolutely excellent prime rib never disappoints  also points very good dessert section   If Buffet Buffets deal which I'd advise if eat more buffet 24 hours pays itself just neighborhood pretty solid lunch dinner option haven't eaten breakfast can't comment that   Unfortunately used GREAT isn't anymore  <EOR> This buffet general good but nothing great buffet M Hotel better  main deal come eat if want AYCE crepes savory sweet desserts custards creme brulee macaroons etc    The ambient nice decoration feel sitting outside french town    very nice good conversation friends no hurry keep eating    ha ha ha The food good    meats prime rib roast beef very tasty  Alsace station sausages sauerkraut  two stations well take care    Asian Italian food fresh actually some trays empty more 15 minutes I know some would say    comes eat Le Village? but if should treated same standards other stations    I brunch because included champagne mimosas    really plus   The service good friendly   everything clean come often enough take empty plates fill your drinks  restaurant look cleaned too   This third time here    keep coming satisfy cravings crepes until cannot stand up    ha ha ha <EOR> The best part buffet crepe station  everything else just meh  Five stars sweet  menu  banana crepe nutella toasted hazelnuts  Bomb! <EOR> A very reliable buffet wide variety tasty fare     Unique freshly made crepes station choose menu sweet savory options delicious <EOR> The line Sunday brunch long!    Over all food A ok   Selection wise I don't think good other newer hotels   Their dessert selection quite good   must try Macaroons just very good! <EOR> I purchased lunch groupon buffet husband tried over weekend  groupon included bottle wine 2 lunch buffets $35 quite deal    The buffet itself okay most stuff yummy spread good  Some food cold though not supposed be turned off little bit  Prime rib okay more fat meat but nice flavor  made order crepe station awesome  Lots seafood even though lunch buffet  HUGE dessert selection   Our service fantastic waitress always around drink refills which big deal kind dehydrated night before ! would return again food way better some other buffets Vegas  <EOR> I've eaten several times over past few years still fan! food isn't gorumet but dependable  probalby give more stars most because we 1 paid breakfast price around 10 45 instead double price lunch just 15 minutes later! 2 skip line  husband diamond card which allowed use express line free  Well  as he points out   it's really free since use those loyalty cards keep bleeding money through gambling    I enjoyed grilled vegetables especially grilled mushrooms! mini quiche  king crab legs so so salty mushy    the shrimp better   My favorite however desserts! enjoyed creme brulee caramel flan passionfruit cake layer seemed passionfruit sorbet ? flourless chocolate cake   ok   i should embarassed!!!

Bottom line late morning before lunch save money friends someone Platinum Diamond card save time  <EOR> I really question all positive reviews here  talking same place? came lunch few days ago awful  You're way better off spending few more bucks Bellagio buffet   There something very depressing lighting faux village  perma dusk but ugly  limited food options environment  Among offenses place promotes its crepe bar but shouldn't  Le Village Buffet managed impossible ruined Nutella  slather way much Nutella crepes  no fresh fruit options available  friend took banana another part buffet cut asked them put banana Nutella crepe  didn't understand instead put banana inside Nutella outside  only real seafood option tiny shrimp looked came freezer bag  also shell shrimp yourself  Things broccoli tortellini dry undercooked  Even pears  something requires no cooking just putting people take  unripe inedible  <EOR> We Sunday tail end brunch buffet  line little bit before 2pm finally hour finally seated roam food stations    None food stood particularly amazing but I'd say highlights probably brie bacon macaroni prime rib  breakfast mood also tried eggs benedict scrambled eggs bacon sausage hash browns crepe  bacon sausage good but scrambled eggs way watery very odd consistency  eggs benedict pretty good but seemed sitting while    However bit disappointed when sitting table 15 20 minutes server told completely run champagne  run champagne champagne brunch? made absolutely no sense me  offered wine while but really looking forward champagne    boo  would nice if comp'ed something least    If decide come I'd come early don't run champagne you  If you're going multiple buffets while you're Vegas i'd probably first because compared other buffets Vegas Mandalay Bay Bellagio quality food just wasn't there  <EOR> it best caesars palace rio  caesars didn't much variety but environment nice  rio better variety but environment denny's   here quite variety well beautiful environment  decorated streets paris similar outside building     THE CREPES CREME BRULEE DEFINITELY MUST TRY!!!!   desserts definitely better rio's caesars   paris buffet salad bar fresh made omelettes   also more fresh fruits dessert variety compared other 2 buffets   i would definitely again! <EOR> I'm sorry those love Le Village Buffet but going lower rating   breakfast couple times before long while back decent back then   Unfortunately breakfast time around good compared last time there   I little unlucky eggs benedict since sitting long making eggs runny   gluten free version tough almost hockey puck  http bit ly 2leEUzm    I made sure try crepe station which always talked about   Truffle Mushroom crepe only saving grace me   thought tasted pretty good  http bit ly 2lfcuW2    Overall hard give Le Village Buffet higher rating experience   Especially when compared breakfast experiences higher end buffets Strip Wicked Spoon Bacchanal   Fortunately mom used comp dollars which softened blow but think those comp dollars could've put better use another restaurant serves better quality food  <EOR> I've never super engaged Las Vegas buffet wars  generally light eater concept paying premium opportunity stuff food face pound praise All American testament culinary excess anything aspire yet can't separate Vegas experience  Fortunately Le Village Buffet honest cut above perhaps only buffet Vegas didn't taste buffet heat lamps rubbery food pink slime such  Choices abundant food fresh really doesn't sit since everyone attacking all stations all times  pain ass getting while lot recent reviews declining quality give pause likely return next time LV check myself  Champagne all down better  <EOR> Pretty terrible service good atmosphere okay food    pretty much sums up!

Our waitress great  She pretty swamped but always made sure if she walking asked another mimosa request acknowledged  She even apologized being swamped multiple times even though didn't feel neglected all   This buffet must visit especially if 24 hour pass! <EOR> I frequently las vegas stay different hotels however last trip decided stay Paris Hotel casino Well when eat Paris buffet met long lines diners waiting It took nearly hour just seated Although service good very disappointed food It seems  high quality standards buffet use lost somewhere since place opened  <EOR> I hoping food going fantastic but extremely disappointed  Especially since wait 45mins  atmosphere itself okay  could definitely use some updating  choices options food weren't greatest  Usually favorite part varieties buffets desert but huge let down  signs all labeled incorrectly  only food worthwhile pretzel rolls if tells anything  Las Vegas every year SEMA next time won't going buffet nor recommend anyone  many awesome restaurants buffets erase off bucket list  Try Wynn pricey but beyond worth it  <EOR> Despite meals being comp'ed b c Diamond membership still crappy experience   We told Alaska King crab legs substituted regular ones called them Alaska King  wtf? think don't know difference? Service mediocre drinks filled despite asking several times  only thing preventing giving one star crepes bar gigantic crepe customized your liking  Definitely Americanized French food but hey Vegas where everyone pigs out  <EOR> I usually try avoid buffets whenever possible but wound Sunday brunch bottomless mimosas  Most food bad but great considering price  letdown desserts I expect more French place   <EOR> My boyfriend kill rating buffet 3 stars 4 5!

My classmates came breakfast originally but ended stayin lunch portion well! Ooops   darn those tourists! Are though if live henderson?! Anyway   the crepes good but just felt ripped off because selection breakfast wasn't vast expected! Which reason why decided stay lunch!  Lunch gave bit more selection   but would come back?? dunno   i think it'd safer just crepe across way eat outside! <EOR> Beautiful setting crepes only selling point buffet  rest food mediocre best servers friendliest Las Vegas act inconvenience them whenever ask anything  Maybe trying authentically French <EOR> I lunch using buffet buffets pass   wait enter long hoping food worth wait   Unfortunately wasn't   People seem raving crepes but found them great   better   service drinks slow   overall quality food mediocre best   only good thing saumon fume     quality selection French food anything special   buffet Wynn better French selection  <EOR> Was really quandary which breakfast buffet hit up   Read reviews am pleased chose Le Village     And more hoped for   selections meats potatoes excellent!  The fresh crepes looked sinfully delicious just try one   Unfortunately tasted Cool Whip hoped real whipped cream   Also didn't manage find real butter croissant but could eyes   Margarine preserves everywhere except no butter 10AM lunch changeover   course just no room eat any but take tour lunch fare   definitely back!  Oh   if decide take time Total Rewards card first   did pay extra 3 00 per person    18 99  <EOR> Ok lets real    food slightly better average but definitely service puts over top  ESPECIALLY MARY waitress  She godsend  only paris brunch where endless mimosas without fail waitresses drunk  Always good time here  <EOR> Steak decent all you can drink champagne favorite! However might complain capacity your stomach only finite    Long queue holidays Avoid that! <EOR> for price quality vegas strip without spending your life savings good nothing spectacular but experience vegas   the food isnt great way over priced!  so least breakfast brunch buffet lots options regional french foods  least many options full  arrived saturday 9 did wait long   the waitress did bring drinks very friendly <EOR> We ate recent stay Paris hotel pretty decent  kind nice tables spread into different patios buildings reflect little Parisian village   The food average but disappointing  only two things sad 1st serving eggs Benedict egg cooked all way through due heat lamp but since buffet just another fine   The other thing bugged Corned Beef Hash made simply using shredded Hash Browns ingredient  Just seemed lazy move me  next day Corned Beef Hash next door Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis perfectly prepared cooked poached eggs top! recommend going next door The Croissants soft inside yet crunchy outside good! <EOR> I love love love buffet! standard Las Vegas buffet delightful place serves fare 5 provinces France    The atmosphere feel walked onto many courtyard cafes France smells delightful   many stations food being prepared fresh   wide varieties french cheeses pates chops crepes made order wonderful desserts great fresh seafood fondues many other dishes satisfy any taste  <EOR> Breakfast pretty good  Line long but moved quickly  Service wasn't great probably because crowded  bit expensive but your money's worth if eat lot <EOR> Buffets    again  think mom would love buffets Las Vegas especially if buy Total Rewards deal pay $57 24 hour buffet eating spree But buffets hangover blend very well  bit miserable buffet hopping day time  sucks many mom n pop pho shops dim sum restaurants located strip  taken over bigger businesses owned hotels otherwise would great business  started off Le Village noon line bit long 3 star buffet  would expect Wynn Bellagio would ridiculous but  nevertheless quick especially if large parties  service gratuity charge if your party exceeds 7  7 made cut! huzzah!

Yay being sneaky! king crab legs little salty which = 1 star  But crepes all sorts other dishes  atmosphere also really cute  <EOR> Came Friday morning bf weren't impressed  buffet pretty good selection breakfast but quality subpar  lot things seemed old such smoked salmon did look fresh all   They served variety sausages  some good some bad  liked Andouille sausage  think place known its crepe station but food ate wasn't mood wait line crepe  saw omelette station too   There line when around 9am but moved fairly fast  <EOR> I purchased $45 50 Buffet Buffet passes  giving access 7 different casino buffets 24 hour period  Some choices seemed not so good but remembered buffet being halfway decent when tried years years ago    The line much shorter first trip  remember 8 9 years ago line door almost into casino  time maybe 15 25 people ahead us  little slow seating but nothing outrageous    The food? Pretty good  I'd say quality fairly good but selection bit lower favorite Bellagio but still presented pretty impressive spread  Then again just need few staples done well few flourishes pretty happy  fairly gluttonous all you can eat buffet set ups able eat fill  think everything tried only thing didn't really enjoy    TL DR cheaper buffets strip line wasn't ridiculous part package deal  Fairly good food if just want few staple items shovel into your face  <EOR> I hate write review really do  Vegas local former Harrah's Diamond card holder frequented buffet Paris last 10 years  hadn't recently decided reservation Open Table could bypass line  When showed 5 30 pm Sunday night ZERO other people line should've known right then something amiss buffet  welcome explanation least apology someone charge abysmal buffet   This buffet used favorites but wow downright depressing! First all many empty tables inside a sign bad restaurant sure   food stations looked old tired many repeats bars many trays mussels rice green beans need ? lot old favorites taken off menu favor cheaper fare mashed potatoes instead sauteed scallops example   seafood section horrible! Paris used huge peeled shrimp cocktail but now bowl peel yourself small shrimp carelessly slapped big bowl  depressing steep decline quality taken place   It's almost if casino simply given buffet  None food labeled if labeled mislabeled  employees acted disinterested everything  Many food trays empty stayed way duration 2 hour visit  just sad  off time prime dinner time WEEKEND night!  The main reason 1 star review lack cleanliness  eat truck stops street food carts dives all time doesn't usually bother but buffet DISGUSTING! Spills everywhere drips all over sticky serving untensils glass crusted crud  NASTY  ice cream machine several used cones melting ice cream running all over  Some stations no plates  crab legs shameful  picked over NOBODY wanted eat them  gross  photos video prove gross place see yourself    Quick somebody call health inspector!  The food beverage department Paris needs some serious help  Harrah's listening? am upset paid outrageous $30 per person this  dump  deal less fresh food but cleanliness place embarrassing  Shame Harrah's! <EOR> Not place would back least brunch which $18 per person Friday  arrived 10 10 minute wait  I liked selection variety fruits eggs sausages bacon omeletes bagels pastries potatoes biscuits smoked salmon yogurt ice cream chocolate covered cones w almond sprinkles etc   handmade crepe good even though fruit inside kept falling out  pastries didn't look very appetizing ones did taste very good  Nice staff  juice coffee kept coming  Plates cleared quickly  Cute decor  Great atmosphere  Feels evening  Food nothing special compared other places strip though  <EOR> I've officially sworn off buffets leaning direction begin but experience Le Village Buffet sealed deal   The buffets Vegas heading same direction over past five years more expensive while less quality  seen happen Rio Wynn now Paris  lived Vegas three years worked supervisor largest casinos frequent visitor buffets say isn't simply speculation what's gone down   Le Buffet when opened finest Vegas fantastic assortment food stations incredible service desserts die for  When returned buffet January disappointed felt sick all night we'd payed $70 two eat here   The buffet caters primarily toward seafood now which great if you're seafood lover am not  very few options appealing non seafood fans  generous mountain shrimp mine crab legs shellfish  However whenever crab legs put unless you're camping you're going completely raped pushy folks before blast through pile diligently picking clean good legs leaving spoils everyone else  frustrating annoying hell   The food selections did okay but definitely worth $30 per person  dessert station disaster names desserts did match out  Obviously staff doesn't care  try your luck situation patrons left guess treat actually getting   At station couldn't separate two bowls passed them toward staff member other side counter telling stuck  She looked idiot slammed bowls granite counter which made them separate  She gave started putting other BACK INTO CLEAN BOWLS PILE I'd explained gave them because hands all over them  woman standing next spoke right asked staffer she thinking I'd JUST told touching bowls! staff member frowned other customer removed bowl stack  Totally disgusting wonder else ends clean plates stacks there   Table clearing slow finding someone refill soda joke  Total contrast when buffet new seemed several bussers each table vultures minute cleaned your plate put empty glass table  case anymore sadly added frustration   Standing line another station final straw broke camel's back woman stood front eating food off plate SUCKING fingers  Then guessed she right using hand use tongs spoons getting more food buffet   And really  core problem ANY buffet  People disgusting  piggish pushy dirty  somewhat control level dining experience but never completely control other customers  Case point Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan considered best buffet Vegas now many  ate experience okay except two tables close loud drunk douchebag guests being loud disrupted everyone's experience   So next time consider shelling better part $100 Vegas buffet remember you're paying crowds strangers pawing same spoons tongs breathing coughing over same food stations wait staff making just over minimum wage honestly won't give rat's ass if ever return not  Vegas people come pretty much no matter what   For foreseeable future am DONE buffets  <EOR> Great food amazing ambiance! There's nothing quite compares eating delicious French food under painted blue sky surrounded French shops   best part many options which choose feel encouraged sample just everything  and please do! Everything excellent surprisingly so  service could've used bit work primary job refill drink glasses  Additionally steer clear crab legs  enough sodium them your eyes water  <EOR> might worst thing ever put mouth  Scott Conant Chopped   I'm disappointed place   Bad food bad service high prices   worse?  I figured all good things heard brunch if chose items carefully could turn 3 5 star rated place into 4 star experience  wrong   When over done prime rib dry turkey save place speaks bad everything else was   matters worse very poor rude service cashier  felt stereotypical Chinese restaurant killing Paris escapism  Chinese!  $25 13 year old daughter ate half crepe?    Here's rundown foods sampled prime rib unevenly cooked but mostly grey over done  turkey bone dry gravy solidified chunky didn't use it  mussels clams flavorless pastas bland dry room temp fruits sweet watery flavorless bread stale pate big clunky pieces no finesse cheeses ditto orange juice tang  I honestly can't understand why anyone would place   excited Vegas overlook quality?  First time buffet?  Because crepe station?  place Hometown Buffet feel special   I REALLY hate wasting food would always effort finish something even if don't care it   But sadly day wasted quite bit food   I feel violated   My tip     somewhere Texas De Brazil Fogo De Chao lunch if want high quality buffet   You'll spend less dinner prices if think Village Buffet good you'll think you're heaven  <EOR> I know work buffets  Take thing each then back like   problem  liked everything  cheese spinich ravioli spicy very big  beef tenderloin world  shrimp little small compaired Wynn  But paid half food knocking door  Very fast clean up  little slow refilling empty trays  <EOR> Years ago buffet enjoyed quite immensely first Vegas buffets  Last week came back former favorite see become it  little bit disappointing   I tried hit little bit all appetizing items  prime rib pretty solid  beef bourguignon pork belly bouillabaisse probably standouts whole thing  Well except desserts  some really nice options creme brulee cheesecake  dessert crepe #2 believe berries also good if little big   The big problem crab legs mostly sucked such small serving area compared huge platter used have  gives? Everybody knows Vegas buffet crab legs  Also lamb pretty dry just wasn't much variety some bigger buffets   Luckily able use Groupon trip enjoyed couple glasses Blue Moon  also red table wine something else didn't sound appealing memory banks  bad if you're looking little buzzed your meal  But if you're just gonna eat then hit Bacchanal which still love despite news ever increasing prices  <EOR> This favorite buffets Las Vegas!  Everything worth taste!  prime rib amazing creamed spinach! crepe station something miss   cheese bread selection world    table attendants top cleared used plates quickly drinks always full  <EOR> Lot food but low quality    tables clean cleared    food prep areas looked unclean   crepe cook used spatula scrape dried dough proceeded use turn crepe   Disgusting <EOR> The hospitality point  food better ones tried  dinner very delish  breakfast good well  breakfast crepes best  country gravy little salty  Other very good  <EOR> I usually gorge myself food buffets let inner fatty come out   I looking forward buffet however selection limited compared other buffets Vegas   The food itself pretty tasty very French based  sure much seafood fits into French cuisine but sad see seafood section limited   Definitely favorite buffet Vegas That would international buffet Rio but $24 99 filled some better average buffet food content time there  Content but ecstatic   Probably won't come back buffet since theres still many other buffets need try! <EOR> When Paris casino first opened buffet thought everything superb  But over years quality place downgraded  back December disappointed didn't much variety food remembered  grilled chicken dry wish more vegetable dishes   However frozen yogurt probably best  back seconds  <EOR> tip best buffet buffet buffets need add additional money in   the thick steak sauce mushrooms very good   crepe station handful sweet savory crepes choose from   potato leek soup shared other buffets spice market  refined items smoked salmon   grilled foods very rough  cocktail shrimp small unpeeled  <EOR> Definitely most fantastic buffet Vegas but did trick Sunday afternoon some buddies Groupon  $45 2 eat all drink adult beverages  great thing   but buffet itself left alot desired    The layout space clumsy awkward shoved into back corners place   actually table WALKWAY back room seated in  comfortable  top all no selection 'Asian Style' food   no sweet sour no tempura anything   really alot selection overall    The main thing saved dining experience crepe counter  Both savory sweet crepes   great addition pretty weak selection  say give try reason if deal  Happy Eating! <EOR> What great Buffet! best time would brunch  Bouillabaise which really French but Cajun but would differentiate town tacky Las Vegas starts course followed some custom made crepes 1 savory 1 sweet some sausage clams  Finish off easily best Creme Brullee ever had  Four stars! <EOR> Beautiful place! daughters love crepe stand! love cheese part! recommend place whom loves desserts <EOR> I'm fan buffets all but decided join friends Paris' buffet  Heard good brunch but lunch Friday  Before noon line fairly long but pretty quickly  If Total Rewards card $1 off which equals $20 person    We seated back drink orders taken  Sodas juices coffee unlimited  buffet area does look very Disneyland esque others mentioned  Selections varied salads meats French inspired food course crepe station    Was really dissapointed wasn't vast array cheeses breads expected although towards end stay did put some cheeses but very typical kinds  Most food flavorful choices limited  favorite ham cheese quiche but comparable frozen ones find Costco  Saved room crepes 4 sweet choices 4 savory  line usually long waited 20 minutes  Luckily choose 2 really quick    I seemed gotten crepe maker didn't really care could see burning crepes paying attention  sweet crepe candied walnuts savory spinach mushrooms etc  Can't remember all ingredients he must've forgotten instead bechamel he poured powdered sugar all over top all over again  Both memorable all    Overall all agreed place whatevers wouldn't return  <EOR> We give some vouchers meals decided try buffet Parisian touch  first thing noticed macarons crêpe station giant pile snow crab legs! rest food decent  leg lamb very good!

Eggs benedict although little hard good! sweet palenta favorites well smoked salmon  crepe bar omlette bar  ambiance nice dimly lit made romantic but casual vibe breakfast boyfriend  wait 9 30 am long but quite bit tables available  Maybe short staffed  server nice  She gave to go cups apple juice  wasn't impressed dessert bar  bathroom only stall  enough size restaurant if ask me  But end breakfast time started putting lunch food right before 11am  enjoy food both times  <EOR> I'm huge fan buffets mostly because can't eat money's worth but pretty impressed variety Le Village  staying Paris headed last meal before hitting road home   line SUPER long but fast table within 30 min despite lady front saying going least hour     Food divided based relative provinces France cute! Some stuff delicious some stuff eh some took bite it     crepes sucked though wtf? saw fatty ass line fresh crepes thought THOSE MUST GOOD! Took bite blech worst crepes had   Come French joint you're supposed own French food  Crepes French burritos Mexicans  dammit  crepe itself kind dry filling just fruit no mascarpone no whipped cream just some canned fruit  sad   However tons seafood options prime rib wasn't bad either  Desserts awesome! fruit tarts delicious macaroons some best had   Overall pretty cute but really can't handle buffets   liked more Bellagio buffet Rio primarily because variety assortment dishes don't typically find buffets   However French food ridiculously heavy   wanted cry hour because stuffed   Also unbutton pants which SUPER awk since car afterward boyfriend's guy friends  w00t  <EOR> I've twice both times dissappointed  $22pp extremely high small breakfast selection  think $15 most should charge quality  thinking 24hr deal but jacked $79 weekend  No thanks! entire family left very unsatisfied  positive note crepe berry mix very good    Check Studio B M  Almost half price twice quality  <EOR> Went breakfast reading reviews Frommers disappointed  Different other buffets things order  example able  custom order omelet crepe  Price good variety quality  Loved creme brulee pate potatoes artichoke olives crepe!

The food excellent! good amount variety plenty standout items such crepe Eggs Benedict smoked salmon macaroons flan  also made omelets but full try it  end meal all really full enjoyed it   This buffet definitely revisit when Vegas again!   My ranking buffets 1  Le Village Buffet Paris 2  Carnival World Buffet Rio 3  Spice Market Buffet Planet Hollywood 4  Flavors Buffet Harrah's Didn't try Paradise Garden Buffet Flamingo because full! <EOR> A very bad buffet   old outdated  Everything kept warm heat lamps  crab legs dinner probably made few days ago    Just terrible  Le Village isn't worth penny over $10   Trust somewhere else  Bacchanal Caesars costs way more but way better  <EOR> This Buffet very disappointing fruit tastes old food sits long periods occasionally come stirred look  hasn't crusted over heat lamps LOL Nothing inspiring nothing fresh all tasteless definitely skip buffet breakfast  <EOR> Buffets never cup tea  think price buffet way steep average food  buffet variety foods  salad bar variety meats some vegetables crepes  don't many vegan vegetarian options  would nice if some healthier fresher alternatives   I would say best part place would crepes  made fresh chef  many different options  really hard chose just one   What would buffet better would having fresher options having more options  Perhaps having more French food would cool  don't dislike eating just isn't first choice  <EOR> I thought 33 50 price without member card bit much but food surprisingly good!  I enjoyed pretty much all things put plate  liked all pastas different potatoes cream spinach grilled lamb bunch more! Desserts good too! liked creme brule some other cakes  Overall happy all food thought buffet food great! walked happy full I'd again but I'd member card $3 bucks off P <EOR> This favorite buffet Vegas far   Medium price I think higher end food   your standard crabs legs prime rib   but also many tasty dishes   crepes lamb seafoods     desserts   awesome! <EOR> This probably favorite buffet Vegas  While haven't them all dined number them takes fiance   We $5 off each dinners courtesy coupon IP player's club fun book  Even if paid full price $24 99 each would worth it   The ambiance fun staff dressed feeling really dining cute little place France  foods delicious grouped according different regions France  some pretty standard stuff but also various cheese made to order crepes duck dumplings special desserts just other foods oozing deliciousness  macaroons absolutely fabulous!  Definitely recommend coming here  nice treat away standard buffets like Harrah's  <EOR> If total rewards card $1 off $24 lunch buffet   honest just wasn't very impressed range food offered here   lot foods repeated different stations such rice fatty pasta dishes   salad station also very weak honestly wanted fill good veggies fruits   lot vegetable options fruits ex cut honeydew looked old unappealing   best items steamed clams steamed mussels berry crepe macaroons   also mini eclairs those generally love but pretty dry frosting layer thin hard   would rather pay $25 somewhere else nice plate fish salad   Also think price included soft drink   people front don't ask if even want drink think just charge assume soft drink   wasn't good deal because only wanted water   definitely won't back   side note another reason wouldn't venture back because asked another set silver ware never came server steal new set off another table   When opened new set all silverware inside napkin horribly visibly dirty!  can't believe some server actually took time take those filthy pieces silverware put them napkin ROLL THEM it   Just worth price   Sorry!  workers friendly but food options quality food cleanliness only worth $10 $15  <EOR> HORRIBLE SERVICE  Bad food  Disappointment experience   I you're hostess buffet restaurant takes hundreds customers every day  8PM you're probably tired but when family repeat 5 minutes cousin autism therefore can't wear buffet wristband yeah we're going start off wrong foot  Furthermore if degrade front everyone slowly repeating sureeee don't lossseee wristband more 7 times definitely problem  family's vietnamese heritage but parents speak clear english no miscommunication just very dim hostess disgusting attitude    On dinner food  pay less money better buffets outside Vegas  think  where sub par rating comes me  believe when tag seafood characteristic your buffet then better some decent seafood back up  Instead all some average shrimp crab legs  If want call imitation crab sushi seafood then guess  more add list    All fish dishes insignificant  remember Salmon dry sole less flavored  could but think point now  There's lot competition Vegas relative Le Village doesn't seem trying all  place looks nice decor great but eat food most important thing   Their macaroons fell apart <EOR> This far worst experience any restaurant buffet ever east coast west coast    I am Las Vegas local dietary restrictions gone many different buffets downtown around Las Vegas never experience just had  Upon entering buffet told hostess needed speak shaft due dietary reasons  wait over 10 minutes chef come table well everyone everybody else already eating  When told dietary restrictions chef laughed asked does he expect eat    question said   told cannot eat cheese eggs eat meat follow vegan diet   He right off bat said unfortunately there's much could buffet    told never issue any other casino making customize items dietary restrictions  nothing crazy just vegetables oil instead butter pasta no cheese some type potato maybe something else?! but wasn't offered anything said everything pre made couldn't altered    Also when walked around buffet he told could eat stuff example rice pilaf  know experience rice pilaf usually cooked chicken broth asked he said well yes is  3 times tell eat meat     I found bowl hummus asked if contained dairy some most do  He told he unsure it  When asked if he could find he said he would all way other end casino find out    Really Chef know food cooking    On top only thing could eat fruits veggies raw veggies completely    The service also very slow busy were  waitress did refill drinks forgot other drinks ordered  Plates refilled would walk other side them    This also just because can't eat lot foods other two people party satisfied all  would rather buffet $8 bucks instead blowing over 30  being diamond member would say food good heard service good overall very disappointed    The reaction rudeness chef unacceptable troublesome he knowledgeable serving  Also am sure am only person world dietary restrictions   The only good thing place interior decorations  <EOR> Review dinner   Mmm pretty good food buffet but barely worth money paid    $35 included 17% gratuity   I'd rather nice meal Bouchon roughly same price   Anyway least snow crab legs   love some crab legs   dinner dishes somewhat fancier other buffets Rio i e  won't find hamburgers chicken fingers    duck l'orange pretty good rest meat pretty average slightly above average buffet i e  completely mediocre outside buffet world    recommend brie cheese bacon macaroni sausages mussels crepe station   In end fill spent hour time cracking open crab legs   However dishes aren't spectacularly executed don't think very good value  <EOR> Le Village Buffet Paris Hotel Casino pretty decent!  favorite buffet all time even favorite buffet Las Vegas but still pretty satisfied meal   food fresh service friendly good variety foods   buffet unique structure different stations corresponding different regions themes France which thought pretty cool     I especially liked omelette bar disappointed savory pesto omelette    I also really liked fresh salad bar which some excellent options   steak also delicious    What actually pretty disappointed dessert section  mean c'mon Paris right?  expecting some amazing pastries but came short mostly just macarons which don't eat    Other no complaints food   The wait line bit annoying but find some amazing deals through GroupOn check out   three price 2  <EOR> We stayed Paris hotel few wanted quick fast food didn't require dress code   buffet hotel $20 lunch meal   They really didn't anything good eat   only place thought would worth money crepe stand but crepes soggy moist time back eating area    My favorite part buffet sauteed mushrooms onion soup   Even prime rib over done dry    I desperate pasta stand asked them just boil pasta made own onion pasta soup    I sad when left  DIDN'T EVEN BACON!  Will back rather take buffet experience elsewhere pay more quality food  <EOR> Buffets interesting     Some times eat ton ignoring quality food   Other times eat much knowing full well you're scarfing down some good restaurant grade grub   Le Village Buffet falls kind middle     The Ups Good Crepes  The downs Crab Legs always fresh tasting hard eat Desserts selection sub par Minus crepes Service  The middle grounds The prime rib chicken veggies pastas rice etc   So why?  When many choices buffets place vegas there's no reason should somewhere don't love   Honestly most food just okay biggest appealing things snow crab king crab legs   Since place's weren't good just okay standards   waitresses served multiple occassions attentive   could big group but could also just forced 18% tip didn't want earn it     In end I'd back if others want but I'd rather somewhere else  <EOR> I say friend brought couple years ago raving breakfast place served   Boy he right place best pancakes some type breakfast sausage wonderful   give fresh coffee fresh squeeze OJ which awesome  sit inside prefer outside patio area   Ham Bacon very tasty!! Eggs perfect!! think place top breakfast spots vegas! <EOR> Terrible! Came dinner $30 99 per person  Surprisingly decent line up   The decor actually very lovely  european village would think having europe  But its food   food really poor quality   I did find some neat stuff but able find anything good entire buffet  Some neat stuff found some king crab legs macaroons some poorly done creme brulet  <EOR> Such nice ambience buffet  family purchased groupons advance came bottle wine  much cheaper $33 99 dinner per person  seated immediately Sunday 3 30  waiter service wonderful  cups never empty  variety foods choose including crepe station  chefs always filling trays  sweets gave mini heart attack  wanted each but resisted  tried half them all amazing especially macaroons  Buffet prices rather expensive family but groupon awesome choice ! <EOR> One fav brunch spots Strip  Love crepe bar where fresh made order crepes  Food selection huge great quality  Never disappointed here  usually 24 hr buffet pass $50 which includes buffet many other strip Caesar properties  If want check few Vegas buffets definitely best way go  <EOR> Just ok  Good creme brulee potato dishes  Crab legs meaty once were  sure worth hour wait  Maybe 20 but hour  <EOR> One best buffets Vegas    I'll cut chase  best part made order crepes    warm chocolate sauce put them   Yummy   The crepe station usually doesn't chocolate sauce but if trek over banna's foster station should there   also whipped creme powdered sugar    think going ALL day   The meats ok sometimes they'll some good seasoned meat corner sometimes isn't there   rest stuff honestly pretty standard stuff      The crepes alone worth cost buffet if sweets  eat 2 maybe 3 fully loaded ones   little meat plus free beverage worth it      If arrive before cut off time lunch dinner register pay stay later better food cheaper     The line VERY long times    don't rack lamb carving station mediocre lately  For dinner <EOR> During stay Paris Hotel before roam around strip   we decided breakfast Le Village Buffet  arrived early enough avoid lines started form shortly after  even then lines appeared move quickly  staff very attentive patrons  heard another guest night before omelette station really good   absolutely right  addition omelette's also really good Eggs Benedict Crepes  Although wife special request regards making crepe breakfast chef said all come certain way did deviate toppings fillings crepes  didn't set well mommy! addressed managerial staff concerns address met  Other everything pretty good  wife kept going back smoked salmon  tried little bit everything variety smoked sausages Eggs Benedict potatoes sauteed sweet onions no complaints all  two kids happy said before    if mommy happy am happy!

Located within Paris Casino  Service friendly but just fair  <EOR> I years ago lunch just remember desserts being delicious  However couple days ago breakfast pretty affordable being less $30 but lot items overcooked hard  also very crowded but maybe  because Thanksgiving weekend didn't lot service  There's also only bathroom stall!  The crêpe egg stations really long lines tip jar out  only dessert some pastries pie delicious soft serve  <EOR> Good Vegas breakfast buffet  crepes great unlimited supply  Pretty good variety items sone French items baguettes  Cost $22 plus tip  Chocolate croissants decent too  <EOR> This place used good    past   Came dinner buffet pass standards gone downhill   far better selection tasty food Harrah's   First long wait because some people don't realize place gone down toilet   could find any tasty eat because everything filthy   How did place A?

My only complaint isn't much selection just feel place bit outdated compared other buffets there  <EOR> Le Village proves don't biggest most extravagant spread that would Bacchanal Caesar's provide thoroughly enjoyable experience    October 2013 Le Village only buffet Vegas offers reservations through Open Table   When reservation pass line through separate entrance parlor also used Total Rewards Platinum Diamond members    Waiting line 30 minutes hour buffet really stinks but reservation didn't wait all!  15 minutes late reserved time   member party Platinum status allowed use special check desk even if hadn't reservation   also enabled seated special area where received special service   special service might ask?  server extra friendly but great thing she offered bring steamed crab legs table!  Le Village common people schlep buffet line help themselves pick through crab legs which served cold   Unlike Bacchanal where request crab legs boiled served hot Le Village doesn't offer warm steamed crab legs except status diners   she brought hot bowl bowl hot juicy crab legs until begged stop!  Being brought crab legs directly your table elevates buffet dining experience beyond normal dining much more enjoyable   having gorged many crab legs only enough room leftover sample few other dishes   only reason don't give Le Village 5 stars because selection dishes doesn't rival Bacchanal   But actually did enjoy crab legs better Le Village because brought table also salty unlike Bacchanal   Aside food also loved slightly kitschy atmosphere French village   macarons other desserts very good albeit huge variety Bacchanal instead standard soft serve offer frozen custard which slightly different texture richer taste   At end meal server brought table 5 people 10 chocolate bar lollipops shaped Eiffel Tower 5 dark chocolate 5 white chocolate   later saw identical treats gift shop hotel $3 50 each!   I'd highly recommend getting Platinum status enjoy benefits!  If don't want gamble lot earn your status instantly Platinum status if apply approved Total Rewards credit card  <EOR> I tried brunch buffet  really good  many selection seafood beef pork  omelette crepes line shorter expected  All servers really kind trying your visit pleasant possible  If stay Paris hotel definitely try!! <EOR> Le Village Buffet Paris le fail    Expectations weren't high considering already knew Wynn Bellagio Studio B buffet would trounce place any day week even off night   The breads just sucked no flavor questionably stale  Insulting French culture serve bread just isn't good calling themselves Paris Las Vegas  better Hue Thai Baguette Cafe    The fettuccine alfredo just tasted watered down alfredo mix  know buffet but fail badly fettuccine alfredo? pesto sauce spaghetti helped redeem them   The mussels weren't even remotely fresh strong fishy taste  sign wasn't very fresh    My experience mussels didn't want chance sushi  didn't want dose lax meal  other person group confirmed its suckiness he isn't hard reviewer me   Half chicken very moist since near skin other half dryer Vegas summer day   One saving grace meal crepes waffle station  amazed chef just making crepes ease  waffles tasted great   The first round prime rib little dry  Round 2 3 much better but also very rare  would even Dexter faint  could loaded all day but little early day this   This place does snow crab legs claws but its such PITA eat because don't crack open nicely Wynn  sure people would loaded but wasn't worth time   The champagne poor quality  Don't bother unless just want free alcohol  Just play penny slots yourself some free drinks instead   I didn't chance try desert but others group says its good   Our group nice cozy quiet room but also rocky table  McGuvyer'd bunch sugar packets base table   Service first waiter just wasn't good  He forgot which drinks ordered  Carding champagne even though didn't want any couldn't even recognize birthday Nevada ID still pouring champagne into glass even said no  Even interrupting conversation just pour champagne front face  Just walk around pour glasses just take glass off table pour  know isn't 5 star place but little common sense long way  second waiter more attentive clearing plates timely manner refilling drinks without asking   But $30 mediocre below average food lunch when spend couple bucks more Wynn dinner place already lose star  little less would understandable    Go Studio B buffet if you're coming SoCal much better stuff cheaper prices  Otherwise spend little more money Bellagio Wynn  You're vacation spend extra couple bucks better meal  <EOR> Having dinner family could more disappointed  All food stations look abandoned  food dry unflavored some stations haven't refilled entire time  overpriced considering you're getting  lady rotisserie station managed serve BIG chunks fat prime rib even asked multiple times give different piece  need better staff better food better service  star kind waitress got  <EOR> My favorite buffet Vegas! breakfast selection good!   Tips if you're staying least 2 days Vegas buffet buffet deal! save lot money if decide just eat buffets  come Le Village buffet EARLY dinner because wait anywhere 20mins an hour! <EOR> The cashiers hilarious outgoing!  definitely many champions restaurant made experience wonderful   atmosphere calm quiet   painted skies give impression you're outside cafe France   waitress awesome too!  far food goes    Everything great EXCEPT chicken cacciatore which consisted chicken tomato puree   crepes salad crab legs salad cream chicken soup amazing!  even sushi but would suggest passing   If look fish inside rolls would walk away! <EOR> If reading chances saw Groupon deal tempted   should skip place move on   came many years ago recalling being pretty good   Well speed present day WHOA changed?!  service poor quality food even worse   Let easily point 2 things found comical   sushi 1 type ones bunch guords kind would never eat order   #2 title plate Macaroons    Oh come on!  Paris Hotel Le Village Buffet should know difference between Macarons Macaroons properly sandwich one    puffy sides faces out!  However 1 star compliment crepe bar   am big crepe person but told bad   reservations 24 hours before     In total skip $60 Groupon + $10 parking fee should Buffet Wynn Hotel would come same price considering parking still free  <EOR> All eat less $30  Good food free champagne before 3pm weekends if want   Everything sushi pasta steaks   Good service too  <EOR> I came November 2011 during Thanksgiving Week  line insanely long but experience made better girl boyfriend constantly checking The food choices very vast small comparison other buffets    The lighting quite dim overall main area  The thing enjoyed Mac Brie Cheese bits bacon  Other didn't really enjoy offerings  Because stuffed myself mac cheese didn't leave room dessert but seeing french place would think offerings would more exotic  <EOR> Little food selection  When ask workers help give attitude upset <EOR> Champagne Brunch  Unlimited mimosas Brunch need say more? Food good service could better but unlimited drinks definitely appealing  Although fairly pricy buffet Vegas good deal some healthier options  meat also better quality would expected fancy macaroons desert  <EOR> We ended staying extra night Vegas because Traffic Sunday Thanksgiving horrendous! turned back 15 called Total Rewards did comp room Paris  Staying decided Buffet here  before previous trips food always pretty good!   I'm giving them 3 stars because service food  most recent trip came 8 45 p m  line short but people waiting seated  time purchased until time seated 30 minutes! place busy ask what's going told some call outs  totally understand  server took longer then normal but she working really hard did awesome job  Would come back just hope management could handle staff callouts better  should ever take 30 minutes seated nearly empty buffet  <EOR> 2 5 stars more accurate I did realize more likely remember discount slot members ended paying additional $3 dollars per person   started off bowl fresh berries strawberry yogurt sampling different cheeses   next plate featured Lyonnaise potatoes Andouille sausage poached pear cheese spinach omelet few strips bacon   preparing more pass realized staff making switch over lunch taste tasted dish mussels shrimp cocktail another clams none which distinguished itself  better success 2 slices pie both light delicious  buffet may gone down hill over years but remains better most  <EOR> Seriously best breakfast buffet Vegas! please place! First off place located paris themed hotels walking pass all stores pastries shops look buildings Paris  long line which when but line moved quick  think waited maybe 5 10 minutes  Once table straight buffet  OMG everything amazing! your own omelette station personal fave  am picky omelettes guy made mine did good! assortment typical breakfast food eggs bacon sausage then straight breakfast pastry section buffet everything fresh! please  When husband decide come back come back sure! <EOR> This place really taken nose dive since 9 years ago  dinner price food selection quality quite poor  remember restaurant being lot better 9 years ago  Meat dry sitting much long  Really much choose 6yr old  place par your local Hometown Buffet  Everyone seemed miserable working there  cashiers meat slicer crepe pourer servers everyone scowl faces screams HATE JOB HATE BOSS  spoke 2 dealers pai gow tables later night both agree Le Village TANKED recent years  can't recommend  <EOR> Go only if you're staying Paris   destination buffet   Both breakfast dinner adequate best   No better lot worse any other hotel buffet   Don't believe hype French food  it's not! <EOR> Had breakfast delicious!  First time ever plan returning   Second stop BoB   some wait line around 9 30am   When left lunch line looong!    The restaurant looks small but pretty big different stations   breakfast selection good many options choose only different options but varieties each option example different types scrambled eggs hash browns   I good experience server attentive   ************************ We liked buffet much BoB decided try more time before leave time lunch time   lot different pastas meats   think lunch couple bucks more but think breakfast buffet better   There crepe station where crepe made spot toppings available line always long  Went once just try okay   The custard delicious!  wanted try small dessert before leaving rather getting pastry ice cream cones ice cream except ice cream custard delicious! <EOR> Relatively speaking Le Village Buffet great deal $25   recently dinner buffet happily waddled way two hours   For non meat eaters veggie options really good   might your 25 dollars worth veggies but grilled veggies mushrooms cheeses cooked carrots delicious     Le Village Buffet also crepe station where very nice man your very own sweet savory crepe order   also wide variety dessert items mini creme brules must have   ahead    five!  The meat items o k  seafood would expect desert    little fishy me   The staff very friendly helpful too! <EOR> Im giving buffet generous 2 star rating  found overpriced under stocked  dinner buffet disaster  pricey long wait such crappy food  decent variety food choices  crab legs old only 20 being replenished staff  far worst buffet Vegas  Save yourself some time Creperie across hall buffet  $8 99  delicious huge crepe fill better  buffet ever could  would return Paris next trip Vegas  wasnt impressed  no Venetian  recommend buffet Mandalay Bay most impressive best choices Wynn Buffet close second  forget Burger Bar Mandalay Bay  <EOR> I lunch price breakfast Monday $3 dollars saving 10 45 a m   4th visit  other times all dinners  lunch awesome found empty table box seats section waiter able arrangement party four  Try prime rib steak  done just right very juicy tender  back ask another order  Also crapes excellent   Only downside sushi section all looked withered serving size they half roll   Oh well supposed French but Asian anyhow   quite experience  <EOR> On June 11th decided come breakfast   always nice friend platinum member Harrahs because sit platinum dining area where own omelette guy!  cool that?  other food good great but omelette orange juice best items day!!! <EOR> This place $30 per person  say worth it  loved food  deserts yummy  ordered strawberry crepe  Yummy yummy yummy <EOR> Great desserts regional cuisines France  would if expecting classy buffet  If want Bellagio Wynn  I'd say food okay   about same level Mirage  atmosphere decor pretty depressing  think Mirage buffet newer more modern try place first  <EOR> If zero stars would rate buffet option  Tasteless stale worth time come here  surprised many people came dinner  dined briefly since buffet buffets 24 hour pass   think pass place now    <EOR> This place really solid performer over years  patron probably 7 years    conflicted four star but let try explain why It's hard rate buffet know since offer three different meals day also off days   I'd say breakfast probably best buffets strip plenty variety food always 4 star   Lunch again fantastic selection maybe lose half star because there's nothing menu really really shines but then again don't expect place really knock outta shoes lunch   Le Village dinner however I'd skip   selection again but alot other fantastic options strip barely few dollars more  <EOR> The customer service waiters extremely nice pretending but u tell happy welcoming enjoyed time food kids found all want    all fresh delicious <EOR> We Thanksgiving  Very good  Long lines front food kind annoying  But food quality good  lot variety  Highlight dessert  Very very good  Home cooking sure!!

Spinach too   you bet?!  Nothing sitting long probably crowded that! rightfully everything delicious! Can't say bad thing here  Even smuggled few cookies snack during adventures day couldn't eat them buffet stuffed!!  Really loved dinning experience here!! <EOR> THEY CREPE BAR!!! fresh fruit most likely give diabetes  being said your crepes fresh unlike Spice Market Planet Hollywood   top your crepes they actually fold your fruits Taco Bell cruch wrap supreme strawberry banana cherry peaches nuts    I breakfast look omlette bar right before took down  tend focus little more french food desserts but still your standard buffet fare  buffet better average buffet because HUGE amount variety even Vegas buffet    I really liked way even inside buffet made effort continue Parisian small town motiff  Servers dressed peasant style my memory might faulty might just seating hostesses      mind fully preoccupied crepes For those sleep late stuck long line outside worrying missing delicious food don't worry! WON'T kick once breakfast over  just sit nurse your pleasantly stuffed belly wait till feel continuing lunch!   If love crepes must Las Vegas buffet stop I also highly recommended creperie across buffet if buffet line long crepes better <EOR> The buffet okay less satisfactory experience you'd expect buffet vegas especially iconic hotel such Paris  You're heart city entertainment capital world leader culinary industry  design buffet itself absolutely gorgeous making feel your outside village France  far gets positivity  blame chef himself herself  Food consistently taken care making crust top maintained hot  selections varied but flavors okay  waitress quite rude seemed always rushing leave closing time approaching 40 minutes  very sad heartbreaking experience quite honest such beautiful hotel right heart vegas having mediocre experience  Paris wows eiffel tower painted ceilings beautiful decor inside truly crushing buffet doesn't keep standard  Paris truly beautiful escape where accordion players would once greet you'd walk through casino  Slowly but surely cutting back lot knows why buffet victim crime  Please back magical escape hey let's average buffet located outside mall next highway <EOR> The food OK but atmosphere fun staff great  isn't place I'd again unless someone group wanted to  better buffets Vegas but isn't total loss  fun lots food great staff hardly wait  <EOR> This buffet gone down hill   Last time mediocre gave more shot  Hardly any good selection lunch  Quality  gone down selections   rid another section food   All done never coming back don't waste your time money!!!! <EOR> So here's deal  came breakfast wasn't great   The service terrible  could server refill waters orange juice save life given warm  hate warm water soda juice milk even coffee  drinks ice cold bothered me    The food Eh    okay  worth $25 per person cost  sure   Several types eggs potatoes along bacon sausage mini French toasts mini pancakes croissants muffins bagels fruit etc    had   think only reason come pay price if plan eating several full plates which didn't  didn't eat much all because mediocre best   EXCEPTION!!!!! exception did decide try crepe   #1 which nutella bananas hazelnuts whipped cream  Okay thing f*****g Delicious!!  capital D  only reason giving two star rating  However sure find restaurant much cheaper wonderful crepe   Also left boyfriend started feeling really sick several trips bathroom throughout day  while crepes good we'd never come back due price blah food fact boyfriend pretty sick  <EOR> The food food food!  OMG food!  Lots yummy tidbits taste presented nicely   lots different cuisine   then bottomless mimosa option $11 99   worth it! <EOR> Best buffet so far tried Vegas! Thanks groupon amazing deal dinner 2 + bottle wine well worth it  Food liked most pastas meat dish served individual mini cast irons  favorite part though custom crepes    omggggg wish room 2 but place left stuffed  also love decor kind similar real thing really does look feel a village  Def recommend  <EOR> No more made order omelets can't pick exactly want your crepes instead just pick predetermined list crepes pre made scrambled eggs  understand change faster getting through lines but definitely isn't great value was  rest food just mediocre <EOR> A small selection food $34 person  Most food salty bland  Want soda? only all alternate brands  Want coke? Pepsi  Want Sprite Sierra Mist  IMO  bit odd buffet   Most important thing note group six all ended getting diarrhea  actually vomited six times following day  and didn't even drink!  Waste money  <EOR> 3 number weekends row escaped LA Vegas   and 3 weekends      5 number nights clubbing 120 number dollars lost gambling during 3 weekends 1 number girls phone number yea yea know you're gonna say but personal best    lol 2 number times ate Le Village Buffet  5 number pounds gained result   !!  well   stats listed above clearly shows love Le Village Buffet   mean why else would Vegas 3 weekends row? ahem aside pool girls booze girls food girls    actually ate twice 3 weeks?  well first all price isn't bad all like $10 cheaper Bellagio    second good food crab legs shrimp cocktail die dessert selections forever uphill battle undisciplined eaters me   but hey only live once   twice three weeks isn't bad it?  damn guilty conscience   here tip come hungry but during 2 3pm time frame   because shortly start bringing dinner selections   also champagne brunch saturdays sundays until 3 330pm   CHOMP AWAY SINFULLY Yelpers more   ! <EOR> Having eaten buffet 5 times over past 6 years can`t believe terrible food along service taken place Waiting line pay took 1 hour employees really showing any care world The assortment food options quality embarrassing disappointing guest  Can believe any casino buffet even inferior entries now going dessert section doesn't piece any kind cake pie?  Don't go! <EOR> The Paris buffet must breakfast brunch trips Vegas   need before 11AM when switch over lunch menu which also decent   But nothing beats good breakfast breakfast menu crave   With excellent mini croissants made order crepes omelettes smoked salmon variety sausages bacon french toast variety cheeses etc Paris buffet offers wide variety delicious choices breakfast reasonable $14   So shake off your late night hangovers drag your tired ass wonderful breakfast buffet  Can't speak lunch dinner  come for <EOR> I bought groupon deal dinner Sunday night  Came around 7ish holy Hera wait 45 min long! When finally seated server took forever drinks wait utensils  Food definitely overrated honestly did think money's worth even though deal it  only good things prime rib crepes  Macaroons over done tasted 1+ days old  Everything else meh dessert almost hometown buffet  coming back here  <EOR> I loved atmosphere but service little lacking  5 ordered 4 orange juice 1 Mimosa  received 5 Mimosa's 1 orange juice  know busy Saturday morning afternoon but waiter pretty much missing action  However food diverse delicious except fruit  fruit wasn't eatable all  If couldn't serve ripe fruit shouldn't serve at  But overall place visit again next trip Las Vegas  <EOR> Compare all other buffets Vegas I'd say ok  great just all right  Since ate day night contrast between two tell which better time   Day opinion eating Le Village breakfast should aiming for  They're breakfast crepes omelets wonderfully scrumptious! always choose eat morning because 1 line isn't long probably 30 minute wait 2 atmosphere great  Oh gosh just love french toast maple syrup! Yum  waffles buffet more soft moist all others Vegas  addition believe Le Village Buffet serves best creme brulee strip  When eat morning just heaven  perfect way start day!  Night am such big fan buffet night  I'd rather Rio Planet Hollywood Caesar's Palace eat  buffet lacks savory food needs mention lot choices food here  way crepes night too   overwhelming  remembered waiting 15 mins line gigantic stuffed crepe didn't even taste good  feel eating blob dough chocolate over sweeten fruits  really ruined appetite  don't think ever ate crepes night again that  It s nowhere near morning crepes  guess all depends person them  ***Note creme brulee!

Maybe trying control flow people eating?  Regardless probably return  <EOR> We usually eat every time Vegas  thought quality gone down since added 24 hr buffet listing  dessert highlight meal  crepes HUGE  delicious  pretty stuffed couldn't finish it  <EOR> Kudos Le Village Buffet being only buffet serves Sierra Mist   Very unexpected buffet bookmarked while now  unexpected mean average   Not lot variety food  3 plates food came back almost same stuff  Prime rib great when prime rib ever not? Do mashed potatoes   They're only semi mashed  they're all mushed slices potatoes    The sushi bar isn't great  only 3 4 kinds sushi which weren't great  loved shrimp cocktail bar all shrimps just lying there  Also crab legs they're fresh! The BEST part buffet crepe section  There's long line but well worth wait  crepes good choose much fillings want  Really nice lady behind counter    And way what's people leaving tips? least leave dollar God's sakes seeing waiters clean your mess  waiter nice very energetic despite he seemed old but plates off table once finished huge props him!   I wouldn't say $30 worth since better but worst had  <EOR> I am very disappointed buffet party ten told order sit together include 18% gratuity would split up  told them split sorry but am getting own food bringing drinks supposed picking plates which did happen once  once decided split Happy wrote big SPLIT Check each waitress said oh split made sure 2 different rooms far apart each other when plenty room room other people came still other party fives there  friendly although food good good variety returning due poor customer service horrible attitude staff  other 3 buffets split no problem still sat each other guess left good tip  mean brought 10 people your buffet but refuse forced into set gratuity doing anything  If regular restaurant then would understand gratuity working butts off provide service  ridiculous uncalled say selection service spice market awesome packed still did awesome job! <EOR> Oh mighty fall  buffet used great  No expense spared  everything  Sadly now charge $30 each breakfast quality gone downhill   way downhill  Half bakery gone crepes smaller  toaster broken  Eggs Benedict pathetic site  place threadbare depressing  Also no wait in  used huge line front  People aren't stupid    tell when quality down  plainly obvious buffet over  Sad! <EOR> Good place 24 hour pass  Very different style food but very good nice try different food every once awhile  Best bet would 24 hour pass  <EOR> If prime rib snow crab legs shellfish creme brûlée then come here  tends much busier weekdays because cheaper compared weekends  wary long lines especially dinner!  I weekday 11 00am  hour wait  Once seated however waiter quickly came take orders drinks  He very courteous took away plates refilled drinks quickly   The buffet salad bar crepe station dessert section center European style food  pasta saffron rice potatoes sauerkraut sausage    all good   The place bit cramped dark if you're middle buffet  long meat line harder see some food  But all worth more  some notable foods The snow crab legs you'd find many other buffets Las Vegas  Fresh good!  As shellfish mussels clams done two ways when tomato based sauce white sauce  Both equally delicious   The prime rib rare melts your mouth  haven't any better meat life  long line form along buffet plan ahead!  There moderate selection deserts such small cakes tarts creme brûlée  definitely satisfy your sweet tooth   The only complaint duck  dry tough nearly inedible  However there's wide selection other meats choose didn't affect dining experience   Now you're probably aware place cheap! plan attack buffet your money's worth 1  probably waited while you're starving  However don't want stuff yourself first plate  first plate all seafood crab legs mussels clams   Avoid carbs   2  line some meat  let your stomach rest plate meat   3  Now if pasta you've wanting try    eat those carbs but limit them if want eat dessert   4  DESSERT!

OMG stop serving flan?!  mention didn't even creme brulee did past   Half dessert weren't even French lady working dessert station threatened because took many fruits saying can't take them because security door   statement laughable many ways   First all took fruit because nothing eat way presumptuous!  security check sure weren't smuggling fruits buffet? LOL!!  sure they'd really pay someone money stand exit pat people down before left   C'mon!  Oh crepes station?  OVERRATED!  nothing real thing trust me  <EOR> sorry bubble gut started within 20 minutes leaving place  there's reason buffets think all buffets should shut down health hazard  people working problem but dirty nasty indviduals dining create health hazards communal serving spoons where touch same thing every other person touched   really should install hand santizers all buffets near all stations easily disinfect yourself before getting sick  food warm which good thing just place seemed dirty side customers seemed very well       let's just say install hand sanitizers ASAP  <EOR> Have lived Vegas long time   Most buffets pretty average   thoroughly impressed quality food much better any other buffet too   crazy price    But least food good! <EOR> Everyone raves buffet but wasn't impressed probably because simple food lot fancy options  did find simple food tasted good but man line in!!! crepes dessert nice but spoiled because wife excellent ones home  <EOR> Go buffet if you're leaning towards desserts seafood mussels clams   isn't much selection compared maybe Caesers Rio but decent  <EOR> 3 5 stars actually  reservation don't wait  waiter amazing forgot name but everyone else worked station seemed annoyed hated job  Anytime I'd ask them question ask something station would annoyed  Food average buffet  best but worst  <EOR> Yummy!! hit Paris start buffet buffets 3 pm Friday   off time allowed walk right in    What treat! crepe making station good!! 2 couldn't eat another bite would more! awesome selection non meat eaters such myself   Great pastas soups cheeses bread did mention crepes?!

If careful  <EOR> As someone actually traveled Paris crepes etc  say possibly *worst* imitation ever had   food just two steps short inedible specifically crepes   chef horrible attitude   unless your crepes taste more pancakes disgusting canned fillings take your appetite somewhere else   Perhaps even somewhere without lighting dreary dark barely see your food your dining companions   best guess place purposely miserable people leave quickly   Depressing experience both food atmosphere wise    Enjoyed buffet Aria Wynn much more  <EOR> The buffet Paris hotel never disappoints me  both breakfast dinner buffet both great  food choices French American  breakfast buffet more pastry options but love crepe during dinner well   chef crepe front hot fresh  always banana Nutella crepe whipped cream  atmosphere amazing whole experience pleasant one  <EOR> Just AMAZING! sure isn't rated 5 stars  many options all ages!

Cooked just way medium rare tender juicy DELICIOUS totally exceeded expectations  only other thing stood creme brulee  didnt really think buffet lot variety but food definitely good lot dessert items choose from  also 2 plates king crab legs murdered once started couldnt stop!! service awesome! <EOR> Paris once amazing casino unbelievable buffet   gone downhill over past several years Caesar's decided spend money elsewhere neglect some its formerly exceptional properties   used rave buffet friends ALWAYS brought friends Le Village Buffet breakfast   Especially if first time visitors Las Vegas   fairly expensive but used worth it   Well only took final experience no longer taking people here   EVER     The food quality gone way down hill   no longer extensive list French foods once great buffet   downgraded just basic food omelets bland isn't dessert selection used have   Read end see final straw don't want gross people out     The service time friends wait staff came around twice   hour     The Ambiance still nice looks French villages pleasant dining atmosphere     The final straw please forgive grossing but ants pastry   Yes did find pastry seemed palatable but added protein element   When want protein meat sections dessert section     I avoid buffet all costs   back definitely worth price  <EOR> This buffet expect most buffets Vegas  Yes some better some worse but buffet falls right middle between must visit completely avoid  also included theTotal Rewards Buffet Buffets which great deal especially if buffet don't because just leave another without paying extra fee   There wide selection buffet most buffet's  Its french theme even though lot choose isn't huge variety would Planet Hollywood buffet    Everything eat decent really depends your palate food prepared day  menu serve hasn't changed last four years they'll probably stick have  Most things eat serious hit miss only real consistent thing pastas which totally good but really tasty opinion  brother food poisoning crab legs would stay away them  But honestly kind rule thumb shouldn't eat shellfish buffet anyway   The desserts complete miss opinion  French themed buffet macarons different colors only come two flavors which underwhelming say least  Another downside place there's only stall bathroom good luck anyone during busy time day  <EOR> It buffet  Thought would superb  early cause lines always long  course easy options  Food so  Eggs runny tasteless  price thought would more options  disappointed  <EOR> Came during labor day weekend ended because all other buffet 2 hour waits   $38 pretty disappointing   only descent protein prime rib roast turkey which dismal   didn't love potatoes au gratin either   dislike potatoes   mash potatoes lumps   king crab legs tiny cold   shrimp cocktail okay   lot seafood variety all   only descent thing crepe batter really nice   creme brulee really decandent    if patient would gone Caesars shelled $10 more  <EOR> OK if comped  Otherwise Bellagio Aria Planet Hollywood larger well run clean  Service terrible almost nonexistent  buffet workers also missing several stations  asked dishes she answered don't know any sent another station  No plates anywhere near dessert station lots empty spaces where desserts hadn't replenished  Messy lots areas  No excuse because wasn't busy 5 PM Friday  <EOR> Most important skip line if platinum diamond seven seas member   Otherwise line long expect wait 30 minutes so   separate line close look glass doors   The quality food ok nothing really stands lot disasters   describe sad state buffets strip better ones   One thing must stay pretty good macaroons crème brulee   Save your appetite these  <EOR> My friend spends ton time casino buffets  contrary feel don't money's worth when frequent buffet  don't stomach gorge  However love variety   Le Village Buffet located Paris Las Vegas  Naturally having friend expert timing when should buffet she recommended going 11 am  allows plop down both breakfast lunch foods   There wait before seated  organized thankfully  waited half hour   We three hours  loved breakfast items  am perfectly happy getting pancakes sausage  Anything else bonus   Being Parisian themed casino devour chocolate croissants  favourite  buttery perfect   My friend overdid crepes  love crepes but she brought back three different flavours expected split them her

Check place also look into getting 24hr  backstage buffet pass $45  eat various other buffets other casinos such Rio Planet Hollywood etc  <EOR> Ah quite disappointing! line long totally worth it  Yelp you've let down time!  Wynn Buffet much better    just pretty average = <EOR> I think quality buffet dropped substantially recent   quality food mediocre but found more disturbing just overall hygiene place   All food stations mess food dropped everywhere no cleaning up   food floor people slipping on!  prime rib tough difficult chew   major highlight crepe station but crepes customers eating across street looked lot better   Needless say utterly disappointing   Personally would spend little more eat Bellagio Wynn   Overall best described gourmet Hometown Buffet   decor nice b c supposed feel eating outdoor cafe   friends ate remarked much quality dropped since came several years ago   may due recession being part Buffet Buffet ticket  <EOR> Came eat brothers buffet trust when say never again  Let just start off food  Everything tasted old nothing seemed fresh tried crab asked lady if she could heat crab she told believe Diamond card heat carb guess 80$ payed wasn't enough hot crab now waitress      just seemed very unhappy she brought drink quick but then never came back again refills check ask table cleaned couple times  Over all never recommend place anyone aware somewhere else eat bcc if eat enjoy food time atmosphere  <EOR> I've only dined champagne brunch but definitely worth return every time Vegas work play  buffet huge variety satisfying all palettes may your party  bit pricey but if you're Vegas should known going come pocket just anything here  restaurant designed very beauty beast provincial town way occasional Parisian singing troupe performing cobble stone streets front restaurant yet very lovely charming nearby ching ching environment  Don't miss brunch! <EOR> By far BEST breakfast buffet Vegas  They've all   Benedict Crepes eggs all meats wonderful desserts  would suggest buffet dinner time but lunch MISS IT! <EOR> Phenomenal leg lamb  pink glistening tender flavorful    prime rib completely brown but utterly delicious tender dissolves tongue   cold crab legs bursting flavor   crawfish bouillabaisse briliant!   Duck l'orange wasn't bad   Gnocchi la Kouros cassolet pork beef  enjoyable  but other sides pastas kind plain side   Cheeses cheese tray let down run of the mill cheddar muenster smoked gouda     Main complaint though dark eating area your food looks uniformly grey muddy once your table   tables need candles  any kind localized lighting really badly  <EOR> This place freakin AWESOME! Seriously folks pay $25 bucks per person stay hour    2    Eat slow your money's worth   Every time am Vegas sure stop Paris buffet  all time fav  buffet because food pur LUX  feel your body getting fed  food isn't processed crap eat all day   I love variety atmosphere service FOOD!  I totally recommend duck l'orange  fav  item menu   The wait long    15 35 minutes   But buffet worth it    It's ages since Vegas    hmmm maybe should take boyfriend weekend trip  just eat here!   A++ <EOR> I'm no Vegas buffet connoisseur but found alot delicious food here  Lamb Prime Rib excellent! Thankfully Prime Rib rare side I hate that BBQ ribs also good  Lots potato dishes carb addict enjoy Delicious desserts upon desserts Creme brulee Cheese cakes flan apple cobbler could but wont because would ridiculously long review  number dishes I'd never heard sounded French which wanted try but time I'd finished gorging myself familiar no more room X  There many more buffets Vegas need try but if find myself hungry vacinity Paris again certainly stop eat again  <EOR> I really excited try crepe area  line wasn't long moved quick!   The pretzel rolls really good! Why waste buffet room bread know but trust this    Two kinds macaroni cheese people!  Plenty desserts tempt your taste buds! <EOR> My favorite Sunday brunch  Way much food eat everything but best! First time sister paid  caveat eat share food  think sat least 2 hours whole time she kept telling moneys worth    <EOR> This buffet comes very close second Bellagio buffet list all time favorite buffets It's pretty short list   love cheese selection fresh crepes  <EOR> This place really sucked  awful smell some parts restaurant  food looked didn't refreshed often which surprising since heavy traffic  food just looked really sad    Awful experience  <EOR> This used favorite buffets  close anywhere close being perfect BUT because felt few buffets Vegas felt worth visit without poking hole wallet   But prime rib now similar leather au jus watery bland mussels weird texture them even new batch most food taste dry if left sun   and crème brûlée no longer crème de la crème    = I guess if anything just back champagne brunch weekends  least  something considered Vegas way  <EOR> Okay tried place '05 honestly don't remember anything special maybe 3 stars still many  If place theme suppose Paris should more French food?

What really liked buffet many types foods based different regions France  instance some food items originating Burgundy Alsace  However confused when found buffet table hummus sushi sweet potatoes next each other  hope changed way organize food station remember making French food  another note stuffed baked tomatoes good fairly much enjoyed pasta dishes crab legs  ham meat station carnivores must! meat tender juicy flavorful  small section salad fruit    The crepes order okay very impressed selection toppings ended decorating plate mother's plate another guest's plate when saw making crepe look somewhat presentable  batter seemed thin crepe more pizzelle cookie end except semi soft    They desert station browse around but recommend staying away creme caramel flan  Definitely needs some flavor improvement there  heard creme brulee pretty good though    I loved environment place! Friendly service lively people  Nice place come eat before hitting strip night part Buffet Buffets 24 hour deal! <EOR> I very excited try Paris Buffet because heard pretty good    but NO GOOD!   Food very salty  Meat extremely dry  didn't eat lot stuff plate because just wasn't good  crepe bar nice but  given considering we're Paris   Very average buffet probably would again   However server extremely friendly kind  +1 = didn't think worth price dinner buffet   would think better lunch brunch  probably worth stop if buy Buffet Buffets 40 24 hour buffet pass 7 buffets which did next day  <EOR> This second time Paris Breakfast Buffet would return again again   $22 enough food day!  high quality well prepared food tons selection oat meal included and greens fabulous pastries   custard machine crowning touch great meal before hiking   does crowded early reservation   few buffets let reservation  <EOR> Oh man    why does place exist???? best buffet Vegas    tried all sorts buffets Vegas  Saturday Morning Champagne Brunch  long line but worth wait    They every kind food think of  best hummus pasta desserts seafood oh mention CREPES  Oh good! <EOR> By far best buffet Las Vegas  all others but takes top place book breakfast    The best thing buffet crepe bar  basic moderate ingredients starting day nutella banana bacon crepe simply great    If sweet breakfast your thing then try hitting savory brunch options  hour between breakfast lunch start bring lunch options which added bonus if you're looking more savory dishes    If still room dessert try each pastries  You're Vegas live little    The service mixed bag times but overall fun time    Fun note Even though you're Paris Casino find anyone Le Villiage Buffet speaks French  Using Spanish gotten better service food options  <EOR> I'm big buffet eater but least while Vegas  Thank goodness read reviews completely agree assessment majority other yelpers 2012  lunch really good  2 helping prime rib because just good  tried slew items including fish chips pleasantly surprised everything seasoned spiced accordingly  fear going buffets most food bland but really good would definitely again  FUN Happy Eating!! <EOR> Loved it! prime rib delicious BBQ area great selection meat chicken sausage being constantly grilled put out  enjoyed potato gratin loved steamed carrots bit crunchy bit soft  The cheese paired mini french baguette mouthwatering  Desserts OK loved creme brulee but wish would bring back caramel walnut toppings crepre station  The hostess super friendly very welcoming  waitress great always coming back check us  All workers cheerful hard working  I would highly recommend buffet definitely come back  <EOR> Don't waste your money!! Terrible service terrible  food  salmon dry  roast beef again dry  Chicken did look fresh mash potatoes crusty sitting long completion  Server only brought beverage then never saw again  Absolutely no variety  Some stations closed don't disturb servers back suppose assisting meat carver   When ask assistance look given could sear meat  Desserts? Creme brulee puddle syrup top probably holding temperature 101 degrees  we're lot small individual pastries however hard tell no labels  did taste something suppose tiramisu    I think  Soft ice cream decent along cute lollypop macaroons  Not Vegas favorites  <EOR> There crepe very good    pick savory sweet kind  surprised many different kinds sausages served  big variety other foods  Macaroons very hard all taste same  around 3 don't know if dinner menu different  <EOR> Totally didn't plan coming last day Vegas but some time kill before heading airport  Why eat?

When does easter become holiday?????  se when come back  She said only use Monday Friday  paid full price didnt free drinks    What service? Never buy groupon  deceiving  <EOR> This place ok   2ed Ceaser's palace buffet eyes   love environment setting just because feels outside dining  Other then food somewhat quality good experience  <EOR> Yummy yummy breakfast  probably best meal trip Vegas last year  many choices all good  usually impressed buffets because quite often mass produced food poor quality  upset though fact started putting lunch before time breakfast supposed end isn't Vegas all staying late sleeping in?? want breakfast until 11am damn it! <EOR> I really buffet   am sure if cute outside Paris theme creme brulee CHEESE BUFFET but really it   eaten twice although wait time atrocious would back again!  Last time pushy line cutters behind but made through   different food choices me   If avoid horde crab leg section find nice sample traditional French dishes try   just fill cheese  Service usually good buffet   Dessert selection better ones creme brulee frozen custard   Try during week avoid waiting 1+ hours line! <EOR> Oh well am glad Groupon because Sunday special where two wines beer don't tell only three types wine two types beer mean seriously your going advertised then say limited selections  Poor! Then food selection place looks big packed outside but really food your average buffet foods salad bar well salad bar very very little selection very much choose from  other foods eh alright guess would defiantly coming back sure told good but great all  think spent more time making look France anything very little seating maneuver around obstacles enough sure didn't run into anyone  think really need rethink buffet style here  just don't big selection food choose think buffets should lot choices  <EOR> my favorite vegas buffet all time  t come almost every trip vegas because its reasonably priced food always fantastic  perfect variety love paris  even if its long wait plenty really good cafes within short walking distance  but bring jacket    gets cod here  oh area improvement dessert selection would d well itself stock moist chocolate cake  <EOR> Still best buffets vegas   But quite ggod last year   cutdown buffet little seams luke notoffer many new thins   But both dinne breakfast very good  <EOR> The highlight meal literally mean because way excited when stumbled upon line buffet Brie  Bacon Macaroni mashed potatoes gravy asparagus  Then topped off dessert creme brulee strawberries nutella crepe  perfect  other food alright but didn't pay much attention although did notice crab little salty likings  place itself nice setting sat room made feel eating someone's house which suppose goal since sat wooden round dining table grubbin  <EOR> As disclaimer only buffet visited Vegas can't offer any advice buffet may stack other buffets  picked Le Village because seen day before when inside Paris Hotel Casino  Also time walked down Strip near Paris pretty hungry good place stop lunch given some other buffets would longer walk    We lunch which $24 99 person including tip  am sure other Vegas buffets offer but overhearing table over surprised buffet did include glass wine  Soda soft drinks included Pepsi products   lunchtime buffet wasn't crowded seated table main section near dessert area  waitress friendly did good job keeping clearing plates    The buffet usual staples shrimp carving station prime rib ham turkey  also extensive salad bar area also contained various types soups fresh fruit  favorite dishes truffle pasta  also roasted chicken quite tasty back many trips back buffet friend recommended it   I enjoyed crepe station buffet delicious strawberry nutella crepe  menu also other interesting crepe flavor combinations looked good well  favorite desserts macarons plenty flavors pick from    Overall beyond full dining buffet thought selection pretty decent quality food good  <EOR> I'm big buffet fan but they're fun try now then   read Paris Buffet took top honors breakfast   30 minute wait but didn't mind much remembered bring book   overall impression buffet selection small moderate but quality tended high buffet   biggest criticism nothing hot only warm best   had *   Eggs Benedict   Fair English muffin good Canadian bacon eggs properly cooked  *   Croissant   Good buffet but nearly good Bouchon  *   Lyonnaise potatoes   Disappointing   Bland very little onion flavor  *   Country sausage   many ways link sausage any pancake house but done right   Very good flavor texture  *   Veal sausage onions   Smooth texture mild flavor executed nicely  *   Andouille grilled sausage   Short fat sausage chewy casing   Strong grilled flavor coarse slightly sweet slightly spicy  *   Smoked fish unknown type hard chewy strong smoky flavor salty  *   Pain au chocolat   OK bun but very little chocolat   Fair good  *   Cinnamon bun   Strong cinnamon flavor sweet  *   Nondescript cookie   Fair  *   Pastry   flat dense cakey pastry slivered almonds white icing   Inside layer marzipan   My overall impression bad buffet but worth money  <EOR> The only thing impresses buffet speediness moving thru line   alot food options however am never impressed taste quality   eat since part buffet pass 24 hours   would prefer food RIO buffet  <EOR> I impressed quantity food appetizing all selection did impress whatsoever  Everything else mediocre however leave place bloated yet satisfied  place while decent good people say is  <EOR> Uh buffet actually kind disappointing  loved french themed food creme brule french onion soup some other french delicacies  Unfortunately all other food pretty disappointing  Even creme brule okay   The best thing crepe making station  lady making crepes desired fruit topping want  lady unfortunately messed order gave cherries instead strawberries  blueberry cherries banana crepe topped powdered sugar nutella  pretty good    The potatoes really old soggy  vegetables  fresh all  compared buffet Planet Hollywood say buffet Planet Hollywood better even though does all french stuff buffet has  <EOR> Me girlfriend came Wednesday night use buffet buffets pass  arrived around 850pm  seemingly quite wait but wasn't bad could been  waited roughly 30mins  last call food drinks 1045  stopped making food assuming around 10  Unfortunately crab legs weren't getting replenished but made another buffet  = The food pretty good  tasted sat bit  don't blame them having fresh
