The menu straightforward steak seafood but often seen soup salad bar  menu describes fresh bountiful which would expect $16! They're just trying upsell into getting entree only $2 add entree  But show vegetarians some respect!   Sadly wasn't exactly fresh bountiful  lettuce selection romaine spinach plenty wilting action  rest vegetables okay but when start substandard greens your confidence hurt  left overall impression selections fresh   The breadbasket decent  first excited see pretzel bread but more ate more just tasted interesting dough    As soups clam chowder chicken noodle  clam chowder flavorful  think predominant spice rosemary  could wrong but powerful taste  liked but might everyone   Overall disappointed  Bobby seemed happy trout ginormous sweet potato literally 3x size normal one   honestly excited see $16 salad bar  visions grandeur but visit am thinking Jason's Deli deal century! <EOR> This place probably more 3 5 stars   wouldn't say its awesomely wonderful because quality just isn't other steakhouses other casinos   However massively inexpensive compared those steakhouses   truly bargain   Husband came before comedy show Bonkerz steak lobster special 24 99   came baked potato salad bar which insane amount food price   ordered sirloin medium rare came back medium but didn't really care   cooked well but wasn't massively tender sirloin special Ellis Island which preferred   However lobster tail real treat roasted perfectly   salad bar wonderful really filled it   clam chowder serve memorable   bread also very good   husband NY steak liked but walking around pain having salad bar before meal   meal came mac cheese which came really huge bowl could 2 3 people way much food   I wouldn't way probably equally good places Henderson area where live but before show meal very good   also take restaurant com certificates even bigger bargain  <EOR> PAN ROAST FTW!!!  In hard economic times still am able scrounge some money drive LA Vegas some Pan Roast   must eat vegas   Words cannot describe filling good thing is   shrimp lobster crab rice   what more ask asian?  I'd strongly recommend sharing dish 1 2 ppl   Its HUGE!  The service really good once you're seated   personally enjoy eating bar something just enhances overall experience   chef Bob pretty funny guy too   Really friendly  <EOR> Interior looks sad outdated fitting theme casino located in   Ordered surf turf which filet lobster   All entrees come trip soup salad bar few vegetables clam chowder   Soup really gritty should try wash clams better   When food came pretty obvious steak previously frozen texture dry although cooked medium rare   pretty sure steak only USDA Choice Select types any supermarket   price you'd really expect would Prime   Also lobster while large rubbery tough fresh juicy lobster which also expected   imagine field day Robert Irvine Gordon Ramsey would place tv shows   Its only saving grace service Oscar waiter attentive fast really friendly  <EOR>
