As mentioned above positive server Ashley  She nice offered many times something else eat made sure meal taken off bill  She wonderful sorry say hope she another job lined because there's no way restaurant Summerlin crowd  If want pricy chicken walk next door Cheesecake Factory Cajun Chicken Littles which know good  I would definitely again unless did complete overhaul food  I'd rather through Popeye's drive thru eat mess again  <EOR> Oh Huffman's really wanted you  But let's honest 2 stars giving more generous  being said daughter enjoyed shake people nice  Unfortunately  where positive ended   The location large well lit separated bar area middle sundae milkshake exciting buffet section then dining room  walk middle area order custom milkshake sundae anytime during your dinner charged your final bill  Nobody actually explained but ton questions multiple people did shake   Between 7 ordered 3 4 chicken meals yet all them seemed very similar same dry bland boneless fried chicken  chicken salad basic sandwich  But again chicken place flavorless juicy chicken?! Flavorless should word evening because felt way everything! mac cheese looked nothing pictures website person table enjoyed it  All sides bland! thing DID flavor soup overwhelmingly salty   I theory particular suite building cursed  Truly  few places great reputations potential came gone never succeeded here  think may plumbing when walk back towards restrooms sulfur smell very apparent! sure but just said Mixx mark words place won't long  <EOR> Great food great service!

Great place Boca park back!! <EOR> Had great expectations meal   Ordered chicken tenders 2 sides truffle fries 2 sides chicken noodle soup asked honey mustard ranch take order   Very friendly greeted multiple servers way counter place rather empty assuming maybe because still fairly new  Pay leave car check food first thing only side fries didn't end being truffle fries   Only side honey mustard side ranch  Went back made feel confused them when placing order nevertheless made another order truffle fries did no charge brought another ranch honey mustard  Got home eat wife first thing fries hard rock re heated grease vat no flavor them speak definitely no hint truffle flavor despite extra charge   bit disappointed wife both pretty big fans good truffle fries   Nonetheless chicken tenders     just flavorless   would argue chicken tenders seems cut near thigh leg breast cut all   Very greasy chucks grisly fat hanging spit mine pint neither finished eating fries chicken  The only reason 2 stars chicken noodle soup actually pretty tasty   better made way better in less 8 hours cooking but still would say tasteful filling   All all ended going Taco Bell having couple tacos fact all could force ourselves finish soup  <EOR> The server super fantastic really appreciate above beyond approach  But ultimately disappointed food  4 piece chicken dinner + 2 sides  upgraded pieces white meat additional $1  meal Cost $19 +$1 + $2 50   think little pricey 4 pieces chicken  sides Mac n Cheese corn casserole $2 50 upcharge corn casserole    Mac n Cheese probably worst ever had  honey mustard dipping sauce which seemed homemade straight mustard just hint sweet  really didn't it  corn casserole which freakin excited turned weird creamed corn not casserole all in opinion disappointed  But did eat 1 2 it  wasn't horrible just expected  did think freebie side coleslaw which happy but    coleslaw dry   Chicken better your average bar food  But Summerlin peeps I'd say still prefer blue ribbon fried chicken   Atmosphere decent  played Bruno Mars similar music whole time which liked   Oh during happy hour but never received happy hour menu ordered 2 lagunitias paid $8 each  Bummer b c hoping better happy hour price  <EOR> Stopped because wanted try them happy hour  Ordered fried zucchini obviously frozen fried  pizza wings wings came fries  pizza decent but wings super coated greasy  fries obviously frozen fried favor less  shocked if place still open 6 months now  employees nice courteous but food l <EOR> Dined dinner husband two young kids  restaurant pretty empty early but service still slow   Given still soft opening server didn't anything explain restaurant even mention happy hour asked if wanted cocktails  food very bland  2 piece chicken meal while very tender crisp just underwhelming flavor wise  mashed potatoes w gravy salty corn casserole prob best thing everything had   chicken waffles  waffles good but again chicken disappointing  12 piece chicken wings crispy but again bland  sauces all underwhelming  Huffman's sauce just thicker version Cane's chicken sauce but good  slightly pricey but unreasonable  high hopes going but pretty disappointed whole experience  Blue Ribbon chicken Downtown Summerlin or even Cane's better   I gave two stars since hope place better but won't back anytime soon  <EOR> Came lunch today Tuesday around 2 dead! But fine because great speedy service  Very friendly staff man making milkshakes enthusiastic accommodating    I order 3 piece jumbo chicken tenders signature sauce honey mustard ranch good! chicken tenders crispy crinkle cut fries best!!!   Definitely new chicken finger milkshake place! <EOR> Lots room improvement  Service okay  would describe food below average bar food  really sure kind clientele trying attract seems sports bar  supposedly family friendly but must walk through smoking bar non smoking family area  could smell cigarette smoke during most meal  Even if could nail chicken which haven't most sides average inedible  Seems cutting corners sides   As food goes     Fried Pickles spears I prefer chips but breading good pleasantly surprised   2 piece Fried Chicken Asked leg breast but received leg thigh  No bone thigh strange   Brine good making chicken juicy but breading seasoned well seemed overly greasy as if fryer wasn't hot enough    Mac Cheese Cold flavorless did eat  Boxed Kraft better   Wings Average good   Fries Pretty sure frozen crinkle fries bag    edible but good   Cole Slaw bad need seasoning salt pepper vinegar  Tasted mostly cabbage mixed mayo   We might give another chance few months if reviews improve but need some MAJOR changes compete plethora dining options available  <EOR> I'm only giving three stars because bartender  He saved night made experience tolerable  specifically came Golden Knights watch party  But apparently no restaurant working knew anything it  website said specials beers burgers pizza  When tried order those didn't know talking take information owner five minute discussion order approved   I'd really see location succeed since nothing lasted since Gordon Biersch business  Maybe adding some signage outside letting people know what's going they're showing Golden Knights games! specials!   I saw another couple come wearing Golden Knights gear looked menu left because menu didn't say anything specials advertising website social media sites   That totally fault management anyone working there  <EOR> We original drove over Boca Park area eat Honey Salt but saw sign Huffman's decided them try! support newly opening business fingers crossed I'd picked winner   really impressed exterior building dining area clean  Sadly  all impressed with  While service good never server tell thank coming many times  upward 20 times no joke  appreciate positive vibes just much much next guys starting much!
