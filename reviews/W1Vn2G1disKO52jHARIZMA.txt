If haven't while think should definitely rediscover because service food pretty awesome chain restaurant! <EOR> I've coming CPK ever since first opened which when Town Square first opened  Granted don't often but off  usually friends family  typically prefer location over Fashion Show Mall only because hate venturing towards direction strip  only but location bigger    However don't single memory exceptional service establishment  once amount odd years around  fact remember time when friends no came table LONG while not even drink orders did do? Build fort menus  know immature but funny thing didn't attention    I just recently came back dine establishment family being away Las Vegas three years gotta say    service certainly hasn't improved  gotta admit busy used but still took LONG while any server acknowledge existence seated  nothing wrong hostess but something wrong waitresses  think took long ANOTHER waitress wasn't waitress came take orders because no else helped us  Which caused little confusion later when food arrived    Other everything else fine  food happy campers    Speaking food pretty point  pretty good  favorite bolognese pasta  Sometimes ask them spicy which add pepper flakes pasta  Always turns yummy  garlic cream fettuccine also another favorite mine but sometimes flavor so so  Oh tiramisu never disappoints Not bad place  fabulous place  Still great eat family friends when want some CPK  Gotta patience though  <EOR> Went last night husbands anniversary  Kevin waited patient helpful  wine food dessert all amazing   Thank Kevin  <EOR> This best California pizza kitchen  twice fashion show good  location perfect  time Candance server she great also great kids  She knows menu  <EOR> The pizzas delicious usually order pick noticed you're ordering  different location gets transferred restaurant computers constantly freezing you're trying order takes while them transfer your order restaurant when tell order going ready certain time takes 20 minutes time   think really need update system easier customers employees  <EOR> This favorite places salads  sucker good salad certainly them here  Although wasn't made right location still favorites   love Roasted vegetable salad Salmon BBQ Chicken salad  <EOR> Tried use no stars but wouldn't let me  4 min wait seated place only 1 2 full  worst part stopped selling Mountain Dew!
