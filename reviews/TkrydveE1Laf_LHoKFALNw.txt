Perfect Hunan food! most traditional ever met US!!! Really hot spicy!!! <EOR> I've couple times both times good experience   tried cumin lamb excellent young chow fried rice good although wish included another type meat addition shrimp such pork    would recommend trying some authentic Chinese dishes asking waitress owner recommendations   lots spicy dishes menu some non spicy well  <EOR> Food ok  average best  dishes dry taste   The owner lady try over charge each dish when pointed she tried play dumb she didn't know  googled restaurant online other customers same experiences overcharging restaurant  buyer beware ! Just watch your bill check every item's price if go  I'd other restaurants next time many other choices area  <EOR> My first time really expensive meat fresh taste just Hunan style food!!! bad <EOR> Food tastes good here  But be careful charge higher price shown menu  charge steam rice? Everywhere else rice comes dishes  price relatively high would say  <EOR> This place truly wonderful great chineese  food great price if spicy youll treat  <EOR> I give zero point if exists  Bad food below average  ordered two dishes tasted exactly same!! Food fresh either  Don't seriously! <EOR> Yuck  could barely find anything menu wanted order  waitress annoying kind offensive  When complained made dishes spicy simply said drink more water! eat more rice! Umm     restaurants supposed do  love spicy food does rest family but asked food little spicy definitely not  dishes waitress recommended weren't even good    What waste meal money! Don't choose restaurant  plenty better ones around  <EOR> Excellent   If spicy place AUTHENTIC Hunan food!  Closest real Chinese tasted Las Vegas   Some staff limited English but worth it   Spicy lamb eggplant very good  <EOR> Don't know where bad reviews coming here  Just ate again DH passed through way back L A  while service perfect it seems though English first language most people work service staff polite exceptionally attentive  came quickly take order brought food promptly helped pack leftovers   even brought tea watermelon before took order! did ask refill water  but all things considered minor   The food again amazing  time string beans spicy eggplant both great ample portions well spiced  more ask for?
