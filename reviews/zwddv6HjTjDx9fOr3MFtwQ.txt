I am surprised low ratings  am big fan pico de gallo  am actually pretty picky when comes Mexican food  fajitas very good  only deduction slightly slow service  <EOR> The food good but service horrible!!!  sitting 20mins before asked wanted drink   food took 40 mins two waiters just very chaotic asked if doing okay mid meal hour before actually eat   nonetheless food good prices fair  <EOR> Don't bother eating Quesadilla Restaurant located Imperial Palace Hotel Las Vegas   food tasteless bland forgettable   Very disappointed! <EOR> I wasn't really bothered when host sat also turned server   really didn't phase when order came two different times four minutes apart   can't say chapped ass when realized server host hadn't introduced himself nor seemed concern himself asking food until dining experience nearly complete   party hungry waited half joint open 4PM   just finished having great time lots laughs Jeff Civillico's Comedy Action show   all great mood   little stuff wasn't really bothering party   However food did arrive taste buds left wanting something some taste began feel disappointed   further excruciating when wait undo amount time check   Then once check arrived rest party left table wait outside Quesadilla's   Meanwhile five plus minutes later server host clearly nice smile but zero service skills finally retrieved credit card could finally put Quesadilla bland food behind me   In retrospect mulling over bland taste sizzling chicken fajitas see why host server decided ask food until passed lips found way toward gullets   understand places Quesadilla's require need build local base excellent service tasty food but would nice see effort   Tourists beware if want something much more delicious may want Yelp around bit before entering particular joint! <EOR> The QUAD former IMPERIAL Palace Hotel Las Vegas Strip really some poor casual dining options  5th floor two restaurants Korean Chinese Japanese serves Mexican Southwestern  having dined Asian restaurant decided give place try since stayed QUAD long hard work day didn't feel heading dinner  Service friendly but food hit miss  Drinks pretty good strong  frozen margaritas good but some 'over frozen' meaning difficult drink if off straw  Food bad inexpensive amount food get  Appetizers Entree portions careful!!

Beans cheese chicken  cost 10 dollars    He never came over check took forever check  think heard talked once during 40 minutes there  <EOR> Quesadilla located 5th floor Imperial Palace Hotel Casino nothing more spectacular say average Hooters  They're almost same kind restaurant too  Both women wearing very little waiting emphasis cleavage but very little emphasis making food remotely pleasing  Unless some kind voucher gives free food severely discounted food least then should probably check places different hotels  There's lot better options hearing    Unfortunately paid everything  signing bill waitress moves down expose cleavage some more  understand vibe restaurant but wow almost wanted take away some tip write in  weren't most flattering tatas first place  Definitely sexy sorry  Anyhow bought half chicken entree forgot name but some fancy name baja shrimp quesadilla  Neither them any real distinct flavor tasting severely bland restaurant's name  <EOR> This place terrible   The food very bland service very slow  Also servers dressed lingerie but no means sexy  Spend money your time elsewhere  <EOR> I came Saturday night Girlfriend craving Mexican food  I should known better   Being Los Angeles Mexican am very picky when come Mexican food always compare Grandma moms mex food    First came ambiance weird nothing Mexican culture except low rider bike ceiling maybe cooks   2nd waiter nice provided salsa chips  Salsa nasty tasteless   3rd asked waiter Carnitas plate he highly recommend it  girlfriend steak nachos going something simpler can't mess Nachos     We'll let say Carnitas awful nachos sucked  would rather eaten Taco Bell  Probably better off  Man upset  asked speak manager  manager Asian decent nothing wrong but here's reason why said asked wrong  said food sir good all cannot take another bite  He said its authentic mexican food  Really???? He rude just didn't care concerns just took girlfriends nachos off bill  just did want argue pointless issue  If want better mexican food would suggest eating off strip where locals go  <EOR> Located 5th floor Imperial Palace Hotel Quesadilla looks mix between Chili's Acapulco except much lower quality food lacks own bar  share 2 other restaurants   Food 1 5 stars The carne asada carnitas meat both dry tasted cardboard  rice bland think only reason added plate take room plate well your stomach if tolerate taste   If they're going serve dry food should courtesy giving refills waters   Service 3 5 stars Nothing spectacular  weren't really friendly didn't check us  <EOR>
