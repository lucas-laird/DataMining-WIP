Oh found why short order! First wait drive through kind ridiculous  just sitting line cars but once I'd placed order sat window quite awhile waiting food ready  When you're hungry hurry  best thing  called fast food reason right? Apparently here   Ok food obtained  home settled open mini chicken quesadilla  HELL THIS? First all cheese melted barely unrwrap aluminum foil  Once open   my stomach lurched  pile BURNED gooey mess foil absolutely disgusting  can't believe anyone thought good idea pass off food serve anyone  took and posted picture but straight into garbage   The chalupa luckily good shape only reason wouldn't ZERO star review  other fact can't award zero stars    Obviously won't returning  <EOR> I location dinner family  bill came $32  When home spread food family found order complete  missing two chicken soft tacos children  left family eat dinner drove all way back restaurant  10 minutes away  asked manager told missing  She said she remembered order but more interested placing blame  She made food literally said here  sorry anything else  food cold when home everyone else eaten except children me  Thanks ruining dinner  shall report district office tomorrow  <EOR> This place great! Food inexpensive but very good!  always thru drive thru fast employees always very nice never seem errors  usually grab breakfast burrito way work  especially enjoy hot fresh coffee!  employees seem take pride they're doing always experience better  <EOR> I am really confused something simple straightforward single burrito messed but thank Taco Bell succeeded doing just that  ordered protein burrito fresco style without rice  window only asked if wanted rice bowl which confusedly respond didn't order bowl but if burrito rice   then no don't want   waited 5 more minutes second person come window asked if two orders  Uh no    but would single order waiting only look bag front shove direction  let's recap   I ordered protein chicken burrito 10 minutes later received burrito nothing but tomatoes lettuce beans   Great job guys   the only thing more frustrating your obvious confusion construct burrito knowing wasted 10 mins life money only still something somewhere else  <EOR> Y'all want ten $ hour but don't even understand concept granulated sugar does iced coffee  Common sense common huh?  let put game  Sugar MELT cold beverage   you use SYRUP!  ordering Taco Bell    heading Starbucks now   Tacos bomb though  <EOR> I location being cleanly   used bathroom even easy here   Today happy $2 89 queserito being burned   tasted awful  boyfriend new chicken chips he said crunchy surface delicious   Carmel apple empandas dessert which put better mood   knew should Brazilian place instead same Plaza    <EOR> Just left Taco Bell 15 minutes ago incorrect order  only service slow but when called let manager Mark know order incorrect he insisted drive all way back store meal replaced  course let's honest many people actually keep receipts fast food? asked coming next day he suggested keep food so? Let's clear principal why don't eat fast food places  Half ass food orders along half ass customer service people    <EOR> Stopped lunch yesterday  Typical Taco Bell  Nothing special   Food okay  <EOR> One healthier choices lunch eats Fresco Burrito Supreme Steak 330 Calories 8g Fat Fresco Burrito Supreme Chicken 340 Calories 8g Fat Fresco Crunchy Tacos Beef 150 Calories 8g Fat Cinnamon Twists 170 Calories 7g Fat  It's easy wallet too! <EOR> Worst Taco Bell ever  Waiting least 20 minutes now  Watched several people behind orders  told forgot order then told order cleared  order would thought made 1st graders  <EOR> Solid place   always order correct   Service ok   expected   Don't quite understand some other reviewers would expect Taco Bell drive thru attendant   Take place serve food jerks all day see would act  <EOR> I recently quick bite eat location   usual      Bean Burrito 7 Layer Burrito   Order accurate   Place clean   Food ok   It's Taco Bell    not much say   Will return?

Restaurant nearby  Dining area clean restroom clean staff friendly most time    Return visits? All time! <EOR> I hardly ever review fast food places but location fast fresh clean super friendly!! only grip really craving Dr  Pepper! Shucks  <EOR> Embarrassed admit ate something Taco Bell am health nut  *BUT* guys drive through window cracked food chose really good  very unusual Taco Bell especially second time less 3 days    The 1st time ordered RAVENOUS asked if anything healthy vegetarian Chris manager recommended Cantina Veggie Bowl cilantro sauce guac side  really good! Reminds naked vegetarian burrito Qdoba Black beans some rice lettuce corn salsa pico de gallo cilantro green sauce  Very tasty  manager cracked when he saw Bears jersey talking Chicago because he too  Very nice guy    Came back today bowl again quite good looked online nutritional information if  don't eat guac cilantro sauce cut lot those calories fat  two guys window friendly until em started poking fun Bears losing Packers  Hmph! <EOR> Taste good always  Staff amazingly polite but some reason barely any meet double xl challupa box    All going thru mind just spent over 6 bucks still hungry    stick del taco down street satisfaction when craving tacos    Plus taco shells fell apart way easily    felt cheap    two stars     both staff because fault    <EOR> Very disappointed place  ordered chicken chalupa crunch wrap supreme but really stopped curiosity try new nacho fries    17 minutes food very busy  Chalupa wrap ok fries beyond awful  appears cooked enough fries entire second shift early afternoon literally stacks upon stacks precooked bagged fries piled piece equipment behind counter  fries room temperature best chilly here!  Needless say won't try them again  <EOR> I love location when order food thought right but manger explained order which completely understood  going leave food start but manger still made food way wanted even though don't it  Thank that  night seems fun manger definitely team player  <EOR> The cashier wasn't friendly  service slow   food standard Taco Bell though  <EOR> Pretty brutal just through drive thru window wound leaving part order missing I discovered once already home   called main number which answered twentieth ring simply hello   confirming Taco Bell young man said hold manager   Then another young voice entered into earshot said man hang up! Why did answer ?   phone promptly hung without comment  Then rang over over no answer still     Went today replacement order called again next day told come name list fix order  ordering man window stepped aside let 50 ish Woman chastise having receipt   When called earlier man spoke took name order number said give name window  No receipt asked other order number   She actual told she would give FREE food but come again expecting   explained male manager Saturday told come she responded didn't any men location  downhill there  isn't free food way if pay don't put bag   Here's picture customer service criminal talked tonight    I showed all calls phone she still nasty   <EOR> Terrible customer service even fast food standards  Drive thru advertised open til 1 am  Arrived 1250 order bacon club chalupa  advised could item any longer night because the fryers already cleaned drained night unacceptable start closing things early before restaurant drive thru closes  employee duty Mark thought completely acceptable close fryers before restaurant closed  Plan reach locations GM well corporate  <EOR> They pretty much order wrong everytime!!!
