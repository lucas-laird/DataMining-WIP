No thanks  He ended comping drinks actually made table two never came bill still close $200  all left hidden pizza place across hall  would suggest avoiding place all costs just throwing your money away slot machine  <EOR> I high hopes restaurant reading reviews hearing friends but afraid say disappoints  say cocktail great but highlight  ordered 4 dishes all mediocre best  atmosphere fun kind clubby loud  room dark but good ambiance  Severs great accommodating   Food fell very flat  endless options Las Vegas won't return  <EOR> One best meals long time!

Starts gander through pawn shop  While some elegant items novelty should wear off relatively quickly  wants buy something pawn shop prior going dinner? INtriguing?  Enticing?  Elegant interior design throughout! Nice bar but very small    It opening very overstaffed  feels bit bizarre because no room kitchen staff stand around  just camp your tables   Service impeccable reason!  Appetizers spot delicious but pork chops very chewy fatty send them back   manager fabulous though very apologetic brought tenderloin die sliced thin cooked perfection   back  <EOR> I tried give place 3 chances because love New York City however service 2 ambiance upbeat fun but nothing STK   came birthday last week drinks always empty waitress wasn't anything over top just existing didn't enhance experience free birthday shot give away embarrassing Dennys gives more buying $3 99 hot cakes spent well over $1k root beer float shot half person   Food good but entire experience didn't quality food   even encounter manger disappointing birthday surprise he Jesse Woods think name could care less   He definitely didn't care if came back won't!

Other menu items worth mentioning poke wonton tacos yellowtail sashimi avocado toast grilled cheese smoked bacon tomato soup dumplings broccolini scallops charred corn last but least strawberry shortcake bars!   This definitely good spot fill food drinks before going marquee   Minus star because ambiance liveliness isn't cool NYC location  <EOR> This place all show no go   First enter through pawn shop  cute concept but really irrelevant restaurant experience   The interior super dark very loud  great place romantic encounters  More party groups   The menu all over place  Italian Asian Seafood Steak works  lack focus shows food unfortunately   We ordered following Grilled cheese bacon tomato soup dumpling WTF this? good mix flavors all  only ordered because server it   Short rib mac cheese actually would've pretty good if could've found more 2 pieces short rib it   Spaghettini disaster  pasta way overcooked just drowned flavorless pesto  literally took bite each left rest   Filet mignon Ordered medium rare medium medium well  Since last entree ordered over experience already decided send back   Cloud Nine Smores overly sweet  some inexplicable blue streak plate if smurf left skid marks it  strange  dish waiter actually asked when told sweet kind enough take off bill   Overall very disappointing experience never back  <EOR> Amazing food spectacular service  moment cup full!

Wtf  would prefer being spoken rude manner 18 year old heels when trying nice dinner semi pricey restaurant    The female server didn't even tell anything menu ready order well   no sitting 4 minutes  looking some inspiration suggestion perhaps    but nothing  asked wine greeted blank stare  resorted asking neighboring tables meals suggested  chose few things hoping something great but none really hit home worked well  Just uninspired basic dishes  just trying jerk but pretty weak despondent service made much worse    From point repeatedly underwhelmed food literally hungry  Elote corn scallops? Baja style fish tacos? most un flavorful Brussel sprouts ?? direction menu meant be? all over the place    We didn't finish single dish cleared away without question  just couple martinis hoped dessert would save meal  helpful root beer floats but didn't weak rest everything else was    To worse server disappeared nearly half hour eventually chase down guy suit earpiece just check  Terrible  know things happen but c'mon  place packed could check could just leave    This fail say least  room cool decor fun  90's inspired music track cool vibe but service absolutely terrible food basic  Seriously    No read care kids think good good continue support blandness because no idea good anymore  around $100 head would hope least very good  REALLY  great    Let's hope better experience   Happy Eating! <EOR> The food place freaking phenomenal!

While dined DOCG next door saw large groups well dressed people walk into pawn shop never return!
