great fresh fruit juice  carne asada burritos best  homemade fresh salsa everyday  homemade tortilla chips  can't prices  <EOR> Inexpensive great food  Awesome burritos  <EOR> I came first month ago looking tacos admit tacos delightful flavorful pricey  But theres only downside place restaurant smells straight bathrooms sewer lines all fucked time open front door time left swear whole restaurant stinks bad suggest if eat order because wouldn't want eat place smells bad <EOR> 2 1 2  stars very mediocre Mexican food no flavor salsa way mild never thought Mexican food could bland   This place closes midnight weekdays 2am weekends   Really bad neighborhood don't dark! <EOR> I've place several times same experience occurs every time  Food good but employees always seem just don't want your business  business hours listed online correct always close early  Forget calling pick order  take phone order which taken lady barely speak English but don't respect customers enough food before there  don't food until pay no matter  calling pointless because still wait same amount time when there  just funny way run business  still continue because food down street house but customer service NO BUENO! <EOR> The amount random taco shops Vegas quite daunting  Usually shredded beef safe bet initial visit because might always best but less chance fatty meat appearing say Carne Asada  Anyway ordered three $1 25 tacos beef actually really flavorful stuff loaded onto double corn tortillas grilled few peppers tomatoes unusual   no sauce top but cilantro chopped onions topped off tacos  really put alot beef them three last awhile especially if load cold radishes not green kinda spicy carrots  Red green salsa traditional  Almost five stars but walls kinda dirty next booth  Still great lunch 4 bucks  <EOR> UPDATE 3 3 10 Recently back tried chicken quesadilla ceviche tostada   Both excellent! Serving sizes generous food quality way above average   Still highly recommended! <EOR> Las Vegas why no good taco shops?
