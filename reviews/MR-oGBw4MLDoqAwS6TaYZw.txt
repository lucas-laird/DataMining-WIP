$8 burger MICROWAVED! Seriously bun lettuce HOT 1 2 cheese stuck paper  Dave rolling grave <EOR> Love chocolate frosties  Other places imitations but Wendy's real deal  love dip salty fries dessert! Ive never bad experience  location clean provides quick service  Theyve never screwed order  come all time  frosty best dessert! <EOR> The main reason Wendy's burgers  meat taste actual hamburgers  if myself hamburgers  talking ground beef!!! Chili good too  Value menu decent items well  Gave 4 stars cause don't inside usually same thing  double w cheese healthy option side salad combo  <EOR> Under slice very cold cheese very dried overcooked miniature patty   Staff manager Jorge very rude   happened Wendy's?  Used very good hamburgers well anymore   Don't waste your money  <EOR> Wendy's general top national chains  incredible chicken sandwiches especially spicy ones more pricey burgers borderline gourmet  Some burgers reach upwards 7 dollars tax but worth money quality you'd expect pricey restaurant  Even cheaper burgers great quality all ingredients   As location    some downsides some upsides   Many reviewers point flaws fries being cold burgers being dry    surprised reviews until recently when different time then normally do   I usually 10PM later quick lunch break   Recently afternoon noticed fries cold hard burger put together rather sloppily   As drive thru performance I usually use method they're usually extremely quick food your car demeanor employees usually positive   It seems afternoon shifters bit shoddy  I'd recommend going hours maybe give early mornings try  <EOR> I stopped location before  very disappointed last two times tried giving another chance  chili visit less then 2 weeks ago hot daughter done meal before could even eat mine without burning mouth  Now tonight fries even cook all way  Really!!! hard that? <EOR> I used work manager 20 years ago boy gone down hill! remember when cook hamburgers always few grill even when slow customer doesn't wait  Once grill awhile put holding pan use chili  almost rancid grease smell pan but once boiled down tastes fine virtually grease less  Once hits pan should never served   We 3 00 afternoon ordered 5 single combos  Three five tasted took them chili meat pan other two tasted ok although dry  Did only two burgers grill and overcooked ? Did take other three chili meat holding pan? guess never know sure  never complained restaurant manager but did email corporate  never heard back them   Avoid fast food but   AVOID PLACE ALL COST! <EOR> Waited 15 minutes counter nobody helping me  People back yelling eachother  Finally just walked out  live across street but everyone neighborhood avoids place  Now know why  <EOR> This store deserves zero! taco salad home realized gave No chili no sour cream  called 3 times no answered course! back car back down store   inside told them forgot give chili sour cream  best part   told Oh yeah ran chili Really?! no big deal!!
