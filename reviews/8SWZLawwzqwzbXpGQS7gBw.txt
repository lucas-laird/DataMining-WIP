Hostess late restaurant late opening half order finished    Waited 20 mins rest   server incredible tried best anything happy but food worth wait ! Incredible fresh over cooked   probably second best thing Delano offer bathhouse being first   <EOR> Went breakfast while Vegas conference  Food average best but service worst EVER experienced  Restaurant full but waited more 15 minutes before hailed hostess request service  manager happened walk took order without apology  Waiter finally came but manager taken order  tea never arrived  When asked again glass put down hard splashed  Once finished no came remove plate ask first bill  Then ask them take credit card  never left tip but morning left  Tip $0  never back <EOR> First time being food delicious  smoked pork eggs Benedict huevos rancheros  Great portions taste immaculate   I always pay close attention Customer service treatment top notch  return again much food which delicious but more hospitality services  Thank great experience  Definitely recommend <EOR> They lose star charging $ 50 water telling when asked water   didn't  ask bottled water didn't say all offer excellent filtered water compliment excellent food 50 cent charge   No told charge mentioned menu really? would happy remove bill don't waste time 50 cents    instead writing much enjoyed Blue Crab Benedict a lot writing sneaked in 50 cent charge water without telling first   might calculate 50 cents extra profit worth risk customer satisfaction mediocre review   is    <EOR> The BEST eggs Benedict Ive ever Blue Crab Benedict  Huge chunks blue fin crab brie ! roasted tomatoes spinach mornay sauce over toasted brioche !   Don't walk  RUN  super fast service  All farm table taste difference  <EOR> Really enjoyed food Dellas  hash excellent girls loved French toast custard pancakes  also did well both poached over easy eggs  Good family meals  <EOR> If you're staying anywhere near Mandalay Bay come Della's brunch!   Like another reviewer mentioned ask Jason expect friendly quick attentive service  bacon confit stuff dreams I'd come back alone  Also sugary doughssants constant water coffee refills  must vegas  <EOR> Chicken hash sourdough toast much needed coffee! Very delicious pleasant service  Refilled coffee quickly timely food service fast checkout  Would stop again! <EOR> I love handpressed juices ! ordered Kale Ceasar  Did know would lettuce well no cheese but parmesan Vinegar sauce well  Overall salad good but definitely try something else menu  love seating arrangement place french toast also delicious! should try if happen come dine breakfast  only open breakfast probably brunch but  all man packed ! <EOR> Petty quick seated happy that  thought might take some time but quick efficient getting seated  manager very personable   Interesting Menu  Crab Benedict  pictures yelp looked great  Crab cake good however really really strong fishy smell  Anytime strong fishy smell worried  Luckily didn't sick  Still food tasted ok   Girlfriend pancakes liked them  <EOR> Hands down favorite meal anniversary trip Vegas   waiter great  He offered complimentary juice shots split omelet two plates share without having ask   DELICIOUS lemmon poppy pancakes!!!  Highly recommend! <EOR> Very disappointed! waited 40 minutes food come out  Other people come same time received food before us  asked see manager he tried explain why taking long just then food came burnt!! wish would taken picture it  Rather rectify situation both waiter manager gave excuses why looked way example  way peppered maple bacon looks! honestly think waiter forgot food then reheated  walked Caesars!! <EOR> I really enjoyed huevos rancheros  Hunny did care eggs Benedict  upscale organic eatery  Quiet  No bothered us  <EOR> We ate since close hotel however disappointed because super expensive costed $35 per person  French toast peach supposed cream but didn't n $20 n canned peaches  blue crab Benedict good but $24 really? Service good water smelled horrible food way overpriced was <EOR> A little late review  first breakfast choice Vegas Superbowl weekend well worth walk drizzling rain  Bloody mary delicious meals breakfast burrito Della's Breakfast  Service pleasant both server manager happy hear abouth high Yelp star rating  <EOR> Fake farm table food call fork table   supposed mean? fork table? proud CORN fed beef  potatoes fried some nasty aftertaste cheap oil  service really slow  $6 25 double espresso   50 cup distilled water  Give break  disguised corporate restaurant typical crappy food conscientious place cares  Don't fooled save your money  <EOR> During stay Delano breakfasts Della's Kitchen gotta note atmosphere place very cozy  Unlike most restaurants where waiters wear all black white guys wear denim outfits which both cool fresh  design along yellowish lighting want overstay your breakfast just sit there    Nowadays restaurants only put sign above entrance date establishment caring anything else thinking would attract more clients just saying 10 20 years business    Well believe year business but better almost any historic diner town  <EOR> I've always great experience French Toast but first time trying found really dry if did take time prepare despite amount time wait prepared  bread tasted stale  coming again  Two stars cause waiter polite food presentation nice  <EOR> Came morning anniversary started things off wrong foot   waited hour some pretty basic menu items while tables around came left never consulted waiter  even came saw empty table multiple times disbelief returned kitchen  Finally approached complimentary fruit tray because wait just time sate hunger simultaneously spoil appetite ordered  When food came chicken waffles turkey club rather basic tasting  Moral story if want spend $20 per person brunch elsewhere unless want fruit tray Della's  come pretty fast  <EOR> If staying Delano Mandalay should your place breakfast quick bite  omelette  Nothing ordinary here  made exactly wanted it  Butternut squash grits though world    Service 5 5 Food 4 5 Ambience 3 5 <EOR> Great food very attentive staff  very polite refilled coffee often <EOR> Very high quality dishes but pay steep price   We would also eat Della's when stay Delano   Great dishes include Custard pancakes Pasta dish Delano Burger Chicken waffles Country fried steak cornbread fantastic when available  We've never 'bad' dish    also hand ketchup jams  <EOR> @Della's Kitchen event breakfast great Delano Breakfast very filling great portions  Customer Service below average waitress never came check trying much once very rushed  <EOR> Very good breakfast  omelette chicken mushroom   delicious hash browns great too  Would definitely back  <EOR> We came mid morning time some brunch  we're greeted host seated promptly  waitress Melissa  came immediately  asking wanted drink  She didn't seem patient rush  ordered drinks  She wasn't really pleasant either  No real smile greeting  When teas arrived she just left didn't inform orange juice ordered he little way  10 min waiting asked she passed she said 'it's way' direct slightly rude way she passed my  Didn't even wait listen  don't know rush about   thr restaurant wasnt even busy  husband felt uncomfortable cos didn't expect type service response hotel restaurant  orange juice really sour when arrived  add sugar it  food arrived another waiter  waitress never once asked during dine if needed anything food was  hunt down other waiters extra utensils waters  She didn't even come until we're done food   Service 2 10 main reason rating  gonna give star but food n venue we're still nice  Food 8  Venue 8 Price overpriced   Won't come back if service stays same  would rather spend money elsewhere better dinning experience  <EOR> I think bit   Initial reaction rate two stars but decided completely fair   thing take into account when reviewing balance place against establishments   But things all places share common service preparation food expected atmosphere cleanliness   Della's clean no wait actually spotlessly clean   Della's semi captured customer base   really but if want grab quick bite eat while staying Delano also extremely convenient where end up     I ordered simple meal oatmeal coffee water   Easy enough   oatmeal overcooked lacking bite steel cut oatmeal which reason most order steel cut oatmeal    Asked water twice did receive   Asked coffee refill twice   Cup refilled second request   happens when place busy however five diners   So while initial reaction rate two stars but give benefit doubt assume just off day server kitchen   give Della's another try update review  <EOR> A very nice clean venue but hostess servers acted bothering them  party four ordered two Cubano sandwiches beef panini club sandwich  very little meat Cubano sandwiches panini cold cheese even melted  sent back asking put back into press little longer  When brought back obvious microwaved resulting rubbery bread    The server never asked meal was  charged $21 $23 each sandwiches fifty cents each water    Very disappointed! <EOR> I love Della's kitchen! hit place Sunday brunch surprisingly much people  environment quiet lovely   server very nice except she forgot need soy milk coffee   The food delicious especially toast! ordered chicken confit yummy! <EOR> Stayed Mandalay bay convenient come down stairs breakfast ordered chicken waffles felt waffles tasted something missing chicken way sweet  <EOR> Della's great choice if you're staying Luxor Mandalay Bay    only healthier options found fair price  lemon poppy see side pancake  which huge pancake $4! omelets really fresh good well opted gruyere + spinach + mushrooms mushrooms best part    Considering price  actually thought portions would smaller but portions more enough everything tasted really fresh healthy   I definitely recommend spot good breakfast lunch spot! <EOR> Great comfort food start long day walking Strip  served Jason attentive polite throughout meal    Pork benedict biscuit gravy chicken waffles girlfriend  pork benedict excellent just way eggs benny should made  Highly recommended any benedict fan! biscuits gravy okay  gravy perfect but wasn't enough overpowering dryness biscuit  Left last few bites because no more gravy sure he'll wasn't gonna put sawdust mouth without assistance  I'd say I'd drink water help but charge it  Charge  For  Water  Serious? Aria doesn't Bardot guys ain't Bardot  Still great service overall good meal marred only slightly  Would come back just different menu choices <EOR> We ended eating breakfast twice Della's Kitchen find turned be!!!  Not wanting waste 1 hour commuting Bouchon breakfast elected stroll around hotel complex see looked interesting   lucky happenstance passed Della's  They open only breakfast lunch but serve both menus whole time they're open   1st morning custard pancakes w vanilla butter soft custardy name implied    hit table fact Sis sweet person chose them day 2 breakfast saying something!  Also chose Belgian waffle w lavender butter strong lavender but soapy another winner!  Mr veggie frittata he loving eggs mixed w quinoa   Provided unique texture flavor layer     and let's just say ALL own sauces   Ketchup homemade strawberry jam hot sauce boot   tried them all during 2 visits only could tell homemade but scrumptious!  Day 2 Mr dying try Truffled Pappardelle w mushrooms asparagus peas   ingredients simple but flavor incredible  Before Day 2 breakfast brought treated homemade cornbread w homemade jam slightly sweet lots corn flavor could 12 more each Then offered roung freshly pressed juices kale celery apple mix orange pineapple ginger mix   Both outstanding  After made complete piggies ourselves waiting check comes complimentary homemade granola bars w dark chocolate dried fruits quinoa oats  waiter says show off    perfect little bite fab ending lovely 2 meals       this destination spot sure!

Everything fresh delicious service also excellent  most certainly return sample some other breakfast items  <EOR> Pancakes good french toast good  Expensive such little portions  $13 3 pancakes think  $18 scrambled eggs mushroom spinach  toast side 3 potato chips  Super dry very hard small  scrambled eggs very plain absolutely nothing it  order bacon side little more protein never delivered  food took forever think waited least half hour ordering  Felt hour  Server brought food disappeared  Never ever checked again never chance ask bacon  She dropped bill off left  Again flag down another server tell tell server billed bacon never received  Anyway think would better off walking down way getting some pastries Starbucks saving $40  <EOR> Second time Della's waited over hour order sit order but once ordered   asked several service team members talk manager dismissed ignored them  Once did talk manager surprise surprise food did come looked terrible pepper bacon burnt potatoes dry also burnt   back! plan writing negative review Mlife account! <EOR> Yummy 3rd Power!! Girlfriends breakfast club!! loved food!!! See why? Crab Eggs Brie sun dried tomato Benedict Burrito Avocado Pancakes Chicken Waffles Hash Stuff some kinda special bacon mimosa tea coffee!! Excellent service Ambience!! 12 plus twins!! <EOR> It very difficult ruin breakfast but Della's delivered that  worst meals ever had  Coffee tasted cheap  breakfast sandwich looked slid off plate but caught time  Hash brown potatoes no flavor  homemade ketchup tasted tomato paste  Very weird  Hubby breakfast burrito  Came side half green sliced tomatoes  Why would serve that?!?! DO RECOMMEND NEVER eat again <EOR> Great farm to table style place  menu outstanding  breakfast lunch served all day   I Delano Breakfast which offers eggs toast bacon sausage choice potatoes fruit    Scrambled eggs Perfectly done smooth but runny charred  Maple pepper bacon Really good crisp  pepper overshadows flavor meat though  Hash browns awesome because tasted fresh  weren't greasy most hash browns assuming place cooks them healthy oils vegetable oil butter  Wheat toast big piece which well toasted guess  hard fuck toast  Cold pressed juice Kale pineapple cucumber celery ginger lemon  Money!  This place also charged 50 cents distilled water  tastes great if distillation process ends being environmentally friendly then 50 cents small price pay  see people critique price  Paying water something may feel odd now but probably going become normalized coming decade s   <EOR> I love farm table concept Dellas! don't see often ESPECIALLY strip amazing!   We kept light breakfast 1 order lemon yogurt house made granola w dried fruit 1 order steel cut oats   Lemon yogurt die but really small portion  granola very good well    gave more granola vs  yogurt which opinion seemed little backwards   Steel cut oats extremely basic seemed oats some brown sugar milk side  Nothing fancy all   The toast huge! Good tasting bread    just little over cooked little hard bite into   Their coffee tasted delicious but definitely worth $5 50 per cup afraid even ask refill chances being another $5 50   SERVICE TERRIBLE  Main reason docking stars review  Hostess waitress seemed neither them wanted there  However food came quickly assuming because easy put together order   Overall would again if staying t Mandalay Bay but would way it  <EOR> Great breakfast place!!!

Anyways ordered special sandwiches offering something similar philly cheesesteak ran $19  worth it? Absolutely not    wasn't impressed very least but hungry partner already complained awful chicken Panini menu which also cost around $18 believe  thing if going charge ball park prices mediocre ass dishes least them delicious! Once complained manager experience he did due diligence tried rectify situation however still left bad taste mouth   No pun intended   return? Well   if MLife puts more food beverage credits account sure but other wouldn't spend own coins here   <EOR> Our Delano hotel room came 2 FREE breakfasts $30 place  churro waffle turned very good especially expresso cream  fresh pressed pineapple juice perfect  also side caramelized onion hash basically hash browns crispy both sides tasted awesome    On other hand personally would spend $17 + $7 25 + $5 all those myself  Since came hotel definitely worth!! <EOR> We Vegas quick business trip  colleagues knew Chef Jay came over breakfast way town  easily best meal Vegas  farm table restaurant attention detail all dishes superb    I ordered Huevos Rancheros perfect  steak tender salsa favorable  service personable quick    You butter jelly  AMAZING!!   I'm sure why restaurant only 3 5 stars? pricy $21 breakfast but worth it! <EOR> Della's good but probably worth walk made MGM   If you're looking want into Mandalay Bay walk just past Michael Jackson theater   This place if you're hurry though   girlfriend starving she ordered side asked brought soon possible   arrived maybe five minutes before rest meals   Our server largely absent water glasses running very low before anyone came around refill   I ordered chicken waffles   decent but nothing mind blowing   think would liked chicken crispy outside   pretty smooth mild tasting   I might back Della's since setting nice food pleasant if remarkable   Just sure lot time because servers won't really check you  <EOR> My lady greeted warm welcome Hostess seated promptly   came Sunday brunch able talk Chef Jay over few recommendations since don't eat pork red meat   recommendations blue crab Benedict grilled chicken hash Churro waffle   Everything tasted different but delicious nutritious way   ingredients high quality food flavorful    Make sure try churro waffle   Thanks Chef Jay great overall experience <EOR> I loved farm table concept Della's which why tried twice disappointing initial experience  ordered breakfast through room service Delano which created Della's meal bland luke warm  breakfast again yesterday morning even worse  service slow neglectful  ordered omelet flavorful   and meat actually seemed quite fatty  potatoes side completely cold  Overall great expectations experience quite bummer  <EOR> The Delano new fashion forward young edgy addition Vegas  Most everyone recommend Della's Kitchen Delano hotel clean health conscious restaurant         I guess said because place three juices menu??  I ordered customizable omelet spinach chicken goat cheese side  only alluring menu item polenta croutons  Yes they're probably unhealthy carb heavy oily   but bite didn't kill me   The food overrated should negotiable price  <EOR> Best farm to table brunch Vegas! Worth every penny  device amazing very knowledgeable menu  Great coffee  try hot sauce!!! <EOR> Food lacked seasoning poached eggs overdone overpriced get  Service decent  <EOR> This good restaurant breakfast lunch Delano Las Vegas  foods American mix Mexican very nice  Good service too  But some time foods slow  <EOR> Personally wasn't impressed brunch options around Luxor  LUCKILY found gem  food great  Portuguese sausage hash browns know entire party enjoyed food too  only reason I'd give four stars because difficult time making reservation  link website did work each number listed restaurant incorrect  Fortunately although restaurant filling able accommodate party 8 brunch  <EOR> One best finds Mandalay Bay  Clean options home made feel such whipped butter house made jam home made bread which amazing  House made catsup hot sauce omelet  Kinda slow service because they're busy food came cold  <EOR> Good breakfast place outside Delano  busy convention goers sitting chatting clogs tables but food comes fast  <EOR> Food very good but prices outrageous service slow when Monday morning   portion sizes adequate but don't think food much better breakfast buffet Mandalay Bay worth   pretty classy place though if paying someone else's money want convenient nice place reasonable option  <EOR> Walking into Dellas kitchen very high hopes maybe why underwhelmed? decor five star beautiful clean  However when seated host walked extremely slow which guess better fast but felt if she didn't care  Right off bat getting five star experience waiter either  He did give enough time slight rude  food all ordered just meh nothing special either   I am very upset just because heard great things service amazing food perception high expectations  maybe caught them bad day but don't think back give them another try! <EOR> The staff disappointment lacked professionalism would expect resort Delano Mandalay   two girls host desk rude ghetto terms way communicating customers   clear ok but just observing way interacted other customers embarrassing   addition communication style hilarious see describing customers sign sheets   did would know look call sea waiting people   But if going utilize tactic least use it   When calling name looking another individual did look anything wore any clothing resembled wearing freaking hilarious   Now wonder notes jot down me   With all said above unfortunately still endorse restaurant   food pretty damn delicious probably staples regular visits Vegas     1  Portuguese Sausage Pastrami Hash damn good your eye balls roll backwards   wouldn't mind just laying bed eating all day   2  Della's Breakfast bacon strips soggy soft causing little chewy but tasty   3  French Toast liked lot because bread middle soggy some places but fluffy   Although say received does resemble photos   No pecan raisins no caramelized banana no coconut butter   4  Club Sandwich panini bread wasn't hard appears  good  Turkey little dry but good sandwich overall avocado nice addition offset slight dryness turkey  5   Water charge 50 cents per person water   Umm why?

We left full happy stomachs although little lighter pockets since vegas inside hotel food wasn't cheap but prices extravagant wasn't worth splurge little bit    A must try if you're staying Mandalay Bay hotels!  PS Going early key because place only open breakfast lunch brunch wait if during peak hours  <EOR> Great food  Great service  hot chocolate split custard pancakes daughter  Victor server wonderful  Took good care us  order pancakes enough both us  Neither able finish portion  <EOR> Well let start off saying hate having right review since Delia's kitchen amazing  food particular server fantastic she does     reason review being posted based very bad attitude just encountered front desk seating host   Mind eaten restaurant many times never encountered anything took surprise  walked 9 30 restaurant packed matter fact pretty empty asked myself mom seated     women front desk plainly looked dead face said no seating anyone 45 minutes but raffles cafe mandalay bay   I looked confused asked because guys busy wait? don't understand  Then she reiterated same thing again    No seating anyone 45 minutes Mandalay bay  Again asked wait? guys busy cause  case wait  closing early today?

Serving sizes aren't impressive but prices certainly jaw dropper  Expect spend $20 even if you're super hungry   Check picture menu uploaded  Even water a nominal fee $ 75 cents which server immediately waved once asked if could non 75 cent water     That being said food absolutely delicious  ordered Portuguese Hash particularly enjoyed sausage while red onions Brussel sprouts delicious well  made in house hot sauce divine    Highly recommend if you've few extra dollars spend but sure reservation if you've party more 4! <EOR> Della's hidden gem between Delano Mandalay Bay Hotel  offer wide array menu options healthy farm style cooking scrambles omelets classics fried chicken waffles   We both breakfast skillets spinach mushroom feta option which amazing   He cheddar bacon option which he inhaled assuming good   The place clean quaint trendy farm inspired decor  both big fans ceramic cups plates food presentation   The prices responsible Vegas even more considering Delano restaurant which generally speaking aren't faint heart   Honestly only reason we're issuing higher rating because service spotty best flag down waiter regular basis regular service items water refills   This review strictly based breakfast  <EOR> They don't open til 6 30am  I know because 6 15   Waiting 15 minutes no big deal   second person seated still waiting breakfast 7am while everyone else happily eating   waitress said made your omelette regular eggs instead egg whites re doing  said OK no problem but ordered scramble omelette  She excused herself check  Scrambles favorite hoping she just misspoken    She returned few minutes later omelette cut trying pass scramble   ordered still ate but wasn't happy   long wait unapologetic service $18 dollar omelette didn't order  won't back  <EOR> I wanted love since conveniently located Delano where staying  didn't even care overpriced think $5 25 cup regular coffee $18 regular breakfast burrito because hey right no brainer hotel guests  can't even give two stars even though service good quick  food ordered breakfast burrito Delano breakfast absolutely no taste  bland  don't think grain salt used any other flavorings  No salsa burrito few very sad looking slices avocado  don't think ever disappointing breakfast Las Vegas but complete waste $58  Hopefully turn around  <EOR> This place amazing! ate breakfast every morning stay never disappointed  husband pork Benedict two egg breakfast  potatoes good! toast bit hard around edges but good otherwise  morning glass fresh orange juice delicious lavender berry tea believe called  Love little restaurant! must try if you're staying Delano! <EOR> When walked into cafe whispered boyfriends ear won't able eat anything  Turns accommodated being vegan!!

Also charged 50 cents water  two stars servers  meal forgettable but pricing not  elsewhere Mandalay Bay Delano better value  <EOR> First time definitely return! Pastrami hash eggs Crab Benedict pancakes just incredible <EOR> Della's Kitchen fresh farm table goodness! chicken waffles all amazing  chicken breast seasoned well lightly breaded waffle fluffy light  also experienced great service lots smiles! <EOR> Absolutely best breakfast spots ever eaten at   Before even looking food choices recommend ordering bloody mary  Bloody Mary's made heirloom tomatoes super refreshing  fiance dined every morning stay we'd wake early head gym then straight Della's cocktail breakfast   made order omelette's excellent  When staying Delano Manadlay place must! <EOR> Spent night Delano decided use meal credits morning breakfast Christmas  basically seated right away  I Dutch apple French toast Granello Bakery cinnamon raisin brioche bourbon custard cinnamon spiced apple compote house made granola vanilla crème anglaise   really good!! wasn't best French toast ever but full flavor  cinnamon spiced apple compote absolutely delicious  not sweet but just sweet enough cinnamon y apple y autumnal flavor  thought granola nice touch too!! never seen granola put French toast   and in house!! brioche seemed different types raisins apples top dish cooked well nice texture flavor them  believe rotate type French toast according seasonal produce  We also Blue crab benedict artisan brie spinach roasted tomato blue crab mornay toasted brioche country style Portuguese hash Portuguese sausage red onion red bliss potatoes charred brussels sprouts two farm eggs   tried some benedict OH CRAB absolutely delicious!! usually don't eggs benedict because REALLY don't hollandaise sauce think usually overpowers everything but really liked used brie instead!! crab nice flavorful eggs good too  cheese didn't prominent flavor over rest dish  Smother all over some salsa in house and   *drools* AHHH!! brother wasn't super impressed hash  I order breakfast burrito wherever see but decided against since saw don't add potatoes theirs  NO POTATOES BREAKFAST BURRITO???????  They bring still water but if ask they'll give sparkling same type carafe  thought sparkling water kinda tasted like   the ocean first  Really salty     Bottom line Delicious food!!

Breakfast always starts cup coffee took interest Ethiopian brew   Very light aromatic which perfect Vegas morning   coffee never below half monitored intensely friendly servers     In addition coffee tried juice   few flavors but favorite choice carrot pineapple ginger!  Very fresh good you     The berries started organic farm California Chef personally visited handpick ingredients   topped home made vanilla bean spec cream perfectly cold blackberry blueberry strawberry combo     I ordered Portuguese Hash eggs over easy   hash home made spicy sausage greasy your typical hash    eggs perfectly cooked hashbrowns crispy outside hot inside   chicken sausage spicy sausage cooked perfection includes all grass fed beef ingredients staff site   Did mention grow all own vegetables greenhouse back parking lot???  There's reason why staff arrives 0500 hour half before opens     Here attention detail sets restaurant aside   ketchup all things favorite items   ketchup home made very smooth texture taste freshness tomatoes   Somebody mentioned hot sauce issue previous review   don't listen them   soon food arrived bottle home made hot sauce arrived food   prove all pictures!  stop writing because pictures worth thousand words they'll speak themselves   and yes water 50 cents but cleanest tasting water because filtration system taste amazing!  ordered many dishes write them all but returning highly recommend too!
