I've eyeing place couple weeks each time stop Greenland Supermarket   decided give try today     The dining room sparsely decorated pretty clean probably nothing would deviate you'd expect any other typical pho joint   thing noticed booths really wide just case you're really wide person    190lb frame swimming space between backrest edge table  Anyway     I quickly seated handed menu   looked over decided wanted then closed placed table   few minutes later service came over took order large special pho #11 spring rolls regular iced tea   order figured would give baseline which judge experience   Withing few minutes spring rolls iced tea like strong lipton green came out   rolls served peanut sauce nicely garnished grated carrot radish?    Standard fair think    pork inside roll prominent flavor over any shrimp present   greens fresh peanut sauce good   At point started noticing small array condiments table big bottle sriracha bottle Lee Kum Kee Hoisin sauce 2 3 empty dish ground chili paste two types red rose colored vinegar soy sauce   fact noticing table because pho wasn't yet      Actually starting think forgotten about   probably close 10 minutes until came out    long ass time compared other pho shops used going where front within couple minutes ordering it   The fresh condiment plate seen nicer basil leaves kind bruised wilted looking probably came near bottom basket   Thai cilantro lump bean sprouts sliced pepper wedge lime all looked fine   The pho broth sweet side very fragrant clear oily all nearly still simmering   Meat lovers your place!  guessing close full pound protein bowl   nice chunk tendon couple bites tripe     probably eight slices rare steak good portion brisket fatty flank  Oh meatball too  fairly hungry but couldn't finish all   Personally would liked better balance between noodles beef but surely appreciated generosity     Other delay getting pho service very attentive   asked twice meal going iced tea refilled regularly hot chili oil provided promptly upon asking   noticed service also very kind helpful some other people less familiar Viet menus    always nice see   When check came just over $10!  forgotten sign front offering 10% off grand opening   accept credit debit cards which nice   Overall gotta give place strong review if four stars very solid three 1 2   some details need some attention but surely appreciate quality to value ratio friendly service   hope new place does well location   Give try  <EOR> Fresh Fresh Fresh ingrdients brought back again again  this place just opened three times 1 week  great food  Really love BBQ Pork rice noodles fresh coconut juice  Yumyumyum  <EOR> I also stopped Sunday everyone seemed liking place much   raving cleanliness place   Agreed   also commenting great service nice staff 10% off check   Check check check!  Freshness ingredients   Great!  However would really disagree flavor food  1   Pho Tai KEY thing pho soup broth beefy all   What's pho without beef flavor?  Maybe  why soup clear?  No traces essence beef bones inherent bombastic bowl Pho   noodles standard rice noodle   sure wrong but seemed under cook just tad   Preference all good me   slices beef sliced little thicker compared pho kim long pho 1 pho saigon 8   Again guess part all preference   Visually also looked different usual restaurant bowl pho did finely chopped cilantro green onions   Instead long strips green onion soup lacked fragrant smell combination cilantro beef  2   Cha Gio Egg rolls egg rolls seemed deep fried old oil indicated overly brown egg roll skin   Also think filling missing few ingredients made lack texture added another interesting taro   missing jicama?  Lack cloud ear fungus yes digusting sounding but usually part egg roll filling vermicelli?  shrimp?  Luckily when wrapped fresh veggies doused plenty nouc cham edible  3   Cafe Sua Da Vietnamese iced coffee crack coffee   Usually can't screw good   Conclusion really really want give place high number stars because great service clean environment but give low rating because low quality food   would give another chance because really liked staff service   Perhaps place Bamboo Bistro where pho but other dishes? <EOR> I am no pho expert but place rocks!  decided try seeing Cindy D 's review I need try Matt's spots though    only pho couple times life don't lot compare but think Pho Village does great job   I ordered shrimp wraps chicken which HUGE appetizer   no idea going large wouldn't ordered admittedly filled much fully enjoy pho    waiter explained eat it he must read blank stare face when he brought plate dry shrimp wraps huge plate veggies chicken noodles hot bowl water   he explained all worked thoroughly enjoyed appetizer!  slightly sweet fresh veggies meat   Very yummy #5 menu      For pho ordered #27   believe 'special combination' something something sorry lack detail!    pork two small shrimps piece imitation crab couple pieces squid fish balls   said came egg but didn't notice any egg mine   added little bit hot chili sauce enjoyed half pho before being conquered full belly   Again all fresh ingredients tasty broth     The waiter gave free little cup tapioca taro coconut milk dessert   loved but just full eat it!  Next time forgo appetizer   just much! <EOR> Awesome!!  We happened find place opening day today worth drive we're North Vegas   lunch  food excellent plentiful restaurant clean beautiful service well they're still learning but they're very courteous  bet they'll hang waiting guests within week  As today cash only probably waiting credit card machine husband small budget  decided share entree thank goodness did  appetizer meatball wraps huge! thought just getting two wraps but instead plate paper wrap them huge plate meatballs noodles huge stack greens including fresh herbs cilantro thai mint? something else   entree equally fresh BBQ pork rice spring rolls bed fresh greens other veggies  Everything tasted wonderful! also tried some exotic though non alcoholic drinks made something lychee like smoothy type drink  Both great  All total $19 + change  We plan coming back often possible  <EOR> Love love beef watercress salad #9   pho very good too   Although food came very slowly last two times around 430pm only customer   took 25mins pho come out   lady very nice   thing big fan there's very strong smell not just usual pho smell when step into place   service also very slow unattentive   best server mexican guy   order same things everytime pho without tripe but there's tripe every single time time tendon missing   don't really mind though   if u don't care service much hurry place bad  <EOR> Technically would give place 3 5  lunch day said good  thai iced tea overly sweet which nice change  ordered two appetizers Banh Xeo Chao Tom Cuon  Banh Xeo made perfectly shrimp pork which salty  Chao Tom Cuon favorite    who resist some rice noodles shrimp cakes? ordered Pho Tai all impressed maybe fact full stuffing face appetizers but felt lacked flavor  would definitely eat again though  only criticism food all came quickly no room table  put Pho Condiments bench next me  rushing eat leave  However felt redeemed themselves gave aunt cup filled Vietnamese bean drink  She said she always gets when she there  guess nice remember her  think overall place good beats driving down Spring Mountain all crazy Asian drivers  <EOR> The best Pho Vegas now! PhoQueen Lily D  right place   The first thing noticed noodles actually some flavors noodle  No other place Vegas tasted did notice this  really stood me  broth very good well but still could better  But flavors noodle forgivable    As half way done through bowl noticed included  ngò gai culantro mom calls fresh smelling vegetables I  prefer aromatic vegetable over basil any day  favorite vegetables add food since just everything taste smell better  only place Vegas far tried this! guess restaurants exclude keep cost down  give Pho Village credit including this   The banh xeo came perfectly  Golden crispy yellow  didn't bean sprout crazy Hue Thai but filled good portions meat  coming back when craving banh xeo   The only disappointing dish cha gio egg roll   couldn't put finger exactly wrong it  oil fried in? filling sure  But just didn't taste right  Maybe bad batch maybe secret ingredient taro  root  Likely won't ordering again   Like most Asian restaurants very little no service  place isn't exactly nicest cleanest place but its forgivable  flag off waiters if needed anything  nice plus served hot tea instead just water  10% off meal sure why  no didn't flash Yelp badge!   Pho Village pays close attention detail which sets apart being another Vietnamese restaurant  definitely place return to  <EOR> Our fellow yelpers raving Pho Village Korean Plaza marketplace decided give place go!   First thing notice matching furniture creates nice zen like environment right off bat   looks spent few more dollars furniture   also open kitchen atmosphere actually take peak things being made   good sign since restaurant willing show off kitchen must confident it!  Started off #4  Cha Gio 4 Vietnamese fried eggrolls $5 50    restaurants give greens wrap your eggroll up   Plenty lettuce mint other stuff quite complete   did take awhile come barely chance wrap when main entrees arrived   Husband said he could see pan frying which could explain why took longer   result though stayed hot longer since put egg roll down work pho still quite hot when around it   I standard #11  Pho Dac Biet Special combo rare slices steak well done brisket flank tendon tripe beef balls rice noodle  Small $5 95 Husband said broth tasted more 'perfumey' other places   just noticed only piece beef ball soup   The Husband wanted staple #28  Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho Beef stew egg noodle $6 50 but evening   He settled #32  Com Ga Hai Nam Hai Nam style chicken served seasonal rice $7 50 which something usually get   First off definitely looked and tasted lot better Pho Little Saigon's Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant's versions   give lot rice dish perhaps much since end eating all  decent but better  Then again always hard compare dish when you've homemade!  But keep looking nonetheless  Overall Pho Village good experience overall   real test when Husband gets test version beef stew though!   3 5 stars  <EOR> I hungry today shaking but needed home grab takeout    I #35 which broken rice plate marinated pork slices baked egg shredded pork    I rushed off into Greenland while order being cooked came back fairly quickly surprised meal done already  Two people presume owners told didn't shredded pork apologized told put more sliced pork   and gave Sprite can  thought pleasant cute gave drink    When home destroyed food  Sure hungry but ate fast because good  pork nice balance flavors super juicy soft  egg bake yum  fish sauce bit more vinegary some other places but works really well meats  If good lukewarm then sure delicious fresh hot restaurant  great portion $7 51 including tax   it's good deal    I back sure! always Greenland very glad stopped some food today  <EOR> Phoget know pho least if know pho laden cloves complex sweetness  Traditionally anticipate when sit down bowl pho but Pho Village stumbled across something different but it  If onions think you'll too    First regardless broth noodles slurpable masterpieces  Usually when eat pho am sick tired noodles half way through bowl start wondering if ever eat pho again  Village  noodles actually more square shape never soggy heavy    Now broth  chocked full onion bits resulting flavor more savory sweet  Honestly very little complexity experienced other broths but flavor enticing its own way  If want proof come watch scarf down bowl without hesitating! pho finish never happens other pho establishments    Lastly but most importantly serve mean veggie pho  Yes veggie broth but beef broth veggie acoutrement  A+ greenage tofu  include broccoli which gold or should say green standard vegetable inclusion     The place scrubbed down bone bleach regular basis  witnessed it  did grubby glass once but happens best them  service nice  Pho Village win! <EOR> So brunch fam before heading back home Orange County   location past little Las Vegas Chinatown area same street   Plenty parking since huge sort shopping center guess   located very end it   found hilarious Drive Thru Pick sign side building because don't think actually drive thru   Anyways place clean pretty high tech equipment pho place   never seen pho place touch screen computers place orders but hey  just me   I forget number menu but ordered  vermicelli noodles egg rolls bbq beef cucumber slices shredded lettuce all yummy side accessories comes most Vietnamese meals nice cup freshly squeezed so said orange juice   Haha no complaints it   good starving drinking all night empty stomach   came huge bowl very filling gave enough energy drive home     *edit* Vietnamese name meal called bun thit nuong cha gio  From rest family said enjoyed meals most part well three cousins didn't because meals weren't served way wanted it   ordered same thing certain specifications meals but server didn't right just dealt got     The thing hated place service TERRIBLE!  cousins didn't meal til almost very end!
