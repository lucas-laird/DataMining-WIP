casual without being casual  round glass room which need reservations best night  See lights Downtown watch Freemont Street Experience show every half hour  fits perfectly whole Downtown revitalization vibe     One star off   the plates good could more them  really skimp times no sense considering price tag  Also wrong server blow experience being slow knowing menu  decent servers

<EOR> We ate Firefly Paradise during last visit Las Vegas decided try new downtown location time   When parked car bit put off because Plaza hotel pretty run down   The setting Firefly Bistro however kind atrium overlooking downtown light show   We great service Firefly veteran she said she restaurant 5 years enjoyed choices bacon wrapped dates beef mushroom kebabs parmesan frites chicken salad    only regret eaten large lunch buffets damned weren't hungry dinner couldn't try more items such lemon tarts enjoyed much last visit    Firefly great tapas bar kitschy downtown location worth visit   If time your visit see light show would recommend ask view table  <EOR> Finally made downtown Firefly location  Friday night reservations 6 30 party 4   HITS gazpacho delicious stuffed dates dates

quick greet take orders  Food came really quickly  actually would better if spaced dishes little more could enjoy two three dishes time hang longer  think all dishes except desserts within 30 minutes which made quick dinner  waitress always around asking food refilling glasses  never refill sangria all night   good service   The mussels bad only ate send back  Ferrin cool apologizing taste taking off table more importantly taking off check  She made few good suggestions alternate dishes quickly brought new dish ordered it   As other reviews mentioned atmosphere cool  glass dome overlooking

Surf Turf Skewers Calamari probably best items menu Mojitos Sangria solid!

Fifty bucks before tip  shock  best meals Vegas cheapest  <EOR> Love atmosphere love food  restaurant dark uses dim lights candlelight give perfect setting great evening  Rich red colors used throughout restaurant reminds little DCR  friend started off Firefly fries which really good  also ordered lamb chops ahi tuna skewers filet minon sliders garlic shrimp several others slip mind right now  also two Mojitos which awesome  love mojitos would say found two places town which them very well  favorit still mojitos Abbey West Hollywood but when am stick Firefly  Although did pay bill estimate total between 50 75 dollars  little pricey but split between 2 more people isn't bad  love restaurant enclosed glass dome Plaza hotel very unique  recommend all location paradise never visit new downtown locations  <EOR> Went Firefly weekend trip Vegas  early around 5 30 pm restaurant basically empty  seated booth right window overlooking Fremont Street  a great spot see Fremont Street Experience! Low lighting added romantic setting beginning meal but time leaving packed loud  bad thing just different atmosphere when walked in   Meal started off complimentary olives bread side almond butter  Then ordered sausage plate patatas bravas ham cheese croquetas crispy duck rolls  heard duck rolls really delicious high hopes but wasn't impressed  Overall food good  Props extensive menu wish more appetite could tried other items   Service mediocre  waitress very friendly but service general pretty slow  worst part dining experience simply getting restaurant  There's no direct entrance Firefly trek through Plaza which seems pretty dumpy  <EOR> Happy Hour 1 27 10  Firefly Plaza 5 stars +++ This first experience Tapas Bar but won't last!!  Any tapas bar half good Firefly would GREAT   met friends bar   Try sweet sangria red white sangria marinated 3 days champagne   good   Friends said Mojitos excellent   Happy Hour 5 7pm ONLY bar   But any food menu available   bring each person sampler plate bleu cheese stuffed bacon wrapped date meatball layered pototo somethinganother  All three wonderful   ordered more stuffed dates pork empanadas chicken salad cheese spread sirloin mushroom skewers forgotten else but all terrific!  bartender friendy evening view Fremont Street Experience made memorable evening! want try everything thier menu   $38 00 exluding tip <EOR> One favorite places town  location's even better original  Great view great service great food great drinks  magical combination    I always bacon wrapped dates they're perfection  thoroughly enjoy shishito peppers lamb skewers well  haven't single dish haven't enjoyed here  Definitely favorite town! place great groups parties anniversaries birthdays any occasion really    I'd recommend making reservation larger parties especially weekends! <EOR> Hard rate Food 3 Service 4 Location 0 unless count cheese factor then 5  Pitcher red sangria good Chicken salad much Bacon wrapped dates burnt bacon Stuffed peppers good Thai beef salad good Beet salad simple but very good Mac n cheese wrong cheese over pasta? Good Chicken chorizo stuffed mushrooms nasty Camarones Diabla favorite dish all due sauce Crispy duck roll ok but better covered Diabla sauce  The result definitely adventure  seeked place would refused come  Plaza Hotel run down getting restaurant through lobby confusing  Once inside view Freemont Street good  food better expected too  All all no place impress all 5 star celebrity chef over top dining experiences Las Vegas but there's something Firefly need see yourself    Hard say if ever back but glad went  should try once  <EOR>
