Edwin R friendly bough ask if wanted something drink which politely declined  drank lot tea all day   Anyway love decor  artist pick work art incorporated into all locations did great job   There plenty seats tables but maybe during lunch rush situation different   Parking lot small many open spots considering neighbors same plaza   Tonight tried large Zen Salmon based Poké bowl made Edamame lot Jalapeño Green Onion Orange Segments Orange Citrus Yuzu Sauce base Rice Noodles  just alright barely tasted Orange Citrus Yuhi Sauce overall tasted dry  caused combination adding enough sauce ordering Rice Noodle base experience fell short amazing last night  But being official  day 1 operation am going harsh but actually bit more generous rating  Just keep mind if Rice Noodle selected base ask staff more generous sauce since definitely absorb lot sauce leaving overall Poké bowl tasting bland dry   What's good? Fresh ingredients order made pretty fast healthy   I drop again few days check Buddha Bowl Sutra I am going pass tofu based Dharma which cater vegetarians possibly vegans amongst us    Okay  Back finishing Poké bowl which surprisingly filling compliment portion size considering normally orders two entrees just   <EOR> Great place Poke' food amazing come back more Matt man greeted us <EOR>
