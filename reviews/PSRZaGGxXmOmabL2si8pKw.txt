Perfect mom since she loves pecans   Overall I'd rate service 5 dessert 5 food 3   There's definitely better Italian food non chains but still terrible option  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  waiters great which guess deserves star but manager Lindsay she rude everyone staff  She obviously doesn't care employees which upsetting see because used job where manager very rude everyone working even though all worked hard could seeing manager act same way left bad taste mouth  hot don't turn AC which just going work summer heat  <EOR> Ate week ago great!
