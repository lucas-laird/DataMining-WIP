This place great location but unfortunately food way over priced charge undisclosed resort fee 5% aka CNF fee your check  Vegas local eats daily Ordred carne asada $23  received 4 small pieces meat two tortillas some guacamole  Javiers across street aria much better food bigger portions same price  extra fee charge ridiculous  No other restaurants strip add bartender no explanation why other value customer receives because it  If hadn't asked she would disclosed it  <EOR> Their burgers absolutely worth money garlic fries amazing upper deck location gorgeous  <EOR> Der Beer Park befindet sich direkt am Paris Hotel Casino über dem Hexx  Man nimmt entweder außen die Treppe nach oben oder innen den Aufzug   Wir waren am frühen Mittag direkt zur Öffnung dort  Die Bedienung und auch das Personal am Empfang hatte es wohl gar nicht eilig wir mussten nämlich ziemlich warten  Es lief zwar viel Personal herum z B  um die Tische mit Soßenträgern einzudecken aber wir wurden zunächst ignoriert obwohl noch gar keine anderen Gäste da waren  Wir bekamen dann einen Tisch zugewiesen und nach einer Weile kam dann tatsächlich auch eine Bedienung unseren Tisch  Von da gab es personaltechnisch nichts mehr zu meckern denn unsere Bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam  Wir hatten einen Burger einen Caesars Salat und ein Spezial Angebot mit Brisket  Anfangs saßen wir noch im Schatten später wanderte dieser dass wir halb der Sonne saßen  Tipp Bei heißen Sonnenwetter möglichst nah am Gebäude und nicht zur Straße hin sitzen   Zur Kühlung wurde dann die Wasserdampfanlage angemacht ich persönlich hasse diese Dinger die es leider inzwischen fast jeder Ecke am Strip gibt aber das ist wohl Geschmackssache  Zum Glück haben wir davon unserem Tisch nur wenig abbekommen    Wie man sich schon beim Namen denken kann ist die Hauptspezialität vom Beer Park Bier  Auch wenn der ganze Laden mit Budweiser gebrandet ist bekommt hier Biersorten aus aller Welt auch aus Deutschland    Tipp der Theke kann man kostenlos einzelne Biersorten probieren einfach nachfragen  Wir haben jedenfalls eine neue leckere Biersorte gefunden zufälligerweise sogar aus Las Vegas    Das Essen kam im normalen Zeitrahmen  Wichtig ist Wie schon erwähnt sind Biere die Hauptspezialität den Speisen kommt hier nur eine Nebenrolle zu   Sie werden serviert dass man sie am Tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur Plastikgeschirr  Der Burger war saftig und mittelmäßig lecker völlig okay aber nichts besonderes  Für den Preis auf jeden Fall zu teuer  Der Caesars Salat war lecker allerdings mit zu wenig Dressing ebenfalls zu teuer für den Preis  Das Brisket Spezial war lecker und wirklich reichlich der Preis war angemessen  Das Bier sehr lecker unverschämt teuer ein Glas für 11$   Der Ausblick auf den Strip geht auf die gegenüberliegenen Hotels  Die Fontänen vom Bellagio kann man nur sehen wenn man sich ganz aussen die Geländertische setzt dann sitzt man tagsüber allerdings der prallen Sonne  Man kann hier viele Spiele spielen die überall verteilt sind z B  Tischkicker Jenga usw    Außerdem wie üblich den meisten Bars Restaurants gibt es einige Fernseher meist mit Sportsendungen    Wir hatten hier einen Groupon Gutschein 16$ bezahlt für 40$ Wert Speisen Getränken   Es gab keine Probleme bei der Einlösung  Nun zur Rechnung     Es gibt Las Vegas eine Handvoll Läden die nehmen unverschämterweise eine Concession Fee Höhe von 4 7%  Es wird zwar auf der Karte darauf hingewiesen aber ziemlich klein einer Ecke  Okay wir wussten das vorher und hatten ja außerdem eine gute Ersparnis durch den Groupon Gutschein  Trotzdem empfinden wir diese Concession Fee als unverschämt vor allem da die Preise hier eh schon gesalzen sind   Fazit Wir würden hier nicht mehr hingehen  Wir fanden das Essen als zu teuer und nur zum Biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer  <EOR> Not good beer selection  food also great  waitress delivered wrong beer didn't know beers menu  won't again  <EOR> Visited second time very satisfied both food service   Customer service ideal location great selection IPA's keeps coming back  <EOR> I love location  view Bellagio water show spectacular  food pretty good well  But servers 8 months going FAIRLY OFTEN all seem don't want bothered  only time they're courteous when see know someone there  takes good service?

She being serious joking! Even if she joking funny  No feels laughing someone tells them going call police them  Especially getting drink  FYI   My boyfriend sober getting drink me  When manager came over  He showed no sign sympathy over situation  He said right refuse service anyone  He didn't apologize any attempt   agreed manager  refusing service when just  fault ignorant California ID's updates   suggested staff better training  Especially government issued identifications  also need keep updated any current updates government  issued ID's  bartenders jobs hard  ID someone charge pour     It's unfortunate lack staff training making facility loose patrons  Ignorance does okay them discriminate act unkindly  Especially spend more $500 food drinks  <EOR> Made reservation certain area full when arrived  Extremely slow service weren't busy  <EOR> Not impressed pictures looks fun but all pictures reveal difference person  games tucked away between tables out  Jenga only game table pool table really small clear back  decent selection beers sadly enough local beer tap  Food unique but bar food best  If would known would beer only  Maybe more card games tables such cards against humanity drunk stoned stupid games geared towards beer drinking putting large games floor instead tucking them away fit more tables would nice  <EOR> Absolutely worst customer service!

Fazit BeerPark no more!  Wir fanden das Essen zu teuer und nur zum Biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer  <EOR> Great spot great view   Staff super friendly manager Eric awesome   great beer menu food delicious  Try mac cheese rolls nachos Shock Top Brat  <EOR> If you're staying Paris even walking great place drink quick appetizer  deck misters great place cool down hot day! created Budweiser expect only Budweiser beers such shock top bud light hoegarden etc    Pros The fries pulled pork pretzel beer cheese delicious! <EOR> The beer way overpriced  Decent selection however    pulled pork sandwich because said slow smoked 12hrs jalapeño slaw   slaw regular single jalapeño slice top   pork dry very little smoke flavor   put BBQ sauce instead side very good definitely did compliment pork   also side Buffalo onion rings   Sounds could delish but failed badly   Instead blue cheese crumbles buffalo sauce drizzle them served ranch blue cheese side some kind crappy blue cheese dust them served side very good hot sauce   Much better places eat drink watch game place along strip  <EOR> Had great experience beer park!

Can't wait hang Super Bowl! Best views strip heart Las Vegas blvd great food awesome staff  excited bring friends  <EOR> Like many other reviewers think very cool spot great vibe  Good beer good food love games perfect location  But few other places decided trick customers attaching 4 7% 'fee' bill without clearly indicating anywhere  Clearly don't trust they're product good enough charge should add fee end when most people won't even see it  awful practice shows great disdain public  If want charge $18 drink fine people own decisions value  But adding fake charges bill ok  <EOR> Local muy bien puesto  Al aire libre en una planta alta en el Paris  Varias barras rectangulares amplias donde muchos bartenders atienden muy rápido tienen una variedad de cervezas muy copada  Los precios son un poco altos pero viene bien para salir un poco de las Corona Bud Light etc  que encontras en todos lados    Además de las barras hay mesas estandar tipo picnic y tambien sillones con mesas bajas para grupos grandes al fondo  Hay varios juegos de mesa dando vueltas incluido jenga gigante idóneo para cuando ya llevas unas cuantas cervezas y un par de mesas de pool   Corre bastante viento y veces hace frío pero por suerte tienen los típicos tubos estufa arriba que ayudan bastante    Si estas en los sillones del fondo podes ver lo lejos y escuchar la música de Chateau el nightclub del hotel Paris así que viene bien para ir mentalizandose ? <EOR> They add 4 57% charge bill cover overheads  Apparently $15 beer doesn't cover all costs  Bad business practice  <EOR> Came lunch watch MC v Everton match  Ordered 7 layer dip came very runny couldn't eat it  Pretzel ok best worst  big screen sitting top left quadrant misaligned almost blacked out    Barmaid pleasant but two lads helping behind bar seemed utterly miserable  Shame because really bar  We're local very disappointing      I've updated 4stars because relocated ourselves better spot music banging     Ha ha ha back down three stars asked cold glass we drinking Bud pitchers fella clearly irritated gives warm glass ask other fella ice cold glass! <EOR> This place JOKE! Yes nice looking yes great view Strip Bellagio Fountains but  folks!! Beers all owned ABINBEV though few craft beers available fall under ABINBEV Umbrella  And pay ridiculous price said beers then top Vendor Fee added well  WTF?

Concession Franchise Fee charges additional 4 7% NO REASON   nothing fee   Throughout Vegas majority restaurants charge BS fee but Beer Park DOES   It sucks because when actually bottle favorite beer which pretty hard find   come back?  No   favorite beer usually $11 bottle   Beer Park charged $27 same bottle    then slapped 4 7% fee NO reason   Make sure look very fine print see if your Vegas restaurant charges fee   find tiny writing menu   Then yourself favor don't attend restaurants     We all know expensive many Vegas restaurants anyway   secretly devious fee necessary?  No   Just resort fees having pay parking more way Las Vegas trying best steal every penny customers keep other tourists away   In addition boycotting fill trip advisor yelp review place   Post information Facebook Twitter tag them   Let company know doing unethical thieves should supported   bartenders' fault please don't take them   owners should reminded multiple times day much money they're losing every day when customers avoid establishment elsewhere beer   What's best way let them know?  Take second write something online   It's shame   Most customers don't even realize occurred until check given   PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILLS CAREFULLY    Ask manager   Let them know won't returning due fake fee   Cheers  <EOR> so nothing special        was expecting more variety tap since Beer Park       <EOR> Great place second time although don't remember first time because drunk birthday lol second time did fail all  If beer games cool hipster type vibe check place out  staff also great waitress spilled some beer wife manager quickly came told give discount bill  <EOR> Great view some fun tons beer!!!

Really?  CNF charge 4 7% exactly what?  single possible reason could ever justify ridiculous fee   Right sleazy resorts bending people over shoving butts ever popular resort fees     would bet anything 99% people don't even know sneaky fee tapped onto bill   Sure menu as pointed questioned smallest font possible never clear reason why   money grab simple that   Perhaps many 4 7% means nothing such small amount all   true small amount   principle behind it   If need more money then just tack onto cost food!  Just more way Strip chasing away locals   Which actually quite fine   Strip meant vacationers willing settle smoke mirrors Vegas   Regardless tacky sneaky fee wouldn't gone back just because mediocre food     As side note when home did some background search latest money grab   turns isn't only place Vegas pulling stunt   Cabo Wabo why would eat crap food beyond Hexx Kitchen cheap rip off real Senor Frog's all guilty shameless practice  <EOR> This place killin' me!
