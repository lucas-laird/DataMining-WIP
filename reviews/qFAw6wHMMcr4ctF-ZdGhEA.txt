If want great time ask Lyndsay your server  <EOR> Nice lady seated but all downhill there    WAY OVERPRICED!!!!  They charge $8 iced tea!!!!  So ordered diet Pepsi instead $4 thinking could choke down since Vegas hotel $4 standard albeit criminal        comes super tiny glass bottle diet Pepsi glass ice  didn't even know made glass bottles small  sent back    The linguini bolognese bland  Plus ordered spaghettini thin spaghetti instead linguini but linguini     Maybe  because guy didn't write anything down   He also didn't check despite walking 5 times place VERY small until half way through meals  He offered remake meals but said bother    Conclusion RIPOFF BLAND FOOD  ELSEWHERE  <EOR> Just finished eating okay   not impressed all  cute place but waiter unapproachable seemed annoyed every time asked something aka menu again etc    reading other reviews expecting amazing food service but very average good customer service  Oh garlic rolls weren't great others said  Wompssss!!! <EOR> Our server Reilly very sweet gave great advice  Reasonably priced very tasty  <EOR> We great attentive server  Lobster ravioli die for!

I made reservation Open Table Monday 5 30pm  arrived time table ready  other guests but wasn't busy understandable given early Monday   atmosphere kinda casual dressy white tablecloths cloth napkins but brightly lit open  children dining well kid friendly  think they'll even give kids crayons    The waiter VERY friendly funny! Made casual jokes but wasn't inappropriate anything that  He promptly brought water delicious buttery oily garlicky rolls! They're soft fluffy! There's olive oil balsamic dipping well  Mmm perfect way start meal  food came pretty quickly too  open kitchen see them preparing everything fresh!

Small tucked away restaurant Venetian great service engaging bartenders  <EOR> For last night Vegas looking something little cheap  roulette wheel kind us  Venetian website listed casual dining place $ price range seemed it'd perfect place    For two glasses wine some meatballs app two pasta dishes walked $90 poorer  When start approaching $100 range thinking decent place back home Federal Hill Providence North End Boston  While Trattoria Reggiano wasn't bad certainly wasn't worth it    It's small place some very crowded tables outside restaurant  quickly seated all atmosphere mall food court  end meal felt intimately knew couple side because could easily hear conversation well could hear own  Luckily small children other side extremely well behaved because being stuffed closed them potential disaster    The service ok but team four guys working place each four hand service  didn't set waiter  guys didn't talk took order mumbles gestures but rest guys nice enough    The small plate tortelini decent enough but nothing write home about  gnocci girlfriend drowning pesto wasn't homemade    We would've cheaper more enjoyable dinner Olive Garden  threw money away drunken sailors all week then picked bad time try searching inexpensive option  would've much better off dropping few extra bucks nicer place  <EOR> This place delicious! baked ziti meatballs  Very good!! Definitely recommend if feel Italian  <EOR> Great food but agree previous reviewer take plates clear table soon   feel rushed  small place could why   <EOR> This girlfriends spot when come down Vegas    The location little hidden but closest  entrance close Tao nightclub  doesn't nicest scenery but food come back    Since first time ate gotten lasagna dish every time come! girlfriend friend gotten other dishes such pastas fettuccini although said good said nothing rave about  But girlfriend decided lasagna last time came she said would dish now  She loved much! <EOR> This fancy restaurants see inside hotels Strip   restaurant itself super small might end seated outside restaurant aisle   if looking intimate romantic dinner place sure   But if just looking good Italian food reasonably priced then place you     My husband loved lobster ravioli liked dish too   dessert sweet taste but bet lot people it   Two pasta dishes dessert = $55 plus tip   service good    owner I am guessing he owner stands outside restaurant greeting people keeping eyes tables     This place bit hard find ask security guard direction when enter Venetian  <EOR> Fresh best Itailian food closest being Italy!!

Doesn't matter because once start eating wont saying anything except MmmMM  Probably best gnocchi ever pesto sauce watery thick  divine   I wish enough stomach room try desserts but good sized portions filled up   This place isn't cheap but worth it   So why didn't place 5 star rating?   The bread    I am queen carbs love breads   service bread looked would amazing  buttery golden brown parmesan   But actually fairly dense wasn't warm   sure if always serve bread but if bread hot soft place would merit five star rating  <EOR> If you're looking casual Italian good place go   really wish could complain more place because waiter messed order but wrong item he brought really good   Here's happened friends asked waiter he recommended pasta he suggested some kind pasta BOLOGnese ordered that   When he took order said also pasta BOLOGnese craving pasta   When orders came pasta dishes received something piled deep under green leaves   Turns he heard order Veal MILANese then he gave attitude it  Dude just recommended some bolognese stuff half table said would also that!

I first taken aback tiny restaurant is  Seriously could legitimately call hole wall because just small only seven tables inside handful tables outside mall walkway  turns sometimes best things come small packages!    When walked immediately seated served some fantastic bread! placed order started glass wine  Before could even finish first piece bread spaghetti meatballs already brought table! service place great!

Food ordered meatballs everyone raved acidic couldn't even 2 bits down before heart burn started   aren't hearty meat taste might imagine   made Filet Mignon just bland   Then Linguine Clams   water noodles starchy   stopped ordering those things paid bill pizza late night     I wish would gone buffet     <EOR> Good food great service   Vegas expensive if watching your dollars found place Yelp! allowing right decision eat vs other many Italian restaurants feel great value   VENUE SERVICE Cute restaurant server really friendly   right Venetian close everything made good pit stop   BREAD appreciated garlic knots even asked if wanted more but ordered enough food   MENU Lots choice prices reasonable  Big portions great if hungry great if take home leftovers  We both  We Meat balls Baked ziti Linguine bolognese  In hind site could baked ziti meat balls since sharing food  But if more two people appy 3 large meatballs   With all stuffed didn't try any dessert   AND BONUS for us     took home leftovers through two other meals  hotel kitchen able transform leftovers into second slightly different big meal some items picked local market   Awesome important good value!  Buon appetito! <EOR> Just okay made reservation 7 weekday night full when arrived  all shared filet mignon pork meatball ordered pesto gnocchi  Pesto sauce very creamy but flavorful gnocchi itself pretty good  meatball didn't taste special but quite chewy very tender  Complementary bread good especially olive oil vinegar  Price very high quantity though  <EOR> After perusing Yelp reviews Italian eateries Las Vegas hubby decided give place try recent trip there   pretty sure place money wine alcoholic beverages because all geared glass champagne until discovered only brand champagne carry price tag over $100 00 glass I believe actually $130 00! seem recall cheapest glass wine being somewhere vicinity $13 00!  O k  settled water cappaccino sp? dinner drink!    We ordered greens salad $13 00 gigantic plenty both share   entrees baked ziti $18 00 hubs ordered usual favorite lasagna same price    baked ziti very generous serving but lasagna looked kind lonely plate hubby downed remained entree devouring lasagna   both very very good but disappointed sauce which light pale almost pinkish color   thinking maybe vodka sauce pomodoro but waiter told mix ricotta into marinara sauce hence paler sauce   huge fan ricotta outside being contained ravioloi layering lasagna   prefer Italian sauce deep dark red rich took away dish but just own personal preference   large layers melted mozzarella covering baked ziti which delish!  Now best thing Trattoria Reggiano DESSERT!!  yes specific dessert that!  spelled C A N N O L I!!!  highlight dinner experience restaurant!  If eat simply MUST can't stress enough M U S T  indulge cannoli's!!!  Absolutelyo TO DIE FOR BEST cannoli ever acquaintance palate!!  Bostonian gal really saying something Bostonians take cannoli's VERY seriously just ask anyone if ever happen Boston!    several decades living west coast never yet experienced cannoli could compare way they're made east coast   But tell Trattoria Reggiano pure HEAVEN!!  No  1 huge   filled marscapone should few very few chocolate chips scattered throughout whipped cream top light drizzing  caramel syrup plate look fancy!  happy sharing hubby especially when he's never really cared cannoli's before!!  wanted glutton eat entire thing myself but decided nice!  Lastly bread also noteworthy   They're small roundish little knots bread buttery garlic topping   Very yummy!  The only thing prevented giving restaurant more stars fact wasn't crazy sauce but just own personal taste  <EOR> Amazing pastas  garlic knots huge awesome   we linguine frutti di mare linguine clams carbonara chicken parm  noodles cooked perfectly server real friendly attentive  looks expanding restaurant which even better  back next time Vegas  <EOR> Great place Italian  Nothing fancy all  all reviews state    tiny inside seating tables set along Grand Canal Shoppes between Venetian Palazzo  Wonderful bread oil start off with  Shared spaghetti meatballs carbonara  Next time Vegas craving carbs oil garlic cream    plan stop here! <EOR> Amanda super nice  After  comes best garlic rolls ever tasted!!!!We 2nd order I shrimp scampi which good And girl spaghetti meatballs which she enjoyed  <EOR> Found Yelp craving Italian food within walking distance Treasure island  place little hard find  Venetian but some signage would nice  If hit Palazzo Venetian you're going wrong way!  The place pretty small happy gotten seating Saturday evening  host seated super friendly server nice  Everyone helped sounded legitimately Italian  legit Italian faccent fake accent which good may real    Food bit pricier expected but really? dining strip    but good  start off garlic bread rolls  sure you're limiting many eat  come suffocate later when try fit more carb into your body  pastas come pretty large sizes tasty just want keep eating them  Don't  Trust when say box half your pasta  did just full while family finished theirs almost roll them car because full  may helped finished tiramisu which custard mixed ladyfingers served wine glass  Everything delicious  carbonara mom seafood fettuccine brother bolognese  All really tasty plentiful     One things would change place pricing but know hard complain pricing strip   Each pasta plate cost around $17 20+  other thing would point being able hear staff yelled at scolded since seated near kitchen  almost shameful staff face customers just scolded!  Otherwise food great service followed through  Give place try if you're area! <EOR> I specifically Yelp find Italian restaurant while Vegas   am shocked many fantastic reviews here   most people never real italian food off night because husband thoroughly disappointed   I carbona despite being made pancetta really needed salt!  husband spaghetti meatballs just ok   also kind difficult find   Sorry guys    <EOR> Loved place! Excellent service excellent food  bread rolls fantastic  highly recommend restaurant if looking good Italian food! <EOR> Fantastic quick service  food very good  Nothing more say EAT HERE! <EOR> Paolo Italian server amazing host towards dinner girlfriend last night  best shrimp scampi plate tried since plate Cesar salad sausage pizza which terrific well  come next visit good job guys! <EOR> I thought food good but especially noteworthy tough competition Vegas  carbonara authentic no cream but isn't best had  balsamic olive oils left tableside high quality  antipasto platter huge even half order would feed four people!   But entire experience marred awful service felt being Applebee's having waiter in training  When sat down menu barely presented when asked if wanted order he totally misread thought wanted fast service instead relaxing meal or else he just wanted table turnover   am able look past took time ordered when antipasto platter came substituted hard cheese fresh mozzarella which disappointing   When waiter finally reappeared asked he said well should shrugged walked away no offer fix even query kitchen explanation  He also never offered refill raved garlic knots didn't particularly need them given size platter but offer would nice appropriate   He also brought entrees prior appetizer platter being finished poor timing himself kitchen again expecting fast turnover instead relaxing meal  Definitely opposite authentic Italian !  Finally older reviews talk hard find quiet spot but current location food court lot foot traffic walking by  conclusion even though food good three star many good Italian places Las Vegas dine can't recommend Trattoria Reggiano  <EOR> Small quaint! nice change pace usual vegas mass herds  spaghetti carbonara fantastic  prices very reasonable staff attentive  hidden gem! <EOR> They best balsamic vinegar  ambiance little loud  tables somewhat crammed together but service excellent food good  <EOR> love service alfredo good however filet mignon meatball wasnt significant claims be  <EOR> Get early don't take reservations  Don't mislead tiny spot food authentic totally point!
