Food food tasty but unfortunately better   shrimp dal other tasty varietals     Unfortunately probably wouldn't again   sure better there  <EOR> i just recently all eat brunch  good regular menu but tell thing  $14!!! ALL EAT!!!!  They still 5 star because know regular menu best ive ever had   and brunch still VERY CHEAP indian food  many places over charge indian food  little hole wall anywhere america charge $14 alone ala carte item!!!! thats why keep them 5 stars!  if craving indian food brunch satisfy your craving   if really want live come regular menu  induldge!!! <EOR> Food generally 3 4 stars when on   However having eaten all Gaylord's San Fran over years why prices 20 50 percent higher bay area?  It's buying soft drink airport feel ripped off because know prices should be   Here's example Tandoori prawns SF location 22 bucks LV location $30   That's 28% difference price same entrée!  One more shining example 1 2 Tandoori chicken $20 bucks while whole $19 bucks SF  Over 50% difference price   And we're talking downtown SF some place avenues ghetto   I just can't justify overcharging all right Indian dinner  <EOR> Chicken VERY dry  groupon didn't pay full price  worth cost want MUCH better Taj Palace off Eastern Richmar  <EOR>
