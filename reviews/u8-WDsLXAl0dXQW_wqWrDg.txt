Will visit again when town  <EOR> Was ist denn jetzt los? Wo man mir vor drei Jahren noch einen schmackhaften Burger mit allem Zipp und Zapp kredenzte kam jetzt ein lieblos dahin geknallter Burger mit fadem Rindfleisch Patty und Scheibe Käse ohne jegliche Soße daher  Nicht einmal Ketchup war darauf das las sich der Menükarte ganz anders  Gut ich hatte keine Pommer dazu bestellt denn aus Erfahrung und nach vier Wochen im Amiland weiß man dass es eh zwecklos ist und es allenfalls schafft zwei Pommer anzuknabbern aber dass es gar keine Deko und nicht einmal das obligatorische saure Gürkchen gab? Das fand ich für den Preis von 14 Dollar frech  Der Teller war kahl dass mich das Weiß fast blendete  Tja da werden wir wohl nicht noch einmal hingehen    irgendwie komisch  Wo es Burgerläden wie Slot Machines im Casino gibt sollte man mehr Wert auf gutes Essen legen  Der Service konnte es auch keiner nicht mehr herausreißen dass der Koch irgendwie wohl keine Lust mehr hatte  <EOR> We hope when Bailey bartender!    She very pleasant knowledgeable beer    The happy hour wonderful!     Highly recommend pickle fries hoisin chicken wraps  As posting all beers $5 between 2 5 pm  <EOR> Food service pretty good! Would recommend BBQ Bacon Burger cold draft your choice! <EOR> The burgers really good   server attentive efficient   fries come own little baskets which cute touch   only thing would differently would would only order burger fries split it   burgers huge french fry portions too   use very good quality beef burgers shows very first yummy bite  <EOR> BOOOOO! overall place  food no good over done I asked medium service slow could eaten lot other good places strip price  <EOR> Meh  Eh  Blah    Before making long drive back LA 'crew' i lack better term cranky hungry hung over couldn't agree kind food consume  When doubt grab burger  stumbling around New York New York ran into place    It pretty empty figured could some food relatively quick hit road  bad wasn't case    The service ridiculous  wasn't busy all plenty staff around but mannnnnnn slow descriptive enough  guess everyone else hungover too    Anyway digging idea grass fed beef all hipster burger ness adore  bad didn't deliver   My burger dry side so much med rare bun bit day old feeling flavors gamey over seasoned  Damn it  hate when waste calories bad food    Also burger options says 'avocado' whereas another option 'guacamole' assumed two options  Nope no avocado  Stooopid   But guac fresh give them that  However begs question whether homemade   which means could avocado plain right? anyway  ON POSITIVE bacon thick tasty fries very tasty real  Made actual taters  Appreciation that  <EOR> Can't remember when ever ask much longer ? food! place s l o w   waitress served sodas also served another before food came    sweeties order wrong  wrong burger    order medium cooked burger cooked well done! could believe it! table 6 people next happy long wait food waitress brought them French fries first! won't back   ever!!!  $12 00 burger???really??? star waitress! <EOR> My trip Broadway Burger only scraped way because starving butt off!
