Some favorites Thyme Bourbon Queen's Park Swizzle Penicillin  drink menu broken liquor then three four other random specialty cocktails created some bartenders    The service bar always good but seen some improvements service consistently great  really terrible names am kind embarrassed don't know any bartenders names except Nate not sure if he works anymore but they've all really nice conversational!  My experience dining room varied which why still leave star off  equally many so so meals equally ho hum service above average meals excellent service  came Restaurant Week last year incredible meal restored faith brick roasted chicken looking YOU! but give dining room couple more rounds before round rating up  Even if does continue disappoint lounge redeeming grace only gotten better time   Comme Ca almost casual feel neighborhood bar food drinks creative delicious  live without dining room now but would give try again managed expectations  <EOR> I Vegas work stayed Cosmo place really convienent   If judge book cover would expect unique menu items avail   ordered salmon great   portion sizes could little larger  <EOR> It's best french restaurant Vegas  But if you're craving some fancy seafood french dining experience place okay  Super pricey though  seafood platter lobster shrimp fish plus couple glasses wine ended paying around $150  might come back again if everything else Vegas close    I honestly disappointed place <EOR> I grabbed Groupon super excited dining another restaurant Cosmo trying hit all them   $51 dinner two bottle Rose    Neither Rose asked waitress alternative offered two alcoholic beverages instead  bf just beer while tried cocktails Ramble  concoction gin muddled raspberry lemon  fan gin which may reason didn't it  really thought tasted dish washing soap   But lot fresh raspberry chalking just liking gin   We decided appetizer top two entrees  roasted bone marrow oxtail jam  bone marrow just standard nothing special  name oxtail jam little misleading but complaining  very nicely sized bowl super tender juicy oxtail 6 small slices bread  oxtail delicious some cilantro top add little more flavor  just wish more bread oxtail sit top of    For entrees Berkshire pork bf beef brisket  Both agreed pork much better  3 different preparations pork all very tender flavorful  favorite sort shredded pork mashed seasonings served somewhat cold room temp  brisket interesting  super tender but same time dry pretty flavorless  corn succotash alright too    We substituted sides brisket mac n' cheese $1 extra  looked delicious when came but when dug bit disappointed  creamy everything pretty good flavor but there's thick layer panko breading top made each bit little dry  wish less that   Besides food service pretty phenomenal  very attentive probably because wasn't many people even Friday night surprise! but overbearing    For dessert some lemon butter cookie fruits gelato  basically de constructed fruit tart  cookie little tough but fruits all good well gelato   The major downside restaurant added 18% gratuity even though only 2 us! service great probably would left nice tip regardless but forcing party 2 pay much tip bit ridiculous    Overall food wasn't spectacular but bad  But still paid almost another $50 even Groupon  place wasn't really worth price tag but fun try  <EOR> Comme Ca recommendation friend lives Vegas    We city Friday afternoon decided give try  called restaurant around 6pm see if needed reservations  offered 6 30 not happening 9pm  took later found time sufficient shopping shower dressed driver over  also requested window seat based reviews here     We seated immediately friendly hostess  She gave requested window seat  waitress came quickly took drink orders Gordon's Cup  great choice     The menu somewhat limited but short enticing options  server brought pretzel like knotted bread butter which good way whet appetite hold over while food getting cooked  boyfriend shared lobster bisque soup bone marrow oxtail jam skate mac cheese  definitely could done without lobster bisque average dish could gotten anywhere  bone marrow oxtail more made soup's shortcomings  Unique taste fresh flavorful definitely something check off foodie list  favorite part felt pretty satiated it    The skate tender laid over bed fingerling potatoes  very flavorful but didn't unique taste quite bone marrow  very well mac cheese which could meal itself  boyfriend says mac cheese best he's ever which I'd agree with  You'd hard pressed find something better  noodles chewy just tender enough cheese gooey but greasy crumbs top toasted perfect crisp made dish    The ambiance little casual price tag  placemats made paper no table cloth which took away experience high end restaurant  Overall we'd back recommend Comme Ca friend looking upscale French dinner  However we'd more likely visit often if atmosphere stepped notch  <EOR> We came happy hour definitely great value   assortment dishes including oysters clams half off   ordered steak tartare burger bone marrow shellfish platter escargots foie gras though latter part happy hour menu   If didn't order foie would even better deal would around $125 drinks five   highly recommend trying happy hour  <EOR> This wonderful little French gem terrific view strip   glad City Center properties maximized strip instead throwing everything back walled off   There's terrific small terrace if hot great place sit outside looking dazzling strip   The food delicious   brisket good sized yummy polenta side   pork chop small side but good none less   Efficient service without being overbearing   Friendly staff   Tables nicely spaced   wish Vegas could command better attire patrons but is   You'll spend good money quality meal sit next guy swimming trunks tank top   Welcome Vegas  <EOR> Happy hour burger underwhelming  love non happy hour Comme ca Los Angeles maybe just due price point location but I'd expect consistency between locations such high end restaurant   My mojito also bland weak  Didn't any lime mint taste!
