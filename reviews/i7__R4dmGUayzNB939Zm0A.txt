I came sunday night around 11 pm no there  Well wanted try place  order unagi don ask waiter if its lunch menu he said no said ok want that   food came miso soup good unagi good too   only problem menu its say 8 99 then he gave check stated 10 99 wth?! lol     should update menu prices <EOR> If want authentic japanese food would recommend coming here! large selection food price isn't all bad either  Another reason why place because open late  Service improve but other check out! <EOR> One places good cheap Japanese food  Pictures menu helps your ordering  Its best ramen sushi Japanese place town  But its still good way cheaper most items   They're canton ramen adds Chinese flavor ramen hint sesame oil corn starch  Tako wasabi straight wasabi flavored octopus  Agedashi tofu pretty good  mapo tofu could use less starch but its still yummy  Sushi menu but all ayce places its only if u want quick fix  Stir fried Udon delivered every time    highly recommend   Overall its good place price variety dishes curry rice noodles grilled meats much more  <EOR> It long while since last ate place  previous visit recall trying Japanese katsu curry shoyu ramen  Both decidedly mediocre which would explain long absence  However wife read some promising reviews Shuseki particularly interested trying takoyaki tonkotsu ramen off went    Our order consisted kakuni don okonomiyaki takoyaki tonkotsu ramen   The kakuni nicely marinated five spice soy sauce  Although could braised little longer improve its tenderness easily favorite part meal  Unfortunately all downhill there   As tonkotsu ramen bland broth far thin utterly devoid rich porky flavor ought have  used yellow ramen noodles which nothing special  chashu if even call atrocious! single thick leathery tough slab saltiest pork ever tasted  both scrambled water glasses taking bite left rest hunk meat untouched   We did fare any better okonomiyaki takoyaki  both suffered same gummy soggy batter completely unappetizing   While service okay prices relatively inexpensive Shuseki poor value because low quality its food  am sorely tempted assign 1 star but because its decent kakuni mediocre katsu curry shoyu ramen previous visit suppose just barely merits 2 stars  return? Highly doubtful  <EOR> First all service BAD! It took 15 minutes take drink order  30 minutes received 1 roll sushi questionably fresh 45 minutes gave 2 ramen soups ordered   They 5 times bigger Monta but only 2 servers  don't care good food supposed I'd never refer anyone place let alone come back  <EOR> Went based reviews 3 00pm pretty empty  Ordered Kalbi ramen lunch special  waited various different  groups people arrived total 20 people scattered amongst seating area  waited waited waited food everyone around gets food 1 hr 15min receive food  half order ramen 6 pieces gyoza    Barely puts dent stomach but am afraid order anything else because if did might well order dinner since take long  long does take ramen order? broth already made noodle just warmed boiling water Kalbi doesn't take much cook throw soup????  The ramen noodles pretty good but broth average Kalbi tough rubbery  Gyoza average no better worse frozen ones grocery store  <EOR> the food good fact actual japanese dine just feel bit more authentic  <EOR> Shuseki formidable alternative Ichiza if dislike large obnoxious crowds  eat twice week no intention stopping anytime soon  small crew sweet polite fluent Japanese speaking waitstaff composed mostly females    When seat promptly if often enough like do remember your preferences  example always order green tea water boyfriend dislikes ginger miso soup  always remember third time didn't ask anymore    I appreciate ambiance low key somewhat earthy  girls work shuffle own iPods stereo  changing all time mostly Japanese but that   Sharing dishes encouraged entrees pretty big  Sushi exceptionally fresh being desert  love mochi ice cream bathrooms always clean  <EOR> I really want give place star but first visit may just bad night   Also date enjoyed food mainly looking plate bit me  The service quick first then order disappeared talk single guy bar   Water never refilled ignored unless bringing next part order  Their Korokke Potato Croquettes ok but nothing special   also tried order kara age only thing night enjoyed  Since wanted try bit everything tried tonkotsu ramen gyoza okonomiyaki  The ramen worst bowl noodles ever had   Instant noodles would blown water  The gyoza only time life turned down plate potstickers   obviously pre made frozen poorly cooked probably expired   tasted rubber  Okonomiyaki half decent but trying much   Keep your okonomiyaki simple don't throw everything kitchen   also far thick little under done middle  I'm normally complain this   tend only review happiness but disappointed food post this  <EOR> Went Shuseki lunch 1 3 11 Monta packed nearly 45 minute wait  Wow CHANGE me   It used pretty tasty place but last visit have improve ALOT return  place decenly busy but only waitress entire place  Therefore she very attentive   The food pretty disappointing well  tonkotsu ramen guess Monta REALLY spolied good stuff  broth weak flavorless 2 slices chashu unseasoned boiled bits nothing   My husband ordered katsu curry set whar he just gross unacceptable  curry sauce seemed pre made boxed mix cold seperating itself  know boxed Japanese curry mix can fantastic if hot decently tended  looked VERY unappetizing  katsu freshly made tho decent  so he said The waitress seemed avoid never once asked food was  No matter running late actually getting fresh order just wasen't going work day   They have step game loose lots more customers many great places eat Chinatown  <EOR> I love place  Pretty big awesome customer service  AMAZING food  little corner God definitely deserve more business   Love place  every once whole variety menu almost endless  couple mess ups but none less great food <EOR> Food poor quality overpriced   Tried place 3 times now just gets worse worse dont waste your time money  Also done dinner just wanted took them 30 mins come over give check   SUPER slow service  <EOR> It nice somewhere where good value  comfortable place eat   always good unobtrusive service   food consistent I eat 2 4 times per month   Also if town down Spring Mountain Road restaurant fairly close drive Treasure Island Fashion Show Mall no cannot walk getting cab back restaurant strip may entail wait   <EOR> I've avoided putting review place because always giving chances making excuses poor service  boyfriend coming years spacious loud food good  just downhill tastes plus slow short staffed service  mean c'mon occasion ate food cancel order sushi because waitress said ran rice  guess there's first time EVERYTHING!

Forgive brevity can't remember all things tried let alone prices !    The sushi good   love some fried ones   Japanese Lasagna bit fatty side but tastes heaven!  ton ton soup also favorites thanks friend Chris   soup light spice tasty broth   egg chicken noodles etc   suppose flavor broth sets apart very good stuff   I've also liked some lunch specials   curried pork pretty good although am personally big fan style curry kind thick Indian curry      I've several great meals enjoyed every single them   Shuseki must try Japanese food lovers! <EOR> i love fresh food everything good there!! kids love there! love atomosphere!!! <EOR> Well first things first  family waiting door pretty much five minutes  waitress sight two customers table  all confused! started seat ourselves sushi chef sight but he didn't budge look us  some point raised voice asked if open  Quickly Chinese waitress came over asked wanted drink    No apology needed  The food other hand delicious  niku udon  mmmhmm  some good food  Highly recommend it   Also cousin commented certain smell lingered  Kinda cat urine    Just guys know  <EOR> Okay last review gave place 4 star   Since then probably returned 2 times service significantly going down hill   Yes keep coming    just can't stay away Curry Ramen   bowl amazing but seriously pay attention your customers!    literally sitting 20 minutes just looking server hoping enough cue ready check    Unfortunately wasn't good enough sign because looked then looked away started talking another while leaning wall   2nd attempt pushed bowls way towards edge table   fail when came getting service   Finally just decided kitchen asked bill   trying patient since saw another server give table check and didn't want physically wave them down but yeah gave awhile     Overall great food not so great service  <EOR> I've come many times  every time always treated coldly because staff seems kinda racist towards hispanics  Terrible communication didn't coming table  saw all mexicans back  place isn't authentic  but foods pretty good  <EOR> Great sushi sake  Nice hole wall heart Chinatown  If Ichiza packed next stop <EOR> Went today say bomb! always   Shuseki nice location because overly crowded squeezed tuna venue some other restaurants Spring Mountain   Plus parking easy never circle around trying find space   The food great all but thing sticks almost EVERY restaurant seems wrong menus   Shuseki though menu perfect! mean every single dish menu some sort picture visual   love it! Now don't deal any messy translations foreign dish titles aren't familiar like would explain Natto without picture? Fermented stringy Japanese beans   Doesn't sound very appetizing does it? I Karaage Ten Ten Ramen Philadelphia Roll my fav some fried rice   good   would say ramen pinch salty but could just me   Prices off CHAIN only came $20   just love when eat good food good price value yes cheap    only tiny detail left giving full five stars many selections   If see menu there's number  Available foods Shisamo Grilled Smelt Fish ordered waitress returned only tell out   Still service off chain location nice parking swell food price quality yummy   PROS Food Service Parking all good! Lots food variety CONS some food selections <EOR> Ate few times mostly convenience because part Chinatown usually to   food always okay great service mediocre   However terrible experience last visit don't think ever eat again   First off service terrible   open hours stated open today 11 30AM 1AM although when around 4 45 closed   found later re open 5 although no way knowing just going since doesn't state anywhere sign   However didn't mind waiting although didn't open doors until well 5 10   only customers yet waitress hardly paid any attention instead seemed actively ignoring us   We ordered came beef udon soup which good usual   also decided try nikujaga omurice which where things started wrong   First all nikujaga clearly states beef potatoes under yet when received dish no potatoes found only few pieces fatty beef stewing overly salty sauce along egg   No onions no potatoes which willing overlook although definitely rip off    However when omurice came soggy disgusting nearly drowning ketchup   only take bite each know nasty   wanted let waitress know but she didn't come table least 15 minutes more despite being any other customers until waved over   After letting know didn't omurice she stared blankly asked she should do   asked send back when she rudely bluntly told Well can't because ate even though literally took two bites before knowing inedible   taken aback rudeness didn't even know say   offered order something else stead the yaki udon which also mediocre but when came time pay she still tried charge omurice didn't eat   said if going pay might well kept instead sending back her   making big deal calling someone she grumbled Fine time but any more if she doing big favor charging something didn't eat   left quickly that   On side note water tastes strange   charge $0 50 using credit card if your order under $20   Overall terrible service   taking business elsewhere never eat again despite convenience  <EOR> This place boyfriend's spot when want snack fairly priced meal  We're regulars even before started yelping  usually tempura ice cream which never fails satisfy me  Rarely would give much ice cream but still tastes great regardless  beef tongue skewers would great if didnt put much salt them  literally wipe off    I also places lunch specials  only less $10 lot food    The staff also nice  always friendly having big smiles faces  <EOR> Love place    I used eat Fuji Ichiban Japan Guam when moved looking same great ramen place   trying few places Vegas stumbling across place great find   stepping into Japan when walk through doors   Great service great food worth trip   Their menu typical Japanese both written walls then picture menu American people   always order jellyfish salad karage tonkatsu ramen tempuras   YUMMY   Coming Japan Guam ramen reminds Fuji all way   You eat when time late night craving some Japanese flair   Give try  it definitely worth your while  <EOR> usually favorite japanese restaurant when come vegas but food little more expensive portions smaller  only girl wait LONG werent many people there <EOR> Can't $8 99 Lunch special bowl Ramen side Rice and short ribs  Comes few pieces kimchee too! Always chill local vibe inside  Never feel rushed <EOR> This place classic Vegas romp even came back high school days  food good service super fobby you'll always likely see someone know when coming here   Skip lines Ichiza come when want quick good Japanese food  also doesn't hurt centralized everything else  <EOR> If want great Japanese food off strip come Shuseki  only twice but always different things menu  everything sushi sashimi fried rice udon ramen bento boxes rolls   you name probably well everything but close it   all friends ordered no one's ever complained  addition tell serve authentic Japanese food since those special menus items just Japanese hint hint   and entire staff Japanese   Tired overpriced food Vegas strip   then stop Shuseki treat  <EOR> I join coworkers evening karaoke but hungry thought would something eat   I saw little restaurant decided give try   When enter place nice ambiance decor theme enjoyable    I immediately greeted seated ordered beer while look through menu   It looks though noodles bowls sushi large part offerings  chose order Teriyaki Chicken bento instead   The bento arrived looked ok  think portion chicken meager portion salad simply iceberg lettuce tomato wedge dressed thousand island dressing  could entire meal home  hoping something little more authentic less Americanized especially being China Town   I wouldn't recommend place better places enjoy noodle bowls basic teriyaki chicken   Perhaps dine house  Bon Apetit! <EOR> I love ramen place! family coming least once every vegas trip since found place  prices super cheap portions massive price! huge selection sashimi rolls ramen udon lot bento box dishes well lunch    The service excellent well  quick checked periodically without coming back much  favories sexy roll spicy miso ramen  other ramen selections yummy too! recommend canton ramen tonkatsu ramen  Delicious! <EOR> The only thing keeps 3 star review food good   Hands down   However service sucks ass   Yes horrible   Why?  Because second visit two months encountered same thing server whole restaurant people   mention fact young lady more interested chatting friends showed eat serve food   matters worse she still added items ordered but never saw send back twice items taken off bill   But enough crappy service let's food   ramen good   mean hard find real ramen those lived Japan know ramen mean meal $0 30 college diet filler   tako yaki okonomiyaki good too   brother loves salty salmon fried rice although jury me   But miso ramen tako yaki you'll full happy guarantee it   well if over little trollop taking 30 minutes bring then charging something didn't order   Yeah said it  <EOR> I am constantly surprised great restaurants keep finding Las Vegas   Just when think found all good ones   !  Shuseki none modest name! Izakaya tapas if type restaurant   However also entrees even noodles   Being lunch opted ramen   Since most places pretty bad doing ramen expectations little low   Actually impressed   overcooked noodle degree but otherwise soup stock good   korean bbq style which bit unorthodox but nicely filling shoyu base soup   also tasted miso based which just fine   best part gyoza appetizer $2 95 6 pieces   Most places gotten into habit charging $7 same   Tsk tsk   Interestingly enough though owned Japanese waitress Chinese believe    necessary roll bust your Japanese language skills   Naturally place would direct competition another LV izakaya favorite Ichiza   Unfortunately cannot comment because lunch did izakaya menu   Judging ramen would say place nicely   During day place pretty empty only waitress probably cook   only three parties service actually kind slow   big deal but good know if hurry   Shuseki tucked away corner first floor strip mall keep eye it   did even realize until visit though plaza several times before  <EOR> Roomy restaurant comfortable vibe nice quiet   I ordered spicy pork ramen let tell actually spicy! give generous amount ramen soup  far best ramen Japanese restaurant  noodles weren't soft weren't hard  soup super hot know good stuff  sushi rolls looked great but wasn't mood sushi   The customer service fine walk pay but wasn't big deal  <EOR> Great sushi  Interesting mall complex  Cheap beer  far strip <EOR> Giving 1 star feel bad but EEK! thinks not!!!

Prices usually range $5 10 00 group dishes actually fairly decent price if you're going late night friends date   I guess find space appealing only because bigger Ichiza Tratorria Nakamura Ya  Obviously those restaurants built small place Japan but Shuseki's space alittle bigger less busier  Which love! don't talk over other customers! don't wait long service there's just much space to   ah   breathe    So if you're looking place eat group intent decent conversation carry I'd suggest spot  think could intimate booths offer quiet atmosphere  However warned  decor slightly tacky red walls cheaply done seems but PROMISE if you're date isn't high maintenance just looking place talk eat good thumbs trust  date once good date <EOR> pros    great place some tasty japanese food while las vegas   traditional little japanese restaurant strip mall   purely luck group looking some sushi just happened chinatown area las vegas    just noticed sign which struck typically japanese writing style   the inside very nice family run restaurant   nothing fancy but neat clean presentable   seated long table bench along wall chairs opposite it   any place which food items written native non english alright me     the food tasty lot choices ramen noodle soup don buri some meat over rice sushi yakitori grilled meat stick small little plates kinda japanese dim sum but more eaten beer alcohol   also some unusual dishes such omurice omelette over rice okinomiyaki japanese style pancake   alcohol selection also very nice choice beer shochu chu hi sake well   all all very complete menu    me buddy henry all yakitoris 8 varieties also nice selection ramen   wife ordered shoyu soy sauce broth which nice soup base 3 slices cha shu pork well bevy bamboo shoots bean sprouts green onions sheet nori red laver kelp    buddy wyster tantan noodles which hot spicy chopped meat soybean paste lots chili peppers   other buddies mike shay ordered sushi which great   some pretty unique rolls lot deep fried makis well   all all food very delicious came pretty fast     so if looking some japanese food las vegas around chinatown come place dissapointed  open until 2 a m  every night morning?  cons    parking tight many spaces size mall but think more underneath behind mall   oh bathroom clean but toilet men's bathroom missing top commode when flush little spurt water funny but interesting  <EOR> Shuseki good alternative Ichiza those aren't down crowdy noisy atmosphere Ichiza lovable  twelve group standing outside Ichiza only find silly someone hadn't made reservation  do?

AHH! guess just can't stay away good food here  really Ramen Katsu Curry few other items menu  reasonable prices open until 1 2 am    I would say once while okay maybe once GREAT while Shuseki does provide good customer service    Wait     Say whaaaat??  Yes usually only happens when crowded crowded mean only 2 3 tables occupied  Two servers actually very attentive refilling drinks asking food if need anything else actually grab your payment bring back your change charge slip sign  Usually other way around where bring your drinks food then don't see them again long time ignore you  lot times walk register ask bill pay right there    I just discovered good lunch specials well  ramen your choice rice ball which pretty huge price just ramen which always $7 99 case  probably back again next week! <EOR> Yeah  I am them easily offended Japanese guys overly sensitive gets disgusted when people order Ramen wrong way  Japan actually proper protocol order Ramen existed thousands years  Click link see traditional Japanese way order Ramen   http www youtube com watch?v=kwGql FyXjE feature=youtu be  Not long ago Dad told story he Ichiza eat because everyone kept telling authentic Japanese food   Immediately when he walked crazy old man ran said something Japanese  Even though Dad 100% Japanese he does speak language since family came America 1800s  Dad like f*ck trying say me?   then  old man informed he could only eat 40 minutes then leave    but he did say any western customers  didn't believe story when Dad told because thought exaggerated  Dad tends talk lot sh!t people pick fights assumed old man asked leave account bad behavior  Well last 2 months conversation favorite Japanese sushi chef he told exact same story  old man singled being Japanese given time limit  believe Ichiza trying market themselves towards western customers really don't wanna see faces anymore  won't sh!t SHUSEKI      probably eaten SHUSEKI more time then eaten Fukumimi Monta Sora Anime all combined  Mainly because happy  stay open when show midnight  work 12 16 hour days usually SHUSEKI only Ramen Ya still open 11PM  all hate Japanese businesses usually close very early    but SHUSEKI actually owned operated ethnically Chinese resident Japan he willing allow business open later     When walk into SHUSEKI most likely recognize person eating works another Japanese Restaurant   evil old man Ichiza frequents place  girls INABA seen here  legendary Hiro San the former fugu sushi chef semi retired working Sushi Rainbow now also found he actually tells favorite Ramen Ya   does tend popular amongst LV Japanese community even though see Chinese restaurant    Because place operated ethnically Chinese man born raised Japan gonna Tan Tan Men menu  Tan Tan Men SHUSEKI more Chinese style miso broth   Los Angeles Ramen Yas would actually menu Tan Tan Style Ramen instead Tan Tan Men    Well guess due some negative comments yelpers cook SHUSEKI decided modify Tan Tan Men bit   little disappointed because some days actually mood more traditional Chinese variation    I service here   Ryan personal favorite worker  If he working he sure your ramen way want it  example Ryan actually cooks bowl Ramen spicy just can't finish it  Last time he made Spicy Miso hotter Orochon's  He also cook noodles more firm soft depending your preferences    The girls work late night shift really nice but tend super shy side  Unfortunately only Jen Ryan speak perfect English difficult communicate other workers    My recommendation Tan Tan Ramen side Karage Gyoza  Why? Because command so    <EOR>
