Ah mazing  Really delicious! Felt pretty authentic too  Staff very sweet friendly  absolutely again  <EOR> I've twice now lunch both times good = consistency!

Pretty authentic Cantonese Hong Kong cuisine! Staff friendly  ordered Garlic deep fried spare ribs yummy HK style beef stew egg noodles soup pretty al dente stirred fried beef rice noodle gravy fiancé thinks could more salty but just fine   Good spot SW when don't wanna drive Chinatown  <EOR> So driving place while now decided give them try      Well let's just say walked 5 minutes walked back out   The place totally empty     yes little before 9pm    maybe  why empty??  From other ppl's review seems pretty decent food service here       Maybe should've come them   service lack why star       I walked greeted right away     But when walked place order girl behind counter walked blocked walking counter   ok     stopped 5 feet counter asked question     Would possible large soup half egg drop half hot sour soup?   She proceeded faces crazy making request     Then proceeded tell bad idea told would just add extra egg into hot sour soup   she didn't understand sweetness egg drop soup spiciness sour hot sour soup all mixed together  best soup   never issue getting any other Chinese restaurant   But apparently restaurant HUGE ISSUE   Then she proceeded tell going long long wait since large order ahead me   guess family order huge order when u only 1 person working kitchen   since only ordering person     guess order didn't count???  And she made very very clear she did want business  walked out  Why bother spending hard earned money restaurant doesn't want it?  So if u good service     Congrats     Apparently wasn't lucky bunch   If great food    Congrats    Cuz didn't taste anything all     So coming again     Even though closest Chinese restaurant me     I Pho Annie instead    gave good service good food    So good luck everyone     may odds ever your favor     Lol <EOR> Best healthy Chinese town! must support place if health means anything you!
