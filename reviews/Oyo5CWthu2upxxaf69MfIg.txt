This place awesome! large menu satisfy any Chinese food craving have! lunch special menu very inexpensive only $5 both quality quantity  food made fresh served hot  rice plates vegetables noodles all great  must drink wash all down  recommend passion fruit green tea milk tea boba   so refreshing! Also must try turnip cake  best ever had  Great consistency crispy outside overall delicious  If you're full end meal take Chinese waffle go  tasty treat  visit Vegas often crave Chinese food   I've eaten Anna's Garden four times past two weekends!!! <EOR> This 4th time location must say food kind good  bf grabbed dinner last night heres shrimp w baby bok choy salt pepper fish beef mushroom w onions  Everything deelish Although didn't try beef dish since dont eat meat figured bf liked it  He gets same thing all time   The reason star deduction because service turtle slow  guess partly because bus full Asian tourists decided unload dine only server ape shit then disappeared  mean whole restaurant completely packed less 2 minutes  it quite scene   But don't blame probably would've gone bananas too  Overall food good would gladly come back again  <EOR> Went bf weekday lunch  read $5 lunch specials heard friend good  Well place packed  only waited 5 min before seated  many choices would sugest going group try more items  ordered 3 items way much food 2 people bf big eater! enough take home second meal  We ordered beef stew curry sauce tasty meat pieces mostly tender good flavor although am sure part some them came from   Beef black bean chow fun tates most places chow fun  salty fried pork chops all said salty fried pork chops! Great when craving something salty  wanted try hot pot but waitress all but told couldn't order it  She told would take very long time least 20 min  she kept asking if knew was  All all huge selection better decent food  spectacular but pretty good price quantity worth try! <EOR> I totally agree Yelper Heinz comment  Vegas desperate need HK style cafe craving ever since moved L A all those lives L A  something very thankful for  HK cafe paradise L A compared Vegas  Anna's Garden did meet those cravings  Food tasty price bad all staff very attentive friendly  decor okay fancy modern some those you've L A  three order 6 dishes all good except steamed fish wit black bean sauce  Just don't order fish chinese restaurant if don't see fresh fish tank there  couple fish fillet sitting cubes tofu some chinese greens taste but very satisfying  Other dishes Jellyfish appetizer fried chicken wings seafood udon beef chow fun honey walnut shrimp    all tasty   also house soup day along meal  might regular if another cafe don't open soon! O    also serve dim sum all day     yet try that! <EOR> I Anna's can't really price lunch   Taste ok   If dinner pretty empty prices normal prices   guess probably would again dinner find much better places dinner same price    I think service mediocre what's more dislike owner   think she's complete idiot snob   Three times twice phone once person would ask question wrong answer    Very simple questions take certain credit card time does lunch special end?  She should answering phones!  If lunch prices weren't cheap wouldn't there  <EOR> In comparison last time here  place sucked big ! Especially service  servers seem disengaged work  constantly keep flagging them down order refill drinks  Then order wrong  complete let down!!!!! am sure if want back place again  <EOR> $5 lunch menu special?  can't wrong long stick choices  otherwise ripoff if venture off higher priced items   they accept credit cards but need minimum purchase $20  <EOR> Newest restaurant Las Vegas  group friends  Must try garlic fried chicken wings pork chop cutlet clay pot rice  Excellent service staff    thing most place drink   cafe style restaurant which see lot Las Vegas   California use seeing cafe style places   recommend all people give place try because food good price just right  <EOR> Who doesn't great deal?! Anna's Garden delivers great food super affordable price  Mid day lunch deals all trend amongst chinese restaurant competition Chinatown area  family's favorite places too  $5 00 dish coffee milk tea = two thumbs up! <EOR> We dinner Wednesday night around 9PM  place pretty empty  soon ordered chefs cooks came eat dinner waiter joined them  Needless say food ordered came dish time waiting time each dish 5 minutes between  food OK nothing fancy service good which very typical Chinese restaurant  again? Probably  just much choice Chinese food around Las Vegas  <EOR> Okay think why hell eating Anna's Garden Las Vegas when all nice restaurants Vegas around?  Well if Vegas often gotta try different places can't afford eat nice meals everyday   and definitely don't wanna eat buffets everyday      So land friend now local Vegas    The food pretty plain HK style Cafe food much throughout Los Angeles     So trying compare same style restaurants LA no comparison     The plus side Dim Sum all day long   bad thing ordered spareribs Dim Sum menu took forever!!!!!  almost thought forgot us   It's weird Green Onion Pancake made outta WHEAT   what heck!?!?!?  SIgning off       <EOR> Went lunch 6 26   Just wife but planned take leftovers another meal too   ordered couple $5 00 dishes two other things  whole roast duck Chinese beef stew   Everything pretty good disappointed   However roast pork juicy would liked   crispy but meat little dry   But all in all pretty good   would back again more people when return Vegas July  <EOR> A must visit family when visit Vegas  Owner staff very friendly  steamed fish absolutely delicious  rice cooked hot pot also another dish order again again  <EOR> When think Chinese take out Anna's Garden comes mind  only $5 lunch specials utterly satisfied  many choices but really salty pork chow mein miscellaneous fried rice  few friends try quite satisfied also   Seating quick even though decent sized group  Service little better average but busy during lunch special hours expected  Drinks refillable you're paying can   I let actually take $5 specials  But call when refer    I wish location lot closer would more often if was   Don't forget take copy lunch special menu paper copy version   highlight favorites keep paper car when hunger strikes! <EOR> Didn't expect hole in a wall place looking outside  early dinner Sat  seated right away  Food came reasonable pace but nothing special  Price average  didn't find anything special offer other chinese restaurants don't chinatown  sure if back though  <EOR> I delighted find Hong Kong style cafe Vegas which long time thought non existent   8 times mixed experiences   The food dirt cheap especially if order lunch special   stuff baked pork chop rice curry seafood wonton noodle soup five dollars less   also some uniquely Hong Kong stuff spareribs rice noodles jiu cheng fung egg waffles    I've ordered baked pork chop rice almost every time favorite dishes not but general    say BPCR pretty unpredictable   Some days pretty good other days    PUKE!  Puke mainly because all pork chops rice fat bones won't know until bite into them concealed bright orange sauce  happened  couple times when ordered it    I guess if really craving BPCR few places that know of Vegas where it   5 dollars worth gamble may end baked pork fat bones rice    Another thing  unpredictable boba milk tea   also lot usually fine but last time bobas weren't chewy    cake balls   Yuck   suppose standard cheap Asian restaurants keep serving stuff  gone old bad   I also wouldn't recommend dinner menu   regular priced while awful nearby places HK Star KJ Kitchen much better food overall  <EOR> After visiting Anna's Garden few times 2 trips Vegas last 3 months firmly say 'two thumbs up'   Each time gone completely different experience  I suggest going lunch before typical lunch rush hours  The 1st time Chinese friend parents   every week lucky enough invited along time   4 ordered 8 dishes could take home bunch left overs week   Obviously love Anna's    mostly because authentic no MSG!     The 2nd time group non Asian friends English Latin mostly   Again everyone really liked food especially since lunch most dishes ordered ended being only $5 $6 each!  The 3rd time mixed group friends some Asian some not   Again lunch though time knew later avoid rush   arrived 2pm perfect   Again everyone thought delicious   So all all probably tried least 15 dishes Anna's last 3 visits   favorite pan fried noodle chicken veggies   hard noodle softens when put sauce it   used dish much preferring rice noodles egg noodles but ahhh times changed!  See ya there! <EOR> Owner cheap dishonest    We ordered set 10 people  order those dinner set 10 people  8 different dinner entrees added additional one  menu said fish but cheap plate vegetables stir fried 4 5 slices fish that's even enough 10 people   Also 3 10 dishes wee same  All three green peas mushroom stir fried same way  served cashew peanuts some kind other stuff  guest WTF? 3 same stuff?   just wow! also tab didn't show same price but little higher  overcharged additional order put in    i say buffet 7 bucks @ South Point Hotel  Cheaper better  <EOR> Ended trying take parents Noodle Palace they closed remodel apparently    Since still early 10 30am dad starving mom wanted wonton noodle soup ended since close OPEN lunch special $5 95 most dishes!  My mom cousin wonton noodle soup duck wonton noodle soup dad pigs feet noodle dish  My mom didn't complain which good sign cause nothing good her's    My dad enjoyed but thought noodles needed more flavor   He some type stewed pigs feet egg noodle dish noodles little bland but nothing little soy sauce didn't cure   pigs feet flavorful soft fell off bone   I duck wonton noodle soup   soup little bland wonton also little bland but shrimp wonton firm fresh   duck winner here   it moist thick just right amount fattiness   The duck good ended leaving whole duck go! so glad stopped duck alone bring back    <EOR> I stumbled upon place lunch surprised inexpensive lunch menu was    My order Wonton noodle soup Hainan chicken  Wonton noodle soup just OK $4 95  bowl large broth needed additional seasoning Wonton's lacked shrimp  much better Cal but Hainan chicken hit! rice tasty good portion fresh chicken yummy dipping sauce pickled chicken may entree hit all $5 25   I'm looking forward returning Anna's Garden checking roast duck some other entrees lunch dinner  <EOR> Oh HELL YA!!! double fist pump air    thought when someone handed lunch menu Anna's Garden Hong Kong Cuisine   long time coming     Vegas need good Hong Kong style cafe serving some yummy Cantonese fare   But good true!?!?
