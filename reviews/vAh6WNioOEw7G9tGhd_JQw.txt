No respectable place ask bowl chopstick     5   Prices few dollars higher would imagine   I place consider solid choice most authentic cantonese food  <EOR> Since first listing pop when searching Chinese restaurant Vegas just try out  take out bring eat others basing service food experience that  First all there's nothing 'express' place  sit down restaurant 'scoop food' place  also location inside Palace Station hotel   We arrived staff very helpful  ordered bunch dishes told take seat while prepared us  man even offered tea while waited then chatted Cantonese  thought extremely friendly but again might because spoke language   Throughout whole time waiting food all staff stopped chat me   So take into consideration 20 30 mins time food cooked time consumed       Beef broccoli okay choice  really flavorful beef tender broccoli fresh overcooked   Shrimp fried rice once again choice  bad fried rice although Chinese don't really only shrimp fried rice  bunch stuff     but good   Garlic gai lan  nice garlicky taste  didn't skimp garlic!   Salt Pepper pork chops  very tasty even sitting take box 20 30 mins  fact popular people ordered shrimp fried rice beef broccoli ended eating most this! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrr*  Braised tofu  also done very nicely stalks choy sum dried shiitake mushrooms    I thought everything really tasty wished dined instead  place definitely staying list places return subsequent trips when craving Cantonese style Chinese food   Wasn't pricey either  all including steamed rice $40 tip included    4 5 stars!!! <EOR> This decent average Chinese food   Nothing great but certainly nothing bad   Possibly tad over priced quality but quantity  <EOR> My girlfriends favorite Chinese place  sure crunchy noodle dish but crunchy flavorful delicious   shrimp fresh cook everything when order opposed flash frying heat up  I am fan fish tanks dirty miserable fish swimming nothing else them no decorations anything which star off  food almost all exact same texture exception being aforementioned crunchy noodle dish which other star knocked off   believe delivery times limited more comfortable ordering person due slight language barrier  close home quick drive   next Subway parking right front limited walking short distance opens entire swap meet parking lot far all  <EOR> This little Mom Pop spot delicious affordable  never wrong salt pepper pork chop salt pepper shrimp  used short rib stew but unfortunately no longer serve it  <EOR> Haven't back while BF dropped twice last month    Still very good  busy trying new places haven't back but now asking why? still best Chinese places open late service decent enough prices cheaper competitors     I new favorite stuffed tofu black bean sauce  love everything it  Black bean sauce noms  Crispy yet silken inside tofu nom nom noms   know pretty damn eloquent    Not really much say except if havent tried please do  little slice comfort Chinese food  <EOR> My family coming since 7 love it   always egg drop soup salt pepper shrimp Mandarin pork chop   since vegetarian now ordered glazed tofu amazing!  favorite Chinese restaurant  <EOR> Was looking good late night Chinese food off strip  place generous portions open till midnight good authentic Chinese food I am those people would ever order orange chicken service good food reasonably priced too!

Food Express actually bit closer hood sometimes convenience wins    I avoided Food Express because read somewhere servers could mean if didn't speak Chinese way avoid mean people  Well should known if am reading Yelp can't trusted because servers super friendly definitely speak Chinese Hao doesn't count!    The inside appears freshly remodeled sit down establishment despite name suggesting should expect carry out  plenty big round tables your closest pals   We ordered lunch special menu available 11am 3pm  Everything right around $5 comes soup fried rice egg roll  Cheap lunch winner! When soup egg corn chowder great taste but bit porridgey  still ate whole cup but ideal world would prefer thinner consistency  Alas Chinese restaurants love gloopy soups sometimes    For entree chicken broccoli tofu option lunch specials menu  didn't ask if subbing tofu possibility however  When dishes hit table bit concerned  Based appearances food looked little heavy if cooking oil thick perhaps used generously ordered spicy could see no evidence spice  However bite all concerns flew door  flavors quite delicious heavy garlic ginger my faves spice there! Unlike some Chinese restaurants use red chili oil sauce give dishes quick kick Food Express used lots sliced jalapenos  delivered perfect heat dishes  meat lovers generous meat  left wishing more broccoli less chicken but realize am probably minority there!   The egg roll definitely appeared homemade fried rice fine  chunks pork warned vegetarians! think pork may show unexpected spots  course would prefer brown rice but far haven't found true sit down Chinese place Vegas serves brown rice don't expect it    Fresh ingredients good flavors amazing value lunch smiling servers    place would take in laws Sorry Spring Mountain Road but might found lunch mistress  What's English language having male equivalent mistress? <EOR> I really used love place but just service food sucked  First sat down asked iced tea he brought hot tea said complimentary  Ok cool still iced tea  He said no laughed said some ice then told no agian   Wth anyways just thinking well whatever least know food good order honey walnut shrimp   came small portion 12 95 soggy   Oh ya just tasted tosed mayo no honey  Well needless say lost business  <EOR> Came first time other day pick lunch say really good lunch specials  sweet sour chicken fried rice egg roll $6 50!
