Thought it'd good ghe original Pastorcito East side  No wonder see lot people making line it  may taste similar El Pastorcito but seems meat quality good original one  Even if drive little more going totally worthy  <EOR> I recently found #1 location other end Charleston but actually closer me  Unlike many other taco trucks accepts credit cards if spot them open there's no reason stop!  The burritos packed meat quesadillas amazing  Don't forget hit salsa bar because don't pack your takeout order any found hard way first visit! but everything super fresh  asada lengua preferred meats but al pastor bomb too  <EOR> This best taco spot Vegas without doubt! many options choose burritos tacos quesadillas tortas! much stuff prize over exaggerated affordable delicious! personal favorite asada al pastor! Big difference between spot compared other taco trucks meat Quality! way marinated cooked spot amazing can't any fresher that! personal opinion think food way better when spot! sure stop when chance! won't regret it! <EOR>
