advantage of    Great service good place  suggest it <EOR> Prompted glowing recommendations trusted friends finally made return visit almost two years following initial ROTD earning write Daisho Sushi  enjoyable AYCE sushi meal hadn't diminished quality much if all   I'd due eat sushi pals while convinced try place instead usual Mon restaurants  planning lunchtime meal Daisho still allows pay $25 95 AYCE dinner any time day if want access special menu items many which one per person    I forgot ask whether still offer fresh wasabi which highlight favorite place  Oops   An additional page added AYCE menu recently various extra tapas appetizers some sashimi one per person dinner only some special rolls  friends cautioned steer clear pork belly sizzling beef can't report those  takoyaki surprisingly good crispy exterior tender interior plentiful bonito flakes tasty sauce  biggest drawback actual tako octopus pretty small piece   I also enjoyed soft shell crab tempura definitely use sauce yuzu chili salmon salad basically sashimi sashimi portions super white tuna yellowtail w jalapeño but portion sizes e g  nigiri cuts instead true sashimi quite modest considering all one per person  relatively worst item ika butter squid cooked sauce which little chewy forgettable flavor wise  Lastly Iron Man roll super white inside tuna top good still quite palatable end huge meal   The appetizers classic menu just good before  Bacon enoki lone yakitori order  bacon meaty smoky though still lacking crunchiness enoki soft yet still snap  Miso black cod still great although tasted better version therefore don't think world one  yellowtail collar meaty portions fattier more tender bits  Plus past negative kama experience burnt positive  fresh oysters small side but really good  fried oysters similarly small which unfortunate because linked fresh oysters one per person  Lastly baked green mussels cooked properly overly sauced   Nigiri still sushi mainstay Daisho delivered most part  loved flavorful blue crab  uni good expect AYCE quality range amaebi nice spite being little mushy  Scallop the good stuff bay scallop yellowtail salmon tasty  fatty albacore wasn't flavorful default wasabi sauce didn't help  biggest letdown meal super white  realized ordering super white tuna salad a new one per person menu item super white nigiri 1 sauce all super white slightly spicy condiment 2 quality super white itself significantly worse other local places offer   Dessert item per person  won't dock them unfortunately common policy among restaurants but always enjoyable more dessert  chose fried banana time wondering now why didn't order first place  banana split topped so called vanilla ice cream chocolate syrup sprinkles but banana pieces fried give richness warm temperature contrast  Just last time happened some leftover bacon throw top this  Just last time enjoyed it  Best AYCE sushi menu hack ever   It very crowded 1 30 ish provided expected quick service  first round items came quick succession chefs kitchen they'd handled few other tables' orders other rounds seemed arrive faster  Empty plates quickly removed too  only issue server didn't seem understand ordering each other the table speak  example when tried order sashimi first only time she stopped told per person  start over call super white call yellowtail  No biggie but something aware of   Along other minor food blemishes super white deficiency why decided only give four stars what's otherwise solid AYCE sushi restaurant  If you've favorite AYCE sushi place often need change if want dinner variety lunch hours Daisho remains good any secondary options  <EOR> First off    Rude jokes secondly    appetizers ordered ice cold third    ordered cup hot water lemon

Staff very friendly too  <EOR> I restaurant few times  love quality sushi but employees suck  only gave review four stars because good food is  workers aren't rude just don't provide great customer service  <EOR> Dropped last minute join some friends decided AYCE because wanted share individually ordering  Nothing really spectacular aside baked mussels salmon skin hand roll  Service good quick  However friend ordered fried bananas last call only find ten minutes later oil turned off weren't able fry it  manager nice enough come over aplogize which appreciated  All all pleasant experience but enough win over spots  <EOR>
