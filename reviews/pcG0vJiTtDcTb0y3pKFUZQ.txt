Really good food definitely going come back check more Russian menu!! Loved it <EOR> My group looking Russian restaurant Vegas place popped good reviews  Made reservation 12 people when showed literally only people there  point def little hesitant cause why would restaurant Vegas good reviews empty 8 30 pm??  Food amazing!!! bunch apps tons entrees shared them all  don't rembmber any names but literally everyone liked every dish which hard group  Try place if Vegas wanna try good Russian food off strip <EOR> I only person having lunch terrible  assume money evenings hookah crowd  <EOR> You kidding place   Bulgarian run operation bunch people absolutely no clue run pleasing appealing restaurant city hemisphere matter!  When walked few people asked table particular but told if just became RESERVED instead sit both where side 6 inches higher other other side no seat backs rather bench type seat   Interestingly enough RESERVED table asked still unoccupied upon departure   Inexplicably rave reviews Yelp convinced try place   Many reviews praised Chicken Kiev which quite unfortunate because told 'CHICKEN FRIGGING KIEV!    The waiter nice enough really over head   two different types potatoes plus rice available entrees he TRIED explain both same dish now because time two different types potatoes but eliminated two options but NEVER changed menus reflect that   potatoes potatoes! Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  He told Greek Salad $9 95 more big enough four people   Wrong!   barely enough two people   He brought serving spoon other utensil distribute its small portions   guess use hands Bulgaria   The music quite loud asked if  could turn down bit   waiter said probably because going party soon desired volume   Only later when escalated issue owner did turn down little bit   I ordered Chicken Kabob now unitary potato choice   wife too  kabob skewer concept sadly eviscerated replaced instead open slab chicken lots chunks heavy duty 30 weight potatoes fill plate    Carb city!  asked owner happened skewer expected veggies it?  He said different kind Kabob   over it!  My friend asked some gravy something equivalent put pork dish   He expecting something warm but instead given bowl looked ketchup nice cold boot   Bulgarian gravy!    I must say food tasted OK but nothing great memorable it    something your neighbor made invited over for    Eh?  OK  it   The Russian beer served quite good   Total tab food fest paltry $115 60!  I really don't understand all great review REALLY don't!      and really considered Mediterranean restaurant spite Greek Salad   Only good beer saved place star   Uh no star is!  Sorry guys but NO  <EOR> First time service great along atmosphere  Definitely back again  Thanks Mikael <EOR> I came dance competition supposed start 12 00 but kept delaying eventually dance competition 12 45! literally work EARLY check ID but entrance free  good part  18 21 drink  Basically came early some other people singing MC Ing omg sorry but suck bad leave because talent bad guys literally rapping singing whatever but bad sorry waiting long friend dance! just kept pushing back farther farther until 12 45 stay listen terrible talent omg sat outside until friend eventually he did preform think probably most epic part whole night mean crowd actually getting getting hyped because dance battle epic  Anyways sell drinks haven't tried food place kinda small kinda hard dance oh but sell hookah ! if hookah all means entry free but talent sucked sorry guys <EOR> Went Sunday night reading some reviews  Wow wrong !! Slow inattentive service hookah unattended even asked more coals  Asked drink which never received  When politely told server issues she didn't even really seem phased  shame great ambience potential great place chill friends drinks hookah food even option point  return  <EOR> This place potential but impressed  pretty much empty when entered never good sign but willing forgive if food good  wasn't     Mexican food international food russian food other type cuisine hardly any russian food which weird considering russian restaurant  <EOR> I know food  place best chicken kabobs ever! Plus garlic sauce good addicting  finding place once week  <EOR> We bought Amazon Local certificate reading reviews looking forward dining here   Church Sunday arrived around 1 00 pm   would expect restaurant busy time but parking doubt open lot empty   parked find place empty except person owner employee ? sitting table ASLEEP           turned around left leaving saw person a man look door must woke him  The place very dingy dark very un inviting   agree other reviewers all 5 stars trumped up   wouldn't back if free  Called Amazon Local told them happened very much agreement situation gladly refunded purchase  I would say everyone off day maybe theirs?? <EOR> I ordered delivery no gone restaurant yet  food delicious  boyfriend Chicken Kebab Beef Kebab  also hummus   portions adequate if large but all person eating believe  good food but also spent $50 which thought little high  sure 9$ delivery fee GrubHub more culprit  Nonetheless I'd recommend eating there  <EOR> Hookah good  Atmosphere fun but service HORRIBLE! saw server maybe 2 times best  take order bring drinks hookah then he disappeared   track down check  Don't know would come back due extremely poor service  <EOR> This great place  since last September  excellent food excellent people working there  enjoyed eating here  <EOR> Simply brilliant   This little secret should guarded only shared your besties    Their potatoes amazing  <EOR> Last time orders them did correct order 2 hours  ended getting food somewhere else  Good luck them  <EOR> I really wanted place amazing very excited take girlfriend here  seen Green Dacha online before but when stumbled upon Groupon place didn't hesitate   When showed inside absolutely empty loud music reeked hookah smoke asked sit outside  seated next group Russian speaking people typical eastern europeans very loud obnoxious  But thats fine am Ukraine used type behavior  But just bottom offensive  guys porch front behind literally stood right above heads  talking yelling loud couldn't hear girlfriend saying  All chain smoking face  Some them drunk  curs words using haven't heard past 11 years since left Ukraine  Anyways only beginning  Because all happening around now trying engage conversation decided eat soon possible   I asked server two waters  She came back water lemonade  asked switch lemonade water  She came back another lemonade  asked second time switch water  Guess what?! She cam back LEMONADE third time  point thought maybe she doesn't speak english said Russian guys water why keep bringing back lemonade ?! which she answered NO don't then laughed ran away  point sitting eyes wide open thinking WTF did just happened   Trying just order most expensive things menu which shrimp just Groupon money worth girlfriend chicken potatoes  bring 7 shrimp  repeat 7 medium size shrimp cold sauce $20! no rice  no salad  just shrimp  Thats it  Ive never paid much little   This place really needs someone watch over sure things don't hand did nigh  feel just needs someone charge  only reason giving 2 stars because girlfriends chicken potatoes pretty good which both ended eating  <EOR> Interesting place delicious food nice personnel cozy atmosphere  want come back more <EOR> They serve mouth watering Russian food touch Mediterranean dishes must try unique style taste environment  also hookahs yummy flavors!!! <EOR> I Friday October 2nd  Th service food atmosphere everything absolutely horrible  waitress number way close leaning chairs tables  When she wrote down order she put notepad table wrote way  ever server your life? No does that  No one  asked two waters she brought water lemonade  thought she misheard asked again  She brought same cup same lemonade  Finally thought maybe she doesn't understand English spoke Russian asked water lemonade stupid girl brought lemonade again  asked does she mr understand going on? said do You water  Tap water? She said no Russian walked away  horrible start  Then paid $20 shrimp platter 7 pieces shrimp sauce tasted crap  Such poor experience! run water? understand English RUSSIAN when ask water? Here's tip  water restaurant ever tell guest run water  Water free unless bottled  Did your water dispenser break? If professional explain why your bringing lemonade when didn't ask it  no lean chairs tables close feel breathing   disgusting understand body space  no put your notepad table see writing  Servers NEVER that  don't even know explain last night but just comedy bad was  Never ever eating recommending place  <EOR> Amazing food best hookahs ever had!!
