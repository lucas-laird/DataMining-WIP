Philly cheese steaks most favorite food groups!  Yes said food groups!!! sign long before place opened   Everytime drove did quick glance over see if big OPEN sign front   Finally graced Centennial area presence opened doors   gave bit let them work kinks Saturday finally made time try out   Their menu BAM right front you   wording big there's no need squint which great thing   Nothing worse being able see menu's small print   items very simple point much fact forgot put side dishes drinks carry   Right away asked if kids menu   nope no kids menu   girl counter little flustered explaining things could daughter   Nothing kids really    Minus star that   Big bummer   Immediately knew meal would strained because knew poor girl gonna sit watching eat while stomach growling   would thought would hotdogs if anything   Something consider guys!!  Just saying   I ordered chicken philly combo   said comes side but remember don't list sides   don't remember else offered but ordered mine fries   BF ordered steak philly combo onions mushrooms fries   Immediately he asked if American cheese YES it   having huge deal breaker BF   While ordering girl friendly   cook owner? said nothing even though he standing right front us   biggest pet peeve especially if he owner     So anyways food came looked amazeballs except could count fries had 9 fries  sad face Then daughter started digging fries   What? Hey wait minute!  want those   quickly gave some money order some fries   Poor girl  LOL  $2 00 fries     The sandwiches lets just say FANTASTIC!  bread fresh little flaky but enough substance didn't soggy   chicken cooked perfectly all flavorful  fries good   big fan steak fries but seasoning them pretty great like sweet salty taste     The restaurant itself really hot   front place all windows which probably hard keep cool?  guessing   But hot   Ick   place really clean girl wiped tables when she wasn't busy   Sunny 106 5 playing background   hate music many small restaurants resort that I guess because think universal   But Journey did come point all good   several other people while which always great!  Imma big fan helping local small businesses!!!  I cannot wait back!  Next time considering taking if temp hasn't changed getting some BK daughter prior  ***definitely consider pack dogs kids!  don't want exclude people when whole family enjoy meal!  Just helpful suggestion  <EOR> It's unfortunate love Philly cheese steaks but when walk into place no works seems single bit pride here  No usually front unless busy  If empty it'll take 3 5 min until see sign life behind counter  am fine waiting amazing food am also very fine great deals  issue flyers register food deals Chicken Philly combo $5 99  Yet when try order say deal expired  Well sir working establishment advertising deals aren't offering? Don't excuse flyers register only people phone number  extremely insulting sad  Very disappointing  haven't lost business but would much more concerned being respected honorable community  Don't fool food offers then honor them  Remove them general public new ones  <EOR> As reading previous reviews noticed particular  mentioned workers handle food without gloves  am writing waiting food looking any signs gloves  None all  workers aren't wearing them they're making gyros   violation against health code your food handling   Besides say food delicious maybe extra germs hands lol but nonetheless always friendly serve favorite fries  <EOR> Everything always great  regular customer but first review  Food always fresh delicious made order  think guy cooks owner he's just awesome too   makes everyone feel you're eating your family's house  <EOR> I Sat  morning no except working man  Asked its goin delicious thots runnin thru head  Made order best sandwich  Would repeat refer those spot  Pricey yes but quality there  <EOR> The guys working grill register phenomenal very polite! Food perfection fresh! beef gyro cheese steak combo both amazingly good! coming back! <EOR> Not all happy experience them tonight  ordered cheesesteak no peppers onions and saw cashier write down receipt  Another dude comes food  Fast forward 20 minutes  I home open find sandwich full onions peppers shrooms  Sweet  Roommate took bite said tasted ok   Also ordered Greek salad    puts broccoli Greek salad?? <EOR> Super disappointed reading all great reviews  Food wasn't phenomenal but dirt grime restaurant put bad taste mouth  tray hadn't cleaned ages sticky covered grease patrons before us  black flakes ice which usually means ice machine hasn't cleaned moldy inside  excited try gyro but found sauce bland sandwich stuffed much lettuce wasn't enjoyable  Dang  I keep searching best gyro around hope someone control reads restaurant deep cleaned! <EOR> I stopped grab quick lunch honestly say tasty filling meal   someone quite few authentic phillys self proclaimed philly steak snob pretty critical sandwiches    When walked greeted friendly young woman  ordered regular beef philly which comes mushrooms grilled onions cheese I opted white American cheese    bread perfect good texture wasn't falling apart also soft   meat pretty good too     However going take off few stars because think meat could used more seasoning  Based off previous reviews see why owners blanded down bit which shame   As waiting food cooked something extremely odd happened  Two dogs ran into restaurant back through kitchen   dogs which escaped dog grooming place next door being chased older man STRUGGLING keep up   Although dogs only building few moments philly steak owners pretty upset made sure thoroughly clean everything before proceeding cook   gave them A+ book     If owners could manage lower prices bit add more flavor meat then would regular! Until then return try some other options menu still recommend people check place if they're looking convenient bite eat  <EOR> Needed something eat lunch  Decided healthy try place out  I ordered philly cheese steak sandwich everything meat cheese mushrooms grilled onions Cashier asked if wanted spicy jalapeños said sure  Waited 10 minutes sandwich  sandwich came same time person me  Place wasn't busy Wednesday around early lunch time  Sandwich came piping hot wait few more minutes cool down  The sandwich looked big  was! stuffed end  couldn't imagine getting meal added fries    eat! LOTS meat delicious  Great flavor very tender  meat kept falling eating tells LOT! jalapeños added kick sure! wouldn't add them unless really spicy   Overall sandwich met expectations philly should taste  absolute favorite ever but if you're looking PHILLY SANDWICH NW place trick  <EOR> My husband wanted fresh veggies kabobs glad found place  back 3 days row!  beef kabob $8 99 rice fresh salad yummy cucumber sauce ground beef kabobs fantastic tasty tender   chicken kabobs also just tasty but prefer beef   husband Philly Cheese steak 3 days row  give plenty meat sliced mushrooms onions   He especially loves bread use  serve all sandwiches hot juicy much meat juices very tasty!

Was completely wow'd here? quite  Did experience deserve 5 stars? Sure  back? Yes!   What did wow gentleman behind counter took attitude complete eye neck role woman whose child's order incorrect  thought he handled nicely didn't argue just apologized fixed promptly  Now someone resist throwing cheesesteak gyro someone's throat when they're being over top    that's A+ book    Oh lastly saw another Yelper mention thought menu odd because dogs quesadillas menu   I did see kids menu    Okay maybe wow'd  <EOR> Been meaning write guys review forever!
