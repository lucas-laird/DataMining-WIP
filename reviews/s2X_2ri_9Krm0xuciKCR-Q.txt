ordered Chicken Marsala Veal Parmesan  Both dishes excellent  Because serving sizes large definitely your money's worth here  only complaint full could try any dessert  <EOR> We stayed Tropicana Honeymoon decided dine Bacio night while there  food overpriced average best  same type stuff Olive Garden much much less opinion  menu basic nothing fancy it  entrée ordered stated Prosciutto clearly Bacon  Yes am aware close relationship each other but consider myself somewhat foodie know difference between two definitely Bacon   As service pretty poor  staff friendly but service incredibly slow   place small busy seem adequate number people wait staff accommodate everyone  I'd guess each server roughly 3 table section which former server myself hard manage all  wait good 10 minutes just put drink order then another 10 minutes until bottle wine brought us  table next which being ran different server must asked basket bread half dozen times time paid check left still hadn't received it   All all pretty disappointed  am hardcore pasta fan looking forward eating passed way room all say let down  <EOR> Took date mission try any all legitimate Italian restaurants town new ones pop up  slacking trying Bacio finally wanted check off list  reservation Nicole hostess friendly walked 2 top  next window over looking pool  restaurant looks very Miami white everywhere  looks very nice though    They bring bread olive oil balsamic vinegar table would describe small gravy float  taste very good but then  problem gravy float type container olive oil balsamic impossible correct oil vinegar ratio because balsamic sinks bottom dish deep vinegar without oil washing most away  quality great but shallow saucer same mixture would much better    The serve comes appetizer drink orders  date orders glass wine very nice wines list order Aperal Spritz  server comes back minute says Aperal wine pointed liquor wine  He comes back shortly both drinks  spritz made perfectly  waiter new Bacio just didnt know menu very well only 6 cocktails choose from   For appetizers She orders Cesar order Caprese  She enjoyed ceasar caprese  good well  Great quality tomatoes olive oil Bufalo mozarella  wish larger pieces basil though micro slices instead  Different but didn't really take away great quality just would loved more if larger pieces basil    We order entrees she orders Tagliolini Neri ai Frutti di Mare she moos seafood order Salsa Rustica Spaghetti Buffalo Mozzarella  dishes perfect wait  portions fairly generous quality ingredients  She really liked Frutti di mare pretty impressed pasta  pasta cooked perfectly sauce nice  pasta much better twice big better flavor Scarpetta Cosmo few dollars less   Side Note While eating Carla dining table right behind guy suit  She attractive women pictures accurate she looks some stock photo 1982 many chefs celebrities use  several times during meal she talking venting divorce Frank Jr  RAO's  Getting emotional only imagine be  am always mind own business unless someone business  just feel inappropriate unprofessional chef owner vent anything where public hear see getting emotional issues diners should no business hearing  take kitchen stay home if can't keep together  easy caught emotion but professional time place your business isn't it    Now Dessert  decide share Tiramisu  am Tiramisu connoisseur  favorite dessert all time  Cannoli well but Tiramisu top pile  dessert pretty specific ingredients yet every restaurant seems such drastically different consistency flavor presentation  also part intrigue dessert me   portion size fairly large very nice presentation  2 small cookies plate Tiramisu  favor Tiramisu different  bad way but way prefer either  creamy but coco espresso favors didn't balance right other flavors  bad just wasn't impressive rest dinner was   2 cookies size half dollar best part Tiramisu  star something would really find traditionally    To appetizers meals solid 4 stars  Very good food  server decent even though server didn't seems know menu all well  ask server dessert instead suggesting trying sell  He nice friendly guy he could just use some more experience Bacio  would say he 40 wasn't lack experience general just Bacio  unprofessional behavior Carla bit disappointment even though didn't take away dinner   reason am giving over all 3 stars because small downers even though easily solid 4 star restaurant maybe just off night date went  love name Bacio place too  <EOR> We watching show last night Tropicana   four party two Chicken Parmigiana past

Then appetizer being forgotten server never even checked back us   top off table wobbled which extremely annoying  very disappointed   I really felt food good but if going charge prices should least

Bread basket varied yummy  arugula salad start which pleasantly larger expected fresh delicious  Clark K  some sort large ish dish piled assortment fried seafood which looked good  pastas good but nothing special I penne alla vodka but definitely no complaints  Wine average tirimisu amazing  Pacing meal right target   In all truly lovely enjoyable experience good value  restaurant very new open white crisp  They're definitely working impress which works any customer's advantage! would definitely give shot if you're staying Tropicana area  recent renovations really sleek here's hoping more great things Tropicana! <EOR> We decided restaurant because wife just try squid ink pasta   If want try restaurant should seriously reconsider temper your expectations   Got off horrible start when pulled into Tropicana tried valet park car   3 cars front 3 cars back 1 valet guy running around trying park all cars   Literally stood valet 15 minutes just give valet guy car key   Even funnier 5 door men standing around watching all cars congregate   1 valet guy but 5 door men      excellent use resources Tropicana   Carla if read seriously need move different place   Tropicana 30 years behind times   honestly would return restaurant just based terrible valet parking alone   Once restaurant quick wait then seated   decor looks homely kitchen kinda thing but prices high end restaurant   good combination   pretty nice bread plate some olive oil start   appetizers mussels white wine broth   Very well done favorite dish here   wife tagliolini squid ink tomato sauce various seafood   Dish okay but don't think squid ink added anything dish except color   oriechette mild sausage brocoli rabe   mild sausage mild thought almost no taste sausage   green sauce dish itself kinda bland   also side dish peas proscuitto   While taste okay peas dull green color wrinkled which leads believe frozen peas fresh   Just more disappointment me   Lastly sit almost 1 hour before received pasta dishes     I wanted restaurant but don't think anything would want back  <EOR> Five stopped breakfast  Service good  Breakfast just ok  But some people table loved food  <EOR> Great food if pick right items otherwise overpriced mediocre   Our favorites eggplant fried risotto meatballs  pasta dishes just average  twice  first time chicken parm parpadelle Alfredo both weak especially $30 plate   The next time smaller dishes shared baked pasta much happier way even though cost same previous visit   The price kills star rating  If more reasonable might give 4 but price almost 2 5 stars humble opinion  <EOR> My wife both enjoyed experience  Food wonderful service  Only negative wine ordered  However wasn't hard find plan B  definitely recommend return  <EOR> Our biggest problem Bacio inexplicable length time took when ordered meals arrival table  hour fifteen minutes despite being only TWO seated tables entire restaurant Thursday night   Our waiter whose name wish could remember amazing attentive polite personable honest  He did best he could given other let downs experienced during dinner    As meals all very divided  ordered some sort veal dish which really enjoyed BUT better veal numerous occasions  forgettable albeit filling meal  father in law veal prepared different fashion salty taste  husband surf turf combo special decidedly best meal table  other two members party salad lobster ravioli which fine  good but again they've better  mediocre experience when Vegas kick notch mediocre    Bacio exudes upscale modern vibe but falls flat taste bud department  Vegas must  <EOR> We ate brunch twice since staying Tropicana  Both times receieved prompt attentive service very friendly staff  water coffee cup never made past half full before being refilled  Monday $3 cocktails which made bloody ary even better although surf turf bloody mary first around better flavor spice then second one    The first time eggs benedict which overall good tasty hollandaise however felt poached egg could cooked better more egg white  yolk perfect   husband pork belly skillet which delish    The second time he something seeeter cronut french toast which croissant fried into donut made into french toast  Super sweet but if like do then heaven  crpissant sandwich which filling wonderfully melted gruyere each bite    It pricier thought little restaurant should but given convenience worked us  <EOR> Day restaurant week experience far best italian dinner long time  Carla Pellegrino's cooking eating hot dinner right grandmas kitchen Sicily  The pre set menu restaurant

restaurant terrace setting into casino  if seated see people walking noisy but nothing eating Hard Rock Hotel  ambiance would great special occasions romantic date  wine list overwhelming quantity

chicken parm which biggest chicken breast ever seen  it came large plate breast took whole thing  it served solo  we also ordered salmon spinach dish  salmon cooked perfect flaky lightly seasoned spinach sauteed perfection  not overly wilted over salted   3rd course dessert all three offered tiramasu soft light rummy yummy sorbets perfect light dessert cleanse palette lil one Ricotta cheesecake  fluffy sweet but just enough creamy goodness begging more   we ate family style could enjoy all tastes  my daughter brought notepad pen when she asked paper drawer  the service impeccable  they cleared plates cleaned table ninjas  then all off sudden food dropped Roland server  although other patrons started complain ticket times once restaurant busier 8pm  roland handles everything professional ease  even if wait 20 30 minutes entrees well worth it  this little known place  but new favorite restaurant night out  its located tropicana which total remodel suprisingly very miami chic  it no longer old person smoky smell casinos downtown do  so would dine again again even regular price   over all winner highly reccomend it!!! <EOR> Tucked away Tropicana over looking pool
