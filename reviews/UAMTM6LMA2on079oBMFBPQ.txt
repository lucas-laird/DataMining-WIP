On flip side lobster roll way much seasoning especially SALT!!  literally eating salt lick dried toasted New England style hot dog bun   lots fillers too   stuffed lettuce celery something anyone New England would tolerate lobster roll   course didn't matter since couldn't even remotely taste lobster entire mixture tasting prepared big block salt   When gentleman behind counter asked everything tasted did bring saltiness lobster salad attention   asked if he made lobster salad rolls big batches he said yes   advised he ought taste salt levels extremely unbearable   He then proceeded tell another customer commented salt level particular batch seemed saltier usual  Thus seems actually don't lobster salad big batches but rather big batches   However biggest faux pas wasn't extreme saltiness mixture but rather complete lack any effort right customer   All gruff sorry that   I used live Boston   know good East Coast seafood supposed like   it!!

However doesn't mean isn't delicious! breading still little flaky heavy weighs down flavor seafood  Even though breading lacks seasoning times I wouldn't mind them adding some salt pepper granulated garlic herbs etc give little more character when encases something flowered onion big stick mozzarella cheese very few negative things said experience  added some seasoning BAM! Dunk those fat cheese sticks into great marinara sauce appetizer  nothing but pleasure while eating version Chili's Awesome Blossom  waistline may hurt little eating app's but hey can't hurt once while!  Onto entree's Calamari Popcorn Shrimp  Oh deliciousness  said breading needs little more character but wow know cook food perfectly  shrimp nicely sized tender while helped added crunch breading  portion size quite large if stopped eating when should would still some pieces left next day  calamari perfect  Served marinara sauce almost forgot simple breading fact add little extra seasoning some lemon just right  love give rings actual calamari itself when serve you  FANTASTIC   Now onto fries  If crisp somewhat over cooked french fries your place  If okay slightly limp fries but fantastic seasoning place go  normally fries crispy but when put seasoned fry seasoning potatoes forgave lack crunch dove head first into massive pile carbohydrates front me  all those say fries terrible please admit liking type fries before bashing potatoes actually very good bring meal full circle  Just tip THEM SEASONED  Otherwise they're just predictable should try keep interesting   All all should solid 3 5 stars but because Yelp refuses apply half stars reviews push 4 because service friendly restaurant clean well maintained hey any place safe eat plenty other restaurants book!

My 11 year old daughter allergic gluten dairy always easy eat her  started researching places she could eat Vegas weeks before there  Lazy Joe's kept popping lists decided give try  bit drive strip but well worth it   We talked Joe daughters allergies he showed menu she could couldn't eat  She opted chicken tenders which made dairy free well  also tried onion which polished off gluten loving teenager family   Everything delicious!  The 11 year old declared chicken better mine said made sparkles rainbows mouth could lack sleep talking though!  All all left full happy back next Vegas vacation! <EOR> Great food incredible customer service! celiacs almost everything gluten free  Would definitely recommend place anyone  <EOR> Urgh  realized only reason anyone ever because gluten intolerant but still want fish chips would shot back parking lot faster entered it  But alas no idea  3 other people spent $60 various fried fish chicken each own little meal  When arrived many people inside long wait food come unexpected  seemed some miscommunication between order taking order making meant other people food before ours since aspect least 3 orders off some way  Kudos them realizing most errors before giving food then trying fix them but boo making wait long offering some reimbursement dessert something waiting  ended even getting right kind fish but just let because feared would remove entire plate wait another half hour something else wrong    If you're gluten intolerant lot more tolerant waiting am maybe Lazy Joe's  If just want some fish want now somewhere else! <EOR> Rude ignorant  big foreign guy presented w reataurant com coupon voucher he looked crazy said prices  already low coupon voucher already week old  said no expiration he mumbled foreign language gave back coupon   just rude  both Restaurant com lazy Joes business     <EOR> For gluten free eaters place awesome! bit expensive side but then wanted try everything while chance  location pretty far made most it   The staff super friendly cod great!! Next time try chicken because miss chicken tenders quite bit  mozzarella sticks bit salty but still really thankful fried breaded crunch missed much  Obviously different batters used eat but pretty good   Thanks having great gluten free place! <EOR> Last night craving fish chips Jack Box fix   Sadly discontinued item   next morning yelped around look places eat stumbled across place   name restaurant all Fish Chips    ordered Cod fish regular fries bit skeptical because price bit higher normal fish chips jack box   But flaky soft tender taste Cod made realize fish chips should taste old soggy greasy fish jacks    The fried delightful surprise made whole potatoes seasoned perfectly!  hush puppies along Cole slaw topped overall meal   Customer service also A++   Overall gave place 5 star great food customer service little extras gives your meal variety taste! <EOR> When placed order nervous ad I'd never eaten before but really wanted fish chips     Boy am glad went!

Awkward moment    Joe being helpful reading ingredients off drink bottle because food allergies  SOMEONE'S GRANDPA! some respect! We Las Vegas friends  think spent grand total $5 slot machines  But two kinds fried clams again? Heck yeah I'd back!
