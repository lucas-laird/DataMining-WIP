Extremely rude  very cheap portions  high price pay expect decent amount food  But way here  load your plate mostly 20lb s raw onion top 10lb s salad  Throw literally 7 french fries 2 small pieces meat ask $13 meal! Ridiculous! made phone order 3 pork chop meals came around $45 asked lady taking order small side cucumber sauce she rudely said yes! $5 95 told only wanted very small amount she said no! buy whole bowl! Come on! We're paying $45 give freaking dipping sauce! Cheap people  Over priced  very tasty food  take forever!!!!! Extremely long waits here  <EOR> Decided stop Saturday afternoon quick lunch   We walked welcomed asked sit anywhere we'd like     Sat down waited   and waited   and waited     Ok really wasn't long wait maybe 5 minutes but   the restaurant wasn't busy server just standing front restaurant doing nothing     Our server finally came over gave menus took water order     We asked server recommendation appetizer she recommended smoked salmon  brief misunderstanding which two deciding on      When salmon came out   it glistening   absolutely DRENCHED olive oil!  Why?  Smoked salmon doesn't need anything its delicious its own   my bf  tried small piece each sent back   sent another far less oil tasted much better   The hummus ok  better store bought hummus but also WAY worse   lot oil pooling outside hummus dish well but doesn't really bother much   I've seen worse   I'd liked just hint more garlic batch hummus but good enough fella ate he's biggest fan hummus   I ordered grape leaves which very good    Although   I asked if vegetarian not care just curious because them both ways server's response was Oh yes vegetarian   know just rice meat  Um   what?  meat isn't there?    The redeeming quality keeping 3 star review instead 2 stars kababs    The beef chicken kebabs both tender juicy very flavorful    The rice served overcooked slightly salad served once again touch much oil but flavor meat wonderful   I'd try place again perhaps off day?  deliver right around corner where live definitely back order in  <EOR> First things first huge carnivore consider myself meat expert  pretty much tried all love all  meat yummy but coworker some meat confusing    If memory serves #19  Some plate awesomeness beefy goodness then some pork chop looking things at least picture!   waitress asked if wanted lamb pork decided lamb based Yelp reviews  beefy things kafta kabob + steak insanely tasty  Then came lamb   sad thing still confused whether ate lamb pork! know ridiculous! pale whitish pork but size taste lamb well sort of!   never seen white lamb uber confused? Neither nor carnivorous coworker could figure out  LOL   She chicken platter thing served those chicken lula meatballs  She found them disgusting found them tolerable  Definitely something would order again    As others mentioned decor bizarre  You've casual tacky laminated menus you've decent prices but you're dining seems hotel ball room  bit odd!   Overall I'd back but I'd probably stick beef  <EOR> Soooo delicious! loved musician singing diferente languages talented man! created very fun environment made ladies dance! Thank you!
