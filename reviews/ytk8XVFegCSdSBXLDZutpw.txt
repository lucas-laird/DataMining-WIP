Asked bill split but wasn't when received it  Hopefully correct future  <EOR> This first time visiting Bachi Burger location  usually Windmill location but just recently discovered somewhat new location five minutes away house  First impression walked seemed chaos  hostess seemed overwhelmed amount people waiting seated although probably only 3 4 parties ahead me  Then proceeded tell wanted order to go  He then politely asked sit bar he would momentarily  However he must've forgotten because found myself sitting over 15 minutes  Luckily person behind bar asked if needed anything  She took order me  ordered Kiki burger salt pepper fries   Also side note tried call advance order food but no answered phone! called twice  Before even food already annoyed service  waiting food observing others  looks some look annoyed too  Just want food!! <EOR> They rid Happy Hour menu result seems place empty   all alone   Food good though burgers cooked ordered   outstanding part caramel shake 5 stars! <EOR> I love bachi burger coming since original location years ago  Russell location good strip  Russell location messes order every single time come time blamed no onion burger CLEARLY onions eventually manager come apologize server being complete asshole  Everytime come girls always bitches don't understand because come once over tip every single time  Love place hate location  Always terrible service  <EOR> Took dad Bachi Kitchen he loves burgers  He ordered wagyu kalbi burger  Both excellent packed flavor  ordered just fries nothing special but bad  started server another caught tail end meal second Elise she awesome  Kudos guys keep doin you're doin!  Only reason 4 stars instead 5 friggin cold brrrrr <EOR> This place never fails disappoint   Kalbi burger yummy always add egg   oxtail fries must try   service bad   drinks pretty good   <EOR> The first time Bachi Burger amazing experience  However multiple times food good but great  really enjoy oxtails fries  selection ramen  service always good they're always nice  just wish dining experience consistent  <EOR> Food good  ordered Kalbi burger edamame Caesar salad beet salad  Prices okay expensive  reason gave them 3 stars don't substitutions  friend ordered beet salad did want blue cheese but Parmesan instead  waiter told okay no problem  wasn't until check he told don't substitutions $1 50 put Parmesan instead  Super fast service probably because place empty  <EOR> First word comes mind inconsistent    Brought coworkers few weeks ago lunch everyone raved food first time trying place  Kiki burger which favorite also really great  Everyone ordered burgers fries pineapple ketchup which delicious    Came back last week all over again experience very different  burgers weren't juicy barely warm  Weird because only people dining time arrived  caramelized bacon wasn't cooked well extra chewy rid nearly all most mushrooms come Kiki burger weren't cooked evenly because some them sliced thinly others very thick  remove most them well  almost completely different burger Service off well sever forgot fries until nearly end meal wasn't around often refill drinks she kept disappearing    I restaurant feel other locations much better but prices high  burger fries drink run between $14 $18 lunch  When ingredients aren't cooked well definitely doesn't worth it    Hopefully fix few things should offer lunch specials smaller burgers come fries  Just opinion  <EOR> First time here  Haven't seen anything Southern California  Food delicious!

When said Omg    waitress said hey don't ordering   Don't shoot messenger  way 3 time sis already food which salmon latke latke potato pancake looks really flat hash brown   omelet followed    missing hash browns  Why wasn't made same time latke we'll never know  Fiancé told waitress missing she said she'll bring right out  Before happened loco came out  patty which now 37 minutes completely raw inside! all asked waitress them cook longer also put omelet under heat lamp before gets cold since STILL no sign hash browns    Waitress said 2 minutes more    Salmon latke still waiting    If wasn't fairly cold dish start would been  time couple arrived 20 minutes eating burgers fries another couple arrived  total 7 diners entire place STILL waiting   Finally fiancé said he hungry experience ridiculous suggested leave   upset because always enjoyed Bachi Burger thought sis visiting Hawaii would love it  Instead all disappointed service nonchalant attitude server manager!! leave server rushed over plates 1 each hand said but going heavily discount your meal    time manager near door looked all then walked outside??? Then he walked back but NEVER came over ask problem was   He didn't even walk near us  He walked back restaurant didn't come again  P S  manager am referring Joseph J  claims foodie absolutely loves smile he put people's faces delivering exceptional food service!  way also passion exceed your expectations every way  Well must your expectations because he batted 0 3 us  he consciously ran situation horrible server situation worse  actually remembered last time but she wasn't server then    did ask something    Again place pretty dead    would estimate 8 people most   wanted add order waitress wasn't seen     asked she said well actually break   could believe she told when restaurant only open 2 hours    Why would even take break during peak brunch hours? While writing still can't believe manager he avoided whole situation   any case left won't back  am sad because mentioned Bachi's food but 2 occasions now   Same worse service experience   3rd time would just shame me    <EOR> This place really seems hit miss both service food  most recent visit only ones breakfast  off shaky start given breakfast menu notify staff  Once given menu immediately asked if ready order  Hmm yet because just menu! Coffee even hot food hot almost sitting while before served waiter never came check until end  seven visits location honestly say last  <EOR> I same time Yami  Took 20 minutes server come table then another 40+ minutes before cook came tell red bean burger ordered and reason chose Bachi tonight wasn't available  She very sweet offered another vegetarian option menu loved it   server said they'd big to go order 17 burgers three other tables all six eight tops dining room which clearly much inadequate number staff  counted server seemingly newer because poor kid seemed nervous bar tender  Three working kitchen  Eventually another server showed but think point damage done  never saw anyone acting manager  table called cook dining room chewed several minutes which resulted big fight kitchen  husband both worked years restaurant business patient food definitely worth it  think just really crappy night them felt awful everyone  hope manager gets things sorted adequately staffs place future because location great love food  <EOR> Great burgers drinks  four five different burgers they're all amazing  newer location busy others    Service always friendly good always fresh  No complaints me  <EOR> We wanted try new burger joint  decide check bachi burger everyone talking about    oxtail cheese fries sounded different which but very good way  sorry forgot name two burger tried but ones tried awesome  ordered grill cheese daughter she loved tried really good too   definitely try again  <EOR> Holy moly!!!

Couldn't even fill piece toast  more jam mix marrow then place into bone  Complained having nothing put toast gave small dish marrow jam which made it  But won't order again  want Bone marrow mix made it   I usually order Kiki Burger it  Totally left gruyere cheese garlic aioli caramelized jam  dry! wondering why lacking  Looked menu noticed left ingredients out! didn't bother complain because complained other dishes   Bachi Loco moco Risotto  usually fave  But Risotto wasn't cooked! wants eat hard ass rice! forgot give Sriracha jam which needed because flavor lacking rice undercooked  ask too  did complain under cooked Risotto  took off bill since didn't eat it   We've never everything ordered crap before  just won't location again  We'll stick Summerlin location  disappointed <EOR> After eating 5th time month ready write review  written before today would given 4 stars  Today's experience 1 star   *General opinion* Bachi Burger creative menu few GREAT items some items great potential but don't quite cut it   What love Ronin Burger Miyagi San Burger   I definitely prefer angus over wagyu  Strangely wagyu very lean while angus much juicer more flavorful   What don't love Oxtail Chili Fries  Sounds incredible right? much chili powder  all could taste  Much overpowering  Bone Marrow  scrape marrow bone mix onion jam ? then put back onto bone  jam nice flavor but  really all could taste  essence just oily jam  Why through extra work when just serve marrow bone jam side?  I've tried several other dishes pretty good but worth mentioning   *Long rant* While less great items not so great items burgers enjoy keep coming back for  However today might LAST time  am thoroughly disappointed kitchen manager cooking today  very sweet server brought daughter's mini corn dogs could see across room overlooked  grayish brown some black spots  took bite sure enough burnt crisp  bitter burnt taste charcoal like texture  sent back but couldn't replaced because last mini corn dogs btw first customers day   Then mother husband all started eating burgers ordered medium  All 3 hard dry beyond well done patties  edges burnt crisp tough chew  kindly let server know she could inform manager  Turns kitchen manager cooking  did offer replace them but couldn't accept offer because already long time two toddlers wouldn't made another 20+ minutes  just ate could burnt burgers  could only stomach 1 4 it  mom half  Another sweet server came apologized offered 10% off bill  appreciate gesture but 10%?

Well love them all but location intimate usually very quiet unlike other busier locations  Location aside am obsessed food  Everything tried ended loving  usually 'create your own burger' where add condiments toppings your choosing  also always truffle fries which amazing  service fairly speedy everyone friendly enjoy coming often eat   There bit downside however  seems usually *minor* problem each time come visit  example asked well done burger rare burger  ask if split check between two people forget it  When ask them correct verify bought friend bought still manage mess up  Again minor mistakes but still little irritating considering never overwhelmingly busy keep making mistakes   However if want try great burger new interesting flavors should definitely check place out  love it! <EOR> Recently ate few friends great!

Food review come    <EOR> I came few months ago closer 4 star place  burgers good service friendly relaxed  first time Bachi fish burger impressed twice weekend even if 2nd time wasn't good first    I don't know happened    When past Friday evening everything terrible service food  wasn't busy but somehow no even bothered water take order more 10 minutes  food took forever come when did come unforgivably bad  ordered fish burger but did even resemble fish burger used crave  burger pretty much fell apart right plate because just mindlessly piled ingredients between two pieces bun  fish fillet tasted lukewarm rubbery watery sauce made bun soggy  lettuce inside burger fell clump soon tried hold burger take bite which point became more tasteless salad without any dressing  left clump salad alone while picked through fish soggy bun fork    I forgive bad service but can't forgive terrible food unfortunately place only good whoever kitchen  star clean decor memories once awesome burgers  <EOR> Finally try Bachi  Great burgers! server very helpful explaining describing menu us  Shuffle fries good well  <EOR> The burgers delicious  Great atmosphere  Lacked good service  Try oxtail chili cheese fries  delicious  also garlic edamame yummy   The burgers unique taste just open mind try them come  <EOR> My friends all ordered burgers    Three  four burgers under cooked actually raw inside  We would asked them cooked more but waitress never came back when she did she very rude unaccommodating  <EOR> stopped quick lunch around noon place empty??? good timing part restaurant began fill ordered!  started basic Sapporo beer friend iced green tea which she said excellent! ordered bone marrow appetizer pretty good came foie gras butter YUM could used couple extra pieces toast though     definitely would order again  friend ronin burger   sorry think good nothing memorable I chose bachi fish sandwich    SCORE!!!

Turns came before bunch when known Bachi Healthy Life   guess converted back Bachi Burger though interior looked same   Two friends impressed burgers found way sweet   She ordered Bahn Mi Burger didn't all sweet sauce which found all burgers think    other friend some special burger foie gras which wasn't very good either   think burger $20 30!  Yikes   third friend Kimchi burger which she enjoyed  Ronin Burger which liked   burgers bc sweet food if you're fan might want skip place   Oh order onion rings really good   usually fan onion rings but made lightest crispiest batter similar light tempura batter really good!  Parmesan Garlic fries thing crisp too   drinks also good   friend some non alcoholic peach drink delicious!  Overall enjoyed meal though few friends didn't   each own though  <EOR> I haven't location yet expected same service Sahara  shocked see dead when arrived only two people 5pm Friday  But least seated promptly!  Our order taken quickly but when needed something while waited food waiter nowhere found when he did come bar kitchen he paid more attention only other table!
