Soups    right best   Hot fresh   only thing would changed Tom Ka soup type mushroom adding little more spice red chili paste    Since Tom Ka soup varied much chef taste region personal preferences did hold back star rating here   Our entrees served 11 30pm piping hot deliciously fresh!

Throw couple fried grilled baked appetizers along some good company yourself fantastic time  can't wait temperature warm bit going Happy Hour spot Tuesday Karaoke Fight Night    The owner Jayson actually very personable which review even more biased because only ate 2 items menu  Chicken wings Satay delicious! But any joint where owner puts sweat soul into food minus real sweat good joint me  really hope spot busier Firefly because love both plaza    Next visit sit patio order everything happy menu beer tower  <EOR> Satay great Thai restaurant frequent mostly because its convenient location aka conveniently next job   service never less satisfying staff very friendly never unusually long wait food when dining in  also take if call  They also offer lunch specials Monday through Friday 11am 4pm  portions also slightly smaller compared entree size but does comes side house salad rice  price cheaper well reflect completely honest think portions perfect lunch size  regular entree portion always equals leftovers me  Pad Thai 9 10 I love pad thai here  also offered lunch special yay! much say other restaurant's pad thai does suck  Pad See Ew 9 10 Also great dish if you're fan flat rice noodles  comes cooked w Chinese broccolli your choice meat  offered lunch special  House salad 5 10 Not huge fan tbh  Sauce okay touch egg but just huge fan it  eat all when side lunch special but would order it  offer small large size honestly small good portion  Nasi Goreng 10 10 I would consider absolute favorite dish Satay! fried rice dish  which says lot since huge fan fried rice  shrimp squid tofu fried egg  sure dish but am fan would hesitate try again! only offer dinner portion fairly large   Overall price point teeny bit higher other local Thai restaurants but food does disappoint! <EOR> I know really busted balls place first round but hell paying customer expect little decency  1st round just left never ate fair ordered take out some pork rice some little egg roll taquitos Im quite sure other overdone  meat pretty decent real tender looked good but any flavor dipping stuff kinda orange marmalade stuff  jasmine rice really dry just flavorless which guess most rice but some soy sweet n sour mine  cost $9 50 still hungry eating this  good bad just plain little pricy  <EOR> So want eat Thai food Class great place go  love coming grabbing Singha beer just relaxing eating favorites Thai food! favorite dish Spicy basil beef must've recently changed recipe because vaguely remember beef being more ground beef  sad changed but its still favorite dish there    Food 4 5  best top two Thai Restaurant options Las Vegas   Service 5 5  Friendly pushy attentive   Value 5 5  Generous portions just right even lefts overs later   Location 5 5  Close but close Strip great place dine grab couple drinks right before head night town    Parking 3 5 share parking lot couple restaurants which busy during peak hours  sometimes park quite far walking heels suck but its understandable  <EOR> I intrigued Malaysian menu seeing some dishes grew nasi goreng mee goreng beef rendang variation Indonesian soto ayam  called Laksa menu  name satay always synonymous parent's Indonesian heritage dishes  served along killer bumbu satay peanut sauce   place lot live yet tread lightly only Malyasian establishment know Vegas  The setting very modern clean ample seating  greeted seated promptly friendly waitress  We ordered appetizers share definitely wanted try roti canai which flatbread similar naan but greasier served curry dipping sauce  must curry flavor very intense  enjoyed but wish served little bit more flatbread enjoy more just small portion strong curry sauce  Next Korean beef jerky which ok  beef good marinated bbq flavor but bit more chewy thinly sliced would liked  came tangy sauce couldn't quite figure out  Thai sticky rice disappointing because expected more glutinous sticky rice come out  chicken satay pretty good well marinated  peanut sauce did taste peanut sauce flavor masked something else  interesting   We would come back try some main dishes menu but fear childhood going another Indonesian family's house dinner measuring mom's cooking   which miss dearly  At least doing Satay Thai Bistro! <EOR> Reasonably priced   if vegas want mix your taste buds place good thai food   the restaurant itself relaxing environment amd staff good   order alacarte share enjoy variety items offer    <EOR> Had lunch Friday 5 other coworkers   Usually everything well but service Friday point   waiter did check food served   believe name Daniel   checks delivered without asking if needed anything else   seemed waiter's phone required more attention   manager's attention pick checks bring to go container because back office   lunch period speed service key   need think place twice lunch option  <EOR> This probably more surprisingly good Thai restaurants town  While doubt overall knowledge staff Thai cuisine friendliness professional demeanor this  lunch special reasonably priced definitely good portion size considering relatively inexpensive menu  eaten before but forgotten good really is  don't know evening experience but mid afternoon quite hip relaxing  If you're area great value! Also note Malaysian Indonesian dishes which available addition also fused within some menu items  definitely return! <EOR> So tasty!! combo satay had check namesake course Roti appy  Both chicken beef satay spectacular  Very tender didn't wrestle them off skewers  Very tasty tender great seasoning can't wrong peanut sauce  roti recommended bartender server also tasty curry sauce dip but also great peanut sauce satay   roti before loved it  Its almost pastry like crisply multi layered greek phyllo but more stretchy  particular more greasy would like  ask adjustment next time should perfect  Its almost Malay version chips salsa  caught chef spying kitchen sure liked food  pretty cute  Haha    Looks cool lounge scene evenings too  Comphy modern low couches set very social layout  Totally chill worthy    I'll back sure  Service great prices also look very good Vegas  <EOR> My husband wanted Thai food found place real close where staying  location easy shopping center many other different types restaurants  food pretty good  favorite dish spicy basil  reason low rating due fact overcharged which caught them fix also people working friendly  felt annoying them being there  probably won't ever return many other other places try  <EOR> Unimpressive Thai food   I ordered Tom Yum Soup Thai hot sour soup Chicken Pad Thai   The soup bland overload mushrooms  love mushrooms but bland soup where mushroom also no flavor bit overkill    took few bites before setting aside    When Pad Thai came looked delicious! Unfortunately didn't taste good looked  pretty dry hard chew ended adding few spoonfuls Tom Yum soup break apart noodles easier eat  Sad say didn't finish nor take home    The server nice though! He both working bar serving tables  He's only reason giving place 1 star    I back because food recommend place good Thai food  <EOR> Very quick accurate service!

Tom Kha seafood soup  flavor really good gave generous portions seafood  yellow chicken curry amazing  Highly recommend! <EOR> My friends visiting LA  Initially going tapas restaurant across parking lot but place packed decided Thai which fine because we're all Thai food lovers   When party 20 just seated  waiting forty five minutes table when place even packed seated ourselves because staff busy seat us? sat dirty table bused asked buser bus table  He very polite customer oriented   Our waitress then came over took order  did see hear server litteraly HOUR  growing impatient finally attention busser explained knew he server worked restaurant before wondering why haven't served over hour he politely manager  manager came over said busy when only 3 other tables party 20 but still    customer service really lacking   If busy back should made good customer service which definitly lacked! 5 dinner each ordered own dish yet each dish came litterally 30 minutes apart each other     really odd   Anyway end all manager obviously knew he fault he offered free dessert for all five share   He did offer give discount food   We litteraly restaurant 3 half hours  Waiting  ridiculous   The food great but definitly worth wait horrible customer service    My thoughts should've just waited tapas restauraunt <EOR> Yes first Yelp Event yes feel better person attending!
