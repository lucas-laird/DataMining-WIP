Yagyu true JAPANESE style yakiniku restaurant  Umm except serve some kimchi   No lettuce cups though   Just meat simple dipping sauces   The quality beef especially boneless short rib kalbi excellent   Definitely prime   Upgrading any kobe style cut worth added expense   Incredible fat content thinly sliced beef cook literally seconds melt mouth tenderness   Because fat looks little food quickly fill up   Don't over order staff quietly snicker you   The beer really super cold refreshing palate cleansing goodness   Yakiniku supposed engaging fun but if cooking your own food getting saturated heady smoky beefy aroma your thing I wonder if ladies scent guy? would recommend try another Vegas' great dining adventures   Be sure check face book page groupon offers   food justifiably pricey savings help   Recommended  <EOR> It good but overpriced   sorry but hot dogs? gave fancy name  oh no never again <EOR> The first time Yagyu wasn't super fan  think back moment time remember thinking expensive would rather real deal Korean BBQ place could stuff face yummy banchan instead having pay kimchi la carte  Booooo!
