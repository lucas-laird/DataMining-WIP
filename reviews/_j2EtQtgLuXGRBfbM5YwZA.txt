The problem isn't first time received treatment Noodle Asia  previous trip Las Vegas another situation which seated 20 minutes left  actually asked two servers if order could taken said would right back  But still nothing   Once food arrived however all worth it  hot sour soup well hot sour  concept! also ordered Night Market Fried Rice which fried rice sliced beef Thai chilies bean sprouts basil diced tomatoes  Don't believe menu claims rice spicy but incredibly flavorful  basil flavor lingers throughout each bite sliced beef tender delicious   The Pot Stickers clear winner day  dough super thin frozen pot sticker style  Instead thicker creating great crust where pan fried but leaving nice bite through rest dough  pork inside wonderfully light ginger flavor  added touch appeared simply soy sauce green onions well some chili paste give little kick  result flavor explosion mouth never tasted before  must order   We also tried Red Won Tons which quite successful  which also listed spicy menu but pork fillings tossed Szechwan Hung Yao chili presented garlic sauce  pork tasted similar pork pot stickers but garlic sauce incredibly oily tasted almost burned ending unpleasant texture taste mouth   But well worth it  just basics  can't wait back try some more! <EOR> My favorite place when Vegas!

They flat rice noodle therefore server recommended si jiu beef noodles   beef sauce poured over bed crispy thin egg noodles   generally good dish bad all   beef very tender liked noodles once absorb sauce   The combination fried rice just OK   tasted fine yet something very plain it   add hot sauce wouldn't boring   Instead having slices meat some meat shaped little rectangles making seem very cheap   Sooooo considering casino Vegas bad choice asian food   own preference would rather elsewhere   PS Depending where sitting also watch sports TVs right outside restaurant  <EOR> Authentic BEIJING BEEF NOODLE SOUP good best Beijing    Even Bejing hard find better Bejing Beef Noodle soup enjoy Noodle Asia Las Vegas  <EOR> My boyfriend staying Venetian came dinner  food great servers super friendly  highly recommend potstickers! <EOR> Just hot sour soup    rest just ok   Pho weird    boil bean sprouts    Crazy <EOR> As tell picture only iced tea good   I've never Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup hard say if simply fan if just done well  noodles extra soggy 'beef' all fat  should've trusted all fellow yelpers ordered this  Lesson learned   I say woman rang nice previously mentioned chrysanthemum tea good $4+   <EOR> Got seated bar menu etc  Another waiter told leave manager no backbone resolve mess  food ok but place run poorly  <EOR> Yes everything overpriced but restaurant Strip inside five star hotel casino isn't?  Unless getting comped meal just expect gouged   just focus other aspects   It's great place quick casual meal late night snack   am Cantonese can't speculate authentic but when am eating ethnic place   works there?  All Chinese check   cooks?  All look seasoned veterans check   eats there?  Many Asians check   Passes test authenticity   It's functional place some counter space next open kitchen utilitarian tables  Service uneven   read other reviews service neglect but personally experienced would consider service neglect more half dozen visit   Appetizers overpriced I know said would try mention price especially dim sum stuff   still love potstickers   Chinese broccoli oyster sauce nice vegetable side dish   Hot sour soup definitely hits spot every time   Love buddha feast pan toasted noodles mixed seafood pan toasted noodles   Both come generous serving vegetarian stuff seafood   Overall while expensive close real Chinatown gets Strip  <EOR> Huge mistake  figured such classy looking place would real chef rely MSG  ate soup For while literally eating bowl hot water MSG  Now deal headache  <EOR> Un bon resto de Vegas ça existe oui ! dans le Venetian    Cuisine asiatique et goûteuse portions généreuses mais raisonnables les nouilles chinoises étaient bonnes tout comme les rouleaux aux légumes   Choix végétarien ou cuisine chinoise classique ce fut agréable sans être trop coûteux  <EOR> good food cheap spicy good portion size   what more u want      Had buddha feast fried rice    yummy       will definitely again <EOR> Halloween VEGAS REVIEW part 7 I love some noodles!

The dish itself delicious felt ate portion easily made 3 4 people  OOPS! bit spicy but point crying although nothing wrong few tears while dining  friend swears shrimp fried rice tried some wasn't blow away all  If closed eyes could sworn panda express added shrimp  Maybe next time dine someone interpret menu guide through jungle Noodle Asia  <EOR> If enjoy below average noodle dishes place you  thinking would reasonably priced meal before show less impressed across board  Calamari balls appetizer better suited playing jacks  noodles spectacularly unimpressive  brought plate basil wilted ask some fresh use meal  The only thing good whole experience didn't last long big window looking sports book  Don't waste your time your money there's McDonalds upstairs  <EOR> Chinese favorite but place really does well  services very fast  sitting down ordering getting your food quickly awesome  mostly eat fish its menu but yes fish plate  asked veggies side  all sauteed garlic which also asked for  very good just wanted  Only 4 stars cause expensive Chinese food  <EOR> After days days burgers Las Vegas bit tired wanted something Asian we actually missed Asian food much!! We came across restaurant accident but when parents' friends saw immediately decided dinner there  said really wanted hot bowl noodle soup  wasn't lineup seated really quickly  took them while bring tea  fact dad ask waiter it  wouldn't say waiter super friendly attentive  While he taking orders he just looking other tables which find unprofessional   The menu big variety dishes ranging congee noodle soup fried rice dim sum etc  took little while decide wanted because lot dishes like  finally decided try Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup ???   sister ordered Fish Filet congee ??? because she wasn't feeling well congee easier digest  mom ordered Snow Cabbage Enoki Mushroom Fried Tofu Noodle Soup ?????????   dad parents' friends all opted Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup ???????   wanted order beef noodle soup but scared would spicy didn't it  My Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup ??? came wonton noodles also called wanton mee   Some people mom dislike flavor kind noodle but fine it  liked texture noodle firmer thus chewier  dish came only 2 baby bok choy    definitely would enjoy more vegetables here  beef stew flavorful but wasn't best ever had  didn't fact half portion meat just fat  expecting more tendons meat price paid pay $15 USD   also cut meat small pieces which made seem lot mean bowl    My sister's Fish Filet congee ??? congee pretty good but definitely worth price considering amount fish filet she had  just decent bowl congee but nothing special it   My mom's Snow Cabbage Enoki Mushroom Fried Tofu Noodle Soup ????????? was     don't even know describe it  definitely didn't look she imagine! looked really messy enoki cabbage all spread floating around    originally came wonton noodles but since mom doesn't kind noodle she exchanged Lai Fun ??   bowl noodle soup didn't taste bad but definitely worth its price considering wasn't piece meat all ingredients expensive all     seems Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup ??????? must but quite disappointed especially if you've beef noodle soup Asia Taiwan before! just comparable!! tasteful but still lacking flavor compared any beef noodle soup restaurants Taiwan  highly suggest anyone visit Taiwan because country food heaven!  In short aren't many Asian restaurants Las Vegas Strip if tired Panda Express would something classier conveniently located inside Venetian Hotel same level casino beautifully decorated more expensive Noodle Asia place go! don't think price justified quantity quality food but nonetheless satisfying meal us  <EOR> My third time getting Szechuan noodle soup still good prior times  $15 00 but always hits spot drinking open till 3 am  Hand made noodles taste difference  Last night much tendon but 2 30 morning maybe running low  Still great spot some Chinese food <EOR> Whatever EAT HERE!! husband ate 2 5 17 Super Bowl both worst food poisoning lives  both ordered dim sum appetizers Wonton Noodle main meal  fair think dim sum noodles sick but regardless would advise against ever eating here  supposed fly following day but sick reschedule flights next day stay additional day Venetian costing over $400 total  case don't believe even filed formal complaint hotel future records  If could give place zero stars would  BEWARE PLACE!!

Beef Chow Fun favorite but still exteremly delicious!!  Minus star price  understand Vegas should expect high prices but rearlly? $45 3 meals    absurd! <EOR> Very poor quality food ate today everything very bland tasting  Fried rice something would cafe zero flavor nothing fried it  Both dishes pork stir fry beef broccoli extra Greasy  All all waste money food poor  <EOR> We coming 10yrs  John usually takes care but now gone  Staff still friendly  I would recommend beef chow fun Chinese sausage egg white fried rice spicy yin yang noodle soup egg noodles  <EOR> As restaurant located inside upscale hotel Venetian going complain food overpriced  Why? Because if you're dining inside Venetian should expect pay double normally pay independent restaurant  inside restaurant really nice though food court setup tables chairs   There direct view kitchen no matter where sit  worried food would take while come since many tables front haven't gotten food  However entrees came super fast! food piping hot tell just came off grill   But quality? Definitely authentic tasting lacked flavor  always add soy sauce more satisfying  think food came off grill little soon almost chefs rush through all orders don't time season dishes more carefully   Bottom line wouldn't recommend place unless you're really hungry don't mind fishing extra money eat sub par Chinese food  <EOR> Was really excited discovering place Yelp because craving Asian food Vegas  hostess greeted Chinese 75% customers Chinese and even American Chinese think assumed would authentic experience  boyfriend ordered Sichuan style beef noodle soup ordered mapo tofu which came bowl Jasmine rice  noodles came fast since guess more people order noodle dishes rice dishes  wait extra 15 minutes mine come  noodle soup actually pretty good did tasted braised meat based soup China but maybe flavor bit intense salty past  Still pretty good though beef pieces soup cube y thus very tender  noodles good quality but sure if hand pulled just bought good quality ones frozen  mapo tofu kind sweet Americanized probably closer kind would Japan Korea rather Sichuan  wasn't bad but wouldn't order again  Tofu also very firm silky  Unless you're dying eat authentic but exactly P F  Chang style Chinese food I'd skip place  <EOR> If don't mind unreasonably high price simple Chinese food craving some decent Chinese dishes Noodle Asia perfect    My parents need daily dose Chinese food while Vegas week ended coming EVERY DAY      We stayed Palazzo main reason convenience  Other top reasons kept coming back 1  Super fast service  2  Large menu mediocre dishes   I actually pleasantly surprised beef stir fried flat noodles ???? good wok flavor them  little oily side but still tasty dish   Other dishes Sesame noodles Dan Dan noodles ??? absurdly mushy  some reason came noodles already chopped up    if expecting toddler eating it  nutty little bits minced pork throughout it    But seriously lacked any recognizable texture appearance      Wonton noodles soup pretty standard  I'd really impressed if messed up    BBQ meat over rice beef noodle soup both mediocre  Don't expect wowed   Portion sizes satisfying definitely shareable family style   On average ordered 3 entrees each time came $50  Def double price ought be  <EOR> Service Very good   Propmt pleasant  Food Polar opposite simply said very poor    Lettuce wraps passable but chicken fried rice egg flower soup absolutely flavorless   I mean shockingly FLAVORLESS   the water lemon more flavor   returning establishment  <EOR> Quick bite arrival     pepper noodles which pick   Spicy lots flavor requisite oil   OK place       <EOR> Chinatown food Vegas KICK!  Came years ago when friends looking some late eats  food okay  bad being middle casino madness anyway    I guess since surrounded REAL cheap Asian food home found kind ridiculous paying almost $20 plate chow fun could back home half price and would taste even better!    This place good if you've really hankering some decent Asian food sea overpriced buffets  <EOR> the waiter helping very rude no patients all name suki zuki worst services ever received especially pricey restaurant would expected high class service  respect ! <EOR> I came since working tradeshow Sands Expo   line always filled business men due tradeshow  found order to go! skipped line ordered via phone  say they'll call when ready   But when checked 15 minutes already done!

Singapore noodles  Pretty par thought would be    I actually sat down restaurant later week   gotta say  as Asian used Asian service customer service standard Asian restaurant  seems gruff Vegas location but just right Asian noodle house  sit down take your order bring food take your money   it  No more no less  busy during show    My friend gluten free regime  She said beef rice noodles great! <EOR> It's hard find good Congee even Chinatown CA     surprise find restaurant Venetian NV    ordered pork special egg Congee which fantastic   bit pricey but think worth bank the congee noodles    dimsum overpriced fried rice   also ordered side jellyfish salad YUM!  If you're craving great Chinese food like REAL CHINESE FOOD    no panda nonsense don't plan leave strip your best bet <EOR> Decent place quick Chinese food strip   Prices cheap but strip Venetian over it   The food quality generally pretty good   soup noodles nicely chewy definitely worth getting   wok fried noodles also tasty crispy   stir fried baby bok choy delicious   Some other items weren't good pot stickers full holes Shanghai rice cakes swimming oil   worst item beef     way over tenderized    Hey Yan can cook!  Take easy baking soda next time! <EOR> The food really great service excellent but right now construction directly next restaurant Venetian really loud  chicken lettuce wraps start then won ton soup chicken fried rice all fabulous! highly recommend food just aware construction puts dent ambiance  <EOR> Right off bat person seating gave off very unfriendly almost hostile impression  Immediately came podium huge line started form behind us  no podium whole time waited probably 20 minutes  restaurant also pretty mellow  soon hostess comes podium thing she starts yelling everyone line against wall  Since first impressions important especially place where many other options seemed really unprofessional   I felt also created environment where people began act aggressive towards well  very uncomfortable group debating leaving right then  seated brought pretty dirty crammed table  dirty napkins ground hairs table plates  just bizarre much bad first impression getting place but some reason still decided stay  quickly given drinks plates hair replaced which all happy with  also ordered pretty quickly everything starting little bit better   15 minutes order waitress essentially says can't cook rice younger sibling ordered because it'll take long them   sister didn't want anything besides she just order jasmine rice  We ordered 3 appetizers edamame came first honestly worst edamame ever had  weird jasmine scent tasted way salty  most part food wasn't bad but just really average  feel just many other options Venetian  <EOR> I remember place 2 years ago when overpriced greasy sandwich American grill place   Now Chinese restaurant total upgrade before   place small doesn't many tables   lucky enough before lunch rush   time ordered food long line people waiting tables   The food delicious!!!  bit pricey but expect Vegas Venetian?

Chewy noodles dark beefy soy vinegary broth lots tender beef chunks  only thing wish some MORE greens skimpy green onions  Perhaps some cilantro onion chopped pickled mustard greens bokchoy other places  Overall delicious but soup gets hella salty towards end warned   Spicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup spicy all  Tastes pretty bland  Its seafood broth chicken beef broth  Can't really distinguish base taste is  Even 2 generous scoops Chili sauce wasn't really spicy  would skip next time however other people liked it   Hot Sour Soup Loved it! wary since some reviews say good but liked alot! Good balance sour opinion lots toppings  Pho Special $18 bowl Pho better good according fellow Vietnamese diners! if can't Pho Kim Long back up!

I being fobby half asian am ordered minced beef over rice egg friends split chicken fried rice   Both very tasty super greasy   Yes food bit pricey side Chinese but since located Venetian honestly expect?  way if drunk hungry middle night while Venetian I'd definitely come back! <EOR> After weekend Vegas Beef Noodle Soup sounded amazing  told authentic Szechwan beef noodle soup waiting Noodle Asia  running late took luggage could head straight airport lunch   We seated right away two each own bowl beef noodle soup shared order Cantonese roast duck   The noodles satisfying  soup good amount flavor noodles excellent chewy texture  better beef noodle soups before? Absolutely but very solid   I'm glad tried duck ok  nice something else munch besides noodles  <EOR> My friend Nay actually super skeptical eating Asian restaurant Vegas   especially if its also hotel    But insisted eat Jeffrey its pretty much best place Asian food Vegas    We seated fairly quickly given water menus  tried find something would help hungover fml dont wanna move stupor finally settled Szechuan beef noodle soup  wait food pretty fast thank lord bc starving 9pm first meal day The soup itself slight kick which made even yummier  chunks beef soft delicious well noodles chewy filling! inhaling bowl soup lifted raging hangover holy shit wanna die mentality  THANK FOREVER omg   My friend shrimp fried rice but kinda bland but plate HUGE  Prices bit high quick chinese food but guess its vegas      Overall definitely come back when wanna kill myself being hungover need soup! <EOR> I ate under influence alcohol readers beware haha! But think even if late night eat ordered pretty legit  sure rest stuff but Szechuan Beef Noodle soup hits spot especially night partying  worth $15 3 5 stars overall  price tag fits Vegas even though doesn't fit pocket book  I'd definitely come back order same thing again next time though! <EOR> My friend wanted some Asian food looked Yelp closest place pretty good reviews  first thing hard find because doing construction inside casino  restaurant located back behind construction  they needed better signage  Secondly place packed higher hopes place  honestly thought food ok did pacify craving but really turned off plastic utensils paper plates   it almost felt eating take out restaurant  service also great  know friend wanted Asian food but place envisioned inside casino  Almost felt should part food court  decor does feel asian diner  <EOR> We brought someone else's food twice trash service trash food  You're better off going food court  <EOR> Service really good but food something your local Chinese restaurant exception prime location long nights gambling where winners come eat where come eat lose slapped hefty bill end     also charge $4 00 hot tea most Chinese restaurants don't <EOR>
