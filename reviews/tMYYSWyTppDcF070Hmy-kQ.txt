Each table booth  assortment squirt bottles full honey squirt away while eat your chicken sandwich   FYI try little Wasabi honey your string fries yum <EOR> Very dry chewy fried chicken  Overpriced  Super friendly people great atmosphere  Raising Canes far superior far fried chicken goes  Maybe place should change name Blue Ribbon French Fries  Because those delicious  <EOR> Why did chicken cross road?  To Blue Ribbon course!   This order and pay then seat yourself and they'll bring you the food kind place  cross between fast food  restaurant     It's southern style comfort food lots condiments choose casual kid friendly environment  <EOR> I am writing review waking find store closed 8 45  mean cleaned ready blow 9 05 closed  When operation cannot something simple honor business hours message just plain CARING     For sake transparency all reviews say enjoyed good numerous times   fan   But seeing crew watch photograph them cleaner closing early no even made attempt offer explanation     Since witnessed evident lack caring suspect other aspects operation processes   Needless say Blue Ribbon consider customer gone   Walked right across street another establishment spent money them  <EOR> Came family late dinner 30 minutes closing  Crew great very friendly! def back!

My husband however thought sandwich the pit great but spotlight experience regular French fries    The staff very nice  Maybe next time just try chicken strip basket sandwich  <EOR> Food hot fresh dry rub seasoning chicken does take bit used to  portions good sized  Three stars solely because seasoning taste   Staff friendly  restaurant clean several TVs watch   The drink fountain your typical cane sugar drinks  Again takes bit getting used to   ginger ale tasty but took bit used to The place more expensive expected  Maybe because Summerlin? Three piece drink including string fries very good plentiful $12  <EOR> Love burgers!! firebird pulled chicken beak butt  Very clean place friendly staff  come back again  <EOR>
