Well don't oysters because friend's birthday where he wanted go  Anyway staff friendly food good price decent! recommend everyone tries Oyster Bar!! <EOR> Everything expect great restaurant found such small place inside hotel too!  The food oysters clam chowder rib eye four times came here   First all clam chowder best ever eaten!  absolutely LOVE clam chowder eating delighted taste buds much mouth almost leaped joy first taste   humble opinion rib eye steak best steak Vegas   Eating other places thought really salty   Personally think bit overboard spices but simply amazing see place advertises oysters yet steak best Vegas!  Very funny sense   Now oysters!  oysters taste great very fresh worth price   time special oysters flown Japan   Six dollars more dozen but goodness worth price!  Once put them your mouth just melted leaving your mouth such ecstasy wonder ever lived without tasting such great food   thing suggest Bloody Marys   thought way salty should balance much vodka use   overpowered tomato juice accentuated saltiness rather little bit both spiciness Tabasco complimentary taste tomatoes   The service Every time came service excellent   never waited long food every few minutes waiter would tell food coming along   Plus kitchen far view could see if lying not   appeased cravings giving needed food   Everyone always smiling which made place inviting     This place should bigger more advertised become places when come Vegas   superb service food restaurant Vegas trip highlights when thinking food   Happy yelping  <EOR> This favorite dad's  think come least once when Woo family trip  Relatively inexpensive compared most seafood joints Strip Oyster Bar Harrah's offers decent food bar atmosphere  literally circular shaped establishment  bar seats around few belly tables surrounds outer corners  isn't much walking space all   Forget salads entrees! think calamari best darn thing menu  batter super flavorful don't really need use dipping sauce  All need squirt citrus yum mouth salivating thought it! Since Oyster Bar def try something Oyster section  those don't raw seafood highly recommend Bouillabaisse Cioppino  mom likes those two dishes lot  <EOR> Great little place   Fast service food wasn't bad bland   Half group ordered $15 special smaller portions but salad      There free bread lots which helped some fill due smaller portions although some still left hungry     Service fast   Table 10 ready minute  <EOR> The pan roast palace station's all   Considering price would think seafood would shelled  not  <EOR> Awesome meal! Ordered cioppino Chef Raymundo asked if wanted little spice added  perfect! spicy just enough bring broth notch  Very attentive servers well worth money  Full perfectly cooked seafood  Would definitely return when Vegas  <EOR> My friend stayed Mirage hotel EDC decided dinner since other friends arrived way later  We're seafood people love seafood    Upon getting seated bar looked menu surprised prices  But hell we're good time let's hope worth money    Ohhhh yeah was  ordered dozen oysters  $28 back home Texas $12 $14 dozen  chose 1 2 lb blackened shrimp $19 best friend chose Bouillabaisse $34 think which assorted seafood clam crab mussel shrimp saffron broth  item liked least Boullabaisse bc lacked flavor but oysters shrimp totally made it  Honestly wished gotten lb blackened shrimp because good  oysters big super clean  Probably best oysters ever everywhere oysters    Would recommend place! Worth money! Left full satisfied! <EOR> Oysters often mistaken food when reality quest  If oyster junkie seek your oyster options well advance  Being somewhat seasonal oysters always menu  past refused dine restaurants which no oysters  Often called well advance try restaurant hold some if felt supplies would running short  even attempted chefs order oysters rather face risk being none  said quest  why when rushing through Harrah's Las Vegas last week catch some show noticed Oyster Bar felt fortunate  stumbled place  Normally search menus find oysters which often hidden which appear only infrequent special  But oyster bar  course back ASAP show found two open seats bar took scene  First small mountain oysters well iced down few feet seats bar  Second noticed cooking station shellfish device which appeared operate steam designed rapidly cooking small batches shellfish  really nice open kitchen feature  server chef appeared moments take drink appetizer order  Sierra Nevada Ale beer good named some mountains it  wife ordered chardonnay  oysters shucked front knew no phony baloney trickery being practiced here  aside many chefs buy jars buckets pre shucked oysters when order comes open small bucket remove 6 12 oysters bucket place them sterilized shells which usually gone thru high powered dishwasher endlessly until shell pure white thin looks no oyster ever inhabited it  Nevertheless much frown upon corrupt practice discovered eating oysters troubling way surpasses no oysters all  But digress  also ordered fish chips excellent key lime mousse also nice house version play now ubiquitous key lime pie  oysters 3 distinct beds all tasted supremely fresh unique  liked lemon wrapped lemon colored wrap green ribbon 50's yes but nice  Service superb food outstanding price right  ready back  Indeed if lived Vegas I'd own seat great oyster bar  <EOR> OMGOODNESS! here!!!!!!!

Good time always <EOR> My friends stayed Harrah's Memorial Day weekend kept seeing posters oyster bar   girls crazy oysters decided check place out   The host waiter I didn't name extremely nice   He very friendly helpful provided great service   friend ordered half dozen Oysters Royale raw half dozen Oyster Rockefeller baked    Both dishes really good although liked Oysters Royale more because both caviar oysters freshness   Although bit pricey $30 both dishes well worth it  <EOR> In search seafood choice came oyster bar online  Looked great group 5 decided walk dinner  Keep mind happened some affiliate companies goofy bunch    When arrived saw busy but front house seemed overwhelmed  needed drink long day creeped into bar space  confused if could order beer if would invading space everyone counter bam greeted happy face brought comfortable area  Beer bloody hand table now ready    Server friendly but didn't exactly match personality some guys table  would see same welcome friendly flexible bartender    First order came platter cold seafood undivided attention deserved  Lobster shrimp clams crab overflowing 18 platter calm any growling stomach  finished Halibut dinner back hotel room thinking food    Seafood=Oyster Bar <EOR> I couple times food good both times  If enjoy raw oysters then place even raw oyster menu detailed description different oysters being served  Some favorite food order include raw grilled oysters New England clam chowder Maryland style crab cakes crispy one sided red snapper! <EOR> Better oyster bar Palace Station because ambiance somewhat better  Sure still noise casino but least shitty rock'n'roll isn't blaring  closer strip too  just sit bar watch open kitchen  chef himself took order    We almost killed ourselves  split bowl clam chowder which incredible  Then came jumbo shrimp cocktail which delicious shrimp jumbo come  Then came O B 's Pan Roast every last drop which sopped bread followed cioppino be sure order spicy  phenomenal  point hoping they'd forgotten them but no  came dozen Oysters Rockefeller good you've ever had  cannot wrong menu  <EOR> We sent lunch  Food just meh  Servers helpful but difficult track down it looked short staffed   bus person very good though kept waters filled bussed tables quickly  main reason low rating because food meh high prices  Definitely would recommend place  Save your $ somewhere else  <EOR> Although particular Oyster bar lot more choices options menu if you're coming purely raw oysters clams which don't raw clams fave other simple Oyster bar goods    Then probably better off heading Palace Station Oyster Bar gnarly unreal reputation  kid place best when comes Pan Roast Bouillabaise all sweet seafood simplicities but line always marvelously long     So come if want decent food without wait  Just don't those expectations  personally debating between Pan Roast Bouillabaisse  reading lot fellow yelpers' reviews talking chef bar chose hoping lighter option Bouillabaisse  Now good came variety bread but doesn't come rice that extra $ just pot  good gonna downgrade it    seafood meat hearty various yummies    But would easily say biggest disappointment little salty  don't even want know Pan Roast would like   Would come again?
