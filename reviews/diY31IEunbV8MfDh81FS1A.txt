The third time came CMYE  order ready within 15 minutes  tried new BBQ Ranch chicken sandwiches which very tasty  However time smashfries soggy much olive oil  also tried strawberry shake which bad   When places fires all cylinders merits solid 4 stars  When things fall flat only barely deserves 2 stars  Until addresses its lack consistency assigning 3 stars  <EOR> Meat dry  mushroom burger wasn't tasty  lacked everything didn't even burger sauce  just meat cheese few mushrooms slapped into bun without any other condiments  Chili fries dripping grease serve them cardboard plate could absorb grease but drenched red grease chili  Sweet potato fries good enough they're better El Pollo Loco  husband baja burger he said wasn't good either  way over priced nasty food  Please don't compare n same page all!!! pictures deceiving cause look good but arent good all  <EOR> Well heard alot place really excited try it  Walking feel your going something different interesting menu flavorful combinations  ordered burger pepper jack cheese guac jalapenos chipolte bun    sounds delicious right? expectations dashed when bit into  burger tasteless oily ad crispy around ages where smashed grill  husband bbq fried onions same experience  tried smashfries oily well  Tasted overcooked frozen fries me    rosemary tasteless  don't know if anomaly many  love place    <EOR> Slow service only register Friday night   line door  Stop cutting your labor some help   never come back!!!! <EOR> burgers awesome place bit pricey way overcrowded during times sides onion strings fries just ok  Definitely must try though least time  <EOR> Went Sahara Fort Apache location   husband son loved but being vegetarian much me   order essentially grilled cheese sandwich avocado bun 1 slice cheese 1 slice avocado but paid just same if meat sandwich   the verdict still out    <EOR> Ok don't understand why place rated high  Honestly tastes much better place way cheaper  Thank goodness groupon  heard people ranting raving place words Shania Twain don't impress much  friend ordered traditional All American cheeseburger smashfries vanilla milkshake  tried fries booo no flavor which shame since sprinkled Rosemary garlic I couldn't taste    I ordered SinCity burger since sounded best burger menu plus many stated best burger  it?
