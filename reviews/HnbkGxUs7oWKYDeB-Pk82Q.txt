Conveniently located inside Venetian clean friendly  Turkey avocado sandwich chicken pesto crepe ice latte  turkey avocado classic side salad super fresh but chips way salty  crepe surprisingly tasty too! But iced latte okay  <EOR> +1 coffee  1 gelato    +1 variety  1 sandwich quality  +1 being Palazzo  1 having Palazzo pricing  +1 late night gambling clubbing hours  1 attracting gaggles drunk assed Tara Reid wannabes  +1 being near garden fountains where sit  1 being next door CUT its ignorant sheep like clientele  See review I don't know judge place   clicked back forth between 3 stars then 4 stars then 3 stars then 4 stars over over again   SO WHAT?  IT? There's no secret place  high priced semi exotic coffee gelato crepe panini shop   just branch Illy shops Italy rest Europe   difference course even exchange rate coffee frickin' Milan doesn't cost much Palazzo location   The sandwiches sort remind salami sandwiches I'd while travelling Milan Torino Cervinia Italy   But none them really very good   gelato same   All melt quickly there's less selection compared Cocolini's    none them really stand out   THE CRUX COFFEE Speaking someone travels Italy often going Espressamente Illy coffee Palazzo kinda going McDonalds Japan   start thinkin' got's name pays $8 99 gotdamned Royale Cheese? Then when taste your burger find yourself goin' WTF?  ain't no McDonald's Royale Cheese  then eat anyway   Because spent $8 99 it   Coffee Illy ITALY really good pretty much across board Smooth lip smacking tasty   Italian coffee general puts Starbucks' liquid burnt umber shame   Nothing beats having cup hot Italian coffee off ridge untouched mountain frost Italian Alps before snowboard down cause avalanche subsequently burying rural village below creating mass hysteria mayhem   Just Green Goblin   Yeah   But digress   Palazzo shop doesn't represent Illy coffee well afraid   feeling don't change coffee frequently should because cups coffee frequently taste little bitter bit acidic aftertaste   Very un Illy IMO   But other hand    best coffee available   mean don't wanna Starbucks hideous Crappuccino you?  You'll hard pressed find better cup elsewhere strip   every time cross over Palazzo Venetian play Blackjack cup go   CONCLUSION Darth Vader Luke Skywalker's father    only secret insight share because Espressamente Illy no secrets pretty much see kind place   just plain ol' ordinary late night snack shop really same level quality its Italian brethren    come because way blackjack tables   You'll probably come some reasonably good coffee if dread Starbucks    but  it   3 stars  <EOR> After dinner LAVO decided some dessert Espressamente Illy because some reviews saw fellow yelpers   tempted LAVO's dessert selections but kept insisting trying place friend because yelp    officially become real yelper where world revolves around reviews read bookmarks try follow!!!

I pineapple ice cream thinking would some Dole pineapple taste  Wrong! There's barely any pineapple flavor! more creamy flavored some kind coconut flavor  hard even tell pineapple without knowing bought it  great   The service really rushed  guy behind counter asked if ready while still skimming through each flavor  Everything looked good outside but $5 50 scoop think I'd rather Sbarro's some Italian gelato ice cream shop  Ciao ciao! <EOR> Espresso its best  Great location Palazzo perfect place pick up! <EOR> Delicious coffee hot won't taste or anything else    Don't wrong fine product illy coffee favorites but illy espressamente shop just little hotter should  Ten minutes later still burning tongue trying sip   sure once cools down little a lot delicious  just sure patience  <EOR> strongest latte cheap sure but  vegas you  husband loved macchiatos just italy     we walked cos looked fast foodie but back recommendations Cut receptionist  glad decided try it  coffee twice we'll try all future coffees vegas <EOR> This cute little shop serves tons gelato desserts even espresso I think cream hearts here!   little stand grand canal area very pricey but refreshing just can't resist when Vegas when rome well venice   <EOR> Gelato good greatest but tons flavors choose keep trying   They tons tasty looking desserts sandwiches coffee  <EOR> Good espressos crepe little over cooked more brown tan Anyways regardless higher prices being casino service could stand improve GREAT deal   folks behind counter appear hate life treat customers same way  If im paying $15 drink crepe expect top level service especially palazzo <EOR> Every time come Vegas stop some treats     This place gleaming marriage between Italian style cafe Las Vegas pretension   inside stylish bit cold side   wouldn't call cozy but fine place stop some gelato many coffee drinks     The gelato some said best Vegas but offer many flavors location convenient   coffee drinks served such variety 4 5 times always getting something different still haven't made way through them all   espressos flavored chocolate frozen coffee granita style there's something every coffee lover   They also serve light lunch fare crepes finger sandwiches   Illy great coffee brand no surprise everything decent quality but also pay dearly that   place far cheap   If you're fan Illy coffee general I'd say no brainer   If you're looking gelato better offer elsewhere  <EOR> `BF come few times before gelato but recent visit tried crepes    I nutella filled crepe scoop hazelnut gelato top  crepe consistency just right Nutella gelato just comfort finest    The surprise BFs shake  He's enough know shakes he cuts fruit gelatos some yogurt    he ordered time half cherry half yogurt  came drink delight reminds those Asian yogurt drinks Yakult   and love yogurty tangy flavor!

Absolutely ludicrous  place disgusting  <EOR> Booooo! Two thumbs down  $5 plain black coffee  even good organic gourmet coffees home  apple crepe nasty  never seen them use raw cold Granny Smith apples any other creperie  return cuz couldn't even eat it  <EOR> Sandwich good but chips salad came worthless   Service very slow employees didn't seem care  <EOR> We came because saw guy eating banana split looked good! lady behind counter just stared us  Guy came over asked want  didn't banana split because used gelato instead ice cream  good combo    Also workers friendly all  lady staring whole time  Weirdo     Never again  <EOR> Came use last resort credit gelato    The prices ridiculously high but  Vegas right?   The gelato wasn't smooth should 6 00+ dollars small European style scoop    I would another gelato place before coming here <EOR> Oh goodness! Best coffee espresso ever! come coffee every morning afternoon quick pick whenever we're Vegas   Just amazing great quality coffee espresso drinks served here   Oh also serve gelato paninis  <EOR> Came wrap panini some dessert coffee  Wrap panini bread all hard  Pecan pie opera cake sweet very fresh  Only decent thing ice coffee  come back food items again  <EOR> Worst $7 spent cappuccino  service terrible charge extra if u want here  elsewhere terrible place  <EOR> This tantalizing cafe filled delicious coffee dessert options! hard select order but since wanted some coffee long drive back LA iced Cappucino Fredo Shakerato $5 85   initially shell shocked prices but then realized really shouldn't be  Considering prime real estate Vegas well few actual coffee shops strip Sin City inflation should've accounted for   The cappuccino itself delicious! Sweet but offensively very strong! running 10 5 hours sleep throughout 3 nights Vegas cup coffee it only comes size 16oz managed keep awake during brutal car ride    I really wished chance try desserts but least know where next time town! <EOR> Excellent cappuccino! Mild but flavorful  Great foam! If want nice cup though state its   Otherwise paper cup  <EOR> Waited usual counter 10 minutes without acknowledgment because barista dude rude look up  Then dork behind counter says new line other side  Wtf? Why bother coming here?! <EOR> Good coffee but people working rather rude don't seem interested being there  <EOR> Hmm    I ordered breakfast crossiant sandwich seriously tasted made home  Nothing fancy it  Even grilled chicken panini $12 wasn't great would thought bread I believe ciabatta? little hard me   The gelato pretty good wide selection choices pistachio the best had lychee which mediocre flavor initially but lost towards end   If just rating gelato would probably give place 4 stars    <EOR> Love little spot Palazzo!  gelato some best ever endless amounts delicious flavors  Sugar Free Mango amazing  fresh tasted just eating mango  coffee looked smelled great but pass time around  $5 50 scoop but plentiful  Certainly would return! <EOR> I came every morning ham egg cheese toasted croissant  know weird but good! also loved fresh squeezed OJ    Also if don't come breakfast highly recommend drink called  Amore   OMG! Heaven cup  <EOR> Excellent coffee good representation coffee Italy but charge 75cents per ORDER dine in  pure ridiculous  pay little more dine Italy France well but 75cents per drinks   Plus already charged $5 cappuccino $4 espresso those alone cost half Europe   If weren't prices place would earn full 5 stars  <EOR> Crepe felt heavy but ingredients appeared fresh    Espresso impressive price charged expected little more   balance off slightly high acidic scale me    Overall probably repeat customer    <EOR> A bit overpriced margherita pizza ordered nonetheless did trick when needed quick innocuous bite eat while hungover Sunday bachelor party weekend Vegas   Weigh rating accordingly  <EOR> My husband wanted quick bite before morning gondola ride Venetian  Unfortunately picked place     First all staff incredibly rude  acted bothering them placing order  Seriously? don't dare ask question you'll some eye rolls  Dude Vegas work restaurant industry should probably learn deal people   We shared chocolate croissant husband coffee  total 12$ even kidding  croissant dry tiny  price paid expected something least decent   If staff friendlier wouldn't moved write review place despite high prices lousy food because just quick breakfast but far better options nearby  Don't waste your time money calories place  <EOR> The affagato sweet creamy!

Crunchy Rum favorite tasted Guava although good it's acquired taste sweet  If you're group don't mind taste testing each  ideal situation  service slow could better  really should more people scooping ice cream 1 doesn't cut it  <EOR> Be careful  cashier upgrades your beverage large without asking  paid $7 00 chai latte!!!!!! love tea but  bit overboard  <EOR> charged friend food when run basically everything menu dont even apologize any mistake? mention menu doesnt even stay date time food availability   worst experience ever <EOR> crepes gelato coffee really good here!!!!!!!  i love place everytime im palazzo stop here! <EOR> great location  sweet staff fast service great gelato espresso  only comment 2 scoops ice cream espresso cost $19 but vegas lol! <EOR> Yes sleek beautiful but staff totally bored unexciting new espresso gelato shop this   quality gelato although presented beautifully only average prices bit much even Vegas standards   Instead burn few calories taking hike over Caesar's pig Payard Patisserie! <EOR> The line place your order poorly organized  jumped being new place missed whole right side shop display cases yummy looking pastries menu   knowing all options just sundae which good 3 scoops  just wish could seen all before ordered  <EOR> freaking expensive but freaking good! never better pistacio gelato! yes yes 6 bucks 1 scoop but its really awesome! hazelnut comes second   can't wait try sorbet next! oh free wifi customers! <EOR> Food saw huge selection gelato upstairs couldn't wait down try some! straciatella great all other gelato flavors looked just delicious   Price bit pricey believe paid around $11 each 1 scoop   Service Definitely crowded but pretty fast   Atmosphere few places sit eat but decided head since alot people here   Location Located Palazzo downstairs shops  Near waterfall  <EOR> Rather wait line 20 people deep Coffee Bean inside Palazzo decided venture few steps further grabbed morning jolt Espressamente     Although pastry seemed bit dry still good Americana stole show   strong but strong perfect way start day     They beautiful and very colorful display gelato but never made back try any     Next time! <EOR> Very tasty coffee   Fabulous coffee concoction menu   Delightful service    friendly willing tweaks necessary   Perfect stop quick pick me before 10 30 pm show! <EOR> I say set place bit bananas  long display case gelato greets center counter where ring occasionally take your order then more display case  Seeing everyone visiting Vegas always little confused lack direction seems bit issue  Alas place lot even though full confused patrons   My order taken double espresso  counter staff energetic efficient  very handsome Italian man making drink even took time ask if wanted enjoy double shot cup *for here* because let's serious nobody likes espresso paper cup   The espresso creamy smooth  perfect sippable snack just need gelato sidekick  <EOR> Not illy's standards!
