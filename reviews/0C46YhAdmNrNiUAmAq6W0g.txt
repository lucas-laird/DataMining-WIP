Return visit  Sad say around 7 pm place empty  really feel owners place hope simply slow weeknight    We ordered curry goat whole fish red snapper  started codfish fritters big surprise another restaurant com coupon they bring basket chips bean dip sorry babe gonna hate later tonite ! As past visits food good home cookin' good  Without coupon pricing might little high goat $16 fish $23 but comes some great plantains cabbage other veggies complete meal    The place might also identity crisis Jamaican ? Nicaraguan ? Mexican ? American ? menu very large    I still place hopefully !  pics attached <EOR> Our only lunch trip Goat Post Tropical Grill Buffalo Drive   small unassuming restaurant owned couple serve waiter chef her    food spans both Caribbean Mexico but Jamaican beef patties jerk chicken spicy fries Jamaican ginger beer soda   pastry shell patties amazingly soft filling provided enough spice keep them interesting   jerk chicken proved spicy tender bountiful  <EOR> This no longer Caribean joint served Mexican El Salvadoran   did eat wanted Jamaican Patties  <EOR>
