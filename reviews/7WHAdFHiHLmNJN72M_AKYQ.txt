Me Yes  Owner want hot cold? Me Hot serve hot? Owner Well know most people usually prefer cold milk tea since better experience   Me interrupts hot? Owner If insist hot  but most people want cold know  want bubbles? Me Yes  much it? taking money out Owner 75cents extra bubbles 5 75 without bubble 6 5 bubbles  Me not happy overpriced tea but tourism area put money table ok want hot milk tea bubbles  Owner still want hot?  Back where began!! while conversing some customers entered owner just left middle conversation turned attend those new customers apparently wanted dine so potentially worth more money never experienced server rude  Btw restaurant pretty much empty  least 3 servers including owner he didn't attend those customers   Meanwhile another server pouring tea yes hot teapot saw that behind counter asked owner wanted Chinese  understand them whole time basically ok does she want? she wants milk tea hot very impatiently   asked last question serve hot milk tea not?? owner again murmured Well know most people usually prefer cold milk tea since better experience  but if insist hot   OMFGGGG matter 6 dollars if offer say just DON'T SAY OFFER IT!
