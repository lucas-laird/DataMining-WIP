I'm vegan used hardly any choices when forced eat restaurants but usually find something halfway decent  Vegas convention hotel tired hungry but didn't reservations food court  grilled veggie bowl  consisted lots sliced eggplant yellow squash brown rice  veggies mushy tasteless brown rice hard rock  actually scared thought broke crown! seemed no sauce seasoning any kind  Soy sauce red pepper flakes helped little  onion rings good though  husband teriyaki chicken bowl  He said smoked chicken really good but didn't any sauce either  brown rice also hard  hard undercooked hard stuck together little clumps sitting under heat source LONG time  Since veggies only vegan choice could see aside onion rings fries won't going back there  must tell lady took order very nice efficient aside lousy dinner enjoying stay Tropicana  <EOR> I first case food poisoning place    First thing ate day slice veggie pizza two hours later extremely sick threw all night severe diarrhea high fever shivering sweat profusely   just sure long those pizzas sitting without heat  <EOR> My usual fave spot good slice pizza  coming 2 years since stayed Tropicana accidentally found it  pizza slice good but price better! $4 75 great! Feb '13 price still reasonable $5 but now July '13 $8 slice?!? worth it!!! guess look new spot unless hopefully raised due holiday  only hope  <EOR> It took last day stay discover place just down ways Starbucks inside Trop   You your free warm chocolate chip cookie if Hilton Honors member   Much more reasonable prices coffee also ordered Fried Egg Bacon sandwich $8 99 Breakfast Burrito $10 99 hold over flight back  price bad  Vegas standards  choose bagel English muffin chose English muffin tasty egg freshly cooked bacon medium thickness cooked crisp  burrito nice hardy hot more ask for? decent size I'd guess probably 10 tortilla  filled fluffy scrambled eggs ham sausage bacon  even came side salsa surprisingly bite brilliant!  Some interesting items breakfast menu available all day Loco Moco Bowl full Hawaiian Breakfast which thought neat   Yes indeed 'Food Court' name suggests but does sell some fresh fruit apples oranges bananas small bakery items pizza sandwiches burgers  <EOR> This review salad wrap portion food court  receipt says Fresh Mix but don't know if technically part South Beach Food Court not  same area review here  Hubby each salads here  choose all your ingredients whipped right before your eyes  lady working counter very accommodating when wanted switch cheese Cobb salads menu  Service friendly  could little quicker but appreciated salad made order  would also note salads surprisingly big could easily shared salad husband  Overall good choice when you're looking some greens  <EOR> WOW!!! Unbelievable slow guys making should otherwise quickie foods!!  conference only 10 min breaks between lectures  came between two breaks grab breakfast sandwich  10 mins line cuz SUPER inefficient taking orders    because plasma screen menu displaying lunch menu when only serving breakfast leaving people mull over orders ALL OVER AGAIN     then ANOTHER 12 mins sammich placing order!!! Walking back meeting now having missed 14+ mins lecture  repost bit let know if worth wait  Likely not   REEEEDICULOUS!!! <EOR> While staying Tropicana past weekend friends decided try cafe spending day pool  Service decent food just ok  However few hours having meals 3 encountered horrible stomach aches discomfort  Gladly didn't any worse other feeling grossed until late night hours    Will recommend place? Certainly but maybe someone better experience  <EOR> Four stars food two stars service extremely slow but taste breakfast burritos breakfast sandwiches fantastic   High quality ingredients made fresh winning combination even though took bit longer expected   Strongly recommend breakfast burrito any egg sandwich bagel   Drinks very expensive but aren't everywhere Vegas! <EOR> expensive disgusting food South Beach Food Court   the only saving grace free  fresh chocolate chip cookies staying Tropicana  If coupons believe $1 50 cookie  absolutely delicious! <EOR> I firmly believe most folks critical would probably give Mom's home cooking single star if thought she wouldn't find out   sat waiting food fully expecting never end ER because it  Reviews bad   pretty dang bad     Here's Prompt polite efficient service  My food very reasonable amount time  A really tasty hamburger fresh bun  Cooked correctly although obviously frozen pattie very good  French fries some won't little skinny ones but favorite tough  take yours  Unlimited soda refills  Clean In reality exactly purports be fast food   find nothing complain about  <EOR> Came back try Calzones  basic calzone Ricotta basil Mozzarella cheese added Spinach Pepperoni   super nice enjoy something good   always order them everytime we're because they're mouthwatering   wait 15 20 minutes fresh well made calzone any day week   Basic Calzone starts $9 $1 each filling  <EOR> Overpriced crappy food  ordered southwestern Chipotle salad flank steak  no idea salads pre made packaged like fast food restaurant   steak topped also pre cooked served cold salad  left still feeling hungry spent $25 salad boyfriend's burger  rip off!
