My good friend Rhonda W  stopped Sirio Restaurant week  met bar where she finishing lemon drop martini tasty tried truffle popcorn provide alternative bar nuts  popcorn good good truffle flavor   The service excellent  hostesses waitstaff all very attentive friendly    Cocktails I Sirio Bellini made blood orange sparkling wine   Appetizer I prosciutto cantaloupe  tasted pretty good  My friend signature Insalata Caprese Con Peperoni Arrostiti Buffalo Mozzarella Tomato Basil Roasted Bell Pepper   turned big ball size tennis ball sitting thin layer sauce  didn't taste bad just wasn't very appetizing appetizer  wants big ball cheese situation?  2nd course I grilled 10oz beef NY steak dijon demi glaze sauteed spinach tuscan fries  steak cooked liking sauce sauteed spinach delicious  tuscan fries basically potatoes cut into thick french fry looking pieces  actual french fries expecting  My friend pan roasted sea bass potato crust braised leeks asparagus crustacean sauce  She liked enjoyed crust    Dessert We both ordered tiramisu  pretty good  liked differed most having nice thin layer hardened chocolate very bottom  accompanied hazelnut gelato   Overall restaurant week menu gave general idea restaurant  food overall pretty good but price pay I'd rather somewhere else  <EOR> Sirio recommended friend  pastas better reported pizza matgherita  Wine selection good but overpriced deducting 1 5 stars this <EOR> We ate Dec 2010 wonderful!  didn't even drink much because running race next day bit confused experience   lived Italy 2 years best Italian since returning states  Everything small portions manage multiple courses risotto cooked perfectly    can't wait return year  P S  Caesar salad = Italian <EOR> Food 3 5 Slightly above medium  oily lacked freshness Mediterranean cuisine   Price 2 5 Overpriced! price simply didn't match quality food   Service 1 5 Very bad unprofessional  All waiters very rude patronizing  Examples only re filled wineglass asking them wine shared cooler took bottle table  When done food took away non empty bottle without asking  espresso served wide thin cups traditional espresso style keeps heat  Result Cold coffee  2 children table didn't server drinks kids friendly glasses chairs kids anything    Do yourself favor find another place  <EOR> Our experience Sirio short complete bust  came restaurant week  Two diners party set veal scaloppine  minute later waiter came noted veal  disasterous really friend aversion onions only dish without them  He looked over regular menu something suitable dug into bread basket  found stale bread rock hard butter  off good start   Restaurant week menu offers 5 entrees should enough hand feed your guests  could more understanding if just before closing but 7 30  Stale bread never acceptable rock hard butter major annoyance  suppose case spreading wasn't issue   It major disappointment  Rather staying seeing meal bad worse left  best ended having fantastic meal Jean Georges next door  <EOR> This inside Aria las vegas recently dinner here   I think its priced above average   may due location  Being vegetarian actually less options eat compared other Italian places  ordered Spinach cheese ravioli other marinara based pasta baked potato  liked raviolis better other dish  Ambiance classy nice interiors nice service but honestly much satisfied food   Average food  Just Yelp A Ok <EOR> Sat cafe front portion restaurant ordered off cafe menu  knew portions would smaller but side dish pasta $22 little steep  asked if $16 caesar main course told side dish $16  Again very steep romaine little dressing  saw salad table next nothing special  drinks never refilled different server came table drinks ordering food delivery check  Quite bizarre  Two small orders spaghetti 1 iced tea $50 without tip  <EOR> Beautiful restaurant great Italian selection believe offer daily features top dinner menu  Although didn't good look open kitchen near back restaurant definitely added character Sirio  service kind slow night came near peak dinner rush took them awhile settled drinks wine which somewhat understandable big party  salad solid expect but Pancetta Wrapped Scallops seriously world  Beautifully cooked seasoned perfectly  highly recommend <EOR> Since alone decided eat bar something am comfortable with   Started glass red barkeep nice enuf let taste 2 before selecting  Following When Rome sentiment choose glass Marchese Antinori  Reserva Chianti very nice balanced dry soft red fruit  No bite acid many Chianti's have  I started clams sausage appetizer thoroughly enjoyed sausage slightly dry clams perfect white wine tomato broth super  Blended very very tasty  For main Linguini Arrabiatta good pasta dish anywhere   I passed dessert preferring drink mine finished glass 18 year Laphroig PERFECT <EOR> Went large group people 40 dined main room  Service outstanding however food not  started antipasto platter Caesar salad  Antipasto good  Caesar salad looked great but lacking flavor  Next spinach ravioli fusilli pastas  Again both lacked flavor  Then swordfish steak both good     great  Dessert tiramisu cannoli  Cannoli looked deep fried egg roll   Did try tiramisu soggy yuck  glad opportunity try many things because did care most  If restaurant based service only would defiantly back why 3 stars   just would eat  <EOR> Excellent food professional service rare L V  sleek atmosphere  Prices high but insane Las Vegas felt OK paying $100 head  tuna tartare very good prepared uniquely  Beef tartare also excellent  pastas all flavorful properly cooked  Wine list absurd  But again maybe norm town  Thankfully cocktails all well balanced  Il Postino which Averna Carpano Luxardo Maraschino some orange thing amazing  <EOR> Overall overpriced but expect Vegas  someplace would put return list  Food service overview bread delicious  oysters smallest seen  milanese chicken over fried opinion  ravioli good  Sat bar because table wait long  Service slow but bartender nice  <EOR> Service ok  best could say    The food terrible way way over priced  bucatini amatriciana put hole your stomach before finish digesting it

Boy wrong   did want wait another 30 minutes straight bar section where still order same food   regular menu more extravagant menu   selected meat lasagna   wife order clam lingunie but said since why lobster ravioli   so she did   When meat lasagna came pictured available another reviewer wasn't bad looking   taste reasonable although think microwave   center hot but outside   Additionally food cold quickly   When lobster ravioli came totally disappointed!!!  ravioli extremely small   size 1 2 dollar coin flat!  didn't taste any lobster   looked somethng order form Trader Joe's boiled served   item cost $39!!  The service reasonable bar   paid 15% courtesy   However didn't realize credit card missing until hour later   wife called restaurant said they'll keep until closing otherwise give security card if don't pick same night   rushed back restaurant talk front desk   then told security came insisted credit card held office   all way security station   So overall think food sucks overprice   Service so   tried other restaurants think most tasteful  <EOR> I'm fan Sirio although just ordered appetizers food delicious  ordered Rapini calamari mushrooms grilled octopus  all delightful  tiramisu cannolli very decadent delicious  would definitely again try dinner menu  <EOR> The food poor  Very poor  food also very pricey adding dissappointment  am only giving two stars because nice ambiance friendly staff  wish would looked into place before would stayed away  Please avoid restaurant  <EOR> The food sucked service sucked   No ambiance friends 21st Birthday   only did anything feel special but took 20 minutes them bring drink birthday dessert she biscotti broken plate   Really bad!!  teareally expensive waiter didnt tell house signature apoetizer he recommended table 100 plate   He brought 2 plates   prosciutto cheese   ok but worth price!
