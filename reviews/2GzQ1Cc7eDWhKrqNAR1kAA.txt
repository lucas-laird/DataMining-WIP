First time getting burrito daughter can't believe didn't any white rice 530 afternoon amd planning anymore unbelievable never heard before never back place <EOR> When came lunch break no line 3 workers making preparing food  made wait worker prepare rice 5 minutes then when asked some bell peppers employee told No would actually cook those  middle day around lunch time obviously more customers would come later ask but some reason didn't want more  <EOR> One best Chipotles ever to! First off service very welcoming greet soon walk through door  very quick through line while being courteous friendly  used live nearby frequent customer until moved away still drive chipotle continue going one  Last but least food quality great always fresh   said before many times never left problem  <EOR> If you're trying win back customers maybe should everything menu   including fresh brewed iced T  Why beverages overlooked most restaurants ridiculous  Sure if sign beforehand notifying lack ice T would considered drinking water something else  unacceptable if notify your employees twice then promises bring some then 15 minutes later says going take 20 minutes brew    And don't serve burnt chicken either!   Really disappointed location   Perhaps shouldn't kids running joint  <EOR> Disappointed food today 3 30 18    literally 4 people eating entire place during dinner around 8pm when come order food no brown rice no beans mean people doing here?
