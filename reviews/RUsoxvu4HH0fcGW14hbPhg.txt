Maybe month ago probably would knocked star only accepting cash but now accept credit cards! extra star convenience! many great pastries choose from! prepackaged fresh off oven pastries!   Looking quick lunch go? I'd suggest bread rolls filled pork chicken beef asado adobo  really just sandwich roll    When comes sweet delights sucker bibinka spanish bread rolls cheese rolls! But! If you're craving delights soon open come disappointed because they're usually freshly offered until 12 noon mirienda time which snack time tagalog!   cheese rolls filled cream cheese filling soft sweet slightly sugary outter dough  spanish bread soft bread roll nice butter sugar filling inside  decent combination bread sugar steer away diabetes overly sweet explosion  just right! bibinka also good! Soft breading enough cheese just right amount salted egg slices bibinka ain't bibinka without salted egg slices  all slices  Their empenada's siopao pan de sals great too! Best part pan de sals come regular cheese whole wheat variety!   Prices freshly baked goods casings usually range $0 75 $2 which think good deal afternoon snack! Prepackaged goods also decent price ranging $3 decent amount pieces them <EOR> The pandesal bread's good but if u don't eat other stuff right away cassava cake bought day ago u might find yourself w molded dessert  1st day tried thought tasted ok  Nothing special mom's aunts homemade ones  gonna eat next day cuz hate waste but then molded  Probably good thing me  Saved eating something wasn't all good   didn't think sweet rice cakes all either    On reviews read bakery said something turon being good which agree    The staff seems friendly helpful but just wasn't satisfied w taste texture desserts  Maybe cause Filipina lived couple years when dad stationed Clark Air Force Base when comes Filipino food hard please  <EOR> I prefer Pan De Sal Valerio's over Goldilock's    If you're looking excellent Filipino breads baked goods look no further!

Last week nothing except bread  so glad time able buy some other goodies! <EOR> I'd drop more stars if rating off mood  Over time place annoyed more more  Filipino frequented many Filipino bakeries through course life   Las Vegas does really solid oh shnap Filipino bakery  bakeries simple 'make do'  Bakeries simply seem best option because option have?   Honestly really isnt all great  biko kalamay puto kutsinta whenever purchase ALWAYS some weird taste know taste you'd cooked yourself  even joked husband ugh taste embalming fluid here  joke people  But if perservatives add into baked goods   my tastebuds all over it  Which why never purchase those items anymore  solid place fix such desserts elsewhere   The Spanish bread kills me  rarely buy it   but when do   it's because kids want it  AMAZING Spanish bread Hawaii expectations high  Living make do  BUT! Purchasing something few times over enough realize filling all way side bread really you're just paying bread   is just way life here? No done  See pictures   Also experienced more dry breads most times  only bread hasnt disappointed ube bread  Kids love its graciously stuffed  Note Spanish bread Filipino version  confused actual Spanish bread elsewhere   And service? Sometimes friendly sometimes cashier looks judgment  dont appreciate feeling  You'd think Filipino all fellow judgey Filipinos would used it? don't  pisses off more because conscious such attitude  seen better days though can't lie    But 4 stars? Naw  anymore  tried being positive but getting ripped off isn't fun anymore  Then try going busy day   you basically stand line grab move along because taking time browse assess your life situation may become hectic since isn't adequate space when busy    And people   please bring your seafood city grocery cart stand corner have  isn't much room all that  Other place def gets business  Where else going your Filipino treats conveniently especially grocery shopping  Personally over it  However def give try!   Strollers shopping carts advised    Enjoy! <EOR> They offer plenty Filipino baked goods very fresh   service bit slow but seemed both women packaging goods between customers  ended getting fresh ube bread loaded sugary butter top sapin sapin a chewy coconut  flavored rice flour based dessert snack pan de Sal rolls karioka which deep fried balls goodness typically coated coconut syrup bibinka  favored ube bread sapin sapin  Karioka way large sister said weird Orange flavor it  If chance I'd love come back try other produce  <EOR> If looking Filipino pastries grandma ain't around whip Valerio's good option   Red Ribbon usually spot but getting little mainstream days   Both still good IMO     I never really sweets gut till met fiance now cannot resist getting ube filled buns couple bags pandesal   place also siopao Filipino version manapuas tropical peeps baos Chinese kin   fillings slightly different more closely related Chinese style   Oh ensemadas point well   Hard overcome urge good old fashioned homeland cooking   trick buy ube ice cream ice cream sandwich whole wheat pandesal bam!
