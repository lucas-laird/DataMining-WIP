While waiting your drink peruse teen magazines such Seventeen Teen Vogue both staples mine back day along most recent Avon Avon Mark catalogs    The workers mainly females teens early twenties  Unlike other boba places speak English fluently definitely won't any type language barrier    just opinion but reason place good probably attributed chain having originated Taiwan  all boba most definitely Taiwanese invention  <EOR> We don't any good Boba places DC Metro area husband planned visit soon arrived LV visit family   satisfied craving bigtime without having drive all way Chinatown   The place packed which took good sign   Coconut Milk Boba husband Mango Boba  Both excellent   husband disappointed numerous local boba places over past few years almost tear eye first taste drink   The staff also quite friendly didn't even laugh spilling drink all over place when put straw accidentally broke cup somehow haha only me! <EOR> Used all time when lived closer  boba always well done  disliked personalities many girls  friendly ones didn't seem last long  Decent prices good variety flavors great quality mixes  frequent No 1 Boba near Smith's Flamingo Ft  Apache now  <EOR> I've tried 4 other boba places Vegas best far  generous boba flavors consistent  no sugar added green tea which little less sweet which it  girls work always nice  <EOR> It's small space but worker give always welcome feeling drinks awesome! love place! <EOR> A trip Las Vegas isn't complete without making pit stop here!

Taro slush yummy tastes milk bottom your bowl fruity pebbles cereal! Green tea slush also fav both boba! <EOR> MY GO TO BOBA SPOT  place underrated which confusing because consistent gets! least dozen times only order always point but same friendly service too  go to because love just $0 85 more jumbo size! Check Yelp $1 00 off anyway! tried multiple things menu such thai iced tea mango slush lychee green tea etc    but consistent order MATCHA GREEN TEA SLUSH EXTRA BOBA  Never disappoints!   *They also fishballs squid balls shrimp balls  which perfect little paired snack boba  I enjoyed them all but if choose? Shrimp balls favorite  ^__^ <EOR> I love fact location literally behind home!  never busy most Boba cafe Chinatown   Price reasonable bit more selection   also take credit cards which love because don't always carry cash!    And located around some great Asian restaurants   great stop dinner some drink dessert shaved ice! <EOR> This pretty great boba place really especially considering convenient is  Most decent boba shops down Spring Mountain Road which very congested difficult naviagte but Easy Life Boba isn't far away streets aren't narrow    I've place enough times deduce Thai Tea Slush favorite  Generally love rose milk tea bobas but think slush better here  friend also tried Lava Flow I believe name loved because resembled piña colada strawberries boba pearls   The only reason four star due fact snacks alright  shrimp ball overly salted lobster ball wasn't bad   I know you're probably thinking 'Why she commenting snacks when place clearly meant boba?' Well  because if would put options snack then snack should pretty good but overly salty almost inedible    It might've fluke but shrimp ball just overly salty texture wasn't most pleasent either   Overall boba great just snacks  <EOR> It's while since reviewed usually try places more once see if they're consistent last review happy say Easy Life remains fave Boba place!  I try different flavors every time seriously every single tasted fresh creamy delicious!   Service always friendly too! Nothing else say  Craving Boba type this  <EOR> I loveeeee slushy boba!!! always order pineapple mango just taste delish    watery blended well!!! love fresh taste also sell little snacks lobster ball egg rolls etc! Highly recommend if live around area! planning going tomorrow cause wanting past couple days <EOR> My favorite passion fruit slushy ! never bad experience  Everyone always nice serve best boba teas <EOR> This favorite boba places  However last trip just made write review    Very upset     Can't add sea salt cream jumbo size drink? But did add last drink     BS    trouble? Hello? If your customer satisfied you're trouble!!!! totally satisfied gonna pay it!!!! Super upset    Because favorite places gave 2 starts <EOR> I finally made trip other day  place dope modern look inside  some tables sit kick back but just ordered mine since class    I ordered large Almond Milk Tea w boba  good  milk tea tasted just right  boba could cooked little more though  mos def come back try fresh fruit drinks  <EOR> I find high ratings place completely baffling  Maybe came bad night know someone being off game  But think 2 stars pretty generous if ask why? probably worst bubble tea ever had  Ever   I area checking around some new bubble tea places closeby  seeing high ratings decided check out  inside store pretty nice  clean well maintained  Things started downhill ordering bubble tea   Large Milk tea w boba egg pudding caramel Let's start boba  well cooked  mushy outside hard middle  Definitely disappointed  egg pudding ghastly  way soft  time gets sucked through straw disintegrates into cottage cheese texture  almost wanted puke  milk tea 0% tea flavor might well water  finally cherry top would caramel  use Torani brand caramel syrup  Yes same caramel syrup use Starbucks flavor drinks  mean come on  terrible   It should 1 star but gave them extra star because total 4 bucks yelp check offer  But coming back  <EOR> Absolutely mediocre  order honeydew milk tea but could still taste powder  All shake more  <EOR> Out all boba bubble tea places Vegas I'd say favorite   Quality drinks well priced   I really tapioca drinks because fresh mushy hardened many places to   The boba relatively cheap compared places Tea Station Volcano Tea honest think Easy Life's drinks taste much better   My favorites Jasmine Almond Milk Tea Tapioca if want something classic Coconut Slush Coffee Jelly a must! And endnote  service awesome! <EOR> I place multiple times! Every time great experience  many good teas slushes etc choose from  If ever want study just grab quick boba mile tea road always come here  Thank your great services  <EOR> 0I love trying different types boba places happens right next door  Maybe yet explore other flavors place since Ive only once but wasnt really fan   I ordered thai tea which top picks  came within minute  drink wasnt cold  drink wasnt flavorful tasted slightly watered down  Perhaps other flavors may save review  Im definitely willing back try something else update review   The location clean staff friendly  feel inside decor could find more central theme character draw customers in    I just feel tons potential boba stop unique  Places should upbeat colorful  Id see place really embrace means easy life them  Seems such laid back kind place Id see more too    Well again hoping return try other flavors perhaps indulge some appetizers  Ill back! <EOR> We frequent Easy Life Boba anytime area and or really craving delicious refreshing drink!!  always same thing which peach slush great hot summer days nights Vegas!!  don't recommend hanging shop very hot opinion!!
