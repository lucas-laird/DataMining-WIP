Tellement que s'il y en avait un proche de chez moi je ne m'en ferais plus j'irais chez Wingstop    Donc si vous êtes à Las Vegas et que vous cherchez des ailes de poulet pas trop loin de la 'strip' c'est là place! <EOR> I freagin' love  place  fries super salty great  ranch   wings  always  great  dont think atomic  really spicey  prefer taste buffalo hot   all flats no legs   I dont wait time lack  space but thats fjne  <EOR> Garlic parm moist cheesy garlicky! love it! bbq sauce pretty ordinary didnt meet expectations  wings medium sized would say 8pcs enough while hubs 12pcs  seasoned fries damn good large enough share two people  <EOR> my experience okay  girls worked gave okay service  weren't sassy anything  I'd give location 5 stars but bringing down 4 stars instead because quality food  so ordered 8 piece wings fries  fricken love Wing Stop unlv fries are!!!! flavorful seasoned theirs is!
