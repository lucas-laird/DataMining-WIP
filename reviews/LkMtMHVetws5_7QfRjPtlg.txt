Star Trek Experience closed   Doesn't look new attraction imminent but sure eventually space used something uh adequate  Casino cocktail waitresses still hot but again adequate  Sportsbook still rocks  Rooms didn't stay time but quite sure they're still adequate  Why did Liz bump Hilton star then might ask??

Very large room very very very comfortable bed wanted take bed home me  really impressed room decor nice may left overs Hilton days? only complaint room smelled little musty almost used smoking room but wasn't bad overshadowed uncomfortable    I also loved access monorail super convenient since hotel northeast side Strip made getting other hotels much cheaper faster taking cabs  didn't spend much time casino no real comments but would definitely stay again   If looking inexpensive stay Vegas would definitely recommend LVH  <EOR> Can give no stars? could spend hour why place sucks  Ok fact connected convention center always guests but come on  Put some $ Place   Sportsbook big gross  didn't want touch anything place  Rikers island cleaner facilities    Speaking jail sure nicer jail cells then room had  Hilton gold member whatever   The restaurants please   went 3 them  Garbage overpriced  We another convention Feb quote day was  guys take good look hotel cause last time stay here!

Bottom line     If want feel pampered don't stay here  Wynn other hotels but prepared pay it   LVH no frills  But really good hotel people good bargain  <EOR> A friend ours getting married Hilton back October 2010  husband decided stay Hilton well  couple complaints but major bed size request system  When booked room reserved king sized bed  When drove Santa Barbara probably 11 30PM told would having Queen  confused reserved King  According hotel it s first come first serve basis  Basically regardless if made reservation  yesterday months advance if other people check before could King  Personally think crap policy  IF reserve King should king  only staying two nights said could move rooms but night could next day  weren't going adjusted pack everything next day move rooms adjusted again then leave just stayed room  didn't offer compensate anything  only offered room switch keep complaining management  wasn't only issue  Another woman complaining same thing when complaining front desk    My only other qualm seems walk VERY long distances anywhere layout confusing    But room sort nice  <EOR> The LVH nice when owned Hilton  Since foreclosure buyout dont Hilton points anymore pay extra more modern rooms  rooms still nothing write home definately worthy upcharge  give place year before business  air conditioning room sucked moved twice   staying again  <EOR> If want away strip great place more locals casino  However due many conventions LVCC pretty crowded times  Keep mind when you're booking your rooms  The rooms themselves great  spacious comfortable  beds comfy quiet alot noise hear hallway  The LVH honors Hilton did previously which provide $5 voucher used anywhere food casino having your room cleaned  Follow directions could free breakfast everyday!  The casino itself smaller most but meant party place  several eateries such Pizza Hut Sports Bar couple more casual dining places along w great buffet offers beer wine w dinner  large sports book wedding chapel giftshops  staff friendly happy help  If you're local looking staycation ask locals deals usually one  <EOR> If you're Convention Seminar Las Vegas Hilton okay  If you're looking somewhere your Vegas base look elsewhere   Sis stayed due Internet Marketing Convention she attending  Rooms good size beds super comfy view golf course Stratosphere Hotel very nice but blackout curtains broken shower backed w water wants stand calf deep dirty water when showering?   Restaurants hotel horrible to mediocre best can't believe w competition business Hilton doesn't try step quality       but given fact isolated guess there's really no pressure    Also room prices completely outrageous but convention goers held hostage due vast isolation   Case point NOTHING w in walking distance   Even though Hilton Monorail system plan spend LEAST 45 min anywhere else Strip 2 measly stops just Cesar's yup 45 min am even kidding      So while room obviously convenient those attending conventions seminars would never actually choose stay here  bad since room itself actually nice just everything else ruined it <EOR> I thought would MUCH better then was  First took 45 minutes check only 10 people head me  Once room actually really nice  New TV very comfortable beds on    made forget long wait room  All wanted now hot shower been traveling all day     well shower something stone age  upgraded room nor new water saver shower head  pretty much something might find motel 6 10 years ago  Shower sucked bathroom fan didnt work whole place fogged up  hard keep fan working? think house keeping would say fan didnt work when clean place notice fan on! $100 worth cupons when checked which nice but them could use unless spend lot money unless buying 2 people  Nice gesture but did no good  All all probably wont stay again plenty places stay same price same service maybe even better service   Sorry Hilton but expected everything perfect  <EOR> Booked hotels tonight app pretty cheap but st  Patricks weekend march madness million conventions town  upgraded only $20 which pay resort fees other hotels  rooms nice large big jacuzzi bathtub bathroom  only slept partied better hotels clubs  If only plan sleep its perfect its north strip off beaten path but wasnt far away  $10 cab pretty much everywhere  <EOR> Casino #2! second Casino two weeks different city!

Pretty nuts but first experience hotel Las Vegas looking casino hotel the scale hotels ridiculous just huge! plus time year visit pretty much made sense  although wait check in long didn't mind much   Overall service great  Good clean rooms good house keeping great view each room visited  However room non smoking yet corridor reaked smoke which leaked into room little  addition air conditioning room excessive each night woke incredibly dry throat mouth which very uncomfortable There no manual control which why made particular comment   In summary overall hotel experience first Vegas good one! <EOR> I spent less $100 total booking room Saturday Sunday night  wasn't until paid fee did notice all negative reviews other sites  however very pleasantly surprised positive experience  initially bit put off hotel clerks check in lack politeness but seeing room which VERY clean checked bed bugs stains etc  happy decided stay here  monorail also very convenient although pricy $5 one way felt though location hotel far enough main strip feel getting away noise  Overall would definitely recommend hotel quality price  <EOR> I've stayed couple times work events held convention center conveniently next door  Maybe just events held following day but check literally exceeded hour  line wrapped around queue couple times trailed almost entrance  must maybe 4 5 max staff members desk  must say dealing cranky guests waiting long line front desk staff members kept cool polite efficient check in  even given some pointers where find good thai food  The rooms comfortable  Surprisingly double queen beds pretty comfortable  Room service honest gave reasonable time frame when requests could met 30 min extra towels casino room just classic  could find coworkers happily gambling away late night some losses wins  try staying again because conveniently close convention center  <EOR> I only stayed three off strip hotels Las Vegas Hooters Hard Rock Las Vegas Hilton those three number two list  best things hotel offers  couple years now offered deluxe room six free buffets two free drinks bar discounts off meals spa virtually no blackout dates offers  pretty hard complain spending $130 tax room food if choose utilize all free buffet coupons    The rooms themselves bad but sure upgrade least deluxe room  last time forgot upgrade into standard room demanded upgraded  standard room beds seem very small bathroom really small weird room HDTV's but none channels come HD   drove nuts wanted charge using safe which small could fin 13 inch Macbook Pro    The deluxe room much larger seems much cleaner bathroom seemed redone recently believe charged using larger safe but am 100% sure that    The casino itself very large if play table games little bit larger slot players   done well playing blackjack very early morning between 2AM 6 AM but every time play during day killed  dealers also very old school some joke join conversation while others just ignore fact there    The buffet bad seems better breakfast  omelet maker duty very good omelet French toast also very good  dinner your standard options meat seafood salad Mexican  remember seeing sushi sure would eaten if did    The best thing LV Hilton pool cabanas  pool basically its own floor large cabanas offer very affordable  come tons drinks TV's chairs some even little grass patch hang out  spa also very nice great saunas small but nicely stocked gym well variety different hot tub temps   One thing Hilton valet parking take very long time especially if show theater  Even guest take 30 minutes park your car if want your car back during show forget it    Overall place bad deals receive resort cannot always turn down but never going first choice  <EOR> I travel lot business  stay InfoComm   room cost company 300 night!

 nice option because really needs room cleaned every morning anyway? certainly don't!   you free wifi device if pay resort fee which believe everyone pays check in    so recommend hotel  BUT if you're used walking lot don't want spend money taxi's back forth then don't stay here  but those don't mind spending money walking then choose gem!

By way charge internet per machine per day  if laptop ipad want use pay twice   I see why Hilton took away franchise! Never going stay again  <EOR> There basically no reason stay Las Vegas Hilton when could enjoy other fantastic options around town     First all hotel reminiscent 1970's both decor patronage amenities   Case point both Barry Manilow ABBA shows Hilton each time visited spot     The rooms broken outdated decor older televisions dirty tapestries more   crowd cheesy older   Be prepared see some interesting characters wacky clothing   Lastly hotel located off Strip basically way all action   This your typical upscale Hilton but budget Vegas hotel hiding behind positive brand name   If looking more affordable options would suggest checking into Flamingo Tropicana Bally's something actually Strip   might similar cheese factor as call it but least enjoy nice pool better location  <EOR> Despite being conveniently accessible monorail dumpy lot only thing going Star Trek Experience Quark's Bar   However closing three weeks don't see any reason here   dining options limited decor hideous though can't speak rooms see no reason stay when much better options available  <EOR> Yelp's statement 2 star reviews couldn't say better Meh  experienced better  Vegas Virgin Well anyway really couldn't wait Vegas experience! know part where open your wallet flush all your money down toilet? Metaphors people    While stay wasn't bad definitely lot could done  instance bathrooms seemed minimal work done dust few other things dotted around bathroom  Second felt restaurants hotel little expensive comparison Luxor Caesar's Palace    It also rather long walk East Tower but probably need exercise anyway   yes not so complimentary coffee kind insult  Seriously $3 50 cup something most other hotels free?   If couldn't find cheaper better deal I'd here  Otherwise no  <EOR> Overall LVH OK hotel  list good bad Good Large comfy rooms Easy monorail access Friendly staff Very close LV Convention Center Nice flat screen TV  Bad Older hotel wired modern lifestyles  Very few outlets each room awkward places  Wi Fi costs $15 device day   extremely high even big city European hotels  Very few dining options area Expensive airport Smells bad smoke cigars constantly Horrible shower heads water pressure  Next time attend show Las Vegas choose different hotel  <EOR> My hotel room BEAUTIFUL! put 20th floor view pool spa las vegas strip PERFECT  rooms its own computer desk flat screen tv     the rooms neat clean  only  bad thing say hotel hidden fees pay watch movies listen music fake advertisement  Other loved stay there  <EOR> This Hilton located slightly off strip closer Circus Circus huge H sign similar shape Hurley's logo  room comp'ed thanks good friend  The best part room definitely beds  most comfy beds slept stacked 3 memory foams top each other  smoking room can't really judge smell fact reeked cigars only sense I'd take bath smoke cigar too  We tried buffet very discounted price  would say wouldn't mind eating free but wouldn't pay more 10$ it  liked alcohol bar part buffet yeah myself Oktoberfest 11am   We played some tables experience must say dealers staff pretty friendly funny  Overall place can't really compared places Bellagio Venetian  more class your standard hotel  But hotel less 5 minute walk strip wouldn't mind staying if pay half fraction cost other flashy hotels  <EOR> First time stayed hotel  bf business past week  Tried reservation other hotels but tooo expensive many booked    From moment everyone very courteous  check staff fixed nice suite  very nice exceptionally big room  refrigerato bar  would think would microwave but no such luck   bathroom nice oval tub wish would jacuzzi tub but still good  beds pillows horrible though  comfortable bed else am cranky person  Needless say cranky person next day neck pains  When complained check all she said if upgraded would gotten more comfortable bed which cost 4k dollars    DUH why didnt know that!!

Maybe light bill expensive! As far casino pretty standard  cigarette smoke over powering gaming areas clean  enjoyed sports book area most  Nice comfy seating very attentive waitresses  pool area meh  pool large all but somewhat relaxing because crowded all  also played nice variety music well  guy walked around offering massages sun tan lotion CREEPY! don't want those hands anywhere near me! As many already said spot pretty far popping properties strip but monorail minimal time  weekends also runs till 3AM   Get players card! offer some sweet deals it  Overall would stay again   My only complaint advertise no resort fee yet charge $13 99 day PER device Internet??!!! WTF! <EOR> The price right $50 nt weekend  rooms through Priceline wasn't overly thrilled off strip but whatever    We rooms 941 942  rooms very big opted king beds  check asked if wanted remodeled room $20 nt   uh no otherwise would've stayed nicer hotel nice try though  If opt housekeeping give $5 off any restaurant $10 free play   we opted own bed    This monorail stops worked well walked hotel strip meandered all way MGM just took monorail back   easy peasy   cab Fremont only $12    Was hotel all no but then again rates cheaper Motel 6 extremely satisfied    Not many late night food options Paradise Cafe closes 1am fast food places also shut down munchies accordingly  <EOR> Where start?  No coffee rooms small cost $2 75 downstairs  If ask coffee maker extra $40  No fridge didn't ask price one  The Paradise Cafe Sooo over priced  Just toast cost $4 $5  Again coffee $2 75 Is some price fixing going here? Any full breakfasts cost least $9 seems instant already prepared type foods real cooking going except omlets  Good things Free parking friendly staff monorail station hotel much quieter main part strip its Paradise Las Vegas Blvd  The neighborhood probably far main strip still some safety  Just saw another review stating watch your credit card closely definitely little concerned Hilton's mandatory deposit telling total bill when added night prior arrival   Room o k  two beds sure why still room  sunken very very lumpy  <EOR> I don't agree many lackluster or worse reviews property   others mentioned Las Vegas Hilton until January year now known Las Vegas Hotel LVH    I'd booked hotel 3 nights primarily because more inexpensive options larger more well known Vegas properties inexpensive being relative term $152 night Thur  $115 night Fri  $83 night Sat  special promotion but also because connected Las Vegas Convention Center where attending trade show    I've stayed several other Vegas hotels past MGM Grand Alladin Planet Hollywood Tropicana Excalibur etc  opinion hotel room itself ranked good better all those   When arrived greeted bellman asked if needed assistance luggage I didn't another woman greeted held entrance door open while another gentleman welcomed Las Vegas Hotel pointed toward check desk  did take 5 minutes through check line but line moved steadily check personnel great   Based other reviews property expecting find old broken down hotel poor service   didn't find all   room actually larger Excalibur during last visit well appointed both wired wireless Internet available $13 99 24 hours room clean everything new condition   outfitted 40 flat screen TV updated modern wall coverings bedding furniture artwork draperies good sized desk could work done while here   safe provided room boutique soaps shampoos Kudos Spa    The only critical comments I'd few lighting fixtures lobby elevator corridors large LVH sign front place look touch dated 1980's design lots brass but those wouldn't take much update outside those items fact main club looks bit odd still much decor layout old now defunct Star Trek Experience exhibit once located hotel looks fairly modern seems good condition certainly better shape and smokey some cases smelly many properties strip itself    I did notice lack food options hotel when compared many other casinos Vegas   When arrived more hour later expected thanks American Airlines some work needed done call needed take part before meeting some business associates later day    reason really only wanted grab something quickly   Unfortunately options limited   all regular sit down served restaurants Bennihana Vince Neil's Cantina TJ's Steakhouse etc  but when area mentioned signage fast food found only Pizza Hut Express Seattle's Best Coffee ice cream stand    ended going sports book area the largest Vegas believe grabbing something sports grill there   Know charge extra if wish use safe room though offer where they'll give $5 food drink voucher $10 gaming voucher if call refuse room service day cannot apply during day check last 2 days your stay    Therefore during 4 day stay could only take advantage offer once   would've also nice coffee maker room rather having lobby each morning caffiene boost   It should noted while hotel more less connected convention center monorail station strip quickly fairly far off strip itself    fact room more less faced strip view back side Venetian Wynn Encore properties all fair distance away   In all I'd definitely stay again   found staff friendly rooms well appointed modern good condition absolutely no complaints time here   especially true when considering price hotel casino compared many others city excluding off brand hotels motels known dumps Circus Circus Stratosphere   <EOR> Nice hotel bad management bathtub faucet running all night annoying would wake sometimes middle night trouble sleeping again because trickle noise just carried over bathroom doors  called them every day atleast twice never fixed till checked out i more concerned water going waste nuisance  Talk waste water  irony green option which involves skipping room service  doubt any green intentions letting water run all night  I wanted give 4 stars but being mean mother natures letting all water waste numerous complaints 1 star  <EOR> The only reason why stayed because brother attending conference Hilton Convention Center   originally asked non smoking room front desk surprised see ashtrays room  change rooms because stench smoke way overpowering   person front desk said option previous room non smoking room yeah insert chuckle switched better room no problem but little strange handicap enabled room minor annoyance compared poor amenities   don't even want know  kind greasy whitish stain desk chair   normally easily pleased when comes hotel rooms but expecting more Hilton Hotels such great experiences Embassy Suites Hampton Inn both part Hilton Hotels  mean type person loves camping enjoyed roughing third world country pleasant accommodations   The monorail convenient certain extent   Unfortunately monorail stops aren't most desirable locations   If you're wearing high heels like most women sometimes men Vegas don't even think taking monorail   extra money you'll spend taxi cab truly worth it   When also took monorail Stratosphere seems dropped off middle nowhere   walk half mile finally destination   The only reason why gave Las Vegas Hilton 1 star because thought Star Trek Experience great playground dorkiness   don't think fan enjoy but if you're tempted touch anything during shows don't starfleet officers take jobs seriously phaser your hand off  <EOR> There two redeeming graces Las Vegas casino its great view Turnberry Suites great restaurants  Other don't bother  <EOR> Priceline recently updated hotel four stars  serious?! I don't know criteria rating hotels but suspect just wanted second 4 star rated hotel listed convention center area  could possibly rate Motel 6 like motel 4 star Renaissance hotel couple blocks away? I suppose hotel merits 2 stars own only spent $30 night it  However if bases one's rating Priceline calling 4 star hotel only deserves single star   Although already prepaid hotel couldn't refund reserved room elsewhere soon saw room  never even stayed night  Very disappointing made trip much more expensive since ended paying two separate hotels  <EOR> Myself 3 friends stayed LVH weekend 13 15  Room cheap considering fight Saturday other various concerts  hotel located off stop behind Wynn Encore  highly recommend buying monorail pass while stay here  room decent  ran hot water showers 3rd person water pressure sucked  only 2 working outlets room  Very dim lighting room itself  Also non smoking room but room next smoking smoke all night room which very miserable  complained luckily kind enough knock off resort fee  wouldn't stay again far main strip wasn't pleased room  <EOR> Got sweet deal Expedia  Well now seen hotel know why    The first thing looking bellhop help luggage due back problems couldn't find anywhere  checked first room discovered dirty covered cigarette burns  When back down ask another room decided upgrade extra $20 day  room only walk into shitty situation  Literally  toilet FULL shit  don't mean someone forgot flush toilet mean someone playing nasty prank didn't flush 3 days   How's start vacation?  Then wait plumber finally fixed issue then wait housekeeping come back because shit all over floor  Management didn't offer anything all disgusting inconvenience nor did offer switch room  We're even considering staying few extra days but definitely switching hotels  happened service cleanliness Hilton brand use carry it?  Spend extra few bucks stay down way   Okay same day update bitched moaned night upgraded room $20 paid $20 room service paid for  $40  don't feel should bring issue should really acknowledged customer service world BEFORE complaining  Proactive reactive  <EOR> I'm mad place!

Bottom line since LVH came bankruptcy proven loyal customers loyal them  old school Hilton feel alive well unless changes earned undying patronage    Gambling goal catch good beer buzz off free booze before run chips  also want good time while losing paycheck  LVH always done right regard  Seriously greatest dealers pit bosses there  always good time   Food Meh  Sports book deli pretty much late night  buffet adequate  Vince Neals' place ok  steak house good  rest predictable chain restaurants   amazing but don't suck either   Sports Book If sports betting great choice  Best sports book Vegas overall    Rooms over 50 nights stayed never issue cleanliness maintenance issues   someone stays hotels lot thorough check all manner nasties bugs   Rates mailers all time LVH  rate usually around $20 rare exception big event town high expected occupancy  Yes resort fees Internet charges but still $40 cheaper next closest hotel  addition least few nights free every month lot stays free  <EOR> If you're going spending alot time Las Vegas Convention Center can't location here  last thing waned spending long day show floor cab  Instead short 5 min walk back hotel   The room decent  flat screen tv but analog service quality kinda crappy  Other cons  Internet $14 day room but its free lobby gym costs extra  However jogging path around perimeter hotel   The Star Trek bar amusing  nice always mostly empty since always big group us  cabaret show bad    I'd stay again Convention related stuff but fun going strip next time  <EOR> I stayed least 6 times before changed ownership LVH once afterwards changed LVH but apparently before decided charge $18 resort fee others mentioned  Previously during those 6 times booked room between $15 35 no resort fee even while paying such cheap prices still great LAS VEGAS due competition  hotel located near convention center which convenient business travelers but extremely inconvenient anyone else  driveway lobby beautiful but very very pointless lost going wrong way driving mindlessly wasted travel  probably designed back day when hilton premier hotel helped long driveway lobby longer queues taxi's  positives used cheap no resort fee along easy access convention center  negatives take awhile  Since changed ownership no longer cheap now charge resort fee which hilton big knew charge no resort fee attract people though apparently new ownership banking tricking travelers into 'thinking' new hotel state art renovation which neither  parking lot SEEMS conveniently located but once park start walking realize parking lot set far far far side hotel lobby room elevators you'll forced walk shops  decor inside old which other las vegas hotels but don't charge LVH charges  Fortunately drive but anyone doesn't drive they're forced take ripoff taxi's even worse tourist monorail charges 1 way same all day pass nyc  Access restaurants pretty bad active searcher good food LUCKY find place relatively nearby next nearest reasonable food 2 miles away  If don't authentic Thai not americanized thai crap casual local filipino restaurants then you'll travel food starve    It's unfortunate but think new management decided keep hotel bad shape bother customer service while instead hosting more events convention center which would guaranteed customers want convenience all while charge premiums room unsuspecting first time stayers  Basically advertising movie trailer something caring if don't because already made 10 bucks off you  If you're looking hotels inexpensive comparable gold coast no brainer cheap rooms well maintained lots restaurants inside good gambling mention if bored   you walk across street RIO Palms   I've already heard some negative situations regarding management bordering lawsuit hopefully enough negative feedback forced close shop actually give crap customers  <EOR> Ok first off review written stayed hotel numerous occasions  Probably 4 5 times  great rate standard room getaroom com  When checked given keys room 2109 Central Tower which paid standard  When room thoroughly disappointed older rooms upgraded  tried talk myself into toughing but 15 minutes decided couldn't take it  back downstairs upgraded room additional $ 20 night well worth it  upgraded rooms par course Las Vegas 4 star hotel  rooms spacious clean number restaurants choose from  only block away Strip very comfortable stay  When book avoid booking just standard room if room 2109 Central Tower immediately ask upgraded room  If don't might seriously consider suicide lol  <EOR> Nice little casino raiding rock vault <EOR> I stayed LVH beginning year   I'd received awesome deal through email players club card even though only use 25% all restaurants    With discounted room offered $100 worth dining vouchers   which pretty useless considering 25% discount locals players card ALWAYS better deal     The room huge nice enough amounted $60 night   shower sucked bathroom TINY    The bit bothered day checkout noticed rash all over body cheap detergent use wash bed clothes   spend $20 lotion away  I super sensitive skin but NEVER problem other hotels   even run down crappy Cali stayed beginning month  If good deal room I'd recommend it   People nice enough ok   but    I good deals better rooms elsewhere  <EOR> Love place! stay everytime   join Players Club receive continuous deals such 3 nights $99!

The Hilton continues go to hotels Las Vegas  <EOR> Stayed couple friends pretty bad stay  great clean rooms cozy beds but housekeeping terrible  asked front desk roll in bed evening  put luggage room dinner  When came back couple hours later no roll in bed  called front desk took them half hour room  The next day toilet overflowed called housekeeping  wait 20 minutes meanwhile all haven't taken showers there's water everywhere  call back 10 minutes later said plunger us  15 minutes later down front desk asked them plunger us  finally sent someone unclog toilet  I am never staying hotel again! <EOR> We stayed over Labor day weekend standard rooms hotel available reasonable rate even last minute reasons which would become clear when actually reached place its pretty dilapidated run down   Checking took under 10 minutes even though tons people waiting before much complain here   The hotel good 12 15 minute leisurely walk strip hotel no restaurants immediately outside hotel apart ampm store attached arco gas station  ended eating most meals food court Riviera which located Las Vegas Blvd turned pain 20 minutes walking could take car due lack parking strip   The self service car park directly attached hotel but good 3 5 minutes walk hotel itself which pain    The hotel itself very run down  Right bat lever shower room locked tight able budge call someone maintenance move  Then would turn off water kept dripping into tub making noise entire day  When complained maintenance came just tightened lever back tight position rather fixing problem which meant another call maintenance when wanted use shower  Water sink would drain normally took almost 45 minutes seep slowly which gave gross feeling  air conditioning unit did proper thermostat control but only allowed setting fan speed low high which no effect cooling hot during day chilled during night  second day all sudden room refused let key then treck down reception another key guess also refused work back down reception where simply apologized gave another key but now knew expect refused budge till called security escort room third trip  people reception did think required but stood ground finally sure would guessed now key did work even third time security override lock let call locksmith fixed  overall very comfortable stay    Cleaning done between 9 10 a m  if skip $8 coupon used casino some food but need call let them know night before    They provide water bottles coffee room $4 each which liked specially coffee no place grab near hotel early morning   Overall would first choice when selecting hotel near strip would prefer Stratosphere but terrible considering last minute during peak time reasonable rate  <EOR> Place dirty  soap shampoo bathroom used bed looked just remade without changing sheets roller bed last occupants middle room  When called roller bed nobody came called again still nothing  45 minutes waiting just move myself hall  furniture looked old there's even mini fridge  Glad only stayed night here  Spent rest trip MGM Signature hotel awesome  Skip LVH  <EOR> First all let say while am giving LVH 4 stars 4 star hotel  3 star hotel maybe 3 1 2 tops but am giving them 4 stars few reasons   You probably already know now but LVH Las Vegas Hilton convention center rebranded  slogan Same Fame New Name  slogan should New Name Same Everything Else  Literally nothing changed 6 months since changed name  If blind folded when walked into hotel didn't see sign outside when took blind fold off inside would never know weren't Hilton   necessarily bad thing just fact   They didn't remodel rooms all but Hilton rooms fine  Good sized clean enough average bed  only issue ever Hilton LVH's rooms almost all adjoining rooms  don't adjoining rooms noisier but when ask non adjoining room am told only non adjoining rooms elevators extra elevator sounds  pretty sad  just hope don't someone kids adjoining room   Now things really LVH almost always discounted rooms there  am gambler result good prices  Last trip paid $40 night weekend! Try finding deal anywhere else Vegas  Additionally give green option where turn down maid service thank give $10 day food vouchers any restaurant buffet  result least LVH damned good deal save money other things slot machines   The LVH also gets brownie points being few hotels Vegas where doesn't take 30 minutes walk your car your room casino  Most casinos walk through all restaurants stores casino  LVH  Especially if park back sports book  literally right there! Also because strip traffic around hotel isn't zoo lot places  very easy hotel   As casino good mix slot machines most but unfortunately all newest games  also good selection table games but sadly no poker room  sports book nice large every betting option imagine  also special smoke free area where hang watch game   The pool area nice  par any bigger hotels but again costs lot less if really want trendy kick ass pool party feel free somewhere else pay three times much   Oh yeah LVH monorail station making easy strip without driving   If first time visitor Vegas would suggest paying more staying strip full Vegas experience  If Vegas regular LVH great affordable option where save some money stress free stay but still able everything want do  <EOR> Was convention past weekend didn't stay rooms   Good Friendly staff Convention area nice easily accessible  Slightly more affordable beverage options   Bad Outdated decor  Parking accessible via elevator walk around separate parking structure good when freezing outside  Confusing layout very easy turned around floor  <EOR> Great value off strip especially people familiar Vegas  If want Vegas experience spend more money stay strip   Pros Nice rooms different room types really good price  Hotel good shape because used Hilton Around corner strip saves traffic drama but still close enough everything if car  If no car monorail station North parking lot conveniently located elevators rooms just short walk versus other hotels walk through entire casino biggest sports book ever wide open casino don't feel claustrophobic buffet better expected   Cons none  Again if want Vegas experience don't stay actually dining options limited some wanna high end spots steak house Benihana two other spots  Food court very limited well if want some budget food options   Tip classic room entry level type room flat screen TV best part cheap cost if want better bed bathroom updated furnishings etc could spend about  $20 more next room type North Tower more $ various room options <EOR> It definitely shows its age   exercise facility small quite crowded   pool nothing write home about   Well least cheap clean  <EOR> I live Vegas good friends came stay LVH now Westgate met them at hotel two days during stay   The good The Vince Neil Cantina in hotel serves truly excellent food  I writing review regarding experience  My friend well husband stated bed comfortable   Their room did small refrigerator bar console  *Disclosure notice refrigerator probably because upgraded room  doubt all rooms refrigerator     The bad The AC blasting made room really really cold  temperature could adjusted order room comfortable temperature  friend resorted wrapping herself blanket order comfortable  duration several day stay she wore sweatjacket whilst room   When on very rare occasions AC *did* shut off sounded someone kicking door in  heard happen twice  Everyone room jumped when happened both times    The showers did offer hot water more times not  friend reported issue and she mentioned being able shower hot water but rest stay cold shower central   A brown flotsom discovered shower stall  friend could determine cause foam brown specks residing near drain shower  It bubbled through drain pipes   but reason happening unclear  The restaurants really strange inconvenient hours  Considering Vegas 24 hour town   it incredibly difficult find restaurant which eat 9 00 p m  again around 5 00 p m  Those times pretty reasonable  shocked discover most LVH Westgate restaurants open meals during those time frames  The ugly The casino floor which walk through order convention center shops restaurants absolutely filled smoke  worst experienced *any other* hotel anywhere  or off Strip  doubt filtration units being put into service all   There loud drunken exchange outside room 3 00 morning which awakened everyone family during stay  event which awake early drunken exchange should attended Security  But wasn't  drunken brawlers did finally exit area own accord   but never should allowed disturb hotel guests long did  Hotel Security needs improved   There $3 50 charge cup service package drinking cup Keurig K cup more likely creamer sugar   $3 50 PER CUP assure no opened package order discover exactly inside coffee cup service package  LVH Westgate charging $3 50 per cup hotel room coffee could argued free drinks served gamblers Las Vegas casinos no longer most expensive drinks town  $3 50 room coffee highway robbery  Most hotels offer coffee pot along free packages regular  and decaffeinated  coffee  absolutely stunning LVH Westgate grossly overcharges should and anywhere else Vegas    basic room amenity   There $14 50 charge per person per device WiFi  Again   this charge highway robbery  Most hotels offer free WiFi  *Motels* sometimes charge WiFi service but even charge much lower rate     But paying motel prices stay LVH Westgate   The name hotel changed just prior arrival friends made aware change ahead arrival  day age hotel should at very least sent incoming hotel guests email letting them know change  guests made aware change until arrived confused hotel hotel which carried entirely new name small marquee no name all large marquee  LVH Westgate's marketing branding regarding takeover needed handled better more gracefully clearly ended happening    Overall and all things considered LVH Westgate services room staff amenities would expect when staying Las Vegas Strip resort  visited as well stayed at many Las Vegas hotels Strip and off   would never recommend staying hotel  think far better options available consumers trade show attendees conference attendees tourists  Though say again Vince Neil Cantina truly awesome food  restaurant well worth visiting  Just choose different hotel which stay     <EOR> When EMS World Expo comes Las Vegas Convention Center usually stay LVH   year marks last time staying there    biggest pro LVH going through hotel walking across small alley you're Convention Center   The negative stay LVH   entire hotel dated   check in staff try upsell room upgrade   refrigerator alone  A quick trip Target Flamingo Maryland allow stock beverages avoid hotel prices drinks  The real downer trip constant promotions   through conference organizer arranged special rate $79 night before $20 upgrade    However Hotels Tonight continually offering rooms $25 night   When asked front desk staff told agreed higher rate nothing could do   Considering amount vacancies LVH loss Hilton name I'd bigger hurry retain few customers getting  <EOR> Wow would never stay again first messed reservation then found bed bugs room when called mix room manager said if weren't happy room could leave busy weekend no rooms avaliable any other hotel!!!! stay once came back strip four am found bed bugs bed slept chairs room   Next morning reported situation even showed them picture but manager all nice he didn't even apologize agreed

No bugs  then proceeded pull nightstand see if clean behind little dusty but overall clean    My main draw hotel monorail station right hotel  perfect majority people group staying Hotel Mandalay but didn't want spend money    We room north tower all off elevator walk straight then monorail  perfect!  I can't comment food choices anything didn't spend anytime hotel other then sleep few hours  air conditioner hotel room perfect though  kept room freezer which perfect being 95 degree heat crowded club all night    I stay again  <EOR> So stayed because event attending offered great price Memorial Day weekend   where good stuff ended   waited close hour check in   at 1am!  Then help feel better upgraded room   room dressed Murphy bed folded into wall   fair comfortable   however if upgrade really want see regular rooms   Next Internet $14 per 24hrs   When use safe wasn't working   credit did say would take 30 min someone come look only took 10 he fixed within five minutes   Just felt if room price wasn't great holiday weekend would extremely upset   Know getting super customer service   just getting basic stuff without class even if try say classy  <EOR> My friends recently stayed weekend before Valentines day before let just add all 22 21 yrs old tight budget looking anything luxurious just nice clean place stay while party   We good deal room online when arrived offered 20$ upgrade night room 200 extra sq ft  lady said separate seating area just figured maybe another table more chairs but surprise couch bench chair leg rest which accommodated 5 comfortably lot extra space   The beds AMAZINGLY comfortable shower head effing amazing! bf says  dont see big problem its strip especially when its hundreds dollars cheaper take monorail! which much fun LOL <EOR> The room large staffs friendly   hotel little dated operation shrink considerably ever since new owner took over   staffs friendly but competition fierce Las Vegas would good place value seeker just looking place sleep instead place impress your date   large parking lots easy access Paradise Blvd which spring everyone into busy Las Vegas strip without all crowd parking stress which endure Sands' properties  <EOR> I really don't understand snarky reviews  stayed LVH years  always very nice rooms  über cheap  agree casino isn't massive  Don't understand $20 resort fee  But when Vegas!
