I coming particular Wendy's since 2006 because close office   drive thru consistently fast accurate   While food quality isn't best Wendy's isn't bad all   might better Wendy's restaurants LV but ones mid west always better  <EOR> Went Monday just 5 pm  Food fresh  Fries warm limp hot crisp  Home style chicken sandwich barely warm crisp all  ate restaurant please don't think food sitting bag while  could even finish food  stomach uneasy evening all Tuesday well  First visit Wendys  location last  <EOR> They couldn't order right 3 times repeating it  girl call another employee over finish taking order  even verbally executed properly back still wrong   So came home without burger  paid for    Check your bag before leave advise  <EOR> Worst Wendy's town  number times every time wonder why came back  guess location location location  used Burger King across street but now only fast food area  never good experience ever  staff unhelpful necessarily going say rude but unhelpful  If any promotional items Frosty's come mind don't ever want give any  Theres always some new rule restriction excuse why won't honor it  food old mediocre comparing other fast food higher tier restaurants they're bottom rung fast food  way now another location avoid one  location Sunset near Mountain Vista if want Wendy's now  <EOR> This restaurant such good chicken nuggets frosties die for! Today brother lunch service quick friendly! Food very delicious well! <EOR> Nice interior  Staff friendly food fresh   Really enjoyed it  just moved side risk Making Wendy's choice  <EOR> When working office area most frequent dining experiences   Wendy's scores major points because drive thru lines fastest business  More often served promptly correctly   Even restaurant usually true  However restaurant seem difficult time telling difference between milk Frostys Frosty Shakes  Numerous occasions ordered Frosty Shake only them try give regular Frosty pick window least occasion standoffish when explained them  Other times ordered chocolate milk respond something kind Frosty did want? NEVER once used word Frosty   Despite rant good does outweigh bad particular location  Just damn sure your order right before drive off  <EOR> This cleaner more friendly fast food place you'll find town  staff friendly place well designed regularly cleaned  Food well fast food place Wendy's doing best  <EOR> I come Wendy's all time lunch  Its super close work   I frequent drive thru review drive thru service only     The staff friendly fast never order come back wrong   No tomato extra mayo extra pickle etc   they've never gotten wrong me   Yesterday tried grilled chicken flatbread asiago ranch   really good   Fresh greens tomato wasn't drowned ranch dressing   just enough some good flavor  <EOR> I came because Wendy's always FAVORITE fast food  ordered #6 lettuce only fries coke     never received Coke fries cold even full  paid medium combo yet small fry sandwich NO drink!! Awful service Wendy's drive extra couple miles next Wendy's on   <EOR> The food just good any other Wendy's  The drive thru steroids  usually holding bag drive window before pull ordering  fast  feel hold when paying  <EOR>
