Musashi located just off strip took 8 minutes Caesar's Palace   As paying bill last time Floyd Mayweather HUGE entourage being sat table next us  place pics celebrities all over wall its no surprise why  Rated best steakhouses America holds all hype! <EOR> I planned birthday celebration when first called reservation excited  change time original reservation girl spoke rude  told 10 minutes literally min walking parking lot when hostess called asking if coming  She absolutely rude staff friendly either  can't really say if going back not  <EOR> Your usual tepenyaki restaurant except places likes erotica  little toys they'll take play   food salty other places own sauces right front you  definitely very good!   The only downfall place charge fried rice whereas other restaurants include your meal order  <EOR> I family town today because heard good things place co worker then comments see yelp  experience very amusing fun  When first walk smell kind turn off  sort smelled fish normal fishy smell most Japanese restaurants but more type fish left while    The service wait staff good seem attentive kept drinks filled  thing won over teppanyaki chef! name Nick first he very entertaining little show he does utensils but personality something behold!

He would tell random drunk stories he job apparently owner brother law  He doesnt seem tight routine show some other teppan tainers but kinda fun winging feel  some appeal hes personal he's buddy telling misadventures while they're hosting dinner    2nd time visitor whole family bf mom grandma uncle Amsterdam came visitor experience something different  time Tiger owner  shrimp steak time pretty good again   routine best but its show routine hes time put down  He also few extra sauces first time did fried potatoes  BF does fat usually but do! fat if order NY steak cut reduce down put sauce it    he loved it! fatty greasy all but more tasty concentrated morsel beefy flavor teriyaki sauce   guest happy mom grandma liked it  light eaters allowed them split entree which perfect them just tip light eaters maybe see if share  Even big eater meal combo gets hella stuffed!   THEORY LUNCH Seems lot bad reviews lunch time  know teppans lunches usually times when novice teppan cooks practice smaller crowds  Could explain difference pricing lunch dinner lot comments wasn't entertaining more just cooking   Some same ingredients but maybe dinner skilled chefs know entertain cook the owner all usually mans teppans dinner  For entertaining experience quality control warrants higher price its fair  Havent confirmed but just theory trainees maybe ask next time well try catch lunch teppan really rate place whole  sure though dinner isn't always perfect either  cooking long time talk but when guests distractions even f*** some star dishes    far experiences good lot teppan spots   Dinner prices fair even Benihana charges comparable rates combos meats dinner time its pricier another teppan but feel better quality Tiger awesome  all wide range teppan meats unlike others but probably would spend hundred kobe  enjoy seafood platters though probably splurge lobster tail eventually    Fun big parties 2nd time shared another small party but cool peeps no complaints but just more fun when only among friends   Coming back try lunch teppan would love late night small plates dining side  <EOR> Best teppanyaki steakhouse Las Vegas hands down  recommend always calling advance reservations because pretty busy hit miss weekdays  2 sides may sit teppanyaki grill dining sushi bar  teppanyaki recommend requesting Tiger Owner your chef  He best along Young  Unlike other teppanyaki restaurants many different homemade very yummy dipping sauces meal    Teppanyaki happy hour starts Midnight!!

Also food tastes great time served! But some cons some pretty crappy leftovers next day  Over buttered? Over season? Probably both because when take home leftovers just big glob rice meat doesn't taste very pleasant  =\  So long finish your food there! No problems =P <EOR> This late night spot! bomb! late night menu popular option food still plentiful  Lively atmosphere while you're waiting enjoy drinks bar  only downside weekends hibachi grill's usually booked wait lengthy  Aside food great! <EOR> Although off strip strip mall  took cab worried we'd walk couple blocks nearest casino Terrible's catch return cab  let before opened since cold outside  Everyone super nice  waitress very attentive without hovering  hostess watched when finished called cab us    Nick awesome showman chef  He lot fun  great variety sauces right grill  food good but honestly show really reason most people teppanyaki  If possible request Nick good time  <EOR> I wish split review into 2 parts food service   The food Amazing   Best teppanyaki place ever terms food   fried rice lobster tail filet mignon   Even vegetables excellent    The service Subpar   made reservations 8 still waited hour moment entered restaurant until chef showed up   When walk smell pretty bad rotting fish something   staff very polite though   However chef could stop making pretty vulgar sexual innuendos ladies group making them very uncomfortable   highly unprofessional didn't stop even he done cooking  <EOR> I ended working 12+ hr day rio bunch coworkers   called ahead but still waited good 30 mins table hibachi around 1am late night half price specials   getting bit impatient honestly close leaving glad didn't   hibachi wonderful cooks funny entertaining good jobs   sure tell them if someone's birthday many fun surprises store them   definitely more late night place full price menu bit pricy   Overall best meals Vegas very fun evening friends   can't remember laughing much night   would definitely come back again  <EOR> I thought wrote review but guess not  bad  When comes Teppan Las Vegas nobody does guys!

We made 8 30pm reservation less hour before seated full table   wife filet mignon shrimp combo   NY strip salmon combo   fried rice $3 50 well worth it   also served bevy vegetables including zucchini onions mushrooms bean sprouts all cooked perfection   actually preferred sirloin over filet since chop put lot sauce it   also able try portion scallops due wrong order those really good too     I Misti Y's shabby comment regarding interior   teppanyaki area felt kind basementy but kind forget once chef starts   bar area seemed pretty makeshift too   wasn't exactly area you'd spend hour at     On side note maybe being snob but scoff people order well done steaks   know personal choice should respect but why would want steak?  No less 4 people table ordered well done!  raw cuts filet looked quite different others ordered rare medium rare   Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight didn't want any vegetables even fried rice   Grown people!  More rest us!! <EOR> Amazing happy hour any sushi lover 12 3 30am  Prices fantastic   Quick orders   Fresh roles always quick refill drink  Thank u <EOR> The hibachi restaurant design likely hit miss Vegas certainly limited hibachi department  Enter Musashi small four table restaurant most probably don't know exists except foodies reviewed begin with  no nonsense kind restaurant kind wouldn't seat when 5 minutes early even though empty   But course real question sets place apart rest? Two things 1 some unique menu items won't find other hibachi locations  example quail eggs wrapped bacon explode your mouth  Pretty darn good  addition some kobe beef options some hibachi restaurants might although upper scale ones probably still will   2 Sauce heaven  If hibachi restaurant usually expect 2 3 sauces your food  range decent amazing  Well 7 8 prepare varying stages during performance  seem overwhelming but there's great variety flavors worth trying  course finished food sauce 5 realizing would more   Overall food quality pretty good but mind blowing  course quality food hibachi place probably cap but better  ginger salad wasn't favorite version soup decent enough  kind restaurant gimmicks  sauces give isnt even sauce just tiny pieces fat steaks cut off beginning turned into little treat end meal  Tasty cute but silly   My rating comparative other hibachi restaurants fact Ive better food benihana Westgate  might because special waiter would give 100 dollars free food but yolo  Musashi great worth going definitely but best ever teppanyaki  <EOR> This must Vegas  wife LITERALLY plan trips into Vegas just come dinner   The food incredible show better most but favorite thing teppanyaki experience fresh sauces flat top grill based your input  Want spicy? it! Love ginger? Coming right up  Don't forget Yum Yum sauce too!
