The carne asada tacos amazing tequila menu impressive  <EOR> The ambiance extremely nice  Candles light restaurant throughout low lights electricity  sat towards left restaurant large window let bright parking lights destroying ambiance made reading menu difficult  Drink menu looked great! Food menu typical Mexican food  Sadly best thing table ordered four orders taco salad     yes taco salad  second best thing table chips salsa  carne asada plate marinated seasoned typical piece would be  enchiladas picantes made habaneros but McDonalds picante sauce hotter this  awkward taste just bad  grilled shredded shredded enchilada cartilage connective tissue  taco salads looked tasted really good  salsa tasted canned Herdez even kidding chunky tomato sauce  rice tasted boxed rice black beans     no  If you're going Mexican serve pinto  Overall service good waiter very courteous  He made experience worth trip  would trip back unless bar  Honestly knew going high hopes because Mexican food Summerlin where people think pepper spicy  <EOR> The food adequate hard mess Mexican food but little skimpy side  would given 4 Stars if accepted Discover Card  pay cash  program people! Overpriced Margaritas typical area decent atmosphere even though its exterior drive parking lot location ample interior distraction  would back again IF WHEN start accepting Discover Card which very widely accepted leader consumer satisfaction BTW ! <EOR> Terrible   Worst experience ever    don't even know where begin   Ordered guacamole never it    No silverware    No napkins   ask everything   chicken burrito horrible   Sent back disgust    Still charged it   NEVER BACK!!

Please think it   patron life  <EOR> ******WARNING****** Absolute FRAUD!!!  pay check leave restaurant then next day bar manager charges credit car extra $3 24 citing bar tender under charged me   done authorization   *****AVOID UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES****** <EOR> I think worst meal ever had  still sick paying 100 dollars family 3 dinner! Right start chips terrible fresh jalapeño appetizer came before drinks soggy drinks mix when asked server said bartender could margarita scratch street taco platter came cold  Truly worst meal remember  <EOR> This third time coming gets worst every time  3 wanting margaritas lunch Cinco de Mayo  place wasn't even busy guess everyone already knew  terrible service is  Cheri server sat outside heat which fine we'll just stay hydrated   2 3 waters first 15 minutes received chips salsa ate all before water number 3 came when needed refills  Someone else came give waters understand if server busy would see helping everyone else but she basically avoided us  She basically avoided start finish guess mind made when she first laid eyes us  once did she prebus table ordered second round margaritas half way through lunch never received them  When told cancel drinks she immediately brought checks which she over charged sat around 20 minutes wanting pay  hope she didn't think going drop cash leave  Finally she fixed check while getting ready leave  2 separate tables leaving stood 5 feet away talking terrible service was  No more 2 minutes later someone sidewalk walked asked black listed place while back because service but craving Mexican food   service still awful? All 3 PF unanimously chimed TERRIBLE   thanked saving time    If ever decide eat dine your own risk if server's name Cheri just quickly run away! <EOR> We celebrated company holiday party Roxy restaurant manager took amazing care us  She kept contact throughout planning reservation until event everything perfect when there  Food drinks terrific well!
