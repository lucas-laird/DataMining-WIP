minutes failed attempts tried asking other bartenders ignored yet again  asked Security Manager help retrieve ID common answer can't help    In end took waving bean bags air someone's attention    Bottom line owner staff security should ashamed particularly because emergency   I'm glad your business more important cost someone's safety  <EOR> Pretty good restaurant wise  Hostesses young when exceptionally friendly but rude either  All girls dressed tiny skirts ill fitting tops  waitress nice bartender when drinks while waiting seats  He suggested good drinks menu personal favorites  could tell he busy but he wasn't rude didn't rush us  Pretty nice overall   Menu wasn't huge but some great tasting burgers appetizers  regular nachos could used more meat but didn't send back anything  wouldn't say hankering back right away but good spot meet friends entertain large group  <EOR> Great service atmosphere   Bearded kilt donning bartender lovely eye candy ladies   Go! <EOR> Wish would seen two star review before stopping first and last time  Tried stop Yard House right next door but packed long wait  only 30 people total McFadden's  Sat down bar ordered moscow mule burger cooked medium  Burger came pretty close hockey puck   well done+  Zero flavor  Asked bartender re make it  He took back kitchen returned burger bite it  told kitchen slammed would 20 minutes re make medium burger  Takes 6 minutes fire medium burger  Gabe option wait eat it  seeing movie didn't time wait 20 minutes new burger  Ate inside half hockey puck left no alternative  Staff gave zero f*cks   no apology no adjustment check  There's clearly no standard there's no question why place next door packed place nearly empty  two star Yelp rating seems rather generous  <EOR> I mcfaddens then came back because won happy hour much fun friends   Such nice atmosphere good music drinks   back again <EOR> Horrible service hostess bartenders waitress  side note didn't enjoy plastic pint glasses beer

Two frozen margaritas came she all water frozen   Finally chicken Nachos made back table but finishing all other good correct wings never made canceled those  Then finished good 20 mins still no check  Take advice other great establishments town square AVOID place TERRIBLE service !! <EOR> All say is    If however long continue receive amount clients traffic pub? Nothing ever change  Service host bussers continue suck suck suck until eventually    client's going evaporate all left friends let line jump even if waiting minutes before    Shady place   It unfortunate because probably couple them actually sincerely care guests new old    It's ingenious securities think slick trying charge folks 20 dollars line jump   ignorant bartenders gave attitude winners selected email half off drinks  Oh invite your friends! said Big mistake  Why start promotion cant pride yourself in? mean seriously?

The blackened chicken nachos option add guacamole $1 came 1 sliver avocado tiny bed pico de gallo  chicken blackened fact no seasoning flavor all   was more boiled chicken breast    The artichoke crab dip salty and shy using salt when cook yet lacked any real flavor wasn't good    The buffalo chicken flatbread ok  Nothing special but better other items   The loaded potato soup could've used some more chunks potato bacon well some pepper  But still decent compared rest food    My friend ordered chopped salad which said came ranch yet when arrived balsamic it  She mentioned waitress replied no doesn't come ranch doesn't really come specific type dressing  Then friend says well menu says comes ranch  waitress grabs menu disprove only realize menu does fact say ranch  know they've only open 2 weeks but servers should know dishes come with   and if they're sure definitely should argue customer just read menu few minutes ago    They also removed pool tables air hockey dart board ranch house used have  plus side still beer pong tables new ones fact   which upgrade    Overall pretty terrible food mediocre service reasonably priced drinks during happy hour  If your idea good time then check place out! Otherwise eat Tommy Bahama cafe order steak salad carnitas sandwich bourbon ribs coconut pineapple cake key lime pie barbados brownie instead grab some drinks yard house after  <EOR> Went place last night grand opening   Checked website saw food menu   no food order just servers walking around samples   Why food your website if can't actually order yet!?!?  Mismanaged!  Seems place just another typical Vegas party bar music loud can't even hear yourself think   sound system cranked high speakers distorting amps were   If want kind experience Blue Martini where music actually sounds decent   food fix system turn down because sounds crap!  When actually start serving food back then modify review but now place no different any other bar Vegas  <EOR> The worst food very long time now understand why place empty would only come drink that <EOR> I'm giving review based off last experience which honestly pretty good   I come meet friend catch grab few drinks  Granted met before happy hour ladies  Anyway     The boyfriend greeted seated right away  Once booth server Andrea also came over greet us  She honestly very nice entire time checked multiple times never made feel pressured order more wanted   Their mixed drinks always yummy establishment decent variety beer no complaints  <EOR> We Super Bowl told $65 all drinks wells drafts buffet  also told didn't participate buffet decided buffet    We ordered food drinks    Then found everyone pay 65 even if didn't want buffet because considered ticket restaurant    We already gotten food started eating said weren't paying food because if known pay $65 anyways then wouldn't ordered stuff off menu first place    They literally took food       The service slow  And probably threw food away anyways    Terrible customer service communication    They Should comped meals if pay $65 anyways  Hence already lost money Also sitting 30 minutes can't even money's worth alcohol    service slow  <EOR> I few weeks ago hubby before caught movie  couldnt decide place eat drink cause less hour til movie started   Since place right across theatre decided give try   A male employee caught way kind enough hold door open us  walked surprise see big was  hardly anyone but bartender super friendly since checked gave shot liquor!!

REAL NACHO CHEESE! Yes  right folks heard here   real nacho cheese   yum   My only complaint why why why must venues Town Square insist turning restaurants night clubs 10pm?
