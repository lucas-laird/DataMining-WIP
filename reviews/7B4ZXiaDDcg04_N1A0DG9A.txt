ASK IT!   Service AMAZING  total 360 first visit    I guess 3rd visit tie breaker  <EOR> I hamburger disgusting  Yucky  <EOR> I really excited try Cadillac Ranch few reasons first perhaps most shallowly because logo big 'CR' initials    must love right? Second because seeking fun place spend 30th birthday party which quickly approaching wanted give place practice run  Cadillac Ranch looks cool neat looking fire pit outside imagined friends clinking drinks around ringing new decade  lunch beau first experience hostess fairly unfriendly  hostess huge part experience restaurant because your first impression place am customer service snob  wanted sit outside she asked if high tables bar tables okay  Sure! outside turns high tables she referred actually direct sunlight  Vegas 1 p m  Las Vegas direct sunlight no fun! question shouldn't if minded high tables but if would minded sitting sun which case answer would yes  few tables outside unoccupied but hadn't cleaned  asked server nice but airhead if could move once them cleared off  Finally table cleared waiting wiped down but unfriendly hostess managed come another group people same moment between hostess waiter cat fight  She didn't know table hadn't even cleaned rag going sit people which grossed out  Eventually another dirty table sun cleaned second party everyone happy although beginning wonder if busser restaurant what? food came quickly boyfriend burger margherita pizza  pizza good pleasantly surprised turnaround time order considering obvious inexperience serving staff  Throughout meal boyfriend very thirsty person some reason absolutely no water left glass  He asked once twice but 3 times more water he even drank all mine! manager wandering around asked everything mentioned asked water three times yet nothing  really liked server's personality felt bad getting into trouble but geez dang water! only saving grace restaurant location experience friendly but all in all terrible server food okay  No 30th birthday party girl!

He probably thought giving grief smiling much waitress something that  no    then he really thought he trouble something finally told happy meal  He told send back    I didn't want back spit drenched steak opted settling it    I also ordered cocktail called Rock Candy $12 00 dollar drink but since happy hour came $6 00  ideas would look before came out  head pictured big Margarita glass contents being bright pink stick blue rock candy sticking it  thought price should only taste good but should look cute too! When waitress brought thought water lemons it  Then she came back ask liked drink  didn't try yet because thought just water took sip told good  first couple sips good but great  tasted more more watered down lemonade time on    We Banana's Foster dessert which thought would because before  version something experienced till now    first all no crepe   boo! warm bananas swimming around creme sauce scoop vanilla ice ream middle drizzled caramel  warm bananas good breakfast meal but dessert  only took three bites that    I don't writing bad reviews end did like  If wasn't Cadillac Ranch State Fries think would home hungry  jumbo potato seasoned fries cheese bacon sour cream  should ordered two meal would walked happy camper! <EOR> I'm sure where really start review place   It great location Town Square could good place stop if shopping going tothe movies there  kinda cool decor   sort rock n' roll theme guitars wall photos people Taylor Swift Bon Jovi  bar lots TVs sports too   We afternoon really dead which made feel service should fantastic but wasn't  sever Danielle seemed stoned mind  She talked really really slow said things restauarants genetic  recommendations 'cause work   She nice enough but visible dirt under fingernails she kept leaning all over table aforementioned recommendations   which kinda grossed out   The food drinks took FOREVER which again couldn't understand since practically only people there  ended ordering 2 appetizers pulled pork sliders cheeseburger sliders sharing  Both served french fries ICE COLD  sliders pretty good but nothing spectacular   It took forever check bill came over $30 only 2 appetizers iced tea soda  opinion WAY over priced!  I pretty much say certainty won't back  <EOR> Meatloaf sandwich yummy   bit pricey considering food style portions  <EOR> Was 2 stars very average bar food    until four year old sick off food   Cute girls doing all work but no redeeming qualities that   yourself favor Yard House downstairs instead  <EOR> We meet friends monday night  couple appetizers i e  jalopeno poppers nachos chicken quesadilla ribbitizer  Food great happy hour menu  But many long beach iced tea's patron shots everything taste good  <EOR> After Johnny McGuire's cousins decided hang Cadillac Ranch watch rest game  just Miller Lite tap since only $2 50 cup crappy plastic cup but whatever   This place seems decent spot  If you're MMA fan looks show PPVs regular basis  guess didn't stay long enough form negative opinion Cadillac Ranch  Skimming other reviews appears bad rap  think A OK  <EOR> Food OK  Steak luke warm garlic mashed potatoes    garlic  questioned if kitchen clean seeing men's restrooms  restroom unsightly hand towels overflowed trash receptacle smell horrific appears cleaned night before  think if restrooms clean must kitchen look like  <EOR> What expect place loud obnoxious this?

everything but adventure  Some those scene places changed mind before but visit solidifies why didn't step own volition    It half off drinks decided grab some libations advice people who've been skipped food  Leguntas IPA off draft bad  know old keg wasn't properly cared because know beer supposed taste tap  off  place isn't really crowd ordering much IPA's Lagers probably sit while Lites getting switched hotcakes  Even staff should watch kegs more carefully drain pour old stuff needed  impressed when saw something typical Bud Miller Coors tap made disappointment worse when couldn't even fresh  didn't complain because 3 dollars already sent back some incorrect black tans    Some party wanted black tan Guinness Sam Adams Boston Lager     waitress didn't know when came mixed instead split made think poured draft properly spooned separate beers  Someone later came said weights aren't correct split gave them Black Blue Guinness Blue Moon instead  Though couldn't dispute weight issue time later researching  Guinness Sam Adams does indeed exist Patriot Pint     I am waiting beeradvocate answers if indeed split blended together    We didn't know Band Battle locals night

sounds ripoff inspired people came before them  being ex never tell know well when people arranging music his    Yeah asshole saying but asshole music collection sitting home literally enough open music store music set friends high places industry  Until some quality band Panic does count because don't know play live big time then anyone bitching wonderful local scene wrong   Scenesters cry
