<EOR> I first started going original Hussong's Ensenada '73   amused see opened place Mandalay but expectations low given Las Vegas's tendency recreations skin deep best   Nonetheless having real thing few years due border violence wife decided check out   As far decor look place did good job expected   lot touches original   albeit lack grit wear years   The service pretty good   a young lady named Yolanda attentive friendly hostess seated us   fact Yolanda recommended excellent tequila although would much better if printed list which choose    The food another story  eaten restaurants all over Mexico resorts baja joints Mexico City  The salsas pretty good but everything else beans rice lobster tacos carne asada  bland presentation weak   Speaking presentatioin toreados jalapenos stuffed cheese sitting plate some mysteriouis brown liquid swishing around bottom   not very appetizing appetizer   also jalapenos should deveined seeded better   as result inedibly hot   Based experience typical case another Las Vegas restaurant knows don't rely repeat business because there's new load customers coming into town every day  Overall big disappointment but give credit designers did fairly credible job recreating look Hussong's wait staff friendlier lot LV restaurant staff   I seriously doubt we'll back unless hear dramatic changes food  <EOR> Seriously bad service   Nothing worse bartender attitude   If ask if pay reply maybe happy   drink sat empty long time   many places chose put horrible service  <EOR> This first time Mandalay Bay Hussongs  Gotta say food awesome  Great salsa green red  Chimichanga loaded hot nice crispness  little jealous wife's Baja burger  great too  Good service  Good waiter  Good place  Now we're gonna try breakfast  <EOR> If could give zero would  Horrible food service all around  also slow during time  First told couldn't seated because manager stepped out  Once seated took 10 minutes chips salsa  When finally brought chips salsa ready order  never received drinks food brought out  ask drinks which sitting bar  ordered steak burritos brought shredded beef good all  burrito cold  <EOR> We great experience Hussong's!

I ordered carnitas tacos  carnitas meat itself good shredded texture solid flavor  tortilla itself rather bland tore very easily eat half tacos fork  No biggie but eating tacos fork kinda weird  Other tacos made pineapple salsa good sweet tartness pineapple balanced against heat peppers  gave tacos its signature taste tasted okaaaay  Nothing mind blowingly spectacular but definitely different works!  Some other friends quesadillas which actually looked smelled fantastic  then other other friends baja sandwich which torta  looked quite delicious huge! only able finish half take rest home save later!  Warning place serves infinite chips red sauce yellow sauce  Super addictive  must've through 10 baskets chips time food finally served all full!!

Also when arrived restaurant no workers floor decided seat ourselves  TVs all still small place still quite some tables eating food  figured just little busy being late night specials   When staff member finally spotted he didn't say anything  ask if could menus only find restaurant already closed   They need CLOSED! sign  <EOR> Wow awful experience  Maybe off night? evening didn't nearly well some other reviews   What started off 30 40 minute wait turned into hour followed 45 minute wait food ordering  Service 0 5   Our food came extremely hit miss  Guacamole quesadilla burger fries oddly all great  Definitely would recommend those  However tacos awful Mexican cheesy rices badly undercooked beans off flavors carne asada rubbery salad criminally under lettuced all some worst Mexican food party ever had   We did manage free swag sunglasses shirts some restaurant sponsors but did very little $150 spent pretty awful experience  YMMV <EOR> Great food great drinks fun atmosphere  Service super friendly very attentive  definitely hit place again next time  <EOR> Extra star given many vegan menu options  vegan companion able order vegan chile relleno   taco plate okay  stopped dinner before show last weekend House Blues venue just hop down escalator  Very convenient  Blackberry Splash drink muddled blueberry tequila ginger liqeuor very refreshing  <EOR> I wish East Coast!

But food actually pretty unique if adventurous   high quality food price reflects e g  $4 per taco which small street tacos      You bone marrow tacos which actually would recommend beef cheek tacos which recommend if gamey flavors tongue tacos gotta try everything least once bad!    Just keep mind portion sizes seriously small charge extra things normally wouldn't expect getting diced tomatoes lettuce your tacos   mean seriously 50 cents lettuce tacos!?! better some seriously good mind blowing lettuce   Just sure ask lot questions portion size presentation before ordering aren't surprised disappointed   example other reviewers said nachos basically individual chips nacho toppings expertly placed them   typical huge plate tortilla chips covered toppings normally associate bar food   One thing great place mariachi band   hilarious!  them harp!  play great variety songs occasionally call audience participation which score free drinks   friend loudest yelling TEQUILA! during Tequila song which scored free tequila shots   Also chips salsa free both pretty good! Despite fact chips come appears popcorn machine   Keep open mind stay away margaritas prepared shell bit more normally would sure come when mariachi band playing call ahead    Then good time! <EOR> Went quick dinner before heading house blues  thing say damn classic margarita strong ! But it  If sweet may want chat bar tender  am sure accommodate all margaritas have!  Which leads next point service  waiter very top work busy Saturday night  Additionally management came over table multiple times sure everything taken care of    My friend ordered split al pastor chicken barbacoa spelling ??? tacos 3 tacos per order side guac because Mexican restaurant order some guac!!    I personally liked barbacoa tacos best ! rice beans come guac tomatoes much lemon lime taste which wasn't thing reason 4 stars    Atmosphere busy Saturday night but crowded  may place if children people sensitive loud sounds because loud music band plays  music did bother thought band added ambiance but could see may bother some people just heads up    Pro tips Ask locals discount sure check free shot grilled corn  <EOR> Happy hour worth it!!  Original margaritas half off boy strong!!  $3 tacos best carnitas ever tasted  <EOR> On way Luxor Mandalay Bay wanted try Burger Barn   wait over hour starving   decided try Hussong's   It's more sports bar Mexican restaurant   worked since love basketball could watch few games same time   We ordered    Blackberry Splash Margarita good El Poblano Margarita AMAZING!

All all very dishonest upsetting visit  Very very disappointed favorite restaurant no longer Hussong's Cantina  <EOR> Decided Mexican lunch today while shopping playing tourist Las Vegas Mandalay Bay!  seated right away shortly waitress brought complimentary chips salsa   nice!  Ordered margarita which good but considering say home original margarita kind expected better margarita!  deal breaker though   lunch hubby myself both ordered chicken enchiladas came rice beans   must say enchiladas pretty tasty   However rice beans could very well left off plate    me no likey!  Service subpar   waitress seemed very overwhelmed pushy   Overall would consider returning but wouldn't first even second when comes Mexican food! <EOR> Bulldogs! thursdays bulldogs large margarita pacifico dunked in believe they're special then  Granted place won't knock your socks off fusion mexican if your're looking elsewhere  Nor does claim simply good standard mexican fare Vegas prices yeah means more people!
