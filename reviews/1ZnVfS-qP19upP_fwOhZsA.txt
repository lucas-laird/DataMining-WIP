This authentic restaurant screams feed soul your warm food  find specials postered walls small joint seems only locals know appreciate scent satay pan bite into your garlic infused ong choy enjoy classic no b s  attitude waitress which reminds ok service but great food    No glitz no glam kind place  Just sit back chill dine until hit spot! average price $4 6 item pop $1 rice bowl $1  Can't that  keep menu short serve quick  Waitress says lil bit everything but don't everything  Meaning= Pan Asian menu no fried rice! Don't ask you'll yelled at  Hahaha    Everything great! ordered salt n pepper chicken wings wonton shrimp w udon noodle soup satay garlic ong choy good soy sauce    Cons wooden chop sticks plastic spoon <EOR> I always trust yelp reviews    But definitely time somehow mistake   I excited going especially attracted food choice its price  I am totally DISAPPOINTED!  We ordered salt pepper pork chop fried pork chop both good  think something wrong breading  $1 milk tea lemon tea take tea bag home then add milk  The Malaysian curry recommended waitress instant curry   The EGG porridge totally awful   The waitress nice still gave tip but really don't feel should charged anything food  <EOR> Seriously butt fudge wrong people  salt pepper wings amazing sweet roti perfect dessert wings  If want super duper fancy take yer beautifully waxed uppity butt hole strip oh wait  right yer broke butt cheek vacation trying save money looking something cheap picked wrong menu item now yer complaining food service  First off little actually well pretty tall old Asian man hat super cool he's jokes especially if take time know him  only did ever stop think maybe English isn't great maybe  why he seems little rude only know because he reminds grandma when she first came America all she wanted burger would drive around all drive thrus asking Big Mac people would say don't she would just drive off now she sticks making food home even tho know she wants burger every now then sadly she only knows Big Mac  trying say he's cool guy almost always only server cut some slack show some respect he's hard working man just trying everyone else  <EOR> This quite popular joint Chinese foods expect wait time less attention table  ordered Chicken curry ok didn't meet taste buds  different story  Fried pepper wings pepper fish good  <EOR> I honestly think people missing biggest thing menu which special DEEP FRIED CHICKEN  #5 6b does take 15 mins warn if your super hungry super impatient but 100% worth wait  100% because fried chicken tastes freaking good gravy comes plate   ask extra gravy sauce because its delicious  I always #5 because dark meat tried almost everything menu hoi nam chicken shrimp wonton noodle soup salt pepper chicken wings  ALWAYS seasoned rice well  place if your budget its good portion size  <EOR> Hard find down  earth eateries days such economical pricing! even come Qualities!  Well worth your money though small place nothing fancy  <EOR> Maybe ordered wrong things? Having grown eating Chinese Taiwanese food place just seemed so   bleh  would honestly pick run mill Americanized Chinese restaurant over place  wrong?  We ordered fried shrimp wontons stewed beef oyster sauce pork ribs black beans sauce salt pepper chicken wings  wontons greasy beef stew much cornstarch sauce jello ribs weren't cooked long enough no flavor chicken wings weren't seasoned  Am being hyper critical? don't think white husband also thought food below average    Then there's service  know many Chinese restaurants don't win over customers friendly service but guy really takes cake  He doesn't greet just points table tells sit  heard speak Chinese speak kitchen staff but when customers speak Chinese he pretends he doesn't understand  Then old man comes asks sit corner but he forces customer sit table kitchen shakes head customer pest  Why open restaurant if can't bothered treat your customers basic decency? <EOR> I've going 4 years now just 'chicken curry 3 roti' because its closest tasting home find   tastes Indian Pakistani style curry more Chinese style curry   way love keep going back  <EOR> Visited restaurant first time weekend  5 pm Saturday pretty quiet only other group eating  Service fast  young girl waited kind friendly  meal filling delicious  salt pepper wings fried wontons wonton soup noodles  place some character hand written menus hanging wall kept immaculate  felt comfortable    back try some other things menu soon  <EOR> I totally echoed some other reviewers service really sucked there! never smiled sometimes feel customers paying them treat customers badly  don't care if give them business not  price very attractive but then visting couple times eventually figured worth because never ate comfortably restaurant when faces the only lady served customers kitchen staff especially female cook always look upset  Why can't smile little more? another reviewer said always said thank when being seated when drinks came when food came said thank you  But no acknowledgement thanks face whatever    The first time asked very politely if bathroom i asked placing orders lady giving irritated look if fool ask   I think food cheap because only few employees there  guess  why no good service think anyone could postal if everything no help  did see only lady taking orders serving drinks bringing food sweeping floor etc all herself  Poor thing     and poor customers too  guess  why only lady always irritated face  Though empathetic still disagree such kind service  But still can't figure why female cook irritated face  male cook doesn't irritated look  But then he works kitchen mostly can't really compensate unpleasant aura caused other 2 ladies  way female cook doesn't come often but time she did came she looked if eye sore just eating doing anything wrong though   I think would rather starved instead going back again    way much discomfort eat unpleasant aura  worth though food cheap  <EOR> After reading all rave reviews very disappointed trying place first time     Shrimp wontons bland bit overcooked   Chicken curry roti roti bit greasy chicken curry came small cup which many more potato chunks chicken   Hainan chicken came decent portion but very bland bit dry     Other place clean service great friendly   True lot dishes $5 but given lack taste wouldn't mind pay little more better tasting food  <EOR> First time trying restaurant  food delicious price very inexpensive  would definitely come again  <EOR> Ok so   I gave second try before writing review   would say beef ramen   I love noodles use really good   much broth flavor but doctor condiments if right kind   may some pho restaurants offers   beef tasty ask if want tendons not   cool     Hainan chicken w rice   it decent sauce could better   course am judging experience eating famous dish Thailand   come dish bc again home due much work ask white meat w o extra charge   Ong choy vegetables decent too   Then ended sweet roti ok     2nd visit     Good wonton soup would again   Fish ball curry well guess don't Malaysian style curry won't any curry dishes since Malay base curry  Chicken wings umm   really salty any other flavor     I want place   restuarant really really clean   think lady owner OCD good way she spays clean table right customers leave   a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  really nice courteous cook constantly asking he place better   told price right far more business if improve flavor food   Nevertheless if hungry want something fast eat Mcdonald's   it's alternative <EOR> You must try restaurant if visiting Vegas  If want fill your stomach good food then right place  If want relaxing excellent customer services then wrong place strip place should go   I came due Yelp's reviews dinner very big restaurant table seating setup good group 4 6 persons if more 6 your group then expecting longer wait separating into 2 tables   Now food ordered Hainan Chicken Rice fried shrimp wonton  Hainan Chicken Rice best tasted far West Coast  Hainan Chicken Rice very similar Thai style chicken rice would say 95% similar  chicken meat very good tender soft hard believe rice steam cooked chicken soup because just eating rice itself already very tasty  fried shrimp wonton very crispy shrimp fresh too  would recommended two choices   For services would agree out staff patient them  Especially lady waitress she everything taking order serving cleaning setup table take phone order cashier  patient   We even came back next day lunch  food would come back again  Oh! forgot mention more thing price! unbelievable cheap! <EOR> Amazing food!!!

Let's just say don't hate but something would typically order very same reason many commented  But does mean all foods created equal   But recommend some following dishes also go to's Salt pepper chicken wings they're crispy salty addition jalapenos usually pack good amount punch!  Salt pepper pork chop same chicken wings flavor 99% time most moist pork ever had  Thin rib eye yes fatty but some people that yes served potatoes seems odd no doesn't seem Asian food many Asian food but partners friends don't? Well then maybe answer your question why menu     Curry Chicken need realize isn't your typical Thai Indian curry chicken Malaysian yes tastes different you're used  amazing stop comparing apples oranges  Chicken mushroom Chinese sausage dish takes long time prepare warned but worth it chicken tender broth rich Chinese sausage well some veggies just served side  veggies no seasoning but meant dipped into broth  In fact left during review eat it  Steamed fish filet only because saw new picture menu wall again without sauce would bland BUT tender delicious ginger soy sauce  ordered twice now   So those gave negative reviews   I suggest give another shot something know good  those haven't tried S P wings and or pork chop Steamed chicken mushroom w Chinese sausage  Though sure some still tough please  <EOR> Being experienced foodie doesn't take much think Vegas' 'China Town' anything but  If anything you think more along lines 'Little Saigon' due amounts delicious Pho places maybe could even call 'Seoul Town' relation great Korean BBQ  'Taiwanese Town' relation its spectacular Boba Milk locations    But when stumbled #BigWongs man chefs turned everything knew upside down putting exclamation point 'We China Town!' traditional simplified plates sizzling Chinese broccoli    So if you're hunt real Chinese food take you'll need look further  FIVE STARS BABY! <EOR> Great spot tasty cheap filling meal  Shrimp wontons addicting! always boneless fried chicken chicken wings  yourself favor seasoned rice!

Especially considering mom pop shop wonder manage any money  ordered four Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice large ribeye side bok choy choy sum oyster sauce  Portions generous which also appreciated  And    that's all accolades give place   I hainan chicken anywhere else Vegas HOWEVER dish plenty times multiple different places Southern California  and dish frequently made home  AUTHENTIC version dish uses free range chicken where chicken does feel very tough when boiled  case here  probably what's keeping price low but c'monnnn advertise authentic then? Additionally rice overly mushy  much chicken stock water used cook it  rice very fragrant could've benefited throwing garlic ginger into mix  Sauces okay  nothing write home about  ribeye great deal $12  pretty fatty but hey $12 bucks won't complain much  Choy sum literally just blanched then oyster sauce poured over it would've better if sauteed veggies oyster sauce  Pouring directly over just dish super salty  know being super nit picky given super cheap place  Food passable  If judging food alone would come back every often   So why 2 stars? biggest gripe place service  plenty Chinese restaurants know service priority  annoyed most never friendly smile waiter  and definitely saw smile other patrons  aunt tried ordering Chinese because hellooooo Chinese restaurant part menu written Chinese  and waiter rudely interrupts English only  Chinese  Okay  nothing against being able speak language but there's definitely more tactful way conveying your patrons  Then ordering dishes he stops mid order tells ordering much food three chicken dishes + extra rice sufficient party four  O K  if overorder bring home? Isn't beneficial business patrons order more food? More orders = more money? If concerned portions then would ask portion sizes no? But okay    TL DR Super cheap food  Passable food  But better super thick skin x239028390 awful service free advice much should eating  <EOR> I came yesterday Thanksgiving day food service excellent!!!  ordered beef brisket tendon noodle soup pig's feet entree Chinese broccoli oyster sauce   owner came kitchen talk friend complimented taste ordering off menu   He extremely friendly tell he really takes time craft menu dishes carefully   also sampler deep fried Thanksgiving turkey well done!!!  highly recommend place definitely coming back next time LV  <EOR> I heard lot Big Wong wanted try attending conference area earlier day   craving lately salt pepper anything   ordered salt pepper chicken wings bok choy     The server very friendly   where sat could see directly into kitchen entertained watching chef prepare dishes   Everything seemed clean orderly efficiently handled both server chef   My food came very satisfying   chicken wings generous amount jalapenos made happy   bok choy generously seasoned garlic   good but glad didn't kiss anybody day!  liked bok choy very young made easy eat   As sipping tea looking around began notice few things   number brightly colored posters walls   suggestion management if may don't see your patrons going around reading posters   posters don't send positive marketing message overall   think would look better take them down don't replace anything maybe few pictures theme   also noticed while kitchen table eating seemed very clean backs chairs clean floors baseboards need good scrubbing   hope management think suggestions   I very satisfied meal look forward going back such friendly restaurant  <EOR> The ingredients fresh delicious  beef great! ramon noodles die very inexpensive whole family loved it!!! <EOR> this place ia bomb!  soy sauce chicken best ever had!  best food best prices <EOR> This guilty pleasure eat myself Chinese hole wall  Cheap understatement  Curry beef rice personal favorites  Big portions cheap really feel am mom pop restaurant Southeast Asia  Ambience lacking but come food price   ordered several things time takeaway no cooking weekend   Wife loves fried fish salt pepper wings  Kids love everything here   can't lunch without picking take away wife else she me  <EOR> Just finished dinner everything DELICIOUS! 5 ordered variety dishes demolished everything  especially liked chicken wings shrimp wontons which ordered appetizers also loved curry chicken not overpowering very flavorful thin tenderloin over noodles tender flavorful w delicious sauce Thai tea  Only 12 tables simple decor but seamed clean service good  5 chowed $80 total could easily filled $60 maybe less  definitely recommend back  <EOR> Went lunch before leaving Vegas  lady greeted nice  description menu very helpful decision making process  ordered salt pepper wings which juicy crispy appetizer then chinese broccoli oyster sauce white meat chicken rib eye  chicken little bit dry but rib eye broccoli superb  prices unbelievably cheap  bill $23 thai coffee  <EOR> We ordered chicken curry rice roti wonton noodles Hainanese chicken rice   They well done especially chicken curry  curry spicy kick   The Chicken rice flavorful too    The portions substantial prices unbelievably affordable  family five great meal $25  <EOR> My favorite place !!!! eat 5 times week lol cuz its cheap! <EOR> Excellent food!

Big Wong located shopping plaza other very popular restaurants Snowflake Raku Monta small hole wall restaurant easy miss  menu short simple but food all tasty especially being inexpensive  Hoi Nam Chicken Hainese Chicken rice deep fried pork chop currently favorites highly recommend trying them along rest menu  Only negative food take while when crowded staff number small  I highly recommend trying big Wong and then snow flake dessert  <EOR> I feeling adventurous just wanted try new eatery out  Maybe biased because Chinese    lol but chose Chinese place plaza try out   genuinely no real complaints reasonable prices diners pay  enjoyed experience  <EOR> Finally made restaurant good!  cheap!  Try steamed chicken mushrooms chinese sausage broccoli   Extremely tasty     We also tried baby bok choy chicken curry roti steamed chicken beef curry salt pepper wings   All $26!  couldn't eat all food leftovers dinner tomorrow   really can't it   could probably eat three plates chicken curry roti if left own devices   No alcohol but some folks back doing BYOB  <EOR> I'm sure why people amazed beef ramen but very disappointing  full beef flavor otherwise very plain  hai nan chicken rice mom ordered nasty  white meat tough? Whatever did even dipping sauces didn't help  Fish porridge pretty thick  Didn't look appetizing  Overall given price food ok but doubt I'd coming back  Looking four star yelp feel really cheated  give two star    On another note why food places ALWAYSSSSS forget drink? Food #2 place forgot drink during trip vegas  <EOR> I come take out  food authentic delicious price simply beat! pretty much basic fast food prices except quality much better     Chinese service pretty notorious being friendly efficient keep mind treated royalty     recommendations would Chinese bok choy ong choy garlic flavor must try would salt pepper shrimp pork chicken  Those final three items come little bit spice probably some heroin because addicting!    hope give place try based off price flavor  <EOR> NOTHING WONG HERE!! place great! But must want authentic experience enter open mind    You find typical items menu  actually no idea order many familiar Asian dishes  But past Yelpers said before shrimp wontons salt pepper wings eat little peppers beef ramen pork chop all excellent   You won't find fried rice but seasoned rice light delicious    The VALUE amazing! back  <EOR> OK second update because found myself craving Big Wong's Hainan Chicken twice last 3 days  first time while Eastside Asian restaurant where Hainan Chicken $18 half $25 whole thought myself Man kind money could neck Hainan Chicken Big Wong! second time just now  Talk slow simmer couple months since eaten want back  don't know till gone  Cinderella 1988 I best campaign Big Wong Mr  Tofu Circle Frequent Eats I just made don't actually official Mr  Tofu Circle Frequent Eats but sounds cool Disneyland ride  am happy Big Wong exists  value undeniable  next solo meal mission sure! <EOR> Wow!

Lord prices  Most dishes $4 95  Yes  still place Las Vegas eat $5 does consist In n out tiny slices pizza  Despite less stellar experience foods previously listed some standout dishes should definitely try  chicken wings superb  ribeye actually pretty good usually just order take noodles then douse something else sizzling plate veggies amazing ask old Asian guy does everything it! shrimp wontons hit right spot beef ramen combination college dorm life fancy gourmet ramen shop  guaranteed leave STUFFED   Just warning though  Don't come expect perfect customer service  Chinese restaurant son! guy does all old Asian guy white hat doesn't smile unless giggling baby your arms doesn't speak Chinese  Expect comfort food insanely cheap prices you'll leave happy customer    The parking also sucks because Big Wong shares same parking lot Vegas favorites Kung Fu Tea Monta Ramen  patient if doesn't work there's deserted furniture store left Big Wong's  Take risk park if want  haven't any problems but never know  <EOR> cheap good food!! Authentic Chinese food dumplings good  Beef Noodle its lot food pay for <EOR> Great place come good cheap food but because recent service experiences sad downgrade them because no longer 4 star quality overall when factor terrible customer service  If want take sure call your order before showing avoid being questioned why didn't call advance  when dining don't ask split checks because just pisses off lady she'll likely tell off she did us  Prices also gone last few months because now charge sales tax whereas before always included price   I usually same few things when coming hoi nam chicken w seasoned rice fried chicken chicken wings  avoiding fried items lately because always told takes extra 20 30 min   is never prepped advance? Very odd  only thing would recommend getting beef ramen because Chinese place don't right  think they're only offering compete Monta next door definitely worth getting despite cheap $5 95 price tag   People think place fast but really not  always waiting while food whether dining taking out  usually only 1 server couple kitchen staff which likely why   Not sure why people working always grouchy   especially lady serves food! <EOR> This good choice if you're looking inexpensive food way back home Vegas  actually good amount price pay quality good too  Some Chinese restaurants cheap wonton only pinch meat but Big Wongs isn't cheap that  highly recommend salt pepper chicken wings    Parking difficult find but there's lot right across street probably park at    The atmosphere whole different story  would rated place 2 stars if weren't good food  smaller restaurant where kitchen right seating area isn't door anything separates 2 rooms  service isn't bad but only main server running entire restaurant 2 other guys helping  wait time order food served everything overall short considering short staffed were  Then there's main guy seems manager directing everyone tables serve  Except he isn't talking them indoor voice    he's literally shouting them entire restaurant listening  putting show us  he's trying run restaurant efficiently which he but need door separating rooms  He needs understand does create peaceful dining experience customers    I've 4 times only happened once  Hopefully they'll read change methods interacting each other customers more enjoyable experience  <EOR> ordered curry chicken roti salt pepper chicken wing almond pudding  everything taste good  service excellent   you must try almond pudding  really good  <EOR> Hey if you're going Wong big right?

The main thing Big Wong's going price everything's pretty cheap  2 dishes 3 drinks bill $10  Also service very fast friendly  asked if milk kids even though don't serve waitress nice enough couple glasses $1 each  Overall glad tried but ton better Chinese fast food places aren't all way across town  <EOR> Probably most affordable Chinese food find Las Vegas  place always does trick  Everything around $8 piece  usually Noodle soup Hainan Chicken  place perfect if you 1 Lose much money while gambling  2 Partied hard need some recovery food  Plenty parking restaurant plaza  <EOR> Big Wong?  Yes  Yes  million times yes  don't know why didn't start going place until recently because place literally treasure    It's located probably best food plaza Spring Mountain easily gets overshadowed Monta Curry Zen Raku but wow!

We all tried each others dishes curry chicken great flavor more Japanese style which like but tad greasy   The fried pork chops also good but better when dip sauce give beef stock taste it   We also ordered some vegetables oyster sauce okay nothing special since just steamed boiled Chinese broccoli sauce   Overall success cause meal came $7 95 5 entrees 4 drinks special   would defiantly come back since regular prices still bad all $4 95 including tax  <EOR> The food dirt cheap   I mean $5 entree? Yes any day  said keep mind $5 restaurant   this neither time nor place try new interesting food  Stick basics you'll just fine   I thought shrimp wonton noodles 4 5 5 just should be  wontons weren't very big but did contain ample amount shrimp  broth very simple chicken broth nothing special added not even scallions! decent amount noodles  Solid comfort food if ask me   Other entrees ordered included Fried pork chop noodles 2 5 incredibly salty  House special steamed chicken over rice 1 5 just terrible  order  Shrimp wonton beef stew clear broth noodle 4 5 5 Additionally salt pepper wings very good 4 5 5   While flavor didn't penetrate interior very well wings perfectly crisp amazingly juicy inside  Also $4 95 plate came 9 jumbo wings unheard of!  In regards people claiming hostess rude family hardly experience  fact she rather attentive   granted did all ordering Cantonese which may made difference  <EOR> We originally going Ramen Sora but busy drove Monta but closed  Saw Big Wong yelped 4 star review decided check out  2 beef ramen noodle 1 fried chicken w noodle soda  Came $18!!

But last night different     Our usual spot dark some reason backup location jam packed quick check Yelp revealed Big Wong Restaurant  reviews solid food appeared somewhat authentic non standard some menus tend be  Big Wong shares parking lot few culinary heavy hitters despite lot being full crowds waiting outside few other restaurants entered restaurant found several open tables no wait   Let fast forward food  prices Big Wong very low despite food good  ordered deep fried shrimp wontons pork chop chicken enjoyed food  menu your standard Chinese food don't bother looking sweet sour pork chow mein    From moment stepped foot inside restaurant service terrible  woman behind cash register only hostess she also waitress food server  she completely overwhelmed point being overtly rude customers especially family! said try take personally but being sat down such haste wasn't even drink order taken  sat table 10 minutes while she scurried around struggled figure triage food service  Keep mind restaurant full half tables well underway eating dinner  Just stood walk minimal eye contact whole time though if she didn't look problem maybe would just away! she came over took food drink order    Once order placed food drinks actually arrived fairly quickly  But no follow during dinner along all other customers walk over grab condiments napkins counter  best part when family six walked in  waitress escorted family table then turned quickly away them she actually crashed into dad still directly behind causing quite ruckus! Another couple entered restaurant seated being ignored 10 minutes finally walked out   Not sure if try place again much choose China Town  If decide hopefully you'll better service  <EOR> This place great authentic Chinese food very reasonable price  several times  usually hoi nam chicken seasoned rice boneless dark meat   seasoned rice nice steer away plain white rice  chicken always tender  two sauces comes dish really gives its flavor  chicken wings also da bomb  They're crispy seasoned very well  also sliced jalapeños comes wings  fried pork rice also pretty good  would also recommend trying pork congee if you're able your hands some they usually it   flavor decent but can't price $4! wouldn't fish congee    little fishy taste me  beef ramen could better  would recommend paying little more ramen place making your own ramen  Overall place must try    pleasantly surprised won't break bank  Warning parking really suck  <EOR> This vietnamese food chinese food  taste just so  seems most reviews fooled me  <EOR> It second time having dinner we're coming back  food decent fairly cheap  friend ordered ribeye rice sauce alright special expected  ordered beef ramen portion huge beef tender but broth kind bland   The customer service terrible! waited 10 minutes nobody even bothered come order place wasn't even crowded  waiter supposed everyone's order never came table asked someone else instead he looked confused  best part found hair ramen I don't want guess where originally   didn't even bother tell them because looked could spit food yell any time  <EOR> Salt pepper wings somewhat religious experience   The steamed chicken simple goodness   I thought wonton soup meh    but wife disagreed   Also complain getting lunch $16? <EOR> Superb customer service  Salt pepper chicken wings delicious really really Hainan chicken rice Their sauces also very good   More anything price worth eating!!

What surprised most pleasant welcoming reception received when walked in   Yes may non Asian face smiling walked but definitely gave different impression meal going be   Getting drink beverage orders way easy decide amongst 15 item menu   I Hoi Nam Chicken $4 95    three variations Boneless Dark Meat version   surprisingly moist decent portioned   Yes better also lot worse especially Vegas but decent   seasoned rice accompanied could bit more seasoned but worked   The Husband Shrimp Wonton Soup $4 95    soup came six generous all shrimp dumplings some Chinese vegetables   give them credit making very shrimpy dumpling no filler     We didn't realize grand opening special limited per person per visit ahead ordered another beverage score couple more free entrees   This time Curry Chicken Roti Pancakes $4 95    loved version roti overly greasy nice flaky texture crunch   curry chicken potatoes good flavor too   The Husband tried Deep Fried Pork Chop $4 95 found disappointing   wasn't quite expected dried out   bad one  Apparently request crispy if want way   but  news us! When came time pay then discovered going charged second entrees   Due waitress's mistake took off bill without any hassle which something really appreciated   didn't even charge second round beverages rather telling leave server instead   Now gotta love that!
