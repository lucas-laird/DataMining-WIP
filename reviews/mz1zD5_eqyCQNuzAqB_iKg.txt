I say little confused when arrived because lot smaller less charming thought  Many other Yelpers accidentally posted pictures intended Pancho's Downtown Summerlin  completely different restaurant  reported those pictures hopefully taken down quite misleading  restaurant really small probably best takeout though there's plenty tables dine which did first time   I ordered vegan Tamal $8 50 which tamale wrapped swiss chard boyfriend ordered vegan Breakfast Burrito $9 without tofu scramble  usually included burrito they out   picked Tamal because only gluten free vegan item sensitivity which sick if much  However seems pretty accommodating other dishes gluten free  man woman working when very nice people   We sat down wait brought over some chips salsa  Chips yummy   both vegan gluten free   but weren't many all maybe just handful  Additionally salsa squirt bottles which handy when receive your entree but kind weird when you're eating your chips because can't dip them  salsa verde delicious though! entrees came moments later thoroughly enjoyed them  boyfriend both agreed Tamal kind weird aftertaste which attribute swiss chard which sometimes bitter  Don't wrong deliciously vegan tamale ordering again! can't expect vegan food taste same non vegan food  wonderful substitute! However little skimpy rice beans well well honestly eat lot! ended ordering additional side rice $1 50 second half tamale  also squirted bunch salsa verde rice give some more flavor  boyfriend demolished burrito  only complaint starchy which he says would probably fixed adding tofu scramble hopefully they'll next time!   tried potatoes burrito seasoned perfection  also tried horchata which pretty good   I'll back excited try rest vegan dishes  Maybe even tonight dinner Thanks Pancho's including vegan gluten free items menu! <EOR> Amazing food made fresh!!
