Marvin  Such great service  Very polite thorough  recommend Juan's Flaming Fajitas everyone know loves great Mexican cuisine  Six thumbs Sebastian  Six thumbs Marvin six thumbs Juan fajitas  Fire! <EOR> I wasn't much disappointed place surprised ordinariness   four five star reviews led expect something better  food okay but definitely better Mexican food Las Vegas    I chicken taco chicken enchilada  certainly adequate but extraordinary  sister ground beef taco feeling same  thought sauce lacked kick anything might really stand out    The decor pretty much standard place little loud    I say service good  line waiting old friends catching up  thought fact overstayed welcome well handled    I'd say if live neighborhood need quick meal place go  If you're looking great Mexican food Las Vegas better choices  <EOR> Nice staff clean restaurant great menu happy hour!  Tacos Al Pastor good size great flavor  course always fill chips bean salsa dips can't finish entree  Also tried shrimp cocktail on hh menu which pretty good  raspberry margarita hh which far sweet lacked any alcohol    sopapillas dessert! Great airy perfectly fried dough honey whipped cream    Great place but could've done bit more happy hour menu  <EOR> So delicious! came Tuesday surprisingly busy but staff made feel if only ones there  food fresh tasty but still reasonably priced  can't wait back margarita lively bar area  <EOR> Absolutely Awesome chips Salsa bean dip queso  fajitas amazing  Tacos tostada combo excellent   Ask Omar!!! <EOR> Love place  Consistent service top notch  One might think Hmm fajitas doesn't usually mean dry chicken stiff steak? at least  thought but proven wrong time time again Juan's  Juan's fajitas benchmark fajitas  almost if meats proteins come slightly rare purpose knowing perfect temperature 30 flaming seconds time which takes assemble your first fajita nab first bite   If fajitas LOVE place  If don't fajitas try Juan's understand why fajitas exist  Awesome salsa bean dip too  <EOR> Here again because best  national Margarita day  hostess washing off menus between seating people which awesome  hate sticky menus  <EOR> This best Mexican food Las Vegas! service unbelievable food simply fantastic! met Juan owner just see passion why restaurant doing fantastic  Unbelievable food check out  <EOR> I start fact waiter some mood day went  service ideal drinks rarely refilled he just general nice  However even though seriously underwhelmed service didn't take any stars off everyone bad day! sat down 30 minutes before happy hour ended he would give happy hour pricing  guess advice would finish your meal before happy hour ends!   So without considering service place three stars  food alright  sampler platter quesadilla underwhelming say least  wasn't toasted outside which prefer them but even adjusting cheese might well can  chips came alongside refried beans better but taquitos basically flavorless  Shrimp cocktail usually saving grace any Mexican eatery least favorite Vegas  wasn't bad still ate but wasn't good  If first time having shrimp cocktail style probably wouldn't bothered try again    If friend wanted try place I'd back but wouldn't choose own  <EOR> My family heard great things restaurant! eating recommending eating more often  Great food great service! parents first time trying place did disappoint  place packed 10 minute wait  When sat down given salsa chips soup  ordered steak fajitas two came beans rice  $28 think great offer!
