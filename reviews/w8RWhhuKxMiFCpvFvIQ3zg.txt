OOOHHHH well  So am reminiscing trip L V  then all sudden taste buds savoring chocolaty tastiness Max Brenner  Which reason writing review it  3 other people let's just say we're all very critical precise when comes food   The wait was  okay wait friggin' forever  Prolly 40 minutes so  HEY PANSY REALLY IMPATIENT MOMENT OKAY??! Anyways   finally called over  me stupid self galloped over table gazing beautiful bald chocolate man's animated face  I  I mean menu    Uhh just confirm when there  make sure order something involving CHOCOLATE  Oh god most people surrounding ordered sandwiches  I mean REALLY?! Sup that?! ordered Classic European Chocolate Fondue which enough two but never tried nor know portion size decided just order one  going create huge hype fondue since only served huge sticky mouth watering marshmellows fresh strawberries bananas  with thick sweet sugary plentiful white chocolate milk dark chocolate  sounds aight? Well SURE HELL WAS! whole setting enjoying definitely comin' back some fondue swag  drinks ordered couple o' Mexican Spicy Hot chocolates Melting Marshmellow Hot Chocolates  Overall okay  Sweet chocolaty basically    When comes way place looks pretty relaxing  Nice lighting ambiance waiters smell  oh smell  Honestly nice time even if food wouldn't good thought  Even bathrooms stunning  Wow such loser  Anyways if your liddo curious mind wondering if should hurrr IT! <EOR> Place quality food service yet slow since feel understaffed because staff works really fast despite slow speed <EOR> In brief food disappointment but service concept exceptional  Max Brenner highly anticipated opening Chocolate shop restaurant inside Forum Shops addition other locations around world statewide  looking through mouthwatering menu decided chocolate pizza which comprised melted milk chocolate choice banana topping among others minced hazelnuts  disappointment tough thick crust did complement smooth milk chocolate topping  Fortunately disappointing regarded assumed Mr  Brenner himself granted another menu choice  chose another disappointment Max Wich which unoriginal chocolate ice cream filling between dense overly chewy cookie bottom stale textured hard bite cookie should asked recommendations before ordering but now all say worth prices  <EOR> I dark hot chocolate! But just dark hot chocolate  rest items tried just ok  rest chicken wings I forgot name but wasn't nuts it shake popsicle fondue  think chicken wings honey top sweet      which good  sweet tooth but want savory food sweet  bummer  think shake called 80's shake  dark chocolate menu said milk choco but asked them change dark vanilla ice cream chocolate shell  though everything blended shake but when came actually dark chocolate shake granita scoop ice cream top chocolate shell ice cream  execution bit expected appealing us  Lastly popsicle fondue way way way sweet  popsicle made vanilla ice cream which sweet already  Then chocolate dipping milk chocolate which way way way sweet passed point being yummy    I meant dip wasn't yummy all  ground pistachio nuts wafer balls dipping even more sweet  Don't wrong sweet but only its optimum level  think disaster when things above optimum point    My husband freaked sweet chicken wings doesn't want try other savory items again  think back only dark hot chocolate  Why? sweet but real chocolate flavor bitter sour  Some dark chocolate very bitter sour but case hot dark chocolate  chocolate because its sweetness but its distinctive aroma  When chocolate sweet aroma masked all tasting just sugar chocolate  <EOR> One favorite chocolate places pleased see during stay Ceasars  always amazing chocolate would recommend definite stop during your LV visit   Would also visit NYC if town  <EOR> If love desserts then definitely place you  Real food   uh great but desserts  Wow  Delicious! But first real food right? ordered tomato pizza some kind pulled pork sliders philly cheesesteak sliders  sliders tasty but pulled pork slider especially tasty  server said favorite he definitely correct  cheesesteak just okay comparison but still good  pizza good all  send back because soggy  cheese tasted rubber dough wet couldn't even pick hands even fork knife! Instead pizza ordered some other kind slider ham turkey maple syrup  actually quite good    Now desserts other sweet things! eighties milk shake A mazing  icy chocolate drink part scoop vanilla ice cream perfect together  chocolate shell top tasty touch  loved glass served much over store bought only chocolate but also mugs glasses! Italian hot chocolate decadent  little thicker normal hot chocolate definitely hundred times better!  dessert sharing two milk chocolate apple caramel crisp  milk chocolate apple wasn't favorite combination  just okay  wouldn't order again  sampler delicious  came banana split waffle chocolate cake chocolate egg roll chocolate crispy bar things chocolate crispy balls chocolate sauce fruit marshmallows chocolate fondue  If could would eat waffle breakfast! yummy! chocolate cake just okay  egg roll least favorite  also only thing left place when left  chocolate bars probably favorite thing there  Imagine kit kat but waaayyy better  crispy ball things tasted chocolate covered cheerios favorite thing plate  chocolate fondue yummy! could roast marshmallows then dip chocolate but ended just eating chocolate spoon! delicious!  Overall think should just skip main meal part just straight dessert  Why order real food chocolate place? sampler delicious would definitely recommend if want try several desserts but think serves way more two maybe three people? eighties milk shake must  try it! check shop! bought ton stuff! <EOR> YUM   Excellent breakfast choices especially if sweet tooth   server Maria just delightful   Such pleasant place relax enjoy your morning meal   Nice coffee too   Casual fun  <EOR> Everyone seems think know all when comes favorite burger town myself included problem doubles when place also happens where work  People certain pride workplace if love defend death  friend worked Max Brenner Forum Shops always swore best burgers she's ever eaten which would normally accept if place wasn't known mostly chocolate  dessert place actually decent enough burger recommend me?  I've said before say again hate going Caesar's  becomes even worse when risking burger meal place no confidence in  Brenner located deep mall across old FAO Schwartz location which now completely loud obnoxious multi story H M store  know well because chose sit outdoor 'patio' directly across insanity people watch take scenery  didn't think when made request ridiculous music coming H M definitely something think if come dine here  Your other option sit inside restaurant which fairly small nice but amazing smell chocolate  menu very heavy dessert influenced dishes shakes sweet breakfasts but also variety regular items including pizza pastas salads sandwiches  Quite extensive actually really want come back try some dessert items didn't any room burger   The Brenner Burger comes Max's secret barbecue sauce lettuce tomato cheddar Vidalia onion ring top waffle fries dusted chili cocoa powder  great buttery bun bit strong first but quickly lost flavors  meat good flavor cooked almost rare but still good although overall temperature very low  low fact cheddar barely melted  Isn't easier cheeses melt? onion rings bit undercooked hard bite through ended pulling them fried ring sadly  recently told someone perfectly cooked ring easy bite through leaving rest intact wasn't case  barbecue sauce sweet good but almost enough felt myself longing bit flavor occasionally    The waffle fries good but only give five them tiny glass  cocoa chili powder great concept seasoning but hardly noticeable  aioli side good very sweet found myself using burger fries  two pickle wedges ok but couldn't finish both eating large burger   Overall could really good burger but cold temperature really took away it  $14 25 price tag bit steep but guess need take into consideration where sitting  Once par some other Forum locations but possibly good  service spotty too waitress extremely friendly but bused table behind 5 minutes taking drink order disappeared least another 5+ minutes taking plate before bringing check  point pretty quiet too  friend right recommend burger me really quite good but think some competition within building  <EOR> Went cousins 21st birthday difficult find but once saw bald head Max Brenner knew right place  didn't expect them much selection notorious chocolate place when read menu   They actually two more formal simple list salads pastas burgers sandwiches sides appetizers  Pretty normal restaurant  caught eye Kobe Beef Burger decided since costs extra $2   When burger impressed display  your average plate served wooden style pallet 8+ inch steel rod middle burger  quite huge definitely did feel bad spending $16 burger  sides waffle style french fries came unique sauce side which put burger fries    I also impressed style bowls cups when seatmates ordered pasta something never seen restaurant before  reminded seat Smith sat interview Men Black  wanted one  fact when own place goal mine obnoxious bowls wouldn't good cereals soup but great pastas stir fry!  When bit into burger happy camper  thing huge decided use fork knife just don't ruin it  felt your average burger might well eat wasn't normal burger   The atmosphere alright large group 11 people pretty decent  Kind hard booth side case someone needed hit restroom which located upstairs   Also music played very loud kind club but wasn't club music   lounge jazz    point played where felt jungle something! server nice she handle lot big group  am sure would gotten better experience if maybe 4 5 most  Then again know your expecting big group  Whats your order? Next   Sadly didn't chance dessert buddies wanted back hotel party  don't know if chocolate alcohol would mix well mean   really depends your drinking  KNOW    Dessert why but again Kobe burger hunger definitely satisfied  also trying watch diet    burger more enough  Originally going turkey burger sandwich but said hell already and    never Kobe beef burger    Might well big home!

Beyond bartender barely made any conversation flustered running around felt ignored   took 20 ish minutes milkshake hot chocolate then another 10 smores dessert     I just wasn't impressed all place but gave three stars anyway because chocolate restaurant itself GREAT concept!  Just needs little better execution! <EOR> I 1st introduced Max Brenner NYC jammed packed ended only getting chocolates which amazing  natural try restaurant itself when visited Vegas   seated immediately courteous hostess   took waiter 10 min come table then he asked if helped when said no he said he take care us   asked Alcohol recommendations he highly recommended Brazilian Breeze   ordered along w Mojito Mediterranean Trio start  Few min later he came back decided order bunch appetizers dessert  15 min no drinks food sign waiter asked another waiter locate him  Over 5 min pass when he finally showed drinks   Brazilian worst far but didn't complain   food finally came he kept disappearing again  hour 40 min experience zero time waiting table 3 appetizers 2 drinks dessert decided downstairs pay bill since 10 minutes he still never came back mind restaurant almost empty considering almost 11 PM   gift shop where spent almost $80 asked employee if pay bill she kindly declined said she would locate waiter later rushed over assume manager because thought took off   All cared bill neither listening complaining keep waiting everything including check   am really disappointed because food delicious desserts yummy but why should back? lousy service assumption took off without paying? **I website emailed them almost 2 weeks ago never responded  <EOR> Everyone MUST check Max Brenner when you're Vegas!!! I'd imagine food heaven tastes They're just deliciousness food but also presentation! Everything fairly decently priced absolutely delicious! great place dessert brunch  definitely recommend trying waffles any flavor wonderful choice milkshakes!   Great service + great food= 5 freakin stars! <EOR> My meal spot always Grand Luxe   What's love place serves greasy affordable goodness pretty decent setting all hours day     But comes time when new horizons must pushed maybe revisit old places which stumbled into incoherent fashion point another     And Max Brenner targeted next mid day meal for obvious reasons which offered somewhat delightful meal although some  If its any consolation prize savory foods may little edge but sweets definitely high point namely chocolate  Brenner Burger delicious   but when burger not?  plus coming waffle fries which sealed deal  Waffle Fries Cocoa Powder Chili sauce although just came extra sauce really good  Molly Stones Croquetes absolutely delicious little crunchy things tons cheese them  Banana Split Waffle pretty world   chocolate sauce drizzled over perfectly along ice cream caramel layer mini crunchy chocolate balls   sweets person but me  <EOR> The Italian Sipping Chocolate awesome!  really ambiance!! <EOR> Did tell biggest chocolate addict??!

Drink food specials which unbeatable definitely won't bust your wallet  twice probably back more just finish trying all items food part menu  Here's run down tried   Buffalo chicken tenders comes 2 large pieces those infamous brenner waffle fries dusted cocoa powder  definitely your money's worth because good amount food single person  Spiciness just right prefer most buffalo style food mild side  Perfect amount sauce because sometimes when order tenders buffalo style its dripping sauce thankfully  case here  Breading good thick  Highly recommend!  The Mini Philly perfect combination cheese beef  practically match made heaven  think 5 cheese blend does trick   Buffalo chicken slider pretty good but big fan feta cheese  Although would recommend mini philly rather this   Onion rings pretty standard onion rings  Comes chocolate ranch sauce but honestly tasted really close plain ranch hint brown color    chocolate pizza loved every bite just expected  Half pizza big portion 1 person should really plan sharing this  combination chocolate marshmallow crust does trick Brenner pure genius chocolate genius hahaha   Another item where your money's worth! <EOR> Halleluja!

Only reason short star because prices only 3 bill came $60 00 breakfast 2 shakes  Which worth but wouldn't come daily only because H M right across them  <EOR> You should probably try place if walking might but tastes vary quite cup tea everyone should reflect own tastes capture average review can't give place top rating  tried shakes technically some kind grenada something shake hot chocolate between meals  'shake' definitely different style character raw chocolate powder based icee rich dark chocolate lot character however just quite thing creamy melt your mouth irresistable just very cold strong  hot chocolate interesting I would recommend above shake very very frothy head it  Again very rich but think combines better hot beverage cold favorite but different interesting  Probably should tried both because strong raw chocolate lot more power usual stuff ended headache later but did want miss experience  Overall italian ice another very well reviewed vegas desert stop more liking but each own  $5 7 try chocolate item though place cost lot less most things vegas though worth try see if your thing  <EOR> Omg!!! far best chocolate place!! hazelnut chocolate milk shake die for! must try!!! Love food too!!! <EOR> Once found Max Brenner Vegas NYC many years ago knew come during visit   For brunch ordered Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Burrito Slammin Spicy Chicken Burger Chocolate Chunks Pizza all shared course although probably could've ate all if chose to   burrito chicken burger both good although thought burrito could've used more seasoning  Might just because more egg anything else  dessert best part! Although doesn't look anything special tastes great especially hazelnut bits peanut butter   The service okay  pretty slow considering place wasn't even crowded   There still many dishes I'd try  Unfortunately live far frequent restaurant  should Max Brenner closer LA  <EOR> We stayed Nobu Caesar's Palace mood hot chocolate   quick Yelp search thanks all positive reviews gave place try  glad did!

So    if looking chocolate fix great place visit   If want nice affordable meal give shot    We give 5 stars    great experience both times  <EOR> Thought desserts just OK but price paid   looking forward Celine Dion concert desserts actually quite disappointing   We ordered chocolate pizza s'mores   chocolate pizza just didn't taste very good s'mores tiny   There definitely other places LV we'd dessert before try Max Brenner's again  <EOR> The pizza works heaven French toast deliciousssss hands down best food      <EOR> I frequent restaurant once month so  love variety food dessert have!

Just know you're paying quality food you're paying name Max Brenner ! <EOR> I really surprised actually say restaurant really good! expected something more casual restaurant specializes chocolates BUT proved wrong   The restaurant decor really cute modern  would definitely say would cute date place where wallet doesn't empty much  Average price $13   The food amazing delicious  burger club sandwich quesadilla waffle fries  All very yummy  meat burger cooked perfectly    The desserts? can't even start  During meal let try all malt shakes  good  dessert?

When ordered Brenner Burger kobe which just alright   nothing memorable   drink ordered salted carmel hot chocolate I believe which very good   dessert friends Classic European Chocolate Fondue pure milk white chocolate sauces   dessert included bananas strawberries marshmallows banana bread dip into chocolate sauces   dessert gone within minutes   chocolate rich perfect balance being sweet either   most surprising part banana bread came tasted delicious chocolate sauces   dessert also served mini burner roast marshmallows on   service friendly definitely swing desserts! <EOR> This review thick Italian sipping chocolate   never eaten however many times winter months sipping chocolate please mistake hot chocolate boyfriend being Spain he told kind drink quite same but close he found US   If you're wondering Spain chocolate bar melted crispy sweet bread if put would stand end   ever slightly more liquid but OMG good!  Pretty much milk chocolate if choice bar melted down milk added put cup warm   You don't need much all   way used work little kioskey thing front just order go   must wanted value property now gone tables dinner   now into bar order wouldn't bad thing but bartenders truly unpleasant   mean if hate your job much pouring cup chocolate into cup getting tip your unpleasantries inconvenience such problem then please find new job!  hate new layout consider ever coming back but sadly chocolate lot small portions come back   Again review food sipping chocolate sipping chocolate service   If sipping chocolate hot chocolate thicker more amazing version if hot chocolate just place over priced great!  If recommendation pay per oz kinda thing   need full 6oz cup please learn mistakes past 3oz great sometimes 1oz fine but just quite enough   If wasn't crapy crabby service would 5 stars chocolate  way first time into bar crabby service really need retrain rehire bar staff    <EOR> Max Brenner across H M     I tried Candes Killer Breakfast Skillet   eggs sausage onions bell peppers tomatoes spinach home fries mushrooms   all well together   portion kinda big   good size two people  <EOR> Fun place eat sure! oh yummy!

I am embarrassed say looked forward burping rest day because could still taste chocolatey goodness honestly rest day   How known place before?  Forget it   Let's forget past start dreaming next time we'll meet Max Brenner  <EOR> To Max Brenner classic American restaurant chocolate main theme throughout menu  Upon arriving restaurant which located inside Ceasars Palace noticed bold decoration interior nice setup outfront which called patio  While menu extensive fairly confusing layout  browsing ordered individual portion Molly's white corn croquette  came six pieces perfect size lil ol' me  isn't exactly healthy item nor overwhelmingly delicious but enjoyed them just fine    I also asked Mocha madness Surprise Tiramisu  Both items came little glass cups tiny flasks filled chocolatey liquid  tiny flasks reminded flasks used use chemicals while working radiochemistry lab brought back unpleasant memory  Despite fact bet some people find items cute whimsical  thought Mocha Madness perfect amount kahlua sweetness especially if you're Asian can't hold ounce alcohol save life  Tiramisu white cream sauce outrageously sweet couldn't eat more half teaspoon just gave it  Instead poured chocolate flask onto strawberry cup really enjoyed chocolatey fruit  wouldn't recommend Tiramisu item if don't overly sweet desserts   Overall little bit disappointed chocolate items Max Brenner  Chocolate desserts don't overly sweet good  good dessert must balance everything overpowered single component which case sugar  <EOR> Items selected White Corn Croquettes Paprika dusted white corn manchego cheese panko Cinnamon Apple White Chocolate French Toast Brown Sugar Spiced Pecans Warm Toffee Sauce Crispy Bacon Salted Caramel Milkshake Vanilla Ice Cream Chocolate Ganache Caramel Sea Salt Milk Whipped Cream OMG Chocolate Chunk Cookie Chocolate Chip Cookie Walnuts served whipped cream fresh berries pure melted chocolate  Having experienced The Bald Man's chocolates New York many years back quite familiar Forum Shops Caesars really cannot explain why substantial sweet tooth never indulged Max Brenner's eponymous Las Vegas restaurant but chance mention friend space's pending closure relocation quickly set mend oversight   Two stories size featuring many things chocolate plus collection overpriced comfort foods just 10 00am when sat down cozy two top near base stairs treated pleasant everything good service typical such places five part order hatched restaurant bustled leaving ponder reasons any pending change   service swift only matter minutes before selections began arrive first superlative $8 milkshake thick caramel rife vanilla but topped copious whipped cream mask I'd guess 8oz serving trend carried over each plate followed large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered bold flavors   Starting sweet following savory due kitchen miscalculation should noted each Brenner's pure chocolates well sourced smooth complex bar such both white milk versions only served improve Custard French toast Soft Cookie later par New York's fabled Levain Bakery terms taste texture though 2 5x price while think everyone would happier see Croquettes first I'd lying if didn't say favorite bite meal paprika manchego working smoky savory magic lightly fried kernels  <EOR> Chocolate chocolate more chocolate!  I must say heaven when here! highlight dessert only experience Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate Hug Mug  ingredients mixed perfection cup fits snug your hand! also chocolate fondue share didn't expect much regular chocolate fondue just some goodies dip them but some chocolate wafers strawberries bananas marshmallows more milk chocolate much more!  You must take chocolate lovers you! Don't let chocolate haters rain your parade!  They ice cream bar wanted definitely back just that! <EOR> Definitely delicious but say all drinks people HUGE sweet tooth   couldn't even finish white hot chocolate   Definitely tasted straight melted chocolate but good!!!  Ordered bunch food full off cancel dessert   Definitely missed cause seems place meant sweets all way   Got turkey sandwich good but anything ordinary Salmon interesting take salmon loved wasabi mayo  probably come back try desserts = <EOR> I dislike New Yorks often pretentious show offy restaurant food options expecting much Max Brenner coming Serendipity outside  Well all hate flew right off when smelled warm milky chocolate breeze air walking here  Seriously stood just breathed minute two  Then looked chocolate being made wanted dunk finger bad screw more jump isch! Sat read menu drooled debated going night just ordering everything menu  No really everything  The desserts unheard real food also everything more  Prices fair especially considering Caesars  I overwhealmed promised man would drinking just some pralines $1 50 each He owes big time pralines just tease good but tiny almost reason enough drive back Vegas for! <EOR> How many stars give restaurant drive Vegas visit?  That may exaggeration but if much one   Nestled food courts Forums Caesars you'll find chocolate lover's haven   Hate chocolate?  Then starve!  Just kidding tons great options never touch ouch cocoa   But disgust me   Max Brenners scattered throughout world closest Southern California residents of which am one    restaurant itself straight Willy Wonka except without insanity   hot chocolate piped throughout building not real obviously but very interesting look at two levels seating guarantee place never become completely overrun customers     The menu superb   ordered Oven Roasted Tomato Pizza Southwestern Caesar Salad which comes funnel like bowl plate   Both excellent better would ordinarily expect chocolate centered property     But if leave without ordering waffle fries might well stayed home   come addictive mustard cocoa powder dipping sauce tastes God punched tastebuds said Good   always order extra side even though somewhat pricey because someone home going want handful     They also dozen coffee hot chocolate dessert options   Honestly although good hot chocolate classic milkshake they're reason keep going back   expect them specialities well   But could skip actual chocolate still memorable experience   The service generally solid take out orders too   fiancee pair Hug Mugs custom made hot chocolate cups laughably impractical but still fascinating   Punch line least once   think you'll find whatever your tastebuds crave  <EOR> We came lunch dessert  ordered following Brenner sliders cobb sliders sharing tasting 2  The sliders okay while waffle fries more memorable  sharing tasting 2 good! loved banana split waffle fondue! think next time come skip food straight dessert  <EOR> I've already reviewed Max Brenner NYC loved it! now review Vegas      hotel Caesars didn't well NYC ambiance venue but didn't affect amazing chocolate which why first place!!
