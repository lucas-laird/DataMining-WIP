Thanks Loco Cantina awesome lunch every time  <EOR> The food delicious    however bar service another story  greeted would presume manager far good  head bar place order  bartender walks over gives menu  sitting clearly ready order but no bartender site  manager walk back over take order her  10 minute wait which bad wait time manager walks food out  Again bartender doesn't find important enough job  manager handed food said sir haven't paid yet  he hands card bartender  She continues drink other person place  Mind two other people entire restaurant  thought okay finish making drink fine  she walks drink over then continues take order  When she finally comes back over finally cash she puts card bar doesn't hand card back gives receipt says thank smugly  normally give tip bar service but today  IF DONT YOUR JOB NEW ONE! manager really should reconsider he working him  may may come back here   but if come back she working definitely turn around somewhere else  <EOR> First time reviewing any restaurant but far worst food ever service also horrible  <EOR> I really wanted place   work area am always looking new lunch place   right 11 am no else there   seated pretty quickly but service horrible   took 10 minutes take order   finally food server didn't come back another 25 minutes   ONLY ones there   When she did come back see done she didn't clear plates waited another 12 minutes someone that   place grab quick bite   food okay   guacamole good   tried barbacoa chicken carne asada chicken tacos   carne asada dry   probably wait 6 months then try again   Hopefully service better then  <EOR> The menu fairly limited food simple but good  guacamole which $7 both good large portion  chips crisp light oily  also chicken tostada which good but flavor didn't really jump gobsmack me    We didn't order any drinks but hey look some good drinks extensive tequila mezcal menu  place open airy would great place outside when weather nice especially since 2nd floor great view Town Square balcony  <EOR> MIKE BEST BARTENDER!! place best  food great other management totally turned place around  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! <EOR> A group five wandered Sunday evening place empty  worried but also new food experience Town Square   The waitress only person interacted while again because empty  She wonderful although she did know brand house wine another minor inquiry  She still helpful attentive pleasant  When first sat down she said Should some chips salsa while look over menu? Mexican restaurant might assume free but take note chips salsa not  While bottomless once order them still $3  those eye rolling moments but again she pleasant helpful  Side note Since mainly only ones some Sunday NFL games that weren't watching volume very loud speaker right near us  She kindly turned down more enjoyable level   The place mostly clean things seemed brand new  definitely good drink selection seems if Happy Hour would some good deals although just missed time frame  wine pour solid mad that?? See photo! Fountain drinks also approx  $3   Price range bearable getting  servings weren't daunting but most hefty certainly filling  mix foods table Salad Burger quesadilla Mexican fries highly recommend street tacos 3 platter choice tamales  Pretty good representation would imagine  Also checking into Yelp at time visit earned dessert churros definitely try!!!!!!  Additional food notes 1 tempura avocado street taco tempura avocado piece  little disappointing but small little street taco  Still really? D 2 am whimp when comes spice but salsa chips salsa quite kick even average spicy enthusiast  3 chips those flaky buttery chips want eat all sitting    All food tasty warm came timely manner  hope place gets sufficient chance Town Square restaurants near movie courtyard seem struggle  <EOR> Terrible service food drinks BEWARE!! open 4 months no clue run successful restaurant  Saturday night around 11pm no else joint terrible! waitress nice but service SLOW  ordered Pomegranate margarita served tall glass rocks no salt? Kinda odd Mexican restaurant  Well drink super sour nasty  sent back ordered Cadillac margarita Patron Blanco still good   I asked waitress if serve blended margaritas she said no only rocks  kind Mexican restaurant does serve blended margaritas???

Tacos $3 but pay extra dollar all that! Plus chips salsa lol score!haha <EOR> I love place   Town Square across park   Look red sign saying Loco Cantina   Hidden upstairs overlooking park balcony which nice sunny day   twice both times experienced great service good food   menu prices cheap   street tacos really tasty   give big basket chips 2 kinds dip   mild spicy both good   manager bartender server much fun   laughing entire time   If come alone sit bar feel very comfortable   treated regular   huge screen view sports plenty room tables close together   daily specials large selection draft beers Dos Equis Amber Lager draft   definitely come back  <EOR> This place great food awesome tacos great Happy Hour plus every Tuesday $2 taco Tuesday all day   We've several times now disappointed service food drinks   cannot tacos without tequila     They stay open late which great place such great food drink   The staff all warm friendly mention Jasmine remembered acknowledge this   highly recommend place no matter if come during Happy Hour Taco Tuesday just anytime   They several tv's around place decor very cool  Most people never look when place if really don't notice unique decor places have   sure take some time check ceiling just enjoy all interesting decor   back over over      So closing Happy Hour every day 3 7pm Jasmine totally awesome she far favorite server here   suggestion Mexican Tator Tots  PLEASE    these blow chorizo fries off menu  <EOR> My girlfriend kept talking 'Loco cantina' couple days now decided give try    Located town square witch perfect  greeted server Danielle I believe  name she told special going Saturday night all drink  ended ordering coronita 3 chicken tacos perfect house sauce delicious  girlfriend ended having chicken taquitos torta de carnitas roasted tomatillo salsa lime crema die for!

If fine    if would know just brought without asking preference  sweet tasted Italian didn't really complent salad very well    After enough  sat another 10 mintues hoping server would come back    she did not  back inside pay bill  asked if could pay    minute she says trey full drinks hands    handed card   She apologized repeatedly  She set down drinks BoH found manager came comp several items bill but then quickly back rock he hiding under  She again apologized emphatically suggested she huge party again place dead  enough staff    In end poor service product manager couldn't give less fuck setting nonexistent example staff neophyte girls little none experience quality service  If your comping food off bill but don't give fuck why your guest experience enough come table offer any knid incentive come back    don't belong SERVICE industry  Your restaurant dead your service sucks your only solution comping food    GOOD LUCK  <EOR> Just don't   Average best    Tried each taco kind gross   Some tasted similar dog food don't wonder why know taste curious kid Best thing guacamole chips but even isn't very incredible   <EOR> Being California originally desperate good Mexican food Vegas over $15 plate   menu fairly simple street tacos tortas fajitas tostadas handful starters   tacos street tacos smaller tortilla but over filled meat  chicken tacos which quite good barbacoa beef short rib   barbacoa fairly spicy decent flavor but also rather greasy may because made  short rib  chicken taquitos best thing menu other night  Nicely crisp greasy great flavor  Happy hour specials only include drinks since tacos only $3 50 each much room discount  Chips salsa complementary but still overly expensive we passed trip    Sodas fairly priced he menu unlike other restaurants Town Square $4+  few minor bugs service being new place nothing horrible back when want good Mexican street tacos taquitos spend fortune  <EOR> Great service Luis Mike!
