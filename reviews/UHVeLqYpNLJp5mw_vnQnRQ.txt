I liked preserved egg congee fried dough sticks  husband wonton noodles which came udon style noodles instead canto style egg noodles  <EOR> Came second time trip Vegas   Taiwanese Chinese perspective place pretty authentic   pork chop rice dish veggie stir fried noodle great   beef noodle okay pork ramen decent    Combining two visits well deserved 4 stars   If wife pretty picky food likes can't bad other reviews  <EOR> Came dinner tonight parents daughter scanned top bottom when came through door  Seems all utensils cups made cheap plastic styrofoam  provide paper menus mark your order  We ordered spicy noodles duck leg noodles tonkotsu ramen  gave pork feet noodles instead duck leg noodles!! Spicy noodles INSANELY oily if everything oil instead soup  Tonkotsu ramen also terrible 90% pork fat meat dry hard chew noodles worse cup noodles even hard boiled egg pink splotches it  paid didn't change back but 2 dollars let them keep it    Worst restaurant ever to! <EOR> I can't imagine why dishes taste bad   and service   where service? never again  sure  <EOR> This place okay food but really expensive probably worth price  came looking some stinky tofu advertised menus front  However when menu didn't any stinky tofu  also little confusing because two doors outside two signs called two different restaurants  However doors days use other door plus inside restaurants connected  just little confusing because different menus both doors but they're really same menu restaurant   Anyway back food  seaweed appetizer only disappointing dish  included some weird part plant  really chewy stiff  stem something  don't know  just wasn't very good    The rest dishes though pretty authentic good  wontons chili oil cooked really well right amount spice! Taiwanese sausage also pretty good  could cooked little longer garlic came pretty flavorless  meat ball soup also really yummy meat balls big delicious!  Overall restaurant felt pretty authentically Taiwanese menu also pretty authentic  prices pretty steep but guess par other places Chinatown  decent place stop some Taiwanese comfort food! <EOR> Came lunch afternoon workout   craving traditional Taiwanese comfort food knew place offers that   Yelp listed opening time 10 am but incorrect open 8 00 am    I side order cold tofu plate Minced pork rice   tap both items came $15   bad all    They also ready made items like Panda Express variety where build your own lunch combo but unlike Panda Express food authentic made Chinese palette  <EOR> Beef brisket noodle soup very good   Good service inexpensive   Desserts pretty good well  Noodles taste hand tossed  Its small restaurant no ambiance  good lunch restaurant  <EOR> Family ran business  Lots options but deli options tastiest  Don't recommend porridge ramen but green onion pancakes yummy  <EOR> Really bad restaurant!! Just tried lunch around 1 40 pm 2 tables customers busy ordered 2 dishes  dine No food served 25 minutes found later owner forgot place order   sat idiots attend ! hungry really piss off!! <EOR> I happened Chinatown today decided randomly walk place  Nothing fancy nothing spectacular   Honestly Chinatown shouldn't expect any type customer service  least girl cashier smiling     I appreciate fact put pictures food menu  When see name its description appealing me  looking menu decided order Three Cups Chicken Rice or something similar that which came marinated chicken rice some veggies  Chicken salty taste dry  also noticed lot tiny bones there    My friend ordered Pork Belly Rice pretty good  Pork belly rice also came rice veggies  Pork belly good flavor very juicy tender  should ordered considering dry chicken was    I noticed varieties ramen  Can't remember exactly but lot options  Sora ramen go to place ramen but might interesting try here  Restaurant empty definitely don't wait Sora!  Looking other yelp reviews pudding dessert which did see menu  would back place try pudding dessert  <EOR> Felt really needed write this  Ordered Food came fast  Realized prepared food priced cook order prices Way expensive  real pissed waiter but didn't tell why  Brought spicy dumpling finger sauce  Didn't say anything bc didn't want other food spit on  thought food poor but didn't want assume since always critical  Asked wife mom both finally spoke felt same  Very bland tasteless food  beef noodle soup taste water down  all other food ordered  Spicy dumpling already cold tks extra spice he added finger  Why restaurant packed? line door? <EOR> this grandma approved authentic Chinese food restaurant  Don't expect lots service but food itself very good  also very fast  grandma having trouble finding authentic Chinese restaurant while traveling States  first time she's disappointed but instead approving authentic Chinese restaurant which golden  would definitely take again  <EOR> One thing cannot stand ordering something menu being told available served anymore   Then don't keep menu!  then when offered substitute beef instead pork chicken meat nothing but fat!  food spicy but menu does reflect that  place crowded maybe mostly tourists eat anything Chinatown guess   Finally servers speak passable English but when asked ice water gave hot tea glass   think punked   Anyway pass place up   much better Taiwanese restaurants nearby  <EOR> I brisket noodle soup really good!
