I never leave reviews but food terrible threw all $40 worth garbage  32 years its far worst food ever tried  <EOR> Just plain nasty     Foods cold always     Restaurant Dirty Business Employees really now your rude f***! Change indeed needed! <EOR> I've dinner two times both times staff angry food mediocre best     Not sure why would ever come back here   Would rather Panda across street some 2000 calorie items here     Why good chinese hard find Vegas?!? <EOR> After seeing earlier reviews ordered China Joy evening   hoping find something similar Golden Phoenix NLV really liked them but moved south side last fall  thinking ordered wrong time day night everyone else reviewed them insane    The potstickers drier backyard August helped bland dipping sauce  The orange chicken flavorless even remotely spicy found neck bone all things! The sesame chicken tasted weird per preteen son    sure means but favorable  The sweet sour chicken passable though sauce quite thin   Didn't really matter three yr old fine  The curry chicken interesting bad   Since looking good curry place well think probably order again sure   Overall great dinner  As husband says guess we'll ordering place takes forever deliver because least know food's okay  *sigh* <EOR> Very average chinese food  tastes same any other cookie cutter chinese food place Plenty food money but plenty boring food still just boring foo  <EOR> I've looking decent Chinese food near am glad found place  good food certainly better Panda X  chicken snow peas  Would liked little more bold flavor but overall good  small portion more enough also  going sure future since its much place sit eat   I'm editing review couple years ago  the food still OK although today's KungPao shrimp REALLY spicy little much  read somewhere order takers  as being less friendly still applies  middle aged Asian lady today just step away being surly younger lady sometimes isn't much better   <EOR> No flavor extra oily honest think need close better Chinese here  Not recommended if want good meal         good starving gotta eat Something now place  <EOR> Just thinking back food want vomit! various meat indistinguishable  is chicken? pork? cares surprise! surprise your stomach promptly try cleanse itself garbage making vomit 24 hours  food Panda Express seem Michelin 5 star restaurant  <EOR> Eating years consistently good food never any problems quality meat decent prices want good tasting chinese american food there  <EOR> GROSS   The absolute only thing liked place very polite delivery guy   The chicken curry bowl small bowl rice topped gross mixture soggy vegetables chicken tastes texture something someone chewed SPIT back blob yellow goo tasted chicken broth    The chicken noodle soup surprisingly okay   AVOID  ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING  <EOR> I no problems then n many years   Always nice fast delivery    good food <EOR> Great food price nothing beats Golden Flower off Russel Pecos but place right top  Lemon Chicken good if BBQ pork fried rice  Friendly staff see them cooking food counter which cool  place worth going again  <EOR> Having born San Francisco being resident Los Angeles chinese food addict start life  having said I'd award China Joy very precious WORST OF Chinese Food award    We party 6 ordered orange chicken kung pao beef egg foo young  3 ended vomiting contents stomachs within 15 minutes while driving down 159   What wrong?  The kung pao breaded coating felt green slime nickelodeon channel used dump people pot stickers filled chicken jerky egg foo young stretchy  Needless say tried few bites then tossed rest while attempting eat sides rice soup  Even hot sour soup looked something I'd blow nose during run influenza    Bottom Line Bland over starched completely stale nightmares served daily basis  only time I'd visit China Joy again if ate something poisonous needed stomach  <EOR> Unfortunately don't smartphone yet   If did would skipped place hope dear reader too!  heading home wanted McDonalds when saw place   figured why not? in   menu board front register same carryout menu the carryout menu lists more options    I ordered cream cheese wontons sesame chicken chicken chow mein adding $22 00 which think ridiculous considering quality food!  course can't really screw cream cheese wontons let's leave them this     The sesame chicken almost tastes corndogs mean weirdest way possible   something 90% breading 10% chicken   Speaking chicken which happen remember ordering because never order beef pork sure where entrees   meat like substance weirdly chewy discolored not undercooked straight weird   Hey guess if you're really hurting home night some Chinese food could just throw together spaghetti soy sauce call chow mein  Why not?  did!  If you're reading disbelief *actually* used spaghetti please believe when tell 100% spaghetti    even whole grain!!!   Obviously won't returning! <EOR> I love place! going 4 years! Cashew Chicken amazing! quick prices good!!!! <EOR> Better then Panda express    thats all say  <EOR> My family stayed Vegas night wanted some Chinese condo manager recommended China Joy   should taken look place run away but alas blinded hunger    Upon opening take out box containing egg foo yung mom remarked well     looks      authentic? grandma thought foo yung looked huge fuzzy tarantula  far off   taste okay if could past huge parts blackened other parts basically pure solidified grease    The pad Thai best thing tried didn't taste real pad Thai all   Very tomato ey kind spicy but decent enough   fried rice sweet lo mein pretty forgettable     Basically if need your monthly serving grease oil should consider China Joy   Otherwise save yourself cardiac arrest somewhere less    Joy like   <EOR> I should read reviews before but wanted something cheaper Yummy Grill Sushi   but guess should just Vietnamese course lot Chinese food time WORST Chinese places ever mean Chinese food wrong? Even dirtiest dirtiest places NYC 100x better place Lo Mein noodles disgusting   the only thing liked could order online but even when question order because guess website flawed   oh well! <EOR> Great food  Decent service  Prices comparable others  never eaten but dining room clean well kept  house rice house chow mein amazing  last order house fried rice house chicken chow mein sweet sour chicken order fried wontons  Total price $30   Food always fresh hot  favorite Chinese restaurants town  <EOR> All say YUCK   Worst Chinese food Las Vegas   Stupid rating system wouldn't let give NO STARS   When moved Silverado Ranch looking neighborhood place easy weekday take those days when no mood cook     definitely place   Even though am Asian am going purport any sort Chinese food snob  but place fell far short even Americanized take chains Panda Express which would eat any day week rather eat take again     Everything ordered ranged fantastically unremarkable barely edible   Even fried rice greasy bland     mean mess fried rice?!  Definitely RECOMMENDED list  <EOR> Pretty good chinese food   Quick delivery nice folks but language barrier issue phone   HUGE potstickers really meaty   Lo Mein quite good   rest menu good but if you're looking spicy place ain't it  Except hot sour soup    actually very good decently spicy  folks business being closest home because they're best best   But when jonesing chinese food guys job done WAY better standard chain around parts  <EOR> I've eaten few Chinese restaurants around Vegas area far probably worst ones ever to  usually read yelp reviews but didn't location  Big mistake  around lunch time should taken hint single person entered establishment entire 35 minutes there  ordered lunch special orange chicken chow mein fried rice  orange chicken very oily fatty didn't really taste regular orange chicken am used having places panda express other chinese restaurants  orange chicken honest simply gross  yourself favor skip location  <EOR> I say bit surprised low rating saw  fiance stopped place late night   always saw would walk Albertson's house wanted eat some Chinese food   Small place  huge menu posted front establishment nice   first time walking place took puppy she could some exercise menu front good perk   portions size very generous  fiance tofu eggplant garlic sauce   Delicious! bit spicy but overwhelming   sweet sour shrimp   Again portion great   loved put sweet sour sauce side  tend eat small portions but all time which if sauce already mixed shrimp would super soggy   allows put much sauce want keep food longer without worry soggy factor   Another plus Honey Walnut Shrimp   Yes many Chinese food establishments but seeing hate driving Las Vegas dish tends pricey glad find place close sells decent price less $15    Planning coming back! <EOR> Walking Albertsons 6PM scouring isles those few odds ends needed awesome meal am planning making and   well   We noticed glowing lights China Joy both did want sit establishment tonight grabbed menu noticed deliver  rolled into driveway decided take advantage delivery option  am all sesame chicken wife wanted hooked honey walnut shrimp  give large white rice every entree which ton rice  sesame chicken honey walnut shrimp moved into top 2 delivery take Chinese food   would given fifth star but tried anything else there    Yet  <EOR> Way better local chains  Fresh prepared efficient though brusk  Best takeout   Very good prices  only mark 4star because no way fancy  Delivery only until 4pm  <EOR> Worst Chinese delivery ever had   know should probably write lengthier review but when order beef dish chicken dish can't distinguish between two know isn't good place!  It bad throw away most food ordered  <EOR> Really good food nice folks quickly delivery! favorite restaurant <EOR>
