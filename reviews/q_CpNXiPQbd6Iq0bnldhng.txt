WHAT off work straight home some hungry brothers mine! debated type food eat came conclude all craving some good old Hawaiian food! would usually drive 5 minutes Island Flavor but 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes new place! Boohooo!!! = I then decided search Yelp lucky enough spot SPOT  Muahaha!!  First thing's first  step order  brother both chicken combo while other brother gets local plate  Most plates 8 bucks well worth 8 bucks!! While waiting food server brings bowl MISO SOUP!!! C'mon ever side miso hawaiian joint!! say BOMB COM!!! right = SOLD! Haha   After minute actual combo plates  Fast service may add! loved chicken katsu but bbq chicken bland side   could suggest adding little bit more seasoning even bbq sauce would done trick! Besides bbq chicken everything splendid! definitely come back those chicken katsu crave days! <EOR> I wanted checkout another Hawaii hole wall found decent Aloha Go    admit located way right field Las Vegas take some time but if your craving some Hawaii style plates area might bad thing check them pretty well hidden Albertson shopping center foothill Sunrise mountain menu similar Yummy Sushi   The place fairly small but pretty good take customer traffic getting table wasn't problem but figure eat difficult because many choices      ended combo teri beef Garlic Chicken   They took ten minute set plate teri beef okay    nothing write home but Chicken kind stolen recipe L L the ones Hawaii garlic chicken   it good!   but Mac salad sucked a#s need work big time   Would special trip visit them again?  NO but if near area staving might chicken but without salad  <EOR> Their store sign says Hawaiian BBQ Aloha GoGo but next door China GoGo figured found right place   Hubby Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate Chicken Combo  shared Unagi Roll sushi   First good news plate consisted chicken katsu BBQ chicken which came side katsu sauce 2 scoops rice side macaroni salad  Both chicken types good no complaints but rice dry al dente side macaroni salad left bit desired  tasted better macaroni salad before even L L serves better macaroni salad   The unagi sushi great! Very smooth delicious avocado inside sushi perfect flavorful! sushi filled crab meat avocado cucumber eel top drizzled eel sauce  Very nice!  Now bad news Hubby fortunate choice which Hawaiian BBQ mix plate consisting BBQ short ribs BBQ beef BBQ chicken  beef short ribs tough chewy spite BBQ beef being very thinly sliced  Short ribs normally tender but he said its flavor mild almost nothing  meat served side sauce though helped somewhat  Same story mine rice macaroni salad plate   We thought best part meal eel sushi we'll definitely back again try other types sushi also malasadas  say sushi reasonably priced  California Roll $3 95 unagi sushi ordered $5 95  Very affordable   They wide assortment food choices menu such burgers saimin musubi haupia coconut pudding dessert offer catering service delivery service within 3 miles  We'll back! <EOR> Aloha used known just serving Hawaiian based food side sushi rolls  But ever since they've combined restaurant China became establishment they've added name Sushi House  if order take might directed side when pick up  delivery well usually time  Never problem that   Their main menu looks completely different only looks serve sushi but still order all same Hawaiian food items before  They've even kept old menu taped window!  They offer All Eat AYCE sushi both lunch dinner  personally haven't done AYCE but ordered countless times  tried almost all sushi menu always turns yummy fresh  Prices seem same range other AYCE restaurants well   It's go to sushi place but great joint when you're craving something quick you're area  Plus far where live wouldn't travel all way restaurant compared other authentic Japanese sushi houses   Staff very personable when comes customer service which may come off being unfriendly some  But doesn't really bother since only food when area visiting friends   It's great place try when you're looking formality eatery when just need feed your tummy good food  lol  *Since Aloha Sushi House establishment but known two different names written same review both check ins* <EOR> I'm pretty sure connected China business  two store down much place very satisfied place  Much China cook fresh food quick  place typical Hawaiian BBQ menu enters such macaroni salad chick katsu bbq chicken mahi mahi fried shrimp but half menu consist Japanese dishes  There's 12 different sushi rolls tempura couple bowl dishes musubi Good stuff all way   As any Hawaiian BBQ restaurant always judge chicken katsu place top spot  last ordered katsu bbq chicken combo prefer version both compared more popular L L    As venue itself all clean less two years old think  Last remember place used Sandwich Masters compared place completely different store  Fairly small only 9 tables think but never seen place busy  Usually people just order pick there  seat yourself more fast food type deal sit down place    They seemed stressing being able deliveries though eat pick up  If you're mood some Hawaiian Japanese food definitely recommend place  <EOR> Food okay tasting  back try malasadas give more complete review  <EOR> I eat all time food really good  serve good portion your money recommend grilled mahi mahi very tasty! <EOR> So happened upon place while house sitting friend mine  close saw online manapua mosey down check them out  place small but really clean  counter lot but overall organized  staff greater came told approximately long food would take cook since back outside attend dog came along ride  overall would say staff really nice   On important stuff     food!!! Hawaiian BBQ beef friend really good but manapua left lot desired  dry lacked great Hawaiian flavor anticipating  If came back would probably stick BBQ plates  Oh other thing kinda annoyed still skewers menu even though no longer offer them   option different more costly item manapua  <EOR> This place ordering if want something fast simple delicious   usually Hawaiian bbq chicken plate husband gets bbq chicken sandwich   Everything good   chicken tender juicy full flavor   must say am huge fan macaroni salad but some reason macaroni salad good   also husband likes fried rice comes meal  <EOR> My review based solely hamburger steak there   people dont understand gravy NEEDS brown white   turn off!  Didn't taste very good all   Sushi good though   Perhaps need actually Hawaii eat plate lunch before opening Hawaiian BBQ!  Auwe! <EOR> Slow service boy pick no personality  He needs watch Barney learn please thank yous! <EOR> I decided stop into restaurant today because 1  just came gym pretty hungry 2  Hawaiian pretty fond Hawaiian food   Checked menu saw weren't many options vegetarians But Hawaiian food aka rice meat central knowingly took risk   Lucky am pescetarian divulged Mahi Burger   Being used Vegas version L L mahi actually expecting something subpar didn't expect sandwich actually pretty dang good!  fish fresh  all really ask mahimahi burger   also let substitute fries kim chee must say kim chee good!  really into saucy kim chees kim chee hit spot   fiancee Local Plate which consisted BBQ beef chicken two scoops rice scoop mac salad two musubis 8 50!  deal!
