I walked into restaurant dinner last night leave soon entered  distinct strong smell sewage  couldn't possibly trust try raw seafood restaurant smelled that  other person smelled well  couldn't fast enough  Very disappointed  <EOR> Good place come different spin sushi poke  Awesome service  Very clean intimate setting  Though moderately busy time due space if busy bit uncomfortable  Employees friendly offered great suggestions which toppings would mesh well protein items  <EOR> I've many sushi burritos but bigger most sure bring your appetite   manager Alyssa ? super friendly personable   I family town visiting never sushi burrito  quite fun experience them! <EOR> Moved oahu back mainland totally craving poke   spot really hit spot inexpensive  <EOR> Yum!! work area  3 times  good!!!  Food always very fresh  Lemonades great   Staff friendly  Co workers several times well always  good things say  Highly recommend <EOR> Tried coming 530pm Saturday completely BOTH salmon albacore! Seriously? <EOR> Wow!  great find!! place awesome   many choices combinations choose from   Service fast friendly food delicious  <EOR> Delicious!! Fresh fish many toppings restaurant very clean  Along poke bowls also serve sushi burritos appetizers grilled fish poke tacos etc  love fresh salmon  would definitely come back if lived Vegas  only thing would criticize could add more fish bowls considering $10 each  Overall amazing place amazing food!! <EOR> The food advertised fresh delicious  TRUE SLIGHTEST  food obviously fresh  Fish probably frozen solid before being sold  Also customer service nightmare  Workers apparently only care doing minimum amount work required  try customer feel less intelligent when flustered struggle act accordingly societal norms being patient kind long point customer's voice unheard ignored  Would give place 0 stars if could  <EOR> The name place caught attention then saw sushi burrito knew wanted try it  similar concept Chipotle restaurant where burrito bowl pick your proteins toppings but instead Mexican food Sushi  sushi rice shrimp octopus Yusuf sauce mango sliced jalapeño mango krabmeat* ginger  strawberry lemonade drink which $4 50 but came mason jar logo served fresh strawberries lemons inside  drink ok but little sweet overpriced  sushi burrito really good would come back order exact same sushi burrito again because enjoyed it      Negatives I told server first time visiting restaurant when ordered green tea rice base he did inform could only base ordering bowl  only told another staff once sat down eat realized rice white instead green color assuming should green since ordered green tea rice base    Positives sushi burrito great overall customer service good room improvement clean establishment I wanted some wasabi side but wasn't available when putting order together once sat down ask another server again if wasabi ready place table  I trying decide between Hawaiian Guava coconut water but neither option available when placed order settle strawberry lemonade  <EOR> Came 3pm Friday something tuna just didn't taste right   Each bite took chewy weird way   Some bites overly fishy taste   sure if texture fish cut but definitely different Poke spots frequent Los Angeles   It's bad but good either  <EOR> Stopped Saturday afternoon customer service     terrible  buddy orders poke bowl orders 3 extra orders fish top 3 he should getting bowl  But worker serving messed charged 7 when should 6  But she starts argue saying she right started recounting orders fish  Which came he supposed charged 6  he asks worker if he just extra scoop fish order she charged him  Then she says she'll figure tried give money back  buddy didn't even want money back  He just wanted extra order fish he charged lives easier  she did next didn't any sense whatsoever    she literally said reserve right refuse service anyone just going throw your bowl away  people enjoy meal restaurant work at  isn't customers  If find different poke shop treat customer save yourself headache so  <EOR> I've before given them five stars  Today waited longest line ever front line man argue couldn't have  Which before don't know why different  really frustrating because am actually really hungry ordering multiple items take home but now never back just Kayzan across street  <EOR> Finally see hype all about  life before sushi burritos?! month having carbs worth every single carb  tuna spicy tuna delicious! never ordered anything before but employees very helpful putting together something ended loving! Great food service super close job  kind place <EOR> I love new poke spot fact near school  great some more quality fast food options around area  poke bowls sushi burritos other entrees grilled fish there's something everyone  ordered poke bowl food super fresh which very important since fish also aesthetically pleasing  sriracha aioli sauce if you're into spicy food me  Just wish brown rice but green tea rice pretty good  also signature lemonades iced tea plus keep mason jar  recommend getting tropical mandarin iced tea  <EOR> Yes another poke bowl spot opened Vegas  But place stands few ways mostly positive ones    + H2O established chain couple locations CA addition offering DIY poke bowls also menu grilled fish plates  Friendly staff clean location plenty parking   + poke tacos! Unlike version Tail Fin isn't just miniaturized poke burrito but involves tempura fried seaweed wrap taco shell  genius really it  Pretty fairly priced $5 ea categorized appetizer  + Fresh healthy options pick rush unlike most options fast food heavy intersection multiple hotdog pizza choices  mahi mahi plate didn't live expectations successful seafood spot compared others visited LA area  much flavor  No vegetarian vegan protein options far  Staff openly encouraged photos check ins etc social media verbally offered free dessert exchange posted review which isn't especially kosher may explain why many  single sentence 5 star reviews new accounts  Despite emphasis photos fact great images used marketing lighting business during evening hours terrible  Dim lighting does nice shots please turn lights! <EOR> Smashed it!  Built own burrito extra helpful staff  house sauce forget it!  back try different combinations! <EOR> I come every Friday #1 Lent #2 work nearby   always awesome experience  only downside sometimes line gets backed up  seems always newbie running cash register holds line  David? The taller Asian fella always quick helpful gets line moving  want say he manager something    They only size bowl taxes comes $10 some change  place different and frequent lot Poke bowl places types different protein choose octopus shrimp  see other places  BUT missing Yellowtail let slide  yes agree avocado should included They always good music playing enjoy spending lunch hour here   I wish would give discount UNLV employees students then would better! <EOR> We ordered poke bowl  green tea rice salmon three protein H20 signature sauce kale salad cucumber avocado extra krabmeat masago   We could taste green tea flavor rice refreshing liked lot  seasoned little maybe sushi rice base?   Since only chose salmon amount salmon didn't seem sufficient enough whole bowl  seemed two scoops instead three but good salmon nonetheless    The kale salad also surprisingly good semi cooked bits carrots subtle dressing  Cucumber seemed pickled but salt could barely taste much sugar if any    Overall satisfied ingredients would back another bowl try burrito  feel poke restaurant stands above others vegas  wish did shrimp tempura option protein though   We also ordered clam chowder  Website says chunks clam potatoes surprised when saw corn it can't eat corn spit them ate  looked if added corn topping ask them leave next time  flavor chowder tasted pretty good but felt needed little more salt    The tropical mandarin Iced tea delicious  wasn't overly sweet surprise really fresh tangerines opposed canned  There's pulp zest segments drink  keep mason boot! <EOR> Terrible experience   Overall impressed   Won't ever back worker front rude wouldn't help asked   Charged incorrect amount rolled eyes when brought attention  <EOR> Very good Poke clean  fast delivered Poke various choices  little expensive casual dining $11 bowl but overall good experience clean place  <EOR> Great poke 3 choices protein just 10 dollars cant that   dont think find any other place <EOR> I must admit disappointed H2O  burritos carelessly inconsistently made  Before even receiving burrito quarter fell into tub crabmeat   Any toppings ask clumped spread careful if ask wasabi unless sudden mouthfuls it  price you're better off going SOHO campus least won't feel you're torturing staff when order  H2O potential but staff just doesn't care enough successful  <EOR> Man oh man place da bomb    ordered poke bowl sushirito done minute    boy tell hit right spot real  price right girl behind counter rocking good job guys keep up   will back more  <EOR> A great place grab poke bowl   plenty meat your bowl definitely full end   am high protein low carb diet perfect place since salad bowl option   also scoop extra protein which only little extra   also good number toppings such crab ginger avocado  H2O sauce which full flavor without making feel bad   also soak dressing   definitely go to whenever am visiting Vegas <EOR> It seems sushi burritos popping everywhere over Las Vegas     getting 3 stars because vegetarian options lacking and or nonexistent     The food good but plenty other sushi burrito places town many more options  fact no veggie protein options egg? Tofu? bummed flavors didn't seem special  However friend poke bowl he loved it  <EOR> We happy  Happy happy !

Fish fresh portion perfect lunch  If lived I'd back time again! <EOR> I excited sushi burrito  location close strip     thought might crazy     but only couple group three ordering    When walked noticed place bit dirty  should cleaning place twice day traffic going through there    Parking easy but see could huge challenge during peek times  center lot different food spots might challenge evenings weekends?   Anyway walked line behind three folks obviously never before  people celiac asking gluten free options  manager ever mid age woman snipped customers  Then when clarifying Order attitude really rude nooo reason all  folks being nice just asking simple questions food order sure son wasn't going affected    She just rude walked out  If she treated them gluten allergy    did expect nice vegan! Mean humans      enough said! <EOR> A nice walk strip good   Vegas recently found H20 Poke   perfect lunch spot us   1 Walking distance at least us stay Polo Towers next Planet Hollywood 2 price great     3 fish amazing Poke Sushi Bowl    instead  sushi roll     or maybe sushi salad    its core great tuna least 4 some cooked options if don't Sushi   Fish Tacos some cooked fish items menu     but poke why stay   Everyone did poke bowl   also Sushi Burrito but bowl seemed more filling better lunch item group  <EOR> Acceptable but great  place overwhelming fishy sewage smell which unpleasant  Additionally forgot put fish bowl  When asked them gave small portion cup rather 3 scoops should received  okay since BOGO coupons but back  <EOR> The quality fish spectacular starting salmon spicy tuna   The vegetables fruits also very fresh even mango tangerine!
