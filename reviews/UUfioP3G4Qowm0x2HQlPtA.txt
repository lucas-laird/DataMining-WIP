Nothing special it  rice tasted old  might try again  But its nothing compare cafe rio   <EOR> Gross over priced    We really looking forward place opening because right around corner us  let down   We soon opened excited when home  soon incredibly disappointed portions taste temperature    1 Everything ICE COLD  slightly less warm travel more never warm    2 Very weird proportion toppings meat  Huge scoops salsa top tiny pile meat   3 Nothing all seasoned  guac pale green paste  place called hot head nothing heat flavor    I don't mind paying some good money Mexican place but hard justify prices  <EOR> Seriously fantastic! subway burritos never fan chipotle finally really nice burrito bowl nacho and much more place find  Wish San Diego! <EOR> Place similar Chipotle Qdoba   Stand line walk through build burrito bowl etc   They even smaller burrito smaller bowl   thought both small versions still pleanty food   There various other similarities different salsas toppings including two different cheeses lettuce   Now where things start different   MORE meats   spicy versions chicken steak BBQ pulled pork i really it    Now kicker   maybe ten different sauces finish off your meal with   favorite house hot head sauce   Its garlicy sweet salty slight kick   Id put stuff cereal if could figure it     The only thing dont seems food doesnt stay hot long   sure if its packaging issue build burritos what   burrito robertos don tortaco breakfast still burn mouth lunch   Well maybe more thing sometimes staff don't good job rolling burritos kinda explode all over but  why bowls  <EOR> Very good Barbacoa burrito felt eating healthy  enjoyed food sure why everyone writing bad reviews  back  <EOR> This establishment serves perhaps worst burrito area  8$ cold steak burrito fell apart before first bite taken  Would recommend anyone enjoys decent food  other hand If McDonalds appeals your taste buds would most definitely suggest hot heads  <EOR> My best friend often  Fresh ingredients always positive staff  Much preferred over Chipotle Zaba's  <EOR> Really good food  recommend steak burrito everything  habanero sauce added great!!!! also sampled tacos taco meat also pork  Really sweet great  really recommend going here  Great service great food  would add more stars if could  Definitely coming back again  <EOR> My wife stopped try   loved it   Great service clean facility   best thing besides overall taste problem making decisions new restaurants   asked employee he likes instead just telling chicken something basic he described favorite burrito right down beans amazing habanero sauce   asked best burritos had   Great Job Hot Head staff  <EOR> It same concept Chipotle but feel portions bigger  But does sauces  standards chipotle but around 8 more ranging mild Very Hot  Also attitude workers very friendly  very pleasant experience food great  returning <EOR> Food great especially chicken which found quite delicious when paired hot head sauce   sure where few negative reviews coming found food Hot Head Burritos lot better Chipotle and big Chipotle fan many years   Service good but clear new still working some kinks out   definitly back look forward trying all various sauces available  <EOR> Great Just needed part Southern Highlands another burrito place  checked them see compared cookie cutter Del Taco more authentic albeit greasier Don Tortaco    We didn't care it  family four all ordered burritos sort season less muck  am vegetarian offering confusing huge chunks squash which if anywhere near hot might bad    While understandable store relatively new addition strip mall crew just getting hang things doesn't leave enough faith try them again   Unimpressive  <EOR> Delicious!

<EOR> I burritos better Chipotle's glad there's Southern Highlands  just more flavorful guess little different since believe only itin Nevada  <EOR> Burritos loaded los rice beans corn   but small little scoop meat  <EOR> It's okay  Servings extremely small even if large bowl  Guacamole nasty  way sour  tell added way much lime  should charge extra if gross anyways  can't even taste avocado  Onions fresh  did aroma taste onions have  employee scooped very bottom metal container  carne asada meat also served very cold  don't recommend place  Employees did really care either  <EOR> I over Mountain's Edge once friend invited try Hot Head's  am fan all other chains agreed give all much different since everyone uses same couple ingredients couple meats rice beans etc       I really impressed Hot Head's! individual ingredients great I pork usually other places but really made unique all sauce choices  sweet habanero burrito hot head sauce side  Being able mix match sauces livens options instead same old combinations   Service super friendly since place still really new cut them some slack little stuff two tries roll burrito etc  but none really effected experience   I definitely back when am area hopefully when open some closer home work!
