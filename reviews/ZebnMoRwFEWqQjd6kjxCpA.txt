Oh yeah bring cash    no credit cards accepted! <EOR> After way many days nights strip headed rental car looking sports bar neighborhood haunt could sit relax paying $12 drink  $40 dinner  drove down Flamingo saw sign said 'smokers welcome'  thought Iclever marketing scheme? kept driving all could find Mexican Asian restaurants bars and looking burger sandwich place  decided head back Zodies  lot empty except 2 cars  in  was greeted customer bar a gal worked 3 jobs Vegas bartender Julie  sat bar ordered diet coke played video poker  No food because smoking ban where food served but Julie quickly told could just anything wanted delivered she willing calls me  decided to  place dump broken down needing repairs but tell awesome experience service friendly people big city where invisible  back!  Also won $132  <EOR> When worked Obama campaign Las Vegas statewide headquarters right next door Zodie's   campaign heated started working 14+ hour days became harder harder muster energy well Strip cause really didn't much but Crown Anchor    Office Bar    picture   So started getting drinks Zodie's   bar bad all way around circle good again   bartenders inattentive if order anything involving more two ingredients all may funny look   music stereo plays radio   lighting awful   But somehow became bar   We even held staff New Years party here   believe broke stereo sorry!    good times  <EOR> This those places folks know each other name see same faces every week  NORM!! Really they're sweet locals here   I come karaoke mainly because host isn't ego driven he sings every rotation adds long boring hip hop vignettes between sessions short rotation take hours force leave singing song  like *some* places never return *cough*Blind Tiger*cough*    instead sweet mixture die hard karaoke ilk sing pretty good suck joint sing least 2 3 times before your second drink   The place never crowded smoky surprisingly   The bartender sweetheart remembers sang when even you've only couple times   My only complaint don't take plastic  carries cash millennium? Yes ATM but those fees I'd rather just drink water  <EOR> Good ol' Zodie's  When smoking ban into effect bar ditched kitchen mounted GIANT sign bold red print exclaiming SMOKERS WELCOME  admit ban probably good idea  cover statement each own everyone's opinion counts etc  etc  etc  But admire zeal which stood cause  Now decor Zodie's didn't click gourd until very recently  Why? don't know because now just apparent  place scattered zodiac symbols sun catchers wind chimes  lighting changes depending shift  If Jim Pete lights fullest level  But if Charla working she'll turn lights completely off fill joint candle light talk where your sun which planet your     can't ever follow but sure sounds nice  Everyone likes scapegoat when luck run dry yeah? also heard several accounts haunt hangs Zodie's which just adds place's appeal  goofs anyway  guess he wears white T shirt likes play TVs radio  never witnessed but keep hoping   The drinks good 'n strong  prices definitely affordable  did however cringe little when selected Night Life category because every time Zodie's only other people bar other employees  Golden Tee machine if take chance know bartenders stories certainly entertaining   It may everyone but favorite places cocktail  <EOR> I come mainly karaoke  drinks cheap but only accept cash if don't any  extra $2 atm nothing    The karaoke good quality but unfortunately don't EVERYTHING  asked Justin Bieber song he did it  seriously? most popular pop singer planet! even bother asking new song even if currently tops billboards   The KJ sweetheart though remember your name  Everything works normal karaoke setup should  Also computer never messes middle your song   There girl bar trying hit on  bartender NO  DAUGHTER  Why did bring your daughter bar if want drunk guys hit her?  Overall decent experience hence rating  more 3 5 because lack karaoke songs but round one! <EOR>
