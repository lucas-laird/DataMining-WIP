Sweet potato tots yummers  sure addictive little sprinkles but good  also Chicken Milanese Torta  Again bread really good but chicken mediocre bean purée made everything slide around  Also needed more sauce roll  going give place another try based good especially since first day  Staff nice exceptionally trained   I hope add table service here  <EOR> Let start saying am business owner myself own 2 bars 1 full pub food!! understand food service industry very well!   Anyways Just stopped coffee visiting mob museum  son ordered taco fries parfait coffee  enjoyed mine  But when sons food came out      looked bad hotdog stand food! portion $8 wasn't very big  But worst part basically cheesy fries drenched soggy slimy onions   He's usually easy please although wouldn't even wanted taste 1 French fry       guess if cheap greasy food you'd happy!!   He only 15 compelled ask alternative  did allow refund reorder  something! Although refund took 15 20 minutes lol  Oh sour cream RANCH! FYI <EOR> Overall underwhelmed experience  friend chicken caesar salad which he described anemic small sprinkling chicken $12  drawn 99 cent tacos  choose flour corn  sign said barbacoa chicken bean cheese  two barbacoa two chicken  barbacoa but ground beef  Seasoned ground beef  barbocoa another friend barbocoa burrito which did contain ground beef  Strike three price differences between listed electronic menu written menu  friend ordered sweet potato tots listed electronic menu $4 attempted charge $5  She pointed issue said listed $5 paper menu  Ultimately gave $1 but just careful this  least other item difference between price listed electronic menu v  paper    The positives fresh brewed ice tea $1 99 habanero salsa good no extra charge getting which should never  but  alot places seem charge sides dressing etc    <EOR> Extremely rude slow  made wait 25 mins 2 toasted bagels  When asked if would take long she packed them threw bag way  thanked she didn't even respond <EOR> This place nice prices outrageous surprising busier  must location  food really tasty burger fries enjoyed meal  bun tasty patty bit smaller thinner side but good tasting    On another visit pork burrito  liked flavor    Overall place reasonably priced food except milkshakes higher priced are   large waffle cone Lappert's instead  <EOR> Bad attitude  Keep your lessons ordering espresso home please  educate cashiers if want give lesson more courteous it  There's reason why tourists prefer pay top dollar same coffee  I'd rather pay $5 good time rather $2 headache! <EOR> Delicious!  meat tender everything fresh   torta amazing   love set place   haven say originally even though set nice bit sceptical but exceeded expectations   absolutely recommend place friends   work zappos looks found new spot lunch! <EOR> The food great liked it  see many reviews here  All seem negative but experience good if great  chicken nachos tasty  ordered another go  don't drink can't say anything bar area but people really friendly around here  satisfied if ever around downtown area definitely stop again  <EOR> So Freakin' good!! Love atmosphere love food so fresh fantastic service  Jessica Jesus Eric Rock! <EOR> Came happy hour   My boyfriend ordered margaritas  He strawberry margarita $5 which good  Would better if gave choice having frozen margarita instead rocks  regular lime margarita super sour tasted odd  ordered mojito good flavor  over powering  Would 4 star experience if bartender some personality wasn't blah attitude  Goodness she couldn't even crack smile  Kept asking if  it? Rushing service  Plain rude  couldn't catch name but remember blue eyeshadow she wore  nice tips  Bad service  Overall drinks okay  <EOR> Ordered 2 burritos parfait  told parfait would take hour make  hour put fruit cup yogurt  2 people waiting food 45 mins before waiting burritos  4 place over hour  Bartender nice manager joke  <EOR> Food The food average best over priced regular prices  don't know famous Sandoval guy but he must think very highly himself serving store bought chips  Even low end Mexican restaurants fresh chips  salsa both medium hot boring   Celebrity chef Sandoval needs take notes salsa offering taco bar Mariana's grocery store park lot  The rotisserie chicken good flavor but dried out  rice decent  Black beans no flavor  Very bland mashed  black beans  mixed salsa add some flavor but salsa needed help itself  The crispy chicken Milanese torta average  Light corn breading thin piece chicken breast    Service Counter service  order receipt bit know when your food ready  sat down  took name but never called name  sat sat sat     Eventually ask where food just sitting counter  <EOR> Decided try place dinner before heading show Smith Center   may better quick breakfast lunch   Definitely dinner   When walk see bar front you    deli like counter right    far left dark corner maybe kitchen?  Very confusing   large space scattered tables chairs   order right deli counter    then sit wait table your food delivered dark kitchen area   food?  Can't even remember it   over shadowed confusion  <EOR> Discovered gem when staying Downtown Grand Hotel  why doesn't hotel publicize Commissary??? great concept quick easy foodservice beverage  necessarily plush    but definitely comfortable great hospitality   Great coffee shop Jenny awesome! Lavazza    'nuff said The latin chicken lunch incredible moist just right amount spices  Perfect    And bar Commissary bartender Adriana   another terrific asset Commissary exactly needed long day exploring LV  Manager Kris Sainsbury should complimented attention guests throughout 3 day stay  Overall very well run operation great food beverage options!  This hotel needs promote Commissary would never known other just happened stay here  Downtown Las Vegas rebound would quickly no doubt crowds soon   Now   if only figure deal wind outside street could enjoyed outside tables        We back  <EOR> Very nice place deserves more stars currently has  place gets 4 stars because layout little confusing shakes just blended gelato  thought they'd bit more adult add toppings booze  No such luck though  Cuban sandwich great    Give shot  food really good great price  <EOR> A couple co workers decided try place lunch today since working Downtown area   first wasn't sure expect   didn't realize Downtown any decent places eat but pleasantly surprised   Area clean next Mob Museum   Food similar fusion style   ordered chicken Milanese torta   Very tasty!  enjoyed very much   fairly good portion however thought price bit steep   $10 00 order came small side chips but no drink   Restaurant airy clean cafeteria style setting   Many people working surrounding areas having lunch place would good business luncheon   Staff friendly   much more say   Maybe when pay day feel splurging bit bar style food trip back here   also want try happy hour  <EOR> Loved cute modern minimalist cafe  Very reasonable prices just hop skip jump Fremont street  little quite side since new many people know but staff very friendly even though rowdy two year old us  manager nice friendly even came talk us  food nice portions especially price  Definitely recommend quick nicely priced place eat! <EOR> This place just worst took husband daughter when first opened first off kid friendly all no high chairs booster seats also no idea where order person helping when finally sat down food seemed rather outrageous amount money paid  portions tiny pricing let alone order everything separate no combos  place basically food court  <EOR> This review coffee stand inside commissary  heading Vegas needed jump start keep awake while driving  ordered medium iced mocha add shot 3 shots total  darn thing cost $7 yes 7 bucks which probably most ever paid coffee  girlfriend try she coffee snob she stated best coffees she's ever pay for  <EOR> We burger fries  Very good!

<EOR> wow came last summer pleasant experience but time literally commissary   horrible service horrible food   the only thing star worthy bathrooms clean stocked hands didnt dry themselves <EOR> 3 5  Came breakfast dinner 2 nights while staying Grand  Service fast friendly food pretty good   Breakfast I crepe chocolate strawberry which just chocolate syrup strawberry jelly or jam   ok  definitely better crepes  Hearty ones real fruit nutella but just syrup  crepe itself wasn't great   Also breakfast burrito  sausage ham egg cheese  good  Didn't blow mind    better but bad   Dinner One night tacos  chose 1 chicken 2 latin smoked brisket  Really good!  latin smoked brisket especially yum  Mexican rice you 2 sides taco plate   didn't care it  husband bacon burger which tried good  He liked too   For dinner second night turkey burger which enjoyed  Also onion rings which wasn't crazy about  big onion just fell right when you'd take bite   The place itself cool  love set decor  agree other reviewers bit confusing where order  would definitely come again try other things menu  if anything know latin smoked brisket tacos satisfy me  <EOR> After friend's review expected baristas fountain workers Lavazza Coffee Cafe exceptional lackluster  No sense excitement urgency twosome when came me  next guest obviously regular knew order before he asked even knew usual partner crime's! attribute experience super high expectation   My latte made care barista melted honey requested bottom cup before adding ice milk  asked milk wanted but turned fine  I pop back tomorrow see if more lively afternoons  <EOR> I'm giving place two stars due food  gotten same thing chicken bowl each time pretty good    The major issue place inconsistency  work far each time gone something different  hours always changing ordering process always different coffee shop always gets rid stuff etc  quite annoying    The staff seems annoyed most times service mediocre best  very disappointing  good food only far  <EOR> I trip Vegas stayed down town grand  found myself eating commissary almost everyday  food good fast hot  know fresh when making front your eyes  Love cubano torta which ham carnitas Swiss cheese press together panini machine   I wish place home town   Also place only walking distance lattes coffee drinks!

removed bacon hoping cut salty taste only realize bacon  wasn't able finish half burger due crazy amount salt  am still tasting salt    Co worker same burger nacho fries  burger just salty mine  nacho fries blah cheese salt fries    We back try latin food just sure isn't case ordering hamburger sushi restaurant  But am looking forward it         Co worker ordered <EOR> More quasi Latin kitchen   Latin food if want but also burgers most coffee selections hardly Latin    At first frappe coffee drink frigid mocha latte    $6 00 16 ounce blended coffee drink overpriced but very tasty    At another counter double burger   only choice cheese cheddar but burger actually relative bargain $8 25   two greasy patties nicely melted cheese tomato lettuce onion turned good choice    This tough judge more 3 5 stars but Yelp ratings pushed 4 stars due inviting eclectic decor really off beaten path compared much downtown    just across street Mob Museum also good choice before trip museum  <EOR> Our first 10 seconds place set tone meal there    walked told order bar  bar order told needed ID'd bc bar even though no plans drinking just order  2pm  Huh? Kinda weird    But hell since bar anyway saw Ayinger Bräu Weisse menu spelled incorrectly ordered brew  came Anchor Steam Christmas Ale  Not  Even  Close  both start 'A' but bartender should know menu  Strike 1  order food move table  table sit off kilter elbow made beer spill all over phone  Strike 2    The buzzer off pick food  gf's salad looked decent but spicy dressing wasn't listed menu  good boyfriend didn't trust tastebuds tried myself  100% kick  She return didn't full tude but def nice 'wtf' stare chef  salad remade brought new dressing only lacked avocado paid extra chicken way undercooked  Strike 3    For meal half Cubano soup combo soup looked something would served airplane    flying coach  Progresso square plastic bowl  Eek  Saving grace?

On first visit Caesar salad   enjoyed but dressing surprisingly spicy   may over well your typical Caesar consumer   second visit brisket burrito   would say far better Chipotle     There few things keep Commissary receiving five stars   first thing service   found people taking order both occasions didn't seem exceptionally knowledgeable second visit order incorrect   attribute fact restaurant relatively new   I also little unsure atmosphere   found music little loud side first visit making hard converse dinner companion   second visit contemplated getting coffee adjacent coffee bar popping iPad little work done   discovered Commissary does offer free WiFi which kept ordering coffee   keeping coffee bar atmosphere would think free WiFi would must   Overall enjoyed Commissary but enough way visit again  <EOR> Stopped quick lunch friend Wednesday afternoon  staff friendly helpful everything impeccably clean enjoyed decor loved tufted sofas sat on! cobb salad pretty uninspiring price however  wasn't much enticed menu doubt I'd back    maybe fancy milkshake but menu wasn't clear enough entailed lay down 9 clams it  Just lunch spot me  <EOR> I've gone Commissary few times always ordered burritos  burritos always win win    I tried being adventures today ordered Pepito torta mexican sandwich   Totally disappointing  wasn't lot carne asada sandwich well flat flavor taste  ordered sandwich side dipping sauce which believe supposed enchilada sauce but bland tasted more tomato paste  Also sauce cost extra $2    The two star because didn't flavorful fulfilling meal paid $15 31  prices bit steep but again burritos worth it  Guess stick next time <EOR> Really! 17 00 mini Cobb salad wait 25 minutes for  big rush either  Overpriced food patient because slow  <EOR> They charge $4 cup coffee     just going let marinate   Starbucks doesn't even charge $4 coffee   Then top off    offer self serve FREE coffee guest  Please tell logic behind ? never back even if work downtown  <EOR> The Asian cashier very rude I believe name Michelle   She professional all first last time come here  first noticed she attitude since waiting line  hoping other cashier help but unfortunate enough end grumpy lady! hope does ruin rest day  <EOR> I visited Vegas Jan   2018 stopped co worker friend  place redecorated but still quaint cozy    Seems some gaming competitions take place now menu totally changed   I ordered salad $5 large salad surprisingly chicken tacos good well   My friend also happy chicken tacos well   They even added popcorn machine FREE  The drinks good well   The Prices great well <EOR> Ate multiple times yet disappointed  far breakfast meals chorizo cheese burrito flippin' awesome  order sour cream salsa  Steel cut oatmeal blueberries  brown sugar pretty tasty filling too  good strong coffee  Iced latte good cafe au lait   Also tried crab guacamole during happy hour another visit tried sweet potato tots  Loved those!
