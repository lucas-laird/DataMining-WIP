Everything fresh tasty It also great talking staff took pride doing made!  Definitely going back more! <EOR> Decided try place because reviews expected lot better but place let down poke reasons!  1  Freshness  fish bland no natural flavors  just felt fish sitting long time couldn't even taste natural fresh flavor  When chewing ahi skin kept peeling off super gross! salmon tasted off looked odd  Maybe imitation salmon?  2  Serving size  amount serving each scoop ridiculously small  If you're gonna order bowl you're gonna need two scoops more!  3  Flavoring pricing  didn't much choices sauces stuck spicy ponzu  Again tasted bland just ended adding soy sauce some more flavoring  pricing other hand its expensive outcome  total bowl $14 95 two scoops  top pay extra seaweed salad toppings barely choices toppings  basically $15 45 poke bowl didn't even finish because tasted AWFUL!!   For any tourists visiting vegas better off going soho sushi burrito Sahara see roll s  Rainbow  Might little bit drive but worth it!!! same amount food cheaper price better quality!! <EOR> 5 5 loved it!

Usually poke places come 2 protein MINIMUM you're letting choose between two proteins? Sure lets just offer least amount possible charge $$$ because Vegas  justifiable right?!  Another thing most poke places offer unlimited toppings excluding more expensive ones such crab meat avocado  place offers FOUR toppings only toppings bizarre couldn't even choose 4  Some toppings offered corn broccoli spinach etc am Souplantation poke place?!  The only saving grace yum yum sauce  poke bowl good but definitely experienced better LA  being said price limited toppings both red flags won't returning  <EOR> Seems prices better now all tasted fresh only $11 two protein bowl which par LA prices  Coming east coast happy poke bowl fix here  Hawaiian poke though if  you're looking for  charge extra seaweed salad <EOR> This probably worst poki bowl experience had  First only give choice protein unlike some other places where put 3 5  Second hella expensive  $12 freakin bucks bowl small portion rice shit load mayo that's all tasted   Third charged extra without warning  Unlike chipotle where if u say u want guac automatically say extra dollar  place just put u pointed charge u without warning  defense its written window extra charge attitude  Just wow   end ended eating sloppy bowl item crap $14  No good  <EOR> Surprisingly very good poke roll Vegas! located Planet Hollywood  ended ordering poke roll salmon cucumber seaweed salad red onions spicy mayo spicy ponzu furikake crispy onions   It little difficult order since really loud person helping could barely hear us    The poke roll smaller size if big appetite might fill up  perfect size though!  My friends spicy tuna spicy salmon protein said wasn't spicy all   Free fountain drink Yelp check in  <EOR> Ein Fast Food Hawaiianer mit sehr leckeren Gerichten  Wir haben uns einen Sushi Burrito geordert wo man zwischen mehreren Sorten Fish Gemüse und Soßen wählen kann  Dann haben wir auch einen Pole geordert wo man sich eine  Bohle Reis mach dem gleichen Prinzip zusammenstellen kann  Ich persönlich bin ein Fan der Ponzo Soße  <EOR> First time trying Poukei! ended before concert  guy behind counter helpful putting together vegan bowl  thought food decent  bad all  But then   I continued explore city Vegas found another sushi burrito place  more vegan friendly which life much easier  visit Poukei if close but won't way it  <EOR> I think getting end    amount protein put now small hahaha almost everything extra charge! switch poké poku buy 1 1 free put much protein soft shell crab side dish free then even free miso soup sad say goodbye once favorite before <EOR> Having fan original sushirritos Bay Area nice see more poke places utilizing concept  first going order regular poke bowl but decided try sushi burrito instead  ordered firecracker which nice portion spicy tuna salmon along some veggies give roll some nice balance flavor texture  thought did pretty good job burrito would definitely try other selections next time visit Vegas  price point also pretty much par other poke establishments visited   Overall impression think pretty solid poke joint some nice variations choose from  <EOR> So say actually work mall eat quite often even though prices bit high lot options when don't time pack food  love food hence why eat quite often  Unfortunately tonight ordered food again portion small actually pathetic  Normally bowl FULL but tonight    it wasn't even half full! waste time money  don't know what's happening place but definitely going down hill <EOR> Cultural appropriation much?  Please tell kanaka maoli poukei means?  came fake Hawaiian name? <EOR> Giving 3 stars only bc didn't try poke but did house Vietnamese Iced Coffee attempt cool off 120+ degree Vegas heat    It's around $5 let tell you    could regret getting more    It far worst Vietnamese iced coffee ever had  third condensed milk sweet made pucker immediately  following sugar high headache    woof    I think cool own canned but done poorly point being inedible unfortunately  Hopefully they'll look training revise  <EOR> Bryon served today he really cool giving wanted! looking firecracker roll but he told more worth 2 protein sized bowl made poke bowl version firecracker DAMN lit guys!   Ask because delicious spicy! <EOR> It's shame cannot rate lower 1 star   First all initial impression establishment horrible because no workers could seen none came take order until started calling help  food itself very disappointing poke bowl containing VERY little protein well accompanying ingredients  addition bowl tasteless well visually pleasing  companion Joe also overcharged $2 some reason   Lastly no water cups only trashcan took some time locate   Overall place presents poke bad light would  never recommend place anyone even Trump  <EOR> My friends wanted grab quick bite eat before concert Axis  Poukei located right outside concert venue friends decided eat reluctantly agreed  Super casual poke place but decided beef bowl  poke did look fresh appetizing but friends ordered some luckily didn't sick afterwards  beef bowl below average all bowls drenched whatever sauces came food  known would asked sauce side    Next time choose where eat  Never again  <EOR> Not bad poke bowls but good enough back more  little pricey but  mall guess  much better poke less $$  <EOR> Simple fresh delicious! Service fast employees kind accommodating  Rice bowl salad bowl sushi burrito style  Three dining   2 custom bowls beef teriyaki bowl  Custom bowls salmon salmon spicy tuna mix  all very happy  DELICIOUS!! <EOR> This food good  Extremely over priced  impressed anything  bowl everything very sub par  Meat low quality  also sushi roll garbage  crab gross rice almost entire bowl  Don't eat here  <EOR> Poor protein portions limited options    allow 4 vegetables 2 toppings   Many other places gone allow unlimited toppings   would again  <EOR> The whole sushi burrito concept big   least where Sacramento area  Its also very strong following San Francisco Bay Area  But Las Vegas? Since lovely lady staying weekend Planet Hollywood Hotel looking place unique most importantly close live concert we'd seeing  ended having front row VIP seats Jennifer Lopez performing AXIS @ Planet Hollywood  made unanimous choice Poukei literally 50 feet away main entrance AXIS   The main seating area located Miracle Mile Shops which adjacent various stores eateries  When lady arrived which evening Saturday 9 30 17 actually nobody dining even ordering matter  particularly enjoyed place serves variety sushi burritos well build your own sushi burritos ground up  also carry nice variety Poke bowls  non sushi Poke eaters also offer very generous Teriyaki menu   I ended ordering build your own sushi burrito  way works pick base protein sauce vegetables toppings  ended choosing Nori seaweed base cooked shrimp protein Wasabi mayo Yum Yum sauces scallions carrots vegetables Masago fish eggs cream cheese premium extras  also chose Thai iced tea drink choice  Total price everything around $12 which very fair price sushi burrito drink Las Vegas Strip  lady ended ordering teriyaki rice bowl    Basically way works Poukei everything front you much ordering food Chipotle Subway  liked idea since nothing kept hidden  actually very impressed sushi burrito crunch cooked shrimp sticky rice Masago definitely hit spot  very filling amount food equivalent 1 1 2 sushi rolls    Overall only few places actually serves sushi burritos Poke bowls entire Las Vegas strip  Additionally also offer nice variety Japanese sodas Boba drinks teas  service just so so lady behind register just seemed dull quiet conversing me  However freshness food itself paired excellent prices give Poukei above average four star rating  <EOR> I ahi poki brown rice boy didn't taste very good all  having half instantly felt sick  wasn't tasty all  <EOR> As much wanted give 5 forgot put ahi tuna salmon crabs rest ingredients  delicious but forgot very first ingredient very tight salmon  might just walk jaburitto next time fish rice ratio equal  <EOR> I love food  only healthy spot miracle mile  Glad opened!!!
