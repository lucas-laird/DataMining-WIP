Why am paying same amount getting everything? Just plain stupid  <EOR> My boyfriend really sad place closed  tried driving seeing would order take half time dine other half  clean well priced good authentic Chinese I can't stand Americanized Asian food   lunch specials inexpensive never problem but place always ghost town every time went  Bad location? really very visible major streets high traffic  don't know problem but am sad see go  Time try other Chinese places bookmarked then  = <EOR> Very good food    Looking good Chinese food perfect place go    prices little high but worth it  am big eating but Chinese food thing splurge eat every other month    <EOR> Love place perfect hole wall chinese place  China Tom waiter super nice food good  favs far House Chow Main Mongolian Beef  Yes slow dining room But take into consideration most business take out  don't let stop you  <EOR> Probably best chinese town  But its rediculously cheap chinese food large portioned good variety  <EOR> It's all Salt Pepper Chicken Wings    Period  End  Of  Story   They offer ten wings great price around $7 00  wings regular menu listed under appetizer but TRUST me  meal   These chicken wings die for  covered bathed amazing batter wheat flour I finally asked because freaking good fried perfection   They always come piping hot crispy outside moist juicy inside  always seasoned perfectly topped sauteed onions jalapenos  smell awesomeness lures in  eat your tongue just starts slapping your mouth around because going crazy flavors  True story happened me  I normally dip chicken wings something whether ranch sambal sriracha  But fellow yelpers need nothing but savored is    They other flavors but nothing compares salt pepper offer   I am also fan beef dried chow fun  always fresh just good  always order stir fry broccoli son always cook he likes it  just ask slightly well done  always willing accommodate server he best when comes kids  He always giving away some kind toys vending machine  Another true story took son's Asian card away because he wouldn't eat rice but somehow man boy eat rice  hunny's jaws hit table because could believe it  man right touch when comes kids  definitely family kid friendly place which HUGE PLUS!   I can't attest many items menu because come simply salt pepper chicken wings chow fun  But steer wrong salt pepper chicken wings  definite must try   Don't let interior set back little divey  <EOR>
