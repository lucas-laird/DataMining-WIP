Then accidentally she drops something floor without hesitation she grabs grabs pizza it  just ridiculous When asked if she washed hands regarding dirty dish she denied it  Places need shut down serve public other experiences other location pizza hot but nothing this   Also cleanliness disgusting food all over floor see pics <EOR> Probably worst pizza experience life  ordered two pizzas online  usually no problem ordering online but just ridiculous  ready pick time suppose 7 12pm  ended getting Pizza Hut pick around 7 20 wasn't ready  waited when showed pizzas wrong toppings  first girl helped very nice but still pretty annoyed waited longer should have  Girl#1 tells girl#2 made wrong pizza girl#2 says well does she want do? girl#1 says she wants correct pizza girl#1 way nicer way   keep going back forth girl#2 just understanding just want another pizza replace messed up  very annoyed point because shouldn't wait long first place girl#2 tell just want ordered then she tells going pay another pizza  very irritated confused point  ask why pay another pizza if ones did order correctly first place  back forth few minutes just tell wanted new pizza she says they're just going another one  point over it  just want pizzas home  walk away girl#2 asks girl#1 which pizza wanted!!!! am livid point walk back counter tell girl kind pizza wanted  show phone ordered even though she holding receipt hand remind wings ordered also  When finally ended getting both pizzas first already cold  lot people complaining orders ready time also  Most likely won't return Pizza Hut location anymore  <EOR> Good service 10 minutes cashier told only reason why five stars though pricy large pizza 16 chicken wings 2 liter drink $28 65  <EOR> Update   Still haven't received refund basically stole money lied I'd 10 business days   and way longer 10 business days  surprised but still hopeful would money back such poor delivery service especially since owner reached Yelp  never back Pizza hut  <EOR> My location when need since down block  Only thing  holding  back more stars order isnt made correct sometimes  Other no problems  ^_^ <EOR> On best customer service recieve! Kenny most upbeat personality!!!!!

Thankfully included delivery charge  pretty much anywhere else pay 1 3 charged  back near future! <EOR> My second time ordering location   Last time wasn't great but thought would given them second chance   ordered online   Ordering smoothly food came within given time   hot seemed fresh   pizza breadsticks did taste good   Definitely big turn around last order   If keep would definitely continue order future  <EOR> I great experience here! phone quickly answered cashier named Stephanie  She answered all questions very quickly  pizza order ready quoted time  within minute so  Awesome experience  <EOR> I should listened intuition when picked up  open box showed finessed most dad looking pizza ever seen battled but ended excepting walking away now eating won't even stay straight flimsy cc pizza 15 years ago! Don't location guys don't give shit pizza they're making off Sunset Fort Apache <EOR> My wife ordered pizza 11 19 7 02 P M  pick time 7 20   arrived 7 25 ready   told another 5 minutes which turned into another 15 minutes  After waiting extra 20 minutes order asked two dipping sauces proceeded charge approx  $1 20 sauce  feel wait could gave those discount but nada Not best customer service  <EOR> Placed order today email said would take 39 minutes  hour later delivery still wasn't called shop just see going on  first thing young lady said when told checking oh god   She made seem burden her  She then said just busy call back if wasn't happy order  When delivery guy showed 15 mins told he needs tell manager he shouldn't people talking customers that  He kept apologizing saying she 17 first job  Common sense would tell anyone say oh god customers  never deal place again  Food cold time too  <EOR> I want throw when think happened Pizza Hut  ordered 2 med pizzas cookie hot wings  pizzas very mediocre lacking toppings cheese mainly dough  Pizza Hut always amazing! But location absolutely disgusting pizzas don't even taste Pizza Hut  pizzas  But worst thing CHICKEN WINGS! Pizza Hut chicken wings always best chicken wings ever  but again horrible location  looked wings thankfully before ate them full FEATHERS! never life! seen chicken wings still many many! Feathers them  definitely most disgusting experience ever Pizza Hut also ruined desire eat chicken wings  starting really give fast food  Cant wrong good home cooked meal  least don't worry eating Buffalo feathers <EOR> I ordered pizza pickup once arrived home realized hair food  simply called back location asked remake them deliver me  didn't think much ask considering wasn't fault  told  wasn't option all while being super rude when asked speak manager told wasn't even tho when picked pizza clearly saw man solid red polo shirt which different rest  need work customer service  <EOR> Avoid all costs  Inedible pizza  Received room temperature best  brownie ordered mushy wouldn't come pan piece came pieces  Ordered hand tossed crust received something more along lines inedible thin crust  employees no idea product being advertised website said order wasn't ready while sitting right behind them  never problems Pizza Hut decided give location try since closest moving  definitely wish hadn't! <EOR> Ordered multiple times Pizza Hut location consistently unimpressed  service decent delivery guys friendly enough but never pizza fast hot which effect may well same ball   The pizzas received each order obviously sat restaurant longer should prior dispatch whatever Pizza Hut calls keep warm sleeves transport pies in  service times also notably slower other delivery joints area  I'm going compare Pizza Hut Jimmy John's somewhere prides itself super speedy service things don't require baking but Domino's far superior both timeframe quality delivered goods instance  and overall far less impressed Pizza Hut with    well everyone else  When moved into service area first noticed service slower other side town different location  Having called orders both realize longer hold times well which could account longer delivery times but if all pizzas getting baked ready but getting delivered while cheese still hot stringy consistent basis need wait another couple minutes before throwing next batch pizzas through oven hire more drivers  If you're doing amount business requires five minute hold time telephone afford another driver rush situations right? Overall stopped ordering Pizza Hut started ordering Domino's  Quality better speed service better  Which means they're doing job pizza delivery better end story  <EOR> Honestly     satisfied Pizza Hut  3 times roll   unhappy  don't think ordering Pizza Hut any more    Today ordered customized pan size pizza wings fries  When opened box pizza messy looked unappetizing  felt sauce just much  don't understand serve someone that  wings okay  But Cajun cries ordered   $2 lot    quantity very disappointing too    This isn't first time unhappy location  Other times forgot topping! Keep mind course did pay extra toppings  another time pizza extremely salty        At point rather choose Dominos  <EOR> Two stars because least try fix mistakes  Pizza good when good wings usually cooked very well  box deal good deal if you're looking mix foods   As experience wasn't great  messed pizzas but did fix order allowed take messed pizza home  location does mess lot  end visit cashier pennies she asked okay if short penny   thought myself she couldn't serious  <EOR> Night manager creepy rude  worth ordering here  recommend place  give finger hah thumb! <EOR> Two stars just BBQ wings   always very good  Pizza very hit miss  problem almost every time something wrong order  overcooked undercooked  If then toppings correct backwards ordered  last time worst  specifically stated no buttery garlic spread crust  Told caught time would there  pizza could completely tell started put then realized mistake but still tried pass off anyway  Guess can't high expectations when comes Pizza Hut  <EOR> Ok dont usually pick usually delivered people just awesome  pizza always good   It looks amazing tastes even better going lie probably shouldn't much but whatever  cheat day <EOR> Early afternoon I'd ordered 2 pizzas delivered  3 miles away 6 30 didn't want leave gathering pick up   called 5 30 ask 7 since party physical therapy late   first refused then took CC again said 'will do'   When pizza delivered little 7 which fine pizza pretty cold no way reheat we're thinking would tasted better if hot seems still cooked 6 30 let sit until delivery 7 yup seems way   We'll choose someone else another time    <EOR>
