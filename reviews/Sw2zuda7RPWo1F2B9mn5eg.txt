As another reviewer stated prices food provided definitely cheaper you'd spend home making it!   So *list*   Pros 1  SPACIOUS  maximum capacity Al Madina states occupied 46 people most  However if taste food once guarantee you'll back you'll bring back khandaan #extendedfam 2  Chinese Indian American $2 99 breakfast?!   HOLY SMOKES place lot choices  wasn't able taste Chinese evening because seemed soft grand opening but excited hands some food too!  3  PRICE RIGHT! Ever pay $2 your local Indian restaurant cup hot masala tea? sucks  Al Madina's chai properly hand made any GMO ish   and 50 CENTS tea!! *I've told owner prices NEVER change hope  true because if review *  4  bit more adequate portion sizes  think  great large family sizes  SHARE your food mom pop style  in laws all 5 able really full REALLY fast   5  Friendly ATTENTIVE owner Syed staff  needs addressed quickly water never left empty chutneys other things ALWAYS offered chai! Recommendations given if know know inquisitive type all questions answered too!   Cons suggestions restaurant 1  Probably much bad thing but if prefer less oil your food ahead let them know  come family where oil and salt used staple ingredients doesn't bother much!  2  Bright lights shining bright diamonds 8 30 pm ! little dimmer would seriously perfect atmosphere    PS  Grand opening Ramadan  God Willing InshAllah place CHAATS opening couple months next door  those folks thinking just wrote chats instead chaAts CODE delicious Indian snacks *please google* #panipuri #paprichaat <EOR> Today 3rd time week dined here  restaurant very clean food tasty fresh  Moreover prices unbelievably low  owner Saeed very personable chef Adam Morocco   must try restaurant  chose Indian Chinese Moroccan dishes  Soft drinks bottled water only 50 cents!! coffee  must try soups too  eaten many restaurants frequented locals Las Vegas recommendation does come lightly  I know frequent flier should you  Bring your family friends  <EOR> Located right besides Smith's but shady looking alley other small storefronts  Walked greeted punch face funky bad smell lingered throughout restaurant  man sitting behind counter front seated down soon server came ask if wanted anything drink  second time asked if ready yet which responded few more minutes he disappeared back  But when ready he still nowhere found kindly attention man chilling behind counter order but he walks away back server  Okaaaaaaay he doesn't take orders all  fine  Does he chill counter cook security perhaps? But once server came took order same exact man stood right besides ordered constantly repeated item pointed at  guessing both charge making food but isn't bit security problem no else watching tending customers if any ? Decided halfway through ask placed to go boxes but shout into kitchen no else outside ask  Fast forward mysterious bag food placed counter man chilling back counter again  Maybe mine? Maybe another guy's since he sitting table waiting too  eye contact  Nothing  Okay maybe ours  pay guy just stares looks elsewhere while standing right front him  Maybe he's waiting server translate? 3 4 awkward minutes pass sitting back down since clearly he wasn't going anything he finally says ready  Wow really?! Okay back paying  still he's stating total showing bill see charged sure  just stare  scout screen states amount due   Having language barrier completely fine but running business zero communication not  even basics point order menu hello goodbye yes no thank numbers  least server trying best handle customer service part job   Contrary basically all reviews praising restaurant feel all phony  food very much worth price  it  pay for  But portions just ridiculous! couple dollars more SAME meal elsewhere you'd full portion  discount few bucks less regular prices place literally give only 1 4 portion DESPITE being HALF regular pricing  Expect only 2 3 pieces meat per bowl rice <EOR> OMG!! delicious  they just open wife  highly recommend  you see cooked love   <EOR>
