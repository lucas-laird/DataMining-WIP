Tropicana before  usually lucked friendly enough staff bartenders  But bar manager place Scooter super friendly! Apparently trivia bar patrons and told no pulls fast ones googling answers actually play game while friend eating he going through questions just keep entertained    I'm huge beer drinker usually stick Boddingtons when but place looked decent selection  imagine less Trop location just based size place but nice selection none less    Since did sunday night imagine wouldn't packed  but perfect going for  which few beers chicken curry  portion pretty hefty easily shared between two people    Since other location closer house see myself going more often  but super treat last night  probably back just Scooter  <EOR> I very excited try pub friends ever since voted best fish chips way back when   The server quick take order   ordered ice tea onion rings appetizer fish chips course   rings came rather quickly came side ranch dressing   Although lightly battered literally dripping oil much small pool oil plate   fish chips consisted medium sized piece fish thick cut fries small bowl peas   fish above average breading touch heavy side   breading came off small amount vinegar   tartar sauce sweet making difficult taste relish any other flavor   fries nothing write home looked overcooked mushy peas were   peas   The service worst part dining unfortunately   Although waitress super cute especially outfit nice ice tea took forever refilled usually request it   When came time ask check she gave check only other party pub     So disappointing average food below average service  <EOR> Fave bar Vegas local number years  The Girls friendly  Great happy hour prices  Plenty winners video poker games too    The Little Crown Chinatown vastly superior Crown Tropicana which filled limeys glare when walk wondering why bar    The beauty Little Crown bar small can't help striking conversation other folks everyone locals ex pat Brits tourists  Tell Marlene said hi    <EOR> I pretty drained work just going default old favorite  But then drove place remembered something try Mondays     I found walking inside Little Crown Anchor Pub offers same all eat fish chips $13 95 Mondays 5pm thru midnight its big brother does  Having never tried AYCE special before decided take advantage opportunity   The first plate brought huge  actually sure would've able handle fully optimal eating shape  huge pile chips perhaps generous helping peas battered fish of course lemon slice dipping portion tartar sauce   I think crispy batter best part meal but fish itself slightly dry fairly bland  Everything bland side really no combination condiments salt pepper malt vinegar tartar even ketchup truly helped situation  chips strongly resembled Red Robin's boring steak fries  They'll happy bring only fish continuation your AYCE experience but ended taste buds dulled both repetition some sense feeling full  flavor aside doubt fish filets premium cuts given nonchalant attitude toward providing seconds toward wasted food   I wouldn't really bother returning Little Crown Anchor Pub just fish chips  service friendly though music quite fun fun both when pop alt indie rock hits when recalibrated playlist older audience  <EOR> So outside looked nice Typical British village homes Anyway ordered 2 Steak Kidney Pies mash which ordered 1 hour before pick but when lady behind bar told 5 10 more minutes but instead Huge chunks microwaved potato's not only but whole thing microwaved pie just crust top filling revolting extremely sour  shame really wanted place since wanted relive childhood memories some nostalgia  But no    instead something far British cuisine    When think British Pub just British food general think something warm cozy very tasty home made clean  But here  <EOR> I love some Crown Anchor  Every time am Vegas try stop here  usually eat 2 things menu love every minute it  If Monday Night all eat fish chips some best ever had  Any other night week grab chicken finger some fries  Warning !!! chicken finger stand best ever taste  know delight palate  think wish little different bear selection  Though wide verity don't many Mexican beers which usually drink  way can't wait next time Vegas some Crown Anchor  <EOR> Crown great service cold beer patrons appreciate celebrate both! <EOR> I've thrice really looking forward liking joint but didn't turn way here's why  last two experiences seriously super underwhelming due fact last nights visit bartender tells he doesn't beer tap because something broke    Yikes!  Then visit before told waitress sat down ordered drinks grill broken which meant couldn't any grilled chicken burgers etc    left all trying suck down some horrible roast beef deli meat + fried chips which waste taste buds    At point come conclusion C A myself aren't meant drinking buddies because every time there's always something wrong equipment    Anywho would encourage any foodies give C A exploration sake see  but totally done exploring end possibilities which came little soon    Oh well    Good luck foodie heads! <EOR> Woohoo!  Finally came driving many times   Cool English pub some dart boards if  floats your boat sports channels playing multiple tvs  Bar poker keno etc  too   Beer little pricey side I'd say off strip $6 pint Newcastle   Otherwise food pretty fairly priced  far best value fish chips far! Mondays $15 all eat fish n chip days!
