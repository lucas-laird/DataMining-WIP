This when tired hungry  Grilled chicken sald no rice! Great portion size semi healthy if only sold house dressing bottle!  Only downside usually line  However well worth it  <EOR> Met some friends over cafe rio fun lunch   The environment very home like   Fun music design place feels live    The order incredibly quick  ordered chicken quesadilla checked phone second looked food ready  Lol    The food Amazeballss  wasn't best but price delicious  favorite hot sauce too! Cholula!!   The horchata deserves 5star  <EOR> Well say but place sure changed! tried twice past four weeks  wonder if new manager  Anyhow food containers very messy  queso used good still other locations  But queso thin kind something  returned twice because liquid flaky  staff says way is  When asked speak manager told she back 30 minutes nobody else talk to  Good thing other locations    <EOR> Simply amazing visiting NM friend suggested Cafe Rio first bit skeptical but WOW!  Staff bit frantic unorganized but food made it! <EOR> The food really fresh tasting lot choose from  experience getting salads sure watch much give you  employees extremely stingy  paying nearly $10 salad should getting paying for  Also feel though employees aren't trained properly  never look act know they're doing  90% employees rude disrespectful  attitude give horrendous! Bottom line food good staff terrible  <EOR> Ate today b c seemed real popping spot full people when actually ate next door previous day  little disappointing  guess ordered most popular burrito Sweet Pork Barbacoa which don't wrong good but wasn't impactful me  ordered burrito sweet pork enchilada style green sauce presentation good price roughly 8$ think pretty standard but feeling sweet pork little sweet couldn't finish burrito b c kind tired sweetness? hope understand saying  impressed crap load hot sauces mounted wall choose but tried using some sweet pork tastes just don't mesh well together  i'd just skip it  place alright but if going Vegas better options hit up    <EOR> My first time probably last  really very good  definitely mexican  mexican Taco Bell  But rather Taco Bell  steak salad  good but just very normal  $10?  much  easily home  good thing say place ranch lemon sauce salad delicious  would buy bottle it  If come back wouldn't mind eating again  But mom burrito she ate salad because she hated burrito  Barbacoa  meat pretty good  But sauce  sauce put top gross  worst ever tasted  Completely ruined burrito  also tasted rice super bad  only wanted try asked little salad  take because even would would eat she eats almost anything   I would never come again unless to  would eat salad awesome sauce  <EOR> Cafe Rio great  offer fresh produce food great price  Barbacoa pork quite tasty great tostada  <EOR> I really Cafe Rio whole but location awful   used great but now line always seems extremely long   Tonight gave half special ordered   loud shout order   noticed started skimp portions   daughter's quesadilla hardly any cheese all practically just toasted tortilla folded half   guy front ordered extra meet tostada   initially going saying comes 2 oz meat  plenty   employee next finally added extra meat   MINT limeade didn't any MINT it   This place used great customer service even when busy   gone down hill lately big time!  fully recommend Cafe Rio just location!!! <EOR> Amazing Pork salad!!! could eat meal everyday   Come Seattle please!!!! <EOR> This first time dining there   Chipotle style food creation but better options flavors felt!

I friend both cheese enchiladas mild sauce mine medium   Both lunches two sodas came $20 right track wanting spend    I complimentary condiments added rice beans pico sour cream guac    my friend said no   but then decided cash register she wanted sour cream   some reason enchiladas $1 10 more mine plus add $1 00 side sour cream   didn't realize til looked receipt later   tryna complain $2 but ONLY reason why dropped star just accuracy register  Otherwise order taker creators great smiles all around knowledgeable   Nice atmosphere Coca Cola products Coke Zero Diet Dr  Pepper Horchata   yum!! <EOR> Ah oxymoron known pork salad   travel all over Vegas looking best  enjoy Chipotle Zaba's enough but superior quality unbelievable portions Rio  When friends stay town bet take them here  simultaneously love taking them hate knowledge don't Cafe Rio hometown  Hehe   Start base  the tortilla  homemade warmed soon order stay soft all way through your meal  order Barbacoa pork salad all hail sweetest most moist pork around   man gets dual protein burrito which size newborn takes two sittings finish  Mahi Mahi tacos excellent side note    What love much service guys don't run down line cattle which felt part Chipotle during lunch rush  many times Chipotle watch bowl fly down line away yell sorry   would what?!?! Oh salsa! Mild please    When ask which dressing would just say house   think avocado ranch could drink cup  perk Rio horchata served here  salad massive rich though can't even finish let alone chase sweet rice milk    Bottom line if you're going pay $7 $9 meals and pay no matter where go worth your while just come Cafe Rio  Pull chair because stuffing face  <EOR> What's point having online ordering system if just going when walk door?  could gone through line gotten faster! Especially since weren't even busy! worst part when said something manager don't think even she didn't even apologize wait    Bottom line don't ever bother ordering ahead worth your time certainly don't care way! <EOR> The food great love place BUT ordering catered lunch always disaster  always fax orders ahead time now orders done online days advance never lunch ready pickup when request   We ordered lunch 20 items ready 11 30 noon lunch when showed haven't even started working it!!

If eaten would told them wanted something else    But chips salsa really good   sure If ever return   If mistaken think salad pretty good  <EOR> Gringo food all way   Dirty expensive no refried beans ! Two stars homemade tortillas   But still really dirty   Don't know why popular  <EOR> Fresh homemade tortillas  Takes food another level  Enchilada style burritos best both worlds  Lots good meat choices  But seriously can't over amazing tortillas are  Next time just going ask few side  <EOR> I tend hipster choices when comes food more obscure better  reasoning always made inclined dislike Cafe Rio  Bleh another Mexican chain? Psh more original! Then Barbacoa tostada  Holy crap wanted punch myself such hipster tendencies  Moist flavorful mass quantities only six bucks? am sorry doubted Cafe Rio  can't wrong tortilla smothered beans rice slow cooked pork lettuce cotija cheese tortilla strips creamy tomatillo sauce  tostada resembles salad more its namesake honestly time tortilla soaked just tossed it  But everyone's right barbacoa way times I'd catch friend glancing pork enviously between bites inferior chicken  <EOR> Amazing   Love food   addicted chips queso   Try chicken enchiladas if chance  <EOR> After trying Cafe Rio few times  now prefer place over Chipotle! They very similar Cafe Rio stand amongst competition sweet Barbacoa shredded pork just packed flavor just plain addicting! great salad burrito  Try enchilda style sauce cheese baked top burrito when burrito dollar more    I've tried steak tacos well  bad but nothing write home about  prices affordable food portions large  All ingredients always fresh prepared right front you    Try house dressing anything order  drinks ton selection but since Mexican restaurant suggest Horchata! location busier other cafe Rios but lot nicer inside  ready long line    <EOR> My wife very bad food poisoning place  use it  But don't being sick three days  Good bye cafe rio  <EOR> Gotta agree Tony B  here    taco salads freaking awesome  tried place first time last night quite crowded a good sign!   Seemed nearly everyone getting taco salads    Just know no ordinary salad  Additionally all means healthy salad  cannot delude yourself into thinking sticking your diet all if order this  Despite hefty calorie count yummy!!!  It starts huge homemade tortilla cheese melted it  Yes said tortilla cheese your freaking salad starts  YUM  pile your choice pork chicken beef I chicken fiance pork   both excellent   also serve rice beans romaine lettuce 2 kinds cheese guacamole tortilla crispy strips top  could barely finish half massive feast but half did eat quite delicious  Salad prices average $8 depending meat pick  <EOR> I read reviews suspected Cafe Rio  new Cafe Caubo which closed down few years ago  right all  knew loved Cafe Caubo find amazing salads etc  again Cafe Rio  <EOR> I come often food always good  However just now ordered salad  guy behind counter complete a'hole when tell because he didn't ask want salad  He made comments under breath   If hate your job much  all favor quit! <EOR> Great food! Fresh ingredients homemade tortillas  <EOR> I come least once week  Cafe Rio slightly above Chipotle when comes freshness quality ingredients  Consequently prices also little higher but really consistently fresh steak salads are  If health conscious salad without chips tortilla cut down least 600+ calories  <EOR> Honestly love food but don't understand why never keep A health rating? used C now B sure if kitchen unsanitary but won't eating until rating back A   EW! Also found rubber band hair Fresca sauce   location needs some TLC  <EOR> Barbacoa way go  tacos burritos tostadas quesadillas enchiladas salad  Whatever barbacoa should choice  fact noted winning awards initially caught interest but tasting cannot stop ordering just protein   This location busiest all them  Every time come am left waiting line 10 15 minutes  employees manning line quick efficient but only much person while waiting grill room free up   Regardless minor inconveniences enjoy food time time  <EOR> We usually come location all time new crew seemed didn't care interacting customer  your dealing robots assembly line rather restaurant experience  felt didn't put enough meat salad asked more guy cussed process threw some more meat said its gonna extra charge that  process he chicken all over counter just rushing  then girl making Queso she just dipped ladle without stirring thick film top Queso all over container without wiping it  also notice very well trained food handling just simply don't care  dissapointing love place but why food experience inconsistent? just want good food service  <EOR> I coworkers swear place but honestly cannot stand it  thought something wrong wasn't giving fair chance them least six seven times  fan   I am vegetarian fault limited selection but selections chosen just weren't par  tostada special Wednesday just impressive all though coworkers love it  think both sauces offer disgusting overall taste just   bleh  decided try cheese quesadilla two times     bleh  undercooked greasy!   Lastly place just damn loud! employees always yelling something when someone orders extra extra that  barely participate conversations coworkers having because can't hear over noise   Don't wrong must doing something right because place always jam packed when come during lunch hour coworkers LOVE it! just bag  food isn't good people say is  I'd rather Qdoba which find closest comparison  Can't compare Chipotle nor Zabas find way different far taste selection  Bon apetite! <EOR> Living matter Minutes place hearing many good things curious Oh long  Finally hot evening somehow switch air off house boiling no way going turn stove headed Cafe Rio    some odd reason Giddy little kid told all Disney land all winter finally summer come!
