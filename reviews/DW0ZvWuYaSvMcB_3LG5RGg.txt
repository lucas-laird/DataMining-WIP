We mood some Chinese food evening really didn't feel hiting Panda Express again although hindsight would better choice  We tried Pei Wei San Antonio fall 2012  wasn't overly impressed then but thought we'd give another shot  over west side town geocaching close where finished day   We came early Friday afternoon place wasn't very busy thought we'd able grab quick meal some decent service  placed order two steak lo mein dinners side pork rolls  sat down waited   and waited   and waited while food sat dying pass  Finally three busboy waiters came smoke break patio  brought Brenda's food over then pork rolls  asked dinner said it  pulled receipt sure enough even though cashier repeated back ordered 2 lo meins he only rang one  Since already bad taste mouth last visit Pei Wei declined order again   I tried pork rolls greasy mustard wouldn't even stick them  tasted Brenda's lo mein noodles really didn't much flavor all  suppose having food sit pass under heat lamp 15 minutes while server smoke break didn't help much  place really disorganized  While watched table 4 served  Three four people food while fourth served only 10 minute wait finally complaining staff   When waiter came around ask food he only asked the person didn't food front   He ignored Brenda completely  Zero stars way high rating place  could much better meal Panda Express better price better service    In baseball three strikes you're out  place won't even opportunity see third pitch  <EOR> So good   love coming dinner     Mongolian beef sushi rolls amazing     fast service  <EOR> I love Pei Wei   Chinese food without waiters   Good food good value   Kung Pao Chicken Brown rice favorite  <EOR> This place very casual quick stop Chinese place  your own order premade meals  Honestly price quick convenient food very good  easy eat take away which sometimes if busy office  Overall it  Wouldn't necessarily recommend anyone since isn't really dinner place spot but solid lunch choice  <EOR> The food great prices good  Everyone cool except waitress lady chinese decent  Im all rascist  Just trying point which one  She gives u dirty look if don't tip amount she desires  Its pei wei pf changs   Am supposed tip same?
