SERVICE   Horrendous service   male server could give damn helping us   He absent slow non friendly   5pm place only 1 2 full   He disappeared long stretches even when paid wait receipt    spent over hour inside just because slow service   wanted couldn't because bill held hostage!

Gracias!!! <EOR> I'll start off saying arrived around 845p later realized closed 930p may attributed atmosphere service     We seated many empty booths but couldn't actually sit down until booth cleaned off crumbs left behind last patrons   did notice some stains upholstery seat some white smears only hoped could sour cream hands small child    The chips salsa just okay   salsa nice taste consistency but chips looked bought store tasted same   beans however tasted extremely bland old wouldn't fed them starving dog    We ordered shared chicken fajitas which came sizzling presentation quite nice   served additional plate guacamole beans rice    beans looked same ones served chips didn't try them   rice looked okay but didn't taste very good all only could stomach bite    Being nothing very great thus far didn't high expectations main dish   surprise fajitas pretty good   Cooked well through chicken just right   seasoning good flours soft fresh    If weren't rating would 1 star     The service rushed waiter wasn't all enthused which sure because towards end shift   did finish meal left well before 930p though    I won't returning anytime soon cannot see restaurant lasting much longer types standards  <EOR> Stopped dinner seeing Ameriican Sniper Suncoast theater  Wife ordered Chicken Cortez   ordered Tacos Pescardo shrimp  She said dish tasted terrible   Hardly ate any it   Tacos dish just so so  Skimpy shrimp  Better Mex other restaurants nearby  <EOR>
