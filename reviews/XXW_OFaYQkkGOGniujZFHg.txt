The pepper mill those places  hipster places must visit Vegas  off beaten path etc etc  I guess some extent still but no means unknown under radar  prices Pepper mill reflect coolness old school here   Why four stars?

Sounds great!  excited   meal came felt missing something   felt eating vegetable omelette realized NO sausage   called server over easiest task when she's running around tending many tables she said asked if wanted them remake it   told no since person came almost done meal   She later brought plate sausages   Apparently prep cook forgot bring sausages cook just threw everything together realizing sausage wasn't there   I realize mistakes happen wasn't server's fault didn't tip less would service   But wish she addressed management could made some sort adjustment leaving sausage   Seriously  giving someone car without brakes   chair no legs   hooker no condom   All above may work but leads incomplete potentially regretable experience   So while would probably given place 4 stars give 3   Give shot but realize cook may high leave key ingredients  <EOR> The Peppermill far best restaurants small diners found date  going Vegas since kid say easily favorite now  If don't want bothered large hotels ie wait long lines surrounded crowds people walk mile your car restaurant then choose place!

Funky decor neon lighting big fake trees throughout restaurant wonderful Fireside Lounge   best diner Las Vegas setting unforgettable   In lounge video poker machines bar fun but seats around water feature fire best!  Last time saw Brooke Punkin Charm School   She having fun some guys kept getting approached fans   left alone   The food very good far fried stuff diner food concerned   Don't expect healthy meal here   service quick friendly price fair   If Peppermill Vegas good news entire casino resort Reno under same name takes crazy design completely different level  <EOR> Many hotel cafe's close early food poor quaity  Peppermill prices par most cafes area give load food! late night dining place fits bill  <EOR> The Riviera next door alas now part fading Old Vegas history  mostly Fremont Street kind vibe   But good news Peppermill still still standing still going strong since GASP! Seventies! first visit most recent where bring out of town friends family want experience some back in the day Vegas kitsch  Best explanation heard given describe place having dinner inside giant disco glitter ball most part fairly accurate  purple and pink neon shimmery walls over the top bar lounge place you've see believe!

Awesome!!   And let forget drink menu  Typical bars lounges Vegas serve trendy funny named drinks where no idea what's but name Mouthfuck just drink it  Fireside  only cocktails reasonably priced STRONG but they're CLASSIC drinks would expect Vegas  only did recognize all drinks menu but some drinks classic vintage no age 25 ever them they're sort trendy again  very first Old Fashioned then followed first of many Champagne Cocktail  Honestly Champagne Cocktail where at!!  Then course music  True old Vegas style play Dean Frank Sammy Bing etc  then appease younger generation play Beyonce Justin whoever else popular days  However song selection sound level hardly offensive indeed quite mellow chill thereby allowing suckle upon your champagne cocktail other drink choice engage verbal social intercourse which might then if lucky lead other kinds intercourse  Really   place friggin awesome   BTW pic above lounge    adjacent restaurant <EOR> The vibe cool retro food consistently good   If wander into lounge certain seat fire Just don't try walk 360 degrees around fire pit    it mirror half way around Cheers! <EOR> Some friends late night craving steak heard good things place decided come  ordered steaks sadly best ones life  Find even finish  pairings bit off well  wanted mashed potatoes but server said decided fries instead  alright  steak also paired mushrooms which just alright nothing special  portions huge  give them that  But besides left sad unsatisfied  Maybe place better diner type food  If come next time sure order breakfast style type food  However far steaks would save money because prices Steaks aren't cheap another restaurant better tasking meat   In plus side staff friendly device pretty quick  <EOR> You walk expecting strippers but aren't any! Food okay nothing really brag about  LARGE LARGE portions couldn't finish it  Everyone happy loved different color sugar shaker  place once strip club? Remove tables private booth dancers   ? <EOR> You've seen Peppermill countless films courtesy its outrageous throwback decor most notably Scorsese's Casino starring Robert De Niro Sharon Stone apparently De Niro kept coming back long filming wrapped  Vegas must open 24 hours known its large kitschy drinks breakfast items  lived Las Vegas 1998 when still building Bellagio Strip looked very different  remember well coming lounge side Peppermill having eaten Ambrosia French Toast pancakes seeing retired strippers therapeutic tennis shoes car wash skirts suspenders running pots coffee around restaurant side while counter lined pilots uniforms  restaurant gets busy now but always popular visit when can  <EOR> Now you're Vegas having great time partying taken sights shows etc    place chill when want away craziness Strip    also place take your date chill drink doing shopping mall    fireside lounge quite nice    Drinks resonable hell you're Vegas We back next morning breakfast even though waiting time eat food bad all   fact when order mimosa    giant glass mimosa!!

No but all seriousness place amazing burgers fries  husband ordered sliders curly fries  shared some apps caprese shrimp cocktail   cheese caprese great quality would skip if you  shrimp cocktail good  Service somewhat confusing 3 different servers   other cool spot some diner food  would come back  <EOR> This restaurant very appealing atmosphere pretty decent menu  open all night which very convenient tourists looking eat something late night  did seem could use some help having more waitresses  Ours seemed waiting many tables <EOR> This review Fireside Lounge Peppermill restaurant   The staff waitress friendly   seemed bothered bit first because kept moving around but she warmed end   friends knew manager she came helped too   didn't wait long anything endless supply beer nuts   Everyone seemed pretty chill   No need impress above beyond just very casual relaxed   All waitresses wore long gowns could be a homecoming dress    thought nice touch   mean why right?  The goods heavy drinker just couple beers   complaint beers weren't cold manager put some ice before she brought them out   sip friend's margarita rocks pretty tasty   Another friend ordered nachos   weren't bad   really dark but almost positive mozzarella cheese them   Different but bad   don't think many people come food if you'll  probably disappointed     The atmosphere why Fireside reputation   Firepit surrounded water bubbled jets   Satan's jacuzzi   sat pit little bit but quite few ended moving different booth   booths comfortable squishy liked throw pillows   Lots greenery helps some booths more private   requested stay booth somewhat well lit very public Lord knows happens those private booths   pretty cool place pretentious all   ended swapping stories previous visits Fireside   If you're skittish conservative would recommend coming early evening all   place gets pretty diverting late hours   pimps girls come cocktails if you're lucky there'll mild drug exchange going booth next you   lot transvestites frequent joint too   I think because lighting almost nonexistent jk    They're really friendly prepared converse strangers   Every now again some famous someone other drop too   Again probably because lack lighting enjoy some privacy   TVs everywhere enjoyed old school old school music played   Beach Boys getting ollllllllllld but still lovable   think place older crowd but fresh pup open mind could probably really enjoy it   We going away party disappointed   good time didn't bother anyone volume   would recommend place casual together but if you're looking sit down dinner   If just want place chill relax shoot shit Fireside Lounge good spot   Just aware your location understand anything happen   mean seriously Vegas  <EOR> I absolutely love place  First suggested cousin family 2 years ago suggested boyfriends family past weekend while attended EDC  ate breakfast every morning loved it  Huge servings great tasting food    Tip Mammoth pancakes actually mammoth  HUGE <EOR> I first tried place leaving club drunk hungry asked cab driver really good place eat based recommendation ended here     seen place many times before when vegas decided give try  ambiance restaurant actually pretty cool neon lights late night seem really cool inside out  staff very friendly suggestive type burger should let's just say wasn't disappointed all food really good  Moderate price range  Cab service right outside when need it  short enjoyed experience here! <EOR> Yes another review Peppermill!  Aren't excited!

The neon lighting booth style seats Fireside area feel if you're stepping into world once been  would swear saw Elvis Presley walking through impersonator  I've gone Peppermill all hours day all states intoxication never once treated poorly  always treated rockstar! The girls restaurant side little overwhelmed times because usually slam packed no matter time day go  never expect food delivered quickly because always slam packed! doesn't bother because allows opportunity Fireside enjoy drink  prices drinks versus portions absolutely Fair  However portions food receive enough feed small village New Guinea  prices portions food flavor food seem almost cruel because cheap  If you've never Peppermill then you've never Vegas classic!

Really???  walk restaurant see neon rainbow lights slot machines dogwood trees waitresses dressed skittles colored uniforms   visual entertainment alone enticing enough time time again   Even sugar table rainbow colored   The food portions humongous think if average eater meal split someone both would walk full content   food pretty good wouldn't say best  but again   you're paying experience   prices little bit higher average family restaurant but hey   someone pay electricity  used lighting those colorful neon lights   =0 service always great every time gone   give restaurant side try   However  should decide pass Peppermill Restaurant   DO pass opportunity experience Fireside Lounge   everyone knows but Fireside Lounge actually used scene movie Casino Robert Deniro Sharon Stone   Apparently Deniro hung during filming movie he liked much decided use scene movie   Aside movie trivia attached lounge experience truly unique   would say quite romantic great dates especially first date   If end getting little toasty around fire velvet red couches other areas lounge offer secluded areas private conversation   area pretty dim nightlife feel it   give try!!  take few pictures us!!!

Luckily airport close more food drinks while waiting delayed flight   I totally understand when something wrong kitchen there's miscommunication staff but most instances best thing customer suffer result  If cooked onion rings anyway all imagine maybe they'd rather keep them themselves give them free hungry customer way looked table next  probably happened  imagine they're delicious!

Oh heart breaks heart aches you   end scene  <EOR> Had take town family legendary place but food only mediocre   pretty sure eggs powdered  service also mediocre but super busy Easter morning  those places take people just chance see say they've but really place if youre looking high quality breakfast  <EOR> the food isnt bad all  the reason im reviewing though banana split   OMG  definately best ever had  definately worth $8 95   if youre around part town just need quick desert meal stay away pricey food courts restaurants big casinos   peppermill definately worth it  <EOR> I loved place definitely coming back! lounge very comfortable especially if there's wait seated  Large portions delicious food! <EOR> Convenient parking The wait seated food ridiculous At least huge screens videos around world entertain while wait The food pretty good Coffee very good well The place busy hectic recommend seat bar might feel part whole hussle  <EOR> Bad experience  excited eat Peppermill used love Concord CA  things changed good restaurant   I walked seated counter per request   Although spot cleaned assumed would soon  waitress came longer average wait upon arriving took drink order left give time decide wanted  Five minutes later she returned take order  saw again once food ready she looked spot front look where should put as no came clean counter   said well guess sit over since no going clean sat empty space right  She looked 'deer headlights' look said oh uh sorry   She set food down didn't see again until she breezed drop off check  She time chit chat another patron an obvious regular but see if needed anything like drink refill   Just am ready leave pay she then notices empty glass asks if need refill  The food mediocre but no where near used fries barely luke warm  I paid left low tip but still more should left  spot originally sat never cleared  first last visit here  better service food Denny's        and hate Denny's! <EOR> LOVED place! Great energy good drinks  Even New Years Eve afternoon crowded made good experience  <EOR> It good but didn't meet Yelp great expectations   also really worth loooooong walk there   read someone's review saying just past Wynn but WAY past Wynn anyone walking   fact right before Riviera which pretty far down   That being said food decent   Between 3 ordered Maserati omelet waffle combo Munch's breakfast a special    All pretty good but bit overpriced opinion   Portions huge   service ok bit lackluster   waitress nice enough though   guess I'd come if close but if you're staying Riviera wouldn't extra trip come here  <EOR> Been many times especially big night partying Encore Wynn   Food always spot on  BBQ ribs always winner  <EOR> The Peppermill Vegas tradition! Complete rainbow neon mirrored ceilings  think everyone should dine least once because experience within itself  mean time sat booth right next Jerry Seinfeld George Wallace  tellin' place Vegas landmark   Their menu pretty classic diner menu  Think little higher scaled but high Denny's hamburgers soup salad steak ice cream dessert everything between  All HUGE portions  Including drink menu    recommend trying gawking drink called Scorpion  Overall decent prices decent food   Unfortunately service vary    depends when decide stop in  Some nights seated served smile almost immediately  Other nights left hanging while otherwise quiet restaurant  Regardless push past aspect enjoy yourself  Peppermill open 24 7 great place end up  <EOR> Food tasty Big portions service great  Friendly staff  Nice environment  return  <EOR> We decided pop into Peppermill dinner having cocktails favorite lounges Cosmo  any rate primed ready hearty big portioned meal  Peppermill apparently notoriety that  pleased say didn't disappoint   We enticed Chicken Nachos appetizer  Little did know Chicken Nachos would actually end appetizer dinner  serving size enormous  Huge! Slathered variety melted cheeses topped all usual suspects amazing  loved all accouterments served side bowl re fried beans more melted cheese sour cream salsa hot sauce  nice able control over toppings   Heaven! Bliss! done nachos knew couldn't even consider ordering dinner entree    I'm little disappointed because really excited trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta  It'll wait until another trip sadly    We also ordered margaritas  Honestly seemed watered down  But San Diego very high standards margaritas  such give them pass that    The Peppermill appears eclectic demographic consisting primarily locals at least dinner hour   cab driver confirmed that  douchebags don't typically venture far down strip learned    I would highly recommend place  If you're foodie leave happy food coma  reservations advance avoid wait  glad did  <EOR> Four stars right place is    The only downside always busy but always worth wait    The atmosphere very much Miami Vice type which read another review    I think food 4 star portions big though but always quality nothing but good food good service here  <EOR> If you're looking great breakfast $10 $20 then NEED visit  Always super crowded but good reason  place awesome  prices fair LARGE portions  While most places dwindled down plate sizes place stuck true filling up  big eater never left without to go box  <EOR> This first time here  place wonderful unique atmosphere  food very good bit mistake reservation but staff very friendly worked quickly fix problem  <EOR> Hmmmm   I've tried Fireside Lounge twice now   just   don't   get it     Why place popular?    Is decor very faded cigarette burned booths?  plastic fake trees?  smoke so thick you can slice it air?  aggravating eye soar pink lights?  It definitely isn't drinks   friend's Jack Coke pretty much just Coke   chocolate chip cookie martini wasn't anything special something couldn't find TGIFridays   I just don't hype place   Sorry  <EOR> Great place cool off during day  Didn't try food just drink lounge  Wide selection food drinks  <EOR> I've more dozen times can't remember trip Vegas where didn't Pepper Mill least once if twice   The decor think 1970's airport lounge Its very retro fun casual   There always wait if don't appreciate over yourself somewhere else    It always seems madhouse wait staff always busy  patient    I've never felt rushed nor ever sent food back any reason  but don't generally anyhow  The portions HUGE  only issue place sister actually asked them if could give 1 2 portion TEN EGG OMELET she'd pay full price she just didn't want waste food told no won't cut portions even if your paying full price  I read bunch reviews before writing mine    Some complaints really unfounded dimensional Whats about? Someone else said over priced serious? Apparently didn't eat same place  food very reasonably priced can't ever finish order   The only thing don't like? Sausage gravy but  personal preference guy really likes it   The spicy bloody mary's DIE FOR! recommend going getting fire side lounge taste better when bartender them rather cocktail waitress ordering them en mass  bartender asks kind vodka spicy if wanted salt where cocktail waitress just asks if want spicy not  <EOR> Super cool place  Awesome decor  Fireside Lounge amazing!
