Went Saturday afternoon groupon  played golf but never ate ate club house  Overall would say place good  sat right away ordered  pasta fagioli Italian beef sandwich  Both quite delicious Italian beef nice black peppery flavor  wife veggie wrap which she liked Mother in Law said Turkey wrap also good    Prices reasonable some nice views course  bad place eat if area  <EOR> Great service great bartenders beer tap extensive  Fantastic views! Love place! <EOR> I am writing review regards place is  essentially nicest golf course community kitchen restaurant ever experienced  clubhouse very nice staff amazing although never actually dined clubhouse just ordered delivery  currently live Rhodes Ranch all battles HOA aside place typically outdoes itself most items menu    I've only ordered them twice  But     Delivery FREE residents Rhodes Ranch deliver all day until 10 pm   and here's kicker golf course cart girls deliveries if never seen them let just say easy eyes   The first time ordered Philly  decent but amazing just because failed properly slice steak little tough  The second time Patty melt  would definitely order again  Fresh toasted rye patty perfect came side shoestring style fries  $8 99 $8 49 But place no ordinary club house sandwich kitchen  sampled entrees ordered roommates build your own pizza chicken parmesan   You even bucket steamed little neck clams  You steak eggs glass OJ coffee delivered your door first thing morning $14  The food priced neighborhood applebee's but far exceeding quality quantity  I'm saying 5 star dining but when consider Free delivery huge selection items coming golf course kitchen pretty amazing  never elite golf course lunch dinner when play courses usually stick dog beer turn  But if playing Rhodes extra time grab something 9 18  won't regret it  <EOR> I ate two times first time last time   Walking seeing only three other tables occupied being greeted seated promptly really good start    It's also annoying wait nearly 10 minutes your server greet bring menus   A taco salad does consist greasy shredded steak you'd find Philly Cheesesteak mixed salad greens sweet dressing greasy taco shell   When said taco salad pointed being taco salad having waitress try tell didn't read menu right  comes laughable seeing though menu described having ground beef pico de gallo sour cream black beans guacamole   The only saving grace only paid $4 99 joke taco salad Happy Hour   Yes still ended paying it     It may Rhodes Ranch but even Taco Bell better taco salad   Thanks but no thanks! <EOR> Oooo boy!!! Yelp describes Italian Restaurant Italian       Rhodes Ranch once jewel residential community's Las Vegas  Situated southwest part town along cross streets South Durango West Robindale Roads   When arriving sure your guest list someone lives within community if your attached event passed gate  Pretty much Nightclub rules housing community   So business right next Golf Club Driving Range Club House  hard find! If  find driving range you'll find restaurant    After hanging another yelper NDS little water park decided grab some lunch here  only reason 2 stars views patio amazing!!!! Watching driving range mountains simply fantastic  Now sitting down greeted server explained fly she would grab some menus  20mins later walking grabbing them ourselves  realizing grabbed own menus server took order  ordering just couple items $5 happy hour menu food order took good 30 minutes come out  server said she slammed but looked around just saw few people drinking beer driving balls all day  ended changing orders didn't live RR drove home nice cold meal   With expensive upper class community would think place doesn't any real competition inside RR would think maybe would better standard say Taco Bell Burger King  But sorry say isn't  least places handle staffing standard   Maybe wrong maybe stands expected place need take photograph number plate drove would better   Overall Food 1 5 Drink 3 5 beer Service 1 5 Come back no <EOR> I never given opportunity eat because even though bar full decided close kitchen earlier posted hours web site    I love Rhodes Ranch decided walk take daughter walk home  convenience looking forward while    Epic fail RRGC! <EOR> My friends wedding which great because BF lives community took all 3 minutes drive haha actually very BEAUTIFUL wedding!!! sun perfectly setting behind them golf course said vows  ceremony all inside club house where completely transformed it! purple lighting nice well little dance floor  friends even rented photo booth fun that  also set all pretty banquet tables chairs balcony but pretty chilly night  wish more heating lamps! bartender handled all thirsty guests well give props especially since open bar    I think service really weird definitely lack communication  little buffet line set corner some colossal shrimp cocktail bruschetta  shrimp HUGE delicious! also some items heated serving trays  Some older people hungry served actual dinner well which prime rib potatoes veggies  Pretty soon saw lots people enjoying dinner portion starving some well but then another server came yelled server carving prime rib saying wasn't dinner time yet  Anyways he turn away everyone waiting line course upset most people  unorganized! Then tables server came around just once fill water glasses gave tiniest bit champagne    So weddings food atmosphere great!!! think just need work communication organization staff    ALSO came once before enjoy happy hour which advertised website  called ahead confirm said yes honor Happy Hour  friends before server said NO don't HH  WTF  told them tell called ahead confirm   ended approving HH us   but again WTF    lack communication part  <EOR> Ordered take out    wrong sandwich given hair ranch dressing!!! Disgusting! Would recommend! would think being Rhoded Ranch would some kind quality assurance    obviously yuck! <EOR> We live neighborhood amazing amenity somewhere within community  service menu  menu nothing speak but relax enjoy view  Yes    Sometimes very slow but most times servers always taken care us  relaxing sit away all noise  definitely think F B director should clean menu offer some better choices but kind restaurant  Maybe if more residents showed interest then could find reason so    Either way if live here  If want nice meal take yourself restaurant somewhere else  more chill drink beer type place  views outstanding worth it  <EOR> The hubz stopped afternoon check out   AWHILE before bartender surfaced but when she did she fun energetic full good drink ideas   didn't try any food can't comment but did good time back!  husband recommends apple cider beer shot fireball  <EOR> We live community gone few times  menu nothing write home food mediocre service varies couple amazing waitresses never seen waiter more very unpleasant ones feel imposition deliver your food which takes forever never come back  Then unless you're lucky few good servers then you'll hail your waitress check if hailing taxi during rainstorm NYC  <EOR>
