All came just over 42 bucks <EOR> I expected better Emeril's restaurant  gumbo jambalaya both appetizers so so  <EOR> Emeril Lagasse's Cajun specialty restaurant Emeril's New Orleans Fish House located famous MGM Grand Hotel Casino  Emeril Lagasse American celebrity chef whose specialty includes Cajun Creole French  did mention he also James Beard Award winner semi regular appearances Bravo's Top Chef? Now know why came here   For starter Maine Lobster Bisque Gumbo  decision order Gumbo self explanatory  Cajun restaurant all  found gumbo bit salty bit peppery although boyfriend really enjoyed it  ordered lobster bisque because well favourite dishes all time  thoroughly enjoyed lobster bisque fantastic lobster flavours    briny savoury  perfect consistency thick thin  However little white clumps throughout bisque likely undissolved corn starch flour whatever used thicken bisque  also could put few more chunks lobster    okay understand lobsters don't grow trees now? Despite flour clumps lack chunky lobsters bisque excellent  would order again heartbeat   For main course Crystal Fried Shrimp Po Boy Emeril's Barbecued Shrimp  found both dishes salty side  Unfortunately Shrimp Po Boy which looking forward turned disappointment  saltiness covered all other flavours   ideal  upside portion sizes humongous  Come empty tummy!

Flippant attitudes need apply   For $130 each drink   I would prefered anywhere else less   used huge fan honestly say never back    I don't end reviews bad note say decor rich modern loved wine display cases   inspiring option own place  <EOR> We group 6 all ordered different dishes   many other Emeril's restaurants always enjoyed typical Emeril's fare   no different bbq shrimp gumbo calamari gratin seafood stew did disappoint    I gave 3 stars time 2 specific reasons service slow seemed disinterested maybe because did order any wine?  More important ordered bread pudding which all consider Emeril's signature dessert  served anything but  Dont know if ran half baked soggy pasty no where near before  No clear explanation provided mattered  Disappointed respect  <EOR> Excellent service  Scallops amazing  Red fish good little dry side but would definitely again  <EOR> Good experience here! Wednesday evening wasn't busy all  Thought may sign come but most certainly not  restaurant $25 corkage fee which though reasonable more accommodating champagne  interior cool bar area some neat decor overall pretty inviting atmosphere    Highlight night Michael server  Great guy great recommendations genuinely good dude! Chat if given opportunity he's some tales tell!  Overall food good  sashimi grade scallops done perfection literally melted your mouth  going crab cakes but Michael recommended scallops    glad he did! delicious  Then BBQed salmon some white sauce shrimp pasta dish can't remember name moment    salmon done perfectly prawns pasta smothered garlic overwhelming nauseatingly delicious depends much garlic! andouille sausage potato hash great    only problem onion rings came salmon  over seasoned difficult enjoy them other components dish  Granted southerners tend season little more liberally others    stereotype? don't know watching some TV shows southern food think probably true! Regardless happy meals   Second highlight night banana cream pie!!!!! If you're doesn't sound all appetizing  Until see it!! Man dessert    tasty debated seconds 10 minutes! <EOR> Terrificly delicious food   Good service   Very enjoyable atmosphere dinner friends   terrific meal   read some negative reviews before going but found everything very good am glad chose there  <EOR> Tried lunch hubby vegas  noticed right away friendly staff  He ordered fried oysters best fried oyster ever tasted  Then super fresh sea bass     fish itself good already but could've better  dessert guy suggested banana cream pie omg he right  husband likes too!!! light sweet lots banana  coming back dessert sure when visit Vegas again  fact ordered another take back hotel room    Boy good!  Mr  Lagasse hands down your pie bam! <EOR> I think Emeril only invests expertise main dishes    Normally rate courses whole experience  But joint's case all seem different levels  appetizer tuna tacos ran $17  pretty good know doesn't seem much but $15 would much better price  Fairly uncomplicated flavors you're really just paying quality fish   The main courses ordered sea bass garlic polenta baked clams    which both phenomenal  dished shoot rating 3 stars   Dessert some kind turtle cheesecake small tasteless dull  guess figure main dishes why spend extra overhead dessert items? fair haven't tried rest desserts but really mess cheesecake? <EOR> Excellent meal beginning end  Gumbo comes fresh pot placed your bowl tableside  Sweet barbecue salmon crab stuffed shrimp delicious  even decant your bottle wine! Service wonderful well  <EOR> Service slow drinks expensive quality ingredients poor  used cheap canned blue cheese olives  Oysters tasted funny  elsewhere  <EOR> I took family Emeril's mother law's 70th birthday she Louisania native  Throughout dinner service good atmosphere very nice  had  Three appetizers frog legs BBQ shrimp alligator meatballs  All good but alligator meatballs tasted any other meatball  would skip future try something different  sweet corn bisque excellent salad good  main courses Texas red fish scallops special which fish clams all good   only negative clams overlooked fish caused them lose flavor  sides ordered sweet potatoes garden vegetables  Good flavor good size   dessert taste New Orleans trio pecan pie sorbet  All good  <EOR> Nice gem hiddeninside MGM  cant say enough good things food staff  steak perfectly cooked country smashed potatoes top off excellently  clam chowder also  <EOR> Went happy hour  4 large shrimp cajun BBQ sauce  Snack size bowls delicious gumbo  Nice  Because ambience quite fine dining but plenty nice gave 4 stars  <EOR> Fake blue cheese stuffed olives food service  Dirty plate sat front 10 minutes so  think waiter felt bus boy's job remove plate his  Wife asked steak cooked minute longer came back 15 minutes later  think Emerill would pi$$ed if he watching action night  He probably would gone Gordon Ramsey them  <EOR> Our first time Emeril's restaurant  very please salads salmon ordered  Everything fresh portions large  Only disappointment  rolls  Couldn't better?

Loved food Emeril's barbecue salmon andoulle hash   husband grilled chicken   Both dinners awesome!

Every time visit happy food service    Advice DO TASTING MENU! Get wine pairing it!  Our entire table always does tasting menu ordering simple fun  never leave hungry unsatisfied courses spread enough time converse enjoy your company between    Some might say tasting menu wine pairing pricy say worth money considering number courses wines getting  <EOR> I love Emeril's properties start admitting am little biased  definitely enjoyed meal usual atmosphere consistent expected   downside location VERY confusing  However restaurant's fault but design MGM   wine list extensive bit overwhelming but servers great suggesting pairings your meal   Overall loved time there   but again   I'm huge fan! and never disappointed <EOR> Great! Great service great food nice atmosphere  Food little pricey but well worth it  Nola peach tea bomb if you're down bourbon  Very exquisite gumbo! <EOR> My friend wanted try two celebrity chef restaurants them   The restaurant upscale contemporary decor   servers friendly attentive informative   For appetizer tried raw oysters   can't remember which ones exactly but waiter said plumper   say raw oysters delicious   clean tasting almost refreshing   wish more four plate because wanted keep eating   For entree friend shared two dishes   BBQ Salmon Pan Roasted Gulf Flounder   Both very well cooked   salmon bolder flavors while flounder milder flavor but richer sauce   almost rich me   also order side Asparagus Roasted Paquillo Peppers Goat Cheese which perfectly cooked   While enjoyed all things order none really stood super spectacular   guess high expectations Emeril Lagasse wow he sort didn't   best thing night two raw oysters ate     Perhaps didn't choose best dishes perhaps restaurant pushed flavors limit   sure   would still recommend restaurant though if looking solid menu impress date  <EOR> NOT FAN   only refrained giving one star because Ahi Tuna probably prettiest dishes seen take look pic NOW haha Luckily didn't super high expectations but can't imagine standing many other restaurants within 20 feet walking distance   ordered Crusted Ahi Tuna Pecan Crusted Redfish   Appearance awesome!  Ahi Tuna's taste alright just didn't enjoy Redfish   understand tastes types food differ many spot but complaints come service   Problem number two waiters through night which already confusing   Maybe game plan confused each asked doing once during dinner   asked within minute each other immediately received food before started eating   Awesome   Problem number two possibly related young look or maybe looking into much    waiter dropped off menu when he seated us   meal he didn't ask if wanted dessert dropped off check   Now normally wouldn't bother much   started getting pissed when same waiter the gave menu seated older couple right next us   He proceeded give detailed explanation specialty dishes recommendations well explaining option pricey prix fixe tasting menu   saying would ordered differently if did speel but still    give regardless!  Also peeking around all desserts passing drool    but opportunity order anyways   I felt pretty neglected we all just need some love right? especially restaurant wasn't even half full   only instances walked complained directly host   He seemed very sincere which nice   but didn't offer give them another chance if know mean <EOR> Had seared scallops black eyed pea succotash bacon creamed corn   it delish!! tad salty would expect such savory dish but would totally again  Service great too    we alerted server we sat bar hurry see show he stayed top it  <EOR> This place pricey but hey we're Vegas goodness sakes! Located MGM grand which very nice hotel  decor very nice Emerils  visited lunch   What had Fish house cevich Sweet Barbecued Chicken Wild Shrimp Etouffée  food amazing   The staff very attentive very helpful questions  <EOR> Worst  Place ever! Expensive worth it    I Roasted Garlic Herb Gnocchi Grilled Vegetable Ratatouille Pecorino Romano Cheese Basil Pesto Passata $26   I didn't eat because disgusting  no taste wanted give back  Everyone table tried agreed terrible dish    Customer Service wasn't great either  No once asked doing if needed anything  If spent much time talking did folding napkins every time probably would gotten higher rating  <EOR> SUCH DISAPPOINTMENT!!     Whatever order Seafood Pan Sear!! Although recommended waiter smallest tasteless most depressing looking plate ever seen life   just small portion because fancy restaurant just pathetic   two little shrimps 4 table spoons Jambalaya which okay best   topped little flat dry piece fish     If decide crab boil 18 times bigger pan sear $6 more   NOLO Peach Iced Tea amazing! <EOR> A few dishes warrant three stars but majority?

No? Eat here! Cutting through meat cutting through butter must why give butter knives   I'd definitely order dish again    I also chance try Herb Roasted Chicken Breast $28 if could order over I'd choose chicken  fact such experience short rib I'd still choose chicken over should tell excellent was  wasn't even taste amazed it super delicious but well chicken cooked  If knew you'd know chicken breast always over cooked but  case here    For third course chose much praised Banana Cream Pie  hyped I'd say bit disappointed  But let explain    I don't cold food desserts  felt if topped hot fudge would've okay instant death meal  Haha! caramel drizzled over but couldn't taste fan super crunchy crust   But all personal preference may love all this    Service par food which nice surprise found good food bad service vice versa  seated immediately checked numerous times waiters there's team 3 per table very friendly    5 stars because all all I'd definitely eat again again  Well worth money time took find huge MGM Grand  <EOR> Emeril's catchphrase may Bam!     but New Orleans Fish House's catchphrase more accurately SCAM'  going complain price considering everything overpriced Vegas  poor quality food stood its own reason left dissatisfied  some shrimp biscuit starter just looked graded when came out  looked something Beetlejuice murky macabre sauce squirted all over some overcooked shrimp   biscuit pasty some reason well    Next drinks  ordered some tropical drink room temperature reminded bloody marry  Didn't see coming   coworker ordered Boulevardier cranberry vodka vibe it  Maybe Emeril wizard all    The entrees bit better but still underwhelming  Pecan Encrusted fish more fish fillet some coarse soggy nut crunch slapped top  Encursted implies theres some crunch its least somehow affixed base ingredient  But know?

flavors didn't disappoint  However service although staff very friendly quite slow during non peak hour    We around 3 30pm late lunch just few tables occupied  waiter greeted some complimentary cornbread which best ever eaten! needed couple more minutes peruse menu but quite some time before waiter returned  Then took 30 minutes ordered before food arrived  might seem terribly long time but table ordered received food first  If gone closer dinner time would risk missing show    On bright side enjoyed entrees!  ordered Lobster Roll labeled special served side creamy crunchy slaw house made potato chips  lobster fresh flavorful enhanced tarragon spiced sauce  served inside lightly toasted fluffy brioche bun  loved sides slaw chips each own savory touches  portion reasonable lunch but filling    **TIP** If there's entree both lunch dinner menu quite bit cheaper during lunch  Just keep mind lunch portions likely smaller  example Lobster Roll lunch menu $24 but over $30 dinner menu  sure dinner version contained more lobster but glad save few bucks otherwise same dish  <EOR> Only 4 stars because desserts could better  ordered 3 desserts none them really die good  Beignets powdered sugar Banana Cream pie sorbets  Otherwise would've rated 5 stars  love food service  come most time we're Vegas    We Crabcakes starters Fettuccini Alfredo Blue Shrimp special order son normally comes angel hair pasta tomato butter sauce Grilled Prime Beef Ribeye daughter Reserved Pork Chop husband mashed potatoes share  Everything cooked perfection ordered it  delicious!

The second thing happens enjoy food service much! ordered many things menu including raw stuff various fish dishes now could just close eyes point know would good  It great eat before any concert MGM Grand Garden decor beautiful really pretty open bar glass partition main walkway studio walk  suggest any night week!! <EOR> Everything super fresh super delicious  Servers bit talkative preference  All enjoyed restaurant  <EOR> If ever restaurant riding owners name clearly owner restaurant very long time The service disjointed disastrous  wife both Martini which arrived two different size glasses when pointed two waiters he argued finally dropped matter  Yes two waiters constantly badgered order  bottle white wine ordered arrived cooled wait while found wine bucket ice which then kept station  fish wife pork loin which excellent but wife's side dish potatoes arrived cold sent back   The service put serious damper visit back any Emeril's restaurants <EOR> 1st night vegas crew emeril's     wasnt into idea first because     well hes tv  would take away half star review because ordered irish car bomb bar weakest irish car bomb ive ever had  should known better maybe    suppose bar kind activities     anyways going back restaurant  service very helpful very nice very beginning  dont know everyone but didnt hold on  some people ordered soup salad starters     i glass scotch rocks  then ordered grilled salmon  delicious  think marinate sauce pineapple it  texture perfect! veggies very tasty well  tried friends red fish delicious too  everyone very attentive even though last table restaurant  7 ate well some appetizers seven entrees some dessert some coffee some beers some wine some sparkling water  check? $400  not bad considering everything impeccable  <EOR> I came eat last night family final night Las Vegas    Needless say made right choice   Though steady inside restaurant seated instantly  sat down table hostess set linen cloths laps us   Cool! thought awesome!   Our waitress very kind attentive she answered all questions  She also quite informative all small details such ingredients tastes best most importantly she very knowledgeable menu  did catch name but she layered brown hair side bangs  Terrific service!  The basket bread die  ate probably around 5 rolls before main dish  good!   I ordered shrimp creole  contained plentiful amount shrimp along grits amazing!! beans delicious tomato sauce  loved ordered savored every last bite   My brother mom enjoyed meals too  Sadly three stuffed order dessert sure Emeril's dessert menu die for  gotten dessert most likely would given restaurant full five stars   We returning restaurant next time town  <EOR> Ate lunch impressed   po boy very good mostly bread very little shrimp $14 weak tumbler glass margarita Dads salmon lacking seasoning high price end   Hopefully dinner service better but never eat again  <EOR> While walking through MGM strip friend stopped quick lunch  clam chowder gumbo  Both lukewarm bland bowl hotter then soup inside  Also price bit expensive both but Vegas overlooked that  best thing? pretzel roll sourdough cheese roll yum! extra star alone  <EOR> Shrimp PoBoy great reasonaby priced but sevice far less stellar  expected little more hospitality  told could sit counter bar when plenty open tables  virtually ignored gentlemen later sat down next two us  Perhaps save true service dinner crowd  <EOR> This best cooked Filet mignon ever had  service fantastic ambiance just right  If ever MGM Grand Las Vegas highly recommend it  <EOR> Didn't around eating Emeril's while New Orleans but super stoked hear located MGM  food exceptional however although service attentive server droned almost 3 minutes menu instead just letting decide wanted order  don't necessarily need very lengthy oral presentation food rather would just order food enjoy peace  If wasn't theatrics server came off fake would given Emeril's five star  pecan pie dessert absolutely die for! <EOR> Came group friends Friday around 7pm   restaurant packed   The service ok   Everyone friendly but service kinda slow     Since hungry just Apple Lettuce salad Clam Chowder   The salad good   Very fresh   portion ok but soup kinda small   soup thick creamy but much clam   My friend ordered Halibut   $40 but portion very small   tried fish taste bland   much flavors   Overall very standard restaurant Vegas       Come back??  Probably because more better good restaurants Vegas! <EOR> I came lunch since staying Signature   expected better Emeril's   Po Boy sandwich just okay   I expected banana cream pie good but bit disappointed  <EOR> i think finally learned putting chef's name restaurant does equate amazing food    Emeril's New Orleans Fish House impeccable service  first thing server asked whether any time constraints  She definitely worked help Blue Man Group time    The food decent  basically shared everything try bunch stuff  food mix hit miss  favorite appetizer Crab bake  savory but hint sweetness  Add lovely concoction toasted bread you've winner! favorite entree Sea bass  least favorite appetizer fried oysters  wasn't anything special it  least favorite entree swordfish  sure if just natural texture swordfish dry but meat dry no accompanying sauce help out  Definite miss  No time try dessert = Overall good experience but fantastic would imagined  find original  <EOR> Yummmmmm  Started hearts romain Caesar salad  Very different dressing but VERY good!!! Had salmon andouille sausage chipped under it  sauce amazing  side ordered Macaroni Cheese      Served huge casserole dish   Fresh oven!!  surprise bacon it   think may best Mac cheeses had   No desert     Way full!!! But when saw piece if banana cream pie very tempted Good service <EOR> Horrible wait staff mediocre food tainting review  MGM work conference group stopped lunch  very empty but would thought slammed furious 8 top table didn't reservations  then seated waiter asks drink orders  He very irritated none ordered alcohol  specific quote 8 adults all waters 2 iced teas? Really people start acting your age  said joking tone made several group very agitated  Then he commented fact all ordered lunch menu did want any appetizers all really watching purse strings huh?   angry time food came did mention took forever?? could wait leave  would definitely never recommend nor would return  <EOR> I came conference which MGM  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie  It good pricey  good desert but little rich  treat yourself once awhile  ordered bar took sometime it  <EOR> This trip marked second time eating here   Similar first experience food fantastic service exceptional   time came another couple friend shared entrees could try variety dishes had   During 2nd visit decided order frog legs first time all four tried frog legs   Honestly no expectations dish time since wasn't feeling well   When first saw thought shrimp tempura took while figure actually frog legs   tasted pretty yummy meat very tender!  During meal noticed staff changed used utensils plates each course ate   also very kind observant gave extra small plates since seemed know sharing food   Also staff provided complementary blackberry something sorbet help celebrate husband's birthday!  extremely nice them!  Plus good!!!!  perfect finish lunch meal!  Korean Elvis' turn Yes food service superb last time dined two years earlier  Also yes frog legs choice since wanted food might authentically Cajun    The food delicious before  gumbo steak dish fish dish yes frog legs  history eating celebrity chefs' restaurants always hit miss  example eating Mario Batali's Carnevino awesome while Wolfgang Puck's restaurants Hawaii total waste money expectations  However place all restaurants Vegas    As wife said changed utensils before every course  called pre bussing only seen done less handful restaurants Hawaii Morton's among few others  shows level service which met restaurants  day birthday restaurant provided sorbet commemorate! going above beyond expected place!  If you're looking great service doesn't break Vegas budget much great Cajun food wholeheartedly suggest eatery MGM  Happy yelping everyone! <EOR> I salmon entree amazing  Never salmon cooked way before! Loved ambiance well  <EOR> Delicious good atmosphere  Someone below said small portions ? Well he probably ordered small because husband huge portions! place expensive really typical restaurant  service good food fresh taste great! would recommend place any one  <EOR> Went Emeril's liked quite bit  little pricy but Vegas    Had New Orleans BBQ Shrimp Texas Red Fish grits  enjoyed both tremendously  also banana bread pudding awesome   co workers all also seemed pleased  back!  Five stars both Emeril joints lucky enough try Vegas  <EOR> Although pricey thought worth it   had Asian Pear Butter Lettuce Salad excellent Lobster Bisque excellent Pork Shoulder Andoulie Sausage excellent Ettoufee excellent Baked BBQ Salmon cooked nicely light bbq sauce 6 year old mac cheese no ham very good  Overall excellent experience which why surprised poor ratings   food good service great   Now Monday night although plenty patrons staff overwhelmed     As previously noted did way mention could whip anything 6 year old   Nice touch   Although pricier side vacation great time  <EOR> Happy Hour meal included French 75 excellent cocktail gin citrus champagne Shrimp okra andouille sausage gumbo excellent very peppery Alligator meatballs decent but unexpected light flavor   tasted heavily sauteed peppers tomatoes     TV difficult see bar really anywhere restaurant   Servers seemed disinterested     Worth coming excellent gumbo $8 bowl during happy hour  <EOR> We four course menu no joke amazing! beer salad BBQ shrimp grilled chicken banana cream pie   BOMB! Plus best service ever super attentive overall just nice people  hard Celebrity restaurants always feel pay name but Emeril did great!   Cucumber cocktail= Yass! <EOR> As Brits say gobsmacked bad service presentation food actually lunch time  saw food delivered kitchen sitting tray least 10 minutes  Needless say food warm hot  expected more but sadly mistaken  Let's just say won't coming back here  would saved myself lot coin if gone nearby food court  <EOR> I always stop place when stay MGM  Especially lunch  Everything menu usually really great  service always point time Emeril walking around signing autographs stuff  Thats Vegas you  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised place  food definitely different used but very good  fries made crayfish polenta incredibly light steak awesome banana cream pie spectacular  written off cream pies but took them off blacklist  end lunch maybe service more attentive then normal  Overall just great place meal  Curiously really doubt would Emeril's if back home but good know semi nice place Vegas  <EOR> First time dining very excited  ordered steak exciting try food  Unfortunately when steak arrived long hair plate asked waiter double check plate he took plate back  lost appetite this  reason giving 2 stars wife enjoyed Red Fish  BTW still paid full meal  Just check ur plate before u dig   sure if took bite hair mouth would ended differently  <EOR> A great place great  happy hour!

Reason #1 uncle called last minute tell 2 more people coming adjust reservation 10 12   said no problem   still wait maybe 15 minutes passed reservation time since wait party before finish dinner which big problem   Reason #2 server nice don't remember name pretty much everything came timely manner   If anything entrees took little bit longer drinks appetizers   Reason #3 bread basket desserts food really good!  bread basket consisted pretzel rolls onion rolls both warm soft oh so yummy   gumbo $14 clam chowder $13 good apple butter lettuce salad $13 small needed more flavor though   BBQ'd Atlantic salmon $34 tasty even petite mom ordered same thing finished entire plate   Hubby's rib eye steak $49 big juicy mac cheese $12 creamy cheesy   BTW no kid's menu obviously older clam chowder side basil spinach fettuccine $9 little just side mac cheese fine that   my little ended eating half salmon anyways more mac cheese me!    Although all stuffed really wanted try bread pudding I LOOOVE bread pudding ordered $11 older fruit sorbet $6    Holy Creoley ba dum tsss best bread pudding ever tasted!  More soaked moist used looked kind oatmeal but warm hint whiskey very very subtle    ohhh yeahhh   fruit sorbet came three scoops was expecting just one flavor mild smooth   homemade sure tasted 9  The prices definitely proportionate amount but rather proportionate taste?  Maybe group came good day something but all certainly left happy bellies  <EOR> The food good great price  really enjoyed Reddish portions ample  Ambience unique we'll appointed  Gumbo bit spicy good flavor  <EOR> My family decided check Emeril's night during stay awful decision  restaurant practically empty yet felt extremely rushed wait staff  ordered bourbon smash menu waiter said don't those  kindly pointed menu he told Oh  Well see do  dinner arrived before drinks    Dad's jambalaya cold Mother's fish undercooked rubbery mention did put sauce side  chicken came salad charred dry  When drinks finally arrived watered down  bourbon smash some odd colored mix mint lime juice  quality service food drinks absolutely unacceptable price  We'd done much better if just eaten food court  <EOR> Took parents early Father's Day dinner loved it     We started Fish House Seafood platter   fresh oysters shrimp scallop cerviche king crab tasted very sweet     For first course clam chowder Wow! bests Vegas I always order clam chowder compare others ceasar salad which enjoyed   dressing nice light   For main course father Emeril's signature dishes Seafood Pan Roast   shrimp muscles andouille sausage top perfectly spiced rice   all tried loved it   I blue crab crabcakes heavenly   Lightly seasoned beautiful sauce only enough enjoy  sweet blue crab taste   My mother tasty Rib Eye smoothest most delicious red potato mash   tasting enjoying each other's entrees very much   Lastly topped night off Taste New Orleans dessert sample which smaller samplings  Southern Pecan Pie Bread Butter Bread Pudding Creamy Banana Pie   polished off plate!

Apparently chef day also doing take boss's style   Emeril tv entertainer behind fancy little kitchen studio    studio kitchen?  Anywayz he people laugh unlike Bobby Flay don't find sickening annoying   But honestly don't see chef   mean many gazillion dishes put same bloody seasoning on?!      To start shrimp remoulade salad nothing special   wish they'd given some extra remoulade sauce side    barely enough taste however little tasted made want more bloody thing don't give more sauce want course!  good but could far better   husband blue crab bell pepper fondue he loved said very well executed whatever means   Think he's also watching much Top Chef seafood gumbo share yes being complete pigs!  Shit being comped $100 casino meal don't think going coy take full advantage    surprisingly gumbo very tasty!  share bad gumbo even New Orleans! must say nicely impressed     For entrees seafood pan roast jambalaya fish special day striped bass corn macque choux   Both jambalaya corn macque choux absolutely delicious   fish both dishes omg way salty!     so butter sauce pan roast   Insane!

Five minutes previous he said if other patrons OK then he would change it   now wait manager approve? thought restaurants all hospitality seeing business contingent upon patrons happiness satisfaction  clear dinner experience going this      So did dance twenty minutes until asked wanted order    He gnocchi ordered Sea Bass    I inquired ingredient Sea Bass wasn't familiar instead telling he didn't know bartender made some lame answer ingredient  He told something crustini   no trained chef but know way around kitchen good concept tastes ingredients  being satisfied answer googled low behold NOTHING crustini but ingredient included pork    huh? servers place know anything food? wasted disappointment  unfortunately can't agree Banana Cream Pie either    bake sale banana cream pie would've comparable    Worst service experienced very long time  housed great MGM Grand would've expected better  think would've better experience food court    The food passable     not good   not great definitely would've expected Emeril  going waste more time energy going continued rant but say every minute sat Emeril's establishment waste life    The BFF's two cents experience?

My pork HUGE   HUGE flavorful could be   service adequate   I guess  <EOR> Had 4 course tasting menu  Worst meal ever amount money  4 people $400 tab  Horrible  Horrible  Horrible  Also ordered Lychee Martini DAMN! drink really really strong! Wonder why? Because ALL lychee vodka freakin' martini glass  serious? really 3 straight lychee flavored vodka shots fancy little martini glass  worth money  If you're going come don't waste your money tasting menu    save steak something else fill your tummy  least you'll come full  Won't coming back again     <EOR> Another day another business dinner  time Emeril's pick  Despite reading bunch Yelp reviews hoping experience would somehow different majority  wasn't    Let's start good note service bit overbearing but otherwise great  4 5 stars Entrees WOW can't believe freaking awful were  price point which btw prices gone compared website!! really should much better   Sea bass lobster $42 wrong? Well somehow Emeril very wrong pricey dish  First impression plate VERY white just little bit puke green  Imagine white mushy flavorless potato cake swimming small sea nasty pukeish green chile sauce topped tiny 4 oz piece white sea bass tiny 2 oz piece rubbery lobster  White mushy fish white mushy potatoes? idiot thought pairing would work?? components didn't work dish executed poorly  Honestly no redeeming qualities hella expensive $42 dish   Ahi Tuna special off menu sure price Yes tuna damn good but swimming sea TOMATO SAUCE sausage ravioli? Seriously chefs crack? Red tuna + acidic red tomatoes = no bueno    Sorry philosophically think well thought entree should represent BALANCE  Red tuna + red sauce? White fish + white potatoes ? Aesthetically texture basis dishes epic fails  tasted ok but $40++ plate should taste way more ok    Alright now you're wondering why 3 stars instead 1 2?? desserts f ing AMAZING  Please follow advice several other yelpers only come dessert  beignets bread pudding banana cream pie all spectacular  Emeril really does best banana cream pie entire world worth trip bar slice yourself! <EOR> My girls lunch bachelorette bash!

My friends all loved ordered  While really liked apple butter lettuce salad asked thought wasn't worth price paid portion size dish  But isn't important because goal coming try butter bread pudding aim did  bread pudding came very small portion first thought strange since eyeing enormous size banana cream pie slice almost freaked big was  However think bread pudding meant savored little chunks time savored did!!! Oh man warm buttery just right amount sweetness  literally felt spike happiness while eating dessert  Apparently Emeril Lagasse knows bread pudding pro well!   In distant future come back bread pudding work off calories amassed tonight course  <EOR> WOW!

Emeril Rachel Ray really opened eyes culinary arts  admire Emeril regardless  only thing say shrimp okay  Very unique flavor  different kind barbecue flavor  Great drink wine selection  wanted try more stuff but King Crab places go  almost unfair review place off dish  But definitely back try some more dishes  <EOR> What wonderful experience! came early dinner before cirque du soleil show experience wonderful starter wonderful night  Mr  began meal Rock Shrimp ceviche well Lobster Bisque  Both very tasty  Lobster Bisque very creamy although enjoyed Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak more   ceviche spicy side a very good kick   Mr  ordered seabass which ok  He fan but ended eating most wonderful entree  ordered bbq salmon  OMG! freaken delicious bbq sauce delicate no way resemble ordinary stuff usually super sweet   definitely come back because food just darn delicious  Well salmon dish very very good  <EOR> The only reason put 4 stars below    The food pricey leave starving which shame  place pretentious beyond belief  instance when order clam chowder bring mini pot serve another bowl  enough clam chowder bowl serve infant mouse    The Steak Sandwhich roll cold really worth it    I also steak board which really screams just put plate give me    The reason come reason  Banana Creme Pie  Let's thing straight  no sweet tooth whatsoever  could care less if ever ate chocolate again  thing simply amazing  graham cracker crust key thing brilliant    If would Emeril's Delmonico's instead  Pretentious but better menu options  course still BCP  <EOR> We dined night  Service very good  Staff attentive helpful  Food good prices reasonable Vegas standards  Location decor ok  <EOR> I really good experience would definitely come back  must say service quite spotty though  waiter almost rude didn't give very good recommendations when came wine  He would also come clear plates while people would mid conversation just butting rather waiting person finish most well trained waiters nice establishments should do  food more made though  Although menu indeed very extensive thought everything tried delicious  came fairly large group since none could decision wanted order decided just order bunch things share them  isn't really family style type place but worked just fine all us     although waiter rude huffing under breath won't enough food   He clearly wanted each order three courses drop more money  He also visibily irritated when didn't order multiple bottles wine  Anyway back food appetizers ordered braised short rib beef ravioli which awesome  came top bed celery root puree which really great flavor  also fried calamari pepperoncini tomato cucumber salad really great spicy kick also salad day which blue crabmeat apple candied pecans which also wonderful light  entrees monkfish which specials list which delicious buttery ribeye which cooked perfectly chicken also delicious flavorful juicy  side jambalaya which amazing also bourbon sweet potato puree which amazingly rich  desserts really made meal though  special white chocolate bread pudding which really best desserts ever along impressive cheesecake caramel pecan torte  <EOR> This second visit Emeril's Fish House  experience great first time  casual restaurant but treat if deluxe establishment  selection fish some seafood great but always Demonico's steaks well those don't prefer fish   The service impeccable thank Ivan team   The maitre d' checked more once Sommelier Sean Morgan outstanding   We've Emeril's New Orleans twice say always amazing food service  We comped couple items won't say why but didn't ever negative remark  server just very observant picked small issue   Our feeling if nice engaging staff best service  <EOR> Were need lunch libations landing Las Vegas  Conveniently Emeril's New Orleans Fish House located hotel where staying   Started off Nola Peach tea very sweet refreshing  Tony bartender very generous pours drinks nice pairing fresh shucked oysters   The sides pretty good too  hickory smoked mac cheese bourbon brown sugar sweet potatoes helped fill hunger   The barbecued shrimp crispy chicken main entrees selected  chicken moist shrimp very tasty   Unfortunately no more room left stomachs dessert  Next time  <EOR> Great atmosphere late night drink   Enjoyed happy hour mojitos really delicious resonable price   definitely come back next time ba k town   <EOR> I don't mind spending money special occasion meal providing food service commensurate high ticket entrée  $40 per entrée  We arrived 8 30pm barely wait   greeter courteous   When first sat down promptly took cocktail order told water bread would follow     The good just ordered same cocktail dinner night before Voo Doo Lounge   other place nothing write home even though same exact cocktail   don't know did differently but truly spectacular   I'd give 10   ordered dirty martini using Grey Goose vodka   The place nicely decorated main traffic isle concert arena good people watching clean   The bad came around bread just piece bread size garlic knot not very big    dinner companions very hungry asking finally came around plate full bread but visual just served just tease   She thought he just gonna leave whole plate   Instead he gave just moved other tables pass other rolls acted last bread earth he could only spare just one   The wait dinner very long   didn't time but gonna guess say 45 minutes   realize kitchen might backed something but waiter never came say he knew alive 2 more tables or whatever    plenty staff fact told fully staffed night gearing exiting crowd not until 11pm night's AC DC concert   during non busy time restaurant only 75% capacity virtually no wait  For $40 entrée want waiter top things attentive   only did waiter but waiter's helper busboy came water refills like   really no excuse could think ignore long   I heard food amazing simply couldn't wait try it   ordered Grilled Hawaiian Swordfish   overcooked very dry nothing special it   mark good food food combinations seasoning sauce   Anyone fish chicken steak   pair sauce floats boat   Anyway no such good comments could make   no sauce special flavors food pairings nothing unusual   put together some Cajun seasonings regional Louisiana cooking Pete's Sake?  felt could same fish $10 local diner   plain Jane dried out   It came Coucous   coucous very good but hey coucous   excited coucous?  saying excited rice   The vegetable asparagus   guess put grill well   overdone brought back scary memories mom's generation when used boil vegetables death   completely wilted also no flavor distinctive seasoning   If you're gonna wilt then use some spices rev palates   If you're gonna plain then serve somewhat al dente least all nutrients   I ordered Beignets   last time New Orleans am ashamed admit bypassed breakfast instead ate beignets every day breakfast along robust French coffee   Those beignets made lifetime lasting impression me   While La Gasse's beignets edible weren't light fluffy certainly forgettable   I'm giving restaurant poor score non existent service when clearly weren't busy meal no better Denny's  DT <EOR> Two seated right
