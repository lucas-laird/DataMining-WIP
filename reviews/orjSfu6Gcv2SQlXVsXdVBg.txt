Selected green chicken chili fries but only because cashier sold juices green chicken chili sealing into fries  recommendation valid fries where wasn't mountain cheese sour cream onions cilantro green chicken chili juices helped prevent mouth full dry potatoes  menu food combinations plentiful see spending multiple lunch ones within next couple months never same thing twice  <EOR> Went first time last night Tuesday special chicken tacos  shells little crispy but wasn't terrible  restaurant clean cashier spoke immediately upon entering give them second chance  <EOR> I ordered two tacos without guacamole waited  tacos good time guacamole them  took them back told would new order  sat watched order order arrived completed  If don't care money doesn't spend there  refund left  <EOR> I remember going place when Spicy Pickle   didn't know changed taco shop but decided give try   Ordered Las Vegas burrito   your standard California burrito most other locations   burrito good pretty much expected   big burrito filled meat fries cheese pico   Prices reasonable portions filling   good value your money   Only complaint took while food   lunch rush pretty brutal kitchen isn't really able handle lunch rush   I'd recommend coming early late avoiding lunch rush  <EOR> I waiting place open   trying watch figure days but still wanted try something   today Monday   ground beef taco's $1 00 Perfect!  going just 1 but decided 2   while waiting order over salsa bar   don't care carrots seem soggy raw marinated   mine raw marinated   Jalapeno's ok but      after put hot salsa taco Yes choose hot one Jalapeno's weren't needed!  taco's good!  meat seasoned perfection   pushed other 2 sauces side!
