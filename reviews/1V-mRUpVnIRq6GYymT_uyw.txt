Only concern food actually pretty cold even though prepared front us  Maybe meat left long? Given much business meat tad bit cold disappointed that  potential really good but just did served hot fresh factor should come all sit down places anyway  Even Subway offers heat your food right? remember however fast food place   So overall I'd say meh  would still give three stars because nice staffs were   even gave free coconut bark desserts  <EOR> I think shopping center located unnoticed   Braddah's much potential! just need steady crowd keep food running out  location UNLV always busy kill it!  The staff awesome friendly   I did notice however when come there's always more dirty tables forget wipe them down but know aren't busy pick kids!  Any ways keep coming back if keep making those pig tacos bark!!! <EOR> Better Chipotle hands down! nice healthier alternative traditional local Hawaiian plate lunches   Love concept most importantly food customer service  first visit decided seaweed rice bowl Huli Huli chicken Kalua pork beans cabbage guac house made mango habanero chile sauce    huge portion    it delicious! nice lady helped gave 2 free samples coconut bark  going back Kalua nachos works! 5 stars if drive thru  <EOR> I've heard much place happy see try opened location SW  bad didn't try anything because waiting inside 10 minutes nobody assist  Sad place empty could easily walked behind counter myself  Hope try again when someone able take order  <EOR> The idea Hawaiian infused Mexican style eatery genius   chipotle but Hawaiian options  always sea weed rice Kalua pig  some best ever had  Just right amount salt flavor  tried lot Kalua pig around town definitely best! good salsa too  mild pineapple one  must try if Hawaiian food  <EOR> I really excited try Braddahs because always hunt good fish tacos  heard place great ones closer rubios gave try   It chipotle like ordering style where pick everything want your food   I three fish tacos hottest salsa available black beans cheese cabbage fresh jalapeños   When home thought looked nice but when bit into them underwhelming  salsa wasn't even hot fish dry bland  black beans good but  it  Seriously fish dry couldn't even bite through it   If you're looking decent fish taco avoid place        UPDATE complained them via Twitter meal instead acknowledging terrible meal BLOCKED ME! literally never back poorly run establishment going anyway   How does business WORSE chipotle?
