Just enough smokey taste but still soft inside  also ordered two plates brussel sprouts  bit oily side but loved decomposed shaved which gave more crunch flakiness baked fried  falafel beet salad lamb chicken kebab hummus chicken liver Turkish salad  loved every bite every plate   Keep mind plates small all family style  bring food its made come individually   For dessert sticky toffee pudding Turkish coffee  coffee made sugar which would nice known prior ordering  Regardless decent shot coffee  toffee pudding good but memorable   The service quick friendly  All waiters smile face eager fill glasses water  am glad tried restaurant am looking forward trying other location Los Angeles! <EOR> Great small plates  Enjoyed Social Hour prices  Service spot food well prepared  Manny server he attentive right amount friendly  enjoyed Branzino Brussels Sprouts Social Hour menu   Moroccan fried chicken good but don't think would order again  Price 3 dishes 2 beers $51 gratuity included   shabby Vegas  am local but dining companion she never disappointed  <EOR> Had dinner before Rock Rio   After having lot bad dining experiences remarkably amazing  It flawless experience   Owners managers seem fail understand just food but entire experience person wish return  The details amazing going share them   We greeted immediately smiling cordial hostess very welcoming  No attitude lacking interest many places hire young ladies used non human communication phones   Seated great clean table near bar  Love dim lights candle table   Menu light tan background hard read but menus printed bigger print white background only brought those for older eyes but pair readers friend   Andre came over right away within minute big smile great attitude  He very knowledgable menu gave great suggestions   Everything came symphony    When beer ready someone delivered it  Not waiter but another server seemed just helping him  Great teamwork   I loved  bread comes bag keep warm   We ordered cucumber yogurt dip appetizer amazing  We falafel fried artichokes flatbreads Greek Salad  I loved everything  Lots attention detail great flavors   Staff extremely attentive   The music very sexy amazing adding atmosphere   I love cool water bottles leave table don't wait refills but very attentive keeping your glass full   Andre kept eye enough happy but much bothersome   It beyond refreshing completely flawless dining experience  <EOR> Excellent service little pricey but isn't Vegas now days food just perfect lamb tender octopus fantastic!!

However 2 times gone though really deserves 2 stars  would give food 4 stars  service though slacking big time!!!!   The first time server very awkward talked wayyy much  Even say something ordering flatbread because way many carbs under breath  Hello normal 20 something girl yes watch figure but freaking love carbs! Thank you! Ha! also took 15 minutes both friends cocktails! isn't even exaggeration because lot food ordered time them    As exact same cocktail ordered somehow lost translation  place barely anyone believe just servers mistake point no worries because everyone mistakes     What takes cake though he tried arguing never order when all did ask politely where cocktail was  Okay didn't think ordered but clearly did don't argue just say sorry reorder order cocktail requested    There few other incidents server forget name but did really set tone finer dining    After time wanted back boyfriend because venues really deserve second chances  Even third! Sometimes  second time much much busier waiting 25 minutes past reservation time sat small two top table front restaurant wasn't exactly pictured but weren't going picky because just wanted romantic night!   Some commotion started happening tables next looked though setting big party  Then someone came inform huge bachelorette party being seated next wanted know if would move    We agreed probably best moved chefs counter until another table available  food ordered old table started coming new spot everything seemed awkward point definitely mood killer! just wanted actual table eating drinking food ordered!  We finally sat [final] table told moving food which did but somehow took bit time most cold  very polite whole time but night just wasn't going we'd hoped    After shuffle around restaurant multiple servers managers hosts  bill not saying to but even cocktail taken care inconvenience  expected but honestly would smoothed experience over  something crazy being moved 3 times middle dinner     It boyfriends first time needless say he isn't forgiving am probably back  <EOR> The decor horible here   feels you're some Mediterranean restaurant middle strip mall   Almost seems unfinished white ceilings  There's pillar Arabic writing  nice but doesn't tie any other design elements  books around seating area ramdom   Overall decor sucks  music isn't much better  does Coldplay Justin Bieber common Mediterranean restaurant? NOTHING!  The food however pretty damn good  mushrooms amazing!  watermelon salad interesting good flavor beet salad but both salads chunks avocado which didn't belong  didn't add anything salad just there   bone marrow good but small subpar other bone marrow dishes needed some authentic Mediterranean Sea salt   Brussel sprouts also very good     Overall food appealing tasty but throughly thought but decor ambiance leaves lot desired   would return again try some dishes sounded good but dying return   definitely lacked WOW factor  <EOR> A group 7 came dinner  First thing notice when walk beautiful large brick oven center restaurant  wish could sat front area instead behind it    We honestly no idea order because everything sounded interesting new us  ended getting Brussels sprouts falafel merguez flatbread  food came timely manner  falafel good crispy outside but still fluffy inside something would pay $10 though  merguez flatbread most popular all flatbreads maybe expecting much  light crispy but lacked flavor  best part meal brussel sprouts  slight char gave some texture tangy sauce tossed really topped off    The price food didn't match flavors had  But if decide try place MUST brussel sprouts  <EOR> Absolutely new favorite place dine  Everything delicious hot  Service great romantic room  more say  <EOR> Awesome service amazing vegan options staff know exactly what's vegan  Tip try mushrooms artichokes Harira soup  Also quinoa salad baba hummus all fantastic  <EOR> Cleo if most tasties restaurants to   Especially such good price  Must try Wagyu beef kababs  well seasoned very tender  probably saw reviews brussel sprouts agree amazing  Flavors different any other brussel sprouts appetizer ever had  also smoky watermelon drink very unique full flavors  back again! <EOR> I absolutely love place!

Um guess pickled things all pickles? Because just picked carrots celery cauliflower  strange way spicy just doesn't work all   Chicken Tagine fine  liked rice more chicken  buttery delicious while chicken pretty plain bland   I would say worst dish night grilled octopus  Very small dish tasted very bland charred  Once again enjoyed garnishes more actual star dish which seemed pattern throughout meal   Scallops ok least can't mess right? No weren't seared correctly pretty rubbery mistakes very visible plate anyone spent more few weeks learning any cooking techniques   Fig almond panacotta actually promising delicate custard sweet figs but then sauce top just unreduced alcohol based sauce which took over whole thing  first time long neither nor gf finished desert  Sauce top awful   Service ok but gf's birthday knew advance but nobody said anything  She kind upset alone probably deserves star rating  atmosphere décor brings barely 2 stars   Overall very very disappointing  <EOR> Came Cleo past Thursday friends birthday absolutely amazed food service  server wonderful suggestions when accommodation tasting menu group ordered manager quickly agreed somewhat complicated accommodation friend needed  server really made experience stand out  definitely back more those Lamb Shwarmas! <EOR> I'm sure if possible Love place more   This hidden gem so  Darn  Good  Everything tasty! know everyone going crazy over shawarma vegetarian honestly say everything order always delicious    To best dish would Brussels sprouts! cauliflower just    perfect   My son ordered pizza decent good rest table ordered fish some more shawarma loved every bite   <EOR> Cleo continues best Middle Eastern restaurants valley   Delicious cocktails superb service delicious food  nearly dozen dishes very pleased everything ordered  <EOR> The brussel sprouts best!

Unique take traditional favorites   bit pricy but worth it! <EOR> So back Cleo last night took friends dinner  all LOVED food always    When waitress greeted table hoped time would better experience same server previous review    Well once again awkward experience every time she returned table    understand tapa style restaurant if still hungry wanted more food would order more food  recommend ask your table 5 times if want order more food when they've already said they're fine??? guests brought dinner getting very irritated she continued interrupt conversation attempting push more food us  felt being stalked car salesman trying meet quota  hope next time come Nessa I think name was server  <EOR> Came celebrate early bday dinner dad when arrived no wait seated fairly quick even gave private dining room    The food seriously world !! Mediterranean styled tapas recommend each person ordering 2 3 plates then everyone sharing family style    Everything seriously 5 5 no joke  But things ordered Cucumbers Yogurt Kind tarty yogurt dip fresh cucumbers super fresh hot flatbread dip in  Brussels Sprout Hearts Hazelnuts Super delicious cooked perfectly still crunchy but soft  Tuna Tartare DIE !! tuna soft fresh just melted your mouth  dad raw fish eater even loved it Spinach Ricotta Dumplings Yummy balls goodness more ricotta tasting spinach but good none less creamy pesto sauce drenched cleaned off plate   Roast Lamb tender juicy cooked perfect medium rare  all places serve good lamb but Cleo definitely down also comes served bed couscous  Merguez doesn't say description menu but slices lamb pepperoni if accompanied onions peppers mozzarella really good flatbread   Scallops Melts your mouth when gone wanted more Garlic Shrimp sauce dish !   From now every time come Vegas making stop too <EOR> Had very nice dinner Wed night  conference sat bar chatted cool bartender chick    The tapas bit spendy but portion size quite generous compared tapas places California! three items couldn't finish them  Here's had Grilled octopus Loved it!! rubbery all feared  Delicious highly recommended!  Cauliflower cashews Curry flavor bit spicy but good Spanakopita three tasty  filled spinach feta cheese Lotus Flower cocktail Delicious sweet  Light fruity floral flavor   Service atmosphere great  Overally positive experience would come back when Vegas  <EOR> We 3 people ordered 7 dishes which tapas style  Must order flatbread $5 which dont think individually listed menu  If order dips hummus flatbread comes it    Meatball Tagine $13 comes 6 meatballs? Nothing special but meatballs bowl tomatoe sauce  good but worth ordering   Lamb Shawarma lamb skewer which slow roasted spices  very delicious flavorful! Must try!  Grilled Octopus celery potatoe lemon vinaigrette just medium cooked flavorly  Garlic shrimp gigante beans castelvetrano preserved lemon favorite dish! Probably comes 12 shrimps  your typical garlic shrimp sauce seasoning different but very good    Quinoa roasted vegetable salad spiced almond cumin Good salad but portion small    Denison sausage salty order comes sausage cut up    Overall mediterrean restaurant balance flavor not overwhelming seasoning most mediterreanean food   Each dish $10 $15 which could shared  enjoy sampling variety diffferent dishes  doesnt seem lot food but filling  <EOR> We live Las Vegas try avoid eating casinos   family Greek American made big exception Cleo   food amazing   easy just dine   done beautiful job interior don't even feel if casino when eating   brussel sprouts   hummus   tangine chicken   Actually whatever want because all great  <EOR> Visited Cleo's birthday based Yelp reviews despite needing cab most food outstanding   scallops the accompanying salad WORLD brussels sprouts amazing garlic shrimp just so so   definitely pricey excursion $158 before tip 2 share bread hummus 4 small plates then each 2 cocktails but left satisfied meal   really want give 4 5 stars would deduct  5 star hostess' demeanor trying seat near kitchen when restaurant nearly empty  <EOR> Amazing experience!
