No offers that  vegetarian there's still much eat there  can't stand Cilantro unlike chipotle choose every ingredient  turn off chipotle employee told All Mexican food Cilantro it  Wrong thing tell am Mexican just true  <EOR> I am indifferent food here  salsas kinda' bland but tell meat lean fatty  Whenever only restaurant sight always drive around bit see if another choice before settling   <EOR> Terrible food  cheapest nastiest tortillas ever had  hard roll burrito doesn't just fall apart? Hate  <EOR> Every time come Vegas come specific Qdoba  Friendly people good food enough said  <EOR> Similar other locations fan place but good chicken nachos  food bit pricey when compare Chipotle less fresh well  I'd only recommend location if craving mexican no other choices  Service good  <EOR> Read you'll kick review     Love QDOBA visit many cities around US  But never come location again due horrible customer service  goes I order burrito chips seat come back ask some Salsa  really smart girl register Irene says charge $0 97 that  asked come? didn't any salsa chips  She because ordered Chips which $2 Chips Salsa which also $2 now charge salsa  Really??  just smiled paid $1  amazing stupid be  Both girls working shift seemed no interest job seemed forcefully just passing time  Stay away location  <EOR> Qdoba same concept chipotle but better quality food flavors  offer more options food sauces  portions huge always fresh  usually co workers lunch 2 $22 deal  Two entrees two drinks bag chips queso dip  burrito bowl grilled steak chicken  staff vey friendly quick  If line moves quickly  also offer kids meals around $5  location clean but parking crowded bc busy parking lot large gym big Starbucks  <EOR> I ordered Nachos pretty good   queso cheese Nachos chicken good   also portions   chips little salty but don't eat lot salt general anyways   service pretty fast mostly friendly   friend ordered together specifically asked 2 drinks   She gave 1 cup when told again needed 2 she said only charged 1 somewhat snotty attitude   WTF don't care charge give another cup   Other everything else fine  <EOR> INCONVENIENCE! first AND LAST time visited Qdoba  Very simple     I way Qdoba $50 gift card  wanted use debit card pin # connected checking account   told manager only accept cash gift cards  But food could use debit or credit card   asked if franchise  Yes  asked policy was  He said Qdoba's policy  asked boss wondering if he franchise owner not   He told district manager Henderson boss   Well already having gone way going inconvenienced finding ATM only come back money could charged directly checking  So called Qdoba Corporate  Apparently Qdoba sister company Jack in the Box  FANTASTIC! Jack in the Box takes credit debit cards right? receptionist corporate explained Cash Gift Cards policy enforced franchise owner but necessarily mandatory   According manager problems using credit debit cards purchasing gift cards  But if real scammer could bought $50 worth food paid credit debit card complained food so re make waste food   could disputed charge later        I think take high road just NEVER step foot another Qdoba       In town TON competitor Mexican restaurants gladly take money  THANK Qdoba teaching valuable lesson economics customer service! Good Job! <EOR> One star giving them much! family loves place much  Today ordered bowel first received picture shows  asked sour cream side home NO sour cream  amazed nothing bowl  asked two scoops rice said while good no way worth 8 00 It messy leaking something down side no salsa just sad  Then ALWAYS seems issue showed them membership number  She looked said ok handed phone back     store 6 times since March 1 order credited twice   How hard put number?

Chicken fresh hot! Love!!! <EOR> Eating Qdoba reminds eating Chipotle' except little more mexican side  mostly eat longer lunch breaks because never sure big crowd gonna be  Another major factor Qdoba's manager comes work a block away drops off 2 1 coupons which really no brainer    I all ingredients laid front workers pretty efficient quick choice selection well  prefer soft Burritos Carne' Asada corn some black beans Guac Sour Cream super filling meal   At same time can't see dropping $8 lunch when massive mondo Carne Asada Burrito right down street Roberto's    But place clean bathrooms usually spotless usually busy lunch time  twice distance 2 blocks work which deters sometimes though Qdoba usually can't find spot close park limited time due gym crowd workers parked parking lot    I enjoy place come back every often  don't believe deserved quite 4 stars maybe 3 5   Cheers! MikeB <EOR> Their air conditioning broken  Walken in  Walked out  almost hot outside  110+ outside  situations should close store until fix ac  couldn't stay eat if wanted to  First all cannot safe having food heat  Second needed cool enjoy food  Close doors until fix ac  <EOR> First time location   lunchtime   Only server cashier working but she did great job moving thru   least 6 people line   naked chicken burrito queso no rice   Excellent  <EOR> Not sure if ever eaten before but tried yesterday okay  veggie bowl white rice black beans veggies salsa sour cream  good but lacking some type flavor spice  also tortilla soup wish actually tortillas strips give crunch but liked spicy definitely kick it  Service good guy took order prepared really nice funny  Maybe next time ill add extra salsa dash salt  <EOR> Qdoba  Qdoba oh missed you! am absolute fan place! yet fail me! use eat least 3 4 times week few years ago! relocated Las Vegas wasn't never successful finding another Qdoba! Chipotle good but over rated although pretty much same concept love aren't cheap portions meat! came today lunch tried seasonal Mango Taco Salad bowl chicken! Extremely tasty guy made very generous toppings would complain that? must've arrived excellent time because kid all but 2 people place when arrived which resulted being helped immediately! Staff great customer service point! glad back Vegas close Qdoba again! <EOR> Still half star       Sat eve 6pm  Joint still empty except couple homeless guys camping watching eat   Still all cold food including tortillas  8 00 crummy cold burrito  Asked cashier kindly if he could cut burrito half?  He squarely said No allowed cut them but plastic knives garbage can    business    plssssss <EOR> Although prices higher California fiancé said come because she bummed area shut down only 6 months  Probably because wasn't charging Nevada prices??   Anyway    pretty straightforward restaurant Chipotle style food  conveniently located near 24 hour fitness gym junkies want healthy choice workout    The guy prepped tacos believe prep cook came over help because getting busy    which came good thing because he ended putting good sized portions tacos ended having chicken bowl tacos finished <EOR> So always wondering kind food Qdoba was  Little did know similar other places ate at   The concept same Chipotle Cafe Rio  tell first person see want prepare want your burrito taco salad etc  food good but worth price  Chipotle virtually same price same food  If want convenience closer because virtually same  <EOR> If Chipotle Chipotle  only thing separates itself Chipotle queso cheese peppers it offered put burrito  Other same exact thing  just re labeled Chipotle  food fake mexican Chipotle but served clueless non english speaking servers  Know want say loud prepared point  Don't special requests  You'll ruin someone's day  <EOR> I work right qdoba when don't want drive walk here  But EVERY time disappointed  Why keep going? no idea  service terrible rice HARD food doesn't even compare Chipotle Don't waste your time  <EOR> I don't care anyone says Qdoba shizzzz! lemon zesty rice delicious diablo queso sauce flavorful guacamole everything done right! service always friendly quick point  10 times better Chipotle  <EOR> Qdoba right street where work coworker big fan eat ever few weeks  only thing naked burrito  Naked simply means no tortilla no extra carbs cutting 330 calories! All goodies into bowl instead    You pick chicken steak both which good think pork well but never tried it  Then black brown beans I always black   Then pile rice veggies cheese sour cream guacamole multiple different kinds salsas  corn salsa  favorite but last visit mango salsa excellent  really hope seasonal bit bet is     Service always great when gone never experienced employees skimping things other reviewers mentioned  Then again only location tried perhaps just don't know am supposed getting? am always happy eating lunch Qdoba though am fan  <EOR> I walk hotter inside then outside Las Vegas   TURN YOUR AIR CONDITIONING    place opened hour ago empty DIRTY    outside tables look haven't cleaned month    door more dirty then tables   GROSS staff friendly too     Now next day  I'm Back   Same discusting front  door gross outside tables    Air still on   owners just must care anymore    place  business soon <EOR> We used now closed location D I  Durango alot before Chipotle cashier said location closed due numerous robberies   came recently couple weekends ago  lunch saturday nice day just barely table outside  Inside big spacious clean many people eating inside either  food containers full  several people working there  No drive through window  yummy seasoned smelling chicken grill which reminded El Pollo Loco  right front you your liking beans salsa etc  Chipotle Zaba's  Simple menu like Chipotle prices around same average price $6 but no take out menus available    My husband burrito hard corn tacos you could soft flour tacos   think cost around $16 regular price both but Entertainment Book coupon half that! very good good remember few years back  flavor seasoned chicken really good  crunchiness corn tacos fulfilling  corn lettuce cheese salsa  Notice keep making references Chipotle  just love Chipotle been 3x month's time easily edges Qdoba Mexican Grill concepts similar but exactly same but still gets high marks  <EOR> I enjoy food here  Straightforward concept Chipotle like  am big fan nachos here  three cheese sauce delicious little spice  enjoy salsa always seemed fresher competitors  burritos pretty standard always consistent  only real concern veggie nachos veggie burritos pay more fajita veggies rice only nachos   Seriously? am already getting meat which means already cheaper make  Other place stay rotation   This Qdoba always very clean really busy service typically pretty decent  <EOR> I diehard Chipotle fan until 3 months ago when worse food poisoning ever experienced  2 Cipro's later started recover but unfortunately Chipotle haven't desire step foot into place again    Since use love Chipotle chain much fiancé begged try Qdoba gotta say folks just isn't great   The chicken Qdoba strange texture just doesn't taste flavorful  But steak better Chipotles IMO    Would come back Qdoba? Possibly particular store fast friendly but just don't know if food worth it  <EOR> We moving Las Vegas Top 10 things we'll miss Qdoba! closest where moving 3 hours away  Queso burrito FTW   Sign text promotions $6 burrito drink deals often! <EOR> I am big fan Qdoba  since college Reno Qdoba opened far apartment  place awash kids University all time  Mainly because first place its kind open Reno  No really experienced type fast food movement before  Reno Qdoba before Chipotle   Overall both Chipotle Qdoba  few subtle differences but most part same style same food same way doing things   The thing enjoy different Qdoba Queso Burrito which Chipotle does have  Basically burrito or anything guess queso dumped it  Thus making your somewhat healthy meal completely utterly unhealthy add sour cream extra fatness yay!    This particular location very busy shopping center  Parking quite limited  restaurant itself also small side  But never waited long food employees most part quick cordial    I would give 5 stars but since being introduced Chipotle think Chipotle style just slightly better Qdoba unless course want queso  Well then choice clear  <EOR> I can't tell much location pisses off core!!!  downloaded yelp app first time just white   location never picks phone also close 30 minutes 1 hour early most days customer service worst  no smiles just attitude whole time bugging them giving business money  Honestly food just would never want step foot location those people again   <EOR> I grew Denver! Where Qdoba Chipotle started location far worst visited location many times  luck its worst every time go  Im am bad review place but people work happy  Sad cause cause if visit most welcoming happy help  <EOR> I'm Chipotle fan but thought would give Qdoba try  Bow say tried but definately going back Chipotle  steak bowl bland  white rice fresh savory  don't knownif bad day but definately going back  husband steak burrito unlike he Qdoba other locations  He even said food did much flavor it  sticking Chipotle! <EOR> MUCH better Rainbow location  If choice come instead  other sucks  <EOR> My children LOVE coming lunch  employees always nice patient  The food always fresh obviously exactly it  <EOR> Ate today family  staff very friendly restaurant clean food great  ordered salad shredded pork spicy cheese sause yum!  husband ordered burrito also very happy  return  <EOR> Usually place OK  Don't try ask any questions won't any meaningful answers  Food Great  favorite thing diversity options compared other mexican places  location usually filled business casual people  completely packed lunch  Now Tortilla soup go  $3 comes small cup leaves worst taste your mouth    Stick burritos  <EOR> The first last time visit 2 girl working  closing shift last night horrible attitudes if didn't want help me  where several items where put away which doesn't sense why would put away items when your still open  $25 spent would rather chipotle! <EOR> For above fast food mexican food cant beat  cheap prices  good quality food  great taste  really 3 cheese burrito 3 cheese nachos  Having choice between black brown beans also very good opinion  Location very convenient being near house  would absolutely put Qdoba Chipotle quality food  <EOR> Nothing special  place right work and don't very many lunch options gave try despite not so great reviews  wish didn't  Now wasn't terrible in edible but needs LOT work  ordered extra extra spicy sauce burrito extremely mild  don't know if forgot sauce really isn't spicy? burrito itself missing something  veggies bland meat bleh actual wheat tortilla soft  Almost wasn't cooked properly? would suggest skip place all costs  Eat somewhere better trust there's lots options  <EOR> We dinner brother sister kids 3 cheese nachos both mild queso while spicy  told mild kick while spicy hit surprise tasted delicious none less  mom also 3 cheese nachos same expect normal size  Take consideration mom handle spice especially mom she thought spicy queso spicy  If cant handle spice well don't recommend spicy queso dad 3 tacos he liked lot  place good families kid portion pretty big  just thought should mention that  Other all thought delicious definitely come back place again  <EOR> This great way any day  many things choose even kid's menu little ones bring along  personally love nachos! great really hit spot two delicious quesos mild little kick spicy really daredevils because wall spicy if don't spicy much  Also tocas great many different meats choose great selection toppings  if want try something new try Qdoba! <EOR> WTF  burrito tiny tortilla gummy ALL rice all salsa sour cream only side  Awful doesn't even describe it  <EOR> Food meh  Customer service terrible  vegetarian salad asked guacamole side  line worker told she would charge extra that  explained vegetarian comes guacamole  just wanted side  She insisted charging extra   Terrible attitude  High expectations let down  <EOR> Oh em gee favorite spots eat chipotle but another brand kinda Burger King McDonald pretty much same thing but ohh loorrt good if wanna eat some good Mexican food place lol <EOR> What typically think Qdoba just Chipotle just good  mood burrito bowl Qdoba much closer Chipotle thought I'd give them chance  Pretty much all same options Chipotle  offer brown rice well but decided white    Service quick satisfactory  Nothing amazing noteworthy but sufficed less five minutes  took meal home eat tasty relatively healthy depending choose eat    Overall experience 3 1 2 star but rounded convenience sake  remember area which always seem forget  <EOR>
