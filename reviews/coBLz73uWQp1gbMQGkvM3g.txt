Our first impression upon entering restaurant really clean super modern looking  kinda feeling entering nightclub lounge but when walked lounge area grills could all seen along end restaurant    The grills themselves pretty cool view restaurant bar kinda overlooking it  Also huuuuuge projection dodgers game being played   The food great    both geisha house special which included shrimp lobster chicken filet mignon steak  also included soup salad fried rice free drink sake  fried rice tasted bit bland but overall satisfied everything   I think plan returning whenever we're craving hibachi style Japanese food! <EOR> If hadn't recently gone Hokkaido perhaps would overlooked number things however great experience   Firstly wear coats thoughout meal seating area freezing!  When even hibachi chef complained he told management something venting cooktop  made very uncomfortable dinner  Secondly question order meal  Soup salad then fried rice then veggies then proteins?  All separate rice cold before veggies even hit plate  portions adequate but chef kept moving food trash area grill  No asked if wanted dessert no oranges other sweets offered  other similar restaurants nearby hard recommend Geisha House  <EOR> Wow first time recommended friend  seated Nina section awesome experience started then!!! She friendly knowledge great smile  She started off drink ended recommending amazing Blue Ninja Sakatini Good !! don't eat raw ask Nina recommendation since she won trust drink  she exceeded ALL sushi expectations all knowledge she EVERY item menu  work bank manager must provide excellent service each day expect same where ever go  But Nina far beyond exceeded expectation! would recruit Banker just because she good people  management would promote soon before someone always looking great talent recruit day  Thanks awesome night! <EOR> We deciding between Geisha House Oh Jah but ended here  several different tepinyaki places place overpriced portions small  give whole lot vegetables rice but meat portion tiny  fried rice bit hard side filet mignon nice tender but zero flavor  drench sauce taste good  asked waiter if military discount she looked cheap  She says ummm don't know  check  Overall customer service ok most part but won't back  <EOR> Great Happy Hour!! Friendly staff food always point! early though good spot patio  <EOR> This Sushi restaurant absolutely beautiful! Located where old Sapporo used Flamingo 215 figured place would packed  Sadly when dined last night may total 10 tables occupied   Andy sat bar bartender Rob very sweet helpful  ordered few drinks few items off happy hour menu  Spicy Salmon Roll alright bad good  But Traffic Light Roll great! also order baked mussels unfortunately two occasions piece black hair mussel  even sending back receiving new one  eh   all all probably wont back but im glad tried place  MISS SAPPORO!! <EOR> Best hibachi place around!

Since now pay full price food asked nice hostess seat table  atmosphere really nice! table nice spacious 4 top neat watching hibachi tables  However server TERRIBLE! He walked multiple time took forever greet us  When he finally did greet asked multiple times extra paper order sheet place additional orders which never he spoke low couldn't understand seemed very unsure take order  ordered variety food gyoza good but better other sushi joints Hawaiian roll Love roll Secret Husband  sushi nothing write home decided try something completely different  ordered jalapeno cracker good!

Delicious food friendly service beautiful interior  Happy hour everyday 4 9! <EOR> I really liked interior restaurant but food would say best had  tepanyaki menu grill   thought portions simply way much person finish  could barely finish half rice ton leftover seafood meat well  Perhaps might good idea them lower price little adjust portions something more realistic   Since portions huge price isn't friendly either  Don't wrong though much give price good  However isn't easy order only 1 portion 2 people tepanyaki   The server nice but little awkward felt like  instance beer cocktail bar switched tables since getting tepanyaki  server came direct tables  thought she would help bring drinks let know she bring later  Instead awkwardly carry drinks ourselves and 2 each person carefully across restaurant  Only when new table did she recognize carefully carrying cups asked if needed help    Overall bad restaurant but restaurant excited really  <EOR> This spot regular hangout when under different ownership different name First time Geisha House  work LVAC wanting stop forever  disappointed  tuna salmon fresh    the service very good  back! <EOR> I such wonderful time dining Geisha Steakhouse   took friend dinner birthday    hard choose things talk because everything awesome   tried specialty drink Lychee Martini   only beautifully presented piece fresh fruit lovely flower tasted amazing    order another    Of course mainly food   never bad experience food   chef during visit most captivating chef yet   He name Stan Lee    party comprised geeky type never forget name   loved engagement parties table   seemed he caters type crowd he prepares masterpiece for   He even ended spectacular performance fire dance    Thank such wonderful experience definitely back  <EOR> Went Happy Hour 4pm 9pm  Japanese Lasagna sushi roll $7 3 piece sampler $5  Just looking sushi menu seems little spendy  Japanese lasagna everywhere just OK   The restaurant very nice 5 teppanyaki tables inside 2 patio which pretty cool  always thought Geisha Steak house best teppanyaki meal Vegas just haven't awhile   Drinks just OK well nothing exciting rave about  strawberry martini sake ginger mojito  I'd come cool ambiance again  Service pretty good too  <EOR> While exactly sure Geisha house supposed look very open modern feel versus traditional Japanese restaurant  can't help notice huge screen behind sushi bar cool touch  All hibachi grills located perimeter restaurant dinning areas located center along large bar  Once seated beautiful geisha girl imagine that lol  received quick friendly service days special  very simple menu easy navigate  food good comes quick well presented  really can't wrong here  <EOR> Try Lychee Martinis  recommend going entertainment  chef very funny  food taste great  would definitely return shrimp  <EOR> Honestly waste your time money  many other hibachi teppan establishments around town don't allow staff wasted while clock  Generally prefer eat restaurants where waitstaff come check more once every half hour  also tend spend money places where management actually cares your concerns  If want mediocre food poor service where brought wrong check 3 times wait additional 15 minutes leave then place you! <EOR> geisha house become favorite sushi bar !!!!! coming  while but would come chance try those wonderful coupons online !! tried loved continue regular customers even though live  way mountains edge !!
