We group 8 Las Vegas locals celebrating friend's birthday   first impression great some drinks bar bartender very knowledgeable nice seated best tables restaurant  whole group would agree once seated disapointed service waiter he suggested Chef's Tasting menu $45each due size party all thought reasonable but members group food allergy mushrooms 3 six items contained mushrooms when asked substitute waiter acted offended told them eat around mushrooms   opted tasting menu comment made ordered some delicious items Crab Lettuce Wraps Pesto Pasta Asparagus egg Flat Breads other items  service improved evening sadly once realized would possibly repeat customers talking sommelier waiters personality   bill over $850 tapas dessert cava toast wine 2 @bottles $70each   Overall food good atmosphere great  <EOR> This review La Cave Wynn Hotel  also restaurant called La Cave Paris hotel  Different restaurant bit confusing   Back business La Cave Wynn Hotel  tapas restaurant  order bunch small plates share  Everything ordered and ordered lot delicious  5 probably ordered 15 different small plates  Also wine  also vegan party she ordered 3 different menu items off vegan menu you ask but every single restaurant Wynn hotel vegan menu if ask  My favorite item flatbread artichokes ricotta cheese top  amazing  don't eat meat but guys party loved mini burgers  wound ordering additional serving those  Cheeses phenomenal  ask more little breads brie  sister vegan ordered another version artichoke flatbread sans cheese which she said phenomenal well  She also beet dish she said very good   Just couple negatives  First all called restaurant couple weeks before trip reservations  told since La Cave more casual dining options Wynn did take reservations  Upon arriving La Cave night 40th birthday asked if reservation  told hostess called told could reservation  She said must spoken wrong person  She proceeded tell tables all booked night but she could room lounge area  turned fine  actually liked lounge area better main restaurant area  lot more light enclosed patio area  Outdoor patio closed due high winds    although saw people sitting even told closed  only problem lounge area tables low seating really set meal  But worked fine since small plates casual eating situation  just disappointed when called phone number listed restaurant online told thing then told something different arrival  am glad room since birthday trip planned months advance picked La Cave all other restaurants Vegas due menu options worked everyone birthday party  dropped $1 000 place almost lost business  would say need fix issue asap   One other caveat place very expensive  may more casual dining options Wynn but when comes price  Since small plates tapas style restaurant order least 2 plates per person enough food that's why they're called small plates  Each plate around $12 $20  then there's beverages  glass wine cost $15  cheapest bottle around $65   Also say wish some restaurants Vegas where all servers waitresses hostesses dressed prostitutes  No matter where ate throughout stay no matter upscale restaurant without fail all waitresses wearing skin tight stretchy dresses skirts just barely covered private parts  Since first trip Vegas caught bit off guard  But guess  just Vegas  definitely town set men  noticed male servers dressed similarly scantily  Just females and most servers female all restaurants  <EOR> Best tapas spot Vegas  Just go  Enjoy  gone ten times now never bad service bad dish there  prosciutto fig jam amazing  Crab cakes bomb  Plus if sit patio outside seclusion adds nice effect meal  Perfect date night  Don't change thing guys  <EOR> I love some good tapas place did disappoint  Tried halibut toasted baguette marinated grilled shrimp  Both world  still crave those shrimp! <EOR> Came 8 other girls friend's birthday  Needless say tried pretty much everything menu VERY PLEASED! server Matt also extremely attentive funny quick! service overall very quick even though 9 girls easily 1 5 hours    Some favorites however include but note really wasn't anything disliked * hamachi jalapenos refreshing crisp! small portion * crab lobster lettuce wrap * flatbreads both artichoke bacon egg delicious * bacon wrapped dates   All including tax tip ended being $60 person excluding alcohol    They also various wine flights 4 available ranging $15 25  <EOR> We came back 4 years later enjoying ambiance first time  time service quick food good but unable seated outside ambiance good  Overall still good restaurant but outside seating nicer  <EOR> An unexpected delight  While wandering around casinos decided wanted grab some lunch sent La Cave hotel concierge  great surprise!

Very romantic ambiance delicious food excellent wine selection! more girl ask for?! <EOR> I small plates tapas shareables etc  La Cave list while  we're hungry but because near decided stop bar try out    We only tried four apps which plenty us  couple next suggested Jumbo lump crab lettuce cups  Great crabmeat crispy lettuce No complaint freshness just very simple point wanted something more  needed touch lemon yuzu aioli just something bring together  little more thought into dish would great    We tried Salmon sashimi tostada  also good but simple  Although 3 small pieces $15 seemed bit steep even Vegas prices    We sampled Bacon wrapped dates blue cheese fondue  Wrapped dates blue cheese dipping sauce  Pass one  You've seen bunch times  tired   Finished Diver sea scallops polenta cake  Very good   La Cave deserves another try  sure there's plenty dishes would blow away  apps although good just knock off stool great    They very aggressive wine list lots wine glass but wines definitely cheap  know Vegas Wynn but would nice gouged wine every place strip  But guess them all consistent guess  <EOR> We rather large group 23 7 which kids but knew when made reservations made ordering process smooth possible having person order group  The manager clearly overwhelmed size party he couldn't even hide lack competence  Within three minutes seating he around both tables tell party keep quiet  Considering only party sitting inside need quiet for? You? Plus if 23 people seated separate tables would just loud   The service quick clearly eager which understandable  actually did early dinner could before dinner rush   friendly? any means  thank waiter three times   before he acknowledged he clearly heard he just didn't care ill mannered 6 year old   The kids started playing little fake candles ones cost $0 10 each party city restaurant $0 0003 each  manager just seems really hate anything joyous quickly ran over YANKED yes yanked them away kids  Why necessary? kids quiet per request hurting anybody anything  Why he anti them having good time? Overall decent food unfriendly service cheap management <EOR> La Cave favorite spots when Vegas  Atmosphere rocks consider asking sit outside if bear nighttime heat food delicious  ordered onion soup which excellently prepared along salmon sashimi crackers gorgonzola salad grilled salmon  Salmon sashimi only outstanding fun but amazing bit pricey got  ordered La Cave pale ale which did disappoint  also find price value good comparison all other overpriced restaurants strip  three drinks four dishes under $100  Service little uneven but very nice slightly awkward server set up  Would highly recommend anyone staying near Wynn  <EOR> Fantastic ambiance  indoors feels you're dining wine cellar outdoor patio overlooks pool area which night lit very pleasingly  sat middle  sort open air dining room best both  Nice!  The food great but expensive  roasted beets goat cheese quail's egg pizza some kind steak mushroom dish sort deconstructed Caprese salad  salad really small weird but everything else great!
