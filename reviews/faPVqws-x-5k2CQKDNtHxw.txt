Our friends made reservations excited join them FRIED CHICKEN meal   As server stated upon seating chicken used YST B brined 27 hours prior frying them   I really excited bite into nice juicy crispy chicken until informed server YST B's chicken isn't very crispy   After hearing sighed ever quietly     We decided order following Lewellyn's Fried Chicken  3 stars    As someone loves CRISPY fried chicken  say version moist juicy but crispy   To say disappointed would understatement!!  The skin fried however still bit soft flaccid   I'm going guess brining process used chickens moist  But doesn't allow skin crisp due fact all moisture brine soaked into chicken skin itself   The chicken itself flavorful   Tip just bite into piece chicken  made mistake bit into chicken bone  Owwww!!  all say     I suppose if friends wanted come back eat Lewellyn's fried chicken would accompany them  But can't say would way order again   The chicken comes honey hot sauce which sweet but does add some flavor heat bird   Shrimp Grits  4 stars    I enjoyed dish  shrimps plump meaty   Thankfully shrimp deveined shell removed thus only leaving tail discard   The grits coarse which appreciated fan creamy grits   Aside onions which just moved side impressed dish   The sauce nice accompaniment but didn't much flavor profile  wondered why until read menu again  sauce made chicken jus PBR     There more enough share if u r ordering other items well   Collard Greens  3 5 stars    I really enjoyed collard greens   They weren't terribly vinegar nature made fresh order   There still light crunch them which appreciated  some bad experience mushy collard greens nice dish made properly   The menu said dish supposed come cracklins but never saw tasted any  Shucks  would nice touch   Peach Cobbler  3 5 stars    There's something eating fresh peach cobbler just come oven!!

First say love decor set up  service awesome fast  However when seated server offered water but gave room temp water actually ask ice  menu limited brunch but figure means few things great stick that   We started Fried Green Tomato BLT  presentation pretty flavors all bended well together  would give 5 stars! Most cocktails seemed Whisky Bourbon based hate dark liquor but didn't seem much choice *shrug* tried watermelon sling which made white whisky actually pretty tasty  entree shrimp grits  shrimp good but didn't much flavor would liked grits good separately But together flavors didn't seem blend well  guess now live south shrimp grits various ways shrimp grits memorable  would them again  partner chicken side of Mac cheese  chicken good liked it  better but wasn't bad  Mac Cheese good but could come little hotter less dry  prefer Mac Cheese more creamy  dessert tried butterscotch cake bacon infused frosting  eying ever since discovered place online  However though wasn't bad just wasn't good thought would be  cake itself kinda dense frosting too  prefer moist fluffy but rich type cake  heavy    This place mediocre best  flavor quality food unfortunately does match superb service  expected due location price but left little disappointed  <EOR> Amazing banana pudding desert served glass jar  GREAT bacon infused bourbon old fashioneds  Shrimp grits unctuous  place resembles yardbird miami modern cozy dark lit  sat couch lounged wasnt packed 10pm  Perfect meal! <EOR> This easily best food trip  Chicken ridiculously good  Service notch  now  Return often  Great value Vegas  definitely next time vegas  <EOR> We great meal exceptional service Bryan H! tried biscuits Mac Cheese deviled eggs chicken waffles  chicken waffles dish best ever  dish ordered many times before including some great Southern restaurants South Carolina Louisiana  dish bit pricey but big enough two people share delicious  <EOR> Being South probably pickier most Southern establishments  little skeptical place but figured I'd give shot  Service very friendly but overall mediocre little overpriced even strip standards can't say see much reason return trip    The smoked peaches ham drink interesting enjoyed creative drink used bourbon peach syrup smoked ham  nice flavor without much sweetness    The ham biscuits good but should mention they're served regular thin sliced ham rather traditional saltier country ham    The brisket sandwich large portion won't leave hungry  traditional BBQ sandwich covered tasty but bit sweet BBQ sauce served lettuce sandwich  brisket doesn't much smoked flavor its own doubt whether freshly smoked  say great meat doesn't  need much sauce   One note new waiter table next ours accidentally threw away $25 peach cobbler leftovers  takes 30 45 mins couldn't another easily oops    Overall glad tried did enjoy meal but wasn't blown away  If you're looking Southern type meal strip place alright but if you're South place won't quite impress you  <EOR> Amazing great food great service  Don't miss chicken biscuits Mac cheese  <EOR> Yardbird definitely BEST chicken waffles ever had!! restaurant totally puts other 5 star reviews chicken places shame    My bf craving chicken waffles out all things Vegas when stumbled upon place Yelp  made way Venetian seated almost immediately    We ordered deviled eggs $11 start because most famous dishes  Well super delicious right amount seasoning it! trout roe top which change but totally worked well eggs gave extra flavor    We also ordered Chicken 'N Watermelon 'N Waffles $36 definitely best dishes ever had  may seem pricey but entire plate bigger two heads actually really filling two people  Plus whole dish heavenly mouthwatering price worth it!
