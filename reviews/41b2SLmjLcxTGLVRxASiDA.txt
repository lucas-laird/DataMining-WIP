Wynn which supposed Las Vegas best best RIGHT?  Sadly wrong all counts lets just say thoroughly let down  much turned 2 people away eating already  Look if ruin feel meal early review know just lackluster     So made reservation advised place very busy Friday afternoon  walked greeted pleasantly team front podium sat very promptly   table glass no matter where sit great view entire Wynn golf course   chairs even real comfy which just great sign wanted think every detail through your dining experience  Things looking right?  Our waiter came dropped menu option vegan menu  took second but then realized no wine drink menu  asked waiter brought over relatively timely manner  actual menu simple covers pretty much every option would expect lunch dining more 3 items looked good  When waiter came back ordered nice white wine France things started  sadly where things started slide downhill  waiter pinged back forth few times before waived down gave food order for tomato mozzarella salad chicken club sandwich   while wondering where wine waiter informed didnt ordered brought bottle something Oregon different varietal  Now let stop if Olive Garden wouldnt big deal but reputation more importantly PRICE place means held higher standard  bottle declined asked alternate menu  waiter seemed confused  wine list isnt very long knowing whats should hard   Now first course came salad soup companion eager try food  Sadly another let down salad just bland  waive down waiter salt none table  until point if read review might think real picky just kind harsh critic but really comes down again price level certain expectations being dragged down very fast fashion  Finally wine brought able enjoy alongside food  when waiter disappeared 15 minutes  whenever ran wine reach over myself   The main course came kitchen which looked amazing still having constantly refill own wine  Now chicken sandwich real good flavor well cooked chicken sauces soft bread  Really only positive part meal its saving grace me  dining companion ordered item off vegan menu a mushroom napoleon unfortunately let down flavor   I really cant tell much wanted place maybe thats why am let down  Sub par service food place must skip far am concerned  Wish wasnt case! <EOR> The view breathtaking perfect end meal last day Vegas  arrived opening time 11 30 without reservation seated promptly  chose sit outside overlooking golf course waterfall  menu promising did disappoint  server Jack very knowledgable friendly  He kept water glasses full answered any questions menu just overall wonderful personality  bread basket real treat pretzel bread delicious  menu lot cajun inspired dishes happy see that  also informed chef used work Commanders Palace New Orleans  able sample both corn chowder gumbo   Both delicious but decided gumbo  portions really nice left full bread gumbo burger fries  also king creole burger let tell bacon die for The special creole seasoning spot unique delicious  meat patty cooked perfection burger tender juicy  friend Ahi tuna salad  That delicious well perfect sear flavor combinations  Overall come back location because setting service most importantly food  Next time can't wait try beignets  <EOR> Sunday Jazz Brunch MUST! little pricey but well worth it  Nice ambiance good food  Favorites fruit salad mint watermelon gazpacho waffles macaroons vegan corn chowder cheeses apricot jam  If vegan then place you  Actually any restaurant Wynn good all required vegan menu  Bread pudding French toast also another must  staff all amazing  can't wait come back  <EOR> When first read Wynn Las Vegas classified Country Club Grill Wynn's golf club restaurant  Translation boring! However I'd read many complimentary reviews decided perhaps worth shot   The Country Club Grill serves lunch dinner  don't need play golf eat here everyone welcome  menu simple  Dinner concentrates hunks meat steaks chops plus few seafood options  Lunch offers similarly basic though lighter fare   Located next Wynn's golf course wonderful views  Outside tables available  manages maintain feel golf club restaurant albeit lot fancier any such place ever to   I ate lunch  Cobb Salad mix standard ingredients including lettuce turkey bacon blue cheese tomato avocado all cut into small pieces  few words small pieces should small humanly possible less quarter inch square  Country Club Grill didn't meet standard but did cuts small any seen restaurants  More importantly ingredients very fresh if everything cut order  very good   The Cobb Salad more large enough entire meal  However mission having read lots praise Country Club Crisp Potatoes  dish consists roughly mashed potatoes placed small round dish baked roasted something until crisp outside then covered fried onions  order enough least two people  very good but die for  Don't feel sad if don't room it   Another recommended dish Plum Crisp  type dessert appeals but glad ordered it  plums both sweet tart crust crisp quickly polished off Armagnac ice cream raisins even though never liked its close relative rum raisin ice cream  <EOR> Came Sunday morning brunch hubby another couple awe  came Jazz amazing  doesn't love live jazz while brunch? mean amazing  staff pretty friendly knowledgeable  food delicious drink strong! price very reasonable atmosphere again LIVE JAZZ   I am definitely coming back  Wynn never let's down  Next time sit outside take waterfall view  place definitely must  <EOR> Our party six enjoyed Sunday jazz brunch  seated immediately although did reservation  modestly sized buffet seafood meat salad dessert stations  seafood wonderful huge shrimp crab legs oysters  All seafood served such fashion vittle wrangling kept minimum one wishes consume wear one's selection   meats included house made sausage turkey pork tenderloin  may also choose additional prepared to order items no additional cost such omelettes French toast  nice touch those aversion buffet style dining    I believe price $55 per person including alcohol taxes tip  No issues service  several seating options including banquettes chairs bar dining  all very civilized Sunday morning  <EOR> To Wynn most perfect place ever experienced   Everything always perfect   people food service hotel everything!
