If stayed TI again would visit but otherwise might try find something else just change up  <EOR> We first saw Senor Frogs youtube thought man whenever town one  Boom Vegas   lets Senor Frogs     Its inside casino finding hassle Casino might better time parking finding street   We told wait seated inside would could sit outside patio  looked each other its 45 degrees outside why would sit outside?  coming people Wisconsin  found later patio heaters outside  sat outside   Upon looking menu 3 minutes knew time go  17 99 Quesadilla? same hell? 19 99 bug    gotta kidding me? Then 15 99 chicken wings    yet its time go  high tailed outta place pronto   Maybe if feeling adventurous want spend ridiculous amount money replica touristy Tex Mex high jacked Traditional Mexican food might try again another state  Until then settle Chipotle  <EOR> This first time Senor Frogs pretty good chain  shared nachos which huge portion lots toppings  really filling  also fruit punch drink plastic tree cup keep souvenir  lunch wasn't busy all  liked sitting outside near pond enjoy view  prices fairly reasonable Las Vegas! <EOR> The chef awesome super busy he saw everyone going crazy he also serving tables everyone having good time great!! <EOR> Thursday night 11pm  think DJ deaf  stupid loud  Did he notice 1 2 People left when he turned bad dance music 11  ? if music relevant if people dancing would it    whatever dude smoking should hand door if want people stay  <EOR> Food ok  better restaurants charging half paid here  But plus side atmosphere fun staff prompt friendly  <EOR> Not much fun Mexico     Food ok HUGE servings always share plate!

Enchilada sauce some cheap red sauce nothing close enchilada sauce chicken quesadilla wasn't any better chicken dry just good tasting  would recommend place pricey crappy food <EOR> I wish would checked reviews before coming here! Overpriced horrible food quality    My mom both food poisoning eating sick all night    The carne asada tacos very dry guacamole came very warm gross ended only eating 2 3 tacos  only reason ate 2 because hungry  Guacamole isn't supposed warm! enchiladas mom she said tasted bland also made sick    The only good thing place ambiance fun look all signs ceilings listen music   Bottom line if want drink probably place people bar looked having good time but if want eat dinner good meal look elsewhere! <EOR> Extremely disappointed place  margaritas tasted mix no booze beef nachos just gross  Desperate attempt food  Treasure Island spent some money adding place bad food doesn't reflect that! <EOR> Nicholas great bartender  appreciated attention cleanliness  He washed hands constantly  Although alone he constantly checked see if good  just jalapeño queso Caesar salad  salad perfect but queso little bland  loved music patio nice but hot me  <EOR> I've heard countless stories Senor Frogs Mexico knew same expectations  initial reception Senor Frogs Yelp less stellar little less 3 stars  Nevertheless friend still wanted check Treasure Island's latest cantina  Senor Frogs clearly visible off strip backdrop Treasure Island Pirate Show   The bar club relatively slow weeknight visited  no problem getting barstools main bar  If turn around glass walls give great view Las Vegas Blvd  free show  server quick  bring drink menu along food menu  skipped food since just some appetizers Margaritaville  Drinks pricey average price $10 up   The drink menu extensive friend plenty options  mixed drinks stuck Long Island no sweet sour  bartender fast drinks courteous throughout  bill two drinks $23 including tax tip quickly way out  However did enjoy servers dancing music inside bar pirate show outside   As leaving discovered another side Senor Frogs where much more lively  Lots dancing lots balloons lots drinking  sure if seen way would stayed bit longer but ready head back hotel  Senor Frogs isn't bad nor great  I'd recommend coming group drinking bit before coming paying Vegas prices  <EOR> Great tasting food fun adult atmosphere! only complaint would service  wait staff somewhat friendly but all accommodating  tell almost immediately they've dealt many tourists over it  <EOR> On Monday drinks bar while waiting seated outdoors dinner   male bartender GREAT he nice sincere told favorite items menu  Seated within 15 min outside  Great view but took 35 min waitress come even greet us  40 something year old Hispanic woman  She seemed rushed wanted quicken Decision food  45 min later received nachos some gentleman wasn't waiter  kept waiting waitress come check could ask salsa  30 min into eating food she stops ask salsa half nachos gone  received salsa another gentleman wasn't waiter food all gone  then walk through restaurant find ask check   waited 20 more minutes finally just left thought would exact amount bill table cash let ourselves out  She rude obviously unorganized  <EOR> I came vacation summer 2012 nice  Food good  sat outside view beautiful  <EOR> 1 2 priced appetizers happy hour  food no flavor food actually worse Chevys  ambiance reminded Chevys  portions however really large     Large bland  <EOR> Shithole  only drinks overpriced but said would PAC 12 championship game didn't put on  Assholes   Skip shithole!

Good drinks party environment very meh food    Service  We made reservation probably good idea busy nights seated right away  server I wish name    really great  Fun casual but crazy full lame jokes  She drink food order whenever ready bill quickly when done  another worker passing through making balloon hats everyone no extra charge   She made some pretty amazing balloon creations!  No pressure however if decided wear hot air your head  selling raffle tickets night and based Yelp seems common   think 7 tickets $20 win trip Cancun  seem drawing every half two hours so  You're only competing other patrons restaurant potentially odds aren't bad we bought them but aren't heading south border anytime soon     Ambiance Basic bar environment  High chairs tables generally  Fairly comfortable  Lots whimsical jokes puns decorate ceiling  wasn't loud when Sunday night   stage live music none when   noisy side but still easy conversation    Food Tried wings spinach dip ribs chicken tacos churros  ribs highlight tender flavorful seasoned fries  Otherwise food very average  food menu actually fairly limited terms selection  two rounds assorted cocktails too  cocktail menu extensive!  Tons mixed frozen drinks all different sizes choose from  having buy free largest size drinks believe $35 each   frog's punch really good daiquiri  Don't expect garnishes fancy glasses plastic cups standard here  drinks very tasty!!  very average bar food cheap  total four smallest size cocktails two appetizers two entrees dessert $122 before tip  did restaurant com certificate which knocked $50 off that    Mojo Overall fun environment extensive selection cocktails which tasty but very average expensive food  guess few cocktails don't notice food  Good place if your focus drinking some snacks keep booze going your head fast  <EOR> Ehh fan place but group opted come food drinks located inside TI  BAD service! no bueno server could better Ate pulled pork sandwich fries which tasted okay along wings which basic When left during dinner use outside restroom located casino host bar club line made re enter dining through other side which farther out   just because nightlife long line= weak service DJ spinning great during early evening fun ambiance patrons eating drinking but then later worse empty dance floor once cleared dining tables chairs   most people left stamped when dining avoid cover re entry Side Bartender rude when tried upstairs but open yet screamed anger   calm down lady Dead crowd once dinner over try club but barely any people even downstairs nor upstairs Upstairs outdoor patio spacious inside second floor Latin Spanish music primarily playing reggateon salsa music Senor Frog vibes Overall better places when Vegas would recommend skipping Senor Frog's just saving when Mexico  <EOR> Absolutely embarrassing   Waiting hold reservation 2pm Tuesday over 39 minutes   able walk restaurant before off hold   When arrived hostess stand no over 10 minutes   took initiative sat open table whole party kicked immediately     This place embarrassment Las Vegas should removed immediately  <EOR> The drinks delicious food but service super slow  queso BANGIN nachos too  Definitely recommend if you're willing wait kill time  Plus yard drinks ya super drunk  <EOR> I spent whole weekend here  Food party!!!  The food OK   Nothing special it  definitely bit expensive side being did well tables outside didn't mind    The club side different beast!!!  Cover charge changes depending busy day is   day $11 next $33  two floors three dance floors all your dancing needs   The only negative thing say Señor Frogs need more bartender per station  If want mixed drink you'll wait very long time   Overall fun place hang in  <EOR> another establishment Vegas doesn't understand service  stayed front right where should seated took 10 minutes just them come seat even though only people standing there  obviously just laugh because if can't see people timely manner rest service be  <EOR> Awful service  Bartender outside adds alcohol slushy drink  Inside more expensive doesn't add alcohol  Pours straight machine which virtually no alcohol  Rip off!!!!! <EOR> Love place   Such fun spot food good too  really atmosphere drinks   margaritas great  love all Mexican beer quesadillas tacos amazing   layout allows inside yet outside same time  right strip slow people watch! <EOR> I Carne Asada disappointed  Carne Asada good just portions small  $30 meal without drink  don't think S?nor Frog    to much $ amount food   O don't sit bar dirty  don't think clean drink wells     catchup mustard hot sauce keep them all stuck place     Totally Gross    <EOR> This place very understaffed   almost walked becuase took almost 20 minutes server just come over take drink orders   would suggest place vegans   stated could veggie burrito vegan but case   such horrible stomach pains meal just happened right before show   Very disappointed  <EOR> This pretty big cantina style bar restaurant which looks pretty fun brightly colored decorations crazy drink concoctions top 40 music blasting background  Unfortunately during day wasn't lively but sure crazy night   They buy deal boyfriend two yards $33 bucks  drinks jungle juice don't think such good deal haha  deal applies all drinks beer daiquiri shots   whatever your liver desires   The menu seems expensive Americanized Mexican food didn't bother  would come back but night buzzy mindset  sure gets crazy night would come back check out  <EOR> Very limited menu    Very expensive   The chips come bag cheese dip outrageous   Figured sharing Fajitas would fun but course chinsy meat overloaded platter onions loss   fajita itself actually good waiter also nice    <EOR> Well    Now keep mind     fine dining server 14 years pretty darn good that  really wish could find other hospitality staff dedicated guest am own guests  Definitely couldn't find here  Let tell happened   Not much say besides place HORRIBLE  Vegas alone craving some shrimp fajitas  When walked asked hostess if could seated outside  She asked many people? replied Just me  She said There's bar outside where order food  sit if want  replied umm can't table outside?

Guys paid 33$ ridiculous amount honest! only gave 4 stars because WAY CROWDED! need bigger spot especially because ok Vegas strip seemed only Mexican regional second dance floor English music!! dancing annoying bumping into people non stop!!  but maybe only because NYE but would definitely back again! <EOR> I absolute blast Senor Frogs girlfriends  spring break special perfect food perfect way start vacation! <EOR> This review takes into account fact $24 Groupon $40 worth food  Otherwise meals WAY expensive get    Both meals fairly good  Chicken Quesadilla $17 which featured actual cheese filled all way edges tortilla  unlike some places where you're eating JUST tortilla until middle  chicken little dry but enough ruin meal   My fiancee ordered beef nachos $19 which came REAL cheese instead nasty cheese like sauce  impressive considering gimmicky type restaurant  time she help down bottom plate plenty cheese meat leftover  didn't eat bunch plain chips nothing them  nachos also layered refried beans which added nice touch   Food wise guacamole low point  way oniony relied its taste   The atmosphere pretty cool give points but don't think I'd come back without Groupon   The food isn't terrible but just doesn't live price tag  fact sure anyone's nachos quesadillas would  If you're going dine sure find deal online otherwise you're overpaying  <EOR> Just waked never before  Looking forward experience  Hostess begrudgingly tried find table walked table then said sorry guess there's no server sit bar said didn't want to   Walked out  never back  <EOR> I expecting average bar food but Senor Frog's provided surprisingly tasty food  prices high anywhere Vegas but food well worth it  veggie burrito zucchini squash excellently cooked balsamic salad dressing really enhances things  If you're looking quick tasty lunch look no further    Pro Tip If you're really hungry restaurant easy find unlike some restaurants which hidden casinos  <EOR> Worst restaurant Strip far  felt robbed eating here  Most places Strip overpriced but would ok if food least ok  paid $20 simple quesadilla without any flavor no sides made worst food quality  Wife burrito $20 even worse  should gone Baja Fresh paid less $10 better food  Never coming back worst food experience whole life  Would give less star but possible here  <EOR> I tried place very first time friday memorial day weekend  having front treasure island casino holiday weekend relatively empty during prime time vegas hours    I believe reason because charging $10 door  music mediocre bar tending service okay  Drinks served ok but just lack certain element considered somewhere fun las Vegas  found no restroom drinks expensive glad only relatively short time  Try going somewhere suggestion you  <EOR> We two drink reasonable but $18 only 3 tacos? Don't wrong food delicious just enough bang your buck  <EOR> I lunch Friday  lousy overpriced  friend ordered drinks same time  Pretty immediately smoothie FLY it  When mentioned waitress she didn't say sorry she just grabbed kept walking  stop say please don't try give another just want water! Meanwhile friend ordered Pepsi didn't receive until food even though she mentioned 3 wait staff    Our food good but complete meal! ended going somewhere else right afterwards more food  ended paying $18 meal all 3 tacos very good but unsatisfying! Even strip meal expensive got! could gone Taco Bell gotten 3 tacos less $3  But wait would missed Emcee walking around trying tourists take shots which pretty sure no over course 40 minutes did  right Senor Frogs glad paid $15 markup hear pathetic Emcee attempt rile crowds into drinking    <EOR> The reason wife ate because already wandering around strip few hours just happened Treasure Island starving!  Even under those circumstances if could take back would   starters no outside drinks   purchased daiquiri bar upstairs just 5 minutes before same hotel chug in   Why hell can't take drink inside purchased SAME HOTEL restaurant?!?!?  Oh know spend more money your restaurant!!!  Then food very expensive fairly mediocre   $17 average burger fries? methinks not   chugging daiquiri having pretty good buzz going you'd think food would taste better   top service just horrible   Pretty much long you're drinking don't exist   understand getting drunk spending ridiculous amount money your restaurant but am still customer   table right next drinking waiter pretty much never left side   few times waiter wasn't hostess some random chick making balloon hats stood awkwardly waiting tip   Senor Frog's clearly just your money swim clear place unless plan getting hammered then all means entire staff your feet   ALL WANTED BALLOON HAT!!! P S  wife upset stomach next couple hours <EOR> I'm giving place 2 star review mainly because if Vegas many better places stop here  food mediocre BEST came cold took long time    prices drink food outrageous service poor probably because couldn't hear over blaring loud music ! only thing going them funny quotes wall ceiling   If already drunk might tolerable place otherwise advice would skip ! <EOR> Bartender hooked up    hesitant coming but very good time     <EOR> Highly impressed service but 3 off staff came sure dinner okay cook    I crispy chicken sandwich came fries cool looking wire basket  love fries crispy we're perfect me  sandwich delicious every bite bite heaven crispy tender spicy mayo  would definitely recommend giving senor frog try  <EOR> This review Drag Show Brunch Señor Frogs only   This show amazing!!!

Stayed Venetian local place perfect decor interesting fun but least time unmatched staff patrons  Portions small expensive even Vegas standards    very good Mexican food left still hungry   Service adequate but again Vegas standards very sub par   server would take order then walk back talk 3 other servers 20 min   really annoyed but just sort amazed given other experiences strip restaurants   all left some regrets wasting vacation meal here    Glad tried once because curious but never back  Way many other fun places Vegas good food try! If Las Vegas limited time would advise try another place   just seems nothing special place other overlooking pirate show night  <EOR> Drag brunch must  ladies hilarious unlimited mimosas well worth cost  buffet nothing brag but let's honest   you're paying more entertainment mimosas  <EOR> We busy night hard believe busy outside deck view Treasure Island pirate show which if time right seen your table  inside restaurant busy because hour long wait table decided grab table outside near bar but also could watch show  When sitting bar grabbed menus take table  did expect table service bar area planed pick food drink bar take table  bartender BENHAM he awesome  Once he noticed doing Without asking he came around bar came table only take order but also bring food check through meal  AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE  Benham helpful friendly funny service received exceptional  Rarely personal connection when visiting establishment first however experience received only earned respect but also established loyalty  came good time exactly that  return next time am Vegas back since  <EOR> The only reason gets 1 star because two drinks price one  Which still because $40 drink!
