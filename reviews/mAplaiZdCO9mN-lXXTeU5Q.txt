Quiznos Quiznos another reviewer said   If Quiznos you'll love location   staff friendly if you're regular works downtown they'll know remember your order   staff super nice very quick even crazy crowds downtown juries lawyers court staff   My personal favorite flat bread sandwiches soup but salads good well  <EOR> It's Quiznos   mediocre food   conveniently downtown   Convenient mediocrity gets eaten  <EOR> ** closed ** While despise most chain sammie spots when you've hosed your regular deli few times City Centre Cafe sometimes change good  quick comparison Quiznos actually provides better salads sammies soups over CCC sad really   Supporting local biz? Good  Eating sub par deli food? Bad  Provided ignore pre sliced meat comes bag 'wiches aren't worst  Customize way want watch all toasted you're golden  reason low er star rating bc little things iced tea soups typically empty running never refilled  Also hours funky they're closed weekends  <EOR> This Quiznos A OK use yelp's own rubric   Quiznos Quiznos while its favorite sandwich place pinch   case its near where am regularly work its easy walk if want flee building few minutes some air some lunch   couple sandwiches all which fine  Nothing write home but decent toasty goodness  There's nothing particularly awful but also nothing  likely blow away food wise   Service always good though friendly helpful folks your sandwich order quickly smile  Can't that  <EOR> I'm sure if just location any other Quiznos but today came new Mac Cheese pasta bowl seafood lobster highly disappointed  When think Mac Cheese would think cheesy  seemed only cheese saw tasted cheese sprinkled top  eating plain pasta seafood top sprinkled cheese baked  location good but product highly highly disappointing  Now wondering if just forgot pasta Mac Cheese ???
