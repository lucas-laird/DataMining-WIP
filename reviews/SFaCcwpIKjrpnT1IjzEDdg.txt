Clean place great food excellent service   price bad all  Just best place find <EOR> Was dinner also ordered meals delivered hotel  food cooked well  shawarma sandwich nice meal  kebab portion smaller portion size  prices high  place plain clean  Service quick efficient <EOR> Jerusalem Grill used great food before remodel  used lot while Vegas  Last night brother visited place some dinner both extremely disappointed quality food   Positives Shakshuka pretty good even though bit salty  warm pita excellent   Negatives Shawarma priciest worst had  made traditionally stacks very chewy fresh all  salad didn't even dressing them  Just some iceberg lettuce tomato cucumber onions  Seasoned fries clearly old  top off when mentioned waitress she insisted shawarma really good no ever problems it  find very hard believe   It really unfortunate place used gem far kosher food Vegas turned into such low quality place   only reason why doesn't lower score because pita shakshuka  <EOR> Everything absolutely delicious service great!! Cute waiters funny your order right     can't wrong that!!! asked waiter's recommendation he gave recommendations life  cute! Anyway Jerusalem Grill Mix which awesome came beef kabob chicken skewers chicken shawarma  never life such delicious chicken juicy moist tasted great! also shared unlimited salad combos 2 friends great! assortment 12 salad platters keep coming long still room it  cool able try all different types dishes  found lot new items loved! Finally if stop recommend mango juice your drink  far tastiest mango juice ever had!!!   Hope helps! highly recommend coming back myself whenever am town!! <EOR> The food good service good also shawarma little dry bat rest good also order hommos Whit mushroom amizing    <EOR> Jerusalem grill quality fine dining meditarinian cuisine  The food service excellent environment warm friendly    Very recommended !!! <EOR> I wanted nice place Vegas good kosher dinner bf  BUt vegas doesnt any nice fancy kosher places  ended coming here  interior nice modern  workers nice friendly  All reviews saying place always packed food good but honestly feel paid write those reviews  place EMPTY when walked thursday night They 20 oz tomahawk steak menu which really only reason came cause bf wanted good steak dinner  ask waiter steak he says its amazing steak  Its very lean no fat no bone  steak must  bf gets steak ordered Salmon which claimed baked salmon  french fries tabbouleh side dishes  starving!! place doesnt give any break when come any pre meal treat  But should  When food finally came presentation steak die least thought was  cutting board small salad next it  Looked very nice presentable  bf started eating notice cutting MUCH fat off steak  Literally more half steak fat  waiter came see everything bf mentioned wasnt lean steak all waiter looked he didnt know say said something oh little fat  Uh no lot fat  He back speak someone then just left hanging    My salmon just OK  expecting grilled baked piece salmon fries tabbouleh plate but instead salmon 2 thin slivers salmon cooked bunch crap around it  tomato chick peas green leafs some sort  looked if salmon cooked some sort stew  fries wet soggy whatever salmon  salmon bland no taste  only ate because hungry  tabbouleh tiny omg  1 table spoon tabbouleh which disappointing cause love tabbouleh  Anyways tabbouleh dry hell great  Its weird because when ordered meal waiter asked if wanted salmon top tabbouleh    would died if tabbouleh stew chick peas salmon it   Once flagged down waiter asked check he comes back tell hes taking 10% off cost steak which joke  He acted he doing favor  $6 $7 $80+ bill  restaurant could done lot right but chose to  6 7 dollars off bill insult  could offered something else off menu could apologized misinforming steak basically lying just order most expensive thing menu Anything would better acting fault  Does owner restaurant care people spending money establishment then leaving hungry? never come back    Good thing write reviews all places dine deserve 1 star <EOR> Nice upscale Jewish classy restaurant  Vegas last week week ate dinner every night  good selection steak house felafel house combined  Only issue prices very high compared any other kosher establishment  Also automatically add tip bill which did like  example pay $3 side babaganoush should free ask me  way would probably return since no where else eat Vegas  <EOR> I really wanted place    such go to yelp line! Stopped week day dinner friend mine  knew place because old coworker's husband back ensures all products kosher  Otherwise would very difficult spot along busy Decatur Flamingo intersection    I salad w chimichurri steak which ended costing $24 I knew kosher food more expensive but geesh!   Friend shashuka w pita bread which she claimed good  Service little slow later came find waitress manager  She some good recommendations pretty straight forward   Ambiance little strange  potential being nice restaurant until added TV w sports  Lots seating outside w pretty string lights but would expect service even slower sitting there   All all good food but pretty pricey w slow service  <EOR> Jerusalem serves moistest brightest green falafel  falafel may best town but need revisit few favorites just sure  15 all eat salads Jerusalem control  your traditional salads  more hm array one of a kind sides  some healthy some earthy some tangy  most memorable part meal? Biting into lemon rind soaked vinegar  Wow! <EOR> I'm very picky when comes food being said place nice clean welcomed big smile warmth food amazing!! ordered vegetable soup beef pita bread  Everything tasted amazing especially french fries good recommend!!   Well   came second time experience completely different  bad different! They many items vegetable soup untouchable burger came dry couscous cold and   ugh mess  Luckily second burger came perfect won't take all stars back leave 2 think  fair  <EOR> I've eating many middle Eastern cuisine's but far worst service terrible even logical wait much time your food ready seriously? food lower level but expected all   Stay away shawarma horrible !!!!! <EOR> Just left spot prolly worst experience    seated waiter over 10 min no came even water   people enough servers   food around  smelled really good  finally decided raise hand attention server notices asks far away if wanted order food   effing kidding me? said yes no surprise there  she says okay doesn't come back   sitting bunch fools nothing table hungry    They really need better service here   Food aren't cheap therefore better services   Please don't if hungry  <EOR> This first experience kosher restaurant  guest two good friends Israel always new experiences  assistance Yelp general idea reviews very helpful   We started excellent hummus warm pita along deep fried beef roll  name but cannot recall is   On recommendation waiter ordered Jerusalem Grill which combination chicken shawarma beef kabobs  ordered Israeli salad couscous sides   servings generous delicious   Service attentive but request refills beverage two three times   The enjoyment evening conversation friends but Jerusalem Grill gave delicious meal informal setting which visit   I chose 3 stars simply due all options Las Vegas that if keeping kosher difficult consider restaurant outstanding but strong 3 5 stars opinion  <EOR> Great service  No doubt BEST Israeli food Vegas  Lior man! Thank guys we'll definitely back! <EOR> The shawarma mini tacos excellent burger point crisp veggies spicy fries  also fantastic sauces dressings recommend getting them side  <EOR> Anyone giving any kind positive rating fraud used consuming overpriced sub standard food!  Service lousy!  Food tasteless poorly prepared   Israeli place screw basic schwarma beyond as example grilled chicken undercooked Israeli salad no salt no taste      Overpriced below mediocre STAY AWAY!  all know untrue plain fraudulent reviews   When read people saying place any good all lies! <EOR> OMG fabulous food!

Apparently simply cut 1 2 pound adult  size hamburgers kids   Strange but tasty   They claim food comes French fries   VERY small portions     counted approximately 18 fries per customer   perhaps small handful   true restaurant size portion   The best bargain special Jerusalem Grill unlimited salad plate additional 3 99 per person two person minimum   Sounds pretty straight forward right?!  WRONG!  It took two servers owner 30 minutes clarify      party eight two wanted unlimited salad special   But NO permitted   I clarify policy save lot time aggravation If want order unlimited salad special EVERYONE your party MUST order entree add $3 99 unlimited salad PER PERSON!   If party 5 prepare everyone order entrees add 3 99 top  per person     IF dining alone FORBIDDEN order unlimited 3 99 salad   We found policy incredibly disturbing   Sorry all single divorced widowed people   NO 3 99 salad special you   felt characters Seinfeld episode Woody  Allen film     Jerusalem Grill truly alternate universe  The food  tasty    fresh cooked obviously Glatt kosher     The hostess seated exhausted overworked frazzled little brusque   Clearly owners wife   She really needs more help   might nice welcomed smile perhaps cup ice water while waited   over 100 day   I actually felt sorry her   However didn't drive all way snapped when made multiple attempts order bottomless salad special   I believe restaurant worth trip   Especially if going off your diet indulge while vacation     18 French fry serving surely only 4 points weight watchers?!  Whatever smile take some deep cleansing breaths under any circumstances attempt order $3 99 bottomless salad special  <EOR> Disappointed  Jerusalem know its cuisine well  letdown  expensive well   I suppose if prices more reasonable food quality wouldn't disappoint much  But when pay four star prices two star quality hard swallow   Gave three stars instead just two because service decent  <EOR> Very recommend! third time eating definitely coming back  Best mediterranean restaurant town! food delicious staff very nice  <EOR> The best kosher place vegas Momlez lkol aisraelem smgieaem mherem pzza yoter tov barba mberashit  Mmliz bhom <EOR> Falafel platter pretty big  But fries weren't very good  baklava wasn't great over priced   Servers friendly  <EOR> I am vegetarian very rarely eat meat when sure kosher  chicken kabob given meat wasn't fully cooked  took back recooked lost all flavor  chicken good quality texture right  bf ordered steak wasn't happy it  gave discount which nice them     Two stars because hummus mushrooms very tasty  would recommend that  <EOR> I cannot believe all incredible flavors variety try all sitting!

Well  tough question but banchan delicious Korean side dishes falafel would definitely contenders somehow Jerusalem Grill comes close delivering both  No isn't some inventive Korean Israeli fusion spot but option adding bottomless salads your meal! tasty little suckers pretty much equivalent Korean banchan  Granted pay them but bottomless! Look beautiful picture  I never experienced bottomless Israeli salads perhaps am overly excited this  way some tasty numbers spread including plenty pickled spiced perfect egg salad corn creation  many! wish could back just eat salads  fact may try soon    The bread without question delicious hearty nice grilled flavor  entree ordered falafel pretty good  thought tad small bit overfried but taste fine   With addition bottomless salad meal little more might expected pay falafel dinner but hard place value those salads! atmosphere casual homey familiar neighborhood place  definitely sensed regulars service charming even if little laid back     Again mere existence salads may swaying judgement teeny bit but definitely think Jerusalem deserves visit least presence such beautiful vegetables just once  <EOR> I can't help but laugh Shmendrick gave place 1 Star Many factors into review But Anyways Despite Authentic Israeli Argument transpired during tonight's dinner Israeli Service great evening  Food very good   Don't Schmuck isn't steak house smart Israeli Mixed Grill excellent  really enjoyed Felafel   This closest Israel without leaving Las Vegas LOL!
