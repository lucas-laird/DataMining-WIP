However upset because menu clearly said acompañadas con papas fritas which means comes French fries  When received order no fries  asked server fries she said doesn't come fries  picked menu again sure wasn't error clearly said came fries  asked again showed where said that  She said Yeah know says but doesn't come fries  Wait what? Why would refuse what's your menu? why wouldn't correct your menu? made mad place  However friends shared fries no flavor guess saved myself some empty calories    For UFC event actually wasn't super crowded good place watch events  However recommend eating somewhere else coming just drinks  food won't blow away but drinks great!  Oh music play extremely loud  nice Mexican music playing but seriously yell someone's ear hear you  little annoying  Turn down bit! <EOR> I think play because place phone because tells everything place place read over fact bones actually typing because this <EOR> This good neighborhood spot drink eat listen good music! atmosphere loud alive! come dressed dressed down really doesn't matter  crowd mixed young older people  Great place drinks before night party! <EOR> Pura calidad y buen servicio!!!
