When added veggies soup cold!! flavorless all SALTY!!!! didn't come veggies side ask it! $9 45 small worth it! <EOR> First time trying place out  server rushed didn't say anything when he dropped off food check us  guy hair shaved sides head drags feet everywhere he walks  only guy friendly only uniform white tshirt he's refilled drinks asked doing   Spring rolls okay pho good  still probably trying other pho places until satisfied  <EOR> This ok place if need pho fix  Bill came $26 2 bowls pho spring rolls  bad  <EOR> Love location! don't far best pho town   decor contemporary also 4 televisions   staffs services amazing! <EOR> This place Rainbow just south 215  If brings visions terrible traffic you're alone  If you're coming 215 exit sit several minutes waiting left into parking lot   The defining feature place really open till 11pm some nights midnight other nights  if 9 30 great option some really decent pho  don't worry traffic hour   Most while very good isn't quite good some other nearby places  but enough matter when you're craving some lovely pho  standout chicken pho which excellent even let choose white dark meat dark course   If you're those weird people whom normal bowl pho much offer small size   Service spotty  Order number some servers don't speak English very well  Don't bother waiting your check when you're done just register if crowded take note your table number   Great option 11pm takeout  <EOR> I just live down street thought I'd check place since fairly new  thought service great  served quickly checked several times throughout meal  staff friendly food yummy  ordered small Pho Tai Nam Gau more enough food beef cooked perfectly  Price competitive other Vietnamese places  walked full satisfied  return again  <EOR> Disappointed! Pho Saigon 8 two other locations open many years  location newest does meet quality others  Eastern 215 location best   FOOD tried serval different dishes sadly good all  Everything bland overcooked meat noodles soup  most decent dish spring rolls   DRINK sell Vietnamese dessert drinks sodas beers wine  didn't want any drinks considering bad food was   SERVICE extremely unstaffed  cashier waiter server bus boy  took forever someone seat even longer someone come take order  came took order three times yet food still did come out  looked around restaurant could tell other customers annoyed well  server cooks kept arguing each other quickly became awkward especially since speak Vietnamese understand saying   did bring drinks utensils anything unless asked  When time pay cashier no where found many tables waiting pay turned he doing something outside restaurant server him   NOTE rarely give low rating review but am disappointed food service  <EOR> I've many pho places looking best pho probably ones would recommend anyone  Aside pho food great  Barbecue plates dishes favorite keeps coming back more  Love place  clean service great  <EOR> Great service friendly employees  Food delicious served quickly even full house! <EOR> Out all Pho spots Southwest area Rainbow 215 I'd choose Pho Saigon 8 rather Jenni Pho Pho Annie    Main reasons fast friendly customer service  prices reasonable  multiple times prompt serving water s while take look want order  Never felt rushed impatiently waiting service  restaurant large enough cater large groups  couple big screen TV's around sports channel on  Knights Go!

The place super clean when there  Utensils aren't tables normally pho place  server brings utensils order   I order pho tai which pho rare steak pho tai bo vien which pho rare steak meatballs  able large bowl small bowl they're usually $1 difference  When husband night hungry ordered large bowl pho while he ordered small bowl  When came food gave small bowl thinking mine  Hahahaha    I love pho because most places piping hot soup if don't they're horrible  best thing Pho Saigon 8 broth actually very decent! always consistent whenever Eastern location imagine Rainbow location would same  broth isn't watered down overly salty  sweet either! Yes pho places where broth sweet     Also if broth sucks typically pour gallon sriracha into but don't!   The prices bit higher most other pho places but lot  If you're hungry always large one!   Also egg rolls pretty good If pho doesn't fill order egg rolls! <EOR> Cheap quick service  Solid place Pho Dac biet Bun Bo Hue skimpy serving beef  better locations especially better spring mountain  recommend getting side egg rolls  place Sunday  crowded either  <EOR> Feeling hung over stopped new pho place order   Place very clean neat new   welcomed nice lady took order even offered cold water while waited   5 minutes later she brought order very neatly packaged!

The main reason return because if quality food serve cleanness presentation  environment always clean vegetable plate noodles always fresh clean crisp well organized plate  Service welcoming friendly  Although 'great service' fancy restaurant but among Vietnamese restaurant think fast hardworking knowledgeable   Although pho restaurant $1 $2 more expensive some places but think totally worth if continue provide quality food environment service  <EOR> I haven't even eaten food yet but 83 year old dad while pushing sick mom wheelchair   older female waitresses walking same time door before did   She looked right then mom wheelchair opened door let door close face   BITCH!  Nice job making experience horrible before even eating food  <EOR> This far best Pho town  another location but took 30 min there  Glad opened side town  always combination pho #18  food pretty consistent other locations  <EOR> I would recommend coming place solely based service  soup itself great when don't mess your order is  called speak them to go order being messed person spoke stated he would take care no problem  Then when showed he wants pay another promise right  no sense then argued read menu wrong  repeated orders several times which confirm repeating back don't know miss read menu when special order  argue care customer service just turns off location  should concern during initial order when he cared more being phone then dealing customer  would recommend coming place     Funny person responding review wasn't even there  nothing getting anything free  point trying would rather argue customers listen them   Terrible terrible terrible  If would stopped arguing actually listen would understand hear point trying make  <EOR> Very disappointed portion size left still hungry   Service ok  Taste ok great  <EOR> I came around 2 lunch Thursday luckily wasn't busy seated right away  ordered nem nuong spring rolls but gave regular ones shrimp instead  time limit just ate anyways  main entree ordered Saigon  banh canh  just OK  better lot soup much meat  Also no followed see everything customer service lacking bit  <EOR> This Pho place top 2 pho places Vegas don't know excited am new location closer home going located Spring Mountain Chinatown  great tasting broths other options non soup people there  pretty picky standards pho broths awesome place used back home Hawaii    But all know yummy pho good apps south 215  good all people live south 215 close blue diamond  YUM  <EOR> Food tasted same spring mountain location which great!
