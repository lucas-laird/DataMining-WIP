Why? Why   can more solid BBQ here? Vegas cursed some sort barbecue hating devil? BBQ Gods no mercy Sin City? really just don't it  But before self explode let explain     Bubba D's brand new BBQ joint located inside Town Center Lounge Sky Pointe just off Ann 95  super familiar lounge but know driving everyday restaurant inside seen its fair share changes  long ago breakfast place used bookmarked never try  According Bubba D's shut down due allowing guests under 21 dine in  Because share space lounge ceilings 28 feet high way expensive them legally block off area strictly 21 over spot  families children you're stuck takeout only  don't want fault them much location sure they're just working but really question why BBQ joint would pick spot  Even if bar drinking beforehand sure would've wanted spend much money technically just bar food    Much other bars menu larger just focuses BBQ  Obviously there's classic choices meat plates sandwiches but also some unique items giant potatoes tacos even burritos  Tons sides available although some only available a la carte there's separate Pound menu well  opinion pricing flawed kind all over place  1 2lb brisket alone starts $10 yet burrito potato proudly display weighing over 1lb brisket only $12  Sure there's other ingredients but small making meat portions? because sides separate most which order combos bill rough  only ordered 2 combo plates 1 dessert no drinks extras to go bill just few cents under $40  no problem paying good BBQ all now much meat but they've lot work do  Here's got     I'll start sides  All borderline terrible opinion  coleslaw packaged made very generic cookbook  No flavor all way watery  Potato salad just bad flavor wise swear put rosemary it  just didn't work  Then sadly most anticipated side all smoked beans probably worse  scoop some take photo but most container liquid  liquid tasted straight smoke water  Imagine taking cup water leaving smoker hours upon hours then sipping it  love some smokey flavor but whoa!  Hoping meat would lackluster sides dug let down just everything  ordered 2 meat combo chopped brisket sausage Lore ordered 2 meat ribs pulled pork  don't offer classic hot link but locally sourced sausages made just them  pick sausage jalapeño tasted just nothing  drowned sauce which most likely why but back sauce  Both brisket pulled pork seemed smoked great  meat wasn't overly smokey could taste bit seasoning them tender nice little crispy burnt endish pieces  Unfortunately ribs probably worst all  no smoking expert but seemed cooked high temperature way fast  outside burnt black yet parts inside seemed undercooked  raw meat look texture  talking pink smoke rings  80% rack trashed    But here's thing honestly say first ever backwards BBQ experience  most cases meat joints what's lacking but enough sauce them taste okay  But Bubba D's only place where complete opposite wished no sauce most stuff brisket sausage  sauce bad  Really bad  sure if photos justice but only thing compare some sort old canned marinara pizza sauce  thick tomatoey seriously ruined every piece meat all plates  ribs couldn't saved  another story  But even sure sauce either  weren't offered choice even though there's 3 menu attempted much off meat before ate try figuring out    I hate giving places such bad review but just bad food  friendly owners service worthy 2 stars but can't say same eats  <EOR> Phe nom inal extra nom nom because want keep eating   Inside Town Center Lounge if wasn't massive smoker outside would think typical Vegas Tavern Food but most definitely  not! Stepping inside greeted quick service vibe order counter take number type service   No sweat efficient don't wait attractive blond bring beverage   Food table sliced brisket sandwich $11 before finished filling green tea   Immediately reached BBQ sauces remembered Nick taste before douse    Needless say put BBQ sauce back all left wanting another sandwich!  All all back must come back! even going throw better Road Kill Grill    Basically Bubba's brings big Texas bite little Vegas watering hole  <EOR> When am gonna learn check reviews before blow money bad meal?  checking them see if just or    The smells coming smoker parking lot best thing place  other half craving some ribs still are  ones one ordered sweet other regular dry overcooked  They've stopped drowning them sauce give side instead but sure improvement  Sides another reviewer put grocery store deli quality edible but lacking  anything really special flavor  service good GF put only thing smoker good smelling while sitting parking lot reliving  memories last  good BBQ had! <EOR> My husband taste BBQ wanted try something different  stopped bubba D's  service good but enough back  BBQ sauce watery  brisket no flavor only way could macaroni salad down cover black pepper  displeased would never back  appetizer fried pickles those OK  Thank goodness bar happy hour going time  drinks only thing made worth it  <EOR> Dissapointing  Seeing smoker outside high hopes new BBQ joint boy let down  Meats all overdone dry  Beware meats come smothered sauce  ask no sauce sauce your own  sauces mediocre  ribs hard outside good way    Ordered both regular jalapeño corn bread  regular crumbly dense flavorless cake  jalapeño exact same piece whole jalapeño cooked top  Come take time slice jalapeño mix some roasted corn into batter  tasted Jiffy cornbread mix   beans ok  bit overdone but chunks meat flavor which redeemed them little bit  potato salad best thing dinner par store deli counter salad didn't taste homemade    waitress sweet hope she finds new job soon  can't see place lasting much longer  Sad because Vegas needs more good BBQ  <EOR> #500 review!!!  I've trying save #500 noteworthy contestant but haven't quite ran into anything outstanding few months being said neighborhood bar lounge recently ANOTHER restaurant ownership change since wasn't Yelp yet figured would honors    too bad very positive review   First all main reason believe continue having issues restaurant side business fact interior shares half wall neighboring bar which allows cigarette SMOKE linger  nearly noticeable today comparison pizza restaurant resided couple months ago due fragrant meats sides but still bothersome most non smokers   Before start food let first point GOOD BAR FOOD   just great BBQ   Let clarify if sitting bar watching game I'd hard pressed find much better bar counter food ordering selectively menu   But compare better BBQ spots town you'll leave unimpressed   especially given price point   I ordered Combo Platter Sweet Ribs Pulled Pork Smoked Beans Mac Salad  Ribs TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED blackened crispy dry  Bones BRITTLE actually BROKE APART when given little effort  Pulled Pork good though crunchy bits smokey undertone only complaint being sauce SWEET tastes  Smoked beans nice change norm but mac salad forgettable   Also tried Chopped Brisket Baked Beans Coleslaw  Brisket DROWNED sweet bbq sauce masked all smokey flavor hiding inside  Beans run of the mill but enjoyable   Coleslaw tasted raw cabbage water   Where vinegar   sugar   flavor?   And last but least Fried Pickles  Some pieces bit salty overcooked but most tasty well done    To summarize if area looking good place watch game some good bar food and don't mind smoke would great choice given Northwest   If looking best BBQ Vegas won't find here  <EOR> I Austin past few months work tempted new BBQ place wilds Northwest  came today ordered chopped brisket because sliced unavailable pulled pork  pulled pork terrible  Dry chopped instead pulled drenched poor quality sauce  did enjoy it  brisket OK only part experience deserving any stars but drenched BBQ sauce  Texas let add your own sauce  feel compensating poor quality preparation  Cole slaw dry dressing watery pooled bottom cup  baked beans little flavor soft being cooked long  worth price all  Road Kill just mile away something amazing twice food same price good anything Texas  <EOR>
