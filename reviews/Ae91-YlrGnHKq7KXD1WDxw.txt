Pretty good place eat burger Without spending much  <EOR> I am love place   randomly stopped vegetarian burger everything known man smothering suppose semi healthy!  Let say WOW! chowed down   all upset heavy handed helping fries ordered burger   choice selection sauces doesn't hurt either   I cant speak hamburgers but vegetarian burger hit me   even see exactly it  <EOR> I tend kill surprise hesitate write any sort lengthy review when eat burger sucks probably going no exception  Finding myself south end strip hour kill between meetings other day phone check anything nearby might new different  Sadly only thing close American Burger Works lovely Excalibur pretty much everything else directly around me  No cliffhanger but read if want know why sucked badly   The restaurant pretty utilitarian simple garage doors entry minimal amount treatment open ceiling simple furniture  menu equally simple your own burger small list meat bun topping choices 15 different sauces  Hasn't whole 'design your own burger' thing played out? Regardless restaurant if offer burger probably order however want isn't really unique concept it? fact website mentions bring a new twist classic burger fries combo laughable   Going theme decided keep burger nice simple could taste basic sample offer  burger lettuce tomato pickles Jack Daniel's ketchup Swiss cheese came looking boring imagined  bun dry difficult eat  meat also very dry whole assembly vacuum moisture mouth  How's nice mental picture? meat didn't really great flavor didn't help much either  Between meat measly melted cheese something very salty random points throughout well  tomatoes unnoticeable lettuce ok pickles decent  Notice didn't mention anything fancy ketchup more minute   The thick cut Belgium French fries flavorless almost hollow inside sometimes when overcooked  If cooked right might ok but can't promise much  now note special sauces horrible service  mentioned 15 sauces choose chose Jack Daniel's ketchup something bit neutral take over burger  When ordered informed would side which fine but when burger no sauce side back counter ask it  man behind counter pointed condiment ketchup corner next soda machine  told if  free sauce then would different sauce told I'd pay extra second variety  guy spoke no English didn't understand all place total rip off sauces  $15 12 burger fries drink strip isn't end world but quality service $15 12 much  All say place horrible  <EOR> I really hoping one  While Las Vegas last week really wanted good burger experiencing lot crappy Vegas food  Unfortunately place huge disappointment  only burger flavorless expensive only allowed 2 15 sauces offer  When surprised hear customer only given 2 tiny servings sauces server just replied only wear shirt   Nice  son shakes which $5 each just ok  When walked noticed other customers already present shakes shakes whipped cream  shakes did any whipped cream  experience employee sauces did bother comment whipped cream  need extra calories but come would nice given option  entire time ate burger just kept thinking Five Guys In N Out much better  walked away place extremely disappointed wanting better meal   bad  <EOR> All say rude don't know use milk shake machine mean if its menu should know shouldn't take 10 minutes  if u rude workers wish drunk happy here <EOR> I really enjoyed burgers fries  bun burger hard soft didn't sesame seeds which annoy hell me  didn't put much cheese pick all your toppings when order things bacon avocado costing extra  three different patty options  beef turkey veggie  and any them doubled extra charge cook each patty perfection  best fries tasted while Nevada hands down  only tried honey mustard ranch sauces while but sometime back try rest   For being sure tell breakfast fairly limited menu but understand meant more fast food style burger place just notch above McD's BK like  However think could improve hash browns since when place don't expect them re heat those pre made frozen hash brown patties made Ore Ida  If fresh pancakes fries hash browns shouldn't problem either  better off ordering breakfast burgers getting regular fries side    <EOR> Atmosphere nice  Disappointed turkey burger  hoping ground turkey meat  processed 'white meat' turkey burger  tasteless  Its ridiculous extra sauce $1 also  Fries okay  <EOR> It ok  burger wasn't best but place potential  The sauces cool but boozled some weird flavors  Thousand Island good French Onion Siracha Ketchup tasted funky  <EOR> This place really great   We tried turkey burger fries Lynyrd Skynyrd Lager strawberry milkshake     12 sauces! There many great sauces fries am sure if more delicious more fun try them all! The space neat old garage door front cupholders your fries! <EOR> I never take time write reviews good bad but place earned ire   Spent $17 burger fries which Vegas isn't totally line but certainly high side venue Excalibur   2 customers place including took over thirty minutes food while watched workers supposed getting food take break eat   Apparently he hungry two paying customers weren't hungry he was   When he done he came back ask ordered     After grueling wait discovered food itself good enough   Unfortunately within minutes finishing spend next 3 hours going back forth bathroom   yeah between service food poisoning kind sucked  <EOR> Food cold result sick eating there!

If you're staying Excalibur just walking strip give place try <EOR> The food great    but due   There many places area decent quick bite thats scavenger levels McDonalds but also royal wallet abusing feeling Las Vegas best steakhouse   Instead its burger joint   Slightly overpriced but very versatile its selections   ABX offer burgers fries variety sauces choose from   twice   Once turkey burger different occassion regular burger   Both good neither great   fries just ok well   If Im hungry burger stroll pass American Burger Works just might stop by  <EOR> Very good! Tried BBQ burger pleasantly surprised Came back tried standard burger day later liked too  Look huge fan Excalibur but if you're stuck business trip best it  Solid burgers would otherwise considered black hole fast food    The thick cut fries pretty good too  <EOR> Since staying Excalibur decided grab breakfast dinner here  BLT great burger great too! <EOR> I love place! Really big juicy sloppy yummy burger big round belly! <EOR>
