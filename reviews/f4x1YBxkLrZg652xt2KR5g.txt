Vegas girls birthday getaway  Party 5  Hash House highly recommended staying Linq Hotel extra convenient  Looking forward amazing day strip enjoyed admittedly delicious breakfast  When getting check asked if offered military discount  Yes do  Give ID cards off he manager approval  Comes back apologize unfortunately discount ONLY applies Active Duty member  spouses veterans  FYI serve too  But kicker ultimate spoiler day 2 party widows military members died while serving nation  ladies wouldn't give husbands them able show ID card said discount  broke down tears slap face reminder spoke manager whose first words defend policy stating decision but owners  Begrudgingly he offered give discount anyway but we'd already paid bill  If we'd complained food sure manager he'd no problem comping meal taking item off bill but God forbid 10% discount serving military spouse  Only 1% population serves military  don't think offering military discount ALL serve would break bank especially considering cost meal  good food won't returning  Better careful you're speaking to  never know someone's through completely ruin would've otherwise great day  support ALL military members families veterans don't all  Never forget all gave some some gave all  <EOR> So meaning Hash House fix while pleased find located strip! No more venturing off Henderson other location!  So tried few things before but writing review brown sugar banana pancakes! simply delicious!! wish ordered more btw monster ordered tractor combo shared it   haven't tried other flavors pancakes probably never since brown sugar banana pancakes super satisfying!

But dont intimidated size portion place where dont afraid asking doggy bag   Prices cheap service cool place opened 24 7    How could complain? <EOR> Overrated average food  Definitely quantity over quality  Long wait seated long wait your food arrive  prepared spend couple hours here  restaurant really loud making hard any kind conversation  can't complain service because server very attentive  ordered smoked salmon scramble thinking would lox smoked salmon instead chunks weird tasting salmon  pesto melted Brie other ingredients really nice together  just pick main ingredient which salmon  Pretty disappointing  If big eater recommend ordering kids menu  saw much food being wasted troubling me  Very unnecessary  <EOR> we 4 times 3 days spent vegas  best place ever eaten at  need try believe it <EOR> Meh   was crowded   Food may fresh some time but did come through way   Parts eggs bit tough   use knife cut waffle yes really     The staff friendly lively environment     Wouldn't way back  <EOR> EPIC FAILURE!

Heaping portions rich fattening food oversized adult beverages bright colors keep awake   Most waitstaff encountered doesn't annoy because read room  Sometimes party over quiet voices accompanied dim lights preferable while we're kicking off heels ready order whatever soak alcohol    Honestly sweet drinks always look pretty but anything Electric title doesn't appeal rum more rum bourbon etc  Bloody Marys complete snack really well scrambles which totally recommend  Biscuits gravy benedicts rate just ok because they're dense times  Lesson learned  Also blessed cooks ability bacon  always crispy       If done drinking then chicken waffles good  Sweet salty bestest  If don't want coffee they'll chocolate milk which perfect before passing out  Sadly Pepsi products  but forgive them    I haven't tried meatloaf never talk anyone else into ordering it  *sigh*  Service consistently pretty good considering customer base tolerate times  Special thanks waiter saved life chasing down return lashes peeled off left table last time  Sometimes tired keep classy <EOR> Service amazing food really good portion sizes bigger head!

Haven't any other meal but sure just good breakfast since there's always pretty long wait no matter time come!  The food definitely deserves five stars but rating entire experience knock off star service   think you're pretty safe order just anything menu wonderfully satisfying   Hand Hammered Port Tenderloin absolute best choice ordered just every time here!  take liberty sampling everybody else's choices though eaten quite few menu items   No matter order though sure comes mashed potatoes because tell those absolute best!  Service however isn't greatest   sort slow sometimes really really hard get!  always packed understand busy but maybe management needs few more workers floor actually help diners   four workers cleaning tables sweeping floor couldn't even fill water glasses!  servers also pretty territorial really won't help unless you're section   being said all super friendly smile lot kind realize you're being helped!  definitely bad enough ever say won't return just great people should know expect throwing there!  Make sure hungry when arrive don't drink much because portions enormous!!  I'd say share entree somebody else but darn then wouldn't sample more great cuisine! <EOR> While food really good should explain situation causes rate them low   I two friends split bill two ways   friends paid cash bill paid debit card   When back room discovered waitress Kortni charged account both bills kept $50 cash friends paid   At point called restaurant spoke Derrick J  claims manager but he neither returned first phone call explained dispute nor did he return second call following day   walked MGM just dispute charges still nothing     I made 2 phone calls 1 in person visit email corporate     nothing done no taken time investigate   As far concerned Kortni stole $50 cash managers colluding cover up      The first restaurant ate Vegas stole money refused anything it   Update appears corrected issue because transaction didn't post satisfied   However lack communication very frustrating especially visitor cannot easily follow up  <EOR> This location Hash House does look little underwhelming Linq but cares delicious! wait 15 minutes table two hoping find quick seats bar area but completely full   husband came dinner each going order dish   Good thing asked waitress portion sizes stopped just Fried Chicken Waffles share   both really enjoyed killed it   definitely heavy side but really good   fried chicken nice tender meat wasn't greasy   waffles nice surprise center     BACON   could waffle any better?  Drizzle some syrup side   would definitely order again loved savory dish   only downfall location did look bit understaffed bathroom far away downstairs   Otherwise pleasant dining experience here  <EOR> Oh my!!!

Looking forward coming back try more menu items  <EOR> This place holds all reviews! first time coming definitely didn't disappoint me  waitress friendly recommended split meal but just wasn't happening  ordered banana brown sugar pancakes which came bacon eggs  only able finish half pancake  incredibly delicious best ever had! If you're looking lot food place go! only give large portions food delicious! <EOR> Located LINQ having come likes Bellagio MGM Grand unprepared clouds smoke bumpin' music drunkenness somehow missed other hotels    My friend strange pebble looking object water peach tea left odd taste mouth  When finally ready order opted healthier farm scramble bacon avocado swiss though eye infamous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict  food good could but friend's chocolate waffle ice cream actually quite good waffle still crisp holding ample amounts ice cream   Wish would ordered something more exciting but suspect 2 hour later stomach would disagreed  <EOR> I came couple friends dinner last night Vegas  honestly kind underwhelmed  fried chicken salad because while wanted something little lighter also wanted try chicken!  The portions huge  I don't think saw anything come kitchen didn't look enormous  salad pretty good good balance dressing  But   the chicken overdone! dry stringy almost entirely inedible  disappointed  breast meat which very easy overcook but come on  you're known your fried chicken together! fair friend also chicken entree thought fine maybe just mine  Adding all asked red onions added came little condiment cup rather incorporated into salad 95 cent upcharge  hell  would less disgruntled upcharge if actually salad rather served side that  restaurants where absolutely no modifications fine just need know but if ask something added please actually add dish let know side! Is overly high maintenance me? Oh well    Other thoughts thought emphasis presentation little overdone  everything needs rosemary sprigs half apple base knife stuck into dish  seems theme sort bigger better idea  But  the complimentary honey glazed biscuits delicious! wasn't awful experience but overall disappointed  think chicken being overdone really tipping point  <EOR> We town few days friend said best breakfast spot course went  super crowded but quickly because friend some type card where didn't wait line   The food Massive delicious  chicken waffles  waffle fluffy little crispy  way it  chicken really flavorful moist crispy  friends pork chop eggs Giant pancakes few other meals 7 us everyone satisfied    The service fast friendly    I'll back next time town! <EOR> Went dinner stuffed meatloaf fabulous!  The reason only 3 stars return trip  back started glazed bacon appetizer  1 piece super flavor all rest blackened no flavor except burnt very dry  dissapointed say least  did share manager hopefully improved unless brittle blackened bacon  Don't let review sway going would again meal but definitely pass appetizer! <EOR> Loved it  Best place Vegas  Staff friendly super relaxed  Bloody Mary jalapeño stuffed olives wins every time  3 times 6 days  say obsessed? Man vs food challenge delicious  Benedict but looks dig eggs  sauce world  day salmon scramble awesome  Every thing ordered massive could man vs food challenge  learned there's hash house close CT which means headed ASAP  Yes wait but unbelievably worth it  <EOR> Overall very good experience but highly recommend split meal even if hungry   pork fried sandwich literally 12 inches 9 inches good half think   bun came joke small regular size bun good size hamburger   only thing pork needed something bit much deep fried food due size but very tasty  My wife stuffed meatloaf could figure stuffed until she found entire other piece meatloaf under other items  <EOR> Food great order chicken waffles grilled chicken burger  Great service lots people long wait  even food served  Price good based amount food give ! <EOR> The food want when want    to reallllly good  place manages that   Mingling all sorts food together wouldn't think should same plate  all works   Way much food person eating setting share your plates you'll want taste your friends food  So  word    Yum  <EOR> We rode bus Tropicana Quad worth it!  The prices very reasonable breakfast Vegas especially considering portions  If some reviewers mentioned don't getting much food much carb bomb then don't eat all it! last thing I'd complain verge hangover expensive Vegas strip gave much food    I sage chicken biscuits gravy  enormous really tasty  best thing creamy sauce suppose meant gravy  big biscuits nice fluffy inside  best homemade strawberry jam    The service friendly but little slow  Quite forgivable since s'mores mocha takes server maybe 12 steps seems involve acetylene torch  FYI bit maze street especially construction going hotel  place quirky fun character  really glad found it  definitely part regular Vegas routine  <EOR> We staying Linq only made sense breakfast such highly rated restaurant   Big mistake  The wagon wheel pancakes should dead give away  Everything flavorless including Bloody Marys  portions huge except scramble which actually bad no where near big enough  Why try making human sized portions taste good making ginormous tasteless food? Hello Vegas    Oh picture size extra plate asked coffee cup scale  nearly took entire table <EOR> The portions HUGE here  friend wanted since Man vs  Food since last time she Vegas hour wait   Tip weird off time 10 30am 11am because only 20 minute wait  Sunday 10 45  When left HUGE line people waiting lunch   ALSO text Vegas 227466 Total Rewards offers another reason because BOGO Tractor Driver Combo which comes sausage potatoes bacon your choice pancake waffle eggs  also ham side which delicious  upgraded specialty pancakes $1 extra HUGE  finished 1 2 each  All other food saw people eating ginormous     think split portions but charge small fee doing that   I would come back Hash House next time Vegas! Kind wish wasn't Quad aka Imperial Palace lots construction going right now Jan  '13 but oh well  Only con service pretty slow took 1 2 hour food but can't really $7 each breakfast $13 95 Tractor combo normally   <EOR> This place good first time  second time around server sucked engaged all  She rushed take orders food came way later should been  also wrong order food looked amazing but cold  better off going Denny's ihop then here  <EOR> Solid    Everything Vegas plastic    surprise    Much better average strip food  <EOR> Love place! much variety very big portions! Any entree huge share  Crab Benedict which good but spicy me  Also Fried Chicken Benedict little dry but good  Great service lucky right away  daughter ordered pancakes kids menu huge  return! <EOR> Tried place morning due hype found online did disappoint! My mom ordered fried chicken waffles share definitely generous portion food if don't eat lot if you're hungry would better share dish  chicken complimented sweet waffle very well which also bacon cooked into it! I also ordered signature coffee which delicious but bit steep price  The waiter also asked if wanted whipped cream waffles but didn't inform would extra dollar tab which bit surprised about  However server really attentive even though restaurant pretty busy   Overall presentation food service taste great  However say dish lot person easily shared  <EOR> Well worth wait which 1 hour! waffle fried chicken plate great! much food u could really share but everything sounds good end ordering other meals  <EOR> This place happens when big city tries recreate small town diner  furnishings comfortably casual servers excellent food pretty damn amazing   I started off signature espresso butterscotch drink honestly floored good is  If coffee even little bit yourself favor one   Portions terrifyingly huge though definitely consider splitting plate someone unless brought serious appetite along  <EOR> I always heard place MUST every time down Strip    One thing just say B G portions!!! Even sharing meal still full felt burst open  boyfriend shared #2 burger side french fries  GINORMOUS bigger baby's head! But delicious   my favorite part queso cheese just dolloped into if you're cheese fan burger you! I am disappointed thing though why gave place 4 5 wanted HH Bloody Mary really SPICY  waiter advised already came super spicy took word but when tasted glass Worcestershire dash tomato juice thimble vodka  ask waiter bottle Tabasco just Bloody Mary way wanted first place  ¯\_ ? _ ¯   Besides Bloody Mary ordeal server still great  He apologizes unhappy drink which course accepted he still polite great attitude throughout time serving us    This place definitely place when you're hammered starving drunk your time Strip! <EOR> Was excited eat tonight  late flight into Vegas states 24 7  check into hotel no rush come back downstairs eat here  place closed today some reason  Guy walks downstairs states kitchen closing  Another group next complaining well  mad!

Ugggh well ended across way Off strip <EOR> Amazing chicken waffles!!!  order definitely accommodate 2 3 people easily   come again because leave  <EOR> Very busy restaurant but food very good  Large servings price service pretty good also  only problem French fries warm hot  <EOR> Don't tell husband didn't give five stars!!!!  HH good  Well ok  act more love really because husband hyped  When you're married only much life let moment    I pork tenderloin sandwich he ordered 1 lb burger stuffed mashed potatoes bacon  heard food portions huge considered having split entree but being vacation opted being typical Americans instead  food came huge  Stupidly huge    The pork tenderloin diameter dinner plate but bun set upon normal size  Using bun cookie cutter trimmed excess pork could pick up  pork awesome  just really big    Husbands burger ok  really didn't any flavor really turned off mashed potatoes it  He loves mashed potatoes maybe  why he thought amazing  Eh  Mac n' cheese good    Service started great attentive waiter but end meal he disappeared  flagged someone down just he reappeared point attitude shifted  Odd    Would eat again? Only if take someone never before  Other just mediocre food  <EOR> Words can't even describe much would recommend place readers  portions enormous! point where challenged waitress finish plate meal would house  took challenge but failed! just couldn't it! Everything fresh made order  expect prices least double really would still eat there! waitress Bri offered best service experienced any waitstaff  <EOR> Amazing   must HUNGRY!  Bacon Bacon Bacon amazing   Candied Bacon    The portions unbelievable   Shared dish chicken benedict    Saw many other dishes come all huge portions   Definitely would recommend again next time Vegas  <EOR> Decided come because restaurant com coupon good reviews place has  took bit effort find place wouldn't think decent restaurant would imperial palace casino but pretty good  staff raved sage chicken Benedict    Nice presentation creative idea not health conscious stuff   Wouldn't order again personally but fun experience first time  Also ordered side hash browns extra crispy  They're really hashbrowns but fried inch potato cubes  Pretty good actually especially when potato skin fried flakes off love that    Huge portions! If place convenient want comfort food just warned pretty greasy stuff! <EOR> Curiosity major reason going Hash House Henderson    Being first time patron decided easy two eggs pancake potatoes  eggs pancakes fine potatoes nothing special quality quantity nothing more then grilled salt          My companion corn beef hash potatoes two eggs potatoes biscuit  1  hash made shredded corn beef meat taste but shredded way should used here  made  difficult swallow  2  eggs okay min extra large  3  potatoes mine nothing special but burnt  And 4  potatoes sneak a ly put  under hash making portion look tremendous fake out  5  Finally biscuit Large yes HEAVY rock yes   appetizing   The staff amicable but very rehearsed If heard word tremendous portions more time would left manager explaining menu people next booth  Tremendous Portions Made Fresh Daily Made In House over over over again   The icing pancake $28 00 much basic breakfast food   My girlfriend said she Sahara location before very good  repeat experience location   I try again but real soon   Michael D Cohen <EOR> Definitely worth wait! 30 minutes Saturday brunch! usual Chicken Waffles fresh squeezed OJ split due enormous portions! Multiple locations offer consistently delicious dishes however Linq 24 7 versus Rio  <EOR> First all everyone else wanted try place  heard fabulous things but never chance go  two months ago friend staying casino across street Imperial Palace  She friends craving breakfast food buffet said could try place    I arrived told hostess friends already there  She told and even kindly don't seat parties if aren't all but check if they're there  Well seated joined them ordered food    First all give food 4 5  Chris farmer's platter whatever called although good just toooooo much it  think there's difference between good thinking something's good just because put 5 pounds food your plate    Second service second   no wait   third rate  lived Vegas almost 10 years seriously better service when Binion's Horseshoe steak potato midnight special $2 99  Drinks refilled timely manner when asked refill waitress seemed annoyed    Third place way crowded enough servers  Come now   I've eaten Cheesecake Factory you're practically sitting neighbor's lap enjoy your meal your dining patron still don't rudeness stress sense waitstaff  way problem then management needs clue    Fourth paying bill took 10 minutes waitress come back  Upon arrival she tells between kitchen table she LOST credit card  only she bit rude side obviously tied doing several other things she loses husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! least 200 people restaurant anyone would've picked taken it  5 7 minutes later guess someone turned hostess hostess tried find waitress give her  hubby then hostess although waitress did apologize could tell she apologized really save face there  wanted take tip left her  Normally mean but husband busser he wouldn't rude anyone!   I give place two stars because food really good but just overrated  think worth try   and maybe IP location  Maybe Sahara different   and when M location opens then chance prove wrong  We'll see     So Hash House Go go management IP if want people  pay way much pancakes afford more server busser your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders losing people's credit card cutting people short take care others stressed uncaring attitude  4 farmer's platters pay waiter's 4 hour shift they'd provide better service generate MORE money your joint! <EOR> Huge portions  amazing comfort food  Bloody Mary something behold  Definitely worth wait  <EOR> Hash House Man vs Food  probably cheapest brunch you'll strip amount food get  towers towers food also tastes very good too!   I highly recommend flap jack granola blackberries  granola adds extra crunch texture huge pancake  already crisp outside soft fluffy inside    The chicken waffles popular one  waffles firm good maple syrup  chicken skin thick crunchy  chicken isn't most moist but still very good    The hash mushrooms artichokes spinach flavorful  eggs scrambled share opt gravy compliment huge biscuit    The food isn't just ok actually really good price size place deserving 5 stars! prepare wait 30 mins 1 5 hours weekend  totally worth it! <EOR> After reading reviews decided place brunch   When arrived long line but thankfully served delicious bloody Mary's  Definitely worth getting one   When sat down ordered two entrees share between 3 people  more enough  ordered omelet eggs Benedict  better another brunch place Vegas but best had  would come back but can't give 5 stars  Coffee wasn't good way  <EOR> The servings enormous gorgeous  very tasty give 5 stars because portion mostly  fried chicken waffles bad?

Imperial Palace?  Come now place even politically correct?  The Benedict tasted absolutely disgusting   enjoy artery clogging goodness much anyone else but just poorly executed   place few biscuits scrambled eggs two fried chicken breast fillet haphazardly lumped together plate drench mean completely quart sauce drench some sauce cannot out   Nothing spared everything just tasted disgusting thousand islands mayo based concoction   Even if Fried Chicken good would no way known   I asked if could change television channel over Oregon Stanford game yes but no action   course probably random chance server runners but HATE lip service!  If you're going something if don't want please don't tell if absolutely quick response time Las Vegas Metro would stabbed man back butter knife   If even think food going take another 15 minutes why would tell it'll couple minutes?  Ridiculous!  Must least 45 mins when put order when food came out   honestly looking back should just took friend's suggestion walking leaving   just couldn't tell if he serious but knowing long should know he was   I felt bad suggesting place good buddy gave credit card night   know lot people come first time because huge portion size which around $15 $23 plate hardly think amazing but doubt many repeat customers  <EOR> Yummm!

Service Once name called fought crowd front walked back restaurant hostess ask wait standing middle some tables full other patrons  couple minutes she came back apologized table accidentally sat another party mistake waited another 10 minutes until officially sat  other issue ran into ordering specialty alcoholic drinks having them come virgin?? ask waiter then them fixed when clearly ordered some house drinks    Price service hiccups long wait times just satisfactory food definitely believe little over priced unless something absolutely love  group person regular beverage coffee came $33 before tip person cocktail came $44 before tip  Vegas location alone pricey but don't see myself coming back $30 breakfast here  <EOR> My family loves going all different hash house gos city   There's inside Plaza freemont too    love food presentations large amount given us!!!   services over all excellent    Great place family  <EOR> Hungover much?

Tasty but overall sweet much it trying eat bananas foster alone dinner  barely ate half pancake    Thankfully girlfriend's [chicken] breast perfect savory item balance sweets  Delicious yet again very generous portions  I'd tempted order next time    Others ordered chicken pot pie meat loaf only good things say them  Even kid's cheeseburger looked decent large enough satisfy average adult  Everything reasonable priced well  Most items $12 $20  Very impressed   Food A **Tips Don't fool fills those delectable honey biscuits  If your name isn't Takeru Kobayashi you're going finish your food  Don't try hero son  Not mood devour small animal? better split something    Definitely me! <EOR> Had very long line Sunday afternoon but wait wasn't bad all    The food other hand sub par if didn't know far superior location SD wouldnt consider going another HHGG    The bacon waffle tough almost flavor less eggs served w cold  meatloaf hash alright large meatloaf chunks pretty good but still wasn't very impressed    Oh well guess poor quality food Vegas location appreciate awesomeness SD food even more next time go! <EOR> Awesome food awesome service   arrived around 8 45am Friday waited 20 minutes bad   server Lonzo quick knowledgeable   ordered famous Chicken waffles corned beef hash breakfast   Both did disappoint   Hash House GoGo WORTH wait Vegas Diners!  inside Linq Hotel second floor  <EOR> Famous its Man vs  Food choices just know man food win    I really enjoyed tangerine mimosa watching friends attempt eat food  Wasn't impressed salmon pesto scramble but weird choice begin with    Regardless Vegas experience must participate in!

Great flavors! love chunky heavy bloody mary lots yummy pickles toppings  hit spot sure! <EOR> The food amazing portions absolutely insane   much food money  end feeling guilty being able finish order   You're always going wait while seat which don't mind   That being said wish Yelp would give option leave 4 1 2 star review because while don't mind wait table takes absurdly long your food once order  know things fresh order but no way should take them long food out   But since love food much won't short them leaving them half star less think deserve  <EOR> I really wasn't impressed   Maybe because many people hyped expectations really high  But VEGAS expectations should high right?  Anyways ordered sage chicken waffles chicken benedict   frankly really disappointed bland chicken mention little dry   Presentation food awesome! However taste fell little short   bright side waffles pretty amazing! bacon waffles!!! Genius idea tell ya lol! <EOR> Really good chicken waffles   preferred original hash  Really good side salad too  party four really long wait only increased day noticed upon exit really slow table service  However Rick server very nice seemed he could provide needed once he realized getting antsy  did expect little chose eat popular dining establishment strip but every aspect water check long winded  Super tasty but sure I'd endure again  <EOR> Yummy breakfast!

Two breaded deep fried chicken breasts sat atop 2 biscuits bacon eggs cheese mashed potatoes covered chipotle sauce  messy down dirty felt arteries clog each bite  just way it  You've eat right away otherwise all all becomes soggy tasty could be  tackling heavy meal tap water wasn't bad all  Crispy Potatoes weren't good  they burned little dry  should've opted side Sausage instead   Of course major food coma expected afterwards  the host commented slow walking  All dragging feet left  Nobody wanted anything but just lay around nap  ate meal around 1pm    9 hours later none hungry yet  <EOR> OMFG   Like seriously omfg   I texted friend just those four letters least 5 times because place better could imagined  This seriously best breakfasts ever had  Ever    My boyfriend saw place tourist channels hotel mentioned featured Man vs  Food  Now both enjoy watching show but never opportunity try places where Adam gorged himself knew simply try place before back home  opinion could better   First fairly low expectations place because pretty seedy looking casino strip  mean never even heard Imperial Palace let alone knew such awesome restaurant hiding inside  Also known having huge portions which typically means food going just ok   I totally wrong   The restaurant itself actually very nice compared rest casino  really spacious clean play AWESOME music  Also aside your average orange juice offer tangerine juice  ELSE DOES THAT!?

Looking confused she shuffled through papers clearly seeing name   know because could see paper put down Jamie Jennifer she looked said oh   called 15 minutes ago   Ahhh no! sat right behind them definitely did not!!  think time hire mature people run front house   they're first faces see when walking    disgusted way treating people  <EOR> This place if you're really hungry haven't ate anything all day  Ridiculously enormous plates good comfort food  brunch full house hour wait ready wait line else check back during early morning early afternoon crowd dies down eating rush hours  <EOR> I'm sorry but no  If look back any reviews you'll find pretty uncommon against Yelpy grain probably because lean towards spots already highly rated they're highly rated reason  Additionally very rarely give 1 Star reviews  case? absolutely warranted experience Hash House bad through through    Star 1 service atmosphere?  I 24 hour contemporary diner vibe Hash House but service absolutely dreadful  Sure decent number people present 0300 Sunday morning but certainly wasn't overwhelming HHAGG wasn't any means short staffed  Even took good 10 minutes server notice we'd seated once orders put 25 minutes gone until server stopped very obviously realized someone gone wrong supply chain  He scampered back kitchen literally ran roughly ten minutes later 35 minutes total three four orders came out  Ten minutes later he stopped again only realize 25% order still missing  Another sprint back kitchen all four food 55 minutes putting orders  absolutely unacceptable every single metric while may understood if something comp'd thought clearly didn't even cross anyone's mind  mess  No Star Granted    Star 2 portions relative cost?  This place where can't complain  Opting favorite dishes corn beef hash pleased paid only $12 99 place could very easily gouge more  you'll see picture below pretty hardy portions left feeling though I'd ripped off  Star Granted    Stars 3 4 food?  What earth this? Let's clear corned beef hash finely chopped corned beef pan cooked potatoes eggs maybe bit cheese bring everything together  wonderful dish great things exceptionally difficult mess up   What received instead corned beef hash also see picture poorly mixed monstrosity  Lousy flavorless scrambled eggs side  hard flavorless biscuit next door mound poorly seasoned potatoes clump shredded rubbery corned beef sitting atop it  Nothing mixed together nothing good flavor all all colossal disappointment  No Stars Granted    Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  It's apparent based other reviews experience odd Hash House but off day poorer dining experiences recent memory town  chalk full great dining  won't back  No Star Granted  <EOR> So series reviews throwing during #transient week adventure thru Southern Nevada Arizona  several casualties   The only casualty came place appetite  came pretty rough night gambling drinking wanted bomb place grub some food came recommendation friend assured place shit  Let tell if all recommendations spot maybe forced push thru legalizing gay marriages  portions huge big fact literally took half to go box munch while traveling Phoenix  only portions huge but they're f***ing fantastic  breakfast absolutely die for  Just if all wasn't enough culinary geniuses behind counter made presentations gorgeous mean almost didn't want eat breakfast perdy! guess only real beef place managing pick ourselves off floor actually manage into joint breakfast place packed  mean ridiculously stupid long wait packed  ended lounging around bar tiger pounced seats came open   Sorry couple elbowed face those seats  boy came hungry!

If tone down portions you keep them big without being insanely ginormous I'd give them 4 stars  <EOR> Worst worst worst dining experience ever  Waited hour meal when other tables came way later meals before they ordered same foods ordered    Didn't hear apology all waitress which made more upset   she just tried avoid talking me   would never back <EOR> Alt store portioner jeg savnede min Lurpak smør på min vaffel fik sgu kvalme af det margarine de bruger herovre   Men vaflen smagte ganske glimrende og personalet var meget venligt <EOR> Its reputation well earned  massive corned beef hash poached eggs seasoned potatoes Swiss cheese Smores cappuccino    This real shredded corned beef chopped canned stuff going buffets strip    The Smores cappuccino diabetic coma cup! couldn't finish but pretty amazing!

D <EOR> Food well seasoned   waiter attentive helped order most popular items menu   He also kind enough tell item feed two maybe three people   He right!  portions huge filling   comfort food heaven   several types delicious Bloody Mary's   Definitely Vegas must  <EOR> I couldn't help but continuously compare location Chicago  Mostly because Chicago location located upbeat young area whereas Hash House Go Nevada located Old Vegas complete total opposite upbeat young    The food expected gigantic greasy delicious good precursor night shenanigans    However service just depressing  felt bad hostess waitresses  looked exhausted overworked service business way long  first waitress gave hairy water when she break next waitress gave thumbnail sodas  No those quirky drinks HHAGG serves just long hair dunked waters fingers thumbs used hold glasses soda ordered    HHAGG Old Vegas probably saving grace its neighborhood don't doubt plenty employees enjoy being just didn't served them  <EOR> WoW! Hash House huh? hadn't even heard place until friend mine mentioned he seen Man vs Food really wanted check out  Well first drove down other location find another location Imperial Palace  knew?  Everyone finally made correct location seated  guess food takes while since portions GIGANTIC 16 but everything pretty well    Man  no idea HUGE portions going but weren't kidding  think could've shared meal 4 people  Seriously  ended getting small plates having bites stuff each plate meal   You must biscuits gravy side! UGH  good  love biscuits gravy man loved theirs  pieces chunky sausage just yummy   We ordered Man vs Food meal fried chicken stuff  good but definitely overwhelming  didn't through much meal but wasn't bad  There's just much going on!  Our waiter pretty good did pretty well getting everything out  friend's meals took forever he ended just taking burger car ride because came everyone pretty much done eating    It's something try but don't think coming back  just much   Also end meal think yourself much waste  Eek  <EOR> Oh man say place true most def COMFORT FOOD!

No  Taste? Flavorful  Sure sage fried chicken waffles more flavorful your average chicken  give them innovation points there  Also chicken pot pie crust + cream sauce filling well seasoned using thyme rosemary add some unique flavor    Food Quantity Huge portions  Come hungry  But food rich hard put down whole large skillet full especially if plan functioning Vegas goer rest day    Service Terrible service  wait long into restaurant  Every time manage skip name claiming called twice  waitress last time literally talked boyfriend ordering he wanted made feel super awkward    Ambiance Nightmarish  Very loud  Seating arrangement cram many people possible you're literally facing people plates  hard stare your neighbor ordered because portions huge    Price Ok you're getting LOT food  But does justify $17 99 price tag? think  question am struggling with    So really comes down Does flavor comforting gimmick food outweigh long wait hefty bill? Questionable  really torn whether back but know much better places eat Vegas  <EOR> Loved place! Bloody Mary's must!

Channing Tatum doesn't love ?! <EOR> The service excellent  bartender servers name he awesome  only reason why rated 3 stars because fries cold sandwich didn't really alot flavor  <EOR> Although Hash House highly recommended several Vegas locals honestly believe overrated  large portioned farm style meals look amazing photographs but lack same wow factor taste  starters waffle batter very cheap generic taste and extremely hard  flapjacks batter definitely better but I did enjoy apple skins cinnamon apple pancakes  serving sizes also disproportionate because the very large pancake only comes egg two strips bacon  Also would not recommend fried potatoes all hard and greasy  Overall unenjoyable  <EOR> The sole reason because man vs  food coverage fried chicken waffle  tucked middle casino but see clearly marked escalator going up   The line door even when only 11 30am  Wanting quick brunch toiled around 30min before called  actually surprised did see more people ordered fried chicken waffle but when ours arrived people asking take pictures food  HUGE  Good thing only ordered fried chicken waffle between two we'd lugging doggie bags rest afternoon   Great place take people haven't been  <EOR> Huge portions!

When hash came looked absolutely gorgeous   then quickly downhill there   waitress gave disclaimer smoked salmon wasn't lox hot smoked salmon which fine but completely dry lacked any sort smokiness   just tasted crumbled overcooked salmon   cream cheese helped add some depth flavor but just lumped there   potatoes also flavorless   dish really needed some seasoning some kind sauce pour over whole thing   biscuit good though!    I'd think just ordered wrong thing naive enough come back try something else   But advice all you   don't smoked salmon hash! <EOR> Huge portions terrible service  seated pretty quickly but server completely inattentive  think she many tables going on  corn beef hash pretty tasty chicken waffles good  interesting rosemary flavor but both little dry  Also expecting ambiance more cutesy but dark diner  <EOR> This place always super crowded! don't take reservations weekend u call 24 hours advance during week  bunch celebrities typically 45 minute wait kind place     Buuttt food worth it!

Biscuit butter sans butter  Side biscuit gravy half volume gravy needed satisfy biscuit appetite  Two children ordered cereal which came large Hash House sized bowels but alas filled no more fifth way best served scientifically measured 1 2 cup milk   Good if want experience large portions twisted farm food but feeling high production volumes lead lower quality product compared other HH venues  <EOR> Heard huge breakfast options Hash House Go   did disappoint   Bring appetite share plate   would back  <EOR> Best breakfast Nevada worth 18min drive Vegas  new breakfast took some time cook but worth wait good things come when take time them <EOR> A must have if you're Las Vegas Strip   busy   Luckily wasn't busy when there   around 11 00am   said 30min wait but only waited 10min   Chicken Waffles   serving enough 2 people unless you're really hungry   stuffed burgers big   two burger patties   also  ordered Corn Beef good   good flavors   definitely return  <EOR> Giant portions very pretty plates but fried chicken Benedict other sauce that thank goodness asked side wasn't much flavor  biscuit probably few hours old chicken didn't taste anything  mashed potatoes good sauce spicy  <EOR> So bomb   pancakes bigger head and big head   Very fulfilling! potatoes good  mojitos must! mint actually fresh     The wait pretty long  quick though  Warning hostess seemed very confused when give your name   specific sure she writes down  little issue    Total Rewards Members cannot add points your card but if show your receipt front desk afterwards give points    We really good server  He seemed overwhelmed times but he still top game     Price your average Vegas pricing haha  <EOR> I always try see positive but place good all  First all when came long flight eat 5 tables max but host told wait 5 min  waited 25 min!!! empty Restaurante!!!

The fried chicken AMAZING whether waffle covered syrup biscuit covered gravy  food very rich very fatty just way it  <EOR> Does live hype?  Hash House probably only reason would inside Imperial Palace certain way does live hype   Expect hour wait when there  portions HUGE even though pricey would pay same amount buffet roughly same amount food average person could eat   Biggest Recommendation First timers ANDY'S Sage Fried Chicken Benedict light orange sauce top it    there many flavors thrown sweet biscuits salty friend chicken bacon savory sauce top cheese tomatoes great meal   Do regular Sage Fried Chicken Waffles  top fried chicken    yes might taste god but somewhat let down   This regular   Hash House twisted farm food  great comfort food but reasonable your expectations  certainly was! <EOR> My second time coming Hash House tried location Imperial Palace  tried French Toast   oh goodness best ever had! topped banana cinnamon cream w pecan maple syrup!

My friend recommended place even though am expense account away 50 buck dinner places thought I'd give try     I ordered nightly specials 'lamb chop hash'   First server brought giant honey covered biscuit side butter   eat fork really don't need butter   biscuit would tad dry if honey but worked ate most it   Which probably mistake because soon gigantic skillet enough food three people arrived   skillet generous serving delicious fluffy scrambled eggs did taste over milked but fluffy own some delicious garlicky green beans some cooked carrot slices sliced red orange bell pepper metric buttload roasted potato chunks four lamb chops  sprig rosemary     Holy guacamole*! *there no guacamole I sort made dent ate all lamb chops great all green beans great all eggs great good amount peppers few carrots couple bites potato   Ironically enough potatoes weakest part   I'd them cut smaller crispier   But heck everything else good WAY much food   This dinner $18 99+tax   very very good deal strip tasted pretty good too   Honestly I'd prefer smaller portion since hate wasting food most people strip won't way deal leftovers   But if come companion likes eat same food could easily share if asked extra plate  <EOR> So don't know 1am Tuesday morning Vegas starving  terrible habit waiting until very last minute eat anything therefore insanely grumpy stomach starts growl hurt all want eat something  Only problem even though Vegas place never really shuts down still hard find something nosh doesn't cost exorbitant amount cash even really open and no eat Denny's way Rivera gross walk ridiculous   Ever heard Hash House Go? buddy asks stand Bellagio fountains sweating humid air temper already very short fuse cuz sure even orphans war torn Africa hungry am moment time  Nope reply  But long isn't pizza somewhere far give shot  cross over Quad which actually pretty nice now remodeled doesn't reek pure tackiness top escalators walk into place  Yes said walk in didn't wait really long lines everyone complaining here  Maybe because mid week early morning no idea but those long wait times non existent   Like others don't really whole ambiance place  industrial? retro? some weird steam punk amalgamation? Whatever doesn't really work  various pictures wall I seem remember cowboys burgers but then again think little drunk just don't seem mesh metal gray paint  But whatever eat interior critic   How long think seen waitress? 30 minutes? 40? Neither those  Honestly would wager all 5 minutes before waitress table asking orders  Hell barely even begun look menu  fact little preoccupied waitress herself looking really good tattoos nice smile  helpfulness also pretty alluring   Now speaking menu which really whole thing isn't it? especially big which mean wasn't huge selection chose from  place brands itself breakfast joint decent amount offerings department but more interested something little more traditional  picked burger only made decision did realize mashed potatoes it  Mashed potatoes? burger? hell? Well Vegas late hungry live little it  Plus waitress name can't remember although wanna say Gia something that nice didn't want hate me  buddy also drunk clearly feeling effects drunk hunger ordered chicken waffles suggestion server  She said good most people ordered  She also said portions huge   When she said huge she meant it  burger came swear God thing stood 8 inches tall  much meat toppings crammed it  Yes those mashed potatoes took some space debated scratching them off knife but must put those potatoes reason right? ahead just dove right tastes damned  say whoever made decision put those fluffy white mashed roots hunk beef culinary genius deserves award  Simply put burger delicious  couldn't even finish all sitting however able take back hotel eat rest lunch next day  almost whole new meal  far chicken waffles those should win some type prize  came pilled plate some kind pyramid stack ready consumption   Oh those waffles bacon them  Yes tasty salty crunchy glorious bacon mixed into batter!

On recent trip Las Vegas each three supposed pick restaurant sure visit  sweetie's choice one  am huge fan breakfast places but he loves them   I pleasantly surprised! menu actually bit more interesting standard bacon grease eggs grease pancakes grease       grease which snapshot breakfast venues typically offer   I took chance Tractor Driver Combo Griddled French toast which basically thick french toast pecans banana some sort cinnamon cream sauce  say delectable? Since combo also came bacon eggs    Initially put off prices but once food came cost justifiable  Two people could share plate easily  L'il skinny women don't eat midwest farm girl sisters might even able share between three people  beefy man typically ravenous teen did come close finishing think did better both them   My knee jerk reaction give place 4 but since am impressed breakfast joints impressive compare apples apples pancakes pancakes? give solid 5   So yeah       guess leaving Indiana still finding bit Indiana way over wasn't such bad thing all   P S  Great waiter!

Don't let line intimidate you   soon walked escalator very large crowd  walked hostess which she informed would 30 minute wait which BAD ALL compared other great restaurants Vegas  Unfortunately don't offer pagers take your number down text let know your table available  But managed downstairs some quick gambling came back 25 minutes check table  long seated! Very prompt timing! After sat down waitress came immediately took drink orders  When she returned she pen ready take order answer questions  She able give great recommendations  location very busy expected long wait time food   WRONG! came within 15 minutes beyond expected  Definitely love food concept all   But really leave review service  very shocked point are  waitress consistently came back made sure good  friend mentioned ask waitress some jam waitress must overheard because she brought without even having ask! BONUS   I wish more stars offer because she really did amazing job would definitely recommend place everyone  Food definitely cheap affordable comes HUGE portions   sure come hungry friend share! <EOR> Great place if huge appetite! always share meal someone every time go  course chicken waffles delicious! But don't sleep burgers  4 Stars because service great portions generous but lack vegan options made hard girlfriend eat there  <EOR> Went based upon yelp reviews  hard thing yelp overall review broken into categories  chicken waffles because reviews thought just meh weren't bad just nothing earth shattering  wife burger same thing  far value would give 5 stars  definitely lot bang your buck  If looking large quantities food reasonable prices then your place  If want high quality pleasant dining experience would look elsewhere  Also did personally care decor ambiance  dark inside because upstairs hot  Overall would say bad just so  Service acceptable but nothing over top  If Vegas group guys looking throw down would definitely come back  If just wife looking nice date would elsewhere  <EOR> Overly loud drunk large tables 20 something males people complaining getting soon possible   Waitress blew off   Manager should intervened!   pleasant experience! <EOR> Staff great chicken waffles good chicken little flavor waffles average   Great presentation classic fried chicken batter may add lot this  <EOR> We came 11am Thursday 20 minute wait  bar drink Huckleberry Sin  drink amazing fresh blueberries but didn't seem much alcohol it  surprised when cashed bill boyfriend signed showed $13 99 drink ordered because could sworn menu showed $9 99  check did say indeed type drink assumed read menu wrong  sit down while looking menu saw $9 99 menu but assumed maybe because souvenir glass different unadvertised price  actually stopped back drink another day town ordered same drink only charged $9 99   so don't know happened first time  wasn't huge price difference anything complain but just wanted note others case happens often might want check your bills carefully   For meals fried chicken benedict crab cake benedict  Both served over biscuits sat top huge mound mashed potatoes  Both really enjoyed meals but would probably try other menu items next time  Neither liked mashed potatoes all but enormous portions actually glad excuse eat something plate because full  need note neither fans biscuits  never eat them never them  biscuits AMAZING  don't know put those biscuits but couldn't stop eating them no matter full was  <EOR> This place HUGE portions food great! husband tractor tire pancake huge! Bloody Mary's flavorful large mimosa very large comes leg cup <EOR> My friend Michelle saw restaurant Man v  Food she wanted try it  came lunch first day Vegas  didn't see restaurant last time Vegas guessing fairly new  Imperial Palace upper level  friends wait 15 minutes before getting seated  looking over menu Sage Chicken Waffles caught eye  stuck between Chicken Waffles Tractor Driver Combo    As called saw other people's portions HUGE! plates big food also big!  come final decision winner Chicken Waffles  seeing table next friend Jenn decided share  Good thing did because STILL unable finish plate! waffles thick fluffy also stuffed bacon inside! Major plus since LOVE bacon! chicken surrounded leek stick sage pierced into chicken  sage little overpowering but something different  friend Michelle ordered Strawberry Pancakes biggest pancake ever seen! don't recall finishing all because much!   This place very good service mediocre  took while food but think worth wait! Once again portions HUGE prices pretty decent compared other restaurants strip  <EOR> So much food! stuffed burger bacon mashed potatoes  good  don't think any bad choice's huge portions delicious food  Friendly staff open 24 7  <EOR> I saw place Man Vs Food he rave reviews it   Since everything see TV true decided stop weekend cause expected delicious food   This location located classiest casino hotels Las Vegas strip Imperial Palace   Asian motif along celebrity impersonators grade destination 702  located upstairs heard pretty new casino   Definitely looks new   My friends waited 45 minutes table   spent time wisely winning 60 bucks blackjack table   place pretty crowded accommodate big parties   restaurant really big saw tables tables people   The wait food took while I'd probably say 25 30 minutes   some reason fell hungriness time food wasn't hungry hour ago  really shame because portions pretty damn huge   When looked friends' faces looked if more task great meal     I ended  ordering Fried Chicken Benedict which featured Man V Food believe   wasn't good expected be   damn thing HUGE but much going thing flavor's just mashed eating slop   Fried Chicken bacon two favorite things but when combined just rich me   just many diff flavors combined into one     I don't recall any friends saying food great but maybe everyone full   saved half food later ate night drinking  some reason shit still wasn't super appetizing   Those fries Ray gave better tasting!  Overall wasn't bad but wasn't great   If big portions holler place   Honestly don't think wait worth but possibly weekday something sure lines shorter  <EOR> I come least once every time visit Las Vegas  must if you're visiting first time! especially if you're drunk hungover stoned sober hungry spot you! portions super ridiculous you'll most likely want share someone unless you're feeling beastly  Order anything fried chicken won't disappointed  also love presentation where stab huge knife right middle your dish all garnishes  Super legit! Also if you're trying drink cheap tall boy Budweiser 7 bucks  Hopefully review helpful towards deciding where your drunk ass wants eat  <EOR> Was impressed    had corned beef hash much flavor it   HH bloody Mary good! <EOR> One star being considerate         Went @ 5pm Saturday sat @ bar  Bartender restocking bar @ other end never greeted us  While waited patiently come over 4 people walked wanting drinks to go she served them before even greeting us  stop Manager take drink order food order waiting 10 minutes   Only 4 tables occupied restaurant yet took 40 minutes burgers 3 us  food decent but customer service horrible  <EOR> Oh Goodness!'

The portion large enough Breakfast between two though didn't even manage finish person could eat much sitting beyond me   Bottom line? Disappointing experience glad did come wanting long but am likely return  guess kind place come once just say been    Probably more 2 5 5  generous    <EOR> This place looks some sort old Diner Style restaurant  waiter seems nice but super attentive guess he bigger tables worry about  Fried Chicken Waffles tasty portions huge! also ordered Sunnyside eggs some gravy along but did try charge almost $5 little bowl gravy! crazy mean those gravy cost more eggs itself!
