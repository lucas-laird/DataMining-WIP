Expecting worst isn't always bad cuz might pleasantly surprised when good  cool   Usually avoid chain restaurants plague especially place Marie Callendar's cuz food hit miss experience more miss hit   However morning big group Vegas flow   I decided order California Benedict poached eggs fresh tomato avocado english muffin hollandaise side crispy hash browns side   gobbled down whole dang thing flash   remained quite satisfied whole day even though ended having late lunch   gonna back breakfast MC tomorrow morning well   Since missed dinner tonight can't wait!  The only weird point waitress filled tip total bill extra 15% since 14 people   loss cuz service very good especially considering didn't call ahead 14 people   I planning tipping extra  <EOR> The food pretty good for plain old kinda boring American food but WAYYYY overpriced   bowl soup water $8   bowl soup!   crazy   I'm sure why people eat here!
