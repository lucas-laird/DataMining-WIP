OK  Lol know busy restaurant looks sure wasnt that   Ok now food  Ordered Lucky rice fried rice chicken fried egg top  Mind usually anything egg da bizness  rice sure much ordered 2   Edamame its charred its good its  edamame   Eel cucumber definitely fresh tasting liked lot  Eel avocado good  Spicy tuna spicy pretty much taste chili powder since much all needs hint  Its chili powder tuna  Lasagna roll another hitfor me  But does cream cheese those dont wont this  But also roll took 30 min get  imagine actual busy night long would take   I might give place second try future  <EOR> I crispy rice surf turf roll ended having 3 most defiantly favorite item also bacon wrap shrimp never wrong those bomb! also foo dogs wasn't really impressed mediocre but overall food great! <EOR> Good sushi but pretty overpriced  $30 all two rolls dessert  funkler pretty great though! rich! could finish it  But outside very hard use fingers eat because spoon couldn't through it    I would totally come again when wanna spend much money dinner  <EOR> ATTENTION ALL FOODIES  Coming LA recent local area searching far wide only place deep understanding flavor but place provides instagram worthy shots food surroundings    This place exceeded all expectations  food amazing! boyfriend stellar nachos lemon roll lucky rice bowl spicy miso ramen since other ramen bowls   All dishes very photogenic delicious! service point every waiter helped even owner made sure stop friendly conversation  Being pigs bf love bring food soon ready  Furthermore ambiance very nice! expect see outside  recommend sitting outdoor area nice evening more importantly highly recommend trying place! <EOR> We waited 5 mins seated busy 10pm    daughter  shes only 18 hostess  seated  bar sign said only 21 yrs older area fail      better ramen then place  Pork belly skewed  good  Steak fries  $28 way over price     We coming  back  <EOR> I disappointed place  fan Asian food excited try Asian Fusion restaurant near where live  menu sounded good prices didn't seem bad   To begin let talk service  If instagram post would just say #slow #stupid #shameful  Our waitress seemed she no clue she doing  because  she new   she just seemed clueless  did result incorrect order being able answer any questions her  did ask recommendations but simple Everything good answer  When ask your opinion please don't give canned answer  ask reason because want real honest answer  Secondly food okay  opinion food supposed possession Asian flair stuff little boring side things  least  taste buds registered  hoping just caught chef off night empty spice rack   Finally prices  weren't bad weren't good  just fair  food would consider good rather just meh prices would seem even better   Would come back here? would consider revisiting if shake things little  Would recommend others? Yes because don't want opinion necessarily convince someone place  might it  would just recommend going super high hopes fantastic meal  <EOR> 2 stars its best  being nice  very disappointed food  Ambience good just food sucks! <EOR> 8 PM Saturday night place virtually empty   Only two parties 2 whole place   entire restaurant reeks deep fryer and did when left    large open air bar between patio sushi bar even open wall did help thick smell permeated air   Against better judgment stayed because reviews looked good   CM gives place 5 stars bad could right?  Well answer was Terrible!    We ordered chicken wings start   server asked if wanted them first otherwise items would just come ready   advised we'd them first appetizer   Then ordered Short rib ramen Thai beef salad entrées   wings never came   entrées arrived found server asked wings   She said should start making them now   asked cancel them since supposed come prior other items   She didn't want cancel wings spoke manager asked so   talking server kitchen she agreed advised 'ticket skipped'   does seem valid excuse when restaurant empty   orders piling up   any case should taken much effort cancel order   Horrible customer service   Now food did eat   am sad say found terrible well  Definitely very overpriced   ramen broth bit fishy dish water limited amount noodles bowl generic short rib almost see through slices thin   The salad joke   asked if large enough entrée told was   over $13 you'd assume so  4 tiny pieces hanger steak no salad lettuce just bed watercress mint cilantro few thin strips papaya mango grapefruit sour possibly pickled?    steak itself good but much rest more garnish salad   Sadly don't see reason return establishment  <EOR> What great concept awesome place esp local industry people vegas hang eat drink without being overwhelmed strip  Finally place side town great food  Mac cheese noodles favorite items tried  also recommend rainbow roll lemon top! also great selection sake service point  Congrats ownership  Highly recommend giving place try  <EOR> Food just ok service new personal worst We ate 3 weeks ago lunch rush only few tables left few servers just stranding around chatting  sat within few moments gave server phone coupon yelp  free sake checking ok'd walked away  he came back few minutes later free cold sake me  kind would order water ask few questions     but guess good way? few simple Q 's menu server didn't know answer annoyed asked he gave vague answers which made more questions  think He only working lunch happy he sat another table showed   Our food came wrong    he told would be because he answered menu questions little effort no information  thought ordering first place  15 minutes later new server came bring food half smile trying help correct mood previous server wrong food   Well food wrong again but whatever ate  Food decent nothing great nit hey pretty inexpensive  All while no filled water which biggest pet peeves  empty glasses edge table trying attention but just did realize them then finally asked more water she came took glass refill left fiances empty glass table? time she came back water ready go just asked check paid cash still leaving 17% because am bartender never leave tip left  think come back place until open while longer better service  <EOR> The ONLY reason even 2 stars food  which okay that    The service absolutely horrendous  Waiter came over took order never saw again  Monday night 9 only maybe 6 tables customers   all ordering sushi 1 sushi chef   math   We ordered charred edamame spicy miso 3 rolls  food runner maybe new? delivered edamame different table which sent back cause didn't order it    then he came miso ramen which again delivered different table flag down tell ours point then told edamame also ours  took 30 minutes just edamame 45 mins later still no sushi rolls finally 2 came then waited longer 3rd which food runner then delivered AGAIN different table  Which took ate course probably cause starving everyone else waiting sushi  told waiter he seemed he could care less bill left  going wait another 30 minutes another roll which probably wouldn't received anyways  <EOR> Went lunch great! edamame addictive! Can't wait back try dinner there  <EOR> After reading other reviews high hopes restaurant   does potential but disappointed many levels us   restaurant cool looking hip vibe   seemed very distracted moving tables setting DJ when arrived 7 PM reservation Saturday night   table ready said wait bar   thought odd saw empty tables appeared available   did give some free Apple Sake which  nice them   noticed boxes cleaning spray bottles counter where sat which found appropriate   think should set  better prepared 7 pm Saturday   seated continued move tables chairs all around which distracting   waitress nice professional but seemed little distracted also   ordered several things none them really wowed us   chicken robata very very salty almost sent back bad   other food good but again nothing special   highlight meal dessert which Snowball   delicious ball chocolate marshmallow fun tasty   see place potential   menu unique fun place cool vibe   just need focus execution service   example ask water three times utensils plates more occasion   When serve fished fried rice share m need spoon plates also   seem working some kinks still new restaurant   may try them few months service place better           other thing main entrance side easy see parking lot   saw many people enter patio entrance which faces parking lot then looked confused where go   need more clear people where entrance is  <EOR> We've driven past place several times just sure expect  Saturday night decided give try  sat patio perfect night scallop yum yum roll appetizer salmon entree brussels side dish panna cotta desert  Every single dish truly amazing  don't yelp unless something extremely good extremely bad  place gem!

Crouching Tiger perfection! <EOR> I couple month ago     Nice place  good food        My first time kind food place along no else restaurant bartender seen did want explain simplest questions      said only sushi once      free sample Sam's club lol I decide new nice place   with grupon     I just thought  he could more legit     I'll understand if  rush hour       But only costumer whole  place    I did big mistake asking if could charge phone  He replay want wash your car too? toke joke but did lough!  Good food nice ambience now know bit  more  may return  <EOR> Second time sushi still good ! But really confused happy hour menu printed all food $7 then right next regular menu don't mind pay regular but felt tricked ! feel fool!!! also just because happy hour don't think stuff handle busy hours ! ordered cocktails didn't come almost finished dinner foo foo platter wasn't good! very disappointed time came just saying!!! <EOR> This first time lucky foo avid foodie seeing them Instagram wanted give them try    From walking looks cool place modern seating updated fixtures chill atmosphere    We allowed seat ourselves which fine wasn't really problem  problem lack attention service received  took least 10 minutes till someone asked if drink orders yet  overall all servers seem uninterested helping  Working hospitality think just higher standard especially nice place this   When little customers only 5 6 other tables when servers should trying take extra care customers check them every 15 minutes   I think if just over manners would long way  simple please thank your welcome long way  only server actually responded thank your welcome instead k James also only server introduce himself    The food pretty good miso ramen best would recommend it! portions alittle small side   Overall think negative experience  would come back but think everyone off days but overall when work service industry regardless feel gotta suck put your customers first  Something management should really focus on    I'll trying again few months hopefully it'll better next time <EOR> Amazing!

Sadly empty martini glasses moved side bar another clearly more important attending two very hungry customers anxious give Lucky Foo's shot!! Oh well off Tokyo Boys where customer service food always finest!! <EOR>
