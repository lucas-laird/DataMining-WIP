Love place much <EOR> This place huge letdown addition being overpriced     We while starving lunch read menu outside restaurant which sounded great nothing uniquely special typical thai japanese dishes but looked forward ordering dishes already familiar with   Put names hostess said wouldn't take more 15 25minutes max   She took cell phone number said would call when ready   checked back 30 minutes later no call still no table   Another 20 minutes later now even more starving finally seated us never even called tell table ready   sure if may written number down wrong   So 50 minute wait seated already knew wanted  Salmon skin rolls pad thai mongolian beef bok choy miso soup thai crepe dessert   The salmon skin rolls fishy par friends used other japanese restaurants   Even though starving didn't even want finish rolls   The pad thai AWFUL! only good thing giant shrimp came it   Couldn't pinpoint exactly made bad but another dish unfinished   Bok choy good but badly could nice restaurant mess stir fry vegetable dish?  Mongolian beef only main dish good     After trying all main dishes cancelled crepe dessert fear getting served another plate another disaster version favorite dish!  The only upside service thai iced tea   Such disappointment restaurant should high quality meal vegas's nicest new casino additions  Hoping came off day server said sometimes dishes vary depending chef   Unfortunately don't intend going back find if  true  <EOR> Overall atmosphere good staff friendly pricing reasonable   seaweed salad good   much vinegar good mix ingredients   panang curry also good   Spice level accurate requested   few suggestions restaurant 1 much coconut milk curry   try cutting back bit milky   2 add more vegatables curry cut back sauce   3 if you're going serve curry then rice should included dish   Asian Thai restaurant where rice extra particularly since they're charging $5 bowl top curry    Rice inexpensive include meal   Other i'd recommend location worthwhile stop  <EOR> Wazuzu fave restaurants hit when Vegas! First food pretty good  definitely recommend drunken noodles brussels sprouts  sushi OK good   nothing outstanding  Secondly spot beautiful ambiance energy  lot fun people watching because view casino XS nearby  Lastly customer service amazing  servers management extremely nice helpful  Only minus spot tad pricey quality other foods offer i e  sushi spicy tuna crispy onions Cantonese fried chicken   <EOR> We lunch week Encore opened  didn't find anything wrong service  servers very attentive professional  food expensive but very fresh nice presentation  Northwest roll Wazuzu roll especially good  I'd love back again  <EOR> Probably worst food ever Vegas!! can't really believe actually charge money place spend 155$ lunch!! could eaten better McDonald's! <EOR> I dinner friends  There's no chinese menu but Chinese food here! Nice dim sum fried rice! <EOR> The food good but overpriced   By quantity quality nothing disappointing but quite worth it   The red dragon roll tastes great but 31 size would enough adult soup Tonkutsu neither American Japanese style nor Japanese traditional flavor  <EOR> The American waitress asked ordering bottle white wine    would bottle Cabernet Sauvignon Blanc right?? understand everyone knows wine but c'mon! doubly repeat myself case she wrong   Any dining establishment gets servers snooty might add introduce themselves pomp ceremony shall looking evening    and then disappear really should halt practice cos its irritating  Food fine   nothing hectic  tasted much better Pad Thai down local Chinese take away  whole experience bland much food    but prices certainly not  Would again  No  <EOR> We tom yum soup for person only Cha Siu Bao 3 baked miso black cod Cantonese sea bass  portion very small cost $100? still feel hungry all these   mention super long wait between appetizers entrées  taste wasn't bad but food way over priced!!! much better food much cheaper price Chinatown  Never back again!! <EOR> My experience Wazuzu perfect  staff friendly efficient  eat vegan diet enjoyed tofu green beans vegan fried rice  Beautiful presentation delicious  Wish some right now! <EOR> The drunken noodle beef best ever had!

Ordered Tom Yum husband planned splitting   Server said Chef split between 2 bowls kitchen   came table 1 bowl server took back split   Flavor ok temperature soup almost room temp   Ordered beef drunken noodles   again food almost room temperature   Flavor lacking   impressed!  Husband ordered spicy basil beef   hard time finding any basil dish   impressed     At end meal told waitress temperature food   She very nice apologized   She removed charge soup   She said fan kitchen well placed when blows cools down food  She acknowledged something looking into remedy   Spend your money elsewhere good quality tasteful food  <EOR> While Okay problems bad service Panang Chicken curry good but paid $5 small cup rice which barely full enough even 1 3rd Panang chicken   wanted pay another $5 more rice which ridiculous  they should least give enough rice match entree buy if don't want refill side dish then least initial helping meagre amount gave out   Additionally pot stickers likely pre made nuked microwave then lightly fried pan   Really good pot stickers    better asian food Panda Express sorry   atmosphere money expecting LOT more left feeling used  <EOR> Stomach loved wallet hated it!

just kept thinking 'Damn Tila's gonna blow mind some Pan Asian FUSION!'   but no  Far far it     Panang Curry Roasted Duck recommended Server whatevs  Very heavy coconut milk enough spices  Decent amount duck but duck just ok  Would've better if skin crispy placed top curry instead cooked but least wasn't super greasy  Nothing special though   Vege Pad Thai worst pad thai's ever tried life  Other slight sour taste lime slice squeezed heavily under seasoned bits tofu just blended all other bland things    Drunken Noodles Pretty good flavor  Really bad but WAAAAY salty tastes which saying lot since usually quite bit salt   The Thai Iced Tea however SUPER YUMMY!!

Stoopid expensive but amazingly awesome!  Good drinks show stopper coconut mojito And lots grub look! <EOR> Very disappointing Asian quick service Wynn Encore  first attempt tried sushi which lackluster best flavorless worst  I'd far say better sushi favorite Jewish grocery Atlanta  second attempt ramen bowl came super stale ramen  like out of the box stale ramen  place if you've ever enjoyed flavorful Asian cuisine another fine establishment your own hometown   Skip Sinatra's  <EOR> Wow awesome food really spicy! cool ask spicy 1 5 know expect of course prove myself request 4 didn't guts 5   Great service nice decor okay prices considering Wynn lists contemporary dining   <EOR> If craving quality Chinese food place  Only downside don't accept reservations  <EOR> My boyfriend Vegas Labor Day weekend   places wanted visit Wazuzu   knew Chef Jet LA love cooking made sure visit restaurant     We checked restaurant Friday afternoon maybe 3 couples which expected reading reviews   decided Saturday evening   packed   waited maybe 10 minutes table     We Sashimi Platter Roti Panang Crispy Fish Thai Herbs Thai Spicy Basil Stir Fry all recommended Chef Jet    ordered all but sashimi spicy level 5   must admit    meal delicious!  pricey    big deal    Vegas!

Again first time trying dish but fell love  also liked convenience being property  However pricing bit expensive side  coming Vegas several visits know cheap  did expect pay little bit more Encore higher end hotels Strip  Don't expect come cheap quick meal  I say already plan must during any future trips Vegas  <EOR> Not best but ok if want order your room grab something quick  All sushi tastes sitting refrigerator waiting served  rice very sticky  dumplings very tasty maybe just stick some appetizers  Drunken noodles beef shrimp pretty good but little greasy side  Overall nothing impressive being housed Encore  <EOR> Came Mr  Piano dinner away rest traveling party lovely restaurant really nice service I chose Wazuzu because Wynn restaurants vegetarian options  really hoping vegan ramen but while vegetarian ramen noodles egg egg allergy  ended getting Vegan Drunken Noodles Gardein protein  requested mushrooms but think lost order  fairly standard vegetarian drunken noodle dish while good wasn't anything write home probably worth $24  split shitake mushroom sushi Mr  Piano also Blue Lychee Cooler which honestly expected more blueberry lychee flavor but really more pricey lemonade  sushi really simple good but absolutely worth price  also possible should ordered different things   Mr  Piano Shoyu Ramen dazzled soy egg aji tamago which he described soft boiled egg soaked soy sauce likely bit sugar in case wondering soy egg was   think he enjoyed meal quite bit more mine perhaps dishes significantly better if you're vegetarian don't egg allergy but only review experienced   The wait staff really friendly seemed knowledgeable menu which really useful  Also ask right off bat food allergies whether anyone would vegetarian menu nice  décor lovely sat under eponymous dragon apparently giant crystal dragon's name Wazuzu told kid next table    Overall solid restaurant good place romantic evening if don't seated right next very vocal children anyway but wasn't impressed food prices décor led believe ought be  <EOR> The best thing place decor  All red black modern decor oh perfectly decorated crystal dragon wall    The food presentation amazing  plates chopsticks everything thought out    The food very good too  drunken noodles dish wife some sashimi which very fresh well presented that all sashimi needs be  So come drunken noodles sashimi   This place expensive side but worth going least once  <EOR> While staying Wynn opted take Wazuzu bring dinner back room  never done before but when asked more accomodating much much better choice room service   I opted bit dim sum myself  pan fried pork dumplings spicy tuna roll shu mai shrimp pork dumplings steamed   All delicious served enough sauce utensils napkins  Very delicious flavorful   restaurant quite busy when waiting order would say whether eating taking Wazuzu if want great Asian meal Encore or Wynn which attached via corridor   <EOR> Tasty Fresh Chinese Encore  We sampled pork pot stickers Mongolian Beef Drunken Beef Noodles    The pot stickers among best life  saying something coming Asian noodle aficionado me  would come back any time! <EOR> At first glance Wazuzu seems yet another ordinary asian restaurant tries hard offer foods various asian cultures marked simply being Wynn Encore  However don't fooled!  While many dishes merely ordinary Drunken Noodle second none  fact featured food network best things some chef ever eaten  simply exaggeration! noodles very Q all meat selection chicken shrimp beef top quality portion actually quite large  If fan spicy foods 4 on hotness scale 1 10   Depending chef chili pepper used differs  probably only consistency issue really affects spicy 4 really is   I've also tried few fried rice tom yum soup lobster  fried rice also well portioned but probably worth money  tom yum soup interesting but 4 spicy scale literally burned tongue off! spicy problem consistency      lobster which extremely expensive $100+ also mouth wateringly delicious! lobster de shelled fried pan fried garlic other herbs  surprisingly tasty!!!   Anyway come Drunken Noodle  little pricey $25 but regret it! <EOR> Klasse essen geschmacklich richtig klasse!
