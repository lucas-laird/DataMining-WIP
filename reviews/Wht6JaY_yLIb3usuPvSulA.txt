My wife ordered shrimp ceviche tostada tacos el gobernador plate  Im somewhat fish taco aficionado ordered plate 3 tacos  ceviche just ok bit bland nothing special  shrimp tacos melted cheese pretty tasty when green salsa put them   opinion fish tacos some WORST ever had!! fish itself seasoned soggy lightly  breaded coating but overcooked same time if any sense!! enjoyable all! Even worse each taco inconsistent amount fish because taco decent amount other two hardly any just tortilla full lettuce!!  even close being worth $10 price plate!  If you're looking nice relaxing restaurant definitely it! group people nearly impossible hear conversation because noise  live music which usually plus way loud size place  Between loud music chatter other customers all conversation lost unless sitting right next person    One more thing feel must pointed out    the girl rang check deliberately tried keep change tip already added bill because group!!! freaking serious??? wouldn't believed seen own eyes  $37 bill which worth value cashier put $40 register NEVER pulled change   then immediately started cashing other bills! 5 minutes wife cashier inquiry change cashier still nerve play dumb it!!!   If could give place zero starts definitely would! only good thing say server nice attentive  Other spend bit more gas La Palapa North Las Vegas which outstanding!!! <EOR> not good all  LA COMIDA no es muy Buena  servisio es muy bueno pero la COMIDA claramente no no pierdas tu tiempo ay lugares MEJORES le daria 0 Estellas pero no puedo <EOR> Showed place googling nearest seafood restaurant ignored bad reviews just give shot  Absolutely horrible service sure if due being busy but no excuses bad service bad service  Food average best  Actually returned seafood plate due funky taste  <EOR> This Islitas way different Las Vegas Blvd sure  food still semi good menu almost same but environment different  ceviche today okay give 6 10  micheladas great all don't recommend them  service cool but better  favorite Mexican sea food spot still Las Vegas Blvd <EOR> If want Mariscos while Vegas place go  far strip authentic Mexican food  Good service live music plus  Coctel de Camaron filled rim shrimp good portions all food  If vehicle want away crowded breakfast places strip stop by! <EOR> The portions joint beyond normal  ordered Ceviche Camarones Coctel de Camarones Mojarra frita Camarones ahogados empanadas de Camarones appetizers  expecting small portions but left massively full much all orders go    The cocteles overstuffed shrimp  did hold back!
