So actually place bookmarked few weeks ago since its far where live  looked few pictures saw 4 5 star ranking figured any place many good reviews need try  saw Vegan tacos but assumed just few items whole menu  vegan but recently trying some vegan food attempt eat healthier  found fact place completely plant based pleasant surprise   So wife ordered much food usual thank to go boxes very happy almost everything  nachos asada five different types tacos potato taquitos Cuban torta   The nacho cheese sauce fantastic couldn't tell wasn't real cheese  asked made told made potatoes carrots nutritional yeast plus some secret ingredients  would eat over usual neon yellow nacho cheese any day   The torta favorite thing again couldn't tell wasn't real meat  ham  turkey  hot dogs along tofu avocado cheese   Though wouldn't call Cuban easily equal any other torta ever had   The taquitos only two things weren't great other later   bad just weren't good other food had  potato didn't really stand filler taquitos but pretty decent being dipped salsa  If person likes taquitos more crunch fried tortilla meat inside you'll probably these  could see myself ordering them again if right mood   For tacos asada pastor chorizo chicken mushroom  mushroom the only trying imitate meat while far traditional delicious  Along mushroom also loved chorizo which couldn't tell wasn't real chorizo  chicken also very good tasted chicken pastor could pass pork but little sweet taste  only didn't really care much asada   also ordered asada nachos far least favorite meat tried  wasn't much bad but didn't taste anything carne asada beef general matter  Its consistency more sausage steak probably only thing wouldn't again   There also additional meat cactus which didn't try but guess next time  can't really hold asada against them considering yet find vegan substitute beef actually taste beef  now vegan cheese eggs pork chicken loved each but guess beef much harder pull off   The prices par any other Mexican place you'd though thought torta $10 little high despite good was  nachos other hand $5 option add meat $1 fantastic deal   Even if your vegan but enjoy Mexican food highly recommend coming here  If vegan then place must  <EOR> Oh goddddddd best vegan carne asada fries ever  them 4 times now  Thankfully they're right around corner complex order them whenever want  food super heavy but assumed would before trying  missed robertos carne asada fries bad once vegan but now found replacement <EOR> I ordered through Postmates    goal attempt become vegan  They're good amazing! far everything great meat tastes chicken! ordering more often! <EOR> The most amazing vegan Mexican food! vegan approx 1 month  place journey much easier  flavor amazing  Asada flavorful  husband isn't meat?!? he carnivore! al pastor tasty  chicken ok  Def going back more asada! wish would open area  Loved place! just need step air conditioner game little  pretty hot stuffy  Oh green sauce hot even when tell mild! <EOR> I've place bookmarked bit finally made over try sure am glad did    I mention vegan can't compare real Mexican food simply isn't comparing apples apples   No animals harmed your meal here  !

Woo! Awesome food  chili relleno super good  back few times consistent all way through  Cool little deals throughout week take picture sign when there  weird area town but hey close Dutch bros haha  <EOR> Updating reply owner    Firstly never said nor stated am strictly vegan  being vegan however doesn't diminish nor inquiries any less valid  personal dietary restrictions don't take away concerns your food am PAYING putting body  flattered dug through other reviews though    Secondly going dispute YOUR employee SAID visit taco shop around there  Because yes he also vegan like told wasn't! and eats taco shop when he doesn't want eat where he works  Obviously weren't because if would received all information spot  Which leads to  My third point appreciate giving information food now   problem STILL FAIL realize address NOWHERE your website menus knowledge and verify ingredients sources  said yourself!! All those other places frozen pre made etc  we're suppose just now take your word basis exposed other establishments?  meant when said responsibility VEGAN establishment provide information TRANSPARENTLY READILY available support your claim  nowhere found  If don't understand am asking your ingredients your all your vegan protein? cant help you  clear it  Panchos any other place    Fourth fair here  read couple reviews BEFORE writing mine because said myself Am I? Am only thinks way? no! am alone  Read some four star reviews even five star reviews you'll see where am saying review  Your customer base not all says your establishment items constantly drink selection minuscule bare minimum hole wall reference another two reviews  first one  maybe even if reviews give four five stars should read them  don't  your business    Lastly very audacious you  Simply fact 100% vegan non gmo low sodium    your life just healthier  Why cause  low sodium? Just because believe less sodium good shows uninformed personally really are  scientific community never come consensus  less sodium best everyone  Low sodium better when you've overloaded your system if intolerance it  am need low sodium non gmo  am need less calories  Which most your dishes NOT  Based served NOT MUCH ATE alone contained all calories 24 hour period    detriment diet  Why would think eating your establishment making life healthier? know having cheat meal your restaurant? Healthy = dish protein equivalent fats carbs high volume A LOT FOOD but low fat low carb  Again something dishes served aren't    'When people say Pancho's Vegan Tacos fast food place   wonder '   Wonder no more  just answered you   If ate everyday would become morbidly obese  doesnt fit healthy profile based proportions carbs protein volume carbs MAINTAIN healthy lifestyle  Personally maintain strict diet eat often  Unfortunately cant here   I check your new location once opens old closes maybe you'll nutrition facts surely update review then  <EOR> So first time trying anything vegan !!
