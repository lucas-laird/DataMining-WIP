Because horrible service   I came dinner 2 boys requested Strip view it wasn't busy all plenty empty tables around   offered patio table which took happily  seated 10min no server greet but since boys busy drawing kids menu took some pictures view didn't mind first  Only until couple came seated table next greeted server immediately started irked  He told them he'd back he some dirty dishes hand  When he came back he took drink orders proceeded back inside until stopped complained even served since 10min ago!  He apologetic then he inside sent another server serve instead!  nerve guy!  So when other server asked drink asked manager  He proceeded but never came back take order   manager himself didn't show until some minutes later I think another 5 10 minutes meantime when 2nd server came asked if ANYONE take order all  He said he under impression wanted talk manager without ordering anything  OMG! He didn't even bother check ask just making own assumption!  When manager came table explanation 2 servers assigned patio area  where confusion started since server thought other already took care table  manager ended taking orders instead   Honestly if because boys wanted eat Chili's past 7 30P would walk find another restaurant nearby!  The food good other Chili's standard but service truly lacking! When food came realized none server even gave utensils napkins ask it  Really supposed eat food fingers I ordered steak salad ??? when asked hot sauce didn't come all until server came again see if needed anything else he realized he forgot hot sauce!  When bill came for those wondered no didn't any discount manager bill tempted omit leaving any tips but civilized part prevented left minimum 15%   Yelpers if experienced such service would leave any tips all server? <EOR> Love Chili's located right across street Aria Resort Casino   prices great Vegas strip service excellent   place real gem way save money   Order Burgers! <EOR> Can't happier service  family week ago kids forgot orthodontics retainers table  didn't realized until home night  live California  Next day called restaurant ask employee told retainers ask call manager name Miah she nice offered send them mail  Next day she called let know she sent package give tracking number  already them  does now days?? grateful nice guy served table because he kept them knowing we'll back tomoick them up  Thank u again <EOR> Horrible service food okay  returning anytime soon <EOR> I work right chili's good customer but spinach queso ridiculous   Idk if just heated some cheese threw some uncooked spinach but awful!!!!!!!!! <EOR> I say big chili's lover NY  chili's location disgusting  came late dinner maybe 9 o'clock 3 other tables having dinner wait 15 mins greeted host  Waitress pleasant took orders correctly food terrible husband both ordered honey chipotle chicken crispers mashed potatoes corn  chicken tasted laying under heating lamp hours  waited order desert ask waitress question but she disappeared over 20 minutes sadly no desert me  just stick usual chili's spots vacations <EOR> Eher Mittelmäßig Geschmack gut aber auch nicht mehr Service gut allerdings nicht aufmerksam genug haben einen Burger vergessen  Sich entschuldigt aber leider vergessen  Vielleicht kommen wir nochmal wieder und testen es erneut  <EOR> This your usual Chili's   Service good food great without expensive prices found casinos    Definitely give try if you're Vegas  Give your wallet break  <EOR> I usually come location once month live strip favorite places come amazing view strip great happy hour 9 o'clock   well why 1 star well they're supposed open till 11 today come 10 05 doors locked thinking must mistake somebody accidentally locked door wait 10 minutes till customer walks then Joanne ask staff member says oh closed early because slow kidding your restaurant location strip      asked pregnant manager if corporate would know closed early she said yes no big deal because they're slow funny thing next morning called corporate 800 number laughed said absolutely place closing sad part love Chili's location but leave star right people read see they're shutting down early   pregnant manager also said would cost more keep doors open kidding you're Chili's you're business gonna cost much keep doors open think your rent hell lot more that     Please fix problem because if happens again never back <EOR> Worst service ever! love Chilis came thinking it'll same Chilis usually California but NO  boyfriend came wasn't helped good ten minutes  only three guy servers acting full pact place but no totally empty  made eye contact no helped  Until some guy came said guys helped he didn't even introduce himself  Total disrespectful  But thanks finally some water  couple even ask someone water because no helped them ended walking leaving  Then group girls came course helped less then two minutes  Lame  But guess  happens when bunch young guys work restaurant  food good just overall service killed experience  <EOR> Me boyfriend came last day Vegas   Sunday wasn't crowded all yet service poor slow  Took forever drink  2 people take drink order before even brought us  classic margarita in mug super strong boyfriend beer barely even cold  Food good however when received bill inquired why didn't happy hour prices happy hour all day Sunday waiter said only bar outside never told upon being seated  Really unorganized lacking customer service skills  Hopefully time improve  Until then eating again  <EOR> Great food most Chilis restaurants  Since reward system wasn't working three times without getting credit manager took care all food  first class service!! <EOR> Okay know Chili's Chili's!!!!
