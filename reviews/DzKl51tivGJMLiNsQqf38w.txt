Reasonably priced   local Hawaiian hang out! <EOR> So review based upon some malasadas hubby brought home  Vegas   What Malasadas say you? Malasada Portuguese type donut   Malasadas made egg sized balls yeast dough deep fried oil coated granulated sugar  popular Hawaii since Las Vegas considered 9th Island definitely find them Vegas     craving famous Leonard's malasadas found Oahu when husband visited in laws Vegas asked find some yummy treats bring some back home Bay Area   My only concern fear being disappointed he brings back    boy happy!  He came back some haupia filled Malasadas felt weighed half pound each   Haupia type coconut custard perfect inside warm slightly crispy Malasadas   custard sweet therefore scarfed down 4 them    *oops!* **blush**was supposed save some kids? Overall still good Leonard's but definitely fit bill when came cravings    I cannot wait try rest food person   BOOKMARK! <EOR> Wife coming last four years  When we're area lunch if aren't mood cooking dinner passing work we'll call Bento Bento C  really garlic chicken  Unfortunately haven't tried anything else because Bento's much  price two bento's reasonable us  It pretty busy around lunch time wouldn't hurt call if you're rush  <EOR> This place business anymore   Quality if food dropped tremendously don't even know serve food did tonight   First all RICE came cold does rice come cold the??? garlic chicken changed doesn't taste used pole fish side totally different taste dropped dramatically   sticking pole express! Hopefully better worse because taste gotten WAY worse! <EOR> Latest visit VERY disappointing! $21 95 lunch $26 95 dinner weekdays  Again no Uni sweet shrimp lunch  Also sashimi salad crab salad only available dinner price  other sushi joints near strip charges lunch price provides all those    Ordered bunch sushi albacore tuna white tuna etc  fish teeny tiny very thin slice fish very large piece cold hard rice  trouble swallowing sushi  quality fish ok  dinner price ordered crab salad sashimi salad compared some other AYCE sushi joints sashimi salad tiny only very few pieces fish  Really disappointing quality compared other places  Also ordered sweet shrimp which only came 1 piece other sushi places gives 2 pieces charges less    The service good sushi chef nice BUT charged extra hot tea! Many sushi joints gives complimentary hot tea  Really disappointing come back anymore  <EOR> Great service even better food  town but everytime come Vegas come here  Great Local food even better full Poke bar  suggest trying malasadas if you've never but anything off menu Ono! <EOR> By far favorite sushi restaurant Las Vegas!  Chuy Jayson best sushi chefs   know want before even order! <EOR> If you're fan Hawaiian food Sushi perfect place you   We when doing Happy Hour some makis 50% off  Yay! makis tasted really great  quantity good too  stuffed only 3 maki sets + poke    Since seated counter sushi chefs occasionally asked if needed anything which nice  recommended malasadas ordered 3 regular ones 3 coconut ones  OMG malasadas amazing! especially liked coconut ones  only 89 cents per piece think other flavors too    We'll back soon try AYCE  <EOR> They very friendly only problem wasn't greeted acknowledged understand busy but feel paying customer deserve acknowledged why giving 3 stars although made friendly smile told nice day end visit  decor ambiance could also updated looks little run down  come only if only side town if there's nothing else appeals me  end all feel food portions always good which why continue return  <EOR> A good friend mine raving place long time finally took trip down Salt Lake City large part eat here  He swore he done best oversell place just but many other people nobody ever disappointed  Well   he right  place amazing!  Normally all eat sushi more matter finding place decent sushi rather anything great  But Island Sushi simply fantastic  service food can't believe good was!  I'll admit pulling place somewhat skeptical  pretty dark outside didn't even really appear open  Even coming inside initial welcome room dark pretty void people  But once into main eating area on!  I knew treat when sashimi salad poke bowl came out  could eaten nothing but those two extremely happy  But friend ordering all favorites ate all them happily  nigiri perfect  a better ratio fish rice most places  cooked dishes including soft shelled crab tempura shrimp beef couple different varieties one which right top best dishes all perfectly cooked  probably could made meal any individual dish served many different delicious items made great experience  Dessert pretty decent too  your choice 2 desserts because need 2 desserts all eat sushi! they're all pretty interesting  2 dishes involving bananas any place offers banana desserts gets points book   The service fantastic  used waiting long periods time any sushi restaurant much less all eat sushi restaurant each round orders  But Island Sushi bringing dishes left right prepared  constant stream food never left waiting  Excellent friendly service!  And price wise place great  only around $25 all eat although limit quantity certain dishes order    Next time Vegas definitely coming back Island Sushi! <EOR> I hope anyone reads Yelps realizes usually review places rubbed wrong way  Unless rub really good way thoroughly enjoyed it  First off place pits  coming while now experienced quality degrade  more come less want here  Today final nail coffin    What long wait time even order food! line good 7 minutes before given attention place order    Prices outrageous! would preferred any other Hawaiian restaurant  more filling better quality   I garlic chicken chicken katsu combo  mom saimin  what's easier? Two pieces different styles chicken frying putting noodles some toppings bowl broth? tell me     I mine 7 minutes ordering told saimin right out  Great! Then waited 7 8 more minutes before requesting refund  don't eating front other people don't waiting long something easy  time ordered time requested refund    30 minutes  little wait ask refund    Maybe little impatient but don't bring other people's order when part party already received food rest haven't  Don't forget season your customers' food    We ended going Aloha Kitchen Sunset road only 7 minutes time ordered bagged ready go  equally busy failure   The saving grace which allows two really generous stars malasadas poke  Besides plenty Hawaiian favorites choose don't if want wait want eat tasteless food  <EOR> My family HORRIBLE experience restaurant today  came Happy Hour 3pm  year old baby very picky food bring fries fast food restaurant  woman brought table told cannot outside food inside Island Sushi but explained just food baby please just let keep it  She said she would ask manager if okay  She spoke manager he came table told baby can't keep food because policy   next hour baby just sat hungry while everyone ate    So ordered food first roll table  But none eat because didn't provide any plates  sat while waiting someone come nobody came  sister stood front told them didn't plates  took 5 mins finally bring plates  Next brought niece's fish but she couldn't eat because didn't bring any forks  waited again someone come 5 minutes husband stood ask forks front  kept getting worse  ordered rice fish but didn't come until 15 minutes later fish  miso soups didn't come until 20 minutes ordered which if sushi restaurants often know  first thing place your table   did give wasabi ginger until asked again sushi restaurants ALWAYS give automatically when gave wasabi didn't come any bowls husband again sushi table ask one  total family already gotten 3 times ask stuff  Halfway done through food remind them still haven't brought 2 rolls ordered  Only manager checked once  Nobody else asked if needed anything which weird considering only 20 people restaurant weren't busy ignored    Worse yet food horrible  sushi tastes refrigerated ones buy grocery stores  raw fish thin dry  paid half price them because Happy Hour but even sushi worth it    Never coming back place again  only good thing place employees friendly manager especially  guess they're just unorganized forced follow stupid rules owner  <EOR> THIS PLACE DA BOMB!  any islander living Vegas would say!

The quality sushi good service good restrooms clean but c'mon put some hand soap bathroom! sink paper towels but no soap heck?! Sorry knock star off level 4 germ a phobe real bothersome use hand sanitizer rather use what's supposed available health department standards    One other thing pretty disappointed place called Island Sushi majority people come eat AYCE sushi but  didn't include malasadas AYCE Menu  big deal but would've rather them    awhile since them Word wise    decide whether want AYCE right away they're sticklers it  sister in law ordered edamame then decided she wanted AYCE order put said charge because can't change out  <EOR> Great place poke especially spicy ahi cube bowl  items fresh reminds being back Hawaii  staff friendly too  also some baked goods satisfy your sweet tooth  <EOR> Pokè !!! best poke town hands down  used poke place Craig but far much better !!!!!

Japanese Hawaiian good combo! place top list!! <EOR> Needed fix some local grindz while Vegas chose Island Sushi Grill because favorable ratings Yelp   Drove 16 miles 32 roundtrip DTLV ISG just satisfy yearning   most part wasn't disappointed but wasn't overly impressed     It's relatively clean place but reminiscent local hole in the wall diner back 808 similar seats stools tables floors   Dine in customers still provided meals takeout containers bit surprise  Typical local style riiight?  Luckily transplanted Hawaiian community hankering island flavors probably keeping place open business     I regular loco moco cousin poke chirashi  love fact own hamburger patties flavor very good  gravy generic nice change might L L  mac salad actually potato mac which anyone 808 would notice off bat nice distinction     The poke bowl cousin excellent  But amount poke provided priced maybe $2 more should been   good poke no doubt   buuut maybe slightly bigger bowl price  why won't eat Tanioka's Yama's Fish Market back Oahu     So why 5 stars? Aside ambience SO retro local service received     Sorry   Maybe because service industry but staff look kids transplanted islanders could perhaps meet greet customers more friendlier tone smidge more attentively well   taking while plate back register lo behold 3 workers chichatting kitchen something order just sitting there  When them noticed he asked name ???   WOW genius   we only ones aside some private party adjoining room    Anyways aside service price good place local Hawaiians needing 808 food fix   Try enjoy    <EOR> Great happy hour!

With many AYCE places hard pick choose  Even having tried many couldn't really pick best but more they're all good but here's pros cons each particular place kind answer IE some bomb apps but meh sushi great nigiri but rolls apps boring   limb best since meets lot points    First point appetizers interesting wide variety  Sure sure  Come nigiri moneys worth but gets bit repetitive way  think worth through variety foods eat    Ahi Belly Pepper Garlic sauce light but overwhelming can't taste fish melty fatty yumminess nice char  Deep Fried Geso delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus always favorite me  Salmon Lomi just okay  more tomatos anything  Ahi Poke very nice version  ordered 2! Tako Kimchee nice thin sliced octopus stirred kimchee  Hamachi Kama love kama theirs such good char perfectly crispy skin  Nigiri fish fresh  plus nigiri smaller average dont worry rice fish ratio very fairly proportional   Now some people might taken aback since all used largesse given cuts but smaller cut perfectly bite sized gives opportunity sample more variety  Some restaurants serve two bite nigiri BFs braces jaw he dislikes he bite half break eat    Standouts Escolar Super White Tuna pretty good   Cajun Albacore very nice seasoning ponzu sauce Cajun Tuna seasoning then wasabi aioli which quite unique good Yellowtail favorite fish very fresh  All rest good too  Only just okay mackerel which bit salty quality isn't norm     also special chef creation which also highlight night thin slab rice nori toasted crispy cake topped spicy chunks tuna thin slab avocado dot siracha sweet sauce probably eel sauce  very nice textures flavors together    Rolls usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll different toppings sauce  Boring  some interesting rolls  tried Croc which combined few favorite elements some spice soft shell crab sweetness some unagi  Pretty good  would gotten more but between just two whole rolls lot eat wanted variety  Next time when bring friends share with  don't half rolls except your very last roll want order   kept getting favorite handroll though salmon skin which lovely here    Dessert just standard ice cream mochi though offer too  malasada sundae 808 special creme brulee  malasada which yummy creme brulee nice flavors but wasnt solid should more runny but still good    I place satisfy appetizer people nigiri people roll people even dessert people  reason why think favorite bring all types ayce people needs met  $24 95 cheaper few bucks most dinner ayce think better quality those hit $30 mark  give 90 minutes which don't really need but just places where they're timing you    I think realize people pace sometimes you're just waiting food since all made to order stuff    Did mention hospitality? sushi chef owner very attentive talkative seems very cool  staff never even let ice teas hit halfway came check few times see if want more appetizers kitchen    Oooh if lived side town come all time!
