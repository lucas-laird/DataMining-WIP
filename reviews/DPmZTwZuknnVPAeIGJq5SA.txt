Apparently coffee isn't freshly made  pour coffee concentrate bottle WHICH also buy  Anyways gonna stick China Town location  <EOR> I love bahn mi   wish kept sugar cane juice plain no added yucky spices which ruins flavor <EOR> The bread though  Good moderately priced sandwiches  tried grilled pork  Loved baguette loved pickled veggies would loved more didn't love pork  wasn't bad just very mild flavor interesting texture  hubby club sandwich which great   Excellent friendly service  Vietnamese iced coffee STRONG yummy    I'm just dying awesome banh mi joint  Hoped would place but actually euro sandwiches better  <EOR> I used place but ordered boba once fresh  also ordered fresh spring rolls took refrigerator asked if could made fresh said fresh just made morning  Well wasn't fresh  rice paper wrapping already hard couldn't even eat outer wrapper just ate inside part didn't time back ask remade  don't often used to  still every once while  <EOR> I only come smoothies bobas  Sometimes long wait two drinks  tried any sandwiches yet  Someday    <EOR> Love place!

So never Lee's Sandwiches until location opened but heard some good bad things them  large selection sandwiches which range Asian inspired sandwiches Euro sandwiches which includes croissants sandwiches made your Asian ingredients ham cheese BLT salami  chain restaurant don't even know many locations along West Coast but sandwiches kind  feel chain restaurant   I've only couple sandwiches grilled pork BBQ pork  Give time probably try more  would've enjoyed them more if bread wasn't hard if more fillings between bread  But then almost foot long only $4 which isn't bad  Both sandwiches pretty much tasted same  liked but much  Didn't see any kind condiments sriracha soy sauce add flavor  Could suggest maybe offering some type hot soup dip sandwiches did just miss menu? But would lot better least  There's lot better choices Asian sandwiches if your willing drive   I liked all Asian snacks steamed buns drinks offering  wanna say saw some wasabi flavored shrimp chips  Let back drinks teas juices coffees hot cold drinks more   could back just these   Right now think gonna give them 3 5 star rating mostly because they're probably only business know area doing which offering Asian tasting sandwiches steam bun goods which saves driving towards Chinatown   I'd probably stop more want to  think free WiFi  <EOR> The only thing they're good coffee   sandwiches very little meat hardly taste it   Each bite taste mostly bread pickled vegetable   ordered pork roll chia lua thin slice pork roll no pate  <EOR> This place solid 4 stars  only thing need remember ask double meat double veggies next time  sandwhiches cheap tasty just needed more filling  employees nice also  <EOR> I've going Lee's since opened but must admit am getting disappointed more there  Today topped off  bought 7 sandwiches  which Op la egg banh mi sandwich eggs BURNT  mean take pride your job least re eggs  Word mouth best form marketing  am absolutely disappointed  <EOR> We big bahn mi fans decided give Lee 's second chance bad experience few years ago questionable meat   ordered grilled chicken  grilled pork sandwich  grilled chicken looked more microwaved boiled very bland  grilled pork also looked more microwaved then grilled mostly gristle fat  Both meats covered congealed fat looked never touched grill may cooked few days ago  Needless say almost all both sandwiches trash  only reason two stars instead because bread actually good  <EOR> I love Lees   this just sucks  Crappy service only when owner manager any good  Today left phone 5 minutes just forgot me   It's tough good staff especially Vegas  think guys maybe suck hiring otherwise everything great   I'm special #11 pate chaud tall iced coffee kind guy  case you're wondering <EOR> Wow  ordered 2 sandwiches them adequate but other for husband 1 thin slice ham 1 thin slice turkey it  Way much lettuce barely any mayo  Completely tasteless   Step guys!  Capriotti's less mile away never disappoints! <EOR> There time friend wanted buy some food first thing wanted Boba  rather disappointing didn't it  only but guy upfront annoyed because asked Boba <EOR> Yummy! know sandwich shop but doesn't crave good sandwich time time? certainly place  employees friendly prompt called order could use run pick ready within time told me  Food tasted great busy busy busy! back <EOR> Breakfast go!

The sandwiches taste good but pretty dry  grilled pork but pretty much mayo sandwich since five times much mayonnaise then meat  Thai tea very strong but also gritty   It wasn't busy but took fifteen minutes sandwich which kind sucked since rush  interior clean snacks available purchase    Less stellar but good cheap meal  <EOR> Aside drinks   there only reason come Asian sandwiches   I eat grilled pork sandwich every day life   don't bother European sandwiches much else   you likely disappointed  <EOR> Sandwich man scorned     I am long time fan ALL sandwiches  don't discriminate  em big round fat juicy sometimes dry but always tasty   deep dark hunger inside when started shift afternoon  all hadn't eaten working swings your eating clock way off  zooming through yelp looking sandwich shops area something different your average Capriotti's Jason's Deli Jersey Mikes   You picture    I want put clear concise can  If award false advertisement picture website menu actual sandwiches place would hit award  never honestly more disappointed food purchase  place everything going them too  Fresh lettuce tomato croissant all tasty but only slice ham roast beef turkey #38 Lee's Club   sandwich named property such lack love meat disgrace  If signature food company would purchase recommend food services anyone  <EOR> Four stars only because only ordered coffee location  probably bump star once actually dine in! seems  reason negative reviews service but anyway   service quick friendly  establishment also appeared really clean! wouldn't definitely pass Starbucks coffee here  coffee actually keeps awake energized lol <EOR> If you're need caffeine kick then come Lee's try iced coffee  Its $4 50 large would keep awake all day! Lee's location isn't busy Chinatown of course but its clean ample seating  Usually people take sandwiches but did see some older Asian gentlemen hang Lee's  some bottled coffee options fridge when first walk in  Its kind pricey around $7 3 servings  didn't know fresh would since they're prepackaged gf opted 2 Large iced coffees 2 large triple shot iced coffees  would compare large venti starbucks  I asked cashier difference between regular iced triple shot she just said triple shot 3 shots  When asked many shots regular iced coffee she said none  surprising but then saw pour bottled prepackaged premade coffee into cups  never knew Lee's didn't coffee fresh! way tastes good regardless works well if need study stay awake  would recommend triple shot coffee  think its regular iced coffee 3 shots espresso I'm sure its also prepackaged bottled   Its super thick extremely sweet even ice all melted  <EOR> Decided smoothies Lee's Sandwich cousin  small Strawberry Smoothie boba  smoothie tasted alright but tasted better somewhere  <EOR> The only good employee seemingly female works here  rest give 3 4 cup your drink your order wrong refuse it  example giving medium when ordered large then all put drink medium cup into larger cup without topping off  specific guy always hovers over pay feeling entitled tip literally pressing button dispenser your iced coffee    The female employee would drinks properly  Most guys skimpy try sneaky jip you  no accidents    Sometimes your sandwich thin sliver meat  consider your Bahn Mi pickled veggie sandwiches  still tasty but almost no meat  <EOR> Drove across town cause says closes 9 30   Its 9 11 people wouldn't let in  <EOR> Bread always nice fresh! Sandwiches very consistent which great  very happy there's area now <EOR> As Bay Area native find Lee's sandwiches neck woods wonderful surprise!  I've eating less no meat days but craving Viet sandwich because especially love eating fresh French bread rolls baguettes crosissants   layering complex bold flavors Viet sandwiches known for savory sweet spicy herby cilantro hint sandwiches better average    When walked asked cashier I think name Jezlynn thoughts veggie sandwich  She said really good fried tofu vermicelli onions lieu meat  She also mentioned comes veggie sauce but since asked mayo it doesn't come it she suggested flavorful veggie sauce side  Jezlynn 100% correct! enjoyed sandwich French Dip w Au Jus except Veggie Sandwich w Veggie Au Jus    Thank your thorough description suggestions  Your customer service excellent  Wish more places hired employees you! <EOR> I excited see location near home but visiting it    anymore  Ordered 1 reg coffee 1 mocha  Girl behind ordered 1 reg coffee  She first  Wouldn't order made first? Guess not  Walking friend accidentally spilled coffee everywhere inside restaurant  He didn't even put straw it  wouldn't comp new drink even though he didn't drink it  He ended buying new one  Almost $4 whole new drink costs probably less 50c make  your store policy whatever but bad customer service  look cheap  Greedy unsympathetic management  <EOR> Ordered vegetarian sandwich OMG  best sandwich  Even if aren't vegetarian not give try!  BUT reason giving 4 stars because don't eat sandwich right away if don't eat right away bread HARD ROCK super fast  So only order sandwich if you're eatin ASAP  <EOR> I'm least once week!
