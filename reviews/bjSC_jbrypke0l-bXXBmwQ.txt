Herkommen lohnt sich auf alle Fälle <EOR> Choosing Vic Anthony's over plethora other great Vegas steakhouses wasn't easy   sure many if all other options would great well but very pleased choice   service absolutely wonderful food amazing filet crab lobster filet combo special    We'll tempted try another Vegas steakhouse next time around new experience but may well end back Vic Anthony's because great   Our only complaint and big one Golden Nugget valet full at 7p parking garage worst ever experienced long delays nearly full expensive though V A's validates slow crappy elevator stairwells lock behind preventing re entering garage!  But since parking isn't restaurant's fault won't ding them that  <EOR> Ok am very torn many stars giving V A's  Here's break down think you'll see why  four Food 4 Price 4 Service 5 can give more five?

The meat the important part right? great but pinnacle all steak houses opinion   ordered rib eye $55 taste bone cut clocked $69 dollars night 21oz cut Market Price    enjoyed marbled taste both ribeye but flavoring bit peppery some areas seasoning did appear spread across entire cut well hoped   chance sample filet mignon well great but again something immediately fell love with    Overall very fine experience definitely back however when comes FAVORITE steakhouses I'd still say Ruth's Chris Craftsteak still favorites     Definitely worth try EVERYTHING overall package   Thank Vic Anthony's <EOR> This place fantastic  Usually am very cautious eating restaurants hotel staying in  Service fantastic  end year office trip 5 people  All food served perfectly no mistakes great  atmosphere perfect  don't super dressed dressy casual just fine  bit pricey though would only reason didn't give full 5 stars  would say apparent because place pretty empty Thursday night  back yes! <EOR> The best steaks expensive but worth  very large portions shared tried many prime steak houses town rates cut envy <EOR> My favorite steak house   Excellent meats seafood selection great service atmosphere fine service too  Buoy keep Gallaghers RuthChris etc <EOR> Noah bartender simply amazing!

For maincourse took medium filé juicy good pared peppercorn sauce ok but nothing special  company shared side mashed potatoes big dissapointment  prefer mash silky smooth example Boa Steakhouse L A now closed Dakota Steakhouse but mash full lumps potatoes its skin left  know some people think lumpy mash good old home feeling but aside mash lacked any flavor  real downside    I rounded dinner classic creme brulée berrys wich good but nothing remember  companys chocolate cake step she really happy it    If steaks vibe place worth 4 something more then bad mash wich brings points down  service close service remembered first visit  waiter made feel rushed felt bit annoyed fact wanted eat appetizer before deciding main dishes  Whats problem?   So appetizers wich should missed gets 4 5 steaks gets 4 sides service gets 2  All all solid 3 pointer  Would back but hopefully better waiter  skip mash try gratin potatoes lyonaise instead  <EOR> I high hopes Vic Anthony's  food pretty good but nothing amazing special any way  service great waiter very friendly attentive helpful  Maybe just high expectations but better steak house Reno  saying bad but just great  ordered Prime Strip cooked exactly ordered but wasn't impressed  husband ordered veal which pounded very thin breaded seemed more bread meat ratio  also ordered onion strings side which came huge mound plate not very appealing mediocre no better would fast food joint  Luckily desserts delicious  ordered pecan crusted ice cream caramel sauce amazing  can't remember dessert he ordered but good he tempted order another  overall think worth 4 stars  don't think would back during future trips Vegas I'd try somewhere else  <EOR> I've never ribeye much flavor cooked perfection  Request chefs perpetration cost $65 but worth every penny  getting complimentary reach around chef  <EOR>
